I‚Äôm sorry. 

Downvote away Yeah that‚Äôs pretty much stance guys holier-than-thou, take Joe Rogan‚Äôs word fact, kinda guys lol. I‚Äôm leaning towards even worth speaking it. Let's call ""wait see"" people are: anti-vaxxers Yes, course. could otherwise?

And also, demand wouldn‚Äôt exactly considered peaked 25% yet made appointments time race. ultimately win number infected goes low doesn‚Äôt enough opportunity mutate.

One great news Covid mutates less frequently influenza. high number mutations simply high rate infection.  Thanks, know colleges avoid. numbers simply tell different story.

Dallas County already open four mortalities 1.6 million vaccinated. four severely compromised.

The numbers showing large vaccines profound effect COVID outcomes across board.

Of course right thing wait local population vaccinated everyone planning so.

At point, time reopen. That‚Äôs exactly thought last weekend feeling like got hit bus 2nd Moderna shot. ""1-2 months""

Read much? link full errors misses entire point Geert makes, vaccinating people likely exposed virus vaccine instantiates full immune response puts selection pressure escape immune response. 

It akin finishing antibiotics. oh right lol even capable reporting deaths

how know? India? two recent studies show opposite. Natural immunity infection proving similarly protective vaccination.

That may may true 15 year old nephew caught Covid twice. 6 months ago, got sick last week tested positive Friday. 

The unfortunate truth we‚Äôre uncharted territory here. **Bottom line people need get vaccinated.** People refuse vaccinate perpetuating situation. They‚Äôre giving virus opportunity mutate, possibly making tools less effective.

Edit: add doctors didn‚Äôt want test him. told didn‚Äôt need since still antibodies first infection. told felt exactly demanded test him. surprised find fact Covid‚Ä¶again. feel like sort information freely shared behind zero pay wall considering concerns literally everyone. judging views outside hospital definitely believe otherwise. certainly hope people somehow learn cautious leave space little bit time going back way normally act Everyone tipping point. would not?

I'm Argentina, Pfizer performed phase 2/3 clinical tests here, major supply vaccines supposed guaranteed. government managed screw up, halted negotiations, getting Sputnik, Sinopharm Covishield. dribs drabs

Imagine face hear somewhere vaccines disposed üò± Unbelievable  think everybody kinda understands pretty much every country underreported deaths, whether simply didnt know covered up. dont think ive heard country overestimating corona-related deaths either gets Italy, truly don‚Äôt care. vaccines working, working well. Let's get next set age groups approved rolling! ""worse"" good news disproportionately Republican voters die shaming makes feel good gives approval among peer group. Seems pretty rational me. Man hard helm things. Tell people need multiple shots get turned thinking never end. Tell people one dose enough think vaccines work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Really wish people country could follow science. Like even time. middle one century pandemic. really quite encouraging see numbers consistently dropping imagine wearing behind ear hearing aids ears glasses along mask string. It‚Äôs awful I‚Äôm okay long I‚Äôm free move internationally again. put tldr ...it tldr one top. current severe global disparities vaccine supply *because* high-income countries hoarded disproportionate quantity doses early trials successful? worst thing since India main supplier vaccines low-and-middle-income countries Africa, global poor facing prolonged vaccine shortages need most. Cool. Florida. Yeah mean past year. like yearly flu shit like that. Depending age kids, may less likely spread covid they‚Äôre younger 10. outside helps lower transmission rates well, kids would lower risk environment compared activities. that‚Äôs *if* someone even happened infected covid, sounds pretty unlikely, given adults vaccinated responsible. 

It hard everyone adjust covid guidelines precautions. remember complete disbelief back March 2020, took long, long time start feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù wearing mask, distancing, etc (if even call normal). It‚Äôs going take time start feeling comfortable retraining risk level covid goes down. fun BBQ! first many similar events, hope! Tell blood clots exceedingly rare. Even low risk death Covid, probability far higher probability dying vaccine induced blood clot.

Basically risk perspective vaccine no-brainer.

Now guys work idiots understand sure say them. say thing Virginia. real plans drop restrictions, keep things are. Maybe increase capacity there. nothing really concrete. even home, I've seen enough videos people dying streets think death everywhere right now. Bad spot. hide blanket don‚Äôt come gonna keep virus end pandemic many new variants including B.1.617 variant keep cropping vaccines first variant fully distributed?

At rate, we‚Äôll never get control. strain completely resistant vaccines gonna pop soon rate. gets Italy finally celebrate honeymoon, I‚Äôd wear anything point. Data wise rate getting COVID vaccination still incredibly low. Hence spike people full vaccinated. go ahead celebrate, pray/hope people continue get vaccinated 5 year old son naturally pretty anxious, we've handled shots way great. matter fact, focus much better get shot get sick. anxiety getting sick may part board shots. Every burp gas bubble feels he's nervous he's going get sick throw up. often sneaks Lego bin bed ""in case"" throw up, even he's feeling perfectly fine. anything help keep getting sick, he's 100% board with. Hopefully number grows substantially. ....but wait see person anymore. Got vaccine month ago. Plenty wait see people get vaccines plenty claim wait see fact interest vaccinated ever. least learn little country hate much? densely populated poor areas first vaccinated. often get dedicated clinics appointments unlike rest  do, thanks! national one, states record shots given. (really well done) Excelsior Pass works NY. drop science em. really worth time tell - variants around world affect youth lot more. US, benefit access range vaccines. Honestly, try show bad still going places worldwide, lot media reports use, well YouTube videos such. 

Type ‚ÄúCovid younger‚Äù google news pull several articles doctors scientists talking first point above. Well, me, pretty severe reaction 1st dose within 20 minutes transported ER monitoring (after getting EpiPen jab case) afterwards. I'm pretty skeptical getting 2nd dose I've gotten different advice different doctors. supposed say, 'may another?' ;) not. living dystopian times. Lizard people control government. There's deadly virus finally means beat one things slowing people role playing revolutionaries thinking manly get cure. not, what's holding whole world back right now.  think earlier comment political, I'll try again:

*Obviously* government one chief culprits obvious negligence complacence. highly simplistic chalk that. Almost low-and-middle-income countries facing vaccine shortages, perhaps there's systemic issue ensuring equitable distribution vaccines around world?  found part Rome really dirty. feel like capital city first world country.      Agreed. I‚Äôll accept it‚Äôs mostly get 100 deaths day.  California bottom feeder education dink   *laughs Philippines*

A government who's mass testing. Drinking excess impact you. whole lot dead women would still alive today drunk, abusive husbands.  Get grip dude, trump murder anyone. Lmao disaster  like live different worlds. wife shunning world since last year many people going like there's pandemic. Okay blueAnon. Actually new York did, there's proof!  Please log take walk outside get fresh air. need Even j&amp;j? I‚Äôm sorry :( used fine vaccines blood work kid went serious medical problem get tons blood work get nauseous look away.

Could therapy help? Hurray deutschen Impfstoff soll die Welt genesen. AZ claims 79%: claims around 66%, single dose. Sinovac requires two doses reach effectiveness, 16% single dose. Latin America becoming common second doses delayed two months longer. government stating current ideal interval 56 days, suggests may become longer: non-paywall version story 4 days ago.  care facilities, often mandatory. didn‚Äôt actually say shove light holes damn don‚Äôt laugh mental image every time hear it.  folks really need look ear-savers. one use flexible piece silicon raised circles string mask onto. connect one side mask it, bring mask face, reach behind head connect side.

Thanks, good point! bit patient! Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll quoting whole response info appreciated knowledge. actuarial tables interesting me, thanks! sounds like similar situation regards vaccines still careful kids family. I‚Äôm personally comfortable anything outside like BBQ. I‚Äôm still avoiding stuff inside can. poor countries enough money, global vaccine distribution based fatness country's wallet?

In late January, 16% world's population access 60% vaccine supply time. countries/regions like US, Canada, UK, EU preordered enough vaccine cover 150% 500% populations. long-term, hoarding mean poorest countries get fully vaccinated 2023. Us needing second doses need unless switch second pfizer India *needs done more* anything else, least positive change. Getting people workplaces also positive. given covid far prevalent illness going around places, yes get tested. thought cold ended testing positive covid, fully vaxxed 6 weeks. mild happy knew didnt brush spread (we‚Äôre still sure symptomatic vaccinated people shed virus). now, vaccinated someones shows symptoms get test. Eventually likely wont test covid unless severe dont think yet. headline article *you linked* says Pfizer effective neutralizing variant. 

Even Israeli health minister says data needed, *the next paragraph* says vaccine efficacy remains high. hoping would US haha. Canada's always bit ahead  would go compressing it, bottling hooking medical oxygen regulators? would scale process taking cylinders away large scale production? Factory made, personal O2 generators might meet demand one two people, already employed. Anything could build parts hardware store would completely unscalable, especially think logistics getting people need. truers? Give tax credits people getting vaccine. 500 per vaccine per family. Money thing American families need pride self-reliance. Nah, comment spot on. China trying paint US negatively this. ain't working.  order good bounce back economy, people kinda alive spend money 40 B.C. vaccinated today AZ! happy. Interesting. previously infected individuals received doses? would antibody titer look like? vasovagal response chronically low bp? hope next one better you! would anyone skip? What‚Äôs thought process there? I'm kinda wishing waiting AZ.... 

but.. availble younger gens need MRNA.. soo.. It‚Äôs far tragic scenes seen far pandemic. can‚Äôt even imagine smell bones burnt around crematoriums. know people refer legality technicality, it‚Äôs mostly political financial reasons. (1) people choosing wear mask selfishness, ignorance, and/or ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù stance science (2) colleges need students. students required covid-19 shot, bode well want shot make issue individual freedom. We‚Äôve seen issue last years primary secondary schools requiring school children vaccinated local ordinances policies place ‚Äúenforce‚Äù health safety. Unfortunately, bode well support conservative areas.

FDA approval factor, factor every school. list schools area requiring vaccinated students probably capital resources withstand students dropping deferring admission. Meaning, likely selective schools high number applicants. schools laid minimized hours many workers versus schools lay anyone found work employees whose responsibilities diminished due pandemic. I'm using official mortality data gives excess mortality 300K, yes yet high excess compared 110K official figure. France Italy probably slightly better reporting. C'mon guy. It‚Äôs safe say could multiply number times two 2.5 considering people dropping dead like flies here. Life mysterious full unknowns. really wonder nicknames Eratosthenes growing up. Yup. wide swath people realized novel disease is. called SARS physical attributes resemble previous Coronavirus/SARS virus, COVID way obtaining brand new classification: thrombotic viral fever. new classification we've never endemic disease like society's history, barely starting understand *what is* first place. narrative young adversely effected going change greatly next mine today well. Went walk felt wobbly. 
Feels almost like jet lag  info here, actual presentation put forward all, context, many latin maerican countries delaying second dose months, ETA second doses keeps getting pushed further, first-dose protection EXTREMELY relevant here. grandpa gone without second dose 2 months already, pretty much best private health insurance buy here. 

With way, presentation states, assuming 14-day period second dose already ppased, there's 80% rate preventing death, 85% preventing hospitalization 67% preventing symptomatic infection. 

Slide 13 shows efectiveness people 1, 2 doses. single-dose efectiveness symptomatic infection is, again, 16%. preventing hospitalization, 35.7%. preventing ICU stay, 42.7% preventing death, 40%.

I can't stress enough single-dose effectiveness place doses hard get critical, Sinovac, honest opinion, go ""better nothing"" area.

Compared AstraZeneca's vaccine, second abundant vaccine around here, mRNA vaccine, difference quite straggering 21 days, single dose infection prevention effectiveness AZ vaccine around (hard tell graph) 45%. month, around 60%. That's far Sinovac's DOUBLE dose effectiveness, ~7%.

If got wrong, post source I'll correct it, intention misinform Since beginning especially worried India. mathematically impossible soft ride f virus circumstances. 

My heart them. huge capacity produce vaccines, unfortunately hasn‚Äôt prevented horror movie scenes. hear you. I'm anti Vax means, kind new medication gives mad anxiety. Antibiotics, Dr wanted antidepressants chronic pain fought tooth nail, vaccines. always fear ill reaction. Drawing blood bother me. still get vaccines....then sit 3 days wondering I'm experiencing rare symptom cause brain dumb like that. Must kind weird sponsorship deal No, really say that.

A ship quarantine foolproof. one getting ship set period time. effective, literally risk transmission.

A lockdown foolproof whatsoever. ""lockdowns"" still allow people go outside walk something, even supposed to, talk other, go get groceries. That's lockdown much less effective, there's still movement people still mingling. Singaporean here; I'll admit we're better quite parts world nowhere near ""best place"". Despite minimal cases still gathering limits, curfews, mask mandate everywhere, even outdoors. Taiwanese NZers way freer us currently terms country.

*What current guidelines NSAID use vaccination?
Per CDC guidelines, recommended stop taking medications currently without first consulting physician. taking NSAIDs daily management chronic medical condition, stop taking COVID-19 vaccine without asking physician.

The CDC recommends taking additional medications beyond daily medication regimen, including NSAIDs acetaminophen (Tylenol), getting COVID-19 vaccine.

After getting COVID-19 vaccine, CDC specific data recommendations whether NSAIDs acetaminophen reduce efficacy vaccine. However, participants clinical trials vaccines told avoid NSAIDs acetaminophen vaccine, evidence suggesting vaccine less efficacious individuals take medications. such, unless specific medical condition prevents taking drugs, institutions recommend NSAIDs acetaminophen relief side effects receiving COVID-19 vaccine.* dunno - we're good start dropping requirements masks outdoors fully vaccinated. gives hope mask-wearing beginning end.  know many people who'd pay hundred bucks avoid getting free vaccine.

One two qualify. 


The fact matter is, *never* vaccine side effect observed months later. obviously reference population level, individual level. course always rare, one billion individual develops symptoms later. population level, side effects *always* seen within first days weeks. Th issue NOW, September. still need masks 4 months? alarming. Something like 75% Los Angeles county probably immunity natural infection vaccination. widely expected vaccination campaign expected really mid May u.s. It‚Äôs country nearly 1.4 billion, significant amount population living poverty cramped living conditions. India always going get second wave, country government poor job preparing second wave. understand parallel argument find strange think basic understanding Covid vs mRNA vaccine instance.

Sure thanks situation USA like? vaccines successful reducing severity infection? able follow much shitstorm going India? totally good thing. I'm surprised many comments far think article fear mongering. see great news justification/call young people get vaccinated. takes 10-14 days vaccine help, it‚Äôs late. friend stay home, get tested get vaccinated soon he‚Äôs clear I'm expert guess impossible tease various factors affect Rt, fact spring temps similar fall temps, fall exponential growth, suggests vaccinations controlling factor here, warmer weather. Also many states fourth ""surge"" March weather getting warmer. makes think temps play minor role. UK limited AZ 30+, may limited 40+ vaccine committee believes necessary. gym open months wear masks. cases I'm pretty sure math mandatory curriculums. Also, zero doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, people prior COVID-19 infection antibody levels similar people without prior infection two vaccine doses.

Weird works. 5g bionic laser eye says different. half way point terms vaccinations U.S need herd immunity. I‚Äôve said, hypothetical. You‚Äôre coming doom scenarios working up. takes generally great, gives platforms people even worse takes. That's recent. dominant strain recent Michigan outbreak, caused hospitalizations, UK variant. Supply demand almost everywhere USA. Everyone 16 wants get vaccine can. mean anyone paying attention black &amp; white stats, several ""younger people hospital Covid"" news stories last March, too. agree seeing % ICU population shift hospital age, expected based vaccination intake age group. YES, Covid remains ""capable"" hospitalizing patients age, still seem proven related viral change beyond increased transmissibility we've seen VOCs. really strange time works. periods throughout pandemic felt like eternity. I'm thinking back October feels like million years ago. yet...it somehow *also* feels like blinked year passed right Anyone die covid everyone make vaccines. America domestic production whereas we're reliant others supplying us. yes compare covid deaths state's vaccine rollout fair comparison. think seeing younger people now. spat articles last spring reporting X% patients age 45/55/60. X usually smaller relevant share population trivially low (e.g. think important know variants impact young people harder virus last year, think based doctor saying they're seeing young patients without information. seeing young people seeing less old people largely vaccinated noting change ratio? seeing young people cases result hospitalizations area? case counts hospital census decrease younger people admitted would previously told recuperate home? young infected person likely hospitalized past? way telling information presented. Yes has. B.1.617 South African variant resistant vaccines. Slightly, that‚Äôs things start. Slightly. 

And I‚Äôve already said, it‚Äôs sterilizing immunity, there‚Äôs risk life long disability. two things. First, saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúless dangerous flu young people‚Äù ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt get sick‚Äù completely wrong. 

It‚Äôs deadly younger people compared older population, that‚Äôs true. people lingering effects disease including respiratory problems. It‚Äôs far contagious flu. far know young people still far likely die covid influenza. 

Second, getting vaccine also makes less likely pass virus someone else, even you‚Äôre concerned getting sick yourself. wouldn‚Äôt call someone selfish wanting get vaccine isn‚Äôt fully approved. think people want look others. 

I personally think vaccine worth avoid risk developing long term complications getting virus reduce risk spread virus loved ones, especially older people family. vaccine 100% effective stopping virus, every bit take reduce spread helps. racist 1 year ago ü§î Yeah something Nate Silver saying Twitter.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs surprising natural infection worked primer first vaccine dose booster,‚Äù said Mount Sinai‚Äôs Dr. Viviana Simon, coauthored vaccines still greatly reduce risk hospitalizations death new variants work way getting natural infection do. technically less effective new variants regards antibody response, still incredibly effective. would say family fully vaccinated troubles. far I‚Äôm aware, currently restrictions private parties in-person gatherings anywhere United States, meaning prediction mine several months. 

Has ever restrictions like US?  Yup, waiting students commit announcing vaccine requirmeent [under armor fantastic keeping drowning mask, I‚Äôve problem described switched problems since virus first came around December. mutated adapted become much lethal, main reason seeing young people hospitals. Yea, absolutely younger people getting vaccine another factor, people seem completely disregarding fact virus changed. Brazil many elderly vaxxed US, younger younger people dying hospitalized COVID. That‚Äôs virus changed variants stronger. think probably right. Covid keeps mutating control, constantly evading vaccines + natural immunity never reduces infectiousness lethality, indeed worst pathogen human history

Something tells though... Also, it‚Äôs hospitalized people concerned. Many long-haulers healthy got COVID, never hospitalized result (many ‚Äúminor‚Äù cases.) think problem even though likely can't get infected, still carry virus long enough give unvaccinated person, person becomes potential variant generator.

The virus like enemy agent trying reach place damage. stow away transport without ever directly invading harming it, hitching ride get real target. Oh sure. stepping gym long time, even I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. India virus lab right that's people get Republicans- FlU!!!  Yea guy part problem.

Every tweet sky falling.  depends covid activity area. Michigan roll dice. California Hawaii, big deal. pressing worry mom &amp; sister gotten shots?? That's source continued long-term risk household. One afternoon soccer minor exposure compared hanging around un-vaccinated family members week week. I'm happy you. Others lucky.

My wife retired medical business we've locked much possibly can. got first shot last Thursday. percentages extremely misleading don‚Äôt actually explain actual number cases, actually healthy individuals, definition ‚Äúhospitalization‚Äù (did walk hospital get observed, talking actual life threatening event).

Whole article (and rest media matter) trying keep people clicking.  want anybody know either

Honestly fuck that, everyone needs know. hear way way way way way fucking much people passing shit like flu someone know sick week got better.  

It needs common knowledge virus normal run mill shit. likely, yes, really vaccine. type clotting disorder immune related, there‚Äôs plausible explanation adenovirus vector used vaccine could cause that. *But,* happened younger women, even then, it‚Äôs still rare. choosing get vaccine right now, information, 41 year old woman, would choose get Pfizer Moderna. (I get Pfizer, February, time available quickest.) 55, man, would get whatever get arm fastest, J&amp;J included. It‚Äôs simple. We‚Äôre seeing enormous vaccine hesitancy among urban young folks. don‚Äôt oppose vaccines, can‚Äôt bothered get them.

Vaccine rates 40 crowd worrying right now. October earliest, I'm Europe. Would mind explaining ‚Äúmake‚Äù oxygen know done right, oxyhydrogen made instead someone doesn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre doing? I‚Äôm genuinely interested :) Except gym perfect breeding ground Covid fair assumption. fucking boomers really wanna see world burn requisite 4 million people first shot (decided PM, Viktor Orban). Friday still 100.000 first shots needed, opened limited amount Pfizer doses everyone, resulting basically Hunger fairness, Nate Silver absolutely dreadful takes pandemic.

A polls aggregator sticking oar stuff. There's people believe mrna vaccine makes one immune virus true explained clearly official s, reduces infectiousness main part viral receptors last sentence understatement. vaccines insanely good preventing cases overall, even catch Covid vaccinated risk hospitalization death miniscule. work great. tired mask fanatism.

Fortunately weirdos sub - normal people want masks stay. missed one schedule  Small nitpick, 58% vaccinates now. Also there's need account fact least 7% remaining 42% recovered. comparison purely vaccine protection protection (say test group 100 people 50 vaccinated 50 recovered, going get 94% efficacy numbers something much lower). states, yes. states, way.  Indeed. area pretty even split gotten/are getting vaccinated sort ""reason"" scheduled vaccinations. Regardless reason vaccination appear individual's desire vaccinated *heavily* correlated individual's political views. Pfizer Israel said concerns get huge population size people getting right kind resources like example could get rationed care heal keep fighting virus virus spreads mutates doesn‚Äôt matter *correct* *incorrect*. taking medical advice anyone trusted medical professional. Unfortunately Rogan announced people regardless age take vaccine, one would mention ‚Äúlack expertise epidemiology‚Äù Medical statistics usually accurate Russia. like ages Covid. Accurate statistics shows shortcomings poor management fake data reported instead.

Covid one notable obvious examples. Impossible. US market still flooded products made China. There's way production remains long like situation bad. I'm 40 TSA control airports something? thought security. didn‚Äôt know airport authority. recall someone mentioning given India's huge population 25-27 thousand people would die India every day. pointed way crematoriums would swamped, extra crematorium sites needed, extra 3,000 daily deaths due COVID. real death toll must far higher. hate say Michigan one states wanted kidnap &amp; kill governor, literally. wanted go go full India, survival fittest. Garbage link That's highly doubtful. I'm healthcare provider work covid patients, throughout pandemic regularly tested. also went ahead antibody test personal curiosity last fall. test I've ever taken ever positive.  Feel free tell people hospitalized good thing. feeling they'd disagree. Going Michigan next weekend like vaccinated moderna. doesnt full protection variants. vaccine developed variants arose. working third doses right include them. due respect, think waited long enough. Please, get vaccinated soon can. Immunity infection good immunity vaccine. better vaccinated need it, vaccinated need it.

If value return pre-pandemic normal, get vaccinated. relies *everyone* who's eligible get one, actually get one.

Sure, actually reaching %100 vaccination rate unrealistic, assume everyeone else get one won't. better that. ""I've never seen can't true!"" Don‚Äôt think second dose may waste time based article: research needs done strategy could deployed general population. includes long-term follow-up see long immunity lasts single dose previously infected people. Larger samples diverse populations also needed account individual variation immune responses infection vaccination. So... Someone said 2014 stuck since.  Modi running behind personal legacy... interested running country, interested becoming father nation.... think Monthly average March 2021 means? Confirmed equal infected

At least pont confirmed cases something tool track changes instead actual cases, positivity rate matter much feel families who're sickened hospitalized, long we're seeing break-through cases think time lay blame surge refuse vaccinated. I'm victim-blaming, like wearing seat belt car. Well that's next parliamentary election permanent

how no. want wear fine dont impose others. Im tired mask fanatism. Masks go. yet almost 600k Americans dead this.

You may gotten disease, showed symptoms. state state basis, quite states would consider good shape. 3 5 friends refuse get vaccine. 20s. one says he's nerd never leaves home get it, also get flu shot. one says changes dna refused hear info doesn't. Final one talk it, says naive falling leftist scare tactics.

Pretty healthy friend group. left right.  not. mainly UK variant. thing happened Israel vaccination younger populations caught up. ""What long term effects expecting why?""

Normally, even put concerns basic level scrutiny. helped convince Mom get vaccinated Overproduction - put loads doses bin

There still 7 billion people chance get even single one. Yeah you‚Äôre healthy underlying medical conditions ibdont understand mask fanatism reddit got sick first week April last year going gym. Can't prove covid, almost positive gym, distancing like crazy mild case asthma try keep lungs muscles baseline. They're dangerous places germs closing makes sense. jog outside calisthenics.

I membership longer. 2024? That's long time dude two different things. exact story wife  getting downvoted, right. September, anyone wants vaccine domestically time fully vaccinated. point, masks theater. Ok, you‚Äôre referencing different timescale article. aren‚Äôt trying make comparison: look chart article, column December, one average January March, one April. know it‚Äôs riskier last March? No, that‚Äôs article about. They‚Äôre lying, you‚Äôre superimposing view think article says actually conclude are. think lot dishonest really work great!

But *get* vaccine work. don‚Äôt think so. vulnerable people also likely support conservative, nationalist parties done worst handling responses. Killing supporters would really dumbass conspiracy.  please land border remains closed, Canadians allowed fly U.S. ‚Äî citizens need get negative COVID-19 test going. [Canadians dual also drive U.S. God bless america this. Except fact pro vaccine correct advice. Oh ok, confused bit. misleading aren‚Äôt explaining data. constitutions hospitalization? fact walked hospitals doors? news longer gives context explanation anything put there. 

More young people might end hospital old people older population already hospital hell lot susceptible getting virus first place.

Like someone posted earlier, cuz 9 people 40 went get checked instead 5 previous month doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs gigantic new wave 40% increase young people put ventilators. ""Fauci **and Others**"" tbh immediately [thought Lord  I'm speaking European perspective man, let people wearing one heavy face masks, limited capacity heavy ventilation better nothing. got first dose moderna haven‚Äôt signed second dose yet. It‚Äôs month half. violating kind rule? person probably wear mask inside anyway care ""what government wants."" 11k cases March 1.

400k cases April 30. dumb people actually start dying rest us move on. Germany authoritarian country though. Germany authoritarian country though. Oh fuck. completely forgot that. weekday, seen numbers low weekday since summer last year. Sat/Sun (which reported Sun/Mon) always bit lower due everywhere reporting weekends, 7 weekday epic. Good, earned it. That's fair point, especially community spread low. mean much since young children get vaccinated household long time yet anyway, thinking people skipping second shot altogether.  never kill Covid, going yearly boosters least near future longer. Pfizer expensive though. cost 10 dollars per dose. That's price Coronavac (Sinovac). 

Yes, Pfizer offer different prices per country.   LMAO fucking point goddamn think little behind who's making boogeymen blame problems. saying wrong, seems date first dose near complete coverage, terms population immunity first dose number much important.

It‚Äôll never happen, would better strategy pause second dose vaccination US ship doses India now.

Both humanitarian reasons self interest trying prevent new variants. 1 Week considered fully vaccinated second shot, got shit asap. What‚Äôs obesity rate America?

I lost smell completely, hunger. foods liked tasted strange unpleasant sense smell, found eating strange stuff - uncooked pasta, cans peas, *anything* feel sated.

Sometimes, I‚Äôd eat something like apple, brain would decide since didn‚Äôt smell like apple, probably poison, I‚Äôd get incredibly nauseated.

I got sense smell back couple months, well.

Now, four months later, sudden sense smell twisted gross. Coffee smells like hot garbage water.

Yes, 800 deaths day bad single state. pull ridiculous flu numbers from? That‚Äôs said most. doesn‚Äôt. methodology estimating flu deaths insanely bad.

IIRC basically assumes 90% flu cases aren‚Äôt reported, reasonable since people don‚Äôt go doctor flu. takes number flu deaths know about, multiples 10, account unreported cases.

But obviously flu cases go hospital severe ones, account vast majority deaths. probably think you‚Äôre wrong Interesting motivational tactic: ""If get vaccine soon, we're shipping India.""

Sounds like believe numbers coming China I‚Äôm betting man (and since Covid I‚Äôm less inclined even think betting) make (very conservative) prediction, suspect travel bubble US UK sometime summer, assuming everything holds.

Oregon, we‚Äôve cases til find people fall 2 categories - either terrified covid think likely die get (bc don‚Äôt know anyone got wasn‚Äôt sick, read news) think it‚Äôs big deal bc don‚Äôt know anyone died got super sick it. Real number likely 10x exponential growth, death numbers shocking beyond already shocking amounts seen last year. combination variety reasons: lack access vaccines, people vaccine, relatively low virus infection rates drive vaccination numbers believe quite bit it‚Äôs warning, it‚Äôs pretty safe say can. High levels blood creatinine cause kidney damage. sure people don‚Äôt know this. It‚Äôs one things test general health blood screening. others said, pretty good overall. 50% adults 16 least 1 vaccine shot. We're starting see vaccine demand dry up, that's expected. think 'red' (conservative) states struggling bit higher infection rates healthcare demand. 'blue' states looking good now. think hoping open things many states next month two.

Today went restaurant (an Indian one fact) pick take-out lunch, allowing reduced number dine-in customers (with sensible distancing tables). many restaurants same. road back normalcy.

Most people accepted wearing masks stores nearly many tantrums anti-maskers last Spring Summer.

I really hope situation India improves soon. Good luck loved ones.  stayed open Texas hasn‚Äôt much issue.  expected recent wave. waves die suspicion people reluctant get vaccine think that's we're seeing vaccine uptake go rapidly wouldn‚Äôt overproduction, definition. Wtf smh. No, that's why. Someone fact check might people 40 people 80 wasn't.  agree you. idea boomers evil want young people suffer wrong. Comments like reddit push idea. 

There many young people millennials anti-vax push crazy covid stuff called well? 

I understand problems young generations actions past generations, everything world old people bad young people good. supposing hit body tremendous - whether ultraviolet powerful light,"" president said, turning Dr Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response co-ordinator, ""and think said checked going test it.  said, supposing brought light inside body, either skin way. think said going test too. Sounds interesting,"" president continued.  ""And see disinfectant knocks minute. One minute. way something like that, injection inside almost cleaning?  it'd interesting check that.""  head, Mr Trump went on: ""I'm doctor. I'm, like, person good you-know-what."" Explain took 36 hours appetite first dose. Well would look that. fatty downsides. Human stupidity action. people wanting listen authority knowledge issue. People like knowledge excuse. We've already given reaching conservatives want vaccine part. trying get access people essential workers can't get vaccine easily. That's going main priority point we've largely discarded idea conservatives want vaccine getting it. get natural way  got second today. confirm extra xanax set aside day extra tomorrow. Yes could have, 20/20 hindsight have. Gyms invested HEPA machines - like dentist did. soon science saying aerosols put HEPA machine every station.

Instead, get superspreader events like one Hawaii presyptomatic spin instructor infected entire class. spin classes fans set blowing lots air riders, including everything instructor shouts mouth. 10 years violin won‚Äôt make good enough record anything valuable beyond immediate family, unless lessons cost potential value. Might be. Sanofi currently working GSK protein based COVID-19 vaccine. Currently phase 2 trials, soon phase 3 approval end year.

 Even though us know vaccine safe, it‚Äôs hard anxiety hearing anti-vaxers constantly spewing nonsense. Anyone 18 get it.

Densely packed urban areas prioritised. Thank sir! Federal law supremacy situation. That‚Äôs good point. Thank you! saw dankmems subreddit. Thought might Vaccinations freely available everyone, mandated. *suggested* vaccinated folks cannot pass virus others. studies need done science definitively say vaccinated people can't spread disease.  don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going hit 70% vaccinated. rate‚Äôs dropping quickly.

Thanks clarifying!!! think variant must‚Äôve something it. There‚Äôs logical reason didn‚Äôt take hold sooner given India‚Äôs extremely dense population lack sanitation. Seems like original forms virus didn‚Äôt thrive India whatever reasons...maybe climate natural immunity Population. one mutations found hold spread like crazy. scheduled first Moderna shot, prompted CVS website schedule second one. So, scheduled both. people making second appointment? made appointment, canceled skipped it? Okay‚Ä¶ Bruh, even Trumps grandkid president US would never suffered like India right now, US' infrastructure cant even compared India's   3 8 million vaccinated people still following general protection guidelines. stop completely still large community spread could easily increase 10 fold deaths per million vaccines. US could lead 10s thousands fully vaccinated people dying coming year. need continue precautions vaccine reached enough people reduce community spread background levels. think interesting discussion degree people's heath individual's personal responsibility. someone literally stayed home entire pandemic, literally leaving house except visit one family member walk dog masked, think could justify getting vaccine someone quite bit possibly works public-facing job. got vaxxed I'm saying nuance discussion. stay home, think that's good getting vaccinated, frankly. agree little thought needed encourage mandate vaccines. could carrot, stimulus money, better tracking vaccinated (maybe tracked current paper records secure), passport enabling freedoms vaccinated reached 80% vaccinated.  opposed government force-vaccinating anti-vaxxers. Very. also seen ‚Äúcovid related death ‚Äú whatever hell means. Last time check based experience, happen. given time, 1 flight 1 quarantine facility. 

Still, guy picks hotel, different story. According Facebook CBC news comment section? Watch covidiots use fuel 'oppression' narrative. highly doubt that. near 70 million flights 2019. 

the world, USA large interconnected stopped this. 

If italy failed tremendously US, chance. 4 months always worst case scenario. rate we‚Äôre going, weeks whatever recommended interval is. got second Moderna Tuesday, impacts. felt far worse first shot. health data, sure, give less shit TSA get vaccination record. Ahh same! Plus, getting mask let one dimple finally see light again! (Jk, joke.) mostly im glad I‚Äôd able run without feeling really breath mask + get rid foggy glasses I‚Äôm labs. Amazing.  Awesome, lets go guys lets save India. That's beyond negligent. you? experience well. Thank god didnt work today.

First dose fine, mild soreness arm. Woke next day fine.

Second dose (yesterday) started same, soreness built throughout day today completely wiped out. Woke sore everywhere monster headache. mostly bed day.

Luckily soreness vanished throughout day, headache one persistent ones I've ever had. feel like I'll returning normal tomorrow though.  No. Read linked. short term two month trial demonstrating short term efficacy one vaccine. trials far definitely still ongoing. authors trial kindly linked:

I'm week away fully vaccinated. nothing changes Virginia.

I'll show piece paper, wear space suit. win! 70m suffering anxiety phobia, doctor and/or therapist help recover. Panic attacks treated prevented.  did, went sign showed slots available. called county health department kept ringing. patents aren‚Äôt issue, materials make vaccines know right. Like want medical doctor I'm fucking forced get undergrad, pass mcat, attend med school, complete federal licensing requirements, complete residency, complete med school, complete additional federal licensing requirements, complete state licensing requirements, find job. 

Such bullshit. freedom bone hurts thinking it.  Happy give downvote seek vaccine passport mandate would create wildest market forged vaccine passports. see people putting 10x effort getting fake card would take get real one. majority people decide need want vaccine, what's end game? restrictions, relenting letting problem manage itself? even true. want get vaccine, still online classes. can't attend person. see school business can't want keep people safe, that's prerogative. 

By way, hospital worked 2016 require flu shot. get it, option wear face mask work. 

You play society's rules want fully participate. People going want around others likely catch spread virus. Fucking traitors.  Half guys used needles gave first shot without setting appointment second shot?

That's weird. way  wasnt US military many places world would worse off. 
 
Downvote know Im right vaccinated, risk lower risk take flu season. comparing covid flu, covid vaccines really good, we're giving credit for. messaging terrible made people afraid risk. People talking keep wearing masks avoid colds flu! no. need free vaccinated. Take risks. never promised risk free existence. 20% pretty much bang calculate using IFR excess deaths. proper way respond someone anti covid vax? don‚Äôt much research tbh got vaccine guys work trying act like idiot getting bc ‚Äúblood clots‚Äù.  Correct headline weeks ""breakthrough infections alarm scientists!"" previously infected virus natural T-cell immunity long-term effects

Most data I've seen shows prior infections provide fairly strong immune response least several months. I'd say valid argument ""wait see"" tribe. geographically bordering countries priority everyone else. wish case. Unfortunately, plenty people including sub say still need social distancing masks even getting vaccinated. sort mixed messaging extremely harmful effort getting everyone vaccinated. getting vaccine *doesn't* let things wanting do, whats point? Glad I‚Äôm USA': VACCINE System (Vaccinate All, Coax Crows Immunity, Exceptions)

Canada: Sloppy seconds

Mexico: scraps Smallpox animal reservoir, much easier eradicate. Covid like flu seems cross animals back us (for flu, birds pigs, covid guess pangolin, bats, minks?).

Edit: saying covid ""just flu"" anything like that! feels like eleven billion years ago saying people could catch twice controversial statement.  confirm, happen today got first dose. family‚Äôs antivax garbage wound getting brain made super nervous. already hate needles enough, thanks. 

Luckily everyone vaccination site super kind understanding. Hoping don‚Äôt cause scene next appointment.  heard germans travel Russia get **Sputnik V** vaccine  well also support small businesses lives let become decimated. Neither is. solution worry things haven‚Äôt happened yet, read learn much can, listen d00merz.   
I can‚Äôt prove wrong you‚Äôre making prediction future.  
Have good night. It‚Äôs Friday. drink ten people virus infects, opportunities mutate. 

The vast majority mutations either effect actually mal-adaptive, given sheer numbers antivaxxers (several hundred million around world, 100 million US), it‚Äôs practically guarantee given year, beneficial mutation virus occur makes resistant vaccines contagious. (Or both.) already happened several times. several beneficial mutations happened via random mutation due sheer number infected people given time. Nope.

Serious.

If banning flights China xenophobic, better believe banning flights India xenophobic Biological E set make J&amp;J able accept shipments that. real.

Now quote. also heard isn‚Äôt effective ship doses India give raw materials need since India #1 producer AZ vaccine? mean, give help need. heard Redditors India saying capabilities make vaccine quickly in-house. vaccines - rubella component MMR, hepatitis chicken pox - produced way; similar drugs must tested identical cell cultures used clinical trials. government react moral panic episcopate - still little knowledge virology (which likely) know arguments could weaken Bishop Wr√≥bel's phobias, deliberately decided remain silent, hoping would dry itself. 

Many older people, traditionally sensitive teachings Church, already vaccinated Pfizer Moderna, younger generations afraid risk thrombosis (although probability minimal) fixations fundamentalists, deny Astra Johnson vaccinations collectively anyway. checked dozen vaccination points Silesia - ten people, three four agree it! Fake pandemic latest changes vaccination schedule, opening almost comers, decision allow unused doses given anyone 18 years old, government's reaction increasing signals interest vaccinations declining younger age groups lack second dose . 

Although Ministry Health updates statistics daily, showing number vaccinations constantly increasing, say many people immunized long ago still shown interest. 157 thousand April 20, second dose authorized doctors received second dose, first 86% - mean others would sign appeal ""improperly tested vaccines lead gene modification"", affected phobias? medical professions, percentage unvaccinated people even greater, half nurses, midwives pharmacists second dose. first accepted 70 percent. 

From group 16 thousand Laboratory diagnosticians vaccinated first dose 72 percent, second dose 57 percent, although stage ""0"" provided long behind us. Moderate interest also arisen among 60-year-olds, less half five-million-strong representation age group far instilled. Still waiting first injection 1 million 475 thousand. people aged 75+. Apparently, oldest seniors currently best vaccinated population Poland, e-Health Center data shows 3,969,504 referrals issued, 1,389,289 people received first dose second 916,844 people. also even half reached. 

So answer younger age groups? 30- 40-year-olds see many victims covid among peers, perceive pandemic prism restrictions understand relationship degree vaccination society date return relatively normal life. Especially sting still required wear masks respect sanitary rules - loosening restrictions expected achieving herd immunity, i.e. level immunity approx. whole society. 

And going happen? since enthusiasm clearly declining? youngest age groups influenced social media, conspiracy theories buzzing. system constructed way enough hit one anti-vaccine bubble able get quickly - Facebook, Twitter Instagram algorithms perfectly read emotions delinquent caught online offer friends content tailored expectations. reading discussions Internet forums, one confirm belief Bill Gates want depopulate world vaccination gene damage one side effects. 

And even someone believe absurdity, certainly convinced opinion neighbor peer, call temporary pain arm fever two days worst suffering life advise ""experiment."" According sociologist Tomasz Sobierajski, anti-vaccination movements best present pseudoscientific assumptions, based emotions, judgments internal fears way resembles language science. - paradox people oppose scientific achievements try pretend scientists relying false research questionable authorities. also paradox media, often scientists themselves, often defending pseudo-authorities, referring need maintain symmetry freedom speech. Thus, repeated nonsense becomes truthful. spreads like virus vaccine.

At point need realize risks life. Among risks exist everyday, covid post vaccination least worries. Everyone knows Florida lied numbers lmfao really think many people government want pandemic restrictions go long pass much stimulus possible guise 'we cuz pandemic'

Is that? Maybe, doubt main driving factor.

Yeah, blood clots, weird freak reactions non-zero risk. They're pretty damn close zero though.

Here think relative risk. Warning, morbid.

Well, they're quoting Joe Rogan healthy young people already low risk COVID even without vaccine... part strictly wrong.

This agree scan news breakthrough extreme outlier cases anecdotes young people bad COVID outcomes. reason wrong freak rare occurrences damaging vaccination symptoms. go life judging risks rare outcomes tail end.

And that's COVID severity healthy young people - rare, tail-end outcome. people beating ""fear COVID good ackshually"" drum going internalize cognitively errant ethos wake flummoxed 20 years later they've never able feel safe anything they've wasted whole lives. stupid.

If young healthy, extremely unlikely die COVID, go hospital, lifelong damage. Variants not. Misleading people help anyone. Yes, something widely dispersed COVID is, even low-risk tail-end outcome bad outcomes young people could wind higher we'd like aggregate, that's legitimate public health challenge. healthy young person evaluating risks wrong say they're exceedingly low.

I personally weighted threat lockdowns mental health personal security higher risks I'd faced caught COVID, still leapt first vaccine appointment could get like chance hi-five Jimi Hendrix. Why?

1) higher # total vaccinations goes, likely country calm eff down. like able contribute that.

2) chance brought zero (nothing is; see above; actuaries), post-vaccination odds could ever unknowingly transmit COVID someone elevated risk absolutely demolished. public health messaging chosen downplay astounding feat science feel like can't say ""vaccines prevent transmission"" long odds transmission 0.00001%. Eff 'em.

3) friends hate restrictions like do, getting vaccinated emboldens push envelope. feel extra confident crazy things like going run outdoors without mask home state (well, week, finally came back reality).

If every measurable indicator tells ""this pandemic"" goes back normal sticklers still insist safety theater even though COVID threat demonstrably quelled, helps vaccinated. get turn tables people want masks 2026 ask *they* believe science - vaccines.

So wrong wrong now?

Furthermore need evidence make claim. proof = God. one states Biden lost 1%, unfortunately.

there many people ACTIVELY refusing vaccine. mean lazy procrastinating... no... actively protesting vaccines. :( :( :( (sad) don‚Äôt think anyone getting first dose decides don‚Äôt want get second one..? probably fringe case worth putting public effort into. Like isn‚Äôt problem? understand different way, long viral spreading host killing, doesn‚Äôt matter highly lethal. 

People Covid aren‚Äôt dying right away. might even infectious still time die. lot people think Bill Gates put microchips vaccine. completely bonkers.  That's correct.

It's compared unvaccinated person. basically ""if 20 unvaccinated people get it, 1 vaccinated person would get it, else equal"". People avoid vaccines celebrities telling to. People already decided they're getting vaccine they're taking solace someone agreeing also carries fanbase. That‚Äôs secret, cap‚Äô

I‚Äôm always bored confirm - passed 2 minutes getting first shot due low blood pressure. absolutely hate needles guy vaccine appointment said probably worked prior getting shot, afterwards calmed blood pressure fell floor. says vaccinated state, releases 8/1 reopening 8/22 Boston, understand message lost. state essentially decided let rest country open first caution focusing metrics. least vaccinated states opening first, way around.  wtf you? go Regis College panel Tuesday vaccine (and assume fall enrollment). 15 min away Lasell University, really need consider around us done, especially conference. 

I personally I‚Äôm full vaccinated think everyone attending in-person classes vaccinated, unless medical/religious reason (that documented). August latest 2nd doses based deliveries. need worry that.

And even would get it, proper science say long-term protection might even better longer interval.

No need worry would suggest that? got piece paper. true, now, required shots fully FDA approved, covid vaccines aren¬¥t yet position can't understand cost-benefit analysis.

I don‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs thinking solution  Here's one I've thinkin' u/lovememychem since I'm scheduled Moderna shot soon. main thing that's concerning seeming uncertainty long term effects vaccine. tell people get shot suffer many side effects. fact, parents felt none whatsoever first shot Moderna. people keep raising point physically cannot long term studies yet since new. time, I've read RNA studied many many decades shifting vaccines towards mRNA looked since roughly 2004 would safer? far basic knowledge goes, idea mRNA causes temporary production ""dummy"" spike proteins, mRNA degraded (not entirely sure means context) flushed system along spike proteins they've destroyed number hours vaccination. right and, so, would mean likelyhood developing into, say, Pandemrix situation line people develop side effects years later extremely low impossible since ingredients flushed system course roughly day so? info may scrambled since I've gotten bits pieces. people actually distancing? Even bad things footage see show distancing. I‚Äôve India personal space thing imagine bunch people competing vaccine super close. I‚Äôm double jabbed Pfizer certainly anti vaxxer Clearly bad year falling windows Biden used law Trump secure additional large orders Pfizer Moderna course several weeks/months, one first acts sworn in. know precise terms, essentially law allows US executive branch enter contracts good national importance, contracts manufacturer must fulfill order US government fulfilling others. much ""export ban"" typical sense. like, fill orders placed anyone else's. sign Pfizer track fulfill contract begin supplying rest world. sure numbers following wave India breaks work.

So around 1million 1.2 million tests day. 1.5 believe close 2 million tests day. testing numbers terrible.

But hear rural areas 3/4 East Indians live. rural areas getting wrecked Covid wave. arent even capable reporting deaths regions can't give accurate figures.

So likely actual number WAY higher. bet absolute nightmare there. still people believe bullshit cures like taking dip sacred water (in reality dirty water that's full bacteria) , lot people resorted witch doctors black market cures.

I read major car companies India closed shop Oxygen use directed towards crisis. That's basically good thing I've read whole thing.

You can't 1.4 billion people squeezed Covid running wild. need properly educated crisis that's government fails. let people die numbers shocking likely much higher.

India lot trouble world needs help like Brazil millions people catching Covid end monster mutations might fuck whole purpose vaccines.

Just nightmare scenario. Yeah opposite announced already approaching 70% adults getting first shot thank given 8/1 opening date state Labor Day opening Boston. pathetic demoralizing. #1 vaccinations. Fair enough. wash hands touching things public, too. It‚Äôs gloves suggesting excessive. good, surprised. pretty brilliant. Toronto. it‚Äôs likely hotspot pop up.

AND

MS says out-of-state residents welcome vaccine shots . people cannot vaccinated (allergic ingredients vaccine, children, etc..) vaccinated unlikely form antibodies needed form immunity (transplant patients, cancer patients, etc...) simple make be. mean, depends read sentence! pandemic small portion life comparison rest life. go fun came perilously close outcome. re-elected, numbers would continued explode vaccine access would spotty best. lost half million people him. number would continued growing exponentially, uninterested took impact meaningful change. actually think right?

A whole site distanced people getting vaccine superspreader event? seems like anti-vaxxer headline objectively evaluating that. Yep go 4 needles one finally managed penetrate me.. shit sucks one forced anyone get vaccines, know point is. celebrate, rest state vaccinated friends. fucking pirates? much appreciated dont know that. states lot good things going them. first shot, too. could barely put shirt on. 

When got second dose, made sure keep arm moving bit got shot, pain really set in. lot better time around, better range motion.  sense making vaccines training doctors scaleable. takes while. See get sense Good news! It‚Äôs suppository! Yeah, what's cool hook Google wallet. restriction exports beyond contractual agreements Pfizer made production US. amount province getting vaccinated rate going provinces per capita.

If anything glad B.C. done one best jobs covid management. much open low cases almost times. think bad, visit ontario month. sounds like something Hank Hill would say. vaccines gonna go expired used public pointing out, US decided send it. \*HIPAA Everything different right now, normal day need show early work fastpasses hard. ""ropedrop"" one big ride grabbing fastpass another. keep getting fastpasses downtime hit low line length rides/shows. Things like Enchanted Tiki Room Indiana Jone's Adventure good events waiting FP.

Also consider midday naps. Early late lines shorter also keeps hot sun. Ya, I'd assume they're fine find really odd handful universities mandating nobody else yet. I'm assuming people start lose interest get vaccinated. compulsively checking sub thread, thing get bored. Sure, process seems easily quickly scalable. lot people frustrated line thinking, get it. tough flip switch too. gonna fine, gonna fun. Take adjustment pace, let anybody try shame stuff feel comfortable quickly. make sure get live life again, try get back lost.

The worst behind you. one next Saturday! admitting 108k deaths total, really 400k additional covid deaths would mean total toll would nearly quintuple size claimed death toll. China? saying US selfish one. Shoot, even neighbor buddies india. Please note subsequent comment thought we'd better 50% though Incorrect. falling, absolutely consistent since March 15th. climbing, falling (hence, plateaued). Play data graphs yourself. stopped declining ago. everything right?! don‚Äôt travel unvaccinated kid underlying medical problems?! absolutely charged. Metrics need reasonable attainable. think one is. going get 2/3 adults NC get vaccine. Something like 55% 60% reasonable goal. I‚Äôm fully vaxxed lot friends are, state (Oregon) seeing pretty massive spike lately. one hand, wanna celebrate friends vaccine, definitely feels weird things right 99.9999% people going restaurants phone car go there... yes always it. Unless somehow forget youll probably still turn back around go get it. not? Ah ha! See? link EUA, full approval! let get straight, I'm cherry picking defining vaccination ""fully vaccinated"" (where Florida 3% higher)?

I mean, cares ahead 3-4 weeks ago? call everything clear national security threat enough mental gymnastics, that's there's barriers prevent that. military operated fine without vaccine past year, would difficult justify executive order says is. Congress passed law giving military members right deny vaccines EUAs good reason legislation destroyed via executive order.

Full approval likely coming year, that's make mandatory. child isn‚Äôt vaccinated underlying medical problems? parents charged manslaughter.  Coincidentally, today ‚ÄúMax vax‚Äù day. (Don‚Äôt big plans except maybe restaurant meal.) Government done shit job public messaging. 

We don‚Äôt vaccine.

We don‚Äôt fear measles, hepatitis, diseases vaccinated for, good reason. 

The message ‚Äúget vaccine pandemic you‚Äù.

Anyone believes otherwise hypochondriac doesn‚Äôt understand actual risks (or lack of) I'm sure commonplace think handful keep wearing them, something never saw 2020. great! applied :) mean get wrong, Aus, NZ, SK handled well intents purposes islands. 

Let explain; Aus NZ obvious fear (based geographical proximity Asia SARS etc) quickly took far seriously Western hemisphere. Hats clearly worked. 

South Korea well virtually island. bottom peninsula (ocean three sides), worlds militarized border north. Plus (just like Vietnam) healthy degree skepticism anything China says naturally took seriously. 

All-in-all, countries western hemisphere could've done WAAAAY stop covid again, mistrusting China, we're way islands, way globalized aforementioned countries. 

I honestly see America Britain (my two countries) globalized (and Britain insanely densely populated) going fare much better this. Good work! always 50/50 chance completely passing injections, definitely first shot. Second shot went smoothly though. 

Can empathize nerves! proves yet again, viscous New York Times unfairly picking white people. injustice end?!?! /s Got second Pfizer shot today. symptoms...yet. EU. made deals without specifying domestic supply domestic use they‚Äôre lagging behind. least were, sure situation now. Australian here. Yeah nah. Yep, saying vaccines *particular areas* shipped tranches India. win-win far I'm concerned. might enough dolts get vaccinated learned doses shipped there. Utahn here. I'm surprised complete absence Utah universities list.  
  
Sorely disappointed, surprised.  seen pictures vaccine clinics india? distanced people. Like even lines easy put space one another, they're standing pressed other, idea anyone even told try keep kind space other. what's data taking counter pain relievers Pfizer? Girlfriend took ibuprofen ~12 hours second shot chills bad headache really wish world worked like this. I‚Äôm US last week made appointment get vaccine arm less 24 hours, could 3 hours running late something. got good here, glad hear we‚Äôre helping countries too. Darwing thing  disappointing run someone wild thinks like this. Please get vaccine. :( protecting non-vaccinated (which way includes everyone age 16, maybe consider that?). Vaccines 100% effective would want extra simple layer protection crammed metal tube sky. stupid require it, considering original virus variants spread every corner Earth. bunch people sub realize team effort either. say, ""for people get shot, that's problem pandemic rest us"" without considering need hit certain vaccination target end. actually over.  wonder felt safer white dude living LA GA lol Ok, imperialist want summer now!!! That's sound. I‚Äôm saying prior vaccination. We‚Äôre literally learning effective vaccinations are. Believe advances science.   
I also think estimate number people permanent damage this. can‚Äôt know tissue heal yet hasn‚Äôt around long enough yet. Good night. Sadly, know quite Georgians refuse get shots. native Georgian, it‚Äôs quite sad honestly. I'm 23 got mine first week March America. signed family December website opened up. Figuring that's part reason why. Overall can't believe quickly got symptoms. sure isn‚Äôt good‚Ä¶ Might get approved coming weeks Thank saying this. Shots usually bother me, anxiety around vaccines. makes sense why. wrong claim first dose ""offers little De hecho, hace unos d√≠as las autoridades mostraron los resultados de una investigaci√≥n con una muestra de 10,5 millones de personas en la que la efectividad contra la infecci√≥n luego de la primera dosis result√≥ ser de apenas 16 por fact, days ago authorities demonstrated results invenstigation sample 10.5 million people effectiveness infection first done 16 percent.

This contrast first-dose protection infection vaccines, hover around 65-85%, equal protection offered Sinovac's SECOND dose.

I admit read second dose hospitalization rates bit higher remember, though. read articles week ago

Edit: found english source: sure specific mutations, honestly heard variant breaking past vaccines yet.

B117 newer hard say, vaccines focus one variant spike proteins. thing delivers Covid. hopefully we're still good. events getting pushed later dates. Philly made massive pride parade ticketed small event September. Get shots people! would fine planes public transportation sure. Lungs usually fully recover pneumonia. 

COVID scarring appears lot permanent. 

That aside, happen vaccinated Measles, largely (like, 99.9% time) happen haven‚Äôt vaccinated? kids 16 involved? lot people still keep precautions (meeting outside, example) sake unvaccinated kids. jump on, F TSA. get free donut every day rest year. happen. many stupid republicans religious morons NC. ...and concerned good enough science behind vaccines. . Don‚Äôt forget hydrate! Helps sooooo much potential side effects. Thanks getting vax! Jesus Christ comments...   Covax stepped even distribution among countries. already late bilateral deals already on-going. Right makes tad ashamed say I‚Äôm introvert yes introverted like socializing public people like. stupid enough refuse free vaccine subsequently fake security card, see fellow citizens required protect you. virus really needs outpace immune system eradicating sufficient mechanism easy spread people. virus first, eventually cause organ failure death. second, become common popular strain. HIV, takes years kill; primary mechanism spread humans mechanism making humans. Except India. caused harm? opinion, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs best analogy. inside moving car unbuckled never safe, vaccinated person incredibly safe COVID.

The seat belt analogy narrowly applied question whether governments power enact public health mandates.

If insist invoking seat belts least equate vaccines seat belts, masks. official US vaccine card flimsy piece card stock security features whatsoever, identifying feature handwritten name DOB, anyone could fake. [Moderna announced it‚Äôs safe store fridge 3 months understand, want go concert something! :) Los Angeles less 50% white. duh.. thats typical inactivated vaccine rate is.

Inactivated vaccine one oldest vaccine technologies use many disease convid-19. mRNA first widely use covid-19.. Quick question, Pfizer Biontech vaccine efective Indian varient &amp; b.1.1.7 varient ? can‚Äôt speak whole state, live Lane County extreme risk category. Fifty-six percent adults partially vaccinated 40% fully vaccinated. It‚Äôs also home University Oregon, seems source increased cases, especially since 16+ recently eligible vaccine. 17 people county hospitals, it‚Äôs 24 days since last death reported.

At least Lane County restaurants don‚Äôt seem source outbreaks I‚Äôm sure latest restrictions much. vaccine panic. Call is: stupidity. stuff comes every variant, nobody reason scared every new scary name point Stop bring wimp. Use sick day. number still massive underreporting Sucks ass. faith we‚Äôll side end May. It‚Äôll make summer much sweeter. can, yes. 1 20 cases lead pneumonia Hate second Moderna shot light fever day arm hurts 3 days. However, none comparable actually getting COVID please people.. GET SECOND SHOT!!! Measles still cause disability mild cases? though?

That still surprising. Opposite what? Wow Must East.. Im late 30s still haven‚Äôt gotten appointment yet BC. Hmm yes suppose provide info appointment. I‚Äôve wondering could get official record piece paper (which able write name onto). far [We sure data needed. happened well. 16 minutes first shot. Ambulance came that. One scariest days life. EMS Pharmacist told get second shot. (I'm mid 40s). know prior vaccine 3-4 million people got measles every year? Also understanding natural selection works. zero selective pressure virus high degree presymptomatic transmission become less lethal currently is, unless literally running people infect. virus care know anything long term survival. driven natural selection whatever allows continue exist moment, ceases exist, extremely lethal. Viruses likely mainly get less lethal time due immune system memory, plowing population killing enough people selective pressure, least modern times.

With COVID-19, increased transmission rate seems go hand-in-hand severe disease due resulting higher viral loads individuals infected ""stickier"" mutants. Came comments say this. It‚Äôs depressing frustrating we‚Äôre going backwards rest country opening Good luck holdouts. variants transmissible ensure holdouts contribute herd immunity one way another got yellow fever vaccine (stamaril) years ago. reaction *India agrees* countries invested vaccine development got end product first. one stopped poor countries giving pharmaceutical companies money early on. amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Oregon one earliest states see case, response heavy know dealing time. measures worked well stopping spread, default spread increases - though would suggest 300 cases day point mark so. Hospital ICU beds kinda close capacity critically so.

I also expect two-week statistical blip cases trend downwards, we'll see pans out. Lots Tennessee (which isn‚Äôt surprising). That's good prize! accept! Well every day adults get vaccinated, take bigger chunk people transmitting it. city that, handing gift cards, sites open day appointments needed, it‚Äôs available local pharmacies, workplaces offering gift cards, Kristi Kreme giving free donuts year, vax open 16+ month...

And we‚Äôre 50% People getting it. lot people (half coworkers/most friends‚Äô parents) ADAMANTLY getting it. know one person who‚Äôs waiting baby comes days, kind understand (although would‚Äôve made different choice), one bad allergic reactions things wants wait doctor‚Äôs office get safe. hope go it, it‚Äôs guarantee... pregnant friend‚Äôs husband family gotten it, I‚Äôm wary. gonna do? vaccines work them. Nah, already gotten vaccine. that‚Äôs like see Gotta get booster shot Vaccines 100% effective.  Even vaccinated people (and do) get infected. Vaccination works protect everyone people vaccinated.  Checking vaccine status admitting people crowded places, protects everyone places.

Internationally, many countries require various vaccines condition getting visa. Covid vaccine added list required vaccines, people want travel places. nice Right. we're somehow going fully vaccinate another 45% population 2 months? go *just* opened people 40+ neck woods couple weeks ago elderly parents vaccinated two weeks ago. I'm getting vaccine 11 days. honestly expecting happen August seeing slow rollout month ago Personally we're socializing outside still, kids wear masks still -- wear mask additional protection sake solidarity. still fun kids seem care all. wear KN95 KF-94 work standard surgical style mask like nothing all, anyway. started ‚Äúscrew masks lockdowns, thing works vaccines‚Äù ended ‚Äúmeh, I‚Äôll wait see‚Äù. Yep. imagine lot people waiting super easy convenient. Yeah seems silly. Even last year, April higher paranoid levels covid, would feel ok 15 feet outside. I'd run faster time üòâ. 

These days, even think fly public transits (bus/metro) getting lactobacillus express spike protein giving people yogurt sauerkraut something like that? way immunize without getting shot - food.   I'm entirely sure trying say? understand people get vaccine far skip second dose. know, maybe ""if worth worth right"" mentality generally. Oh yeah meant got mid February spring training started lol didnt even touch topics blatantly wrong are. suicides across whole u.s., including california florida, pretending suicides simply wrong. plus, californians worked home throughout whole pandemic, california gained tax revenue florida saw dramatic drop tax revenue. again, nice cherry pick Nope.

Edit: good 3 days doesnt seem like long enough build enough immunity prevent infection. came see anyone else said this. second pfizer shot wednesday. thursday kicking ass, surprised. agree statement ""actually covid 19"" would life threatening.

im glad got second. No, thats‚Äôs load crap. FDA website information EUAs rather private EUA doesn‚Äôt mean trials done ‚Äújust lets start manufacturing earlier‚Äù. means, quote FDA:

‚ÄúUnder EUA, FDA may allow use unapproved medical products, unapproved uses approved medical products emergency diagnose, treat, prevent serious life-threatening diseases conditions certain statutory criteria met, including adequate, approved, available alternatives. Taking consideration input FDA, manufacturers decide whether submit EUA request FDA.‚Äù

According FDA, Covid-19 vaccine trials still ongoing. TSA sending message someone anti-masker want fly mask mandates removed, book travel summer travel season.

Similarly, they're sending message someone cautious COVID uncomfortable booking travel unless mask mandate remains place, saying people book travel summer travel season confidence mask mandate place.

If put stake ground, someone's going book travel August unhappy.

Airlines also make decisions based seasons; changing things midstream middle summer travel season would come lots challenges related staff training, signage, onboard announcements, etc. fact past vaccines typically caused long-term negative side-effects evidence vaccines won‚Äôt either. gives us indication expect, still need evidence demonstrate case new vaccines. 

That‚Äôs particularly true Pfizer Moderna vaccines mRNA vaccines essentially brand new technology. first mRNA vaccines licensed use humans US - don‚Äôt know whether delivery mechanism result long term side effects we‚Äôve never used humans before. It‚Äôs like mRNA harmless delivery mechanism. quick look RNA vaccine Wikipedia page tell mRNA delivery cells cause really serious side effects animal models. haven‚Äôt seen yet vaccines, pretend totally understand know vaccines completely safe long-term disingenuous. think probably safe, honest answer don‚Äôt know.

When people decide take vaccines, guaranteeing exposure something carries unknown risk long-term harm. decide to, less 100% chance catching Covid, also carries risk long term harm (risk depends age pre-existing conditions). actually make risk contracting Covid pretty low careful. people, guarantee exposing unknown risk vaccine may worth protecting already highly effective ways protect from.

I think vaccines look like much better bet risking Covid, don‚Äôt want hide virus indefinitely, that‚Äôs certainly decision would feel comfortable taking away someone else.  vaccines administered figured troops would first mandatory. That's level dumb dude Black Hawk removing back plate. That‚Äôs pathetic, socialism finest. Vaccines option, forced. Golf clap. Feel free come real world realise global hegemony inherently unsustainable tell intellectually honest, appreciate that. Let ask broader question may. notice trend sub skepticism towards anything would warrant caution things worse virus thought before. Good news virus ok upvoted, bad news questionable downvoted. Maybe empathy fatigue, plain optimism, suspicion media‚Äôs profit motive, suspicion fear mongering, help argue open economy, something don‚Äôt understand.

But me, notice continual underestimation virus public overestimation. read article, think ok, evidence two shots better one move on. take face value. Yes, poke holes study, guess question why? felt misled media topic? Okay say means time must mentally ill No. function body virus, newness virus. Plus endemic mean new body. Yup. here. indoor seating restaurants shut today. gist shipment received partially processed Emergent Biosolutions. So, need quality control first make sure safe. Lucky. There‚Äôs people around live NC without masks Anywhere 12-24 hours tend popup. people effects hours, sleep off, feel crappy days, never feel anything normal arm soreness  YEA YOURE RIGHT know what‚Äôs great? You‚Äôre ill keep commenting end time. absolutely would go indoor restaurant yet. data breakthrough encouraging incomplete. don‚Äôt know epidemiologists eating indoors yet. FWIW, attended virtual talk leading epidemiologist recently said go restaurant numbers drop. ""far better education"" there. really. Everyone going different start gaining protection doubt anyone would protection day 2 3 That's public schools. Grinnell private want.   Reading comprehension read want read. hope require masks 0 cases left I'm calling hypocrisy people upset last guy keeping silent Biden. made comment effectiveness trump What? 

It doesn‚Äôt seem understand vaccines work say so. send 5k That's...it? truly think isn‚Äôt weird all? people want get vaccine I‚Äôm buying vaccinated students/staff tickets apple products weekly drawing kinda odd might even go far say suspicious. 

I‚Äôm gonna research vaccine it‚Äôs long term usage (which currently none us know about) get it. informed decision? 

No one knows happen four months - either they've arbitrarily decided four months matter circumstances (should wearing masks 100 cases/day?) they'll evaluating along way (as should) case actually informing anyone anything. insane üòÖ  owe 5k yes want money China exported 200m vaccines already... That's load crap. three approved vaccines 3 phases trails completed them. EUA lets start production earlier. restrictions studies results still I'm aware. officially known B.1.617. 

I'm sure matter people who'll attack Indians whether called IndiaN India variant. point still stands. getting topic - we're discussing issue pushing timelines. I'm certainly defending previous administration saying they're exactly same.

100 days masks *very* similar - never intended finish line, everyone saw assumed would way longer. like ""two weeks slow spread"" ""hold weeks vaccines"" language around restrictions would last. - say four months, people think means six, eight. got lot faith administration, that's fine. people lost faith, kind thing help. NC governor said state hits 60% think mask mandate lifted. really seem much impact. I'm sure immunity levels like outdoors going pretty safe vaccine concerned might great summer feel confident returning normal life, pack schools August newer variants wreak havoc kids?

Welp, God decided time go Ryder truck. 


I mean, sure, walked middle freeway rush hour stood number 4 lane. God truck hitting me. time, y'know? Anti-science views (honest) skepticism, denialism. Skepticism intellectual honesty reasonable falsifiability. Religious faith trains people keep beliefs spite evidence faithful want true. CDC terrible job.

There much simpler ways communicate risks. Permitting something discouraging dumbest confusing approach.

The CDC misstepped every step way.

Conversations political pressure expanding test criteria, recommendations stockpile, minimal uniform safety standards emergency responders, providing quarantine, eviction bans teeth, federal standards, testing wildlife, counting reinfections, allowing hospitals close, overworking health care workers, dumb initial quarantine guidelines, lack funding, refusing early releases nonviolent offenders, ICE imprisonment, etc... 

The Center Disease Control opted controlling disease evidenced number outbreaks policies spread. You‚Äôre obsessed aren‚Äôt ü§£ü§£ vaccine less 100% effective yes infections, hospitalizations, deaths occurred continue amongst fully vaccinated people. surprise there. relevant? have? Let's make 5k took long?!? countries Africa limited health infrastructure cannot possibly deal severe disease typical newer variants. entire continent therefore highly vulnerable newer variants causing havoc Asia South America. Global leaders must collaborate, waive intellectual property rights, share technology, allow support countries manufacture vaccines. go back right now? ""safer"" least I‚Äôve seen ford publicly call federal government stop flights, asking help etc

B.C. handling things they‚Äôre dealing pandemic. 100 days mask wearing need goal, plea Biden Americans worst hit period virus. never said that's needed we'll done mask wearing that.    
   
Different administration absolutely matters totally different messaging. example, last administration's leader took vaccine private instead using opportunity encourage supporters also take vaccine. administration took publicly set example others take vaccine. don‚Äôt think understand ‚Äúconcept‚Äù all. also sound paranoid. know of.

My mistake we‚Äôre 56 year olds today. 2 years relax Database piece paper anyone could forge unable find research would support statement. Neither support opposite.  hospitals aren‚Äôt labeling deaths Covid. phlebotomist one point noticed nervous people hold breath brace themselves, forget breathe after, get overdose adrenaline. would remind nervous patients keep breathing gave something concentrate on. seemed help lot. Lol, much want bet people look like weirdo? challenge technically whether vaccine registration centralized well APIs called verify barcode legit work well.

The challenge legally violate HIPA protections. mean took 3 weeks parents (over 55) even get registered another month get first shot, 7 weeks get second shot. aunts uncles haven‚Äôt luck getting vaccine. parents fortunate. Apparently there‚Äôs shortage second dose one able get them. in-laws parents went 10-15 places found place would give second dose. mom spent 2-3 hours phone 4 days trying get appointment. gonna say, Belgium always comparing number covid deaths surmortality 103% covid death compared surmortality, one country excess üòÅ India 10 times many people living per square mile. can‚Äôt compare two. lot village people similar people medieval Europe. 21st century, might well 1400's Hah, privacy protection. Thats good one!

No be, requiring proof medical treatment violated HIPA can‚Äôt spread unless unvaccinated people live one concentrated area. That‚Äôs herd immunity works. California since least 4/3. We‚Äôre fine. It'd really hard legally vaccines approved EUA. Australian government knows citizens Australian land important overseas. symptoms like?  Happy cake day! Also BC, got AZ jab Tuesday! Hope feeling well. first 24 hours little rough  small bump supply EU would essentially guarantee EU enough fully vaccinate mid July even AstraZeneca J&amp;J doesn‚Äôt deliver anything meaningful. Canada's Texas. Paying people get vaccine offered EUA terrible idea. best could kind requirement incentive vaccination actually gone proper standard approval process. Nice PR ""effort"" without vaccines infrastructures place mass vaccination. impose lockdown right limit spread... create proper infrastructure mass vaccination. 

To vaccinate 1.4 billion takes 5+ months year depending availability vaccine, think ramp fast enough. Meanwhile, without locking down, people getting infected, dying mass virus giant lab mutate variants. Well, mainly implying he‚Äôs racist. good informative article people suggesting shows nytimes unfair white people ridiculous. Please forgive don‚Äôt coddle comfort someone already made racist bias clear. never able get thru cloud propaganda, shame can. deserve it. scares many countries, good job controlling Coronavirus think they've beaten it--just like India first wave. Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Taiwan low vaccination rates. They've let guard down.

They've forgotten reason control virus buy time get vaccinated. countries seem really vulnerable new contagious variants virus. low vaccination rates low rates actually catching Covid, may setting trouble. got covid two doses, word that. hoping arm grow ass time soon Yeah, effect people even forced - using carrot would better, least initially. Leave stick last resort. (Although talk now, doubt go way without trying carrot first. knows though? extremely incompetent.) cost prolonged pandemic continued spread leading new variants. I'm 43 BC got 1st dose AstraZeneca days ago. I'm scheduled 2nd dose til sometime August, 4 months away. mean test ?  trials finish, probably sometime 2023. Y'all take part trial, solid 25% America refuse tho holy shite Considering bad counting people get treatment regular diseases, sounds right. think true isn't. tons opportunities, live age comforts, utilization technology like internet. agree, amazing. 

But, equally times tumultuous, large amounts people held fruits societies labour. want get overtly dramatic, also want ignore realities remedy. think people can't get access decent affordable healthcare amongst backdrop advancements like AI, companies larger countries, much lavish luxury ... can't help feel we've robbed.

I'm fortunate position relation +85% world, also recognize that.  difficult assess study without pictures fainting people vs pictures non-fainting people. Compared vaccines, yes. Better nothing. better vaccines market. comparable one J&amp;J Vaccine, yet Sinovac hold advantage single-dose vaccine. Currently living strong economy hot property market. Short sharp lockdowns outbreaks nobody allowed internationally without 14 day hotel quarantine negative tests. I‚Äôm enjoying mask free, covid free, economically socially prosperous life. also enjoy fact people around upheld end social contract didn‚Äôt kill debilitate economy long term. brainer. Progression. beginning, thing starting spread. Now, virus pretty much everywhere. going rapidly multiply out. Plus, changes behavior contributing factor. 

If conditions rapid spread, virus spread rapidly. play devil's advocate here. surprisingly low transmission COVID airplane. surprisingly good ventilation plane. really need worry airport. take false hope lies $500 alex. earlier April filed think FDA released public info deliberations like date final hearing yet. Yeah, AZ claims released full data set Jan 2021 showing 62% effectiveness pooled results standard dose trials CI 41% 75%. I.e falls within margin error Sinovac results. AZ results citing blasted FDA I'll wait final data released. mention different country that's say quite bit closer country variants spreading like wild (Brazil). green mile üòÅ  No. Clearly vaccines widely accepted/administered numbers drop stay dropped know unlikely eventuality - I‚Äôm fragile believe science/reality always make room fact virus may mutate something evades vaccines. time goes transmission lowers unlikely. rate doesn‚Äôt matter.

In long term makes things worse. articles months pointing risks P1 mutation reduces vaccine efficacy. Here's recent reputable article came across. really afraid shots? India sounds like disaster, going on? nun die likely variant country. Oh get life, worry yourself. gave answer, get it. vividly remember choice vaccinated anthrax smallpox. ‚Äúwait see‚Äù people going drag suffering.

That's Hispanic black friends, sadly. figure USA good now, need take it. legitimately know side effects virus. UK variant unique indian variant ? May now? Well changes vaccinated... think entire state waiting get shot? least done can, enough people can, much better shot this.

No one trying punish people lock downs. We're trying keep everyone safe. Ask India really safe looks like. There's lot things proud about, Canada's handling vaccine really one.

The mental gymnastics increasingly becoming creative. Starbucks! üëÄ even testing capacity verify it. Pfizer shipments alone May equal total vaccinations given April. Add extra Moderna, Janssen, Astra additional approvals Canada well way. Wait, US allowing anyone get vaccine get then, matter age health problems?

Kind screws foreign students who's countries age. there‚Äôs still people believe virus doesn‚Äôt exist. HOLY SHIT UK strategy best strategy.

We're fundamentally creatures logic, incredibly dangerous assume individuals act logically situations, manage one area lives. Would say country would reach herd immunity faster restrictions all? ton deaths though.. statement developer, also linked twitter account, maybe missed it. quotas different. Canada administered first jabs, Germany second jabs, number doses nearly identical. Germany older population, might another factor takes longer vaccinate older age brackets. Damn. 67% efficacy less 95% efficacy, simply denial? vote; people probably voting Canada worst world vaccines. turns pretty bad. good US, UK, Israel. ahead EU , developed countries. pretty fine.

J&amp;J eventually reaches efficacy takes bit longer. So, I've trying parse meaning study rather reporting it, questions.

1. freely acknowledge representative sampling important useful tool, study's sample size 51 people really enough justify kind sweeping claims lot reporting making?

2. 51 people healthcare workers, presumably heightened risk infection compared many general population. applicable results outside context?

3. lower levels resistance reported that: low**er**, non-existent. think anyone would dispute receiving doses going produce effective response, would certainly seem prior infection operates much way. actually fair say single dose leaves people ""vulnerable"" fact actually increases protection much two doses infection plus dose? vulnerability relative, all.

4. nobody among 51 people evaluated study actually ended getting infected course period surveyed, weight place claims inadequacy first dose within study nobody got infected, within vast petri dish UK's broader roll-out effectiveness halting spread B.1.1.7 variant particular seems impossible dispute? far ready believe difference found two cohorts among 51 people insignificant incomplete predominant single-dose approach whole adult British population succeeded series millions flukes.

I doubt elements understand well should, that's I'm asking. need science specialists also trained producing accurate plain-language summaries never greater now, gulf reporting data study study important reason why. We've burned before, much choice make inquiries too. Still confirmed hopefully, desperately need help Mexico!  extreme fear needles, hospitals, doctors offices general (including dentist).

Remember vaccines still EUA, legally requiring employee get probably little tricky.

This think many schools (like K-12, colleges) would open last year, school system require teachers get vaccine. get 40 hours PTO year. Using 8 hours side effects second dose tough pill swallow blame chose use hours family vacation. lotta people shittier situations I'm well.

There exceptions age roll out, people high-outbreak areas get first dose AstraZeneca, they're aged 40 up. close 100%? feel ordering show people it‚Äôs safe. Hesitating encourages them. giving vaccines like Australia blocking all. news 1 transport Italy AZ met contract. US ridiculously selfhious this, that's nature you. Always same. America First, right?   Vancouver population density 5500 making 5th density populated city North America. metro Vancouver area, people BC live, density 900. BC whole density 5.

So yeah population density pretty terrible metric.  convince vaccine hestitant people? yearly average pretty normal otherwise wouldnt accounting low influenza seasons abnormalities etc

Demographic changes rapid, 10 years long period them. example, life expectancy Russia grew 68 years 2010 73 years 2019. Averaging 10 years negates change.

Also, Russia pretty complex [demographic huge ""echoes"" WWII every 20-30 years. Currently, relatively small ""war generation"" dying out, contributing lower overall mortality compared 10 years ago. another 10 years, total yearly deaths Russia expected grow significantly, much bigger ""post-war generation"" begin provide main dont data march+

We actually do, [March Rosstat published yesterday. want calculations, add another ~30k 340k number.

The 400k+ number comes using linear approximation last years instead averaging, meant take account large-scale demographic trends I've mentioned. Anyways, numbers different estimates.

This truly calamity. hope country gets 101 fever chills, intense nausea anytime stood up. worth downplay bad get. Ain't nobody working shape. weird-ass thing say  seems me, data, older people risk COVID folks highest uptake vaccine.

I could wrong though. Thank explanation, worrying yet informative. üò£üëç People stop assuming vaccines simply shield COVID either block reaching 100% nothing. binary.

It's like actually studying test. COVID test. study, likely going pass.  


Get vaccinated. Congratulations. part problem.  freedom depend others getting vaccine. got mine, restrict based someone else assessing risk deciding get one.  strict rules, mostly based past influenza outbreaks. much reference point follow, two severe outbreak coronavirus contemporary history (2003 SARS MERS), even spread limited observable mutation also difficult come by.

Lastly, common misconception infectious diseases supposed become lesser deadly overtime. long disease able continue spread effectively, matter deadly is. (Example: HIV, Smallpoxs etc)

The virus causes COVID 19, little special case, since much longer incubation period much earlier infectious period, allows disease time spread, incapacitate host. cancel ""deadlier variants lose out"", applicable. Nah, people still screaming matter many us vaccinated. almost centralized federal guidance vaccine deployment well silencing CDC scientists good impact. 

Can't believe working better promising something around corner, downplaying severity situation, casting doubts science basically telling state whatever hell want Look us, Indians. government started exporting vaccines brownie points, stopped between. would say, getting country back line much better, help first. 

We'll need help, better help comes fully functional tension free nation ‚ÄúI worried science taken account drive policy. know jurisdiction stops. scientists provide evidence, policy making job government.‚Äù live UK feel like apart masks things slowly getting back normal terms restrictions people still worried getting covid want go  Could price death suffering too?  employee sick due COVID (with COVID really contagious unvaccinated people could lose multiple people) operations stop. replace resource employees could cost 1.5 hourly rate work. work doesn‚Äôt get done revenue stream stops. However, costs consistent dip reserves take short term loans pay expenses, raises costs. Additionally, go onto short term disability impacts costs benefit ratio. leads higher operating costs. 

If service level decreased don‚Äôt people customers don‚Äôt feel safe sickly looking staff move onto another company. kills revenue stream.

This one reasons Ebola become worldwide pandemic mostly local/regional problem. also don‚Äôt know long term consequences COVID. Maybe get infection fine, 1, 2, 10 years later leads massive degenerative disease.

Dr. Stacey Sensor says 18-year-old son, high school senior, ‚Äúone healthiest people know.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe works every single day five o‚Äôclock morning,‚Äù said Sensor, Gaylord physician. ‚ÄúHe takes supplements. eats healthy. got COVID gym.

‚ÄúHe quite sick eight days,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm telling doesn‚Äôt matter supplements take, age is. ... Even healthiest individual, still get still become sick effects quite time.‚Äù

It‚Äôs cautionary tale, said, people see COVID-19 serious health threat elderly much benign illness younger, healthier people.

In fact, Michigan‚Äôs current coronavirus surge turned assumption head: Last week, state averaging hospital admissions COVID patients 40 patients age 80 older. former 78 day compared 50 latter, according data Michigan Department Health Human Services.

The biggest reason demographic shift, experts say: difference vaccination rates.

About 74% Michigan residents age 70 older gotten least one dose vaccine, two-thirds fully vaccinated. 16 49, numbers 36% gotten one dose 23% fully immunized; vaccine authorized children 16.

Also contributing surge virus among young people spread variants contagious lethal; tendency many younger adults disregard COVID-19 guidelines, fact schools reopened.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely become young person disease now, probably haven‚Äôt vaccinated they‚Äôve likely older folks go about, close contact others go gatherings,‚Äù said Dr. Mark Hamed, physician medical director Huron, Lapeer, Sanilac, Tuscola, Alcona, Iosco, Ogemaw, Oscoda counties.

The numbers bear out. first year pandemic, Michigan residents age 60 older accounted 23% cases; it‚Äôs 13%. Conversely, age 20 accounted 13% cases first 12 months pandemic; it‚Äôs 25%.

The chart shows April case numbers age group compared monthly average March 2021, well compared December 2020 fall theory, that‚Äôs actually welcomed shift standpoint old age easily biggest risk factor hospitalized dying COVID-19.

But experts taken aback spike COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults children.

Compared height fall surge early December, Michigan‚Äôs average daily hospitalization admissions COVID-19 33% age 18 29, 58% thirty-somethings 64% 40s. Meanwhile, hospitalizations age 80 older 60% compared like, take seeing shift one two decades,‚Äù said Dr. Joel Fishbain, infectious disease specialist Beaumont Hospital Grosse Pointe. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got 20-year-olds getting admitted, 30-year-olds requiring oxygen, never saw before, needing much treatment give them. We‚Äôve got 40- 50-year-olds ending ventilators.‚Äù

Pediatric cases also up. Last week, state averaging almost 10 hospital admissions day among pediatric patients COVID-19, triple number mid-February.

Deaths among children younger adults spiked, too.

In first 13 months pandemic, six deaths among children ages 10 19. past month, four deaths reported. Another 65 deaths reported April 20- 30-somethings, quadruple monthly average.

The chart compares April deaths monthly average March 2021 well confirmed COVID deaths December. numbers show deaths among seniors plummeted April compared December result vaccinations coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people age hospitalizations aren‚Äôt concern.

While COVID patients age 50 ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get severely ill, growing number people long-haul COVID symptoms,‚Äù said Dr. Liam Sullivan, infectious disease specialists Spectrum Health Grand Rapids. ‚ÄúThey problems smelling, taste, concentration, memory, fatigue, night sweats.

‚ÄúSo even though mild illness first time around, they‚Äôre still dealing things month months later, that‚Äôs something want deal you‚Äôre 25 35,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúOf course, don‚Äôt want deal age, especially you‚Äôre prime life.‚Äù

And women, research growing dangers COVID-19 pregnancy. Dr. Kurt Wharton, Oakland County obstetrician, currently four pregnant patients intensive care units battling COVID-19.

All four ‚Äúfighting lives,‚Äù said Wharton, works Beaumont Hospital Royal Oak.

While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain rare, Wharton others say evidence growing coronavirus pregnancy put woman much higher risk preterm birth, preeclampsia admission ICU and/or intubation, especially woman pre-existing conditions high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes heart disease.

Evidence growing COVID-19 vaccines pregnancy: Virus dangerous; shots not

Doctors offer several theories younger people getting significantly ill COVID-19 current surge.

One spread variants, contagious lethal. variants ‚Äústickier,‚Äù Hamed said, means takes less exposure make someone severely ill even symptomatic.

Wharton noted pattern happened 1918 influenza pandemic. initial surge spring 1918 primarily impacted elderly babies. virus mutated came roaring back fall 1918, primary victims surge younger adults.

‚ÄúHistory repeating itself,‚Äù Wharton said.

Another issue, suggests Hamed others: unvaccinated people gathering groups without masks. increases risk exposure higher viral load, associated severe disease.

‚ÄúThe best mask wear, less viral load inhale,‚Äù Wharton said.

On top that, many schools reopened children younger adults particular resuming pre-pandemic social lives.

‚ÄúYou see it,‚Äù Wharton said. ‚ÄúYounger people groups again, walking sidewalks, shopping, going restaurants bars together. think they‚Äôre invulnerable.‚Äù

The good news COVID-19 vaccinations proven ‚Äúwildly successful‚Äù significantly reducing chances getting virus spreading others, Sullivan said. vaccinations blunted spread virus among senior citizens, spread COVID among younger adults stymied immunization shots.

Vaccination programs ‚Äúreally need target younger people right now,‚Äù Sensor said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre ones getting sick. We‚Äôve done really good job vaccinating older population, really move forward get pandemic, really need younger people step plate get vaccine protect protect families.‚Äù  I‚Äôve heard situation people still need get second dose. makes think ignorant? looked status border crossings US Canada. 
As expected still ban case. 
I really hoped US‚Äô ever increasing vaccination rate + downward trend cases Canada would allow free travel country. 
As fully vaccinated (yeah faked), hoped could help visit Canada. 
It doesn‚Äôt seem case though. 
I‚Äôll hope US CA improve coming months summer‚Äôs end countries much control. 

Seeing good news like article fills hope. Welcome reddit. like tell always sizeable population stupid ignorant-it used easier hear them. 

Don‚Äôt forget Galileo almost murdered government saying earth revolved around sun.  Worldmeter projecting less 300 deaths first week June less 100 deaths US first week July... anyone buying still getting Awfully close 1000 days incredibly ignorant children deserve raised incompetent fools. time. Woke work feeling effects, stood home 6pm feeling ‚Äúnormal‚Äù said original posting, severity lower vaccinated. Thus, mortality rate low considered safe. However, still get illness. 

The concern employees vaccinated. people vaccinated. people get sick, drive operating costs. reason companies looking require people receive vaccinations. I've seen data covid get dose 1 vaccine, effectively 2 doses.

Does effect work way around? someone gets dose 1, weeks later gets mild case covid suppressed first dose, protected way around? too. would love see story vaccines going nothing 3 billion year less!

It's amazing good things humans it! Noise-canceling headphones blessing blocking white airplane noise. ears love it. Pure Michigan July. First Pfizer dose made tired, second one bedridden fever, chills, body aches 30 hours. colleague covid November minimal side effects first dose either. gotten second yet. joke man going work light fever cold sweats work days worth getting fully vaccinated covid-19 Kumbh Mela happens every 12 years last one 2010 one originally supposed 2022. Due astrology transit Jupiter pulled date back year 2021. not?   , Zz  hidden secret seems ""herd immunity"" (I know singular point) starts 60%(+/- some) people vaccine + natural immunity.

The US TON natural immunity, something like 25-30%.

If assume low end even split natural immunity people getting vaccine vs dont, 45% people vaxxed, another 13.75% people would natural immunity, total immunity 58.75%

But also even split. natural immunity probably LESS likely get vaccine (plus kids CANT get vaccine). wouldnt shocking US hits 45% vax rate close 60% mark.

The US currently ~43.5%. course huge gap highest areas lowest areas, US deal localized outbreaks part, US starting see affects herd immunity. I'm 41 ended losing lot weight last year. Even though risk still higher 24 BMI, feel much better last February. amazing believe something can't see, feel, smell, taste, touch, hear prove, believe something SEE effects, FEEL effects, lose SMELL TASTE to, TOUCH it, HEAR effects get vaccinated, PROVEN exist. way around?! CDC authority impose restrictions, issue recommendations. Actually setting restrictions state local governments relaxed around nation states tying restrictions like mask use vaccination rates. quickly reach herd immunity rate? Overall hospitalizations going Michigan too.    NJ walk megasites.

You go time second Won‚Äôt massive overproduction eventually? mean numbers hear different manufacturers quite big. long refrigerator trucks good anyone link side effect stories happens get covid get 2nd shot? heard thing since seeing thread seems recommended get 2nd dose get covid between? LOL  There's bizarre use word ""discriminate"" people seem use mean ""As long technically possible group experience X, matter infrequently X happens relative groups proportion population, X discriminate group characteristic."" absurd. might well say liquor stores discriminate based over/under 21 status sometimes underage people able get alcohol.

I'd also like see people stop using average age hospitalization going evidence increased danger young adults. entire reason vaccinated elderly population soon possible keep old people needing hospitalized. average age hospitalization better going down. increase absolute number young adults hospitalized explained rise cases age groups area relevant data. UK, there's lot shitty world leaders there. [should expected ...pmc marching on. Cases exponential decay continue keep going down. would trust experts one who‚Äôve found vaccines continue effective variants likelihood variant developing completely evades vaccines natural immunity isn‚Äôt high short term. 

So cases go down. might small surges places aren‚Äôt heavily vaccinated haven‚Äôt significant amounts prior infection, nationally we‚Äôre track containment. saying good reason, staffing issues? Immunity prior infection weaker much transient vaccination. may help, vaccination outright superior. honestly going believe China fewer deaths North Macedonia?

I don‚Äôt doubt average job this... India bad...

We talking India 4x cases yesterday China reported Would rather international travel country avoiding outbreak outbreak bad one wants come visit? know joke. Pfizer 1st 2nd shot exactly same, there‚Äôs really difference. find hard believe - made show throwing vial front you?

Furthermore, pfizer one thrown EOD vial unfinished. rest store another day. Look, need least 3 generations worth data. can't show grandchild vaccinated person long-term health issues consider vaccine highly experimental dangerous. happen friend mine also work public health. long 10 day quarantine period improved symptoms get second dose. period, would wise delay second dose. Currently sounds like window two months first dose get second dose Great share recipe everyone gotten mixed messages since beginning... makes sense. awful, thats humans work. Thats needed team started local municipalities went way president. needed year ago. this. Define ""normal"".

I think July 1st life United States less like 2019, mask requirements areas. willing get cant due parents views. interesting see mega lockdown launched despite situation screaming someone ""pull emergency brake"".

It eerie see covid rip country.

This saddest story pandemic far.  total population size doesn‚Äôt matter you‚Äôre talking spread. deleted half people country tomorrow part India haven‚Äôt yet infected. would still 400,000 new cases. makes difference it‚Äôs spread throughout whole country. timeline sort matches assertion.
Ofc whole story, contrast country wannabe-Trump PM 25m people deal got 5%, using AZ vax went all-in with, completely abandoning quarantine us overseas.

At least Modi halfway competent (though crisis seems). Even Trump reasonably capable compared utter goose charge Australia. January 1st, made (America-specific) COVID-19 predictions posted May 1st:
1.	The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved starting administered.
2.	The vaccine available anyone wants one, provided local pharmacy.
3.	2 million Americans vaccinated per day.
4.	Restrictions (mask use, distancing, etc.) beginning loosened up. Large events (concerts, sports games, etc.) strict limits attendance (25% capacity proof vaccination required, mask use). Smaller gatherings permitted. stores still require masks order enter. Restaurants, bars, movie theaters largely open across country, 25% 50% capacity limits.

So do?

Well starters looks like Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved United States, right away that‚Äôs one prediction get right.
As others? think pretty damn good job.

The vaccine currently available anyone wants one, provided local pharmacy.

The 7-day rolling average vaccine doses administered per day 2.6 million, little 2 million prediction. However, January 1st assumption would still ramping number doses administered per day May 1st, winding down.

And don‚Äôt know level restrictions every municipality across country, think it‚Äôs fair say prediction restrictions still effect point. Large gatherings (such sports games) allowed, capacity restrictions states. Small gatherings allowed across entire country. far I‚Äôm aware, stores still require masks worn order entry. restaurants, bars, movie theaters open across country.

Lastly, predictions made July July 1st:
1.	Restaurants, bars, movie theaters back 100% capacity across country.
2.	Parties in-person gatherings allowed.
3.	There restrictions in-country travel. International travel somewhat restricted however, travel developing countries sufficiently vaccinated population discouraged prohibited.
4.	Large events (such sports games, concerts, festivals) allowed, limited 50% capacity, need show proof vaccination attend them. However, mask usage largely required.
5.	It‚Äôs somewhat common see mask use public, masking requirements stores largely dropped. main exception public transportation (such subways), masks still required.
6.	The Novavax vaccine approved starting administered.
7.	4 million Americans vaccinated per day.

When comes predictions, four points made would like revise.

The first one point #2. far I‚Äôm aware, currently restrictions private parties in-person gatherings anywhere United States, meaning prediction mine several months. Even notoriously risk-averse CDC allowed fully vaccinated people different households congregate indoors without masks distancing.

The second one point #4. longer believe need show proof vaccination attend large events. think idea vaccine passport around international travel, can‚Äôt say domestic events. Ultimately, think nature American public means idea never really gain traction outside limited circumstances.

I also believe large events (such sports games) open 100% capacity across country. NYC announcing anticipated ‚Äú100% re-opening‚Äù July 1st, think it‚Äôs safe say country rapidly moving direction losing capacity limits venues.

The third point point #6. think it‚Äôs clear that, much like Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, Novavax vaccine getting approved United States.
The fourth point point #7. increased number Americans set vaccinated May 1st, revising estimate July 1st. time July 1st rolls around every person wants vaccinated fully vaccinated, people somewhat skeptical vaccines ultimately decide receive them. means July 1st bulk people aren‚Äôt vaccinated people cannot vaccinated (such children), people steadfastly vaccination. Ultimately, would expect pace around half million vaccine doses administered day July 1st. may seem like bad news first glance, it‚Äôs actually great news. means people believed going vaccinated June/July mostly vaccinated April/May. Stacey Sensor says 18-year-old son, high school senior, ‚Äúone healthiest people works every single day five o‚Äôclock morning,‚Äù said Sensor, Gaylord physician. ‚ÄúHe takes supplements. eats healthy. got COVID gym.

Hey, Joe Rogan says young people need get vaccinated...

I hate idiot. Bullhorn bad ideas. He's Nick Survivor Side effects reported vaccine weeks injection. mRNA substances completely expelled body days. mRNA vaccines target dendritic cells uptake, cells survive week most. There's plausible mechanism harm months years later present body anymore neither cells uptook mRNA. likely fraction real numbers.

Experts estimated total cases much half billion people infected covid.

## Summary

### Background

Obesity major risk factor adverse outcomes infection SARS-CoV-2. aimed examine association, including interactions demographic behavioural characteristics, type 2 diabetes, health conditions.

### Methods

In prospective, community-based, cohort study, used de-identified patient-level data QResearch database general practices England, UK. extracted data patients aged 20 years older registered practice eligible inclusion QResearch database Jan 24, 2020 (date first recorded infection UK) April 30, 2020, available data BMI. Data extracted included demographic, clinical, clinical values linked Public Health England's database positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, death certificates Office National Statistics. Outcomes, proxy measure severe COVID-19, admission hospital, admission intensive care unit (ICU), death due COVID-19. used Cox proportional hazard models estimate risk severe COVID-19, sequentially adjusting demographic characteristics, behavioural factors, comorbidities.

### Findings

Among 6‚Äâ910‚Äâ695 eligible individuals (mean BMI 26¬∑78 kg/m2 \[SD 5¬∑59\]), 13‚Äâ503 (0¬∑20%) admitted hospital, 1601 (0¬∑02%) ICU, 5479 (0¬∑08%) died positive test SARS-CoV-2. found J-shaped associations BMI admission hospital due COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio \[HR\] per kg/m2 nadir BMI 23 kg/m2 1¬∑05 \[95% CI 1¬∑05‚Äì1¬∑05\]) death (1¬∑04 \[1¬∑04‚Äì1¬∑05\]), linear association across whole BMI range ICU admission (1¬∑10 \[1¬∑09‚Äì1¬∑10\]). found significant interaction BMI age ethnicity, higher HR per kg/m2 BMI 23 kg/m2 younger people (adjusted HR per kg/m2 BMI 23 kg/m2 hospital admission 1¬∑09 \[95% CI 1¬∑08‚Äì1¬∑10\] 20‚Äì39 years age group *vs* 80‚Äì100 years group 1¬∑01 \[1¬∑00‚Äì1¬∑02\]) Black people White people (1¬∑07 \[1¬∑06‚Äì1¬∑08\] *vs* 1¬∑04 \[1¬∑04‚Äì1¬∑05\]). risk admission hospital ICU due COVID-19 associated unit increase BMI slightly lower people type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease without morbidities.

### Interpretation

At BMI 23 kg/m2, found linear increase risk severe COVID-19 leading admission hospital death, linear increase admission ICU across whole BMI range, attributable excess risks related diseases. relative risk due increasing BMI particularly notable people younger 40 years Black ethnicity. didn‚Äôt need scientists say that. knew.  1. well analyzed treated. There‚Äôs treatment guidelines 

2. feel pain, altered mental status, shortness breath, seek medical help. TSA precheck game changer. 

I‚Äôm Still furious go hoops avoid absolute lunacy (like taking shoes), it‚Äôs world asked gave government unlimited ‚Äúemergency‚Äù powers. 

I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve learned lessons though! Exponential decay time We‚Äôve also never coronavirus pandemic contagious bunch MAGAts comprise 30% population vow never get vaccinated. 

There finite number variants occur. virus, like viruses, keep mutating. It‚Äôs gonna stop. already variants resistant vaccines. They‚Äôre going stop mutating vaccine resistant. 

Boosters won‚Äôt work virus mutated enough vaccines ineffective. Sounds like vaccines work. Sort auspicious.

Gotta roll sleeve! I‚Äôm happy guys shit show till recently (in Ontario least). wedding August Canada, hopefully attend. family US already vaccinated, I‚Äôm waiting final shot two weeks. Pfizer US starting ship Mexico Canada, too. Plenty space nursing homes (baseless) facebook posts circulating saying things like ‚Äúbeing around people vaccine mess fertility vaccinated people shed spike proteins‚Äù 

The whole thing complete misinformation, since virus doesn‚Äôt affect fertility people received it, let alone people around someone did. honestly clue originated, posts anecdotal best, completely fabricated. American counterpart ""good news"" I'm india, unfortunately canikissyourshoulder said exactly what's happening whenever get vaccine stock (at least mumbai, live)
Every day living nightmare here. Perhaps English. random lady internet saw saying changing women‚Äôs menstrual cycles ‚Äòsomething‚Äô transmitted vaxxed unvaxxed. I‚Äôm guessing means virus shedding.

Random lady runs private school, Miami Centner Academy, banned teachers getting vaccinated. hilariously false. India multiple country wide lockdowns.  Yes makes sense, barely anybody 30 gets sick serious COVID symptoms, unless already compromised. lie use tactics pretend need healthy, even though data says DONT need healthy.

I think reaction natural common ita important shame people reaction, instead address fear like done here. headline misleading. delete comment stating that? speak food mouth high risk still maintain precautions like staying outside, alright. Right... Based one comment user know everything gym generalize whole country. US consist Florida. weird hear different everyone‚Äôs experiences vaccines covid. sick March 2020, shots left barely sore arm. 

It also seems helped super high heart rate exercising (I could easily get 200 bpm little effort) super low heart rate rest (down 39 bpm randomly) Covid left with. heart rate doesn‚Äôt hit 180 runs heart rate bottoms around 47 bpm. think might meant predecessor, did, put diplomatically, make serious errors handling early response. good bad news. Bruh, teach pharmacology. very, well aware clinical trials process. might look definition ""emergency use authorization."" ideal? No. actually remarkably well-researched vaccine that's development decade passed safety efficacy trials better shrugging ""meh"" accepting loads preventable death disability? can't believe people still arguing answer question no. true, (admittedly selfishly) mainly calling *personal* finish line. I've strictly adherent guidelines past year+, knowing I'll leniency actually go public &amp; visit vaccinated friends person great. 

Also, AFAIK trials still keeping participants (and also probably trials ongoing) determine long immunity seems last. I've read/heard, boosters likely going necessity going forward. completely fine me--it's likely time immunity starts wane, they'll better picture handle sort thing. nervous too! rough year change everybody, I've fully vaccinated month so, I've started going theaters again, seeing family friends vaccinated, eating indoors, even planning small vacation, etc! look this: past year intense lockdown getting fully vaccinated, I've done everything could mitigate risk catching spreading high risk within household. now, even though still take many precautions, feel slightly okay things! We've made far, we'll get part well! sounds miserable. mean wasn‚Äôt looking get sick nice get house least week, state colleges universities requiring vaccine return fall  like they're seeing Rogan Musk expertise comment medicine epidemiology talking asses might something. occurred clinical trial would've halted immediately vaccination site health clinic.

Friends said mass vax sites telling may hour line showed got shot immediately. 100% agree saying. seems younger people old willing.  

You can't use breakthrough numbers time delays.

For example, lets say fully vaccinated, I'm person protected vaccine. lets say eventually catch COVID 3 months now. Well, next 3 months would counting someone protected vaccine reality I'm make breakthrough numbers 3 months.

The breakthrough numbers would eventually trend towards trial numbers given enough time. that's fine - 95% REALLY good. I‚Äôm 35, good health amazing immune system...

I don‚Äôt care spread others...

So yeah, need incentive... like India virus arrived ‚Äúbulletproof‚Äù feeling young people vanishing. fake story   mention ethical aspect, literally giving people without telling possible fatal risk. That's highly unethical also one main reasons stopped.

Moreover ""paper"" fails mention doses AZ low anyway supply far bigger issue 2 weeks stop. guess could also write paper low supply AZ killed hundres people. Congratulations realizing comments like actual problem here... Wasn‚Äôt Michigan one states voted tie hands governor let disease run wild? Death thing I'm afraid regarding covid. Long/lingering Covid something I'm keen experiencing. former coworker mine--a healthy, fit mid 30's male--contracted Covid December. Last spoke (around March), still issues fatigue, said would highs lows terms energy levels day-by-day. 

I sure people focus hard death rate. Viral infections still rather serious even excluding lethality, even serious younger people, I'd rather unknowingly catch disease &amp; spread immune-compromised people (who typically able even vaccinated first place). dumb all. fun Unfortunately don‚Äôt source this, hopefully someone astute find it, friend mine PhD immunology posted Facebook back longest time *ever* vaccine dose appearance novel adverse event 6 weeks. immuno-comprised individual received live attenuated smallpox virus. wrote serious adverse events occur vaccine administration, occur within weeks. isn‚Äôt something like 20 years now, people going start problems. It‚Äôs completely reasonable concern someone have, hundreds millions people receiving vaccines months now, they‚Äôre well-vetted they‚Äôre safe. Applied :) make headline sound negative? ""Michigan hospitalizing **fewer** people 80 people 40"".

People read articles news agency ought stop misleading titles. dad see different doctor. That's one airlines, and:

[Sichuan Airlines resume cargo flights India amid COVID-19 wondering India accept China offers delivering resources military aircrafts India.  felt better second one first one. think may articles coming pretty protected first jab.

Yes, think we're agreeing overall point post here. single fan events went last summer vaccine, yet anecdotally never problems can't find events linked anybody else problems either. 

Convincing others like need COVID vaccine safely attend sporting events safely went last summer unvaccinated going work. get vaccinated dumb fucks know long term effects new viral infection either. Looking pretty grim. ""Mild"" infections still really bad, ask Ted Nugget. People lose sense smell long time, that's ""mild"". Nobody lost sense smell vaccine. 

An uncontrolled infection much destructive vaccine could ever possibly be, vaccine makes body like virus does. 

If new vaccine technology could change DNA, we'd curing diseases like sickle cell anemia, metabolic disorders, baldness it. Pharma companies would make much money vaccines. 

""I think antivaxxers removed country. Seriously. Gone. promote dangerous antisocial ideas like actually kill people, gone. make room reasonable people, antivaxxers."" (if make disingenuous arguments vaccines, we, yes still better people them) 

These tested safe vaccines history. ""pause"" proves safe cautious CDC vaccines. **And ""Triple mutant"" variant India** got first dose Pfizer, cold sore (from cinnamon allergy) RN gave shot like, ‚Äúraise hand feel unwell.‚Äù

So great news you‚Äôre vaccinated looking assurance vaccines really effect, pretty terrible news you‚Äôre kid Michigan isn‚Äôt able get vaccinated much higher risk virus reminder everyone often anxiety irrational. difficult impossible many people rationalize way anxiety. Telling people X event chance occurring often help anxious people feel comfortable. talking anxious person vaccines, dismissing anxiety condescendingly telling driving car dangerous helpful. 

I'm well aware almost non-existent risk serious side effects COVID vaccines. soon I'm able, get shots. change days shots I'll extremely anxious terrified serious side effects. know rational, anxiety rational thing. many people part human.

Actually people long Covid clearly improved condition getting Yes have, reason YET successful. Even today still TRIALS. FDA push out, fact, APPROVED them. 

Please research!! Asking tests etc costs lot. great plan great insurance. 1. anyone bachelor's engineering (or field science?) evaluate vaccine safety efficacy shared skills across science disciplines?
2. anyone bachelor's engineering accurately interpret raw data study entirely separate field? 
3. Nobody said lack data sufficient basis; everyone agrees lack data, also one defining ""long enough"" case. 
4.

A 28 year old man risk factors (my characteristics), example, still 2.6% chance hospitalized. Obviously, still low odds altogether, good deal higher would guessed given fact somebody profile still almost certain survive COVID.

The way currently run mean that's *should* be. even charitable; best personal interest Western countries tackle pandemic globally coordinated manner. Hoarding supplies create severe disparities early far collective coordinated effort. Fauci criticized this, copying sources listed late January, 16% world's population access 60% vaccine supply time.  countries/regions like US, Canada, UK, EU preordered enough vaccine cover 150% 500% populations.  long-term, hoarding mean poorest countries get fully vaccinated 2023. actually guest recently talking tardigrades foods leading issues babies everyone. expert research good episode Sure.

If felt scared reading headline perhaps consider getting vaccinated lower chances statistic. others fit demographic. might ""fearful"" headline others truthful one one hopefully educate younger people get vaccinated even think age means COVID health threat. new study involving researchers University Oxford Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention (China CDC) examined change overall cause-specific death rates three months COVID-19 outbreak early 2020. results published today China, emergence COVID-19 first reported mid-December 2019 Wuhan city, Hubei province. Coinciding January 2020 festivities Chinese Lunar New Year, virus spread rapidly across China. led national lockdown 23 January 2020, continued early study analysed data official Chinese death registries period 1 January ‚Äì 31 March 2020, compared period previous five years. researchers performed separate analyses Wuhan city, epicentre pandemic, elsewhere main findings overall death rate Wuhan city 56% higher would normally expected (1147 v 735 per 100,000). mainly due eightfold increase deaths pneumonia, COVID-19 related.
Deaths certain diseases also increased modestly Wuhan city, including cardiovascular disease (29% increase: 408 v 316 per 100,000) diabetes (83% increase: 46 v 25 per 100,000).
Overall, Wuhan city, 6000 additional deaths (4573 caused pneumonia) January-March 2020 compared expected rate based previous five years. Excess deaths significantly greater central districts (compared suburban districts), adults 70 years old, higher men women.
Outside Wuhan city, overall death rate increase, fact slightly lower expected (675 v 715 per 100,000). due fewer deaths non-COVID-19 related pneumonia (47% reduction), chronic respiratory diseases (18% reduction), road traffic incidents (23% reduction), coincided closely lockdown.

It appears China exception common knowledge among epidemiologists swift reaction, strict lock downs, contact tracing, PPE usage effective preventing deaths SARS-CoV-2. Yeah know anecdotal vary person. wife headache swollen arm. 

Still, ‚Äúi couldn‚Äôt get bed days‚Äù better covid ventilators. lot comments saying vaccines work. course do. see many people arguing that. argue, need. people know getting saying need it. Lol lost? responding always say conveniently forget countries still had, have, plenty restrictions place. UK particular strict lockdown winter, definitely helped bring cases. open everything way US states course, vaccines helping lot. 40% sort magic number reopen everything zero restrictions. Given vaccine passed trials serious issue would've picked then, serious issues occur picked trials must occur low rate. 


Particularly older age groups risk benefit always going favour. Therefore suspending use vaccine controversial would lead avoidable deaths. 


Many countries similarly well respected scientists suspend use AZ vaccine older age groups whilst serious effect investigated, UK prime example. Precisely benefits outweighed risks huge margin eldest age groups. 


I'm saying approach better 'dumb take' put it. Plenty experts time said benefits oldest age groups always outweighed risks suspension gone ahead. public health ethical dilemma good arguments either side, certainly 'pro-science'. you‚Äôre saying vulnerable vaccinated? people aren‚Äôt really affected Covid thats vulnerable utmost concern.

People getting Pfizer vaccine started getting final shot last week.

I‚Äôll agree Michigan made super easy get shot started, it‚Äôs like people drop they‚Äôre get vaccinated. Plus there‚Äôs probably good number people who‚Äôd rather go somewhere official drive Costco bulk savings shot. It‚Äôs option don‚Äôt see issue great I‚Äôm willing bet primarily time thing.

I‚Äôm getting upset numbers end May tbh. I‚Äôm going suggest everyone wait see pans out. Absolutely guaranteed shot administration numbers going Bell curve we‚Äôre still beginning I‚Äôm 27. friends fully vaxxed. Please calm down, boomer. natural selection. There'll always mutations. ones see making news ones survived able spread better mutation provided advantage rest. Deaths lag new cases month compare two latest peaks.

Whether variants changes behavior something else, covid currently affecting younger people worse ways even bad surge. Fox News proven people mass consume opinion based media fact. 

There two possibilities, either Joe Rogan know people mass believe him, doesn't. know people believe him, culpable stop knowingly harm. know people believe thinks people aware things he's saying true, what's goal saying things? speaks context educating informing people, make sense believe that's doing. So, point governor Brown realize there‚Äôs point attempting protect unvaccinated? true Florida. children‚Äôs right health.

I'm glad mom vaccinated safer, worry children. Yep found history:  boomers? crazy young people probably would said crazy shit.

Their president insane, actually power.

Joe Rogan told young people get it, think boomer. Lol. conversation reopening plans certain states vs. Israel California's numbers cases deaths per million almost identical Texas Florida massively less restrictions. Usually places well crisis try recall governor handling.  wake extreme crisis, think they'd get act together. sure he's incompetent intrinsically evil, here's English subtitles Modi put speaking doctor. highlights:

Modi doctor claiming even though 2nd wave intense, recovery rate faster mortality rate lower. mutations reason worry normal viruses change like way people change clothes everyday. He's promoting treatments like steroids, remdesivir, heparin (blood thinner) injections. He's also claiming necessary supplies available like ventilators oxygen. He's proclaiming India access world's best treatments, India better Europe US recovery rate.

I thought Trump evil buffoon US, kind chest-thumping lack honesty incredible me. many people making major life choices reading exaggerations, conspiracies freakouts next door. ‚ÄúMy cousin cletus knows guy saw someone Walmart said...‚Äù chance link study? would love read :) It‚Äôs already Michigan. 100% agree.

I know strictly anecdotal yeah, there's cases India strain effecting young people pretty severely too. Lagging indicator. fully protected two weeks second dose.

Right, something like 95%. guidance CDC basically: ""If get Pfizer/Moderna, must isolate 6 weeks reach 95%, good everyone! take J&amp;J, fine 2 weeks 50% protection. Nothing confusing here!""

Basically, standard responsibility higher people get Pfizer/Moderna shot, ridiculous. flu kills approximately 30k per year, averages 100 per day. ratio 7 less 10, means they're order magnitude. part's math. 

Also, calling lull disingenuous, since every indication continue decrease. Stop fear mongering, vaccines working happened first shot. Fortunately (?) history panic attacks knew happening able use calming techniques. 

I wouldn‚Äôt wish anxiety panic attacks anyone it‚Äôs hard use rational part brain calm down. Especially attack isn‚Äôt caused normal trigger way feels different you‚Äôve experienced past. 

For second shot asked partner drive appointment helped lot. Republicans told us going kill old infirm, matter! may dumb question, deaths U.S staying stubbornly high? They‚Äôve practically hit wall seven day average. don‚Äôt understand vast majority at-risk folks vaccinated. deaths reached time low yet? Who‚Äôs dying nearly 65+ vaccinated?

I‚Äôm feeling frustrated this. think it‚Äôs don‚Äôt understand, deaths seem play big role return normal. prove point especially since didn‚Äôt make distinction vaccinated first comment. referring vaccinated people, realize vast difference Israel‚Äôs green pass system states opening zero restrictions vaccinated unvaccinated people. One groups still catch spread covid like wildfire, it‚Äôs vaccinated ones. Yeah mean we‚Äôve regular Illnesses worse short term side effects. people terrified now? colleges/universities ton work address vaccine hesitancy. professors classmates stated comfortable taking vaccine hoping classes stay Zoom next semester. part, program doable Zoom. However, fields like science medical fields, Zoom class suffice. exemptions college announced medical exemptions religious exemptions. 

One friends engineering program requires person instruction school also requires vaccination. happy comfortable getting vaccine still feels new fact gotten sick COVID all. thing could tell getting protection via COVID gamble point. controversy Hungary they're opening giving people 1 dose vaccine.

Haha no, turned 40. would sad!  can‚Äôt trust them, there‚Äôs real reason doubt numbers opinion. can‚Äôt verify unfortunately independent media reporting. Ok, according World Data, cases. can‚Äôt predict many cases go unreported India, work data access. saying isnt 100% returning 2nd dose? sounds way logical global pandemic need get control hopefully vaccines yea youre making total jump logic lol didnt explain leads people thinking natural immunity matters Keep mind majority right winged conservative type assume virus fake. didnt get vaccinated Using logic. Well, yeah, that's kind counties work right? make much sense draw lines different restriction levels *within* counties... Remember, late March/early April, cases went bit plateaued falling quickly. Give time. got shot arm hurt like crazy. assumed felt like going die would classify unwell. arm felt pretty unwell lol  Ah, thanks. much info keep straight me. Jesus Christ yes does. 

Literally look up. 

It‚Äôs well known mild cases result lung scarring like, 5-10% cases. can‚Äôt Latin American get better vaccines? Serious question. price?  Yeah, kinda said want lotto tickets, lol. Serious question: I‚Äôm fully vaccinated since early March. I‚Äôve sore throat feeling meh last days. get tested?  Jesus Christ doesn‚Äôt Big big yikes. Source that?  lot physicians offices don‚Äôt infrastructure (ultra cold freezers) store mRNA vaccine. one knows four months looks like. Pretending do, making statements like this, makes people feel like nothing makes difference. responded once, that's what's issue here. 

People feeling like nothing makes difference demotivating things like vaccines, bad everyone. 

If cases kept falling rate past two weeks, we'd zero cases five weeks now. Claiming government anyone else knows things look like even two months, let alone four, insane.   Yup. Polio TB among others exploding world stupid people everywhere bodyswerve vaccines. ‚Äú....but effective variants well‚Äù

For now. won‚Äôt remain case long. Mutations add up. mutates, resistant even boosters worthwhile. right now, it‚Äôs outpacing vaccine roll-out. We‚Äôll develop new vaccines variants take months testing they‚Äôre rolled out. then, virus mutated enough reduce efficacy well, they‚Äôll ineffective long that. 

‚ÄúVaccines even work SARS‚Äù

Since when? read that? Oregon large populations weird leftist hippies right-wingers. 

Both groups likely buy anti-vaxx propaganda different reasons. 800 oxygen concentrators already sent Monday, [shared sub 3 days India entered chat üí¨ I'm saying we've hit 50% we're going start climbing slower slower. wait reopen wait-and-see people anti-vax Karens. pass chance get vaccinated, that's risk assume. Case counts likely flatline low soon like Israel. Time get back life usual. Unhealthy eating habits contagious, I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôll call straw man, too. vaccine export ban policy. Loans related vaccine contracts.  Yes, that's correct must fully licensed order mandate. exceptions misunderstanding people seem COVID far edge gradient would need evolve become less lethal keep spreading. Presymptomatic spread occur days infected generally takes long, long time kill people (in viral terms). Moderate resistance mean escape ability evade body‚Äôs cell mediated responses Multiple people sub denying it. person responded turned conspiracy nut look responses.

I‚Äôd perfectly happy get enough people vaccinated incentives hope there‚Äôs even rewards people get shot. think West Virginia‚Äôs approach great hope works. hoard mean ""paid for,"" yeah. India's problem take care home exporting production. would anyone travel deadly pandemic didn‚Äôt to? here! first AWFUL, like, worst shot EVER gotten. think guy straight skewered nerve something hurt bad. Second one, tensed scared barely felt it. glory Hilarious PiS finally something rational *(after claiming virus retreat - safe elders - vote droves)* *Because it‚Äôs already happening.*

Look around. 

B.1.617, 501.v2, B.1.17. contagious outright resistant vaccines. 

It‚Äôs already happening. gonna stop? It‚Äôs like antivaxxers suddenly change mind. I‚Äôd bet Id imagine depends go, places go places need run errands groceries, haven‚Äôt ‚Äúout‚Äù restaurants popular places long time covid. 

I‚Äôm sure go popular places activities, downtown, international drive, etc you‚Äôll see mix two far often. Yeah mean pro-vax anyone - shots right - compared friends coworkers city I'm slower side vaccinate checked CVS times day (instead constantly) drive half hour away instead hour away Also, let's honest, things could get bad Mexico America would suffer. Helping Mexico also helps US. worry much, good decision take it. Yes might feel sick 1 day (I did), come stronger. data speeks itself. 1 sick day definitely better chronic loss smell etc.
Best luck! vaccines better others, effective variants well. Vaccines even work SARS, there's indication coronavirus mutate quickly enough evade them. 

Worst case resistant variant show up, booster made matter months, vaccine figured out. You‚Äôd surprised much world behind living conditions education even today. Heck visited Italy 15 years ago didn‚Äôt even refrigeration local grocery store, things spoiled quickly. that‚Äôs Italy, supposed 1st world country. imagine everyone India received two free N95 masks. way. one lying here. easily verifiable fact covid vaccine free United States. 3 issues 

First: cases dependent variable. You‚Äôre asking people make connection getting vaccinated reduce cases. sounds obvious, it‚Äôs obvious them. 

Second, covid probably seasonal. low vaccination level, exponentially grows seasons without extraordinary measures. high vaccination level, doesn‚Äôt grow season. somewhere between, probably grows Winter shrinks Summer like flu. Tying cases means hit vaccination rate protects us might get hit another wave Winter. 

Third, last thing want encourage people get tested covid hurt chances reopening. TBH, think far rational average person wait-and-see group....

As depressing counter-example: know 60-year old vaccine-wait-and-seer bunch preexisting health conditions, needs air-travel quite bit virus state - WV - it‚Äôs running rampant high schools majority 16. It‚Äôs awful. likely case stuck date likely end lifting bit sooner. 45% people 18 yet receive first dose though, relevant since lot population young therefore ineligible. 45% prioritizing getting vaccinated isn‚Äôt great, it‚Äôs lot less bleak 60% country prioritizing vaccinations. 

I‚Äôd imagine kids % roughly track 18 % eligible get vaccinated can‚Äôt imagine parents getting caring kids do. Omg would straight fun tho let's fucking go wish effective Pfizer stereotype poor quality products ‚Äúmade China‚Äù needs go away. Unfortunately, data doesn‚Äôt lie. easier skip paywalled articles. Sometimes people copy text comment. Yep. US military goes way back. current level FDA approval scrutiny dates back 1960s. Meanwhile, TSA like ""Everyone must wear masks summer regardless vaccination status.""  Yeah, like thought flying couldn‚Äôt get worse People seem upset obvious. NC, always thought ""non maskers non vaxxers"" false inaccurate fear mongering. Sure, there's overlap, smaller think. People hate different reasons.

Anti vaxxers afraid vaccines ""killing messing up"" definitely afraid masks since they're cloth - fact many wear they're afraid dying.

Those hate wearing masks, hand, really 'threatened' - really hate inconvenience point gets them, understandable time, WANT over. thing might feel threatened they're exposed crazies entertain idea masks 'permanent', hearing time time, even bullshit, makes want resist that. case, can't really blame them. hearing 2020 go 2022. anyway, none really consistent issue going get shot. 'wear' vaccine everywhere get every morning impact everyday life, couple pricks that's it. 'anti mask' reasons would take heartbeat knowing way out. 81 percent teams good percentage.  know that? would loved fly wall witness process. truly incredible.  soon 2 weeks 2nd shot I'm going restaurant bar something. I'm itching maskless shit. It‚Äôs like nobody getting shot-still millions day. It‚Äôs gonna longer tail. Tons places gonna start requiring too, it‚Äôll pain ass vaccinated US open far Canada. Still happy Canada US? thing is, already like 4 weeks since widely available NC. giving another 10 weeks would insane. amongst first offered, allowed decline fully approved yet. 

Many declining, variety reasons, think leadership expected happen. anti vaxxers military declining, NY Times whole story many young enlisted declined simply actually choice once. One day daily discussion thread sub 100 posts quietly disappear. sub go back hub covid retrospective articles articles covid third world. vaccines take years takes long gather interpret data. data covid vaccine we've vaccine approval.

Well it‚Äôs available anyone 16 yet. half adults gotten least one dose  theyve steady decline since dissolution ussr I, yes. suspect Russian media covering official numbers. go various COVID-19 statistics sites, also show official statistics. course still wearing masks reach herd immunity. ignore happens. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Airlines going absolute _last_ place see mask mandates lifted. Since want debate whether ""arbitrary"", I'll bite explanation isn't: passengers close quarters enclosed metal tube hours end, soon likely international visitors areas higher COVID-19 spread mixed aircraft, too. Research repeatedly demonstrated COVID spread onboard aircraft, many documented cases places actually recording data.

IIRC, policy also applies ground-based mass transit, ventilation significantly worse.

The reason policy extended still needed, current conditions make clear needed least end summer. We'll rapidly lifting restrictions last months, one one last go - that's supported evidence science. legal perspective, universities open significantly liability requiring vaccine not. CDC guidelines release handle covid certain situations. Individual states interpret guidelines release set guidelines universities follow. university following protocols, zero liability outbreaks. 

On hand, require vaccine attend someone negative reaction vaccine, much likely held liable. 

Is right? course not, there's lot wrong current legal system. don‚Äôt see understand it‚Äôs team effort. bizarre. Wish world worked together like time.  Eating unhealthy isn‚Äôt contagious. So, no. disagree. Throw another straw man me, though. ""its made china must bad"" lol tired kinda achy next day second dose. pretty doable. also skeptical centuries-long practices requiring ships quarantine offshore month prevent spread infectious disease?

Lockdowns literally thing. Curious, mRNA approved public use past? husband opportunity travel back home US EU 10 days detour work related travel, decided get J&amp;J vaccine. first choice- due long hold AZ vaccine short time US felt best option us can't full efficacy start enjoying things lockdown started! Thank you, appreciate that! didn‚Äôt realize kids 10, definitely helps know lot people hesitant they've read lots anecdotal reports reactions second shot. worth noting vast majority people, symptoms essentially like bad hangover: headache fatigue sore arm. 
 Use excuse take day off, watch Netflix, enjoy new virus-fighting superpowers. tied tax incentive stimulus check ‚Äî everyone get it. #2, ever wide release mrna vaccine year Covid? Legitimately curious, I‚Äôm unaware ever happening. Come Wenatchee... 5% appointments next week booked I'm well aware process full FDA approval. close friends VRBPAC COVID-19 vaccine. It‚Äôs literally plastered every news network Canada right now. Frontpage, headline, prime time news. planet live on? Dont forget put mask go bed. Enjoy lockdown dont leave immediate living area you‚Äôll get fined lmao. far, indications masks social distancing made obsolete. fully vaccinated Fauci running around two masks overly cautious CDC indicate masks social distance continue, despite vaccinations. Haven‚Äôt kept Russia. many deaths admitting to? Yeah, know mean, time meet halfway whatever. long get it.

Pick battles. takes sway let doctor jab them, fine, that's doable. that, go back whatever rock live under. proably wait 2022 resume licking doorknobs lol. fully support bc think people little choices. always benevolent leaders think best! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Part company based India, group chats teams depressing right now. gotten point HR step help workers family/friends doctors hospital visits government incompetent. ridiculous scary. talking nonsense, help help. know done stuff, like example, US sending [20 million AZ India. work IT, company financial sector. Big, nearly big JPMC. don‚Äôt see anyone asking ""campaign"" would convince get vaccine today sufficient data demonstrate safety efficacy injections long form.

How long talking here...? Great. problem don‚Äôt database. already got 1st, would skip 2nd? That's like running marathon, getting 1/2 mile stretch finish line, going nah fuck I'm good. That's dumb hell. IANAL private institutions like businesses. make rules. I'm saying arbitrary - one knows yet. well could be, though, make okay predictable. 

When say airlines going trust policy going stay place, clear nothing set stone. might keep four months, might - company relying point would pretty dumb. undoubtedly already made decisions plans happen rule repealed, there's reason believe they'll much forewarning (they extremely little masks required, negative test required, countries opening closing borders, etc).

Keeping policy place longer needed *absolutely* big deal, said leads apathy. matter change anything? say someone who's fully vaccinated, also knows people refusing exactly reason. wish reality, is, refusing face hurts us all.  getting voted much. Take upvote That's fucked upüòê Ihme model real number 14 million recall.

Insane. 

That model projected actual peak occurred days ago, testing catching up, hopefully things get better here. Lawrence Appleton. Artsy school. could use pep talk first social event year. 

BBQ friend‚Äôs house families. known well long time trust everyone reasonably responsible. 

As far know adults vaccinated, none kids since they‚Äôre young. planning kids wear masks, don‚Äôt think anyone else is. 

My brain tells it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôve spent last 13 months avoiding exact situation flipping switch proving difficult. Viruses lot easier cancer. others least phase 2 trials years. Pandemics fast track results efficacy. I'm pretty sure antivaxxer ignores facts. multipolar systems soooo stable We‚Äôll easily 60%+ end May. Remember goal mostly done bullshit July 4th.  hate sound like broken record, convince people fence get vaccinated: drop new normal bullshit. Stop get vaccinated continue wear masks social distance. know plenty people say ""why get vaccinated nothing going change? Since keep I'm already doing, I'll pass. vaccines must work great, anyway."" try coercion route vaccine passports, probably create headaches would worth. (Besides, vaccine passports already rendered redundant Israel)? Unless one takes J&amp;J, fully vaxxed takes 5-6 weeks first shot. populous states opened 16+ April 6 19th, everyone chance. Likely mid June. US looking implement travel ban India. India already done it. need ton, milliliter. Oh come on, get narrative bubble. There‚Äôs bullshittery going what‚Äôs trustable number what‚Äôs comes immunity infection it‚Äôs simply don‚Äôt clear cut number long immunity recovery lasts, effective is. top that, people gotten infected recovered infected even months later. really don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs wild card. grievance wearing mask, it‚Äôs want things like used ya know wrong. 

Hospitalizations across country fallen cliff last week two. 

This thing almost over.  point setting policies affect entire industry, advance notice appreciated valued. easier keep harmless policy around little longer abundance caution keep everyone guessing short term extensions.

Given TSA explicitly announced today mask requirements stick around four months, yes, expect mask requirements stick around four months. Reasonable people differ whether decision 'arbitrary', _predictable_, everyone use knowledge plan travel summer accordingly. know uneducated indigenous tribes whose entire way life gone? Well... Ballet Desmond? Enjoy ever-increasing erosion freedoms, whatever ""it's good case"" reasons come help sleep night. broke record today, 400k infected according wordometer far. comes who's injection, exactly needle's going in. deftly trained doctor administering needle, needle going spot relatively nerve endings feels completely different nurse intern jabbing area lot nerves. saying women men get treated way, women are. happened 1/6 nothing this. possible. FDA ‚Äòauthorized emergency use‚Äô treatments cannot made mandatory agency USA. It‚Äôs law. Also, mRNA treatments vaccines, gene therapies. Even FDA categorizes 70 Someone thread said they‚Äôre 18 got two weeks ago total, addition stuff already scheduled?

Right it‚Äôs planned bit 2m week: far, U.S. northern southern look hell lot like first 2 graphs Hope-Simpson graph: Mental health anxiety real issues, affect anyone. seem saying could case CDC must wrong, counter-factual. may meant well, initial post deserves downvoted simple anti-vax propaganda. clearly since literally happening dude. No. areas younger age groups (with medical conditions/essential work) fully vaccinated yet even got dose one first day eligible, there's nowhere US anyone 16+ eligible get it. case Oregon, schools open kids eligible get vaccine. wouldn‚Äôt blame kids quite yet uptick cases. It‚Äôs combination people lax without masks friends family, immunity higher case count earlier pandemic. suspect we‚Äôll seeing school outbreaks next coming weeks. Lucky you. I'm still waiting get first. Hope guys vote idiots out.

I can‚Äôt imagine anyone would think imposing lockdowns vaccinated groups good idea politically. Ontario moved 55+ today, you‚Äôre far off. Donkey! ? plans distribution allocation numbers can‚Äôt say 100%, don‚Äôt believe so. think it‚Äôs wide open everywhere.  passed first shot. simple bout syncope. I‚Äôve happen getting blood drawn too. 

It‚Äôs actually common. risk low, mean people switch emotional effects past year. may take time people ""unlearn"" behaviors kept us safe since early 2020. People return normal pace, that's ok. reported side effects worse second shot. Maybe people wanna deal it? got first shot 2 days ago felt pretty crappy yesterday. I'm personally dreading second one. =/ I‚Äôm fat felt like antibodies working like mofo. Idk works like lol wow immune system started putting WORK. Well, businesses refusing allow unvaccinated patrons may work too. show one country actually trying help trying get brownie points sending aid. ...sure, not? Maybe so. What‚Äôs point, ask? government still wants wear mask indoors. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see benefits,‚Äù said Mrs. Fletcher, couple waited see family doctor.

I feel like using excuse excuse take interesting seeing pop maybe CDC take notice

lol kidding wants flights stopped pretend issue flip flopping snd endless partial leakdowns basis science. üòÇjust stay canton, farmington, troy good. advanced degree naturopathic medicine 

o . Yeah bottle advil room says adults children 12+ take dosage 12 take doctor recommendation. Genuine question: still areas US vaccines restricted older age groups? (I fortunate live state pretty rapid rollout age groups‚ÄîI think don‚Äôt ton retirees here.) think comparison done harm good? sign up. Can't imagine get everyone shot hope so. bunch waiting lists. safe one vaccines halted little one causes like 168% increase people passing out. Yeah safe. Two family members mine covid November actually felt worse second moderna shot covid, though one asymptomatic covid sore arm would count ‚Äúfeeling worse‚Äù case technically. headache mild fever lasted half day so, vaccine still worth it. still think people already covid require one shot I‚Äôm scientist professional I‚Äôm someone read way many covid related studies past year. [More severe COVID would expect mutations greater lethality selected for.

This also happened HIV, 1918 influenza, 2003 swine flu. Perhaps norm, thing talking without new variant order remain dominant 

A new variant generally starts single infection. ""remain dominant"", million-person-high hill climb become dominant first place. Yeah, sounds familiar. teach. school open person learning since late fall, even first two months school year virtual, required teach campus rather home. real reason administration doesn‚Äôt trust us work unless breathing necks. heard Belgian facility produces 100 million per month, Marburg. know bigger optimized since operating longer. Delapharm plant coming online EUs monthly vaccine production much 230 million doses per month. BioNTech.


I think factory producing ahead schedule. USA also exporting Pfizer vaccines places previously recieved supply EU think another announcement Early delivery significant size may coming... Sure, (or didn't) need phone get restaurant. De rien, nous t'aimons aussi, canada! intense part article me. Like, understand kind insistence pet, even child, seeing grown ass adult fills dread. Thanks :)  I'd like see 2+ years data.

No one credible field immunology agrees this. vaccine cause long term effects noticeable within 2 months. vaccine cause long term effects 2 years taking it. I've called weird before, things lot less mainstream mask. Shut go get vaccination.  Yeah tbh kind crying. phobia bad, really nice conversation doctor. asked day, things going, anything fun events happening life etc gave sense personability able relax. kind man patient enough deal haha. Also smiling talking life bit, think helped atmosphere. start calling ""fuck around find out"" people instead. Injecting bleach good laymans description anti-biotic I've heard. would bet numbers higher new cases deaths. things get chaotic, becomes difficult keep data check. happens people die home? enough resources perform autopsies confirm cause death? guess isn‚Äôt happening.  Good job! got first shot today I‚Äôm also terrified needles. professional administering shot super quick tiny jab. worried might get really pale lightheaded right happens sometimes get poked needle, well. One down.. one go..  brave fuck, homie. It‚Äôs hard push that. experience getting fear anxiety go situation like that. to, like, talk jumping in! it‚Äôs scary every second. edited comment. almost year. Pfizer started clinical trials volunteers May 2020 (looks like first week May).

Sources: One coworkers got married building house. made time. Another one bought house. time. We're also busy work. people living dying based restrictions get slowly time. keep reminding register everything work scheduling get distracted. Yeah, see could confusing.

I want add 2 weeks ago, literal pizza party least 40 people kitchen operating dinner shift. I'm talking servers, new trainees, everybody.

Like people breaking slices whole shebang.

Yet, we're required wear masks work. hate hypocrisy. That‚Äôs quite correct. link established one vaccine deployed abroad couple markets.

The CDC concerned deep dive whether vaccines caused effects. not.   believe designating vaccines loan intended way bypass contractual restrictions vaccine manufacturers reselling donating. Mind you, vaccines much like chewing equipment chewing gum - used, want back.  thank Trump operation warp speed. 

i also thank Biden effective distribution upholding Trump's america first policy. 

We need partisan this.  Well right laypeople certainly think going go long Disney would closed 13 months... least didn't. Vaccinated adults help keep kids safe too. pretty cautious kids wear masks they're around friends started play dates again. feel comfortable it. want sense normalcy feel like reasonable risk. i‚Äôm vaccinated, don‚Äôt see point required prove i‚Äôm vaccinated get plane wear mask. there‚Äôs benefit than... wasting time lol. run headlong vaccine passport resistance. case, vaccine card received vaccinations trivially falsified. Without nationwide database vaccine recipients, caution probably best course.

And yes, people assholes forge documents freedoms - case freedom endanger others. Good. Yeah hubby said ""I'm proud you. big girl now.""

But deserve sarcasm since bit get tetanus (it really date). accident, also put face chest. think general, Canadians higher vaccine enthusiasm Americans. We're dealing country provinces vaccine enthusiastic New England. trust Alberta. probably think Bill Gates injects 5G towers people's arms something. Albertans think Wyoming state aspire be. I'm tired people reddit telling lies Oh sure, time actually implemented. proactive instead waiting cases rise threshold locking could stopped. would taken lot support government clearly something US interested Vaccine providers: want pandemic end, right?

Vaccine doubters: Yes.

Vaccine providers: want stop wearing masks go back normal, right?

Vaccine doubters: Yes!

Vaccine providers: solution!

Vaccine doubters: know...

Vaccine providers: free! proven work.

Vaccine doubters: Yeah, think I'm going pass...

Vaccine providers: FREE! PROVEN work! thought wanted pandemic end!

Vaccine doubters: Yeah, want end. take literal solution end pandemic reasons.

I can't people anymore lol. literally given solution end pandemic, want take it? like asking free, unlimited chocolate someone give chocolate world saying ""no thanks."" even bother asking then? share preexisting conditions? Yeah certain point normal resume. Straight up. I'm read cross gd border guys, hurry get vaccinated already! Nothing 100% risk free. thanks highly effective vaccines, possibility getting sick covid reduced minuscule probability. certain point it‚Äôs time start living way live inherent unlikely risks face every single day. Oh didn‚Äôt know anything that. That‚Äôs wild! lockdowns eradicating virus lmfao. Lockdowns prevent massive spread otherwise unknown disease. thus preventing collapse healthcare hospital system. 

I can't believe prevailing thought america. ""I got Phizzerr"" posts goodbyes. know it.  Yeah guess don‚Äôt see India vaccinating 10x 300k+ daily cases. aren‚Äôt exactly place known government capable orchestrating much anything reasonable, accessible fashion India one largest manufacturers vaccines know. Back March stopped exporting them. need raw materials ramp production in-country remember correctly. forced can't things vaccinated do. go college 3 years sudden require vaccine ""forced"" get graduate. could dropout school try transfer credits end day get vaccinated graduate. Nobody holding forcing you, forced ways 



It's like saying vaccinated renew drivers license. Well whole life depends license get work,shop see family. ""forced"" realize mask protect you, right? protect everyone else whatever spreading. I'm becoming social norm wear mask whenever sick, wearing day day things return normal think doing. trials looking answer increasingly jab stop transmission. one denying that, that's perfectly fine. 

but directly requiring meet lots pushback. Indirectly, like mentioned above, works best imo. mean, Xavier Becerra make de facto mandatory right wanted to. set punishment refusal high enough. Got second Pfizer shot mild cold-like symptoms minus sore throat coughing. Mainly hot flashes/ low-grade fever, 2 short-lived chills episodes, minor headache minorly exacerbated body aches. expected much worse think really lucked out. Symptoms lasted 2.5 days. Day 3 feel completely back normal. actually can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs even optional. 2009 forced take swine flu vaccine nose. room full 300 new sailors many personal watching make sure it. didn‚Äôt like idea wasn‚Äôt approved squirted scarf. every person suspect people made much likely vaccinated already post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* allergic reaction first shouldnt get second dose. Check timelines shipment schedules. Seeing virus spreads exponentially, great. you‚Äôre assuming vaccines instantly effective time administration, reality takes 5 weeks fully protective. It‚Äôs hard tell. everything‚Äôs OPEN wear mask 3 hours plane I‚Äôve year cares?!!! pure hypothetical. precedent makes distinction types vaccine authorization. I'm sure someone challenge court, easily within bounds state's general police power. going long fight. found associated narcolepsy observational studies, increasing risk narcolepsy 5-14 times children 2-7 times adults. increased risk narcolepsy due vaccination children adolescents around 1 incident per 18,400 doses.

In summer 2010, MPA THL received reports Swedish Finnish healthcare professionals narcolepsy suspected adverse drug reaction Pandemrix flu vaccination. reports concern children 12 16 years old, whose symptoms occurred one two months vaccination. symptoms later confirmed compatible narcolepsy. could people allergic reaction first dose. think allergic reaction first dose im sure get second one.  Let's see fair getting strapped board &amp; 4 teeth removed &amp; 2 yrs later arm forcibly held table shots cause scared. 2% population 20 million... wonder go rich elderly first. Even every single person vaccinated top other, would lead MUCH BETTER result. likely case. 

Let put bad numbers. 
Let's say 10% would get infected 100% gets vaccinated, would campaign go? done said beginning would positive reinforcement. would like paid get it. late perhaps another smaller stimulus proposed. Dying possible negative outcome. Collage kids interactive socially. Parties, group studies ect. go home maybe state. spreads vector. guessing. counts covid death vary many ways anyway. UK example wiped 10,000 deaths (about 20%) first wave reporting period changed 3 months 28 days Wtf dude...hope Pfizer comes india. would gladly take shots remember deployed entire unit getting vaccinated without knowing vial, much less giving ""voluntary informed consent.""  general good code takes away lot benefits though like GI Bill No, that‚Äôs relatively recent trend. needed. without vaccine passports way open vaccinated. people refusing vaccines ones passports, shocking, majority. Whatev. Maybe state hospital random dude runs auto body repair shop can't pull information.

BTW, government organizations can't legally require vaccination COVID-19 employees. None vaccines officially approved yet, emergency use. think talking ass. May wild virus would impact young healthy adults looking Indian variant hitting even young people, one safe. know people pre-existing health conditions impacted horribly. course Indian health care system broken dying. one might die risk getting infected dangerous variant. Please get vaccinated. need least 80% population vaccinated(hopefully 12+ gets EUA soon rest end year). think 50% probable :-( republicans believe trump sent god break satanic cult pedophiles don‚Äôt believe vaccine proven incredibly safe effective? Sounds right.  thing got mom get it. fucking husband hers.... Critical thinking strong suit first thing say. wasted bunch words that. Honestly, I've looking county point New York given place state is. county basically 53% 1 dose 40.5% 2 doses, pretty damn good. Meanwhile Bronx pathetic 34.6 25% respectively confirm.

Back ears traumatized one round trip flight take last year. course are, ""no one else sell vaccines us"" lol sorry bearer bad news would expect slow around 60-65%, 70 I‚Äôm optimistic Interesting. wonder maybe school files keep records bc need show proof entered highschool, second shot around 15/16 year late school notified needed prove got second shot. 

My university application process also easy school system website clicked programs/school wanted apply submitted. submitted paperwork kind, even transcripts. What‚Äôs point acting people accidentally fall buildings know it‚Äôs murder..?  I'm sorry world live looking like  r/aboringdystopia getting hard call fantasy.  No. 'good old boys' believe vaccines. Isn‚Äôt vaccine available everyone states now, 16/18 depending vaccine? Thank you!! probably best time ever go parks reduced crowds = reduced time lines = fun! Thank you!! Yeah makes way sense. Especially baseball can't really afford sidelined day baseball games every single day. like lick cough produce Yes. isn‚Äôt science sub. Major problem vaccine hasitancy. debating well educated people risk vaccine outweighs risk Covid. think masks sufficient. Unfortunately, seen friend's parents followed protocols religiously die. think add requirement:  traveler eligible vaccination (and doctors note he/she cannot vaccinated), traveler must vaccinated.  Give time starting enforcement. Maybe start, June 1.

This would infringe anyone's rights. Travelers refuse vaccination, still travel. travel means.

This would give people want travel, incentive get vaccinated. might help convince people. misspelled Mexico Ask they‚Äôre waiting for. What‚Äôs metric? isn‚Äôt one.  fat $250 fine minimum wearing one either. really sends great message effective vaccines are. Good stuff, TSA. üôÑ everyone? even available super poor folks? thinking back BBC footage seen past week people literally dying streets outside hospitals Delhi family members touching ill without properly fitted masks chins. lmao ignore fact florida lagging behind texas, new york, california, etc % adults vaccinated? youve got nothing. enjoy upvotes like-minded idiots id love see prove wrong earn Anyone series done July 1 gets $500 whatever. That's oxymoron I'm ok show proof, card, real proof vaccinated. followed link phone cancer. It‚Äôs terminal. Thanks that. phone knows location 100% time... matter signed restaurant already knows there. Based vaccine efficacy age average death, would argue almost everyone US previously prevented vaccines manufactured US leaving country, order expired April 1 huge help world's supply. covid also moderna yesterday. Next one 27 days. Sore arm pretty tired. That's though. Hoping second dose worse Start. A. Lottery. allows people make informed decisions summer travel season. puts stake ground saying masks flights expected Labor Day. upvote tutus say Maybe president stop anti science  Everyone seemed really upset last guy, but, oh well. 

How feel injecting bleach shoving UV light bum combat virus? mandated attend. don‚Äôt attend pay. aren‚Äôt forced unless want attend school. watch Blackhawk Down, google Sgt. La David Johnson. Stuff like that. Dude I‚Äôm Canadian going PPE kits, face shilelds &amp; N95 masks sent like month ago (1.5 million) You‚Äôre calling Yanks sour? LOL many jealous, butt hurt Canadians. Hockey sucks  mean people also lazy. everyone chomping bit get right away. still trying find time busy lives priority. got mine soon possibly could everyone necessarily see urgency way - even though they'll get eventually. got distracted looking data forgot use bad.  Yea fucking stupid wear mask vaccinated people want get vaccine. 

There full availability everyone get vaccine want week. means 4-5 weeks open state, want vaccine able get it. It‚Äôs pandemic mandate want don‚Äôt attend. choices. let get straight, *I'm* cherry picking defining vaccination ""fully vaccinated"" (where Florida 3% higher)? cherry picking looking one dose? guess skip second dose then, Mr. Science?

Regardless numbers close original conclusion Florida's vaccine rollout going worse California's true measure. argument essentially states metrics standpoint, Florida's far, far better education, employment, mental health figures.

You've got nothing. Again, enjoy upvotes like-minded idiots I'd love see prove wrong earn Disney closed reality set really serious. got first one yesterday. throw whole new vile nobody wanted expired. both. I'm super COVID conscious person, Disneyland first trip planned immunity vaccination kicks in.

The main reason want go low-capacity, socially-distanced Disneyland kinda dream scenario me. parks waaaay crowded least last 10 years. used able find day there, non-stop packed. I'm excited try different experience that. Tldr. like: comment you‚Äôre responding proves exact point. Restrictions functionally extinct vaccinated population. Jealousy looking B.C getting gaslighted , manipulated overall fucked half measures aren‚Äôt anything. 

We got 58 year old age group.... It‚Äôs safe. That‚Äôs care keeps people dying wow 44% incredible! Hopefully 50%+ end may Oh no. 

TSA requiring masks planes [September good strategy encourage remaining unvaccinated people get it. can‚Äôt politicians come regulations show vaccines work? point collectively say want risk fine, I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôll fine. personal risk assessment? Vaccines available Every 16+ US 3 weeks. 3-4 weeks gotten wanted vaccine quickly 2 doses easily. mentioned earlier distinguish personal choices impact vs choices impact others. want get drunk, go it. Getting behind wheel 1,000+ vehicle driving high speeds drunk, cool.

It's like thought setting gotcha, everyone half brain cell tell difference supporting prohibition vs supporting drunk driving. Yeah I‚Äôm reading B.C. going WTH BC doing?!  relevant vaccine? I'm sure even asking ignorance makes sad. would apply vaccinated travelers well, virtually risk contracting spreading, mask not. 

Technically, 1/20th risk unvaccinated person contracting it. That's 95% efficacy means. call virtually risk. UK mainly jabbed AZ lot younger people going back 2nd jab blood clot news, think there's different issues 2nd dose take US possibly Think frustrating knowing countries EU among worst affected yet half doses exported.   lmao Billion vaccinated, billions desperately wanting get shot, yet people want one best invention millenium far lol. might get buried, look exemptions. college recently announced mandatory vaccinations except religious, medical - get - personal reason exemptions. Hospital administrator incentivized list covid one causes death. States uniform reporting COVID. Places like Minnesota report COVID laboratory tests positive well places like New York make assumptions based likelihood.

What fuck up. Even US giving fuck mentality, lot places still closed/events cancelled spreading virus limited.        
    
How happened India political rallies, festivals, religious gatherings, masks wearing etc.. festival called Holi literally paint strangers street bare hands. Imagine millions going around crowded populated place like India.  Jesus lad get grip Apparently matters virus too. know physician‚Äôs assistant two doses, like four months apart, virus August. figured they‚Äôd fine titers done part study titers higher anyone study hadn‚Äôt virus two weeks first dose early January. Well, say people good luck. foolish get vaccinated, you. live? mind asking Perhaps give dollop shekels getting vaccine Bottom line.  favor it? force lot things people geared towards preventing large losses life. fuck think modern civilization built on?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  know tell you. Covishield brand name particular AZ vaccine comes Serum Institute India. called Covishield comes India, full stop. America orders vaccine India. 

The 50M + 10M AZ doses currently America different story, article states, details still worked out. 

The 20M Covishield doses headline references specifically talking made-in-India vaccines. **There thing vaccine called Covishield made India.** Based info provided article, sounds like made fill American order ""diverted"" stay India instead. 

I know I'm getting many downvotes. information literally article. I'm glad sacrifice public health ignorant people guide freedom. Americans sucks suck guess. generosity‚Äôs directed non-Americans, brown ones that, motivate folks claim vaccine themselves? substantial immunity pandemic inducing virus. Congratulations! article says nothing minorities. understanding - I'm even specifically suggesting lifted next four months.

What saying extending four months obviously rapidly changing situation (with vaccinations) sends message nothing people (get vaccinated) matters. said ""hey, we're going extend month reevaluate"" great - reevaluating means something *could* change, even end happening. obviously one piece larger ecosystem restrictions, obviously thing, big issue. is, another nail coffin ""get vaccinated, expect anything change"", think hurting us. am. Waiting vaccine can't get yet. county magnificient. We've got 2/3's partially vaccinated point 1/2 fully vaccinated. One town 91% partially vaccinated. kick ass.

Interestingly, town biggest outbreak terms new cases per 100,000. 

Sounds like willfully unvaccinated got together mini super-spreader gathering event.

I think that's we're going see moving forward we'll annual boosters deal mutations bread plague rats. Same. Although living chapel hill going unc, got shit several times. cdc said clear, pretty happy it. still see people pulling mask run other. Even 10 feet apart haha. laugh now. Got second shot Wednesday week. Thursday, worst day health years. Friday, completely fine. Would heartbeat.  Michigan's hospitals overwhelmed weeks ago. Yeah, looks like I've thinking suppose one things lead astray, concept ""attack rate"". numbers actually look like this: 100,000 people vaccinated. vaccinations, would expected ‚Äúattack rate‚Äù 1% 1,000 COVID-cases population. vaccines, 1% reduced 95% .05% population expected get sick - 50 people.

My question is, attack rate calculated? people studied masking social distancing? rates calculated mind, rates (of vaccinated *and* unvaccinated) potentially vary people practice social distancing mask wearing?

Like, 95% vaccine efficacy stay pegged relative attack rate? stay number matter what, masks distance damned? 

Using example reference, abandoning safety precautions doubled unvaccinated 40 people, vaccinated people acted way- would 2 vaccinated people get it? would still 1 vaccinated person?

I'm assuming first, thinking way before. thank clarification. *quite* same. Although sinovac, J&amp;J, Sputnik uses adenovirus tech, use different adenoviruses probably different preparation methods, may cause varying efficacies dosing regimes 3 vaccines. also consider tested, variants, effectiveness vary variants well believe things forever keep developing. never highly contagious, un-eradicatable virus still cause disability mild cases before. (We‚Äôve also never SARS pandemic before, maybe normal among coronaviruses severe.) Mid may last heard century pandemic. Hundreds thousands Americans dead. everything need end pain suffering, millions people scared little poke. 

This truly dumbest timeline. Well said. absurd people get vaccinated, forcing people get vaccinated picture tyranny.

You need isolate socially, think. Get vaccine passports going, require proof vaccination negative covid tests sporting events such.

The willfully unvaccinated basically plague rats need treated such. Yea, that's case lot folks. Like scheduled seek out, especially basically self quarantine one reason another. us quarantine long we've forgotten mild illness allergies feel like, fingers crossed good news! Thank trial participant. Sincerely. 

I grateful vaccination. less faith though B.1.617 though. doesn‚Äôt matter many vaccines distribute 30% population refuses take them. They‚Äôll reservoir new variants. New variants still cause mild illness vaccine recipients. Mild cases still result permanent lung scarring frighteningly high rates. (Post COVID Fibrosis) Every time new vaccines developed, virus mutated slightly resistant well. 

How cycle going end? Yes would agree course did. live life, promote vaccinations (which can. one 30000 trial participants thank Moderna shots way) things develop, act accordingly There's also big difference introvert shut-in.

But specifically meant things like orange theory treadmill  That‚Äôs acceptable solution. 

You‚Äôre downplaying threat this. 

Did even read whole thing? bed bound unable sleep pain. Second dose Wednesday pain strong enough Friday got worse Saturday finally able sleep Sunday still horrible pain. Pain grew Thursday. Speaking personal experience, first shot overall scheduling process probably discouraging lot people going way get second shot. 

I go back first dose site twice wait line hour time despite making appointment kept overbooking slots. reaction first shot also severe, hearing stories people whose second shots considerably worse unsettling. fact wait exactly one month go back second shot inconvenient, know I‚Äôm going busy work week I‚Äôm going stressed commission recovering side effects.

These minor grievances, I‚Äôm still planning getting second shot want travel internationally again, imagine people don‚Äôt strong incentive aren‚Äôt close vaccine site like might say fuck bother.  Good lord, all-day event. times went in, gave information, sat down, gave informed consent, got jabs. waited 15 minutes time case anything happened. total amount time visits like 40 50 minutes.

Get vaccinated, people! dragging suffering anti vaxxer hesitant people however. fail see issue people choose take vaccine get sick. don‚Äôt feel sympathy suffering people choose enable risk? mindset changed?

I‚Äôm psycho doesn‚Äôt want medical access, reality hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed anymore every person 16 get vaccine. probably stay inside I‚Äôm sorry losses. exact Wednesday, Thursday Friday experience! takes three/four weeks get fully vaccinated. hasn‚Äôt long time since everyone elegible get vaccinated states; mention much travel schedules full, players want get shot didn‚Äôt get immediately upon elegible. Yup. predicted daily cases would start dropping end April since would've reached Israel's vaccination % led tipping point Pfizer. Lo behold right. that, see surge deaths Brazil saw.

They literally walk hall basic training people put injection injection arms. True, Japan they're trying justify concerts saying ""we're taking precautions! We're taking temperature, alcohol spraying hands cleaning seats!!"" 
... that's works???? agree. sent everywhere needed. think Mexico Canada first priority India second release unused vaccines.  Sooooo good AZ J&amp;J, made UK US? Lol! world is. offers people leadership positions rejected them. still are. There‚Äôs reason restrictions process withdrawn. Reducing efficacy results people otherwise wouldn‚Äôt gotten infected experiencing mild cases instead. (In disease, wouldn‚Äôt care this. COVID, we‚Äôre talking about.) % cases unlucky ones scarred life. otherwise would perfectly fine virus hadn‚Äôt become slightly vaccine-resistant. 

I got two shots MODERNA go affected slightly sickened India variant, could one mild cases develop Post COVID Fibrosis. 

There‚Äôs always gonna reservoir new variants. 

Flu doesn‚Äôt cause lung scarring ever mild cases. diseases also tend less infectious we‚Äôre eradicated. (Or there‚Äôs like, thousand cases per year rather millions.)

This first virus cause pandemic still cripple even mild cases, *can‚Äôt* eradicate. Paywalled Reported I‚Äôm still trying wrap head around think specific mask mandate one offered incentive. affects people hours time, one closest-quarters interactions people have.

That didn‚Äôt come judgy me. came ‚Äúby way, didn‚Äôt necessarily that‚Äù. Well guess means hope ""100% normal June-July!"" goes right window.

Not I'm complaining anything, though. Airplanes hotspots disease transmission, COVID, nice stay protected.

Wonder last ""indefinitely"" like Patriot Act. Skeptics saying will, doubt it. COVID abstract ""terror."" common Asia wear masks everywhere always. sure hear this

I remember saying that, sure put words mouth.

We originally talking one person chose wear mask. see problem it, sure standard Asia SARS. Technically.... scammed Slovakian auths *(and ruling coalition severe problems + OLaNO've 'bled' support.. might similar  4-5 weeks isn‚Äôt enough time. think give everyone couple weeks get appointment you‚Äôre fully vaccinated 6 weeks that. think 8-10 weeks things fully open up. BC age 50 end next week. getting news? 3 solid weeks USA averaged 3 million shots per day... meaning next 2 weeks, roughly amount getting second shots day.

The number fully vaccinated continue skyrocket pretty quick. friends living cocoon then. Ask step streets smell burning funeral pyres. still mean 3 1/2 months doses instead recommended 3 weeks? I've seen people suggest extend directives increments (e.g. every two months) longer necessary, problem type messaging opponents would accuse ""shifting goalposts"" interpret implying ""we think likely going end 2 months.""

It's like folktale father, son, horse. matter choice make, always end unable please people. That‚Äôs now, yes.  countries hit hard hit hardest second third waves. really interesting though. would thought widespread improvements made testing treatment, research transmission occurs published, increasing population immunity would generally make initial waves worst.

It goes show bad complacency, fatigue, sometimes mutations guess. people ask ‚ÄúWhat would anyone gain continued lockdowns restrictions?!‚Äù
Well ya go. county 60% first doses 42% second doses pretty good. It‚Äôs really attacking kids unfortunately. I‚Äôd say 95% adults school vaccinated least good. Yupp. It‚Äôs sickening people crying ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù masks whole time ignoring since day one 0 consequence.

The day Fletchers, retired couple, spoke vaccine family physician, Dr. Daniel Lewis, one-year anniversary day put ventilator severe case Covid.

Dr. Lewis, 43, remained hospitalized month. gravely ill recorded farewell messages five children.

Over 13 years Greeneville, Dr. Lewis, volunteer physician school sports teams chief medical officer four Ballad Health regional hospitals, accrued wide community support. illness, people dropped meals restaurant gift cards porch kept surging prayer chain. mowed lawn, mulched flower beds, fixed truck.

When left hospital, 34 pounds thinner, weak wobbly, wife, devout Baptists, struggled figure God‚Äôs purpose behind ordeal.

Patients kept telling him, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take Covid seriously got sick.‚Äù

So Dr. Lewis began using hard-earned credibility speak vaccine, visiting nursing homes, addressing churches, making videos. honed pitch meet every pushback, faux-scientific conspiratorial spiritual.

Although many Appalachians used resist seeing doctor, family medicine practitioners like Dr. Lewis becoming trusted figures. discussing vaccines patients takes time, many doctors can‚Äôt afford, established relationship, many poor patients don‚Äôt have.

Dr. Lewis gives soft sell sometimes works. patient say, ‚ÄúSo going give vaccine now?‚Äù

He respond, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt here.‚Äù patient shuts down. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôm going take it.‚Äù

Could Dr. Lewis persuade Fletchers get vaccine?

Mr. Fletcher doesn‚Äôt fret long-term side effects. prostate cancer returned, one blow Job-like year saw unexpected death younger son, paraplegic, death nephew, emergency room physician. year dear friends severed relationship Fletchers couple‚Äôs Covid skepticism.

‚ÄúWhen get older, think tears, something causes come back,‚Äù said subdued voice.

Dr. Lewis patiently addressed Fletchers‚Äô questions, delineating researchers don‚Äôt yet know.

‚ÄúHow sure chips vaccine, like things put dog?‚Äù Mr. Fletcher asked.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt make microchips small,‚Äù Dr. Lewis countered.

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs like grain rice,‚Äù said Mr. Fletcher.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt inject grain rice needle,‚Äù Dr. Lewis said.

Dr. Lewis held smartphone. you‚Äôre worried tracked, said, technology right here, thing pick every day. Every hour.

The Fletchers looked abashed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs decision,‚Äù Dr. Lewis said gently. ‚ÄúI want able make informed decision want best help you.‚Äù

Mr. Fletcher replied, ‚ÄúWell, spend time discussion.‚Äù

Later, Dr. Lewis optimistic: ‚ÄúI think eventually persuade them.‚Äù

To date, Fletchers say take vaccine. need apologize phone formatting. large majority redditors use mobile exclusively. Covid actually damage people's cardiovascular nervous system, vaccine not. same.  friends India tell media overhyping crematoriums. It‚Äôs like one two rural villages basically clearly paying attention.   reason nurses wear masks go patients rooms.  Masks help protect mask-user. probably production lag. could change. think likely will.

""We continue work closely Centers Disease Control Prevention evaluate need directives,‚Äù LaJoye said."" Yeah... like free 5G topic volatile

But Fletchers, Free Baptists, worry vaccine includes aborted fetal parts (it doesn‚Äôt). don‚Äôt trust government, convinced long manipulated Covid case numbers.

‚ÄúI think hornswoggled,‚Äù Mr. Fletcher said.

Laziness mostly FDA approval, 'emergency use approval'



Is I'm told people ask question ""us vs. them"" even though sentiment largely same... Yes hesitancy black communities totally different thing. said ""most"" actually anti vax, rather many 100%. Let national guard go door-to-door Nice! Congrats wfh job. That‚Äôs dream!  believe regulators decided blood clots listed possible side effects J&amp;J Astra-Zeneca vaccines. don‚Äôt think link shown conclusively, point look likely adenovirus vector vaccines causing unusual cases clotting (which conflated typical cases clotting fact different can‚Äôt treated typical treatments). bad joke. group pointed many students employees high risk severe illness complications coronavirus, said college reopenings fall associated spread surrounding communities.

Then *those* people get vaccinated? Yes, mandate reaches full FDA approval well should. can‚Äôt It‚Äôs mandated public universities reaches full FDA approval. Sure it‚Äôs safe, scheduled vaccine day opened me. think everyone get vaccinated can. it‚Äôs fully fda approved say October, mandated semester starts? There‚Äôs big difference private vs public universities allowed do. GREENEVILLE, Tenn.‚Äî ‚ÄúSo gotten vaccine yet?‚Äù

The question, friendly greeting Betty Smith, pastor‚Äôs wife, lingered air four church women sat regular Tuesday coffee conversation Ingle‚Äôs Market.

Mrs. Smith hesitated, sensing chilly blast judgment never-mask, never-vax companion. fumbled non-reply.

Recalling moment later, sighed, ‚ÄúWe get know better first thing table Covid vaccine.‚Äù

The subject makes husband, Rev. David Smith, even uncomfortable. ‚ÄúHonestly, wish people wouldn‚Äôt ask,‚Äù said, chatting Wednesday night prayer Tusculum Baptist Church. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs none business. it‚Äôs dividing people.‚Äù

As beautiful Appalachian spring unfurls across northeastern Tennessee, Covid-19 vaccine tearing apart friends, families, congregations, colleagues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs muddy mess,‚Äù said Meredith Shrader, physician assistant, runs events venue husband, another pastor, notes choice become much health care. ‚ÄúWhich voice listen to?‚Äù

Communities like Greeneville surroundings ‚Äî rural, overwhelmingly Republican, deeply Christian, 95 percent white ‚Äî radar President Biden American health officials, efforts vaccinate U.S. population enters critical phase. places polls show resistance vaccine entrenched. campaigns aimed convincing Black Latino urban communities set aside vaccine mistrust made striking gains, towns like also convinced country achieve widespread immunity.

But week Greene County reveals nuanced, layered hesitancy surveys suggest. People say politics isn‚Äôt leading driver vaccine attitudes. common reason apprehension fear ‚Äî vaccine developed haste, long-term side effects unknown. decisions also entangled web views bodily autonomy, science authority, plus powerful regional, somewhat romanticized self-image: don‚Äôt like outsiders messing business.

According state health department statistics, 31 percent vaccine-eligible population Greene County gotten least one dose Covid vaccine, still Tennessee overall, one lowest rates country, far Centers Disease Control Prevention‚Äôs national tally 55 percent. many older residents inoculated, eligibility open adults, vaccination sites almost desolate.

Still, conversations show many people, resistance firm. Roiled internet fallacies, many hunger straightforward information people trust. Others practical needs, like paid time recover side effects, Biden administration urged employers offer, opportunity get shot doctor.

What‚Äôs also lacking groundswell might encourage hesitant make leap: Many people gotten vaccinated remaining tight-lipped. ....so basically wildlife conservation, right? Sorry hear that, it‚Äôs absolutely devastating see happening. I‚Äôm US also know plenty ‚Äúeducated‚Äù folks anti vax. Took awhile convince family finally got board.

Anything say even remotely rock fragile way thinking met massive downvoting ridiculous replies. hear you, hope you‚Äôre wrong wait one eye open. Hopefully look back comment July laugh. We‚Äôll see. Perhaps someone medical knowledge back this, think pain occurs days caused inflammation contents shot, actual administration shot.


Some anecdotal evidence: first shot completely painless, arm pain following days horrible. felt like bad shoulder strain.


My second shot slightly noticeable, little pain following days. Thank great news. world wide pandemic? concept hard grasp year in. lockdown accomplish task done correctly (and people comply)? India huge country. might true one area may true areas. I'm sorry, lizard people ... what? know kinda tangent is. People lost control democracies, corruption rampant, midst unprecedented technological innovation societal evolution staggeringly dust, problems mass propaganda fueling rejection science, multitudes epidemics famine environmental, wealth disparity. first time, literally tools human population prosper, yet hoarded minority privileged class. time list innumerable qualities dystopia sure lizard thing like top priority.

Edit: recall said r/aboringdystopia, lizards would r/alitdystopia Yeah things clearly underreported. There's less deaths per capita officially US last seven days, strikes HIGHLY unlikely true. Weve 100 million people get fully vaccinated. early January. vaccines long term side effects wouldve heard now. agree saw benefit, jumped opportunity say something, even best interest.

DOD recently authorized paid recovery days get vaccine - feel like also incentivize people (plenty civilians work military also reluctant get it). think suggestion like bit dangerous. Best encourage everyone follow doctor‚Äôs advice guidelines disease professionals. ""equitable"" shit term. made - use it. know people downvoting, true. Canadian currently living US even 17 year old stepson vaccinated 60 y-o parents became eligible Canada. Canada spacing 2nd dose 3 months... parents vaccinated mid April scheduled dose 2 early August. I've fully vaccinated weeks 35, yet people 59 younger eligible yet Canada first dose. won‚Äôt wiped out. It‚Äôll endemic virus years it‚Äôll another one 4 coronavirus common colds already deal with. 

A virus animal reservoir like one never wiped there‚Äôs always possibility it‚Äôll jump animal human again. Im also afraid.. lol. look. felt bad injected fluid hurting like hell. Started throbbing liquid moved inside. poor countries enough money, global vaccine distribution based fatness country's wallet?

Yes. works. didn‚Äôt go mRNA route?  skipping second shot?? whhhhhyyy? You‚Äôve come far, it, please. think one likely work due generous unemployment supports. I'm actually far worried housing market medium term, along inflation lesser degree. I'm accountant work finance. think lot positives horizon, relationship inflation hot housing market rather worrying. inflation ticks significantly, effective tool combat raise interest rates. raise interest rates cause economic contraction vulnerable time, along exposing potential another financial crisis housing market similar 2008 (a sudden hike interest rates could cause wave subprime defaults, doubt plenty moment). alone country generally worse financially, billion people country many people crammed close together Im surprised took long shit hit fan. Frankly India shouldve one first countries get hit hard. Keeping make hoarding. Luckily company pretty liberal everyone it.. lol True, first world country cobblestone streets structures like Pantheon ancient Romans trod ground you.

I'll always remember first glimpse Pantheon coming side street right behind it. That, fortunate enough special hours tour Sistine Chapel take wonderful creation made Michaelangelo human hands. Fascinating! Doesnt see so. ny parents China rn didnt need to, even travel (inside country). might different province province doh. less 2 weeks since vaccines became available adults US, MLB's metric includes post-injection period required build immunity.

And anti-vax aside (there certainly some), many guys got vaccinated day two three side effects.  That's fine star big multi-year contract, guys fringe, could difference staying big leagues not. Canadian living US right family Canada... Canada one worst countries vaccine. state open everyone 16 month, states well. I'm 35 got second shot day 60 year old parents able get first one second shot August Canada spacing doses almost 3 months instead 3 weeks Pfizer. 

There's lot things proud about, Canada's handling vaccine really one.  Grow think good go - hadn‚Äôt gotten shot (or bloodwork) decade, since passed blood drawn physical 19 so. barely felt COVID needle, I‚Äôm hoping shot 2 better irrational fear (hopefully) subsided. 

Luckily drive-thru vaccine spot first one, wife drove me. passed passenger seat. Came back 5-10 seconds, drank water, opened windows, back feeling almost normal 15-30 minutes. hearing? heard anything that. Government certainly seem expediting things front, disappointing. informed statement? widely reported new variants circulation India causing younger demographics become substantially ill far higher rate (likely due increased viral load per Anthony Fauci). take point around sensationalizing, that.  mean play devil's advocate vaccine uses MRNA mechanism used. none, legitimately know long term effects. could said Eurasian-zone country sans Baltics. Dude gives AF? Except everyone encountered saying evidence virus would mutate spread faster, younger people, reinfect people.

The experts keep saying things possible. Nobody fixate that, neither deny it. we're going get past it, need face facts are.  Im situation get first list come back work instead telework kind rush... US hoarding vaccines 4 months, barely exporting. time step up. deaths one dose two. vaccines work well break throughs possible especially one dose. 

For article : ‚ÄúThough sorts breakthrough infections reported among people ages, little 40% far among people age 60 older, according agency, 65% cases among women. 29% experiencing breakthrough infections experienced symptoms, 7% hospitalized 74 people died.‚Äù Well, says he‚Äôs going to, don‚Äôt reason take claim face value. Damn guy let cut front reason! thought seemed suspicious time! gonna lie kinda sucks, deal it. Young mothers natural green stuff one leaders anti-vaxx movement.  Doesn‚Äôt seem crazy incentivize people another stimulus check get shot. We‚Äôve already given 2000+ every person. What‚Äôs hundred encourage people take shot? Agreed. Need give many rewards safely possible encourage vaccinations. Measles levels likely endpoint here, universal childhood vaccination occasional flare ups amongst unvaccinated communities.

Perhaps even elimination like Polio Smallpox? might bit stretch though. Transportation Security Administration announced Friday extending face mask requirement across U.S. transportation least Sept. 13, individuals continue wearing face coverings locations including airports, onboard commercial aircraft, over-the-road buses, commuter bus rail systems, according agency‚Äôs initial mask rule went effect Feb. 1 set expire May 11. US military stuff around world help keep regions nations safer. absolutely felt mine‚Äîit hurt like hell.

And don‚Äôt mind needles, still hurt. seems every college takes federal funds required this. US sent bunch AZ vaccine north. makes perfect sense prioritize Mexico Canada. countries vaccine coverage like 2% last week. Americans frequently visit countries. Mexico actually talking building wall 15 years now- yeah wasn‚Äôt Trump‚Äôs idea. What's commas? '.'? made physically cringe  things seniors cause much anxiety? getting old mean relinquish bodily mental autonomy? Vaccine diplomacy US ramping coming months certainly unstable behavior every time anyone questioning product taken account. Vaccine supply issues EU thing past. means, I‚Äôm happy people saved vaccine, EU package doesn‚Äôt make sense. LARP everyone pandemic showed us peak stupidity human ingenuity time. Ignoring plastics environment now. Tiny dicks low sperm count. vaccine least worries comes reproduction. Booking appointment opening 2 weeks, actual shot everyone line. nice cherry pick. know facts, facts florida hotspot california not. also know floridas vaccine rollout faltered stalled out, states, even ones like texas, smashing florida. whats going on? There‚Äôs tens y‚Äôall I‚Äôm sure Fact is, January 6th saw republicans capable of. no, trust around anti-maskers without mask. What‚Äôs degree in? Yankees apparently used Johnson Johnson one  buy good hockey players,  think described entire internet.

Gotta love stupidity too. Second flight took since corona there's masks theater, hey total face face pat crotch ass? Guess that's totally safe! Nice cherry pick. course pandemic, Florida slightly deaths / cases per capita California (despite older population). play game show December January California disaster Florida relatively well. weird, coronavirus spread rapidly California muted Florida, despite strict lockdown? every Californian misbehave time December/January suddenly behave February?

But fine, care last week, let's compare Michigan Florida. Michigan, lockdown state, triple cases per capita. What's going on? It‚Äôs California awhile. Stop posting scare tactic articles OP Detroit Tigers New York Yankees two nine teams. think would apply. school rule, country rule. dad's friend safely back US. managed get COVID guess Moderna works ok Indian variant, though know well social distanced could exposed. Oh, actually believe opposite. lock flu every year even though people die, think locked covid even though would mean people would die. numbers really matter care principle - worth locking save lives not?

I dislike idea drawing arbitrary line saying ""If disease kills &lt;insert random people lock down, kills less shouldn't"".

The reason course number completely random essentially allows government lock whenever feel like logical cutoff point could fall back on.  u.s still 60k new case day... mission acomplish time open up.... 

trying hard select strain bypass current vaccine immunity guess. they? every single college? require vaccinations public school, logical step prevent spread deadly virus. Except vaccine free.   I'm 24, born 1996 I'm turning 25 year. province would count 25 goes birth year Quebec would count 24. Ughh really? 

75-80% country fully vaccinated July. really still need masks time? Airplane air recirculates every 3-5 minutes. It‚Äôs 100% safer Walmart. 

Way uninspire people get vaccinated. ‚ÄúI still gotta deal masks restrictions!‚Äù  honestly thought military folks would first get shots, I'm surprised discussed. Wouldn‚Äôt new variant India favor transmission lethality? new variant order remain dominant would need spread farthest fastest, that‚Äôs achievable minimally pathogenic. Technically questions asked need lot studies prove effective. Nobody board really earth could give answers held much weight. enough studies done yet definitively answer questions.

Basically us plays extremely safe always comes drugs. fda perfect (see aids crisis) tend stringent research focused countries. reason fda extension cdc generally support anything outside tested approved protocols. may seem inefficient times generally safer approach. think underestimating challenge trying vaccinate staff probably spread place. Scouts, coaches, player development staff, front office officials non-player employees literally country. simple ""everybody show work X day get shot"" Accepted Harvard stupid enough let COVID vaccine stop you. Hard imagine, damn it‚Äôs believable. seem barely understand basic English, - good luck! Oh, helpful parent. Thank you! kid terrified needles, I'll try next time needs vaccine. That's entire sub hoping covid last longer. Brings everyone basement reality  continue hermit long want, even covid, know right? would require virus mutate animals, mutate more, mutate back humans again.

At point, basically saying never lift restrictions next pandemic come around would likely Covid coming animals again. Nikkei newspaper reported Covid-19 outbreak India forced Suzuki, Honda Toyota temporarily suspend production India government urged manufacturers convert oxygen used industry use consumption. medical destination. Ah see you‚Äôre saying. hope happens  Yeah, pretty terrible. that's people used to, say four months people think it'll *even longer*. help either.  lol completely wrong obvious bias havent done research. california 28.8 cases per 100k people last week, florida 170.2. deaths also higher florida, florida currently lagging behind big states terms vaccinations. hell, even texas vaccinated adults florida has, new york california. basically florida mess every floridian aware evidence god? share it. literally remembered forever history. Yes, remember vaccines made equipments, using ingredients effectively unaccessible rest world due export ban. It‚Äôs tragedy insanely limited resources go trash can. can‚Äôt get education?‚Ä¶ pandemic made blue collar manual labor family members virologists lol Yeah nobody ever tried that. ‚ÄúAll time could‚Äôve giving people aspirin they‚Äôd fiiiiine.‚Äù Seriously?   sure.

Open country. United States agreed send 20 million Covidshield doses AstraZeneca order India divert sufficient multipore filters would enable production 18 million doses. Also, first tranche 20,000 doses experimental Covid-19 drug Remdesivir expected reach India week.
Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said briefing Thursday 40 nations pitching urgently needed resources countries India supplied essential pharmaceutical products including hydroxychloroquine, paracetamol Remdesivir come forward help.
Official sources said United States agreed divert 20 million vaccine doses India timeline yet specified. believed US 10 million doses stock another 50 million manufactured next two months.
India also touch China ensure cargo flights remain operational large number medical supplies sourced. ‚ÄúA large number cargo flights operational. Sichuan airlines, 10 flights day, suspended operations impact supplies there. touch authorities China much connectivity open,‚Äù Shringla said.
While 22 tonnes medical supplies, including oxygen plants, arrived Russia Wednesday, first supplies United States expected land Friday morning, three military aircraft set bring medicines oxygen related equipment.
The United States also send 20,000 courses Remdesivir antiviral drug early next week. addition supplying Millipore filters stocks enable manufacturing 18 million AstraZeneca doses India earliest. 17 oxygen generator plants also likely sent across.
In all, India expected get 550 oxygen generating plants partners across world. Oxygen supplies tagged first priority Indian missions abroad coordinating relief efforts. US committed send 1,700 oxygen concentrators obtain oxygen ambient air, mobile units provide options flexible patient treatment, statement White House said. India also receive oxygen generation units, multiple large-scale units support 20 patients each, additional mobile units provide ability target specific shortages. team US experts support units, working hand-in-hand ground Indian medical personnel, White House said. 
Messages support pouring across globe, including statement Italian PM Mario Draghi pledging medical supplies. ‚ÄúThrough Civil Protection Department, ready sending oxygen production system, made available Piedmont Region supplies traditional hospital field structure. team specialised personnel also ready start ensuring operation equipment,"" said. Indian Navy help bring 40 mt og oxygen shipment gifted Bahrain 185 mt expected Kuwait. India also looking procure Remdesivir Egypt, besides exploring options import medicine. Manufacturer Gilead already promised 4.5 lakh doses medicine India.

Here‚Äôs entire article. imply ""we'll divert order stay India.""?

The article clear states ‚ÄúIt believed US 10 million doses stock another 50 million manufactured next two months.‚Äù least 10m finished stock US already. literally looking apartments another city today. live like king vs place forced live commute in. actually like city more.

It's wonderful. ????? That's likely case. reported numbers comes adding hospital deaths. hospitals capacity turning away patients, many people dying home they're counted part official reported death numbers. Then, there's slums god knows many deaths happening there. want normal back. People want go back office able to.

I want ever go back office. Absolutely not, crowds make worse. Standing 65 minute line kid behind kicks ankles, finding anywhere shade sit, ram shoulder crowd make tight corridor-I can't wait go next month able space around me.  yea hasnt caused splash since californias case rate per capita continued trend and, afaik, currently fewest cases per capita whole country truly cared mitigating risk would get vaccinated. personally can't wait masks longer required flights. think less people choose continue understand would, hate much look forward becomes personal choice. Wearing mask moment get shuttle airport parking lot get rental car whatever side trip, really sucks imo, although totally understand necessary past year. became ""fully vaccinated"" today. received second Pfizer dose two weeks ago. 

So 100 millionth fully vaccinated, win? Technically, following CDC's present top-line guideline, ""get vaccinated"".  way live vaccines given blow dart? think way get leverage countries. knew would desperate get vaccines. Hopefully starts coming mid may oxygen supply chain expanded strict lockdown imposed several states  familiar Prohibition?  question whether awaiting ""full approval"" FDA whether issuance full, regular approval FDA inside next 6 months would factor decisioning.

My gut instinct either waiting new information showing higher risks taking (like new variant vaccine mitigating prior infections might not) awaiting certain period time post-vaccination many people who've already vaccinated. right? would sometime soon full approval FDA mean anything you? even see sequence mRNA vaccines going get vaccinated either way wont make difference üò¨ yikes Thank God. Damn, that's new level delivering part Sure buddy. careful summer 1 dose, don‚Äôt let fool ya. CDC recommends get vaccinated. Lotta managers cranky can't leech subordinates work sub, guess. India always super effected pandemics.

Over 10 million died Spanish flu need lower risk people receive vaccine herd immunity. incredibly selfish.  clearly said ""people *don't* want return"" post. people want return office, talking them. 

I thinking people trapped 45+ minute commutes go job obviously home. Georgia's R value currently .94 plateau'ed quite while. vaccine rates, NJ pass us soon. got first moderna shot last weekend.

And course, J&amp;J [got paused due possibly bad batch, adding even anxiety.

Really sure here, appreciate advice. are, course, correct. interesting thing thought experiments. would assume mutation would increase vector would become dominant one matter density environment virus excels in.

Afterall, strains compete environment. actually clue human immune system works? vaccines work?  natural immunity sufficient, neither vaccine. vaccine get body prepare natural defenses.  Furthermore, immune system retains memory create antibodies infection, active antibodies body remember make correct antibodies. please stop posting dumb ignorance. Educate human immune system.

So true, sad see lives many people impacted fear vaccine :( Yep, here. never fear of/issues needles, even kid. Hi, want better understand correlation covid cases economic costs NPIs. impression essentially pay reproduction number, i.e. cutting cases half costs less fixed price, independent total number cases. Except tracing tracking ressources finite, slightly cheaper case numbers low, that's support zeroish covid strategies. I'm bit perplexed developments Germany Switzerland, Switzerland much cases second wave pretty much par Germany, yet heard times Switzerland spent less money NPIs. That's agains logic, would assume saved money first half second wave, allowed greater reproduction number, crunched numbers faster Germany, spent money timespan. Where's flaw thinking? Suppose already sick year excess 'allowed sick time'? Suppose get paid sick leave? Shitty take first one excrutiatingly painful. honestly think woman wrong arm hurt bruise month.

My second hurt much arm back normal couple days definitely felt it. usually feel shots even blood draws all.

I definitely want discourage anyone, honest. I'm sure helpful people claim even feel effects.

I got Moderna, fwiw. big numbers. India 1.4B population - twice whole Europe. number deaths cases per population India second hundred countries.

Compare South America especially Brazil. India Brazil amount tests per million (200k). Brazil 5x cases per million 10times deaths per million. Cases/deaths countries under-reported too.

And cases South America ramping too. Even richer countries big problems (like Uruguay). believe certain hotspot postal codes anyone 18 get mention, Long Covid renders good chunk infected people unable work months  worded comment badly, you‚Äôve captured essence it. nutshell, environment doesn‚Äôt require transmissible change survive. It‚Äôs already ok, happened develop deadly mutation environment, would also successful. Oh political sub now. Edgy people actually curious: [even current delivery schedule nobody actually end waiting That's factoring US already loosening exports, means they're likely coming close hitting ""enough doses every American"" promise, point they're going fully open exports.  news Pfizer started exporting US yesterday Canada Mexico Canada's provinces put delay starting March 1st BC around 8th-10th provinces. delay put 16 weeks, [even current delivery schedule nobody actually end waiting consider US loosening exports means they're probably coming close hitting ""enough doses every American"" promise, point they're going fully open exports, crazy think it'll stay long. gave toddler syringe(without needle) play it. Sometimes play dockter jab stuffed animals. Sometimes use water gun etc. 

Now watches needle go's vacinations without problems. impossible hide actual deaths people scale. single number, publicly available data individual cities even registration offices city districts, need conspiracy involving tens thousands people. population also indirectly influences many publicly available social economic indicators, many smart people analyzing social economic data. inconsistencies would found. US shown repeatedly decades, change anything. America First always bipartisan. According article, 31% percent eligible people county least one dose vaccine.

In LA 54% 2 days ago. remotely comparable. Hope someone making documentary it. Pains say plenty kooks think BC, well.

But Alberta highest anti-vaxxer vaccine hesitancy rates Canada. country last one year, 75 million pushed level $2/day income. would point herd immunity achieved via entire population getting infected millions dying? Herd immunity supposed goal itself, supposed prevent future infections deaths making sure population large essentially unable breeding ground virus. many (or even more) people die attempt gain herd immunity natural infection, would protected? 

People need stop thinking ""herd immunity good, therefore, letting virus run rampant also good"". Herd immunity good many people die getting (I.e. achieved vaccinating people). 

So, yes, country would probably reach herd immunity faster without restrictions, price?

- everyone gets sick once, Healthcare system can't take care people go hospital, survive get there. means death rate could increase lot, people ""will die without going hospital, survive hospital"" category die (which like 5-10% population, depending age group). one important reasons we've trying keep cases low possible countries (with varying degrees success). 

- Even 1% patients died, 1% 1.36 billion infected people fuckton people (roughly 13.6 million). 

- every infection, virus chance mutate. virus run rampant would ideal way breed variants, would mean people get infected therefore chances mutation increase. variants we've seen far come populations massive outbreaks. know dangerous future variants might be, best take chances Personal choice. Wear mask forever want. Forcing people power trip, certain point. profiteering state business.
Massive spending vanity projects like monuments, personal aircraft, leaders residence going RIGHT NOW. 

Now worse part - 12% GST Covid aid abroad, come via ICRC. 12% GST medical oxygen, 5% Covid vaccines, 28% ambulance, 5% PPE Rs 1,000 12% rest; Plus 12%, 5%, 12% 18% GST test kits, masks, ventilators &amp; sanitisers. Scary thought except virus *need* anything. work way. Mutations random happen time. mutations stick simply make particular strain spread better. anything, dense populated area would create mutations would spread host host often. stupid idea adverse effect moment.

It may suggest we're get 2.5+ million doses AstraZeneca, and/or US closing enough doses announce they're fully opening exports soon. Thank America!!  Read profile. troll one thing say breakthough cases, always vaccines, say one day vaccines totally useless virus mutated much even T-cells would recognize complete speculation based currently available data. opinion, type argument dissuades people getting vaccinated they're thinking ""Why would get vaccinated gonna useless couple months"" incredibly far truth 12% GST Covid aid abroad, come via ICRC. 12% GST medical oxygen, 5% Covid vaccines, 28% ambulance, 5% PPE Rs 1,000 12% rest; Plus 12%, 5%, 12% 18% GST test kits, masks, ventilators &amp; sanitisers. covid shots second one kicked ass. side effects worse actual covid, me. Weird. July first dose made tired, second one gave awful side effects 2 days. Bodies strange. 99% survival rate get medical attention. drops 95% lower health system overwhelmed like India, that‚Äôs without taking account medical attention needed ailments. Please children. Well, would imagine biggest concern orders received full authorization, someone could challenge order court win. would make things much worse. That's I'm loving five bar 5G reception everywhere go! doubt vaccine procrastinators giving much thought, any, TSA rules masks. procrastination psychological, dare say existential, TSA rules mean much them. Good. Take kids never give back. ""fortunate"" infected previously, although trying crunch risk odds, odds re-infection, high, seem greater vaccine issues. Getting covid provide much protection getting vaccinated.

Plus, much slower process. US there's 32 million covid cases 1 year vs. 144 million partial vaccinations couple months.

And longer goes, chance mutations break past immunity. here. aches, chills lasted 10 hours went away. Also Moderna. long lasted? Oh Messi Messi Messi No, sentiment people scared something they've never experienced before.

Although travel might ok select countries year Relax get jab. relieved after. Best prize all!  seriously stupid? article linked says Pfizer neutralizes it. counting people taking word actually looking ""source"". I'm sick people like you. skip second dose get infected getting first dose?

I supposed get second dose next week got infected ü•¥ I'm one them! Pfizer gang FTW! gotta love Armchair Immunologists. 2 years, 20 years? wait kids kids see generational effects?

Folks always pull another rabbit hat try sound like they're ""due diligence"" reality they're utterly league making things justify flimsy logic. people claiming things supported actual law. Lots Indians made false claims past couple weeks. Modi par Brazilian counterpart. Never covid first shot moderna sore arm day, second shot hit hard. Full body aches, chills, fatigue. eagerly waiting see data this. phase 1/2 trials looked like immune response J&amp;J continued increasing day 50 60 yet see data translates real-world effectiveness. Everyone vaccinated safe. statistics prove overwhelmingly. someone chosen unvaccinated, that's vaccinated safe them. We're also long past point deep cleaning needed fomites transmission vector. Case precedent also prevents sued employees.

As employer, need nothing would someone came work cold response ill employee would, eventually potentially, response take someone cancer took month. fire them, fire COVID patient. wouldn't, wouldn't. like people think they've abandoned 2nd doses haven't. seems month they've giving huge number 2nd doses. they're definitely still 2nd doses longer gap. Considering bad situation December/January understand why. Arguably worked well believe Indian variant double mutation, makes much contagious allows faster spreading. Time super-spread events. Problem approach already started inviting 58 59 year olds Pfizer mid-May 50+ largely invited Pfizer. 

I think combination donating doses giving second shots earlier 12 weeks best option. needle fear anything pain, try get lidocaine. Put maybe 20 minutes beforehand. makes skin numb. I‚Äôm sure effectiveness over-the-counter lidocaine. experience prescription lidocaine. Maybe doctor prescribe help get vaccinated. Get live life. People Reddit hate hearing truth! personal experience, yes, haven‚Äôt seen anything officially saying that. here! 
Got infected first dose still haven‚Äôt got second dose yet know much Indian variant concern vaccines? think argument sort loses punch vaccine supply today. plenty doses available folks eligible, even ""locked down"" getting shot going deprive someone higher risk.

And reality eventually, something likely bring hermit like basement. family member dying, emergency requires exposure higher risk. even masked folks exposed long enough certain environment catch vaccinated. might already level. Massive reporting likely going due lack resources etc. testing capacity could definitely reach Give 20 hours, least took me, side effects less 24 hours. confusion isnt much thus second wave, abour first wave really happening first place. makes complete sense India hit hard.  first time awhile, it‚Äôs easy excited future. Maybe it‚Äôs weather maybe vaccine, things seem inching towards normal daily basis, excellent. complete normal calculus people wearing masks, scarce media coverage covid, little things like restaurants sanitizing every customer stuff like that. 

I agree almost everything open hit vaccine wall, think it‚Äôs going take year people return true pre-pandemic normal smaller actions. I'm failing understand why? Like get huge risk India poses Australia pretty good quarantine system everyone quarantine hotel 14 days allowed enter country normal? Surely would good enough stop community transmission Indian variant getting Australia guess wrong. Partially vaccine developers media blame this. Especially media reported 100% protection hospitalization death based pitiful amount data. 

I pretty bothered lack nuance back see leads shitty situations. That‚Äôs kinda would expect millions getting vaccinated daily. symptoms second shot (usually) much pronounced first. many accounts see awful second shot symptoms social media, might people avoiding second shot response it. reddit people hating haters here. Tell Jio roll 4G properly first Couple things, 52% includes day 1 receiving vaccine. 80% CDC day 14 after. thing actually show expect. take 2 weeks build substantial protection. Also long one dose provides half protection two doses, every 14+ day one dose study shows, two people receiving one dose provides better community protection one person receiving two doses. could possibly reduce age requirement. countries think limited 50+ could potentially give 50s well. Otherwise probably best give countries need them. Amazing comments right saying US help austere, got negative karma. Even wealthy countries exploited much poor countries like India many others. community absolute garbage. skipped 2nd dose since covid person ignorant then. everyone India got infected, even 99% survival rate, would still mean almost 14 **million** people dead. People still buy bad really was. Maybe offer 3-in-1 bundle Trump Modi present challenges rules. 

How discuss painting banned bringing painter paint? policies harm overall population objectively leads deaths them. People staying house, affraid going out, 

Pretty much huge bunch bullshit suggest lockdown policies kept people inside personal risk calculation individuals. Sweden never locked down, still vastly reduced mobility economic growth people want risk gulping air like fish water could go eat. US basically voluntary lockdown states June, restaurants, bars gyms open - vastly less used pandemic know someone died long hauler. kids school open since September, 30% kids go person. like going eat, sure hell worth risk I'm vaccinated. Huh even worry people getting 2nd dose? mean they've first dose they're probably going go back 2nd dose willing get vaccinated first place Vaccines work. wonders never cease? Get vaccinated America!

In news water wet sun came morning. Classic CNN reader would view good news clear, parties pass virus. higher transmission rate well worse severity non-vaccinated parties. 

Higher insurance rates (health insurance 
short term disability) one factor. also look sick leave usage employee (and immediate family), loss productivity, environmental cleaning, differences safety regulations pertaining two different standards vaccinated vs unvaccinated. cost money company. 

The insurance cost one thing business owners like look bottom line. Secondly, money. also creating safe environment employees. live one counties. everything opened again, re-joined gym. Quickly noticed number people working wearing face sheilds mask. asked refund, learning acceptable OSHA state. WTF? disease passed aerosols place people forcefully exhaling? could go wrong?

I suggesting sole cause.....lots science deniers live taken seriously day 1. sure hell help. State going make rules based science, consistency heaven's sake.

And FYI, work industry high risk (dentistry), made transmission employees take science seriously. Difference India china ""great firewall China""

Have feeling China / bad guess fine sir  vaccine rollout I. us huge success probably biggest world far CDC recommends arrive countries Damn one saying dont get second shot. hold people want vaccine get 1 shot. UK Canada seems might getting better bang buck US. Well, indonesia still First Waves spread really make lot sense. 4-6 weeks going hit absolute wall vaccinations. either something break wall open everything point. ""waiting"" another 6-9 months completely pointless worst possible option. couple developed countries higher reported covid-19 deaths excess deaths. expected though, flu deaths reduced essentially zero, COVID-19 took lives many likely die causes long after. excess deaths clearly show COVID-19 took lives far many close ""already deathbed"", argue.   fair, year ago, nobody really knew going on. March/April lot unknowns, shit actually frightening. Even then, 500,000 people died US alone, like, worry panic justified. many people skipping second dose?? selfish part! great news US least:

Let's name calling now. sensible people wanna change opinion facts shudnt shame them. 

I'm centre right even cant support shit. Give 1000 crore scams back. I'd take this. Total deaths since beginning covid (so late 2019) definitely well 7 digit range (and maybe even higher worldwide death toll) Yeah experience well. COVID-19 December, waited little 3 months get 1st shot felt it, terrible. second shot worse me. two sinus infections since can't seem kick normal me. Bodies definitely weird. realize argument ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care government spying citizens, nothing hide‚Äù? part returning normal life enough incentive. last year shown politicians everywhere don‚Äôt care people. think Serbia issues numbers low push election week later exploded. US UK ‚Äúbut economy!‚Äù idiots. way think ***if exposed covid*** (e.g. step elevator someone suffering covid space), 95 times 100 get it.

in practice, number times exposed covid /way/ lower, that's we're seeing numbers resemble tiny fractions % vs vaccinated population, 100% chances getting definitely trends much closer towards 100% 95%. finite number variants occur. 

We boosters address variants.

Everyone, long run, likely form immunity - natural, via vaccination. takes away advantages novel virus naive population. 

No pandemic history ever lasted forever. Since I'm obese getting shot. I'd rather long term effects experiment someone got stupid idea vaccinated people ‚Äúshedding‚Äù spike proteins non-vaccinated people. issue idea boomer age groups politically active (especially regards turnout elections) typically vote conservative-leaning parties. party power explicitly left-leaning one would crippling voter funding base years come.

Yes death rate 70 1000 times higher 30 years old discriminate age. personally second shot cancelled cause pharmacy got wrong shipment. searched searched replacement always fully booked one needed (Moderna). it‚Äôs two months can‚Äôt find conclusive information whether it‚Äôs late :/ Tis popular method denial.  right sorry. Get shot don‚Äôt get shot.   address main point, lockdown policies caused economic slow down, personal calculation health risk many individuals.

Actually last paragraph. probably decided read message. large? knows? Companies individuals staying afloat important.

Never claimed response. Also, ""lockdown"" doesnt even remotely mean thing everywhere every place same.

To copy+paste different response:

What would actually interesting would local specifics incredibly hard know given country foreigner. matter greatly often completely dismissed favour idiotic (sorry, feel is) pro anti-lockdown blanket approach.

In case country (Greece) far 6 straight months lockdown (!), cant go outside without sending sms, arent allowed move next municipality car sometimes even foot, curfew sometimes starts 18.00 usually 21.00, majority economy closed Greece economy highly industrialised close ""non-essential"" bits close it, police authoritarian HUGE pro-democracy protest etc etc. situation hospitals various details worth considering example: Gov decided hire necessary ammount nurses, decided divert people completely different medical specializations covid units ripped hundreds private general doctors (when vocal doctors arguing gov organize strengthen first line healthcare order people end hospitals) put hospitals completely irrelevant know positions etc etc.

I mean feel way many people see think... ""Putin bad didnt enough lockdowns"" bet infinetely complicated differences opinion best courses action. ever question he‚Äôs responsible shit? think need buy whiskey scotch. *confirmed* cases LoL yeah ignore problem, go away Start opening they‚Äôre still finding 25k people testing positive day. Yeh.. go well üòë Ivermectin? dewormed called treatment respiratory virus? Yeah watching flight India, fat late. I'm thinking booster (for vaccinated). hopefully works. 
The thing sucks screwed first time (outbreak Wuhan) thing learned masks suck. 
I think many people look India ""over there"" reality here. Fauci fully vaccinated yet prancing around two masks. Also, viral transmission outside minimal, fuck CDC recommend wear mask outside alone? message ""get vaccine things return normal"" would people willing take it. would make people dangerous? need bite kind radioactive vermin.

FDA approving addictive chemicals children's food? think messed Coca-Cola caffeine, opens airways makes dependent it, high fructose corn syrup makes obese, depresses airways, means whenever exercise try lose weight, kicks Coke craving able breathe energy exercise makes gain weight? market children? good arguments left, said, there's excuse obese still. fear mongering articles short actual data.

OMG hospitalizations 40 80% since January! 

is different than

OMG - hospitalizations 40 went 5 9 since January. Yes, I'm aware vaccine timeline kids. specified elementary age children. know people maintain argument affect young kids much, things keep changing. Young kids hit pretty hard variant India case Pennsylvania variant affecting elementary age kids. recent school study Omaha showed consistent levels COVID present air sewage infection rates six times higher reported among students. So, issue IMHO, matter new variants taking hold classroom.

The CDC already updated school distancing guidelines 6ft 3ft, MIT said distance matter circulating indoors. lot confidence choices made local level.  80 got vaccinated. 40 didn't. simple. want leave house favor, get vaccinated. COVID-19 clinical update #60, Daniel Griffin summarizes CDC guidance summer camps, protect fully vaccinated, updated recommendation J&amp;J vaccine, declining global case fatality rate, characterization post-acute sequelae. recommendation doctor? immune response COVID infection vaccine‚Äôs response. four endemic coronaviruses. Hopefully one becomes mostly benign are, seems like leap faith me. Young people still need get vaccinated, though. moral obligation try wipe thing out. settle 85% lower chance giving loved one deadly disease, would like risk reduction closer 100%? I'm sure I'm following here. stating belief public authorities media report whatever makes people likely comply public health regardless whether communication clear accurate possible? think you‚Äôre talking bad reactions 6 months later, don‚Äôt know separate data noise.  Okay, that's understandable reason miss second dose. obviously, must find way get around get second dose, soon possible. lead paragraph:

 Viruses need entry proteins penetrate cells replicate. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) version called spike protein. protein, also target current vaccines, quickly adapting new human hosts. took first major step direction early 2020, amino acid 614 (of 1297) changed aspartic acid (D) glycine (G). Viruses bearing D614G mutation transmit among humans rapidly form majority circulation. page 525 issue, Zhang *et al.* use careful structural analyses reveal D614G changed protein accelerate pandemic. word confused about? Back January thought pretty reasonable guess! assumption vaccine rollout would lot slower ended being, we'd ""peak"" around June/July instead April. Yes good point. wrote fly (at work lol). Guess im sick seeing bad headlines day day equal better Pfizer Moderna jabs I‚Äôll reassess. aren‚Äôt yet.  I‚Äôm make normal I‚Äôm able go anywhere without mask that‚Äôs pretty much normal me. doubt I‚Äôll able stop wearing mask school end school year June 18, think we‚Äôll getting close. US whole week 60k new cases per day. today less 50k new cases, 7 day average 50k. History?

I can‚Äôt think single person would vote YES government spying people, are. politicians keep getting re-elected. patriot act keeps getting renewed.  Tens thousands more. Oh absolutely, whole thing insane   virus won‚Äôt even want there. it‚Äôs plot make people comply restrictions imposed public authorities?

Restrictions followed public anyway? 

For greater good? Public health? Something like that? know of. Contract tracing US non-existent useless.  Give people tangible reward vaccination, that‚Äôll remove vaccine hesitancy saying masks end sight give people idea doesn‚Äôt make difference.  
 
Vaccine = mask requirements, that‚Äôs best way remove hesitancy.  mean people say ‚Äúmy vaccine immune system‚Äù could wrong? Shocking. 4 million Americans vaccinated per day July? Yeah that‚Äôs happening. hurrah younger people getting super ill also, presumably older population received full vaccination longer succumbing worst covid point hospitalization. 

The hope, course, every age group becomes fully vaccinated severe hospitalizations drop nil. UK. Even BBC got action lying bullshit, supposed responsible news source. 
 
These stories around since beginning pandemic 100% coordinated attempt scaremonger young people sacrificing years life virus posed little threat them. swear people want restrictions forever, great news Thank you. know, that's asked example another, think one. agreeing still dick? comment originally replied said guarantee FDA approved ones

So asked example support ""guarantee""  means share younger people higher, older population vaccinated hospitalized anymore. things trump admin said chance survival someone young much higher. real reason celebration vaccines work higher proportion older population received theirs, hence drop hospitalisation rates.

You‚Äôll find overall hospitalisation rates dropping, rates younger people increasing. kind variant currently spread Michigan States? B.1.1.7 Variant? would also curious know % people 40 hospitalized issues make susceptible. Pre-existing health issues, obesity, etc. judging anyone, wondering many under-40's hospitalized healthy physically fit people. I'm guessing tiny number. Exactly. That's countries favor older people comorbidities, know younger folks get infected develop natural immunity without causing much load health system. long run though, they'll try vaccinate well limit impact future variants slow spread disease societies. don‚Äôt think anyone saved going mind. good news would everything control, pandemic masks longer needed. obesity? I'm kind confused word created. I'll admit point needle stick takes like one second. look away process relax arm. mild fever night went sleep gone next morning. means vaccines working older people received first. go mRNA route, development now, everything goes well set release Q3-4 year. called ARCoV vaccine, made Walvax Biotechnology, Suzhou Abogen Biosciences, PLA Academy Military Science. started building manufactutring facility (120mil dose) back article: ‚ÄúWe're seeing people 30s, 40s 50s ‚Äî young people really sick.‚Äù

There's literally quote like every month/week since start pandemic. Can't blame anyone believing first there's something wrong still can't see now. absolutely strategy scare/mislead young people complying restrictions despite risk minimal. fear gets young people asses vaccinated might worth time. strong evidence vaccine works, worth young people get it. Exactly. nothing chances ending hospitalized 40. truth. guess people want consider side it. course, could also deduce vaccines working older folks Michigan. truth also. one truth acceptable say loud depending audience. Silly. watching weekly covid CE past week. talking kept seeing lot college students skipping dose 2. Hopefully they‚Äôll get eventually geniuses made many younger college aged people would getting dose two finals. open eligible people US now? Everyone opportunity now.  similar. tried medicine take Tylenol. headache much lot places ""restaurant policy."" take mask working out. I‚Äôm kindve confused it‚Äôs better young people hospital? funny though also want vaccinate once. think Blue Jays players miss games vaccine related side affects. They‚Äôre tired staying best years lives. stayed locked year could save grandma‚Äôs life grandma vaccinated don‚Äôt give fuck anymore can‚Äôt say blame them. Really wish they‚Äôd get vaccinated, though! big problem, maybe vaccine providers let sign second dose even get first them?

I moved huge hassle. None nearby options would let second dose. joke. already got Pfizer doses doctor say? Ah really. Things China control early last May. parents started travelling within China time....I told wear masks always forgot to... got second dose Thursday. put Friday. 103.5 fever. Splitting brutal headache energy. Saturday morning I'm pretty much fine. unpleasant, hell yeah, bad.

Having strep years ago way way worse.  lot great scientific studies guide people towards smartest course action. Unfortunately, large majority people read big bold bullet points CDC website take gospel. CDC says get second dose, try explain one people ‚ÄúAKSHUALLY‚Äù don‚Äôt really need second dose COVID, they‚Äôll look like said Trump still president Biden movie set.  assume trying spread shots bit well. Teams want players missing games time. 

I believe Blue Jays players miss game vaccine related symptoms. Good job Michigan!!! Atta boy!! True, true. PM really screwed procuring antivirus, every bit helps. Thanks EU well. I‚Äôm hoping September 2021 I‚Äôm afraid could extended end 2021 even indefinitely. 

(Work teaching young children Canada. could sadly see arguments going forward ‚Äúchildren aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet never know/why wouldn‚Äôt want prevent spread colds flus wear masks forever‚Äù.

Mid/late June target 2nd shots, 18+ first shots looking like finished end May. like want people die 

It's true. want remove elderly clog society sitting retirement homes. want young people less elderly productive workforce. anti-vaccination procrastinating long possible perfect way that. Lmao fetish account bud, started convo account got second dose noon Friday. want know list. ‚ÄúVaccacine‚Äù word. Every little bit helps. issue last president, though board new one, really helps   Okay, two year old account 68 karma. Percentage older patients dropping total numbers younger people terms cases hospitalization up. It‚Äôs clear that‚Äôs changes virus changes population behavior though Many get transferred dire condition. happening live entire pandemic. unfortunate situation solution people getting vaccinated letting everybody get thing. can't really force people get vaccine rapidly end day know someone predict future, let know. I‚Äôd like know tomorrow‚Äôs lotto numbers. I'm American. people draggin feet refusing vaccine start exporting asap. Actually no, think great thing US mean, even actually true, could shedding spike proteins people? live virus. 

The whole shedding live virus stupid too, made sense this. expecting immunologists frequent sub reply.   know dude fit terrible kidney problems years taking GNC workout supplements like creatine powder junk. people appear fit doesn‚Äôt mean healthy.  violent extremists. might consider therapy kid though. Medical trauma lasting effects true hero another men r/nothingeverhappens Yes, 2 moar weeks! November 1st. I'm cautious state too. votes. annoying first get used Second dose Wednesday, felt like shit Thursday (102 fever) felt 90 percent better Friday. 

While feeling like shit Thursday kept thinking ‚Äúit‚Äôs better Covid know body it‚Äôs supposed do‚Äù 

I also kept thinking marvelous mRNA vaccine I‚Äôm taking part could well future vaccine technology. Real talk, *is* cathartic. sounds like every country‚Äôs ignorance point. Especially America‚Äôs ignorance.  I‚Äôd imagine would different story place lived voted different way. sources that? thought Indian variant wasn‚Äôt different UK variant i.e. slightly transmissible deadly. hard lockdown hundreds millions people extreme poverty. doctor said rest, take liquied lay think could higher 7 million 17 days scary part. Waiting people supposedly die vaccines, manufacturers revise vaccines. Repeat death risk acceptable level.

They're kind people would send others die them, like take bullets run minefield. Agreed, write headline. Great example fitness equal health. many factors go types conditions otherwise ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù people might susceptible to. 

Understanding concept really encourage young people go doctor regularly check ups even ‚Äúfeel fine‚Äù, don‚Äôt afraid ask tests you‚Äôre concerned something. Sometimes can‚Äôt show anything tests sometimes find predispositions abnormality hasn‚Äôt yet presented liminally.  I've read data-filled articles Covid seems attacking stomachs. least kids ending hospital. take much Littles get dehydrated. traditional covid. Verdict Indian variants dad see doctor.  first dose moderna fatigued slept extra entire week, got moderna arm.

I zero side effects second dose. Germany bad April 2020 got praised response, second wave disaster. Yes, can't speak drug companies distributing doses, country eventual goal vaccinating across age demographics break coronavirus's ability spread effectively.  course every little bit helps calling ""US keeps giving"" either sarcastic flat wrong. US barely started sharing anything. realm contractions, say anything goes It‚Äôs promising, need keep testing numbers meaningful.  found perception mostly older people. young people around age know signed soon could get vaccine. Yeah like wait see what? 50 million worldwide enough 100 million? knows. Could safe maybe not. Like wtf enough, is? See: essential oils  That's happened me. wife hand ass kicked  cases? Yup know every single person uses gym. strong moral obligation report facts blatantly lie people. 

You stress importance young people getting vaccinated without lying.   told news nothing consumer product, consumer product. wear one think end time soon even mask mandate gone. heat clients gets high hits pocketbook Well he‚Äôs right something. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating hard avoid arguments moment.  Always. Citizens can‚Äôt blocked wide general way. could ‚Äúrequired‚Äù quarantine US wouldn‚Äôt enforce it. MRNA already body, it‚Äôs key part normal cellular function.  Seems like young people may require scare tactics given common perception don‚Äôt need healthy.... Right? Imagine still complaining masks year later. We‚Äôre getting there, we‚Äôre opening everything slowly phasing masks different situations, shit like public transit airplanes last things lift mask requirements, there‚Äôs simply many people close quarters. they‚Äôd better get duffs get it. India variant seems lethal age groups.

i'm pretty sure strains COVID lethal age groups, really tell much without numbers Understood. know mRNA technology around decades, think trialed vaccines, never approved. But, mRNA already cells, it‚Äôs key function cellular function. key delivery mechanism mRNA molecule fragile.  


I get point allowing people choose, we‚Äôre getting non-mRNA vaccines soon larger quantities. there‚Äôs public interest people getting vaccinated protect us all. There‚Äôs debate personal interest vs public interest think neglected consider. Lying risk likely make people stop listening getting people vaccinated. got first. Let‚Äôs reach tipping point! used view philosopher...like LOOOONG time ago, much good shit say felt. like... hes another gross scientifically illiterate redneck. last time watched him, year ago listening years like ""whoa....is guy? happened him?"" Maybe always rednecky somehow just...didnt notice before. mean, good news raw case count bad metric. really need declining test positivity rates. think I‚Äôll wear seat belt. B117 recall reading. It‚Äôs pushed suppressed variants. He‚Äôs saying exactly mob wants say Fewer Probably worst headline I've seen r/coronavirus yet. young people getting vaccinated rate older people He‚Äôs idiot. good sport. People kept telling that. terrified even took extra day work. side effects doses. felt exact way. (Pfizer, second dose Thursday) we're is, we're working communities, we're working churches, we're working community centers, we're working Restaurant Associations, we're working large employers, going offering people vaccine.  we're finding even need reach more. Even yesterday, event one large hotels Galveston, vaccinators stopped get lunch way back, extra. asked people restaurant, want vaccine? people said, oh, yes, think would.  think that's we're going doing. We're going going people find people want unsure, really anxious get it, make easy available ask ‚Äî answer questions feel comfortable.""

Above quote Galveston County local health authority, Dr. Philip Keiser. Kudos extra effort. listen Brian Green? number one pet peeve science reporting focusing relative risk/change instead absolute risk/change. it‚Äôs dramatic headline panicked article, it‚Äôs always relative. One fit people know got COVID spent month hospital blood clots caused 'rona. Mid thirties. want anybody know either, kept saying never million years expect something like happen spoke him. god thought contraction, thought real word lmao. Honestly, sounds like tho  second dose nothing. skipped workouts next day, fine otherwise. 
But yeah, lot people lit it. Anecdotally, hear issues Moderna crowd. Laughs Europe. seriously support people getting vaccinated hope somehow manage themselves. US citizens India still return home?  Pretty sure movie this. Granted mine Moderna, second shot wednesday early afternoon. symptom day bit sore arm later night. next day arm felt like I'd torn muscle, worst second night me. miserable time woke Friday morning thing left arm feeling like bruise. bizarre self-defeating. thought would hate working mask, I've learned really matter. issue all, even all-out cardio. think actually underwear burnt balls something. AstraZeneca? one hasn‚Äôt approved US? doesn‚Äôt matter country produced it, whether it‚Äôs UK, US, China, Russia anywhere else. AZ, J J Sputnik similarly less ideal. They‚Äôre better nothing, course. Almost 600,000 dead. think issue afraid enough maybe not. one point view, 5%. different point view, millions people. points interest view correct. point people stop using ""it'll by"" argument? According them, like 30 times see, thought talking top comment.

Brazil rich country, makes sense they'd get expensive Pfizer vaccine started using cheaper ones. shithole country, gyms open people didn‚Äôt wear masks properly kicked out

Pretty easy tbh They're also 100 cases per day 2 deaths per day. They'll aiight. agree, however believe convince fence. Waaaah vaccine waaaah 5he virus over!!! excessive think virus causes security issues? Iean could create new dept think stopping terrorists? There‚Äôs nothing stopping virus becoming lethal dangerous, long also able spread effectively. higher viral load presymptomatic phase may cause increased spread, lethal disease later course infection. It‚Äôs law nature viruses evolve become less dangerous, selection pressure based effectively spread. virus spreads effectively presymptomatic period doesn‚Äôt care much happens later, symptomatic people staying home anyway infecting many people. normal times, people might mingle symptoms, virus mild enough encourage people still socialize others would advantage. world everybody sniffles staying home, type virus outcompete others one spread symptoms become apparent. announced today. So, right now. That's less restrictive like summer! could six people indoors back then. Since October, apart brief break Christmas, mixing households banned inside out.

Edit: don‚Äôt know hospitalization means. We‚Äôre kept observation? walk see doctor. Best info available UK B117 first identified. They‚Äôve dealing longest best data. 

Short answer looks like least 2 vaccines maintaining efficacy. Perhaps slightly degraded rates still high protection hospitalization  difference China fully reopen daily new cases reduced absolute zero month. limited chance second wave case. Decent understatement. Canadians feel J&amp;J vaccine? There's huge reluctance States take makes sense send it'll quickly dispensed. Otherwise it'll sitting refrigerator shelves weeks. Yes, hope restaurants keep curbside too. small kids car, life changing get car, go restaurant get food put back car. Considering 400 people died COVID time period, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs simple. can‚Äôt read report. Fox presents lot facts. often present way supports views want push, incite people certain behaviors.

Which exactly advocating news outlets reporting covid data deliberately disingenuous way order better manipulate people behaving way *you* think should.  Possibly, older people like 3-4 months get vaccines like weeks since opened people. Plus appointments still weeks book (at least Eastern PA) takes 1 month+ get full immunity. India getting already, know reading India articles sub, farming karma using ignorance? would hope many people 80 many left? thousand times people 40 admissions COVID-19 33% age 18 29

The raw number cases went 33%. go find numbers you, change anything learn went say 10,000 10,333? still say something ""extremely misleading"" i'm pretty sure COVID kill anyone, even good prior health, risk decent bit lower similar article without South Australia suspended flights due 14 cases single day, putting load medihotel move positive cases to. (a hotel airflow improvements, etc). despite negative pcrs travel.

Perth 3 day lockdown due spreading hotel someone leaving quarantine, across hallway, two closed doors. Lead first infections outside hotel quarantine since last April.

The Federal govt unwilling use federal remote facilities quarantine, supply financial aid cash strapped states - trying manage things using hotels middle cities. They're edge, number infections quarantine rises daily (despite negative tests shown boarding).

I think decision Feds abhorrent, would rather handled evacuees way Wuhan 12 months ago, use remote Federal facilities reduce risk zilch, anyway. are, hope provides context.    reminder, China's annual GDP five times India's.

Huh? Canada neighbor. would best interest people vaccinated regardless nationality.  Yeah, I'm saying gyms safe staying home, risk/reward especially young healthy people pretty good we're talking gyms. shit-show EU. friend (US citizen Iowa) living Italy working fly back Iowa get shot maybe stay second shot next year region. go listen plenty experts world telling people get vaccinated. Incredibly even need look towards US news source that.    percentage compared percentage still get COVID vaccinated? personally talked virologist working COVID NIH said need vaccine first year confirmed Covid. then, take vaccine. booster required year vaccinated well. love arm chairs scientists/doctors think know best. People refusing wear masks armchair scientists refuse vaccine.  Covid equally likely hire job regardless age. examples using vaccines causing long-term effects make cautious? bars open Michigan full unhealthy people, example. far understand it, expect virus become lethal time selection pressure it.

Wait studies confirm apparent changes basically. presenting facts deceitful? Fox News ever present facts? even let though. I'm Hungarian living UK waiting vaccination, even I'd get fly back home meet friends family, accept vaccination another country (yet?) enter cinemas, indoor pubs etc Bhaag chu** recently (like weeks ago) vaccine even opened everyone (at least PA), understandable people gotten yet. Still trivial get appointment places either. lot people view COVID misinformation acceptable pushes people get vaccinated something along lines.

You idea ‚Äúexperts‚Äù aren‚Äôt picked CNN saying. single clue anecdotal, friend Brazil died age 35 due COVID. Healthy person before.  must missed 19 years covid 19 data. He's Oprah Hunter. I'm bit puzzled one point though. measure much young people getting vaccinated, versus much possibly new strains hit young people harder earlier strains? second shots? wait three weeks travel second time? Many. Many many. Yep. sick population issue, making anyone who's healthy takes care pay. people seem get shutting society actually harms millions people.

Oh well, fear mindset. taking liberties wording.

So, git gud... uh, git patient. exclusively young people whole conservative segment population. 

I work entire warehouse full idiots refusing vaccine. literally passing around covid every couple weeks. get vaccine fast enough.  I‚Äôll respond effectively communicate thoughts. word salad. Maybe wishful thinking, don‚Äôt really many choices, we? assume take things face value? Regardless saying falls line truth, medical professional.

I.e. Gwyneth Paltrow advocate vaccines expressed trust endorsement COVID-19 Vaccine. also said eating kimchi drinking kombucha effective countermeasure COVID-19.

Should trust said 50% claims false, note background understanding infectious disease mitigation.

Even correct (about vaccine), isn‚Äôt trustworthy source.  even liberal progressive California there's appetite vaccine passports. libertarian faction vocal even private establishments event-spaces consider it. see requirements either vaccine recent Negative test enter. might see venues publicize certain days specifically Vaccinated, kind like Senior nights, highly targeted sites like art-house/indie movie theaters specialty gyms, cautious older clientele. Probably half people know never went store almost never went (in NY). way deciding whether take vaccine scientific decision decision based scientific facts.

It‚Äôs semantics. Actually think millions people harmed lockdown. think care. someone chooses vaccine that's choice, harming anyone.

If believe fear mindset helps people, giver. Pfizer - Moderna vial (10 doses) punctured, 6 hours use it. pfizer one thrown realize privy contract details. Enlighten us please. Yes, non-vaccinated accepted risk declining inordinate amount vaccine offers almost every American already gotten. accept risk. anecdotal experience several hundred covid patients, obese patients get worst. correlates lot problems like hypertension diabetes, it‚Äôs really obesity general. need Ted talk that. look conservative talking heads mimic do. need make enough noise get enough following remaining Koch brother notice start bankrolling you.  Michigan opened vaccination everyone 16+ April 5. Even got appointment first day (unlikely), people got Pfizer Moderna full immunity another two three weeks respectively. 

That said, vaccine hesitancy definitely problem going forward.  right violated justifies removal right custody kid? virus kill children like lifestyle choices would lot change risks infection anyways. virus endemic. drive car?    It‚Äôs good sense means older people dying. it‚Äôs bad sense we‚Äôve led believe young people virtually immune   disgusting. again.

Statistics great understanding trends population. They're great forming policy address entire states, countries, etc. Statistics really helpful assessing personal risk. apply statistics individual things break down, immesurably large number nuances, external factors, biases, micro-climates like unalike people, make statistics pretty much useless. Unless statistics examine sufficiently large population people exactly like also surrounded people exactly like ones surrounded by, actually getting helpful information data. 

You can't apply trends macro demographic scale individual. That's they're for, especially extremes so, well, extreme. right general, average young person pretty safe covid, unless know close average are, OK consequences long term health issues death, pretty useless piece information. could also vaccinated end getting covid without knowing infecting number people.

And know difference is? vaccinated person taken necessary precautions, done part reduce risk transmitting virus much possible (something refuse do). unvaccinated person defying public health recommendations putting others *unnecessary risk.* can't prevent 100% take precautions, vaccine important precaution. putting others extra risk necessary getting vaccine. basic concept, dude.  They're rich country based average wages would equivalent American shell like $350 two doses even paying $20 per monumental   numbers severely under-reported undercounted. positivity rates ranging mid-teens 30s many large cities, likely confirmed numbers fraction actual toll. 

With weak public health infrastructure India, probably impossible capture cases deaths. We'll probably need wait seroprevalence studies done independent organizations determine full toll India facing.  This.

Not counting eggs hatch I'm feelin real good mostly normal summer! know may adjust things earlier. However, cannot shake feeling point time, last people need get fence hesitancy (people wont get vaccine believe restrictions wont ever go away) need additional carrot? point telling people ‚Äúhey, get vaccine tell friends get certain benchmark, masks want!‚Äù  gym super anal mask thing whole year now. 

Whether masks enforced locale-dependent. healthier tends mean stronger immune system

OTOH, might higher-risk group b/c gym? Also stronger immune system might might strongly affect chances spreader..

Also:

1. People spend significant amounts time gyms

2. Lockerrooms/showers tend fairly crowded

3. People breath heavily

All-in-all, I'd definitely rate gyms higher risk environment   Yes.

They already learning. Maybe people protect let people live choose? kinda see coming think fair article. There's thing 0 bias. 700-900 deaths per day, 50-70,000 cases per day...yeah fucking mind.

Simultaneously, could also vaccinated end getting covid without knowing infecting number people.


Quantifiably, scenario results higher chance asymptomatic spread?

A, unvaccinated individual religiously wears masks, consents asymtomatic bi-weekly PCR testing.

B, vaccinated individual per CDC guidance longer needs wear mask outdoors, never completes COVID testing. 

If answer a, much higher risk person scenario created person scenario b? Remember, use quantifiable statistics, personal biases opinions. diminish time. Furthermore, populated areas matter most, areas highly vaccinated. logic completely off. would healthy nurse cause sick patient get sicker?

I still wear everywhere mandated course. ""Admissions"" means *admitted*. 

In practical terms, means showed ER, saw doctor, doctor thought condition serious enough require hospitalization, another doctor saw file agreed admit them.

So include anyone discharged directly ER, even held temporarily observation. India also highly effective vaccine need ramp production everyone vaccinated WHY?! piece cake. flu shots immunizations years, there's nothing worry about. last two years, several shots various things like flu, pneumonia, hepatitis, things PREVENT getting illnesses.

For me, great relief made happy wife grown kids also received injections. anxiety level gone waaaaay down. Now, us, routines getting back normal. Yup, Pretending Rogan interesting guests lying yourself. There's wide spectrum mind putting people's kids risk all. Thank arguing right side fight. know learn anything experience.

Sounds like two left over. possible right there's nothing stopping exactly. Also fair point lockdown might change pressures bit. think we've seen virus suddenly get lethal though, correct I'm wrong.

Hospitalizations ever good, regardless age. means symptoms bad.

I would agree better young people higher percentage case count though. Controversial claim: rich powerful boast getting vaccinated without shamed skipping lines.

There vaccines available rather drop age incrementally, made free all. I'm supportive 2 shots. understand guidance 2 shot regimen likely immune 50% entire time still suggests stay isolated 6 weeks, J&amp;J 50% pretty much flat 2 weeks get level immunity enough. dumb. biggest reason demographic shift, experts say: difference vaccination rates.

However think ever cares himself. reason know family vaccinated leaked. Sad that's took, even though cat bag nobody last name Trump save niece come speak truth it. Lies, damn lies, statistics   worry mutations. one things technically possible something experts need worry worst case scenario unless we're meltdown. cases generally falling becomes less concern.

Add natural immunity whatever vaccinated number (which despite demand falling, still slowly adding people) still reach herd immunity point summer. It'll better kids allowed vaccinate.

Also, we've done terribly truly estimating herd immunity. India thought relying herd immunity wrong approach assume sort base level US terrible waves. gather he's person, put much stock normal person. Who‚Äôs this? What‚Äôs thought process? due specific selective pressure. global spread Spanish flu die soldiers fighting WW1. milder versions flu recovered near stationed, whole severe versions often sent home, allowing variants spread much widely.

So, absolutely right possible, bit normal evolution virus. Oh sure Nearly young people job refused free vaccines. Ymmv aren‚Äôt enough vaccinated yet , especially doses, we‚Äôll see exponential growth, likely mutations , way deaths. Unless don‚Äôt believe scientific modelling.

Just something common, still want know information ... able make -informed- decisions based facts. Ann Arbor like 70-30 Dem, Kalamazoo worst 50-50 quarter vaccineless people state gotten first shot can't take time since they're essential.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Got 2nd vaccine yesterday. Feel like hangover. Great questions! 

1. BS engineering, work research development. job review literature apply techniques solving new problems. scientifically literate strong background applied statistics data ananlysis

2. unable find raw data relating safety efficacy vaccines biggest concern currently have. FDA publish findings full approval vaccines completed

3. found long term effects possible injection, vaccines simply long enough data exist. Lack data sufficient basis make conclusions long-term safety/efficacy.

4. 2 years number feel confident that's roughly twice length time vaccines existed point. Furthermore, liely FDA either given extended EUA, revoked EUA point. Well never expected see Survivor reference subreddit lmfao California well matter look it. 

What absurd thing say. California well metric. covid hotspot world past winter. We're middle pack far death rates go US, something proud considering badly US hit. economic impact terrible too, California one highest unemployment rates US, tons local businesses gone forever, homeless crisis gotten way worse past year. can't believe anyone would say done well. 


Northern California done well, sure, that's one part state. Southern California truly devestated. thought HCQ/Ivermectin would make didn‚Äôt use NPI‚Äôs.

Why distance ‚Äúthe cure.‚Äù

Except well it‚Äôs cure all. Thanks advice. Passed along. She‚Äôll get test done see doc says. Based reported, India Brazil 155 1,891 deaths per million. seem comparable.

Even Belgium, Czech Republic, Italy higher rates death Brazil. Spain, Portugal, France trailing 1,672 1,601 deaths per million well. comment purposefully scaring public data reflects different reality one presented. people like insist discrediting vaccine safety measures? 

Seriously, look ridiculous rest us this.  shocked Kenneth Copeland tried argue that. Bots active lol also state group extremists dislike lockdown planned kidnap governor... part countries accepting people high antibodies instead using negative Covid tests could discriminatory people certain autoimmune conditions doctors think vaccines won‚Äôt create many antibodies them. Lol bots got switched angry old alcoholics oxy addicts instead.

Because that's essentially became, least opinions. stopped listening 5 years ago became angry, increasingly sexist, way opinionated given level knowledge times I've listened heard others he's gotten worse areas. turned angry old crank far often gets people similar personality confirm biases. help Joe Rogan told young people get vaccinated need it. wish people would listen actual doctors. huge difference Israel‚Äôs green pass system states doing. can‚Äôt tell you‚Äôre obtuse purpose lack knowledge, point don‚Äôt think matters since you‚Äôre making consistent arguments anyway. Yeah, yeah, vaccines smooth trying convince everyone, people's fault. What, blood clots caused anxiety too?  Yes India one this, US always forthcoming pits dug. /s

Let's bring Cheena coz bots start job. Supposedly pfizer deliver next months, 2M+ next month 12M June.

That‚Äôs lot, surely help. Meanwhile two laboratories making vaccines Brazil leading vaccinations. can't exercise bad diet. Weight loss starts eating habits supplemented N.E.A.T activity work outs. he‚Äôs grim reaper. suspect newer variants causing higher viral load previous versions virus. time studies.

The original studies done emergency authorization ones determined mRNA vaccines minimum, 50% effective 3 weeks every case. that's even true. 

The fact is, CDC can't trusted provide consistent guidance based science. J&amp;J vaccinated person fine go day unmasked 50% protection 2 weeks, mRNA vaccinated people *at minimum* 50% 2 weeks wait 6 weeks? 

It's bullshit undermines credibility CDC guidance know listening point. Darwinism work. And? don‚Äôt particularly care Chamath. knowing makes care even less guy **and** makes think he‚Äôs moron got lucky.

Edit. initial comment follow is/was towards **you** personally. towards wanting recall identifying morons.  getting number from? still believe Gates trying kill them. understand think Bill Gates would want kill them?
I get it.  first dose, took ibuprofen really helped arm pain general discomfort. anyone know this? experience thought mostly learning enough politics notice BS. find video interesting follow initial remark. Awesome NJ! long people wear mask. 

That's missing piece data. literally everyone else gym wear mask gym equitable clean air flow compared outdoors? chance spread increases, quite dramatically fewer safety measures enacted. health far understand correlation *catching* covid, correlation dying it. I‚Äôll skip first one think fact population even common cold flu last year means us might forget vaccine side effects still milder basically almost anything else might get year. China obviously underreported deaths, better job containing spread almost country appropriate comparison Oregon Washington State. highly populated areas California ton San Francisco. simplest explanation usually correct one. fact immunity much better natural infection people willing admit  realize 7 day average vaccines administered 1mil Biden took office? trajectory vaccine roll change one bit. 3 day average deaths whopping 3 (three). 

And say 

‚ÄúBuh Actually deaths follow cases!!!!‚Äù

Not vaccine don‚Äôt‚Äîpeople said rate continued decreasing Nope. all. you‚Äôre new punk rock counter culture either. You‚Äôve manipulated long believing actually buy now. Sad....

Good luck becoming victim want badly be. noble pursuit, doubt. reason surge simple simply fewer people got virus almost anywhere else haven‚Äôt proven vary person person depending age immune system.

There evidence suggest greater 50%. guess. 

The fact is, ask evidence points treating someone first shot mRNA vaccines identical getting J&amp;J: considered vaccinated participate vaccinated rules 2 weeks, regardless vaccine, long getting second shot within recommended window.

The point is, CDC, again, undermining credibility actually depending science, *lying* public safe unclear political purpose. Anyone simple understanding knows clearly inconsistent *science,* generates mistrust. 

I longer listen CDC, read studies. CDC can't assed make recommendations actually follow science. Hi, I've asked question gotten reply asking again:

So whole family got Covid. thing mom brother got week earlier close recovered. cough lost sense smell taste. okay near chance get affected me? Sorry stupid question.  LOL like it! still become infected spread virus fully vaccinated. Hell, still die covid fully vaccinated. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infection. Hospitals around country dealing multiple breakthrough cases every week. 

Wear damn mask. Yes indeed! Gonna many people putting hospital worse enough people vaccinated fully open society again.

I never understand level stupid.  India seemed handled virus pretty well year. Vaccinating canadians helps states cause biggest export market completely fail understand people oppose safety measures, social distancing masks, desire reopen, also opposed vaccine.

If get vaccinated it'll win-win situation: governments reopen safely, even dropping masks, numbers keep tumbling down. Log\_10 1 = 0

Log\_10 10 = 1

Log\_10 7 = .85

You're basically arguing .85 closer 0 1 right now. Indian variant blame many people alive 40? many people alive 80? Exactly. normalization important data science statistics.

Another failure American education system. commonly hear stance along lines fuck math topic basic arithmetic, I'll never need it, calculator pocket. bottom national rankings vaccination rates Friday, numbers heading wrong 32 percent Alabama‚Äôs population gotten least one dose COVID vaccine, according data Center Disease Control Prevention. put Alabama ahead one state, neighboring comes full vaccinations, require second shot Moderna Pfizer, 21 percent Alabamians completely vaccinated. That‚Äôs lowest mark nation. US herd immunity june, current US capacity would assume canada finished week two (much smaller population)

So yes depends heavily getting tested, results repeats universities workplaces, metric really left hospitalizations deaths. see many random people getting tested anymore, public sites quite empty. would really like food service keep wearing after. One thing pandemic made aware much strangers breathing food restaurants. Seriously, world 7x considered ""on order magnitude""? highly misleading.

People say ""same order magnitude"" things 0.5-2x much something, remind people figures grossly line other. soon something 3x more, think becomes misleading slap logarithm figures pretend they're same.

7x also much closer 10x 1x, even logarithmically speaking, closer another order magnitude anyway. Israel UK were/are lockdown rollout happening. seems US mostly open, takes longer vaccines bring deaths cases negligible levels. like China crematoriums running 24/7 urns ashes claimed. 

April 3, 2020- multiply four basically.. others thread understand *pan-* pandemic means? Even US got 100% population vaccinated things went back normal, highly transmissible potentially vaccine resistant strain arrives country *boom* another pandemic begins.

Also, extremely naive think coronavirus vaccine research, happening decade, done US. There's way global collaboration vaccine research development general people like others thread like give credit for. Thats impressive! verfied independent source cause idk trust CCP  we're already, we'll soon place fair assumption adults get sick COVID made choice get vaccinated.  point vaccines even effective? multiple variants double mutation india, effective vaccines now? randomly came last night press conference guidance DC Twitter is...a bit confused right now. Presumably Mayor Bowser say...something clarify...any soon. happy proven wrong. Really. 

But people keep head they‚Äôre told. obey boss matter dumb rules are. 

Here example:
You put mask on, walk restaurant take eat. don‚Äôt scientist see it‚Äôs bat-shot crazy. rule makes absolutely sense, yet are. genuinely can‚Äôt imagine going life thinking human life cheap expendable. numbers see anyway aren‚Äôt even terrible think they're partying friends rather working jobs workable home (food server, warehouse, etc.). small minded Lol. Reddit absurd. ‚ÄúEveryone responsibility get vaccinated‚Äù racist? gazillion ways work gym. know ""exactly same"" even can't afford weights ways use body weight, etc. running, walking outside. started walking around five miles day quarantine -- even winter NYC. actually felt great. Totally recommend :)  gotta stop trying take masks people.. pandemic far fucking over.. jesus. think Canada/US border realistic chance reopening summer? scares me. I‚Äôm Los Angeles moving yellow phase Monday last step fully opening up. last thing want people Michigan f‚Äôing up.   aware that. That's great! like giving people benefit doubt. Given people taken first dose, they're obviously hesitant. must convenience way. india vaccination coverage 1%. old people vaccinated. Yet new strain hitting young people (35-45) hard, vengence seen earlier wave. Multiple friends mine india hospitalized, luckily survived bad illness Probably 6 8 weeks since vaccinations easily available Portland recently. opened vaccines everyone 19th, give group fair chance get vaccinated. Yeah, take two days work deal side effects. Fortunately time everyone does. vaccination rate right top national average. way recent surge due vaccine hesitancy. 800 per day 8x higher 100 far disastrous? top 100 number based mathematical models overestimate number flu deaths actual laboratory tests. look probable cases influenza death certificates hospital deaths. US estimate. UN annual estimate influenza **worldwide** deaths(290k-650k) almost much total number deaths coronavirus usa alone. im really confused get 10x less deadly flu.

If comparing current data coeonavieus vs flu currently flu almost erradicated health measures, even saying makes sense. 

And saying assuming new variant even worse, would extremely optimistic since currently variant mutation self correction gene makes mutations variants way likely. want? say ‚Äúthe variant India‚Äù. It‚Äôs still India. can‚Äôt cloud facts. need continue educate people racist assholes, change facts. mean haven‚Äôt taught kids lay sheet rock yet?

Nah, affects life, late. already chance procreate. üòú

I've complained online literally able breathe times everyone told bad suck up. Thank sweaty Italian wants run again! doubts consult doctor (but smart enough listen him!) Chances good added many years life vaccine, country population took vaccines everything fine - forget second dose 21 days! I'd love true, schedule [straight BC Government 18 year olds scheduled June.  
They indeed starting 2nd shots May that's 4 months started February shots, people getting first shots June still set receive second shot October. thing would change would drastic increase vaccine shipments. members screened upon entry, masks worn class, rooms cleaned within 30 minutes session completed attended asked contact information.‚Äù smell internet Viruses typically mutate toward lower mortality rates, particularly coronaviruses (or I‚Äôve read). There‚Äôs chance pick deadly mutation along way, likely evolve favor transmissibility away mortality. crappy-feeling host much less capable spreading disease someone sniffles wandering around public.

People (especially here) love prop stories terrible complications/outcomes covid don‚Äôt want hear common story persons course minor/felt like rough flu. 80+ year old grandparents it, one rough 10 days neither hospitalized, they‚Äôre fine. Shouldn‚Äôt equally concerned suppress idea majority people handle once-in-century pandemic fairly easily people believe warnings severe disease comes along future? Great they‚Äôve sent experts set mobile oxygen units. Praying success them, really need oxygen. many dead. guess maybe 1 5 percent people 80 alive January 2020 died covid.  basically already know long term effects vaccines. Historically, long term issues vaccines show within 3 months getting vaccine. So, would already seen long term issues any. N95's, might luck certifications like KN95, KF94 FFP2. article claiming KN95's children. COVID Classic! Huh? make sense joking? oppose safety measures

Vaccine also safety measure. They're consistent ü§ô sttain. IFR unlikely go up. evolutionary reason virus deadly. demo monolith, let put way, ""certain groups"" generally opposed safety measures vaccines, within group, exists segment wealthy educated, understand science safety behind vaccines ability get early access well able read face really throw off.

Super underrated aspect masks. Well put.  I‚Äôm gonna go details, alcohol, location, amount people last night, beyond normal. I‚Äôve waiting feel way 15 months. Feels good man vent fan something? Even without ventilation, seems incredibly small risk. 

Good luck. hard task doing. I'm Michigander life.. roommate getting 2nd shot coming Tuesday.. live street Wyandotte we're ones gotten shots younger neighbors zero shots cause think young get Covid19 We‚Äôre seeing all. We‚Äôve located B.1.617 variant India first time week. sister said yesterday. said get vaccinated let immune system strengthen like does. 

She currently sick (probably bad cold). **fifth** cold year. rejected humanity also get herd immunity people infected. That's basic stuff. get vaccinated (they obligation so), maybe catch later, therefore helping establish herd immunity. Yeah already positive tested positive week them, thought started getting classic symptoms days tested positive. Thanks reply! wear mask around them. sounds like anxiety reaction, vaccine reaction. labeling somewhat akin calling smoking deaths breathing deaths. Silver's reasoning validity, there's bad aspect what's going too.

[This article shows that, compared December peak area, *absolute number* young people (all groups 18 59) increased.

It's good proportion skewed away older people. bad that, example, 30-39 age range, 26 hospital admissions per day December time period increased 41 per day April 17-23 time period.

In words, there's surge right younger people gotten vaccinated enough protect surge. It‚Äôs horrible watch. knowing help part issue. Oh sure. surprised company‚Äôs prepared waste money. getting downvoted exactly thought would happen restrictions everyone followed. Death consequence. seeing many young people sudden onset shortness breath history asthma. Plain film shows lung fibrosis. knows widespread deadly will.be, long term studies covid.

Your odds getting mumps incredibly small, less getting accident parking lot. still vaccinate sometimes, mumps dangerous get it. I‚Äôve trouble finding news countries outside US, Europe, Brazil India.

Just yesterday article Tunisia heard nothing post.

It‚Äôs frustrating.

Maybe people post articles countries? translator bot need translate title think.  According science, masks protect person interact with, person wear them. People wearing masks higher chance catching covid - according science. find statistics vaccination age group India? Alternatively, % Indian 65's vaccinated? Kind upsetting published entire month ago, getting wider recognition. Wish would seen sooner, got first shot Pfizer almost 3 weeks ago. might affected risk-reward analysis :/ vaccine rates continued, would magic bullet. problem reluctance. We'd end months people refusing vaccine. First shot gave immense arm pain, 2nd shot gave less arm pain tiredness 2 days.

Honestly, best part following week felt like superman, slept much much energy following week. 400k seems lot, 1.3b people keep number 10 years, every day. Bro, already vaccinated. scared plain stupid. ever leave house again, care much, know risk would miniscule. Like, method transport probably would better chance killing catching covid. He's wrong though. people continued vaccinate, could end pandemic US months vaccines good. problem people fucking get vaccinated. What's point 75% ? still gonna people right next  Got covid vaccine around 2:00 P.M. yesterday I'm still nauseous. Anytime eat anything, makes feel sick. I'm hoping goes away soon :(  gives feeling eat eggs, doctor said slight egg allergy big deal. I'm tired eating food moment. outbreak appears mostly driven people vaccinated. valid reasoning vaccinated person still infected even don‚Äôt develop disease.

We know coronavirus spread asymptomatic spread. 

So thought vaccinated people could asymptomatic spreaders. Vaccination rates low latinos blacks compared whites asians.

Saw local news state. Bingo! said better! true certain antibiotics cause reaction make skin blister fall off? Yes. make well known? don‚Äôt think so. benefits general population receive using antibiotics far outweighs risk reactions occurring. 

Similarly, covid, would agree make people aware virus particularly deadly certain populations part mitigate spread (masking, vaccinations). don‚Äôt think need emphasize fact rare, severe infection occur otherwise low-risk populations. Sure, happen, don‚Äôt think people making decisions based rare occurrences. help risk otherwise act accordingly. What's old pro-life criticism? hate abortion also hate welfare public schools, want kids alive without food quality education. 

My point quality life matters too. Saving every life making lives worth living fucking inhumane. lockdowns humanitarian crisis too, realistic exactly bad pandemic going moral imperative. Human life cheap, mere life infinite value, allowed fly see grandchild's birth also value. Maybe facts? regional? Dr John Campbell YouTube segment Mumbai still mostly UK variant parts ""double"" mutation Indian variant.

I think really pay enough attention localized outbreak be. example lot US's second wave actually places really gotten hit first wave. grouped Florida New York even though really thing.  news sun hot Yeah, like 2000x lower. flu 

NOPE. deaths per day..is far disastrous. 

WRONG. less 10 times deadly flu

INCORRECT, UNFACTUAL BS. think important here? behind vaccinations preventing deaths per capita? 

The richest country world could prevented many deaths decided it. Canada enough vaccines vaccinate entire adult population fully end July (based delivery schedule). then, America still deaths per capita them.  NJ deaths per capita state. Something like quarter percent population died. means probably half state got it. Furthermore, got high vaccination rate regulations states. COVID destroyed there, destroyed anywhere America. Sounds like lot people India going die :/ [ask   üëè üëè üëè virus, ignore climate change much ferocity!  It‚Äôs matter moronic, know they‚Äôre hypocritical. don‚Äôt care think ‚Äúmoral code‚Äù comes first  Yup! I'm hoping first-dose vaccinations get back going next week two. Requiring also gives excuse.

There's point letting irrational people control choices. That's losing game. reward keeping people care safe. hospitalized 40 vaccinated. means vaccines didnt stop virus totally new virus vaccine cover vaccine created new virus put hospital. look every angle. could bad human race virus mutated way possible. Remember understand illness yet many seem drop guard jab. seen many jab diagnosed covid again.  Strawman much? Yes *obviously* critical shortage, exactly makes sense richest countries preorder hoard vaccine supply 150-500% populations. end January, 16% global population 60% vaccine supply. 

Do think it'd fair US central coordination government said ""to own""?  People don‚Äôt die Covid instantly. Deaths start dropping cases dropping. pretty awful reaction say we're handling pandemic poorly due one part. Especially one part, Canada pretty well comparison many countries. stack countries either significant domestic production and/or use vaccines approved. 

The country expects enough deliveries fully vaccinate adult population end July. Appointments absolutely moved up. saw thumbnail first. thought islands. 'I never asked handout, leaving country asked Trudeau $150 million reply'. Yeahhhhh... 


This feel like great loss.  very, ready fly without mask. fully expect mandates stay place end year mean, thousands ppl die every day causes keep mind explain step step employer this. But‚Ä¶ entire world plays video games. literally billions gamers, started playing video games 80‚Äôs. Maybe Russia invade US VR‚Ä¶

Also, logic, TV much dangerous video games. Less involving, popular, brain-numbing. think introduction TV made parents losers?  Mhm, many countless others can't choosing discount experience of?

We start deck cards, capacity circumstances beat this. illness looking people self control required fix like looking someone dying alcoholism buying another bottle; self control issue obesity issue. pretty apparent anyone brain cell, companies seeking addict kids even think harvest worth. Let's talk personal responsibility literal vampires behind shit perhaps, stop blaming people suffering it? Regardless unhesitant are, vaccination rate appear anything far ordinary. getting bump natural infections doubt. Yes, ""de facto"" ban. I've seen figure ranges 22k-60k 19-20 official CDC article releases. think 19-20 figures probably relevant conversation(as 20-21 null), picking data 4-5 years ago support point downright silly. difference drastic - 60 deaths per day vs 167. Quite frankly, bullshit..

Thanks correcting current rate. Upvoting help. Two different work first people started
 getting second shot shitshow. Went stockroom found another employee kneeling ground trying desperately process stock super sick. couple people call side effects strong got demerits so.

If call get demerit people either final warning calling shot would get fired simply can't afford miss day pay they're paycheck paycheck. Sorry that's ""country logic"" whatever.  basically 100% effective keeping hospital based trial data everything seen since. way, way, way likely injured car accident mean chose walk everywhere. 

If great workout setup need gym that's great. need honest fact take risks every day lives bunch significantly risky going gym fully vaccinated. country good great shape. states serious outbreaks recently

Covid still spreading many states tens thousands (or 100,000) people die COVID.  Yes, things better, many people US stop careful now, millions refuse get vaccine.  think 6 months things much better, next 2 months many people die COVID.  even started vaccinating children means 40% population get vaccinated next 2 months longer. Got second Pfizer shot today. ü•≥ definitely does, know hit late anything it. I'm saying fear side effects good reason miss second shot, think reason .  Objectively Canada one best countries vaccination. They're weeks behind US first doses, far ahead ~5 countries world. They're vaccinating young people alongside elderly, every model that's assumed vaccines prevent spread shows superior vaccinating elderly first. they're delaying second doses, get herd immunity much faster probably give better long-term immunity everyone. Hospitals turning away patients long time. Luckily, American health care system get point (only areas peak times happen). happening legitimate rise young people 1) go hospital first place 2) needing get admitted. 

This capacity issue all, absolutely bad news. We're one dangerous times pandemic; widespread, seemingly contagious, people tired restrictions. Yes, vaccine, younger people get, less adoption we're seeing. Covid threat young people, got it, I'm 19 can't even jog minute two without stop lungs it. sucks able run 5k get covid can't even run 100 meter. Covid sucks balls created generation losers. blowback felt 30 yrs half able bodied population United States welfare, hooked playstation 9 vr systems. bending spoons minds vr real world greatest country earth invaded russian forces gonna hit hard, bat shit insane, wall vaccinations. Soon. it‚Äôs gonna get weird. infection generate array antibodies vaccines generate antibodies spike protein.

At time CDC recommend antibody testing way measure immunity strength. PCR antigen testing remain best way identify active Got source that? Lets honest. Social Media, especially FB worst thing happen humankind recent history. Would happy able see companies get burned ground. Anxiety care rational, go right worst case scenario react worse actually living scenario. smart Misdirected antibodies attacking wrong thing. Unfortunately friends weird symptoms vaccination well could antibody related response (joint issues, vertigo), suspect covid vaccine create mis-c kids too. 

Still pro vaccine, ppl aware Tell really feel Lol it‚Äôs Alabama mandated states governors responsible Yeah, doctor advise best do, best average person achieve something scale country. alone, vaccine hugely beneficial, reason doctor strongly push without pushing idea collective action, interest in. California size many, many states combined. Los Angeles¬†County got hit hard, even two counties away, nowhere near bad. San Diego certainly ever get ""completely obliterated.""

Oregon COVID well controlled whole pandemic, effective seropositive rate actually lower almost state even high rates vaccination. 

For example, Alabama 32% first doses (all residents) 43% population infected COVID (assuming 4X undercount rate). Oregon less 18% population infected 44% first doses. 

Assuming COVID infection impact likelihood vaccinate (it probably negative correlation), means Alabama (32%)+(68%\*43%)=**61%** population antibodies. Oregon (44%)+(56%\*18%)=**54%** population antibodies. ignores likely negative correlation infection vaccination two week lag first dose effect, first dose immunity strong immunity created actual infection.

I've seen plenty pictures vaccination sites, see like that.

In addition, ever hear people severe symptoms vaccine, see non-stop coverage literally fewer one million blood clots one type vaccine (which treatable, way, automatically fatal). people ask Facebook vaccine was, people respond 104 fevers three days. ask people individually vaccine was, say big deal. there's much amplification negativity, know change that.

There people like know even one million chance something happening, able rationalize risk worth taking vs. alternative (taking chances disease contributing spread). people really best hearing one million chance again.

Twitter feed makes entire enterprise look like meritless propaganda. say nothing addressing serious concern raised manufacturing error producing viable adenovirus design.

If there's problem investigate it, publish results fix it. great don‚Äôt forget blocked exports last months needed extra. ""Giving"" polite way putting it. No, US Western countries broadly chief *culprits* causing vaccine supply disparities exist currently, hoarding doses supply scarce. Dr. Fauci criticized Western nations failing tackle *pan*demic globally coordinated manner. Sending unused non-FDA-approved AZ shots absolute bare minimum could do. still places it‚Äôs difficult find appointment. actually depends relaxed get arm. 


I've given hundreds COVID vaccines point. technique identical everyone. try really hard get people relax arms, people, tell residual muscle tone they're still going feel it. Many people, maybe plurality, tell even feel going in. feel pinch. small number, probably 1-2%, say actually hurts, they're invariably people can't get relaxed. Brazil, begging vaccines, unbelievable! 

Hope U.S start exporting donating (or selling) unused vaccines soon! major deal, per se. 

However, still find stupid throughout year society tolerated myriad impositions, compulsory masks tests forced isolation business closures, slow spread virus yet cannot impose thing would actually end good (rather slowing down), much smaller inconvenience (and orders magnitude cheaper) rest. EUA approval FDA approval. anti-vaxxers think otherwise Paywalled mobile Maybe I'm missing something, monthly production increasing 100 million, annual production currently pegged 2.5 billion? frontline workers? seems bit early general population considering age. ""additional""? article says surpassed 400k excess deaths

However, health minister said around 80% excess deaths country directly due covid, Russia would actually 320k real covid deaths instead official 110k simply present vaccine card security. time present ID. can't fly without valid ID- able fly without vaccine (or negative test result medical exemption). Prior bad medical experiences led health related anxiety. includes needles. brain logically knows fine. Yet still experience anxiety shot especially Covid vaccine asked stay 30 minutes rather standard 15 (this FEMA site felt like scene zombie movies, anyways) evaluate reactions. 

This grilled make sure ok possibly dying taking new vaccine. Meanwhile soldiers walking around everywhere one gave injection. Surreal little nerve wracking. Meanwhile anxiety levels much pandemic body primed fight flight year now. 

Therapy helpful breathing works wonders also hard breathe mask, wearing FEMA site. luckily didn‚Äôt panic attack (almost one got car mask helped) definitely understand people them. 

Mental health issues suck I‚Äôm pretty sure inherited mine mother, unfortunately ill seek therapy. People suffer anxiety don‚Äôt need grow up. need support systems, good therapist, sometimes medication.

Everyone masked mostly outside, plus CA extremely low case count. Life move sometime. time start know it. heartbreaking. know someone family people history negative reactions vaccinations. last holdout family scheduled now, held long spouse fully vaccinated. this, everyone else. number not. Like OSU Oregon State... high difference number women men infected? Deaths seem bit heavier men expected though. believe said didn‚Äôt test first dose, tested second dose found replicating virus second doses.

Other nations may issue isn‚Äôt tech thats issue rather manufacturing QA. Russia great science engineering ability scale known so-so. ones? im terrified needles one actually bad all. barely felt like anything Besides obvious leftist hating governor, Florida done anything wrong compared states? better they've generally lax things whilst still deaths / cases per capita California children way behind, suicides higher, unemployment higher, etc? approved EMA. Sputnik filing lawsuit Brazil‚Äôs regulator, harder take vaccine consideration. Look Sputnik‚Äôs Twitter feed. It‚Äôs pretty bad.  ""Fuentes says made final effort voice concern save job Houston Methodist ***before turning two-weeks notice***.""

In place would expected negative impact economic disparity, deployment sites, transportation, time work, etc, impacted rates vaccination black people, we've actually done pretty well.

The uptake rate pro-rata population level white black people Alabama moved pretty much lockstep. Definitely Mexican Argentinian vaccines, haven‚Äôt finished yet Americans keep giving eh? helped Canada last week extra doses ran short. Thank you! agree actual numbers much higher.. maybe 8-10x‚Ä¶ 30x  Shut up, please shut up. sinovac good vaccine prevents death severe covid related illness.

Weekly shipments Pfizer 1 million doses.

So increase 2 million weekly doses may headline gore (healthcare) tell legal ways get information. yet rest states opening up, lmao. Cardinals one too. Good, colleges. fact even remotely controversial schools colleges already requiring vaccination (way covid) absurd.  According media, Yankees hit 85% threshold players. Yeah 100%, India rough time say least people Boston complain 8/22 opening date? ahould frustrating know entire vaccine production subservient anglo american interests. Europe produce sputnik V vaccines en masse. Um, no. access sort medical information employees.  They‚Äôre mostly getting now. Anyone got earlier eligible state rules (the Yankees manager went March spring training, example, qualified time per FL). Glad see top comment! Good luck guy. Lockdown ""skeptic"" alert! (See person's post history.)

Government guidelines already incentivize people **many** perks fully vaccinated. anything, they're overzealous it. particularly like approach states taking now, tie reopening overall vaccination percentages. provides incentive accurately acknowledging vaccines--just like pandemics--work population level. OMFG, grow fuck up. fucking needle. NOTHING. SMfuckingHEAD. elementary, middle, high, community college, university required them. needs happen mainstream media tell people ""If vaccinate, restrictions"" people it. Negative reinforcement squat Yes, background check providers do. Bro, would hilarious  Canada?

Nobody forcing anyone get it, like flu shot problem vaccine hesitancy among hippies Portland, OR? What's going exactly? Also weird April 30 populous counties state stringent control measures ""extreme risk"" still intend fully reopening end June? still populous counties apparently control COVID needs strongest control measures now, sure 60 days it'll great need nothing all?

Just seems like weirdly run state. I'm state run bald psychopath almost directly quotes orc phrases meat back menu Lord Rings makes official announcements weed gonna kill kids, that's saying something. Critical thinking strong suit, it? J&amp;J halted? Blood clots. look percentage blood clots J&amp;J vaccine vs COVID vs Birth control pills. Also report figure many people got died J&amp;J. ask big number compared people died Covid? can't legally require person get test. fire person. 

Are actually going fire people get test? sacrifice goat Satan fly Malaysia summer. ask? Granted I'm Canadian process different. 

In elementary school high school required show proof bc think public health contacts school verify verified. sort know bc pulled class times either go get vaccine go get record. 

But college/university never requested things.  India need billion vaccines get current predicament. would like India get J&amp;J vaccine earliest ginormous population, single dose vaccine fastest way build kind herd immunity.

11/20/2020

Study results published trials long since over. think 50% partially vaccinated, hit least 50% don‚Äôt think kids worried getting vaccinated. think lives saved sending food third world countries. Probably save lives less money. One redditor you‚Äôre catching on. Show proof doesn‚Äôt exist. There‚Äôs equal amounts evidence proving disproving existence, none.

There's precedent viruses causing problems years line. Take chicken pox shingles, example. HPV cervical cancer. 


There's never vaccine side effect cropped problems months Later warning, there's plausible mechanism could happen. Yeah lot acquaintances camp. think people really underestimate emotional trauma people suffered continue suffer long over. It‚Äôs already late. variants already there. Clarity couple points here: 

Many areas Canada 18+ (some even 16+). 

The recommended timeframes still developing. original 2 weeks time frame want best many tested use cases, first one validated. recommended first doesn‚Äôt mean recommended ‚Äòbest‚Äô. still validated, body evidence (not huge amount, certainly growing) supports societal benefit extension 2-week interval. matter public health, getting 1 dose many people possible showing much effective reducing effective R value fully vaccinating half people. matter personal health, yes want quickest safe timeframe. I‚Äôll take it! partisan comment, lot rollout infrastructure place Biden, supply took get going. live, everyone know gotten vaccine local county state-organized facilities, federal sites. think Biden flipped magic switch increased supply, took time build coincidentally starting ramping period around/after election inauguration. bother, he's trolling. Pretty sure actually stupid understand though. claiming he's got better reflexes fly another thread. 

Also said never gets sick hence needs mask.  course still safer take shot. vaccines seem cause blood clots. conclusion. coincidence  know sure vaccines caused blood clots? it‚Äôs causing one million type side effects don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really worth factoring decision. Compare number activities including eating food risk negligible. Compare Covid, even you‚Äôre young healthy it‚Äôs still much better get vaccinated. I'm failing see anything politicians? knew funds collected publicly. comment mentioned taxes used. Hence shock. Ask doctor. decided skip first dose well. Demand way down. largest site Orlando, FL last ""first dose"" today, closing end month. drove 2nd shot last week even wait, pulled right one 20+ vaccine parking spots. Lots access everywhere. read county even offering come workplaces home ""vaccine"" parties. Seems like demand anymore trying find creative ways reduce barriers however minor, people's access. thing preventing people getting a.) laziness b.) choice get it. may seem like news, don‚Äôt let photo fool you. Atlanta Motor Speedway hasn‚Äôt sold race damn near decade, first time they‚Äôve July race. 

Think second, even you‚Äôre vaccinated, enjoyable go race Georgia 3:00 afternoon July. It‚Äôll probably 105 degrees lol. countries mentioned already confirmed they'll send excess supply poorer countries. least push misleading political point try use facts. Definitely food. üåÆ mean ""wear mask, stay in"" seems like easiest thing world... becomes level risk society comfortable pre-pandemic. really Depends go it. supposed go you‚Äôve recently covid, within 21 days something like work? vaccinate one group, elderly. remaining group, younger unvaccinated group, sees rise hospitalizations due severe illness? 

When lockdowns masks prevalent, every single group society exposure virus, weren‚Äôt seeing younger people ICUs? reports younger people ICUs, yes, clearly outliers. seeing increase? leads this?

Genuinely interested. rural America fewer, less staffed less equipped hospitals.

After battling stupidity year, let get sick. Die, long term health issues maybe fine. I‚Äôm familiar rural healthcare good luck them. I‚Äôm saying you, expect people forum give you? 

Here I‚Äôll give you: uhhhh we‚Äôll come super vaccine cures everything!!! would predict mid-late summer-early fall. I'm state taking really cautious approach though. Youth sports kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated. surprise. 75%+ 65+ age group MI vaccinated 30 20-25%. What's funky dots? regular decimal separators, right? We're using Pfizer basically vaccinating fast Moderna/BioNTech/Janssen supply us. could killed many AZ actually serious issues didn‚Äôt pause investigate. 

This dumb take. thought pro science? science action. None fully resistant. 

That‚Äôs point. variants starting engage vaccine-escape keep mutating. Mutations keep stacking already vaccine-escape mutations produce variants *more* those. Hmmmm don‚Äôt know, maybe it‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt vaccinate age group first. opinion though... Don‚Äôt worry, make lied got 3rd dose. sucks mostly PR issue rather science backed decision. people really assessed risk daily life fashion nobody could afford insurance Tell variant doesn‚Äôt work vaccine all. Please, that‚Äôs im asking. makes think politicians remove restrictions? would probably hurt re-election chances  It‚Äôs hypothetical it‚Äôs already happening. like Super Bowl

Just like Wrestlemania

Just like Texas Rangers operating full capacity start season

Just like Masters  /s  China totalitarian government people tolerate extreme suppression measures. early 2020, virus evolved adapted human transmission yet either. Neither true today India Yes, think you‚Äôre right. Looking vaccination rates, 1 month ago 75% seniors USA (Forbes, 3rd apr) 55% doses. 

Cases month ago 1/4 USA peak naively I‚Äôd assume deaths would fall 4000 1000 now, &lt;without vaccination. 800 seem high given many vaccinated. 

Looking U.K., almost complete vaccine cover seniors 1 dose last month. Cases fallen 96% (mostly due lockdown) deaths 98% deaths/cases halved, that‚Äôs one dose. (Plus there‚Äôs lag factor haven‚Äôt accounted cases fallen last month, it‚Äôs probably nearer third)

My guess 25% American seniors hadn‚Äôt one shot last month risk average senior. fall isn‚Äôt dramatic imo. 

Tldr; yes, agree fall greater, given 75% seniors 1 jag month ago, comparing U.K. not, persistence corrupt government introducing therapeutic drugs like Ivermectin early stages infection is. Many people stupid it, people claustrophobia anxiety really struggle despite best efforts country good great shape. states serious outbreaks recently, Michigan serious last months. outbreak started vaccination still ramping up, driven communities reluctant get vaccinated abide masking/social distancing. Vaccines seem wildly successful, beyond epidemiologists hoped for. data far suggests people vaccinated, covid becomes less dangerous flu. 4 months people getting vaccinated later like general younger population, people first got bet towards 4 month mark get second. There's way less people alive 80 40 Unsanitary facilities vaccine overall dogshit IMO complete shitshow J&amp;J applaud you, I'm vaccinated, finish line. rest world fire right now. US helps define long thing lasts. still know long immunity last. still deal CCP lying everyone it. 
 
This still years over. I'm statistician, could well 80 already died of, vaccinated COVID... Get mean? That's correct. change fact young people getting vaccinated much. Sputnik one different adenovirus vectors two doses, express spike protein. makes sense (regarding first shot protecting variants second shot somehow does) mention it, Guru Covfefe look little familiar... want get vaccine, get sea, sink bottom it. Lead Paragraphs:

 

Russia recorded 400,000 excess deaths last April March COVID-19 pandemic, according Reuters calculations based data state statistics agency published Friday.

Excess death figures, epidemiologists say best way measure true toll COVID-19 given counting methods vary countries, surpass official COVID-19 death figures many countries.

Excess deaths typically defined difference observed numbers deaths specific time periods expected numbers deaths time periods.

Rosstat, statistics agency, said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related COVID-19 last April March. There‚Äôs young people before, there‚Äôs less old people.

It means vaccine working. Good fucking point. think obvious meant long-term **deleterious** effects vaccines? Help Canada first. saving cartels. open Michigan right now? I‚Äôm Ontario we‚Äôre seeing similar wave, 30% people 1 dose 60-70% seniors 1. However case rates around 4K day despite tons restrictions.  Maybe. know colleges requiring it‚Äôs going court anyway, I‚Äôm sure anti-vaxxers sue. Imagine knowing 600,000 people US died covid still afraid vaccine. vaccine people taken gotten covid, handful deaths associated it. Yes, events turned pathological culturally.  Time divorce Thanks. article indicates data non-specific effects solid study more. Moreover, effect seems low-income, high-disease prevent countries. ""But ima take scary untested vaccine cause it'll change DNA turn zom zom."" /s Government announced free vaccination citizens.

""Some may die, that's sacrifice I'm willing make"". Assholes. EVIDENCE people reinfected. natural immunity isn‚Äôt forever case. risk think qualify statement want taken seriously. People 20-25 age group six times likely die car accident covid people 50-54 age group likely die car accident covid. dont disagree everyone vaxxed, hysterical low details articles stuff (which literally see) help. sure getting downvoted. new law, like Florida legislature passed year, shit. asking honest question. university gym requires masks times except pool we‚Äôve fine Scientists said water fact nothing wet dihydrogen monoxide.  one data point going change fact Covid big threat 20s. argument young people taking vaccine. argument societal benefit, valid. use anecdotal evidence stats misrepresentation make covid look like bigger threat young people actually is. Telling truth hard. ""gladly sharing"" Trump dumb buffoon, Modi cunning, yet incompetent, showman. Refusing vaccine don‚Äôt know side affects... refusing masks they‚Äôve told it‚Äôs bad you.. they‚Äôre willingly obstinate ignorant. Yes - masks suck 1600 people one village killed least 50. 

That's COVID looks like without hospital care. people saying vaccination shedding minute fragments spike protein may may affect non-poked people. Here's thing, majority Americans age group overweight/obese. right co morbidity Covid-19.

Underproduction - mass deaths lockdowns galore no? scared travel internationally welcome stay home. mean, I'm willing bet people 40 80 currently existence updates vaccine specific variant. Same. Disagree. According new reports, something like 1/3 Americans Covid. natural immunity, Dr. Jha believes need another 10-15% Americans get vaccinated reach sort herd immunity (he said CNN MSNBC -- can't remember which) almost there. vaccine option left. political lock half politicians don‚Äôt even want wear masks.

Can say bleach? You‚Äôll get there. lot anxiety first going restaurants like laws late 50‚Äôs. like fourth fifth time became normal again. Start small. Go stores hours. Eat outside build up. 

A good way calm estimate high end risk infection. Take number cases state. Multiply 2 unreported cases multiply 10 days infectious (this estimates people aren‚Äôt infectious long good percent probably won‚Äôt about). Divide state population multiply 100 odds person public covid. take context like say restaurant capacity multiply number people there. assume probably 20 percent attack rate 95 percent efficacy means divide risk 5 20. example NJ right now.

2000 cases daily. Multiply 2 4000 cases daily accounting unreported/untested. Multiply 10 day window infectiousness 40,000 cases daily. think it‚Äôs fair assume least half people home could probably assume even higher let‚Äôs estimate worse case scenario. That‚Äôs 20,000 people 9 million 0.2 percent. lets say midsized restaurant 100 people people actually reasonably close probably closer like 20. 0.2 percent multiplied 20 4 percent. 20 percent attack rate 4 percent drops 0.8 percent 95 percent efficacy means drops 0.04% chance contracting covid restaurant experiences. Keep mind way overestimated risk. Like average 50 percent people naturally home lot people quarantined tested positive they‚Äôre feeling good. Also, reduced capacity restaraunt it‚Äôs possible even less people around you. Lastly, NJ one highest case rates country risk still pretty low sub 0.1 % chance even catch you‚Äôre high risk you‚Äôll likely alright. good thing, except extent people 40 hospitalized covid attributable listening meatheads like Joe Rogan. strange headline. tell, &lt;40 hospitalizations exceed hospitalizations every state. 16 minutes ago said Johnson Johnson. it? smell bullshit. risk long term effects vaccine better contracting virus That's ideal situation. Unfortunately enough vigorous scientific proof say case yet. America-centric prediction: states adopt vaccine passports, require enter restaurants, bars, concerts, etc. Initially, states resist idea, states adopt residents states want go states whatever reason, states adopt them. think it‚Äôs mixed news. one hand, indicates vaccines working protecting elderly covid variant. hand, probably also indicates variant getting super hand Michigan, since that‚Äôs one affects young people.

Jk Honestly don‚Äôt see ever happening states. States focusing resources getting remaining 15-25% vaccinated achieve herd immunity. would assume means monthly average across entire pandemic March 2021. fact case counts higher April average every age group bad, indicates we‚Äôre currently spike, honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs informative outside fact. Well, maybe indicate difference mean much larger young people elderly. 

What show, although seems like think might? (I honestly can‚Äôt tell point you‚Äôre trying make here) case counts category *last* March. there‚Äôs still way use data show us make direct comparison start pandemic - notably, *the article never claims trying to*. I'm waiting. I'm never taking it. Good Yeah one wants talk fact longer interval actually preferable vaccines. reason 3-4 week manufacturer's recommendation tested. fine someone wishes personally remain ignorant make incorrect ideas nothing hurting themselves. problem comes go broadcast incorrect ideas large audience listen ""they're funny"" believe them. hurting others, that's okay. 
It's possible anti vaccine stuff spouts result someone dying died listened him. Personally believe inevitable, there's way know sure I'll stop assertion possible. happens, podcast existing killed least one person. likely happen, likely podcast kill people. means podcast allowed continue public safety reasons. akin shouting fire theatre one. Free speech unqualified, limits, one limits public safety. remaining 26% Well context, outdoor non-contact sport (which soccer is, isn't?) allowed groups 15 Ireland June, we'll 40% people vaccinated. cautious approach reopening world, safe here, well vaccination rates higher. Although cases fair bit lower US whole, maybe take prevalence community account well. How? There's many studies done link major outbreaks gyms long people wear mask. gym super anal mask thing whole year now. 

Plus mention, people gyms tend healthier people healthier tends mean stronger immune system. 

I think MANY places magnitudes worse gym COVID spread.   indian variant infecting people got vaccines far increase serious cases  Regardless reason vaccination appear individual's desire vaccinated heavily correlated individual's political views.

I'm probably pairing expect People weirdos want get sick?

Huh, that's new many fking issues hard find path preparation Wishful thinking point. much vaccination hesitancy world herd immunity. Thanks social media! like accept risk, live lives.

Unfortunately side coin ""Corona Mary"", probably one. Walking around asymptomatic still spreading disease non-vaccinated.  get point, denominator keeps growing...  also priority lot I've seen. interesting tool, people read fine print realize based case fatality rates, infection fatality rates. looking people tested positive, 1/3 cases. 

So still major overestimate likelihood hospitalization death. No, positivity rate always high pretended issue I‚Äôm simply stating facts. Something pass along anti-vaxxers life. 7 daily deaths country 65 million people one worst covid rates.

Yea, absolutely younger people getting vaccinated another factor, people seem completely disregarding fact virus changed.

Yeah honestly it‚Äôs unpopular opinion sure agree you. used get respiratory illness almost every single time travelled, matter much washed hands seat etc. picked strep traveling commission 103F fever nearly week. would happy wear mask plane hours avoid wasting week life bed. 

(probably still wear one traveling peak flu season, least would help bit even nobody else wearing one)  Well, that's hard one.. Depending bad reactions (and whether covid19 vaccine likely cause problem), might really good options here. ""Using logic calling every terrorism attack '9/11' that's called 20 years ago?""

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* One thing I'm wondering about: beginning vaccination campaign -- public health officials saying ""we know vaccines prevent transmission!"" -- likely true?

I get public health messaging hard, still see people claim (even though pretty clear prevents transmission) can't help wonder fed vaccine skepticism. 

When saying it, real possibility true? ""theoretically possible extremely unlikely"" sort thing -- case really question messaging decision? might never stop wearing it. Firstly don‚Äôt ingest people‚Äôs filth anymore, secondly upsets exact right sort people want upset. need get everyone vaccinated develops variant slams kids. way around me. Feverish side effects first, huge fatigue 2nd. got Moderna tho call Phi Gang. Creatine fine. probably took steroids. sub really weird

This sub seems value fact ""hotbed"" ""discussion"" ""both sides"". quite subs still concentrating attempting educate people get rid thing locally globally.  India donated millions vaccines Nepal avoided gym got second shot. dont know people think it‚Äôs good idea go, even massless. I‚Äôve seen dudes walk stall wash hands, go back lifting, pre-Covid. You‚Äôre idiot think you‚Äôre fine pandemic lift without mask vaccine. giant mood. I‚Äôve things one ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù pst year, always came anxiety days after. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, I‚Äôm definitely things (and realizing much money spent pre-pandemic ‚Äúdoing things‚Äù) anxiety still presents itself. It‚Äôs easier shake now, it‚Äôs still weird time. 

All that‚Äôs really left feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù concerts, live events, people back office. immediate friend group lot family well fully vaccinated Memorial Day, summer may pretty normal. Mask wearing lifted today Johnson county Kansas! covid vaccine shortage first day pandemic. can‚Äôt wave magic wand make 7 billion covid vaccine doses appear. countries developed paid vaccines get first. number young people hospitalized going down, number old people went even more. old people got vaccinated earlier. saw that. great news. Honestly don‚Äôt see ever happening states.

My guess places try individual cities counties, maybe Hawaii (which makes sense). India case already highly effective vaccine it‚Äôs mass-producing actually excellent news intentionally scary headline generate ad rev. Considering hospitalization rate already incredibly low vaccine, it‚Äôs evident hospitalization rate people 80, rate traditionally much much higher 40, seems *less* that. cant even trust medical professionals, medical malpractice kills 250k year usa Like what? examples? would likely variety factors including country epi curve, susceptibility population, socioeconomic stress etc. That's top head; I'm sure global health experts come much comprehensive system variables based vaccine supply allocated.

The research production much globally coordinated efforts people believe thread. yes, country's involvement R&amp;D one factor among large group variables determining supply.

Also, *self*\-interest high-income countries ensure equitable distribution tackle pandemic globally coordinated manner; mutant strains India, South Africa, Latin America easily spread wreak havoc high-income countries. Using logic calling every flu case Spanish flu called 100 years ago? point is, virus changed. naming convention change? Using pathetic attempt pull patriotic heart strings next time terrorist fanatic crashes plane building call 9/11 well? haven‚Äôt issues either. also fully vaccinated felt less secure going back January wasn‚Äôt. walked two different gyms like Marge Simpson tang rice crispy treats.  India also highly effective vaccine developed Indian companies. It‚Äôs around mass-production needs stepped  libertarian faction vocal even private establishments event-spaces consider it.

Not even libertarian faction. I'd argue center/center-left worries passport-for-business-entry system. Rightwing hates idea enough left reaches critical mass ""nobody wants this"". Duh. Obvious outcome 80+ population almost completely vaccinated. claiming misleading article? Yes. AÃ∂uÃ∂sÃ∂pÃ∂iÃ∂cÃ∂iÃ∂oÃ∂uÃ∂sÃ∂ like suspicious amirite Yes, US selfishly funding, researching, developing, testing, distributing, paying vaccines decided innoculate population rest world subsidizing hundreds millions vaccine doses countries ship later. fine, take vax mask. Dont complain get sick No, qualify it. pretty easy know even bare minimum vaccines, know do, makes extra pathetic playing dumb here. risk transmitting others unvaccinated much, much higher risk transmitting vaccinated. hope don‚Äôt get downvoted updates India variant effectiveness well. ""supplements"".. mean steroids. time, people STILL don‚Äôt realize lockdowns don‚Äôt work? gosh, Governor one dumbest leaders country. You‚Äôre idiot. 

Love,
A fellow idiot seem plenty people India vaccinated AZ still getting infected put hospital. case India‚Äôs Bharat Biotech vaccine There's selection pressure make virulent contagious. lead deadlier virus long long asymptomatic contagious period. Otherwise deadlier strains pandemics tend self limiting. Yeah exactly. He's like Indian version UK's Boris Johnson. earlier week coworker told Walgreens street offering tons appointments. 

I checking state run availability maps twice day since became eligible earlier month nothing within 60 miles me. soon figured sites utterly broken, made appointment first shot appointment second shot. within half mile house. What's guys best response anti vaxxers says ""we know long term effects""  definitely hit miss, everyone prepared. want full day get hit freight train    Naw, Trump busy offshoring money hydroxyqloroquine ""donation."" Ban anyone disagree with. hope grocery stores keep delivery options pandemic properly over, huge help disabled people lot people seem find convenient even necessarily need it. Researchers studying developing vaccines since SARS-1. They're random drugs FDA pushed funsies. model take account *length* lockdown? is, lockdown goes *too* long economic benefits die out? another commenter mentioned, Philippines extremely strict extremely long shutdown, yet according Worldometers saw second spike cases around beginning month. think economy well either. He's ignorant danger others. Depends live. I‚Äôd say areas US 2022. parts world that, certain individuals (by choice) NEVER we've super careful husband able get vaccinated. know rough 4 year old, feel like would harder either us, y'know, died.

Long Covid also scares hell me. Life evolves, that's fact. take yeast store, tear open package put half freezer, propogate half 20 30 generations without sort contamination outside microbes, end divergent DNA lines. would viruses bacteria fungus form life different? Moderna triple dose pfizer, part it. 100 vs 30 units.  yet it‚Äôs still up! Mods remove certain kinds misinformation here.  spoke friend Ontario way it‚Äôs run horrible. said people aren‚Äôt really getting second shot a. Timely manner many people including can‚Äôt even get first want to. Also, back mandatory can‚Äôt leave house lockdown stuff. Sometime June July, states starting reporting many daily weekly deaths people fully vaccinated got infected. Would great stat demonstrating well vaccines work. would also put fear mongering headlines like one context. 115% efficacy, there's possibility remove Covid next year say 3. took long get vaccine? Why?  That's lot surprising metric...? That‚Äôs weird part though. stakes super low. It‚Äôs free. get anywhere. doesn‚Äôt work, doesn‚Äôt work nothing changes. does, get go outside normal. zero stakes. lose?

It‚Äôs like getting free sample Costco. don‚Äôt like got, cares? It‚Äôs free know buy thing. Idk lol Yay everyone started behaving finally!!! Sad you‚Äôre downvoted asking question.  Anecdotally, spouse looking like long haul candidate, kept C19 symptoms month. finally got first vaccine (Pfizer), information seemingly more-effective long hauler symptoms. Day 4, following vaccine, heartbeat respiration returned normal, even mild moderate exertion (something *could not* manage, prior vaccine).

Sure, could psychosomatic, certain extent - think still interesting data point, IMO. skip second dose get infected getting first dose?

Seemingly not. 

[Here‚Äôs get covid-19 vaccine experts said people contract covid-19 middle vaccine series still get second dose, immune response natural infection variable. depending process individuals get sick, may need postpone CDC recommends people mild moderate infection isolate least 10 days onset symptoms recovered least 24 hours get covid-19 within first week first dose may fine get second dose time, assuming complied recommendations. second dose mRNA vaccines supposed given 21 days first dose Pfizer 28 days start experiencing symptoms less 10 days shot reschedule.


I think exception would got antibody treatment COVID-19 plasma, etc. proud say one them! got second dose Pfizer yesterday. feel terrible, body aches over, chills sore arm. change anything tho can't wait 6 11 year old get theirs. Oh b heck even news? **common sense.**  Lol

‚Äú one dial: fear versus less fear!""

Imagine simplistic view world.

Here's novel idea: went try honesty scientific accuracy. Maybe would work well people once. Pretty good still leaks risks. Bhutan seeing similar trends India Nepal? so, might time watch out, may mean vaccines fully effective. Heard too; except walked moronic statement back yesterday. job (I‚Äôm leaving soon due mistreated unrelated mask mandate) requires everyone wear masks likely won‚Äôt stop anytime soon. Oh, buddy... Well pharmacy techs trying push Johnson Johnson anyone wanted picking prescriptions appointment. waiting 16 17 minutes go back asked pharmacist pushing it. said toss  name call, rude.

The link says core argument vaccine limit transmission, that's meat even vaccinated person shed virus, do, didn't, concerns still worth thinking through. 

Secondly, bulk citations evidence different situations. Ebola outbreak 28,000 cases West Africa two years, yeah, using ring vaccination outlying villages viable, risk mutation low cases. article address situation millions cases moment. virus rolling dice viable immune escape mutations millions times examples use say significant risk. 

Sure, maybe gentleman lunch little article nothing suggest true. Calling someone idiot rude. Read comment, talking thing. even like happened Sweden, Indian culture inherently socially distant Sweden's. We're proud you.  real answer right good thing, due less older people getting sick. studies suggesting new variants dangerous younger people. saw one brazil weeks ago finding people 40 pre-existing conditions 5-7 times likely hospitalized covid infections February compared November. start seeing increased hospitalizations younger people variants making sicker would good thing. point simply giant room people ditching forcibly expelling droplets lungs requirement exercise. That's order magnitude flu. flu variant one year 7 times deadly, one MD would even notice Well, fact is, hospitals crematoriums overburdened almost entire last year countries ravaged, life went normal. year extreme spike suddenly happening. hospitals totally crashing death burned street ... something else happened explains this. saying younger people werent getting sick before? thought everyone sub went great lengths emphasize bad covid even younger people Lol, probably tho, anything they'll help infect kill others somewhat sick week. Reddit mostly U.S centered that‚Äôs expected. feel like US based news decreasing used far higher volumes  It‚Äôs anxiety overpower logic reasoning skills. Especially someone doesn‚Äôt experience anxiety. examples physical symptoms anxiety include feeling like can‚Äôt breathe, feeling like heart racing, body feeling numb like you‚Äôll pass out, ect. ect. anxiety short trip from, ‚ÄúI feel weird I‚Äôm okay‚Äù hyperventilation panic. devolves panic extreme symptoms feel. totally get unfortunately. I‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre getting many downvotes account isn‚Äôt. weird. flu kills 100 people per day, guarantee never life cared fact (unless doctor hypochondriac). yeah, 800 deaths per day excellent far disastrous. Covid less 10 times deadly flu, likely become much less deadly month now. news headline March 2020 even read article, much less spent much time arguing reddit spike protein alone this? Fucking evil virus got here. Stupid paywall  bolsonaro arrested asap UK saw slight increases transmission rates amongst young teens parents age group results, much 'incredibly safe', 'not disaster thought would be'.  correct ignorance, ""no antibodies"" indicates post infection immunity no? There's lot evidence post infection immunity. 

Or mean prior immunity infection? graph bottom shows deaths time age. No, semantics. Whether adopt policy minimises expected deaths, one minimises maximum deaths, one minimises minimum deaths, one minimises deaths due vaccination rather covid etc fundamentally scientific question. disagree, perhaps could describe experiment could decide policy correct. understanding recommendations based initial methodology used testing effectiveness vaccines. hurry, i'm sure we'd updated timelines released generally, time studies.  met Repulican last year works medical field. Talked whole COVID thing down. Ridiculed mask wearing. got second shot weeks back, age. assume he‚Äôs anti-vaxx too, recently got COVID he‚Äôs ventilator now. he‚Äôd shot he‚Äôd likely fine right now. Wife kids too, know.. freedom fair backtracked White House called out. said one take advice already scheduled get vaccine himself. Glad don‚Äôt live Oregon I'm long hauler mild covid. Vitamin essential getting back normal-pre-covid energy levels. I'm medical doctor research shows favorable results daily intake 5000uis Vitamin D. Might worth giving chance! I'd advise levels checked prior starting taking it, every 6 months.  saw one three eligible people (anyone 16+) Wisconsin fully vaccinated now. still seeing higher daily cases I'd like, deaths hospitalizations definitely come significantly.

I feel like we're getting there, slowly surely. perfect virus high population density globally connected (aging) host species? bound happen again. Nature (we included) always finds way... 

Looks like ""cure"" rapid testing discover new viruses effective isolation. possible select countries... even new surprises eventually come. decades research told us that, outside isolated island nations, closing borders useless best, counterproductive worst.

Any pandemic preparedness plan public health agency good explanation don‚Äôt work. fatal risk warning point far likely fatal risk death covid across age groups vs many develop clotting issues vaccine.  Hell, I'd even wear motorcycle helmet go Alaska. I'm cyclist! Is/was limit many people could over? I‚Äôve read political ideology considerably stronger predictor whether person likely get vaccine identity marker. I‚Äôd interested seeing data support meant household visits. saying hoax? understanding believed hoax?  I'll never know? What's statistical likelihood asymptomatically transmitted COVID others regularly testing negative via PCR tests? None? Next none?


""That's I'm part protect myself""

Which would recommend everyone does. People want protect covid means go ahead get vaccinated. rest us decline bear full risks so. old people vaccinated. Vaccines work. Many states gyms fully open masks require people go exercise masks on. Things like space size ventilation significant factors. 

I‚Äôve going gym since last July, mask, zero issues. I‚Äôm sure lot GOP members browse echo chamber anyway

This claim. I'm talking response claim made own. claiming sub echo chamber I'm asking sub dedicated news covid echo chamber GOP members would avoid.  NYC, indoor dining trust vaccine advice backed medical community. garbage trust it. point say imply verify. make Oxygen passing electricity water, cathode(-) creates hydrogen, anode(+) creates oxygen. contain hydrogen oxygen other, fine. However, mix, could create highly combustible solution called Oxyhydrogen gas.

That's cheapest way make oxygen. also dangerous, requires electrical source, water, conductors. never seen single person 3 gyms I've Boston past year wear mask.  Silver 

Why, say vaccine would win landslide?

/s Yes. still leaves ""he could've gotten literally anywhere else"", still went gym, perfect breeding ground Covid, every single day. anything else claim stay safe probably bullshit.

Hell, father, physician, thinks 18 year old taking ""supplements"" smart move. fair basically shot foot, kidneys case may be. would likely healthy apparently taken toxic levels whatever taking. 

For general health good remember always better healthy shortcuts. give idea: Electrolysis water creates hydrogen, fuel; oxygen, oxidizer; involves electricity, ignition source.

There chemical reactions also generate oxygen, generally also produce hydrogen extremely exothermic nature done controlled manner. Read exothermic 'ignition source.' get damn shot. choose buy that. know.. ‚Äúpersonal responsibility‚Äù stuff level expectation aggression really unprecedented. It‚Äôs overwhelming. Everyone feels get vaccine. can‚Äôt understand anyone else get them,‚Äù said.

The gist it.  live NY, generally considered one restrictive states, could go house party tonight would 100% legal.

I can't speak every single state country, would imagine they're allowed NY, they're allowed anywhere. question this, enough people dont get vaccinated point govt step in? Sort off-topic even scenario think COVID could hold candle smallpox, malaria, AIDS. destruction pathogens caused throughout history level almost inconceivable modern first worlder. He‚Äôs Gwyneth Paltrow bros. good, worth earing mind one day's worth jabs Brazil's current vaccination rate.

I certainly hope ramp exports quickly. Hey man time pull boot straps someone's PhD thesis - check - nice cheap, well-tolerated way inoculating animals, since designing individual vaccines individual species (like mink) would enormous headache. Nevermind expensive. Hey man stop fear mongering. vaccine I'm never going wear mask ever again!  (Assuming area heavy outbreak) outside time distanced others, good shape. really worried, wear mask play.  ""including unvaccinated choice (for health reasons)"" 

Can said individuals wear mask? said individuals wearing mask even eligible receive vaccination?



""Don't lie saying affecting anyone else. are.""

How many people personally spread COVID past year, continuously testing negative COVID points bi-weekly? situation cases rising, falling. headline makes sound like situation getting worse, reality getting better. Cases dropping. Lol always valid possibility -- vaccine served tamp inflammation rather clear virus, could end situation virus cause issues (no symptoms, etc), could still spread it.

Fortunately, appears turned case!  It‚Äôs pattern Israel vaccine rollout. overall numbers decreased Israeli government expanded vaccine among eligible age groups, younger ones numbers increased got vaccinated. GUESS it‚Äôs behavior-related mixing vaccinated vs unvaccinated. Sounds like breakthroughs asymptotic low symptomatic. people letting guard around unknowingly asymptomatic vaccinated parent grand parent (for example), bump infection rate younger population makes sense.

Edited typos 'Man donates .01% wealth towards political candidate.' It‚Äôs stupid question. already positive, can‚Äôt infect again. would wear masks around though. found this:

 

[Israel registered eight cases coronavirus variant first identified India believes Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine least partially effective it, Israeli health official said Tuesday. - initial seven cases Indian variant detected Israel last week among people arriving abroad since undergone preliminary testing, Health Ministry said. - ""The impression Pfizer vaccine efficacy it, albeit reduced efficacy,"" ministry's director-general, Hezi Levy, told Kan public radio, saying number cases variant Israel stood percent pop that? significant amount too. looking rough numbers, 6% population Michigan 75, 70% population 45 younger. 

Not exact age groups, still shows magnitude difference. False information : planning open additional plant foreign countries demanding supply Indian government stopped export. 9.2% 1 vaccine dose. 1.9% fully vaccinated. check googles graph Covid vaccine see distribution improving last 2 months. 

I think previously lot criticism exporting many doses. added export ban keep doses India help supply. comment linking blogspot.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

There‚Äôs way he‚Äôs getting enough sleep he‚Äôs super active waking early every day work out. today too.. got J&amp;J 1 shot vaccine yesterday feel almost exactly like January actually covid. There's coughing though aches much bearable yeah tiredness light fever sucks. Don‚Äôt worry bruh, never get older do, COVID magically go away get old unhealthy.  It‚Äôs fair point hospitalizations deaths less reliable indicator current transmission highest risk population vaccinated. course, arguments makes spread less significant studies finding substantial number initially asymptomatic cases becoming long Covid. . . Good see proactive governor. pay pay 10 times much later. I'm huge Rogan supporter still scientists like fairly frequently. recently he's Jonathan Zimmerman, Shanna Swan, Brian Greene, etc. Got J&amp;J vaccine morning. Don‚Äôt really feel side effects anything nasty yet Or, put actual doctors degrees public health charge, making policies based scientific reasoning, rather political concerns. meantime, figurehead politicians completely steps away decision making process, serving repeat, enforce reinforce policies set doctors.

It's rather mind boggling exception, rather norm. "" new study, researchers created 'pseudovirus' surrounded SARS-CoV-2 classic crown spike proteins, contain actual virus.

You‚Äôre wrong. can‚Äôt read article, others I‚Äôve read higher hospitalization rates may partly due greater access hospital. someone 20s 30s presented ER breathing difficulty pneumonia like symptoms may sent home recover, room inn, didn‚Äôt want increase viral load hospital unknown virus. hospitals space things do, admit patient. said, I‚Äôve also read new variant catchy deadly (unclear much deadly). Brazil variant killing kids Brazil, think MMR vaccine US offers kids protection variant? understanding, US seeing death rate. kids died covid US also lack MMR vaccine, might tell us something... bad preference certain vaccines another? bad vaccine shopping?

I'm Toronto, Ontario. I'm frantically booking appointments snag vaccine want, I'm wasting slots. wear mask, work home, see friends/family, wash hands, mindful cross contamination.

I'm anti-vax. get flu-shot every year.

In weeks, most, all, people Ontario ages 18 get vaccinated Pifzer/Moderna government booking system.

I got comment downvoted badly removed local subreddit asking vaccine offered mobile hotspot. I'm 20s would prefer get AstraZeneca.

People said could slowing vaccine rollout. Ontario, plan already determined start rollout slowed -- actually sped due demand, also due increase supply Pfizer.

I want downplay seriousness COVID-19, pandemic urgent, safe stay home, would certainly inclined take whatever vaccine available.

The option wait weeks widely used vaccine seem bad me.

I can't find much discussion vaccine shopping online, especially outside Canada.

So, really bad 'vaccine shop'? doctor's sexual preference ? article says 40% adults received least one shot. thought national average closer 50. Golden State looking Golden Winter Surge. LA positivity rate 20%! whole neighborhoods every household member catching covid. midst sickeness &amp; death shopping malls retailers fully open easier scapegoat restaurants &amp; gyms. could've done much better, especially terms protecting black &amp; brown communities can't work home. Wait, I'm confused. got sick got better problem? None variants resistant vaccine. Stop fear mongering.  weren‚Äôt 30k influenza deaths **last year**. Why? social distancing measures barely held COVID-19 600k deaths year virtually eliminated flu deaths. asinine compare two diseases point. literally Biontech's Phase 3 study. abstract includes relevant information, case (Phase 3 study) fact Biontech efficient preventing Covid without many observed side effects. vaccines rolled accordance study parameters defined reported Biontech - including spacing two shots. suggesting governments completely disregard manufacturers vaccine invent parameters vaccines administered? x100. reason surge Oregon cases dropping NYC probably 4x amount prior infection per capita here. hmm none people hospitalized county (Oregon) 30 make 54% cases cdc bad messaging vaccines reason see 2nd quote much I'm talking entire pandemic. Compare CA FL TX consider difference restrictions masks closing businesses. know ebbs flows virus rates go low large wave. Remember NY may 2020? I‚Äôd willing bet most, all, establishments DC still require masks, even vaccinated. hopefully there‚Äôs clarity coming mayor‚Äôs office soon, since kinda dropped nowhere. side might deaths would normally prevented, like scheduled operation etc (which happen since health care limited covid-19 almost exclusively) Ok thank god you‚Äôre joking, second lol Anybody know there‚Äôs like... anything someone tested positive covid, actively infected, still wandering around public, going partying, ignoring mask mandates? It‚Äôs nature narc spend lot time around elderly people someone could easily die worries me. One thing pandemic made clear ridiculously ignorant people statistics Russia can't afford vr sooo... they're greatest country earth. invade real world live phony world, let sink in... Ronald reagan watched tv tv loser tv dangerous. Plus seen tv viewers shout n bomb tv screens beat wives often gamers do. Corona populism marriage made hell. Good news Brazil! got covid last week work. Masked sitting 5 feet person it. Didn‚Äôt make physical contact him. one coughing breathing hard. get that, better sure hell people spreading gym huffing sharing equipment. Thankfully mine asymptomatic. yea know fact got since isolated besides that.   we're talking wearing masks walking restaurant. think makes sense? Honestly sucks it‚Äôs nothing. two days still able go classes sports practice. Felt like crap still able manage. believe psychologists must looking studying real time.

Indeed: He's borderline, missed boomer cut years. think it‚Äôs ridiculous travel restrictions India US aren‚Äôt starting immediately. good going come people India coming US today, tomorrow flight restrictions start?

The people India willing ignore guidelines thousands thousands people crowded together religious ceremony. That‚Äôs disgusting.

Also I‚Äôm tired seeing people say Biden ‚Äòxenophobic‚Äô choosing put restrictions place. serious? live NY, one hardest hit states. *are* recovering progress stop let people India keep coming. already feel hopeless rest world knowing what‚Äôs going India.

I hope recover stay safe. tired also seeing people turn debate left/right. dumb. Get please, people dying &lt;3 Michigan residents returning time second dose COVID-19 vaccine better rate national two widely used vaccines U.S. -- developed Pfizer Moderna -- require second dose spaced 21 28 days apart, respectively. second shot necessary maximum effectiveness severe cases April 17, 95% Michigan residents received first dose Pfizer vaccine eligible second dose shown follow-up appointment gotten one, according vaccine data state health department. second dose joke

It **REALLY* varies person person. Many side effects whatsoever. slight effects. severe...

Would great see statistics age group Vancouver big Brazilian strain outbreak. far hospitalization rate (per 100 confirmed cases) higher among young people original Wuhan strain. Hospitalization rate bit higher older cases. Young people higher % admissions previously due combo cases (more infectious) young people fewer vaccinated older people. evidence far it‚Äôs severe young people original strain. brother 25. sore throat 4 days back normal less week. talked 4 died? might gotten better since last saw them. lethality influenza varies greatly year year. point one use 1 year data representative. Turkmenistan strongman autocrat charge results ... poor governance. run mill almost everyone age, huge problem few. 40s dad conditions obese died know. sad, bc probably days getting vaccine caught it. 

I still think need open people fearing vaccine covid 25 baffling live Oregon appreciate stance governor taken reduce transmission. high cases due younger crowd finally giving large social gatherings. It‚Äôs long year people fairly dedicated spread reduction. I‚Äôd die lived state one cares others well-being! mean charts likelyhood different symptoms vaccination Moderna Pfizer. Moderna around 40% chance fever and/or body aches. Pfizer around 25% symptoms. millions pretty shitty time getting vaccinated especially second dose. Weird, whole bunch covidiots last month shouting ""look good Michigan doing!"" can't seem find now.

It's almost like cherry pick data move soon inconvenient dumb stupid opinions. nut jobs getting desperate. sad. Italian, feel use text speech mostly, like cut bullshit truth, thanks. knee-jerk response distrust advice official source. Nationally Children (who vaccinated) Adults refusing get vaccinated total 40% US population. COVID keep spreading many people die next 5 months. kickboxing gym said fuck never masks ever.  Fauci believes India learn China, US learn China?

Anyways, Modi seems inclined learn former US president. right, theres least 0.03% chance death noticed try lived QC entire time ya‚Äôll Today amazing. got visit grandparents without masks distancing since fully vaccinated pfizer!  appears both. Microchip?

*rolls eyes*"
