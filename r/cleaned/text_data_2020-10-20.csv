0,2020-10-20," Oddly find time passes, scared feel, although think could mental health declining gradually pandemic gone world general seems getting worse worse (in ways, covid-related) time passes. Pure fucking cringe Republicans though, free money siphon suckers losers. Yes outsourcing it. Fine? go get educated skill better instacart employee. come reflect sad life here. won't. wear mask flu season. countries do. sure future full understanding it. bothered 30k deaths. But, America 200,000 deaths months. Flu pales comparison that. yes hugely important take COVID seriously dangerous flu also appears longer lasting effects flu, even milder cases.

I agree you, do, think using comparison gets people's backs realising different diseases one vaccination whereas (yet). Right need focus getting pandemic control immediate threat. includes getting flu shot wearing masks. Covid winter coming, give time! Challenge accepted. grew Janesville. least shocking thing I‚Äôve heard day. It‚Äôs shit town doesn‚Äôt care anyone. I‚Äôm glad moved away. Good luck fellow Janesvillian. Tuberculosis killed 1.4 million people 2019. Where's preventive measures? think it‚Äôs false dilemma. It‚Äôs false something, whatever is. really reference sheet logical fallacies hand browse sub. people arguing 'Pro Herd Immunity' clever disease-coping method believe Evolution anyway.  long within year live 99% restrictions removed. perennial lockdowns forever, would seriously think whether wanted life. Large scale vaccination distribution slow keep infection rate things now.

We way behind curve. MUCH smaller number talking about. Thousands? Hundreds thousands? Single digit millions? 

My point reinfections, confirmed, extremely rare point time compared actual amount confirmed, even non confirmed cases. False. vaccine trigger immune system manner virus itself. Depending various factors including vaccine vector adjuvants, could far effective longer lasting immunity acquiring Covid.

Also, flu high mutation rate, predict target specific strains vaccine year. Covid relatively stable without significant mutations, currently think minimal chance develop resistance vaccine. medication exists suppresses viral load HIV much can't even detected testing. Sheesh look logical fallacy committing. Appear [the False I‚Äôve read hundreds anecdotAl reinfections. Denying point ludicrous. üòÇ makes feel better imagine I‚Äôm fake lying, it, Safe Space. you‚Äôre going post ridiculous, condescending nonsense, can‚Äôt get upset people respond. enjoy blocking me, side definitely loves silencing dissenting opinions! Economy grows 4.9% rest world struggles coronavirus. 

Do hold eyes open show evidence getting virus control GOOD economies going plug ears say ""I can't hear you?"" 

It's almost like people behave differently there's virus spreading unchecked want catch. flatten curve 2 weeks! thing worry worry? said worry? drastically alter lives social distancing, lockdowns, curfews mask wearing requirements like it. Meanwhile state Florida reports several thousand new cases every single day last 6months least vaccinate it.

a lot people lmao That's bad. care others. making world worse place, spite. part problem. looks like actual confirmed case HIV anywhere testing precaution. They're also testing Hepatitis B C. basically like waking finding 243 person orgy. Dallas serious increase past couple weeks. Hospitalizations Houston area increasing much areas. r(t) rose 1 first time weeks last week. Positivity rate also going slowly. Oh, don‚Äôt really lose appetite. definitely drink much depressed well. problem comes energy takes prepare food. Basically I‚Äôm super depressed, forget meal can‚Äôt popped microwave. run convenience food go hungry, order overpriced takeaway. think one aspect peoples' complaint CEO pay left (not sure purpose) paid huge sums regardless performance. horrible job something really bad watch happens loses company lot money still get paid golden parachute worth millions. suppose high risk high reward job turns actually low risk high reward job get paid either way. mention unknown long term effects. Life death possible outcomes It‚Äôs really though. much better understand virus now, isn‚Äôt New York isn‚Äôt April. fine That‚Äôs still legit though. virus becomes widespread enough break local area‚Äôs healthcare system, it‚Äôs part pandemic dynamics. R naught stay constant human behavior affect spread. bounded potential gnarly infectious disease be, human environmental factors always play role. one factors much stress healthcare system handle overrun. think maybe expecting much ""pretty great"" disregards effective mitigation practices lieu vaccination. yeah, think many people depending springtime vaccines little much. news dec 13 - new babies born. world ended one noticed course country big China, they're going catch 100% cases. think country 100% accurate numbers simply there's lot cases never get tested

But there's denying China handling pandemic much better countries HIV easier contain it‚Äôs airborne also widely ignored dismissed ‚Äúgay cancer.‚Äù bigotry cost us lot time innocent lives.

Relative COVID efforts head start every developed nation earth researching simultaneously. They‚Äôre years worth work mere months using methodology technology never applied. HIV virus fucks immune system mutates rapidly. coronavirus slowly mutates comparison.

All viruses treated prepped us fight. It‚Äôs disruptive civilization large can‚Äôt afford let continue going. time I‚Äôm confident something come along kick it‚Äôs ass. virus already infectious low enough mortality rate wonder there's much selective pressure become less deadly infectious. Inkl website seem accessible without signing up. accessible version YIKES reusing single-use blood devices multiple people. family get togethers 10-15 people max? Especially west. Let people enjoy family everyone consents. chances catching covid single meetup small low. I‚Äôve always kinda envied people lose appetite they‚Äôre depressed. me, depressed means can‚Äôt stop eating drinking beer disgusting pig body hate top everything else... We've got example developing world right now, deaths happening droves due lack elderly/obese/people multiple comorbidities kept alive magic modern medicine. Rapid tests way high false negative rate testing 25% population month get there. It‚Äôs feasible. UIUC barely keep handle they‚Äôre testing 100% student population least twice week. Test trace get lower, asymptomatic spread serial interval 4 days means ‚Äútesting people every 28 days‚Äù essentially nothing that‚Äôs 100% compliance *and* that‚Äôs totally ignoring COVID spreads, super spreading events: month testing nearly useless measure much Covid spread community.

It‚Äôs method destined fail. see people say this, there's truth it. smallpox size 0 Ad smallpox 1910 kill dead, we've gotten better prevention basically we've lost 7+ months life (and counting) nothing. Actually, we've lost least decade lives, since we're going work 10+ extra years recover economically. least.

If reading this, understand now: thanks destruction, going retire time 80, all.

And Fauci says wants lockdowns till ""Late 2021"" experts saying brace lockdowns till ""at least 2023""

Foolishness, dear friendos... foolishness guess repeat sequence strain vast majority people. 40 million cases, MUCH smaller number.

What part trouble understanding?  Hopefully WI first decrease rate increase hospitalizations, current rate quite rapid concerning. Big claim. Juice? I'm definitely arguing point! genuinely confused small sample size rife problems regarding gets tested second time, etc. 

11 vs. 8 9 people 50-50. can't draw meaningful conclusions that. mean eventually, even great vaccine never found, go back normal. Imagine pandemic's never happened? earth would extremely overpopulated probably close death now! mean, literally said wore blackface many times can't even remember many times he's done it, guess he's bored now. fully reopen downward trend cases stopped week later. weeks since, arent really conclusions draw hospitalizations yet. Avatar taught anything, it‚Äôs onion banana juice great chakras. You‚Äôre right, point still stands ""BuT iM sIx FeEt AwAy, DoNt NeEd mAsK"" Omg. long there‚Äôs something defined pandamic, care. seasonal flu threshold, despite causes killing millions every year. Where‚Äôs concern homeless living city? expect see paychecks come them, else don‚Äôt care No, I'm specifically saying people selling legitimate hemp derived product legal implicitly. Also, delta-9 expressly illegal. I'm saying that's hard look something up. Also, that's even good comparison something that's hard narcotic. I'm talking something natural byproduct. artificial one man made materials. still fail see coming from. Right, shouldn‚Äôt worrying another potential vector old people die.

Yep, stuff takes while. Regardless outcome, take court. Absolutely excuse ever happen. USA highest number daily new cases past days. couple weeks ago talking India would soon surpass US confirmed cases (the country likely already exceeded USA actual cases back simply due population size), might happen months given trends recent days hate got downvoted oblivion saying people recovered forced stay isolated months fact antibodies disappear mean immunity real since B cells, guy said antibodies disappear therefore get reinfected immunity real got upvotes (he saying people idiots going recovering).

It seriously sucks people still expect survivors stay home months, what's point recovering then?

Hey, I'm Florida, know react anymore... Help, like Buzz Light-year said, ""No sign intelligent life anywhere"" Title read ""Head state common sense"" proof lockdowns worked

Yes thanks bringing up! 

This purpose fully pointed time experts, ignored far many folks frustratingly, still ignored many now


The lockdown served multiple goals. Arguably major purpose lockdown lower baseline flatten curve, also give healthcare specialists extra months learn best practices novel coronavirus. whoever wondering, ""crore"" unit measurement South Asia equal 10,000,000. ""lakh"" equal 100,000 Would nice treated cattle better too. whole ‚Äútreating humans like animals‚Äù problematic sent 1 lol. flu estimate Rt silly goose. vaccine. can't compare 1 R0 one Rt. also throws sort plausible vaccine strategy well. covid good spreading indirect contact every nurse world would now. ‚ÄúBut many preexisting conditions?‚Äù though least hundred people know don‚Äôt preexisting conditions. live crazy backwards times that's sure true US presidential election process. hold true state governors. know 50 happen year, know state Gavin Newsom stayed term 2019.

Plus saying implies political issue. isn't, public health issue. COVID care year is, who's current president Halloween/Thanksgiving. another outbreak happens whoever charge deal it. numbers surge like scientists think will, whoever charge still deal it, lock whatever want call it. numbers raise we're seeing right outlier burst, there's nothing dealt with.

Plus regardless win/loss, Trump president January next year, approximately 3 half months. he's POTUS regardless political spectrum fall on. governors deal confirmed cases numbers death goes even loses election. Prez fuckhead gets COVID 3 weeks ago, acts like it‚Äôs big deal, surprise fucking surprise half country hospital. can‚Äôt that? Actually saw someone today mask made beads mesh (resembling one Lana Del Ray criticized for) absolutely floored. crazy things people get around mask requirements biggest fear people get over, maybe first couple times get you‚Äôre ok. happens body fighting 7 8 times 9 year span? may take lot people miserably slowly time, chances vaccine developed slim.

That would nice. Anyway, stay safe there, friend. government judge say open fought open closed health masks? literally place business... Yes. even say virtually impossible produce billions vaccine timely manner. there's one skinny kid, call skinny Tom read dab coat. ‚ÄúUnfortunately us make sacrifices different types, particularly kids.‚Äù

Others get reasonably believe safe so, probably happen seems like vaccine something political, higher priority people getting months issue.

Honestly, I'd surprised 60% Americans get vaccine unless serious personal incentives (positive negative) aside health-related ones since (they believe anyway.) epidemiological perspective feel greatest challenge w virus... penetrates deep population infecting notice it, eventually reach people critically injured/ die.

When Stephen Harper PM, would give candy trick treaters came official residence. made Halloween day year members public able show door PM's residence.

Trudeau young kids usually takes trick treating instead handing candy  reap sow.

Get responsible government voting people believe following health guidance article implying new cases exceed past month half dramatic way. That's average I'm comparing to, ""if virus never existed."" Minnesota resident here! think they're talking St. Cloud. could hospital twin cities area. $69,999,000 probably going Ceo. I‚Äôm sure be, however reality vaccine released done time being. time hopefully effective vaccines therapeutics become available knows long take? 

The vaccine data going rigorously studied brightest minds fields. doubt, heard experts like Osterholm, state cry wolf vaccine release isn‚Äôt safe. whole thing politicized can‚Äôt blame people wary. look deeper superficial level. long vaccine universally approved among leading minds I‚Äôm good. wish good luck won‚Äôt get it. Nothing convince people get injected vaccine can't even convince wear piece paper cloth face 20 minutes takes grocery shopping. data pointing what's driving current surge? Loosened state restrictions? Kids going back school? colder weather causing people try indoor gatherings? state's also spike afaik nothing really changed policy-wise. Haha, blizzarding day here. think made leap cat cat yet might okay. fair though, many people would died winter flu etc. anyway?

It's hard know incremental impact control planet coronavirus happen, estimate excess deaths.

That said, understand people staying inside except essential stuff wearing masks public. mean damn mask idea populace infantile. going another 48. 8-D Yes, yes, highly respected infectious diseases expert, radiologist Scott Atlas...  course they‚Äôre higher August. Duh. numbers go higher that‚Äôs counting works. ? Rumour says acceptance phase 3 trial result full scale deployment happen soon end month. Yearly production figure 100 million doses per year, China taking 20 million 80 million distributed BRI countries.

It certainly matches increasingly wide spread use vaccines. rumour turns true see vaccine war shortly. good news 18% increase survival rate aged group mean taking seriously. 70+ year old: 10% death rate back april 8% death rate Oct. Still deadly disease. majority died early on

biggest lie day know you, handful people willing tell got covid diarrhea. 4 months. Straight. thank thoughhhhhhh now? 7 months in, lucky acted quickly. context measures, going happen. nothing still-shrinking doubling time many infected stop spreading far beyond reached April. Europe took measures March April take again. Even measures taken, inconceivable April numbers could matched overall. 3 reasons

1) reason private labs required law report positives.

2) sisa system (the one countrywide data gets logged) designed accessed many people tendency crash, data loggers encouraged priorize positive tests negative assure accuracy first ones. theory end data base eventually, backlog negatives. 

3) subcategory understand correctly ""negative, needs retested ""X"" reason"" (living positive example) end negative second test (that one week later) negative well. does, goes database single negative despite geting two negative test results.

in end end artificially high positivity artifically low testing rate.
now, issue aknowledged least month ago, media (both national international) keeps using two numbers headlines, governament announced friday taking steps fix it.

the first steps adding private lab data, something apparently interational trackers aware causing knejerk reaction removing db gets validated somehow. Increased hospitalizations leads overloaded hospitals/ICUs capacity staff burnout, eventually collapse health care system. That's people start drop dead home streets. Within days needed intubate. fought sedate him.

Just quick note: *cannot* intubated without put chemical coma. awake conscious intubated. Sedating client, protocol. 

Your body fights tube trachea artificially forcing lungs stay inflated like balloon, exhale stick together like jelly. 

In many cases, also pronated well, prevent fluid building lungs, gathering back bottom lungs. 

You also can't stay intubated 16 days, tube erodes inside trachea. replaceable parts throat, improving time clock rolls around, extubated little chance survivability. people intubated due SARS-CoV-2, make (high 90+% mortality rate). 

Those survive ""recover"", significantly less lung function, lifelong breathing difficulties high risk fibroids throwing clots stroke risks result. point, can't even tell flaunt guidelines they're actually stupid. Either way we're fucked. Thanks lot Nancy... Sorry, feel like got meant message before. :/ hasnt practiced medicine 40 years. Shes documentary filmmaker ""door knocking"" thing really weird. Yep. in-laws. didn‚Äôt go church let sales guy (who contacted online) without mask. home weren‚Äôt wearing masks arrived. sat together 40 minutes. Meanwhile, we‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go visit mom dad. They‚Äôre 100% safe. don‚Äôt go anywhere!‚Äù that‚Äôs happens, it‚Äôs fate. 

If vaccine 99% effective 99% people get vaccine socially distance wear masks protect 2% still vulnerable?

At point, accept loss. vid shows covid right actually ranked 17th according records shown Wikipedia said think end pandemic covid might possibly kill 3 mil probably going top 10 recorded ones done. Obviously there's way pandemics that's probably killed tons humans BC era's went undected unrealistic think historians capture pandemic thats happened thousands years ago. Like said, people live like that. people producing distributing groceries, beer, electricity, etc cannot. Czechia 905

Belgium 783

In Belgium one party asking lockdown andit's one least influential parties governement. 
I'm happy Czechia take serious, Belgium really tries become nr 1 infected / population rate. 


We probably go lockdown early monday 26 oktober politicans first want see effect current measurements closure pubs restaurants meeting 4 people month (with social distance one cuddling person). I'm literally armchair. feels personal. fever, right oxygen hospital.

He also president though. Easiest way stop bullies. Ignore them. fully expected. hope ideal outcome, simple reading coronavirus family tell short lived immunity common not.

Probability wise expect periodic re-infection problem like coronavirus. Maybe still get lucky wrong, smarter assumption must make one.

I suggest good guess average immunity 6-12 months currently wishful thinking. average consequences reinfection, that's still air. suspect second reinfection similar seriousness people whether serious serious. good news people mild infection reinfection might huge multiplier effect staggered varying degrees average immunity. Maybe pack little piece Minnesota go Canada get to. Lol. pretend. Northern Angle? never remember called. flown recently find encouraging- fool proof encouraging Also, ""essential"" bullshit term. vague, probably intentionally so. nonsense. I'm literally quoting study provided, says direct evidence wearing mask protects wearer others around them. also states evidence wearing mask reduces transmission covid. So, got another one? could really use Google skills. I'm aware happened southern hemisphere's winter, different? Peoples ignorance vaccination works going mean get vaccinated probably going feel invincible whatever want.

I hope government puts breadcrumbs real close together makes videos explain vaccination going perfect right away. least would affect peoples behavior.

If vaccine 75% effective 75% people get vaccinated means 0.75x0.75 = 0.56 56% population protected.


We need hammer message people use excuse pretend fine put rest us risk.

I feel like there's gonna bad time vaccination happens everyone takes masks neglects get booster shot outbreaks. could get shit together believe science.... know I'm living fantasy world. stupid fucking politicians holding campaigns elections middle pandemic. Lmao know nothing countries huh? normal variety cultures already true, degree. 

But I‚Äôm guessing uncle didn‚Äôt significant fever, required oxygen hospitalization. Would medical doctors China, logical choice? rare think. Antibodies covid last months. easily get wearing mask. 

And time discover someone reinfected huge news story?

If ""not rare"" would tons re-infections 30 million people Covid, would news story time discovered somebody Bangladesh Estonia got re-infection. shared links facts stuff can‚Äôt disprove simply ignore. 

You've shared one link responded it. Nothing else stated becomes fact say is. called arguing bad faith. 

Yes, seems you‚Äôve shared polls feeling aren‚Äôt facts kid.

Christ, I've wasting time talking child. Quick tip: grown ass adults feel need insist they're older people proves anything. really. Serfdom labor tied land compelled work whoever owns land. case government trying job protect people. whether good job, can't really say. mention population density across entire United States twice New Zealand. mean, live PA, know lot businesses dont require masks, people stop wearing soon vaccine widely available. Fucking nerve dying time Maybe you‚Äôve missed pandemic reason lockdown try break exponential spread. Maybe care neighbors, community country. Racist? How? I've working home past 10 years. know really working now! Thanks! Trump getting covid hurts chances winning Presidential poles. stocks help make ~415million agree saying. Nobody live unlivable wages. Mike Pence made point VP debate Trump tax cut saved families 2 grand year. want live country nobody working job considers 2000 dollars lot money, much less anything sway opinion politician.

For hand wringing wages however, lot businesses value people pay good wages. actual quote original article:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going profound degree herd immunity considerable period time, maybe toward end 2021, 2022,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI feel strongly we‚Äôre going need degree public-health measures continue. Maybe stringent right now.‚Äù

That mean right stay 2022. Tuesday/Thursday though, start adding briefings? Nebraska outside events 1k people bigger groups 8 table. 

Some people wondering going 5th place cases higher people.push get students back class room.

Pathetic. aren‚Äôt. stupid people selfish, way blame trump, perhaps virus spreading unless literally allowed leave house all. yep. don‚Äôt understand it. literally don‚Äôt care enough waste thought it. store here. yelled ladies behind fresh meat counter, ignored me. 

people need start calling police people wearing masks... otherwise never end, people get fed reports new cases stop watching news. Well know like Nazis, referring non-Nazi supporting people. 

We hate Nazis therefore ... :) thought source assertion. guess least kids better learning remotely school. haven‚Äôt seen studies though. suspect become much like annual flu: kill lot people winter nothing like would killed year widespread partial immunity due past infections annual vaccines. Denmark? It‚Äôs different before. Maybe bit less people public transportation. Mandating masks bars seems effect much people them(masks work?). regular person trouble buying n95s use commercial market. Hospitals excuse. Exactly this! hate seeing parents blaming teachers best horrible situation kids shitty behavior. kids problem, extension parents, teachers. affect white rich people, nobody cares TB malaria. understand mean 2.5 million years? 

America barely centuries old! rare think. Antibodies covid last months. easily get wearing mask. America, country wide mask mandate virus still here. Covid around long 2021, Trump wins, man listen scientist. Well, 2022 covid come. One way another, Trump survive Virus he's 'fighter'. survived treatment cost around half fucking million.

How say that? uncle 75 history cancers. Covid basically got cold symptoms.

Not every 70something needs cyberware, biotech, black magic survive Covid. Even 70/80somethings majority require hospitalization. Aside groceries beer, dancing wife back yard, taking care 90 year old mother? Yes can. No, thats point won‚Äôt be. call pandemic doesn‚Äôt automatically mean lockdown. ongoing pandemics almost nothing for. Ok! make kids wear seatbelt car though ? Ok. real role model. child discipline issues. step back listen said. child perfectly happy going pricy private school goes every day day long. great. Wonderful actually. worried can‚Äôt can‚Äôt thrive even survive distance learning. happy help child well distance learning. That‚Äôs great. maybe consider can‚Äôt. remember reading article.... can't remember big 3 think Pfizer.... said would know works (but approved yet) beginning October. take year two vaccinate entire world. I, Western upper-middle-class city resident, receive shot arm next spring/summer. exhausted social distancing want spend disposable income used to. Governments entertainment providers allow to. article says ""has firmly taken hold across much United States"" cites 3 states specifically.

I know cases rise worrisome wish reporting little even. also wish fact hospitalization fatality rate far lower initially would reported. went whole summer around \~500 cases daily, that's mostly Silesia. vaccine going maybe 60-75% effective. behavior still affect people vaccinated unlucky. 

I would hate get vaccinated get sick population thought  anti vaxxers still get sick. thousand thanks updates information compilations! Yeah, that's going work well, it? well yes, two days ago bought pastries clerk mask all, behind plexi glass. bakery. BAKERY. product packed, rather sitting ready eat. breathed hours. Congratulations, officially dumbest argument I've heard month. Well coronavirus won‚Äôt ever eradicated, won‚Äôt pandemic forever. seriously think we‚Äôll wear masks distance rest lives? New Zealand Taiwan great whole time -- may also help island nation easily trace people coming in/out quarantine  makes perfect sense. move around 14 minutes, never catch virus. bulletproof.

Well, unless moved within six feet another infected person. fucked. Nonsense. works.

That's works. Oxford's vaccine 100% efficacy two doses Phase 1 trial.

‚ÄúEfficacy‚Äù phase 1 trial means people made antibodies. didn‚Äôt test whether people protected catching virus, everyone talking they‚Äôre trying estimate effective vaccine be. everyone Colorado does. plenty home-grown dumbasses like every state (see previously posted articles places anti-mask examples). _also_ fair number people visiting national parks getting legal weed (and soon skiing here). large enough group people, visiting wear masks act respectfully. true. Why? make kid wear pants , ?  This. Waiting Fauci movie book. Bless dude. test lot too? either way still staggeringly high Also curious this. exactly open/isn‚Äôt? office workers going in? needs happen US...but so-called leaders care money human life. like ""six foot social distancing"" thing. see lot places like schools churches trying safe enforcing ""six foot social distance"" people assuming they're safe. six feet rough guideline, harder breathing (say, talking singing), coughing (cloud 23 feet, according recent study), AC, etc affect large cloud make six feet nearly enough safety.

Six feet great standing line grocery store. nearly enough movie theater. might able socialize still avoid crowds wear masks since less half population truly protected.

As quiet person 40s, avoiding crowds normal lifestyle. young people, sports fans, frequent concert goers, going normal them. getting rid this. like look doesn‚Äôt mean normal. never never be. mean, permanently staying away everyone might option recluse two. everyone shut-in NEET. restrictions disappear shortly vaccination campaign.

Let's reset conversation: 
There literally hundreds reports news healthy young people experiencing debilitating long term effects. sound pretty dumb short sighted prospect weakened heart permanent sensory damage doesnt scare you. Looks like need defund airlines global safety Yes, charge murder selfish. agree. want ignore science many dying around create conditions people die, need take personal responsibility actions. charged murder. Anyone else getting tired back forth saying shit keep compliance? ""Our posterior estimates basic reproduction number (R) Wuhan City, China 2019-2020 reached values 3.49 (95%CrI: 3.39-3.62)"" someone thick makes middle age always baffle me. DC baby. That‚Äôs NE right? Lol going feel bad somone warned repeatedly yet still deliberately points gun foot pulls trigger swear bullets exist. test negative wouldn‚Äôt worry much perhaps wearing mask could give peace mind. wouldn‚Äôt worry transmission shipped things you, don‚Äôt let tinfoil hats subreddit convince otherwise. So, higher last month?

I guess ""highest since August"" sounds dramatic. That's nice. Looks press releasey. test supposed show virus actively replicating high viral load is. Assuming works stretch assume involved superspreading. may still useful test, though, assuming works since could determine difference actively shedding virions testing positive rtPCR due presence viral debris. Think they‚Äôll need 5 people Lockdowns masks delay herd immunity, delay vaccine high-risk populations. right survive vaccine arrives might stay open though, since already takeaway service window. much spreading going there. Exactly. yet see evidence schools superspreader events. Kids likely catch outside school rather catching school.

Assuming course schools taking precautions. bookstores. Lots scientists questioning additional lockdowns Honestly, going sound pretty whiny petty, worst part pandemic wear mask everywhere socially distance grocery store, even avoid eating restaurants. things annoying doable year so. pre-pandemic hobbies involved outdoor activities (hiking, camping, mountain biking, running, etc.) pretty much impossible things solitude without running crowds. 

Every single worthwhile outdoor activity nowadays mobbed beyond belief weekends (and even week work). Even something simple going run nearby trail exercise dodging strollers dog-walkers now. blame people - we're forced situation trying protect community. stressful hell makes want sit inside, get fat, wait blow over. Stop fat America flippant - within 100 years, everyone thread dead something... unless cryogenics really takes off! people die everyday sorts different stuff look it. sorts illnesses concern particular source. says I‚Äôm mask-wearing? social distancing? I‚Äôm saying numbers don‚Äôt lie: young healthy overwhelmingly fine, mass national lockdowns necessary cause harm good. science says virus won‚Äôt kill dangerously affect young, healthy adults. highly developed countries probably get faster countries world like Western Europe, Japan/Singapore, Canada/USA/Australia. 

So basically ""first-world"" countries total 1.5 billion so? Let's round 2 billion numbers sake....so 7.6 million doses per day roughly 8 - 9 months vaccine people. 

But yeah getting people live like Tibet - that's going major pain ass 10.000 hospitalized massive üò≥ Well, busted wheel bike repair shop right supposed pick tomorrow seems like going happen based list. think get free pass anything

Right US, we're lucky get available vaccine six months now.  would take years vaccines medications works, one help significantly derail COVID end 2021. Especially since goal positivity 5%. know, half idiot thought. talk Corona Airborne

wait 


how think transmits then?? virus travels air. airborne definition? almost SARS-Cov-2 respiratory virus transmissible airborne droplet, airborne transmission likely colder weather people indoors often and/or virus remain suspended air longer lower relative humidity. *Perfect* Dorms kind mix bag. work, managed put everyone individual room time being.

And wrong waste money. Yeah, still took massive measures compared country. lockdown whatsoever mask mandates even mask recommendations. real restriction 50 person event limit.

And see people breaking rules world right now. Trump rallies obviously making better US unique regard. real question ""what hell wrong world?"". Well indoors vast majority transmission happens, matter much mandated outdoors. Masks ""while consuming"" would work anyway, long pubs open, would solution? agree closed! can't solve masks. However, last winter also started 0% immunity former hotspots 25+%, nobody wearing masks, packed public transit, idea treat it.

The first wave immunity places like NYC likely useful. herd immunity? No, even close. think would likely get infected also lost likely super spreaders. people likely already immune. course still spread vast majority population isn't, much slower rate bus drivers, delivery people, cashier's etc already it. I'm really sorry hear that. Hang there. Easily believed, even grocery stores good mask enforcement given up. going inside another building unless absolutely necessary. What's lollipop tree? ‚ÄúSevere heart damage occurred young, healthy people, rare.‚Äù Nope. Overpopulation also figure people long term effects.

We can‚Äôt really support forever... US lot game plan. universal health care, willpower accept higher taxes people‚Äôs care.

This going burden economy closures long term. reopening essentially predatory loan financial perspective. Omg teacher, comments like one saying ‚Äúteachers DoNT WanNA go WoRk‚Äù kill me. 

Ive never worked harder LIFE distance learning. (And hybrid bc school allowing small groups kids come back) Young antisocial here, would problem excuse avoid people! Vaccinating risk groups would greatly reduce fatality rate, yes. young people spreading unrestrictedly would still carry potential overwhelming hospital system.

Like, imagine entire concert hall's worth people getting infected once. title actually misleading Uber investigating replacement workforce. mean virus barely cares people 40 killing decorating. got pumpkins I'm going carve light up, porch lights out. Giving candy one absolute favorite things, I've going ideas distancing trying safely. came conclusion want reward parents made bad choice taking kids out. Yes, kids going standard Halloween, holidays normal since Valentines Day. reality. mean, yeah, would love comfortable enough give candy, people US ding-dongs decided prioritize ""muh freedumbs"" instead hunkering weeks. Nothing normal right trick treating another casualty. Kids survive it. Deaths back hundreds, mental health lost lockdown nothing still 1st wave. little bit everything. People pandemic fatigue, government part. never proper lockdown.
Everyone getting complacent it. Yet covid relief things worse ever Canadian dropping say, yes valid, United States. worldwide. could say thing flu.

And please spare ‚Äúpermanent organ damage‚Äù articles random news sources Wtf? anti-maskers think? Relax edgelord wrong. Please stop saying asinine things. hypertensive, envelop COVID, end respirator die 6 weeks later, didn‚Äôt die hypertension. died COVID. 

Even 6 weeks respirator allowed slowly improve go home, long term effects, including chronic respiratory issues long term respirator use, aren‚Äôt hypertension. COVID respirator use. 

I‚Äôm old. slip fall ice easily. fall break leg, it‚Äôs slip fall easily. It‚Äôs ice fall on, fell fashion enough force break bone. 

Comorbities don‚Äôt cause death. absence COVID, person would died. Welcome permanent lockdown, Czech Republic! remember, two weeks flatten curve! Mainly talk criteria be. manufacturers people clearing schedule attend data ready till November December respectively Yeah surround dumb dumbs don‚Äôt wear masks social distance get super spreader events. Doubt that‚Äôll stop happening virus continues running dumb dumbs. personally consider things back normal fear gone now. one scared COVID anymore. Two weeks party??? Count in! Maybe someone household it...but otherwise way. would also isolate person. Clearly can‚Äôt isolate...bigger reason wear mask. correct decision, won‚Äôt stop anyone getting virus anyway

That's stupid. still hard grasp people? 

In past 48 hours I've seen three people die asymptomatic college student came work. Known case numbers college currently well 100. 

Do believe student somehow limits ability shed infect others? think coincidence numbers climbed sharply since schools got going again? likely one easiest, least brutal flu seasons ever. mitigation place COVID also helps fight spread flu.

Tomorrow's Headline: Oregon GOP Candidate Says Mask Mandate ""cost trillions"" Destroy Small Businesses. No, 2 examples. understand concern concerned it. It‚Äôs concerning. Fuck what's Canada's population compared EU? fucking shit.  getting downvoted providing whole picture.

Lol.

The whole picture would focus deaths, also ""recovered"" still health issues disease, perhaps including financial burden ""survive"" live with.

The whole picture would include data learned transmission contact tracing. Contract tracing largely absent due host failures political leadership.

Etc. relaxation restrictions causing Europe massive second spike despite first lockdown getting control, people continually claim US would normal life locked better spring summer? 

It seems clear lockdowns work, stay locked forever Ok, country collapse, right? Hence lockdown absolutely required.

Brazil 100% open many months now, come lockdown ""mandatory"" there? nice sounds, one‚Äôs that. can‚Äôt keep pushing back goalpost want people 100% okay that.

What else? stop kissing husband hug kids we're it?

Also one family member tests positive members household forced see point like think things worse April. Hospitals run New York Navy bring hospital ship patients getting treated pop hospital park.  


There many test available back April. 


Also treatment came along way since April. drugs help get virus. Nah it‚Äôs clinical depression comes goes covid opportunities schools.

that like unicorn???? Thank you. great news. read this? solution everyone wears masks, get this.  

But people selfishly wearing masks jerks ruining everyone, pandemic dragging on. That's get - wear masks, distance, etc.

When that, virus spread less.  Less Americans die.

The key selfish asshole. part team America yo. bno. got placebo can't. workplace likely want job. Private property owners right decide rules properties, including dress code. mean seeing worldwide increases temps dropping, March / April large install base. is? understand isn‚Äôt outcome, think non-lethal events serious enough warrant restrictive measures don‚Äôt elicit fear population whole death.

I also don‚Äôt know percentage COVID cases become ‚Äúlong-haulers.‚Äù gather it‚Äôs fairly small.

I think, though, death makes society support restrictions normal life way has, get pace around 100,000/year (which like 2/3 3/4 reduction depending things go), clear fully reopen restrictions. government, think, lose mandate them. American Warsaw here. Paris couple weeks ago, everyone wearing masks, wearing correctly. Warsaw, it‚Äôs joke many people nose sticking masks, substantial amount people masks chins.

South Korea already proven time time again. 450 deaths TOTAL population ~50 Million. 70 times less deaths per capita US. 70 TIMES. isn‚Äôt also shame happens people god damn stupid can‚Äôt bother read information ask questions think rationally? something like article causes WW3 let us die. 3rd wave hospitalizations since 2nd never broke record first wave, likely 3rd fizzle too.

Also, second wave ""fizzle."" Deaths went lot. 

In think missing basic thing here: March/April, much testing. number CONFIRMED cases July right means fewer ACTUAL cases number confirmed cases March. mean death rate changed much. Wednesday, state reporting 534 hospitalizations, 501 Tuesday ‚Äî another daily state record. past 24 hours, 90 patients admitted. Also, 134 patients ICU, 122 Tuesday.

Iowa also around 14-day average 10% test positivity We‚Äôre making individual bags. put table bags end driveway. fire pit sit 8-10 feet away table. ooh aah kids costumes never groups mix. feel like it‚Äôs win us. (My kids teens won‚Äôt TOT) shouldnhave trouble providing reporting documents symptoms. Unless say, belief, unfounded im reality. again, 10 days drug, 10 days symptom free armt window yet. enough profit made fucking soldier man. Glad ok Sure thing.


Tell place never lived. 

Next, talk job never performed actually it? Identified cases rose 233,912¬†and known deaths at¬†5,854. :( fairly high fever, cough, runny nose, overall weakness, felt like going pass every step took etc. Sturgis Dakota? 

Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska close North Dakota, none anything rest country.

But I'm sure something too, right? Yknow, ‚ÄúI try eat less it,‚Äù ‚ÄúI love find difficult part with,‚Äù ‚Äúis way still part‚Äù goes long way looking like current crowd ‚ÄúyoU cAn‚Äôt mAKe weAR mASk‚Äù comes making changes lives help one another, really ourselves. Agreed. See neighbors. politicians chose open schools hill die on. 

Idk, I'm worried indoor restaurants/bars working people still partying without practical restriction private events. increasing numbr lf corona idiots treating social distancing human rights violation  Poorer people get hit harder, minorities poorer average. That‚Äôs basically story it‚Äôs really annoying many threads I‚Äôve seen sub people treat inscrutable mystery. There‚Äôs also additionally direct discrimination healthcare (numerous studies show exists) darker skin naturally able absorb much vitamin D. second Ezekiel said.

We tiny intimate office. first feel sick, tested everyone. closest colleague also hung pub work got it. suspect two us got jointly time external party.

We pass work colleagues. ended completely asymptomatic maybe symptoms allowed us pull rotation, got lucky. perhaps spread anyway.

It given get work. likely family, children them. think it. symptoms like? Could stop trolling?  number patients hospitalized statewide known suspected COVID-19 cases 832 Tuesday, 777 inpatients Monday. Tuesday's 832 inpatients highest reported since Aug. 26. peak Arizona's surge July, number hospitalized patients suspected confirmed virus exceeded number patients suspected known COVID-19 intensive care units across Arizona 171 Tuesday, compared 170 Monday 177 Sunday, highest since Sept. 11. level far July, ICU beds use COVID-19 reached 970. Iowa reported record high COVID-19 deaths Wednesday, 31 people dying novel coronavirus along with¬†an additional 1,276¬†confirmed cases. state also reported 534 people hospitalized, topping Tuesday's high 501. yeah definitely agree that. Pretty sad Europe well long seem given up. I've honestly impressed Cuomo New York. Let's see maintain shut areas Brooklyn suburbs Orthodox Jewish community allowed virus spiral control. seems like pretty good pulse situation shutting hotspots relatively quickly. example Cuomo shutting anywhere higher three percent positivity rate week. Compare areas rest country kind ridiculous. hopefully keep up. wish type national response similar doing. lot criticism handle virus initially give credit think he's done pretty damn good job since let's see keep Lol guys seem see certain articles, covid19 related articles designed way. mean intrest self preservation wouldnt make sense wanna take vaccine people randomly dropped dead human trials?

Seriously though, motivation something might help get kids back school even 1 minute sooner, I'm in. forgot classic KILLING GRANDMAS!!! everything leave house. i‚Äôd recommend read around internet see much field study changed years. there‚Äôs great material doctors working specifically obesity. mantra diet + exercise = results antiquated point time frankly, bad advice someone really overweight obese. proper nutrition varies person person, sadly requires lot money find right balance. fact, exercise really isn‚Äôt great weight loss, though super drug overall health. 

getting obese person take 15 gentle minute walk every hour two, example, followed journaling said walk makes feel enormously effective training exhausted course 30mins-1hr telling eat protein veggies.

Let's hope virus shy type. selfish behaviour many younger people pandemic haunt everyone. Decent code mediocre irrelevant outside Covid-scenario? I'm one conspiracy theorists believes there's media plot keep us terrified, there's much wilfully dishonest reporting cherry picking scientific studies since March.

It conspiracy. Media business terror attention makes money. *Especially* online advertising-funded news make money literally *from click*, extension people sharing social media, subscription patronage.

The conspiracy think organized effort based sinister agenda. new company finds money-making model way. like tabloids lie celebrities. conspiracy celebrities tons people want read shit. sells.

In opinion big question details reporting least fundamentally truthful, even they're spun sensationalized, least we're getting real news something with. like FOX actual conspiracy garbage.

For worth getting hang news sources try little harder maintain journalistic integrity despite short term financial pressures means get flat-out ignore errant headlines come across internet.

Thank flair. Terrible news obviously, worst case scenario. Looks like we're right track 50k+ daily confirmed cases Hi Dr. Yasmin. 

Just curiosity thoughts colleague Dr. Jay B ?

Thank answer concept using placebo stems two main tenants modern medicine: 1. harm, slight misnomer almost therapies level risk/side effects associated them. Thus, given treatment's benefits out-weigh risks perceived downsides. 

2. placebo effect, rather, power human mind's expectation benefit treatment, \*even treatment known useless\* next step anything. sham treatment lowest possible intervention could produce benefit risk whatsoever. underestimate this: studies even shown improved outcomes even patients explicitly told receiving mock treatment real thing. 

Thus, least risky intervention simply giving someone sugar pill saying help them. new therapies show risks worth produce statistically better results placebo alone, since placebo treatment best solution concept ""Do Harm"". is, shown risks therapy worth benefits. 


An ELI5 would say need assess vaccine offers statistically significant protection compared administering saline injections, since started large-scale administration saline injections treatment would non-zero improvement protection virus. 


Not quite sure explained well enough not, saw edit guess wasted time typing up.  PRC, VN, AUS NZ eradicated virus. RoK supressed.

We one-eyed among blind cost flattening curve cold season far greater South-Korean style TTI system even PRC style hard lockdown. hopefully people wait weeks ""it's over"" haha one better anecdotally: got pneumonia 2014. permanently raised blood pressure, still high spite years meds, accidentally (as showed ultrasound) led thyroid cancer diagnosis. 

That thyroid cancer resulted parathyroid glands damaged thyroid removed, longer absorb calcium food. Took years Endo figure last part. prize getting constant fatigue taken seriously? Pills lyfe!!! Whoooop!!!!

My money still Pfizer though. would care metro areas used metro taxes metro purposes, left rest state pray roads bridges together.

Anyone laughing people's misfortune trash. competition, winners. still 2 weeks behind Italy like early days May? /somewhatsarcasm

I remember watching Italy's numbers closely May, knowing US 2 weeks behind following pattern. wonder US stands terms following countries second wave footsteps.  UF? understanding telling professors willing person teaching retire. forgetting older professors bring research $ school part reason academic rank. Yep, Pfizer really blowing water, already 40k people gotten first dose vaccine, 34k gotten 2nd dose vaccine. original goal 30k people, increased 44k people, think increased 48k include 4k kids. I'd say Crisis Management 101 (just look CM textbook) says following: every crisis crisis information. lose control information, lose control crisis. means communicating public happening, expect see happen coming weeks/months, every person protect country. Unfortunately, we've seen repeat blunders pandemic response lack cohesive messaging.  yauy go 35% unemployment mass bankruptcy , deterioration currency everyone loses everything they've saved ! thousands die medical system collapsing costs elderly get pension cuts half starve ... point another lockdown form first would one shot kill entire economy rather painful longe lasting way. Yeah, pretty stupid idea. think would un-blind go?

 thought wanted least 50+ number placebo infections releasing phase III results. Or, 50 total regardless placebo? Well almost 8 months pass inside, go insane came [For uninformed like know said. logical inference. I, personally, following CDC guidelines. Look, I'm sorry actual human contact several months. obviously affected mental health. think *can* want encourage to. Testing already easily available state, sure yours. Relax. Get sub couple weeks, feel better bombarded covid news 247 FloriDUH updated numbers yet today gubbenor talking stopping daily updates, there's that. (numbers come around 11:30, 5 hours late) sounds really dumb. even go inside hospital? Even one time? means could touching surfaces holding hospital staff infecting hospital people, I'm guessing would need regularly work disinfect inside outside every min/hrs. Also fuck standing line waiting sit parked car wait.

In Vic(melb) drive car parks every suburb two. get car, swab that's it. even hospital staff trained testers. test stay home wait however long pay time wait miss work encourages people get tested. test positive Well it‚Äôs gonna many many years person classes resume. Nah, worst case would reinfections always worse subsequent time.

Sure. throw food shortages, war, broken supply chains, collapsing infrastructure civil unrest comprehensive idea worst-case scenario might entail. florida problem while.

so people numbered 1-10 get line. number 7 tests positive number 5 left early, end day get positive results sent person 8th line negative results sent person originally 7 (now 6) does! right. love people poverty, therefore love people put ovens Hitler‚Äôs orders. figured well? hire psychologist. Lol, one it? inconsistent. Anti-vaccine campaigns already problem pandemic. They've gotten worse, especially among people fear science rushed. (I'd argue science quickly possible safety compromised. fact, pausing vaccine trials proof safety taken seriously.) way, caveats include Russian vaccine trials transparency data sharing. 

One strategy remind people following: 1) Anti-vaccine groups taking advantage current crisis foment even distrust science 2) Yes, trials done quickly possible safety testing still critical part 3) anticipate even anti-vaccine content circulate online communities anti-vaccine groups exploiting fear. 

This last point especially help people giving heads *should* expect anti-vaccine content spread need pause, take breath, verify source information even critical believe RT forward information vaccines. nypost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* feel like honestly fair though. Kids notoriously nasty germ spreaders even necessarily get sick virus, gonna ask teachers risk lives every single day getting exposed hundreds them? Herd immunity. Let's let virus run rampant everyone gets diabetes dies 6 months later they're longer immune. think k12 schools probably one things driving resurgence seeing. prime conditions spreading and, know, kids may necessarily show symptoms, hard outwardly identify anyone may positive. current occupant White House kicked out, new administration seek implement closures schools receiving federal funding. I‚Äôm sure court battles, don‚Äôt see shouldn‚Äôt pass muster. Winter likely make much worse people close houses spend less time outdoors.  non-European I've got absolutely problem EU decision whatever reason deem necessary. seem odd admittedly non-expert understanding, given current regional [positivity currently 3.3%, various EU countries range 2% (Germany) 26% (Czech Republic). 27 EU countries, seems Germany, Denmark, Greece, 3 Baltic States currently lower Canada.

I'm sure total EU average is, can't find data presented way. surely must much higher Canada, though?

I guess must simply things getting worse around world, that's even reason risk adding imported cases.

Edit: Sorry Luxembourg too! mixture things.
The leadership great. Even though acted pretty quickly first wave, always bit hodge-podge measures. come concrete plan, taking account thing going go away soon. 

The second factor people themselves. Even people tried abide rules first, got sick summer. 
Plenty people planned large gatherings, secret parties woods, etc. 

At low point positive test rate 0.4%, 50 - 70 confirmed cases day. total amount infectious people country estimated around 1000-2000. people got careless again. 

It probably help great summer start autumn, people (mostly) travel freely across Europe we're densely populated country. Currently need explain impact false positive rate Corona PCR tests, especially (probably) false positive rate 0.008 would apply positive rate 0.01. actually tested? local testing center wait line, car right testing tent, get personal information, pull test immediately after. unless drive jacked truck there's way give information leave without tested University supposed fun? students begging graduate fast possible. Environmental conditions indoor spaces year round though, fomites major vector we‚Äôd definitely know strategy insane painfully flawed misinterpretation CDC's ""15 minute close contact"" students moved around within time, thinking goes, one ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù required stay home classmate tests disease experts say moving students around every minutes actually likely increase transmission virus, exposing people infected student. also complicate contact tracing efforts, evidence-based practice sound scientific policy,‚Äù said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, epidemiologist John Hopkins Center Health Security¬† 

Edits - goddamn I'm getting visceral reaction thinking it

And Montana's largest school district 16,000 students across 30 different schools... I'm scheduled third round 'is covid allergies?' week. 2 negative tests far, geez feel bad allergies. worst year allergies life Mental gymnastics Yea, us fatties still fear diabeties heart disease more. Don‚Äôt mention eating get healthy way. confused people take seriously get it?   Yellow ribbon magnet car? Look closely, first step validating first step: safety (no surprise, vaccine inactivated vaccine, established safe type vaccine)

The second step efficacy, given piece, I'm sure come move forward Phase 3 clinical trial

&amp;#x200B;

Only 35% volunteers showed mild adverse reactions vaccination. Among volunteers, common adverse reactions first vaccination pain injection site (19%) headache (15%). second vaccination, common adverse reactions injection-site pain (19%), headache (10%) fatigue (4%). 0.1% volunteers low-grade fever, serious adverse reactions 1000km could get basically anywhere France. studies go outline it‚Äôs combination factors, including better protocols taking covid patients, improved therapies, experienced healthcare workers, less overwhelmed hospitals, masks reducing viral loads disease severity more.

As therapeutics, remdesivir doesn‚Äôt significant effect mortality shortening hospital stay, frees resources patients. Meanwhile, dexamethasone significant survival benefit

As expert listened to, that‚Äôs anecdote one person one hospital, statistically robust study. two given equal weight actual fuck insane strategy ?!

YIKES wonder much lower car accident deaths injuries are? put 500 miles car span usually drive 5,000. know driving miles really tanked insurance companies widespread free premium rebates.

Typically there‚Äôs 36,000 deaths per year 3 million injuries US. brain fried right now. think acknowledging number factors go ifr, controlled human behavior politics factors nature thing. whatever. Peace. Well, Spanish Flu fizzled 2 years. Hopefully might case Covid already effective vaccine. feel that, WI fucked well Trump. Walker rest WisGOP set stage bullshit decade ago. strategy based definition ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù requiring quarantine ‚Äî within 6 feet infected person 15 minutes more. students moved around within time, thinking goes, one ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù required stay home classmate tests positive.  Reports like speaking wordly, Western countries get first... c'est la vie. Yup, took like... 30-40 years?

Looks like COVID vaccines promising. Thank God. Ya that's similar Washington. stupid simple also pretty decent metrics things considered. Sadly, also lot stupid people. Remember happened several months governor Ron DeSantis quickly deemed professional wrestling ‚Äúessential business‚Äú, allowing continue operations.

Such ridiculously Florida thing lol increase looking insane worldwide, might hit 500,000 November. Thank posting this. makes think stop one?

I'm honestly asking. COVID going anywhere soon, vaccine nowhere near completion, even magically got one tomorrow, it'll take months distribute. number cases spiral control again, think hard lock down?  Using excess mortality it? hear anyone cough anymore, almost always little kid. little kids (who required wear masks) perfect open-mouthed cough sounds like death looks like they're spraying everything two-mile radius viruses. Cat videos still going strong friend, ongoing wave wave. god created life Earth room evolution occured? 

I'm sincere curiosity. get schools teach see believing creationism exclude evolution viable parallel occurence. heard vitamin deficiency contribute severity Covid19. wondering anyone heard someone gotten Covid19 great vitamin experience bad, bad what? Agreed, job happens option meeting person, many people company (including myself) take option work home. mean situation forced everybody, least thoughts given can't WFH easily. I'm wearing cat ears holding bottle wine right hand. Exactly, people think inconvenienced now? wait get covid develop long term health issues. inconvenience much much greater. Don‚Äôt forget suspending raises/retirement match/merit bonuses. Festivals in... Wisconsin? seems weird me, pandemic pandemic. Okay, know, festival it? Would nice covered nose too. Bonus points pulling down/off talk phone. Yeah, people need see sides it. Yes, herd immunity awful idea, lot people blindly support restrictions idea facilitate end pandemic. That's really case. believe vaccine around corner (I do), worth keeping restrictions. don't, somehow think restrictions end pandemic sooner, dead wrong.

Herd immunity work. around ages. around small pox, disease children. However, herd immunity mean gone. means susceptible population low enough spreading exponentially anymore.  Covid-19 killed Americans age 65 months flu killed Americans ages 7 past 10 years.


And probably 8 10 years Every piece available evidence says many. Yeah agree. think viable discussions around level activity. also based expectation failure (rising case counts) met roll backs. 

And also agree testing tracing needs heavily increased (and mask mandates across board). 

It seems actually get tests contact tracing levels up, never let community spread drop low enough current capacity adequate. really needed stick uniform policy across 50 states another 20 days transition slowly test/trace. know doesn‚Äôt one other, right? Countries strict lockdowns along comprehensive testing tracing able go back normal.

Edit: false dilemma others pointed  ""Everybody dies"" Yes, using inductive reasoning, pretty strong case. Seems socially distanced Halloween would work.
Have people rig tubes drop candies out. I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs US judging hospitalization trends going Canada judging nasty things said Australian fellow Canadians Reddit. 2 subreddits aware spout ‚Äúanti lockdown‚Äù general overall 2020 skepticism day long. read week couldn‚Äôt believe reading wanted know felt way. exceptionally nasty people don‚Äôt read anymore. masks cause Covid everybody knows üôÑ Yes, that's exactly correct. may mildly thirsty hour two sit motionless plane!

That's generous, I'd assume summer best. definitely good news, regardless reason it. don‚Äôt masks help airborn viruses? always thought masks effective like droplets it‚Äôs literal air... mention assumes we‚Äôd perfect fitting masks... isn‚Äôt true. 

However, even don‚Äôt work 100% still keep viral load wearing one. Seems like filtering even half virus better completely exposed it. 

Sadly like one work wears one. try often I‚Äôll take I‚Äôm around anyone bit. Occasionally someone walk I‚Äôll forget put back :( Except equal others. George Orwell lol, already wrong, bootlicking fool. That's said. said deaths. think Florida fucking big time show 100 percent correct. would hope airlines realize run super spreader flights people fly another 6 months satire :)

To anyone living semi-normal life, I'm happy you, please keep mind many us, we're living sustainable lives conditions something change. literally done anything fun since May. People charge WFH jobs relatively normal lives minus masks/sports/gatherings really need appreciate awful people whose schedules completely dictated restrictions.

This argument lowering restrictions they're still necessary, argument lowering soon possible also understanding less WFH/fixed schedule neighbors. flu mutates lot, guess year strain target, there's one COVID-19 strain really worry right first instinct would cover mask-covered mouth. feel like removing mask takes conscious thought/effort, unless (generic you, personally) removing mask cough sneeze many times already become habit think about. guess may right. democrats orchestrating fake pandemics since year 165?

Do actually think space reality something given moment, amount hype media drums up?

Let ask something. Say 100 patients hospital due virus, fifty days 98, two came day. Would think ""the highest¬†numbers since August"" good way think hospital doing, would maybe want view broader picture consider much number patients increased overall? somehow still lowest Covid numbers U.S. Well said man, well said.

Damn. numbers studies back assertion current studies excess deaths point towards opposite - covid deaths US undercounted.

And even covid deaths properly accounted US, epidemiologists take account make estimates total deaths covid. Wisconsin, sympathize Wisconsin folks right thing:

2. First infection moderate severe: person strong immune response memory t-cells antibodies. Second infection asymptomatic mild.

Suppose two countries B. early pandemic countries enact lockdown lockdowns *identical*. Three months lockdown examine statistics see following:

Country 0 deaths per million.

Country B 100 deaths per million.

Country looks lot better learn infected people first place. proves point: Two countries *exact thing* outcome (number dead people) different.

You might argue country B enacted lockdown earlier thus would better end, would true, would also prove point. all, *exactly* thing. time. timing factors well.

Other things likely matter: Population density, often people use public transport, common people close physical contact, common people go public places etc. etc. Time waster troll far 24 confirmed reinfections 40,000,000+ confirmed cases. telling many unconfirmed cases actually are.

The article viruses work. work similarly.

We completely stop vaccinating small pox. got vaccine 2005. certain groups people still get vaccinated still slight live moderately sized city Midwest. hospital officially capacity sending people smaller hospitals around us. enough SARS-CoV-2 mingles MERS host often enough might get something like nightmare virus.

EDIT: read previous comments.. ;) ""Right Life"" party. wish they'd give fraction concern born microscopic cell clumps.

Instead Trumpettes confuse common sense oppressive-Communism, rebel minor restrictions keep putting us situation go major restrictions. say nothing suffering death happens along way. give much credit. bottling factory near house supposed shut due outbreak. defying close order...

**we deal hypotheticals actual numbers** Non medical face masks particularly effective keeping virus out. help preventing spread virus infected. Denying point ludicrous.

You're talking anecdotal hundreds maybe versus millions instances happened.

There's also many variables researchers still determining figure happening, degree.

It's ludicrous bunch armchair redditors pretend remotely understand science behind speak authority. exactly point full draconian lockdown already early September inevitable would come this? 

The difference unnecessary death many thousands. 

And like we've seen movie -- gradual restrictions effect, choice left lockdown. ""Grandma, order crack cocaine darkweb again?!""

Personally think put efforts making remote learning better, making accessible disadvantaged communities, supporting childcare confuse education daycare. 

What ended given push reopen schools worse either alternative - massive disruption opening closing opening closing again. disruption may greater impact COVID-19.

But sure, I'm picking 70% hill die on. seems best estimate we've got moment we'll see data comes in.

But suppose time vaccine rolled out, 10% exposed, 90% get 90% taking vaccine, could make 75% effective vaccine 10%+90%*90%*75% ‚âà 70% immunity _just_ make threshold.

There vaccine. 
The thing matters keeping hospitals reaching capacity. 
If reach capacity, lockdown happens. 
No hospital Canada anywhere near capacity. might part it, feel also Asian governments stepped fight thing head on, whereas western governments blamed, denied offered minimal help 11th hour. getting downvoted agree seasonal mask use Western countries become common in-line high use Asian countries. Hand shaking probably gone too. old tiger died pretty early on. say 10 million? Likely none. leading candidates produce antibodies infection. Seeing coronaviruses always circulate, definitely wont see go away. yea imagine czech republic population 12 000 cases today.  thoughts exactly imagine environmentalists felt last 20 years, slowly watching planet burnt death... 70% necessarily required herd immunity. Herd immunity magic number. consider existing immunity previous infections innate unexplained immunity people seem have, fact pandemic primarily super spreader driven, may need near 70% people get vaccinated achieve normalcy. People average live larger spaces. we're already highest amount concurrently infected we've ever had. We're also seeing record high number infections per day. yes, objectively speaking, situation live worse worsening. Please, enlighten spreading misinformation.

The important distinction make current testing rate testing rate peak infections spring. highest amount concurrently infected tested positive. due low testing numbers back spring (as article linked points out), actual numbers infected far higher back then.

Of course due exponential growth may heading towards level infections again, case yet. prove point? American state funded education trash gotta brag going private unis.

Oh funny thing going shitty schools like Pomona require buy way lol Add ""we're together"" list ways broadcast information virus. quote High School Musical accurately represent giant wealth gap slow economic recovery created mitigation measures. Implicit bias medical care existed long time:

- bias limited race, also comes play gender age. 

-  know sure enough data gathered phase 3. now, see comment here. wish people took seriously. :(

I said thing 2016 election. I‚Äôm pretty sure Black Death killed people per capita Spanish flu. level contact tracing China feasible West due privacy issues. personally support better contact tracing, lot people happily provide privacy movement information corporations like Google also say would rather risk death grant governments access data. base spread numbers indicate upwards 1 billion infected; woth time metric.

10% ICUs rate time; 10% 1billion low end. Beacause myth going Sweden dont care elderly. true since really good keeping alive (5th best world) best world (1th place) giving quality life. vaccine currently *limited temporary* registration permits offered certain high-risk groups emergency situation rules (as now, number doses distributed among healthcare workers, teachers next group access). time phase 3 trials running, *full registration*, permit general public use, granted sufficient amount data phase 3 available (last I've heard - expected around January).

Also forget matter manufacturing (production needs scaled research industrial volumes). Current projections put 800k doses November, 1.5mln December, 3mln January 15mln month Spring (source Russian becoming adamant belief 99% people read actual articles, instead drawing conclusions headlines hearsays. could save worlds climate... USA! USA! USA!  sounds like stopping spread covid can‚Äôt really quarantine away lol I‚Äôm stuck crosshairs. I‚Äôd go family two weeks also don‚Äôt take virus serious all. It‚Äôs super annoying cause we‚Äôve gone long without going go help sister move promised would, even tho promise whole fucking pandemic. Pretty sure trying list another example bad messaging. Sorry downvotes. think maybe missed part said personal experience? I'm ambassador talking behalf country live (Switzerland) entirety EU. I'm giving anecdotal experience. stated beginning post, clear throughout.

But since brought data, worse Switzerland ever been. We're already highest amount concurrently infected we've ever had. We're also seeing record high number infections per day. yes, objectively speaking, situation live worse worsening. Please, enlighten spreading misinformation. People behaving like normal months! understand No. I'm talking *actual troll*. Nythro's big doom-spreader. sure meant 50% effective thing talked about, true

As many experts reiterated ... eradication nearly impossible idea reduce transmission, deaths load healthcare ... something even partially effective vaccine help with. official language reddit.com english. flip side, many would others kill considering medical advancement last 100 years getting stuff wrong. 

For example, reinfection COVID thought immunity wearing off, due different strains. different strains different ways matter. 

Also, said COVID mutates rapidly, that's case. somewhere order 1,000 times slower mutation flu, instance. Coronaviruses mutate rapidly self-correcting mechanism copy something like flu have. Huh? implying I'm kind bot? I'm also Australia different state, cases spiked 700 people mostly care homes died 6 weeks so, we've lockdown 12 13 weeks.
It's easing night time curfew, hospitality, cinemas, gyms, hairdressers retail shut, emergency surgery only, travel 5ks home lots restrictions.
It's tough we're coming side now, second lockdown came one month came first we've 4 weeks semi normal life since March.
Cabin fever sets in, people get pissed angry, bickering lockdown ratchets up, friends getting sick old folks dying.
So yeah, always help people tell stay strong, hear you. ""first wave"" part buildup wave. üò∂ mean we‚Äôre doomed? spring. elections coming PM wanted get voting points, ignored recommended measures sake that.

Also, places listed, islands. Can't exactly saw ourselfs Austria, Poland, Germany Slovakia paddle ocean, can't we. Pendler workers, trucks mixed over-the-border families still need need able cross border. getting downvoted kind right. Good Trump's still fuckin moron went shock trying read would start see virus act differently vaccine rolled out. protection vaccine offers would simulate effects restrictions. also concept people sewing cloth masks. medical authorities early days talked mask wearing, referring hard get medical ppe desperately needed healthcare workers. homemade cloth masks readily available back then, imagine messaging would bit different. Enter #NoNewNormal people...

Imagine digging heels refusing change face changing world. challenge trials common cold coronaviruses, people get reinfected less year. good news flu cases way cause mask use :) Yeah. dumbest thing ever. driving speed limit means I'm ""living fear."" sucks Lucky reason need flu shot every year every year different flu virus. can‚Äôt true people tired it.

Wars worse, clear things supposed do. sense urgency. Sitting nothing bad people's mental health. actually main one going globally Sorry, can‚Äôt read.  wouldn‚Äôt resolve pandemic overnight

Hence, need continuation restrictions. Probably biggest takeaway. Ahh yes blender education method inspiration Yup choices fucked year. politics aside theyre simply old allowed run. know serious health concerns age physically mentally. one age 65 allowed run first term. Depends bubble well-behaved participants are. WFH work? Eight kids two parents average, 2.5 kids average per family, round 10% extended family 40 people bubble everyone behaves everyone WFH. mind that's getting pretty big. 

We six bubble: four adults, two kids. including two cats. WFH. curbside pickup groceries, meds, hardware. IFR ca. 0.4% mean age fatalities ca. 80 years.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* feel like sort mandates put extra burden small businesses already struggling covid. Wearing masks almost common wearing underwear anyways, dont see underwear mandate. Masks hard get hold extremely cheap. I'll go back normal thanks. No, still around today, mutated less-deadly strains. comment even mean talking to, parents? Random neighbors withholding candy? think parents 24/7 supporting encouraging kids home school playgrounds shutdown? 

Kids resilient. Alternatives going strangers houses asking candy upend lives far less furthering impact Covid community parents want tell no.

I Christmas tucked inside funeral week family member tree ficus plant decorated paper circles presents wrapped trash bags. One best ever had.

Don't chastise adults trying make decision best everyone. neighborhood still went I‚Äôll curious see pans answer last tine, happened account got banned Uhh, no, almost everybody got chicken pox right got vaccine. factor main driver spread contact tracing found. Uhh people lives live wtf kinda comment this. casual leisure few, plague treatable antibiotics all, today still cases massive spread, wonder fast we'd figure treat never before. (Aka like Covid bacterium) Name disease burned scourge humanity vaccines antibiotics? Yup, overwhelming majority external, plus indirectly linked border evidence community transmission.

The headline accurate, scaremongering. Covid increasing outside NZ then, guess what, people entering country likely test positive.

Your downvotes seriously harsh. Hahahahaha guys...they locked well! mean anything? speculated opening schools since beginning September together weather conditions may blame. Also people frequently wear masks wrong ex. leaving nose uncovered. Polish healthcare overloaded even pandemic verge collapse. Testing capacity almost saturated positive rate hovering around 12%. sentiment government wasted time gained lockdown start. guys, I'm bored pandemic open everything pretend like noting wrong. obviously best way handle this. /s multiple shut downs multiple countries.  dont work how-about travel around world? prepared stay Australia indefinitely?

Completely unsustainable. thing common weather getting colder + people giving shit anymore, obsessed wanting kids go school? Dude shouldn‚Äôt go... it‚Äôs simple that. lock em up... Grrrr Don‚Äôt tell Karen this. might lose shit. I'm sure comment would get voted . people ornery like disagreeable. wonderful day. He's said today thinks social distancing continue 2022. 

Although, there's difference social distancing meaning ""mask wearing, general caution stop people pressed crowd there's need,"" social distancing meaning ""no one allowed meet another human face-to-face"" think he's talking former. narcolepsy thought exact scenario happening covid.

Look pandemrix vaccine, caused bunch cases narcolepsy. vaccine would legitimately break cycle transmission though, vaccine wouldn‚Äôt resolve pandemic overnight would point pandemic starts taper SURGE!! 

Tsunami coming! Survival fittest finest- wear masks likely survive.  Late summer early autumn 2021 guess see things return normal. Wonder many high-risk patients would actually alive get COVID w/o medical advancement... man walking, brown-face, vagina. cares he‚Äôs doing?

Love,

We're handful cases day almost brought back line states, means soon able travel freely around country again.


Huzzah!!! Actually UK Spain green list people traveled northern ireland travelled Dublin airport even though Spain Irelands green list. least I‚Äôll feel safe travel. don‚Äôt mind wearing mask. note, I‚Äôll first round vaccinate per state‚Äôs plan. Im labour law prosecutor Brazil unfortunately, even though we're acting firmly violations protective measures bigger companies tend refuse following protocols. court, simply threaten mass dismissal judge takes account fears economy. delicate problem. believe bubbles? lot opponents opening schools also oppose bubbles.  Victoria 3: Electric Boogaloo lots units air dryers. fact, quality units dyers. Cleaner hands backside, tp waste. This. right understand people take seriously/ modicum caution.

Other people may infect, I'm concerned death _myself_.

The reason concerned _long term effects_ (both known unknown). 100s doctors say useless. Including WHO. OP here. hard time finding GA updates. AJC live updates page (iirc) can‚Äôt linked here. Would take news source suggestions. That‚Äôs kinda starting determine. honestly knows anymore. go nature, group two. local hospital never sent patients unless children critical state, sent children's hospital region.

Now, covid, sent places. Anything all. announced covid cases start sent somewhere else, they're 100% room capacity 98% bed capacity. Figure out. means beds halls, waiting rooms, available space.

So. theory? Human mink back human already fact. Boo fucking hoo 25 cases?!!! It‚Äôs wise use one factor determinant respond COVID honestly. many factors influence recovery. Yes, are. may never leave body may wind permanent lung, heart brain inflammation lame-duck session shredding documents pardoning criminals.

But super-common one, unlike, say, Spanish Flu, diarrhea killing lot people COVID. Depends are. We've tiered system, northern English areas locked point closure. Scotland gone harder, Wales Northern Ireland firebreaking. England (particularly South), pubs restaurants open slightly shorter hours.

Worth saying we're hit uniformly. London took brunt first time, time spread North, summer coming lockdown, hence hotspot taking hold May/June. They're trying regional approach 'save economy'. would bummer. perfect storm, really:

1. Colder temps, weaker immune system

2. People spending time indoors/huddled together

3. less sunlight, less Vitamin D

4. 2nd/3rd wave (yeah know 1st wave entirely gone) = people care anymore. bad economy close soon prepared 2nd wave handle infected time numbers post estimates outbreak, covid currently faulty reporting system. Estimates already say 2-3 times reported. shitshow over, I'm sure rank much higher. Possibly sociable people. Notice lot politicians etc got infected early on, vast number social contacts have. works way social butterflies. Nothing Tegnell done far makes new think ""good scientist."" would surprised virus gets ‚Äúsilently‚Äù worse worse kills whole human population perhaps even span 100 years. I'm surprised. live island allowed tourists skip 14 day quarantine test negative virus. Majority tourists wearing masks following guidelines, lot locals right behind them. Yet get sent back lockdown, everyone complains understand why. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Generally agree look Portugal, spike excess deaths August notable covid breakout maybe weird cause explaining Iberia? 11,000 second wave excess deaths many actually recorded covid deaths? Spain around 800 deaths/week awhile I‚Äôm guessing least thousand. Still leave decent gap. Interesting China must pay. think six months expectation duration immunity back feb-mar 2020 timeframe, back reading tsunami data professional commentary. substantiate claim factors health policy significant differences pandemic performance, power you. me, cause effect relatively clear cases. Governments pursued psuedo-herd immunity approaches, essentially approach all, U.S., U.K., Sweden, Brazil, etc., massively worse death rates countries took aggressive, science-based actions, Australia, Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand, Slovakia, Taiwan, etc. Worst episode American top 40 ever, especially consider Cove still climbing charts. That's less comforting hot coffee pants. One dumb belief I've heard regards number deaths hospitals falsely attributing deaths covid19 patients would died anyway (cancer patients example). Also there's conspiracy theory hospitals misrepresent unrelated deaths virus get funding. Trumper I've talked cared contracted virus. buy narrative put others symptoms mild everyone scared of. It'll get worse everywhere time Americans partying Halloween year? but‚Ä¶ What?

many never stopped. Friend's mother going church hugging people, people over, etc., masks. College kids parties. College kids babysitting folks knowing exposed covid.

I get hear lot ""fun"" stories relative take every case/death covid 5% state (NJ). days taken 12 hours get it. going someone assist them, want others cope it. broken crying middle process several times.  update list every single day since middle March, still day. see, thanks explanation. üôèüèº fair generalization.

The active cases absolutely stable. Sweden experiencing second wave rest Europe is. Hopefully deaths better time everyone reasonable call stable think. fuck cnbc iirc saying flying risk Nah, shape: happened quite literally every symptom Covid, looked like dying face. hacking coughing/sneezing body pain fucking up. sweating bullets conscious. Tried make *bam* fell face first voted truth there. 50% effective thing talked about, true. Flu vaccines (on good year) hit 65%, Malaria around 30%. They're relying essentially herd immunity another name. work widespread vaccination, infrastructure overnight. Frozen storage, chilled transport, enough equipment. vaccine absolutely coming, I'd amazed things back normal time next year. watched last night. Ronald McDonald could done better job Donald. Politics self-interest worst... Arent Swedish? Blacked kitchen one night pool sweat

As type 1 diabetic, sounds like low blood sugar.

Though first becoming diabetic, believe tend highs lows, doctor - diabetic. isn‚Äôt Reddit twitter morons speak confidence uncertain things.

A good scientist almost never use certain terms. use words like ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù Herd immunity different think is. idea concept, essentially us also going herd immunity. 
But actually, high compliance self responsibility people Sweden (and it‚Äôs polar opposite New Zealand) plus restrictions place way pandemic arguably kept Sweden‚Äôs numbers low. Assuming everyone ship gets infected immediately instead infection spreading voyage still contagious people board ship arrives. wait sec, pResident said people sick pandemic basically over.

you mean tell he's liar?! 
^^^^/s Enjoying friends spread around country mostly hung online start. Managed one big party january started happening. Pretty sure that's people trick guessing. take look swedish numbers - quite lot people 70+ treated hospitals, quite lot icu. 

it really help come online state think facts. - stated could happen wrong.

anyway, also checked count sweden, prove talking without checking note ""old groups"" lockdown (hence whole post) take account checking numbers, seriously deflated due facts story behind arcitle we're commenting about. people getting sick twice tested positive twice considered ""reinfections"" without sequencing formally established yet whether original infection re-emerging person truly reinfected. originally thought re-emergence sequencing confirmed re-infections quickly proving false. think soon require sequencing proof anymore cause reinfection numbers skyrocket start including people got sick twice. pandemic unemployment payment ‚Ç¨350 per week scheduled place next April. Shit thats bad Thats near sweden peak. swedish experience anything go by, deaths happen peak. Wish could watched uncle slowly video link natural immunity (T cell antibody) develops thing spike protein? thus less effective ?

I want understand give longer immunity, vaccine. verified drop box still viable. I‚Äôm south Australia life back normal. one COVID, life isn‚Äôt restricted even sporting stadiums opening back up. sucks watching America still go this! Stay strong! get better Ireland shutdown months already, cases fell summer months took September. Pandemic musical chairs  right, corona exist, scam. vents. Oxegen first thing put patients low O2 sat levels on. Without good number would keep crashing. widespread O2 infrastructure 1918. O2 treatment demonstrated then, wide scale implementation. Sure fuck seem normal LA yet Nothing directly worry want participate. know OP talling about. turn door light, people knock. do, open door lol. I'll agree you. know people downvoting you.

Probably they're selfish enough willing send people hellish situations means better prospect survival.

And I'm long hauler, know long term effects do. guess natural selection. Can't anything stay back watch guess sneeze mask, bad time. manage it, sneeze elbow. Working food plants gave reflex coughing/sneezing elbow, proven useful pandemic. Perhaps herd immunity nonsense finally laid rest, concentrate eliminating virus. it‚Äôs individualist society collectivist society like countries seeing greater success maintaining virus definitely explanations. I've seen lot published research lately various observations various functions virus altering impact immune response. virus unique ability alter immune response way enhances survival, unique changing immune response much completely favorite example moment. outlining underlying mechanisms virus preventing secretion type 1 interferons, would certainly explain virus derails immune response start infection. this, Pfizer J+J ones western governments ordered shitload preemptively. makes sense English speaking website would focused ones they're probably going get increased risks obviously, it‚Äôs sustainable long-term, think. worked well us able kids play together, etc. Say example predicting comes true, come end month China announces one vaccine candidate passed phase 3 trial thus becomes first COVID-19 vaccine time.

Whoever get hands vaccine see economy recover ahead countries can't get access it. suddenly puts impetus countries make deals China try get China's good side earlier queue vaccine. mean time US sure hell try convince countries break rank wait US vaccine shortly become available also.

This would similar scramble masks start year, much intense time around. world political stage become dramatic. [My I'm freshman college live campus excuse ignorance, easier make social connections dorm? people still roommates, least see students? live dorm literally talk anyone, what's even point? Feels like waste money. don‚Äôt think we'll come vaccine, money stake here, big money. we've wondered human existence moving forward... Yeah. It‚Äôs among worst countries world right now. sucks. grandma staying folks I‚Äôm go outside something takes phone calls certain relatives (she always uses speakerphone) hear speak current situation I‚Äôll get pissed. One relative told 2016 stop politics group texts whatnot STILL gotten message. don‚Äôt agree you. Stop. It‚Äôs like talking wall. what‚Äôs that? ‚ÄúYou're going get bloody! sounds exhausting would Chickenpox. According UN Sweden best elderlycare world. index measures quality life. Locking people letting die alone order ""win"" coronalympics opposite providing quality life.

The Swedish Public Health agency responsible health broad sense, corona task force. Im convinced expected bring less suffering total. always baffles me. One would expect liberals, pro-choice believe personal freedoms, would opposed masks way around.

Conservatives like ""We must protect unborn fetuses!!!"" give crap left womb.

I even... :sarcasm: every reinfection twice bad last confined ade every healthy person lungs 89 year old smoker next June. course guaranteed NeVeR made corona vaccine since confirmed 4 reinfections happen 20000 strains return Monke happen around august September Dude, I'm boat. northern ohio. Father still lives there. really know get him. regularly goes camping / 4wheeling trips multiple families. 10+ people. manchester united. spell musk Yeah. Humanity never go back normal. either go instinct we'll social distance rest eternity. successful vaccines towards coronavirus. officially fucked. Humanity done folks. suggest everyone kills themselves. maybe less, maybe Hahahahah best timeline Americans that. friends give actual names phone numbers going bars DC. Why? fuck actually worried about? New Zealand app use check-in places, would never fly here, even though hot minute 10 years ago people become Mayor Jerry's Barber Shop 4Square.

This country blows dick. Reference:

Positive selection within genomes SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses independent impact protein least according study cited data already adjusted age, sex race. unadjusted death rate fell 30% 3% data adjusted. 24% 8% adjusted. Ugh. sucks. it‚Äôs good you‚Äôre staying vigilant.  went 0 cases plan work unless also successfully completely close borders vaccine. 0 emergency services/army/etc. would still running 5 weeks. wish fucking sub would collapse. Nothing teenagers screaming ""the end near"" fixate negative news headlines. NPR noone science world wrote it. they've promising vaccines since last easter believe available. know numbers hospital admissions ICU admissions outcomes improved. They‚Äôre kinda like IT. People notice shit goes wrong pretend nothing everything going right. Multiple pandemics prevented past decade, let alone last 100 years. FYI, linen, silk artificial materials work (but filter made ie vacuum bag used, that's effective comparably n95) reason makes good wound dressing: loose strands.

Brushed cellulose fuck Asia fine fucking suck ass. understand island countries like Japan (and New Zealand though know Asia) fine. explain South Korea third worlds like Vietnam Thailand fine. massive protests Thailand right yet still problems there. fuck suck fucking bad? Half people sub don‚Äôt leave mom‚Äôs basement anyway, won‚Äôt even know pandemic ended. Europe seems much worse USA terms excess deaths. spain uk pretty bad. Compare lockdown sweden same. think got hospitalized might let happen home. don‚Äôt want die alone hospital. Jesus, relate. father lives northern ohio begging come visit, go camping, go 4 wheeling etc. Yet every time talk phone like ""just went camping 3 families"" ""Jeff kids stopped by"" fucks sake local bar week last. 

When confront him, convince maybe..just maybe.. listen cdc. 5 days later like completely reverts. Fucking boomers gonna death us. times (for Walmart least) pick whatever computer decides best. Sometimes computer dumb.

(You choose howver!!) Thank dude...

I appreciate independent thinking. don‚Äôt see much that. 

And you‚Äôre 100% spot on, news well oiled marketing machine Apple Macy‚Äôs please believe things people say planned creating ‚Äúboogie man‚Äù Americans crow allows narrative. truth helpful them. lose. 

Stay positive keep asking questions. people get mad you‚Äôre asking questions, that‚Äôs clue! Cool you‚Äôre also right centre too? go damn self put people risk outsource though. moral solution? testing comprehensive enough long enough, successful, fade background.

If there's chance new pandemic disease emerging future, there's harm building basic structure contain testing. airlines need money, would think best thing enforce mask policies. Think it... downvoted taking quote context. quote says virus affects young people too, affects everyone equally.  No, exactly good/bad/meaningful/meaningless. Chicagoland within 2 hours two major metropolitan areas (Madison, Milwaukee) ridiculously large number beds space, Im sure won‚Äôt be. 20 times 40,000,000 800,000,000. bit 10% worlds population. likely close actual amount people infected. hope influenza well. would defiantly check every days avoid spreading community work. PPE game though, PAPR N95 . goggles 5o top off. googled used blood testing equipment multiple people. would give shit people we‚Äôve never met? don‚Äôt care family, assume don‚Äôt care mine I‚Äôve never heard anything you. 

If cared dying world, literally nothing would get done. excess cash would drained sent starving Africa. start, start sending whatever left food banks Africa.

If don‚Äôt, really don‚Äôt give shit others you‚Äôre virtue signal. Maybe good idea let french atm... Many deaths probably still caused pandemic though. They're Covid-adjacent, least. I‚Äôm lucky husband react way meets severity risk rather cowering panic 8 months straight. It‚Äôs avoided lot arguments. we‚Äôve avoided Covid. Cucumber ***may*** taste better pickled. cares? Ahhhhh, tactical anteater. get COVID near zero, use rapid tests find pop-up clusters. do, would need hammer come massive tracing testing sensitive tests. Tards can't even act like masks anything anymore seeing EVERYWHERE US wearing yet cases continue surge EVERYWHERE üòÇ quit bunch idiots start thinking plainly following everything told. like bunch blind idiots following blind deaf man ü§£ COVID-19 poses greatest threat older people, vaccines often don‚Äôt work well group. Scientists hope drugs rejuvenate immune system help. 

(Thank Nature putting fold) EVERYONE spreads COVID.

AIDs disease fringe nature spreads by. Thanks finding numbers!

 Another thing keep mind hospital / ICU beds normally 60-80% occupied non-COVID medical situations (at least norm prior pandemic). 

So whatever left referred ""spare-capacity"". even though 122k ICU beds, 40k may available given day. 

Granted increase spare capacity canceling elective surgeries, delaying basic non-COVID medical care serious repercussions. ideal never get point lol, dogshit capitalism comparable everywhere. wishful thinking borne fear: ""If that, everything would alright.""

But truth is: ‚ÄúThere guarantee vaccine ever discovered, much less effective safe. ‚Ä¶ Vaccine science notoriously unpredictable. Despite decades research, still vaccine prevent viral infections like HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, herpes simplex, Zika, West Nile norovirus.‚Äù ‚Äî Katherine Seley-Radtke Josh Bloom, Baltimore  Rapid tests identify outbreaks numbers low. They're followed team swoop sensitive tests cluster tracing, frequent testing. Ah yes, sarcastic ‚Äúgenius‚Äù comment. Congrats debunking one small element comment. correct sense things I‚Äôve mentioned risks choose take put others risk all, it‚Äôs much lesser extent. said, stand opinion. Mask up, practice social distancing don‚Äôt jagoff, thinking total lockdown/quarantine situation realistic, sustainable, would even effective weeks delusion. mental health/economic implications long term harmful virus. maybe unpopular opinion, especially sub, but...I live that. Try ratio product. They‚Äôre good. Either 1:1 distillate Harlequin. still can't believe illegal go places yet. far I've seen, never was. family healthy, I'm still scared them. Well probably mild back then. OC43 probably pretty bad first crossed over, gained immunity mutated downwards. I'm agreement Derek Lowe. dark period, going see scientific advancements health like seen before. also believe going get Americans start thinking health differently. Many start realize prevention much better treatment. Especially novel virus means treatment (yet). can‚Äôt read article can‚Äôt imagine happened. Well except fact one can't attend sporting events, concerts, ""non-essential"" large gatherings, yes, open be. Go damn store take risk yourself.

OUTSOURCING risk another human selfish. Period. California would much ""Dudes, wtf?"" Ive seen people calling casedemic second wave Canada. like people learn first time. ""Oh there's 1000 cases today, one hospitalized cares?"" long developing sickness, takes weeks go positive hospital death hope that's case, hospitalization rates continue climb since end September. Oh what!!! instead Covid worry HIV!!?? would sue tf Australia!! Imagine quarantined something like Covid ending catching something life long like HIV. That‚Äôs crazy. dude lightweight Also makes vaccine effective flu vaccine, best case scenario economy probably ever go back way was. 

Plenty people work home good - means less gas bought... means less gas tax accrued... funds roads... pays construction workers less employment.

It'll take massive government intervention, still call ""normal"" - things different matter what. 325mg CBD like $40 overpriced market

[More like 325mg per  I'm Utah County. We're fucked. left house month idiots. refuse wear masks shame anyone thinks trick treating bad idea. diseases eradicated. always possibility. misunderstood.

Business almost dead. not! Agreed. Guys masks miracles. 
From saw world news I'm pretty sure Italians top 5 EU mask wearing. enough. 

We tried get back normal life atleast ""new normal"" virus kinda likes that. 

And economy basically die people stops going dinner drink, well help. ü§´ idea timeframe that?

Remember vids china Italy got beginning year? shit made everyone worried. tired ignore dont think could kill grandparents. People fucking suck. ‚ÄúWho moved goal post?‚Äù

Calling dibs book, right now. happy general! Cool 200 000 people died US alone since March tell numbers exaggerating. No, realise that. send link paper? Uh huh. I‚Äôm tired virus

EDIT: getting from?

But point example contagious virus eliminated (and without vaccine!). 

We things like quarantines, mask-wearing, contact tracing. 

And yes, less efficient spreading. know think wasn't. kind people mean there‚Äôs still 2-3 unhalted vaccines phase 3 release results mean he's wearing blackface year? Sadly, smoking makes lungs susceptible virus/complications. Doesn‚Äôt help either president beats virus one like two freaking days. Thousands kids die every year flu. wrote article every kid dying, news would showing multiple child flu deaths per day. 

People would let kids leave house media this.  Wow. really needed know this. Hi bro, totally agree initial message. think american psyche, need ennemi exist (the communist, terrorists, trump antifa).
Some people would stop friends someone knew different political views..like seriously open mind ? People feed negativity fears, brain crave survival, media social medias naturally designed keep us hooked feeding insticts those.

What crappy life people must hate half population ! probably friends, family colleagues !

Peace, like thinking darker version includes pangolin mouse

Edit. Forgot context thread. gonna buy ZM stocks place. 

One worse first time, second, same. 

Heck, there's even someone asymptomatic times. someone died second time (though went chemotherapy two times). 

My best guess - totally layperson's guess, mind you: something like viral load gets infected might swamp effects determine severity, along health time infection (see chemo death). could also get rid mostly by, know, transmitting frequently. course, republicans took challenge. lol. think worked way back then. probably would handled way handled Covid Princess Diamond February/March way handled Spanish Flu 1918. people special breed stupid.

Raised badly = raised boundaries respect authority. can't even tell child ""no."" bad parenting.

1.	How accurate test?
2.	why hospital employees 100% negative taking test once? I‚Äôm medical student I‚Äôm rotating different specialities seeing patients buy box disposable masks today cause hospitals clinics won‚Äôt hand employees including broke medical students anymore. everyone shelter place youngin‚Äôs party hospital worked offering antibody test free thought I‚Äôd try it.

""Realible"" There‚Äôs never answer direct questions, votes.

It‚Äôs strange pattern. would died? many 10 years? 20? 30+? play devil's advocate, film TV industry ground halt March 13th. picking back lots precautions place everyone happy back work part. So, really hurting anyone watching Netflix. Ordering random things Amazon, however.. doesn‚Äôt sound like best thing people hear bc invites less caution. airline study saying worries. Ohio one highest R0s USA right 1.25.

Do Nah like cancer, heart attack, diabetes, strokes, heart disease. know much deadlier diseases. numbers seems indicate fewer cancer, heart attack, diabetes, strokes, heart disease deaths normal. wonder would account drastic improvement every much deadly category. exactly *needs* **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**.

In many ways doesn‚Äôt go far enough however, often even people wear masks wrongly. fault own. happens. reason task force specialists monitor masks worn correctly. spread communities work.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. obviously includes anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

Their children perhaps slightly less conspicuous symbol masks ‚Äî something identify real risk result raised enemies society science.

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people ‚Äúenemies‚Äù progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. task force mentioned easily adopted work. individuals employed federal government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress.

Obviously people willingly violate new mask law separated society ‚Äî good society, well good. dealt humanely fairly. like Nazis. individuals simply separated families society moved safe place time being. perfectly humane fair. safe places seek educate evil ways harm world. re-educated returned society. course repeat offenders dealt little harshly. 

But benefit. Eventually individuals proven menace society danger security state, permanently removed. done humanely, key done good collective whole. system really space individualism. selfish attitude exactly got us trouble first place.

So selfish activity controlled aspects society, especially economic realm. Individuals allowed hoard cash. progressive tax policy course help redistributed, aid less fortunate. cash hoarding outlawed, banks reason exist. probably done away first. People run banks identified enemies state placed camps see error ways returned society. course allowed enter advantageous position, somewhere near base, reduced manual tasks help greater good. Needless say also special insignia masks identifies part dangerous class individuals.

Business owners stripes receive treatment managers banks. course understanding welcome opportunity make amends society. However will, protection, removed society.

There measures taken vis-a-vis bourgeoisie brought much pain unto country. tackled later.

**The important thing 100% fucking law leave house without wearing mask.**

Frankly require wearing even home even you‚Äôre alone. simply strictly outlawed public. Anybody caught flaunting important rule dealt harshly. Penalties enough. Imprisonment, indefinite period (at least year, five even ten years) first time offenders. exceptions, appeals. Second-time offenders sent top secret camps permanently. camps degenerates repeat violators laws. security reasons limits small group security professionals special clearance. Red Cross international organizations allowed anywhere near premises. make sure harmful individuals kept sight mind. fair, correct, proper measures taken people willfully go public without masks. Thankfully deny happens all... guy Minnasotans Based anecdote grandmother shit attitude makes sense. raised badly mean kids be.

Only issue records lil less precise nowadays, epidemiologists make assumptions cause might been, using less precise records, cannot 100% certain origin.

Epidemiology history books actually pretty interesting! ""burn through"". assumption ""most"" ""all"" people California got COVID absolutely mindblowingly retarded. lol. literally states best estimate. 

Globally 1.5 3.5. USA R0 guy bonkers employers Oregon too, required to. Pretty sure that‚Äòs car crashes! 2020 deadliest time drive car **ever**! comparisons interesting. One pandemic lasts 1 year another last 175. really comparable? Average age time periods also vastly different. many people lived late 70s early 80s 1900s. get flu shots every year higher rate mutagenicity influenza virus, lose immunity it. Every year predicting strain influenza see based algorithms educated guesses; sometimes right, sometimes wrong. 

Covid-19 much lower rate mutagenicity. That's saying can't mutate, much less likely chance mutating. vaccine effective (or several, targeting different aspects virus like spike protein coating itself). multi-targeted approach towards vaccination eliminate completely mutate target spots. 

We eliminated viruses past, eliminate one too. nowhere near bad Cuomo's New York State Murphy's New Jersey.

Yet, USA think Cuomo done good job looks dapper yapping front lectern.

You could also look **New Jersey**:

Holy shit, type villain quote would dismissed evil corny. **trying** get people killed? Yay live.  Mask use common, though mandated. Nearly local retail instituted mask policies good compliance posted signage. 

There significant presence anti-maskers state, rural communities shit stop it. mega bars Fargo hosting cover bands. popular recreation activity, eating drinking completely aware per-capita graph made us infamous, honestly, much concern fear locally. Nearly (with exception infirm elderly long-term care) minor symptoms, often first assumed allergies cold. 

There people 40 sick COVID over. course young people going weather virus better, death's even begun peak. know needs say this, ignorant motherfuckers state hold positions power. City Commissioner Fargo comes mind recent viral video. People unconcerned lied week, total tests equal 95+% state population.

Look COVID dashboard, unique individuals tested 275,000, roughly 1/3 state. Fun fact half people tested positive, previously tested negative. means pervasive within community. 

Shit really bad people uninformed. Also murder rate Bismarck fuck COVID. different situation though.
I'm Melbourne too, Australia rest country suppressed virus low levels government income support support business focus Victoria, whereas parts Europe like Italy, Spain, United Kingdom budgets stretched first wave options lockdowns economic support much limited.
It's hard understand masks universally adopted Europe lockdowns come high economic cost always option. attitude this, Florida voters want this, keep voting people back office. want this, Florida voters vote office. 

There one blame Florida voters. Stuff like would fly far California, but, hey, Florida voters want kind government, power them. That's random-ass cutoff based hard science.

You get infected get enough virus particles mucus membranes. Virus particles decrease distance sick person, intake essentially going constant time interaction.

So 6 feet away less (half? quarter?) particles versus 3 feet. 7.5 minutes interaction half particles versus 15 minutes. neither guarantees get enough particles.  import tons PPE China. called main importers asked knew NYT investigation. even emailed minister charge ethical business practices asked response news reports. brushed added: ""I know cases violations"". frustrated ties china always seem connected slavery, surprised, different age.

Ik right? should‚Äôve went continuation üò∏ makes feel better I‚Äôll let lick gouch you‚Äôre actually useful life? Today, 40,000 tested. That‚Äôs significantly daily average past two weeks (around 25k, give take). government criticised past testing enough. Apparently, bad coordination cause: certain test centres still free capacities, others turned people down. [Will vaccine end No) first recorded case Covid reinfection different said Covid-19 mutates *pretty* rapidly.

Seems like getting stuff wrong, yet one getting upvoted. Classic Reddit. Ah right completely slipped mind Yeah but... WTF placebo  train dogs survived infection begin really placebo - trial gave control group meningitis vaccine.  glad live Europe Maine ten days ago. 

While father called check trip lamented 40 new cases single school back home. informed entire state Maine day.....they 23.  Basically pockets country (like Maine SF) get month Southern hick towns get week! that's normal discussion, lot companies trials right people paying attention each. study participants still alive still idea side study on. participant treated differently others, one knew side today.

Did read details plan first introduced, think would positive effect (on virus levels misinformation levels) stuck plan? 

And secondly, know quite misinformation category, but: going see drastically N95s produced anytime soon? going reusing PPE winter? soul tired looking one, sad, beat little N95 mask. Creating panic kinda point far news outlets go. Yep total disaster - gonna contact trace someone holiday foreign country?? click$  worst case scenario involves lowest risk every single person except getting paid it.
You would rather people get sick die paid employees lower risk? But, but, Russia bad, right guys? Jokes aside, could happen anyone, I'm rooting vaccine matter makes it. jist like wgen someone bashes Russsians Russians. Russian people invented many useful things medicine. official statistics.

Yeah, I've noticed people care causes death covid. receive vaccine. people PM'ing stop making area USA, filed rule claiming tell many children infected school.  local news hear ""xxxx xxxx schools closed week cleaning"".  That's code for, outbreak closed pending cleaning school. 40k study 40k got actual vaccine placebo? wondering last night... numbers would half due placebo actual vaccine.

Step One: order Amazon Walmart

Step Two: wait

Step Three: whatever ordered magically appears, nobody go anywhere.

Did get every say lmao? 

When ‚Äúevery‚Äù say *what*? can‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre asking give non-sequiters like that. Reddit quote function; perhaps figure sake convenience? admitted fine sending someone else believe risky situation.

Right, stand that, *only* wearing masks/gloves/other PPE, following safety guidelines, etc. Yeah lockdown yourself

Are even paying attention? fucking *have* locked down. clearly plain English said leaving house go work, that‚Äôs cannot work home. understand reading comprehension might strong suit, I‚Äôm trying give benefit doubt. Keep up, please. need clarification, don‚Äôt hesitate look new job.

Ok, great. know haven‚Äôt been? meantime, guess what? still work job have. complain make excuses since fine non essential businesses like Disneyland forced shut down.

Ah, ok. Cool. dozen people job - 3-4 scheduled one time - exact thing hundreds thousands work Disney. Taking clothes home end day washing totally equivalent Disney park employees wearing re-wearing giant mouse head.

What fucking color sky world, dude?  Lies, damn lies, statistics, grenade toss Florida reported numbers Thanks link. Yes. interesting. poznan everyone see mask. *antibody* *antigen* testing. tests looking antibodies body, using antibodies detect proteins virus body.  Found parent shitty parenting skills child reflects said parenting. 

Do better job discipline kid.  again, countries shown locking masking *can* work long people keep up, whether voluntarily threat punishment. able open lot again. throw rock hit Netherlands. actions may endanger others. Nothing changed manner read, right? still says things quoted above. think could do? Asking fellow neighbor (Poland). also populist brought Corona back. people going en masse Baltic sea, participated crowded delayed weddings, churches open fun kissing jesus' cross. semi lockdown since March people would revolt now. death numbers low first wave people take seriously. seeing collapse hospitals understand. Sorry. didn‚Äôt realize that.

Certainly wouldn‚Äôt matter me, read that‚Äôs reason DeSantis won. Florida red necks wouldn‚Äôt vote guy. true. I'm surprised HISD shutting schools even presumed cases. SBISD kept schools open, getting high 16 active cases one campus. Crazy differs much districts - think would middle ground. Congrats. happy it‚Äôs working you. It‚Äôs working people. Nah, restrictions disappear shortly vaccination campaign. Ownership entertainment venues may change hands, entire theatrical distribution model change movies, people continue congregating large numbers thousands years.  Fucking idiots. dumb reason die guess are. Oh do, people really like Nazis.

Whenever see posts, remind people Nazi. course is, never lockdown anywhere country point pandemic. were* best* advisories teeth, never enforced caused people keep breaking them. still nonessential businesses open, people gathering outside without masks, house parties, people wearing masks/not properly, etc. legitimate lockdown literally none would've happened. need legit nationwide lockdown point selfish idiots, we've proven collective capable needed get done.

I'm ready downvotes, nobody face reality anytime bring up. know does, fair, thread virus yet vaccine. That's people taking about.

 It'll fine. internet comment. I'm need talk, to. wish loved ones well. herd immunity? USA 80M cases right? WTF going on? Fauci intelligent man lots insights public health epidemiology. 

But 2022 measures *all* mean life cannot lived almost exactly before, won‚Äôt followed. 

That said, say Public health measures might place less stringent. Social distancing masks around likely 2022... chose wear mask socially distance. I‚Äôll gathering travelling. unruly kid != inability learn distance.

We've homework home remote learning without issue. Sounds like parenting problem me. Yep. N.B. however source article incorrect subreddit rules allow ""fixing"" here. Denmark Sweden practically amount cases per capita. Denmark‚Äôs numbers bit odd though. performed 60000 less tests last week normally do. It‚Äôs blamed fall vacation. lower case count last week would probably that. people back daily numbers again. Yeah no. Happens everywhere, maybe bit common there. country Europe also large weddings, mainly Muslims really, exposed thanks. I'll stay away people. image virus one best I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôm sure yellow dot surface represents. say part numbers real. Every medical facility contact refusing test people unless every single symptom list. Even local hospital hitting number new daily positive cases per day August testing 20% many people. Jesus 120 *one state?* fucked. I‚Äôm starting afraid way common think is, swept rug somewhere. mate, said ‚Äúas well‚Äù, they‚Äôre aware happening sweden. they‚Äôre pointing isn‚Äôt situation unique sweden. mobility data see recommendations effect week later neighboring countries, lower though - go cafe pandemic mean people go there.

You literally see big difference countries mid-March end-April coincides flattening curve quickly people still acting like lockdowns cross-check Norway's Sweden's restrictions/recommendations see differ much,

Schools closed, organized sport activities discontinued, public utilities like gyms/sports events/cultural activities closed, restaurants/bars closed too. Residents outside Sweden/Finland subjected mandatory quarantine chose return. also banned public gatherings lockdown.

Can stop acting like Norway's measures much different?  title certainly sounds like r/aboringdystopia material, we're headed, cba wear mask protect around us.

We wanna continue life was, even minimum amount care fact actions may endanger others. might able get people wear masks 2022. social distancing measures, presuming timeline vaccine becoming widely available spring 2021, good luck getting people willing follow rules starting summer 2021. Considering bunch 80 years old morbidly obese around 100 years ago, would barely noticed. think get lot common colder-weather cities winters, especially places Asian communities immigrants/residents already history wearing them.

Even COVID-19 outbreak Toronto would see people wearing masks every day winter, occasionally months. ‚Äúfighting stance‚Äù Orange guy always super cringe. rights made expendable privileges. go masters mercifully slows to. meet people manner. work pay taxes masters.

By practical means serfdom. done distance learning child total disaster. child goes private school. risk behind kids going get worse attitude. fine, many not. This. know brought way often. can't compare case counts early spring now. sophomore hit. supposed gain valuable experience research South America next two summers. think that's happening makes furious. need vaccinate entire global population.

Once country vaccinated transmission goes down, start controlling virus borders, rather internally. Canada awesome aren‚Äôt millions illegal aliens flocking Canada every year ‚ÄúThe flu‚Äù long term debilitating effects it‚Äôs widely publicised Honest question asymptomatic person hard long term effects wouldn‚Äôt mean asymptomatic definition? hundred? halloween really big US? never tell what's real what's movies.

Here UK probably get 5-10 kids evening nurse nurse friends, frustrating see nurses still going gatherings friends restaurants. Really, causes even fatigue staying indoors. literal abstract. read COVID-19 pandemic progressed across world, governments, international agencies, policymakers, public health officials began recommending widespread use nonmedical cloth masks reduce transmission SARS-CoV-2. authors article suggest convincing evidence support recommendation. Well, you‚Äôre business essential workers didn‚Äôt shut obviously...and we‚Äôre aware unlivable wages companies offer, also know already wage gap increasing last 35-40 years. many essential businesses absolutely scraped cash year. isn‚Äôt narrative businesses making specific kind money, it‚Äôs narrative providing fair conditions, livable wages, value, etc. you‚Äôre business kind support really expect community large? know how? odds work leading covid-19 cure odds God descends Heavens bestows cure upon us. wow genius /s talking about? Failed? regions hit hard March April much better others right now. Lombardy ITA, New York state, Sweden,... later Manaos ... clear achieved sort others achieve winter. Agree, literally read ECDC follow TWiV. feels different threads US cases. Wonder cant careful places, packed bar, social distancing. shear number inhabitants? bad word choice part, I‚Äôll back bit explain mean.

Some people sub talk post-vaccine outbreaks restrictions vaccine won‚Äôt disrupt chain transmission hardly all. think local restrictions probably still needed short term rollout vaccine, vaccine disrupt virus‚Äôs ability transmit enough full lockdowns won‚Äôt necessary. Get Russian one! sure, it‚Äôll take time. 

I suspect vaccinations roll elderly, infirm, front-line/healthcare workers, etc. still go long way reducing amount people hospitalized and/or die covid.

But yes, it‚Äôs definitely ‚Äúon/off switch‚Äù They're wrong. go trough mild case covid-19 ABs all!

Anti bodies whole story. According research represent 15% people ""immune"". Another problem timing. get result testing person went trough covid19 disease testing person half year later. AB mostly gone then. factors cross immunity corona viruses, T-cell immunity, B-cells play giant role. That's probably 80% ""asymptomatic"" call them. Totally agree. one would received type care bounced back quickly, even ones recover week looking outrageous hospital bills. care paid taxes. Even working vaccine developed successfully, manufacture distribution would take many months Ireland would still dealing Covid-19, said. added: ‚ÄúI think New Year may need consider restrictions again, get vaccine.‚Äù 

Once again, fear porn.

Talking restrictions **until vaccine widely available**. Stop *silly* (that nicer mods?), read actual articles post. Nitpick: April numbers likely far higher lack tests available time. ""house fire"" time likely like ~65K saw summer.

However, back April number deaths also lot higher. peaked around 2200/day compared 1100/day summer roughly 750/day right now. *just* getting used bigger numbers, numbers deaths dropped. Alas, climbing back well 1000/day pretty soon. One thing guarantee certain, person makes accusation, accusation always true. There's never need hear side story. Honestly, hard time understanding Americans making sound like done nothing outliers lockdowns mask mandates. Imagine comment whole country. That's Sweden you. even remember last time saw someone mask. Unless child tested positive someone household immunocompromised, making kid wear mask home taking way far. Nobody cares. Stop weird grow up. Define stopped, people still dying droves them? someone saluted came feeling good patriotic.

Veteran here. true. compensation letting someone else serve. hated hearing people. felt sorry this. 

My time memories occassional story now. True, imported cases China false positives. Asian countries seem multiple tests check those. sure. 

Well im sure absolutely cramped rooms filled it. Glad know outdoor gatherings cool mask compliance! already know memory B cells rather produce antibodies (original sin) coronviruses, maybe can't really rely them. Fuuuuuuuuck part problem Lockdowns don‚Äôt make anyone serf.  Yep :) think indicated, first went 1,000 new cases per day, planned wait couple weeks make sure fluke, scaling things back. 

I also think lot population attitude we're pretty close vaccine ride surges happen then. Hey buddy. Yes know. Sweden Tell kids aren‚Äôt learning teachers don‚Äôt want go school. Isn‚Äôt October... One way another, Trump survive Virus he's 'fighter'. survived treatment cost around half fucking million. hiding long term chronic residues Corona (heart damages/lung damages/cardiovascular damages/'brain fog'\[Trumps immune he's stupid 24/7\]). back 'walking shape' mean got Covid 'healthy'. 


This type reasoning like people get stomachs sized get fat removed think 'I'm healthy/I'm thin now'. Nah, removed fat cells, entire body still geared towards fat. call us 'scared', really mean ""please stop reminding virus still here, making really hard ignore reality"" thing Trump takes credit closing border letting sheeple get herd mentality/immunity. Remdesivir though. 6 feet staying forever night well death sentence things Yeah. It‚Äôs happening Denmark Norway well. Denmark highest case count (by date) ever Monday, 662 cases.  Thats odd way wayingbwqy less July. True! percentage IFR. CFR. 

And admitting many / people April? Don‚Äôt know... not. believe usual Argentine government mismanagement. friend doctor working ER one backwater countries balkans. waiting queue time last week, midst covid rises. point guy (young, 30 top) takes mask coughs.

people scum, especially treat scum scum punish / educate appropriately. 

so, throughout world, finding rather useless, unless comes someone gov actually worried people... 1 guy cold snack wet market many.

I understand still concerning. Also cure Trump used Stem Cells. Even worse, early surges largely coastal level geographical landlock. Virus FL peninsular containment. Virus midwest (and is) bursting every direction. think people putting much pressure vaccine. Even everything goes well approvals etc, virus still gonna circulating level quite everyone going get vaccinated sorts reasons, i.e. laziness, anti-vaxxers, etc. delusional conservatives secretly know this, they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs going disappear give Biden credit helping reduce it. Glad see FHM impose ""soft"" lockdowns fight spread Uppsala. people need listen. parties. Hope get masks soon catch rest world, already 8 months late. feel like one math questions teachers would make Shut businesses wife nurtured 20+ years looked unlikely could run safe fashion. long-haul Covid patients needing medical care time new infections increasing.

Most long haul stories heard required hospitalization though?

Actually dont think have? per capita value. minimizes old pandemics maximizes one.

Where get currently estimated average from? took 1.1m death toll world wide divided potential 800m people hypothesis released month ago. 

I'm saying virus hoax, masks work. Im taking information provided justifying lack fear numbers. major thing ""Christians"" ignore Matt 5:17-20 *For verily say unto you, Till heaven earth pass, one jot one tittle shall wise pass law, till fulfilled. 19 Whosoever therefore shall break¬†...*

Christians really called ""Paulines"". Paul / Saul comes along says, ""Hey folks, take Old Testament cafeteria style. Bacon breakfast? problem."" Amazing literalists suddenly become ""we consider context"" blah blah anything, Leviticus example, inconvenient. understand psychological effects society. However lockdown supposed permanent. Italy, Germany, Spain, EU countries instituted complete lockdown 2 months opened back up. came psychologically fine. Keep mind, sooner control virus, sooner end lockdowns (and maybe even mask mandates). 

If look graphs, rate infection going US lockdown back April May...then people started crying murder, opened prematurely, are.

We die eventually...but virus related deaths preventable. 

So again...how lockdowns ineffective?  conflicting Infos (think read dogs positive test sure) one research shown dogs probably problem. 

During investigation mink farms, cats dogs infected farm locations tested infections coronavirus.

Only first six farms showed infections cats based virus detection detection antibodies COVID-19, means cats infected.

That said, still gets cold December-February, I'm sure we'll see big winter spike cases too. call non-existent. People reinfected 6 weeks 3 months initial infection separate strains virus.

Those want careful be, there‚Äôs limit much I‚Äôm able give disease threatening pension plan crowd. Placebo's helluva drug didn‚Äôt say going store never necessary. I‚Äôm ordering Shipt, it‚Äôs robot picking me. *Someone* go store; it‚Äôs going me. 

I still think lockdown. Cases rise area. know happens lockdown? People still allowed go places; abide guidelines set place, since seems YUGE issue many people, limiting amount people one area given time probably good idea. 

Group B could gas station employees, restaurant employees, police/EMT/fire, etc. personnel *have* go work people like Group get precious Big Macs milkshakes shit. And, seems like thousandth time: *my* mask protects *you*. *Your* mask meant protect me. I‚Äôm working gas station, Jethro family come maskless acting like fools, little Boogerhands touches Payday bars can‚Äôt see I‚Äôm cleaning mess Cletus made Lurleen obviously sucks parent, *still* get sick, even I‚Äôm wearing mask social distancing.

Why hard comprehend? swear you‚Äôre contrarian purpose. Ageism? Horsecrap. Boomers ones always talking shit younger generations. tables turn sudden it‚Äôs ‚Äúageism‚Äù. F noise. Thats true. I‚Äôm nervous nelly lot riding it. even shocked learn Poland Central Europe. vaccine 100% effective, sure news. read somewhere half intubated covid patients ICU dialysis machines covid fucked kidneys. pretty much attacks main organs.

Seems bit overly  Bloomberg said 'a person familiar matter'. They're risk reputation random guy insight.  Current Covid death rate us ~2%, expect decrease time. drop morality increase diagnosis rate.

Please learn difference Case Fatality Rate, Infection Fatality Rate. cant explain 1000th sure argument here. elderly don‚Äôt worry virus killed 200k people? trump must health despite getting O2, remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies because?

I problem people say someone ""lucky"" survived Covid. opposite. get Covid, die it, one unlucky ones.

The idea Trump ""only managed survive"" super-expensive rare treatment silly.  like everywhere else, people cities take seriously people country don't. Texas-specific problem aside state government failing enact stricter regulations. Yeah, I'm Oregon summer over, people socializing outside moving inside.

Fine, let's hose liquid oxygen! U.S. states autonomous could regulate borders, us would chilling right now. saying nice know supporting small businesses supporting genocide go hand hand! Man, politics really getting simpler. Compelling argument. Right. Even available general public, it'll uphill battle getting everyone unless requirements drawn up, like return offices/colleges/schools unless vaccinated &amp; proof it. different doctors office, think actually trying inject dye test. several years ago remember fallout it. sent Quest lab full workup, HIV, hepatitis, etc, etc. Thank time today, Dr. Yasmin. question schools - public school teacher parent middle school student. truly ""safe"" way students return in-person instruction? community health experts saying ""significant"" risk return numbers low enough (right 200 cases per 100K). Ahh, welcome world. study spread misinformation disinformation living family group chat still often ripe covid conspiracy theories. may want push back immediately (I know do), feel like attack result making person shared false info feel bad shut conversation. better ask came across info (then talk reliable sources), ask believe it, start counter accurate information. way opportunity dialogue future, come across false information, they're likely engage conversation it. study recently looked people exposed anti-science messages Twitter. looked message discuss anyone likely believe anti-science content. Thoe told family member friend, ""Hey, saw thing Twitter..."" likely protected believing falsehood family member friend able correct them. Even countries fairly successful beating back second waves. It‚Äôs really individual responsibilities fault kind cop out. countries legal system.

I'm talking entirely different form economic devastation one currently experiencing: one every Fortune 500 company collapses everyone working becomes unemployed.

Like not, virtually every COVID-19 death created legally valid wrongful death lawsuit somebody: employers, nursing homes, schools. hundreds thousands cases. would take decades legal system litigate all, would bankrupt virtually every American corporation. But, course, never allowed come pass.

The Democrats might come workers' compensation-style system death gets standardized payout corporations handle. means whoever published article unaware, involved would know exactly received... Good job far, keep dying! Sarcasm refuge ignorant. Anti-vaxxers looking bottles homeopathic remedies: ""But taking placebos years, cured coronovirus..."" Considering opening United States entering Phase 3 quite places rising infection/death numbers, hope right. additional taxing healthcare system, especially another respiratory illness, would ideal. headlines purpose. want create fear reader otherwise wouldnt use title. know well they're doing. comments there's link guy divided nation groups showed timeline area peaked different times far....i'd say point everyone gotten one wave. clear happen second everywhere rising looking promising thought they'd suspended week? states Well, clinical standpoint it‚Äôs actually good news. know sounds horrible. don‚Äôt like either. haven‚Äôt seen discredit vaccine thing though it‚Äôs little topic. Maybe try jumping situations divisive nonsense. remember well, believe never went 15% ICU occupancy due corona spring. think good safety net case need one, government take actions necessary avoid ending situation. find encouraging incidence rates set lot lower countries, Merkel hard enough last Wednesday. Bayern Niedersachsen, already rules place. believe flat 7-day rolling average, trajectory upwards states. next Wednesday, getting new rules, 40-50% cases numbers per day (today hit 10.400) Back smoke west coast, husband thinking fitting basket muzzle N95 material. remedial, cuff thought definitely think something could done mask dogs. question would could still detect virus mask on. Lol nobodys life meaningful what's point still possible get flu getting flu shot, yes, people die. example, mom gets flu shot every year, caught flu winter coded. (Luckily got back.) Sounds like problem economy works, idea lockdown. Corporations consolidating control economy decades, crisis accelerated process. economy collapses moment output slows healthy.  I'm Dallas actually experience too. can't remember last time saw someone grocery store wearing mask. I'm sure person said grocery stores ""given up"" lives.

I'm guessing new spike people getting complacent gathering friends home and/or going restaurants. Bars technically still closed I've seen places get liquor licenses revoked following rules. 2000 deaths outside senior's facilities, 7 months, among 37 million people. I‚Äôm saying wrong. statistically may significant. population low enough even deaths could dramatically change rates. reason highest lowest brain cancer death rates North South Dakota Trying include regions experience winter? saying got placebo Apparently europeans cant read it, here's AP news link mean could make people comply pay tax help fund costs selfish behavior. much different cigarette taxes helping cover insane costs dealing smoking related illness. 


No reason make everyone pay. really like stacked graph design Today record global acceleration 7 day rolling average new cases. 67316 higher previous Tuesday. 7-day average jumps 9616. Except can‚Äôt control behavior others, like all. Plus live someone who‚Äôs high risk, might able take enough precautions protect them. you‚Äôre high risk job requires physical presence you‚Äôre shit luck? 

It‚Äôs simple proposed individual actions. anything, pandemic laid bare fact thing PUBLIC health, islands unto ourselves. Without national mandates simpler precautions like masks distancing, harmful economic actions enacted numbers inevitably spike.

Your economic question also assumes deaths $0 economic consequence, demonstrably untrue. Texas Florida didn‚Äôt shit cases dropped. Why? sue

[Not Republicans get way pass Yikes. Really? :( previously 5-monther zero human interaction front....I‚Äôm bored can‚Äôt take alone anymore. Especially seemingly everyone know social degree.

To fair, social circles late 20s / early 30s crowd, top everything, almost everyone personally know gotten completely utterly fine. ebb flow scared basis myself, recognize isn‚Äôt us want parents (60+) fucking safe happy also.

The best likely ensure mask usage around compromised people, bc live city everything still locked social gatherings/beach activities still weekly activity 5-20 person group range. teach Texas, isn‚Äôt true teach - Austin. husband tested positive required quarantine 14 days Austin Public Health. work closely Austin ISD. Students classroom required wear masks student comply sent home. fake news debunked 

Stop spreading misinformation Yeah, bullshit. like ""TwO weEkS FlAtTen TeH cuRve!!1111!!!"" Without normalizing world population, mostly irrelevant ""analysis."" Also 241 deaths :(

Edit - also see deaths [upward trajectory (see deaths graph). Several weeks cases started skyrocketing, consistent multi week lag period. Large gatherings (as 1,000+ people) happening whole time? News me, unless possibly talking racial injustice protests. California, large gatherings thing right now, Padres Dodgers would played empty stadiums playoff games Petco Park Dodger Stadium, respectively. Even states like Texas Florida, pretty loose restrictions months, people going concerts sporting events ""entire time"". think needs break posting sub. Im thinking unsubbing see stats dont need barrage fearmongering know people dying. understand many people care percentages. amount lives lost judge pandemic.  I'm virtual support group people covid lot people got covid early talking second go round üò• sad part you‚Äôre right. Killing world economy way worse everyone cov ever be. 

As Swede hated seemed nonchalant approach point realized much worse get on. world economy sensitive many also heavy mortgages credits, losing job seriously bad even dangerous. OK lockdown skeptic. LOL 
Obviously haven‚Äôt lost anyone pandemic. I'm specifically talking confusion format. format agreed beforehand either AZ take long convert FDA able accept original format? still seems unnecessary delays. Sharply increasing relative.... see world fire, losing traditions security comes routine, drown work, screens, substances, food, sufficiently numb reality: rest modern world light years ahead US education, social policy welfare, happiness, yes, COVID response.

Well said, mate locking again. Arrrrrr! Yes, whenever proximity others warrants it. Generally keep hike mask passing. demographics back then?

If skewed younger, Africa today, may barely footnote.

Of course, idea good reporting many nations, stats have, continental numbers ~0.024%

India approaching US' reported cases, around half deaths far. skew younger too. What? city? watch news almost daily heard that. Half assed ""lockdown"".
Fucking chaos. family 3 die here. Patient privacy il short,but describe scenario give insight see. Daughter goes cardiac arrest covid. Mom tries revive, unsuccessful. Mom catches covid. Dad catches mom. Dad mom icu. Dad dies first. Mom dies last. 
Staff brought dad moms bedside hour passed could say goodbye. hurts health travel Europe pandemic? think coworker symptoms come work anyway. meant type ‚Äúthere many development‚Äù believe. 

No guarantee ever vaccine. NZ island, entering without notifying authorities next impossible. 

Europe Americas connected landmass, possible stop every single human determined enough. It‚Äôs 75 states north east past 3 weeks lol. R0 10. He's referring quirk exponential growth *growth rate* given time proportional number people already it, leading extremely rapid peaks. There's old brainteaser goes something like this:

""A tiny speck invasive algae introduced new pond. amount surface covers doubles every day. 30 days, algae completely covered pond. day algae cover half pond?""

The answer day 29. seems counterintuitive many people, half pond whole lot, yet took one day go half pond whole pond, despite taking 29 days get half pond. that's means double every day.

In virus terms, doubling every day equivalent R0 2 mean infection time 1 day. COVID-19's actual numbers R0 2-4 mean infection time 3-5 days. means 80% Americans eventually get COVID, anywhere 50-75% infections happen final 3-5 days epidemic over.

Countermeasures may change bit - someone limiting contact others, they're going get infected. Right now, R-e (effective R, including social distancing etc.) ranges 0.8-0.9 Bay Area Northeast \~1.2 areas hard-hit like Dakotas Europe. restrictions completely lifted, there's reason believe R-e go back original R0 numbers. Yep. thinking night. going endemic. Hopefully vaccine help great deal, going eradicated. Nowhere else country community spread even tenth bad it. people nobody wanted visiting.

Now numbers look like rest Australia. whole point - make worst hit place less bad, **everyone** could relax No? put words people's mouths like that? Give head shake... fucking pandemic... Disney fucking priority lol. Science bong, yes please. Jesus. Blame government. didnt even knew flu could kill prior pandemic.  Cool. Thanks assessment, random internet stranger. I‚Äôve followed state‚Äôs protocols since day one continue so. spoke favor masks social distancing shared belief eradicating virus strict lockdowns CLEARLY already big way absolutely delusional. Maybe January, blew it. Unless get 100% people lock indoors several weeks exceptions, plan flawed. 

The fact ‚Äúsays something me‚Äù leads believe one anti-social woker-than-thous mentioned above. 

Enjoy passive-aggression sense superiority feel calling people‚Äôs opinions ‚Äúcringe‚Äù Reddit, also realize know us situation. Judging people based opinions matter also says quite bit you. 

Good luck life. There's nothing assume. large chunk population going vote herd immunity posting news articles permitted sources, original headlines per rules. 

If want see different content, change want: find articles post. unsubbing option. People still dying large numbers, sucks, see might want read it. Hospitalizations 24% month month 8% week week. Hopefully curve going slower rate reach third peak soon. literally said article patient rare spinal disease may may cause vaccine drug. That's kind big deal they're treating small number patients Phase 3 testing. Judging state shithole areas. Good metric. Fuck beautiful areas. mention fit entirety small northeast states inside Texas. Covid real danger well. Quite funeral workers NYC lost lives peak.  need hospital grade PPE, get. edit: typo Well good they're sticking correct format matter minor may appear. shows they're following proper procedure nice. percent matter? human death worth something own? NZ effectively delay inevitable. Even vaccine becomes available still cases. Nothing forced. want careful. Nothing wrong that. 

If you‚Äôve already gotten it, likely can‚Äôt get time soon. (Soon tricky word there.) don‚Äôt know long immunity lasts, I‚Äôd bracket probably 10 months, probably less 10 years. 

The lower bracket due confirmed reinfections far upper bracket know coronaviruses reinfect people half dozen times decades. Dutch paper came April, think. seems likely immunity last least year so. Hopefully longer, I‚Äôm immunologist. grandma passed today grandpa weeks ago. Take seriously filthy animals convenient, matter legality. Furthermore taken different area Covid. leap flu shot donating blood pay it? would get covid shot flu shot. several hundred choose from. implying mask work ? People infected twice dying it, looks like antibodies last even months, already multiple strains provide immunity  Heroin fucked up, weed nice. course government says! They're bunch ""sheeple,"" ya know! automatically immediately whatever Trump tells prove free thinkers are! don‚Äôt care Canada has.

They gave chance learn something. thought good thing exist, provided example does. Rejoice!

Why prefer believe things bad? would forfeit chance better country?

Doesn't bother Americans die needlessly?

If true different, true way superior, best minimize difference, copy success? dentist ""Thank healthcare heros!"" poster outside office. cleaning work emergency department. LOL disease ever eradicated Smallpox. heroin affect lungs? don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs realistic anymore keep locking down, point accept hard.

Everyone world lock time work. Otherwise eternally extend downwars spiral world currently. shame. hear Obama impression pretty good. subreddit extra fearmongering sometimes? think important clarify ""life back normal less 2 years"" ~50,000,000 people died rest world developed immunity. Things returned normal level herd immunity reached virus (in form) stop circulating.

A good vaccine going facilitate life getting back normal. Herd immunity without vaccine another route, seems like bad idea. point Americans don‚Äôt care actually relish death saying ‚Äúflatten curve much possible‚Äù isn‚Äôt even flattening curve anymore? Aren‚Äôt talking something totally different IE defeating entirely? Define lockdown. time anyone kept leaving house. [about 200 varieties common NIH, anyways. Flu common cold. 

There paper suggesting possibility vaccine coronaviruses. vaccine referring to? future! Oh fuck, gives heart palpitations thinking speculative. sure feel 2.5 million years older.  dude, H1N1 caused Swine could failed immune responses. tight kind succeeded, body went overdrive, decided kill absurd amount antibodies since immune reaction strong.

So, scrapped live makes sick stomach people listening. one wears masks unless told, one gives shit social distancing, one cares stay home. Bars near full every Friday/Saturday night Sunday/Monday Packer's game. Idk we're going get this. Injecting heorin makes heart stronger! Leader free world People always dying hospitals... What. In. The. Fuck.

I can‚Äôt even imagine horror poor souls experiencing. :( responsible parties better get what‚Äôs coming them. Spanish Flu alright slow boats. taking one single virus example. That's works. averages. population looking at? can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs deadlier flu people age 65. accurate thing say it‚Äôs deadly flu. It‚Äôs incorrect make blanket statement it‚Äôs deadly flu all.

It invalidates everything say afterwards. says vomiting conspiracy crap likely read unreliable source. USA damn joke. get one ones that's built box seals shuts. mean, us... experts saying could next year, longer? vaccine possibly 50% effective? feeling hopeful. Interesting, thanks! That's helpful! 

And then, course, top that, reinfection strain count anyway. also takes faculty support staff manage said children, 55 adults already quarantine 19 testing positive. Many substitutes also simply refusing go back.

The top CDC consideration reopening ""consider COVID-19 transmission rates immediate community communities students, teachers, staff live.""

But keep running shark theory. worried Election Day filled mostly covid deniers polls. every state early voting makes easy vote mail. I'm Wisconsin. ain't seen nothing yet. +1, cringe every time hear Paddy called Patty! laughed hard, take upvote BEIJING (Reuters) - city China‚Äôs Zhejiang province offer experimental coronavirus vaccines residents, China broadens emergency use programme people non-priority groups.

Residents aged 18 59 city Shaoxing, priority groups, apply online inoculation, city‚Äôs health commission said Tuesday WeChat account. name vaccine, say inoculation would start many doses would offered.

Hundreds thousands people already taken experimental COVID-19 vaccines China since launched emergency use programme July aimed essential workers limited groups people higher risk infection. use shots still study raised safety concern among experts.

Last week, Zhejiang became first Chinese province offer voluntary inoculation non-priority residents via emergency use programme, without specifying many people vaccinated.

Shaoxing residents choose inoculated need give reasons wanting vaccine applications charged 400 yuan ($60) two doses, additional inoculation fee 28 yuan per dose, city said.

It immediately clear whether city screen applicants based reasons, whether costs could subsidised. Shaoxing‚Äôs health commission respond requests comment. Crazy date AIDS killed ~30x people Covid. Seems like would way way way higher *Confirmed* reinfection rare it‚Äôs statistical anomaly.

Still, confirmed cases ticking upwards. Test act hope don't. Many people symptoms take extra percussions leading getting results. wish guys best. think long term immunity it. Similar seasonal flu vaccine. No.... they're...what people understand???? Delta -9 illegal matter get from. Delta 8 derived HELP, imported domestic, legal. tried wagging finger disapprovingly giving stern look? Imagine bomb exploded killed 800 people. call average day. IFR static metric, i.e. virus ""set"" fatality rate. Rabies kills 100% hosts develop symptoms, people infected rabies nowadays actually die availability prophylactic treatments.

Likewise, know treatments COVID improved significantly since start pandemic. let COVID run rampant anything treat afflicted, IFR would definitely significantly higher ~0.7% now. I'd expect mass exodus doctors/nurses/hospital staff away republican-led states next decade. Way worse last decade.

Wait doctors nurses need quarantined 14 days exposed. 

You think hospitals short-staffed now? one nurse doctor comes exposed, they'll expose 5.7 others, turn expose 5.7 others, within week, hospital nobody else left care incoming, critical patients. 

What happens then? $200k? Don‚Äôt forget helicopter ride. Building landlord two shutdown restaurants here. 
 
Biden skeebidybop (and Harris she‚Äôs awesome) 2020 president.
 
I can‚Äôt fucking believe republicans claim prolife/patriotic business-first party country... absolutely obliterate every part American growth anti science/ anti expert delusion, ‚Äúexperts‚Äù ‚Äúlibs‚Äù. 
 
Go fuck malicious asses oblivion complete morons. Absolutely disgraceful buffoons. shame American progress end party. Fuckers. still want make money upset brokers pay them... jobbo. Yup. US kinda messed initial lockdown -- arguably one shot keep virus making huge impact domestic economy. ""kinda"", actually mean ""astronomically"". Every economist his/her mother saying beginning. takes IQ 100 shred emotional intelligence see right. no, masks. Halitosis US bad morphed political issue. family nothing say smart am, say something inconvenient like ‚Äúthis probably bad idea this‚Äù I‚Äôm ‚Äúliving life fear‚Äù ‚Äúbrainwashed liberal‚Äù Well, honestly. chronic condition, remainder life. theorized severe autoimmune response occurred led destruction portion brain produces hypocretin. Hypocretin regulates person's sleep. without body wants fall asleep randomly sometimes fall asleep, extreme excessive daytime sleepiness never goes away (supposedly equivalent 48+hrs), extremely vivid dreams/nightmares blur lines reality since ya know ya fell asleep sometimes, heightened emotions leading partial paralysis. mention REM cycle charts repeatedly drift back forth causing dreaming even waking up. Real fun stuff. actually really interesting learn pretty good podcast explaining ""Stuff Know: Narcolepsy works"". Overall though learned deal make life work. easy Im stuck it, find way get it. help work full time pursuing degree....probably spite condition lol. Un-fucking-believable. 

However, refreshing hear even **literal** healthcare workers get bent healthcare system, like us. /s impossible. said good go back schools open bars go back work seat restaurants 50% capacity on. /s  believe it‚Äôs still recommendation cdc test asymptomatic staff. 

Everybody gets temp checked upon coming work (at every hospital know)

They would let work fever, sure mandate get test suspect so.

I certain this, know anything says routinely changing regular mask decreases chance getting it. N95‚Äôs different. would happy listen source does. 

I‚Äôm surprised hospitals issues PPE much point. 

Also far know, vast majority transmission hospital, it‚Äôs community. hospital BELIEVE transmissions hospital. community hand... going it, every single anti masker drives pickup, gun, aggressive tell wear mask. 

Make felony public without mask, anti-maskers lose right vote right bear arms. 

Watch fast masks come then. Texas here. increasing number people straight decided stop wearing masks businesses pretty much open. fucked Thank you. physician it‚Äôs infuriating see people without masks throwing massive parties. don‚Äôt want roses footsteps. want people take seriously. shouldn‚Äôt political. fucking it. don‚Äôt hold iPad family say goodbye loved one s/he dying. never forgive selfish Americans are. I‚Äôm process finding jobs internationally. PTSD continued denial illness can‚Äôt job country anymore. It‚Äôs hard enough CPR kid tell sweetest person you‚Äôve ever met cancer. struggle work people think you‚Äôre lying it‚Äôs media hoax (that shut every government world) stupidity. Also, seasonal influenza never came... Covid came. guy‚Äôs never seen regular protest.

They socially distant. masks, plenty hand sanitizer passed around too. open air. describe regular people ‚Äúpiles‚Äù whatnot makes seem gross..

Edit: made edits ...and added pressure health care system long-haul Covid patients needing medical care time new infections increasing. love hate accurate reflective time. experienced thing since first time keep photo intubated friend shortly died. drains color idiots faces pretty quickly explaining mask coupled photo. We‚Äôre 7 months pandemic, still issue?

We look South Korea another model bad virus transmissible rate truly is. They've tested, tracked, monitored quarantined *everyone* come contact virus, *still* new cases coming daily. mask? Jail. Knowingly go outside, violating quarantine? Jail. Socializing others may exposed? jail. 

People complain freedoms taken away ""forced"" wear mask. Buddy, idea like countries. 

No, uneducated ignorance US, we're going continue see cases climb, deaths climb, people *literally care* slow spread virus down. We'll fighting years, people fatigue wearing masks, N95 masks still impossible obtain. 

Right now, R0 rate hovering around 5.7%, full 1.1% higher highest estimates Spanish Flu (2.4%-4.6%). 

With people walking around asymptomatic, exposing others 21 days start showing first signs getting tested, talking literally hundreds thousands people potentially exposed, one exposed person densely populated area. 

So much ignorance causing much unnecessary loss life. good friend zombie scare Sunday. told fucked up, dude therapy it. joked it, story insane, believe showed dispatch call. amazing human body endure, also amazing maggots eating brain person, still alive. Aside health issues, risk medical bankruptcy free national healthcare enough scare anyone. Oh, whoops, thanks. Haha bets editor reups? test available yes. help contact tracing could protect others. channels owned company, Sinclair, company instructed reporters say this. clearly message corporate. literally prove anything. plenty news outlets owned Sinclair... real number one place held whole century. Covid less 6-9 months kids Americans fucking stupid universities Foreigners incredibly untrue. research comment next time, fucking plague arrived Europe October 1347, 12 ships Black Sea docked Sicilian port Messina.

Lockdowns work great majority populace smart enough need lockdown figure avoid disease. Well, number deaths world wide, moved much 5k day. Go catch ebola since people die every night lmao Compare historical weather period northeast outbreak timeframe. Well, positivity rate shows story happening, locally maybe county worse? Yeah surprised too. expecting ""as bad Spring"" projection (which still terrible) Remember call ""flatten curve prevent hospital overloading""?

The hospitals overloaded August. now.

**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed.

Depending vaccine production, quickly distribute, many people going get vaccine, timelines could quicker. course depending ‚Äúgroup‚Äù you‚Äôre in, could getting way April. Let's talk that. 
Maybe shut imports country caused two three recent rapidly spread exotic diseases? 

Maybe executive wants shut travel hotzone, call racist so?

Maybe recognize masks bandage, solution?

Finally, pretend want. ""Everyone America"" solved issue. That's arrogance y'all accuse yanks of. **Who want mask? Go pin post** guess they‚Äôre seeing. don‚Äôt really care. historic ironic twist, keeping earth hot possible, republicans trying save us pandemic! /s People enough it. elections clear, time think recall elections.

Politicians begin praise economic benefits opening up, ""handled"" virus. Low death rates touted. media can't use virus weapon upcoming election, coverage diminish. already has. 

The 24 hour news cycle take another 6 months virus. news cycle often drives policy decisions action. 

I mean call virus ""political"" thing, real dangerous risk. think feel strategy going change Nov. 3 elections. sides content attack opponents defend positions right now. elections, going change.

I know people work state/federal governments campaigns, deadass forgot even happening. social media crying (one way other) drives response. election, response matter. good friend EMT, spoke today current state things, area.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fjoll√•tta house. Ok, quick googling found 6 million car accidents US year. wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs 90% people morons (maybe lucky morons?). 6 million accidents it‚Äôs hard get number many actual people affected. looks like coronavirus cases showing signs slowing down, plus us accurate statistics due people unable get test, point where, 2 people car involved accident, number people infected COVID soon (12 million). top that, let‚Äôs compare death rates. 36,500 car accidents vs. 221,000 COVID *so far*. Looks like car analogy pretty generous, actually. 

I didn‚Äôt escape question. It‚Äôs right comment: go away eradicate virus least get point infections. didn‚Äôt give exact date nobody knows that. I‚Äôm burning masks second can.

Okay, I‚Äôm curious. think people trying control us asking us wear mask. exactly wants control us? that? evil plan? hinge wearing $2 mask faces? 100% comes administration. actual teaching could accomplished scenario? Haha too, seen ""Cells Work""? :D 100% chance able reinfect everyone immunity last, can't create vaccine reason kind damage could do? 10s 100s millions dead years refuses go away keep precautions like distancing? USA! NUMBAHH #1 Please enlighten me. confident won't? Viruses tenacious. sleep. replicate longer capable otherwise, exist huge numbers.

To defeat it, need act swiftly single focus. Masks, isolation/quarantine, physical distancing.

This hodge-podge response working. many must die get act together?

Be safe, people. life save may own. asked rather bold prediction. I'm awe photo used article ü§£ Possibly depends state perhaps? know Trump took shot missed wrong target. either understand people die day get infected, knew intentionally lied people push agenda.

He's simply giant fraudster/con man, likely latter. love anecdotes, they're useless type evidence. 

Funny, none examples mention deploying firearm, waited sometime incidents start carrying incidents 14 years? Yea sounds like bit anomaly. employee goes 20+ strangers' houses every week, never caught covid. 

Thank illustrating last point made previous comment selfishness. basically understand? 

December: Risk, Elderly, Frontline Workers 

April: Everyone else like Million dead newsworthy. Wonder is. attention whore 50 barely old. Definitely curmudgeon age. guy asshole Health Minister Martin Foley addressed testing stuff-up press conference morning, clarifying **the needles used test changed use**, device changed, despite meant repeated used one person, multiple people.

HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 cause common cold. . common cold caused four majority rhinoviruses couple viral families representative members.

The three known coronaviruses infect humans SARS, SARS2 MERS.

I'm exactly sure number quoting, general idea definitely lines scientific consensus viruses general. awesome news! follow solution way end .... NOBODY would grocery shop EVERYONE would outsource it.

Then exactly picks groceries? exactly leaves basement risks visiting deadly grocery store pick groceries?

You comfortable idea people outsource grocery shopping people, inevitably make less $$$ less privileged versus outsourcing, actually take degree risk.

The greatest privilege life GREEN privilege. appear one benefits green privilege. resources, outsource risk less ability avoid risk.

Hey bud, you‚Äôre wrong 3 counts. majority died early on....

Negative. majority (51%) deaths happened since June, spring. seem impression stop wipe virus.

Not all, gave idea? least get vaccine better treatments substantially reduce severity / fatality. far [long term effects] low probability symptoms happen diseases well.

Huh? long term data side effects listed survivors. virus literally hasn‚Äôt around long enough studies run variable. A-game scientists resources focused vaccines, diagnosis, survivability right now, longitudinal studies. symptoms exist diseases (I would argue combination seen others makes one damn insidious), they‚Äôre anywhere near numbers. 

Get head sand stop dismissing misinformation. It‚Äôs super helpful. I'm trying figure math behind 25% increase basically. know 117k number weeks added may looking wrong thing increase excess deaths increase overall deaths first breakdown appears irrelevant. Continue 2022? sure

The darkest part 2022? sounds unlikely Can't speak Florida Texas swept ton cases rug released random large batches ""backlogged"" positives weeks months later. criminals charge shuffling numbers around make look better is. satire? miss new stats kids dieing? idiots CNN keep making big deal nothing!

As common cold coronaviruses, takes people months antibodies dissipate. Others, take 18-24 months. already seeing reinfections, take evidence immune system could treating like Coronaviruses.

SARS classic evoked strong immune response, antibodies wore typically 2-5 depends county.

Recently phone conversation, asked idea mine stay away, remember.  told unspoken mutual decision, ""... neither us stupid.""

My father told relieved. hoping told stay away, would have.

I leave place every week two, essential errands. extremely lonely existence.

A news report came recently employees grocery store across street tested positive.

My mother died June. attend funeral (14 day travel quarantine); service also limited 10 people. Since one posited yet, I'd like people try think terms on/off switch immunity. 

I think beginning, pretty early on, scientists believed immunity would sort time limit. Two years optimistic period, may turn 1 year bit optimistic.

However, think happening different people different durations, seeing lowest immunity periods possible (aside rare people), given case like NYC, think probably bottom 10% we'd see blow more. time tell.

It may people year, maybe like half people 6 months. 

If average goes lower 6 months think that's things going seem sort dire. here. delirious flu. fever really high, literally even sit bed, felt like golf ball lodged throat tried swallow even water. thought going die. people diagnose flu mild cold symptoms laugh.

People arguing herd immunity either idiots people taking even pessimistic route people thinking we're going dealing matter restrictions unsustainable.

I heard single credible scientist argue herd immunity outright. I've heard say need careful restrictions make sure weigh public health pros/cons closing businesses/schools.

Still, think anyone touting herd immunity even thinks end disease. think make spread slow enough contain decent public health measures keeping economy intact thus preventing off-target public health crises. Also, anyone argues reducing restrictions without increasing public health measure (e.g. MASSIVE increase testing/contact tracing, vaccine, etc...) is, imo, either idiot entirely genuine intentions. wouldn‚Äôt say nothing know virus along treatment therapies well knowing spreads. novel virus didn‚Äôt really know anything begin with. let run rampant many people would died overflowed hospital systems. Hindsight 20/20 debate economic impacts I‚Äôd caution wait winter making assumptions. that's lot, mean lot, negative results werent reported countrywide database present regional ones.

Because can't reduce severity COVID removing major comorbidity lung infections? Yeah think restrictions would place that's difference. wrong, expecting humans suddenly right thing months end recipe disaster. That's leadership needed. Even 90% us right thing, 10% easily enough ruin everyone else. People management tough.

Don't get wrong, I'm defending people stupid things, simply saying blaming make crisis go away. wasnt hundreds thousands short span, again, check live US screw that, need lockdown. livelihoods economic wellbeing young people way important point. ask why? Im genuinely confused. change weather we‚Äôre pretty much confined indoor spaces transmission getting easier, second wave? almost exact experiences Uppsala, place proper outbreak spring, especially municipalities around Uppsala insanely bad records nursing homes. Uppsala bubble, gaming nights, Skype drinks, board game nights. personally knew one two actually there, never really got sick. 

If look antibody tests done throughout summer, positivity within 20-29 group high, think almost 25 per cent. 

Within bubble spread apparently quite well, people really get sick. 

I sure different now, maybe increased testing shows cases within student group, also events, introduction events example, done almost pandemic (minus night clubs) instead gaming board gaming nights, people actually real home parties - skipped these, since standing half leg still student life heard saw it. Yeah I‚Äôm city SC besides masks grocery store wouldn‚Äôt know there‚Äôs pandemic.

You need consider Poland communist 1989. took economic hit transitioned capitalist European state. 

It's advancing quickly since joining EU still significantly behind Western European countries especially compared nordic countries. 

Every European country needs taken merits. difference wealth governance huge despite small geographical distances similar cultures. already announced it. places vaccine reached restrictions still place, must obey them. problem people wearing mask, social distancing etc. Basically every person /her self. problem told do. always **not** lockdown.

Well, title talking ‚Äòshops‚Äô. I‚Äôm sure represents big chunk what‚Äôs outside f&amp;b Thank you.

what point trying make? useful social settings high transmission rates high morbidity occurs, high scanning rate achieved.   people younger healthier died im early fucking 20s, check Nah, worst case would reinfections always worse subsequent time.

Then, commit evil you. bomb you, drive house home, kill cousins mistook cousin's wedding 'militant convoy', generally unapologetic unless media take blind eye specific case.

Like; people might seek testing unless worse symptoms? personally see information could useful, feel like going first impressions right now, I'm going dig heels decide 'extra unnecessary' - er - mean - real point, there's reason except 'elicit emotion'.

Well ok. enjoy that.

If point compare deadliness covid vs pandemics, wish would look ""1st year deaths"" true apples apples.

Or trying measure impact disease regardless time frame, limit swine flu single year include 150 years cholera?

Edit: typos entire country, 75% people.

Sure, vaccinating risk groups healthcare workers important first step, doubt enough. u/opisska pointed out, government help shop owners salary rent.

Yeah, US ""fuck non-rich"" country... sure mean this. UK good wearing masks.

the measures major outbreak. wasnt really change approached things. thing mask compliance increased though. author article legitimately comparing raw death numbers without considering percentage population? meaningful metric?

Thought experiment: supposing global population were, say, one trillion instead seven billion, supposing disease killed ten million people, would worse better covid?

It‚Äôs almost like may leave people coming too. EU currently worse shape Canada. least prepared 2nd wave. Isn‚Äôt essential PPE required provided employers OSHA? surgical mask? November? Also federal testing debacle first months doomed us. seriously catastrophic impairment early efforts allowed coronavirus virus seed every corner country.

We still don‚Äôt national testing strategy. national mask mandate. national anything, really. staggering abdication leadership around I'm saying US careful smart anything. US fucked grand scale.

What saying US lot willing eager countries throw children bus. Adults go spend days indoors restaurants, bars gyms, kids can't go school. screwed up?

We already know kids generally great risk infection. US sacrificing children's well-being protect others, kids themselves. Anyone remembers happened 1789, 1917 1949? Hardly proof anything!

Also, I'm interested seeing ratio pre-retirement age deaths post retirement age deaths. wonder means future funding social security COVID-19 means millennials got solvent SSI fund one even worse off. ignore anything want believe quite easily. Especially facebook posts twitter posts say exactly want hear. You‚Äôre talking something else; eradication. That‚Äôs thing herd immunity. I‚Äôm extremely pro vaccination would never deny importance small pox, polio measles vaccination. 

Having herd immunity means enough people protected uncontrolled spreading stops.

There herd immunity population small pox, unfavorable conditions small pox contagious combination causing serious disease young population made impossible get enough control without vaccination. It‚Äôs bit holistic chinese restaurant study nicely mapped transmission seat number distance vent 

Also see people reporting cases standing closed rooms see fewer cases among maids/cleaners clean rooms already proven impossible. 20% people infected develop antibodies catch again. lock bit short. full elimination lock needs last 8 10 weeks. would interesting see results this. far two countries executed successful elimination lock widespread community spread China Wuhan Australia Victoria. lock downs New Zealand also effective cannot compared New Zealand proactive took charge early, widespread community spread, lock downs shorter also effective. bother ordering then? let specify amount money click ""surprise me"". people wearing masks staying home dude. won‚Äôt see them. Thank wonderful insight. *week away* Phew. bad. FYI: well hope come way. appreciate it, really progress. i'll see one around feels worse before, i'll move back in. perhaps getting drunk every night benefit itself. we'll see.

We may getting fatter, 100 years ago childhood malnutrition, untreated asthma, diabetes mixed pervasive tobacco use, poor air quality densely populated areas would left people equally vulnerable so.  Yes, believe that's official CDC death count time analysis. That's different saying 2/3 number beyond deaths reported COVID also COVID. assumption 33% also COVID-related. needed leadership things would different. weird beast indeed. challenging many aspects society, expect impact healthcare/health policy lasting.

""we're gonna that""

""see rule work""

(btw, lots people adhere recommendations PPE rules, doctors, nurses, people complete morons etc. seem work degree universal standard medical care, mention plethora available scientific studies demonstrate measurable effectiveness mask wearing) problem flu vaccine isn‚Äôt particularly effective least first round Covid vaccines likely bad. vaccine 70% effective (better expected) 50% population gets vaccinated (better expected given year), end 35% protection. Throw extra 1% people previously infected (assuming immunity perfect long lasting) get 36% population protected isn‚Äôt enough get us herd immunity prevent community spread even masking social distancing compliance remains steady (which won‚Äôt, people sick things).

The American public needs wrap head around likely scenario instead rosey painting media tainted federal agencies painting since March. 

This much worse public seems appreciate it‚Äôs maddening scientists watch public large continue risky behavior light currently understand. two year duration pandemic seems less less likely things get worse worse. Yeah bad POC situation account executive

It 2 weeks one family extended family got sick. Get used üòø Good job, Bolsonaro, got right time. What's Sweden? ZERO deaths, while, take know kind outdated data propaganda getting, there's lot smearing going Sweden, like Business Insider article they're adopting lockdown policy, Tegnell (their Fauci equivalent) issue statement no, they're not, idea rumor Let clear: agree final outcome. pretty much nothing done last two months avoid getting situation inevitable. reason hard prolonged lockdown spring, without real exit strategy, cost much political capital possible react things get hand. NMN derivative vitamin B3 currently investigated longevity benefits. nearly much control international affairs domestic ones. law state powers stop defined lines international broders one them. can't command countries policies that, state power stops border. like can't control internet do, outside enforcable area. control comes PC.

The first thing seperate external connections, one less introduction vector, cut steady non-controllable outside flow.

You use principle recursively within country too.

Same bathtub overflows floors get wet. shut tap first keep wiping floor keeping tap open?

The EU special case, frankly, Schengen agreement makes everything act single travel area outsider.

What happened coordinated Schengen-wide tight border. way, least keep what's happening elsewhere outside control least buy time deal what's already going inside.

A coordinated Schengen-wide approach might been:

* Reroute incoming non-Schengen air passenger traffic key airports fewer areas deal with, deny entry elsewhere
* Introduce unified procedures physical frontier border crossings, preferably essential ones spare personel focus large important crossings Lockdown bad, uncontrolled spread COVID worse.  100% this.

How hard stay home 2 -3 months watch TV? Hell, let's make Netflix free time. I'm mistaken, State Sao Paulo one testing vaccine, federal government. know exactly Brazil administration works, could state buys vaccine country. would credible actually tested pupils proactively instead reporting symptomatic cases. asymptomatic cases still contagious likely what's driving this. train detection dogs living; is, indeed, easy add new scent dog‚Äôs scent ‚Äúvocabulary‚Äù. time conservation search rescue training. What's interesting even countries handling COVID-19 successful minimal lockdowns, see particular group people certain set values push idea pandemic political conspiracy end creating pockets rising cases. Hmm. problem system regional. Meaning every region decides organize healthcare system. regions less resources invest might lot less margin. let's honest, none actually permanently running 10x ICU beds (with equipment staff) nothing know southern italy margin extremely thin, even existed.

But pandemic weird beqst, ironically made lombardy healthcare one best country created disaster. Instead investing multiple facilities around territory decided ""super-centers"", would allocate resources rational way.

That helped virus spread quickly soon covid got there. Patients lombardy visiting hospitals sent home took virus them. testing March/April developed today (from June) ‚Äúwave‚Äù seeing would look like small ripple, wave.

It never ceases amaze contortions supporters Swedish ""strategy"" go deny reality.

Back March/April supposed believe numbers seemed show Sweden badly, numbers higher March/April, I'm supposed believe early numbers false.

In entertainment industry known 
*noun* (in film, television series, fictional work) piece new information **imposes different interpretation previously described events**, typically used facilitate dramatic plot shift **account inconsistency.**

As ICU / Deaths... one problem argument... take account dramatic improvements treatments occurred since March/April.

No country... matter bad second wave been... seen high number hospitalisations deaths March.

For example:  clearly see numbers cases per day significantly higher first wave, numbers deaths fraction were.

Using argument, neither Spain Italy seen second wave, numbers deaths increased level first wave... data wanted anywhere else (publically).

I base analysis available data, guesses like did. Title reads: ""Federal government dying COVID-19 underfunding native healthcare centuries.""

... See definition changes?

*""Beware children old gods, verdict carries weight fathers.""* type stuff. :3 Jesus christ. What‚Äôs point then? Either open schools deal risk fucking close them. Dogs rights Americans point friends? Lol shake hands greet friends that's weird af. live Victoria, lockdown 6 months, people like you.

No. lockdown 6 months people adhering lockdown still spreading virus. absolutely idea social economic consequences bring.

What part ""I touched anyone 7 months"" understand? think impact mental health? longest in-person interaction since March two weeks ago, got ice cream talked friends 2 hours. everything topped half hour. 

Economic consequences: government provide economic assistance people affected.

Instead yelling me, apparently according standards fucking thought killing ***ENOUGH***, give alternatives? tell solution is? then? saying think vaccine work? mean one traveling internationally refusing shut borders got us point likely driving second wave, international travel ""necessary"" guess.

Well done EU, well done religious person, find kinda hilarious many supposed Christians ignore Jesus said. expect happen die? might forgive you, don‚Äôt think Old Testament father will. People stop thinking go stores bars wear mask company friends family, put mask on, always. 

People think masks made show :/ saw Mongol Steepe Horde Velocity Lollapalooza Federal Government buy (apparently, since news based tweet). Sao Paulo state government already bought 60 million doses Sinovac. Florida this? Politicians especially risk, meet tons new people everyday. idea :/ There's shortage tests shortage labs/lab staff. test, negatives turn flu similar symptoms, guess they're requiring certain symptoms rule flu.

Just found one staff's fathers probably friend's last weekend tested positive - he's sick cough fever, lie losing sense smell get tested. feel pain,teachers balkan country working 4 shifts 7:45 7 Pm,plus teachers give us lessons online 4 shifts. terminology wasn‚Äôt great, finding emits highest viral load *is* useful. bad reporting assume *would* infect people average infected person enclosed space super spreader. mean I‚Äôd take 3-6 months away end amazing news point. Living end sight hardest mental wellness standpoint. I‚Äôll celebrate vaccine reason alone. criminal behavior. so? people knocking door God given right trick treat, can't believe giving candy year.

That's decorations house gonna lights Impossible without closing borders countries, including EU member states would also devastated economy would keep borders closed virus eliminated elsewhere.

The strong lockdown thing halted exponential case growth high death rate initially. Another thing point Italy's situation bad, horribly worse EU countries many also struggling implementing additional tough measures. think even clear hoping vaccination herd immunity solution. Eradication goal, especially places like Australia New Zealand. Agree need plan. end another lockdown inevitable rate, suspect trying push back far can, can't see going like maybe 2-4 weeks option left. here. cannot believe stupid people are. Like, yeah get it, want shut economy down. Neither I. want take simple precaution prevent it. I‚Äôve seen chit chat sub (not daily threads, i‚Äôve noticed daily threads gotten lot less pro lockdown) another massive shutdown coming US, likely if/when joe takes office. Hopefully it‚Äôs people talking ass.

However, reading articles there, understand pandemic scientists try keep eye factory farms well bats exotic animal markets probability. really locals abbreviate Singapore English? nicknames could chosen country... Nowhere world people 100% adhere recommendations even did, would definitely adhere PPE rules (replacing masks every X hours, touching them, etc.). It'll get pandemic control.

The messaging somehow going manage eradicate needs really stop. creates false reality experts know full well pipe dream best. Portland area find needing test, got rapid test symptoms ARC Urgent Care weeks ago. Maybe things changed since then, travel related/possible exposure testing symptomatic testing. furthest ahead vaccine world. Oxford Moderna ones close. thought really well done informative! well, political capital important however. need plan, reacting things already control doesn‚Äôt count. testing vaccine ultimately won‚Äôt buy (despite already agreed buy vaccine manufacturer). waste resources. circlejerking. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Good news hospitals. contributed?

Superficial article anyone watched Totally Control Hulu? situation get control Xmas rate Going school really vital children. get meals school, physical activity, health care, education, course

This made laugh. depending schools meals health care. problem isn‚Äôt keeping schools open, it‚Äôs shitty system outside it. half reasons opening them, aren‚Äôt recognizing problem always issue. feel like dumb question.... ‚Äúsuper spreaders‚Äù called generally interact people carrying higher viral load? contagious longer others? people would die 

That‚Äôs basically everyone. thing killed people ages health levels. may extremely rare cases, it‚Äôs still thing. seattle resident, believe got spared tech executives/amazon insider information bad things really started keeping employees home super early. mean like *that* far away, especially considering schools closed December anyway  well could always reverse engineering vaccine's formula make everyone pre-existing conditions stayed home took extreme caution, number would millions.

Reality give two hoots political capital. win every time. 1918 Flu far deadly though. nearly level technology hygienic practices now, that's bad comparison. epitome brainless sycophant. ""Trump daddy good! can't explain why!"" please inform conspiracy theorists think going go away election? right, currently tested positive infect others meantime doesn¬¥t test positive. always miss one spread others. sub becoming positive? Sore throat definitely first sign COVID. Early COVID totally indistinguishable cold flu, thing spread efficiently. part fact less dangerous flu certain demographics. people care themselves.

Wish mayhem that's England :( babymoms therapist. used hang 5-7 therapist friends talked shop, drank tea, talked organic gluten free indigenous improv theater such. learned lot think see role. also read every issue therapist magazines got. editorial Trump's election friggin hilarious - watching someone trying say ""this man shit next four years characterized fire, blood, poverty, hatred disease"" using extremely gentle, non political, non committal professional language really interesting. Basically, knew going lot work near future.

Most care clients snd genuinely want help. Everyone worth helping someone; therapists find ""worried well"" frustrating. people financial relationship stability health addiction issues, generally major traumas past feel right - problems ""all head"" biochemical depression/anxiety related. often issues level low modert level intensity decades. therapists find WW frustrating want work people major traumas, rape, early family loss, etc still changing growing lot, maybe they're difficult rewarding? Others prefer worried well relate better; feel underqualified deal specific heavy traumas. They're conscious areas specialization - ex would never included LGBT+ specialization qualifications even though take specific courses, real-ass college (smith mt Holyoke), clients, higher standard think enough. things super underinformed about, like illicit drugs. 

(Also, believe individual therapy crucial basically none believe marriage counseling works. think marriage doomed, think people show counseling already late count years, think couples counseling super effective general. Yes, even couples counselors said private sat nearby. One said like CPR person who'd dead year. like helps much even done time)

And general, matching person person, almost like dating. might good therapist cares, good You; good helping particular issues, one great overall works well you. assume child's mother good job; reason believe isn't. know caring person. damn know listen. Almost everything said misinterpreted twisted something base often comical. used feel like literally beg read lines almost every communication. started writing letters texting instead talking, even room, stop every sentence recontextualize real time. I'd say ""please, please, I'm literally begging you, want show care me, please respond literal interpretation words. Take face value believe mean direct way; subtext, decode, interpet."" witten index card read important thing say. problem relationships her, current partner - misunderstandings happen times they're exceptions, rules, words work like 99% time. know sound like I'm dumping baggage kind am, general accept plenty fault responsibility mistakes relationship that's topic, bring therapy communication, point compatibility - I'm saying ex bad therapist, saw hard tried clients know cared, generally diligent following protocols things right although tell things certain clients, one person least, even hear understand basic communication. Like told angry, distant alien planet woman. distance relative position - surely makes sense people distant. seems good relationship current BF; must communicate effectively. Maybe clinical context different, IDK, never treated me. Seeing talk family explained lot - none hear parsing meaning someone says extremes *required* function house. meeting sister, like way without good intentions...

Also, said ""oh tell friends much job tell much issues, case one becomes client figure out"". like.. ""what? chances one like 50 people tops count friends needs therapy cold calls particular? like rural small town."". Well, super wrong. Two apparently... much likely thought. One turned away, already heard much treat guess, treated. admit could tell say basic things clients, identifying details general situations, one suspiciously tight lipped. Also saw name papers lol. ex like ""I'm going tell I'm seeing not, can't ask it"". like.. ""uh.. would even know I'm asking person üòÖ?"" guess lots people need therapy, many different providers.

She seeing six seven clients recall felt close limit. pre pandemic. They're absolutely swamped now, stressed themselves. Therapists traumatized patients routinely. get life kind sucked little bit every time, aware - learn school. they're generally required therapist themselves, vent clients drop veneer professionalism. call ""supervisors"", although they're hierarchy anything. Joe could supervise sally supervised Sasha supervised Joe. they're super focused mitigating avoiding stress lives, self care ""filling cup"" they'll burn quickly shit job well personally miserable. Nothing dark awful acceptable conversational topics daily life; much darkness work discuss anything bad home. I'm kind a.. dunno, generally pessimistic dark person, kind lapsed anarchist thinks humans flawed selfish animals probably ever really fix problems meaningfully new forms oppression form quickly old ones reduced. I'm mean everyone multiple perspectives; individual level think people make huge strides totally rewrite lives become great happy - certainly improved life huge margin - individual improvements scale effectively consistently sustainably enough derail momentum gibbering, cannibalistic horrors history. I'm explaining perspectives meet.

Seeing patients really lucrative - difference 6 10 could mean huge increase income - seen many therapists unethical see really feel handle. always talking two therapists town saw like 15 people something, saying possibly good job many people money. Also therapists trust psychologists lol. agreed that.

Anyway, know went long, hope ramblings gave context situation. Speak english, understand stupid things say. stonks up*  *recommendations*

You mean lockdown. happened, thought everyone knew lockdowns ""don't work"". Congratulations. Live college town ~20k Kansas. hospital nearly full. problem now, lots small regional hospitals could pick slack - they're full too. Soon Patients could driven three hours Wichita two Kansas City. Seems like less people infected predicted. 
Lets see coming days bring. Call is. People deliberately spreading virus. I'm Iowa. Check HyVee (grocery store masks ""recommended""). Sometimes compliance pretty good-75% so. Sometimes 90%+ wearing mask. know exactly doing. already Germany. contact tracing limited app data privacy protection. They‚Äôve seemed curbed spread falling windows though. hardly outbreaks schools Germany. like immigration crisis stopped issue election. Nature knows mercy.. really luck weather, starts getting cold too.  *Paddy 

And that‚Äôs weird thing do, pint like normal person. Exactly, like 13th deadliest pandemic^(for white people (as someone pointed below).) Ireland extremely effective lockdown too. single digit cases June/July schools went back opened borders (particularly Northern Ireland U.K.) cases rising like crazy. officially third wave smaller. America busily sitting top first wave gets bigger bigger water starts disappear front it. 
 
The view house probably reassuring ATM gonna destroy everything. 
1 million Christmas. least Massachusetts, [the early lockdown *not* lead increase countries following wave pattern, think measures aside, things play Since college student, tell something wondering lately.

You go everybody wearing mask, get interested someone? 

When age would walking around campus, mall street saw someone liked approached her.

Now everyone masks going last months come. 

I know still attracted people masks face features attractive gender?

I know apps nicest way know people outside real life.

So going work? Yeah probably right. Also, know less 5% biology.

So opinion üòÇ

No, let‚Äôs ask question insteadü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Didnt article explain virus actually got bit worse became silent time jumped humans?

So wouldn‚Äôt continue path?

Couldn‚Äôt stupid virus like stupid people, realizing it‚Äôs also killing becoming killing mutation?

Why assume virus knows it‚Äôs become milder time ‚Äúlive‚Äù longer ‚Äúlife‚Äù?  Slightly inaccurate headline, might want repost. Russia record new deaths new cases yesterday. new conspiracy appear Well done ex ZSSR nations. /s 

The denial catching up. Good luck degree! described must bit like hell. :/ No, no, completely incorrect. ""data"" show *at all*. Countries early lockdowns better. countries best lockdowns. best argument Tegnellists 12 countries enforced lockdowns late slightly worse Sweden.

Tegnell Giesecke said early neighboring countries, ""wait year see"". 8 months now, nobody even close catching up. Nobody seriously believe catch up. Sweden failed completely lazy right thing. Yes new one, added top that. possible slash numbers heavily. mentality part problem. India pass USA.  always get second wave try hard enough true residents Uppsala. That's author talking about

This recommendations changed dude. Welcome club  mega cucklord Well said constructive interference \^\^ said herd resistance point. question when. Try quoting single sentences spam responses them, mark troll.

*This true. Nothing changes. regional level impose new advisories, possibly close bars/restaurants earlier (as municipalities that).*

""It's totally lockdown even though lockdown enforced"". convincing.

*No! happened yet. still live mantra spring. Stay home sick, avoid unnecessary travel, keep distance, wash hands.*

No, true residents Uppsala. That's author talking about. Also really hope living ""under mantras"" spring. There's new information asymptotic spread mask wearing.

*He head part organisation around 400 people Folkh√§lsomyndigheten. one person making decisions.*

Just like Donald Trump then. Nobody cares, place responsibility him. nothing ""competence"". read FHM leaks, Tegnell low competence disease prevention writing.



‚Äã people still get ... hence continued attempts represent data different ways. find info guessed based know nearly bad first wave yet data perspective.

Don't spread misinformation. 

Here's good imagine time traveller came back told trump needed stuff even though people hate 17 years virus dig Antarctica (which due climate change mining) wipe everyone antibodies covid help neutralize it.

""you could make religion this..

no don't."" We're frogs pot water slowly starts cooking. Almost? girlfriend, live with, dad going Ohio couple weeks help sister move New York. sister doesn‚Äôt take virus serious are. goes restaurants pretty frequently boyfriend also gone couple parties California visit family. I‚Äôm little scared cause girlfriend haven‚Äôt gone except groceries, groceries. reacting? Internet economist here. predict economy making ‚ò≠-shaped recovery hell talking about?

This ALWAYS study results reported. inherent error study responsible thing misrepresent data. Governor Stitt brains thinks need statewide mask mandate, person charge available COVID hospital beds. smh Don‚Äôt listen person lol. That‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù point college. College education (yes get job) huge fun life experience. isn‚Äôt time life, least responsible adult, hangout and/or party friends everyday week, live within 1 mile radius friends, choose skip responsibilities day little consequences...the list goes on. College lifetime experience really sad everyone doesn‚Äôt get experience right now. college possible, it‚Äôs definitely same. getting job thing people think they‚Äôre getting college, they‚Äôre wrong. hope so. People getting it, still. I'm getting wedding invitations receptions hard postponed summer like clear going eat taco buffet 50 people. People think need going lives &amp; that's spreading. sister attended grandfather's funeral day surgery &amp; said nobody masks, everybody hugging everybody &amp; nobody seemed give shit. traveled Virginia funeral plane- would've it, could've given every damn person there.

I also wonder much spread people traveling state? notice lot people taking postponed trips &amp; coming back family states traveling visit demanding see you. situations people asked quarantine first they? Hell no. worried health traveling first place. South Korea pretty much considered island well. land border fortified border world. Thailand and
Vietnam bigger mystery. want say us live Wisconsin STAYING home. daughter played another child since March 14. talks stuffed animals pretending friends (I could imagine sending preschool). husband left job would able avoid risks, working two jobs home try mitigate financial damage. 

I sub virus still China. seen people street taken away ambulances EMTs hazmat suits (we downtown city). understood could mean family get it. one help, one us ended ventilator longterm consequences worse, lives child's life would impacted forever. 


We far rich. debt, mortgage. regular people ""hunkering down"" since March continue safe continue ""normal life."" appalled horrified ignorance selfishness people around us go bars gather Friday evenings large groups socialize. over, think consider options living elsewhere, life, science, community mean here. one entire country leaves house... reason all. Realllllllly. Trump told people wear masks lol, anything says comes shit. Biden

How wins first. fucking chance political advisors let that, GOP governors even follow  neighbor wants get pvc pipe make candy chute front door end driveway! NJ they'd bachelor's teaching certificate, associate's required daily sub position, long term sub requirements regular teacher.   Edgy stuff lock everyone yes, remove vectors - neither country that, initial seed plays big part. 

Looking [mobility see recommendations effect week later neighboring countries, lower though - go cafe pandemic mean people go there. Stockholm ghost city. organizer host 50, even 500 people, book big artists. Lot's public places also closed down, like museums sports, heck, state casinos still closed. 

If cross-check Norway's Sweden's restrictions/recommendations see differ much, except timing. actual effect peoples behavior even less different, outcome deaths much greater.

I think short lockdowns great tool, totally overrun perfect timing, window already closed time. I'm saying black white everyone seems think. Yeah, obviously. Basically Belgium's death toll might inflated. ever bothered tracing They're stupid. worse: malicious compliance. 317 new deaths 15700 new cases.  protocol. positive, nurse take post-exposure prophylaxis drug, minor side effects. must start 48 hours safe. negative, take drug. Here's issues trick treating.

We know virus lives plastic while..what candy wrapped in? folks who've isolating therr homes filling candy bowls. someone covid home? healthy member hands candy..germs sick member already candy.

And even ya leave damn bowl out..what happens kids congregate around bowl outsids door? Maskless adults kids? Great youve got door shut barrier.

But whats preventing outside getting sick? stop kids running bowl candy? get adults make kids distance? explain kids yet ""sorry cant friends trick treat them. could kill play together right now...heres lollipop watch great pumpkin""

Im mom 3 kids..halloween favorite. even accommodating hunt backyard candy isnt same. Mitch gets way business owners rich Ideally we‚Äôd limit things like shopping allow schools America consumerism important proper education. Come florida, governor says COVID mission accomplished everything open back normal! like seven guys insisting live life everyone else ages Lol really weird headline. ‚ÄúEquivalent to‚Äù wtf even mean People that? Thats insane. Yeah sorry maths wrong.. never multiplied 100 get percentage!

General point still stands though. I'm way downplaying covid, saying terms deaths barely going register blip people look back history humanity. Social societal effects remembered future familiar they're doing, hope they're going cities like Detroit, Atlanta, Honolulu etc. lot population falls minority. Heck, Hawaii majority asian right? agree Americans like laser-focus themselves, comparing American deaths Covid worldwide deaths Vietnam war would stupid. NOTHING SEE HERE! EVERYTHING FINE! one look exploding mountain background... fine, fellow Pompeians. Look history post first. guy racist though Yeah could print money instead. economy stock market afterall. Flu COVID like post Guess better get back bike. No, perhaps take responsibility.  think he's saying Russia. Oh :(

Anyway ... husband works there? sure proof give you. minimum wage workers permanent wage increase. Musical chairs pandemic defense? Gyms risky people breathing heavily lift weights, necessarily they're touching surfaces, although that's always sorta disgusting aspect going gym, probably wipe things anyway. I've used checkbox turn substitutions I've explicitly added instructions ""NO substitutions"" makes difference. I'm lucky half order available try make substitutions anyway. substitutions much expensive, maybe that's pressure store it.

I've also found carefully check deliver. Once, bag expensive meat cheese never showed up. Wonder went? Stay place! bong hits! I'm honestly happy decision leave hospital Covid units behind. went taking care people care taking care taking care people dying Covid care families care I'm done.

No, I'm ""assuming"" COVID much mild literally evidence shows mild. 2 100 people planet died pandemic 1918, yeah, could argue might counting errors, say COVID comparable, they'd need counting something like 5 dead every 1 pandemic death. include demographic shifts, see COVID extremely non lethal young adults children, demographics made much larger percentage 1918 population. even really debatable idea presenting. logical argument case. idea people asymptomatic 1918 pandemic irrelevant. 2% people alive planet killed it. COVID would almost certainly kill 2% people planet every person got hospitals exist, IFR virus estimated .6%, IFR 50 year olds estimated .06%, dropping .01% people 30. lethal virus young, 1918 pandemic especially lethal young.

I can't misrepresent statement. one know literally made post it. look people's submission history avoid inevitable conversation teenager.

And come insane stalker. Congrats. can't bring anything discussion derail irrelevant stuff. suspect see impact well past end virus although subtly. ""hobby"" math (I enjoy building models day job, can't claim scientific rigor question, nerdy interest problem space) suggests overloaded healthcare system far larger short term impact non-acute symptom diagnosis hospitals care providers triage resources independent lock (as see even states hitting approaching hospital capacities certain regions - many doctors, nurses, beds, lab capacity, secondary factor human healthcare resources disproportionately affected covid-19 reducing capacity, etc.)

That said, looking purely statistics mathematical simulation / prediction / model sense find myriad factors impacting overall number directions. examples likely drivers:
++++ Covid related symptoms
+ Delayed diagnosis likely treatable diseases severe outcomes (e.g. diabetes, certain treatable cancers, others)
0 Delayed diagnosis less treatable diseases (e.g. low survivability cancers)
- Reduced rates complications infectious disease (e.g. flu)
- Reduced rates injury related deaths due decreased driving, commuting, work activities, etc. 

It's important look mathematical model appreciate complexity totality. look preventable disease severe outcomes, also probability baseline people taking steps get early diagnosis without covid additional inhibitor. example would expect people low grade health insurance would equally unlikely get early detection. One could actually test, might get better detection symptom overlap covid diseases leading available medical resources awareness (e.g. lung cancer), although would equally interesting test earlier detection would lead better treatment outcomes given non-covid inhibitors. 

Finally, truly inquisitive, interesting question I'm thinking space: mental health impact covid affect overall population health, etc. example, people working home spending time family, positive impact mental health, development children, closeness family, etc. time, layoffs, changes, children school home, spouses roommates working one space could induce stress. could add factors here. find time might dig bit.

Sure, say COVID directly cause damage hands, hospital months otherwise. UPDATE: received placebo.

That said, idea long social distancing mask usage go function many people sick first foremost, release date vaccine. Humans human tendencies evolve slowly.

COVID-19 denialism like Spanish Flu denialism. easily draw parallels irrationality human nature. simply never learn. shit again. Meanwhile, school district North Dakota sent email last night basically said, ‚ÄúWe know said we‚Äôd go all-remote learning county reached red status, county reached red status, but‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre going go all-remote yet would disruptive.‚Äù came say exact same. look failure, texas responsible thing.

no one fking travelling right (for leisure -- can't avoid due visa issues, etc) ^^ guy - ‚ÄúIm openly well enforced two-to-four-week long lockdown drastically reduce cases likely put COVID behind us least long while, returning us normal, far prefer economy putter along severely crippled killing elderly vulnerable instead‚Äù understand flu decades research. comparing understanding COVID &amp; long term effects understanding flu?

If so, that's foolish decision. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve saying getting downvoted for. optimistic situation, get vaccine that‚Äôs 70% effective 50% population gets full protection vaccine. That‚Äôs leaves 35% population immune that‚Äôs enough prevent community spread herd immunity. 

This going last years become endemic. sooner accept stop pretending it‚Äôll magically go away next fall, sooner actually beat virus point tracked, traced, outbreaks isolated. shut up, Dr. Billy remember saying year's ago reply: economy!!!! Remindme! 90 days Pls show source backs up, need assumptions. That‚Äôs true sure.

Where disagree time part. 

I‚Äôve said sub believe 100,000 deaths/year probably around mark people US comfortable. Could less. also don‚Äôt think long-term effects, unless HIGHLY likely, going move needle risk tolerance much full reopening.

I think that, robust immune response trials shown, there‚Äôs solid chance one vaccines has, say, 60% effective rate 40% still actually get it, would less severe bodies well-equipped mount quicker immune response... words, won‚Äôt ‚Äúnovel‚Äù anymore vaccinated.

Couple fact CFR (not IFR) seems dropped significantly since early days decent treatment opens knowledge.

With mind, suspect see, within couple months vaccinating vulnerable, big drop deaths group. Since really group getting outside average person‚Äôs risk tolerance, paint clear picture pretty quickly time reassess big way.

My biggest concern honest discussion happening. hope election political vitriol fades away extent real stuff like discussed planned. think Covid trial would performed unfit person underliing health conditions?  swear god shithead end behind bars statement study ""X sniffing dogs"" course decades proven pop culture belief dogs sort magic smelling creatures reliably give accurate results completely false. 

No link study? call bullshit. Couldn‚Äôt truth, simple look graph would explain you.

Lockdowns put place reduce totally control spread worked wonderfully. initial lockdown, cases deaths would stopped like did. Vaccine may never come too. vaccine HIV? 40 years already zero incentive today produce SARS vaccine. one, hand... want wear one, cool. cannot force people wear one covid becomes endemic. selfish. Wear mask, helps, look mirror wearing it.... long vampire, Dude, come man. Personally attacking trying understand people thinking trying cope counter productive best. 

The countries implemented harsh lockdowns things like tiny homogenous populations, also easily isolate rest world like NZ, places like China manipulating data decades, numbers trustworthy...

For long many people treated science like religion scientists know everything best get solution. need realize accept many disagree constantly changing. cannot win argument say ""Your stupid, look science.""  Hey honestly, maybe right, truth neither us know. year long time. 5 months longer us already dealing this. one knows October 2021 look like.

I'm optimistic time vaccine widely available, enough people take effective enough keep infection rate going control. slowly declining infection rate (which continues decline people get vaccinated virus less hosts) likely best possible outcome. going see masks distancing slowly removed everyday life somewhere along timeframe, mid-2021, regardless experts say.

Now, results people infected, sure, naught. people still go work &amp; grocery store, rely community selfish &amp; ignorant. 40% U.S. wear mask, inside out.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah hope that's case too. Edited due seeing info another article stating cause death Covid complications

I can't know one worse aren‚Äôt data.

Yes are. statistically insignificant amount data, data same.

EDIT: immediate downvote shows taken Statistics &amp; Probability yet. right choose party think choice... ? understand also true.

Research since shown mink transmitted virus literally depressing really should. banter aside. get stuck rut. type 1 diabetes same. aren‚Äôt entirely sure causes it. Usually people develop post infectious type 1 diabetes display risk factors prior infection event. What‚Äôs troubling non-negligible population healthy people disposition diabetes developing type 1 blue Covid infection. 

That‚Äôs something haven‚Äôt really seen before. one hand, learning important information wrt diabetes mechanism causes manifest. hand, healthy people developing lifelong debilitating disease. confirmed person given PLACEBO VACCINE.  Cool. Here‚Äôs academic article showing exactly saying: Korea also adequately tamped caseload (still running 50-100 per day) actually remove restrictions like they‚Äôre doing. They‚Äôre almost certainly going another spike like August locked mid-December. Similarly virtually one killed thrown windshield. Seat belts useless encroach freeeeduhm Coming soon AITA: ‚ÄúWalked restaurant without mask completely kind respectful staff physically assaulted even though I‚Äôm regular. AITA?‚Äù two three cases serious side effects currently tested vaccines means 2 unlikely. Stupidity arrogance half American public also time high. Yeah, fuck old cat! implications cross-species spread! hot take necessarily, they're trying keep people employed alternative getting thrown street government give two shits either.

There zero reason 100% open say exactly many cases Disneyworld truly new report Daily Beast suggests Disney World underreporting COVID-19 cases perhaps read article.

We might get vaccine that's 50% effective. That's within bounds licensed. that's well short 70% needed herd immunity, even *everyone* gets it. vaccinated people might turn asymptomatic carriers instead.

I wonder multiple vaccines would multiplicative. Would 2 barely adequate ones add 75% effectiveness? makes sense. point really don‚Äôt know IFR beginning since probably missed 90-95% cases. 

WHO estimated 10% world‚Äôs population infected. That‚Äôs like 760 million actual cases. 1 million deaths, say 2 million missed 50% deaths, seeing 0.7% IFR, much, much lower. 

So, think it‚Äôs way early say substantially lowered IFR therapeutics. CFR lowered might increased testing. dont get choose piece ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù quote literally says union leaders said cases minimal....if numerous employees infected union officials would blast infected wavepool. vastly better nothing vastly better companies. 

They deserve thanked this.

They still need permanently raise wages.

They still need offer ***real*** paid sick vacation time. Thank caring compassionate. need people like you. Unfair! Witch hunt! hoax! know!

If Trump admin spent energy wasted denial try fix catastrophe we'd different conversation. Simply listening fucking science fuck sake.

Plus Trump would credit would increased chances re-election 10-fold. federal government forgotten happening. military base work still closed. Hmmmm. right really strange way writing really undercuts message significant effect is. 

I want note study problematic people presenting hospitals demographically different hard control adjusted mortality. also possible recent covid patients presenting hospital less severe, begin with, recognize serious illness might good idea stay home manage it. man. plan. Coronavirus. outside. countries shut non essential retail bars?

If countries 14 countries worse stats. Oppression always starts minor restrictions, thats communists do. Look Venezuela, China Sweden. First ""wear mask"", know starving death. thing I'm looking forward year coming sub weird wasteland last stage four stages strategy. one problem people point mask? People think okay social distancing mask.

You big family parties - without mask. Disney declined say many Disney World employees tested positive coronavirus since resort reopened July. phone interviews, union leaders said cases minimal. 

Press X doubt lmfao Well American state, run Americans, so...  2 billion people planet 100 years ago probably made china. they're because...? Lol government 8 months get shit together are. Exactly. would understand keeping masks recommended mandatory months vaccine gets general population, keeping restrictions realistic.


People trouble accepting current resstrictions, &amp; one year lives disrupted, i‚Äôm trouble seeing anyone accepting measures kept plae, honestly don‚Äôt blame them.

It cannot go ‚Äúflattening curve‚Äù ‚Äúmasks &amp; social distancing years‚Äù don‚Äôt know much father, you‚Äôve told, sounds like might pleasant. sounds like superintendent logic teacher logic. proof whatsoever claim here? America needs lock too

Hope Biden locks country 2-3 months would lied said symptoms. It‚Äôs worth risk. Super sad disagree, think they'll large increases. simple small fine every time caught without one. Nation wide. Like 100$ so. 99% people get message quickly enough. police love chance rake cash. sit em inside grocery store they'll collect thousands dollars fines day.

A portion proceeds could even go towards relief lost jobs this. guess would make much sense. Back beginning this, maybe enough masks go around messaging unclear harsh measure would awful, point valid excuses remain government needs stop molly coddling idiots. seem functioning Florida fine job Hospitalization bankruptcy ~90% Americans.

Just die, mean suffer long - that's taking account long term side effects virus itself.

It's good news less people dying. Completely agree. suffering living live eased.

Source: worked healthcare billing, many people wish they'd died seeing bills even routine hospitalizations. Sorry point making?

Also, say media hyping numbers general. I'm saying particular article seems sus. ""Highest numbers since August"" mean much own. Australia screwed big time. proven responsibly reopen, science-based health safety protocols strictly enforced theme park properties around world,‚Äù said Disneyland Resort president Ken Potrock.

Press X doubt

&amp;#x200B;

anyway guys lay thousands people stock went up? say ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù problem death penalty let‚Äôs recall gavin newsom opening disneyland! average American live expectancy 78.5 years according quick Google search doubt it. That's make managing successful restaurant kitchen, I'm apply Target near fuk going new thing sub now---literally every single day upvoting post ""reinfection"" title top. ONE story WA 2 separate posts 500+ upvotes. say serious, becoming worst-case scenario circlejerk literally obfuscation fact give anyone anything did. Point blank.


People like believe sometimes damaging; constantly allowing perfect enemy good. must hard you. Another thing understood 15 minutes mean successive. 3 minutes here, 2 minutes there....6 minutes 4 minutes here....

15 minutes. think median 18 days symptoms death. fewer people dying due better understanding treatment options doesn‚Äôt mean hospitals can‚Äôt overwhelmed keeping patients alive.

The dying probably easiest deal with. amazing, looked article. Thanks that. measures taken prevent spread worse damage actual disease.  supposed law order party?  Texas statewide mask ordinance. That's something least. Texan. That's literally make managing successful Kitchen restaurant, I'm apply Target near massive effort going flip Texas blue. Small informal gatherings like ?
Granted, agree government can't compensate people stupid. still think could ""pleading"", though. Taking firm stance decisive action help people least take situation little seriously partying. 150,000 people Ireland expected lose jobs lockdown.  Air traffic stopped 9/11.

It done Damn man hope find peace. Keep head up. know said it‚Äôs lifelong never know it‚Äôll get better not. I‚Äôve heard seen weirder shit happen. sleep absolute garbage hate it. feel bad doctors, nurses scientists. People talking shit like joke making conspiricy theory's it. feel like aint gonna get this:( vote science, vote blue. Thats say. Tell it. want in-person experience attending college. Thankfully, I‚Äôve already it, college isn‚Äôt forever want make time school. I‚Äôd like maybe meet girl, make new friends, attend social gatherings sports games, etc. everyone followed proper safety guidelines beginning, would back sooner. Now, I‚Äôm concerned we‚Äôll even get colleges fully opened next summer. Nothing said even remotely invalidates point, Mister high horse shut lot elective procedures meaning less work. like affect young. still heavy symptoms lasting damages like reduced lung functionality real reason people taking seriously. one only, anyone close die. mean mom, dad, spouse, kid covid 19 . may friend friend nothing house. can't stress enough. listen death knocks door. 

For example. neighbor would make fun us using mask taking precautions daily basis. 3 weeks ago father died it, surprise eldest daughter caught see grandpa, nearly died. 2 weeks ventilador. ""made it""... 

Now see poor man wearing mask, gloves face mask even taking trash Wenedsdays. 

I would like say something, I'm sure knows, every time sees look away without saying anything.

He biggest ahole know, guess what, ahole safe covid 19 anymore.

That's think people care. 

We desensitized death far long hits close home whole different story. little 3 then, life distinctly different. Probably fact flew lot parents air travel changed quite bit... think Khans ice ages you‚Äôre attributing Black Death decline population. correlation indicative causation. Covid killed many people would survived flu, flu also around year top Covid. Vulnerable people catch likely doomed. 

Not everyone died would passed flu, Covid deaths US currently several years worth flu deaths least. take excess deaths actual Covid deaths, it‚Äôs nearly decades worth flu deaths. Well 7600 people die every day humans live forever disease always one causes. Trump tipping head


""*Can't get second wave never took care first.*"" Apple pie American. Stop cultural appropriation! /s think people protesting, how.

Peaceful protest type protected bill rights. Looting rioting crimes. 

The ""why"" excuse burn shit kill people. shit mad about, we're back frontier, rules. comfort lies unpleasant truths Yup remember that. going Shall one jam packed game ? keep mind almost older COVID-19 Stock say? Brb buying apple stocks do. ""Two weeks Easter"" ""Two weeks spring breakers gathered"" ""Two weeks July 4th"" ""Two weeks riots"" ...(wait say one, goes media's agenda). move scariest part future far constantly. seriousness Johnson resisting calls national lockdown knows death knell localised economies UK. Another lockdown see high street businesses, restaurants, pubs close good, potentially housing market collapse. first people like ‚ÄúLALALALALA cares x new cases look hospitals death rates LALALALALA CANT HEAR YOU! this. they‚Äôre quiet. This.

It's also why, even though known since February, talk Corona Airborne. precautions take every country admitted would shut schools, would shut works, would shut economies. majority country's population vaccinated, things settle. think unreasonable assume we're going wearing masks keeping social distancing place mass inoculation happens.

If Fauci right - far part, I'm optimistic - we'll (at least industrialized world) beginning summer. live downtown Denver, attest half people pass street wear masks. know many tourists coming redder areas, time someone without mask try get elevator today, building 300+ units sharing elevator. Everyone spent summer playing mountains, avoiding well can. chill fall sets in, children return school, poor habits ramifications. Thank much nurses know WI blowing covid big deal, even mocking me, cases low summer, WI one biggest hotspots. Fucking gg. Small town Canada too. It‚Äôs happening everywhere. School monitor school. Lunch breaks school disaster. hoped people accepted masks ""the new normal"". 

Places opening back up, could go back restaurants, movies showing again, etc. 

Masks mandated I'm at, people saw wearing them. Surrounding areas? much. numbers roof everywhere around us. [Czech country 10 million.

I realize subreddit American, holy shit guys. even check countries statistics claiming worst? u/kentacova u/trenlow12

Why deal hypotheticals look facts? I'll spoonfeed you. Go Texas data click link ""Accessible Dashboard Data"". get excel spreadsheet called CaseCountData. Open Excel. Click tab ""Trends."" call attention particularly bad day: Sept 22 (line 206). 

The ""Total case count"" 17,820 day. new cases day reported 3,964.

A footnote (41.) tells us: 13,622 older cases recently reported labs included statewide total excluded statewide Harris County new confirmed cases 

The media - accuse hyping numbers - largely silent this. Hey, reads footnotes, right? handy bar graphs - look Sept 22, they're reporting 3964 number. New cases day, right? 

If one-time correction, know, get caught curly cases, know, ones dog ate, maybe could accept it. nah, happens every day. Can‚Äôt speak everyone, obviously, work majority colleagues fully belief flu used propaganda machine assert control lives. includes colleagues symptoms covid, tested positive virus. Yep. Whatever conspiracy name I‚Äôve heard it... sad regrettable many places seemingly prioritized utterly non-essential business (like bars) children's educations. like schools afterthought reopening plans risk allocation process. think kids today *already* existential dread see world planet via internet? place quarantine? There‚Äôs medication really except treat symptoms.
For fever, take Tylenol (acetaminophen). cough, local cough medicine. Drink lots fluids, hang there. Wishing best luck! Sorry report last 6 weeks, masks slipping chins, people forgetting socially distance stores (try halloween store see lol) I've seen house parties breaking out. West coast increasing cases Coronavirus response mostly fallen remit devolved governments. Westminster may made mistakes, notable infection rate higher NI England, Scotland Wales parents establishing extended bubbles hiring proctor/caregiver. eight kids. Contact time student performance up. Perhaps could scaled. 

Grandparents extended family providing supervision. 

I'm sure solutions. likely ""one size fits all."" need menu options believe. 

If one available solution small numbers kids public facilities (like schools) that's fine. 10% kids school building far cry opening school. Good. move coast couple years ago pretty mad cold winters been. bored American news, sound like something done months ago, really really tired hearing crap getting vaccine immune system weak fighting vaccine, immune system learn fight disease vaccine mimicking. That‚Äôs vaccines work extreme laymen‚Äôs terms. RIP young jamie, sacrificed virgin lungs Joe could call people wear masks ‚Äúpussies‚Äù Told so. really expected end day vaccine deluding themselves.

We stop wondering ""when go back normal"". Instead, start thinking ""how live inevitable changes society - new normal?"" don‚Äôt data yet know efficacy vaccine that‚Äôs 50% effective, example, would also prevent severe cases. 50% effective vaccine made covid common cold, would meaningful far returning normal. Unfortunately people care logic science behind it. seem think govt oppressing mandatory mask public areas like mall takes away freedom. Yet bs coming anti mask people deemed fake untrue. Lmaoooo Idk man think small percentage people. Judging decorations (or lack thereof) previous years, Halloween dying anyway, immigrant families follow (nothing wrong that, stating fact) school district (who usually absolutely love!) positive students/staff keeps oh proud ""close contacts"" need quarantine. They're considering person close contact within 6 feet 15 minutes. Since according school district one ever supposed get within 6 feet 15 minutes, magically never close contacts! incompetence deliberate malicious? Gotta pump numbers up. rookie numbers. like picture 3 ATMs close together people standing far apart 3 lines, lines close other. like... virus move sideways ya'll haven‚Äôt, used opinion based sources baseless claimed lmao. think downplaying would massive effect.

Imagine Trump taken seriously beginning asked everyone instead repeatedly saying disappear.

If Trump gone TV said ""This serious, beat work together,"" could led US crisis.

Instead, downplayed heckled sidelines. Biden propose follow strategy. *b-but caravans! they're bringing caravans across border, they're full - uhh, drug cartel! ... MS-13! scary!* Agreed... that‚Äôs hope I‚Äôm clinging to, get next months. What‚Äôs one metric matters said done? Use brain please. easier said done, country 330mil. Even best case scenario, find proposal unrealistic given culture history (role govt). don‚Äôt disagree wish happened way, it‚Äôs inconceivable US. 

I think federal govt tried that, would mass riots, perhaps even secession dozen states. would take amusement that? That‚Äôs sociopathic. BEST COVID! people got better?

I agree complete failure. No, bunch brigadiers lockdown skeptics subs participate daily post. go onlineee!!! Europe still 2 years average age BMI die. get blasted, WRONG, vital information. Agreed, sub runs like media enjoys fear-mongering much. would nice see actual numbers start coming percentage people get Covid-19 end long-term symptoms outright died. course, skewed, idea would nice. What‚Äôs crazy believing paradigm infinite growth? Seems pretty responsible me. Tell anti maskers optimizing daycare, I've heard many reports California many students end school buildings daycare, conduct online school. cases, student may ""school"" building normal! 

Is acceptable? so, makes okay in-person school not? not, instead? Oh kurwa it‚Äôs obligatory ? lol think CDC ever look long-term Lyme infections seriously believed even existed, we'd way information certain acute diseases seem like go away month turn extended things changing syndromes years. 

A doctor almost sure POTS (I refused go testing solid diagnosis). none issues Lyme Disease badly 5 years. really think we'd know things develop, horrible CDC actually listened patients. know care Covid-19 patients called us suffering THINGS Lyme bunch malingering liars. CALL J. G. WENTWORTH - 877-CASH-NOW!!!!

What successful commercial. Ugh same. even 3 coworkers :/ live America, mid-south, people truly believe Covid disappear soon election over. hard keep up. bad think, people travelking grouping nearly much 1920 stock up. Why? mean plan identical trump done?

Oh sorry one additional strategy, ask people pretty please wear masks. election getting closer every day. Im actually upset cat human victims. care people, leave kitty alone :( key stop giving big businesses money want stop type behavior Where‚Äôs concern homeless living city?

I'm politically active movements free universal public housing. Lol Texas happening  won‚Äôt say Crore? And, get let go stating comfortable company following mandate, department labor accept complaint longer work company. joke. 

So companies get away murder long longer employed continue hiring on, department labor accept complaints unless ""forced"" continue work company. ""Yes, hi, infection expired demand new one"" think people find ""7 time larger"" much easier visualize understand intuitively 85.7% reduction.  wanna know thinks U.S. government organized worldwide conspiracy efficiently can't even fucking organize stimulus check correctly (I never received mine, I'm alone). Normal-ish? Fortunately live (a city Canada), like cases (4 5 think), I‚Äôm still planning taking daughter out. However, situation much worse - become drastically worse, we‚Äôll figure something home. 

My city whole seems same.  We're still dealing people think ""every death reported COVID"" person COVID.

IF DIED WITHOUT IT, COVID DEATH. bet do. probably also want get paid Like.. complete lockdown? still soft compared Israel did... new plateaus increases. tired winning. worry mate crazy, subreddit compromised CCP. discount obvious stuff existed virtue president. Helicopter, limo ride, secret service, already there.

But private hotel room, private doctors, round clock infectious disease monitoring, that's stuff we'd pay Aka coworkers. agree. I'm 170's, 5'4 female, one would ever call overweight...I slim slender long, legs slim look like tree branches photos, stomach quite large midsection still look anywhere near actual fat people. actually gained much weight 3 years anorexia 99lbs (from drug addiction), welcome change. looked like skeleton weight. Pretty much, Americans claim care much others wearing piece paper cloth faces wonder I'm incredulous. I've seen many behaviors past 6 months show otherwise. Nobody country cares anybody else except Bernie followers still floating around. Agreed, changing one's culture neither essy quick, may something do. employees complaining $200 going change lives ones talked mad garbage us got let go permanently jobs far better retail got extra money. Nothing jealousy misery people. Well, least countries' leaders example point one citizens say overdid pandemic control efforts.

USA No. 1. He's really hot I'm facepalming another dimension right Even lower 48, seems disproportionate impact Native communities, many reasons mentioned. would nice federal government finally take treaty obligations seriously, especially healthcare provisions. guess Im pessimist lol Turns Goebbels right along Simple answer - elections Oct 2-3, govt boasting best second lockdown would never come again, would look silly voters. I‚Äôm actually curious think answer changing culture need pile every instance possible. I'm kidding. really hard understand Asian countries blowing back Spain is? Spain full touchy-feely people, Asian countries not, U.S. full narcissistic snobs respect personal space. That's really it. majority people survive, don‚Äôt hear doesn‚Äôt make good headline. Instinct

Doesn‚Äôt mean think means votes surprising well, thought generally accepted fentanyl America created shipped China. fact synthetic research chemicals find America synthesized China. Sure Pharmaceutical companies families like Sacklers pushed oxycodone onto Americans pain management much addiction fentanyl largely produced supplied Americans China. Masks never normal thing spreads easily. dinner dad night tells doesn‚Äôt go anywhere wants see me. get call next day gone church week earlier outbreak happening tested positive. I‚Äôm two week quarantine waiting symptoms. 

The lesson learned don‚Äôt trust anyone, even parents. anything, Demonrats thanking brave people Spain Belgium sacrificed lives influence US election. kids skip school in-person? 

There kinds relevant tech - presence detection, attention tracking, interaction. ""Lost students"" far unique remote learning. 

Remember many school districts last Spring said one would grade lowered due remote learning. Way motivate. 

We focused optimizing remote learning since last March. Lost opportunity. Essential workers different everyone going holidays well cloth masks got bored stopped wearing them. I've problem masks forever, minor inconvenience.

Social distancing continuing however would nightmare. Absolute nonsense. know top hermatologist region UK believes immunity lasts several years cases. 

I'm still antibody positive 7.5 months.

Now 2 anecdotal cases cancel yours. tricky though - ignorance one's limitations absolutely necessary opening new frontiers field. backfire, sometimes badly. Congratulations makes genius then. Dawg chill lil kids talk smack stuff shouldn‚Äôt time. Name calling like isn‚Äôt bad unless it‚Äôs constant thing that‚Äôs they‚Äôll absorb name Inhale chochy Confirmed cases India pretty useless considering large % population homeless lives rat infested slums. There‚Äôs testing going there. Wow someone insomnia last fifteen years, sounds scary. I‚Äôm totally different person get needed eight hours. I‚Äôve insomnia bad finally getting decent nights sleep would feeling literally euphoric next day. uncle narcolepsy bad apnea, several operations clear nasal passages. Ok, dumb then. Would easier answer that. both?  official ones ones proven. 

It's possible someone strain detect it. 

From tell, count ""proof"" trackers sort thing (though agree - I'd count it, personally). ""It is"" understand point, saying 100% people followed 100% (contradictory) rules 100% time, everything would alright.

But that's incredibly naive take face, purely speculative boot, can't afford kind stupidity dealing policy affecting people planet worrying part data sourced rates hospitalization ICU admissions *grown 25% 15%* 9/30 10/13. 

So they're definitely good trajectory all. They're currently around 85% capacity. They're going run issues quite soon pace. coworker pulled mask down, went boss' small office sneezed right room, walked back out. boss watching. asked he's retarded replied ""what? can't sneeze mask"" point nobody going change mind unless personally affected. shithole country. Bad choice words part. R0 SARS-COV-19 SARS-1, big difference contagious symptomatic symptoms visible. 1400 1600 deaths 60+. Nearly 60% deaths countrywide nursing homes.

It absolutely discriminates based age. Wisconsin essentially alcoholic culture. 

I remember opening local paper moving away, full ads drinking cheap bars. made feel sick stomach. 

I like drink two then, lifestyle drink, drink, drink more.  don‚Äôt know people deny science even hits straight face. cult like ideology, I‚Äôd love hear psychologists take it. don‚Äôt understand. Yup. teach community college entire winter break spent sending job applications fields education interesting first small business owner I've spoken favor aggressive lockdown. Would willing sacrifice small business lockdown? thought joke

This lie tell excuse selfishness willful ignorance. necessarily. they're asymptomatic second time around, example, may never even know.

The bias always going we're going notice worse illnesses. Also, rule relapses post viral syndromes reinfections, makes trickier navigate. amazes happening NY NJ, yet one learned them? Nope one. many extra suicides think are, source basing on? Nah, they're imitating Trump. Trump hospital three days, enough everyone get better stop contagious, right?

&amp;#x200B;

So glad president setting good example nation. God can't wait loses election. Yup, people want ""freedom"" semblance normal life, full compliance wearing masks basic social distancing best way ensure it.

Otherwise we'll choice hard-lockdown inevitably spirals control causes thousands thousands deaths every single day.

Why hard people understand?

Hard-lockdown enact huge socioeconomic toll society. I'd like avoid again. take basic precautions seriously, may able to. young people contact old people.

Gee...how about, know, encouraging young people socialize young people? local schools businesses still open 100% school buildings closed januaryish. open depends kn location. Fauci speaking nation -not local area.

And open, mean great idea. clearly even trying understand point, I'll leave then. Sorry, maybe took 30 days 1800s 5 days early 1900s, idk. think also depended ship. understanding Titanic relatively new. someone lives WI, tell right now... Outside Milwaukee Madison (and couple random places) nobody state gives fuck COVID. fucking state legislature session since April yet they've sued governor twice attempts something. US don‚Äôt settle anything less number 1!

USA!

s\ curiosity, this? Iowa? South Dakota?  think closing elementary school, pubs, gyms, hair dressers, libraries borders.

You realize closing public utilities strictest form enforcing social distancing guidelines nationwide, right? prevents reasons list becoming vectors? turned around lol. I‚Äôm one saying shouldn‚Äôt free Covid restrictions like don‚Äôt free driving. Don‚Äôt put words mouth. Yeah. Seems bit spurious compare modern masks available 1919. Multiple layered/N95 masks versus... prettymuch handkerchief? probably yearly corona vaccinations risk groups like flu mutates fast. Agree completely. literally can't leave homes except food medicines. jobs somehow created? I'm confused answer. assume less jobs less ppl working seems case lockdown countries. 

Isn't socialist country? poor taken care of? Huh. notice didn‚Äôt report weekend, maybe 4.5k backlog. sure hope so. Considering it‚Äôs Tuesday, I‚Äôd rather break 5k week. we‚Äôve nearly doubling week, dunno. internet back then, would loved get #1918 memes.

What fucked year was. COVID would 3rd worst pandemic year!!!! hope god, ever might judges ass hole end! honestly shocking anyone, point time, fully expected 'go away'. 

The flu around every year live it. manage it. vaccinate it. treat it. go lives. will, eventually, different. put dash optimism. HIV far deadlier tricky virus least managed tame antiviral cocktail right may track develop treatment could eliminate entirely. Granted decades research coming head commitment COVID dwarfs efforts immediately. don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôll something render virus nuisance worst.

As vaccines it‚Äôs understand HPV virus reinfects well. vaccine eventually made ended making focused specific part virus combat used duck immune system. current batch vaccines may magic bullet marginally effective know next generation may game changer.

I‚Äôm afraid virus long term. Scientific innovation succeed. I‚Äôm afraid immediate future countless end dying don‚Äôt to. case Ebola killing host, considered eradicated (until wasn't) we're worried catching Ebola, today. Wut. subreddit? Actually stay away, plenty infecting already Heart disease could covid could waiting long go hospital fear virus. years tease out. 

The cancer deaths state governments though. don‚Äôt know thought cancer treatments weren‚Äôt essential, never denied people appointments treatment. original point everyone staying home people go could safely. 

I get chemo kills immune system fear could die Covid definitely cancer might get covid seems like treat one have. feel ya. im home health aide, albeit slightly apart healthcare system.. dont interact general public way.. one one care. id scared did. shit idk would stay job. one patients showing covid symptoms patient take test also dont show feel risk. dont mind working patient suspected covid though. bc dont show .. go without care isnt fair families all. imo taking care sick people possibility around contagious disease job.. signed for. said about
one one.. general public would hard time self sacrificing way think I'd see intersection r/transhumanism &amp; r/Coronavirus! woot things there? Saw supposedly worse first wave? Erekat already accused Israel spreading virus amongst Palestinians. sick mindset. realize God knows everything say, think even write Social media. cannot hide him. paper predictive. Instead, Shaman Galanti identify key factors determining trajectory COVID-19, namely, likelihood reinfection, effectiveness vaccine, seasonality virus, whether significant numbers people contract COVID-19 along another virus like influenza. learn React first I'm sure even vanilla JS would make much sense you. someone help I‚Äôm confused. Fauci said days ago enough vaccines everyone April 2021, likely meaning everyone wants vaccinated May 2021. read article states vaccines BEGIN middle 2021? don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm reading articles wrong I‚Äôm missing something. someone clear me? Ok? And? Even safeguards place, driving STILL kills 40,000+ year. banned cars outright, think lives would save. ok 40,000 people dying year preventable death? No.

- National contact tracing core
- Centralized PPE management
- National masking
- Snap expanded food insecurity
- apparatchiks rewriting CDC guidance
- Essential worker overtime
- calling leading scientists disasters idiots

The similarities testing distribution vaccine distribution. economic stuff overlaps congressional proposals Trump's plans targeted checks, business loans extended unemployment. Also, payroll tax cut. It‚Äôs vaccine bust However, still push idea: ""Live Free Die"". Why? Well much better ""tots pears""  ""burn out"". controlled snuffed things like strict quarantines contact tracing. 

We got rid kinds measures. 

It spread easily COVID, helped. Queensland spectacularly. Thanks. haven‚Äôt seen 2nd 3rd wave. 1918 flu far deadly, life back normal less 2 years. People going stay inside, vaccine not. Smoking doesn‚Äôt put others risk genius.

Yes does.. second hand smoking thing. wisconsin fuckton backlogged tests they've reporting due software update something? even close saying things ok they're certainly 4.5k rolling average Yeah, 40% US obese.  communal spaces walking private spaces. Say car, garage apartment. worst happens help calm someone else's anxiety. many morons. Fuuuck  I'm honestly surprised proposed actual policy sooner. can't normal, least create next best thing: appearance normal. Orwellian...

And hey, could actually real psychological benefits - start noticing people around getting sick. **you** get sick. Deaths obesity related diseases FAAAR exceed COVID-19 related deaths. we're attempting save money health related negligence suggestion even relevant fruitful denying anti-maskers. concerned children's safety advise heed original advice stay FUCK home. convinient. Ok pictures outside emergency room? hospital ships called in? carparks? good PR, maybe retailers follow suit result Ok got me. enjoy herd immunity folks though seem get evolution happen single generation. People get survive may still slew nasty lingering effects. suck us, kids, likely many generations eventually (and medicines continuously hamper progress) weaker genomes flushed existence. 

The simple fact medical intervention leads believe we'll continue pass weaker folk either way. got make long enough breed pretty low bar day age advanced medicine. Yeah ton laws related driving - like must license. must obey speed limit. drive lanes. insurance. list goes on. safeguards place. It‚Äôs free all. Walker Diane Hendricks* fucked state. Right work killed teachers. agree value reinfection information less rigorous. strict, proven criteria course massive undercount info helps us understand scale extent, even still pretty nebulous.  article like come weeks ago saying cases bad since July? going compare 2nd wave different months last year definitely know strain circulating, testing ramped significantly. highly unlikely strain go long time undetected. they‚Äôre afraid 40k cases 1k deaths freaking day. Maybe fixed mess it‚Äôd safer go we‚Äôd spend lot money. remind 1 week agree US horrible response, also think still good news (taking stats face value, 3 times less likely die!). could never imagine seeing front subreddit, though ""card"" reality. Please explain factor. honestly insane shutdoen this. Seems like people getting worse disease 2nd time? reading right?  Ooooooh, spooooooky. psychopath wanting continue life 9 months government jack shit combat issue.

But make uncaring, selfish filth lacks empathy towards people around you. long *you're* OK care happens anyone else. go day thinking nothing bad ever happen end hospital, looked nurses doctors risk lives health save likes done nothing help anyone else. still change. People like never do. Imagine Israeli ‚Äúgenocidal maniacs‚Äù feel trying save biggest enemies life. Hopefully PLO opportunity blame murder doesn‚Äôt survive. /s ehhh, lucky covid huge diareahhea component. least Tp ok. 

In early days, stocked things would help flu, covid turned tad differently. Thats ""soft"", thats enabling dangerous situation. I'm sorry happen, former boss sucks. parents want family gathering grandparents‚Äô house dads entire side family. They‚Äôre insane. can't prove re-infection extremely narrow definition we're discussing here. utility definition lies establishing possible learn virus behaves. months ahead, people report second bout illness, rigorous definition might become less useful. proof pudding. realistic target probably lower number hospitalizations average flu season. guessing we'll hit target sometime around mid April. I‚Äôm sure numbers reliable r/mildlyinfuriating

Right? horrible. Honestly people saying things like ""get it, wars worse, etc."" speak personal experience social isolation, least tiny dorm friends little family support, personal hell. 

I feel years' freshman; tough. We'll get this, history condescending struggle (especially) deal with. much easier already friends, already work life, already partner family, big house isolate in... Freshman usually that. nah, people lost fear, tired situation. work bar, first days since reopened kinda calm, customers started act like normal. 

i would say that, wasn¬¥t masks prohibition enter places, situation would normal (but 15% poverty, unemployment, crimes, government monkeys) Democrats lost two elections past 20 years, can‚Äôt imagine would much political opposition across aisle It‚Äôs endemic. virus stay. sorry. could easy would small ""sacrifice"" mask wearer. amazing people still care. ... headline read, ""Selfish Assholes Making Sure Wear Masks, Social Distancing Likely 2022, Fauci Tells PA Doctors."" I'm keen comparing war deaths disease deaths anyway. comparing war deaths one country (Vietnam) disease deaths another (USA) vaguely justifiable.

Comparing war deaths based nationality disease deaths based geography definitely unreasonable. birthday Halloween, :( almost every kid get Chickenpox vaccine? remember it.

That's really shitty herd immunity... Herd immunity works 70% population immune. sure 70% Sweden COVID yet; say want herd immunity, congratulations! killed 8 million people!

Source: ever would hypothetically shot everyone without mask? Dear god economic misery alone would probably outweigh potential risks virus. hypothesized month ago met ridicule downvotes.

Firstly, doubt ever hit herd immunity. never hit herd immunity diseases humans living hundreds thousands years vaccines.

but importantly, would bet money Covid-19 2-4 year immunity. SARS immunity lasts 3 years. SARS type viruses also immunity 2-4 years.

There already multiple strains Covid-19 people infected multiple time.

Covid-19 seems mutate pretty rapidly reinfect us easily, makes hypothesize... HUGE HYPOTHESIS: surprised eventual vaccine Covid-19 ends something akin flu vaccine. take year ever 2 3 4 years, 50%-80% effectiveness depending strain Covid-19 coming year.

Welcome new reality. Covid-19 9-11. happen stop. Covid-19 reality.

Herd immunity pipe dream promoted people trying ""sell  RemindMe! 1 week suppress certainly reduce deaths successful vaccine arrives.

So like said, patently false. vaccine though. article we're discussing points out, treatments gotten better get even better. better catching virus 6 months ago. better catching virus 6 months doesn‚Äôt happen many years?

There dozens vaccines works. One likely effective enough prevent many many deaths. focus hypothetical almost chance true? However, even turn way, least we'd know gave best shot, course far, least country. BFD? Seward here. mask mandate here.

Yes, miserable af kinda fixed problem. gotta look US see couldve been... started ad campaigns? new one? state aus still tv/radio/shopping centre ad campaigns going we've covid free 5\~ months aside international imported cases like 20\~ past 4 months sure that‚Äôs disease control works though. case we‚Äôd dead Spanish flue Black Death since ‚ÄúAll numbers go higher that‚Äôs counting works.‚Äù Americas.

Not universally, keyword ""early"". Nowhere contradict course leg stand Sweden declared lockdown Uppsala.

You mean like entire rest country? One segment giving emotionally driven dribble violating basic human rights people argument Giesecke said early neighboring countries, ""wait year see"". 8 months now, nobody even close catching up. Nobody seriously believe catch up. Sweden failed completely lazy right thing.

What data even looking at? Sweden's daily fatalities floor, CFR several western countries. make many assumptions ""analysis"". think US third wave countries lagging behind second wave. Given recent studies viable solution prevent covid ist implement strict system like China.

&amp;#x200B;

China managed reduce contact point time (time betweend person B receives notices person covid-19) 7,5 days 1,5 days. countries ever. contact tracing really on-top everythin. contact someone covid-19 usual receive within 1-2 days message quarantine yourself.

With ther constant screening movements (cameras, smartphones) easy control quarantine move around.

Furthermore, whenever small cluster covid-cases whole district/ city covid-19 test within couple days, mandatory. feasbile soluion prevent mass infection.

Their economy back pre-covid level term travelling production. Looking WW2, USA first country heal devestation start economy back again. head-start important. think living change world power atm. 2020 enter history books time world power shifted China picked speed 1-2 years faster rest world.

Our government everything opposite works: Non-mandatory covid-19 tracing apps nobody uses, Non-manatory tests cities, lock-down stores restaurants people meet inside somebody home far less personal distance. Umm, 200k SUPER low. dead serious say total treatment would likely cost normal American million more.

My MRI brain, contrast, 40k. Lucky me, insurance covered it, jesus.

Many people spend 10-15k broken limb without insurance. 

A helicopter ride meds market, 6 private doctors, 6 room suite? Easily million dollars. insurance would willing cover that. No, get cheaper peasant treatment.

American medicine really absurd. whole system needs reworked ground up, including cost medical education doctors need pay half million student debt. thought basically consensus since multiple countries started outbreaks in... February? January even?

It's worth talking future looks ""may""? American would need 6-8 months preparation lock 6 weeks. isn‚Äôt feasible it‚Äôs pipe dream would biggest gamble American history. mean SMART Sweden actually policy tested positive meet criteria, stop following recommendations see anyone want. problem allow less cohesive population, people deliberately get infected get perks (or lie/fake documentation etc). immunity passport idea never took logistics reasons, scientific ones. Based exactly? 

Speaking manager, course.

Excuse Mr. CoronaVirus, need speak manager. probably will, Biden might actually react something  +1 comment. I‚Äôm UK it‚Äôs same, people information fatigue, people couldn‚Äôt give shit. friend lives Belgium says it‚Äôs terrible - small country, something like 8k cases yesterday. People tired it. get but... come guys. live Minnesota. 1,000 people dying day (although that's stated climb).

Yay! Thank actually answering question. suprised? going much higjer next weeks. see peak cases take rund six weeks get peak hospitalizations mean really bad cases. sad president *on steroids* still makes fun virus says scary bad media showed before. mass murderer discriminating Swedes? Oh god  depends country, enforce without giving shit complains like China did, works well Morpheus, you? depends entirely amount resources devoted it. first groups get vaccinated institution, i.e. healthcare workers, nursing home residents, enough staff deployed (most hospitals travelling carts flu season vaccination) groups vaccinated inside 1-2 weeks. elderly living community need access pharmacies, line ups reasonable young people allowed vaccination point. would go teachers essential workers, would institution. make statement less true though. Yes yet state live similar population done arguably better. Less cases, stage four restrictions less deaths. Yet zero mention well done. :) like happen? pls wanna explore europe. nasty epitopes antibodies get screened reason. Recently papers reported autoimmune reactivity anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, especially proteins neurons.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well hospital allowing loved ones send people home die family. Yes, understand. Total confirmed cases pretty pointless though become endemic, would least able develop vaccines quick enough curb early infections, like flu, would rely anti-virals isolation infected?

Either way, that's grim possibility. Hopefully happen, point knows. long one catching it. I'm sorry. wish well. live Victoria. think elimination lockdown good idea, idea. 8 weeks??? We're almost 6 months, chance eliminating stupid virus. virus going anywhere.

I hope think twice propagating elimination lock beliefs. words prepare social, economic psychological destruction lockdown committed eradicating virus bring country. Every pandemic one. Yeah, 3 studies said winter might see increase covid (not sure reliable. Wonder US seems lag 2-3 weeks behind Europe pandemic? like earlier year too, Europe sharply rising 2 weeks US did, trump banging great US comparison.

You'd think second wave would started climbing time.  Well would suck. find 2nd sequence, strain appeared person infected first time. worry that. World smoldering crater get pandemic control then. Even reasonable people much mental stamina put shit.  still debating whether masks work?

People still debating whether Earth round...smh Thanks that. We'll bounce back, get side first. Every week something would biggest scandal american history literally even 10 years ago friends got pool going many days reconvene. 365 days seems wild boys? False. COVID fucked us. harder shorter lockdown would smaller cost impact larger benefit. government could given people direct financial relief occurred Canada elsewhere. also built virtually testing tracing infrastructure, huge advantage time delay. Antibiotics would drastically lowered Spanish Flu deaths since often secondary bacterial infections killed people. Sometimes hard tell post whether meant sarcastic not... I'll choose believe former!!  also killed many people time knowledge viruses causing illness. antibiotics help prevent deadly secondary Pneumonia. antivirals medications prevent runaway immune responses like Cytokine Storm.

Yeah, get COVID 50, vary rare need treatment things order survive. Something like 1 300 50 year olds, something like 1 10,000 people also data show many people actually virus vs many people hospitalized killed it.

You're lost cause point. way matters believe 1918 virus believed killed 2 every 100 people planet actually killed 1 every 500 people planet. That's definitely possibility, every person who's studied pandemic dismissed possibility. likely person world believes comparing raw numbers era provides us number hospitalized amount dead, ignoring lack data era would show many people would mildly ill completely asymptomatic exist.

You've got backwards. using raw data deaths shows absolute lowest possible IFR virus, assume everybody world contracted 2% people world died, means 2% IFR, significantly higher IFR COVID unless 70. reality, something like 1/3 population likely caught virus killed 2% population, meaning IFR probably closer 6% vs .6% estimate worst case scenario IFR also ignoring fact none technologies medications keep many dying virus today exist back then.

Also ignoring that. relevant developed economies elderly though. factor would drive COVID mortality, significant enough one would drive anything close 10 fold, especially considering demographic shift 100 years ago. indications IFR would much lower virus broke 1918, main reason severe outbreak 2020 high percentage 70+ demographic represents today's western question giving 2 cents start thread Covid happened then, treatments methods testing, ICU beds ventilators all. factors looked into, id still wager replaced 1918 H1N1 2020 Covid 19, would likely severe pandemic,

Sure, get believe that. There's almost chance right though. focusing wrong thing. Age reason people die COVID, technology. demonstrable looking death rates developed countries. losing anywhere near 2% populations, countries younger demographics lower death rates. would fewer people traveling world within countries. People stayed put more. So, closing random roads short term protect people covid don‚Äôt die car crash neighborhood.

Aight Lol last time gave bonus cut everyone‚Äôs hours. Source: work target folks calling Trump Hitler suddenly want dictator. Lol gotta protect chin covid. something like 3-6% initially media know testing starting. Italians calling kinds things pointed real IFR much lower. Experts course pretty close estimations mostly kept quiet first studies came out.

Imho still know exactly, plenty seroprevalence studies afaik include cells range results looks broad. is, greedy child wants cares itself. We're together here. state controls media, outcome want. Using genome sequencing contact tracing. yes, burden proof high documented cases minuscule amount actual reinfections. I‚Äôve read reinfections months science slow recognise document.

The scenario emerging getting reinfected testing positive antibodies. Starting read cases. see science says months.  one study referring performed 2015 using rhinovirus, four times smaller coronavirus, specifically healthcare environment. fact, authors article wrote update advised study apply coronavirus OPTION, HEALTHCARE WORKERS WORK UNPROTECTED CLOTH MASK USED, albeit higher risk infection. higher risk infection cloth masks filter well medical masks respirators.

Let repeat: higher risk infection cloth masks filter well medical masks respirators.

Cloth masks filter well medical masks respirators.

**Cloth masks filter well medical masks respirators.**

Are understanding now? wear respirator, risk infection lowest. wear medical mask, risk infection higher wore respirator.

Can guess going?

If wear cloth mask, risk infection higher respirator medical mask, LOWER someone wearing protection.

Don't fucking idiot, wear god damn mask, stop spreading spoonfed bullshit misinformation. Yeah, guy credibility. likely gonna happen point unfortunately. 

We dodged bullet 2003 Covid-19's cousin, SARS-1. case fatality rate 10-20%, never figured anywhere near contagious Covid, end isolated eradicated spreading several communities around world.

Another Covid-19's deadly cousins MERS, still infects people middle east Central Asia spend considerable time around Camels- virus comes from. fatality rate even higher SARS, also adept person person transmission. 


If really want fuck sleep schedule, definitely think happens person infected Covid-19 lives area MERS endemic to, gets infected both... person closely related viruses circulating swapping genetic material other... Potentially creating much severe hybrid SARS 2 MERS contagious Covid, nearly deadly MERS...

Luckily thats probable, possible. Pretty sure meaning US, lot people pretend sympathetic. 

What really means States is: ‚Äúhere canned answer f‚Äôin twit, don‚Äôt give üêÄ arse you,now go sit sod off.‚Äù Yeah, I'm sure they're dreading potential customers would completely sequenced initial infection later infection I'm getting right? basic rtPCR tests enough markers (I'm assuming they're using SNP markers) able accurately identify different COVID strains whether COVID present not?

Incorrect.

There two possible explanations immunity short-lived:

1. virus attacks immune system. seem doing.

2. nasty epitopes antibodies get screened reason. Recently papers reported autoimmune reactivity anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, especially proteins neurons. Given serious side effects seen Oxford vaccine exactly nature expected happening, looks like mechanism indeed also play.

Vaccines lot better natural infection first mechanism one involved

But latter one turns major one too, forget vaccines. Vodka works same, spit done. Oh yeah agree. I've pissed home state claiming lowering counts COVID meanwhile testing high around 30k day mike 15-20k. Like, shit catching fewer cases. 

On flip side, actually adopted masks across board, opened bars gyms 30% states, maybe level testing achieve July would closer adequate hold second wave down. Instead wave 3, cool. people like barely got sick fully recovered within week. like super human something?


Why downvoted asking question?? This. 

It‚Äôs looking like burn area. NY, NJ, CA, etc? Cases (more tests redefinition ‚Äúcase‚Äù compared earlier) deaths down, generally, except covid basically initial presence.  

Mask everyone limit indoor crowds, initial inoculums generally low. Low initial inoculum means immune systems going weakling instead strong viral presence. Fewer deaths, fewer severe cases. didn‚Äôt get tested Covid March. know positive IgG antibody test. numbers vary r0 fixed. study r0 4.7 6.6.

It seem covid far contagious flu.

EDIT: anyone want read argument below, hit ""overdoses counted COVID deaths"" line end it, that's need know they're coming from. common cold, maybe?  employment law protects wife? Ugh, shut hell up. much Great Barrington Declaration. true! Never wanna touch mask part that's little ear-loopy's.

To clarify, make barrier face rest world inner elbow **without** touching anything. Texas go way Florida slip ocean. rest country would better off.  Yup. America give first place without fight. /s Absolutely ridiculous. also quite brilliant terms virus spread given everybody even chance getting it. left people one spot airflow positioning determine gets it, now, Oprah says, everybody gets corona. want equate ""flattening curve"" ""not overloading hospitals"" ok. want argue semantics. fact deniers filled comment sections ""that's do,"" patently false.

And no, ""defeating entirely"" never figured anyone else's thinking least vaccine perhaps even then.

I would rather approached problem like, example, Germany. terrible outbreak moment. Let's see get back control become like United States. third üåä wave. Try keep son. Pfft. even top 10. Must real virus /s get it, you‚Äôve brainwashed thinking far dangerous driving car. correct. meant say delayed infections, deaths. case texas, included daily stats - ever - ""came late"" undetstand...if tested positive get hospital notes, people stupid?

The comments YouTube vids Doug Ford's weekly press conferences sickening. can‚Äôt control behavior others, like all. Plus live someone who‚Äôs high risk, might able take enough precautions protect them.

That mean society change. 

If high risk take extra precautions. you‚Äôre high risk job requires physical presence you‚Äôre shit luck? 

If high risk take extra precautions. high risk face face job would true covid, flu anything else might come simple proposed individual actions. 

It's actually simple. Keep sick people apart healthy people treat healthy people like sick people. 

We quarantine sick people, lock healthy people. anything, pandemic laid bare fact thing PUBLIC health, islands unto ourselves. 

Hardly, system designed never was. cannot go hundred million billions trillions masks overnight. national mandates simpler precautions like masks distancing, harmful economic actions enacted numbers inevitably spike.

That never happen. Little thing called bill rights. economic question also assumes deaths $0 economic consequence, demonstrably untrue.

Linking CDC mean 11K people died COVID. attribution cause excess mortality bullshit conspiracy theory.

You're making ridiculous argument here. ""We can't know object light fire try it, even though know material inflammable.""

We already know people 13 years life average dying. They're ""tinder"", dying anyway. One thing well US, distribute shit. Amazon put box anything doorstep 2 days think get vaccines need go quickly. haven‚Äôt seen discredit vaccine thing though it‚Äôs little topic.

The White House trying interfere FDA's approval process. apparently dropped issue pushback FDA basically everyone else.

Their attempts compromise process fuel antivaxxers anything else. suppose double blind study? leaking whether participant got placebo compromise trial? Whether accurate, terrible ongoing study questionable whether Brazil trial data used now. kinda assume something higher that. I‚Äôd estimate 30-40%, death rates social distancing alone. death rates way lower increasingly gotten better treating infected people. 

If 40% less people die similar numbers March, example, cases back then, toooo many.

I hope get point think waste would avoid much energy would safe too, course need similar reliable. assume control behavior. People know vaccinated may behave differently sure none. compare two groups people neither know whether actually vaccinated. Deep Dumbfuckistan, surprising. Haha sorry, late went right head :) Citation needed point giving someone placebo vaccine trial? difference Florida places. places, stupid, keep mouth shut, afraid that, open it, others figure dumb.

Not Florida! stupid, ignorant person shout rooftops. us knew. That's one signal train sniffer dog use, sniffer dogs trained sit stay next positive sample rather bark. got it, silly joke... family chivasso (to), I‚Äôve roamed around area quite bit  statement political all? furthermore that's far alignment YES! everyone else like, ""Why visit in-laws Thanksgiving sit across table less 2 feet yell really loudly hearing aids tell story let ANOTHER salesperson accidentally!"" Sigh. God wish Thats less problem they're vaccinated Like coronavirus? give little context, also trying shift focus viruses diseases (Zika, Nipah, Lassa Fever etc), regularly update [list getting countries companies focus research. 

Anyway, throw shade, support reasoning downplaying threat pandemic flu. 

Some reasons always huge focus influenza, one common communicable human diseases, allow flu greatly impact poor wealthy nations alike. Like wealthy nations certain lifestyle changes spared developed countries ""unknown"" pandemics epidemics like Cholera, AIDs, Ebola, Nipah Plague. Flu cannot easily contain economic social status one's country. course, pressure wealthy countries focus diseases disrupt others.

Secondly, combine fact high rate mutations, undergoes antigenic shift wild flu virus somewhat easily always come contact animals, makes threat novel flu virus always constant threat. Due this, know pandemic flu typically occurs every 20 40 years.

You say develop vaccine flu readily fear understand potential bad flu readily. Like scientists keep tabs deadly variants flu, like Avian Influenza (30% mortality).

Last point is, strong existing flu surveillance system gives diseases program piggyback on. example, due [Seattle's existing flu surveillance scientists know COVID 19 started spread somewhere around January February 2020. health department kneecap, system would served early warning system allowing early action spread disease America. looked estimated transmission rate changes ARIs.

I still can't understand could look R roughly 1 summer tell ""Yep, we're fine."", collecting data transmission paths, getting busloads TTI workers, simplifying testing access, generally bracing autumn. Bundeswehr again.

From personal experience, TTI failed already. Two contacts social circle, called.
Several ARIs, one bothered testing. mean ""just fine"", you? in:

""How You?""

""Just fine, thanks. almost mind amputations carry oxygen tank around anymore"" use positive PCR tests serological testing people like Youyang Gu provided consistently accurate projection country?

And extrapolate protective effects Cell mediated immune responses (or lack thereof) dangers waning antibodies? Full knowing test positivity rate 10% many hard hit states means you‚Äôre definitely missing cases? 

It sounds awful lot like you‚Äôre finding data want find using fit point view. 

‚ÄúLess 1% US PCR positive diagnosis. definitely means waning antibodies cause concern herd immunity never achieved. cannot accept missed large number cases.‚Äù 

That‚Äôs you‚Äôre saying. see light 3 layer cotton mask (but can‚Äôt blow candle), worthless?

I‚Äôm sure important either two factors are. context, situation besides one sounds bad Uhhh I'm quite sure talking thing talking about.

The flu vaccine different reasons varying effectiveness compared viral vaccines, due yearly changes made possible viral antigenic shift found Orthomyxoviridae. 

Vaccines MMR, polio, ones developed SARS-Cov2 pretty unchanging antigen targets stable effectiveness produced, approved, introduced general population. 

You commenting issues individual's immune system effectively process antigens introduced via vaccine. vaccines limitations well work given individual. I've referring effectiveness, I'm talking epidemiological level terms well vaccine able protect populations receive it, well confer protection given individual administered to. SICK employees shouldn‚Äôt happy  Even wasn‚Äôt placebo vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective. general public pretty much like ""Yeah...fuck that."" Oof. I‚Äôm sorry. really sucks. misconception. PHASE 3 SAFETY. Phase 3 efficacy - know vaccine works. talk rushing vaccines longterm side effects people thinking point trials look side effects. monitoring safety, point EFFICACY. Ignoring reasons [bipartisan confidence coronavirus vaccine blaming one party definition partisan rhetoric.

Yep. Right epicenter Burleigh County. Hospital capacity 90% due forestalled elective procedures. There's much speculation many snowbirds getting procedures done leaving warmer climates AZ &amp; FL.

Mask use common, though mandated. Nearly local retail instituted mask policies good compliance posted signage. Group activities (sports, weddings, family events, etc) seem main source community spread.

We aware per-capita graph made us infamous, honestly, much concern fear locally. Nearly (with exception infirm elderly long-term care) minor symptoms, often first assumed allergies cold.  Testing has, since May, readily available twice-weekly drive-thrus, free all, results texted 24-36 hrs. easy peasy testing system, many people get tested frequently, probably would done otherwise.

Just report ground. know graph this: \_\_/ , locally, concerning. Sorta like murder rate:

I'm optimistic cold weather flush snowbirds (and comorbidities) south hospital capacity return normal, gov't induced, 85% occupancy rates. 

Stay well all. Nonsense!! I've taking brand name Obecalp years never single side effect!  Yes holding least vaccine comes that's reason now. Thanks asking 5$ antivax twist use propaganda ‚Äúprove‚Äù covid vaccine lethal Lots clicks though Yes definitely - sorry meant drive hour get Lombardy. Otherwise right next :) Look reports state USA.  break deaths age cases whether nursing homes. Minnesota, 3/4 deaths residents nursing homes, implying pretty frail. Florida hits different drafted weeks ago, read it, like it.
Also think waves, incase anyone gets sick issues vaccine. Americans stupid. NZ imported cases now. china. Korea Japan keeping lid it.

But locked down, masked, tested, contact traced, lock anyone positive stay home. China reopened water parks example.

The US Response sucks, sucks hard, really really hard. govt can't even keep welfare going. Yeah. true trump. OK - assumed. Glad sounds though vaccine blame. I'm leaning towards whine like baby government right kill tens thousands local businesses, think we'll worry Biden do. reverse happens? hospitalizations grow significantly large deaths stay stable continue fall. I'd suggest read trials work. always placebo arm trials. Researchers determine vaccine/therapy/etc. works comparing outcomes placebo arm. Otherwise, know effective vaccine is. Trial participants know 50/50 shot. Strictly speaking, Piedmont one step Lombardy :) Jokes them, none us get good night's sleep anymore. Everything read gives bad feeling AstraZeneca vaccine. First overpromised timing (remember Oxford researcher said 80% confident approval September) sold billions doses desperate countries testing. they're lobbying far right governments monopoly preying toxic nationalism trial nearly problem free competitors (whether actually safe yet determined). news trial participant died followed leak participant took placebo clearly compromises double blind trial.

Whether vaccine effective determined science, needs serious investigation Oxford AstraZeneca. severe restrictions socializing, economy falling apart, opioid crisis intensifying, many suicides job loss. rampant community spread major areas cases deaths grow exponentially loosen restrictions. talk elimination eradication, end game besides vaccine. severely restricted life 2023? good exactly? compare Canada dumpster fire USA, compare Canada Australia. Australia less back normal locking hard August 2nd. Australia single digit new cases nationwide now. brother sister-in-law West god Virginia probably responsible this. Sigh. reason need read sources answer talking 85 yo answer like talking 70+. need read anything respond that. 

That said, might check later personal interest, respond you. depends county doing. bay area might loosening restrictions, riverside county. We'll see state december. think mild weather state might help slow spread.

Bottom line - petty reasons bring wearing mask aren‚Äôt worse dying. sure can‚Äôt grasp that. It‚Äôs pretty amazing actually. You‚Äôre right - don‚Äôt give fuck anyone‚Äôs reason needing possibly harm kill others. excuses  mute points. crazy didnt actually happen. abundance caution tests, chances incredibly small. think iowa issue too, squashed ago.

COVID-19's patterns illness range infectiousness varies wildly person person. really unreasonable think people would sick longer others, catch virus later time‚Äîpeople caught illness sea would inevitably slip cracks go infect populace land.  Hey know flu serious covid. never said weren't. also tend take flu seriously cause Immunol compromised people family  

I'm saying could much worse next time. Imagine Small Pox like virus emerged, would kill billions could even attempt get control. 

A ""flattened"" curve would mean nothing case. would need iraddication stop it. would need vaccine close 90 percent effectiveness.

CFR covid 1-3 percent person recieves adequate treatment. small pox 30-50 percent, covid caused much distruption imagine small pox would do? 

You forget debates around going school, restaurants even groceries risk high. would stay put home, wait care package.

Small Pox jumped humans agriculture. similar disease could emerge factory farming. see. understand now. One final question, federal govt block state purchase vaccine, simply approving vaccine blocking moving forward application process? suggestion basically means indoor restaurants small coronafests Easy: Test ones 60 show/admit symptons LFA PCR test then. Reduces test burden factor 20. course, problem participant (or family) unblinded, leaking information media (to support AstraZeneca's stock price less) alters behavior participants still study may able infer whether given vaccine placebo reflects badly whether study carried properly. information revealed AstraZeneca press release all. Totally unrelated mentioned Royalton made think Treasure City...one favorite places rural Minnesota.

Pro Tip: debate start ""This position refuse believe otherwise"" going get far. That'y debate, use evidence. US developed countries purchased enough doses frontrunner vaccines advance probably go back normal end next year first months 2022, developing countries might wait longer. 

It‚Äôs fair it‚Äôs unfortunately many things work international affairs. 6 foot rule 15-minute rule random-ass cutoffs based hard science.

You get infected get enough virus particles mucus membranes. Virus particles decrease distance sick person, intake essentially going constant time interaction. seem one hell bent denying dangers here. need fucking transparency. specifically trails stop? feel comfortable resuming them? going take word it, release info... that? Distancing diametrically opposed means almost definition economy can‚Äôt run full capacity. also puts strain mental health lot people means either can‚Äôt see certain people can‚Äôt intimate contact. Masks aren‚Äôt bad mean can‚Äôt see people‚Äôs smiles talking people muffled. It‚Äôs still something I‚Äôm okay years end.

This whole thing exactly improve respect humanity. misconstrued ‚Äústopped‚Äù mean end mistake. No? fuck talking about? 

Great! That's point I'm trying illustrate, everyone asking you, basically exactly that; disregarding what's already trying apply personal experience actually think space reality something given moment, amount hype media drums up? 

Hence point above, maybe bad probably worse personally experienced? I'm even American, I'm Canadian, even relatively lower numbers, parents friends (plural) either die, survive ICU serious damage afterwards. using personal experience go around saying death rate 20% subjective experience? I'm not, that's using personal definition downplay severity bad someone whose terrible personal experience exaggerating point view.

And accounting friends family currently living Asia Europe right Let ask something. Say 100 patients hospital due virus, fifty days 98, two came day. 

As someone else said, giving hypothetical, loads actual numbers there? remember hearing outset. historical data showing past emergent coronaviruses circulate ""common cold"" initially much lethal. I'm guessing kind information depending long virus around. mean, talking pre-early-modern medicine even? potentially long time wait.

This statement right America certain doomed COVID-19. people know following protocols initially dropped everything mask like going bars. remember family hugging anything it‚Äôs nothing going things get worse worse But, but, but....ABORTION!!! Yeah, sensationalism. Basically saying every single patient hospital due CV put ICU they'd take 25% beds. use information?

But, point even Trump **wanted** so; controlling three branches Federal Government 2017 still wasn‚Äôt enough. 2 3 branches federal government aren‚Äôt even involved Constitutional amendment; it‚Äôs purely Legislative matter. constitutional amendment requires simple majorities Congress. involves non-federal Government bodies 3/4th States approve well.

This CZ, also true Spain/France/Germany etc. plan. Nothing. going try contain? Lockdown? lockdown? Partial lockdown? Nothing. Completely clueless. Headless chickens.

Aka complete fucking opposite America. already required wear masks, jobs already giving people masks. making requirement employers provide masks. Also wear even social distancing done. Yes, definitely isolate vulnerable people infected contagious virus. That's brainier.

Good blood levels vitamin would help already symptoms may little late start taking takes several days metabolized, faster, already metabolized forms vitamin think available counter. old recommendation 400 IU (unidades internacionales, 40IU = 1mg) vitamin outdated, health experts like Dr. Fauci taking 2000 IU 6000 IU day profilaxis, recommending dosage long term use would require blood testing vitamin levels. 

You also need ensure correct levels vitamin K (either supplements diet) taking vitamin D.

 I'd curious see stats simply people getting sick twice months apart regards severity. Right, even 6 feet apart public stick around. reason spread shit corona one knows happen though? know Michigan, set ability move patients around, mostly never used.

The article read mentioned POTS known brought illness, surprised there's much known (and I'd never really heard it). Guess goes lyme disease illnesses long-term effects. 

If want see silver lining... maybe focusing (because covid) sort treatment remedy developed could useful suffering long-term lyme disease consequences. call krakow new lombardi... still people don‚Äôt wear masks aggressively so.

it‚Äôs completely ignored public. friends back home (where I‚Äôm stuck) part isn‚Äôt bad, getting true college experience far real bummer. bad 35% US (and half Republicans) said would get vaccinated (as August), even available free. nice, though? someone refused blood test person got pricked take drugs precaution regardless?

There's discussion anti maskers feeling students never really cared unless sick. university towns except Stockholm Gothenburg simply fairly isolated group, although huge number interconnections inside, show death ICU statistics due extremely serious cases. Especially last spring testing severely ill necessary workers. 

My experience clubs closed number private parties exploded I've never many nights playing board games acquaintances April. I've talked several similar experiences. Corridors would get sick isolate, friends dropping food door people got healthy carry on. 

The difference though universities kept open, everyone study home instead forced go home older parents. Also mostly everyone place. know many decided rather stay social younger people contact older relatives. Personally time would ever meet someone older 27 buying groceries. August long ago? burning population running hosts ended pandemic, thought. could completely off. mean anything regarding immunity, means unlikely detect whether person *had* corona back infection lies. thiNk long haul going take long time recover Plenty people preexisting conditions live 80. fact, seniors preexisting conditions sort. know much aging. right, last much longer people think. loaded question requires proof majority positive cases got infected pubs restaurants. Care provide proof? Well, guess needed help rounding people involuntary trips quarantine centers could ask Chinese military help. needed help welding people homes, could send Chinese welders. decided disappear people tow line, I'm sure got specialists China too. Otherwise, waste time. Basically every doctor around world treating COVID way. Public policy nothing jfc could 7 months living like hermit effect whatsoever. could stand top apartment every night rain dance end climate change, ice caps still gonna melt. Probably much fewer people, population lot older 1918 Books stores clothing stores. Haha definitely. Ah see. Never mind. correct first time. reason, thought Netherlands low total case count. Hello! seems like gotten real answer yet I'll give one:

Moderna's Pfizer's vaccine would first ever mRNA vaccine. 

What mRNA?
If recall high school bio class (no judgement don't) DNA codes protein. middle man process mRNA, messenger RNA. copies one side DNA double helix moves way ""protein making factory"", ribosome.

Cool story, Covid?
The surface coronavirus what's called spike protein (keyword: protein). allows virus latch onto cells enter them. build immunity virus, immune system recognize spike protein fight off. 
So there're really 2 possible ways immune system recognize this. Either naturally exposed virus surviving, manufacture immune system recognize spike protein real contact virus. latter vaccine comes in.

Basically vaccine mRNA codes spike protein. cells produce spike protein (but full virus) recognized immune system. thus immune Covid (or theoretically one strand it) found quite useful, bet medical community too. 53% larger (1080x935) version linked | find larger images yourself: / / | Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Anyways, major props contribution. already enough actual, scientific evidence suggest even Covid make immediately sick, fuck ways long term situations.

Yes ""actual scientific evidence"" tells us possible, really bad cases, take months fully recover symptoms. possible people could develop extremely bad outcomes, like many uncle sample size one. Scientists using 'slightly' bigger sample sizes multi-millions, sourced internationally. anecdotal (and statistically lucky) example uncle getting fucked Covid means little, logically speaking. confusing immediate surroundings reality world large.

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

As October 15, 216,025 deaths COVID-19 reported United States; however, might underestimate total impact pandemic mortality.

**What added report?**

Overall, estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred late January October 3, 2020, 198,081 (66%) excess deaths attributed COVID-19. largest percentage increases seen among adults aged 25‚Äì44 years among Hispanic Latino persons.

**What implications public health practice?**

These results inform efforts prevent mortality directly indirectly associated COVID-19 pandemic, efforts minimize disruptions health care. people care. calculated risk, alternative isolate year. Elaborate what?
This normal course practice country.
Private hospital charges 3x amount level service horrible

The patient gets badly abused nurses. experience people wearing masks talking pub restaurants? True. biggest denier know leased new cars, spent every penny, never saved retirement bit. welcome wear mask 2030, rest us go life without wearing mask social distancing organized federal response. pleasure correct yeah, treatment become slightly better. Remdesivir shows effect newer data. Dexamethason saves like 1 8 severe cases (NNT).

You don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking about. NAPLES, Italy (Reuters) - Since schools southern Italian region Campania closed due surge COVID-19 cases, teachers taking classes streets prevent students falling behind.

Campania, around Naples, escaped largely unscathed Italy‚Äôs first coronavirus wave spring, region seen infections soar recent weeks local authorities closed schools end October.

‚ÄúMothers called said kids floods tears, want go back school, don‚Äôt understand schools need stopped,‚Äù said Pamela Buda, holding class pupils sitting public steps central Naples.

Tonino Stornaiuolo yells lessons pupils listening balconies streets outside homes.

‚ÄúWe everything respect rules think emergency Italy serious real,‚Äù Stornaiuolo said.

The government far avoided imposing nationwide curbs schools, businesses freedom movement, urged regional authorities draw restrictions needed.

Lombardy, Milan located, already introduced curfew 11 p.m. 5.00 a.m. put stop late night gatherings. Campania said follow suit. [nL8N2HB5ZV]

‚ÄúI wanted find way kids could see us share time us, least long possible know whether another lockdown,‚Äù Stornaiuolo added. rare get twice (mostly people got young, like 6 months old). 

But terms chicken pox virus, get twice never get rid first time. That's like saying can't catch HIV twice - sure, always it. Sir don‚Äôt think quite understand orgies... üòé What? vaccine good? HEPA air filter UVC light ionization. purchased refurbished one save $$$ Wow. Democrats‚Äô hoax gotten control. üôÑ problem part problem.  people freaking unreasonable things funny? 

Same reason people freaking wearing masks funny. Highest rates chronic obesity, malnutrition, heart disease, diabetes, every comorbidity list US. *definitely* reinfections, even medical literature eventually read COVID-19 infection confers immunity. true virus, even viruses medical literature says confer decades-long lifelong immunity chicken pox measles. always reinfection cases nothing ever 100%.

The questions really then:

How often COVID-19 reinfection happen? long initial infection typically occur? reinfection generally milder, same, severe? agree. We're willing put lockdowns quarantines restrictions everyone vulnerable choice. choice able something protect ourselves, fuck restrictions. hope vaccine accessible everyone needs/wants it. wearing mask now... part problem. Fair officials giving public information good ventilation too? hear talked often. 

 also think officials going bad job explaing ""why* need reduce indoor contact, failing explain spreads indoors. think educated general public they'd actually get it. cult

Yeah that's fine, racist buffoons trust scientist. gained NEW followers getting covid, looks like idiot anyone brain. totally thought guy standing waist high water. üò≥ seriously could care less Kind weird elderly men likely hospitalised and/or die women likely get ""long covid"". think would correspond likely bad initial acute infection. probably completely back normal 2022.

You might wondering, ugh, why? Well, see, vaccine distribution takes time. one-and-done thing happens within day, even week. know lot would like go back normal immediately take vaccine, I'm sorry, realistic expectations.

Will things eventually improve? course. However, there's long fight ahead bring completely control, could take year, even longer. News Ukraine bit hard find general. mean, US huge spike early summer South/ West big first wave. Meanwhile, Europe breathing collectively premature sigh relief thinking beat thing back Spring, another major widespread outbreak last weeks. Agreed. Everything I've read vaccine development distribution suggests ""lucky"" things ""back normal"" 2022. Thoughts prayers. Virtual church would help too. I'm saying anything, larger spread one could think curve takes longer time go well. 

Just one post I'm closed

Schools 16+ closed Sweden, Norway hindsight decision close elementary schools sport activities discontinued

Same Sweden, [14th allowed again, still today audiences utilities like gyms/sports events/cultural activities closed

Gyms open, sports events, museums closed effect 50 limit/general compliance/monetary reasons/fear events. Cinemas also closed since one went, even though allowed. Hairdressers similar close contact open Sweden, closed restaurants kept open Norway rules here, 1m space etc. Night clubs still closed outside Sweden/Finland subjected mandatory quarantine chose return.

Sweden not, effect since countries less closed down/banned Swedish people many traveled, except cross-border work open also banned public gatherings lockdown.

Yes, many 50 people events peak, since everyone stayed home.

So see, differences, quite similar (except timing), explain ten times dead. Somehow everyone believe business usual Sweden, not. You‚Äôre right - isn‚Äôt one way college. tell people real point merely get job make easy money bit narrow minded Proof masks work.

Masks mandated indoors since 9/14 done nothing mitigate spread.

When first mask mandate cancelled (late July) noone wore them, cases go 3 months. People wearing surgical masks (instead cloth bullshit March/April/May PPE impossible find) positive effect anyways.

i believe mods aware already might remove soon discover connection. I'll probably downvoted absolutely practice social distancing getting vaccinated. I'll wear mask store requires it. I'll travel again, I'll party, I'm gonna go nuts. We've waited enough vaccination bring tolerable level. I'm advocating current time however. Tell people would go bancrupt this, people already struggling first lockdown.

At best, localized lockdowns hard hit areas, never full country... unless really gets bad option left... Germany ever gets point, hit hard, financially.

Dont get wrong, ""Germoney"" isnt poor so, would become extremely expensive. Well, basically yeah. full machinery living cell. divide own. eat, poop. nothing except chill - is, they're host cell hijacked make lots usually worked death always wondered virus ‚Äúknows‚Äù it‚Äôs host cell

A lot molecular biology boils ""protein A's shape matches protein B's shape interact well"".

Many viruses even need enter cell altogether, poke hole wall inject ""good"" stuff. Again, that's triggered lock-and-key interactions molecules specific shapes. COVID-19 infect cells nose stuff surface matches (detects) shape stuff cells, that's ""figures out"" right place. Antivirals work jamming mechanism (like sticking gum keyhole key fit). see virus making hell lot progress.

Scnr. matter. soon vaccine widely available, bets off. someone dies COVID lazy anti-vaxx, one bat eye longer.

That‚Äôs awesome hear!!!

I always wear mask around others, office never closed things never begin with.

Anyway, here's really first recorded case Covid reinfection different strains...

No, confirmed cases reinfection different strains. That's literally definitional requirement prove case reinfection. 

Even reinfection actually happened strain, possible prove first infection never cleared. Therefore, confirmed reinfection to, definition, different strains.  simply count same-strain reinfection. 

It follow means different strains causing reinfections. fact, scientists think waning immunity covid cause reinfections, different strains, strains different enough places matter that. scientists pretty confident vaccine work strain (at least thus far). 




 

Anyway, seem really confu Hate guy took first test last week (I common cold get tested), stood line, outside, wind blowing me, 45 minutes. Probably bunch people front covid positive agree, taking test certain cicumstances worse since around people symptoms.

Speaking Europe US, first generation modern history lower living standards parents. unless case societal collapse, inertia accumulation technology would make evolution aspect almost automatically. something really wicked absurd end situation Alright, guy. I‚Äôm going address things specifically asked me. I‚Äôm quoting going points one one; figured wouldn‚Äôt much ask same, clearly wrong that. starting right now, don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre asking me, responded vague, four-word response, I‚Äôm going address it.

With Like said one go store get Amazon order.

Fucking explain gets me, then. make sure protections go? 

Nope, make sure I‚Äôm either wearing gloves, immediately wash hands bring bags in. sanitize packaging, too. can‚Äôt control people do. still going work.
You work job, like everyone non essential job.

A lot people know non-essential jobs still able work home. already stated can‚Äôt do. apply job, don‚Äôt get hired, suggest make money support family? think I‚Äôll stick job have, now, thanks. 

Maybe apply job magical Amazon place teleports groceries house. compare job Disneyland?

You compared essential job non-essential job. Disney World recent topic. 

**EDIT**: right here, smooth complain make excuses since fine non essential businesses like Disneyland forced shut down

My job = essential; Disney World = non-essential. even paying point want lockdown going put many non essential workers work willing same.

Why? job deemed essential. Whether agree moot. need income; order acquire income, need job - job can‚Äôt home, like lot people can.

So basically, either never leave house, order want Amazon magically appear since nobody go anywhere get me, quit job someone else got laid off; ... exactly?

**SECOND EDIT**:

An additional response point want lockdown going put many non essential workers work willing same.

My point want everything re-open going put many people walks life risk COVID-19, willing wear mask, social distance, etc.

What‚Äôs good goose, that. conspiracy. 

This needs stated often.

There conspiracy something bad going on. lots selfish individuals acting interests, act way that's indistinguishable conspiracy.

The majority conspiracy theories arise due people power influence complete dickheads. Conspiracy theories usually wrong, ignored: they're indication public highly dissatisfied direction society going in. care, continue wants to, need got banned last time wear masks keeping distance people possible isn‚Äôt thing lockdown. Vaccines preventative. aren‚Äôt cures. seems expensive. Brain mri contrast around 8-9k got placebo vaccine contracted covid way died due that?

(not disagreeing I'm asking question) Vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective. Even received experimental vaccine, shouldn‚Äôt considered complete failure. Czech Republic almost 12k 10,5 million population.

It's controversial generally regarded immoral effective treatment thar use vaccine fails.  Well case infections protests. Narrator: ""It wasn't."" insane anyone would release article without info first... creates panic distrust

Why insane? eye catching headline people immediately click on. It'd insane release way. go well courts too. Ageism young completely institutionalized accepted. young people pay insurance, hard leading young politician, among things. simply considered issue starts offending sensitivities actually power  Barely financial support throughout, issue. people work shit luck. Production already started vaccines United StAtes. Whichever approved already produced months now. speed distribution phase agree take months  I've heard lot less developed countries actually better population infection control measures common. That's still excuse NZ Australia shown developed countries keep control probably takes excellent leadership bit luck. doubt citizens' attitudes much though. careful. 

Just crazy anti-vaxx nuts make egregious claims vaccines, suddenly make polar opposite they're always 100% safe true. 

Many people react well even vaccines well tested. 

Any time put literally anything body reason(including food) there's risk.  Don‚Äôt expect one. post long terrible even vaccine released next year receive tons flak tell friends I'm former Whataburger enthusiast turned In-and-Out fanatic. Food always well put together, cheap get, great service, tastes incredible. gap age group 80k, Connecticut, example, preliminary overdose death counts 19 percent end July, compared time frame last year. 9 percent Washington end August, 28 percent Colorado, 30 percent Kentucky period.  totally agree. white folks dying, would One Munic index cases got passing salt shaker. yes. right. Western rules sold like containment mitigation. Yes. also important create undue anxiety vaccine there's already much skepticism abound. Like someone else said, brain dead dead. 

I find pretty much impossible believe woman formally declared ""brain dead"" made recovery. criteria brain death *cannot* made someone still shock (hypotensive, fully perfusing blood) acute brain injury. reason being, person shock, may brain activity regain brain activity shock corrected. acute brain injury causes swelling brain, same. 

It's possible doctors said ""we believe brain dead"" discussion family, making formal declaration death. easily mixed stressed family member mean ,""they declared brain dead."" Words wisdom.

Yea, got placebo. Unfortune him, reference.

I'm quite surprized hear sertain people doubts science. Science method find objective truth testing, comparing, peer reviewing repetition studies.

In medical trial, lot references needed, know would happened without new drug treatment. people need get sick even die see drug really prevent that. 

[Atleast western countries considered unethical actually infect anyone something test about. large population needed, thounds perhaps, enough naturally get exposed thing tested]


In good medical science get unbiased results test setting done ""double blindfolded"". person getting real new test drug, blasebo know wich he/she got, also scientist know wich individuals got real plasebo. results collected: many got sick / stayed healthy / side effects - coding opened see plasebo, real test drug. Otherwice people making diagnoses, might favor one option another.

Then numbers compared help statistical methods. get mathematical answer effective drug is. result actually comparable reliable (showing error marginals).

For examble Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV13 reduces sepsis meningitis 80%. get result, plasebo group maybe 1000 cases vacconinated maybe 200. groups size properly randomized, result reliable -80% less severe cases vaccine. Still get sick, taking vaccine definately great benefit. cows get covid story Chyna rather UK there'd condemnation. say J&amp;J person ‚Äúgot sick‚Äù. Fairly vague..

And comment Oxford vaccine, tea serve myelitis insanely rare general population glad watching closely, even one case placebo. Also company didn‚Äôt confirm condition Slaoui knows? Strange.


Slaoui said two confirmed cases transverse myelitis, inflammation spinal cord, AstraZeneca trials, one vaccine group one placebo group. company confirmed adverse events transverse myelitis. said regulators need determine whether adverse events caused vaccine coinciden Please tell STEM. disinformation doing? flip coin whether get placebo vaccine. randomly assigned number fell wrong group.

Surrounding areas quite rural. WA minimal public transit outside major metro areas. Mask compliance pretty good. Lockdown reasonably serious, many things still running ""normally"" here. saying don‚Äôt bother? might misunderstanding good bot filled uneducated sociopaths moment. really (About 4 symptoms), dad tested without specific symptoms. there's reasonable suspicion someone might catch it, they're gonna test person. Obviously test anyone who's got common cold symptoms around anyone infected. northern hemisphere ready admit there's seasonal aspect yet? Ridiculous moved school's summer break December/January January/February yet. See disagree. lockdown doesn‚Äôt cause 100,000 people die. It‚Äôs pandemic getting control causes hospitals overrun cause excess deaths. reacted, hospitals would overrun areas leading far excess deaths. You‚Äôll note significant excess deaths beyond covid deaths occurred places outbreak got control (Italy, Spain, England, US). simple effect lockdown economic downturn alone led zero extra deaths virus mostly control within ability health care system cope (Germany, Canada, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, Australia, etc etc etc etc)  would leisure travel allowed country currently?

We see friends twice week: friends see already symptomatic cases recovered: got gym wife/the various wives girlfriends went together since shut reopened stricter rules. worried infected reinfecting them. gone activities: cooking food, watching movies/tv shows/sports home, hanging out.

We've seen extended family twice since March, similar story see friends friends: going out, masks necessary/suggested.

GET HYPED. Stop spreading misinformation.

:) nah, came back solely backlash got. Oh yeah, sure.. less quarter year. like 6 fucking months ago morons said lockdowns would last weeks I'm confident. know symptom super uncomfortable resembles onset Parkinson‚Äôs... glad went away. still less often now. 
Are improving fronts well? Exactly why. That's impressive logistics. I‚Äôm barefoot hillbilly, illiterate! üòÑ people think thing magically disappear overnight immediately go back normal life (i.e., vaccine), bad news. beginning, people thought quarantine would weeks most, close year, far. 

It's ""bad"" reality meet expectations.

You think bad expectations realistic. 

Nothing worse unmet expectations. *This* headline incredible irresponsible. zero reason believe volunteer died due complications vaccine, also zero reason believe ""unidentified sources"" able immediately determine random participant double-blind study given placebo. pure PR. expect even wilder people barred attending almost full year point. Can't wait go one Yeah always important note eventually over. think historical perspective pandemics far deadly worse living conditions lack medical technology yet still got it! Covid less deadly much better technology think definitely get pandemic well. really see fear mongering. articles said trials paused someone study died. That's it. key problem Covid19 is: First contagious, ill.

There natural pressure become milder.

Luckily, heavily dispersed transmission rate, Asian countries apply social pressure demonstrating life without Covid. get degree epidemiology virology? learning French. kidding. know hope plan, antibodies last week anyway, hope keep way vaccine. 

But far think there's much evidence suggest antibodies provide least immunity general. Yeah reinfections, rare enough make news many cases. 

I mean also know somebody chicken pox 3x somehow, generally accepted lifetime disease.

But agreed, seems highly seasonal. seems telling places seem spiking almost mirror image spring autumn. Probably going pretty tough winter. Placebos exist trials.

Technically, *controls* exist properly run trials. control may may true ""placebo.""

A real example trials ""second gen"" coronavirus vaccines coming coming months years, successful ""first gen"" vaccines trialed released public.

If already safe effective vaccine, really want know new vaccine compares old vaccine, i.e. least safe effective current one? determine that, would give control arm one current vaccines, trial arm new vaccine, compare results two arms.

As extreme example, say testing new treatment Ebola, much worse scarier coronavirus disease. would inhuman deny people control arm least current standard care know denying least standard treatment near certain death sentence. they're willing sponsor good standing Canadian authorities (taxes paid, criminal records) sponsor that's huge boost. wear mask required. That's it, almost every aspect life back 2019. Except things can't control (e.g. limited capacity restaurants) Like local team championship. Seems possible. dad stuck retirement center since first lock going crazy (86 health conditions can't live least now). can't wait get vaccine.

Thanks - too, stay healthy safe! flu schools 50's communities. months, week more. Yes, exactly! afraid losing motor control something. Thankfully, went away. I've long hauler 7 months now. particular symptom went away earlier months never returned. Democrats identifying lockdown party going push people vote. I'm voting 3rd party it. OP protocol. Appendix 10.8 specifically outlines HIV+ subject enrollment. It‚Äôs actually super annoying. Everything online, it‚Äôs hard learn home circumstances. hope vaccine available soon possible Absolutely. would expect concerts theaters full capacity, also full scream, dance actually live moment. Upvoting correct use ""all y'all"" government capital keep schools closed.

They March either, done almost everyone lockdown. much different now. America bad course! /s country 25% today.... weeks ago thought wtf saw 12k cases üò© mom 1 12 dad 1 8. Thats 20 people known offspring, one type 1 diabetes. looking forward anyone else disease. 28 national guard doctors USA???
Smells like bullshit, needed USA Applied science science, clearly important essential part. 

Applause everyone working Covid-19 Pandemic! 

No time rest though...huge amounts accomplished. we're we'll know lot viruses cellular responses. Covid though? little Africa East Asia. India major outlier. Q. can't use dogs...? A. There's big pharma patent solution. heart literally skipped. RIP thank GOD placebo think setting good example good place start imo realize regular Air breath actually small part oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% stuff like argon, etc. one other? admit need go grocery store work? 

So answer original question? think course 6 minutes people stop breathing gradually? found article. government plaudits tough early lockdown began March 20, since forced loosen restrictions help revive economy already recession two years poverty levels unemployment risen. ""

In article, also this:

"" ... reflection low testing levels loose enforcement lockdown rules. ""

It sounds like lockdown opened prematurely plan place. Even lockdown, ""loose enforcement"". article still gives like zero information. know COVID flight? symptoms getting flight suddenly appear? Good point first, second, even third hand experience. preached abundance caution Poland, would often asked: know anyone it?
No, don't. kind argument that? knowing anyone give immunity highly contagious virus? conclude area, especially known dormant yet contagious lots people? much reporting pandemic disingenuous. I'm one conspiracy theorists believes there's media plot keep us terrified, there's much wilfully dishonest reporting cherry picking scientific studies since March. Ofc gotta realistic sometimes takes get vaccine. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Interesting take things. think released messages? mistakes would avoid? Always happens like trying get different perspective here, since essential worker essential industry duration, much different experience many people able shelter. rarely see addressed talked get impression makes people uncomfortable. 

A observations colored opinion this-
In March/April/May absolutely ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù. road daily driving workplace moved tears times since freeways, roads streets empty. hard time believing people didn‚Äôt lock fully time.

The lock magnitudes harder almost every way could shelter place, examples include-
Grocery shopping- since neither partner home, home grocery deliveries option since availability outside window. Going store peak also difficult due shortened hours.

Work- workloads hours doubled due variety reasons including increased load/demand due lockdown decreased workforce due distancing/health reasons. resulted greater exposure time outside home.
The made logistics groceries even difficult.

We children- lost childcare resort options stable children, increasing exposure ours. limited options schooling spring early fall, little workable solutions. children risk falling behind (they since worked late night) still increased exposure risk. frequent advice seen elsewhere ‚Äúpay parent stay home‚Äù. several articles studies show frequently fall mother, reversing years progress working women.

The ask expose work (that needed even stay home society- maybe even so), seeing friends, family, support systems education children wears mental wellbeing frankly creates rage difficult describe (I I‚Äôm trying get back default happy go lucky nature).

So questions - two difference experiences lockdowns, compensate that?

While workforce‚Äôs made ‚Äúsafe‚Äù reduce infection essential population.
How take care people families roles (childcare, groceries, mental well being)? 

How keep spread happening open? 
How ensure wage gap women became wage canyon left without resources? 

Thank consideration.

Edit: tried fix formatting, mistakes. Link? That's interesting. disease majority patients recovers supportive therapy case series n=9 says nothing. could also donned smarties. see how.

Edit:
I know says covid complications cant find stated articles, actual cause. mean like cardiac arrest pulmonary embolism something. doesnt seem major factor based numbers have.

Painting things better light, maybe. Outright lies can't ever explained away... no. vaccine there. trust inactivated/mRNA candidates adenovirus vaccines like one.

Boston shifted remote, already  Actually may one easier viruses eliminate. Minimal genetic changes, persistence hosts environment (other chinese bat caves) high infectivity may produce natural herd immunity. vaccine could easily drop infection R0 1 eliminate virus. Depends vaccine, primary endpoint trials elimination SARS-COV-2 infection progressing covid-19 pneumonia. measuring infection risk well, that's primary endpoint. sure, September wedding receptions 150 people (registering multiple events couple place), packed trains, packed restaurants. people wear masks noses worse take masks talking.

People's behaviour completely changed, sure why. made become Titans fan? Masks: apparently ineffective stopping viruses, 100% solid wall comes much-smaller molecules. know test &amp; trace officer local university, apparently large batch either lost terribly delayed. Can't tell mine part batch people know facing wait times greater 3 days late. Yeah live south. mean I'm looking what's going COVID far thought past here. Man shame taken placebo. life literally decided coin toss. taken real vaccine, probably would alive today. Rip everyone died this. no, not. suggest looking would good idea, especially elders seem likely benefit nicotinamide anyway. Vietnam ????? Acted way. 90+ million people share border China. COVID free life back normal Poor kid. :( getting started life. fortunate sacrifice attempt help us all. screws loose head. zoom, online interaction much safer putting risk. live fucking ny, heard ambulances going 24/7. want stupid? go right ahead. rather sheep contribute ppl dying. mouth swab half case, believe clinical trial protocol says 2/3 drug 1/3 placebo No. 2009 Swine Flu pandemic example minor one. spread widely, low IFR countries bother locking setting major restrictions. development long time.

At stage trust Chinese inactivated vaccine much Oxford one. Moderna one looks promising too.  one message would give U.S. Federal government convey dire need cogent leadership time? Thanks keep great work üåπ sure why.

You able read AP news article Face shields designed always worn masks. I'm less worried overly cautious behaviour cavalier attitudes towards virus, hear point, especially like evidence-based guidance there's evidence suggests need wear mask walking deserted park! people err side caution, I'd start saying 'thank part keep safe community, too' I'd talk best guidance is, based evidence. concerned behaviours extreme putting harm's way (e.g. extreme isolation) I'd ask that, bear mind can't always know person taking precautions seriously particular health condition something else puts high risk illness.   live PNW; get correct sun summer since ozone blocks year ; getting supplemented brainer anyone doesn‚Äôt live near equator. I‚Äôm comparing nazi collaborators. excuses. CRO sponsor unblind needed. need reason so. regulators come review data turns peeking data unblinding without good reason documentation, they'll question whether sponsor particular making experiment design decisions could influence outcome (say, deciding enroll patients reach statistical significance stopping enrollment data favorable).

But course CRO ultimately sponsor ways knowing arm. they'll justify drug worked, comparing control.  Daily new cases far North America: 49,000
Daily new cases far Europe: 185,000 several issues involving weekends holidays. say death happens today, doctor signs today, coroner looks tomorrow, reported health department adds list friday afternoon, reported saturday (for example) death occured saturday maybe coroner sign till monday, tuesday staff meeting health department, add death wednesday reported thursday's numbers....and there's times huge backlogs sorted flip coin 9 times comes heads time, pay attention coin luck.  seems like awfully cynical dark assumption, considering many alternate possibilities.

Pretty disrespectful guy volunteered died. Yeah.... Remember like heard Amazon pantry... like got order....

Then said lockdown...

So it? want lockdown not? 

But debunked answer, group b could social distance wear mask.

You stereotyping people think covid overblown people drive trucks talk country accent. really hate getting twisted sites. Participants die most, all, clinical trials (in investigational placebo arms) kinds reasons. \*usually\* many hurdles in-human trials begin and, even then, participant deaths expected Well yea prob vaccine. many us ""normal"" individuals received it? Also, many U.S. want take it? age 80 Leonard Cohen resumed smoking figuring WTF. 70, I'm quite yet, goal gives reason keep going, makes self-protective measures bearable, yes, gives life *meaning*. Keep up. talking [people attend Covid Party: like Pox Party, Covid-19 rather Chicken Pox. People attendance intentionally catch spread virus effort ""get with"" build herd immunity. belief bad media claims, caught can't caught again. evidence this, trust certain people government, distrust certain people government.

How: government coordinated front sent mixed messages, directly resulting deaths kinds people talking about.

What said: ""These people would rather risk sacrificing lives virus risk mild inconveniences fellow man.""

What said: ""6 months isolation loneliness mild inconveniences.

COVID real thing need respect, also need respect sacrifices people making, rather flippant, pretend trivial.""

I'm sorry say man, comments little topic, except perhaps put words mouth - never said (anywhere), isolation loneliness big deal. said necessary. also never disrespected sacrifices people made. Hell, I'm one people. work get lives. partying catch virus like YOLO idiot appropriate target derision.

But can't counter said, directly, come across another idiot do. best argue straw man misrepresent position, whine let go unnoticed. we're going forget almost daily attacks CDC FDA current administration, we? might nice advice person already healthy weight, overweight/obese it‚Äôs generally entire lifestyle they‚Äôre overweight obese. don‚Äôt get wrong, mindful eat essential, like exercise is, get people truly healthy body, mind soul need really significant support.

you exercise want, eat clean diet still hold onto fat you‚Äôre sedentary hours time. average people sedentary 12 hours see scope bigger problem. enzymes break fat almost entirely shut sit short period time. exercise doesn‚Äôt offset unless you‚Äôre actually taking breaks stand move around couple times per hour. 

it also assumed people going level depression anxiety needs treated well. goes waaaaay beyond counting calories people. bodies literally rotting aging faster healthy counterparts, it‚Äôs extremely nuanced imo, crisis far greater society actually gives credence. Good luck. great idea married covid bacon breakfast. What? It‚Äôs pretty evident, yes. Seems like good candidate ""Porque los nos dos?""

Airports, school entrances, public transit. Lots places where, sure dogs might miss some, still catch some! seems worth it. would actually work unironically. saying goal eliminate COVID? never got public health messaging. tried going this? hard thought? know people jerks people wanting eat different others real friends this. Learning new recipes shopping routines also takes time good cause make effort for.

It's messed sticking eating traditions ends human race. never used eat much meat either. 1/30,000 mortality (30k participants right?) high. 

And say vaccine reduces covid death rate 100% (RR=0 n=1, 95% CI 0.27-15.34). I'm mature, time spent devoted studying teaching passions, I've met lot extremely bright wonderful people, lots awesome parties, met current hopefully permanent partner. Things like that. flu kill people rate COVID-19? No,

You don‚Äôt expect society pay low risk tolerance. don‚Äôt owe years life lost something kills 0.23% it‚Äôs victims. 

Unfortunately you, society bare living like long, they‚Äôll see things way. Hunker friend. We‚Äôre much longer. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm also assuming, yeah There's reason even newsworthy took placebo. may also newsworthy taken actual vaccine got hit bus. sound bad?  Well whatever want call it, unless add new outside inmates look like virus spread much more. Current numbers show one active case: sure threshold herd immunity especially high tightly packed prison would think numbers look encouraging controlling future outbreaks. think needs set definitions everyone agrees on. say stage 1 full wuhan lock down. stage 2 5 person family bubble, stage 3 everything bars huge venues open, etc etc

and articles come like say ""we're saying ya'll lockdown forever, we're talking stage X many months"" whatever Luckily, CDC clarified cumulative 15 minutes within 24-hour period. I'm sorry hear mum feeling alone. honest, social isolation older adults already huge problem even Covid-19. pandemic made worse. much hate thought mum feeling lonely, I'm worried well-intentioned people trying keep company exposing virus. said that, family might choose take calculated risks try see (since nothing life zero risk public health we're big risk reduction). strategy rapid tests days see bad one, foolproof. Consider certain tests particular come back falsely positive, someone might get test morning, get negative result day later, meantime - time test result, exposed course test pick up. family rough spot choose great options I'm sorry that. going take chance, best - logistically challenging - way would anyone going see would get tested isolate 14 days beforehand. Missed flight, maybe annoyed, small price pay get world back track pandemic.

And need quarantine negative test snuffed dog. think anyone wants throw someone quarantine 2 weeks dog snuffed something. Use medical test confirm deny dog sniff. Certainly.

In case Corona, don‚Äôt think get 100k without bulk old. 

In future pandemic, could wind whole new world shit regards peoples‚Äô risk tolerance.

Again, we‚Äôre talking society whole, individual risk assessments. Even placebo, vaccine never 100% protection, even gave 20% protection I'll happily take it. ... alternative ***not*** economic collapse. still arguing corporate welfare. Look South Korea, Japan, China, AUS/NZ, Europe... Honestly, look basically country world besides Brazil. aggressive shutdowns quarantine curfews multiple weeks, economies are, generally speaking, quite well circumstances - say, acting somewhat conservatively cautiously due to, know, global pandemic, poised regain stride conditions improve, simultaneously *not* forcing anyone (unless absolutely necessary, e.g. healthcare, law enforcement, etc) engage unsafe activities.

This economic quandary crisis *entirely making*. companies US riding close financial edge can't handle reduced operations revenue quarantine period *due pandemic* force people work get exposed covid result, free market allowed punish companies, workers hurt idiotic profiteering policies *absolutely* given pound flesh. may look bad, positioning Dallas relative June June fewer hospital beds used overall bandwidth surge, isn't. Still, focus El Paso. downright fucked.  eat nose? shouldn‚Äôt say this, skeptical lockdowns draconian measures isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúCovid denial‚Äù, common sense. 80k suicides? difference confirmed covid deaths excess death?
not convincing. I'm happy wear mask there's vaccine would wear one getting vaccinated?

I'm happy use seat belt, continue use brakes get fixed?

Simple explanation: vaccine magically perfect, happens fairy tales. around 50%. around 75% (the flu vaccine ballpark). 90% (like measles vaccine). vaccine close 99% there's still lot cases neighborhood, risk decrease much.

We need two things win war:

1. Get population immunized (ideally via vaccine, opposed rampant infections)
2. Get number infections pretty low (which definitely happen enough people immune via previous point)

When two conditions true live, take mask off.

\#2 happen automatically enough #1, know focus be. Basically, enough #1 #2 auto-clicks wear mask get flu vaccine.

Yes, flu covid totally thing. /s right, don‚Äôt think flu deaths useful except indicator know sure risk tolerance is.

I really think it‚Äôs around 100k counting way COVID official deaths counted. Reduce toll factor 3.5-4 go back total normal, people comfortable risk able mask-up.

I also think we‚Äôll see estimated death count vaccine without. people take vaccine, obviously significantly lower. 

Once vulnerable people opportunity take it, suspect give sense control now, confidence. Yep. Minds get made FAST. Wow! wedding property, make everyone quarantine property provide medical care.

People actually today boats private islands. since March.

Just expect society pay intentionally contracting/passing along virus long term impacts illness. owe disability something inflicted yourself.  Double blind mean unknowable. keep track participants administrators know trials ongoing. Numbers looking good, least vast majority population take seriously, follow requirements wear masks asked to. ‚Äúpeople‚Äù can‚Äôt ways. acted responsibly start with, wouldn‚Äôt mess. 

I‚Äôm sick tired dumbass people rely Facebook feed medical advice. 

I‚Äôm sick tired people think wearing mask assault freedom, stop light turns red, wear shoes shirt grocery story. 

I‚Äôm sick tired idiots think Fauci making money this. 

I‚Äôm sick tired dimwits think politician somehow enjoy grinding economy halt, enjoyment owning libtards keeping us getting back normal. COVID disappear, government anything. intelligent populace would caught advice oh...about 6 months ago. many people believe allergic saltwater?

You clearly idea talking about. depends consequences positive are. would pretty miffed kicked flight forced quarantine false positive. think earlier realize current trend sustainable shorter softer lockdown be. 

I fear much dire situation spring literally surging country southwest. remember right Pfizer ahead vaccine compared others. wanted say unusual frowned upon. People wear sick, right? would like adopted similar aproach west go totaly anti-mask second vaccine. Cuz sniffing a$$ , that‚Äôs why!...... Grocery stores confined small space people around breathing air long period time. yes, continue staying grocery store without wearing masks goggles, asking it. already cases coming malls public places. getting food starve death considered essential reasonable people, going grocery store cannot compared going airplane. There's much information - accurate inaccurate - one way stay top things design ""media diet."" could be, example, habit spend 30 minutes morning, maybe another 30 minutes evening, catching latest developments Covid-19. Also part ""diet"" choosing outlets going spend precious time with. Maybe decide check WHO's website 10 mins alerts, 15 minutes New York Times website, plus time local news outlet. way getting varied diet meets information needs, dedicating time pm, avoid trying top news throughout day. 15 k bad, 15k 177k tests, bad numbers march/April, lower , also made significantly less tests

Also numbers march mostly couple regions, spread throughout whole territory, way scarier, also easier manage

I'm saying ""everything fine"", I'm saying number alone mean anything, multiple factors play

PS: glad see Reddit always ready downvote someone expressing opinion Since better. even month virus sneaky. Americans think Eastern Europe whites-only third reich. important get approval children schools open get transmission kids. also Canada blows mind people think ""doing good"". Canada disaster like Europe USA. things going Europe wonder there's one person risk still alive receive Cases Canada growing. stabilized high level. Assuming ethics protocols followed (I can't imagne weren't), would fully informed. whole point double-blind studies no-one, researchers paticipants, knows received. Records linked patients needed - end study, adverse cases like this.

This standard practice.

For example unethical behaviour, lookup Tuskegee. Situations like drove modern ethics. Whoa, whoa, whoa, thought Canada everything perfect. Normalized consumption behaviors established food culture.  always. 1st stage Human trials often include placebo group.

This stage 3. vaccines, always include placebo group

I think confusing treatments vaccines. go healthy people Ah, sniffing things! Another pleasure made impossible social distancing. Oh really, look age demographics obesity
 Think country would function 60-80% staying home? Hey, North Dakota: sweat badly. Florida here. called ""Wuhan Pandemic,"" we're \*just fine\* now. Thanks question raising issue Covid-19 correctional facilities - big problem big repercussions communities whole. jumping offering advice presenting people facts (which scientists love do!) useful take step back ask questions people want communicate with. That's know facts - they've likely heard studies show masks save lives. start asking they've heard, choose follow evidence-based guidance. way hear tailor messaging specifically concerns information needs. mean aren‚Äôt seeing family members holidays? news scared little sheep. mean care family*. miserable, want people miserable are? Yeah ok, makes sense..

No. said. Please resort logical fallacies. 

I accused ""not understanding social economic consequences"" already made extraordinarily clear understand them. rest us going assess risk live lives accordingly.

Unfortunately huge percentage population objectively unfit make assessment. social distancing, attending indoor social gatherings without adequate ventilation airflow, wearing masks, properly washing hands. human contact 7 months thats you, brother

No, not. people made impossible safely around others. New Zealand problem. 

I would closer-to-normal social interactions people starting wearing masks told to, started social distancing told to, government provided regular continued financial assistance, quick reliable testing made cheaply easily available. Can't read article, Europe laws keen site. message says due laws Europe can't let Whoa started already? Yeah start adopting full shelters training up. overpopulation would best thing ever course does. People coming country potential new source infection, regardless many already gotten. going reach equilibrium like sort disease Brownian movement. course, never human vaccine coronavirus I'd wager difficulties. believe 12-16 demographic.

As says 16-year-old Katelyn Evans first receive first dose expanded trial. ego literally cannot handle words study. Correct I'm wrong theurupeutic methods advanced well deaths increase. Long term effects probably deaths lessened thanks new treatments Yes many places required face masks shutting businesses back then. fact WAY strict now, places saved tens thousands lives.

You spoiled snowflake think face mask draconian, think saving lives somehow freedoms. charge people murder. hope better luck did. Entitled Americans live without haircuts bars restaurants even week. mean living world black white, either ""back normal"" ""sitting asses forever"" see comment would make angry enough use verbal attack. thought two options I'd mad too. don‚Äôt see point. Nevertheless thinking Eli Lilly. briefing today, add notes changes numbers relevant news days. Shiiit also developed Narcolepsy 15 years age Mono! feeling concerned way Covid-19 many people going N activated... I'm sure masks work.

But tell me, enforce hundreds passengers wear masks?

How eat?

When use vomit bag?

Or, lights go dim, passengers sleeping, now, decide take mask blanket (which person behind you, next you, aisle already done). 

The way feel safe flying plane climate clean suit whole time. Trust me... color hospitals see GREEN üí∞ hope less stringent means - masks distancing literally *only* place go you‚Äôre terrified vaccine - grocery store &amp; pharmacy. Then, rest us go back living. important health providers know public aware of, need avoid perception political influence announcements. truly bad requires immediate redress, go ham reporting, otherwise may best limit announcements even approach zip code appearing sensational trying influence election. right especially needs keep mind direction going crazy reporting every time numbers dip threshold. know right follow advice, would seriously behoove downplay seriousness pandemic much left's best interests sensationalize pandemic. Neither extreme scientists fighting thing good, erodes public's faith evidence collection data analysis. Yes know don‚Äôt care dead people. That‚Äôs US one worse countries right now. Looking Poland graph recorded cases Finland quite interesting. Along year paid attention Poland country difficulties pulling numbers down. wave kept going country constantly hovered around 300 cases. development last weeks something next level.

Liberty rights never absolute. rights limits imposed avoid morons over-using rights negatively impacting others many times day think bad analogies  got downvoted last week saying probably completely back normal 2022. Guess what? Vaccine distribution takes time. 
Will things steadily improve? course. However, there's long fight ahead bring completely control. Don‚Äôt worry, selfish people celebrating New Year‚Äôs Eve droves spring equally awful Go essentials only, obvi. 

But see people going restaurants, bars, leisure shopping, nail appointments, lip filler appointments, partying yachts, throwing house parties, clubbing, going sporting events, traveling fun, staying hotels, going Disney world, like WTF. STAY YA ASS HOME. Well ironic So, countries still use it? isn‚Äôt allowed open? Even people wearing masks wouldn‚Äôt make need magically disappear 2022. It‚Äôs basically impossible keep levels low unless almost everyone following guidelines completely forever. *We*? Kushner hanged treason. don‚Äôt physically cannot leave home! diagnosed POTS months getting covid March!!! Yaaaay saving lives wanted bossed around every aspect myjfe, I'd join army. looks like interested bossing either Aren‚Äôt folks recently cancel pause trial vaccine? always wonder people manage get like 30,000 credit card debt newest phones taking vacations. guess attitude detaching reality burying head deep sand can. Here's latest case/death charts Oklahoma, running 7-day currently 29.64 deaths per 100k population. ranks 40th country terms per capita go lot healthcare facilities university, non-for profit, government controlled, profit. would nursing homes, hospitals, course smaller clinical.

The for-profit ones typically representative worst mix, followed government ones, non-for-profit organizations best. 

If we're talking specifically elderly care, for-profit bulk homes also widest range inequality. everything luxury retirement communities rough skilled nursing facilities people basically wasting away shared bedroom final years. 

The for-profit healthcare facility looks minimum they're required provide along money provided Medicaid equation make money it. 

It's sad reality also really great solution. Looking European estimates elderly care rates, they're far United States rates, actually fairly surprising considering much lower cost health care Europe whole. They're also running problem retirement population represents much higher proportion total population. problems have, however, increased bankruptcy rate caused healthcare costs. 

The ideal solution simply needing working society front costs non-workers. Halloween huge here. neighborhood went last year cops blocking streets families could walk around safely. friend handed 2000 pieces candy (10 Costco sized bags). Huge yard displays too.

And also true statistically unlikely 0.5% world die therefore people ""falling like flies"".

There‚Äôs contagious disease going around. Even ‚Äúmasters‚Äù disregarded rules knowingly unknowingly (USA‚Äôs Trump UK‚Äôs Boris) brushed death literally got best care world. Trump didn‚Äôt get hurt bad doctors learning disease every week. 


NZ parts Australia ‚Äúhome jail‚Äù ended succeeded- every world leader wants be. they‚Äôre back normal. 


It‚Äôs really, really simple idea requires tons effort *everyone*. Letting reign free (without home jail) means death everywhere- including health workers already doubt traumatized they‚Äôre seeing. Yeah sure, everyone want spend life homejail enemy. allowed unhappy it, God forbid complaining herd humanity. Let everything get it, let couple million die, declare victory.

What fuck wrong Americans?

Signed,
American democrat So, pretty much everything? Ouch hahahahaha, well life guess evidence back up, think food shortage know why. wondering, anything schools reopening no? I‚Äôve gotten good guitar I‚Äôm still depressed af  care freedom, that's fine. do. lot. think lockdowns ever intended fix everything. Fauci said beginning would go back lockdown regional flares popped up. reason I, American, preferred European model could've months relative normalcy may felt safe going stores, visiting friends family, etc. Instead, I've sitting home since March end sight 90% Americans seem care moved lives. summer, weakest period covid, 6 months building already 2nd biggest cause death America second heart disease. Winter coming, next year coming (with running start) good example Navajo country Arizona. Here's latest case/death charts rural, they're 214.07 deaths per 100k population. comparison US per capita average currently 66.19.

That ranks Navajo county 67th country terms per capita way people wear masks (not covering nose, constanly adjusting it), help much. reference familiar USD, that‚Äôs around 125 bucks per test. Average salary per month Warsaw, capital, 1k per month, salaries smaller cities obviously less February 7, 2020 Donald Trump: (00:47) 
This deadly. 5% versus 1%, less 1%. deadly stuff. 


Our stable genius knew half year ago.   Gimme break. kids learning quite well. learning better might in-person context. That's true son, least; notably, kids many friends. Maybe give raise. Excellent documentary... Tbf grandmas air raids actually dropped towns friends/family die I‚Äôd assume would different perspective It‚Äôs known around 80% mild asymptomatic requiring treatment/ hospitalization. problem millions infections, 20% get seriously ill becomes huge number. problem small percentage relatively mild case end issues like myocarditis lung issues afterward. also seeing increased evidence reinfections. ten months this, trying figure secondary issues initial infections big deal. don‚Äôt know. children develop long term immunity? don‚Äôt know. possible virus could go dormant retriggered- heroes viruses hide nervous system that‚Äôs get shingles chicken pox kid.  


This big feat pushing ideas like ‚Äòherd immunity‚Äô- don‚Äôt know long term immunity long term effects virus. 

70% get polio symptoms. 1% infect nervous system. symptomatic cases present respiratory/ flu like symptoms. 15-30 years polio, develop post polio syndrome resulting loss muscle strength, paralysis, etc.. even never presented severe case start with. Yes...the number cases jumped 253,134. That's total number cases. number cases jumped 8,500. Either correct. Accountability feels like attack ready acknowledge behavior harms others. Good, meanwhile belgium doctor one part crazy asking restrictions Brussels Wallonia. said big problem except enough funding hospitals. 


It's fieldday people shit people take covid serious. Election year +partisan politics + pandemic = trifecta.... wonder would happened hit non-election year. Try harder. choose ignore virus virus care. don‚Äôt know anything covid 19. HIV sort stop world tracks way made massive priority everyone focused year üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª louder people back Ya but, problem?

Most don‚Äôt want super skinny, it‚Äôs end world fat body. 

I‚Äôm saying, point think fat becomes big time issue, 30 BMI really good indicator that. Especially play sports lift weights.

Like, don‚Äôt look pics 50 years ago think, man, guy looks healthy. scary, sad frustrating. lives put hold years changed forever want protect 10% population 75+. Stay home reopen damage irreversible. positive part effecting children even remotely much age groups. APPEARS, flu deadly school aged demographic, much statement blasphemy appears true. hard know true case numbers estimates lend direction. know full long term effects course can't imagine much worse would losing large amounts children. I'm flu bro stating numbers pointing. honestly shocking anyone, point time, fully expected 'go away'.

The US President consistently told public go away, still holds message day. Even without vaccine. everyone follow guideline though? Surely people think follow everything government says. vaccines development. It‚Äôs fast vaccines ever developed. Deployment bear. assume won‚Äôt get vaccine September next year. Treatment improvements come slowly. virus. antivirals exist took decades develop. thing human population long time. going learn live still continue daily lives. Right mean social distancing wearing mask. Hopefully next year little open. reason people remove masks talk person 'can hear better', people dumb. Let put way:

Only small percentage infected single time. 5% people infected once, even every single one reinfected, would 5% 5% reinfected. 

So would start small fraction total infections would reinfected, even zero immunity. 

Meanwhile, barely testing anybody reinfections, even throwing strain. 

In words, there's massive undercount reinfections. 

SO fraction total first cases would reinfections even without immunity start with, combined massive undercount actual reinfections. 

And ZERO immunity. incredibly unlikely (it's spectrum course, people losing immunity time). 

Do see original comment wrong? wonder could even flare original infection. like worded that. nothing lockdowns normal life. Florida model example COVID response never lockdowns summer got cases go while. That‚Äôs bull Stitt. Worst governor ever. Also, small number reinfections unfortunately necessarily good news. reason joint probability catching covid two times (just simple statistics) much much lower early stages catching once. cases start popping either need vaccine seriously consider finding ways erradicate thing. Interesting article Harvard Business Review. elastomeric N95 masks seem promising, reusable, could help compensate massive unacceptable shortage normal N95 masks.

Our government institutions take heed advice!  worried getting covid probably worried giving it. don‚Äôt think Moderna challenge trials. common due serious ethical concerns considered due time sensitive situation find in. 1918 flu mutated much less deadly virus. COVID probably won't, deadly enough. really good friend die OD month back, RIP Nicky. I'll say him, dude knew going kill still wore mask day died whats everyone else's excuse? I‚Äôm there. President fuckwad led direction early stages, could probably good spot. Unfortunately virus here. firmly believe virus stay licking reach zero cases isn‚Äôt feasible. Maybe January, anymore. 

My opinion lockdowns relaxed, masks social distancing STRONGLY enforced, people given guidelines assess personal level risk react accordingly. dipshits spread around. They‚Äôll kill us all. could build boat row here. Honestly total instinct. stop every time though. people may even register they're states never them. sides, maybe? :P can‚Äôt that! See? Trump paying 4D Chess public health! He's thinking thousands years future, man!

^/s ‚ÄúI love you, Grandpa, stock market needs feed.‚Äù We'll seeing new records everything. winter‚Äôs got zombie army. you‚Äôre saying good hygiene bad illness? woulda thought. still reflect comment Osterholm think, double entendre probably intended, autumn likely see terrible fall. like done per-capita? saying lives matter? proportion them?

Both measurements value way. Wish could help im stuck though Imo really hope get good leadership finally get this. US outlier. Isn‚Äôt kind half country doing? mean look Dakotas. possible creationist still believe evolving. attended make vaccine SARS-CoV. According read, either never finished, didn‚Äôt work.

No human coronavirus vaccine. setting disappointment attitude going foster anti-lockdown sentiment keep blowing target dates  Soon enough cases, deaths, hospitalizations going highest since started. lower socioeconomic areas...

Yeah, that's said. shithole state.  Specifically what?

Edit: live alone, work home, found someone careful am, place we're remotely overwhelmed. 

What's fucking problem? spread us!  Might go SCOTUS. Freedom movement might interpreted include bowels. get flu shot every year. Maybe get Covid shot twice year. give blood every months, maybe could make normal thing give quart return get year's necessary vaccinations. friend works ASPIRUS convinced pandemic overblown covid wards basically empty month ago. Thankfully changed tune behaviors he's seeing results cases firsthand. lot people area direct experience. hear cases rising still see it. sucks, people really need burn hand believe stove hot. WFH: pry not. Remember primarily office worker perk, many office workers, there‚Äôs lot play people wanting WFH.

Grocery delivery: maybe. Imagine feel MN surrounded idiots. cost tens thousands dollars! worry, we'll take paycheck. Although first wave never properly captured due poor testing was, look europe case/death mirror graphs. truly incredible what's happened CFR, even IFR, actual CFR.

- Cat Videos able confirm tiny fraction reinfections. According virus samples 151 thousand COVID-19 infections sequenced far (out ~40.6 million confirmed infections date). pool patients ‚Äòconfirmed‚Äô reinfection possible (for sequence initial infection - required confirm reinfection - exists) likely smaller (perhaps significantly smaller) 151 thousand. linked article talking I'm sure I'll still get downvoted.

I live country strict lockdowns anything (quite opposite actually) subreddit full ""everyone goes murderer"", ""we lockdown till 2023"" ""immunity exist"" people downvote science support think ever since first cases reinfections came they've saying still stay home forever cause means immunity real all. course, academic kind scenarios useful. However, think send wrong message. may become endemic, people think: let's forget (what many anyway). words, they'll use highly speculative message justification adapting. say, let's wait science information vaccine, talk again. current strategy - let's discuss strategies one work. still understand people ignore basic science. I'd much rather wear mask ventilator. mean, like actual accurate number. I‚Äôve looked number it‚Äôs data flawed. accurate data set? mean, that's extreme example. I'm pointing nearly many hospitals overflowed media would believe. always fear. really know dive bars Coors it..

Edit: experts stated lockdowns making things worse better, bother listening ones. last time checked 15 upvotes whatever lol know it‚Äôs done academically; need arises. It‚Äôs something done every case would pointless assume people tested prior infection. 

There less confirmed reinfections people work stores. Weird things still happening entire time exactly problem. People believe Earth flat dinosaurs never existed. People believe vaccines cause autism evolution fake.  41 million, still stupidity back then.

Modern science can‚Äôt keep anti-Maskers anti-social distancing.

And dictators populist presidents, businessmen. \^ Appeal emotion fallacy: never said free-for-all. literally mentioned masks social distancing comment practice simple tasks daily life complaints, don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre ‚Äúthe one‚Äù saying shouldn‚Äôt free all. I‚Äôm talking masks here, I‚Äôm talking restrictive protocols crushing people mentally financially. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt think 100% people suffer decrease quality life MAYBE protect 0.01% people truly risk severe complications. Im saying it‚Äôs realistic get 0.01% severely risk population self-quarantine shut entire world long enough completely eradicate virus know little seems less dangerous people every day goes by. 

The changes quality life people experiencing range able go gatherings/bars/restaurants (minor impact, know), losing job/career/business able earn living start square one different field. People getting deeply depressed due isolation, people scared shitless something truth-be-told...might even worth afraid of. People facing financial ruin virus statistically speaking, probably wouldn‚Äôt cause symptoms common cold...if that. 

When started, ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù avoid overwhelming hospitals. become, ‚Äúeradicate virus‚Äù? alarm virus don‚Äôt know much overall low mortality rate given government free reign basic things day-to-day lives?

I‚Äôm tin-foil hat guy. I‚Äôm Trump guy. I‚Äôm even republican right-winger, people favor lockdowns expecting hundreds millions people make pretty substantial sacrifices undisclosed amount time save small percentage population that, risk sounding insensitive, doesn‚Äôt high quality life begin due age comorbidities make COVID real concern. Even could somehow enforce 100% compliance lockdown (we can‚Äôt), don‚Äôt know would effective long things opened back up. 

As hard admit, I‚Äôm starting think virus may nature‚Äôs way saying, ‚Äúthis planet‚Äôs resources limited people multiple serious diseases aren‚Äôt meant live 95 years old life support cocktails heavy drugs‚Äù. makes crazy asshole, it. mean disrespect, feel I‚Äôm realistic. Meh. I‚Äôve in-person college almost semester now. Everyone Reddit said students faculty would dropping dead. Guess what? 0 hospitalizations ~200 cases past 3 months. saw in-person COLLEGE could work (where people gathering every weekend cramped apartments) stopped giving shit. Sure make new guidelines loss life means.

By estimation, live least 500 years old life loss Covid 9000 million years sounds suspiciously like title another article posted Brazil here. Someone‚Äôs trying fear-monger.  mUh FrEEdoM many people get annual flu vaccine, doubt it. I‚Äôm pretty sure say we‚Äôre third wave, starters.

But news source owned Mormon church. England: used swabs

Wait, what?! Someone reused COVID swabs? Wow! 6 people upvoted, must true! probably ones yelling COVID AINT BAD meanwhile hospitals literally airlifting overflow elsewhere. cares hospitals aren‚Äôt full yet? Winter coming according experts, it‚Äôs going worst it‚Äôs been. hell? Let‚Äôs go shitty dive bars can‚Äôt live without coors light tap. Mask wearing social distancing provides pressure.

Next year we'll cheap fast paper tests everywhere put even pressure become milder. evidence memory cells developed thing. paper Cell months back suggesting cell immunity even mild cases. haven‚Äôt seen others, wouldn‚Äôt surprised exist confirming data. 

I don‚Äôt know live you‚Äôre talking ‚Äúbeing forced stay isolated.‚Äù Last checked nobody forced solitary confinement states anyway. course also 50,000 new cases per day nearly quarter million dead. maybe aren‚Äôt things right. 

I find interesting talk people that. always talk rights. Rarely anyone talk responsibilities. Given OC43 [8% mortality right circumstances, seems far likely. Problem asymptomatic carriers. won‚Äôt isolate they‚Äôve already passed on.  insulting people literally lost lives posture able go bars equivalent universe blood testing devices single use, ffs. also use broad definition death Covid. measure, responded terribly. United‚Äôs united suckiness. Herd immunity never viable option. promoted people care lived died. Well fair numbers COVID closer 0.01-0.02%. mentioned downplaying COVID-19 reason, near black death levels fatal, still historic pandemic.

Edit - 0.01% IFR percentage population killed COVID-19 based 1 million deaths vs population 8 billion people low ball estimate 1 million deaths undercount (undiagnosed deaths etc) 8 billion larger estimated current population size. That's fucking stupid. kind hour employee fronts thousand dollar credit card charges mega Corp working for? Like I'm sorry certain point person dipshit. Yes, people trying say death rate gone ton treatments, using past overrun hospital systems compared vacant hospital systems try show that. honest. republicans give damn mental health help anyone issues idea long take mutate 6o something less deadly? ideal going take years. Lots lower socioeconomic areas and/or recently legalized illegal immigrants working jobs supply healthcare coverage. Makes sense. Plenty job opportunities however. I'm thankful state opened did, got great paying job soon after. Actually, Sub-Saharan Africa one success stories pandemic. IFR .5 1 percent that's 5 10 times higher influenza. That's pretty significant. Nobodies holding gun heads making nurses. LOT jobs LOT dangerous nurse paying make feel good general consensus atm death rate 2 percent 140 million die everyone gets once, population 9th populated country russia 144 million, virus take russia. around level bad flu seasons next years...

Just accepting deaths normal really stupid. one, vaccine annual flu people get it. That's many deaths. everyone got vaccine, could significantly reduce deaths.

Second, still comparing COVID-19 flu know false equivalence. Life go back normal long around, whether want accept deaths.

And isn‚Äôt going complelty reopen coronavirus ‚Äúeliminated‚Äù

As Californian, good. believe true idea getting this, like sound it. hideous gibberish. Ugh.

Says much anything else context:  confirmed reinvention stats interesting. Many young (20s - 40s) lot seem intense cases second time around friend what's known *Bully*. 

Yes, child obesity problem name call kid like that.   Yes, second wave worse. Speaking experience, people seem care anymore. They're basically going like there's pandemic. Parties, get togethers, eating lunch social distance, etc. 

Sure, places mask mandates, one enforces them. Switzerland, we're required wear masks government buildings, public transportation, train/bus stops. People adhere proper mask etiquette (wearing mask chin, covering nose, etc) take masks soon get transit. one enforces regulations one getting fined punished it. 

It drives fucking mad. place restrictions zero followup ensure people following fucking thing? Zero accountability. Also, get started inept Swiss government relation covid. Everything implement fucking late. fire around us we're still sitting drinking tea. Go hangout outside friends keeping 6ft apart wearing masks. There's risk that. live parents, guess understand concern, there's reason home 5+ months social interaction. #WHO DA FUCK ISNT TAKING SERIOUSLY.

The incidence rate well understood, many individuals asymptomatic. previous poster making point bias towards capturing data worse disease progression, that‚Äôs true illnesses. don‚Äôt symptoms, don‚Äôt seek treatment, aren‚Äôt captured.

My point cannot draw conclusion reason. It‚Äôs reason may missing reinfections asymptomatic first time, therefore would mask potential reinfection worse. enough data.

The data indeed bias toward sought treatment first time got tested. agree, interpreting outcomes differently. lmao SMRT! or, Texas Abbot said bars could open, ""It's fine long 10% rate.""

Couple things account for:

1. Billionaires lost hundreds billions February March crash. Much ""gains"" there.
2. lot people quite billionaires lost billionaire status gained due stock market's recovery. 2019 705 billionaires US. Right March crashes dropped 614.

Let's look Forbes 400 October 2019 October 2020 get better idea much wealth gained billionaire group. Focusing top 400 prevents spoiling conclusion people added list. static 400 (though exact people mix change):

In October 2019, top 400 billionaires worth [$2.96 trillion compares October 2020's [$3.2 trillion sizeable increase. I'm sure us would appreciate \~8% increase networths year.

But even tell whole picture. October 2019 peak wealth group. stock market still went another 4 months crashed late February. Let's look way back machine see much top 400 worth mid February.

Looks like worth [$3.2 trillion otherwords, group, top 400 billionaires US maintained wealth. Better us done, quite huge gain wealth OP lead us believe. Please tell forgot /s ‚Äú200 mixed pricks‚Äù

Sounds like kind party üéâ Narrator: ""They not...take seriously"" Yes. violent criminals thing germs. ok cool 50 people town die, maybe *another* 200,000 over.

Constantinople largest city world beginning 6th century.

wait, everyone know cook suddenly to? metric/ statistic needs news.. number cases.

Ironic username. always cute someone opinion declares opinion fact. scientific source, assumption non virologist, try noob :D

That problem uneducated idiots, read articles opinions clue fact check think open schools gives false normalcy. Schools open, things ok. folks go back normal outside cases rise. many states report cases originate schools. like 30 kids quarentined positive, none go state recording bc exposed outside school. Luckily wearing mask social distancing easy do.  Guess calling everyone Poland morons count racism Reddit huh? sister COVID April got another antibody test (she‚Äôs healthcare worker) antibodies gone. still antibodies first antibody test July. lol lot already knew made pissed anyways. can't envision administration handled worse. someone sick pay chance benefits ill long while, really want covid.

Most Europe farther north continental US, would expect seasonal effects start hitting different dates. many people break rules, parts country never actually shut down. Many people never bothered social distance still hang friends go big parties. lot infections come Trump rallies.

Also, think needed said, obviously things 100% percent back normal.

People moving on. dude really bought bring meme life kill grandma Also, testing still get better. We'll better, accurate, rapid POC testing like strep help lot. Even get 10% population quickly, still means 10% pop act buffers spread, coupled millions people already covid. We'll get pretty good spot pretty quickly. another aspect looked at, [T cell      
*'The company's trials found people coronavirus tested negative antibodies went test positive cells - meaning people may immunity previously thought ""*       

So, antibodies fade, may nevertheless immunity via cells. But, tests coming out. believe small Idaho 1300 cases couple days ago? phone usage changed. trump article photo lol. everyone tested every death contributed Covid. thousands thousands deaths they're reporting. without doubt includes reinfections. 

If reinfections ""kind regular thing"" doctors would seeing KNOWN cases. Someone would test positive would say ""Yes actually already Covid one time back April"" doctor would go ""WOW. 40th known case worldwide among 40 million cases!""

That would happening regularly, would ""a couple dozen"" recorded cases.

But saying *are* lots reinfections, somehow happening undetected cases nobody recording them? Given 6 months STILL haven‚Äôt developed fast reliable test, don‚Äôt see spending months training thousands dogs would wasteful.  what's point going back school anyways would zoom classroom like what's point. get kids parents work. mean go I've stayed inside 4 months I'm going school get covid able talk friends zoom wear mask 6 hours. doctor right person help. symptoms subside probably clear, though. 99.9% people age w/o co-morbidities recover COVID it. Hobby stores, movie theaters, clothing retailers, shoe stores, comic book shops, bookstores... 

That seems it. thought protected God. Sure, let‚Äôs give everyone around kill family members join them. Good idea. Thanks posting link. read regular one due paywall. Checked bill rights. word pandemic. Agree. People terribly mislead tv death, CPR, etc. can‚Äôt tell many times I‚Äôve taken care someone critically ill needing intubation and/or CPR people ask ‚Äúare going need stay hospital overnight.‚Äù I‚Äôm extremely blunt meet family explain they‚Äôre machine breath them, requiring medication keep blood pressure up, whatever. 

This pre-covid it‚Äôs much worse now. Since places allow visitation families don‚Äôt see loved one don‚Äôt understand sick actually are. I‚Äôve called ‚Äúqueen DNR‚Äù colleagues I‚Äôm pretty good talking family end life issues getting understand CPR sometimes prolongs suffering certain cases. Thus, they‚Äôre made ‚Äúdo resuscitate.‚Äù mean don‚Äôt treat, means lose pulse allow pass peacefully without trauma CPR. I‚Äôve luck via phone people unaware sick loved one is. Telling someone family member‚Äôs pH 6.6 5 pressors doesn‚Äôt compute. it‚Äôs necessarily fault, it‚Äôs much easier visitation. home hospital break rule time someone actively dying. another hospital worked super strict didn‚Äôt clout go admin home hospital. 7.6 million doses per day... ~7.6 billion people (quick mafs)... ~1000 days... ~3 years release vaccines globally distributed, assuming maintain momentum. Herd immunity may closer 2 years. That's still pretty long time. 

Here's hoping companies able get game vaccines - I'd love think 2022. data: Hospitals, nursing homes, fire, police, medical facilities, utilities essential. businesses needed keep running. Obviously could closed things down, huge percentage workforce legitimately essential would inevitably harbor spread virus. 

How paper plant town makes Toilet paper employs huge percentage people. want closed?

I know clearly smarter you. live fantasy world. Hospitals actually laying staff. make money treating corona. elective surgeries make money put back burner. really? I've never heard post, ignorance part comes in. guess heard much burden disease Covid though. Either way, still think silly way determine severity disease. seems like extra unnecessary information. Like football commentator comes weird stat like ""this seventh game row he's thrown 3 touchdowns puts ranked 34th time category"" looks like around 24,000 excess deaths age group (trying find actual source CDC data), 5,700 counted COVID age group CDC well. can't imagine gap filled uncounted COVID deaths even remotely close. That's large number though, sort hint happening. *Former* chairman?

One hardline opinion?

One single news source never heard runs clicks add revenue?

Fear mongering?

Has ingredients #1 hit r/coronavirus

How people still eat shit beer ? data data, peace. What's causing large spike? Whole Foods? course. like smallpox became cold years...

The Russian flu epidemic becoming todays cold.... that's theory, fact!  Correlation Herd immunity viable strategy vaccine. way 100% people can, even will, get vaccine, hope enough get achieve herd immunity.

Herd immunity covid without vaccine completely stupid. great gets paid tens millions dollars promote lies conspiracy theories that, case, helping kill thousands people. correlation mask mandates cases stagnating declining, correlation masks cases rising.

Apparently, people get infected work masks mandated. listening Trump administration? ended April 1. joke 

loving social distance surprise Americans... worry it. propaganda. family Poland among people think Covid fake. TBH see big difference situation Poland situation midwest states. confused startled least 72 hours... Plot twist, grandma texts says COVID positive come -- kissing guys bars, example last Friday, thinks that's could gotten it. country even really cold weather yet forces everyone indoors several months (especially North Midwest)!

 We're already talking snow KC next week, awefully early us. Cold weather midwest quickly approaching.

Granted often get first freeze late October / early November, cloudier cooler weather already enough move people inside.

Edited clarity. literally bar grocery people drink mask off. Don‚Äôt worry college beginning fun solve under/overcount debate favor overcounting? numbers fake. remember reading excess death rates worst world long there‚Äôs pandemic going on, one free. hard understand? feeling defining characteristic super spreaders avoid tested so...  blamed fall vacation.

Number tests falling already school vacation (week 42). primarily tests asymptomatic people dropped sharply week.  Who‚Äôs going tell people don‚Äôt care? there‚Äôs vaccine, us going right back living normally. reason social distance there‚Äôs virus. This!! Wtf?!? government literally lying misinforming population, hey, gyms open!!! post satire, absolutely brilliant job mocking attitudes typically see reddit, deserves thousands upvotes.

If serious, regret tell unscientific attitude have. Lol blame church's. people going bars now. dont think virtual church ok people blaming church's things. tested positive killer piss, no. Otherwise, yes. course walk around without pants wants to. He's home, he? missing? pretty much everything... hope ""film hospital"" gang actively volunteering front line workers. exactly government's fault, poor health care system's. People idiots. spent July August could believe levels carelessness, stubbornness ignorance. People parties laughing loud covid.
Lots also believed (maybe still do) various conspiracy theories covid real thing.

And btw, friends organized birthday party weekend. Yes, fucking weekend record numbers infections diagnosed! beach. Why? apparently still allowed congregate outside. people look way skip rules, stupid birthday party, matter one among may giving potentially lethal disease!

So - results summer stupidity. absolutely leave house lol. city, stores open, including art stores, clothing stores, hobby stores, beaches parks available, eat outdoors restaurants (and given it‚Äôs 80s-90s last weeks, imagine stay way while). Now, take advantage parks beaches don‚Äôt really feel safe indoors around bunch people masks off, that‚Äôs choice making. go fancy private school? free public schools, even virtual ones, teach difference you're.

If care kids, would spend tuition money helping volunteering organizations help kids whose parents working. fake concern tool shit teachers, working hours ever. Low standard hospit care Poland...? comment seriously throwing me. guys one best Healthcare world? ""europeans"" reddit use nordic countries examples none actually Healthcare like Nordic countries do....? 

I'm seriously asking here. Depends want compare. gut feeling whole field statistics originally invented take hard data massage fits preferred narrative. (Unfortunately, yet found time massage existing hard data enough back claim.)

If wished feed Conservative narrative, could also count 14 days country-wide lockdowns 14 days life lost everyone, compare average 3 days life lost everyone due virus (with total disregard much higher number lives days lost virus spread even uncontrolled already did, course).

Too many things take consideration numbers really useful except flimsy reason one view another, least numbers. Considering infectious bile comes mouth every time opens it... CDC figure obviously error (disagrees 7-day case figure). Good catch!

It would correct figure 7 day rolling average, using rectangular window (i.e., divide 7). that's clearly text description says. Last heard, someone correct outdated information, small number cases humans transmitted virus pets, 0 cases animals transmitted people US individualistic. It‚Äôs rights, I‚Äôm anything don‚Äôt want to, etc. Also, millions people Asia wearing masks years. People may think ‚Äúthird world‚Äù countries like Vietnam Thailand would falter time like it‚Äôs clearly U.S. that‚Äôs regressing civility. mention, healthcare affordable SE Asia almost anywhere US. I'm sorry. America. information readily available shoved directly faces pay attention news politics even sub. good informed, way elicit emotional reactions otherwise intelligent readers. got invited costume BBQ bar. believe it. know lot local cases likely state live northern ky get lot travel ohio. Stuff scary. go wedding outside reception open barn . Even people wearing masks even though signs everywhere. people supposed stay seated wait staff distributed food people kept going up. Idk like are. people seem resisting. much right beginning, months ago. Next fall pretty safe bet true normalcy probably starting seeing Spring 2021 wow, straight wishing death upon parents, high class citizen. Gain freedom? already free. today, sort of. gain it, lose first place. losing gain again? feeling election, lot folks stop instinctively politicizing things reopening plans gain momentum. discrepancy likely related least part starting points. NY started lower case count Wisconsin also pretty rough run beginning pandemic. takes virus spin up, takes even longer portion population kind immunity (whether temporary permanent). There's also likely ""social immunity"" factor, NY hit aggressively outset, New Yorkers likely adopted habits keep safe. finally people trusting science people used like OhH VaCCiNe mAkE dIE. like come 30k people getting test serious problems. Agreed. It‚Äôs even worse non-science news sites pick up, spin them, create even fear. Biggest problem virus constant fear-mongering spewed media. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Respiratory illness joke. pneumonia three years ago caused strep bacteria things. Shortly recovering diagnosed Narcolepsy life changed forever. Many studies pointing sort infection root cause debilitating condition. would strongly advise anyone avoid illness sort potential. 1. SARS-CoV-2 one main reproductive method. human body. human potential Sars-CoV-2 factory. humans walking around infected, SARS-CoV-2 air, higher probability infection, stronger epidemic.

2. coronavirus likely seasonal maximum infectiveness lethality winter. 

Putting one two together:

The last time fought coronavirus started 0 cases peak winter. weakest possible infection ( human factories) environment becomes increasingly hostile (winter-summer transition). 200k Americans died.

The peak summer already passed. head coronavirus season 50k new c19 factories every day.

But matters November 3rd. even put car gear yet. still bitching wear seat belt. sugar coating, ever thought kid would feel, especially young age? Maybe fat eating much illness, never know. report negative tests first place? get it. Kind way since 21st century. family moved Cali Oregon. Pseudo-intellectual? wear masks ever? curious people getting twice avoid activity. everyone wore proper masks world manageable we're kids coughing everywhere season yet candy scavenger hunt around house experience different. simple no-lasting-immunity hypothesis, correlation different infections driven directly host-pathogen interaction, course infection would depend factors (initial viral load, overall health particular moment, etc.). 

Right kind seen, sample sizes small.

There one caveat though -- even hypothesis one expect time individuals get worse worse, even though infections independent. internal organ damage virus causes. got relatively healthy 30s 40s, miserable time never hospitalized, still got mild heart/kidney/lung/neurological/etc. damage. Next time get it, already somewhat compromised state, end hospital, sustain heavier damage. significant health issues. Next year get it, get damaged even high-risk group serious cardiovascular problems. fourth infection sends ICU. 

That sort thing. 

There relationship infections terms host-pathogen interactions, get worse worse subsequent one. ask old person was? Ask doctor Coronaway right you. think it, reddit sure full unique jokes Trump. Never heard one twice. totally right. 220k dead enough... Medical workers plead fucking mongoloids wear fucking masks. large portion American population absolutely useless.

Age 9: shoved ground dude robbing corner store. 

Age 13: Bullet flew house dad (cop) shootout two armed robbers house across street.

Age 14: friend got smacked around robbed dudes deployed rear-ending trap. (Later arrested, ages 23, 26, 31)

Age 23: Randomly attacked 4 tweakers thought somebody else.

Age 38: Essential employee goes 20+ strangers' houses every week, never caught covid. 

Guess I'm statistical anomaly. Haha based I‚Äôm disappointed. Still gotta multiple wipes That‚Äôs works. matters initial exposure. keep initial exposure (e.g. properly wearing mask, flushing nasal cavity saline immediately known exposure) reduce viral load early stage infection (e.g. getting enough sleep, taking effective anti-viral meds one), help body‚Äôs ‚Äúinnate immune response‚Äù keep bit better fighting virus ‚Äúadaptive immune response‚Äù kicks in. lower initial exposure give body crucial extra days amount virus builds level it‚Äôs wrecking organs.

But point tested positive, you‚Äôre already least 3‚Äì4 days infection, amount virus circulating body many orders magnitude larger (thousands millions times virus) possible dose could get breathing more. Even making someone covid positive isn‚Äôt going make much difference point. reason covid positive people stay home (a) make sure get enough rest, (b) avoid infecting someone else. danger really they‚Äôll exposed themselves.

It‚Äôs sort like worrying travel bans might stop extra 5 10 infected people entering country, already tens thousands infected people inside national borders traveling around freely national testing strategy broken hope detecting them. thinking thread way home work, high school ""hick"" kids hung confederate flags trucks. Everyone hated thought stupid, know controversial genuinely racist. never saw say racist things non-white students school, part feels like stupid grasp seriousness displaying flag.

People get it. children going hard lives. Climate change going destroy planet next 2 decades. deal worse things trick-or-treating. Stop babying them. time prepare them. going need tough skin survive. problem flu vaccine get body target parts virus can't without. Versus something like measles virus, one done immune system targets heavily reserved part virus.

We get common cold coronaviruses though. hopefully vaccine account this.

Also, virus go circumventing bodies fail safes (and maybe immune system) certain manners also may complicate vaccine development. Similar still vaccine HIV, likely extremely difficult develop one virus specifically goes immune system.

Also, whole socialist thing completely accurate. Argentina corrupt democracy ruled leftist coalition supposedly takes care poor, that‚Äôs blatant lie.

PeakProsperity video study. Want say \~20 people it.

It people 20 years. became infected common cold coronavirus handful times. couple people averaged one per year.

My opinion, body treats Cov-2 like CC coronaviruses severity lessening time staying variable. Then, vaccine really work get immune systems treat virus differently?

If not, people start taking better care themselves. Even if, drugs like Ivermectin there. Well well well, consequences (government) actions... 

Is surprise? Pretending something exist make magically exist. suddenly zombie movies (where US totaled everyone makes stupid choices) make lot sense.  3M even know term 3rd world countries didn‚Äôt take sides cold war?

-are hospitals much better prepared beds, ventilators etc. Note, UK 20k cases per day, 4k per day back 1st lockdown warehouses converted hospitals.
-or virus laying base infecting larger population atm ICU flood coming coming weeks? really wish people meant Biden would fix everything they're dumb think made hurt Trumps chances. also outliers people sick extended period time, maybe someone manages avoid disease while. virus might spread one city another every trip, every would.

I'd guess virus would slower start, would likely reach every corner earth long anyway. They're professional sports team, games training work. different factory making widgets.

However, spectators can't attend. mean families care getting smaller every winter. keep touting herd immunity families die since reinfection make weaker weaker. Ok?

We're getting frigging steamrolled already, we're like 3 weeks autumn. winter suck much. think vaccine dampen 2021? tested positive virus today. 34/m. Took test Sunday, feeling pretty sick Saturday bit Friday night. felt much better Sunday feel fine now.

On Saturday felt bad, bad headache day, lot fatigue, appetite, producing mucus. Overall felt like mild flu 1 day. suppose worst over, symptoms come back harder days come? too. people area take masks cough too. intelligence lacking One thing failed take account know total number people infected 1918 H1N1 virus end dying hospitalized. 
We know. way test people back decades that.

What know contemporary flu seasons, even bad ones like 2018, 60% people completely asymptomatic, vast majority are, mild illnesses. 

Chances are, ability test back then, able see lot cases asymptomatic mild enough confused cold allergies, much like Covid now.

However, since numbers available 1918, assuming cases happen hence covid far mild, numbers statistics available today show mild even asymptomatic infections. get 10% weed store. time point im veteran. 2 days? employed nurse, go back work infect patients, 12-day vacation spreading around community? Fuckkk hospitality industry employs huge portion population poverty wages huge problem itself. Many people would‚Äôve solid manufacturing jobs previous eras, ripped away, unions weakened years ‚Äúpro-business‚Äù shitbag politicians. Also, restaurants bars barely pay employees. expect customers subjectively pay them. 

Finally, course think people held accountable actions, suggest restaurants bars huge disease transmission sites pure bullshit. ""if ever need something, day night, hesitate call"" mixed feeling this. working private company absolutely paid minimum wage more.

So disect post:

""I think you‚Äôre little emotionally invested narrative paying attention data context. Infections deaths starting tick upwards, Sweden‚Äôs active cases ever before. That‚Äôs data. Interpret will. rate growth increasing.""

I think downvotes listen advice. Stating Sweden active cases ever take account increase testing. unlikely active cases, even lot confirmed cases.

I however think downvotes unnecessary, even disagree ""more active cases ever before""-part still think good quality comment added value conversation. wish people stop downvoting disagree instead vote according quality comment.

I mean, said ""How herd immunity working, lol"".

Despite seeing town plates every time leave home, best metrics country, terms rolling 7 day new cases per 100,000, positivity, hospital utilization. Tired fighting people something childish.

User name totally checks :D  Scientific reason invading Iraquistan. Viruses care stayed vigilant 6 months, lapse society grow. Much like old stock broker adage, past performance guarantee future performance. However viruses like army, society power reverse trend following guidance healthcare experts. nurses doctors risk lives multi layer PPE video chat loved ones eat home. countries fail utterly need snuff news behave sensibly.

It's like utter confusion school shootings rest world facepalms.  eradicating virus never target, slovakia island. Main point avoid complete lockdown. Yeah TRUMPS America! Maybe would helpful sub would understand intrinsically tied politics covid US. 

Your ban taking dumb actually detracts usefulness sub. seems like every time looked at, going back May, actual deaths 40-50% reported deaths time analysis. safe rule thumb point whatever death number hear media, increase 50% want know many actually died. yes, we're 340,000 deaths already.

Personally wish creating models would start far better estimates actual deaths massive undercount reported cases. time see media story model predicting X number deaths 1-2 months now, think useless number exceeded least month before. Lol yep. thought advocating intentionally losing. stupid? think people paid enough live? Okay, then. I‚Äôm proudly stupid.

It strange ignore reality logistics make virtue signaling pronouncements. almost like actually anything value add besides agreement choir. Cuomo it? Also, averaging hot spots, city centers people closely packed. average entire state say handle it, well sure hospitals able others can't depending population density. 

So unless intuitive program patient readily transported rapidly another hospital that's unencumbered appropriately trained staff well ventilators also screwed, people pile denser areas unable get medical assistance.

At moment, entire state Wisconsin state 1395 hospital beds, 1600 ventilators. That's whole lot. already taken. numbers looking see actually handle it. Czech Republic jist reported 12000 new cases almost 100 deaths (translates 370.000/2.977 USA numbers)

Meanwhile they're saying 10.000 cases unsustainable Germany daily hospital work disrupted doctors nurses need take care Covid19 cases. fun sitting home twiddling thumbs next years virus going completely eradicated, even vaccine, possibly even within lifetime. get vaccine 95%+ people going back mostly normal routine. option. That's really flawed study. 

It's 1 hospital system, place overrun March (New York), saying IFR lower back getting overrun. 

That's good evidence all. fact, evidence death rate higher medical capacity can't keep up. Bring night! let freeze :( start this, thinking 3-6%. 

That might thought, epidemiologists range 0.5-2% since Wuhan. comment numbers deaths continue stabilize go down. Looking current month data pretty relevant trend topic.

Positivity rate, hospitalization rate, sorts overlays would relevant well.

The initial comment oversimplified analysis, opted keep things simple. cite source provide evidence claim? 'believe' fits narrative want believe? genuinely asking. Yep, sadly true.

Nurses care everybody, even worst us. Criminals, murderers, drunk drivers, people sexually harass them. many ways, best us. wild thing is, hasn‚Äôt even gotten *really* cold yet places everyone forced indoors months time (North Midwest especially) buffoon.  Best look hospitalisation rates, testing rates really whack due capacity backlogs. ex keeps taking son, goes households, eat.

Meanwhile, JRE's fan base still take covid srsly even Jamie tests positive. Lmao coronavirus side effect transporting people places need go subsidised cost, I'd agree you.

But reality, coronavirus exists kill people, buses exist transport people places need go subsidised cost. side effect busses sometimes kill people, much lower rates cars. cars seatbelts airbags require license operate.

Nobody coronavirus transport somewhere, subsidised tax payers, except Donald Trump Walter Reed. fair, one knows Jan 2021 going look like, winter might turn OK, might disaster, pretty sure least one vaccine would roll really plan keep waiting. unlikely plan made right could still relevant then. Culturally speaking, much different United States Canada, same. moving goalposts...

No, understand 4th grade comments ago, conceded admitted ICU today would probably died 1918 technology medicine keeps people ICU alive, exist.

Yeah, sure, even come percent cases go ICU. said 38% people ICU 50 (a demographic represents like 80% population) said somehow proof virus bad 1918 post source showing stat contradicts argument sudden irrelevant discussion??

You contradict argument. said number. number mean anything nothing indicate chances infected person admitted ICU. said sacrificed greater good staying home 5 months unemployment. one asking that. government recommending that? 

The government recommending that. entire restaurant &amp; bar industry ice right now. restaurants realistically cover costs without many people establishment operate safely. impossible position owners workers, problem can't solved individual choices.

The government spend money front reduce infection spend money back end via Medicare &amp; Medicaid treat infection. We're going pay either way, pick path causes least disruption &amp; suffering. COVID deadly compared pandemics history alot nasty sub-lethal effects like long term brain fog, heart damage (up 80%) seem get much attention.  Sure, right ""compensate fairly"" victims family members crimes. ""compensate fairly"" cost trial, cost free attorney, cost guards salaries, costs incarceration medical costs.

Then claim ""fair compensation"" Also, COVID Tracking Project‚Äôs Hospitalization information:

Do believe without lockdowns would seen empty US airports? Trains running percent normal service? changes Swedish population made?

Also families stay together period.. full lockdown might prevent impossible fix suggestions rules now.

So christmas lockdown best lockdown have. problem lockdown hard keep enforcing lockdown 2 months.

I think slowly introducing new measures delay inevitable severe restrictions better. unfortunately christmas.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil‚Äôs President Jair Bolsonaro high-ranking health official said Wednesday federal government buy COVID-19 vaccine China‚Äôs Sinovac, one day health minister said would included nation‚Äôs immunization program.

The apparent about-face, following anti-China social media commentary Bolsonaro‚Äôs supporters, thrust open simmering debate vaccine policy president key governors, exploring alternatives AstraZeneca vaccine federal government prioritized.

On Tuesday, Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said meeting state governors ministry would buy Sinovac vaccine include immunization program, along AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine developed Oxford University. inclusion would contingent approval drug regulator Anvisa, said.

The Health Ministry Wednesday announced Pazuello tested positive virus, making latest Brazilian official, including Bolsonaro, so.

Sao Paulo state biomedical research center, Butantan Institute, testing Sinovac vaccine, Governor Jo√£o Doria said hopes regulatory approval end year start vaccinating people January.

But Bolsonaro said Wednesday Pazuello misinterpreted meeting Brazil‚Äôs governors.

‚ÄúFor sure, buy Chinese vaccine,‚Äù Bolsonaro said social media, responding supporter urged buy vaccine.

Later morning, health ministry official Elcio Franco said vaccines would forced go federal health approval channels, government interest ‚ÄúChinese vaccines.‚Äù

Doria, announced Tuesday federal government agreed buy 46 million doses Sinovac vaccine, took exception stance Wednesday.

‚ÄúThe vaccine going save us, save us all,‚Äù told reporters.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ideology, it‚Äôs politics, it‚Äôs election save us. It‚Äôs vaccine,‚Äù added Doria, viewed potential opponent Bolsonaro 2022 presidential elections.

Brazil among world‚Äôs hardest hit nations pandemic, 5 million infections nearly 155,000 COVID-19 deaths, according Reuters tally.

The inclusion vaccine, called CoronaVac, national vaccination program nation 230 million people would major success Sinovac could one world‚Äôs first immunization efforts coronavirus.

The Brazilian government already plans purchase AstraZeneca vaccine produce biomedical research center FioCruz Rio de Janeiro.

The Butantan Institute said Monday preliminary results late-stage clinical trials CoronaVac 9,000 volunteers proven two-dose Chinese vaccine safe. Butantan director Dimas Covas said efficacy data released trials completed.

Bolsonaro, far-right leader drawn close U.S. President Donald Trump, made disparaging remarks China past, even though Brazil‚Äôs largest trade partner.

He minimized gravity virus criticized lockdowns governors Doria enforced getting downvoted comment, agree Italy went hard initially certainly point view heard expressed often. major reluctance seeing right fact Italy's economy - already one shaky Europe fundamentally tied tourism - precarious position. Additionally schools closed since March, making Italian students among suffered educationally worldwide (up point). 

Everyone listening science knows need restrictions, nobody wants get saddled ramifications almost certainly come along it. Additionally Italy small right-wing faction government (national regional) nearly form additional lock-down equate mask-wearing removal freedom. Shutting borders effective policy - actually discriminate coordinated. means tight border outsiders exact procedures rules outsiders, including citizens living abroad want come home. exceptions. anyone.

Shutting borders basically national equivalent quarantine. like 'small' quarantine needs tight effective, national equivalent needs tight well.

If shut border groups others differeing rules, means get slips often. People dodging rules rerouting another country, overseas citizens bringing infections back etc, people quarantining come non-risk countries etc.

Some countries Asia basically cut outside connections fine

The equivalent basically gap-walled computer - i.e. standalone computer physically connected outside network. there's entry, can't introduce virus magically system lol even close. Look graph? It‚Äôs Europe thought cases stabilized bit Denmark Norway. Finland one big cluster caused big increase, might stabilizing around 200 Hey same. Utah, checking in. Yeah, bit bad translation there. Sucks people need get married. always bigger party Covid over. language! Trump goes ""see, europe terrible. right along"". long she‚Äôs try bite people, that‚Äôs great news!! Canada currently seeing growth like EU is. Makes difference me, I‚Äôm getting plane anytime soon. Stop giving people voice running news stories. uh, not. [Repubblica famous chart Authority gives (look Incremento casi totali. means Daily New Cases). seems like vague incredibly difficult value measure accurately. Especially enough murder charge. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre charge anything. happens lockdown? Would country collapse? Probably not. Hence lockdown optional. mean? 

They saying lot people died expected compared officially attributed covid  amazing bad public school failed you. understanding is: antibodies work ""docking"" piece virus. marked antibody, immune cells target virus destruction. epitome ""docking"" site. epitome virus looks like epitomes cells body, antibodies start docking tissue cells immune system start attacking them. call autoimmune disease. basically correct. study found cats susceptible, along ferrets mustelids, dogs chickens. one study, though, months ago. also two dogs tested positive past spring, one died, like 17 years old recently lost owner virus quarantined two weeks, may stress rather virus. (actually uncommon dogs die soon owners do, despite otherwise healthy.) Fuck Texas teachers medical risks! Texas probably. could mean that, could also simply mean vulnerable died first Hey that‚Äôs me, lost senior year, graduation, freshmen college experience üôÉ way. healthcare system close collapse regions back spring. case yet. lockdown absolutely necessary. hopefully dont catch COVID give anyone else. Polands far right movement picking pandemic pretty cyberpunk tho What? article behind times like decade. wonder stopped reading CNET years ago. big pharma go poorer countries experiment people?  Yep, I'm little concerned controversy J&amp;J come across, like cancer stuff. angry I'm stating facts position. like saying ""typical good person guilting murder torture, people like like"". good day, sir. China completely dropped reporting? It‚Äôs like automated system picking 3-15 everyday report. Gotcha, makes sense. cure would nice though. only. mechanical nature eating possibly dislodge virus particles reduce detection, think main reason food particles temporarily cover virus swab getting food virus, leading low sample count higher chance testing negative. tell act like invincible sign receive dose. still supposed use mask, avoid contact, etc.  person died that, weren't, trial's fault. risk vaccine makes disease worse unvaccinated. happened before. LOL. know Chinese Communist Party cannot trusted. mean it‚Äôs fairly common misconception wanted clear confusion anyone sees far know, self-imposed airlines, ""strong recommendation"" government agency COVID leakage told about? Yep. look Black Lives Matter protests hundreds thousands young black people gather closely together, march, shout weeks end go back spread coronavirus older vulnerable relatives. Well said mate ones driving cases locking us down. üëç Florida needs ramp testing rates again. 20-30k day enough evidenced test positivity rate.

I wonder badly Florida get affected next several months. Winter mild (and practically nonexistent south Florida). Regardless, full reopening without precautions bad matter climate like Pink-eye pandemic lot peeps upvoted must true lawsuits damages individuals. would seek law overturned. know placebo is. wrong say placebo vaccine. fake vaccine.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.... One large event state away, attended ton people state north it, hundreds pop retail bars security staffed folks region including ND, police presence pulled every corner SD including northern areas cross state line regularly. one large event.  Skin rashes common symptom, happen. Often skin rashes bodies response virus, necessarily linked covid-19. Yes, easier, hospitals lot full now, health system overwhelmed smaller areas, can't ambulances people need urgent treatments travel hours hospitals full Lombardy, empty Sicily (this case first wave)

Now cases spread less evenly easier treat hospitals full everywhere, also easier track contacts positive people, also, highet number tests prevents lot uncontrolled spread virus

But again, good, situation starting slip control, know control growth exponential

My whole point yes, numbers highest peaks since start pandemic, opinion are, least should, able contain it, government bad job, people overall good precautions point

Edit: maybe I'm little optimistic, surprised optimism, far worried pessimistic March  nd? surprising. must admit sceptical lockdown Victoria, Australia going work reducing cases near zero, expecting either take long ""stuck"" case clusters refused go away made everyone lose faith. far, appears working well reducing case numbers.

Still, something similar Spain seems like mad gamble, still sceptical could work there. Spain, start much worse place (in terms cases/population), already endured strict lockdown first months lot people businesses exhausted, lot political tension (lots different political parties power, almost favour measures, take every single opportunity make big political mess it), know ready culturally/institutionally something like this, already high debt terms GDP, borders multiple countries high case numbers, etc.. Young people pay car insurance example less experience get accidents. surprising you.

It's hard young politician young people less experience. gain wisdom experience living working longer time. would opt second sometimes policies dictated political calculations reasoning Media literacy crucial too. nailed lot grifters making bank well waste time caring enough make distinction? Third wave. Third surge. don‚Äôt understand logic?  Please tell Onion Okay obviously meant vaccine, still. Also triplets age 60

this one different others dont know either. Media eerily quiet. think arguing among themselves. Dr Merkel right warned us last week angry state leaders arrogant listen. Shaggy 2 Dope titrates perfection. Violent J watches immense adulation. voice dissent here, CDC put horrible spot pandemic. leaders political appointees managed horribly run White House next useless. CDC can't solve worlds problems itself.

We literally watched White House bury CDC guidelines say might well start cause restrictions see light day. that? sounds like u want another one happen lmao much testing clinic downtown ran tests. wait.. shouldn‚Äôt running tests point. running tests. well done implemented, maybe measures need disruptive. Korea Taiwan could examples follow. Even Japan. 

Of course, many politicians, specially developed world, prefer false debates instead taking accountability lack resources avoid worst (like hard lockdowns second waves) actual debate causes consequences. People like like like cheese. Typical vegan though trying guilt others personal choices thinking they're better everyone around eat plants. Yikes learning live it. live overseas, virus eventually make way back home. Unless you‚Äôre country already second wave. vaccine doesn‚Äôt end pandemic.

Thankfully vast majority churches mandate masks social distancing.

There's thousands maybe tens thousands church services every week West Virginia. state linking 18 outbreaks church services extremely surprising troubling. know subreddit got source took placebo. reports subject say ""unidentified source"".

No lockdown perfect always people need work. Hence caseload matters.

Even placebo, one death mean much. vaccine going 100% effective. first vaccine month away EUA pipeline right behind Don't, hell ride way deal Nov 3 data looking at? Afaik, news companies use different definitions ready,

Personally Ready means licensed taken US, doesnt matter available everyone US, wont happen months after.

The Vaccine accepted November early December, vaccine wont widely available April(what fauci said) US. need bring two days could spread /s

Just keep closed. Can‚Äôt make declarative statement one case see you‚Äôre coming state reporting deaths far back April.... Huh, breaking news people die every night? Wow! Changed life! woulda known pulling straight arse. That's issue.

Maybe risk same, maybe order magnitude less. know. guessing. I‚Äôm wiping Pitt map. I‚Äôm also Cleveland. People like can‚Äôt get control wouldn‚Äôt counted COVID case without positive PCR test. COVID precautions taken limit spread case may well been, untested would‚Äôve contributed COVID case numbers. 

Transmission viral URI would go people upper respiratory symptoms isolated themselves/ wore masks. think would useful compare number people died, total population America.

2,500,000 years life lost divided 220,000 people died = 11 years life expectancy lost per person died would 100% better meth head. actually seems like good guy, there's fucking way he's worse person DeSantis remember correctly article read, deadly first became common cold. People like can‚Äôt get control Estimates 1918 flu 4 6 times less deaths happened due advances medical technologies. Based comparing death rates respiratory diseases then. Smoking doesn‚Äôt put others risk genius. It‚Äôs personal choice. Getting people sick isn‚Äôt. Everyone take extra precautions, otherwise arguement essentially ""fuck you, stay inside 60 pre-existing conditions"". Walking around without mask still infect someone risk wearing one, asymptomatic cases common. don‚Äôt care Canada has. It‚Äôs remotely
Comparable United States. is. Like, he's basing reopening status number *trees* county! Seriously, virus? ‚ÄúAntivirals?‚Äù

I‚Äôm getting tired people claiming ‚Äúantivirals‚Äù respiratory disease. Sure exists, they‚Äôre largely thought useless.

The three FDA-approved neuraminidase antiviral flu drugs available United States, recommended CDC, include: oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), peramivir (Rapivab).

Spend little time reading drugs. provide little benefit, usually must administered within 24-48 hours symptom onset effect. Additionally, antivirals prolifically susceptible resistance mutation.

Ok buddy üëåüèº Genuine question. lot people understand pathogens spread respiration works? friends won‚Äôt use public restroom (pre-pandemic) due germs yet they‚Äôre fighting wearing mask want go like normal. coworkers taking virus seriously yet think wearing face shield without mouth/nose covering dandy. don‚Äôt get it. need PSAs blasting show 3D versions germs spread via coughing/sneezing? real empathy problem US. one cares anyone themselves, seems. would think Halloween, holidays, would fairly safe long go parties. Yes, wonder point highlighting uninteresting statistic is. There's need childish insults. Let's least try act like mature adults. said right start, I'm pro-masker wear surgical masks everywhere go, insults ironically ignorant. Let state one time record, pro-masker understands importance wearing masks. Fabric face coverings masks. Sorry hurts feelings, literal fact.

Regarding clinical trial:

1. Cloth masks significantly higher infection risk control, status quo hospitals Hanoi - masks, sometimes mask, etc.
2. Penetration cloth masks particles almost 97% medical masks 44%
3. wrong pathogens smaller COVID. tested 17 different respiratory illnesses INCLUDING SARS.
4. completely ignoring direct contact infection vector COVID live surfaces 28 days ideal conditions. Cloth-maskers frequently touching mask depositing virus surfaces touch.
5. six-foot social distancing recommendation based everyone wearing medical masks cloth.
6. Contrary, study shows neck gaiters actually increase droplet counts.

Can provide single peer reviewed study provides evidence back claim cloth masks work?

There shortages surgical masks excuse use simply cannot afford them. choose remain ignorant cloth masks that's prerogative, would mean virtue signaling cloth-masker cares going motions give shit everyone else's health. Sure, previous media fearmongering like crack wall trump sledgehammer it. Facts üíØ take virus seriously without locked down. think may unable use word P l ic here.

Washington 2267 tested deaths. Assuming 0.5% IFR gives 450k infections. 100k cases implies they've tested 1/4.5 infections. reinfection would found tested times, expect 4.5^2 =20 times actual reinfections. would put number 2,000, 0.5% total infections. population Washington 7.6 million, implying 6% population exposed.

Covid also acute viral infection targets lungs, brought back era antibiotics, Ventilators, modern medicine would prevent treat severe infections, fatality rate would much higher today.


You also comparing disease spanned several years ended hundred years ago era without benefits today, pandemic even peaked yet still killing several thousand people day around world, already killed 1/3rd number Americans killed Spanish Flu 8 months since first Covid death US.

Probably not, since antibiotics, antivirals, ventilators advantages today fight severe viral infections prevent/ treat secondary bacterial infections. 

However, hard conclude current virus brought back 1918, would likely far worse outcomes age groups today. Don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs also able spread causes symptoms. long pre symptomatic spread exists evolutionary pressure virus become milder.  falls back simple logic:

Theres one case live. virus free 100 days. new cases people travelled self isolste 14 days, get 10K fine, dished selfish morons already 200K people died US. ""Pro-life"" ass. 9/11 killed something like 2K people yet everyone arms WAY COVID. New Zealand Island. US illegals jumping border would constantly bring new infections. Assuming could even eliminate country big U.S. Mental health medical personnel well frontline workers really worrisome. since last 9 months sign relief. real heros well rewarded. government running herd immunity changed since Prime Minister said beginning pandemic. obvious. August

So went one month NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Ireland FINISHED FOREVER. WITHOUT PARTYING COUPLE WEEKS. FEELINGS, WALLS CLOSING IN, CAN'T GO LIKE THIS. Halloween big every year, trendsetter neighborhood moved 8 years ago.

We put year want anyone coming demand candy.

I thought Halloween thought ""Should let front doorstep become congregation zone hundred kids, parents might anti-maskers?""

I want police people's behavior called early said putting decorations year - even though kills means neighbor compete every year gets ""win"" year default. Yeah I‚Äôm expecting spring we‚Äôre done lot Masks making difference. much less obesity, healthy humans, less globalization, smaller cities etc etc aggressive first, they've perfected system nearly invasive.

You're denial. Republicans: idc. want new Supreme Court Justice tax cuts rich joking made sad He‚Äôs Republican. think planet going outlive humanity unless colonize planets. Unless someone nukes Earth‚Äôs core, actions really impact long habitable us. job goes another full lockdown I'm definitely going jobless quickly homeless..as said, people would comply correctly, think another full shut necessary. I'll keep short late I'm tired think met somewhere middle.

I think lockdowns increase cases numbers, still struggle see lockdowns increasing less beds available (even that's probably good idea). There's argument made without elections politicians/officials likely actually enact health-conscious policies, based information think happen.

Incumbent politicians already eat death counts respective constituents. getting around those. Cynically, would say thinking ""but what's thousand more?"", improve/campaign recovering economic conditions new jobs.

In state, we've started relaxing lockdown policies based hospitalizations, think good compromise way forward. see people going back lockdown.

Someone asked day ""Why schools talking returning virtual bars allowed reopen?"". Well, businesses bars go bankrupt (if already) schools simply based way government allocates money.

Wasn't really short, semi-addressed points, stream consciousness thing. enjoying dialogue. 


EDIT: think we're going ""COVID Hangover"" way politicians criticized next 10-15 years incumbents gone, way criticized Iraq War votes. Politically, think try get ahead make gains ways. Modern humanity met match lol

The worst case can't take die next generation stronger. immune systems evolved time. Edgy, kid Probable/suspected always still separate category. count towards deaths, would count COVID cases included calculations case fatalities. ""it looks much like every way tested negative can't prove it"" scenario.

But types viral pneumonia could look similar imaging. Suspecting COVID tested negative everything epidemiology. people passing COVID pre existing conditions safe assume would make 80? West coast best coast. I've lived three states fking great. millions idiot followers. Lady, don‚Äôt know virus, certainly stupid. bombshell revelations ever reach media us weak mind sheep reading, usually start youtube, end youtube? 

If so: think is? :) Ok cool least here. strategy based definition ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù requiring quarantine ‚Äî within six feet infected person 15 minutes more. students moved around within time, thinking goes, one ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù required stay home classmate tests positive. 

you fuckin wot m8 Computer viruses. Utterly insane.

For reference, that'd U.S. equivalent **350,000** daily cases.

Three months straight results 10% populaiton infected. **10%**. knowledge unpleasant, people willfully choose ignorance even confronted blatant evidence.  well assholes. Wow for, going disappear, like, poof, know?

Timeline times Trump said COVID would Would interesting see excess deaths come from, sadly article answer clear whether spike caused shift covid-19 deaths toward younger people May August deaths causes, CDC said.

From remember even earlier year lockdowns, social distancing unemployment led suicides. Deaths COVID19 definitely play part excess death, doubt make lions share. Mental health is, always, forgotten pandemic. literally still does, happens prison now. really saddens it‚Äôs likely lot super spreader anti-maskers taking beds ICU get ill... somebody comes it‚Äôs full gets denied... ughh. people think hoax still? 200k dead fake too? trump literally getting virus?

It‚Äôs like Chris Christie going around telling people wear masks now. want fucking scream. guy ICU 7 days that‚Äôs made take seriously. idea probably got helping Trump debate prep, therefore helping get re-elected massive failure pandemic response continue. 

And fact people *still*need hear this. never truly understood counties call American‚Äôs dumb election night 2016. It‚Äôs downhill since then. Tens millions Americans ignorant af. know Indiana always reports probable COVID deaths. deaths rolled total death count get positive test result. not. one science would write way. would drop. Biden allowed happen? /s Whoooops Yes, approx 675,000 US 50 million worldwide world much smaller population today (1.8 billion, third today's figure, triple that), far, far fewer 80s people living chronic conditions make high risk. yes, herd immunity reached extremely high cost lives. million deaths COVID19 far, continue keep down, let's best so. got hopes up?  Based exactly?  

There‚Äôs strange lack awareness among 99% human beings virus. 

They seem want create reality, science, timelines. I'm Wisconsin homebody suburb Twin Cities. I'd say majority people seem taking seriously, people I've seen convenience grocery stores wearing masks.

Do seriously think covid deaths? thing conceive now, death covid?

A huge chunk additional deaths ""collateral casualties"" due covid, disastrous human response it, name few:

* People dying unrelated diseases hospitals closed lockdown except covid patients. Remember ""elective nonessentials"" are/were suspended? Well, include everything cancer screenings apendectomies. Surprise

* Continuing above, tsunami preventable deaths expected early next year due treatable diseases left unchecked/undetected hospital backlog making treatment impossible

* ""Deaths despair"" 1 5 small businesses permanently lost (and increasing), hunger, destitution, etc

* Deaths overdose substance abuse due lockdown-induced depression mental illness

* Deaths domestic abuse doubled

* far more, never bother learn about

And say it, no, lockdowns must, Sweden never (and even social distancing masks) woods, growing bright future ahead.

Just look life Sweden last week, compare disaster. Believe lying though i'm american like canada thinking longterm instead playing month month game. seeing lot headlines countries coming months Masks help, turning around pandemic own. Distancing, visiting badly ventilated areas way important. masks help little bit almost nobody using properly. true number cases April extremely high, much higher number confirmed cases, enough swabs test everyone. sickest people got tested, large portion needed ICU and/or died.

Now greatly expanded testing capacity capturing mild cases. dilute death rate. much smaller number need ICU, system overwhelmed yet. reality, fewer number people getting infected April, able see better. However, situation still go exponential growth overwhelm healthcare capacity number cases go fast, happens, death rate would become much higher. dodge wrench, dodge Covid! Acting like total assholes taking medical advice Facebook - Northern Ireland - it‚Äôs infuriating helps one stops locking in. fun. Bye. surprised? Governments decided close smaller, locally owned shops. guess what, people still need food, computers shit. supposed get now, besides amazon? 

Locking economy fucks smaller guys. thought already required? maybe restaurants/bars? /r/politics part ""the"" front page unless explicitly subscribe. Everyone's front page pretty different. Condemning entire site silly.

That said, sure good diverse information sources. long Fox News. also best elderlycare world according UN.

In case best elderlycare might bad thing though since refers best quality life. High autonomy (cant look people caring mental health ), care staff (more people bringing deciese) etc Scientists bracing possibility COVID-19 never go away due ineffective vaccination, factors. lockdowns enforced work, lockdowns enforced work. Brilliant logic there. almost social economic issues world. Uhh ohh. Yearly corona shots coming soon! Uhh, mods? article even mention title saying Sure
üì¢HEAR YE HEAR YE! got conspiracy you: everyone stays inside bit, *lefties* get rid ‚Äúhoax virus‚Äù ok? üì¢ all? Honestly everyone's going it, guess expecting something apocalyptic Try listening someone desperately argue death rate actually lower hospitals make money listing deaths Covid deaths. implying mask instantly absolves world virus?  article explain virus actually got bit worse became silent killer time jumped humans?

The article "" researchers Duke University identified number ‚Äúsilent‚Äù mutations roughly 30,000 letters virus‚Äôs genetic code helped thrive \*once made leap\*"", mutations "" may contributed virus‚Äôs ability \*spread people even know it\*""

Nothing becoming silent killer, supposition, maybe mutated spread easily (which point evolutionary changes, spread multiply widely possible present conditions.) Exactly question. name it? Sputnik-V?


Are distribution issues? issues even effective? MANY articles puffing subreddit. country origin still punched around. happening? according studies UK one 45 people symptoms continuing months Worth keeping mind also 220000+ deaths, among 8 million cases end death, immense number health maimed possibly years permanently. wind walking wounded live reduced lives out. get much spotlight numbers talks come up.

Oh wait, people need eat, people need water, people need power. wait, virus obviously going anywhere...  believe vaccine finally we've promised many times let time. dense? 
Your ""lockdown"" is, according Folkh√§lsomyndigheten:

Yes, that's right. judge state metrics compared states. Texas worst state healthcare coverage like said, lots lower socioeconomic areas...

It's also near bottom almost every single measure - education, hs grad rate, college grad rate, post college grad rate, income, abortion rate, abortion access, healthcare access, prisons, private prisons, prisoners, etc. etc.

Shithole state. much *united * states. state everybody solo mode. never going get pandemic. It‚Äôs almost like people every race ethnicity anti-science dipshits. Russia vaccine doesnt work?

I‚Äôm usually exhausted always try avoid stops along way times simply make stop run cvs supermarket.  wait....so weeks increased cases ended translating increased hospitalizations? I've heard everything! 

What going say next, increased cases leads increased hospitalizations lead increased deaths?!?!

I hate put this, /s Yep. People closest don‚Äôt even get this. Ignorance bliss. wisconsin get raped covid 19 Massachusetts hospitals zero corona cases weeks end ? can't things much different halfway across country. people reporting wearing masks actually careless though. Frenchman living Asia report family back home regularly, tell people careless. people wearing masks wrong, people continuously touching masks, lots people covid symptoms actually going work (even doctors!), people could WFH (sadly always fault, employers forcing come), subways packed, terraces full people without masks (as eating/drinking), etc.  God bless hospital workers right now. Yeah main message study half years life expectancy lost comes people middle aged younger, even though account much smaller portion deaths. example someone 50 years old dies, lose 30 years life expectancy. easily made gene synthesis without much knowledge cost around $100,000 usd.

Point being, burn every sample keep everything super secure location someone recreate relatively little effort. virus living thing. fabricated. brother one people troubles lockdown comes back. adamant closing everything job affected, think wrong changed mind. complicated problem, solution, compromise

South Korea took pandemic seriously, masks, social distancing, contact tracing quarantine people exposed. covid death rate less ten percent ours, closer one percent ours.

They've also much less economic damage. unemployment went up, never even broke 5%. turns keeping workers consumers healthy also good business. Let's try again.

I'd rather try though lockdown lockdown approach years. point study concludes cloth masks prevent transmission airborne virus? I'm difficulty finding one. interesting article! Worth reading anyone curious make vaccines effective elderly people. black death Europe killed 40-50% population 4 years.

So imagine happening today global scale. 7.6 billion people 40% die 4 years. That's 3 billion 40 million. 2 million people dying per day, 87 000 per hour, 24 per second. 4 years. 

Try imagining that. Since USA 4.25% world population would mean 80 000 dead americans day. would 9/11 every hour almost 1 dead every second .... Loads stuff still closed NY.

That all.

Source: remember many 100, 90s, 80s, even 70s, die many things.


*I saying death tragic.* suffering, ""more"" deaths. I'm still trying find study says wearing t-shirt sleeve mouth stops transmission airborne virus. Isn‚Äôt basically understood early putting lots people respirators turned increase pressure lungs hurting patients? would completely sequenced initial infection later infection I'm getting right?

This correct. 

The vast majority people got basic PCR test can't possibly prove reinfection. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª true! Co-infection thought huge factor Spanish Flu. flu common cold totally different things. old friends WI, half Covid Deniers. It‚Äôs frightening see brain-snatched are. hang Q anon believe stuff. hold parties home bars. It‚Äôs scary. wonder ended brainwashed Trump. know sure strains appeared. know first detected them. 

so even proof. say, afraid of? Yet drive around gun glovebox. would switched ship restaurant take opened indoor dining 2 weeks cases dropped? Right. Finding relapse several months infected would give relief. ‚ÄúFlatten curve‚Äù denialist?

I recall literally everybody talking back March explained every media outlet every health professional. No. Lab confirmed flu would counted flu. lab confirmed COVID would count COVID. ones wondering looked like viral respiratory infection tested negative flu time COVID testing wasn‚Äôt available. could always dig stored samples retest (and probably wouldn‚Äôt many; respiratory viruses don‚Äôt regularly test for) kill spread. like neither HIV. spanish flu 1918 though like that. point, approx 700,000 people died? far 24 confirmed reinfections 40,000,000+ confirmed cases.

This wrong statement. 

We sequence strain vast majority people. 40 million cases, MUCH smaller number. even then, reinfection strain count proof.

Here's basically saying: people died traveling, 19 died going space back. Therefore, space travel safest way travel.

Do see problem? International flights probably sped spread though, right? much Scandinavian DNA crap proud boys claim too. mask actually making sick stopped wearing it. kept getting lung infections. I‚Äôve trying remember swish mouthwash get home around people length time. Even day going dentist, still swished right got home. Duration immunity mean standard deviation. may seeing people early tail standard deviations mean.  We're turning corner, hill. ship Europe North America took 30 days 100 years ago.

Its incredible afternoon would take people whole month 100 years ago. costs days wages, even making bare minimum. Right 20 negative consequences mass lockdowns, loss livelihoods, deaths despair don‚Äôt matter. hysterical singularly focused one thing. estimates millions die starvation due broken supply chains. Thousands others die cancer due lack proper screening. them? Don‚Äôt matter? everyone afraid you. guy thing cant relate Yes, everyone covid multiple times already. IFR actually tiny. 2 months ago plane next woman two SCREAMING kids flight wear masks once. watched flight attendants tell everyone else plane wear mask, completely ignored woman. even give passing glance. attendants even wear mask properly nose covered. snapped pictures too. Fuck flying right now. claimed another airline shut ""HAD"" book flight solid. ZERO social distancing flight. EVERY seat filled. think someone asked pickup ice way ""The work essential. workers not."" masks. We've made lot progress intensive care! dexamethasone helps too.

 long term impacts survivors really concerns though (debilitating neurological problems, heart/lung damage, etc)  Would interesting deaths % population. 10 Flight Attendants died pre-mask days covid work. Since masking up, 0.

Masks work.  good points. 

Well, I'd add since need 2 infections sequenced, 75.5k possible patients checked reinfection. that's perfectly distributed (obviously not!), along everything else said. 

So realistically talking low number. one school district studied probabilities health.

Good disease experts say moving students around every minutes actually **more likely increase transmission virus, exposing people infected student**. also complicate contact tracing efforts, said.  evidence-based practice sound scientific policy,‚Äù said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, epidemiologist John Hopkins Center Health Security supportive reopening schools in-person instruction.

It's unbelievable educator figure out. 222 nm cheap solid state device. get 280 nm LEDs 254/185 nm consumer/agriculture grade Hg lamps, 222 nm definitely exotic industrial R&amp;D grade excimer lamp produces 222 nm. costs something like $10k,  
cheap one. 5% 8 billion...400 million Holy crap, I‚Äôm mom I‚Äôm sorry deal horrible situation. virus forces body put much effort fighting people severe enough never got anti-bodies fight reinfection.

This completely false. *mild* cases lower antibody titers, severe, unless serious immune problems. ask Fauci Wife 36 weeks pregnant multi factor high risk, told report Monday. Submitted multiple doctor notes risk preterm labor could give shit Reading studies (linked article) reveals holes clearly. exactly information need know, can't get without fine-grained data.  Yes, also open up. threat us staying closed nothing compared virus deadly flu (but infectious). young, gives shit, got compromised immune system (old), best stay home. Everyone mask, healthy people shit fear makes much sense reusing needle. Same. terrible idea. Cats susceptible respiratory diseases general. concern cat gives covid.. rather could expose it. always recommendation distance pets like would ppl symptoms. However. Idk could handle missing kitty snuggles.. Also consider keeping cat indoors know more.. It‚Äôs American dream. We‚Äôre workers throwing parties. It‚Äôs disheartening bad peak. I‚Äôve sounded alarm anyone willing listen since around January/February China getting hit. 
I really amplified voice EU slammed. 
The came initial tsunami US. 
Despite happening half year ago, people somehow forgotten stopped caring. 
I feel like psychological explanation this. 
Here though, ready go March / April disaster over. 
Everyone surprised shit hits fan. is, believe restrictions movement, including motor vehicle operation, must uniform constitutional, thus precluding use withholding toilet paper penalty transgressions unrelated movement bowels. school apparently hates teachers students. insane. Correct. Also, 151k patients didn‚Äôt survive. privacy protections might make difficult recover sequence data initial infection confirmation upon reinfection. No, suspect far fewer 151k patients constitute pool patients confirmed reinfection possible. preexisting conditions even though I'm 28, worry quite bit COVID. pretty bad asthma ischemic stroke before. Each?? auto mod sub stupid. dare politicize issue one party basically pretending doesn‚Äôt exist thousands people still dying every week. It‚Äôs already politicized. It‚Äôs nearly impossible discus point without mentioning something related politics. stupid rule. states federal governments going it. Restrictions tighten here. wishful thinking dream will. I‚Äôm healthcare worker. I‚Äôve hard night dealing this. needed read comment tonight. Thank I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve recovered. You‚Äôve made difference. before. concerned this. COVID May - Got pneumonia June, 2 weeks hospital - almost died couple times.

Had antibody test couple weeks later - none. Meannwhile still breathless scared. many South Central Americans CIA need kill realize socialism bad? Jeffrey Toobin entered chat. Yes, matters proven cases. 

If someone gets sick March gets sick November, can't PROVE first infection never fully beaten. show new, district reinfection different strain can't lingering first infection. 

So see numbers proven reinfections, count strain. example vastly undercounting reinfection cases. That's horrible, given hospital beds rural areas have. Speak truth people start digging past connect China, Russia billionaire part global conspiracy control masses make Individual 1 look bad.

‚ÄúYou beat 40 scholars one fact, can‚Äôt beat one idiot 40 facts.‚Äù Good thing fearful paranoid kids running things would trouble.  There‚Äôs corn maze though. thing me. I'm fine far. bud, you‚Äôre wrong 3 counts. majority died early majority (51%) deaths happened since June, spring.

June almost half year ago. Closer beginning end. 

 seem impression stop wipe all, gave idea? least get vaccine better treatments substantially reduce severity / fatality.

That's hoping dreaming. Billions people livelihoods dying far [long term effects] low probability symptoms happen diseases long term data side effects listed survivors. virus literally hasn‚Äôt around long enough studies run variable. A-game scientists resources focused vaccines, diagnosis, survivability right now, longitudinal studies. symptoms exist diseases (I would argue combination seen others makes one damn insidious), they‚Äôre anywhere near numbers.

Which weird people saying long term symptoms major problem. aren't. head sand stop dismissing misinformation. It‚Äôs super helpful.

I tell prefer fear paranoia vast majority people never personally even suffer symptoms let alone death. *trying* kill people? I‚Äôm Wisconsinite true. coworkers go least every night bars come work masks chins cuz they‚Äôre ‚Äústill wearing them.‚Äù haven‚Äôt even gone inside grocery store months. Thank goodness grocery pickup delivery. Let climb. Humans awful species, dont think? covid stats already getting much worse, yes happening inevitable. reinforcing point.

But apparently disapprove. can't imagine political rallies effect that. argument forcing old people stay alive artificially hospitals.

Would rather stay alive 6 months year hospital bed die, die actually enjoy?

We'll never accurate count confirmed coronavirus reinfections.

What actually study population people relatively high exposure level getting tested time (like health care workers) establish criteria like 3-4 negative PCR tests symptomology episodes sufficient establish reinfection (vs. lingering viral debris). they'll fit statistical model determine fast immunity wears off.

The actual number confirmed reinfections always remain ""rare"" even number actual reinfections hits million times genetically sequenced confirmed cases.

Maybe find way make restaurants safer (air filters, masks sitting, etc.). believe trial protocol requires certain number symptomatic infections entire trial group. point, data unblinded (at least partially) researchers get see breakdown cases placebo vaccine groups draw conclusions.

From [trial interim efficacy analysis conducted approximately 75 events meeting primary endpoint definition reported across active control groups within population participants seropositive baseline, give 70% power detect 70% power detect 75%. 

This interim readout, give pretty high chance provide enough data detect vaccine quite effective (the 70% 75% figures). vaccine only, say, 50% effective, likely interim readout result large enough difference infection counts control vaccine groups. look region US. I'm SF positivity rate 1 percent throughout last week. feel much detached what's going elsewhere US. Sigh.

They're palatable universal. 

Real conspiracies like tax evasion election meddling require specialized knowledge they're supposed work understand they're going wrong. Nobody wants google share Facebook, certainly difficult repeat backyard BBQ.

Put another way, child understand details 9/11 conspiracy theory, literally, watch youtube video familiar images faces it. understanding whole mess historical/colonial forces work middle east financing insurgent networks ancillary agendas much less interesting frankly less special secret.

It's conspiracy believe company trying form unregulated monopoly using politicians it, business. question whether they're pulling system acting stop it.

Real conspiracies even hard believe we've seen documented hundreds times before. They're hard understand. Meanwhile we've never seen god damn lizard people harry-potter-fanfic quality story pins vast geopolitical woes going much receptive audience, released free TikTok. biggest reasons are:

* might selection bias included trial. Collecting one group people splitting random makes maximally likely you‚Äôre comparing two groups otherwise similar people. (This can‚Äôt compare group people included trial.)
* People‚Äôs behavior might change they‚Äôre included trial (e.g. go party assuming treatment group). Again, placebo group ensures group similarly-behaving people compare against. (This actually give everyone injection: don‚Äôt want people behaving differently based whether got vaccine.) always delete shit? Distancing least masks arent diametrically opposed that. I‚Äôd agree talking stay home orders end Covid, there‚Äôs things accomplish goals try run President. little uncoventional outlet, wife found Epidemiologist Clinical Research Coordinator Instagram excellent explainer. profiled July, I've found content excellent great job breaking complex research topics understandable pieces. insane anyone would release article without info first... creates ~~panic distrust~~ **views profit**.

FTFY looks like measures we're taking Covid effect flu, wonder there's data stomach bugs like. Still appreciated! placebo effect interesting/weird concept. Hard believe produce benefits. realize.

Here explanation found thread: False positives definitely cause problems. 
Let's say test identify covid-infected person positive 99% also says positive 5% healthy people. 
Right seems like there's 1% world (or less) sick covid (google gave this). 

So take 1000 people test them, 10 going infected marked correctly positive, 990 healthy ones 50 marked positive. 
So 60 people tested positively virus, know 6 times actual number. 
This larger scale lead economies dying many people stay quarantined necessary, might even end bigger problem virus itself. 

So one reason false positives problem. article plastered everywhere people see headline. counterproductive. Canada looking cheap labor. Americans usually fit mold. plan relies ""if people would X"" likely fail. NYC would like word. It‚Äôs sad see college students okay lockdown distance learning without realizing they‚Äôre ones going affected long-term this. 

If remote learning thing next year thousands kids going graduating worst recession 90 years real connections realize quickly ‚Äúfriendships‚Äù made discord aren‚Äôt real friendships. 

And decades they‚Äôll look back early 20‚Äôs see wasted didn‚Äôt get experience many things wanted to, willingly accepted it. let's say get flu. Lungs full crap, hacking wheezing, surviving. body fighting successfully going take another week bulk symptoms disappear. doctor wants come get evaluated make sure progressing expected agree great medical insurance. way doctor's office, get car accident suffer internal bleeding (i.e. ruptured spleen) get detected right away flu symptoms (heart rate already erratic, lungs making noise mask noise bleeding, body aches pains flu, etc). die.

It vehicle death flu death? mean, underlying condition (the flu) complicated happened position seem taking, flu killed you. However, car accident, would survived.

There's also difference CAUSE MECHANISM death. people underlying conditions die COVID, cause COVID mechanism COVID exacerbated underlying conditions point patient died. COVID, underlying conditions would exacerbated patient died soon did. hypothetical example, car accident cause, mechanism would involve flu, accident, little bit malpractice finding bleeding. Wow, come 25 cases from? found source? Man, sure suck placebo group. think understand I'm saying.

Cases go lot = deaths go up.

What do, seem think did, argue necessarily goes rate back March April terms deaths per known case. 15 minute rule contact tracing purpose, like six feet rule. backed science. Well, concern making vaccine, opposed well vaccine works, exactly bolster confidence vaccine Brazil. [Their 7-day average among highest ever much? Yeah, we'll back hunters gatherers shit lockdowns continues 2021. mean stupid? read ""decoration"" shared exhaustion. 

Desolation too, though. said independently review vaccine, vaccines bad. skepticism around politicization CDC FDA something began last days. many times pandemic CDC guidelines altered something politically palatable? little doubt expertise organizations, concern independence. Lol no, even Spanish flu virus 100 times severe young healthy age group rank economy countries let virus spread, back advices guidelines public could might helpful slow spread. first lockdown already led global economy worst recorded recession ever. quite lot countries even world war harmful economy, letting virus spread tank economy shut complete false, pure conspiracy theory. recent example Florida shows far lower unemployment shut business California. said get people vote elections (and need literally drag ass polls). directed voters right wing party, especially elderly lockdown repeatedly told stay home risk lives. elections came important voting demographic needed convinced good now. good good now. media/reddit desperately trying stall COVID vaccine Yep, there's vaccine there's going lot resistance mask-wearing. mean, I'm sick already, thought wearing mask years incredibly unappealing. can't imagine I'm minority, either. Thank fuck also means, left school, spent 30-40 years really absorbing basic knowledge. Pharma companies don‚Äôt make $ dogs. covered Medicare, Medicaid insurance plans, though hospitals -- teaching hospitals particular -- charge autopsies individuals passed away facility. private autopsy outside expert cost $3,000 $5,000.

The cost probably reason rates falling. Apparently Phase 1 trial, 89% participants get vaccine. chances good. I'm sure could said many sub-national regions. Lombardy definitely could made case weeks. statements become less significant break small segments (ND population medium sized city).

*If country, I'd lowest positivity rate world!* Good example. Tell 2 friends I‚Äôve lost, 30s seemed perfectly healthy. Please eat shit. disappearing soon. We're rounding bend. Honest!

If they'd stop reporting it, problem ü§™ compromised. There‚Äôs reason CDC keeps putting contradictory information. also know White House blocked mask recommendations. issue though? we're going use sniffer dogs screening tool large groups, i.e. sporting events, concerts, schools, etc., far better turn away false positives false negatives slip infect others. sniffer dog screening would presumptive positive anyway, would mean person identified presumptive positive would need go get lab test confirm it. Agreed. could almost feel difference air first studies came showing virus's preference non-white, obese, poor. Suddenly whole swath people realized care anymore. sorry, english first language. placebo?  masters Biology understand vaccinations work. get successful candidate 10-15% successful. random garbage put vaccine

You ask refund whichever institution gave degree. Even though Drosten leading expert also talks publicly it, think head (Prof. Dr. Lothar H. Wieler) would fitting equivalent Dr. Fauci They're building logistics infrastructure distribute vaccine done. They're making there's delays everything approved. think correct say accidentally pass illness asymptomatic killing someone. even close. Thats like saying everyone drives responsible people getting lung cancer dust break pads, therefore stop driving. that, survival rate high vast majority people, think people walk eggshells forever. disease go away long time. destroy society lockdowns forced mandates.

Most spread virus wearing mask. many precautions take pass disease on, staying home sick proper hygiene. Masks end all, considering many things let people decide best them. Nazi it. God imagine covid, getting trial cure, dying cause got placebo though? know cure guaranteed yet, damn. - Europe needs build wall make Canada pay it!

- Canadian plague rats need kept out

- world shutting Canadians long, long time

- Maybe they'll re-evaluate December ~~2020~~ ~~2021~~ ~~2022~~ 2023. never?

- Good. I'm European saw Canadian walking around, clearly cases Europe due approved traveler loophole

Did miss any? /u/10pesjidi seemed pretty good shitting US last border closure submission, got anything add here? Slovenia 25% positivity rate yesterday, last days around 18-20%.
But Spain really bad, already surpassed million. :/  Listen, we've seen big increase cases eventually leads increase deaths.

Actually, we've seen reverse. first time location gets virus, get hit hard. second time always smaller lots cases deaths rise kind. currently seeing everywhere. 

This 3rd wave hospitalizations since 2nd never broke record first wave, likely 3rd fizzle too. Almost thousand died yesterday. might looking 2,000 per day 2-4 weeks. disaster. What‚Äôs National plan again? No, drug approval done federal government. testing conducted state institute Sao Paulo, submit federal agency Anvisa (like FDA US).  
Having said that, yes, states depend Federal Government speed process allow tests enter phase III distribute around country. It‚Äôs necessarily conspiracy theory. Sometimes people mess job. happens. What‚Äôs weirder going way testing center, signing up, leaving without test. Way waste testing center‚Äôs time resources apologies. need read links provided carefully. look like mink transmit covid19 other. sucks end world. stuck agricultural setting, cull lifestocks. Lets hope circulate wild. 

This also mean vaccine effective mutated form. something researchers/scientists/public health re-evaluate going forward. 1% 8x less 8%. It‚Äôs negligible difference. 

It frustrates you‚Äôre willing use projections things others. use serological testing things others. reality every COVID positive test there‚Äôs least two, probably more, missed lack testing. It‚Äôs completely irresponsible say 1% country covid makes question everything say. it‚Äôs won‚Äôt anything, it‚Äôs don‚Äôt want anything. you‚Äôll complain. That‚Äôs huge difference. money support businesses gave 8 trillion major corporations buy back stock fire people. happened Survival fittest? shit company can‚Äôt survive pandemic it‚Äôs time eat dick. collect 50k rent month. don‚Äôt see complaining neither tenants. even paid advance. Hi. get plane cross country next weeks. dates set. trip non negotiable.

Maybe... question much whether kids would okay teachers/staff effect community transmission. undoubtedly lead community transmission, however seem caused significant spikes point. Opening schools probably right thing do.  know peak? looks like it‚Äôs still going peak. already went Gold delays. Plenty dirt six feet ;) one largest case increases seen still lower deaths hospitalizations first wave?

Did virus mutate something less severe?? No. Today's hiv testing methods deliver results within 6 weeks now, via quick test u buy even Amazon, blood tests work quicker. Also hiv well treatable die spread anymore. medication called PrEP loweres virus concentration blood point can't spread it. medicine also taken demand sexual risk contact.

Scariest part ‚Äúunknown‚Äù think virus community transmission ever going away since presents symptoms many infected people, vaccine, improved treatment better tracing means matter.

Even get vaccinated yes maybe see friends often still *avoid crowds large gatherings.* still outbreaks weddings similar gatherings.

Unless get higher compliance masks high rate vaccination, going enough resume *""normal.""*

Normal means concerts, packed churches Christmas, parades, packed bars theaters every single weekend, 600 person weddings, huge conventions, Las Vegas strip packed brim every single weekend, cruise ships etc. That's *normal.*

There's huge grey area ""lockdown"" ""back normal."" Back normal means crowds problem. think need much better vaccine future high compliance then, high mask compliance unfortunately, avoidance crowds. who's freaking out? covid varying degrees severity seem even acknowledge uncle one luckier ones.

Point wasnt one ""lucky ones"". majority people dont get Covid bad. Even among seniors minority need hospitalization. 60 really small fraction require hospitalization.

I responding someone said Trump must survived special treatment others dont have.

I wanted point uncle age didnt get bad. I'll give upvotes feel better.  hiv wait like 3 months shows test something else? honestly even think ""done"", increase testing, enforce encourage mask use, push therapies vaccines, arguably things WH conceptually, many tangible things Biden really do.

I'm saying wrong, definitely wrong confident.

Singapore, Australia, NZ, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan got rid Covid intents purposes ‚Äî without vaccine.

Yet people can't wear mask protect loved ones.

Then whine can't socialize like March let spread crappy deadly virus family friends? ~ Mask Debaters *If* shows reinfections, also important know immune systems doing. fully functioning? compromised due medication health conditions? immune systems immunity built equally. Enjoy getting sick hope ok Panic mode on, can't go well I'm told able tell group I'm study ongoing, vaccine becomes publicly available receive it. receive vaccine, extra doses negative effect.

Thank you! depends whether something people get luck draw poor immune system whether immunity runs certain point.

If sucks probably going keep targetting group people there's vaccine. B that's genuine breakdown society levels problem confirmed.  What?

It‚Äôs terrible year.  knows fuck going on.

A pretty accurate description 2020. anyone explain testing contact tracing equivalent collectively confining entire population literally destroyed. But, hey, better keep testing them, finding asymptomatics, confining low risk young people, test college sewage system, limit in-person classes - *must* find cases! btw, nah, that's lockdown... 

-Scott Atlas, leader's trusted Coronavirus task force Please love god I'm hoping goes away next Fall. want actually campus, want actually go parties, meet new people instead stuck home.

I get vaccine soon can, second get word get go inject it. We've problem. first wave easy us people let guard down.

The government fucked comes soon restrictions. increase testing capacity, general prepare second wave. faced criticism kept saying second wave come. came started marginalizing it, knowing they'd embarrass right elections. started dismissing every warning election campaign opposition parties. That's really pathetic. mere fuck up. knowingly. journalists started calling government face criminal responsibility. I've idea law works matter. see France though government held accountable. 

I feel really bad people hit hard economically. even restrictions managed track potentially positive people, could avoided. mention thousands deaths.

The ""hygiene office"" track potential patients, started failing horribly underfinanced overworked - fault. government's though. repeatedly warned since June experts Chamber Deputies. let spread crappy deadly virus family friends? ~ Mask Debaters

Why let spread best worst flu ever had, many long-term sickness that's pre-existing condition, worst deadly virus family friends? ~ Mask Debaters save everyone embarrasment ? actually makes way worse, lower trust health authorities, make look incompetent, make people fearful getting tests donating blood.

Sorry 7+ months isolation.... starting second lockdown (I live Toronto) getting big way. Superspreader though. suggest risk significant illness 40- 50% (extrapolating general data).

I dont know get that, CDC tells us hospitalization rate 70s age group hospitalization rate, ICU would subset that. Oops antibodies seem protective it‚Äôs still solid news Exactly. Doesn‚Äôt make model mask behavior guess. mask goes off. table. Etc. parties defined online antics supporters suggest don‚Äôt look Stormfront, cuz right look *really* bad.

Something tells doesn‚Äôt work ways like though. Source oxford part? calling liar haven‚Äôt seen news lately. Lol grandma fine idiot. Slovakia here, similar situation coming slowly surely us. Since May, government (especially Prime Minister) talking coronavirus really intensely. ""first wave"", what, 1-5 cases per day WEEKS. 4 months prepare wave. time to:

* get people trace contacts infected
* get funds equipment healthcare
* kind system tests borders (even measuring temperature would great)
* enforce mask wearing efficiently
* make fucking illegal compulsory 2 week quarantine questionable ""state quarantine centers"" first wave (= half-fallen dormitories)
* get funds EU. keep giving us ridiculous excuses, like ""it takes long approve"", bullshit, takes 13 days average (they're throwing around months)
* take decisive action misinformation, propaganda bullshit conspiracies
* lock village full marginally oppressed group people using military (which also gave huge opportunity conspiracy theorists went head saying get free food medical care, BS course)

Having said this, they're implementing nation-wide testing 15 million tests (antibody tests). enough staff this? No. make compulsory? No. punish people get tested? No. infrastructure this? No. clear, doable plan? No. Nobody knows fuck going on. Dude come reddit I‚Äôm sure perspective different people aren‚Äôt this. Maybe I‚Äôm sick sure otherwise fucking knob, I'm taking Europe America Asia America. Literally Africa, Europe Asia even need boat, land routes. Use brain looking like fool. see effect people

You're right, system ""clinic"" ""trial"" vaccine willing participants test safety efficacy. There‚Äôs lot potential current crisis wide range extraordinarily grim outcomes. However, gkm6-4 [taking lot abuse for] pointing out, don‚Äôt resign fate. serve anyone. I'm free man Singapore, Australia, NZ, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan got rid Covid intents purposes ‚Äî without vaccine. 

The problem keep prevent spread it, virus still rampant outside countries still possible get country. Let's say Australia manages completely eradicate cases there's zero cases 6 months, takes one piece imported food carrying virus kick again. speculated opening schools since beginning September together weather conditions may blame.

If somehow knew beforehand able warn other.... surprising since known information. 

Some studies indicated hydroxychloroquine antiviral activity¬†in¬†vitro¬†against coronaviruses, specifically, COVID-19. Remarkably, drug licensed chemoprophylaxis treatment malaria.

You work job, like everyone non essential job. 

Another strawman? compare job Disneyland?
My point want lockdown going put many non essential workers work willing same. That's wild! Funny happened us way.

I hope that, surge auto-immune disorders COVID, people easier time getting diagnosed getting help need simply illnesses prevalent. diagnosed 23, went 8 years pure misery got narcolepsy people telling head implying whole thing psychosomatic. literally put recommendations masks transit, also know White House previously blocked.  side effects thus far? thinking thing. think viral load would better term title.

Everyone else's kids fuck year. I've heard stories get test even symptomps...

Because them, COVID, test you? :( waves become substantially less lethal Plus, antibodies. initial antibodies may last months, memory cells stick around much longer time provide much better immune response reinfection occurs. Like what? Economic destruction, social unrest, corrupt government using crisis lifeboat still 50 deaths day tiny country? people look to? Also, testing waay people tell real scale positives increase last 2-3 weeks. know many people afraid call doctor get tested, fear quarantine low standard hospital care would worsen state. students aren‚Äôt learning Grandma tween WWII says Wars much worse aspects, bunker air raids, went school played friends

In short, dangerous times pandemic, even then, danger clear localised I'm fucking paying federal tax. really wish grounds stand say ""Fuck you, holding end bargain, I'm giving tax state"" I'm taking IRS. Lol. shouldn‚Äôt they? still teaching. they're going close every time there's confirmed presumed case, even open? really going school zero cases? Gtfoh Correct - people refuse wear mask radicals. ‚Äúlosing‚Äù freedom virus ‚Äúa hoax‚Äù. It‚Äôs disgusting. Source those?  best 2 bad options.

Not sending kids school increases inequality poorest miss education completely. Online schooling utterly terrible even means use it. homework, teaching. awful.

Providing measures place (smaller class sizes, masks, cleaning), schools worse offices already mentioned, children/teens spread virus much adults. forget uneducated. I‚Äôm saying weren‚Äôt scourges humanity answering question. I‚Äôm anti vax anti science. Thank explanation flu move baseline. could go wrong?

And yep, I'm quite content stay Australia next five years. Got baby due next month glad born essentially covid-free city. 


It also means sets grandparents visit Queensland summer.

This pandemic going marathon, sprint, best address issue international travel options available us. position already overrun virus. wonder mean spirited political actions prime minister. don‚Äôt see national fine mask working. people enforce take seriously union endorses idiot made mask wearing political issue. wish biggest spike 25 cases. wish New Zealand. üôÇ Shit guess vaccine time soon then? seriously believe type explosive spread we‚Äôre seeing right Wisconsin North Dakota would possible 80% population vaccinated? talking about? types people everywhere!

Or one people looking interpret everything personal attack, assuming that's comment was?    fact virus impact political motivations. ignore ignore reason. Like humans That's said Trust me, I‚Äôve tried talking it. actually lied said discussed agreed agreed help sister. knew would never okay that. understand. vaccine supplementary to, replacement for, restrictions. already lot data saying antibodies last months, weeks chicken pox twice!  likely scenario emergence become next Coronavirus common cold Also, fool? Uppsala even lockdown, released localized recommendations social distancing fully optional. wrong general, lied make seem right. Here's problem. reinfection keeps happening time, eventually even healthy people develop malady puts risk next time get COVID.

This woman beat covid once, later died upon reinfection, 5 days starting chemo. Well, may healthy now, maybe get high blood pressure sometime future. least, get older. vaccines work, them. wait get covid develop long term health issues.

Yep plus bankruptcies ACA eliminated. Everyone gets Covid preexisting condition. Robocopping without robocop intensifies  actually mostly consider educating children important services. close everything else keep open. fuckin' survive it. pro birth pro life anyway. Also betters use something matter iowa too, people job testing positive still coming work cant afford too. Well, maybe stop living outside means, make pretty damn good money here. going worse ending got. think people need see bad is. need know like people die movies, cough times, say last words fall asleep.

People need see unedited real time this. someone ARDS, delerium, catheter, intubation. person alone room one advocate uncomfortable position night shift. one visit. Saying goodbye fucking ipad. That's death anyone have. hate point certainly meant personal dig teacher specifically, GENERALIZATION, but...the salaries teachers US tends attract brightest field. exactly brain trust US teaching students...

But even that, impressively stupid. No, AGGRESSIVELY stupid. live rural area shit hospital guess lol *also* saying wearing face covering ineffective saying untrained people wearing mask *worse* wearing mask.

Neither backed data - something told everyone protect stockpiles PPE.  enclosed space anyone immediate family since March. guess reading things exist. I'm sure argue fact cultures change easily. That's true statement. May suggest less likelihood vaccines lasting long, likelihood re-infection. It‚Äôs almost like leaders countries don‚Äôt COVID19 control want make seem like countries losing battle.

The battle COVID19 NZ good leadership population trusted leadership. dying fine. taking grandma not. Pretty sure referring refusing wear masks ""radicals"" highly doubt it. closed spring we‚Äôve lost much money. mean CEOs going hungry books look like lost money KWIM. 

Personally feel like maybe scale back 50% electives wait list things good great we‚Äôll next week. I‚Äôm sure would people willing wait list straight cancelling. know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It‚Äôs really not. suggestion necessarily means increase risk entire population whole. 
Thanks caring general populace. 
Also, please re-read mathematical example understand it. 
I‚Äôll help need it. none, one knows related not. he's going confirmation biases I'm sure taken seriously large cities like Chicago, NYC LA i'm personally worried part country. Another reason stay away liberal hell holes. Um... We're past point return testing low stopping virus smartly using self isolation option, so...

Pretty much everyone would get virus. Even mortality low 0.5 percent, not, would mean 50 000 *preventable* deaths directly covid. Add deaths patients (cancer, acute health problems) outlook would really grim. 

Ask epidemiologist they'll tell lock inevitable point. live alone... that's true, good suppose. vast majority never never flu hope right. favorite part mad makes people us enjoy it. know that, thanks! Yep,

I realised day initial lockdown UK 4 months complete waste time money.

We're back square one.

The thing see works keep folks away other. means sacrificing hospitality anywhere folks meet vaccination.

Trying half measures, meeting groups 6 restaurant work. prelongs agony all. Go away Science says know long-term effects &amp; young healthy people dying, also showing signs damage even notice (even show zero symptoms). Claiming otherwise shows complete lack understanding definition science is. 

That's even factoring fact people scared (aka selfish uneducated) definitely scared ability kill others spreader. feline early October began suffering mild respiratory illness ultimately led humane case still investigation, primary cause death yet confirmed.

Yeah, think primary cause death killed. Like people share homes aren‚Äôt touching things dozens hundreds times every day... 

But yea, guess mask works outdoors would also work indoors reduction cases would absolutely minuscule. then, one case could become many one person infects others out... probably means person got placebo rather actual vaccine mean wearing masks every year flu season might become norm, Covid-19 could become endemic flare like flu year. I'm happy wear mask there's vaccine would wear one getting vaccinated? wear mask get flu vaccine.

You must never wear seatbelt either. reasoning seatbelts dangerous number people died motor vehicle accidents *while* wearing seatbelt gone since 1968.

-----

1968 seatbelt usage become law, btw. Wants needs, bruh. might higher, cat's owner/family likely infect it. cat loner outside day, probably less likely get COVID. likely hit car, abused human, otherwise injured/lost. Wrong Salem ‚Äî she‚Äôs Winston-Salem Winter arrived climbing steadily no. would expect sharp increase around time rallies effect. remember testing dramatically increased Italy also rest world.

Yeah, see ninja edit. may misunderstood part disagreeing with. I‚Äôm sure thought related vaccine would pause trial. likely already know person received placebo.

Edited due seeing info another article stating cause death Covid complications. Trump loses, we'll lot bigger problems pandemic. Right-wing terror attacks start immediately. Stand remake. Coming CBS late December. Neither would explain nearly nonexistent flu activity. flu R0 1.3 covid 2.5 so. Interventions reduce covid spread could reduce flu 1 prevent outbreak. different diabetes caused flu viruses? lol Lol yes Religionists really reaching flouted rules invisible friend says so. Unfortunately, they've succeeded. Now, (what used be) advanced nation earth, reason kowtows whatever nutty belief system someone pulls butt. clue Shocking. Shocking tell you. /s Uh I‚Äôm sorry get vaccine ain‚Äôt wearing mask Weird you‚Äôre downvoting civil pointing you‚Äôre mistaken, I‚Äôm service here. 

Also weird would rely Pfizer (of companies) put vaccine that‚Äôs minimum ‚Äú76.9% effective‚Äù based PR release 1) Pfizer substantial sunk cost human trials legal obligation shareholders pursue ROI trials long FDA willing approve 2) it‚Äôs nearly impossible determine efficacy usual statistical significance without challenge trial. 

You‚Äôre way depth subject. Reference:

Neuropilin-1 host factor SARS-CoV-2 Yes will. shit private friends family. saw one March beginning September. Yeah leap mink mink. point erradicate humans using vaccine virus figured way transmit (mink mink exampe), stable reservoir. 

The thing I'm concerned origin virus need know comes prevent leaping species (bat?) . Yeah shift Europe‚Äôs graph two three weeks right, look familiar. agree. I'm saying story end first vaccine gets rolled out. However much want over, going take time. time passed data in, decide what's acceptable. Bringing new meaning *x* would shit hand *y* would smell it. Correct, meant add previous response see failed to. Thank you! There's reports people developing new onset type 1 diabetes considerably older typically associate though. read 28 year old suddenly developing type 1 diabetes covid yesterday. would definitely complicate vaccine efforts. killed him? covid before? 28 year old doen't die placebo. Lol delusional proof behind claim? Holy fuck dude. cannot serious. I've asking thing months. Imagine sniffer dog schools??? brilliant, cheap, non-invasive, instant. problem is, ""freedom"" creating danger others around you. Thanks, asshole! global ""lockdown"" people snacking drinking home nothing peoples health whatsoever. Science. Man think beginning month italy getting like 2,000 cases day looked like escaping surge France UK seeing I'm you. know downvoted. reality. Loading yet r/collapse user natural habitat. Quite fascinating, indeed! Nobody know gotten can't contagious? Seems like fearmongering election year none.

Figured much  agreed yikes... seems working. 6 months ZERO covid death China. mean, give everyone huge boost trust, raaight? difficult watch unfold. know several people Europe Ireland Spain crushed prospect additional lockdowns. According them, people upset scared, understanding previous extended lockdowns ""didn't work.""

Unfortunately, lockdowns delay inevitable, could continue effective vaccine fully deployed. Hopefully get effective vaccine deployed soon, rough. seems like much improvement therapy worst cases.

I‚Äôd say dexamethasone immense improvement. We‚Äôve gone ~40% mortality ventilated patients ~30%. That‚Äôs still bad absolute terms, massive improvement April, that‚Äôs certainly contributing lower mortality rate Everyone SANE ran recreation business bailed March April. 

Those dug push psychopathic herd mentality agenda spent summer ~losing money~ losing ~even more~ money open. businesses ultimately vanish coronavirus ordinances normal market forces anyone elementary grasp global affairs knew coming minimum 6-7 months ago.

So ultimately bar owners trying kill customers order stay afloat going fail anyway. whole sector isn‚Äôt coming back til vaccine exists. make pain worse? make debt worse? What‚Äôs point?

Yeah people keep jobs jobs. There‚Äôs lots work needs done. way mess always Great Depression like mobilization every level society, people briefly changing careers back wartime production act, etc.

But no, want everyone share virus everywhere someone keep job? That‚Äôs much different lies nazi collaborators told themselves.

It‚Äôs typically American though. can‚Äôt think one solution solves every single aspect problem time argue shouldn‚Äôt anything all. Treatment better used be, yes, still, lockdowns hurt us refuse admit worth it, next thing know we‚Äôll locking flu complicated this, shut schools lose significant portion health care workers. children come first. [Ummm. realized might talking stabilizing part. so, could right, clear recent Canada data. hypothetical literally herd immunity. That's case measles, polio, tons diseases.  purposes vaccine approval would best placebo would evidence vaccine working given to. vaccine certain number weeks takes becomes fully effective, whatever happens mean. contracted covid timeline met huge impact study.

For example one vaccines tested US requires two doses like 28 days apart something someone caught covid first dose second result would taking much consideration full dosage given point That's simply true. Stop spreading misinformation True. That's long term equilibrium we're shooting for. short term, still experiment. Lot's time data collection needed risk assessment rationally evaluated. wear mask flu, vaccinated not, flu nearly serious Covid is, contagious apparently. Literally everything said wrong, stop spreading  giving clear information death, that's relief moment.

""Anvisa gave details death, citing confidentiality protocols."" boat turn up.with 24 infected crew members coast Perth. quite possible start one infected person start trip end recently infected people end hence likely infectious end trip able spread picked potential disembarking. reason use obvious. would deliberately infect chance play cute dog middle lockdown. know Flu spreads? would wearing masks help? ***Stonks go down*** Death likely side effect vaccine.

Imagine they're testing 100,000 people worldwide, 2 groups 50,000. Base probability getting virus 10% (we would expect 5,000 placebo group get it). Then, unweighted IFR 0.8%, would expect 40 people pass away. 

Then, assume vaccine 70% effective; instead 5,000 people, 1,500 people get virus. Then, vaccine boosts immune system get it, IFR 50% lower. means maybe 7-8 people would pass away. Math simplified that's gist. Could care less masks Social Distancing awful effect globally peoples livelihoods mental health, gotten ridiculous Noooooooooo

Please guys. Let's fix surely means vaccine related, right? worried would've done thing back september. makes sense pause trials unexplained case transverse myelitis case death. hope disclose information soon. ass. Asians wear toxic pollution.

They're much different west, they're germaphobes. say that? Nowhere. reporting numbers reported them. one knows sure 100,000 others died. I‚Äôm sure directly related covid; like said swamped hospitals left people unable get care needed indirectly attributed pandemic anyway. Point without covid 100,000 almost certainly wouldn‚Äôt dead  discussing current development wave not.

No, pointing actual data proves without doubt second wave happening, referring imaginary data inventing justify denial matter what, Sweden (yet) anywhere near **real** numbers March/April 

No, imaginary numbers. Tell me... difference reported numbers ""real"" numbers? 1%, 50%, 100%? idea ""real numbers"" fiction creating mind.

The numbers state categorically reported numbers, reported numbers higher time prior second wave similar first 

Nope.

Put simply, second wave reversal downward trend upward trend. magnitude wave essentially irrelevant. simple fact is, first wave came end late May number new cases began drop, despite number tests increasing.

Then beginning September number new cases per day began increase, increasing ever since.

That second wave... period. say that?  personally think person recurved placebo. contracted covid19 died form it. course, isn‚Äôt confirmed, think happened.

Also getting flu shot still generally good reducing severity flu since body still somewhat recognizes virus.

It's also suspected reduce viral load flu, means spread less.

Ideally prevents flu... less severity means higher chance recovery. old sick people die flu. Young healthy people sometimes suddenly develop critical symptoms die alarmingly sudden way. One morning feel like flu, afternoon ICU doctor talks family odds recovery.

Stay healthy take care yourself! way saying idea. I'm economist, epidemiologist. know enough epi sound somewhat less stupid. think relevant. reason flu vaccine 100% effective given season mainly due antigenic drift; that's reason get one every year, yes partially guesswork that's necessary due antigenic drift. Guesswork that's also necessary dealing totally new strain virus (probably lot guesswork). reason totally effective partially due reason COVID vaccine be. effectiveness depends immune system healthy older people already sick people effective immune response. 

They definitely first get vaccine they're risk mortality, inconveniently they'll also one's least effective (compared healthy young people) preventing personally getting COVID.

And that's many healthcare pros saying vaccine enough get case numbers point threat aging sick populations. we'll still need distance mask happens. trial double-blinded? known?

Or could move lives knowing 0.02% 0.003% ever suffer significant issues winter, think willing.

Or immediately, EUA granted,+ vulnerable front line vaccinated hospitalizations start go shortly after. 

I'm excited conversations becoming common every passing day. 

We're almost start end. Hang guys.  Yeah leap mink mink.

I get feeling pulled ass tested positive COVID-19 forty mink farms Netherlands. mink showed various symptoms including respiratory problems. seems animals got infected employees. **Research since shown mink transmitted virus other.** also plausible employees infected mink. mandatory screening Dutch mink farms instituted infected mink farms culled 5 June. mandatory closing scheme Dutch mink farms introduced spring also don‚Äôt know percentage COVID cases become ‚Äúlong-haulers.‚Äù gather it‚Äôs fairly small.

Oxford study week said 60% people study (18% hospitalized patients, 82% recovered home - average age 44) showed organ damage scans couple months road. 85% reported still symptoms several months later. That's point I'm trying illustrate, everyone asking you, basically exactly that; disregarding what's already trying apply personal experience reason

Umm, I'm not. personal experience nothing this. I'm talking actual point above, maybe bad probably worse personally experienced? I'm even American, I'm Canadian, even relatively lower numbers, parents friends (plural) either die, survive ICU serious damage afterwards. using personal experience go around saying death rate 20% subjective experience? I'm not, that's using personal definition downplay severity bad someone whose terrible personal experience exaggerating point view.

Again, I'm attempting downplay virus, I'm saying specific article misleading. ""Highest numbers since August"" *doesn't mean anything, own. mean virus overall bad!* I'm even accounting friends family currently living Asia Europe right either.

You're literally telling I'm using anecdotes, arguing nothing anecdotes. I'm arguing actual someone else said, giving hypothetical, loads actual numbers contrary experience?

Because seem understand point I'm making, I'm trying simplify you. listen Johnny Cash: Live San Quentin album tribute. ""Serological tests, look antibodies determine someone ever virus, even starker, showing 7.1% positive rate among children, compared 1.7%-4.8% rate among adults June 28 September 14."" line that's available one learn reading comprehension. ""Serological tests, look antibodies determine someone ever virus, even starker, showing 7.1% positive rate among children, compared 1.7%-4.8% rate among adults June 28 September 14."" I'm discussing efficacy theoretical vacuum, rather likelihood adhered to. Ah. understanding Danish failed me.

Insulin producing cells don‚Äôt regenerate. could, would cured diabetes already. That‚Äôs big deal medical community. Which, turn, makes wonder BNO knew person‚Äôs death due COVID-19 first place, can‚Äôt find record university actually saying this. It‚Äôs like BNO don‚Äôt record laughably sensationalist. may technically work, isn‚Äôt reasonable. social isolation wrecked life apparently isn‚Äôt ending years, I‚Äôm already verge giving entirely. literally around spouse isn‚Äôt remotely enough. Barely functioning due depression causing, need also wear mask day everyday home? Fk that. honestly don‚Äôt care die. hope do. Genuinely. Wtf live for? Nothing. Bring if, covid. What's positivity rate? doesnt need too? dogs used sniff drugs, see can't coronavirus. dont know guys think asia wears masks time they're altruistic perfect. maybe wear one air sucks sick. would never see like 1-2/10 people wearing masks public place Yes science, type one isn‚Äôt diet. That‚Äôs simplistic view. greater costs outside death, virus creating generation people permanent, debilitating disease like diabetes pulmonary fibrosis. Masks almost certainly going become seasonal fixture, least. many people focused direct mortality considering larger picture pandemic, common misconception among lack scientific literacy medical experience. competent health authority, making bold statement eight months pandemic. 

Meanwhile Japan masked since February. person got placebo home country? would suppose it‚Äôs guessing game country hardest restrictions coming months. 

I really don‚Äôt think see hard lockdowns Sweden. curfews. Distance learning universities bars/restaurants serving outside - perhaps

A positive thing Sweden‚Äôs approach kind restrictions since beginning tweaks it. probably winter, tweaks depending current state infections. supporting Bolsonaro, know is?
Also edited post, saying ""Finally Bolsonaro got right"" before. yet, comments surprise fact CTV news. Commentators come shape sizes, national news outlet thinks twice posting. even happen extremely minor symptoms too, people, think clear one day 100¬∞ fever symptoms. boyfriend exactly exposed symptoms showed, though get test, recently started showing minor fatigue muscle pains nothing seems helping much. fatigue symptoms almost exactly like mine much bearable, minus tachycardia/chest pains. Even worse: six-foot guideline schools *when possible,* district decided ""within 6 feet"" ""6 feet separation"" functionally thing. ever place could murdered stuffed barrel acid, SA would there...

Feels WA moment too. death 6 months. community transmission 6 months. Trains packed, people wearing masks looked like used - weirdo conspiracy nuts. Why? Back April Western Aus locked 6 weeks test tracers went testing blitz.
I able keep working, economy booming, Im getting job offers daily higher pay rates last 10 years. Local tourism booming internationals. cant travel.
Pretty good outcome pandemic line thinking even accomplish? Regardless whatever mental gymnastics want order get disingenuous stat fits narrative, GET COVID DEAD. people religious, aren‚Äôt actually Christians.  thought best defense socially isolate much possible. already announced placebo group confirm. Friends texas cared since day 1 became spreaders around country. weird mentality ""I get"" ""texan freedom"" thing. Texans care elaborate?  Ty! reason call guy ‚Äúfascist supporter‚Äù, don‚Äôt let ego loose mister. I'm totally ok people making choices different own. I'm opening things up, choose go like risk. people want. tell people wear helmet motorcycle, wear seatbelt (except I'm driver.)...that's them. that, asking trouble.

Do source information please.

Thanks doubts already -- due largely federal government 'just putting things there', favoring chosen spokesmen disregard appointed Congressionally confirmed disease experts inspiring distrust so. 

The admin left state leaders choice reassure citizens they'd evaluate whatever federal government goes with, admin shown really take evaluation seriously. put things there, put it. everyone. Clearly haven‚Äôt Kentucky Kansas blame every problem immigrants. Ok? People back saw *huge* amount death.

It would still crazy, quite crazy would us.  bad complain county HR enforcing masks? feel like asking HR mask enforcement backfire county ever looks complaint here? thought US selling country highest bidder. 20x less

EDIT : Actually 446/38 like 12x less. Yes, actual numbers support point. using simple example understanding. obvious. yet, many comments show people determined miss obvious.

Of course, virus spread household setting.  would anyone think differently? there‚Äôs vaccine Bloomberg news reporting placebo. Pascal Soriot co. must known while, yet trial set resume US shortly, corroborates Bloomberg hopefully indeed placebo given volunteer. Certainly, highly infectious virus.  key try something.  keep numbers down. 8m cases.  I'm sure there's ratio could compare two total population country.

Pretty sure lockdown necessary much people right thing.  Since people refuse right thing refuse enforce rules, lockdowns become recommendation. unscarred lungs ostracized moron. half assed contract tracing apps implemented west suck.

The invasive mandatory tracing apps implemented east effective. paused two people fell I'll think might onto something that. hope so. agree basically everything said. discussion going 3-6 months, effective vaccine not.

Edit: every word typo. economic carnage would last generation huge deterrent too. point care lot pizza restaurant owner 90 year old grandma nursing home.

I want China buy Western companies pennies dollar time over, securing economic destruction countries. We‚Äôve seen. burns pretty bad dies months.

Asymptomatic people tested ""samfundsspor"" yellow colour. People hospital symptomatic tested ""sundhedsspor"" blue colour. Imagine understanding diabetes lung failure. Well, guess don‚Äôt to. Well least flag big plus. cat picky fucking food, he'd murder potato chips. anyone know test protocol vaccine? i.e. many events (i.e. positive cases placebo + vaccine combined) check interim data, final data? agree non-lethal outcomes tend elicit less fear lethal ones. That‚Äôs part problem. mortality rate doesn‚Äôt include people lifelong, debilitating disease like diabetes neurological damage lung damage. lung transplant patients don‚Äôt make past 5 years don‚Äôt include mortality rates. economic cost far greater anyone seems appreciate weren‚Äôt particularly healthy country begin with. 

But restrictions shouldn‚Äôt informed based people appetite for, otherwise never would shut begin with. supposed informed science. far, hasn‚Äôt consistently case. That‚Äôs US failing response. worse,

I subscribe knee jerk reaction. People dying right now. 200,000 died US... 400 odd thousand died 2nd world war country. 

People purpose, comradery, friendship, solidarity. Basic human needs met pandemic. People starved socialization, touch, friendship.

I'm melodramatic say: I'd rather fight Nazis Europe sit room nothing social interaction 1 year. I'm dead serious. Probably best way forward 'circuit breaker' lockdown 1 month?, followed really tight restrictions (schools online, restaurants closed, mandatory wfh) vaccines distributed. guy persistent  CDC says 10 days aren‚Äôt contagious. It‚Äôs much 10 days. Thank fuck concerning antibodies fade cells help produce them? Yes tends happen hospitals. American whose country linearly increasing mode last 4 months, it‚Äôs better. next six months going scary AF anyone paying attention. Fucking kek would basis vaccine ready sars vaccine available :( even relevant, getting flu shot getting flu (it happened once) doesn‚Äôt equal getting flu shot dying flu. Right? also much larger world population, *massively* larger elderly population (as well massively larger number people obese/diabetic/exposed huge amounts pollution).

If virus arrived 1,000 years ago, effect would barely noticeable compared normal diseases deal with. Even today, poor countries young populations little medical infrastructure seeing low death rates nearly population belongs low-risk groups.

Ironically, modern medicine probably increased fatality rate covid, means far people survive 80s live serious conditions make vulnerable. lot great articles, ask weekly question thread looking anything specific. antibody cross protection despite mutations :""Neutralizing antibodies early cases SARS-CoV-2 infection offer cross-protection SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant."" increased infection transmission rate, imperative determine whether antibodies induced D614 isolate may cross-neutralize G614 variant. report, profiling anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity reveals similar neutralization profiles protein variants, albeit waning neutralizing antibody capacity later phase infection. findings provide insights towards validity current immune-based interventions."" realize placebo means didn‚Äôt get vaccine right? literally says right headline think difference messaging huge problem. many people talking eradicating I‚Äôve learned accept it‚Äôs always going circulate. Hopefully, it‚Äôs going severe future become flu type thing. We‚Äôll also probably much better treatments future sever. I‚Äôm personally ok that. Trial stage vaccines always side effects.. Hopefully proves unrelated can't put hope getting vaccine solve right away. Trump II get permission Trump I. 11 never late proper elimination lockdown. extreme one Wuhan wiped disease 76 days. slightly relaxed one Australia wipe 100. actually are. alternative exponential growth overrun hospitals. avoided both.

That's twice entire country's worth entirety pandemic every day. 

It's mind boggling. Sigh...this headlines incredibly irresponsible cat ladies take seriously will. 300,000 excess deaths even consider option country covid free less quarter year.. pray USA... issues disease

\*Virus would increase spread virus!

Madrid - 21 oct 2020 - 09:09 CEST

After several weeks apparent stability, number coronavirus cases Spain continues rise. Health Ministry‚Äôs latest report pandemic, released Tuesday evening, showed 13,873 new confirmed cases added 218 victims official death toll, stands 34,210. brings 14-day cumulative number coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants 322.9, new record data point since health crisis took hold country.

Between end March April, propagation virus much greater, according studies. statistics lower now: outset pandemic, serious cases recorded, whereas many mild asymptomatic infections included figures. means last weeks October worst official data terms diagnoses. number victims, however, far darkest days first wave, 900 Covid-19-related deaths reported single day.

If cases continue rise, inevitably number victims too. prelude fatalities, pressure country‚Äôs health system, rising unchecked weeks now. fact, data point experience apparent fall cases seen first weeks October, appears small plateau continuous rise. According yesterday‚Äôs report, 11% Spanish hospital beds occupied Covid patients, percentage doubles terms intensive care unit (ICU) occupation.

But trend means carved stone. Sources Health Ministry admit spread virus unpredictable, huge growth pandemic across Europe exactly prompting optimism. Everything depend success, otherwise, measures Spain‚Äôs regions putting place order curb spread virus.

The latest ministry report shows rising trends Spain‚Äôs regions, apart Madrid, area see fall cumulative incidence compared day before. Even Canary Islands ‚Äì zone Spain fewer 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants 14 days ‚Äì seen rise. end scale, worst-hit region right now, Navarre, exceeds thousand cases per 100,000 inhabitants, tomorrow subject perimetral confinement among social measures. Crazy...went grad school top ranked private university.

must bought way in.  They'll funny laugh at. expect there'll r/publicfreakout type videos Karen freaking somebody store keep 6 feet space long social distancing mandates lifted. Lol grew California moved around settled MN, kept hearing everyone say ‚ÄúMN nice‚Äù honestly thought 90% joking shits fucking joke. people taking ‚Äúnice‚Äù trying brag give pat back holding back impulse. places lived always around distribution nice assholes, least CA don‚Äôt run around talking bullshit like ‚ÄúCali Kind‚Äù. less cases db wasnt overloaded, tests almost exclusively performed state labs, negative backlog, difference sisa numbers reality big nobody cared.

now every day see clickbaity headlines ""world record positivity rate"" bullshit, course fix it. stopped slowed. Hopefully small breaks. 

Vaccine preferable controlled, would help keep resistance lulls outbreaks. Man it‚Äôs like maybe kids going back person school wasn‚Äôt good idea? üôÑ south rise Lol grew California moved around settled MN, kept hearing everyone say ‚ÄúMN nice‚Äù honestly thought 90% joking shits fucking joke. people taking ‚Äúnice‚Äù trying brag give pat back holding back impulse. places lived always around distribution nice assholes, least CA don‚Äôt run around talking bullshit like ‚ÄúCali Kind‚Äù.  use baking soda mouth washing hear lot people saying people vaccinated, viable less restrictuve containment measures become. Test trace becomes lot easier less spread going on. Luckily, still see many wear incorrectly number unexpected fatalities calculated National Statistics Institute Spain double official coronavirus death toll. total nearly 59,000 since March

20 oct 2020 - 10:05 CEST

Statistics Spain show 11,000 excess deaths second wave coronavirus, compared period last year.
-

Since deaths causes, difference observed expected death count since July, using data National Statistics Institute (INE) based civil registry records, could partly explained summer heat.

But Carlos III public health institute, runs mortality monitoring system called MoMo, categorized 1,959 deaths caused heat year, number last year.

The 11,000 figure twice official coronavirus death toll notified Spanish Health Ministry, registered 5,400 Covid-19-related deaths since July. graph shows evolution different factors could explain difference. one hand, ministry counts victims tested positive coronavirus. point time, people dying without test, contrast situation March, individuals clear symptoms getting checked also possible information released ministry incomplete date. known fact SiViES system used regional authorities send data Health Ministry shows half many Covid-19 hospitalizations count made actual hospitals. similar problem could explain difference 5,400 deaths relayed SiViES 11,000 excess deaths observed civil registries across Spain compared period last year. average last five years used, difference 10,800 excess third possibility excess death count includes deaths causes. could individuals whose illnesses went undiagnosed crisis months, received poorer medical treatment. cases would part official Covid-19 death tally, yet could attributed overall health crisis caused virus.
Evolution since March

The graph shows daily evolution official coronavirus deaths according ministry‚Äôs count, excess deaths observed civil registries compared last year, based INE data:

The salient aspect graph first wave, produced 47,000 excess deaths spring. There, too, clear official figures lagging behind. Civil registries counted thousands deaths March later added official death toll. INE‚Äôs data, published every two weeks since June, show May June ministry still adding deaths occurred earlier according registry death records.

The graph shows another peak early August. probably reflects unspecified number coronavirus deaths combination heatwave, typical cause excess deaths. According Carlos III Institute, high temperatures may caused 2,000 deaths course two three weeks around early August. figure last year, although 2019 peaks occurred July.

Since early August, death records continued show fatalities previous years, total 11,000 last year. Together excess deaths since March, total comes nearly 59,000. INE figures, therefore, suggest real death toll coronavirus close 59,000, although official death toll around 33,000.

Regional differences

The impact second wave also broken regions. Arag√≥n, Extremadura, Castilla Le√≥n, La Rioja, Andalusia, Balearic Islands, Castilla-La Mancha Murcia recorded excess deaths 14% since July. graph shows excess deaths observed civil registries compared last year (expressed absolute numbers, percentages per 100,000 inhabitants). also includes ministry‚Äôs official death toll.

Arag√≥n showing greatest excess deaths since summer. outbreak contained July, fatalities accumulating. also significant excess deaths parts Spain hard hit virus, Castilla Le√≥n La Rioja ‚Äì regions high incidence virus Madrid Navarre.

Andalusia Valencia region show excess deaths 15% 13% summer months, even though official death counts represent less quarter total. Part difference could explained high temperatures, probably all.

All figures worse March. every three Madrile√±os expected die normal circumstances, five instead. proportion three deaths Castilla-La Mancha every two expected deaths, seven deaths Catalonia every five expected.

These numbers confirm excess deaths recorded current crisis cannot compared anything else last years. Heat blamed around 2,000 deaths 2019 around 800 2018. none numbers comparable 58,000 since March year.

Boris Johnson impose U.K.‚Äôs tightest coronavirus restrictions Greater Manchester Thursday night, talks local leaders broke down.

The prime minister warned lives would risk region government failed act, left open prospect national lockdown infection rates continued spiral.

In news conference Tuesday, Johnson said U.K. ‚Äúnarrow path‚Äù want impose England-wide lockdown ‚Äúunless absolutely to.‚Äù

Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham warned ‚Äúpoverty, homelessness hardship‚Äù would rise ministers agreed provide 65 million pounds ($84 million) -- ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù Burnham said needed protect businesses.

But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said region would receive 22 million pounds funding, alongside extra support line packages given Liverpool City Region Lancashire, also top tier. Parliament accused Labour ‚Äúplaying political games.‚Äù

The Labour Party force symbolic vote House Commons Wednesday calling government deliver ‚Äúa fair deal‚Äù communities facing Tier 3 restrictions.

Complex Rules

Under top tier restrictions, pubs bars serving meals close, households can‚Äôt mix indoors outdoors settings, people strongly advised travel area.

The new three-tier system brought simplify complex rules around social distancing across country. Greater Manchester row highlighted far Britain‚Äôs response pandemic fractured along political geographical lines.

Johnson‚Äôs coronavirus strategy also sparked criticism Conservative MPs. Graham Brady, chair influential Tory backbench 1922 committee represents part Greater Manchester, warned Parliament ‚Äúthe lockdowns cost lives well livelihoods.‚Äù

William Wragg, another Tory MP region, said: ‚ÄúI cannot fear medicine worse disease.‚Äù

Official figures released Tuesday showed 241 people tested positive coronavirus died hospitals across U.K., 21,331 new cases reported. brings total number confirmed deaths nationwide 43,967 ""Bored? telling BORED? Sonny, know BOREDOM is. live Coronavirus 2020. boredom."" Hopefully we'll get sorts numbers. 70% herd immunity *everyone* vaccinated. 

Until we've reached HI well need measures keep virus check, expect gradually loosened. becomes political question ones get rid first. Better yet invest bidet.

Will better financially environmentally. leak followed people home large family gatherings. Hmm 50 milion year? Wow, Spanish Flu took little much seriously. Masks reduce transmission, prevent. better mask, reduction. sounds awful really explains US isn‚Äôt able get control.

Unfortunately broken 30 minutes ago one two community cases spent 3 hours pub Friday night. 10-12 hours got infected, meaning almost certainly infectious yet. like 8+ million cases right now? Probably lot. Czechia average 29% test positivity last checked days ago... cousin ER Dr UW, talked months I'm sure working ass right Yeah know guys; can't see oral hygiene plays huge role here. Mostly great Germany beginning pandamic and... well... US passport pretty worthless right now, places accept without quarantined. 106 deaths today too, lot per capita country 10.7 million people :( also test positivity rate 29% last checked days ago.

COVID utterly exploding Czechia truly staggering degree.

 since barely affected COVID earlier year, almost everyone still susceptible it. shush 18 fishermen, 5 new imported cases 2 connected port worker (both already isolated close contacts). Oh I'm also excited wave lawsuits ""Were loved one forced work SARS-COV-2 pandamic? may entitled financial compensation."" Trump says lotta shit. get hopes up. dont closed borders. mainland brings lot infections. said ""flatten curve,"" think meant max hospital capacity. There's probably going holdout group r/collapse type crazies who'll still insist virus apocalyptic even pandemic reigned. dont closed borders. mainland brings lot infections.

LOL talk taking something literally Fauci expects vaccine 70% effective guy charge US vaccine effort expects 80%-90% effective.

Some good news: small sample size obviously, Oxford's vaccine 100% efficacy two doses.

Are really looking herd immunity short term? Always felt like ending pandemic would take vaccinating vulnerable health care workers. going see crazy documentaries confident lot strongman leaders going absolutely dragged. worship Nurgle. can't convince plague rat. know how, reason, futuristic movies seems like bunch people wear masks public?

Disease-awareness injected directly populace entire world right now, way nothing like has.

In future, peoples forever going disease-conscious reason alone we'll generally see mask usage, mention there's reason keep safe influenza, even common colds everyone else owns mask. Losers die covid! /s travel bubble. many others enter USA Mexico without restrictions.

In Macau, Chinese (and Macau residents) enter China quarantine. 

also nationalities banned (i think HKers Macau residents enter HK 14 days)

everyone entering China endure 14 days except traveling Macau. I'm looking forward telling kids grandkids lived crazy thing they're learning school. Also COVID-19 movies fact. Oops I'm sure talking about? I'm Sweden almost everyone happy response way handled it.

Ugh I‚Äôm sorry happened father suffering make lasting impact reasoning. üòì go chug beers share joints infected friends. see easy. Spanish Flu killed many people 1918 1922 actually. Three years multiple waves around world virus mutated became less fatal.

It also killed many people time knowledge viruses causing illness. antibiotics help prevent deadly secondary Pneumonia. antivirals medications prevent runaway immune responses like Cytokine Storm. 

We also data show many people actually virus vs many people hospitalized killed it.

These factors making Covid look mild comparison, since data incomplete data today, ability test viruses today, ability treat stabilize critically ill today far extensive anything anyone alive 1918 could ever dreamed of.

You comparing raw numbers era provides us number hospitalized amount dead, ignoring lack data era would show many people would mildly ill completely asymptomatic exist. 

Youre also ignoring fact none technologies medications keep many dying virus today exist back then.

The question giving 2 cents start thread Covid happened then, treatments methods testing, ICU beds ventilators all. factors looked into, id still wager replaced 1918 H1N1 2020 Covid 19, would likely severe pandemic, brought back Spanish flu world today, would likely less deadly Covid due vaccines herd immunity provides, ventilators, antibiotics available mitigate effects severe illnesses. Yeah that's true. would create panic? worst Jan would amazing. That's like 2 months 2 weeks away. ""man made religions"" kind? word salad could come even CLOSE reason getting people walk next other, instead driving enclosed car, promise would take serious. Going start smoking weed avoid virus. point 210+k people died suffered died needlessly. wouldn‚Äôt callous probabilities family member dying, much sure. Every additional case comes careless flouting known scientific mitigation guidelines exponential danger high risk patients. virus doesn‚Äôt discriminate. 

In addition that, still don‚Äôt know long term effects even mildest cases, especially permanent lung, heart, organ damage. Great, maybe elect officials take shit seriously next election. bad lying Sweden's GDP fell relies exports. GDP flawed metric consider.

We're talking macroeconomics vs. microeconomics.

You bending backwards. showed doctor saying cases reinfection worldwide.

You disagree say actually common, nobody knows since many reasons science able detect it.

Either first time got didnt get tested, second time got died without getting test.

You say many ""hidden"" cases like .. WAY ""normal"" cases someone gets tested Covid twice.

Gotcha. Keep schools open keep distance. hard Man, must seriously suck American 4 year degree still doesn‚Äôt qualify residency Canada. Yep. sub hyper focuses worst possible scenarios time. 5% medical system overloaded. current US death rate 2% overall. So, headline pretty close fearmonguering. It'll probably become one seasonal diseases us every year. initial waves worst. 
Our bodies know know fight one exposure it. 

So will:

1. Cause immune system react disease, causing things like cydocine storms l, multisystem inflation reactions. turn kill people cause long term damage. 

2. Eventually get exposed someway (hopefully via safe effective vaccine) bodies learn fight memory cells anti-boddies hopefully successive waves less deadly.

3. spreads rapidly rushing process would create problems. hospitals get overhelemed case people die unnecessarily. Covid also mundane things like flu, car crashes, heart attacks, hospitals cannot cope surge. 

That's happened Spanish Flu. never went away adapted it. Spanish flu caused variant flu still us. day work, 32 single use masks.

How come Doctor wear one Mask 8 hour operation ?  catch HIV twice. several mutations transmit infected different strain.

That still push condoms positive partners.  brutal throughput compared saliva test. Stupid asses. death rates vary widely. system overloaded go cause poor treatment. spare capacity death rate less.

Yeah that‚Äôs back normal. say people getting used ‚ÄúNew Normal‚Äù things back pre-COVID like implied. would test positive would say ""Yes actually already Covid one time back April""

Person placebo arm. work harder everything safer keep numbers down. short planned shutdown able identify many cases possible test trace hope crank vaccines clonal antibodies, every trick book throw it.

I've saying damn long time need take world war. Humans vs Virus. thing closing borders reduce number potential imported cases. country controlled COVID epidemic (few cases), closed borders mandatory quarantine period international travelers (in government run facilities) makes lot sense prevent re-introduction virus. New Zealand excellent example this; closed early stringent lockdown bring cases 0. cases they've since imported cases they've able use testing contact tracing keep cases spreading.

Closing borders really help country already uncontrolled community spread spread driven domestic transmission. US good example closed borders China early on, COVID predominantly European strain. However time closed borders EU, already emerging outbreak New York major cities, meaning late closing borders real effect.

TLDR: context key. may going bit far say ""driving it"", certainly part it.

Keep mind contact tracing within households much easier many settings, particularly western nations ability obtain data phone signals, CCTV, etc. limited.  

It's pretty easy contact trace homebody gets infected someone else household isn't, whereas contact tracing social butterfly someone works public nation US infection runs rampant may next impossible.  many cases, really know people infected. healthcare system close collapse limited geographic area short period time.

The alternative healtchare system collapsing entire country without lockdown travel restrictions.

After starting school year remotely students last month, Boston Oct. 1 begun phased reopening, allowing 3,000 high-needs students attend in-person classes least two days week. next phase, would brought kindergartners pre-kindergarteners back school buildings, scheduled soon mid-October, recently delayed.

Despite country second-highest death toll, eight million Brazilians received laboratory tests mid-October, according Ministry Health, less tenth number people tested United States.

But, India, disease trending downward Brazil since early August. country reporting average 500 deaths day, half daily toll reported two months ago. big cities eased social-distancing measures opened schools, restaurants, beaches.

The number daily recorded infections Britain, includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland Wales, nearly tripled since beginning October. past seven days, Britain reported 127,622 new cases. Hospitalizations deaths also rising, parts country, intensive care units stretched limits. countries make Britain forging paths: England implemented tiered alert system; Northern Ireland ramping restrictions pubs restaurants, closing schools; Scotland implemented two-week tightening restrictions; Wales preparing enter two-week national lockdown.

Russia added 103,992 new cases past seven days.. government, however, resisted imposing even local lockdowns, although started enforce mask-wearing requirements capital, Moscow, recording one-third country‚Äôs daily new cases.

I guess one things extreme even cautious.

To precise, former hotspots 25% antibody prevalence. Antibody presence may provide protection. unknown protection quick enough stop infectiveness, is, long.

Coronavirus, general, reinfect although typically second infection milder.

Reading back, see point I'm grateful patience. going get worse get better. :)

Cases/Hospitalizations/Deaths continue grow until, France reaches inflection point combination (government action/population level behavior changes/the interaction 2 things) lower R0 1 everything start decrease.

I idea inflection point occur. wonder work still put us back office November like plan. makes feel better, schools Memphis, Tennessee close there's 25% positivity rate higher school.

Read again......***25%*** footnote, least AstraZeneca/Oxford trials, placebo group get saline, meningitis vaccine (against bacterial meningitis, effect COVID-19 risk). ensure placebo group also gets usual unpleasant side effects vaccinated - otherwise, it'd easy volunteers figure whether they'd got vaccine not. Yellow Fever vaccine close 100%.

My wife already unfortunately can‚Äôt. ELI5: point placebo? Can‚Äôt use people haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine control group?

Edit: question asked below, already answer, nevermind! Sorry see bright side things right first glance think good idea. thought, *what problems vaccine healthcare workers get sick pretty much time?* worry, mask opponent: successful campaign stop everyone wearing masks, lots people get breathe supplemental oxygen. That's win, somehow, guess? Well course, _vaccin_ placebo, assure you, 5g nanobots very, real. /s You‚Äôre breathing leftist lies! 

I‚Äôm embarrassed assholes add /s. idea upvoted, Poland highest immigration EU 2017.  lazy look stats 2018-2019, sure still top tier.Poland one first countries fully close border mid-March. So, cases low election small uptick. would say main cause second wave schools EU pressured Poland keep borders open EU countries stop quarantining people.  sure areas, Warsaw good job tracking cases wearing masks asked. That‚Äôs exactly said, get downvoted hyper introverts want justify shut lifestyle. Elimination depend whether vaccines high efficacy duration. virus low survival profile, cant persist host environment block transmission disappears quickly. little 50% herd immunity could eliminate virus summer. mater preventing imported countries. easy. Thats thing majority Australia open, Western Australia COVID 6 months now. VIC NSW, easing continued periods community transmission becoming common. Lockdowns, aggressive supression contact tracing quarantine work bud. VIC went 725 month ago 0-1 cases reported last days. short term prediction? cellular immunity bodies develop infected live virus provide protection life

The reinfections say otherwise. One death necessarily mean work. Even vaccine 99% success rate (some higher thankfully - Yellow Fever vaccine example) always unfortunate 1%. ....... also prevent getting disease? *sigh* potentially correct.... It‚Äôs like J.J. Jameson editor-in-chief 2020. Since AstraZeneca makes vaccine, absolutely certain fudge statistics. /s  know. I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúso what‚Äôs news here?‚Äù trial paused USA? paused month now. quite simple. one, too-large portion population lacks internet access even computer home. 

Money. government MUST provide financial assistance unable work well businesses operate. 

Education. Remote learning presently quite terrible younger students even children pre-K - middle school. must improved. 

Adherence. people it. people things really harm anyone. people things harm others, people must punished order discourage behavior. 

And things can't think of. 

***HOWEVER.*** address things, it. case, astrazenca placebo another different vaccine. One meningitis. 

Which clever. vaccines side effects (sore arm, fever, etc). that, everyone trial getting batch side effects prevents short term immediate side effects tell placebo apart. say instead throwing around random insults. equivalent United States recording 238,920 cases 2,727 deaths one day. Mostly, people transmit home, work parties, masks worn.
Masks mostly prevent coupling social circles droplet fomite food infection. See happens.s open tourism Read title again. died covid. Unpopular opinion sub, smh vacccine supposed ready september?? happened? damage lock nothing compared big economic depressions like one 2008. least that's economist Tom√°≈° Sedl√°ƒçek said interview. April May, view may changed since then. 

I'm really worried China buy western companies. look stock market, prices drop, low. Also, companies (unfortunately) go bankrupt, IMHO local companies replaced local companies. like covid going destroy Volkswagen.

Please prove otherwise data opinions experts. lucas county? Holy shit. That's pretty big change. first I'm hearing it. Doubt change much schools though, they're pushed hard state federal level. Yet another reason prioritizing subsidizing lab-grown meat, plant-based meat substitutes, small-scale pasture-raised meat. Easy island 5 million. I‚Äôve said sub believe 100,000 deaths/year probably around mark people US comfortable.

Age distribution matters too. 100,000 middle school children vs 80 year olds, would matter. Gotcha. waiting this. forgot use word ‚Äúsheeple‚Äù writing worse flu. italy's economy tied turism lol think pretty obvious winter coming northern hemisphere, weather sucks people staying inside spreading others.

In words, behaving expected cold flu season. think trump wuldve done anything different happend last year? really curious people change story Covid still around, turns wildfire winter. country, take fewer tests number newly infected goes high, subsequently getting lower numbers. lower amount tests reveals lower amount newly infected, experts say country stabilised infection. 

How one evaluate potentially sketchy information, coming officials national channels?

Do understand now? could well allergen placebo I‚Äôm curious how. suppose top safety.  Personally, think surveys premature. winter, think willing. article April 24. vitro mean effective people. HCQ considered viruses due 'in vitro' including HIV, effective. 

It's clear researchers looking effective drugs. said, doctors read results current treatments. research hospital, going choose HCQ. However, aren't, doctors make judgement call, statistical difference mean 'no difference' outcomes. Sweden 586 deaths per million, Norway 51 per million, Finland 64 per million. US 685 deaths per million. early response US disaster. ‚ÄúBanning‚Äù travel China largely symbolic late, 40,000 people traveled back China ‚Äúban‚Äù, mention fact Europe major Covid outbreak NY/NJ came from. Lack ample testing contract tracing mixed messaging Trump others lead mess in. 

If successful Norway would less 17,000 Covid deaths vs 226,000 count at.

I'll see Australia month opening would placebo cause death? supposed harmful right? lot Mass same. 

This might shut down. also increased LOT testing, bad numbers anyways, need put context Right wearing mask essential. pandemic ends, it‚Äôs longer needed. Totally easy: Transmission rate 1, shown Asia, almost eradicated times.

Current Western measures sufficient almost sufficient Summer.

With new improving measures like fast breath check, saliva antigen LFA testing, vaccines, better TTI, public measures become unnecessary. Well people need tips lot people dumb hell.

Note placebo vaccine trial usually another, already approved vaccine.

Vaccines inert, cause inflammation minor side effects since designed stimulate immune system. easiest way mimic give people another vaccine. think missed jajdaks sarcasm. We're talking wearing home. wear public asshole. right exist buck naked home. let tits out, let face out, end story. Pretending remotely annoying masked home makes look insane even sub. 

The health advice say happy it, says wear it. Anybody claiming they're perfectly comfortable arguing good faith. think they're comfortable comply health advice. trying enforce thought crime.

## Abstract

The recent emergence rapid global spread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose unprecedented medical socioeconomic crisis, disease caused it, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared pandemic World Health Organization (WHO) March 11, 2020. Chinese scientists physicians rapidly identified causative pathogen, turned novel betacoronavirus high sequence similarities bat pangolin coronaviruses. scientific community ignited tremendous efforts unravel biological underpinning SARS-CoV-2, constitutes foundation therapy vaccine development strategies. Here, summarize current state knowledge genome, structure, receptor, origin SARS-CoV-2. Yes, that's everybody passes one another courtyard.  First lockdown Italy (I'm calling ""first"" we're probably heading towards new one soonish, sadly); worked tho, people staying home even though many different types businesses open, general sense fear really helped.
Ultimately, fear drives people careful, fear infection fear fines. Actually, Europe ahead us Fall/Winter wave, ahead us spring. know what's coming, idiots something still can. 

""When adjusting population, number new coronavirus infections EU U.K. overtaken United States."" places like Ireland California already announced intentions so. new phenomenon, though underlying mechanism may may new. virus cause autoimmune reaction causes production cross reactive antibodies attack pancreas, damaging point person develops type 1 diabetes. He's denier. add, scarcity beds one hazard, compounded staff shortages. easier faster increase spaces patients train nurses. much restrictions though. government prepare testing capacity, nothing strengthen healthcare system. Also, marginalizing covid, sent message electorate there's nothing worry about. was. restrictions. government fucked every single aspect. mistake!  one blaming Trump covid-19 existing monkey fault mong meeting never specific vaccines covid, always discussion general licensure vaccines, going create plan quickly review accept vaccine applicants. Everyone essential, everyone needs working interacting public short while.

I‚Äôm entirely sure tailors list open stores, example. Well yes island quite closely surrounded many European countries, far far higher population NZ issue early care homes lot deaths occurred. mask?

As gave 1 mask April never again? Next Easter. normal got bad worse covid 

People looking money, doctors treat patients badly here. grandfather admitted, treated badly mother got real pissed 

When mom created scene trying tell us patient leave immediately

The doctors inhuman sad issue. 

I'd guess 50% IFR applied early viral phase, bullshit happening around it, really hard say.  None said disproves said. claim Covid X deaths Y, increase Z. showing increase greater claimed. come back million claims, fact number deaths per week rose originally claimed. 

And never said additional deaths Covid deaths, though are. 

But also think deaths like car accidents job accidents likely decreased time frame. 

The claim economic recession increase deaths isn‚Äôt founded historical precedent. Yes, recessions deaths despair rise, overall mortality rates actually decrease - horrible example. 586 deaths per million vs neighbors Norway 51 Finland 64. Plus Sweden‚Äôs economy took big hit regardless. American Florida tell rookie numbers. never gonna get big league pump up. Perhaps Czech government communications encouraging masks, I‚Äôve seen, eg fewer people wearing masks Texas. What‚Äôs like brainwashed media See ""compassionate care program"" program make available no/low cost. Especially insurance refuses cover it. right treatment life-changing often programs this, Jazz pharmaceuticals one apply even make decent income, profoundly indecent price tag...  Christ. massive lull cases rest developed world.  ""Papers, please""

No one sees absolutely dystopian is? Fucking losers, Italy 15000 yesterday. Yes, Fauci talking Fall/Winter wave months. bad listen. I‚Äôll take partisan misinformation $300 please Alex. cant good learning environment. Reap sow? turned 18. think they‚Äôre blaming fact it‚Äôs online teachers. liquor licenses four Houston bars suspended establishments failed follow state‚Äôs coronavirus safety rules, according Texas Alcoholic Beverage officials said Tuesday licenses Lux Lounge, Standard, Spire Sol Billares suspended 30 days part weeklong effort enforce state‚Äôs COVID-19 health safety protocols.

If everything back normal Texas suspending liquor licenses? schools New York open cases.

Not sure means really. I‚Äôm sick sure

That's exactly I'm talking about. agree people going wearing masks reason think willingness mask there's chance passing disease someone else.

Anyway, like wearing masks beard Covid came along like keep face warm outdoors. much initial dose take second time breakthrough ""immunity"" cause re-infection. Thats real question. administration similar US, states fairly large autonomy choosing vaccine trial/cooperation want. least 4 vaccines trial Brazil, president wants Western vaccines.

 Expect kind political vaccine war countries too, maybe USA since federal administration alike Trump anti-China. update 7 days ago.

Rapid rises around Frankfurt Main  even close. making sure get pandemic fast possible also gain freedom fast possible. longer people like kicking screaming unfair everything longer pandemic take longer without freedom. exists point ""completely open"" ""lockdown"" cases maintained low level control rods move cases rise fall. government allow it? can't break law, right? 60k year US alone sucks middle schooler car lol cant even go outside anything covid thing parents wont bring anywhere school dont even anymore. don‚Äôt use masks work anyway. None coworkers sanitize hands take masks box, me. I‚Äôd rather buy masks put one leave work. Wait til next year's freshmen go exact issue response still say ""poor freshmen"" build robust remote education system since know what's gonna happen. started us born.

As article says, technology makes easier misinformation spread, always concerted efforts make people believe lies disbelieve truth. peer reviewed journal posted in? Oh wait, blog domain created 9/15, probably alien sperm doctor. Even President Trump went much believes HCQ went treatment actually works came COVID19. HCQ tested exhaustively. Please...can move on.

Source URL: Yeah replied google hour ago. Thanks help. Hope stocks well. colors show active cases. still low per capital compared places country. whole post test show someone contagious normal. someone spread normal. would testing trump right give info Covid? long brings new infections, hospitalizations deaths level without interventions society deems acceptable (just guess... around levels flu), virus need go away vaccine success. [Former chairman German expert council health says take 4 years vaccinate German government already made clear return normalcy question herd immunity vaccine achieved. much next half decade life, then. No, well first lockdown, gotten cases really low. started picking September, government mandated masks growth continued virtually unabated. narrative ""masks solved first time, let's again"" largely reason terrible situation now. done anything actually lower interpersonal contacts, situation could hbave probably much better. pre-existing conditions, worried spreading family member, stay home? anyone doesn‚Äôt go back living relatively normal, masked, six-feet apart lives? doesn‚Äôt seem tough.

That‚Äôs logical solution. government never treated disease like before. start now? Clearly; post test shows someone contagious average. would testing trump give info. doesn‚Äôt virus anymore.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Uhhh, maybe give like 3-4 days put visit granny make sure test comes back negative proceeding? upside, noted increase rate daily cases seems plateauing. personally believe big problem comes December reopening. Let's honest, gonna take probably least 10 days see effect level 5. 2 weeks later already meet discuss reopen 1st December when. see numbers decreasing enough make judgement call around mid-November. might still see 600 800+ daily cases around time. add additional 2 weeks middle December. 1st December going evaluate surprise numbers still show like 400+ infected number least still seems relatively high. gonna do, open everything Christmas? Next lockdown probably January another 1-2 months. keep everything closed rest year hopefully open January low numbers June? think either everything shut rest year reopen shops Christmas season despite still high cases. tougher bout covid tend stronger immune response. 

So people like Grandpa higher chance get again. Unless wears mask, social distances touch face washes hands. 

Do think everyone getting reported tested? 
According CDC state Florida thousands deaths Pneumonia cases year median previous 5 years. everyone tested every death contributed Covid. thousands thousands deaths they're reporting. without doubt includes reinfections. 

When news circulating symptoms, said stay home go hospital gets serious. two friends mine get tested told stay home. Hospitals filled higher since August. recovered covid work pay bills, put terrible situations. Luckily they're relatively young. 

I think anyone panic virus. simple social distance, wear mask, use hand sanitizer can't wash hands, touch face wash hands. 38 million cases worldwide. couple dozen cases reinfection reported far,"" Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist World Health Organization, told CNN earlier week. 

It even year yet. last pandemic lasted 2 years. Like said article linked, Sars virus immune response getting lasted much longer covids antibodies. still know much covid 19. fear mongering.

Hahaha even test Chinese vaccines Brazil then? love hate government, simply true. part measures, shops forced close getting salaries employees reimbursed well half rent. *Press X doubt* I‚Äôve already addressed fact NY could everything perfectly would still fucked. New Zealand able shut travel country. 

NY ZERO control states border it. matter what, states border NY people fly NY taking precautions NY takes nothing stop spread virus. 

This ineptitude US federal government comes play. country whole take measures. that, air travel US would need halted. Travel land borders would need halted. federal government failed massively stopping spread.

So closing NY took drastic measures likes WUHAN, would still place now. second anyone crosses border flys open back new superspreader event takes place. Brazil already vaccine war... 
The vaccine contract Sinovac already finished 3rd trial given positive serologic institute (Butant√£) , state S√£o Paulo would already give vaccine end year. 

But dumb hell president says pay chinese vaccine cOmMuNIsM increase mirrors troubling national trend. state city‚Äôs stay-at-home orders ‚Äî intended stem spread COVID-19 ‚Äî also mean families stuck home often, data states indicate pandemic lockdowns correlated surge domestic abuse. state release draft emergency vaccine plan. local news Facebook post immediately followed 500+ anit-vax posts. We're trouble. 

Side bar: Nurses think they're way smarter are. anit-vax nurse license revoked. arn't y'all summer right now? MN got snow freezing week... low immigration

They lot Ukrainian immigrants. make parties

That's said though. envisaged phased return normal, tiers vaccinated descending order risk. Small steps beginning. need wait entire world population vaccinated like earlier comment said. Seeing articles reopening schools safe.

Frankly, hard time thinking something would normally would allowed now! That‚Äôs fine that‚Äôs expected. However, older population and/or risk start vaccinated, eases stress world. decrease amount hospitalizations, deaths, risk age/health group. Numbers go down, since less people prone catching virus. go away blink eye? course not, get us back normal quicker right now. tRump rudderless ship, America cling tiny victories vote ass office vote guy said something conceivably trump bashing. think he's asking legit question.

Trump clearly super spreader. still right he's negative? would imagine previously covid can't still spread run course longer it? subscribe newsletter, sir/madam? Bud... people cant even lift paper mask nose holes. makes think safe Halloween. 

The level delusion I've seeing reddit social media regarding Halloween fucking absurd. wait TB decides join party... Correlation absolutely *implies* causation, prove establish causation itself. 

That said article taking correlation. comparing rates. think concern continue use total cases proxy better metrics. even waste time, report case mortality. 

The reason people doubt using cases herd immunity argument. Namely, beginning outbreak case mortality would highest (people likely die would die). would relate future cases milder, thus skepticism total # cases useful metric. 

P.S. please mistake position. I'm steel-manning particular argument. Yeah, use phone lot less now.

### Abstract

Background: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) - coenzyme found every cell human body - involved hundreds critical metabolic processes. However, humans age, intracellular NAD+ levels decrease - depletion appears exacerbated complicated SARS-COV-2 infections. NAD+ depletion impairs antiviral defense systems ability optimally control inflammation. 


Methods: Ten consecutive acutely-ill presumed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients older 50 years treated over-the-counter nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), betaine, sodium chloride zinc sulfate (NMN cocktail). Eight patients positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 NAA test results, one patient clinically diagnosed COVID-19 based classic symptoms one patient excluded COVID-19 ruled out. COVID-19 patients monitored clinical evaluations, body temperatures room air (RA) oxygen saturation (O2 sat) levels. Serial inflammatory cytokine measurements chest X-rays (CXRs) done 7/9 COVID-19 patients. 


Results: Cases #1, 4, 7 10 critically-ill worsening O2 sats, pulmonary infiltrates inflammation prior administration NMN cocktail. Post-treatment, prompt clinical improvement seen including fever resolution 2-3 days (4/4), rapid CXR improvement (4/4), dramatic drops CRP (4/4) IL-6 (3/4) within 72 hours hospital discharge ‚â§ 5 days (3/3 cases). patient required ICU care intubation post treatment. Cases 5 8 (bilateral pneumonias prior CXRs) cases 2 3 (symptomatic outpatients failed trials hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin (AZ) zinc (Zn) CXRs performed) strong temporal relationship NMN cocktail use rapid clinical improvement. Patient #6 improved prompt fever symptom resolution premature NMN cocktail discontinuation relapsed. 


Summary: NMN cocktail resulted rapid dramatic clinical laboratory improvement older persons complicated SARS-CoV-2 infections. NMN without boosters deserves study elderly patients complicated COVID-19 treatment strong molecular rationale success, safely administered orally home critically ill hospitalized patients. Restaurants, bars, night clubs appear missing list. Except schools potentially prolific spreading hubs. Also, we're looking vaccine 50% effective, 60% population vaccinated, 30% assumed real protection. 

That said, competent leadership, can't see taking year vaccinate Americans willing vaccinated. Plus primarily older folks aren‚Äôt much distancing Stay strong Italy. getting first-hand experience virus. youre getting downvoted providing whole picture. people like undermine scare tactics. Seems be?

[What gives Guess put /s. apologies figured seemed obvious I‚Äôm surfer water absolutely flooded year feel pain lmao.

It‚Äôs tough year next year probably challenge getting better. push shit would cure even work? Would something cancels infection, prevents dying, prevents long-term damage...? Antiviral drugs difficult develop think anyone would call cures. nice, either COVID going anywhere, even vaccines work certain percentage time (estimated 60-70% best). Imagine started training dogs summer... need to. country burning down. early July getting 100 new cases day. early September grown 600 day. 9,000 day (average last week), reported 12,000 cases morning. 

This country 11 million people several densely populated urban centers. close infecting 1% population *per week.* (that would \~15,500 cases day). official numbers. 

With closed restaurants, bars, night clubs, dropping next 3 weeks. lets forget Covid leave alone youre protesting looting! freezing Texas.

I want kinds go school. Crazy think don't.

Would nice scientists supposed put faith into, lie, tell us classroom children fine, indoor activity not. forget extra spike Thanksgiving month earlier! really going compound New Year's spike. Mine has. old smaller plan Verizon went double last time, charged $15 x 2 data. I've gone times year never before. think came checking curbside pickup places data (and surfing wait). discovered deal (free) throttle data get close limit get overcharge...wish I'd known before! feel old now. No. Look Poland. Look Czech Republic. Look Israel. Look France, Netherlands, Belgium etc.

When schools open masks stop working since would need wear home protect children. die driving 40km/h. also die 300km/h. mean they're difference covid flu near non-existent.

Your brain near non-existent. Dr. Fauci Germany??? Yes, wrong. Deaths lag cases month, giving bit glance deaths Czechia right might give idea headed. Already \~1/4 deaths day attributed covid daily new cases hospitalisations keep increasing. Yeah. truly wonder people would pay attention message changed 'save planet' 'save ourselves/our future' something. Many people care helping others (planet) told helping future might make effort. literally seen animals person except zoo thats argument President Trumps outdoor rallies getting much crap? journalism dead. Everybody laughing UV orange guy said months later bombarded UV content. Hahaha Ironic considering EU one that's pulling COVID-19 cases weeks now. went low 14k 160k recent weeks. anyone seen future looking plan timeline vaccine rollout? know current front runners Phase 3, least one paused, know there's something like this?

1. Day 1 - Approval general use
2. First two months: hospitals, first responders, care facility residents workers
3. Third month: available general public. Shipments state health departments, pharmacies, National Guard (to administer public)? read article. wore mask voted Trump becuase according sub people get covid EU seeing much higher spike Canada. Thank heads up. look really appreciate it.  Lockdown early, mask mandate early, densely populated state, suburb pretty much 100% mask compliance. add Oregon already outdoorsy get fairly low numbers. real test winter. although doubt numbers higher reported, everywhere probably like that. Nobody ‚Äúright‚Äù ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. That‚Äôs problem everything right now. 
People want power people feel helpless year. It‚Äôs annoying shit ever. 
There‚Äôs nuance everything. 

People need get high horses already stop acting like know better everyone else. Nobody knows need better you. 

If time make judgement people‚Äôs decisions got time something better life. President Trump gonna get another 4 years watch whole video thing looking people outdoors, see thing Germany - people wear masks outdoors unless crowded (eg weekly/farmers markets standing line get store worst it) overly detrimental according numbers here. 

But we've mask mandates indoor transport scenarios since way back...in April? can't remember. feels like forever. also exceptions wearing mask resto seated table, think going become problem weather cold outdoor dining. I'll stick delivery, thanks.

Anyway, Czechs introduced mask mandates indoors September, wonder they're issues. Damn. That's crazy. Omg! think I've those! Thank name. swear used buy uptown. think people downvoting stuff

Edit: got messed now. want go home try make those. place got gone. elderly woman would make them. guy got probably best chef I've ever met. Holland read article saying thousands mink US died due human mink transmissions. say known cases opposite, yet. [CNN: Mink Covid Yes. Sorry grandma, people's economic livelihoods way important. another stock spiking press release never materializes like many stories I've read sub.

**\*Heavy breathing\*** Ahhhh see. Thanks explaining killing take go drinks. Anything central planners forgot list. Positivity today 8,5%, think 14,27% start count also populist brought Corona back.   open fun kissing jesus' cross

Because populists charge allowed that. allowed everything real restrictions whatsoever would unpopular. could used restriction hammer month ago, exponential gaining steam incompetent populists decided leaders despite vocal group idiots letting know disagree. 

But fully agree you, they'll understand. expert know able make good decisions data released! I'd probably need trusted expert explain, like Fauci. Nice, logical rebuttal resort playground nonsense. 


Have great day (: **Air flow** eats humidity temperature breakfast. 

So, yes, makes huge difference sitting outside vs inside. countries maybe single-home regard, terms general crowding chance germ-spread city-wise population density increased greater percentage population lives urban areas now. Yes Oxford version, may get atleast year. much doubt worked vaccines decade reply. nice day bud. idea talking about, Joe Biden Kamala Harris far left you, left. Sound like ~~centrist~~ fascist\*\* smart complex. 


\*\*Edit: Ooh also shilling proud boys. Definite fascist smart complex. lol? 

Remindme! 6 months Well sure there's hundreds regions cases preceded deaths weeks, happened past. currently surging region totally result? say yes lying Shut fascist Yea bud I‚Äôm ironic UK immune global warming then? Christian Drosten, Virologist RKI.

That's like time life finally get true independence get master destiny awhile difficulties adulthood kick ass.

I'm sooo glad deal something like covid time. graduate midst great recession so, ya know, can't all. people came got even luckier. Imagine graduating college like 2002 solid five years career building back everyone mom college degree. Plus hear drugs way better late 90s, everybody ODing tainted heroin time. issue opening schools, opening without plan make sure get ahead infections inevitably follow. America place differing values beliefs. It‚Äôs country built on. someone doesn‚Äôt agree doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre Russian agent. you‚Äôre looking data April lancet article October 19th, death rate 65-75 ~ 5%, 15% math side there, even better-than-expected vaccine better-than-expected rollout, we‚Äôre unlikely get level benefit herd immunity come fall next year. means social distancing mask wearing continue. 

Say vaccine 70% effective (that would fantastic) 50% population manages get two shots required (that‚Äôs best flu vaccine given year though polls show 66% Americans won‚Äôt get vaccinated first vaccines released). would give us 35% protection isn‚Äôt enough create herd immunity effect even able maintain current levels masking social distancing (which let‚Äôs face it, unlikely scenario people suffer Covid fatigue). Throw extra 1% include people already infected (assuming durable effective immune response contrary antibody studies indicate) still aren‚Äôt there. 

The sooner recognize reality situation, sooner people might start taking public response seriously. Part problem lot people expected virus gone already impacted behaviors made people depressed doesn‚Äôt turn way. science pretty compelling‚Äî virus isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon. going multiple-year ordeal. pandemics last 2 years. Buckle up. long vulnerable vaccinated there's little point keeping restrictions. Covid mostly harmless healthy (especially young) people. One risk overwhelming healthcare system gone, everyone rush reopen far possible. ultimate, arguably only, goal vaccine stop deaths spiralling control every time unchecked spread virus gets hand: eradication complete pipe dream, cases really ""just flu"", given know risk profiles, incredibly simple society manage. that's achieved, see things return normal. guys talking about?

At end day take sizable viral load 80% chance stay protected would still good idea wear mask public could taking chance many times day. You‚Äôd likely catch COVID *each instance* flip coin three times get heads time. Well king came back holiday this, shit go down. must angry us sure. Coronaviruses, unlike flu viruses, genetically stable built-in proofreading mechanism, estimated mutate rate 10% 25% flu viruses. hundreds variants true new strains, scientists call ""variants"" proven clinical differences (there one spike mutation might considered different strain point). Currently, antibodies generated existing variants work other, scientists still confident one vaccine cover all. Re-infection cases tend over-represent infections different variants variant caused first second infection, way prove re-infection post viral shedding. problem flu vaccine isn‚Äôt particularly effective least first round Covid vaccines likely bad

Wrong. vaccines currently Phase 3 trials estimated 75% 90% effective. binary, even vaccine prevent infection, it'll likely mitigate worst outcomes contracting virus. much worse public seems appreciate it‚Äôs maddening scientists watch public large continue risky behavior light currently understand.

Humans social creatures. going stop acting like humans ""scientists"" lab coat told us to. two year duration pandemic seems less less likely things get worse worse.

Tibet - major pain ass DeSantis ‚Äúoff table‚Äù Well else would explain it? I'm sure understand multiple concrete vs something lighter examples pertain situation. kind threw term relative. saying relative information different people? 

So saying economic projection? people use informtion specifically investing?

I guess really think way... seems less informative still studying trends I'm economist either Yes agree impossible without things, lockdown also gone longer bring cases zero. problem: either assume it‚Äôs impossible eliminate virus want limit damage dire situations, lockdown went long tough, try elimination, would required opposite strong travel restrictions after.

It‚Äôs middle road approach without real plan causing problems. course it‚Äôs Italian issue think see pandemic flu eventually, unless things change definitely going change. Everything cloud days.  would MUCH prefer online schooling. Honestly, whole pandemic awakened Agoraphobia me. fucking LOVE chilling home day, working, reading, watching movies, playing games fucking drive 2 hours dealing people's shit. Definitely yes.

The restrictions announced days ago ridicolous. drink seating starting 6pm instead 9pm.
Schools still opened, ""encouraging"" remote lessons high school students.
Gyms opened another week see.
Local events forbidden (the season local events small towns goes april september).
Exibitions forbidden UNLESS NATIONAL RELEVANCE.
1000 people allowed stadiums.
30 people allowed weddings.

At least regions starting enforcing curfews.. that's something. Others closing schools.

Let's say government expects regions enforce limitations officially lockdown probably should. There's also large debates around many people actually die flu year. seems like flu figures used compare COVID quite inflated. hospitalizations rising also. Thanks man. probably got Yesterday numbers. resident Moscow St. Petersburg? disagree political capital. think lack proactivity anything else. Opening schools, demographic least likely show symptoms, without adequate surveillance place catch cases chance spread far wide, likely culprit here. can't imagine coworker got idea place. Lol. also entirely untrue many businesses business owners would ruined shutdown. I'm 100% agreement businesses providing PPE. company construction years. hundreds thousands N95 masks shelves pandemic ever happened. 

Regarding shutdowns, company instance monthly payroll probably 2-3 million dollars union tradespeople management (office) staff. good year, high end range would company's margin costs expansion. company probably cash hand keep paying fixed costs (i.e. labor), way lights could stay shut would lay everyone off. probably safe assume way lower cause I'm sure tons people got virus never got tested know defining ""control"". Early chant ""flatten curve"" avoid hospitals overrun, largely successful, aside Italy early on. medicine starting catch up, reports several vaccine candidates stage 3 trials accurate. think reasonable people knew going surge going fall/winter. Everybody needs continue take reasonable precautions social distancing, wearing masks, etc, understand going get worse gets better.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: ""control"" defined zero cases, yes, agree achieving goal quite time. ‚ÄúSomeone different opinion hivemind‚Äù

Reddit: rUsSiA!!!1!1!!1! whole article. think would use animal-to-human contact. linked images, dogs could sniff sample containers. know sample might be, imagine twenty different methods.

Trainers would need avoid ""positive sample fatigue"" dogs. dogs normally find positives anomaly (drugs, explosives) training may need different used drugs, explosives, etc.

Or, say sniffing hole wall, large enough pup snout. ""negatives"" could volunteer go past hole one two times.

The dogs could rotated dog side wall, too.

I'm know nothing this, spitballing ideas. dogs better humans, it. fuck anyone pay covid test? Can't, especially since Ken Paxton Mike Morath fucking corrupt idiots. You.... linked two different articles state multiple bat species virus replicate, can't replicate them. actually read sources skim post links reddit try sound smart? Lol it‚Äôs actually inverse nice try Politicians don‚Äôt room ambiguous. read mandates though (which know republicans will) you‚Äôll see mean.

I can‚Äôt speak California Washington health mandate actually quite loose definitions even though it‚Äôs interpreted ‚Äú100% mask‚Äù never says health mandate, simply says interacting people indoors, even caveats.

I get mean though. want move past done point. Tired fighting people something childish. Living empirical evidence consume alcohol pregnant asking perfect study, impossible. Even severity different diagnosis across doctors. Totally. folks aware, think?

Exhausted confused, think. Things mostly control August people got complacent forgot, new rules brought confusing unclear, less ahered to. 

Having said that, anecdotal, mask wearing local pretty high. I'd say 20% people voluntarily wearing mask outdoors public, 100% compliance supermarkets I've to. BRUH. Top reference.
Every time see ""Thoughts &amp; Prayers"", mind think ""Adorable. Like cake crisis."" go store see diaper chins anti-maskers surrounding people wearing masks. see spitting others walk. Discarded wipes masks everywhere. Kids running around without masks parents poke nose people. People pull masks talk people. never see Spider-Man say ""mlm mlem mu mah"" comics. goddamned fabric. primarily killed people things treatable antibiotics steroids. never said masks work.

I said said. dad still going gas station everyday scratchers cookies. want workers paid fairly? frightens you?

Nope, funny completely misrepresent statement one come creeping comments know child miss something?

You literally made post it. look people's submission history avoid inevitable conversation teenager. started travel nursing pandemic. filling spots nurses laid initial wave. hospital hiring travelers paying ass get enough ICU nurses care people. nuts. I‚Äôm glad uncle really well.

Per CDC, death rate 70s age group ~ suggest risk significant illness 40- 50% (extrapolating general data). Needing oxygen bad sign, don‚Äôt give oxygen people don‚Äôt need harm good. also don‚Äôt get remdesivir unless actually need oxygen, again, medications side effects. don‚Äôt want one ruined president‚Äôs liver giving something didn‚Äôt need. real risk taking elevators everything within reach? much aerosol/virus suspension threat?

For example: use alone, using mask, sanitizing touches buttons surfaces, taking shoes after, etc, much danger virus that's air, left people took elevator me? articles studies particular issue?

Thanks lot. Keep trying what? I'm trying find study supports wearing cloth mask based evidence. Let know find one. agree, also acknowledge people share blame. instance. bar restaurant happens open mean good idea go pandemic... we‚Äôre quarantining inside since february due family healthy vulnerable lung issues... really wish darwin would work faster. much faster. space world narcissistic assholes literally protest simple masks inside stores public transport led restrictions also protest. hope get it, change dumb dumb minds... based speed spread won‚Äôt take long... able deny condition connect previous covid 19 infection. basically condition appears covid 19 infection listed caused previous infection.
Autoimmune conditions 
Heart circulatory conditions 
Respiratory conditions 

Were screwed healthcare costs control already. 

Think donations lobbying dollars pushed around right make happen. Hey guess uneducated fears wrong. wrong. wanted see people smarter would say going inside head. glad guys called out. probably continue made fun least know afraid afraid of. wrong. gonna like forever get vaccine probably continue due many saying take it. Right! lord forbid natural disaster mass accident event....on top flu. Pandemics inconvenient like pretend there. This.  people seem think cotton mask allows return complete normalcy say ""no one sick"" try get together friends family. damn scientist always speaking logic sound mind. TWIV Week Virology know Ok buddy. Keep trying. took walk city center month ago Uppsala. pouring rain quiet chilly (between 5-10C maybe) yet seats outside plenty people dining. definitely think gas warmers + roof makes difference. many refuse dine restaurant cafe outdoors seatings. 

Question makes difference dine outdoors winter cold humidity low (studies show virus spreads easily low-humidity). bubble boy sucks ones right thing suffering (other people get Covid lose jobs course) oh shoot reminds need Truth! Man, sounds really hard. Ive often thought rough sleepers meant do. 

I know hard, know lockdown affected different people different ways. want sit back happy results we've achieved. Whether agree cost lockdown not, youve gotta amazed we've done. 

Thats gets through. Washington state done pretty good job overall. Here's case/death state 31.25 deaths per 100k population. ranks 36th US terms per capita Dude start social distancing something...how allow exposed two times smh can‚Äôt serious. one hell headline lot people sub advocating herd immunity threshold 20% places like Arizona NYC already hit it. seem take account changes human behavior. Surprisingly many non-essential businesses allowed stay open. humidity factor spread virus? agree OP here. Constant 100% distancing imposes nearly draconian measures. It‚Äôs really smart circumstances hand individual. interacting high risk people, sure. they‚Äôre around people every day one high risk, overall risk goes restrictions go away. Lol job everything back normal like pandemic never even existed Alright. didn‚Äôt (and don‚Äôt too) answered questions.

I read Spanish flu second wave way deadly first one.

So knows terrible stuff laying ahead us.

Apparently first wave Spanish flu much seasonal flu second one could kill young healthy person within 24 hours infection.

Not fun. people's* Think relevant analogies want try shit lol embarrassing ""Jumped by"" means added cases. Earlier number + 8,500 new cases.

""Jumped to"" means number cases now. 

""Jumped to"" better choice words. Ugh. true. I'm really going enjoy time. think know word ""edgy"" means. Here's latest case/death charts Mississippi, running 7-day looking really bad. They're currently 106.16 deaths per 100k population. ranks 7th US terms per capita looks like they'll get #6 position pretty soon (look Rhode Island). right. can't legally force anyone wear mask put country state emergency IT. 

but people seem understand best. like think governmant forces wear mask, masks work. virus give fuck mandatory wear mask not. anyone half brain wear mask to, knows should. mind getting rid stupid people, problem putting putting themself danger, put danger everyone get contact THAT'S what's pissing off. freedom ends actions violate people. 99% great. 

That's vaccines are. I'm worried getting measles pertussis mumps. 

(I'm religious believe ""fate"" understand concept.) Oh god cannibalism save lives lmaoooo Yep. also people start feeling sick, denial, don‚Äôt get tested, That‚Äôs people comprehending. He‚Äôs implied less stringent measures. Actually pandemic World war II that's killed mil fact Spanish flu asain flu, Hong Kong flu, aids/hiv covid-19. trust least within 100 years deadly ones recorded. them. cannabalistic culture too, like them? Man, 3k cheap! SoCal small commercial hvac $10k I'm overly familiar immunology, I've gotten impression antibodies peak weeks gradually dwindle. getting negative antibody result, depending timing, necessarily surprising. caveat body immune cells (I believe memory t-cells?) *produce* antibodies later date virus shows again. think grants immunity way think it, think system makes reinfection less likely significant initial infection. 

Just incomplete understanding, welcome anyone correct fill gaps. daughter works children we're fine. ONE bar go quick dine drink uses thermometer door SD there's need contact tracing I'm ovwr map. We're central Arkansas Little Rock. Mask ordinance effect. *per OSHA, big difference Holy crap bro. I‚Äôm lonely hell life feels stagnant can‚Äôt move away home right now.

Thier argument? 'Well sick, there's nothing saying going die way!' point anything saying going die first place so, COVID certainly help. Imagine, GOD FORBID, natural disaster mass accident situation hospitals full health care providers swamped. Ugh. I'm overly familiar immunology, I've gotten impression antibodies peak weeks gradually dwindle. getting negative antibody result, depending timing, necessarily surprising. caveat body immune cells (I believe memory t-cells?) *produce* antibodies later date virus shows again. think grants immunity way think it, think system makes reinfection less likely significant initial infection. 

Just incomplete understanding, welcome anyone correct fill gaps. don‚Äôt think would cruised back White House, definitely would much closer election now.  him, lot HOP senators. hope realizes it. Here's latest case/death charts Orange county, running 7-day county currently 44.40 deaths per 100k. US average per capita death rate stands 66.19. Oops sorry that's meant. Fixed. hospitals, yeah workplaces can't work home. Absolutely. mean Putin funds NRA, turn funds McConnell GOP. choice appointments - like Elaine Cho Transp. Oh see. guess discuss too. going party bridge? poland stronk looked Emirates flights Dubai Hong Kong June 16 July 5. found quite telling. three weeks, Emirates five flights seven infected passengers flight, total 58 coronavirus-positive passengers flying eight-hour trips. yet, nobody else planes ‚Äî none 1,500 2,000 passengers ‚Äî picked virus, Freedman colleague *Journal Travel Medicine.*  flights higher risk, yet transmission,"" Freedman says.  another Emirates flight, whopping 27 coronavirus-positive people boarded plane Dubai.

However, lots people commenting saying things like CA still completely locked can‚Äôt really leave house, Newsom tyrant, etc. things really? Everyone dies eventually. probably virus. Yeah, thinking colds winter I‚Äôm dealing them, getting them. Slight silver lining, guess, cold infection rate presumably plummets year. update official statistics Tuesday-Friday press conferences/briefings Tuesday/Thursdays :) Yep. That‚Äôs we‚Äôre trying do. Avoid possible exposures, limit actual exposure it‚Äôs possible avoid it. Elimination goal, keep R0 low enough save lives. Reinfection demonstrated multiple cases, believed rare. 

Reports examining widespread reinfection strike alarming. Would say investigation larger scale cases post-infection immunity lasting months deserve headline-level attention discussion? Here's latest case/death charts Colorado, running 7-day case spike look good. Although overall Colorado still ahead game, 38.72 deaths per 100k population. ranks 32nd per capita death toll literally like 2.8% people using fear mongering tactic hide what's happening politically. can't believe realized, year, nasty cold probably spread around office every year, may contained wear freaking mask.... continue wear mask every little *tingle* even protect around me, always wear one public transportation, hospitals, etc on. easy infection control solution, everything course somethings! They're already giving hints preparing public.


They lied, again. give away freedom, getting back without fight. 

Hence white old man suits call 'the new normal'. seeing friends, living inside computer screen, supposed 'normal' now.

Well dead body. vaccine atleast prevent infections 50/70%. get it, get much less sick without vaccine.

But that's enough, nobody die government cares much people's health(still yet ban sort fatty foods, alcohol, cigarattes etc, thousands die cancer, heart disease etc) no, deaths dont matter, COVID death though... bum cough yelling store wearing mask.

keep mind judge ruled can‚Äôt refuse service non mask wearing customers...  tons articles mentioning antibodies lasting long, failing mention things like memory cells. Hell, look title. It‚Äôs click-bait. like 100 articles saying thing since April. well, sit reread sentence simply state 'they falling like flies'. quite text tightly connected rest comment message tried leave.

so, since commenting parts message instead whole context, figured i'm expected answer way. I'm pretty sure getting bored ""not letting dominate life"" make go away. probably change next 1-2 weeks. can't keep 10+k cases day 30-50 deaths day long. indoor areas still require masks, even vaccine distribution. Concerts also held, reduced capacity audiences wearing masks. leaders taking ""he's get rise you, ignore he'll stop"" approach three. Mask, SD, crowds. Yeah, Halloween definitely big here. drama queen. put three causes consequences death death certificate Illinois would Tough choice. know anyone likes way distance learning unfolding FCPS again, talking particularly low positivity rate either. seriously concidering getting pepper spray using anyone wear mask correctly, balls actually it. Meta-analysis: www.hcqmeta.com

Study list : www.c19study.com 

Twitter : positive results wrong : 1 20 million (p = early treatment studies report positive effect, estimated reduction 63%, RR=0.37. bias towards publishing negative results. Significantly retrospective studies report negative results compared prospective studies, p = studies North America report negative results compared rest world, p = 0.005. Masks important two. Wear mask, social distance, stay crowds unmasked people. three together. Uh huh, know how? 


Covid testing screening (especially long term effects) still infancy. already enough actual, scientific evidence suggest even Covid make immediately sick, fuck ways long term situations. Again, Cardiovascular damage, prolongued lung tissue damage, brain fog, neurological disorders linked post-covid phenomena. 


Also, uncle sample size one. Scientists using 'slightly' bigger sample sizes multi-millions, sourced internationally. anecdotal (and statistically lucky) example uncle getting fucked Covid means little, logically speaking. confusing immediate surroundings reality world large. 


And reason call Donald Trump fighter reason call Kanye West Genius. Mental illness immensely destructive, that's equated 'fighter'. Here's 1-minute video shows COVID spreading across US terms per capita deaths. DearLeader water wet ? point matter wear one arse ü§£ sound research  stance back February/March. got house last year, always wanted fully stocked pantry. took upcoming pandemic opportunity stock shit out.

Spent around $300 canned goods, non-perishables, etc. huge help summer, huge stock random foods really nice around. also able keep treats kids around, boxed goods, canned fruit, etc. It‚Äôs fear mongering. Antibodies first line defense reinfection. memory cells probably help recover faster get infected, don‚Äôt react quickly enough stop getting infected entirely. Cases creeping last two weeks already worrisome baseline. yeah, ""soaring"" seems like bit hyperbole. want soaring, look Colorado (and others). Still, talking exponential growth, sustained increases bad sign, TX falls category. thought mutations across different strains yet materially change part virus targeted current vaccines. think concerned there's evidence known mutation circulation would impact effectiveness. lol mean waste? shit next year wont option. Gee could keep level low right now... Many conspiracy theories end goal lowering world population. virus generally hurt healthy people. takes 10 years already marching towards grave. long run could financially beneficial take many Medicare, social security, healthcare. I‚Äôm saying believe, benefiting Yep, thing first heard stories this. guess would say bs pretty rare happens people share story everyone know. 1M tests per day guaranteed result mistakes. America everything open get corona activities Thats good. love smoking That's conservative estimate. through, 100+ million possibility, awful thing vast majority entirely preventable‚Äî function economic system rather virus.

To start, excess death count (above 300K) suggests count deaths attributed COVID‚Äì19 70‚Äì75% true number. Furthermore, also counted‚Äî enough information, since disease existed less year‚Äî loss life expectancy induced health problems acquired survivors. example, someone who's 25 gets sick (e.g., ventilator) might 2x relative risk all-cause mortality rest life‚Äî equivalent 9-year loss life expectancy. 

Finally, needless, there's economic damage, associated mental health burden. 0.01% insisted keeping around brutal, outdated economic system people can't work eat. People going hungry, people getting evicted, experiences long term damage. Children families face eviction alarmingly high rate schizophrenia later life, SZ diagnosis 15-year hit life expectancy first-world countries 25‚Äì30 year hit US (because nonexistent safety net, employers pretty much whatever want discrimination-wise). 5-year-old kid whose family evicted today significantly higher risk MH problems entire life‚Äî means we'll suffering after-effects thing century.

You're also going see post-ARDS sequelae (mental physical) well random post-viral fatigue that, untreated, turn anxiety depression. going go unmarked it'll pop people mild symptoms, people even know COVID panic attack work get fired it. Even mental illnesses considered mild comparison to, say, schizophrenia bipolar I, going cost 10‚Äì15+ years life expectancy U.S. because, again, workers rights discrimination employment real thing.

The economic mental-health fallout going comprise bulk lost life-years, opinion. always highly contagious viruses around us 1 Billion people Western society Lockdown 2 weeks. That's 2 billion weeks worth life lost == ~ 40.000.000 years life lost. Enlighten me, number bigger? less.
But sure someone tell tourism bars restaurants. Schools magically immune. First flatten curve...then wait vaccine...then wait vaccine...

These people enough turn anyone anti-masker gonna cry Salons, spas, barbers, tattoo shops, yoga studios, gyms etc... lots places list would pretty up-close interactions, seems wise! see health issues affect Covid mortality, look high blood pressure increase risk 9%, BMI 30-35 increase risk 23%, etc. invite audit class teaching Darwinism. think sad reality is, think experts want say it, going next impossible ever eradicate COVID. likely going go endemic treat like yearly flu instead full-on pandemic.

EDIT: kinda goes messaging issue think pretty prevalent U.S. especially around first lockdown. Back much messaging lockdown strangle COVID would back normal, instead lockdowns getting control. 

Right now, think serious messaging issue certain experts saying goal vaccines eliminate COVID reality really fucking hard that, really hoping drive endemic. point, think leaders need start honest really reality facing people prepare live fact going even vaccine point learn live Opinions change. Fauci probably basing opinions people actually following guidelines common sense. 14.27 single cases.
8.5 total tests.

So proper value 14.27 swabs follow swabs existing cases.

If make comparison based worldometer sources usually always get total, case reference 8.5. several biomarkers indicate naturally occurring. behavior WIV staff CCP following outbreak also highly suspicious. 

Contrary media narrative, evidence lab origin debunked. Ideally need distribute ill patients need ICU. way could utilise available beds better. moment think around 12.5 ICU beds per 100,000, might outdated figure given added capacity spring. Good roaming contagious fart clouds understand science. journalist culture travel she‚Äôs badly affected this. Probably also influencer sort cesspool social media.
Her whole flawed shallow basis living shut like said, doesnt think others. deranged ones ones going business everything normal highly contagious virus around us. Correct. Thanks. Editing clarity. ? reminds RBJ's dissent civil right case years back. Paraphrasing here:

Just umbrella protected rain, mean dry rain. buy this. articles coming kids, specifically students actually really good mask wearing habits. Actually better parents lol. pictures beginning school year kids shoved together without masks doesnt speak whole country. think current surge isn‚Äôt really related schools opening, colder weather coming in, among outdoor socialization move indoors. I've saying variant keep getting downvoted. going one extreme another immediately, going slow varied transition, especially dependent region population factors. Ain't gonna see cat that! 

Good doggo :) think mean ICU hospitalizations lag confirmed cases increase. reports lag website far know. Thoughts prayers lol. family tested positive.  

We always wear masks, wash often, social distance. Wash groceries mail bringing house. can't think anyone know (personally) do.

What disappointed found 7 months, doctor sends home says ....""good luck, gets worse, go hospital, tell COVID-19 positive wait car"". 

All BS hear TV therapeutics... say good luck. (Unless president course) totally zero, close it. typically enough virus ""leftover air"" infectious dose. vast majority cases happened two people talking/breathing near other, even then, takes 10 minutes risk infection become significant. super-spreader case studies, people spent minutes presence highly infectious person get infected. too. option mentioned best. outbreak schools here... traced high school socializing new annoying phrase sub:

""tHiRd wAVe cOmINg?! LoL nEvEr gOT fiRSt oNE!!!1!"" It‚Äôs tall memorial Might be?

Out top 25 highest numbers cases per day, 1 occurred May, 17 occurred June, 7 occurred October. October 16 saw 13th highest number cases reported single day.

The last week seen highest single-day totals, saying second wave ""might be"" happening?

There ""might"" it. numbers clearly show ""second wave"" began early September.  I‚Äôm saying need lockdown again, people need continue use preventative measures remain open. point I‚Äôm trying make handful cases worthy taking action, multitude cases means actions even important. aged Come /r/Collapse similar district's response scientific study. Study said every math class taken algebra 2 (junior level course) would increase educational outcomes college. 

So moved algebra 2 course sophomore level placed geometry course junior level. ""technically"" taking math classes algebra 2... 

Analysis scientific reasoning important, programs prepare administration actually teach it. Sadly, yeah... work public see every day. then, even lockdown issued, lots folks denial due quick life change. old problem people accepting changes easily... even provided valid reasons. It. Is. Not. About. Dying. From. COVID.

You *die* brink death require hospitalization consume hospital resources. believe not, even covid hospitalized. overrun hospitals people *will die* various reasons, covid otherwise.

For example, recent RV accident area resulted *15* people placed ICU local hospital, severely limited ability take care critical covid cases.

People fucking obsessed ""not dying"" covid realize many factors affect hospital capacity, runs 80-85% normal operations. talk people hospital daily breaking heart. listing numbers wednesday.
Where get ‚Äûactual numbers‚Äú from. Every source see lists numbers way below!

Just link source 15199. Today contact tracing meeting, team lead discussed people becoming reinfected county. asked might multiple strains virus. said possible mutating. asked CDC put guidelines yet said likely soon gathers data we're observing. 

I feel demoralized going hard effective vaccine world's economies deal going keep changing. hope get medical treatments soon well vaccine. noise Mount Stupid. keep forgetting young everyone else is. probably keep references things century people think I'm ignoranamous. quite usual, yes , schools open. lower than..the world morons like get IFR rise hard health care system overwhelmed lots collateral damages people diseases illness can't treated right anymore. LOT people die let virus burn even pandemic stop, reinfections point direction. Right. thinking good federal response this, could've easily 2nd term. Whether would've ultimately good thing long-term debate. Handling crisis well always absolve one misdeeds done prior. probably would've thing going election 'See? stopped COVID-19! alone reason vote us.' 2020 somehow feels like 1320 put things perspective peak first wave 4000+ ICU 1300+ lombardy only. time spread diffuse total number ICU beds available more.

Of course situation alarming sharp increase. addition areas ICU beds per 100k expecially southern regions capacity might reached quickly even global number would well 4000. problem transferring ICU patients joke ability redistribute patients areas (that also happened lockdown) limited. related note, really normalising online delivery.

Not pandemic, cheaper, environmentally friendly, better traffic, etc.

Obviously tech illiterate can't get rid is, nice walking aisles is, eventually it'd phase entirely reopen lot wasted land (would still need store food loading facilities ofc) So, apparently HFR dropped 3-fold course pandemic U.S. Good mean lockdowns worked delaying infections saving people would died they'd gotten sick earlier pandemic? Sweden, government actually shit. They're good tracking testing. I've heard podcast. We're shit it. Probably worst Europe. option point. about..if don‚Äôt want teach person...they quit? written perspective person believes right front nose. understand exponential growth, understand impact lasting symptoms, understand importance slowing virus become endemic. Ignorance, enlightenment, drives opinions. really depends widespread disease is. respect virus, get 35% population protected (as optimistic example above) really doesn‚Äôt make material difference level infections virus still easily transmitted far beyond hospital system capacity handle. 

The virus goes away stop spreading enough outbreaks betrayed isolated. We‚Äôre way beyond right now, couldn‚Äôt even get lull summer. Maybe next summer. I'm starting agree. coronavirus rest fauna trying kill you... Let's say police hard time back then. Generally, allowed exercise open walk dog, demonstrate for.
If caught far home dog, assumed trying smartest guy they'd fined you.

There also cross-regional restrictions, basically every region treated ""state"" cross borders unless work.

What mainly referring fact even many businesses allowed stay open, even people argued ""essential"" others (you imagine subsequent debate whether something essential not... really hard decide tbh) cost locking yet unknown. already see unemployment rising. Lmao bro post something like every day. Jesus Christ - get it, can‚Äôt keep living like this. Think something new comment, goddamn. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* He's getting people killed currently possible make virus scratch. Edit existing virus? Sure. would pretty obvious, widely tested debunked. There's absolutely evidence even released WIV let alone modified there, abundant evidence evolved naturally. thought number 18,maybe misheard link study article? call bullshit. Study study ""X sniffing dogs"" course decades proven pop culture belief dogs sort magic smelling creatures reliably give accurate results completely false. looking things like drug sniffing dogs constantly give false positives, almost training necessary smell something involve rewarding getting positives they'll respond handler cues things like receive positive feedback. densely populated state

That's key. WA basically rural states run democratic representatives, ironic cons whine much cash trust checks bank enjoy lack WA income tax. 

CA heavily populated several massive metropolitan areas. almost 4x population OR/WA combined, twice land area two combined. exactly I‚Äôve seen. hoping info deal could happening. it‚Äôs Bs testing March/April developed today (from June) ‚Äúwave‚Äù seeing would look like small ripple, wave. 

I‚Äôm playing seriousness current trend here. trend continues ICU cases deaths become similar April numbers, it‚Äôs second wave. right now, hight curve way near April numbers. 

Even ICU cases 1-2 week time lag compared confirmed cases, ICU data trusted start pandemic: Listen: op said ""By tomorrow (Monday) 15k cases.

And said No, that's unlikely be:

Monday: 10500 / Actual Number: 9335

Tuesday 11500 / Actual Number : 10874

Wednesday 14-15k / Actual Number: 15199

Yes overestimate bit Monday Tuesday underestimate well Wednesday.

But think got weekly trend right. 
My source newspaper TV news since live there. Shit, cumulative number far South Korea. Yet, people work still show without mask on, claim it‚Äôs medical reasons. reason Wisconsin going bonkers virus. funny say I'm seriously asking people generally still think rofl. 

Thanks info. wonderful day. I'd imagine would use poor Uighurs concentration camps COVID tests. colour maroon ever done you? ‚ÄúDissenters‚Äù, people ignoring science gotten tens thousands additional Americans killed unnecessarily? Yeah, 100% support murder charges people measurably objectively gotten thousands killed. can't tell example ""telephone"" actually happening should. told several people know well trust ""friend/cousin/co-worker/etc"" received positive test leaving wait long. Suspiciously, yet hear firsthand account. local news stories city happening seems thing would assume still pretty rare. 13 million people employed restaurant industry United States restaurant sales nearly $900 billion. joking, right? Recreational entertainment like bars, restaurants, venues huge portion economy. Air refreshed every 6 minutes plane. That's stage three testing about. Someone bunch medical degrees going decide binary 80% better 75% also improves outcome 15% whatever 1/5 good enough odds me! Holy shit, parents keep making mistakes like this, especially Dad who's 70's. 

I hear salesman downstairs dad inquired getting solar panels recently, moment heard instantly I'm thinking ""I bet go downstairs Dad forgotten worn mask guy wearing one he'll forget tell wear one."" Well, go downstairs wearing masks they're talking away happy be. FFS man, instantly asked put mask (which says forgot car) borderline scolded dad forgetting. 

Then days ago Dad rented bounce house little brothers birthday hear Dad talking outside, thought popped head, look window there's Dad talking laughing 3 helpers setting up, without masks. 

It's frustrating he's forgetful, needs engrained mind FUCKING EASY GET. Personally, enjoy ""we see increases cases schools reopened"".

You three cohorts school 500 kids, opt return person. go school half day MT ThF two weeks off. repeat.

I SHOCKED school ""reopening"" caused spikes. Eyeroll Assume vaccine 70% effective manage get 50% Americans (the highest coverage expect flu vaccine every year despite polls showing 60% Americans won‚Äôt immediately get vaccine available). leaves 35% population protected + 1% people naturally infected. That‚Äôs enough get us herd immunity even social distancing mask wearing remains steady unlikely. 

This virus going us summer next year least. Amazon extended WFH June 2021. Corporate action telling opinion pieces publications. don‚Äôt make decisions based emotional speculation, they‚Äôre modeling infection respect business. need snort cocaine butt literally written op, today 177k Go work hospital ward overnight. Let's see make morning. 177k swabs vs 26k. Tell 220 thousand dead Americans It‚Äôs great deal use people running hospital.. That's vaccine's work. might last months. enough people take within efficacy window going away anytime soon. could asymptomatic test positive, wait two weeks quarantine, experience symptoms several weeks months line Guts one word Well, reading twitter comments sure mistake helps, low vit &amp; zinc help think one entail other, despite multiple instances evidence entire world over, dense, punctilious fool.

Of course lockdown, look ""new"" concept ""Circuit Breakers"", new label they're going give random continued lockdowns irresponsibly reductive. Probably half population still acts like virus democratic plot that's worse sniffles. Every store go signs saying must wear mask enter, half people inside masks.


One large event state away obviously help, acting like that's surge coming uninformed. 

Things going get worse snow ground cold out. Hopefully people start taking seriously hits us hard, likely late then. clinical testing logic perspective, man right. Testing.
The UK around 10 times daily tests compared peak April (300k vs 30k)
I believe case every country that's experiencing new daily records right now.
There probably millions undiagnosed cases first wave. Sensationalist headline anyone? scared yet? Mate, problem getting out, getting back. long leaving 3-months more, apply exemption head off. got hard yards 14-days hotel get back (and luck draw), flights back seriously expensive. No, describing challenged trials. give vaccine deliberately infect patient. never used really. Although there's increase support challenge trials what's happening moment.  Thanks correction. Yes I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs likely people drove major cities ND attend demonstrations, waaaay likely locals met people country nearby Sturgis Deadwood, people worked bars retail three weeks went back home ND. mean, regional transmission? That‚Äôs crazy talk! one cares science... freedom. Silly stuff... realise American? first lockdown massively underselling economic pain caused. second lockdown simply viable. People kill act unpredictable ways even ones comfy jobs careers sick tired another lockdown mentally. Holy absolute shit that's insane. guess makes sense since they'd tracking much closely non-trial participants... Pussying around make lockdown needed longer deeper.

thats wrong, always takes amount time virus ""vanish"" per person.

It doesnt really matter 100K people it, 1 Million, everyone stays home.

It would take slightly longer 1 Million due spreading people allowed buy food, thats it.

locking early cause damage, since need 2021.

Here prediction: Lockdown christmas/new year, plenty holidays anyway, school, stores closed, damage kept ""in check"".

25th, 26th December Holidays anyway, 27th Sunday, everything closed. 28th - 30th, half 31st, January 1st Holiday again. school entire timeframe etc.

If another full lockdown, try put there. don‚Äôt know anyone thought indoor restaurants could done safely first place :/ Ding ding ding ding. second wave simple virology. Without eradicating virus face earth, going inevitable. Except science one vaccinated participant died would start dropping like flies.

Please take tinfoil hat. You‚Äôre feeding disinformation you‚Äôre worried about. question, ""stop"" trial administered vaccine? get maybe injecting anyone new already got shot, kind it? lockdown, one like before. government know, probably one , find balance limit flare ups without causing irreparable damage either economy covid collapsed completely yet cases ambulances driving 4 hospitals first 3 refused take patient due lack available hospital beds. said would surprised Bergamo situation 1-2 weeks. reached severity March/April. Look deaths graph confirm. Economics-wise makes sense. need find sweet spot two extremes.

As said comments, know people various levels state federal governments campaigns. see lockdowns happening, least state. That's exactly shutdown horrid economy, q3 US sees cases peaking country expect see 31-35% gdp recovery vs nationwide shut q2, due crazy states like california still realize mistake continue shut down. That's also quarter GDP full year gdp US expected decrease roughly many european countries, that's without taking account many european countries going second shut yet US shut Q4 sure, biggest risk joe hiden forcing people hide home reason win election, cause huge issues economy. Also Americans buying BMW great thing, would Americans buying German cars good thing? mean, imagine they're still expecting volunteers wear masks follow standard COVID procedures. person decided disregard doctors telling go normal business virus could still harm decided act like god amongst men he's really really stupid.

That kind brings issue that's gonna happen vaccine found people inoculated. absolutely guarantee there's gonna massive surge(possibly biggest?) cases due idiots knowing vaccines work start going crowded locations like pubs nightclubs can't get anymore. really idea exponential growth works. Probably less today, would much less older people society - many African countries hardly affected, influenza kills way people (for example Ethiopia - 1350 deaths covid far, flu 2018 66000 people) cool, thanks.  global scale, white people dying disproportionately. virus problem Africa. covid important TB malaria think pessimistic wait least somewhere middle next week see results recent lockdown measures still wear mask getting vaccine.

No, not. Quite European countries more. Israel too. Yeah, I'm risking getting sick injecting something ~65% effective, considering I've gotten flu life. responsibility put health mine. passing infection chain stops!  huge problem detect super-spreading individuals need regular mass testing, like college campus NBA bubble. Even hospitals regularly test healthcare staff direct contact covid patients. agree 100%. certain point need move post vaccination point Fogettaboutit Yeah everything China fake. mobile. mask. Yunnan tea. Propofol ICU. They're exceptions prove rule, actually. placebo fake, vaccine. really depends neighborhood.

If got big, walkable neighborhood houses close together houses Trick Treat, becomes destination get *lot* kids. neighborhoods take another notch organize block party / street festival. 

So places US get close movie stuff, typical. Nope. nearly many infections first wave.

It's estimated 100k 200k infected every 24 hours last days lockdown March. antibody studies generally came figures suggesting 4-5 million infected course first wave, suspect real number might even higher people lose antibodies quite quickly. 30% GDP US wrong, count differently rest world.

And PRCs 5,2%... yeah... doubt that, given didnt move stuff weeks ports. China back normal. think happen vaccine 100% effective. Even 75% effective problems huge population. gonna happen open borders? gonna lockdown forever? Also, Italian journalist China hospital Covid. passed two-week quarantine contracted virus within China. Either late incubation still community spread there. answered what? There's practically nothing new there... sick stay home, wear mask, etc. think severe bias really clouding view mundane things. seems like handy guide travelers people begin venture again.

From article last updated August, ""CDC recommends people wear masks public settings, like public mass transportation...""

You get infected get enough virus particles mucus membranes. Virus particles decrease distance sick person, intake essentially going constant time interaction.

So 6 feet away less (half? quarter?) particles versus 3 feet. 3 minutes interaction 20% particles versus 15 minutes. neither guarantees get enough particles.

I'll honest though. feels like trolling me. science says chance infection decreases distance increases time. cutoff 6 feet 15 minutes completely random probably based find convenient. Unfortunately That's exactly point trials, see die vaccine not. want it. even work. soon open virus would back. Italy: learned it. Let's lovkdown.

And allow cuddling combat loneliness. Even old person covid. Prison studies meaningless disease spread general population. 

Here one back :

*""As May 22, 92 percent prisoners tested Parnall positive antibodies, according Chris Gautz, spokesman Michigan Department Corrections. department offered antibody blood tests prisoners Parnall two weeks ago. 1,248 people tested, Gautz said 1,148 positive.""*

All PPE help living working environment. better trial ignored safety precautions? careful, researchers know vaccine works not. Es ist es ist you.... every state differ portion population they're willing sacrifice disease. (like California) cautious, affecting ppl color much whites, Golden State majority minority state. Others feel candidates vaccination expendable greater good. bioethical moral choice region make. getting phases confused? don‚Äôt usually use placebo phase I. phase III would use placebo compare standard care. Since there‚Äôs existing vaccine you‚Äôd use placebo. Saying something statistically low risk denying dangers?

Covid deadly. unlikely happen vast majority people. 

Here's example:

There's also low risk asteroid hitting earth.

That mean asteroid hitting earth dangerous. means focusing dangers 24/7 detriment everything else destroy society.

Its ridiculous risk low practically every person. Welcome media. think care? shock value, views. Look new York new Jersey March April. People sent home hospitals full dying home Israel 9000 one day 324k adjusted US population PRC? believe anything PRC bridge Brooklyn sell you. Also, closed borders two weeks mandatory quarantine anyone entering country. sustainable. Even virus subsided return. claims impossible. Also, New Zealand reported new case community transmission last week. done excellent job situation unique. tiny country middle pacific. challenge populous country middle Europe open borders.  yep.. According definition, NYC stage 1.5 squash virus I'd say we're currently 3.5 so.

It's ideal economically cases deaths seem ""sustainable"" level limp along.

Can 2 years ? No, likely.. keep another 6-9 months, abso-friggin-lutely, especially manage get people businesses support need. Phase III Moderna here. Trump Boris..... even begin  Certainly triggered fuck about? wear proper PPE every time.

Which awesome, selfishness still wholly missing point. Maybe rather trying come neat insults me, trying decipher age could simply understand point..But shit carry now, learning experience that

And clearly changed much reason years now... please, call everyone else pansies wanting spread disease (there's hint I'm ""on about"") making bunch dumbass assumptions

Which assumptions make? scared something statistically less likely spreading communicable, respiratory virus? (Look, there's hint two!) think get point across clearly. saying absolutely true doubt politicians campaign teams priorities set something else. 

What I'm trying say is, number people dying/being hospitalized determines lock lock down. December rolls around daily reported cases like 50, nothing much going happen. next week reported cases jump 50000 per day upwards trend, something going happen. can't say lock certain.

Youu manipulate numbers certain degree, testing people obviously number reported cases stay low. ICU beds begin run low, hospitals run, larger normal number people dying, believe social media news cycle pick something even massive testing.

Now I'm scientist, I'm saying based things I've read information I've picked talking people, work medical field. obviously could wrong, believe there's general consensus there's possible big outbreak near future. 

So big if. outbreak foresee come, there's point lock obviously one. another massive outbreak hits, people notice government forced something.

When said implied political issue, meant sounded like saying politicians gets decide outbreak happens. misunderstood you, sorry. Dude one crying people laughing ain't nobody feelings u obvious frustration showing. :p live South, bogeyman waiting steal ballot vote person. get massive countrywide shutdowns, maybe still goddamn problem virus. half-assed, uncoordinated series shutdowns good portion US states. know straw man argument :p Climate change destroy planet. Infact even nukes world destroy planet rn. Climate change tough deal humans adapt thousands years thing could possibly make us extinct asteroid event similar dinosaurs, solar flares humanity mines uranium world make nukes destroy ourselves. Even still planet live that. Deaths spiked majorly Europe. EU consistently 150 deaths day months. EU deaths 1100 yesterday. staying same, far otherwise.

Now France Spain significantly 150 daily ceiling EU saw months own, Czech, own, approaching number. 

There's nothing doubtful letting continue spread without mitigations April would let substantially surpass spread April. course mitigations going happen government handle current rate growth much longer.

Remember, guy saying Europe 4-5 times worse April. really important note he's saying this, he's referring hypothetical conditions *will happen*. really sad see.

Some extremists, go around mask face, cutout. 

They literally cut part mask covers mouth, making little window exposing mouth nose, wear like regular.

&amp;#x200B;

You can't fake shit, really happening people throwing away months months lockdown (and lockdown worked, touching zero cases july. went shit thought virus long gone) Straw man argument. federal reserve keeping stock market whole pandemic. need additionally pretend talking avoid market crashing lol. ""talks"" policy-driven legit. Oh, plans. scraped em fuck democrats cities. negativity, randomness, completely related said. Actually, close related possible 3rd surge, wave. bad comment

The negativity

The randomness

The nothing said means 3.5 years everyone tested. scale thing crazy. Stay healthy! anyone think like Flu anymore? dead horse fossil. true, adversity create determined minds. If, look current surge, happening every region US currently shows signs abating. next 3-4 months going terrible probably 5th surge Thanksgiving. Bad bot. Move China. #recordsaremeanttobebroken /s Yeah dummy, shit carry now, learning experience illustrating last point made previous comment selfishness.

The fuck about? wear proper PPE every time.

You making bunch dumbass assumptions, points 20. far entertaining things could doing, young lady. Reinfection rare =/= someone supporting herd immunity. Straw man argument If, look current surge, happening every region US currently shows signs abating. next 3-4 months going terrible probably 5th surge Thanksgiving. I‚Äôm age group well! According draft plan, yes. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs socialize more. 

Here something explains things better. isn‚Äôt exact thing read originally it‚Äôs Actually, know what, think I'm love must suburban thing. least cases bad here. went outdoor market man full well, I‚Äôd worried masks weren‚Äôt mandatory. obvious frustration herd immunity working. Hey bud, stopping tell also narcolepsy. developed 15 horrible bout Mono. lucky ones?

During last appointment, neurologist heaving conversation COVID-19 got subject potential long term complications. brought point quite possible may see surge auto-immune illnesses disorders due COVID, exact reason pointed out‚Äîthere tons studies strongly suggest onset Narcolepsy triggered immuno-response viral bacterial infection individuals ""right"" genetic code.

Also, jsyk, /r/Narcolepsy community super supportive welcoming ever need place talk! know. know usually there's deal countries phase 3 trials Chinese vaccines earn right produce vaccine domestically people event success, presumably UAE also make it, maybe even export surrounding countries region.

I say UAE Brazil said still expanding trial program 9,000 15,000, surely one would go longer. Brazil trialling Sinovac, UAE (plus countries, UAE furthest along) trialling Sinopharm.

Another reason think Sinopharm UAE money recently Bahrain also joined started phase 3 trial two Sinopharm vaccines, crown prince getting vaccinated. Perhaps royal family Bahrain popped next door UAE got inside scoop phase 3 trial progress judged they've seen enough convinced. Joining phase 3 late stage seems bit pointless testing perspective, mean Bahrain also becomes one countries earned right make Sinopharm vaccine success result announced. There's probably money made getting license.   Daily cases 100k, yet deaths stay same. far.

I'm saying anyone going measures. even 2x really doubtful. Idk got many downvotes, like comment lol. *bit* much, like  What's Hawaii's excuse? Bearded white guy drinking Make Apple Grape Aperitifs.  Also Questioning Querulous Quorum's. fuck. pleading instead law drawn up? bad comment

The negativity

The randomness

The nothing said

The obvious frustration said rare ridiculous comparison. Vietnam War killed (as far tell) somewhere 2 million 4 million people. American habit counting American deaths extremely parochial frankly getting nauseating. Counting American deaths Vietnam makes much sense counting Vietnamese COVID deaths US.

If want comparison American war deaths, use one war victims indeed American. It‚Äôs bad Madison.   There's also regular influenza type mingling bird flu H5N1. latter couple mutations away pandemic strain.

H5N1 60% CFR. That's really good question reminds cousins continue smoke cigarettes five years watching grandpa die slow, horrific death thanks COPD. still haunted memories hospice fought every single breath. text said sign petition volunteer.   [Black would win hands down. regions Europe killed 2/3 population less 10 years. general killed 40 50% entire population Europe 4 years. 4 years every second person die! that's Thanos shit. 

After took 200 years population levels restore back pre black death levels. Without black death might already 10 billion people planet. Travelling horse much faster compared walking considering C19 moves fast wonder may deadly. saying it‚Äôs fault, article uses many words say wants resting sites wants throw money states. Hardly much plan, states don‚Äôt need testing point teacher sick, teach? counterintuitive TL;DR: America needs normalcy

At point, it‚Äôs worth noting number Americans, like partner, paying close attention Europe. We‚Äôre already gearing tell family planning attending Christmas, Thanksgiving moot point since cases went area students came back (August). 

I personally baffled entitlement ignorance around me; pretend like partner seem pessimistic. 

Americans haven‚Äôt given damn other, much less anyone else, since Puritans landed. nice words ‚ÄúAll men created equal‚Äù written white, male, slavers. World Wars beating Russia Moon, Americans started fist-pumping great America was, thus era American Exceptionalism born, it, blind patriotism. Generations taught since great America is, we‚Äôre best country world. sing patriotic anthems without thinking, force children recite pledge fancy piece cloth, now, equate voting worst political threat US ever produced True American. Meanwhile, actually question publicly *if* still great (obvious no). 

The people see around tired, wearied, misguided, scared. want comfortable world back, trying force pretending everything fine isn‚Äôt. see world fire, losing traditions security comes routine, drown work, screens, substances, food, sufficiently numb reality: rest modern world light years ahead US education, social policy welfare, happiness, yes, COVID response. 

This Halloween goes on, Black Friday still madness, we‚Äôll see outbreaks Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years. 

This Florida mandated masks, sports fans pack stadiums given opportunity, US going lose people COVID Spanish Flu. 

Americans need normalcy get real uncomfortable without it. Many clients didn‚Äôt get tested one 99% inaccurate Driving puts others risk. I'm almost certain this. think I've seen person crash another. think that's works. 0 people currently hospitalized Franklin County, Ohio. population: 1.3 million. nobody talk knows anybody hospitalized. feels like blown proportion. disproportionally affects brown people, so, no, instead laughed went Trump rallies. Park refrigerated trucks right front hospital people see.

I lost relatives this. know heartbreaking is.

If loss shown daylight maybe couple people take seriously. Thank you. problem common cold there's huge load different viruses cause it, symptoms look same. can't build proper immunity (also there's selection pressure kill us). there's one covid19 causing virus, spike proteins changed far. looks like problem Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay. Check daily show YouTube 'may' inactivate coronaviruses. Presumably living surfaces mouthwash/rinse touches. 

What primary source Covid droplets/aerosol shed covid+ spreaders? droplets/aerosols coming mouth, throat/lungs? latter, effective MOUTHwash going inactivating spreaders covid?  Right. there‚Äôs better way win votes put folks‚Äô children‚Äôs health risk. 300,000

any questions? 1 death day 100 deaths per day less flu. That's unrealistic target US. Something like 50 deaths per day US would achievable would seen success. true. People trying make universal flu vaccine. problem flu mutates often. universal vaccine works provided protection strains. guess hope mutates right? Wishful thinking? Trying stay positive optimistic. That's plenty time, level infectiousness consistent show symptoms. infectious day symptoms. Add masks social distancing, maybe even vaccine, becomes daunting virus spread.

Not mention mutations keep occurring randomly. simply infectious mutations tend spread.

We 4 common coronaviruses. likely started similar one. matter weathering manage level really similar cold. We'll get there. Thats general consensus. wasn‚Äôt lockdown

Well guess tens millions unemployed, -33% GDP, 1 5 small businesses busted 'never coming back' magically appeared nothing guess honestly know interpret I've heard much contrary stuff. 
 
Just heard another interview expert said much differently ward compared beginning. still pneumonia treatment all. 

Maybe killing people highly affected areas March, I've heard statement Bergamo before. Lungs shredded. people avoided hospitals could still breathe somewhat. know came NYC Bergamo, often verge collapse needed intubated immediately. 

They knowledge today wonder drug discovered (e.g. look recent findings Remdesivir), certainly nothing pull mortality 25 7%. scientists believe. Look russia flu 1890. True. said antibiotics instead. 

Research autopsy reports 1918 pandemic showed 85-90% died succumbed secondary bacterial infections took advantage damage caused lungs initial infection.

Spanish Flu killed many people antibiotics available today.

Conversely, Covid 19 happened back then, would likely similar results due damage lungs well. country filled enough brainless, cold hearted shitheads would say, yeah, many would. started shipt shopper today cracking up! least I‚Äôm better guys pubs restaurants yet closed UK? position utter nonsense.

If infected person 1-2 meters / 3-6 feet away others, make damn difference is. droplets explode aircraft.

Let‚Äôs focus ‚Äúpatently false‚Äù part this.

If suppress certainly reduce deaths successful vaccine arrives.

But doesn‚Äôt happen many years?

What suppressing sense vaccine? It‚Äôs measurably objectively significantly dangerous driving car. None Japan though ü§î ü§î Whether done, don‚Äôt see done.  

Sad thing is, masks everyone limited indoor crowds lockdowns likely wouldn‚Äôt needed. elderly, co-morbid, poor immune systems still issues, undoubtedly severe, fatal.  

I still think inoculum key, besides person‚Äôs unique issues. would 1000s kids congregated porches collecting candy 1000 people even remotely safe pandemic?  limited view old means. People risk bed-ridden ancient Liches. Fifty sixty year olds, seventy eighty year olds risk, those, today, almost active you. unfortunate end nursing homes.

For example, sixty. write, illustrate, play video games, dive virtual reality, still time wife three life partners. also study make board games, paint miniatures construct scenery, play tabletop wargames. probably interesting exciting things young people.

But, sixty, puts risk young people think people like 'don't long live' reason live. novels write, online cartoons continue, countless games play. eager Playstation 5 Xbox Series X. easily another twenty thirty years left - want stolen punk party goddamn fucking global pandemic!

When write people age, shitting face. Fuck you. razor dicks. Fuck hell. living best years entire life sixty. 

You moronic, sociopathic shitpig. Fuck you! Ehhh... Okay. one hand 4-5 week shutdown reduce cases 90%. That's proven. However, also proven final 5-10% cases remaining much difficult eliminate. spend another 4-5 weeks shutdown attempting eliminate remaining community spread.

On hand, anti-shutdown folks also bad math. idea 2 months shutdown sounded like crazy talk, looking back, two months shutdown, followed opening gyms, schools, life general helluva lot better alternative we've chosen. 

In future, take lessons learned pandemic. Act fast keep pandemic getting country first place million times cheaper humane citizens. cases city state, isolate, contact trace, quarantine, shutdown area quickly. Combine fact we've become (or maybe along, never really tested?) extremely mentally weak fact we've become extremely stupid we've got here. Nah. Satire usually clever amusing. Treat post COVID-19 patients wear n95 everyday. till vaccine available I'm ditching mask good (except around active cases). reasoning flawed fuck though. Punishing people way denying healthcare services fucked. I‚Äôll take yes. Well then, even get reinfected, there's absolutely way prove it. Na definitely Melbourne, we've longest lockdown world Weird flex ok Wonder long haulers young children? yup  Cheaper buy something dollar menu McDonald's buying salad.

There's really realistic alternative move? numbers cases..duh Yeah didn‚Äôt make clear long standing treaty still applied. Either way thanks source. president North Dakota embarrassed Ok guy placebo arm gets sick might die, switch vaccine arm? That's flu testing big thing.  sick several times respiratory stuff, world famous medical center never tested flu.  fair, would they?  difference make?  time show up, late stuff like tamiflu. Africa, Europe Asia don‚Äôt even need boat, land routes.

You sure digging heels here. one uses boat navigate Nile River North Africa? Rhine River Germany? Yangtze? one uses ships cross Mediterranean, Black Sea, English Channel, Philippine Sea? barren bodies water nary ship sight?

Regardless, you‚Äôre looking talk trans-Atlantic trans-Pacific crossings, you‚Äôre still awfully misinformed long ocean journeys took hundred years ago.

In mid 1800s, evidence voyage New York Liverpool took around three weeks month. advent steam ships, amount time spent trans-Atlantic crossing even shorter. 1838, crossing would taken around 15 half days‚Äîby 1860s, time shortened eight days. early 20th century, journeys faster ever before. RMS Olympia made maiden voyage Southampton New York seven days. 1907, Mauretania able cross Atlantic 4.5 days.

The length journeys reasonably within time-frame incubation period (2-14 days) period infectiousness (10-20 days), according CDC. due respect, fucking moron. help critical part getting population level herd immunity make living virus manageable. won‚Äôt magic bullet lot people seem think is. Consider naturally, we‚Äôve ~1% country exposed virus. vaccine boost substantially won‚Äôt save us years-long effort necessary really get us ‚Äúherd immunity.‚Äù really want extent lockdown prc had? Gimme break. think said done, maybe third way this, people learn. farm, I'd bet drugged wazoo painkillers steroids sake public appearances. 

Once loses vacates White House, we'll find bad really was. think anyone advocating herd immunity first line voluntarily infected Covid.... receive absolutely health care. Thank sober thoughts tough topic. Dr. Yasmin best possible outcome country provide timeline looks like? Also, even viable vaccine probability enforcement local, state federal level needs enacted stop spread? Right, need severe COVID cases placebo arm, horrible sounds seems breathing stupid problem all, though. Yes, got vote again. Vote early person!  told 100% actually hyperventilating. 

And everything I've read people different baselines. Even older 75 years 6/7 hospitalized recover hospitalized. Hence coin flipping poor analogy, coin highly skewed land recovery side. think luck. nature coin, obviously fail comprehend. work local school district every while, pop school board meeting. Parks Rec essentially documentary. southern hemisphere pretty much flu season, think ok one year. TBF think anyone anti vaccine first place gonna read anyways Lockdown prevented collapse whole health system. think admitted people hospitals ran beds left die? massive misnomer comes correlations time.

We find sorts stuff people low vitamin likely ill, equally people infirm thus likely get ill also likely stay indoors think said ""those involved"" meant people conducting experiment, subjects.

But study, one else knows. patient, person administering vaccine, even people tracking results side effects. someone accidentally give away dose, would change behaviors ruin study. Well yeah.. 3 patients gotten transverse myelitis actual vaccine look good either. Dmmit. Mom? political? can‚Äôt wear mask? you‚Äôre fucking baby? Fucking seriously. first time ever wear mask, hated much. days could wear mask 12 hours straight problem. I've become totally accustomed it. 

But god DAMN still suck gym. damn hot mask I'm sweating even usual, making increasingly uncomfortable there. think also like worst possible facial attributes working mask too. full beard annoying make mask straight wet take drink water spill onto beard put mask back on. also wear glasses literally cannot see shit unless I'm deliberately inhaling de-fog briefly, even though workout masks specifically supposed help glasses fogging. cannot WAIT day lift without mask first time. Whatever say!!!! üòòüòòüòòüòòüòò  even best Dakota. know facebook groups flooded article, word placebo... Oh yeah ‚Äúunknown‚Äù. massages way now. Yeah, think grandparents 60s minds certainly fit lead country. still mostly got tired quick, slept lot, became forgetful. closed loophole that. Uh yeah. recommend eating test. Also question aimed people would know, people don‚Äôt know there‚Äôs even mouth test. Guess vaccine trumps placebo effect. Teachers unions saying teachers would rather classroom students impression.  would rather front camera deal maintaining order etc. thank young person ultimate sacrifice journey better mankind. Thank Rest Peace brave soul. hope didn‚Äôt intentionally get infected trial. talking about? Unless think people live average another 13 years deaths door, harvesting cause. shitty conspiracy theory ridiculous face value anyway point. 100 million people elevated risk across age groups 43K dead 65 U.S. taking people verge death. 6 months average immunity duration seem fairly incompatible fact Spring break almost 6 months ago. seeing whole lot reinfection disjoint reports (if immunity disappear ~50% Spring Covid19 patients).

Time napkin math: areas (London, Stockholm) 10-20% infection rates achieved Spring (as estimated serology studies), so, naively, one would expect immunity disappears 6 months 50% infected, ares would see 5-10% new infections reinfections... think case. 

A major statistical wrinkle this: (~90%+) Spring infections went undetected. many people would know (or would test) confirm fact Spring infection...So, reinfections-as-confirmed-by-positive-PCR-test (in Spring Fall) might low 0.5-1% even 6-month immunity duration... I've seen articles lots different EU nations setting peaks and/or establishing new restrictions. Poland, Czech Republic, Ireland immediately come mind. Oh 80-90% Parliament less poor politicians, much worse, plain poor No, got that. virus becomes risk health deteriorates. That's exactly astrophysics.

But massive, massive stretch think actually take place large scale (my distinction *possible* *common*). meantime, we're finding ways inhibit virus replicating, prevent associated disease becoming severe, immunize people virus. evidence: last 4-5 months, study showed we've seen ~70% drop hospitalized patient mortality across age groups. therapies improve vaccines become available, scenario described become rare, cases obscure.

In sense: yes, scenario described would concern nothing response virus. that's realistic assumption. Getting whiskey tango gathering *only* Covid considered victory. 

Sturgis makes Juggalo gathering seem like mensa meeting. use dogs bit different however. know people imagine walking airports sniffing everyone, pilot studies I‚Äôve read involve smelling saliva samples. Clinically, anything 98 considered problematic, told battled pneumonia. 

You might want explore breathing issues like asthma, there. Look South East Asia countries, Vietnam 2.5x population half cases Canada deaths. Europe Americas terribly containing it. countries regions simply terrible others. ""Locking people letting die alone"" aka providing care elderly people homes apartments longer suffices get moved elderly care building theh√§y require 24h contact careworker?

The elderly care Sweden strained, truly is. noone locked up. defense, think concerned people's feelings. Shut er doc! hurt Karen's feelings study need end ASAP! theory viral load increases severity virus. maybe got particulary high dose working least Italy, many ICU beds back then, ran quickly whole wards quickly reconverted covid wards. also enough ventilators. ICU beds now, ventilators, better knowledge treat virus, we're testing more. Back testing showed moderate severe symptoms, we're testing lot asymptomatics. One Oxford trials used meningitis vaccine, I'm sure one. reason trials use sterile salt water placebo sometimes volunteers figure got based lack arm soreness, redness injection site common vaccine side effects. think do. pretending ""if let people die, least economy remain viable"".

And that's case. one making 10% 20% margins losing customers big deal. million dead customers (or even fewer, likely), that's still economy spinning oblivion right there.

It would better delay business, able pick back afterward. afterward.

The good (morbid) news might job openings usual. Yup, corona virus little timer 15 minutes can‚Äôt infect Especially 100k deaths among ""old way"" nursing homes, like flu deaths, society look way. Exactly! Friends hug. Friends touch. handshake something meeting new acquaintances greeting formal setting. Please update us later die. He‚Äôll breathing oxygen ventilator keeps up. Sorry, mean turn partisan rantings divisive nonsense. seem recall certain elected official claiming head CDC idea timelines vaccines couple weeks ago. expected government‚Äôs mishandling virus downplaying healthcare system properly financed years north Dallas here... grocery stories. 

 However, restaurants PACKED. McKinney ISD bad, cases. Good you. case lot people. Replying comment, since found study prevalence restriction sites viruses. paper genetic engineering another coronavirus, TGEV. restriction sites mentioned smoking gun conspiracy paper EcoRI BstXI, former probably used restriction enzyme world quite rare. Normal BstXI requires difficult conditions operating, version available works standard conditions. Funnily another paper mention EcoRI (which surprising) also talk lengthly BstXI, practically unheard among gene jockeys. strange coincidence thought would share Meningitis vaccine debunked, sorry believe 4 symptoms requirement removed couple days ago also entirely untrue many businesses business owners would ruined shutdown.

You'll bring anything try score point, you?

Just curious since we're apparently going wildly topic, what's number ""too many people dying"" consider shutdown worthwhile? panic distrust sells 0.2 cent advertising click revenue... sensibility place monetized news system! 


edit: people already willing spout wild conspiracy theories stuff, covid brought paranoia distrust main stream recent months article titles agree peoples already tarnished views usually sell best... remember 10 years ago followed conspiracy videos used keep quiet KNEW made look absolutely crazy talk mainstream.. popular culture... Exactly. short, measuring effective something anything.

If participants know nothing, actually react differently, administer something soon know

Ideally, neither participants, giving drug, know whether real placebo wait social media shit storm either:

1. Someone dies even getting vaccine.
2. Somebody dies side effect vaccine.

People suck risk management social media makes matters worse. this. 

Russia, Turkey, Egypt three countries doubt purely intentional cover up. 

China Iran give credence idea don‚Äôt even know true number (especially Iran). Well could use Amazon Walmart one would go store. 
But thanks telling that, reveals perfectly fine putting someone else situation believe risk health. elitist you. 

What deaths? correlating cases? 
Ok can't Disneyland?

Wait earlier said going work risky lockdown agreed. 
So yourself? asymptomatic Covid date infection, get infected different virus, whether afterward concurrently, secondary infection might provoke overreaction immune system basically maims you. 

That, nutshell, happens children mild cases COVID, subsequently developed MIS-C. MIS-C causing heart problems kids unfortunate enough triggered new viral infection. change behavior some. others, carry usual. people area can‚Äôt even bothered put mask public. ok, although i'm bit disappointed someone stating want check sources. published doctors and/or researches branch. / could interesting, nvmd.

i admit example harsh one, that's best way depict happens people start thinking emotions trying reason way. 

article states want soften restrictions people 70 more. received vaccine already (Novavax' Phase II, one \~1600) received shots (not placebo, 5-arm trial thus already 80% chance getting vaccine first shot, second shot reaction it).

Anyway piece great read - custom packaging ensure -70C storage 10 days, plenty time get point need. 5K doses space pretty compact - 16x16x22. Also nice see Pfizer working independently OWS, inside outside logistics distribution going difficult.

On mask-wearing, still wear mask per local guidelines presume immune. Yea also didn‚Äôt know recently

Hint: also article, read United States traded land health care services sovereign, Native nations, federal officials spend nearly three times much per person non-Indian medical care health services Indigenous people. can‚Äôt wait next week  better. We're behind curve.  net \*migration\* 2017. offset migration allowing immigration high handful European states, mainly Romania/Bulgaria/Slovakia particularly Ukraine. It‚Äôs proven yet... compelling theory. 

OC43 name coronavirus question. Even today instances CV cause havoc particularly among elder people. 

What‚Äôs unique CV particular occasionally causes neurological issues. Russian flu documented cases neurological issues. 

Unfortunately yet find genetic material proves virus. journalist myself. try look sources suggested journalists started domino effect internal metoo accusations. trying circulate awareness possible involvement Uighur workers production chinese PPE, since mentioned much going metoo movement, seems keep lot people preoccupied. 

Thanks lot time involvement, remember #PledgetoPause Even taken placebo, died COVID, says vaccine 100% efficient, would need halt trial death wasn‚Äôt directly cause vaccine‚Äôs adverse effects(explore ADE?) ? Pfizer almost certainly first, seeing J&amp;J start good sign. One dose, huge company, easy logistics. kind vaccine get us herd immunity. Seasonal flu dangerous yearly vaccine completely effective due [antigenic feature coronaviridae.  


The reason 100% effective year fundamentally different effectiveness viral vaccine targets. know may seem pedantic, clinically scientifically different. Yes, tests performed declare brain death. patient declared brain dead, dead. Even support, patients organs begin fail brain death therefore time essence patient organ donor. Furthermore scenario think lot people worried get groceries delivered, avoid going store themselves, delivery person happens it. case groceries enclosed space infectious person 10+ minutes, almost immediately moved dark cool place. lul, think say all! Although adverse events leading death due FDA approved vaccines may vanishingly rare, certainly impossible. we're talking /u/pudding7 volunteering participate vaccine trial, seems like would carry least risk. 

 Thanks go /u/pudding7 putting benefit rest us! think could best way find vaccine sterilising immunity. Ah, well see calling causing distrust think would telling. one go store deliver Amazon order.....

There already listed 2 them..

When every say lmao? strawmanning argument. 
You admitted fine sending someone else believe risky situation. 

Yeah lockdown yourself. 

I never said make job work home job. strawman guess. 
I saying non essential workers right now, look new job. complain make excuses since fine non essential businesses like Disneyland forced shut down. found interesting. African Americans able get hospital mortality different #COVID19 Point- need able access healthcare woman covid-19 told asked people talked 15 minutes. Shorter interaction?

Since patient dead, behavior cannot influenced, unblinding done without throw result out.

Patients ability unblind time medical reasons (they might immune system reaction doctor needs know), do, removed study. Likely artefact accelerated trials. win lottery tomorrow? 

Listen, we've seen big increase cases eventually leads increase deaths. 

And time people keep denying happen. time. can‚Äôt tell don‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre purposefully creating straw man argument‚Äî scientists rely data. That‚Äôs it. model infection rates based population models like they‚Äôve done *the lancet* projects rely heavily assumptions large hard pin virus.

Your entire last comment strikes pretty bad faith. can‚Äôt recommend comment enough! really don‚Äôt know will/would happen is/was face mask recommendation. 

On one hand, might take time get rid awkwardness masking. hand, conformity social pressure might work it. 

Tegnell FHM since quite time hinted masks recommendations might come. Probably universal recommendation, settings (like public transportation) and/or flare regions. 

It become interesting indeed plays out. studies conducted determine relative threshold viral exposure elicit infection starting now. Phase 3 efficacy (and safety byproduct).  certainly placebo arm phase 3. means figure died go there. Settle down. I‚Äôm waiting November December headline hospitalizations reached highest levels ever. Try gramps. Wisconsin royally fucked already, haven‚Äôt even first snow state. Gonna dark winter... That‚Äôs actually fucked. Schools closed nationwide country positivity rate people, students, never even really got 1%.

We‚Äôve reached point need move get jobs back go back school. goes much longer many lives irreversibly damaged, lot already have.   reality media agencies know fear driven agenda makes money anyway, need prodding.

edit: nevermind, understand argument now.

I think community transmission go way vaccine though. placebo another vaccine (meningitis) Fuck condescending fake nice bullshit. attitude exactly people justify putting life danger wearing mask social distancing. ""They contagious time docked"" bad take. Black Plague came Europe 14th century merchant vessels arriving Italy carrying dead severely infected sailors. already said, evidenced multiple sources, trans-Atlantic voyages hundred years ago took much less month. course virus would spread like wildfire, highly likely passengers crew would still infectious end journey.

Not sure stubborn fun it, calling idiot thing suggesting anger issues see therapist. I'm sorry hear that. Probably also ones far less needing vaccine (short term) since likely already infected. No. would opposite. cannot make calls 50%. going recommend masks point, going hard get people use them. happened Finland Netherlands. Officials first skeptical masks eventually made recommendation people skeptical them. Tegnell shitting doorstep statements masks. maybe I'm wrong since Sweden probably Western country without mask recommendation people see what's happening elsewhere. Immediate family 3 including parents spent several hours car ride heading dad side family (so aunts, uncles, cousins kids etc... close 20 people) one cousin christening 1yo son. 
She said careful hugging/kissing (in cheeks common france way say hello hugs) sitting apart people dinner (she slightly runy nose thought normal seasonal allergies cautious anyway) dealing airborne virus doubt matters. mom also ate something plate fork (my sister) using... 

Anyway contagious would freaking superspreader event besides mom asthma (very light control decades rarely even need inhaler anymore) 71yo grandma (wasn't party since mom's side) fairly sure uncle/aunt two sort condition, one overweight.


Also tested negative couple weeks prior suspected contact someone campus, completely unaware possible infection contact unrelated first fact infected showing symptoms mistook seasonal allergies. Placebo = saline water = getting vaccine.

Having volunteers split placebo vaccine good way determining efficacy vaccine.

If participants vaccinated, let's say 5% test +ve 3 months. way knowing many actually got exposed virus, % number 5%.

Now, let's say 50% participants get placebo. Then, reasonably assume 3 months, roughly equal number participants placebo group, vaccine group must've gotten exposure virus determine effectiveness vaccine comparing positive rate placebo vs positive rate vaccine group. Excess deaths year stand 285,000, according article. CDC says 66% attributed covid -- 188,000. girl take one single claw drag lightly face I'm sleeping one food/water bowls empty. 4 water bowls, always water. Sometimes gets mad try pull hair teeth, gives ""kisses"" eyes form harassment try wake up.  That's hyperbolic hurt feelings. Always will, don‚Äôt care us Go Asia.

Edit: less glib, reason East Asian countries adopted masks flu season literally experience SARS probably save thousands lives flu it. Oh that‚Äôs good point, thanks chiming in.

Yeah feel like leads someone ‚Äúsuper-spreader‚Äù behavior actual viral load quantities.  best defense COVID fall winter -- Vitamin D. Get levels checked doctor supplement necessary get correct range. I've sub hundred users. everyone saying going stay China, said going spread like wildfire. said everyone China smokes cigarettes that's everyone getting it, called bullshit. spread Europe....and on. goalposts keep going farther farther delusional optimists. 

I wearing mask day united states declared public health emergency allowed wear masks work. cdc still saying masks sick need one sick. called bullshit that. look world. I've right side since beginning. may right never vaccine big headlines vaccine right around corner false promising read articles barely started first testing stages yet read ""Vaccine November best case scenario""!! read comments clear one reads articles... mean death vaccine? Hit bus? Drug overdoses? Natural causes? even write article? Seems like SinoVac best one, aware reuters article expand. visit maybe article. Article atm:

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil health authority Anvisa said Wednesday trials COVID-19 vaccine developed AstraZeneca University Oxford would continue death volunteer involved tests.

Anvisa gave details death, citing confidentiality protocols.  Especially since singing indoors groups dangerous.  would gain nothing risk together. key eliminate bring within risk tolerance.

There acceptable level COVID deaths per year based projections prevalence.

It seems likely vulnerable vaccinated, projected deaths come within society‚Äôs risk tolerance removal masks distance. 2 reasons. Remember vaccine 100% effective, effects compared set people behave same, vaccine. gave actual vaccines, volunteers would act different people, maybe get infected non-vaccinated people abandoned every precaution. 

Second, ask volunteers report side effects. get 25% got headache placebo actual vaccine group, say vaccine. If, say, 50% reported headache vaccine group, means doubled chances getting headache. Bravo. Really well put n=9 control group. Proves nothing. wonder long term mental social developmental effects childhood mask use going be? Love know live test positive allowed go doctor (except ER). I've home sick month mild, lingering symptoms. know tachycardia covid related, anemia, anxiety, something else can't go get physical blood work done. 

My doctor prescribed antibiotics inhaler like ""cool we'll talk finish medicine"" people want use dogs test... bad idea see? already running personnel, mattery many icus have... main hospital city congestioned two months now. incredible people still freaking out. clear, thanks worry guys, vaccines right around corner ! 

-local governments pot calling Kettle black? Parkland seeing surge cases. numbers UTSW hospital Dallas also way weeks ago [1]. Funny, official Texas covid case count Dallas seem reflect spike cases, remaining essentially flat [2]. One would expect hospitalization rates follow case counts, way around

1. wear mask getting flu vaccine? we‚Äôre not. Fuck know this? One study found even drug dogs produce false positive rate near 1/3. decades use them. supposed believe months know unequivocally suddenly dogs great this? thanks. Keep testing labs rapid kits going anything. ""In June, doctors lost hope Hairston stopped breathing 30 minutes. pronounced brain dead.""

You stop breathing long without permanent damage. great alive take steps, one goes long without permanent damage. Also, aunt KUMED KC, they‚Äôre also getting full. I'm sorry ludicrous. actually think hand hygiene thing take really beneficial. Working good levels vitamin also seemingly incredibly important good immune system. However, generally believe going expect people wear masks vaccine available say years time? Yeh alright mate!! Oh, misread, apologies  Oh people refuse test. One told didn‚Äôt want know. would major stress relief know person negative early take drugs case get tested repeatedly. Plus would worried potentially exposed spouse? Except that's works all. Look countries actually exhibited good lockdown behavior. Life returned normal there. people like keep promoting bullshit theory, we're still knee deep thing US.
 
Please try look science history condemning generation dealing ramifications lack understanding. Thank you, appreciate ton. I've telehealth four years since therapist works hours away live, helpful thing access  phrasing makes seem like implying CDC involving ""real"" doctors process making estimates. Also, could real doctor speak determine actual numbers deaths without making estimates? go around country count bodies? big deal. bars restaurants make enough pay bills distributing masks year. would plunge US economy complete spiral downwards condemn millions poverty. 

You cannot seriously believe saying right now. New infections meaningful compared March. They're really helpful comparing recent 4 months so. enough testing capacity start year catch infections. Here's see it: stop masks/distancing vaccine shown safe, effective, know long lasts. last bit take long time. mean, can't assert lasts year least year gone by, right? Time pass, data needs collected, lots questions need answers know relax. first round vaccinated people test subjects long term study. Or...you get jab, shed mask, maybe end cautionary tale others. entertainment industry known ""retcon"":

Is boring New Zealand hang Sweden threads babbling topic? gave experimental antibody treatment available public, steroid based drugs, remdesivir That‚Äôs hurt feelings. you‚Äôre actually feeling like comments hurting need leave house unplug sub. contagious, odd people end getting it. know someone whose husband travels work lot, symptoms (fever, loss smell, dry cough) extremely sick week late February, never tested tests widely available then, COVID really radar begun spread US. rest family could asymptomatic, experience it. Pittsburg! Yup. wear mask required go eat, travel, play hockey, people house dinner parties. told come back classroom, figured person class safe enough, recreational stuff safe enough.

Now concerts brought back! work big university people‚Äôs ideas productize drug vaccine crazy. could hand company like Pfizer. Lol know difference disease virus? way tell whether vaccine works real-world conditions.

You give x number people vaccine x number people placebo. Neither group knows whether vaccine placebo, behave way (ie. expose amount risk).

When trial over, see whether there's difference two groups terms many caught virus many severe symptoms catch virus.

You obviously can't work whether vaccine effective control group compare vaccinated people to, control group needs get placebo order make sure groups behave way. one group people knew vaccine one group knew vaccine, vaccinated people might behave differently take risks (because they'd feel safer). would mean comparing like like. O2 every time checked weeks got Covid doctor's visits 99 100. also 99-100 first got sick. 96 normal before, got low 92 sick. feel like experienced similar hallucinations times extremely sleep deprived. could cite information efficacy would ask cite virtue fact trials blinded, there‚Äôs 0% chance anyone else access kind supporting data. 

Pretending isn‚Äôt going get us this. Also, that‚Äôs vaccines work. It‚Äôs reducing severity infection (which is, again, unsupported empirical data), it‚Äôs reducing transmission. fact seeing people become reinfected worse outcomes contradicts perception. That‚Äôs data point wrt immune protection upon challenge. catch Spain, full mask mandate, constant lockdowns, closures etc etc... 

And highest numbers deaths Europe Well problem see proportion current restrictions growth new cases.

The risk high close contact positive closed space long time.

This definition exactly going school means. 20 people together room 5 hours day 6 days week. go home spend least 10 hours day home parents (and grandparents sometimes).. well least sleep assume. probably use public transportation everyday another risk factor.
What describing choice routine students follow.
Considering general people asymptomatic expecially true young people definitely something dangerous happening daily.

This reasoning also valid workplaces enforce smart working. Maybe less people asymptomatic older. Maybe people use scooters cars. risk still there.

Now telling get drink seated inside bar instead open air 6pm somehow improve situation much cancel described mystery me.
It make sense. Ok, vaccine available spring 2021, end 2021 expect production ramp up, competing, possibly effective vaccines also available. every vaccine 2-shot vaccine. 70% efficacy bit pessimistic, imo, math back-of-the-envelope best.

I'm saying there's certainty things back 100% pre-COVID point 2021, shot majority U.S. population still we're today, months proposed window vaccine availability, late 2021. sustainable. reason things bad people taking chances fatigue set in. It'll multiple-year ordeal sense completely eradicated, again, shot dominates everyone's lives deep 2021. going get it, it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs ‚Äúfault‚Äù. It‚Äôs airborne virus Christ‚Äôs sake. It‚Äôs ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù. don‚Äôt want get it, don‚Äôt leave home buy hazmat suit check mail. Currently, we're antivaxxers. So..... ""This sub became much depressing last days o_o"" 

I think one us needs walk hurt feelings admission. Hard keep straight. I'll read apparently holding pausing study there.

This leads believe likely got placebo.

Edit: source:  It‚Äôs excellent comparison talking infection rate determining metric wrt getting back ‚Äúbusiness usual‚Äù Very. know daily testing rate is?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That‚Äôs objectively false. People risk developing type 1 diabetes. Young people losing lung function, whole require transplant. Heart neurological damage abounds. 

Mortality part story stated misconception big part problem. Meanwhile morons charge state bars open definitely lot human terms stupid shit. lemme guess enlightened friends family lived thousands years. Go smell fart piece shit Ya, can't believe Cuomo Newsom putting doubts people's minds right vaccine... credentials make declarative statements?

I'm pretty sure already know figured I'd ask safe. There's range positions ""shrugging off"" Covid 19 understanding nowhere close sheer destruction caused historic plagues. Minor global pandemics tend come around every 20ish years, civilization-shattering plagues maybe century Yes agree, confidence level modern medicine low per analysis studies preformed overall (not vitro) majority vaccines antivirals/antibiotics/antibacterials. certainly understand development drugs work, throughout history. understanding lead overall dissatisfaction. may medical background however statistical analysis background. years reviewing data medical studies come realization modern medicine homeopathic medicine much different comes methodology studies presentation results. data undeniable outliers flaws certain ones pointed accepted made certain scienctist.

My point efforts directly related vast amount effort everywhere discredit, simply say ""no evidence"" fact is. Like science, begins educated hypothesis. people dont understand much newly discovered information immune system dramatically changes approach decade.In end fine line scientists ""conspiracy"" theorist that's alarming. 

I problem people treating others conspiracy theorist dismissing creditable scientists conform general census. disservice us humans. fact large amount people science would considered throughout history, persistence perseverance overcoming negative bashlash eventually becomes widely accepted. science modern era humans could significantly progressed much effort put discrediting blind dismissals. 

As whole tip iceberg understanding universe, let alone human body. Though average people think deeper understanding. Sure significantly advanced 200 years ago compared what, basically none? last decade discoveries due advancements technology last 100 years. Yet continue limited knowledge based trial &amp; error studies advancements technology. Science, industry, politics intertwined deepy, from, statistical point view, swings pendulum far one direction, direction far benefit science humans. incentives aside overall good humanity always consequences. trust science modern medicine, science 100 years ago acknowledge none perfect. science physics medicine, one must always consider outside influences (x variables), statistics too. Unfortunately, politics industry become one variable become major influences medicine. Yup. People getting tired Don‚Äôt switch actually hurting feelings need unplug bit go walk. mean I‚Äôm sure bad - able go restaurants again. (1) wear mask areas high prevalence, (2) wear mask possible, good would save lives compared normal flu season, (3) longer delay getting Covid, better treatments be. may long time get 2019 again, it‚Äôs spectrum. Dang, feels like month ago Northern Italy getting destroyed COVID. read K people spread few, many. may attributable recklessness. contagious others. live California?? Life definitely ‚Äúnormal‚Äù live CA. Everyone know still WFH, indoor malls gyms still closed, indoor restaurants closed, playgrounds closed, kids school, bars closed, movie theaters music venues open, many mom pop shops/restaurants permanently shut down, homelessness skyrocketed... stopped going gym month ago transparent trainer covid. cases spiking really want go anyways. matter since still ride, swim hike.

I eat twice week I've eating outdoors carryout.

I still job work home, I've done since February.

I spend time friends outdoors distanced. spend time neighbors indoors WFH none us spreading virus at-risk people.

I traveling places lull cases summer, drove 3000 miles continued best safe covid practices. friends live Ashland would kindly ask visit covid chilled out. I‚Äôm two different prescription acne medications (which insurance cover) acne caused masks. fine wear mask every day work. faces meant covered time. could certainly see future masks widely used, like planes public transportation lingering cough recovering cold. absolutely don‚Äôt want wearing mask covid shift well let‚Äôs wear mask time forever. Herd immunity never viable option. 

No virus Earth ever caused herd immunity naturally. simply cannot spread people fast enough, mutate ever becomes ubiquitous. people it, mutates.

Herd immunity works vaccines. even then, extent. That's flu still thing.  know man. Clearly, vaccine effective can't stop cases placebo.

/s Never been, never live town 5 miles across, bordering towns red zone according CDC map. Hooray. Stay podunk little town, plz. point people like wearing masks time fewer fewer people wear them. Even Asia norm everyone wears masks flu season, feel sick exposed someone sick. work cheap. Gotta get least $1K per test gummint. Yeah, right. totally agree. remarked someone else reasoning flawed, mistake risk assessment public one, that's error. feel I'm moving goalpost, since February: 2-3 years. get agree, get agree forced circumstances risks comfortable with. Well shit.  hope Yeah, covid seems strongly linked opened schools -we‚Äôve closed really fast first wave pretty mild. We‚Äôve opened fucking tragedy. vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect 100%, like vaccines don‚Äôt, need keep masks social distancing forever? 

Please Ngl shes kinda hot. Definitely possible, like said interesting observation calculations spreadsheet. Dangerous, know. USA 8.3M confirmed cases COVID. seroprevalence surveys showing 1 10 cases diagnosed early days. 

Let's guess we're better, 1 5 cases caught today, think extremely optimistic. So, let's say instead 8.3M, we've actually 40M cases, 13% population already exposed. confirmed cases 60k/day range, nationally. 

If say real number probably 5x that, 300k/day, growth continues linearly 4k cases per day (according recent trends last two months), we're looking 20% Christmas. 40% April. 

So, adding vaccination highest risk, wonder transmission greatly reduced. They're saying 67% herd immunity, 40-50% seems like it'd dramatically slow things down. masks required Japanese government. won‚Äôt anywhere. And, thus, won‚Äôt wear one. 

(But want thank real quick attacking different opinion. Everyone seems trying push society ‚Äúnew‚Äù normal society‚Äôs will.) (Florida based) university sent around email need follow example k-12 systems offer person classes. wanted reply, ‚ÄúSure, we‚Äôll start seeing cases then, you‚Äôll probably professors die. sure, follow amazing lead k-12 schools?!?‚Äù literally didn‚Äôt get vaccine smh Business depends growth innovation. words Jesus don't. stay same. think anyone promising this. order magnitude volunteers typical trials, really good, testing phase short.

But think drugs, people tested upside inside make sure get chronic, silent disease it. done.

So, end, boils question: Get vaccine early risk another timespan getting Covid. theory, not? get productivity healthy workers sick leave disruptive. tool reduce spread illnesses, financially speaking, makes sense use flatten

Flatten curve maxing hospital capacity

*taps forehead* think vaccine may November? easiest way give government middle finger get away it. exactly you? hand shaking formal greeting, usually used workplace. people greet friends feel like COVID-19 might wake call worse health crisis come. Unfortunately, global perspective, handling pandemic good places. exceptions few. rethink ways things right now, make much deadlier pandemic another type global crisis. interconnected world like one live in, isolating possible, affected, one way another. killing people Rona Cats would eat us bigger.
I still think cuddly. understand although normal matter perspective. Masks normal asia long time now. guess time place options. also get genuine human experience social media look talking right now. Death worst outcome anything. feel otherwise suggest therapy. initial lockdown certainly waste - saved countless lives.

But agree second point - close offices, schools, hospitality - anywhere people different households spend significant amount time confined indoor space. makes sense.

As someone Pfizer trial reaction couple days... even though know tell approved yet... find significantly less worried shopping gym. can‚Äôt help it. still mask thought may form immunity point takes lot stress away simply allowing rationalize things get anxiety.

This happen lot people. Without high levels anxiety, also think people start getting behind reopening policies. least personal level. know someone postponed wedding twice now. flat said would postpone again.

Also event industry decimated. know lot people work concerts, conventions, live events really happening. Unless enforce mask wearing kids.

Front line risk start getting vaccinated late 2020, early 2021, general public starting Spring done start Fall 2021.

I'm still hopeful though start vaccinating risk front line workers, help clamp deaths spread. I'm hanging thought person vaccinate means much closer done pandemic level. Hopefully restrictions return normal starts March April 2021. mean says died virus. vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% effective he‚Äôs placebo, it‚Äôs entirely possible it‚Äôs vaccine related. election, regardless wins, see big time action Covid front. think governors unwilling much close election, especially considering things came areas states 2016. think see sensible republican governors clamp down, democratic governors clamp down. Even Trump wins see alternative here. Since consensus largely back normal 2022 political harm could cause portions electorate gone. 

So naturally means DeSantis figure way mess up. Sorry hurt feelings. delete comments please ;) Yep, expecting 400k new year nothing changes. It‚Äôs sad right now. wild guess, one firmly thoroughly debunked, months start, scientists knew bats likely origin virus, quite lot people thought eating exotic animals part problem, although I've literally never heard ""eaten raw"" part before. thought 2012 SARS pandemic, scientists tracked _that_ virus virus originally spread among bats. found 2017. took five years pandemic research necessary track previous species harbored virus, there's actual certainty species involved. MERS pandemic (a much smaller pandemic) spread camels humans, example, although may also come bats camels point distant past.

anyway, still spring, theory quickly changed idea transmitted bats pangolins, pangolins humans via ""wet markets."" China allows live animals stored cages top markets, probably accelerates virus evolution. early May, scientists gone wet markets Wuhan testing animals virus found also hella conspiracy theories obviously, reality science takes time, lot people prefer believing nonsense waiting long, dull process science needs go order actually find truth. thing eating bats raw definitely part that. even cultures people eat bats, Indonesia China, cook first. mean that's ridiculous. Bad news, decided run office.... good enough! needed yesterday! pre-pandemic hobbies involved outdoor activities (hiking, camping, mountain biking, running, etc.) pretty much impossible things solitude without running crowds.


Even pre-pandemic that's Colorado heading awhile now, massive influx people wanting live activities. also double-edge sword good people getting bad idea trail/outdoor etiquette placing large amounts stress areas used able handle it. 

Mostly I'm super irritated, problem awhile, people choose live city Denver willingly drive 4-8 hours one way weekend claiming environmentally conscious living mountain lifestyle. They're literally ones bringing crowds otherwise chill areas. weekends frustrating see. limited people live cities Colorado either. Wilderness integral part human condition want live lifestyle make sustainable possible live city. Live recreate.

The mountain biking scene growing last years course, covid blew shit people traveling destinations previously unknown infrequently visited. lot places relaxed covid restrictions that's possible influx people. Moab prime example people Las Vegas, Salt Lake City Denver driving MANY hours weekend piled top other. 

I even know I'm going I'm frustrated people chose live city consistently weekend warrior it. I'd like figure write sort thesis find why, social media? wanting get find solitude? know. paradise paved name progress accessibility I'm jaded. Please aware Reuters sometimes expand short storys, visit maybe link. Article atm:

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian health authority Anvisa said Wednesday volunteer clinical trial COVID-19 vaccine developed AstraZeneca Oxford University died, stating received data investigation matter.

I'm sure reaction saline placebo... wasn‚Äôt question. question link it? speak California French spoke France exploded cases. Every time high traffic, high volume area attempts open hard lockdown, get influx cases commensurate much open up. We'll see next weeks unfold reopening strategy goes. 

P.S. stop sending Texas California transplants driving housing market! keep sending In-and-Out Burgers. Eh, ""200000 lot"" started Trump states failed handle virus.

Literally article. What's worse healthcare system already overloaded. Hospitals full accept new patients. Doctors reporting triage begin. Ambulances sick people circling around cities queueing front hospitals, hoping maybe soon covid beds become free.

So wave? It‚Äôs really defined, it? cases? severe cases/ICUs? deaths? matter what, Sweden (yet) anywhere near **real** numbers March/April, second wave similar first, don‚Äôt think?

And ICU cases people **become** seriously sick. admitted, really magic treatment administrated. advancements people **put in** ICUs. ICU admissions still gold standard COVID19 developments. depends hospitalisations ICU capacity actual number daily deaths.

Doesn‚Äôt matter. weren‚Äôt wearing masks anyways. could count hands feet many people see Walmart Utah County don‚Äôt mask on. see people fb groups asking stores don‚Äôt require masks. even talking someone job offer day asked company requires masks, told yes, seemed uninterested. never mandate, recommendation.

I'm certainly getting whichever vaccine available made available me. 

I trust science random Redditors take sick pleasure watching world burn around enjoy drama all. Per Covid death rate us ~2%, expect decrease time. drop morality increase diagnosis rate.

That said, death rate &lt;50yo like 0.2%, you‚Äôll math death rate 70yo.

And yes, I'm currently living Covid red zone almost never go door. exactly right. ideal scenario, proportion receiving placebo get COVID following, say, 6 months, few, any, receiving vaccine get COVID 6 months. ratio infection vaccine placebo groups what's important need lot volunteers study reduce random volatility would otherwise get results.

Bear mind ratio change time. say 6 months ratio infection rates 3:1 placebo:vaccine. continue study 24 months, immunity vaccinated waned ratio 2:1. That's pop pop Yeah Europe started weeks earlier Canada. growing exponentially. Disregarding inane logic regards virus, imagine moving everyone around every 15 mins would quite disruptive learning, obviously priority. take risks opening schools even really respect that. 

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd vary schools even classrooms 15 mins pretty fucking short. Pack everything up, shuffle around, take notebooks textbooks pens, get maybe 5-10 mins focused attention it‚Äôs time pack shuffle again. Even students without adhd imagine would really impede actual learning. there‚Äôs probably students heightened anxiety increased exposure, etc. 

It seems unproductive dumb. virus largely stamped out. shared quote Tegnell. think he‚Äôs lying habit changes made months back? died cause works doctor frontlines. vaccine. end then? vaccine treatments, death rate acceptable level, like flu. sucks autoimmune disorder. must careful. absence illness means achievable. human body needs able fight illness survive. IMO, may different opinion. nice day though. Yikes... guess I‚Äôm trying say I‚Äôm guaranteed covid can‚Äôt enter body dies rendering untransferable, I‚Äôm popping mask [G1 Peace brave warrior! Yep. I've also posted reminders Matthew 4:7, *Thou shalt tempt Lord thy God*. That's verse Satan tells Jesus throw mountain prove he's God. dangerous things saying God protect also ""tempting Lord.""

BTW I'm Humanist. Unlike believers, actually studied Bible know rules are. Bear mind increased testing since alot cases we're probably missed back March/April. true figure actual cases probably much higher Fr, :P Lol good one, sounds like dont either. regularly highly contagious viruses around us times, picked droplets. 
 
If would pandemic, wear masks. 
 
Understand now? advice kids. done research kids. tell one thing though - got something may may Covid-19, taking 40 mg zinc like throwing switch. multivitamin giving 11mg, supposedly 100% nothing. 40mg, illness turned around 24 hours. took 6 weeks get rid it.  Yes 'Happened' years come lol Also Sweden drastically adjusted habits way Americans weren‚Äôt going without explicitly told to.

I prefer believe lying eyes (tram ride cam daily life Sweden, notice social distancing masks, importantly, bustling thriving locked sparsely populated archipelago years come. somewhat understand, boredom must immense  Yes, I'm still waiting answer questions:

* overall population size influence single nursing home managed?
* exactly prevents American for-profit nursing homes managed like Canadian non-profit nursing homes less people die them?
* [The shear number inhabitants] problem, simply split nursing home two even more, number inhabitants allows better management? thought Ireland? go back hard lockdown like March schools open NHS test results back! Shame 9 days 2 missed weeks college. Can't believe much spent utter shambles. Apparently, don't. credentials make statements like this? You‚Äôre right. dealing new disease seemed deadly (and capacity overwhelm hospitals like has) lockdowns acceptable measure. know lasts year everyone wearing mask said year? I'm really sorry hear that. There's never 100% safety masks, disinfectant etc. harsh yourself. really ""luck"" one point get not.
I wish speedy recovery! could cite information efficacy would ask cite virtue fact trials blinded, there‚Äôs 0% chance anyone else access kind supporting 

I think salient discussing estimated effectiveness vaccine threshold approval, Pfizer stated must minimum 76.9% per protocol. 

Source: fact seeing people become reinfected worse outcomes contradicts perception. 

The prevalence reinfection minuscule worthy concern. I'd highly recommend hopping r/covid19 read scientific discussion is. peer-reviewed study Qatar estimated 0.1% reinfection rate, vast majority mild symptoms upon reinfection. Source: wearing mask got flu vaccine, wearing COVID still thing yet vaccine.

The poster asking normal circumstances, getting flu vaccine (if decided get it) would wear mask? No, misunderstanding. CDC saying 97,000 due reasons, hesitance inability get routine medical care primary driver. Good ol Sam Quentin smattering sources don‚Äôt know preferred style *how*, may ask, good things? No, virologist who's looked sequence knows claims ""unnaturally occuring"" elements erroneous. make people put mask bodies....? think it‚Äôs irresponsible max government even announce it!

It‚Äôs double blind study. turns got placebo weren‚Äôt willing share that, like wtf Brazil. right lockdowns many years come yeh? wear Asia flu. One stat familiar 60,000 people USA die flu. masking general could save 30,000 lives, feel like that‚Äôs worth it. There's big difference saying virus hoax manipulated thinking worse is. aid controlling weak willed people like yourself. treat like world's ending ignore completely, big shock world gray area right? üòë 'spanish flu' pandemic happened people absolutly wore masks keep safe. mandated written law... people could see bodies piling didnt want one. numbers total tests positivity rates widely available. look see majority U.S. states increasing positivity rates. report 70+ people getting reporting bias.

Every year USA teenagers twentysomethings die influenza worse.  source back up? cynic says public they're storing vaccines insane conspiracy people might try something there. hope they're paying top dollar really mean security. kind security guards riffles bullet proof vests, donut-disappearing, walkie-talkie-wielding, 12/hr, 10th grade dropouts. large portion people get flu vaccine get flu.

Would love see math if. people though safe allowed go people think safe allowed go? tf get vaccine Death possible side effect? Social distancing mask wearing still carries risk course, risk vaccine all? Antibodies shown last months anyways. Social distancing, go several months without getting disease. 

The risk vs benefit simply doesn‚Äôt seem there, like flu vaccine. Yup, aren‚Äôt pausing trials (and they‚Äôve already shown willing pause trials) don‚Äôt even know warrants headlines. I'm saying acceptable. isn't. never is.

I'm looking possible psychological based angles.

Personally believe rise due already abusive relationships escalating comprised partners anger rage issues simmering surface finally exploding.

There contributing factors whether want admit not.  Right... meaning 100,000 extra died without reasonable explanation aside from: undercounted covid deaths think might God sending us message, like Hurricane Katrina? hear you. eye roll becomes audible. hear next door. becoming real problem.

That's 60x cases per day. reference, Europe 20x population canada. telling get drink seated inside bar instead open air 6pm somehow improve situation much cancel described mystery me. make sense.

It's theatre order delay inevitable bit. Everyone knows happen, need able tell people tried everything else options.  Exactly. add, placebo makes double-blind study. give half subjects placebo, everyone study would know watched, could introduce error...like behaved differently, researchers introduced bias. entirely true COVID. individuals become sick developed strong antibody response, others destructive antibodies; meanwhile, individuals strong immune response develop proper antibodies.

It's one hell virus. searched article word ""mask"" see it. Wearing masks low cost alternative lockdowns. Seems smart countries go whole-hog mask wearing first, targeted lockdowns second. So, see article like this, see anything mask wearing, take seriously. basically another herd immunity article, I'm thinking, want gain immunity lower dose virus, wearing mask would accomplish?  wide swath opinions, concept ""infectious dose"" seems thrown window.    

Another thing wonder about, advice saying, take daily multi-vitamin?  another low cost approach might help immune system become stronger, likely harm. happened Salem, clearly witchcraft. spooky season all.

But seriousness, amazing. pointed out, reason fewer deaths people ICU better hospital treatments would still see corresponding number hospital admissions, even thoose stay long.

Using Uppsala example seems trouble ""second wave"": worst week spring (week 16) 78 people admitted hospital. Compared week 40 8 admitted hospital.

How reason less deaths due better treatments people going hospital get treated. give EUA companies even submitted yet Trevor Bedford returned dropping nuggets (US Oh Poland got it‚Äôs problems. Change places! They're also bypassing feds shipping plan going directly states. That's incredibly smart considering happened ppe testing supplies. you‚Äôre looking data April year.

Both studies looking similar time windows.

The difference study looking New York city, study including data 14 different states. 

And think New York situation extra bad policies regarding senior's homes no?

Or could New Yorkers particularly bad health? maybe pollution something worse outcomes, like Bergamo Italy.

Regardless, survival rates improved dramatically since springtime, right? current situation undoubtably better either New York numbers, nationwide numbers. back envelope, didn‚Äôt hide assumptions I‚Äôm curious think 70% efficacy pessimistic granted that‚Äôs flu vaccine 60% effective given year even strains well matched. second point contradictory. say reason things bad risky behavior also claim current regulations unsustainable. seems support claim compliance safety guidelines deteriorate leading prolonged duration pandemic. sure think things better next year unless we‚Äôre able get substantially greater 50% herd immunity outside two standard deviations expected seasonal vaccine. aren‚Äôt two options. You‚Äôre assuming measures work. You‚Äôre also assuming benefits outweigh consequences. It‚Äôs also hilarious people like preach compassion yet you‚Äôre advocating throwing people prison. along thought 10 minutes. 

But ‚Äúcumulative within 24 hour‚Äù bit new me. Canada boat. Nobody wants hear L word. 300,000 excess deaths USA even want consider option country covid free less quarter year. happened Australia hope countries come senses soon. government demanding wear mask. Probably lives ICU Funny, know plenty people basement dwellers wearing masks safe respectful thing do. need insult people okay wearing masks says lot. Yeah... owned multinational corporations. pandemic death blow small bussiness owners. yes, ancestors learned millions years evolution necessity quickly getting rid antibodies coronaviruses bodies, coronaviruses cunning trick sleeve - antibody mediated enhancement infection, major reason vaccine development first SARS MERS failed, however, scared, cellular immunity bodies develop infected live virus provide protection life. Unfortunately, many vaccines induce B- cell response, immunity short-lived dangerous case coronaviruses. facts well known scientific community, damn, governments across globe pore crazy money make vaccine, nobody stupid stay away party. Hopefully, stupid get injected.

a link reading: Wow, tested 2 weeks ago. results available online well 24 hours. 

They took sample around 11Am Friday reported negative woke Saturday. 

I directly pay test. Sweden zero deaths, Oct also get reply 2+ years lockdown precious Fauci announced Antivaxxers going head heels this.

The person passed away good soul either way, hope passing painful. placebo group. 

Anti-vaxxer group happy, media reporting right way. Depends are. south right? Assuming something apocalyptic happen winter, yeah think right region. live west coast, gonna long time. Doesn‚Äôt matter. one knows close know actual vaccine Yeah seems line thought. distribute vaccine properly ""who afford get line fastest"", could lot good. US country......


Oh wait Lol that's fine dandy 11th straight hour damn mask 14 hour flight. top that, everyone takes mask eat anyway put back lol + people snacking drinking etc. etc. I'd prefer show negative test within like...48 hours gate move international flights. Domestic yeah, wear mask. Ive see cases cats carrying coronavirus, dogs? so, transmit people? Even move towards people wearing masks they're sick would huge. social ending always happens actual ending pandemic Nah- shitty unproductive. need act like ass call sensitive saying that. comment wasnt 'cheeky' clever, patronizing. every century event I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty good bet doesn‚Äôt happen lifetimes. Yay us. Number one something. Hard say, would think would hard vaccinate developing countries, elimination developed countries achievable. Masks becoming commonplace sick and/or places at-risk people can‚Äôt avoid, like grocery stores, doctor‚Äôs offices, dry cleaners, public transportation? see logic maybe enforce 

Masks mandated 24/7 permanently, everywhere? don‚Äôt see they‚Äôll convince people it. isn‚Äôt coming selfish, it‚Äôs fact many people aren‚Äôt now. correct type study, placebo best way determine actual effect vaccine. saying term ""double-blind"" nothing placebo. could, example, design study placebo vaccine, subject know one got researcher does. would single-blind study design, still using placebo. 

The double-blind aspect try reduce bias. (shitty) understanding flu vaccine either live dead cells virus supposed increase resistance get it. necessarily full immunization. Again, shitty not-a-doctor understanding. they‚Äôve since came said two antivirals remdesivir ?? don‚Äôt anything fight virus. 

So either don‚Äôt enough drugs we‚Äôre getting misinformation Trump spouting big mouth again. Oh no. Someone Hollywood writing script sequel Sharknado Lavalantula. Tigerstorm! hate America much, leave. weird chance, anyone keeping count many Health Ministers caught Covid? ***seems*** like lot, OTOH maybe get reported due irony factor? First year grad student checking complain think air, micro second, replaced every 6 minutes? replaced gradually course 6 minutes? listening esteemed radiologist Scott Atlas, kind blatant disregard quackery lead inevitably to........ success! thinking? Yes. five year old knows touch stuff wiped down. Even come back chocolate bar. today mom came home something told wiped car, told touch cause wiped down. 

Children easily learn stuff. get political lockdowns, people can't trusted. I'm sick selfish people claim rights taken away. reasonable assume numbers getting certain states/areas almost certainly ""adjusted"" maintain appearances. gotta gotta do, unfortunately. that, asking trouble.

Why? need get efficacy data group one way another. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ""It unknown received vaccine placebo""

OK - re-read placebo. looked page see higher rates see increase testing listed, chart showing ""percent target"" . 'half ass shutdown' pretty strict back beginning. Basically grocery stores open. I'm sorry think enough, completely unrealistic expect more.. May ask country from? Right now, isn‚Äôt much evidence face shields working substitute masks. good conjunction masks higher risk settings provide eye protection help keep mask cleaner, CDC recommend wearing alone mask substitute. 

Sorry misinterpreted comment- I‚Äôve previously seen people advocate universal mask wearing every flu season, we‚Äôd wearing masks half year. That‚Äôs don‚Äôt want. Really, really, don‚Äôt want. I‚Äôm California mask mandate, right think great, I‚Äôm concerned may years gets rolled back. 

I hate getting sick like one else, wonder much colds flus could prevented people stayed home sick. covid. Would doctors quarantined first? Portable goalposts. Nice! does. limits travel. Regardless much control limited travel reduces cases. I'm scientist would also assume enclosed space long period time greatly increases odds transmitting virus. bet 100k spare testing capacity must 50k locations across UK process 2 tests day else would redirecting people 300 miles get test done? thought sun warm weather going make disappear?!

What's placebo? make work Texas, need armed person door, openly armed people patrolling aisles.

This joke. wish joking. said anything app tracking ‚Äúcovid patients‚Äù Getting tested tomorrow days feeling well. Thought maybe allergies but... we'll see. would second time turns positive. ^ That‚Äôs growing exponentially heading towards massive shutdowns 2-3k deaths day. Nice going. is....am right? Interesting. know Canada pre-ordered ton Pfizer vaccine. Usually two go hand hand. comment leads believe think placebo killed volunteer Obviously misinformation downplaying coronavirus, think many people ask about, however curious thoughts misinformation overplays coronavirus. Obviously coronavirus serious people need safe take proper precautions, wear mask, etc. However, I've seen people comment left house 6 months etc seen anyone, wear masks even nobody around etc. even people take potentially unnecessary precautions wearing mask walk willing sit restaurant eat meal indoors. 

I curious might say people? Dutch guy living U.S watching Corona virus news well Netherlands.. think right. didn‚Äôt call incompetent say got raw deal. 10 times rate death bordering countries had, worth noting. 

It‚Äôs also important address residents Sweden responded differently pandemic American residents did. argument could used number things deal everyday, stupid argument. Oh good. level up? hate government much. Kicking screaming anything inconvenience people directly next you, government. we've got, best we've got. even government issue; American issue. Worldwide best solution helping Global issue easily wearing mask. would someone put money new restaurant knowing could shut indefinitely something like this? Yeah...I'm way wheelhouse. Seems me, without placebo, simple knowledge ""a vaccine"" administered would squirrel things up. even several vaccine candidates trial, they'd still use placebo group everyone double-extra-totally blind. Want trophy something? Also really number cases healthcare system handle. (Polish) bad shape). Ambulances already roam cities patients board looking spot hospitals... Thank stop spread misinformation amidst pandemic. I'm Communicable Disease Investigator local Public Health Department called respond COVID placed Custody/Unhoused response team. question is, approach would take getting jail deputies consistently wear face coverings seem ones bringing virus housing units? supporters administration thus subjected lot misinformation. Thanks! believe would Brazil's call, though. least regulators. DSMB trial would reviewing data sites. standards they're using need compliance guidelines countries new drug application expected submitted. means standards apply Europe (EMA) US (FDA) would apply here.

To clear, regulators would pull red lever here. would DSMB, compliance regulations.

Now, possible they've split trial unusual way distinct DSMB Brazil. see benefit approach, I'm sure would draw criticism regulatory bodies unless done really, really compelling reason. Well seems you‚Äôre stuck fear porn. I‚Äôm gonna go unnecessarily visit businesses today spite you. winter even arrived yet, Liege hospital looking like italy march. Meanwhile idiot doctor gets shown TV currently problem, problem defunding hospitals accept deaths flu well. federal government normal one one buy vaccine approved, federal level things handled distribution within SUS (""single healthcare system""). since ruled science denialists paranoid buffoons trying get us killed may go way. case States may bring case supreme court buy distribute vaccines enforce use themselves, federal government tried seize ventilators states bought China Boston public schools even open yet- high needs students attending person, planned phase-in hybrid rest students. Compete fucking assumptions say correlation suggests causation wrong. doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs probably common misconception correlation means. 

Making statement like ‚Äúmore sleep cause perform better work‚Äù ‚Äúmore cardio cause lose belly fat‚Äù may correct, need *evidence* show causal relationship two variables. 

Saying likely causative relationship two correlated variables two uncorrelated variables makes correlated variables. It‚Äôs likely saying color blue blue think they're lying covid? difference?

""Are super spreader?""

If answer ""I hope not. gotten tested so..."" they're super spreader.

If answer ""No. I'm sick! furthermore hysteria around China virus riducul-"" they're super spreader. Alot articles fearmongering crowd stirring little way offering actual solutions. Yeah, I‚Äôve started seeing casedemic pop debunking/hoax videos lately. One thing never consider. always go false positives cases show infections. never consider false negatives cases don‚Äôt show infections. Honestly 100,000 tests, 10,000 positive assume 5,000 false positives really even consider many 90,000 negatives false negatives. test 60% success rate trust negative result 100% time 

We already know frequently takes 2, 3 even tests (especially PCR) shows positive even cases symptoms. ~ US state slammed Covid There's nothing people got it, stop wasting time. Better entire body pressed face sleeping lol..

My cat seem understand need breath. Either that, trying in. think they‚Äôre underlying condition like people. It‚Äôs dumb abandon effort we‚Äôre close vaccine. normal people families dependents aren‚Äôt going stop socially distancing either get vaccine, threat infection/complications becomes way lower now. Florida proved that. Big Parks including Disney opened back up... nobody came. Attendance still way 2019 levels. restaurants bars foot traffic. People stayed away own. That‚Äôs people doing. We‚Äôve told Fauci experts virus dangerous believe them.

I think trying push big ‚ÄúGrand Reopening‚Äù narrative, turnout low, probably hurt economy more. It‚Äôs better realistic focus reducing virus harm instead. return normal naturally flow becomes truly safe so. shit annoying hear. 
My dad‚Äôs friend mechanic regular. Guy everytime went oil change. 
Even pandemic id see guy. Fastforward last week, told guy died NJ. asked why? Couldnt covid since got March. told guy went take care family jersey september. Tested positive covid. symptoms nowhere went hospital straight ICU died heart attack. 
Which reminds me, sick mid january. Got better around mid february. Negative flu. developed symptoms similar less severe late March. sick week. PCR test positive covid. First week May, told give blood sample covid serology test. 0.1 antibodies covid. Nobody could explain it. father sick, too(i got him) pcr positive. time serology test, result 8.4 antibodies covid. 
Doctor told pcr test couldve false positive. agreed back since father actually developed strong antibodies virus(1.4 treshold).
For last check told probably covid twice, never developed antibodies. Though second infection mild. single news source never heard runs clicks add revenue?

FAZ rather reputable German newspaper. Yes, site ads, like One hardline opinion? 

Well, first time (to knowledge) anyone giving estimate *how long* vaccination effort might take. far, government ever talked hope *Former* chairman? 

He apparently resigned wish, indications scandals surrounding person. Lol. already seen massive gatherings throughout pandemic?

No, found interesting lopsided Earth's population is. Exactly. would bet substantial money actually vegetative state, family misreporting terminology. even say ""They thought would vegetable."" Worst part awfull lot people still claiming fakenews, cv doesnt exist, king dick (well wasnt smart thats sure), oh hans, believing - spouting kind conspiracies.. rn virus scare most, people . Imagine dying got placebo feel sorry non-parachute control group. virus won‚Äôt kill vaccine cat going crazy white asparagus  Based schizo Yeah wish gave people vaccine exposed coronavirus purpose, called challenger trials scroll last table page ""Last 14 Days Tests (Rolling)"" ""Positivity Trend (Last 14 Days Rolling)"" columns. entire U.S. shows rolling average daily tests increased 972.5 thousand 1.1 million per day 13.1% increase testing past 14 days. time average percent tests came back positive increased 4.6% 5.6%. combination two shows testing happening (13.1% increase), higher positivity rate tests. daily average 14 days ago 44,700 cases (972,000 \* 4.6%), today 61,000 cases (1,100,000 \* 5.6%) 37.7% increase new cases. 


EDIT: accidentally said 44,700 tests meant cases. talking someone lives irrevocably harmed.. lockdowns one thing.. relationships, marriages, etc ravaged stress uncertainty whole thing takes big toll well. lot couples know splitting this, isn‚Äôt end world them, it‚Äôs disheartening. lot people traveling outside state. Plus, covid fatigue starting get people. winter going blood bath. lot stores getting relaxed. mainly shop Costco now. heart goes guys family, literally came coin toss üôÅ group people think taking drug studied taking fake drug... see people taking real drug actually affected positively negatively group taking nothing. Texas finally pulled ahead California.... dimwits ready guard bathrooms guns last year completely forgot. They‚Äôll do, say, think masters fox tell understand. think next someone infected 3 minutes means safe. 

It's bullshit rules make everyone feel little bit ease, nobody panics. 

Its based hard science. Damn vaccine still valid right? Cause got placebo And? Young Doctors generally susceptible high risk complications even death compared average youngster due viral load receive(even developing countries).  
Theres huge difference 28 year old wearing masks, moderate social distancing (or not) vs 28 year old doctor constantly exposed infectious, coughing patients every day. imagine much exposed doesnt proper PPE-which lacking healthcare workers even developed countries like US Uk legal, since agency meant technical, guess federal govt influence it. 
The president Anvisa nominated president approved Senate majority votes. Kind like federal judges Supreme Court. 
The thing is.. governor Doria become biggest rival Bolsonaro 2022 elections. Butantan Institute Sao Paulo repected country, conducting coronavac testings. Bolsonaro far agreeable vaccine, tries impose political restrictions, Joao Doria would make main flag presidential campaign. complicated. 
I'd vouch restrictions since things dangerous. Side effects real. far reports side effects. long-term studies tho. volunteer control group receive covid-19 vaccine died reasons. South Dakota, North Dakota. respectfully disagree. different understandings economics organization/functioning society. Nonetheless, best luck there. steps in

ü§® signed picked. here, talking lockdowns, really can‚Äôt afford lenient I‚Äôve learned think colds spread efficiently fomites COVID efficiently gastrointestinal viruses i'm 100% sure US -30% GDP

GER -7% GDP

PRC +5.2% GDP

Them Chinese buyin' BMWs again. Americans don't. Never understood people would take huge risk go worship God gave world plague. sayin. sure thinking there. I'm talking Sweden. Exactly this. know majority young kids symptomatic, get tested, contact tracing school nightmare. Nice, thanks. Transparency great, drug trials stopping starting perfectly normal. need treat like sort conspiracy.

Edit: also article says paused. 220,000 US. That's downside modern journalism. accurate FIRST! Even correct later, still looked won. mean rally 2 months ago? disease 2 week total incubation period?

Which it? cause it, willfully stupid? please appreciate persons ultimate sacrifice? Anyone whos participating real hero.

Thank you. study general. select people know placebo actual vaccine r/oddlyspecific scam whole thing everyone wants purely plant based either. salad cut it, I'd feel hungry time. Factory farming go away matter though. placebo? really wish industry reopen. literally live waiting next concert massive event. also miss bars, clubs even casual reunion freaking fear. understand U.S. adequate social safety net lock extended period time One isolated incident example? know actually got prisoners due confined space?

Prison like cruise ships, everything quickly spreads there.

Type interaction location matters. would require consent patient since falls HIPAA don‚Äôt want go extremes I‚Äôve going (following precautions, socializing, pickup only, avoiding indoor things) years. I‚Äôve pretty strict it.

I really hate think need precautions mass vaccination. would necessary wasn‚Äôt choice, damn, nobody wants that. 

I wouldn‚Äôt mind wearing mask though. Say, vaccines roll people vaccinated, would probably alright small indoor get together. I‚Äôd want mask really don‚Äôt want get anyone care (or anyone all) sick. China &lt;5000 daily cases, Australia 700. longer wait longer lockdown going be. I'm spaniard. I'm also crushed prospect new lockdown, really scared economical fallout. I'm, all, deeply disappointed instutions society. That's worst part, lost trust country.

But I'm surprised, find difficult inderstand. see every day good proportion people ignoring safety guidance. Since summer, bars restsursnts filled, point begin avoid one main streets , always filled people moving around terraces, maskless, shouting pretty close....Many bars restaurants, despite pretend play victim now, part problem. Many ignored restrictions nothing implement safety measures, even less enforce them. 

Meanwhile, region cared getting enough tracers investing Healthcare system. Many people care, meeting different groups people every day, day without going bar. Mask mandates joke, hardly enforced. course people assure wear mask. Many forget mention wear nose, chin, arm ear. went dine couple e friends early summer, things seemed controlled. outdoors. middle dinner commented casually contact positive days . Apparently minor thing forgot mention advance. day, turned invitation, GF almost person social life, except volunteering.

 meantime president Madrid, posh girls never true job outside politics, though best time start power struggle central government. Today tomorrow, parliament going expend time discussing motion non cofidence presented far-right. gping go anywhere support frim parties, get air time message hate irrationality. Two days parliamentary sessions wasted, appatently pressing issues. could continue, I'll better end rant here

Our frivolity brought us ti point. Yokay, bandit. Stay safe. Prob numbers stupid high..... opened everything what‚Äôd think gonna happen Explanation: election 2 weeks. Haha. number times I've called idiot saying children probably catch spread it, like similar viruses. Gradually people beginning piece together... basically acts like coronavirus 'murica outsmarted virus. COVID-19 loving 'murica. ""Jesus replied: 'It also written, shall put Lord thy God test.'"" Matthew 4:7 assure time declared brain dead.

Are asserting article lying, mistaken? Gotta feel bad person. dumb luck received placebo. received vaccine he‚Äôd alive. Wait what? get numbers from? RKI reported 7595 today Yeah scientists journalists write type thing give crap us, mental health, whether actually necessary keep restrictions long. people ""we'll need time vaccine"" usually absolutely skin game lives/jobs affected NPIs, follow themselves. Imo like feeling power control get people enact measures. travel... hard yards opened tourism... literally seeded hard work done. tests less accurate eat before? ate 15 min mine wondering affect it? lot people area dont care public health, cases going ‚ÄúHe got placebo‚Äù....... suuuuuuure countries list? article behind paywall. Good thing covid low risk majority people. people wear masks

are people take vaccines Remember people called Angela Merkel mad predicting 19,000 daily cases Christmas? month ago looks like milestone reached early November awwww, thought 5G needed deliver Bill Gates-powered vaccine Elon Musk's NeuraLinks? issue immunity doesn‚Äôt last whole helluva long time, it‚Äôs respiratory virus, spread easily word? know media sensationalist. know vast majority people read headlines. article mention it, could put respirator, right? Bloomberg reported it.  far, there's indication flu season keep using word. think means think means. even read titles asking questions? always. 1st stage Human trials often include placebo group. given people deaths door already. least cancer.   Wow. whole point dogs better random chance, ""consumable"". dog sniff everyone refer get identified potentially positive testing. understant colleagues searching desperately meds help. seeing almost drug-repurposing efforts yield results think concentrate methodically sound studies instead things like that. Pretty scary numbers considering Northern Italy July, everyone wearing masks. Streets, train stations buildings directional walking signs. keep people mixing. cannot keep control, know can. hope Upper Marion follows (a short drive Philadelphia)  
I believe next week proof uneducated people today. School joke teach nothing. Good teachers teaching anymore treated poorly surprised simple science mask seen preventing people breathe. Interesting! never knew dogs detect different smells diseases . Probably another reason dogs popular among police sniffing jobs. Thanks info. miss dog *normal* Asia. regular day hardly ever see anybody wears one street. common *zero* here. Thank god. Cases spiking area. I'm getting vaccine hesitance everything. don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs w/ vaccine placebo, cares. headlines like confuse antivaxers Sounds 2020 me. Jethro thinks it‚Äôs safe go Disney World, right? packs family - Lurleen, Jethro Jr., Cletus - head Florida.

They grand ol‚Äô time, etc.

On way back, Jethro notices F-350 running low gas. Jethro, Lurleen, Jethro Jr., Cletus pile pickup truck stomp around gas station; unmasked, unwashed, knowing they‚Äôre infected not.

Jethro Jr. touching Payday bars snotty booger-hands. Cletus coughs stranger. Lurleen brays like donkey, kids durn cute misbehave public!

Yeah, dude. You‚Äôre right. could *possibly* go wrong? üôÑüôÑ false positive really issue here? dog identifies someone, give actual covid test confirm deny. Even giving false positives 80% time, would huge public settings. guy total piece shit. Florida still released numbers today, historically released 11am 12pm daily. appears maybe made good idea release less frequently.

The part understand every time pulls shit like this, makes look worse. politician, better know read room.

Edit spelling Correct, thanks adding - ""more 99%"" effective"" (according incredible think far vaccines come couple hundred years existence. suspect they'll go even lifetimes given medical/scientific advances. Antibodies always fade time, B-plasma cell die antibodies last 3 months. However also get B memory cells reside lymph nodes produce new response days rather 2 weeks, plus memory cells same.

Immunity based memory cells. Outright lies mean end Big Oil Big Tobacco. Randian ideal rational fair corporations whose products purchased rational consumers full knowledge products buy is... well... irrational. Yep, I'd reason we're 10% UK point. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs Unless choose ignorance apathy, bright side moment. 
Anyone thinks otherwise fooling themself. yes... sample size original hydroxychloroquine study. hand, promising first result. Wants breathe pathogens, like. 1% cases require hospitalization. need data based random selection people, include asymptomatic.

That feels inaccurate, especially since case fatality rate America 2.7%. Texas right reporting 115,000 active cases 4,500 hospitalizations 4% active cases. 

Regardless, study said young healthy participants 18% sick enough hospitalized, average age 44, 90% risk factors immigration multicultural

Lots Indian, Vietnam Ukrainians, yep. insular. European cross-continent traffic though Poland üòÇ Even many colleague/friends Poland foreigners. doctors experience help, yes work them... duh Welcome club.

I remote school atleast next fall. reason hard make flu vaccine effective made know strains going circulating winter. guessing game, years ""the flu shot fails"" (which overly simplistic, still gives immunity) ones dominated strain see coming. 

Influenza mutates fast. understanding, coronavirus lot slower. vaccine. commenting post given someone. done they're trialing it, thing really cant rush people wear masks seasonally Asia. like caught flu fear might catch something wear masks. Hardly body wears regular basis. sad. Truly martyr. Unlike orange POS.  necessarily sarcastic- pointing solutions west doomed fail start.

And app based solutions implemented various countries east successful- cost civil liberties.  regardless one's opinion this, west decided go route.

My personal opinion cell carrier phone OS vendor (along probably half dozen entities) already know I'm couple feet mind could use information tell I've exposed.  *much* bigger issue government able access data- one seems care enough legislate it. Flu tolerable deadly understand well enough quickly produce vaccine.

But something worse? Smallpox transferred cows humans agriculture. Imagine another disease like hitting humans. idea organization like CDC people look experts gain valuable information otherwise unavailable general people obtain. organization supposed ""LEAD"" becomes useless entity spewing crap like this, wonder people simply stop listening it. u die placebo?  I'm saying get passed, form, eventually. Democrats control, pass version it. alternative complete economic collapse, sides that. Remdesivir known effect likelyhood death simply shortens disease. known long time and, hence, considered possibility increase ICU availabilty.  cases started increasing second week September. unlike previous outbreaks, infections increasing across country. Hmmmm...if could identify event occurs uniformly across country late August/early September...

What reliability? Even 50%, would game change crowded public settings. likely death unrelated participated study, article:

 ""A source familiar matter told Reuters trial would suspended volunteer died received COVID-19 vaccine, suggesting person part control group given meningitis vaccine."" Lol, mortality rate bit higher flu vaccine. 

Its black plague fortunately. Even die covid necessarily negative implication vaccine.

Vaccines 100% effective. They're like firewalls block everything.

In fact, get vaccine, make SURE get good night sleep night studies show far less response. key preventing severe infection. Kids 3-5 times cell levels adults don‚Äôt get sick. also detect viral proteins, antibodies target spike proteins change time. Yeah, would think false positives, lack trained dogs problems pertaining practicality would issue. Man people sure fucking stupid US. 24 days, +2000 deaths, cases rise. still feeling confident? 331 million people less 3 days per person?


(Or math wrong?) 3600 new cases. ain‚Äôt dropping anymore. Fun fact, word comes old Italian word meaning forty days, long ports would make ships stay sea upon arrival spread plague point 210+k people died suffered died needlessly. wouldn‚Äôt callous probabilities family member dying, much sure.

The majority died early on, since extra precautions nursing group homes tapered off. additional case comes careless flouting known scientific mitigation guidelines exponential danger high risk patients. virus doesn‚Äôt discriminate. 

You seem impression stop wipe virus. cannot especially country big even delays infection, stop it. addition that, still don‚Äôt know long term effects even mildest cases, especially permanent lung, heart, organ damage.

So far low probability symptoms happen diseases well. 

This exactly unheard higher we'd expect.

Acting like big unknown looming threat fair assessment. tried reply twice, bot deleted posts. Another conversation bites dust. Soooo know may dumb question, still feel need ask. whole concept wear mask you‚Äôre ‚Äúmedically exempt‚Äù bullshit, right? testing backlog, ND numbers climbing like weeks. 

Watch graphic starting scroll ""where cases high staying high"" insane, slowing down. mid '90s, Fox River Mall Target got Milwaukee. place fucking legendary.

Edit: +Cinnabon Ireland lockdown. health system starting get overwhelmed. People cancer dying treatments postponed. Vital medical appointments cancelled. nothing death rate high low everything health system needing reset winter contact tracing system needing time get top things. ICUs filling point real risk car crash victims cardiac arrest patients beds. 

It's like society completely shut down. Schools childcare open, essential shops open, restaurants take away etc. one going run supplies, everything need still open.

Also, really compare famine? Man...wow. ‚Äúexcess deaths‚Äù also sight behold. Huh, poster child herd immunity EU isn‚Äôt faring well?  Oh man post nasal drip horrible feels like never ending. remember exactly started self conscious. 

Yep 4 weeks counting (oh thats weekly Covid tests: negative) tons dirty looks. far CDC 5700 deaths age group involving COVID (their words). deaths causes age group stand 117,748 year far. Looking random year, 2017, group 137,000. I'm trying figure math article maybe talking excess deaths maybe I'm looking things correctly. way refuse toilet paper people without masks, we'd 99% compliance without needing enforcement. True, interesting. question effectiveness masks guided reason, study anything convince either. shut business? COVID-19 patients Texas hospitals Tuesday, since 4,907 cases reported hospitals Aug. 26.

Also anyone wants see Texas‚Äô hospitalization numbers throughout pandemic, go following link click Texas. peaked 10,000 hospitalizations late July / early August. Texas definitely upward trajectory again. Things looking worse worse. Case numbers blowing up, hospitalizations hitting records multiple states. Several European countries going back lockdown. Prez calling scientists idiots telling us ignore virus. GDP way down, unemployment way up.

No stimulus deal.


I‚Äôm tired constant onslaught bad news. isn‚Äôt d0omer, literal reality.

Where vaccine? Where‚Äôs breakthrough treatment bring death rate zero? Where‚Äôs plan exit strategy ‚Äújust pretend nothing‚Äôs wrong go back normal‚Äù valid plan. Thanks! lost much respect WI. IN. MI. Midwest really. Yes 10000 times many infections reported

Everyone infected multiple timss already lot spots open ICU. Good luck getting big numbers Democrats polls midterm. we're it, let's deny people obesity, type 2 diabetes, certain type cancers attributed poor lifestyle, heart disease. Obviously people care lives treated bodies like dumpsters years end. choice work eat healthier it. Thanks. comment completely uncalled for.  evidence still get vaccinated anecdotal evidence. even says available scientists work directly it. Trumps treatment estimated 100s thousands paying pocket. eliminated rinderpest also. Granted, infect people. Well, we're already open much be. Opening means virus more. Opening less means happy less. . . . good gets, baby. Start loving it! real quarantine never took place. never anything support it. I‚Äôve seen that! Love it! Yep take extra precautions.

Everyone else fairly low risk unless something else puts higher risk.

See works? one size fits approach 1: right illegal aliens city's public services (shelters, food banks, etc.), meant **for citizens**.

Sanctuary cities unfortunately exist here, too, meanwhile people need legitimate Canadian residents waiting times access basic city services. disgusting.

Re 2: Newsom initially lauded firm handle crisis, heavily criticized sides political spectrum abruptly opening economy, leading huge spikes cases. He's flipped flopped position multiple times good leader. Don‚Äôt bother. people love pretend compassionate love sanctity human lives would rather see grandparents die alone sad shitposting internet someone dont like getting Covid.

I‚Äôve seen grandparents (98, 97, 88) times since March I‚Äôm grateful it. don‚Äôt long left they‚Äôd rather see family hide death, coming soon case. reddit, everything repost. it. even selective pressure virus cause server symptoms. likely self isolate thus shorter window infectiousness that‚Äôs $1,800 $1,900 net upper end non-college degreed jobs

That's upper end non-high school diploma jobs. plenty non-college degreed jobs pay far more.

Even improvements, Covid still much much higher death rate flu. good news reason get lax.

There's also caveat improvements due medical practitioners getting better treating Covid - hospitals get overwhelmed well apply anymore good experiment try smallish population. works, countries try it. See, masks don‚Äôt work.

Widespread poverty yet another symptom Covid. damn Covid, symptoms never cease amaze me! Bro real, miss hazard pay. missed day work since Nov, still taking care employees.

Also drug laws US aren‚Äôt enacted prevent people dying drug overdoses. That‚Äôs treatment programs for. They‚Äôre enacted voters‚Äô concerns people addicted drugs streets often least partially racially motivated fear they‚Äôll bring crime. don‚Äôt know news legalizing drugs, particularly non-lethal ones like marijuana.  Ahhhh...went School year 3 boys Grafton. disappointed discovered least 2 Trumpies. late 70's Grafton High Great FB Team, would hear several stories always Ambulances waiting several opponents gonna end Hospital, several got Scholarships Wisconsin play Badgers, I'd see guys Athletic Rooms, MEN...WOW...turns Steroids one else. Several ""All-Badger"" honors...it juice! Again, vaccinations stopped 1972 virus eradicated. I'm going say people still getting vaccinated rare one situations, vaccines arent what's holding back point time. one ""deserves"" anything, including pity. Still want get ""flu"", much less risk hospitalized, work, bill. ran platform ""I'm mini Trump!"" Yeah gotta love leave recovered cases dont take people case list die. Im sure active cases less 50k Also, BNO's detailed COVID reinfection tracker whoever wants follow far, time interval infections usually ranged 2-5 months.

For people reinfection symptoms worse second round, whereas milder others.

**This tracker officially includes genomically-confirmed reinfections**, also lists *suspected* reinfections (several hundred total Mexico, Brazil, Washington) timeline below. Good information, important people understand approach contagious disease changed centuries. far better prepared handle disease today.

But time, hate headlines read like ""COVID-19 currently 13th deadliest pandemic all-time world's history"". Downplayers deniers grasp straws anything like howl ""LOOK! FAKE PANDEMIC! BIG DEAL!"" without understanding context. COVID-19 ""only"" 13th deadliest pandemic time know fight pandemics now, mean let guard down. Canadians dress disease infested Americans Halloween. Wear lot red attend mock SC nomination announcements. ‚ÄúThis virus affects virtually one.‚Äù~ Fucking President United States. Apparently, even *he* one. this. 

We know virus fuckton better March/April. Accurate. running ICU beds huge portion state still care.

Fargo issued mandate, finally, one moron city commissioners went viral saying masks work. Fucking finally. dragging ass it. Moving goalposts?? say dont kill viruses. still exist. Smallpox exist far know, could possibly. still vaccinate keep samples labs reason. 

This virology 101. kill bacteria, dont kill viruses. mentioned someone else, impossible prove non existence something. functionally extinct viable specimin actually discovered permafrost, continue considered functionally extinct. disney stock, yup ! Yeah stupid Americans want see friends family Here's thing: COVID sweet spot. kill 90% people get it. spread really easily.

But far deadlier flu 'oh pass' viruses. got sweet spot burning fast killing many people dangerous enough. Holy South!! Liquor stores Windsor Locks started delivering began said hard keep demand love : Share population might better measure.

I even doubt covid-19 would even make history book happened hundred years ago, less 1% death rate (would lot higher without modern medicine, still high young healthy folks), mainly old people etc. People back much serious issues deal with.

That's say ignore covid-19 now, knowledge wealth gained, better people better. Remember consumption? world lives live with. cult chanting superman, made look strong. Implying seat belt instantly absolves world automobile deaths? That‚Äôs really math, it‚Äôs basic common sense/inability think critically. yesterday...today might now...tomorrow won't. Depends writing article. I‚Äôm fucking glad living Queensland right now.

Lockdowns work. Border closures work. Contact tracing works. Wearing masks works. 

I feel sorry people still deal this. excuse attend packed football stadium weekend go bar afterwards. reward get dealing virus properly. understand A? remember well since that's blood living country prioritize manufacturing n95 masks  help?

Colder weather game changer R0 went 1. ‚ÄúMonths‚Äù long time antibodies last. ‚ÄúYears‚Äù ‚Äúdecades‚Äù hoping here.

Countries need leading way:

* rapid testing
* specific clear lockdown levels
* fast accurate rolling lockdowns
* track trace

The evidence far shows COVID-19 spreads people breath droplets air. travel restrictions, PCR tests mandatory quarantine prevent infecting country. We've already seen working countries. crying united states :) issue schools behavior families activities perform outside school makes likely infected go school. Sadly sort families ones chose return person vs staying remote behavior may cause entire schools districts close/reopen 2 week intermittent basis every 2 positives per classroom considered outbreak am.

So far one HS one MS 2 weeks quarantine, went back person less 3 weeks ago. Half elementary schools district least 1 case (the whole classroom quarantines happens) 2, third within 2 weeks would mean entire school would go 2 week quarantine.

So far kids school one incident positive approaching 10 days since reported. sent back daughter 1st grade IEP remote terrible her, son 4th grade staying remote least til end second trimester. okay part case happen class would mean sister would quarantine even happen close contact her, increase chances stays person long possible.

Our district super careful 15 cases recorded district definitely infections school. 
A minority may ruin rest kids children like daughter. point taking every day gets attend bonus district wide closing certain number weeks looming heads cases increasing county...

This sarcasm. genuinely can't believe catch fallacy comment, must joking. Nobody wears masks work wife's work (except us). Mandates equal compliance, I'm sure live not, compliance mask wearing shoddy best. Standing outside now, masks mandatory, I'd say max 30% compliance glancing around, looking shop two employees masks around chin.

Basically, absolutely grounds assert anything effectiveness masks based mandates issued Czech Republic measurable effect. ELI5...why lockdowns work? basically imposing social distance people. suppose people follow lockdown work. 

I agree it'll hurt economy. lol emperor

thats God Emperor pleb did, said. putting words you.

""Firm"" kind relative term. What's firm cake might exactly firm concrete. someone admittedly ignorant thing they're talking about, yeah, stance pretty firm - least - firm right be. Brushing new information, even pursuit new information, say ""either way, still think silly"" absolutely digging heels in.

Imagine I'm lobbing beach balls you. Would make difference filled concrete instead air? number balls matters?

Is anything plan buying soon? Would still buy things died right now? falsely accused something I‚Äôm not, kind ask üëç ""save economy!"" economists care lost lives trauma.

&amp;#x200B;

and time, school legally responsible kid's well campus. cat owner would kill inside happened. 

No, no. cat. kills cat. This. live Washington County Sheriff's Department straight said would enforcing mask order nobody call someone wearing mask public. one fact (hospitalizations) gets attention, another (death rate) doesn't?  want people obey healthcare directives, give immediate pain so. 

Italians famous considering laws suggestions. So, strict lockdown knock transmission ASAP, fines jail sentences attached violating rules.

As example, one rule went grocery store, (only grocers pharmacies open time) didn‚Äôt buy groceries, could fined. store daughter frequents, also clothes, electronics, etc. 

Some guy went there, bought gaming system nothing else. fined cost system. 

Honestly, could bought loaf bread, too, OK. he, like many Americans, decided law didn‚Äôt apply special self. people social distancing anymore. extremely awkward difficult maintain.

That said, people still generally respectful towards pandemic guidelines live. Mask compliance high people generally also avoid crowding. Life pretty normal otherwise. late methinks. compliance seems voluntary right now. go grocery store, there's expectation wear mask maintain distance. social pressure. Yes, technically law places, police standing around everywhere handing tickets people. restrictions really legally enforced.

I think it'll mostly come policies businesses public spaces. choose keep things going 2021, well there's nothing anyone that. comply get kicked out. not, think see people taking masks get vaccinated, unless there's kind enormous social pressure persists beyond that. considering 58 passengers likely yet know infected flights, impressive encouraging.

Did go plane bathroom flight? many people sincerely keep masks alone airplane bathroom? quickly air bathroom ventilated ...?

the studies far consider infected passengers.

But infection vectors passengers, stewards/stewardesses. walking around, pushing carts, breathing deeply talking. talking. talking. plain boarding unboarding, ventilators also? often everyone plane crew tested? daily? every arrival?

Since crew members highest chances infected becoming infection vectors, wearing FFP2 FFP3 filtering masks, minimize risk.

It sufficient team crew tested regularly. crew members tested daily avoid bad luck false negative results.

Reason: false negative rate best average Good Canada, think? adapting mitigating realistic path forward humanity ""shutting down"" indefinitely hoping disappears. statistic remember, sure compares flu shot adults, amount infectious particles kid gets childhood vaccines less get playing backyard hour. make sense even subscribe silly conspiracies. virus could never originated WIV. could originated wild coronavirus. There's tiny probability wild sample brought WIV escaped, that's incredibly unlikely given prevalence wild betacoronavirii first place practically sensible ignore. Ah, thank you, makes much sense. head thinking tailors measuring people suits. Can't wait see debate Biden unfortunate reality already seeing rate new cases per day seen since PEAK July/summer. That's good sign, wave still feels early. Keep mind likely give priority high-risk groups get first reduce deaths MASSIVELY virus dangerous pre-vaccination. help ton easing many restrictions sure, require 7+ billion people vaccinated. Children health conditions might last line get vaccinated ever do. European mink, family Mustelidae include: weasels, badgers, otters, ferrets, martens, minks, wolverines, among others.

One bigger give moments posting Facebook picture van shuttling seniors grocery store *mid afternoon Saturday*. roundly excoriated it. What, want starve? No, want shop Tuesdays!

Every time go store come across folks clearly there's nothing else do. Mostly I‚Äôm concerned capacity limitations state. know resturant shop owners don‚Äôt know businesses make next year limitations placed them. That's people buy materials make masks, least wave one *the* national pastime. really tailors get exception, ""shops sell textile materials"". According JHU 10800 lot less 14-15k.

I found sources saying, less 10k today. 
What sources? one asked? yeah, main reason get fear getting covid flu time. Anecdotes aren‚Äôt data.

I 15 friends get virus perfectly fine today Anyone else back normal lives? 

I back normal I:

- work four five times week gyms reopened 

- eat week restaurant friends, usually cold
Beer cheeseburgers

- working two different jobs full time includes travel

- spending time friends, usually three nights week 

- watching football Derrick henry obliterate everything path. Notre Dame also looking good

- planning trip Ashland Oregon traveling gf

I live Phoenix. I‚Äôm pretty much back normal here. Biggest difference wear mask public. Otherwise things pretty chill. 

How guys? True, definetly want get time. big border though, Americans start showing up?  It'd interesting see progressive Canadians really are. people working places open ones going work. OOOOOF, feel like going barf reading IDGAF comments. seems committed hard way. Try telling someone PTSD, anxiety, claustrophobia etc wear mask. ""BS"". also conditions eczema masks cause severe irritation condition like that. Autistic people people syndrome may also find wearing mask extremely distressing. matter think. Let people choose whether wear based needs. decide them. Also really care Fauci live UK I've seen word taken others, regardless long he's profession. people qualified is.  consider socially economically liberal. However, party driven far left feel alienated. mention, don‚Äôt completely aligned one party candidate. see good Trump‚Äôs presidency like Obama‚Äôs potential Biden‚Äôs. see got links? thing see might weaken yor immune system brief time got flu shot body works it. every link I'm seeing warning dangers flu covid time. 7.6 million doses per day roughly 8 - 9 months vaccine people.

You could probably halve number pretty quickly adding whatever throughput we're going end getting AZN/J&amp;J/Moderna. all, that's bad all. First would cripple economy even second lockdowns really work. College wa great grad school way better. Imagine Russia China would deliberately infect people test vaccines. west would (rightly) immense ethical outrage it. Aimlessly walking around neighborhood maybe?

Jokes aside: hope lockdown intended effect government supply adequate relief lose needed income course it. 

Kind looks like we‚Äôre heading towards another lockdown Germany aswell. Whatever takes beat (or slow vaccine). Already looking forward next ski trip janske lazne! Whenever reasonable again. next year hopefully 2022 :)

Cheers neighbor! Stay safe. vaccine 80% effective, may still 1/5th infection chance

Is really binary? get infected infection lower chance severe? mean he's right? could zoomed funeral something. liberals want country put hold honestly rhetoric large gatherings funerals anything like that. think Italy went hard first lockdown, makes much harder impose restrictions now. government seems resigned. church indoor gathering since March, may vaccine.  cannot claim love neighbours things put lives risk. Globalization cause mess first place. Would nice could also leverage end it. Yeah, Twin Cities, mostly idiots think magically can‚Äôt give receive viral particles noses. 14,27 positivity rate. Italy testing much too! extreme? work? not? Canadian cheat code, things easier speak French Overall mortality Sweden far year nothing live near-constant sirens days. Why? Nobody seems know.

You're noticing more. time look reason 911 logs fire alarms usual. effect back April emotionally noticed sirens lot more. Yes. Sounds like they're saying FU political appointees. time. friend kids said taking trick treating kids bit bummed it. 

I told I'd daughter still kid - I've trick treat house. knocks door, open give candy, she'd run around house knock more. 

Each time I'd open door I'd mess different ways - wear different masks instead candy give soup potato. would inspire keep going see she'd get next. Maybe I'd even throw something special. cool gift something. 

""Sorry kid. I'm candy. tablet though. eat it. Now, get here.""

I like idea. kids fun, get exercise running around house bunch times, something they'll remember long time. 

## Abstract

&amp;#x200B;

As world‚Äôs economies come lockdown imposed COVID-19 pandemic, urgent need technologies mitigate COVID-19 transmission confined spaces buildings. feasibility study looks one technology, upper-room ultraviolet (UV) air disinfection, safely used humans present room space, already proven efficacy intervention inhibit transmission airborne diseases measles tuberculosis. Using published data various sources, shown SARS-CoV-2 virus, causative agent COVID-19, highly likely susceptible UV-C damage suspended air, UV susceptibility constant likely region 0.377‚Äì0.590 m2/J, similar aerosolised coronaviruses. such, UV-C flux required disinfect virus expected acceptable safe upper-room applications. analysis expected worst-case scenarios, efficacy upper-room UV-C approach reducing COVID-19 transmission confined spaces (with moderate sufficient ceiling height) demonstrated. Furthermore, shown SARS-CoV-2, possible achieve high equivalent air change rates using upper-room UV air disinfection, suggesting technology might particularly applicable poorly ventilated spaces. want everything open convince anti-science crew part. lockdown people can‚Äôt follow simple rules. 

Also live one states toughest lockdowns still pretty much free things. great summer enjoying outdoor festivals, visiting breweries, hiking, biking, camping trips, porch parties, eating out, etc.... limited lockdown mind? Movies? Concerts? Question: I‚Äôve got family members sharing reports ‚Äúpeople testing positive, without ever taking test‚Äù leaving testing center signing up. Seems super tin foil hat, pants head, conspiracy theory-ish. anything this, ive seen like 3 articles talked nothing anecdotal accounts. 

Could someone point good article summary either true/false/whatever. phone usage changed all.

My internet usage increased drastically. probably used 10 perfect monthly limit. sometimes 40 percent. Now?!?! Holy shit. Yeah totally affect chances long term effective vaccine timely manner.. Trump playing 4d chess.. gonna work great! Daily Beast published new report suggests Walt Disney World ‚Äúcovering up‚Äù underreporting COVID-19 cases among workers cast members.  spouses told Daily Beast Disney allowing people tested positive novel coronavirus return work despite dangers risks represents.  report includes number accounts employees ‚Äî spoke anonymity fear losing jobs ‚Äî talked park kept COVID-19 numbers wraps. referred video week ago :)

I see man fine taste You‚Äôre gonna speak up, I‚Äôm bit hard hearing 23 25 cases managed isolation border, fishermen single flight Moscow. fair. old world plagues absolutely disseminated populations time. Like 45% 60% everyone alive died result Black Death. losses plagues incomphrensiable us today.

In March people thought fatality rate COVID 4%. Even 4%, still able hold candle real plague. agree extent. don‚Äôt know number people get effects.

Another point restrictions INFLUENCED science based entirely science.

Sweeping policies effect every aspect life health implications. Corona one factor. factors include economy, mental health, risk tolerance, inherent value certain freedoms, even things domestic violence. 

Corona factor determine policy, Corona science voice follow. hilarious headline I've seen sub since Russian doctors erm, ""falling"" windows. Please let end Spring 2021... I'd move! Keep good fight, bruh. People unrealistic expectations virus go away ... like magic. Vaccine magic bullet - another tool. 

Also, love killing bearer bad news üòí   fun allowed 2020. Probably 2021 either. This. got things control Conte forced promise avoiding second total lockdown massive whallop first time, economy.

But looking like second lockdown completely unavoidable. reason people freaking fatigue. Hence Supply-Side Jesus. also case Stephen Miller got it. know able transmit humans. Bomb sniffing dogs retire early realize sooner later say ""bomb"" none order get treat  That's bit oversimplification issue, along removal couple key nuances. 

Lockdowns obviously work, logical self evident reality. COVID spreads person person due inhalation virus particles. people longer congregating outside homes, virus cannot continue spread. Thus, lockdowns work.

However, also self evident lockdown cannot persist indefinitely. would destroy economy, ruin enormous number lives, create hardships would last generations. answer never lockdown indefinitely. Let clear, **intentionally misconstrued straw man** right fabricated order make COVID prevention measures seem entirely untenable.

The answer always initial lockdown spike halt spread, greater breadth lockdown, better result. several weeks drastically reduced transmission, coming end high percentage mask use among public + common sense social distancing (standing 6ft apart line supermarket example).

I seen anyone realistically propose indefinite lockdown. That's talking point meant create opposition COVID prevention measures. public wore masks greater numbers correctly (not chin straps), coming lockdowns would significantly better shape.

Unfortunately, US countermeasures thoroughly half assed due baffling political ideological opposition. Ironically, created scenario another lockdown becoming necessary continue shoot foot.

Even [Wall understands importance halting spread virus, relatively simple common sense measures public take.

While initially Europe handled things better US, issues counter-ideology large %'s public taking seriously, they're paying price again.

This entire pandemic unfortunate example human nature working failing place trust individuals credentials meaningful opinion. Ridiculous. Close -- nobody needs car washed clothes dry cleaned. Image fast virus would human race self control collectivist attitude stay home two weeks. Give people weeks stock pantry close 99% everything. Fines jail time anyone caught outside house.

Everyone wearing masks stores, really even need someone standing door make sure happens. People it. Spokesperson apparently said volunteer placebo group, there‚Äôs pause they‚Äôre going full steam ahead. It‚Äôs tragedy, least know someone enrolled trial infected Covid-19. Feels like ages waiting happen. right, want people wear masks cold that's reasonable expectation. expecting become regular thing scale pandemic over? nah Johnston Johnston? 70+? responding example 85 yo... course 70+ would taken ICU needed. Europe, 70 years still relatively young. example, Madrid, worst point, denied ICU 80+. region, less beds per 100,000 people Madrid, worst point first wave, restricted access ICU 75+. Again, talking 85 yo example.

I need look sources, doctor Europe 10 years part hospital's multidisciplinary covid team since March 27th. I'm thinking. matter government says does, us people make sure wear masks practice social distancing. make difference.  lot ""news"" reporting press conferences derived press releases.

When studies released, they'll publish news story it.  would presume someone connected study sent press releases press kits media.

Don't afraid. We'll live rest lives. must adapt, we're frankly great job. Unidentified sources ones helped break watergate countless stories since wtf talking about? Check offshore bank account lol.

US also dangled $1billion carrot buy Huawei. Subsequent reporting indicates placebo group. Another piece news used anti vaxxers, despite fact person died got placebo Psychical? assume mean physical? 

The fiscal effects addressed government many, many options outside ‚Äúlet eat cake‚Äù aka ‚Äúopen economy it‚Äôs better alternative.‚Äù That‚Äôs false dichotomy largely perpetrated GOP. Scientists focus measured. There‚Äôs doubt psychological cost lockdown it‚Äôs impossible separate psychological stress lockdown psychological stress pandemic risk could catch deadly disease. There‚Äôs point trying. focus problem define. argument classic ‚Äúknowing unknowable‚Äù fallacy.

It‚Äôs nothing privilege everything quantitative science logical thinking. Old people, chronically ill people probably obese people spend enough time outdoors naturally produce Vitamin D. there's board that's specifically tasked regularly monitoring data safety. severe adverse reaction take place stemmed vaccine, trial would stopped immediately. encouraged contract covid trials? go life didn‚Äôt exist? Seems pointless board selfs home.

What took guts everyone trials. RIP bet subconsciously take risks administered trial vaccine/placebo. welcome hell, possible solution, still people keeps reproducing like rats, human egotistical nature. physician? it? Sure available stores maybe half capacity TP still 1 2 package limits. Disinfectants still well. I'm low case state people havent started repanic ""We lift-off!"" guys going straight moon.

*but... but... **Poland cannot space*** surely people idea talking know more? Every time hear argument COVID deniers skull doesn‚Äôt enough room amount eye rolling need Good. Last week moms best friend, anti-mask, shared news story claimed covid less deadly 1500 people died flu last year Czech Republic time ""only"" 1100 dead covid. Within single week managed get 1700 dead. people seriously need open eyes. would happy 4 weeks considering fast cases rising. ICU / Deaths... one problem argument... take account dramatic improvements treatments occurred since March/April.

Improvments hospital treatments?

If true still mean hospitals would still full, people would dying? Yeah. I‚Äôve allowed things, like seeing one two friends, bars, restaurants, theaters, theme parks, parties, table there‚Äôs vaccine me. Sucks, anxiety getting virus stronger desire recreational activities. people coming family support married Canadian.

The work route usually starts work visa later convert permeant.

Should easy get work visa land job prove local market there. Joe would get shit control two months tbh matter much mandated outdoors

Crowded bus stops, train terminals, markets, OK without masks. Also mandatory outdoors means people even masks maybe pull inside would solution? 

For example germany whole summer - mask except seated. simple can't solve masks.

Probably, know that. percentage game. start going hard stop small restrictions. small restrictions could prevent anything starting. original plan Yes massive holiday. largest outdoor gathering *of entire year* many suburban neighborhoods US. Everyone feel free click comments see defending Ivanka Trump length. lazy pathetic liar. anyone know look old daily threads?

I want look peak war zone April/early May Overruled political appointees.

Excellent doc streaming Hulu: ""Totally Control"". Really good job laying timeline explaining responsible poor decisions got us here. Heh. MN, everything open, restaurants open much reduced capacity. given that, example, people don‚Äôt put masks go restroom, don‚Äôt bother socially distance, lot restaurants investing propane heaters, lap robes roofs patties keep people coming in. really difficult. chose live campus year covid it‚Äôs even worse. I‚Äôm stuck house parents day every day without able make friends. I‚Äôm fortunate enough couple friends talk regularly, can‚Äôt make new ones. It‚Äôs also really difficult there‚Äôs people know blatantly disregard safety protocols (and asked say they‚Äôre ‚Äúbeing careful‚Äù they‚Äôre really not) cultural differences, can‚Äôt help envious point. They‚Äôre stupid going making friends stupid people ones making virus last long is. One person even said isolation 2 weeks one FIVE roommates got covid, day able leave back streets spreading god knows much. Despite that, still envy even making friends. It‚Äôs battle depression every day feel like I‚Äôm good enough make friends college even though know it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm following safety guidelines. still hate friends now. sucks big time freshman year. ones common sense healthy depressed ones without common sense sick happy. Thanks sharing. Glad end long term debilitating problems. impossible difficult. countries managed to, even though failed. feel like wont happen USA. needs to. drove hospital capacity Define survive :) Im anti masker think governments used way gain control population. It‚Äôs happening Argentina Wisconsonites come accross article Facebook they'll scream 'fake news' say 'stop lying us'. even joking. terrifying. ‚ÄúYou cannot force breathe carbon dioxide, lady. breathe oxygen,‚Äù Zarzano told Sarasota County school board standing podium provided speakers. ‚ÄúI want breathe oxygen. can‚Äôt cover mouth nose.‚Äù archived post non must believe Coronavirus plays king hill game, really bad case malicious compliance.

Game: Coronavirus team, must hold position 15 minutes infect nose. 14m 59s... 58s... wrong say still kill people? certainly kill anyone, young, healthy adults, difference covid flu near non-existent. People live. People need social interaction normality mental health. Condemning people what‚Äôs allowed government pushing responsibility onto people away governments mismanaged situation. Lock downs aren‚Äôt sustainable solution cause many deaths outside COVID. actually moved CZ MD couple months ago. shocked masks people took seriously. would excellent time put chips shorting stock markets, especially overinflated US market.

We can‚Äôt anything stop debacle odds (like 1929) well likely survive, even prosper. don‚Äôt one best infection rates cases sharply rise CO

[You're gold standard new cases per 100,000 14 day rolling basis pulled today. People traveling front range forest service fire closures, often places relaxed restrictions temps dropping.

Not that, *not* seen state plate, even quick runs Illegal Pete's. Stay safe!
 
Likewise! I‚Äôm productive child school taught person. got pretty easily honest friends well even ones without college degree ... secret, learn French :) another virus. üòÜ think beginning age pandemic get vaccine I‚Äôm popping mask off

Make sure understand efficacy numbers first balance acceptable risk. Even vaccine 80% effective, may still 1/5th infection chance. That's say nothing local viral spread community, social structure, considerations unique you.

It's magic bullet. say someone who's worked vaccines decade. gets almost time spans many years, covids less 1 year already making way chart. start buying? realize sound completely insane right? Uh, die. really unclear endgame? Yeah I'd imagine really varies. know siblings really struggle it, I'm done European visitors important us.
This site currently unavailable visitors European Economic Area work ensure data protected accordance applicable EU laws.

Translation: four years we've still done fuck all, actually care dingo's kidney European visitors. That, importantly, count training dog kind thing begin with. Even then, mean absolutely nothing late January, given next term begin January 20. 

Then time new policies put day 1 start showing effects. 

Realistically, Late February March timeframe would actually start seeing things turn around. Education universal human right. best 2 bad options unfortunately. Online learning pretty terrible hurts lower income families even worse. Rich kids get go private school, pod schools, tutors. Lower income kids even signing online class.  Thanks heads-up. Maybe give Abbott call? Ditto. good! live global world. want cover at-risk populations best reach 'normal' global economic activity. Pfizer global company.

With production numbers talking about, seem preventing folks US receiving vaccine required. Brace yourself... We're major cold snap potential first snows last week October [and mid much Northeast recognize masks bandage, solution?

So rather bandage bleed profusely? Yeah, love shut house like hermit fear disease won‚Äôt kill me. Make sure rotate stockpile though. Get every while, use older ones.  No, eat stuff like leave vegetables back years. I‚Äôm still optimistic pandemic mostly end next year. Fauci said vaccine likely officially public early Spring, reduce spread. Social distancing longer required. Masks probably stay enforced (not big deal though). East bit better, range everyone masked up. drive place Wisconsin recently, get gas stop anywhere surprised see mask anywhere WI. executive wants shut travel hotzone, call racist so?

Maybe actually quarantined returning americans citizens point. is, allowed virus come racist applying travel measures chibese citizens rather *all* people coming there. Bingo anyone know discrepancy 7 day average per 100k reported (17.3) vs metric reported (127 USA)? knows. people become 300% careless, might end getting 40% still susceptible infected short time span. 

And would quite bad well.

Sure, roughly levels caution today, right. vaccine change people behave. Omg, paranoia. Im teacher chicago. curious people know shake hands formal setting. already way out, speeded up.

Obvouisly that's going depend world. always experience Bangladesh COVID? Admittedly, know little health care Bangladesh curious. covid? infected spend everywhere go esp wear mask. Trump held meetings stuff infected, crowd people, without masks social distancing. literally textbook definition super spreader. crazy person think Trump magically immune? town sure, come house every year? get 100 kids most. Nice try, superintendent district. think guys forgetting people Krakow/Malopolska still believe smog coal/burning trash serious problem.... yet, also region religious population... guess ""god take care it"" taken literally pandemic well Nope. still attached wall cord.

I get 100% use phone too.

50% people call me, 50% call people. Also better treatment methods hardly matter longer available sufficient numbers. [This website](http://covid19.healthdata.org/poland?view=resource-use&amp;tab=trend&amp;resource=all_resources) tries predict development Pandemic. also predicts number required ICU beds compares number available ones. According current prediction Poland (as current example) run available ICU beds second half November. point probably even earlier people longer get best available treatment. Got thanks. following much since I've holed due company going work home. suck math numbers that's a&amp;#010;

Lose weight folks. Count calories. Eat less. *all* living like ""hermits"". Otherwise, end spreading virus among ourselves, causing third peak first wave. Europe: *mismanages second wave

America: hold crappy beer what? answer question

What differently NY?

I'm genuinely curious could realistically done. Everything closed streets absolutely empty months, extreme distancing 95%+ mask compliance. convinced virus run course. I'll try better next time Extra bc guy literally one functional lung last time checked Faith reason!

About 40% Americans live faith alone covid deniers denied door. save best mask plane. couple layers HEPA filters remove 99% particles,"" says. ""It's everyday mask. can't hang around neck. troublesome that.""

This would strategy if/when next fly. Break N95 I've squirrelling away toolbox. actually learned lot peoples' basic inability understand math last 6 months. pretty frightening.

What think chances 75 year old would need go hospital get Covid? car, yes. home, no.  going around world next 5 years....longer?

what end game here?

FRUSTRATING... Belarus. Possibly plausibly...

Ideally we'd one control school district students teachers tested weekly biweekly see many infected, symptomatic, asymptomatic given time.

Next, we'd need robust nationwide system contact tracers follow patterns virus spreading.

As far know moment, either capacity make conclusions one way another. 

Anecdotally, NJ daily cases control summer 200-400 cases day 3 weeks schools partially fully reopened. We're back 800-1200 cases day range now. Either destroy society go concerts hang bar. Hang concerts bars destroy society. Doesn‚Äôt seem like much choice. Bars close. It‚Äôs big deal, compared damage caused letting virus run rampant throughout population. trump thinks pandemics basically over, open country! think large county like us, especially county institutions higher education folks \[are\] coming outside county outside state, think it‚Äôs going hard achieve yellow tier,‚Äù said Chau.

SF shut March, LA Marathon.

OC mask protests, SF doesn't

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It‚Äôs exact situation Irelans you‚Äôre actually offended anything anyone says sub need leave bit. gosh shock ignore scientists usually get flu vaccine, year yes I'm wearing mask outside home car. Great argument. rest world stop washing hands. Sweden proved washing hands prevent corona /s.

Mask mandates save lives. That's countries Sweden them. Sweden started lockdowns South Korea did, Spain finally did. Damn, Canada getting any. comments mention first reason, thanks adding second virus infectious unlikely first generation vaccines effective enough prevent epidemic even 100% population vaccinated. Secret agent CCP, presume? Training. takes time train dog pay attention smell want find rather smells interested firms it. 

It thing instantly do. First funding spend good bit time training enough dog trainers good bit time training dogs.

In word ""infrastructure"" there. I'm planning go back Sweden start studies winter. wonder plan restrictions winter? We're confused delaying visit, delayed several times already due early lockdowns home country later summer vacation Sweden. Wish countries could decide next couple months ASAP. want go stay home. Source people risk developing diabetes? Lowering population end? capitalist machine perpetually demands \*more\* consumers sustain itself, less Yes, first result google uk covid testing Probably protected least booster. That's bad idea want get sick. waste vaccine going reckless fully protected sounds like amazingly useful test.

It much beyond current PCR test. What's really inexplicable current PCR tests labs report cycle threshold, proxy viral load. viral load new test reports, even though similar data already available today's PCR test simply used... reason.

This test distinguish replication-competent virus RNA fragments can't infect, really add much high viral loads correspond replication-competent virus infectious vice versa.  words, viral load really what's important determining infectiousness. viral load small, matter replication-competent can't infect people viral loads low *even if* replication-competent.

tl;dr test add much beyond PCR testing *already does,* reason labs around world report viral load estimate PCR testing based cycle threshold detection. Placebos exist trials. point act control (think high school science writing experimental designs). need compare results something see thing tested, case vaccine, produced different results absence vaccine."
