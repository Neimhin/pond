Every nonsensical knee jerk (travel bans, lockdowns, stay home orders, closing school/business) reaction borderline insanity. Yeah. live Md Italian places excellent cheesesteaks.

""Enjoy America, enjoy..."" definitely makes sound like schadenfreude believing first sentence true. remember telling son’s teacher back March would kind fun school close week. think lot. six million Americans diagnosed coronavirus healthy, would still 180K+ deaths?

Its JOKE. say can't switch person, spots full. 3 days week 1st graders done 11am. 4 weeks, single sight word, spelling word, grammar lesson. get 1 reading group sessions kids go around taking turns reading one sentence book...

My kindergartner gets 2 15 min live lessons pre-recoeded videos...it's nightmare....

I hired advocate fight us... Wait numbers Biden’s election win. team show true extent damage done shitty administration. lived Brownsville, Texas life. Nearly anyone discussed would tell would get teeth taken care Mexican dentists, 5 minutes car crossing border, 20-minute drive suburbs.

Dentists, particular, seemed like greatest beneficiaries discrepancy medical costs countries.

My dentist Mexico, several patients purely English-speaking. bilingual ALWAYS packed office. everything related dentistry relatively small commercial building.

That 15 years ago still amazed busy was, means exception. make plenty money, wonderful husband, happy constructive friends, ability learn others listen perspectives.

Thank yours. need luck though, work hard happiness.   Chronic lower respiratory diseases respiratory diseases noted 20,000. talking about? COVID... directly causes pneumonia respiratory failure... think died non-covid respiratory failure despite Covid? 

If so, would assume death certs listed covid actually Covid deaths, whole thing people dying causes also infected Covid? Covid kill without comorbidities, certs list them. true 90% covid deaths elderly people pre-existing health conditions? get whole lot worse flu season schools opening started told 1-3 million Americans could go. Isn’t 200k less million? say I’m dumb maybe great numbers aren’t cash drugs. Trump Pence trying push political gain. They’re gonna fuck too. Rushing out, even appearance rushing surefire way instill doubt safety vaccine keep people taking it. Good you. moved new city middle pandemic know nobody within twenty years age outside work. I'll take get.

FWIW I'd rather hate people interact every day maybe that's me. can't help time. started countries back, think Brazil South Africa I’m wrong. don’t seem understand, it’s afraid. It’s spreading disease dire consequences healthcare system economy. mention people exposed attend. 20% likely hospitalized long lasting, possibly permanent health issues. die. Sad see events like important. First really. Community seen less 100 cases happened. ""weakling probably never picked ball climbed tree""... talking messiah? It’s eight hoot wait it’s still open. thought happened months ago? would mean getting news one place thinking critically things. Sadly many well equipped that. Nazi Communist? sadness sub must feel US #1 Alright, higher lower? imply members government feel way ridiculous.

it's fair say anyone resigned spoken science self serving personal wellbeing/employment. fuck them. Hi everyone im 20 got very, sick 2 days January traveled NC back New York City. worst body ache ever had, throat hurt, tried hard take cold shower cool body down. 

I went doctor said flu like symptoms prescribed optional medicine. think took didn’t much popped Aleves began feel better throughout night. 

I college student btw around tons people well. I’m healthy time used workout regularly. last time sick feel like could’ve covid strong flu idk. I’ve around many people since moved back home New York feel fine. 

I go back New York tomorrow get belongings dorm. think may developed stronger immune defense? love ya, parental figure! shit... always point. still trying utilize whataboutism talk disease happened 100 years ago many possible sources (including China -- ) distract focus talking disease still killing people know **know** orginated China **know** CCP lied about. course house panel would say - democrats all! That's also compounded conditions like COPD pulmonary edema extremely common causes death without Covid involvement.
Edit: yeah, common respiratory diseases. Also, pence oddly long thumb. Bush never rehabilitated among people know wrong lie start war. Please stop getting news unreliable sources. far right hurts. Time call Bill Gates, heard he's making implantable microchips Windows 2000 preloaded. Republicans\* case know, /r/the_donald buddies went /r/trump. Subs prefixed actual- true- tend trump dick suckers, fit right in. Northeast south midwest. definitely gonna burn us all. I’m trying say you’re making big leap say entire third country believes even cares Canadians handling virus. think one cannot grasp judging you’re saying. Also don’t think father brothers experiences count personal life experiences projection nothing compared WIV claim, projection century lol yet, are, continuing reply, swinging missing (the point). Oh God! horrific new information! beside myself... 2022. Taking right 1918 playbook. tough even finding news articles spanish flu insane censorship back then. That's then. data. they?

I think ""We're 100% sure whether wearing mask enough help prevent spread COVID-19, worry get new evidence.""

Yeah, masks help airborne viruses, COVID-19 pretty new. There's chance helped all, better let medical staff masks need things *other* *just* COVID-19, rather getting everyone panic buy something 100% sure anyway.

I think people jump quickly whole conspiracy thing really, NEW virus. We're still finding things people need remember: Science changes views based what's observed. took new observations, new evidence wearing mask definitely help.

SciShow good video one brainwashed path saying lockdowns don’t work.

That said. someone falsely accusing others comprehending, pretty piss-poor job yourself. say lockdowns work. record, *don't* work well, that's said. said come cost proponents need start owning want seem credible. articles bears out.

You may ""not want hear fucking excuses"" people starving death, matter. Facts facts. People need food live. real world, absent global altruistic effort share abundant resources, means need money, means need jobs. last two start drying up, people starve death. agree humanity better job avoiding this, that's world works. even best, prosperous times. Hell, Americans even care enough *their citizens* ensure adequate food, healthcare, even clean water. Earth makes think they're going move mountains ensure bunch people Malawi get three square meals day?

Acknowledging world work better, lockdowns *shouldn't* kind effect underprivileged, absolve owning consequences lockdowns *are* real world. Yeah, see essentially three categories contributing factors (I’m going use super layman’s terms cause fun):

1- covid def you.. think respiratory distress

2- hell know covid might done you... like heart attack

3- shouldn’t gotten covid cause already something bad... like diabetes

Without grouping removing top 2, it’s really hard know covid’s exact role fatality retarded? got promised. big one, COVID. going prove get work documented jobsite risk? There's precedent burden proof pandemic situation. 
 insurance company would difficult time trying prove got elsewhere. They'd show something like, say, grocery store certain time certain date 12 people got infected time. maybe showing screenshots Instagram profile, uploaded pictures party possible incubation time. Even then, documentation exposed four Covid-19 patients per day 10 14 days prior symptom onset would probably carry weight. 
Plus, civil matter, burden proof high criminal court, prove ""more likely not"" caught work. 51% chance.  

For part, want save much money can, paying little get away with. starts denying many claims first time around percentage people fight it. they'll sort ones worth taking court ones not. 

Unless DeSantis settles first, he's insurance company's side, probably best people fight get waives liability. Challenge accepted Irony skeptical cases people died car accidents gun shot wounds test posthumously Covid offices label covid deaths. big reason death certificate matching led manipulations sides spectrum heated debates dying ""from"" vs dying ""with"" Covid.

You know Hitler Goebbels pioneered whole ""fake news"" thing WW2 right? 

Continually discredit sources rather news itself. hey, look well working you! Trump lying?

Until elementary students undergo massive hormonal shifts, mood swings, extreme social drives, enough independence live/party peers, may resign simply spreaders. that's plenty dangerous enough. heard Russian vaccine tested friendly countries Venezuela. good size test population. tell me. Wen't I'm one believing models predict 100 years future. making continental-wide policies pressuring foreign governments based ""scientific"" profecies hold value. Climate Change one dumbest things displeasure seeing lifetime. European (led Merkel) nuts ones taking meds. getting them, since probably already taking it. Fair enough, thanks explanation. stop testing follow immediately preliminary date becomes available. likely idea well poorly vaccine working next months enough subjects exposed virus even though study continue even preliminary data available. assume excess deaths corona? evidence that.

Also countries locked mean ""spreading unchecked""? governments introduced strong counter measures early. course COVID-19 death.

Even people severe underlying conditions, already death bed, would anything else?

If stage 4 pancreatic cancer 6 months live, guy breaks house chops head samurai sword, doubt anyone's going say ""well think count death-by-samurai-sword tally gonna die anyway"". Maybe meddle make countries shitholes leave.

But then, good Christian would welcome Lord commands to. He'd invited speak RNC! mean everyone went inside 30 days would gone. I’m saying it’s practical. it’s possible Let's hope us wither... background testing child enters school. before? Sounds like chance someone motivation make copper / silver infused reusable bags. military uses something similar underwear help cut bacteria nasties build underwear hike 15 miles desert. Good lord. imagine sad life assign value age reddit account?? 😂 Duh, course Young people can't die mean young people can't get long-term weird shit  said something ""containing campus""? Containing context mean keeping one place. means slow down, flatten curve, keep control much possible whereever appears, isolate/quarantine infected people etc etc. That... actually less reassuring. :( Can't wear oxygen mask chin! also works it’s effective enough. won’t really know enough people take see results. Misinformation? joke? Good! wrote nothing mass murder. 

You started nowhere talking mass murder. corrected explaining corona death rate 0,5 %.

Idk talk mass murder.  Attributed lower temperatures humidity, mention made reduced sterilization UV radiation, reach ground winter. might even bigger factor. safer ever learning past failures made system safer.

What if, rush, wait normal safety checks procedures? first person get plane production line ground gets Nobel Prize fame incentive rush? Thank you, happy cake day Exactly. Plus people already (at least short term) immunity help too. 

I think people take vaccine shown safe long term (3, 6+ months.) can't blame people wanting first take something new. hope time people open it.  living away parents grandparents, segregated campuses tested regularly. told that's pretty good set up. know avoid grandparents time being. Means can't even back statements bullshit.  Arizona scary place right [...] testing rate plateaued never expanded  

What? Testing expanded, blatant lie. testing sites across valley, people going. There's MASSIVE one street always empty. Interpret will, say testing expanded blatantly wrong. 

And please look AZ's hospitalization data: 

Current COVID inpatients: 729 
Peak COVID inpatients: 3,517 (July 13th) 

Current COVID ICU beds use: 253 
Peak COVID ICU beds use: 970 (July 13th) 

Current ventilators use: 150 
Peak ventilator usage: 687 (July 16th) 

June mid-July AZ absolute hell seeing 25% positive rates tests. September 1st seeing predictable bell curve make downward fall. 

[All info directly state's health 

Also, two statements make comment contradictory: Life back business usual here, streets stores packed  We're also entering winter; time Arizonans start leaving homes again. self isolate summer anyway escape 115+ degree temperatures 

So, Arizonans self-isolating, also back business usual stores packed. Yeah make sense. need try make sound scary. Yes, people things, they're wearing masks them. rare come across business mask mandate top city/county mandate(s). 

And, I'm sure even live AZ point fall/winter Arizonans tons shit outdoors. Summer seek shelter heat, probably coincidence saw worst numbers middle oppressive heat. anything, winter/fall reprieve Arizonans able outdoor activities spread far less likely. 

Your comment comes fear mongering. Leaving house terrifying excursion Arizona things objectively better state 6+ weeks ago. College Liberal Arts. becoming increasingly clear lockdowns harm good.

Lol. Never mind countries actually resumed nearly normal life got virus control. US hadn’t half-assed lockdown, could one them. cares? heard ""no-reusable-bag"" thing last week, visiting parents another city. using bags self-checkouts since pre-corona. always bring bags. rarely interact cashiers. Nobody ever hassled me. go maybe 5 different stores street, one national chain supermarket. seen zero sign saying bring bags also rarely read signs. idk whats that. think maybe like ""personal choice"" rule (not mandated law) areas jumped idea kind like meme safety? died risky underlying condition. 

Like, advanced liver disease via lifetime drinking drunk manage contract COVID die, die of?

If 97 die respiratory failure hospital, COVID kill you? 97 years planet kill you? read CDC report. parrot misinformation fits ""pre-existing"" world view. Yep. good contact tracing 🙃 fact matter people know percentage type herd immunity several places across world showing signs some.

Not sure bothers you, actually good news. vaccines higher hurdle jump since administered healthy population thus must higher standard safety

Yes, also make big deal safety efficacy.

If safe, honestly give 2 fucks whether works 100% time not. millions risk people would gladly take vaccine 50% effective. that, instead waiting 100% effective vaccine, would save tens thousands lives keep hundreds thousands hospital.

This hard choice. Take meds mass outbreak ultraconservative/anti-government church. Although dozens church members already diagnosed COVID-19, pressed ahead participated anti-government rallies Seoul Aug. 15, ignoring health authorities' warnings.

Lots church members participants rallies believe conspiracy theory government would fabricate 'positive' test results supress anti-government movement refusing get test cooperate health authorities.

Now cases linked church alone surpassed one thousand cases. guy probably regrets born there. wearing mask, partying, contracting disease, giving middle finger contract tracers going around positive test result non-issue here. Okay deaths avoidable? governor dumbass. literally never said lockdown everyone. even once. suggested something, asked would work. dodged question. 

Everyone clearly see that.


You've redditor 8 days lol telling need thicker skin want hang lmao. 8 days. definition troll. Get life. Yea, people want immediate switch M4A understand this. can't happen without destroying livelihoods millions people.  I'm FL people generally pretty good it. People spaced everyone wearing masks businesses. Restaurants spaced tables outdoor whenever possible.

Yeah, that's one favorites.

I’m hardly anti-vaxxer stretch imagination, admit trust level every American agency time low. FDA pushes early vaccine, I’m prone say “hmmmm...let’s wait see Canada does.” ""COVID Death"" invoked cert? Seems like lot people severe underlying conditions COVID tips edge. Hang on, hold everything.

I heard *pretty reputable source* kids ""practically immune"" Covid.

This got fake news.

/s DeSantis won't. He's piece shit. love finding reality decent lockdown shutdown businesses doesn’t enough curb spread own. California shut March and, despite weeks month businesses operating limited ways, we’ve pretty much nothing going here. indoor dining, indoor activities except shopping food, outdoor gatherings, nothing. 

And yet cases rose fell like Florida, Texas states. It’s almost like human behavior important strong leadership. Yeah use shutting entire state one county issues. bad cases spread tracking mess. Also lil' blowup, along South Dakota. feel like gaslit society. March/April honestly supported shutdowns (though ALWAYS said needed temporary, like 1-2 months MAX temporary). still support masks public indoor spaces. March literally thought death rate [was [the current CDC IFR estimate Further, [More 40% U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Linked Nursing proves deaths due failure properly protect nursing homes policy PPE, large threat general population large. age 65 [between 90 630 times higher chance death (increases someone 20s. median age US [just 80, 78 (as July median age death [Ireland 92% 65.

Further, told repeatedly goal **flatten curve** keep healthcare systems becoming overwhelmed. We've done that. curve flat months now, aside weeks NYC Italy I've never heard hospitals running beds. I've never seen pictures bodies piling streets.

It September. 6 months. data paints clear picture. told covid much, much serious threat turned be. get wrong, real virus. taking **reasonable precautions** **limit** spread. expectation everyone needs continue strictly isolate widespread vaccine community spread bonkers. mindset must treat every person earth contagious nuts. can't expected live like this. reasonable.

Also GOT COVID exactly Capt. Sanitation there. way more.. every single kid goes parting hosting large pool parties, gatherings etc *know* leasing vehicle completely different process can't believe right bad actually arguing this. Nobody said immune, overwhelming majority get sick fine. amount alarmism change reality. HIT different ""herd immunity""

No HIT simply Herd Immunity Threshold. applies population primary means transmission contact transmission. Dense slums simply feature uncommon mode transmission leads large overshoot. Notice non-slum areas Mumbai much lower prevalence, closer New York Stockholm.

The ""immunity continues"" form sustained antibodies. interpretation earlier shorter studies saw antibodies waning would disappear months. longer study shows initial peak, contraction phase i.e. waning, contraction phase stops antibodies persist lower level. kinetics study around time prolonged observation study estimates serum antibodies detectable 42 months. Agreed. 

These people idea viruses work begin with.

They probably understand even influenza 50% people infects completely asymptomatic yet fully contagious, rates less severe viral infections like common cold causing rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses even fully known yet.

They understand get data claim ""need"" believe contagiousness children involves months testing, reporting, analyzing data thoroughly controlled settings avoid exposure variables might contaminate data.

On side note, one thing concerns Covid around long enough know certain kind permanent effects even mild/ asymptomatic cases Covid children younger adults might lungs, hearts, cardiovascular systems, organs systems. No. Charles Entertainment Cheese essential employee. feel like people still don’t get this. It’s hard. course. I’m saying weddings make Covid immune. play numbers. county like 3.5%-4% positive rate.

That's get unending headache. infection causes brain inflammation.

But then, anyone half brain would know viral infections commonly cause encephalitis, especially upper respiratory infections, fogginess lethargy common side effects. wondering shit actually made Fox News thought wouldn’t even able pass sniff test.  no, apparently people dumb. sarcasm one asking ""lockdown."" They're asking someone CONTROL VIRUS, maybe contact trace close high-risk places. Jfc. Colleges COVID-19 national championship. High score gets trophy. talking two different things

Gotcha. comment producing vaccine ahead time responded course going produce vaccine trials completed. would waste months time could use actually manufacturing vaccine? decide later, looking data, keeper garbage.

I guess responded thinking saying think trials necessary approval. clarify, comment all. Try example him. 

""You're saying person dies COVID infection also another medical condition really die COVID, died condition?"" 

""Yes."" 

""OK. someone stabbed heart, would murder?"" 

""Of course."" 

""Great. already high blood pressure someone stabbed heart, would still murder?"" 

His argument would suggest that's murder, die stabbing, died preexisting condition. ok, title though agree vigilante justice, understand desire. seemed like minor thing. caused lot suffering lot people.

It's kind always reign get stuck bad traffic. always find hoping person wrecked car hurt... realizing thought hoping they're OK. moment make mad, end day mostly hope something stupid like texting driving, they're hurt enough learn never again. known quite young people face much smaller, non-zero, risk dying get covid.

The issue young people problem adjusting behavior leads spreading covid populations *not* negligible risk dying. also okay go around spreading influenza. matter made sick. want it. Stay home sick way, island nation immediately locked down, ramped testing, got back around virus second time. 

You can't say we've barely tried say impossible. dunno, kinda expected Trump bungle 100% saw he'd done CDC. Still waiting 1 might lost health insurance heart attack 188,000, give take. insurance always cover everything that's necessary. gonna happen. Probably great idea cancel it.

Also like see sources stating state kicking results back. seen one yet. normal flu would fine

While understand sentiment, also think mentality helped contribute getting us now. 

Early comparisons COVID Flu large part disinformation campaign around COVID-19 started. strange, FLU even vaccines still extremely problematic/dangerous every single year [puts lot burden flu, stay home. employers want stay home. Schools want children stay home. Seriously, people sick contagion [be encouraged to] stay home. look number cases really need know biggest part epidemic Sweden, testing extremely limited performed severe symptoms cases health care staff. draw conclusions total numbers - end May (when deaths happened) 38664 confirmed cases. testing capacity test massively (after 1/6 lot regions opened month June people mild symptoms test well Stockholm region also people symptoms could test) early on, things would much different. 22,000 season tickets renewed 2020 given priority. Close enough. much pent demand live football tickets game hundreds dollars four figures secondary market. I’m sure you’re capable, qualified person, don’t know what’s best everyone, everywhere. 

I’m northeast state well. risk low. changes, would support another shutdown. ever lost job hard died? Parents send sick kids school often choice. parents, whether 1 2 parent homes, daycare second costly expense next rent. 

It's also condemned corporate world part take sick days kid, wish keep job climb social ladder. Even understanding places 5-7 sick days year. One kid use one sick episode, never mind children.

I remember arguments ex would least likely get fired one year two kids kept passing something back forth. 

So take already strained situation, mix coronavirus. coronavirus, many cases, state and/or federal administration partially locked down, skipped steps opening economically socially, failed provide parents options regard financial pressure.

You thoroughly deal virus FIRST - worry reopening. Everything (in several states) taken place terms virus spikes forecasted experts, cases, ignored politicians. 

You may well beg virus-laden children school. Possibly. might good idea places distance can't kept. work Connecticut we've people written coming work awaiting test results. people fucking care Sir, Wendy's can't afford hospital stay, matter shape angle curve.

Lol People always leaving california. There's 40 million people here. 

And probably better now, medium-long term. Maybe housing prices drop. 

But lot people want move here. vicious cycle. lol exactly thought of. still want us talk freely permanent chronic conditions recovery. true deaths mostly older people, though younger immune. saving grandma reason careful. Even live, might bad shape. Grandma dies, live can't go stairs anymore. That's scary thing talk about. Correct, that’s I’m stating won’t see second waves place like northeast response. Philly getting indoor dining back 8th (been shutdown since pandemic began). Pittsburgh saw uptick bars closed could get bad. see slight bump PA’s numbers nothing close March/April. "" fought other. Don’t believe didn’t. "" Yes, anti-maskers, entitled karens, believed completely pointless lockdown.

"" totalitarian control surveillance shut dissent there. "" Well, yes, thought meant fighting way fought other. state vs everyone there; here. Course, one's bigger here... think.

"" even individual towns villages erecting homemade barricades keep anyone coming out. "" enforcing prop guandaos! (Probably humor's sake) government lock village, villagers apparently.

 

"" targeted anyone Wuhan even hadn’t lived years. "" Cue moment police two separate provinces fought other.

 

The second example individual initiative part villages; second standard phobias playing reaching somewhat hillarious climax. also 'shut down' really. vaccinate go back original late march style social distancing point, good control achieved masking, social distancing avoiding indoors teach anything deserve happens them. coincidence! Republican! think vaccine ""properly vetted"" historical standards like 2024. So, mind, mad rich people ""are"" gonna get vaccine first, happy test we're afraid happens take it?

A vaccine approved October:

- readily available much anyone reading comment like January anyway

- two less months research behind whatever willing take March anyway

- serious side effects vast majority people, otherwise testing anyway

- Even *as* effective later vaccines (and certainly be), still help incrementally, like masks much anyway

So, again, ""this vaccine ready, dangerous!"" ""Damn rich people! can't get vaccine first!"" two mutually exclusive temper tantrums. possible neither true anyway, ***pick one***. It’s 10 days period, it’s concurrent it’s cumulative.

Imagine kid gets one cases causes stunts development permanent damage, inevitably going happen this. sad situation see people buy safe kids go act like pandemic, kids going spread around country. also really sad shit see people think understand science better literal expert topic. virus willful ignorance/Dunning Kruger infecting world Deviation average normal. 2018 nobody wanted lock us despite even worse death rates. response future deathrate average ? That's means, though.

The guidance given ""healthcare workers"" section specifically guidance *for healthcare workers get tested*.

It's like, healthcare worker want know advising patients, guidance follow. aware total number.

It’s big jump local reporting previously seen, first case. Yep. Wife teacher, district opening hybrid based two week old numbers even though current third party numbers say online. 

State’s data two weeks old people might die. Jesus hell. can’t understand school administrators hard headed inflexible. U.S. can, will, is.  won’t sufficient. don’t get paid enough put Covid children. 

Do televised learning remote learning both. Save lives educate. 1) Deaths lag behind positive cases
2) staff ones likely die rather college aged kids. 

Also, people die mean lasting health issues them. Let young people get virus still good strategy know long term effects. True, 84.5k cases x 33 almost 2.8m. Still less half country. Going rate. 

Hopefully going forward country take strict measures better combat virus. 

Meanwhile one trumps advisers pushing herd immunity would kill millions virus alone, let alone side effects, etc. people die idea infected total country. 

God hope don’t follow it. haven’t even proven people get immune it. taiwan  Things like shutting businesses, causing people lose jobs, causing people lose access health care, stuff. Twitter deleted it. retweet anonymous conspiracy group's require proof Covid vaccination attending concerts, sporting events, plane rides, etc. give people incentive take vaccine. flu put 10 days easy. NC DHHS tracks number cases reports weekly [COVID surveillance 25 cases total since start pandemic, recent jump, though 11 month August. 1 kindergartener America?! Better shut country kid’s school allow in-person learner go distance learning time, can’t go way, they’ve switched, that’s semester. 

They’ve also set kid watching classes real time Zoom teacher lecturing in-person distance learners time, another teacher moderator relay questions lecturer. Unfortunately, since they’re 6th graders, apparently can’t trusted in-app chat, part gets little sticky sometimes, overall, it’s working okay. 

And school hasn’t positive cases yet, week 3. So, we’ll see. US making vaccine political tool may reverberate nations making vaccine moot get IEP unwilling let son severe epilepsy stay home seizures getting ready school morning. forced bring anyway (multiple times, mind you) wanna know happened later?

He seizure class. never one. duh.


After IEP approved place, stopped sending day starts giant violent seizure. 

Kid broke arm seizing month ago :/ Maybe immune systems good, understand people missing 10 days semester. stay home feel even little sick I've missed sick year like 5. That's perspective I'm operating under. difference feel number like 9%.

You seem find acceptably low. find alarmingly high. high would number need us overdoing it? nationalinterest.org may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* whole assumption behind WEARING MASKS assume sick. Tests back ASSUMING someone sick sending school. population density sweden considerably lower nations

that misleading. swedes live cities. ton uninhabited open space. majority safety data phase 3. Phase 1 tiny sample size across demographics. phase 3 people age 55, instance.

We need safety efficacy information phase 3. Build walls keep us out! Fuck us Americans! customer mine sent four kids school week PA. Three different schools. youngest spiked fever kept home, called school, called doctor asked test. told get test fever. now... wait? Meanwhile three kids continue going school face write ups. 

It's disaster, like watching speeding train come way setting tea party tracks assuming stop. wonder long they'll hang onto idea Iron Bowl still happening. can’t even get folks wear masks. Shutting certain venues banning large public gatherings point take called it: “reasonable precautions limit spread.” general public shown won’t own, sometimes save people enforce closures them. life won’t go back normal time soon.

Look, bunch countries wore masks socially distanced already past this. Coronavirus them. don’t like playing rules we’ve barely even begun. science behind statement? doesn’t sound like real thing, I’m open educated. two links wired article guess undo dozens studies published August contrary these

I worked Harvard briefly worked plenty people MIT Harvard foray Boston. fact, often looked types analyses, job. Pretty cool, huh?

I've arguing people like you, understanding situation, entire pandemic never wrong. I've said need shut fully, got argued against. said need wear masks, told work. another one hundred+ things I've argued online people like ignore look back months say obvious. gaslighted thinking convoluted situation understand (to layperson like yourself).

Maybe look ""news"" sources current, we've dozens cases schools shut since article. also probably dozen studies showing children spread virus efficiently adults. He's saying actual words.

You could go back forth actually means says ""almost immune"" that's literally said mouth.

I mean know embarrassing say something stupid like ""Nobody said [young people] immune"" proven wrong need understand everyone going understand absolutely divorced reality are.

""OOOOOH libs saying think young people fully immune, actually god emperor said they're *almost* immune, even though almost immunity real"".

I mean that's always risk using strawman first place. Trump  TL;DR, we're predisposed fuck, fuck people over. need trump get rona asap comparing covid flu numbers? chose end points April 1-August 1? opposed say, elitist New York, sent thousands elderly actual deaths order Governor send nursing homes? Please stop Reddit holier thou crap. close 230 cases so. Neat.

Won't take long. Especially Texas elementary school nobody 10 required wear mask. Sick time vacation usually bundled together America PTO (paid time off). Many people fortunate enough even PTO (they get paid take work get fired take much unpaid leave), do, three weeks (15 days) fairly standard. 

This means sick two weeks 5 work days take use vacation, moving, life activities. big part see many people America coming work sick infecting entire office endless cycle misery - multiple colds, viruses, flus every year. may point time America really pinnacle living opportunity, long since passed. supposed accelerated program “tomorrow’s teachers” run high school- they’d send us one several elementary schools district one school period, per week. graded attendance one big project, writing implementing lesson plan. rest class days spent discussing teaching methods childhood development pretty basic level. hated become teacher.  easier point faults others try fix yours. Also, bit unfair compare directly - Sweden 33 times smaller USA population. Italy NYC scare people shitless, nothing will. things matter outside work tho. time something everyone make habit doing. experience get points taken talking much getting trouble, unless Spanish talking english. flu shot, exact symptoms epidemiologists. one. Actually, most. kid Covid test July 9th sent Quest. Got result back August 1st.  cause death pretty much anything boiled essentially lack oxygen brain. 

Rationalizing death caused covid-19 stroke lung damage like saying someone die stabbed rather lacked oxygen brain. 

It's valuable consider variable precipitated destabilization person's internal functioning. Get stabbed? That's precipitating variable. Contract covid-19 caused damage lungs die secondary pneumonia infection? Covid-19 precipitating variable led decompensation. many would alive would put mandatory mask mandate early shame fauci.. would cases without masks? Masks perfect reduce number cases reduce severity cases. Nailed it. work too. don’t miss time get gift certificate award. worst work long term care home. I’m working vulnerable population work rewards us coming work sick. I’m glad asked! can’t say one individual case, calculate fairly good accuracy many deaths causes expect see given period time. number deaths expected number called “excess deaths”. end March USA negative excess deaths year.

Keep mind Biden called Trump racist closing border China. beginning tough time everyone easy play Monday morning QB 7 months later.  LMAO y’all sure care human life Tell 50 millions died 1918 pandemic. started highly contagious mild spring 1918, turned virulent virus fall, continued killing maiming many hosts throughout fall 1919. flu mutate precursor influenza A, e.g. common barely serious flu days. 

Many survived often lungs scarred life ordeal, also long term neurological issues. great grandma several children, including two twins, fall victims 1918 flu. One said twins recovered zero issues whatsoever. many neurological issues afterward classified mentally retarded back day. need global coordinated response food crisis.  parent 4 seem predisposed low grade fevers last several days coupled school policy 24 hours...my kids missed fuck ton school. much school complains missed days. Suck bitches, ain't gonna let kids infect whole fucking school attendance requirements. gonna do? flunk them? Why? gonna lockdown forever 93 year old Ed get another weeks? years ago many people thought would good idea sign 80+ year old parents grandparents FaceBook. Even though 80+ barely know use computer. Old people technologically illiterate think something Facebook, real, even though taught us believe everything read. generous portion fake news spread FaceBook alone. why. Theres lot people across nation zero empathy people outside bubble. Theres much entitlement across country well. Money root, cause, solution, problems

Homer right, thought Beer. point nobody really died AIDS either. deaths illnesses too. Illnesses killed host, however, AIDS  Yep agree first part. 

I tell testing kits gone several revisions still tweaked day accurate. antibody test still anywhere close accurate

Strict lockdown always going tough cause US free country. Marshall law would’ve put place even strict mandated curfew. 

I don’t know outcome would’ve methods appreciate giving game plan would’ve done. Gotta love votes got asking question though right lol. would think capitalists Florida would like keep rent paying nursing home clientele nope. Huh? You’re saying didn’t part sheltered place 4 months? number ICU beds quadrupled 500 2000 spring. space staff come somewhere.

They clear whole pandemic though, need help get it. things wait postponed, like elective surgeries.

Edit: reordered couple sentences people like going disease never goes away. think smarter everyone else zero reason be. caution bull shit anti-vaxxers spew dangerous kids get measles vaccine, someones poor immunosuppressed kid passes away mommy thought smarter scientists doctors. hoax stupid stupid, Im sure worse. call 8%-12% increase last time rise even close December 2017-Jan 2018 flu season (although strange reason, hear peep that.) 

My problem healthcare dollars intersect becomes bit questionable. widely known CARES act, hospitals got added 20% incentive ballpark $13,000 total listed 'Covid death' read something like $40,000 used ventilator. Obviously, insinuating virus fabricated something crazy like that, hard factor in, really is. 

I feel like I'm always reiterate I'm belittling virus, right people dying. point death rate, much hate admit, little worse last really bad flu season. definitely sucks, sucked last time too, shutdown country destroy millions lives. hysteria time around crippling needs stop. nope, that's car accident -- like example says, ""sword head lop"" death, cancer death. applies here. is, unless covid caused heart failure caused heart attack happened driving... 

It's black white issue, I'm sure incorrect figures, really clear ""6%"" whatever they're spouting total BS. 160K 140K 180K similarly large figure. Data analysis always refined learn information. Ever hear monthly jobs report? Go find one, they're always talking previous months adjusted down. entirely normal, political -- is.  could really handle headlines school year started, every headline translating roughly ""hundreds children, staff parents X school district infected"", blood thoroughly boiling now. Fuck year, fuck every single person responsible letting happen. goal profit one back school season, really hope motherfuckers happy next year hell lot orphans decidedly less back school spending. It’s slight uptick last Tuesday

I know conversation arguing with, point discussion. Whenever humans try apply math formula something random like illnesses kids, never ends well.

The extreme cases end spectrum formula keep punished need caught get caught.  dunno may depend state school district kids missed way 10 days school sickness year never got child services called us. 

They send us barrage letters calls informing us child excessive absences. Every time got one would call ask secretary checked daughter’s teachers and/or standardized test scores see absences negatively impacting ability successful school. 

They hadn’t, course, fault naively believing school administrators student’s interest mind rather job security. Trumps fault don’t girlfriend Took long enough Ny reports 32,000 deaths, Florida reports 11,000

So no. hospitalizations all-time low.

are hospitals lying data political purposes? HILARIOUS. can't believe people actually think way. I've never grateful intelligence COVID. 

On plus side, dumb Americans tend fat, deny science, find masks uncomfortable, they're self-selecting old school Darwinism. didn’t see anything saying cases hospitalized. skim maybe missed Neither Trump, Hitler, killed Americans Don’t forget schools receive funding state based Average Daily Attendance. big reason schools reward perfect attendance.  803 cases 100,000 (like article says) less 1%.

The national average nearly 2% population. whole state Arizona 2.7%. 

So sounds like ASU well, far. far. gotten bad year going permanent. Maybe hearing impaired rely reading lips? thank fucking christ.

I strong left-leaning voter. check account age Top Comments doubt that.

Lockdowns prevent deaths. nothing except cause unimaginable economic harm. 

I despised DeSantis voted Gillum 2018. respect decision immensely. Shut Karen It’s thought faking it? it. obvious conversation time, since. talked her? lot? isn’t something need therapy need make realize wrong. disagree kids, differently. youngest it’s moot point. 

You don’t really know mom, telling disagree could start large argument easily might say, well best. wouldn’t gain anything conversation, personally don’t appreciate armchair therapists. sharing truths childhood people understand, feels nice relate others. I’m pent anger love mom much. mean whole month February Trump golfed literally nothing happened protecting country? gone away, needs shut fuck up. pass? Killed Americans Hitler. Surely anyone else would done better. Even sack potatoes Oval Office would done less harm monster led disinformation campaigns continues promote failed everything life. Including failing lose Presidency goal back 2016. plague? Really? COVID .3% fatality rate people 50 lot would alive promote mask wearing beginning. Took long enough.  Hospitalizations lowest since start pandemic.

They LITERALLY pre-pandemic level.

Are saying hospitals across state simply fucking lying?  Perfect attendance WAY less draw “I 2 weeks sick time can’t take work”. sick time. 

My nephews idiot mom thought days would different taking kid. used vacation sick time fucking around, fired nephew sick time. tried claim “but it’s me, it’s kid!” lololol dummy sub nothing exaggeration risks coronavirus. have, sure applies America.

It ranks quite low rankings types freedoms. Including list countries’ civil political freedoms. ranks 53rd.

 actually worried virus. I’m someone generally likes understand long term effects something new understudied virus, injecting something. point still stands even overseas scientists working something. pressure desperation widespread virus become. Vaccines won’t ready they’re ready, amount political pressure good situation. no, wouldnt work like that. cannot put 100% person locked down. many active infections? It’ll get even higher actual vaccine we’re able tout safety :) “Right-wing, conservative, buck-tooth, tobacco spittin’ morons” almost technically accurate description I’ve ever heard particular group general population...but forgot “inbred” politically correct term, “chromosomal degenerate”. This. sister-in-law literally PTSD abused teacher early school. grandma teacher hated much one day made grandma stay home school hours said ""I'm stupid."" (I believe second grade time.)

Bad teachers cause serious problems. many people died hunger Peru, NY, Europe? Because, death despair, able undergo elective procedures screenings leading cause consequential deaths due lockdowns.

But also point flaws lockdown. Which, course, would’ve hard Peru, since military enforced, full blockades tear gas.  won’t “kidnapped street injected” mandatory. 

But “you need school work” mandatory. median age death COVID classified deaths, CDC, higher median overall life expectancy. 

This literally CDC itself.

So statistics, many would died 6-month period. 

Do deny this? Tony Abbott remarkable ability wrong everything time. time however outdone wrong possible be. country went full lockdown, work unless worked grocery store similar still got money (even fastfood partime workers) kids online schools reduced hours, even high school. 

We survived better even lockdown finished regulations strict before. 

(Also, yes, wore masks grocery stores leave homes necessity). Vietnam lazy google things next time. Schools budget linked attendance. We'll get nasty-grams missing many days. Miss many days they'll boot kid school. bunch 70 80 year olds would’ve died, would’ve unfortunate. we’re going way people age groups never got live lives die :) informing using data sources CNN, Fox News, Reddit I’ve saying months people respond calling Karen wants haircut 🙃

The effects lockdown/shelter place/general economic slow worse COVID. Nice try Fauci. Cat bag. ok lets see smoke blunt considering *median age death* Covid *higher median age life expectancy overall* sheer probability, would died. comorbidity simultaneous presence two conditions. article seems imply strong correlation potentially causal effect. Seems comorbidity new symptoms arise disease (i.e., endocarditis wasn’t previously present). FDA used one best public health organizations entire world. One best. corrupted like every US agency right now.

Also, parliament..... we'd much better off.  Everyone shits US, rightfully so, realistically halfway decent job US, situation would be:

- pay ~$150 month deducted paycheck health insurance coverage.

- visits likely cost lot, plans ""out pocket maximum"" ever pay year, likely around $4000 - $6000

It's shitty everyone job gives healthcare. make lot though, still get healthcare medicare pay much, usually. senior year high school end year award ceremony everything academic athletic scholarships people joining military Peace Corps. also awards people exceptional attendance. One guy never missed day Kindergarten Senior year. single day missed, ever. couple years ago graduating class' Facebook page someone asked anyone remembered everyone remembered eventually chimed in. accomplish never missing day school? parents would load medicine send school either made day went nurse sent home. admit high school legit never sick beyond sinus infection migraine, early years parents wanting keep home miss work pay someone watch him.

Our district really bother missing days. time began requesting note absences longer 5 days missed 9 days semester. Woop woop 🙌🏼 Oxford’s testing like 3 4 different countries hotel? r/thatshowthingswork   saw too, believe N95 respirator mask face shield reduce risk 0% nightmares held forced injections. Sleep used good place. Holy shit, someone delusional telling me. kid went school. parent immediately took corona test? Sounds like someone's trying enforced narrative data speaks Includes one-time historical data submission 3,870 cases large laboratory. number new cases 8/31 excluding historical data
submission 3,773. See graph next page excess cases specimen collection date.

3773 hundred last tuesday. roughly flat week week, still overall trending since late July.

Actual data included tests early document: http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf

Percent Positivity New Cases excluding data 5.89% Define “surge” Where’s data supporting claim Hughughughughug! you. course can. can't work type person zero sum, understand mentality. mysterious. ""You go anywhere here"" (home bed 14 days) actively discriminates kids health and/or home problems. school funding tied attendance furthers problem funding baby. Kid isn’t there, lose money. Shit system. make sense- wastewater test see areas active breakouts follow targeted (and expensive) testing high priority areas.

How wastewater testing help process? kind depends definition significant is. [This cloth masks topping filtering around 30% 0.3um particles, unless causing significant pressure drop across material folding it. cloth masks study fell 10-20% range filtering particles size. Many us trying. ...what Expert...he wrong right. flu tests don’t mean squat inaccurate joke. Get lives zombies stopped scared big bad COVID bug, drama culture. Yeah shutting world economy really makes sense ignoramus tools! let get straight, 25,000,000 people work, upwards 130,000,000 3rd world could starve death reported th WHO, look up, it’s sadly normally 12,000,000 year. People selfish cowards. America doomed gullibility non critical thinking masses. Suicides way up, alcoholism, way up, child abuse, way up....yeah, makes sense. Man up! got virus Sept 29th last year ear. Woke terrible vertigo, mean terrible. Think spinning around baseball bat 30 times trying run. Along clogged ear feeling, hearing loss tinnitus. Almost year later tinnitus gotten slightly better, still well clogged ear feeling dizziness. think covid early many people US would started showing symptoms, filling ERs, sometimes wonder since report came woman symtoms, symptoms positive covid-19. guess point is, whatever life altering. Covid whatever virus really number year later still symptoms, think ever go away. really taken serious toll mental health. Sucks parties don’t believe universal healthcare There's like 50% chance see November. :( Well, quite European countries time negative excess death. problem excess death know many factors affect it. Real Covid-19 death toll US could 200k could 300k. best gives lower bound deaths caused whatever happened timeframe, Covid-19. funny... hear [Europe start increase rates US continues  China knows virus end world. handful people die it, oh well cares.

Instead cowering fear, they've decided go let run course LIKE CDC SHOWN, really big problem small part population.

A new virus street that's quite contagious absolutely something worried **at onset**. there's lot unknowns ground zero, day 1.

However, half year they've realized facts virus mortality rate. need pause entire society it. Life go on, even ideal temporarily. nothing Trump two pieces guidance inconsistent, aka contradictory. Haha, true!  1000’s “Facts” Reddit corona experts proving false!  cant positive news r/coronavirus.   

This awesome news! Perhaps Europe USA started similar researches yet. US outright quit global investigation (instead presuming China) announced. cause death wasn’t gunshot, acute lead poisoning heart. mean, it’s long ago people held beliefs.

Miners poor areas early-back 1920’s sacrificed much dangerous underpaid jobs employers power. Kamala Harris backed legislation put parents jail this, case anyone wondering parents send sick kids school. epidemiologists who’ve commented publicly subject say winter could get really bad, haven’t seen worst pandemic yet. Hey hope you’re right. I’m worried. look graphs Worldometer &amp; main thing strikes virus spreading NY &amp; NJ neither state totally stopped spread. spreading constant rate around 700 new cases per day NY &amp; 300/day NJ past 3 months. Spain &amp; France similar graph late spring/early summer started re-open things. curves shot way back recent weeks. Even South Korea double-digit 7-day averages mid-April mid-August spikes several hundred per day. seems we're never really going stop virus circulating around. best cut spread back far wearing masks &amp; keeping distance, also hoping vaccine. Yea never trust anything Motley Fool puts out. However vaccine approval process described quite well. ok, also think added paragraph last time read parents care free daycare much attendance certificates. I'm sure number lives would save coronavirus infected healthy people.

Sounds like he's reporting numbers, US 190K deaths? think take-home message question everything, even things already firmly believe. quote brother says every day ""I took entire statistics class, thing learned make statistics say whatever want. even lying, picking choosing, presenting data way want"" except 8500 unexplained excess deaths (not covid determined) texas march-july. fails apparently can't empathize someone enjoys zero-sum games instead cooperation. Right! Saw family 4 store (mom 3 tow) none masks on.... stopping anyone entering store didnt mask means must've atleast half masked (two kids looked young) took spite getting store. fucking nerve Texans have. 

What fucked view must give kid community. imagine telling wear masks get store, arrogantly took people staring making point stay much 6 ft. Selfish pricks federally backed mortgage (and odds do, 70% mortgages federally backed), absolutely relief available you. house Norcal I've qualified year mortgage forbearance. house currently longer accruing interest missed payments year period simply added payments end loan term, subtracted sale value property choose sell line.. I've trying weeks get counseling/therapy appointment insurance. I've reached 6 different providers now, waiting 7th currently - every single one, response. Nothing. bounce back saying unavailable. people say ""just get therapy!"" often easy. insurance first place! Without it, like $150+/session places!! Plus mental health help received form “this hard everyone, practice hobby” 

Seriously. small comfort I've able spend time hobbies, good distraction couple months. enough - be. sustainable.

Edit: also really demoralizing work feeling like worthy getting help, denied over. whole new form isolation rejection! Woo!! going keep arguing 6% meme like toddlers? 

This America.... yes. Fauci makes blunt 👌 thinking wrong way. need speed testing, making people quarantine longer. know *do* need? better space program. Get colonizing moon descendants say happens Earth earthworms' problem. Maybe shouldn’t children then? Jesus Christ fucking virus. People spread people. Send kids school they'll get sick people get sick. Shit's fucked Mildred Bob live floor, fuck get sick die right?

They gonna die anyway sheeple. Hence, changing minds offering support mult-gen households. Grew LC, gonna assume talking Falls. Falls many kids Creek high school alone, that's 3k kids, PLUS y'alls middle school PLUS elementary. IMO question whether open CCISD schools let alone EDUCATION VILLAGE. I'm disappointed government decisions Abbot Super Intendent made people completely touch reality enjoy hiding mom's basement rest lives. feel like governments insurance stop paying tests can’t deliver results 48 hours, would get results faster. may shortage tests first, I’m sure testing sites would figure soon thereafter. workplaces keep up, that's problem. Masks okay, forced closures not. THANK YOU!
It feels like multigenerational households treated contemptuously States. Making excuses closed case death rate scientific all. one people acts like snowflake wear mask middle pandemic. Comparing “gamble” something chance death 1/6 nonsense.

All guys still intelligent gambling rewards baby shower risk possible severe illness death. hell going vaccine doesn’t work out? Stay inside forever?

I literally came back spending majority day outside enjoying beautiful weather. I'm sure keep building strawman refusing step outside. pandemic gone far long

Pandemic lasts 2-5 years bro. We’re even halfway this. yes american?

&amp;#x200B;

(ps, american too) Uh...name checked out? Anyone believes China still severe outbreak essentially believe standard scientific practices epidemiology. way change people died COVID. disease whose spread could prevented taking actions.

All people died prematurely - get live. got robbed five, ten years. daughters, sons, grandchildren got robbed valueable living time someone whose time die yet. statement disrespectful. Someone sixties, seventies, eighties, could easily lived another ten, twenty years. dead.

But, old, pffff, live valueable more, pfff, /s .  Hilarious get downvoted posting links scientific data! People shameless goes away want 

During high school process migraines diagnosed. First, missed much school needed doctor's note ( got). would held back year missed anymore note more. struggled school them,  got bad sent home (because untreated migraine noise/light means vomitting often), told keep sending home would still held back.

Then prestigious (to small town school) award,, magically doctors note enough) (because mom said would pull held back). wanted ""our school great student award"", suspect.

No mention calling child devices ever made. feel like bed made came us, generationally.
Now figure take bed apart, discover acquire hardware improve shelf-life function, without instructions funded Ikea. like people thinks hoax always either think okay people died 1% total population lol, people days cruel yet march 1 famous people died police Nope. differ fundamental level. 

I don’t support treasonous, science-denying, homophobic, racist, sexist, classist, narcissistic fascists close ties prolific sex traffickers. Neck beards dream society human interaction normalized. People desperate due pandemic. cling anything make seem bad is. pitiful. live alone 4yo, tested positive mild symptoms. Kid negative bouncing wall entire time, fully quarantined myself. sorry pool noodle. empathy doesnt fail lack stamina. yeah think do, live parent's basement. There's lot giveaways way people post people stay home etc. Yea shit, China told everyone January Trump went golfing nothing 

All Chinas fault though right Yeah...it's dumb. might well kill fewer people. people want go dumb, whatever. people struggling enough...your health care premiums going go up. That's despite record profits.

The rules roommates place designed protect us. There's level risk I'm going exposed to, groceries, bike rides mask, roommates' jobs. go walks without mask cross street someone coming by, yet idiots run without mask. never risk. hey go get fucked moving car, asshole.  what’s answer question everyone wants know: mortality rate look like relatively healthy people 70

People 50 likely die car accident COVID. Fauci good math he's lying. virus kills vast majority people well average lifespan means large portion died 6 months ago would objectively dead now. kill, large portion less 2 years left anyway. False framing, Fauci get censored spreading false information? Sorry, true. Wherever capacity available, monitoring secondary long term effects. finding takes lot testing averaging people. hard say someone starts show weird symptoms whether comes Covid-19, disease might picked up, unhealthy lifestyle genetic disposition. Usually takes years ""prove"" link infection (viral bacterial) delayed secondary effects. large sample size work tell certainty many secondary effects see related Covid-19 all. take years sort full picture causes things treat them. Wait licence stolen (i say stolen fucking bullfuckery) joining union??? families can't afford school supplies. Many kids raised people never intended position (ex. lots grandparents struggling raise grandchildren little income). Anything help spare extra costs (even dollars) helps. agree...and yet, are. Fauci power lol

I know someone though... actual study published NEJM, I'd hazard guess legit. feel like people mostly liked Cold Stone lot eventually got tired paying much went back Dairy Queen. think people evaluate excess deaths. They're already +200k deaths time year previous year. There's evident reason deaths diabetes, heart disease, etc. would different last year. add this, TX probably lower US average due reporting standards. look excess mortality they're (slightly) worse US average 109% (at 111%).

However, I'd add comparing \*nationally\* misleading anyway. know first hit states idea doing, medically (not access key drugs, intubating early, etc.) policy-wise (not realizing important masks). highest excess mortality states mostly NE, early outbreaks.

These states driving \*national\* excess mortality rate up. Removing NE would cherry-picking way, pointed Texas' excess mortality higher national average even without sort cherrypicking.

Side note: compare absolute disaster Arizona, Texas &amp; Florida come looking pretty OK, things considered. defense states, think nature randomness one cavalier states ended getting hit particularly hard. Trump publicly wearing mask like July

Does sicken well? hit 5 million weeks ago. Welcome exponential growth.  Look safe HIV is! never killed anyone! mean like potential deaths wrongly attributed given expired elderly.

can't provide direct proof doxxing easily say anyone covid died attributed covid whether covid heart attack local hospitals  Copenhagen problem. says software engineer working FAANG company money rains started stocking N95 masks back January, enough last months. look virus spreads, probability reaching countries mass transits, especially information delay symptoms contagious, response Wuhan, uncertainty virus (which still remains, concerning long term effects duration immunity) see anyone expect virus go away, see anyone else could compare previous viruses like MERS bird flu, since viruses sinister contagious killing person quickly spread observed before. faith general populace foresight apparently morally right make sacrifices. see animal-like child-like wanting want now, like desert dinner. march, knew things back normal long time, think much worse things going come future. Ok I’ll re-approve comment see comment get us. accept it. Yes know that

Excess deaths like 50-60k

It's way higher 190k, yes, correct teachers son’s school don’t care kids dealing with. assignments due, exceptions. 

It really annoyed really sick. AP math teacher expected turn homework assignments class two weeks. asked leniency wouldn’t feel overwhelmed. said needed every single assignment “show mastery.” didn’t make sense already aced tests! live Georgia confirm one give fuck Also one relevant. Compliance masks way things restored. state fake lockdown week half months ago. Everything closing laying people enough people complying pandemic precautions Republicans went vacation instead passing aid. this, people act like baby mask minor inconveniences. source would nice.  get it, test symptoms? ones without spread others? Covid never end. anyone would put life others lives risk long term health beverage make home well beyond comprehension. use get coffee every single day started I'm laying hospital bed dying I'm suffering health issues might permanent, need piece mind make fucking coffee home.

For sake health health loved ones anyone come contact go unnecessary indoor spaces. know media barely made news sake economy virus confirmed AIRBORNE indoor spaces safe forget fact one talks about..it enter eyes. Bet kids come teacher report coughed going get told ""wasting teacher's time"". 

""He's likes you!""

""Just ignore him, he'll stop eventually.""

Yes, that's true, know (at least right away) latest visit make visit last visit. 3,500 mile trip, boss still many interactions could result (or wife) picking virus. takes one bad actor along way.

Like said, please stick /r/conspiracy. add outrage government *trusted* people comply recommendations laws; people *trusted* government take care best possible way; politicians *trusted* experts come best measures. 

The government gave citizens guidance effective measures stay healthy asked responsible. One would think big ask one praising citizens on-going long-term compliance (\~90%) recommendations civil responsibility shown. 

Instead get outrage citizens trusting government. yeah articl written march, know stage 2 trials went. success much promising Thanks approval guess Read little closer, city given two weeks test everyone simultaneous. No, majority. top that, many nursing home victims never included official death toll, never tested; part official death rate mentioned.

Anyway, want play game, there's Peru 871 deaths per million inhabitants (officially; look excess deaths, twice many), much Spain European country, despite massively younger population; still sign herd immunity. That’s cool. like Korean coined terms. Thanks info! possible small government, low economic regulations, social safety net.

The ""second wave"" mainly first wave southern states lightly touched first wave elsewhere, reopened early, got full strength first wave (e.g. Arizona, Florida, Texas, Louisiana again, Georgia) California. total population states 113 million.

It’s comorbidities. 

No one actually dies SARS-cov2, like one dies HIV.  die complications, virus destroys body immune system longer defend against. 

This doesn’t mean 94% people pre-existing conditions, means 6% death certificates completely filled out.  two causes death. wore mask someone punched face, got AIDS. mean baby household, tell taking Coronavirus seriously thus far, trust they'll take seriously kid, cancelling October visit. life baby far important grandparents feelings. risk worth it.

Its frigging sad though really They're less likely get severe case, they're less likely get case. Wearing mask lessen severity case one still contracts it. I've dreams well!

1993. since posed question, answered

I'm actually still sure answer previous variables come play

This means agree variables considered assessing well country yeah, think 22 deaths better 9126 deaths, better 180,000 deaths

Do think total deaths meaningful statistic deaths per capita? mean there's lot porn go days. Respect fans' time. can’t tell us wearing mask doesn’t personally decrease chance getting sick couple months later claim does. don’t know believe. point you’re weekend trip 35 days FL 17th nationally deaths/100k top-10 population, pop density oldest population. metrics, top-5 worst. major international airport (MIA) National quarantine center airport (FLL) one largest cruise terminals world took citizen non-citizen COVID patients ships nowhere else go.

I heard state going go extinct St. Augustine opened beaches walkers surfers back May. Disney opened FL spiking June people thought would kill everyone numbers declined steadily since noticeable spreader events tied it. Go hang r/Florida see plenty people asking: ""HaY GUyS, im coming FL next week, do? bars open?""

The disdain FL 80% political, 10% FL general 10% actual criticism I'll happily acknowledge fair. think important points here
1. antibody testing, performed NY State Heath Department April shows similar (actually much higher) infection rates Stanford study. rapidly discovered people immunity antibodies actually minority compared T-Cell immunity. suggestions seem coming fruition Sweden, Taiwan, parts United States Georgia course known packed hallways non-mask wearing students almost month ago seeing major declines cases deaths. 

Just food thought Ioannidis, like old zen master said ... “we see”. manager made come work sick, I'd make sure I'd schedule two-hour meeting office shake hand several times. hear you’re saying part post said exactly point “at least potentially effective EU.”

My point EU, Spain, Italy, UK higher deaths per million US - France higher case counts per day earlier year.

So shit countries HARD shut everything still fucking up?

Like said people simply hate Trump understand why, numbers show places Europe aren’t much better get little criticism response. agree said, Corona bad students learn much disadvantage long run. current situation, can't risk life future generation. I'm looking possible outcome. Worst case scenario either die life altering conditions. Floridian feel you.. watching state collect 10k+ day something else.

Hope guys get figured soon go same. maybe vaccine also arrive around holidays? (Don't burst bubble people, like hold onto hope take one day time) Got stats hospitalization death rates young people? article talks myocarditis one reason. Indeed problem athletes year (rowing actually higher incidence football according published papers I’ve read). Add added risk COVID related heart problems isn’t far stretch schools actually paid attention sports medicine infectious disease experts. 
Of course concerned liability it’s clear colleges don’t care. money. 

One players mentioned article friend’s son. Perfectly healthy, went football camp following protocols, got COVID real hard time. heart problems. Remember, covid additive risks. attended big ten university think made right decision. Thanks, hadn’t considered immunocomprimised scenario. lol, one first times wore mask exact thing actually. Feels embarassing looking back now. Must nice live country 5.6 million people. disagree. 

We idea would happen rich well educated society without regulatory agencies tried yet. mean yes, easy point undeveloped nations without strong government agencies say ""aha see? Look shit hole is, clearly stronger regulatory approach would help here"" hand we're talking population less educated simply poor luxury means complain rich usually escape.

I believe rich country wealthy individuals breathing air, drinking water eating food issues would quickly get sorted free market. Otherwise wealthy individuals would simply leave. mean puts pressure government agencies days anyway, government agencies avenue people drive change want see community. lack imagination let claim way best way could so.

I live rich small country see right stark difference COVID response vs places. Masks mandatory anywhere inside safety distance can't maintained, got 50 masks per person free, testing free encouraged whole population mass tested free. 0 doubt another kind health hazard would threatened rich fkers would get sorted quickly, without government. Germany.. feel bad enough him/her is.. 😬 Clearly interest education families' financial hardship. Clearly somehow know every student safe environment school. Maybe care fact vaccines currently tested children? possibility large part population get vaccinated? election stolen Trump. Swing states crony governors (I'm looking you, Florida) go red. 100%. 

There huge lines blue districts efforts get emergency extension polling hours locations shut conservative judges already standby that. 

Dropbox locations absentee ballots overrun reason discard/disqualify votes aggressively pursued. couple legitimately invalid ballots cherry picked shown media justification 10,000 ballots thrown out. 

Mail ballots lost mail overwhelm mail infrastructure. Lawsuits behalf voters whose votes went missing immediately mobilized, administration demand result imposed resolve. push decision conservative judge's purview. 

It might sound tin-foil-hatty bones know true. 

Yours to. country run morons. He’s good fit. Yeah I'm Lake County. mask mandates except retailers. downtown mt dora mask reg ONE follows it. bars packed full maskless folks weekend.  Good you! Sometimes that's best do, sadly. think used poor examples. Grocery stores gas stations essential services weren’t really cut anywhere. Florida didn’t close non-essential retail unless could maintain six feet distance. could, could remain open. Given high incidence coronavirus Indian nationals banned countries CDC subreddit? get words mouth instead another ""news"" site? would vaccine already gone rounds testing. experimenting. forced phase 3. would also advancement racial ideological goals, unless minimizing death ideological goal. 

The context fucking matters. idea right not, I’m bored aussie occasionally checking situation countries situations (one US) noticed deaths websites corona virus reported 170k CDC website already 220k+ Wow Wrong every sentance we’re fine! Remind 3 weeks another “mystery surge” happens really sports programs fraction school generates income. comes tuition patents People okay fast-tracking seemed happening save lives. seems happening save political careers, people going start distrusting it. respect Dr. Fauci admire voice reason unreasonable time, ""flaw"" someone like personal life tell never really associates scumbags underestimates vast amount damage scumbag local community, even community mostly at-least decent people. worked pandemic cases 13 years? like exist. uncharted territory.  broken bone suffered fall work. soft tissue injury moving patient. rare cancer comes industrial chemical used plant town. 

This something equally attributed caught home much work. problem hand sides case. fair way saying 100% workers comp 100% health lines. actually careful take risks. ppl assume eventually endanger yourself. Defeatist That's really useful, thank ""I’m sure ultra rich workaround.."" 

It's called tax evasion.. need check panama papers get names though.. Yes. living air conditioned spaces recycle air keeps virus aerosolized. 

So spread faster, killing faster. Allowing herd immunity arrive faster. assume got critical mass people refuse, unable enforce it. yeah, tricky one. * East Asia: Elimination, things getting back normal.
* Europe: Suppression, winter going complicated bit scary.
* Americas: Unrestricted spread, lets hope deaths go much. didn’t what? point President gets significantly medical treatment testing person US exception people already hospital. 

So yes, I’m confident gets tested COVID number potential diseases health conditions may get year. 

I’m sure hard? President going get standard care far beyond average person precautions going much thorough average person  ""herd immunity"" without vaccine even thing. diseases eliminated many countries thanks herd immunity produced vaccination programmes. herd immunity something achieved natural infection.

Take example measles, caused virus around humans centuries. highly infectious — R0 value 15.

This means average one child measles infect 15 others. result, around 95 per cent people need resistant disease population achieve herd immunity.

**Most people recover measles infection produce good immune response protects rest life. yet, vaccination, measles common childhood disease.

Each new generation children susceptible enough people naturally became resistant produce herd immunity.**

In 1930s, temporary herd immunity effect recorded one location US.

But exception, countries rolled universal measles vaccination programmes enabled come close eliminating disease.

Scientists think R0 value SARS-CoV-2 4 6, similar rubella virus. level vaccination needed produce herd immunity eliminate rubella 85 per cent."" wear masks. won’t need wsj tell you.

Pathetic humans care world: noooo, make vaccine. Destroy world. argument strong, ants throw rock make point. repeat, EXCUSE INHUMANE BEHAVIOR, ABSOLUTELY NONE WHATSOFUCKINGEVER. 

Defend stupidity, obtuseness, idiocy whatever superlative describing man’s inhumanity man, fellow kind, always comes back to, excuse this. Paywall, unfortunately That's pretty bold statement given liberalism originated Europe. Using virus excuse bash America. maybe bad comment Sarcastic Internal tourism wouldve much beneficial local economy. Aviation way thousands flights day needs change fought virus, other. won. Username checks Yeah ‘individual’ rights spread coronavirus wearing mask. inevitable. Tourism necessary stimulate economy lockdown. show image classroom surprisingly looks like good social distancing, typical NY schools?

The plan average 10 kids every classroom, yes. nephew naval academy caught covid along 1/2 squad 2 weeks. publicizing covid numbers. totally agree flu season going less due workplaces working home, mask compliance lack activities, think noted many cases, work home coming end. There’s multiple reports companies calling employees back end September, office thinking calling us back September 16th. Also, states opening schools back full steam ahead. think flu/COVId season won’t doom gloom predicting, ending work home precipice flu season seems like bad idea. ""They go online rest year"" something propose lightly. least, extremely complex issue without easy answers. Except r/coronavirus. carries lot extremely negative consequences kids.

And plan along locking hard NY achieved little huge cost. i'd love hear epidemiologiests oppinion claims herd immunity #1 reason case drops places like sweden nyc even comorbities traditional sense like obesity. 

The majority related causes death ""stopped able breathe"" ""difficulties breathing"" ""pneumonia"".

Literally way COVID kills. Unbelievable. Sometimes think they’re paid shit. Usually ignore they’re getting wilder doomsday predictions. Wish something reddit fact check assholes Considering lot folks love proclaim, “why would anyone get tested don’t symptoms?” it’s probably often Lol imagine thinking third world country like Florida would accurately report deaths.... Lol goes karaoke pandemic? Depends are. South Florida required masks since first week March going big-population states like CA, TX, FL. 

It's going bunch low-population states. 

You make mind whether low-population states matter might well ignore what's happening them. Science laws nature trifled with! Earth take back think see intensified natural disasters, climate change, diseases spreading, factor fact people want deny: many us living planet. “cute” authority be, there’s things power can’t control.  Personally think intentionally try infect someone, charged bioterrorism. Americans little exposure foreign languages zero experience acclimating.

Exactly, that's phase 3 for. (Potential adverse effects Phase 1 2 for.) reason stated right there, need make one up: get better trial results, get approved quickly, turn make money quickly.

edit: downvoting change replied to: ""*The real reason want test younger people know respond better likely get immune response lead approval.*""

That's realist, that's psychopath.  6% really incomplete death certificates. death certificate supposed list immediate cause death, disease usually type organ failure. COVID-19 may underlying cause eventually led failure, never immediate cause. especially worse consider testing less per capita less people per square mile famous last words...? love fact give opinion RN COVID unit you’re downvoted, simply opinion you’ve seen doesn’t flow narrative “lock everything long possible”.

You’re seeing us based job, say hold value ... people tied narrative refuse even think situation doesn’t flow it. mask reduced risk wearer 65% one It’s sad, many people could avoid huge risks health others simply wearing mask brainwashed political bs override everything science tells us works — obvious results countries didn’t manage turn (like everything) partisan political issue went like dumpster fire prove point. better this. better this.

The long term solution America education. Reform it. Fund it.

Yeah don’t list showed map states shaded cases colleges old testament filled bazillion laws stopped spread easily transmissible diseases within religious communities. believe social interactions smaller scales nearly important done, masks without mostly, without mandates, there's reason believe adopted large scale outside secondary later efforts retailers. Texas still lot cases though I’m seeing death rate percentage makes sweden look pretty shitty compared neighbors hold back. engaged discussion back Frontline doctors ordeal; made really think actually try share truth. people itching fight. need people might reasonably come contact infected person.

For though? Honestly curious, since helps testing effectiveness (not potential adverse effects vaccine issue here), even seems hazy me, ""more likely"" something base much on, people knowingly contact people known infected really different ethically giving Covid directly (in words, no-no), *think*.

But know much trials wondering, links explain I'd grateful for. well. :( news cycle already mentioned viral load plays large factor severity cases.

Does mean wear mask exposed smaller viral load come contact virus? useless study. Complete waste taxpayers money. stepped away everyone started coughing plus complained loss taste insider trading yet? “Sheeple” favorite. I’m going Baaaa next person says mention cost Interferon. given early make virus worse. really option. study consisted 4 people seems Hungary fake news spread, already read comment Hungarians saying similar theories tests done private companies said positive test contacts contacts add money, like big scam. thing also happens Spain, first 5g antennas, bill gates, ""plandemic"" phase virus exist manipulate scare, others fault soros also phase tests give false positives patients hospitals empty (My theory idiots.) list states?

also, dont watch cnn list states reporting college cases? Texas little spaced tri-state area lot multifamily units right answer. situation, acceptable procedure allows unknown long side effects chance known. 

What know none ingredients involved, used before, ever caused them. it’s unlikely. clue shape we’ll in. know sections hit first haven’t seen resurgences opened up. northeast went started everything locked versus infections almost everything opened back like 90% less. I’m sure people keep warning flu season, reason think it’ll bad especially mask wearing highest it’s ever USA’s history. folks say wait winter also believed we’d see take break summer come back roaring fall/winter. saw meteoric rise summer. believe won’t second wave first one damn long drawn out. think goal manufacture products silicon nitride powder incorporated them. currently incorporated filters masks, believe looking frequently touched surfaces contain product well.

Kinda cool ""The remarkable finding present study one-minute exposure 5% solution Si3N4 resulted 85% inactivation SARS-CoV-2 "" also safe touch. wear mask. go much peoples. quarantine. says lot class divisions me. stepdad taught guide life, today he’s falling Facebook conspiracies.

Fort Jackson wasn’t much better. Columbia, SC July digging trenches wasn’t fun either  Well, currently want push vaccine fully tested within months still want push herd immunity uncontrolled spread disease that. So...

Also, think administration built legitimacy many people go untested vaccine, even rushed one. matter vaccine people confidence think effects lives living economy thats shut 10 years? Honest question.

Depends individual situation values, it? I'd say economy stagnant wages uncompromising treatment much people besides using lifetime. Wonder much money he's losing? Great pitch tbh. Belief powerful dangerous thing. Yes. is, people ended attacking Healthcare workers. believe CDC lying cost thousands lives, gave industry enough time prepare pump masks. Overall, still fuck though. favorite went get oil change couple days ago. sign clearly posted door lobby mask required enter building.

Quebec got rocked beginning spring break 1 week everyone else's Montreal almost 300,000 undergraduate students. huge outbreak right onset, things pretty calm left. NYC type situation 3rd worst death rate world behind NYC Stockholm. 

That said, things leveled quickly NY furthermore friends eligible got government money without problem. Additionally, Quebec really large aging population disproportionately affected. Even beyond deaths, Canada's handling people losing jobs, giving money businesses pay employees without penalty well no-interest loans make even numbers similar, situations incomparable. iirc roughly 20% people transmit covid family member There’s 3 places world despise. America, China, Japan. Japan never paid 100 years ago, Shinzo Abe holding power despicable, blatant denial crimes WW2 reluctance educate people past makes dislike country.

The people seem nice enough though. think mother unwed 21 great job she’s one taught make decisions based principles. never life understand gripped idiocy Trumpism stupid conspiratorial ideology like *”the plandemic.”* CDC pushing it. buried weekly data update researchers. took least 5 clicks CDC homepage find this, normal COVID information. moron found somehow, posted Twitter BS analysis, got picked far-right ""news"" sites, eventually made way normal media. worry, we're also focusing research maple syrup fight it, hockey part recovery, beavers support animals. thing find confusing this, people can't stand home.

Lol. bet there’s absolutely political motivation ever house election two months now. I'm shocked 😱 certain death figures absolute bullshit. I’m Christian don’t follow pastor blindly.

How far we've fallen. Sending prayers  wonder mask compliance US regional. market rules. Let clarify, peer reviewed science, typical q-anon sourced, FaceBook ‘science.’ going internationally accepted set full trials, hyper speeded version would make IRB committee’s eyes spin.

That's knew getting used new normal.... hasn’t “quarantine” Texas since April, there’s gonna either. What’s point even surviving pandemic can’t lives it’s over? Maybe ir yough people get resistences, mosly infect others, like elders Time par-tay. Wait, virus over, right? You’re saying think people held back *looting hospitals* CDC said masks don’t help?

I’m ashamed myself. Honestly, range options pretty reasonable. I've gotten three ""free"" tests since March - simply precautionary measures, last week found significantly exposed someone tested positive days later, ran paid $110.00 one hour turn around test (thankfully negative).

The $110 well worth immediate peace mind, 2-5 day results available want pay money.

Not much complain about.. Yes. point dismiss isolate feeling sick, since clearly still possible get without traces community spread. Walking around sick smart right anywhere seems.

&amp;#x200B;

 Covid deaths. know sounds mean say, one cares Covid deaths anymore. Even liberals care, white kid killing 2 people self-defense bigger news thousands nameless people dying Covid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry. one cares anymore. die die. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's shove aside move on. masks ruin economy though. barely take effort. link shared Reddit back. favorite read Oxford vaccine, July 14th, information may already successful vaccine likely won’t 100% effective, matter wins race, success might different definitions. vaccines produce what’s called sterilizing immunity, body produces neutralizing antibodies block virus getting cells. vaccines don’t prevent infection trigger immune system protect illness. Jonas Salk’s polio vaccine doesn’t stop infection prevents disease crippled millions. asked Gilbert definition successful vaccine would be, wouldn’t drawn specifics. “We need vaccine high level efficacy disease, also significant impact virus transmission,” said. 

It sounds care preventing development disease Covid-19, instead preventing infection “It doesn’t need cure SARS-CoV-2,” AstraZeneca’s Pangalos says. “I don’t know completely knock shedding people infectious, whether we’re going cure people completely whether dampen illness. want vaccine stop people going hospital dying. that, think people pretty happy. Neutralizing antibodies one things you’ll look at, T-cell response going important. 

Again, info might outdated. 

But even 100% perfect vaccine, anything point helpful slowing pandemic long safe. strange attitude 



Hey, don’t attend school you’ll lose scholarship money. behind graduating can’t take certain classes. Lose job offer. 


Oh don’t forget thought school would online signed classes isn’t. don’t go paying thousands dollars attend class. 



But hey you’re adult. Get fucked like rest us. Bend take cause universities want football. No, 94% comorbidities top covid made worse. define cdc website somewhere it’s always way difficult glance me. Also look comorbidity might help. wrong though, sure
why people agreeing this. fact kill large number greater reason ever wear mask lethal would many people already comorbidities. 6% thing true, we’ve always sort known we’ve taking precautions protect elderly/immunocompromised people. Keyword ""mild"". never went school slight runny nose? Probably would died seeing medical bill American. admitted made MISTAKE. guess perfect never made error. 🤦‍♀️ Yeah Sweden well things considered.We wait pandemic end judge well not. Diabetics require strips, lancets, syringes, prep pads 

Wound care requires bandages ointments 

Why buy supplies online? replace much consideration burnt bulbs. guinea pig phase 3 one vaccines... cautiously optimistic. costs $2,700+ assumes another country would 

Mentally ill authors demand need plastered USA Truth 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Currently rule Sweden - keep kids home symptoms week least 2 days symptoms gone away. gonna way 2-3 days per year.

Also, nobody talking child fever going school. cold first days home recover lingering symptoms weeks even without infectious. Workers replaceable. pay us enough live either. say true focus Madrid... definitely hit hard first time hit hard second time. take advise dentist problem eyes, tell would take advise neurologist, immunology problem. insurance would l probably even allow it. Yet... Actually, Spain went hard lock (with military backing less) instead letting virus run natural course. they're reaping sowed. 

Covid Spain places early victory laps:

 Precisely, alergies exact symptoms cold covid-19. kid gets tested days symptoms negative, keep home? Hope recovered ❤  Madrid 5300 per square km. seen anyone claim Madrid hit due low density.

Amsterdam 5200, Munich 4800.

Of course density makes difference. point claiming Sweden bad low density valid Stockholm comparable rest Continent. work though? exam room, doctor goes drawer tongue presser go ""hold on, doc, brought mine"" take pocket? really cannot imagine people buying medical supplies internet Hehe human go horizontal. sounds exactly like somebody would never let evidence change mind anything. Somebody thinks predict future 100% certainty. Somebody ignores inconvenient truth. Somebody is..... true idiot. damn foreigners, going countries exploit them.  6 people already losing minds, think handle another 8? System works great doctors paid 3-10x paid anywhere else say nothing whole industry middle men would jobs anything changed. Sure, think reduced that's borderline stupid...

**But also know they're reporting intentionally, well.**

This fucked. deadly virus be, much worried wave authoritarianism undoubtedly follow. throughout history story remains same: shit hits fan everybody running scared, people rally around idea ""strong leader"" - return, strong leader delivers easy-to-understand narrative involving blaming bad stuff scapegoats using crisis justify curtailing human rights. eventually, narrative becomes ""We always war ~~Eastasia~~ COVID-19"" get stuck hellhole science-denying demagogues scared flock sycophants cultists eating fake news without hint critical thought.

Oh yeah, THEN, happened, get climate change bonus, lol. thing is, probably isolated cases vaccine potentially something bad somebody somewhere, immune systems really really different vaccinate millions people, kinda bound happen isolated cases. would mean vaccine unsafe general public risk needed taken. people say coronavirus dangerous/just flu/not real/only kills weak hyper-focus singular cases tell people vaccines kill everyone forever. never able win crowd trying pointless. best even give air legitimacy giving platform draw uneducated people in. Allergies aren’t contagious? They’re also manageable using antihistamines avoiding allergen question. idea point is. 2-3 days school every year shouldn’t measurable effect inequality asocial behaviour I’d love read study claims does. I’d argue children sent school illness aren’t able learn nearly effectively normal. Factoring kids almost certainly infect, think fact sent school would net negative impact education pupils institution. Yes That's means. Obviously anyone sick always home. cold usually means e.g. fever.

When kids cold usually ""sick"" 2-3 days, minor remaining symptoms (e.g. bit whisky voice, tiny bit runny nose etc) several weeks that. there. normal year, home 2-4 days clearly ill, following 3 weeks obviously. kid 5, home soon runny nose winter would probably 80% days.During pandemic, keep home even slightest symptoms, also kept sibling symptoms home. Obviously possible long term keep kids family home several weeks every time cold, 3-4 times per semester.

If understand correctly I'm describing guidelines about. able kids schools actively ill, may showing remaining symptoms, case symptoms Covid. option never alternative.

No one suggesting (obviously) sending kids fever school, example. literally controlled outbreak prepared ever, hollywood movie plus fact countries really far away, making travel expensive. 4th July actually fit argument all. holiday cause big case spike, would expect see reflected numbers roughly 2-3 weeks holiday, that's roughly ""rule thumb"" regard long takes cases caused certain event run course, transmit couple times, start showing data. fact, that's pessimists (I want say ""doomers"" silly connotation associate with) saying time - standard ""just wait 2 weeks we'll super fucked"" line. 

But happened. fact, speaking terms country large, cases actually started levelling right around July 16 so, nearly 2 weeks July 4, exactly timeframe expect see big case explosion 4th. happen.

Memorial day fit argument quite well logic, 1 2 ain't great. He'll right eventually. Even kills everyone, it'll Easter. cold alergies? September, start questioning locked (yes even US locked extent) worth it. virus going away matter do, virus. Can't blame people making decision risk worth seeing alternative 6 months Time start caring really ableism lot redditors implicit. Cold minor seasonal thing literally cared centuries willing refuse education kids extremely short-sighted, especially authorities confirming lack education far serious consequences long run kids society whole - increasing inequalities, asocial behavior, decreased mental health, increased wealth gap on. people really believe CDC covered 6 months impact election posted website anyway?

Yes. 2020 shown us stupid people are. Another idiot dangerous opinions. means, make better one. Dear Leaders safe. need masses infected immune go back living lives safely. Wow must work together. bosses think plot kill Tom Hanks.

I wish /s. Whereas believe keeping safe know 'endless lockdowns' required. 

Strong lock followed testing contact tracing actually required. Yeah, Japan think could make wearing masks nose national sport. specifically said \*anecdote\* examples like people seen first hand hahaha.

There might one Smithfield plant Utah covid stuff made news. Feel free google it. talking ONE plant. places aggregate. 

That said, sure farfetched high majority people recovered considering recovery rate like 99%. Maybe hospital folks ended taking disability. business ask family member prod. 

All know local Costco stopped instituting meat purchase limits makes assume meat packing plant scare making rounds months ago over? definitely quiet media front packing plants petridish covid. Wonder is. article Spain though. Maybe unsalvagable patients ""live"" ECMO forever. now?  Far many people content let kids go school sick. shows complete lack self awareness empathy. Cue [""Extremely dangerous video. know meant, don’t knob. Stockholm population density:4800 people per square km
Paris population density:21616 people per square km
Barcelona population density:15992 per square km
Not cities like this,but still think makes difference agree assessment. 

Basically, country healthy people fewer deaths country people obese hypertension diabetes , everything else equal.

I borderline hypertension, I'm worried sister hypertension obese. Wtf even know saying then. spread throughout whole country again?

Armchair medical professional tryhard lol proof.  one case says ""It looks like could happen"". course, remarkable event base change occur timeframe, remarkable nature cases B would shift case possible reinfection case high-rate evolution within infected individual. 

There 16 million recovered Covid cases world. many reported cases reinfection?

So could ""remarkable"" case reinfection, could ""remarkable"" case high-rate evolution within individual.

What *isn't*, ""proof reinfection"". Although agree single case suggests reinfection could possible rare cases. need Japan!! close culture already, wish could learn intelligent measures.  2010 till 2018 46 64 counties NYS saw population decrease. well NZ original form yes. know, many places US bent curve prepped accordingly see goal posts get moved. 

Don't overwhelm health care (done) decline deaths (done) decline hospitals (done) eradicate virus???  people God using liberty assholes towards people? That’s crazy rare, ok Ok lol. 100 days zero community transmissions. first time introduced country already back control. 

Stop jealous lol mention scientists reached consensus catching virus actually make immune it... Herd immunity may save us time. Stay strong, rehearse ""I told so"" speech.   teacher got Covid recently?
That's strange, reported cases imported.

Where teacher located? city?

Is possible test false positive? he/she feel sick all?

Thanks info! Point clarity. lot people say Trump fascist says things appeal fascists demonstrably fascist people (Miller, Bannon, formerly) working him. don’t think it’s useful distinguish someone ideologically intentionally fascist somebody inept narcissist happen adopt fascist policies. 

Further, didn’t expand executive authority point concession: had. already. failed. allowing states manage crisis indicative benevolence, it’s indicative personal inability accept responsibility seen failure. position convenience expediency. people died it.

I know didn’t address totality post. feel though probably agree disagree, don’t think public service unnecessarily charitable Trump.

I generally agree decentralized approach could potentially effective, least effective EU. difference decentralization de facto expectation EU nation state’s whereas country Governor’s begged help months told fuck thing.

They make individual plans beautiful display state autonomy. necessity federal government failed them.

I engaged post seemed coming position good faith don’t think downvoted. hope feel same.

Best. take ""panel"" realize this. I’m also states sometimes country surgeries seem sketchy me. locate surgeon/facility trust? bullshit still spread around?

This like saying Toronto Vancouver dense looking statistics Canada whole. New York dense city United States quite sparsely populated West.

Ha! person first stopped deploying reason instead wishes hell upon people seems u here. point still entirely valid. proven track record countries containing disease. everything pinned individual country's response. one decided nothing worse, u can't blame anyone else. 

If u valid response that, confidently say desperate one me. Thank you! assumed case, see report. I'll edit comment include it. 😂 What. You’re joking. America doesn’t true “left”.  Assuredly, not. means doctors failed put information cause death 6% listed covid. basically list different things doctors put death certificates.

Impose lockdown save lives = genocide!

Force vulnerable teachers &amp; children back school midst pandemic &amp; nothing curb spread = freedom! city handle virus? mean George W Bush called fascist well media who’s calling Trump one, they’re rehabilitating image like crazy lmao. Calling someone “fascist” means nothing anymore. math out, could absolutely know Moderna Pfizer efficacy fast enrollment/high incidence rate scenario, drug efficacy 50%-60%-plus, study would hit p-value less 0.0001 Oct. 29, said. conservative enrollment infection rate, statistical significance could hit study goals mid-November December, Yee said. variables could push timing efficacious vaccine could slow events; inability meet FDA guidance statistical success also includes lower bound confidence interval less 30%, Yee said.

If vaccine’s better 50-60% (Which Fauci suspects be) October 22nd could well within range valid announcement works. could possibly go wrong? Others countries shown us climate matter. Like people said gonna go away started getting hot actually empathize people think virus literally real kind hoax. Yes, *know* real rational, scientific basis, emotionally feel like there's virus I've never seen it, I've never interacted someone it. many leaders seem pretending exist. live Texas hill country (very red/right-leaning) I've places everything seems totally normal, I'm psycho weird dumbass mask face reason. mid May. Bars closed, restaurants take-out : gas stations, grocery stores, open. Compared civilized nations, answer No, really. everyone saying ""we already knew this"": yeah. proof.

Parks good place things (if they're open at) away people still enjoy stuff away home. sunk little low said must tiring know experts doctors trying get us mess. next fb post stating opinion something covid related frontline doctors could reply. pressed “unfollow”, shoulda done much earlier. need make sure never eat drink anything ever fine. boi, think stats world works, know say aside from, good luck there! I'm pretty sure people would surprised believe it. MRNA vaccines new. It’s directly related. promising. 

A good vaccine would good. soon possible. 

But FDA politicized recently discourage people getting vaccine. That’s it’s important wait solid data release vaccine candidate. Good. least Iowans arent afraid nothing liek waiting 20 hours waiting room discharged upon request 'its emergency'.

True, also seems heart attacks strokes too, general organ failure think difference wanting enjoy little time have, plain acting like virus outbreak. saying wrong - people blatantly going around without damn precautions it. legit living every second worth. That's I'm trying catch potentially deadly virus. go out, maybe parks such. Get groceries Instacart since job minimal hours.. issue people wearing mask want to""stick man"" give shit possibly spreading it.  sperm comes people coronadeath lol, kidding.

Your post worth alone, thank laugh. 😂 Oh America can! exceptional everyone around enjoying life wtf isolating yourself?

Live life bud !! Every death happened first hundred. That's exponential disease spread works. ranting desperately now, going dignify second paragraph response.

China pay done every nation earth, pay *hard*. Hundreds thousands families missing loved ones Chinese citizens continue eat wet markets years warned it, Chinese government slowed understanding disease save face. hell pay unknown nation modern history get back feet disturbance. Wrong. 90% people see wearing masks young minorities (Black Brown). 10% White. 0% Asian. trying make political take guess groups going vote. likely wrong base everything mask-wearing lack there-of. say faint heart. mentally weak, ignore this.

To answer question: don't.

'Normal' uplifted roots tossed. country, many parts world, experiencing what's called mass cohesive psychological mortality denial. Basically slow-motion nuke went off, we're ignoring fact blasted away fabric formally relatively safe lives - actually *want* people lie us. tell us everything ok. reality:

At [2.5% Global Mortality 1918 flu killed *50 million people* population 1.8 Billion people 2 years went away. Let thank sink in.

*It went away everyone either infected developed immunity killed.*

Covid fatal, least [1% *very* conservatively speaking, approximately [7.8 people living world now. 1% 7.8 Billion *78 million* people. Take exponential spread mixed total retardation wearing masks enclosed public spaces, local governments refusing test &amp; track, got *at least* 50 million 78 million people wiped across globe 2-5 years. Month fucking 5. able taste food makes pissed handled properly. Yeah, I'm confused. went last week extractions braces Mexicali, we've gone 2 times, border agent didnt tell us anything it. 

Is something future maybe? Online says things closed. Lol... surprise. genocidal regime uses crisis commit genocide? surprising. /s Agreed... reality surprise many people fake news unless comes Trump's mouth or, fucking reason, facebook truly .. intellectually challenged, guess. good person ""successful"" : obviously, public policy role, abilities profoundly intellectually challenged individual going sufficient discharge duties. Floridians cannot perceive reality, idk. Used to, still used well like “treat symptoms, test everyone feels need get tested” That’s bingo! Could take entire unpaid year work you’re Mexico *still* save money USA certainly gonna try...  shit. needed fucking panel tell us that? much cash got burned come sly conclusion? could’ve asked trump would’ve admitted much spot yes!!! die AIDS; die Cells gone common cold kills you.

Same thing. Utter horseshit. Canada? mean depends whether proper apolitical release not. Worst case scenario mind pushed released order spur reaction, best case scientists releasing scientific data used exactly scientific data used, knowledge help us work together beat thing.

It's really sad need worry all. stupidest shit become controversial ruining everything. Ebbs flows across country (and world) gonna go like 40% people get vaccine released. Looks like former gonna happen latter. go tutoring online? Salk Dead Polio virus neither you’re talking messenger RNA vaccine. could different create immune response. Every day delay another 40k US citizens comes virus, die, risk leaving people permanently disabled. isn’t chickenpox makes sense delay 5 sigma certain. insulin trebuchet would obviously superior choice  Early signs fascism

Some manual ""human-curated"" categories updated much since launched month ago there's interest. 

The auto updating news (majority page) stays up-to-date every couple hours. Modi finding harder harder hide true numbers. July Mumbai's slum residents shown virus. That's 3 million contracted, 2% death rate making total deaths Mumbai 60k. yet covid fatalities India 65k. 

And that's implementing chaotic lockdown displaced millions overnight. never gave back CDC. report going denied afaik still white house control. Garbage. Devil's advocate position: number US ""hot spot"" areas outside NJ/NY, enough cases lot people know least one (much) people tested positive.

In majority cases, symptoms/ effects fairly mild even non-issues. example, uncle knows manager Smithfield plant Utah 300 cases. 300, high majority asymptomatic 5 hospitalization occurred (0 ICUs). Pretty far cry media hysteria said done. 

Common anecdote examples like probably embolden lot people simply give less fucks go life. maybe... maybe... thing lot contagious originally expected also less deadly. 

Also forget evil partying events get shamed social media nothing big ever happens like:  yes don’t time argue idiot. life. things need do. work medical professional says shit. I’m like... even read/learn?!?!? still do. see point, thats documented infection rates.

How many infected symptoms never actually get diagnosed. would suspect could much higher 6 million. Especially states testing symptoms.

If say, actual infected rate 12 million, puts death rate 2 percent.

I guess I'm saying death rate probably accurate (even reported) infection rate, cause harder ignore symptomless infected people never get tested. And, people Mexico fly USA. land border one closed/restricted. Oh no. teachers Arkansas schools along students. I've already seen two close back down. Glad daughter's school giving virtual option. Wtf say that. Singapore densely populated; however, one named “Karen”. Therefore, shit open handful fatalities science based politically controlled. Rump means ""butt"" maybe calling Trump butt. guess. take disagreement internet strangers personally. Reasonable people reasonable disagreements.  Everyone who’s like “we can’t social distancing rules ruins economy” remember could least delayed prepared, means spending money, means taxes.  Sure will..... Man full sorts dumb shit thread. I'm exhausted this. grandfather died covid late April like literally last thing needed honestly expected outbreaks kids returning school. actively avoiding videos parties know it’ll make angry nervous scared sad. Again, best luck hope stay smart safe restrictions Sweden actually different rest Europe? There's persistent narrative they're nothing yet things bad I've read restrictions seem broadly similar Europe daily deaths cases also broadly similar recently Yup, district went said kid either distancing learning going school. make decision final. Juarez Mexico, top line doctors 100% best hospitality ever seen. People worked illegally informally months need pay bills buy food. saw government offering solution. country tolerated even 3 months lockdown. start seventh month seems others suggest every day.

So admit actually trying solve pandemic thing? Cool, we're page. Lmao. Michigan fan - he’s admittedly failure, overall, expected, ain’t going 0-6. 

That’s wishful thinking opposition. Or, horrible teacher hated job. assuming things. class everyone miserable. 250,000 excess deaths. scared reveal prez killed Americans htler.  advanced liver disease via lifetime drinking drunk manage contract COVID die, die of?

You died 97 die respiratory failure hospital, COVID kill you? 97 years planet kill you?

If COVID COVID induced respiratory failure, died COVID. Plenty people believe virus worse flu, tend political camp Trump et al. WH clearly treating virus flu. worst part comes money instead lives Time disband CDC. failed mattered most. may also pre-symptomatic. course, ultimately comes saving neglecting willfully ignoring externalities affects living beings. classic human behavior. 40 thousand students? 2 percent?

But month could 10 percent Yeah... schools ran like business opinion. HOPE people sit rethink society whole handles things schooling. But... seems like won’t happen. Convenient way instantly cut testing capacity half. Daddy proud. There’s much noise. It’s soo hard know information correct. virus bad told? conspiracy bring New World order? maybe fallout us globally understanding virus leaders simply thought right? idea believe read news anymore. It’s noise Yeah im sure parents can't afford sick days vacation days stay watch kid well Well labs responsible 100% everyone's testing? Yeah! like me! ambition I'm healthy horse! Idk, American would wary making mandatory especially rushed like Trump wants. still definitely plan get vaccinated. actually read article whatsoever??

I’d love can’t reason. However, coming Germany may understanding going through. Trump secretly admires dictators So, Bronchitis hit truck....it's truck killed you.

I already see defense drunk driver: ""**I kill person. run over, allergic pollen!!!**"" means doesn’t get fired going 0-6 year, sure think matters. think Helter Skelter counts though Jones 'successful' oof That’s beautiful photo  Yes. vulnerable likely take precautions, cases increase least vulnerable first. However, population spreads virus, likely break protections. Infections occur evenly, they're stratified social dynamics, take awhile individual get sick enough hospitalized, probably going get later community case timeline. 

The three sources delay are:

* new behavioral stratification risk vulnerable people get later
* course infection delay needing hospitalization death (people get sick enough need hospitalization right away, usually ventilator death)
* reporting delay hospitals health departments national reporting agencies

We've known months, people still get it. Well, metaphorically speaking correct. CNBC writing articles 10 year olds understand them. That's telling. Yeah, people put risk going game themselves. way making likely spread disease someone else could die it. 

Oh wait, except reality opposite that.  are. there's 4 year campaign discredit dissenting news sources ""Fake News"".  media messaging (or expert opinion) disagrees narrative dismissed outright.

The NYT reasonable writeup president's tweet removed. every time saw posted response ""The NYT makes everything"" What's going take people realize they're wrong? whole school infected? Online learning much better face face. totally understand harder people. first time anyone's done it. Remember smart phones came out? people hard time too? got tested UK. like 18 hour turnaround time. Top notch. Happy negative. It’s six months point would sex tf robot like like trucc arriv surprising thing vast majority people see refusing wear mask aren’t flat-earthers anti-vaxers, they’re university students.

They understand evidence. don’t care people get hurt. fastest effective safe vaccine ever developed 5 years. Believing chemical cocktail concocted 6 months double blind studies virus still learning laughable.

No fuckery all. Come join us, see yourself. also forgetting parents want keep kids home can't. Due certain spots taken away show up. everyone see it, obviously! agree there. quote verbatim makes happy.

""There reason walking around mask"".

Cloth surgical masks never danger short supply. encouraged wear. 

So hospitals overstocked masks? safe wear them? 

You really want say Fauci harm statements then? agree OP? 

Either admit walking around mask might make ""feel"" little bit better. upvote original post.

But dont blame public skeptical ""experts"" like Fauci saying.

For record wear mask. Bought cloth one immediately March. side effect foolishness people drive lives with. Constantly motion. Much like shark, people stop moving, they’ll drown. It’s incredibly unhealthy foolish feel cripple ones self like that. Ambition desperation removes ground peace rest. state wide certain cities?  You’re quack! Florida went really good becoming epicenter. colossal fuck up. can’t chalked little mistakes give break attitude. You’re nut case! reason virus bad people asymptomatic easily spread it. masks aren’t meant alternative people sick. you’re sick, yes stay fuck home. everyone else, *might* sick know it. wear damn mask. fair, 2+2=4 humans decided does. Numbers mathmatical operators arbitrary symbols assigned. said, quantity represented numeral ""2"" added always equal quantity represented numeral ""4"". come say they’re full remote already? US cases (and deaths) per day [Australia] total

And yet even posters totally fine this. Totally fine US approaching 200,000 dead.

Gross would never shame parents don’t choice. isn’t “choice” means can’t work lose everything. failure society right now. think people confuse Argentina much affluent country. real perspective world live sheltered little bubbles.

I really feel guys moment hope get bad! wouldn’t call 25,000 tickets “scarce”. 

I guarantee 25,000 tickets aren’t given, strictly, donors top-tier season ticket holders. closed properly beginning, could want do, like countries. Unfortunately, we've pandering people like since beginning, lead ""half-measures"", we're stuck. President played people like like fiddle. places vulnerable take steps protect them; schools regularly ban peanuts someone severely ill workplace well (additionally apples well... knew?). yes, agree, do, doing, continue protect deathly allergies, protect vulnerable population.

And yes, vulnerable disease last year. Know what's different last year? incredibly quickly propagating, relatively lethal, easily camouflaged virus causing ongoing pandemic.

The closest influenza. know flu? Flu shots. waiting coronavirus.

EVEN SO, original point people brought issues themselves, yet naming deadly allergies general saying fuck someone perfect health, die, care.

I one, glad society run selfish people like yourself. still understand whole thing ""CDC changed guidance get tested"".

The CDC's messaging make sense.

Two things happened *on day* ...

### updated guidance ""healthcare workers"" section site say people potentially exposed COVID, *necessarily* need get tested: **If close contact (within 6 feet) person COVID-19 infection least 15 minutes symptoms**: necessarily need test unless vulnerable individual health care provider State local public health officials recommend take one.

____

### updated guidance separate section site say precisely opposite, person potentially exposed COVID, *should* get tested: **Considerations get tested** People symptoms COVID-19 People close contact (within 6 feet infected person least 15 minutes) someone confirmed COVID-19 People asked referred get testing healthcare provider, localexternal icon state health department.

[Here Wayback snapshot 8/23 shows page looked like prior post **new** guidance two separate sections site, day, directly contradict other?

Which one supposed follow?

I understand media coverage happening focuses entirely first update ignores entirely. love sports really miss watching going games, always think quote (I think) Bob Costas (I'm paraphrasing may get quote exactly right), ""Sports important thing unimportant things."" 

I think that's pretty healthy mindset fan have, according mindset, absolutely right, worth people die football game. True, guess proper term would equally(tm) know guess meant media pushing back it. import india Keep mind lot stuff stopped replication process vitro. politely disagree. CDC: Dear Young People: TRYING ~~OVERT~~ COVERT PROGRAM (UN)CONTROLLED HERD IMMUNITY BECAUASE ~~ARE TOTALLY FUCKED~~ KNOW DOING. comparisons yourself. doesn’t show comparison.

You seem confused. Thank posting this. 

I think phrase says lot post-WWII post-reunification Germany: ""Germany, particular, shies away overly fast extensive restrictions free assembly relatively recent experiences dictatorship. ""

Note plural ""relatively recent experiences."" NSDAP defeated 1945. Hell, SED allowed free elections 1990, enabling West German system encompass Germanies. 30 years ago, peaceful. 

I'll interested see debate turns out. understand German's reluctance curtail USians would refer freedom assembly freedom speech, strike anti-constitutional behavior (German: Verfassungswidrig, recall correctly) , putting general public's health risk particularly responsible. 

With said, least visibly armed. looking photos, seem much like cross-section casually-dressed middle-aged Germans. 

For information first demonstration, see: words great president, greatest time :""Covfefe"" I'm fucking tired shit sub. Everything negative blindly voted straight top LITERALLY zero regard whether true not. 

That time July White House took hospitalization data CDC perfect example. I've read probably hundreds posts point flatly misunderstand misconstrue fact meaning White House control case data manipulating it. two separate jumps logic zero evidence each. White House never took control case data, hospitalization data. that's false, reporting data never changed. idea must manipulating also assumed zero actual evidence. We've seen headlines counterproductive shit Trump said done throughout crisis, I've never seen single solitary piece evidence administration actually tampering data. moronic everyone administration is, I'm pretty sure would found were. Plus real cherry top, real coup de grace, hospitalization data went BACK reported CDC, somehow every upvoted post sub managed argue ALSO bad. Fucking hilarious.

And course there's general idiocy every increase metrics anywhere obvious, natural result much suck country badly we've fucked up, every decrease metrics anywhere TOP SECRET GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY FAKE NUMBERS. fucking ridiculous sometimes feel like I'm reverse-The_Donald something. vibe used get cesspool - bunch assholes cherrypicking certain information events liked fit narrative completely ignoring and/or handwaving away vast amount evidence actual reality.

So no, ""very scary place"" Arizona right now. Jesus christ. Every metric trending MANY weeks now. Cases. Hospitalizations. Percent positive. R0. ICU usage. Covid-like illness. Deaths. Literally everything. week Arizona daily case numbers low since May state locked down. likely schools bars reopening probably turn around start increasing cases again? Sure, probably another spike kind late September October. hope responded faster earlier July one was. ""very scary place"". 

Also one Arizona ""self isolates"" summer. absurd idea. go house car inside destination. 115 degrees even slow anyone down. Oh shit Medicine Horse ever debate aside fringiest fringe? curve smashed Italy, way around, hard-hit regions sitting nice herd immunity threshold Yes places including cities NY TX overwhelmed “everywhere.” Yes healthcare system need improvement. 

Looking actual data anecdotes though, serious health concern it’s doomsday deadliest thing earth clickbait articles social media makes be. No, people blindly listening news sources intentionally running coordinated disinformation campaign. No, diabetes risk factor odds survival still high, say 45-64 years old, base fatality rate age alone 0.46% , say diabetes increase risk death 40% (see approximate risk adjustments) mortality rate 0.64% (0.46% x 140%) , chance survival still 99.36%. hope helps. 

IFR age: Law Biglaw’s Big Law Blog priority keeping 99 year old grandma alive another year.

I got twenty bucks making it. gotta choose twenty bucks functioning economy, well... twenty dollaz twenty dollaz. like choice China, see 1-child policy. prior COVID, get checked infectious diseases multiple times day?

Or new?

There infectious diseases COVID right? need stat's course. need remind people probably preexisting condition. could therefore die yet die Covid politically in-convenient keep deaths. administration find excuse avoid counting people, especially ramp herd immunity strategy failed Sweden. possible, I’d say unlikely NYC another major surge. end May seroprevalence 25%. 

They “got with” speak, since early pandemic 25% included lot high-risk population, therefore relative strain hospital system. Toronto went 30 cases 35

Oh noooo

Did lockdown?

You time, believe big guy!

Still answer Sweden/Peru/Canada population question huh?

Lol guess im forced wear shoes shirt, then. make safe virus, dumbass.

And average age. Gosh fair, indications seem Florida way first wave. metrics declining steadily weeks now. 

You could certainly argue US still midst first wave, definitely decline well, even that, currently perpetuated largely midwest, seeing cases rise simultaneously fall July ""problem children"" states. make sense regard general pattern spread far - first hit northeast March/April, well reigned late May 8 weeks later. swept across south southwest July, coming relatively control 6 weeks later, could pretty decent shape another 2 3 weeks. we'll see rise midwest August September - pattern holds, early November may recover well. 

Perhaps point ""first wave"" entire country over. think lot useful look terms specific regions instead terms entire massive USA, perspective, Florida indeed appears coming end first wave. never one first place, jackass response even me? Go bed, think need rest. Memorial day happen couple weeks cases started going also coincided country opening up. [As 4th July happened middle second spike rate growth positivity number actually started going 

And two holidays, we've also Spring Break, Memorial day, Mother's day, Easter, etc there's super clear pattern see analyzing holidays. accused doubling-down repression ethnic minority Uyghur population amid coronavirus pandemic, allegations include **coercing Uyghurs take Chinese traditional medicine**.

This true. forcing residents capital Xinjiang (Urumqi) take medicine. Xinjiang multiethnic society. [Guardian's capital forced take traditional Chinese medicine, handcuffed buildings ordered stay inside weeks part harsh range measures tackle coronavirus, according posts online.

Of course still human rights abuse. translating something like ""Trump forces Americans take HCQ"" ""Trump forces black Americans take HCQ amid BLM movement"" accurate.

In case wonder exactly medicine is. forced take Basically unproven drug like HCQ. meant taken prevent disease. Europe find censorship virus? Meanwhile, check numbers former ""hot spot"" states. CA/TX/FL/GA/AZ HUGE declines occurring naturally across board without new interventions lock downs. fraction deaths NY/ NJ experienced.

It's dirty phrase, eventually even sub going start talking herd immunity. K. wait 8 months. What's dog hoots? Herd immunity /s Cases US... someone residing Midwest, seriously depressing us getting ""hard hit"" already foregone conclusion. 

Like... could still stop fairly easily... there's 0% chance we're going to. hey! Here's hoping 3 months 400,000 deaths nationwide we'll finally ""other side"" nightmare! matter system rigged, Russia change results right price. fucking corrupt terrible. vaccine won’t widely distributed summer 2021. least. Florida still Florida. Science denying leadership. Unfortunately learned Covid uncover World’s Deaths deliberately downplayed people dying failure lungs counted Covid many die strokes,heart failure many complications Covid registered Covid Deaths happening Advanced Countries like USA UK rest G20 exactly places like China India South Africa many causes Deaths put Death Certificates Pneumonia instead Covid believe true number deaths many Hundreds Thousands figures Governments concerned Economy many Hundreds Thousands deaths  see shit Facebook daily. people stupid? wish lived somewhere smart people charge. Yep, buckle folks. Covid fresh science denying tinder burn through....and no, aren’t talking swipe right version tinder morons think young people immune.  Aw, little parrot well like brainwashed could wait months, get vaccine, make lots great memories without gambling life lives around you. die wear seat belt die wear one. Obviously seat belts work big seat belts trying make u use seat belts. sheeples. /s China enthusiastic country 97% respondents indicating would want vaccinated, Russia least willing 54% interested so, survey found. 

Neither figures surprise U.S., country highest number cumulative cases deaths, 67% respondents said would get vaccine

That's bit higher expected. Pleasantly surprised. fraction mean third per capita basis, sure. reality brigade isn’t looking favorably upon FL, TX, AZ, GA ignoring science allowing many citizens die.  luxury six month warning, makes sense would fair better, aren’t fairing better WA ground zero US listened science data. Somehow missed Tim Horton cashier's reply even though still get answer. 

First inevitable second one wasted effort first one work cases starting rise: playing ""what game"" now? Sounds fun. I'll join: 

What Argentina (locked going up)?
What Korea (locked going up)? 
What Spain (mobilized military lock going up)? 

Enjoy locked mom's basement then. Borders aren’t closed. live San Diego, family Mexico. cross every weekend. Maybe states closed CA border open ways. Sooooo trying make prior numbers look bad essentially Sorry, facts facts. cant blame covid someone died stage 4 cancer already death's door.

Edit: also care fake internet points. Neither facts. Get priorities line. Nice goalpost shift.

""Nobody making wear bra - guys okay""

I'd love see forcibly wear bra two heavy rocks them. Maybe know feels. “Literally almost 80 huh”, wonder get number. 

I used think “stupid Americans” myth. Tf Nebraskan see edit math, ty go full year social gatherings, eating friends, girls nights, family reunions, etc. lose fucking mind. 

Also isn’t Ebola. COVID .3% fatality rate people 50. half middle aged people know going back living normal life. Canadian here. think speak least huge number people looking outside hearing news like this, particularly attitude towards whole pandemic, pretty frustrating. see huge number comments also say same. Basically saying ""We know, news anymore"". frustration there. exists country - somehow seems like everyone's paralyzed helpless? maybe I'm reading wrong? could touch.

My question (and know tone interpreted wrong text, please understand genuine question criticism shape form): now? do? American people now? clear required? HIT contact transmissions, persistent virus small enclosed places like bathrooms. guys joking? Memorial day 4th July contributed huge spikes across country. 1st class Heath care care free life that. . measles.. also flesh eating virus popping here.  Dude, know guy claiming 6% deaths count ones attributed solely Covid without comorbidities. trying reason started talking Big Pharma running circles around different pediatricians regarding vaccination data, fluoride water causes autism. 

I almost pooped pants. University North Texas screwed us good Dude you’re risking killing family, friends, community. worth waiting literally year? scrolled thread got deja vu. soooo many bot accounts reddit insane. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people die without counted.. feel Yep. bad even deserve travel days. -.- funny uni sub watching people blame admins ever classes person first place knowing dumb college students would be. Like administration sat said treat students kids adults. 

No good answers many people stupid infect around them. longer trust CDC reliable source. needs removed sub.   can't comprehend difference provisional account own, thats still problem. Learn new words, big kid. Provisional counts provisional amount use find accurate number Covid SPECIFIC deaths. excess deaths, EVERY SOURCE relating Covid. seriously simple. spell gaslight believing false narrative. accurate fail see prideful acknowledge wrong. bet hard time hearing sitting bandwagon long. right. plan. way thinking. people literally see general population herd sheep, can't see problem letting virus ""wash over"" everyone. straight biblical level corruption we're witnessing government right now. Nope. whole dashboard changed. I'm guessing wear pink mask What, good hear us Nebraskansas? mom believes whip phone prove everything goes Trump said, still worth fighting get word out. certain point people going stop caring. It’s 6 months end sight fatality rate 50 absolutely minuscule. I’m going BBQ friends Sunday. masks, distancing. It’s worth it. Socializing, laughing, making memories = worth it. Life existing LIVING.

And get mad me, realize tens millions people thing. there’s reason — social animal. meant live lockdown something .3% fatality rate. got first dose moderna one, signed guinea pig. far good. days. got headache first night  get hired job go wearing sweatpants dirty shirt. Work dress code. Different real life. Nobody making wear bra grocery store. anywhere else. I'm right wing left Trump still manages make fucking hate right wings. need fucking democrat handle issues swear god right fucking autism comes political issues outside scope business regulation. number good number? Wow, packed.. 103 years old prior health issues. wasn’t Covid, would’ve something else months later. 

Dying 103 tragedy. lived long fulfilling life it’s over. That’s actually beautiful thing. there's law mean voluntary wear one considering often get hired job wear bra. Wouldn’t bad. would put us around population levels late 1800s. Human race could survive that.

I guess yes humanity know it. humanity would survive.  Nope Girlfriend’s firm cut pay across board every employee start pandemic. Bonuses compensation that, least case. still don’t equal lost wages. Again? 

Has learned nothing? long followers feel destroying liberal agenda; ""putting minorities thier place"" protecting white America

He starting White nationalist/ Fascist movement. Worst discovered Eastern European trick winning elections. suppres opposition fails rig election 

You might say I'm alarmist past 2 weeks gutted majority institutions credible election wasn’t COVID today would’ve something else months now. People die! will! Making 103 living happy life cause CELEBRATE. 3rd deaths per capita. really. many many things president doesn’t differently average person daily basis. Getting tested infectious diseases often necessary one things.

Having security detail another difference. access Marine One another. Taking flights Air Force one another. probably gets examined doctor weekly basis...I get physical per year.

I probably google list shit president required part “being president” different average person. shows severe lack regard people take seriously go Walmart understanding masks required. Wait wait wait. Lemme get ""For told can't treatment, think wrong,"" [Senator Rapert] said.

He’s upset couldn’t get medical treatment deemed appropriate someone else said bad? Well isn’t *crime humanity*.  Translation: 6% people infected Covid, perfectly healthy, died it. People infected existing illnesses died higher rate healthy people. news, data backs what's said along. Nobody even checks Google maps satellite images lol.

Also, what's sterilization, even true, gotta combating covid19? Good old propaganda. keep seeing quote carlin often year, memorized it. verbatim. It’s shit headline mouth breathers sub eat up. Cases states low populations like Iowa make half US. Right virus surging across states. “technically” virus surging states not. Cases still overall across US. mask wearing remind people practice disease **spreading** behaviour. 

So masks ;) access vaccine say average person 30... Biden win, interesting final 2.5 months office Trump. news true, weeks delayed. time around death toll lower, recently entered sheltered space old people’s homes increasing. even close number spring still concerning. 

Source: Worldometer  right make choice someone underlying condition getting older years?

Because life returning normal means people likely exposed eventually, people wanting get back normal, resulting pointless deaths media seizure yet again.

Here correspondence Emory doctors discussing possible causes: inflammation lung scarring haven’t read enough studies strong opinion it. processors. staff. older students. Everyone remembers random old dude college class That's good. guy suggesting positive thing happening college campus. That's wrong. Stop defending idea. Reported misinformation. It’s mortality case. AGED LIKE MOTHER-FUCKING MILK 💀 🥛  Thank you. People easily ignore bits google agree pushing. Lol. seen who's charge? Leader McConnell tried kill Obamacare Trump got rid pre-existing conditions mandate.

They literally plan hurting people point. ignoring conversation instead making naked appeal authority. also gave link authority this, give plenty more. even making appeal authority, authority says want. 

I guess done here, unless want start actually addressing points questions put forth? stop respiratory virus that’s highly contagious 40% experience symptoms 80% may no/low symptoms....in country 320 million people, 48 continental states 2 land borders? millions KNOWN cases already. island nation 5 million among harshest lockdown democratic country still cases reappear. 

That’s pure fantasy. need focus objectives realistic like ensuring healthcare system support (and diseases). Flattening curve made sense achievable without burning society ground. idea total elimination not. staff faculty, dumbass ? don’t even know means. think want debate something? Well maybe we’ll get little university heards get sick now, they'll better election.

if get better. 328 million Americans
65% herd immunity
1% fatality rate
2.13 million deaths need Google it. degrees it. *Emergency* trachs find obstructions. Trachs venting usually chronic issues. 

*Tracheotomy* emergency ""hole."" *tracheostomy* regards trach tube put in. interchangeable laypeople know they're talking about. would let go acting like knew talking about. Lol. Whatever, clearly you’ve made mind up. isn’t article topic. point, people need make personal choices based risk tolerance wear mask activities protect others. could go well next year. I’m going stop living life. Everyone know flown flies Delta keeping middle seats open 2020. I’m willing take risk stay home get back, even though CDC pulled guidance. mental health risk COVID healthy individual. you’d rather fly call. top moralizing rhetoric falling deaf ears everyday.

That seems suggest measures potential outcomes people talking ""around here"" extraordinary data we've seems suggests not.

It boils fact seems non-marginal risk contracting virus living life usual. still clear risk is, clearly higher general baseline risks people take everyday.

*Not* heeding warnings public health officials adjusting way live ""willingness take additional risk"" objectively stupid decision terrible gamble.

All shown casinos make much money. happen agree mean forgot said asymptomatic transmission rare, saying ""JK! actually enough data know, lol."" think I’m pro-trump? Lol! Look post history. I’m pro *reason*. Right, first thing could national mandate masks. may need penalties complying.

The second thing we'd need close non essential businesses contact tracing shown generates lot spread, indoor restaurants bars. 

We'd possibly illegalize parties.

For essential indoor businesses could set business bubble living expenses food covered. We'd pay people accept temporary isolation.

We'd implement heavier contact tracing identify locations problem.

We'd find unemployment rent forgiveness programs protect people lose set up.

Very quickly cases plummet. 

Once cases isolation. We'd quarantine test anyone entering safety bubble. 

But willing this. cases grow, we'd need sacrifice make happen.

I mean even national mask mandate yet. impossible, hard. America hard things though. comes ""long-term organ damage"" argument. EDIT: Bring downvotes. made 0.1% fatality rate without research something easily compare to. mean scare people exaggerated figure.

A 0.005% fatality rate would probably still worse covid least children. getting tired winning. Hope warrant that. Oh. Hes one them. Im surprised somehow am. let two ladies early, without testing point, seems like system (had) weak points. trying get addicts (drugs, alcohol, sex) follow rules? Forget it. easy imagine someone trying sneak fix, especially feel anything jetlag. Well, bots making sense guys. companies awesome thing called ""Unlimited PTO"" create workplace culture makes feel like take much time off, bad employee might get let go productive enough. actually end taking less time off. It’s necessarily need additional data vaccine approval, it’s data get helps. could still enough data approval September, Brazil SA trials go well. Unfortunately, get sick now, they'll better election. Right, evident trust NZers government, Argentina's governmental corruption, lack infrastructure, healthcare, etc. reflected *lack* trust.

A lot goes people trusting leadership, think easiest metric see lockdown NZ works lockdown AR not. warned... Ignorance bliss :) college hit 500 less two weeks Missouri. running study US studies Brazil, etc enough?

If enough, wait study US gets authorization? You’re bot one appointment autoimmune disease takes 4months

I mean, getting specialist care hard US too.

Not bad, live city, specialists book 1 month+ out. talking two different things.

The FDA willing approve vaccines emergency basis trials completed.

The interview subject would recommend vaccine. 

I agreeing person interviewed. vaccine properly vetted approved. Yep, probably. Still pretty brutal ask me. cut pasted quote, right CDC Lol explain pertains family getting help Another 45 guy. Talking used car salesman logic. point even trying speak guys. Total waste Okay dude, know better researchers NYT article, I'm convinced. Data reality itself. simplified representation reality. Countries count death differently, even advanced countries flawed data, frequent corrections European countries show. really pointless say ""X better 3 less deaths per million"". Even data perfect (it never be) many things could lead country deaths despite efficient combat system. even luck Oxford one. 

That's one AstraZeneca manufacturing, says vaccine, developed partnership Oxford University figured 1918

The 1918 flu coronavirus. It’s debunking myth kids can’t catch spread COVID. understand anyone support employer healthcare this. look history well.

Spanish Flu contributing factor Apartheid South Africa, white elites blamed native populations ""poor hygiene"" spread flu. flipside, Spanish Flu India gave *massive boost* Indian Independence Movement, people watched British waffle complete indifference, bumbling incompetence, malicious cruelty trying handle virus.

What stressors like accelerate change, good bad. doom gloom, depends social changes get boosted impetus this. people ""die Covid"" like obviously die car.

Yea, disease enough mass cause blunt force trauma. Nobody expecting analogize two level abstraction. 

What else like hit car? thrown superman one?

Both sources CDC, btw. ..which creates 80% world's health advancements. Thank you! recorded cases since early April September 1  It’s zero-sum. It’s either one infected everyone infected. Look countries still infections managed “contain” virus relatively speaking. Stop fear-mongering.

Edit “Containment” context means contained within capabilities local healthcare systems. metric looking at. would expected larger spike, especially month ago nearly week protests tens thousands protesters without masks social distancing. say true toll pandemic much higher reported figures, due limited testing, missed mild cases concealment cases governments, among factors.

Maybe Putin vaccinated instead daughter, seems high risk category. Nothing going change month, 2 months, 6 months. Even year unlikely things substantially different today. Starting get tired winning. Excess deaths too, though. Right - logical people understand this. People wanting meme fit narrative refuse to. Ignorance accept. Willful ignorance cannot. Indeed, looking excess mortality US passed Sweden already July. need add approx +40% reported deaths US cover excess mortality Sweden’s reported numbers actually high need subtract -8%. Excess deaths US approx 214k first august. One could claim would hard disprove based decisions made. Forgive pessimism, afraid least cutbacks essential immigrants. proven, however. 

But said, even accepted official numbers ignored excess deaths, Peru median age 28 871 deaths per million reached herd immunity, surely European country median age 40+ 500-600 deaths per million reached it. driving crazy tbh. ARDS, sepsis, kidney failure, pneumonia etc- result virus! people keep missing that? takes years develop vaccines.

And vaccine projects ultimately fail.

You obviously want ignore that.

There good reasons things come quickly.  Trump cheerleaders want completely disregard reality vaccines, everything else. I’m done 😆 review, scientists trusted complicit mass murder nobody ever trusted again. (Adjusts tin foil hat) We’re dark point. OP deleted account. knowledge Denmark never regretted opening schools. People brainwashed thinking anything could remotely considered ""socialist"" one step closer death camps. Even though countless people currently die needlessly current system. country goddamned stupid hate much. China January early February. place staying one places soft barricade. asked tell leaving going/if planned coming back neighborhood. also denied going certain hotels Chinese concerned tourist bopping around China higher chance visiting multiple areas China. redirected international travelers hotel. Temperature checks walk buildings / hotels. None spoke totalitarian people concerned could get sick something big unknown. 


There highly questionable things wrong, hardly see general population given enough credit trying safeguard communities other. community dumb, called out. 


If taken seriously China March could pretty much done September. cheap fly dont care fly. winter seeing $40 flights florida. Crap like people BC vandalized cars Albertan plates. aint fucking justifiable target fellow Canadians crappy provincial health policies inflame people's behaviors. Shocker  lie trump working hard get vaccine out.. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 1) individual behavior changes 

2) still don’t understand difference “could” prediction I’m sorry you’re going through. system? Healthcare shitshow. want dang cavity pulled, really put maybe able afford insurance next year. see importance paid sick days die new viruses. close 7x. means 2000 new cases day Iowa equates 14,000 new cases day Florida. Oxford Pfizer releases October want get it?  going suck friends get vaccinated sitting sure got placebo. Also Pfizer releases US continues current trend decreases could waiting enough control group get infected. Don’t know hanging pole stoning part.. wait vaccine rolled out.

They might never happen. Eventually going learn live virus. stalk locked forever. Yeah, seems like DNA pan theory. possible could missed relevant DNA, possible someone caught Covid returning traveller, never developed symptoms, infected someone community.

There source material check. heard would take 3 years herd immunity still possitility since never achieved herd immunity anything yet administration even sign mask order, they're going that. Would cost probably lol  brother VP research hospital. He’s also volunteer subject vaccine trials. false claims trump administration driving getting people killed. Probably people America since reddit american centric, people aware managed. imagine plenty people uk upset boris johnson really train guys use broken English too

Sloppy, someone needs pull Karen ask speak Putin need big brother muslims something /s said masks important public need wear mask interview. great way inform public!
Why covering him? statements contradict OP arricle claiming? 
So either Fauci telling lies, OP is. 


If take literally dont take Fauci's statements literally instead going ""well meant say...."" ppe short supply blah blah blah.

Either lied wrong. sounds like think lots dead injured people wrong! Welcome Iowa, overpopulation problem doctors physical therapists respiratory therapists reeeeally bored. They're going fix tha! even individual towns villages erecting homemade barricades keep anyone coming out.

That welding residential buildings doors too. subreddit refuse accept cases steadily declining past month lol. It’s like soon US sees decline new cases percent positive top posts switch “Coronavirus cases rising states” point would never weekend trip extremes response around country COVID odd really showing fractured not-so-United States become. Living New England reading stuff like this, sounds like different world. I'm warning country pretend pandemic, especially directed Trump diseases even close severity. One causes severe muscle damage basically flu people. I'm vaccines, one I'll take hard pass there's years data gathered. deliberately ignoring phase 3 trials run purposes seem unwilling educate them. ""an arbitrary desire"". point time vaccine would functional safe use society. That's actually well end phase 3 trial. comes COVID coverage, Florida annoying kid everyone hates school says dumb things, goes every party still gets OK grades.

NY, NJ, CA harsh lockdown places kids act smart, never exit houses, still perform extremely badly despite hard work.

Press coverage mostly aimed annoyed MSM Florida fairly OK even though opposite recommended. ""This facts science nothing dispute""

&amp;#x200B;

NO. literally hospital admin choice (not facts science) write COVID conditions upon death stemmed covid. says less 9k died covid. rest covid pre-existing conditions. die covid, died causes covid. difference.... cant blame covid someone dying stage 4 cancer already death's door... Pretty sure hit nose. America afraid socialism? I’m Canada don’t get wrong lot flaws system, biggest thing take children emerge it’s god forbid something severe, won’t end mortgage house save them. Hell wasn’t unnecessary ambulance ride won’t even bill meant say where. Weird autocorrect that. good thing mentioned things 2nd time WOULD died. nurse midnights obs HDU. realised unconscious asleep. Two Drs 2 hours cannulas stuff stabilise me.

I vaguely remember slurring one Dr repeatedly asking name -- Joe. 

The next morning - woke unsure dreamed it. checked arms - cannulas. Checked medical waste bin room saw emergency stuff used me. Weirdly felt OK

A big wake-up call dangerous be. Florida seven times many people Iowa problem here. I've said before, think need seriously talk effect healthcare outcomes barring family hospital rooms better equip hospitals support virtual visits really safe option. understand doctors things hold iPads play IT, think medical community long discounted massive effect mental health family play recovery sheer live. Lol stop rational people. coronavirus lockdown shit modicum power granted lives  still getting it. severe covid get respiratory failure respiratory issues, maybe sepsis well. CAUSED covid many also list along covid death certificate. 

.

Covid caused conditions. hospitals wrote covid, THAT'S ADMIN CHOICE write conditions upon death. people preexisting conditions, 94%. also overweight medical standards pre existing condition half america has.SO 5'10 190lbs, pre existing condition. know anyone 5'10 190 looks like die weight. Plus ruined education careers.. I'm lucky af whole family finished classes graduated college right summer. can't imagine going thru rn would cause havoc school provide online courses Well, we're sending whether safe not! agree. It’s weird speaking terms success story we’re talking death tolls matter high low is. Take look OPs post history. I'm sure. point know placebo real vaccine? saying half truths ... El Escorial hospital one hospitals treating cases covid, even first wave. interview several weeks ago 30 days reopening mobility within country, look today cases admitted community Madrid rest Spain. situation collapsed, right track every 15 days doubling admitted. doctor statements wanted create controversy viral succeeded. suppose sold many books, interview shared massive way. television Spain, researchers Mont Sinai, CSIC real expert doctors interviewed statements never gone viral. masks social distancing work nothing worry .. 😷😆 Moderna me. Again, medical source told this. wrong. Masks effective preventing sick people spreading others, masks still somewhat effective preventing catching covid others. Even cheap surgical masks cloth masks. ""Somewhat effective"" becomes extremely effective large percentage people use it, due viruses spread. go fact check lots friends family stuff see internet coronavirus. I've asked probably 6 7 times last days. getting pushed everywhere people big followings too. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

QUARANTINING *EVERYONE* REALISTIC?? Yeah exactly this. 

Some parents choice, think really big problem. think person's earnings less x dollars eligible sort child care service service could partially paid employer (perk)
Yeah know, fantasy land living in. countries systems place pro family totally ""slave machine"" tax dollars goes towards plus education health care.


 course nuclear weapons better investment /s Workers sacrificed alter Economy great recommendations places taking seriously. Many places haven’t suffering total 6 5 deaths? know? (though think guess). TIL worked hard miss point.

She going recommend product trials completed.

Why lower standards based upon arbitrary desire speed up?

What's irresponsible releasing vaccine ready. Unfortunately many people opposite. follow old friend Instagram flying CA, FL, CO several times month visit friends flights cheap. say medically bankrupt?


I heavily debt time. Depending results operation looking 6 10 weeks without revenue. generously offered sick pay off, even get salary insurance (you need employee certain amount time that). basically offered share risk: took risk paying nothing, took (very low) risk work 2 years (I made much money self employed). started working part time could even get grateful them.


I pay cent medical treatment, still regular follow-ups. 


And ask: yes, 6 figure salary debt bad management part. kept standard living even 2nd kid (traveling world, 2-3 months vacation yearly, working 4 days week). We've slowed since.


I know hard believe civilised countries people there, hey, say...


Edit: free healthcare, universal healthcare : pay taxes. ""Free healthcare"" ""pro-life"": prevents people thinking properly. Sure, live Guatemala. heard lockdown related extrajudicial killing anywhere Latin America though. poster Philippines it, unfortunately, makes sense. That's hilarious. expect? play fire, get burned. Mess bull, get horns... Open schools kids get Covid... Duh! Look, odds anyone reading this, see this:
You forgiven. Isolate yourself, contact doctor cooperate public health officials. made mistake, help stop this. love you, lives others hands. Maybe let crash. country world issue... widespread anyway.  feeling President low understanding science, people would nearly comfortable coming woodwork spewing nonsense. We've sure made great alright... said. exactly saying.

It's not. before, now. Repeating make excuse mediocrity, excuse people supposed doing, even lockdown.

And goalposts absolutely excuse allowing people starve abundant food.

You might think that, mean that's world works. work way *before* COVID, certainly start now. naive belief mean get wash hands real-world consequences policies support. It’s high number

But good headline, entire point. born causes 100% deaths. Everyone else regretted opening schools. hope Unless get vaccine. again, exactly point. Really silly blame people complying government's amazing plan. Locking country informal economy social safety net one stupid ideas planet. Massages paid per appointment always operated appointment system. Gyms paid charging obscene monthly memberships lare groups people. Gyms always crowded. going pay 65/month golds gym get ""work out"" 30 minutes 2x/week, get reservations?

Not saying open, solo reservation system workable. answer hard lockdown taxpayer funds support SMALL business (not Kanye Ruth's Chris). ship sailed, economic harm much worse.

Stonks great though, worry. hotter areas tending higher UV levels? known severely reduce amount time viruses survive surfaces outside ? rate, There’s silver lining. couple decades could fat credit US, speak. imminent threat people avoid living healthy lifestyle, choose take obvious risk thanks CDC findings  phigured Cases like matter much deaths. People acting like I'll safe get realize I'd rather lose % lungs' usage. 

Kinda like let kids smoke, let kids adults get possible lung damage otherwise? Antivaxers like:


😒 *thousands studies made show vaccines safe 

😏*one document since discredited saying vaccines might linked autism 



Yeah, sorry horseshit. public care facts. They've become enamored lackadaisical lifestyle theyre used to, reject science evidence, feel ENTITLED live life they've always lived, reguardless cost society. second third disease, far deadly, silent, communicable could appear tomorrow, half US roughly 8th world change damn thing lifestyle accommodate it. 


It might radicalization politics, might years relative peace world had, might previous generation absolute chicken shit thinks denial solve problems (I mean fuck worked global warming it?) whatever is, cancerous, needs stop. Looking dots image looks like 2 days ago, 4 days ago, 7 days ago 2 11 days ago.

I think could Sunday 30th, Friday 28th, Tue 25th 2 Friday 21st (unless made mistake here) thank you, again, demonstrating level intelligence one expect met presenting views others sub want hear. much better enduring long term paranoid endless state (in America) right now. first thought gonna install 25000 ventilators improve airflow something. edited comment clarify I'm actually SWFL (Lee county), could see would cooperation area like yours. point is, unless someone better ideas February, can’t used argument Trump badly. It’s Monday morning quarterbacking. course know more. years probably apparent even stuff wrong. wrong.

I give pass lot given something never faced before. different experience definitely due location. live downtown Boston I’m surrounded university students. big vote number could dont see close need gym that. definitely 100% accidental drops. work grocery store people would put refrigerated item top refrigerator unit instead it. That's fair sound point. I've upvoted this.  Given median stay death nursing home residents 5 months, would say safe assume. I'm European know FDA works.
I know FDA explained last month parliament rules approval data needs, maybe could look information.

Take mind trials made outbreaks stronger and, moment, US outbreak greater Europe. ? 

The study sent concluded day 86, believe? saying observed anything 6 months? 

But agree, discussion serve much purpose. believe general lack cooperation contact tracers could contributing factor. Many folks either avoid us treat us like nuisance. Fauci said need think medical community talking masks

But left part out

See works? go anywhere near anyone wearing mask wear face covering times.

A good decision. It'll probably go sometime next year get vaccine forgot put sarcasm tag. hoping wording would convey that. we're doomed yes, types deaths often statistic another disease. use disease numbers understand issue relative terms. important honest statistics. top that, fuck say someone's 6 months, year, two years, whatever line draw mean anything?

In end simply give shit anyone else desperately trying sell idea ok ignore pandemic. want able asshole acting like something noble. not. piece shit. Haha, well thanks laugh guess. WEAR GORGET. 6% different Covid deaths. 

It’s death certificate didn’t whatever reason (for ex: autopsy, under-funding, overwhelmed Covid cases spike) get filled properly actual *cause* death — ARDS, pneumonia, stroke, sepsis, organ failure — killed person. 

Covid underlying cause doubt based positive test, didn’t fill properly. It’s pandemic: like USPS, they’re probably understaffed due illness extra busy because: Covid. White knights Fauci 2020  perceive shortcomings? balance horrific illness death? dead children, dead people total. People die flu every year nothing new. justify everything closed. offence, I’d like think common know actually have. 

And isn’t media dividing us. It’s opinions fundamentally differ mine. 

I use eyes ears figure conservative anti-vaxxers conspiracy theorists morons. aware long term damage covid does?

Do realize even though probably won’t die, long term quality life seriously impacted? Good you. wish people thought safety at-risk loved ones enough change actions. Yup Yea, none hospitalized, isolated. Enough enough ""It's joke!"" ""I'm asking questions!"" PM I'd announce border closed Nov 4th pending new information. many people charge ridiculously simplistic worldview world insanely complex. solution constantly adapt evolve, refuse admit they're wrong. Mine too! Go Falcons!!! 🤩 They've months now. excuses. totally get 100% school infected closing btw Donald Trump never told public inject bleach

He merely questioned efficacy 

Also, prolife team working hard content policies matter. don’t care much understands long lets we’ll-qualifies people run show backs 100%. 

Unlike current guy supports Fauci death threats. guarantee lot people statistically good chance dying time frame anyways. Fauci phrases like would alive anyone common sense knows true. wanna see came conclusion would alive still. Thats all. selfish planet doesn’t come health! Right, r/Coronavirus!? 190,000 deaths, pshh big deal. murder one person knife everyone freaks out. think there's reasonable scientific, non-political explanation: know many trial participants need make statistically valid conclusion. depends many people mixed placebo/vaccine group get infected treated. We're effectively chasing thing around world trying watch many people get unseal trial fact none statistical twins vaccinated group (hopefully) get means something.

So want conduct trials everywhere hopes catching thing many times possible propagates unpredictably irregularly world. faster find it, faster determine whether thing works way think does.  right, pushing released faster ever before, right reservations come made possibility vaccine might dangerous (based example live virus vaccine created nearly 70 years ago causing outbreak different disease), completely ignoring fact country working vaccines. Let's say Oxford gets vaccine testing done ready approval October, take vaccine seeing made country current administrations ""politicizing""? Yeah, soon get challenged court I'm afraid. thanks federal help, millions people fucked. [Here's explain SHIT study showed face shield + mask reduced infection rate 0%? ever spiking fall kicks gear place world trouble. like game musical chairs. states go colder indoor months starting high numbers face additional challenges. doesn’t even make sense. Like intentionally carrying it? America. dont care choices effect others. ever heard freedom?? Biggest failure testing outset... delayed taking seriously wanted control information flow order control messaging bc fucking delays. made whole thing much worse. data important approval US? happens millions kids dead end school year? proven dangerous kids elderly post removed because:

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Treating kids like (low) wage employees. Fits. online learning better face face? get argument it’s safe substitute, universally educators, parents, etc. said person better. 

Say student struggling, teacher know? send tests homework? case happens, teacher address? separate virtual meeting said student? side chat them? class walk desk interact student individually.

Then situations requiring interaction? Conference calls always shitty this, people talking other, people afraid jump teacher talking communication gap...not easy good. Interaction key facet education especially younger years complex topics.

This even considering technology limitations poor, like slow internet, lack devices, parents able stay home supervise, etc.

Schooling person better continue. needs safe possible given Covid constraints. Garbage data in, garbage policy out. way Florida massages, twists, edits, tweaks data, never claim made policy based ""data"". 🎶🎵You AIDS🎵🎶
 
🎵🎶Not HIV full blown AIDS🎶🎵 emails, text, calls school district anything else life. handled fine. Clhs? Hunger motivate people break lockdown regulations? Kind obtuse take there. What? seen much time spend charity events, giving money, government regulations, laws, countless things order prevent deaths? wearing mask social distancing prevent cancer. Cancer spread. thing even comes close flu kills way less yearly vaccine. course people count zero anyway world. top know flu. know COVID anywhere near like know flu. imperative take precautions grip hopefully includes vaccines. mean time monsters like downplaying deaths helping. simply horrible human being. Easter Sunday. Pretty sure schools get every Sunday off. Never heard school getting good friday off, except friends catholic school, makes sense. school spring break week Easter last year, Easter too, think plan around Easter. 

I think article sums Christmas federal holiday pretty well. anyone spec common sense wouldn’t figure beyond me. No. shitty consequences. better country mitigated little effectively that’s now. However, consider shitty consequences better alternative dying suffering possible long-term complications something relatively controllable. woman 40s town hospitalized pre-existing conditions died yesterday covid. Scary. risk low mean non existent. Fair enough, read question asked answered. suspicions trump, disastrous attitude somehow spun rallying cry come November. vaccine successful watch take credit pushing approval despite scientific objections cautious. That's real lockdown looks like though. time people would allowed explicit permission. happened work another city, they'd asked move go back forth two cities. final piece puzzle tracking, even free country like South Korea did. like CCP much next guy, local government things, it'll effective.

&amp;#x200B;

It's late US though. effective early stages. Relevant article:

[Hygeine theater huge waste *phew* minute thought thing exaggerated. Dr Doom came surgery time! states go initial explosion level thanks careless people becoming infected thus immune. Arizona proved true, there's zero concern South Dakotas eventual trajectory. That's thought well, want wrong Reddit jump throat. One thing saw states hit particularly hard COVID, doctors filling commodities simply sheer volume death reports filling daily.  Yeah people minds made since early in. friend went back work 2 3 weeks ago, caught week one, received positive results yesterday back home. wears mask! Lives Matter Maybe FDA asks test US. Every countries read data accept results.
More trials, data less doubts vaccine entirely resuming life. also people's lives. Unless regularly test level currently able US, way ensure I'm carrying spreading disease people. bodies able resist - science yet determine gets bad ends ICU dead, gets fine. data, acting though virus exist could also mean people catching virus dying direct result actions. want indirectly kill people. also want catch virus seems pretty random chance either big deal, months-long battle potentially impacting quality life months years come (data recovered covid survivors show pretty gnarly long lasting effects). could die. sure, life comes lots risks weigh avoid, risks measured steps taken reducd risk, like wearing seatbelt installing airbags. tobacco alcohol consumers know harming bodies certain level intake accepting risk - key differences self-harm also carry risks others (except drunk driving, would consider level irresponsible selfishness traveling around wearing mask pandemic). difference risk known measureable. covid. data lacking, gamble. gamble (or drink much... smoke tobacco). want live long, healthy, happy life, love life. staying inside/wearing mask helps avoid unmeasured risk longevity quality life, also protects people. can't indefinitely want life return normal be, data covid tools fight survive disease (because no, human body ""made survive viruses,"" that's modern medicine for) risks simply worth it.  happens get car accident covid? considered covid death well? Holy crap, think easier kid dressed sitting desk pay attention take quizzes, vs home bed asleep? kids? long taken away state? God state fucking stupid vaccine proven effective, lot 30% change minds. people, like anyone else, want go back work, go back sports games, go back traveling, etc.

I'm sure society create pro-vaccine campaign. sports athletes give commercials something. really hoping results good! apply selected. assume literally left house total 7 times last 5 months, get groceries. looks like trials Raleigh too, great we've getting around 200 new cases day small city. I'm willing take soon released public. Or, horribly, thrush. far move goalposts sidestepping dishonesty? Covid 19 flu arent even same. Covid literally 10 times deadlier 50 times contagious. Hahahahahaha. put effort telepathy, considering aggregate impact life expectancy, wave hand say ""poverty""? Well 180,000 Americans died beheading burglars samurai swords 2020, damn right I'd panicked sleeping steel gorget on. didn’t plan back March. March recommendations started 2021... Yes, right, middle ground rabid hoaxers strawman hoaxers peddle.

That's called entire sane world is. got 190,000 dead.

You're 5 minute mark Green-Bay Packers v Springfield under-5s. Covid still lot gas tank like teacher tried cover ass saying question ment start conversation, like phrase hasnt played death lately. Teacher moron.  news story? mean going happen. First day, second day, everyday. many new deaths? Mexican border open. It’s closed non citizens non legal residents. rest us it’s pretend closed. Yeah, one demonising influenza circulating moment either: people need cautious, need feel afford cautious.  Whe there's vaccine? half country comorbidities due shitty healthcare system... most. cult certain someone tell anything justify supporting dear leader. Americans hypertension.

- Hypertension listed CDC one comorbid causes death. Hypertensive diseases are, come nowhere near 45% cases, instead representing 21.8%. obviously work simply listing everyone high blood pressure. 

- biggest comorbid cause death far Influenza/pneumonia, present 42%.

Skip Thanksgiving Christmas case might picked something work? one did. concerned risks like everyone else negative consequences unlikely effect you. collectively society decided acceptable risk old people catch flu knowing would die it. thing slightly higher risk factor. knew efficacy even homemade cloth masks breadth asymptomatic spread masks shortage healthcare workers, yeah. 

The way done poor. valid reasons statement. believe recommend mask sick, even then, N95 workers needed. It’s ok, many idiots around. helping natural selection even playing field. FDA courting disasters mixing politics science. feel like I'm probably making 103 cost?

I know patient need pay anything COVID related treatment government still need settle expenses. Hefty amount, too. article says enough results determine till November, indications October. 

Fauci I’m particularly concerned,” Fauci said. “But don’t want lack severe concern get way keeping open mind look possible deleterious effects get phase-three trial.”

He also says timetable making available doses masses shows 60% efficacy early 2021, rollout late year, that's optimistic view.

You read articles, headlines. crazy stuff. Like six different ideologies across spectrum rolled one. Probably happen, honestly, CDC corruption living case study now, never know government agencies do. 18 months estimation. vaccine reaches phase 3 whatever reason participants don’t get adverse symptoms literally means it’s ready public. 

If Trump willing throw supporters bus make go faster I’m it. what? We're saying diseases kill people now? Seems like splitting hairs here. Death certificate would usually say complications due ___. intents purposes regular human understanding level makes sense say 'he died cancer infected coronavirus he's dead.' hasn’t vaccines developed approved corona virus. optimistic, cutting-edge science can’t forced always produce results desire preferred timeline.  forget Spain country? medical system works great multi millionaire. answer questions. Oxford vaccine currently ready approval per medical experts though. insufficiently tested currently process. fear Trump pushes FDA arbitrary date vaccine rather listens scientists. world vaccine ready, I'll get it. everyone else saying ready America is, suspicious. Trump totally corrupted CDC. trust FDA? Browse r/coronavirus lately? Cases spiking again. Sarcasm. FDA bowed Trump COVID-19 survivor plasma, every new treatment approved fulfilled requirements regarding safety, efficacy, risk-benefit ratio favor patient, based condition. Whatever make pipeline market fulfill least one requirements, get approved, discarded. need worry anymore. Everything gets approved meets rigorous scientific standards worldwide medical scientific community agreed to, keeps revising regularly.

That said, consider FDA compromised (Hahn's) decision issue statement praising administration hours start RNC everything humanly possible produce treatment (while Trump calling Sars-CoV-2 hoax Democrats, predicted would magically go away, stopped caring soon statistics started showing communities hit hardest), endorsing treatment use individual patient supply last ditch effort months actually supported trial data today, recent effective ""breakthrough"" support Trump's election campaign. effectively undermined credibility everything touch Hahn removed. Actually, UK ""blinked"" backed herd immunity plan well hospitals overwhelmed.  time locking down, daily fatality rate 100 - hospitals \*preparing\* huge surge cases time nowhere near overwhelmed. \*did\* lockdown (and pretty effective cutting transmission), even peak, hospitals (with exceptions able offload hospitals) dealing relatively comfortably influx.  

That said, initial flirtation herd immunity almost certainly cost 10,000 lives, credibly argue UK death figures would 50% lower we'd ever started road.  

If US go ""herd immunity"", I'd astonished end blinking too. Trump charge \*will\* probably wait see hospitals overwhelmed happens.  assume work. anti body immunity lasts weeks months never achieve herd immunity. Given cases reinfection popping confirmed, 2020 I'm holding breath. think issue what's driven science/health (yes, we're moving faster, sheer necessity moment) what's driven electoral politics (hearing President exerting influence independent agency rush vaccine he's successfully compromised CDC already). reasons fasttrack Covid vaccine, election dangerous one. Fauci pretty consistently said early Q1, optimistically end year. I'll believe says October far says rushing could lead us abandon best candidate cost lives.

It's limited US.  herd immunity works resilient disease season two infection. I've seen 3 confirmed reinfection cases last weeks means may even viable approach. Competency finest house care... People really pay $500 stuff like OUTSIDE hospital? Gov Rona DeathSentence lives name.  + evolution. Interesting

Since pope [**Pius catholic church (representing 50% christians worldwide!) accepts evolution valid explanation. 

Only ""extremist sects"" deny it. vocal christians US sects... better anyway flu vaccine. vaccinate others reduce spread too, plus even effective, reduce symptoms, etc. help. Less years match poor though. guesswork every year. think right way go test capacity. great FHM taking small steps help return ""normal"".

To people think bad, think situation right untenable longer periods time? new advice enables kids mild symtoms, like slightly runny nose, sniff nasal congestion example, return school safely say carrying Covid-19. letting kids spend much time school possible, I'm that. I.e. step return pandemic.

Then there's allergies. contagious, lets severely allergic kids return school show got Covid-19. great news them. 

Of course, kid coughing fever, kept home. That's common sense course general rule pandemic well. Anyway, that's new advice about.  I'm Belgium although already experienced something second wave outcome radically different first wave.

First wave daily new cases (around peak): ~1500

First wave daily deaths: ~300

Second wave daily new cases:~750

Second wave daily deaths: ~12

(See graphs here: France seem similar position.

If widespread testing asymptomatic explanation means second wave actually like small ripple. increased testing cause, means recovery outcomes improved, unless young people somehow catching disease without spreading vulnerable members society.

Thanks black friday gonna cause PTSD.  dip while, states falling still. problem loosening restrictions, schools, summer coming end, spreader events like sturgis starting come fruition. change trajectory soon, many states going see infection rates blossom pretty quickly. article available Norway. assume Europe. anyone tldr? near impossible America eradicate virus. stay around common flu. remain shut flying rest world years come. early vaccine worst thing could possibly do. way people take experimental vaccine. TBH happy dont wear point. looking numbers considering school started today, really believe hold. mandatory universal masks probably question mere weeks knows long remain time. That's accurate comparison all. Death certificates car crashes say shit seat-belts. comment making direct comparison. People die Covid dying pneumonia organ failure comes sick Covid.

The wording study made sound like ""only 6% Covid deaths happened previously healthy people"", actually meant was, ""in 6% Covid deaths doctors clue virus killed patient list anything."" get people, pay them, vaccine trials get vaccine also ingest Covid-19 facility? Shit would faster. 320 million people US, approaching 6 million positive tests.

Fuck guy... Fauci political though... better way measure it? Teeeelllllll it!
Those so-called safety-nets small part taxes too, compare areas taxes funding.

This clearest graph could find, divvy-up might changed. I’m posting wrong info, please correct gotta say, graph correct... going Social Security aware I’m happy about.

But 7% going education. ☹️  leaves us inactived vaccines Phase III, work?

Which ones those? Children transmit Covid virus less adults adults children, according investigation led Vall d'Hebron hospital analyzed cases disease registered minors Catalonia 31 December. may.

Among 89 families data obtained analyze coronavirus entered homes, three cases registered infections originated minor. Specifically, two 17-year-old adolescents 5-year-old girl started three 89 family outbreaks.

The risk contagion schools low ""if measures applied properly,"" says Fernando Simón.

In 52 cases, first case family adult 34 possible find outbreak started.

The results offer ""a message tranquility"" regarding reopening schools, says Pere Soler, head Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit Vall d'Hebron hospital director research. warns reasons transmission coronavirus varies depending age unknown.

The research project continues today, collaboration primary care pediatricians, analysis Covid cases minors diagnosed since June 1. Additional data obtained beginning course allow determine precision risk contagion educational centers.

The results far line studies conducted countries, also indicate minors transmit coronavirus less adults. Also, Kids Corona study Sant Joan de Déu hospital, based experience summer camps Barcelona area, shown coronavirus transmitted less among children among adults.

""They complementary studies,"" says Soler. “The Kids Corona analyzed risk transmission one child another. focused risk transmission children adults, thinking people work minors teachers ”.

The decision carry study made “when saw Covid different effects flu children,” explains director research. ""It made us think initial idea children could super contagion, like flu, could wrong."" idea led closure schools Spain countries. ""In addition, large increase cases nursery primary education personnel,"" would expected children super contagious.

With data available now, “we clear measures applied properly, probability transmission \[of virus schools\] negligible,” declared Fernando Simón, director Center Coordination Health Alerts Emergencies. Ministry Health. measures include proper hygiene distance schools commitment families take children school possible symptoms Covid.

Vall d'Hebron's research confirms coronavirus affect children age causes unspecific symptoms. include fever 60% cases, cough 49%, fatigue 40%, respiratory distress 31%, gastrointestinal symptoms abdominal pain, diarrhea vomiting 20%. ""As specific, symptom compatible viral infection child make us suspect may Covid"", warns Soler. schools teach norms society.

Authoritarianism starts schools. Follow rules, punished. 

I teacher middle school decided marked something wrong correc, change it, ""fair"" wrong marked correct, get changed either.

Then grades went letter grade made many ""mistakes"" marking papers, complained guidance counselor (showing tests), tests homework property allowed take class turned graded (she collected end class). 

Administration nothing proof. physically ran class early test show mom.

If mom willing go school board, would suspended ditching class. Mom raised stink proof test, teacher finally to!d fix errors correcting let students take graded material home.

But lesson school tried reach powerless face authority. got told figure angered teacher appease her. mom willing fight education, would either given eventually failed class, learned appease power looking outside help pointless.

Most kids mom !one move. faults, education important her, proof all, would go chain me,


I suspect dress codes less distracting teenage boys find clavicles bare shoulders versus distracting girls find body parts boys, teaching kids police women's bodies men. might meant hey, employers care manner, teaches. Yes, is. Honestly, think probably issue completely overwhelmed coroners and/or people responsible filling death certificates (bear mind literally done Justices Peace Texas example) time expertise determine \*\*which method\*\* Covid used kill 6% positive test knew Covid.

Here's Law Order analogy: ""We know Jack Ripper killed Bob stabbing chest witness saw two enter room Jack left found knife Bob. also know Jack killed Fred strangulation witness saw two go another room found garrote around Fred Jack left. there's actually 100 kinds events Jack Ripper went room someone dead later 94 times found knife gun piano wire \*\*something\*\* certain used kill them.""

""What we're still trying figure 6 times went room someone died find murder weapon.""

This imply (as would rightfully describe ""terrifying"" possibility) situation murder kind ""new form murder"" presence alone somehow made people die. in, murder weapon all. murdered sort mental power talked killing like Hannibal Lecter exotic horrible possibility nature.

There lot good news Covid, put mind rest, likely killing completely new invisible way.

What really means incredible murder crime spree town right highly overworked CIS teams trying find knife, gun, piano wire, etc. still pretty excellent job 94% time, 6% see recognize devious psychopath using bunch different murder weapons.

This Darth Vader force-choking someone distance.

The great tragedy deniers leaping ""only 6% people get Covid die it"" announcement communicating nothing even remotely sort. saying ""medical professionals overwhelmed right 6% time can't figure exactly Jack Ripper it. cases absolutely eye witness (a positive COVID test) put KNOWN MASS MURDERER room victim died.""

The incomprehensible willful stupidity takes reverse factual ""we know exactly killed 6 100 victims"" delusional ""see killed 6 people, 100!"" utterly escapes me.

Well, vaccines like old CIA operatives South America train natives fight eradicate enemy themselves. idea scale anomaly terms numbers deaths? 

According CDC, counted 24,000 - 64,000 flu deaths past season, includes anomalous bump referring to. mis attributed Covid deaths, certainly couldn’t make majority discrepancy. Yeah, us is, that's empathy fails you. Who's shithole now? Except countries lockdown, particular early consequential lockdown like Denmark Norway. think virus still raging hard right now? they're appearances? lying reopening schools? virus rages hard everyone herd immunity kicked in?

I want know think beyond generic ""China trusted"". agree numbers accurate, understand they'd react hard early Wuhan, literally welding people apartments, let go wild now. What'd end game? sources back anecdote? know came lodged somewhere hippocampus. It’s probably twice that. missed part lot practice. act fast shitty regulations make shit like happen often. practice. 

 excusing countries failings, makes sense area world constantly deals shit would little edge countries little experience. Johns Hopkins says US 3 percent mortality rate.  six people, dead. getting along fine, living lives, died result virus. No, isn’t. smaller regional study Sweden found 15% registered covid deaths caused virus. risk great healthcare. election followers still love him. Yes, is. Wuhan place detected it, and/or told public (which caused panic it), dealt it.

This makes sense all, hundreds thousands dying Wuhan virus.

It’s clear outbreak started Wuhan late October/early November spread countries December/January. Hence countries saw deaths spikes months Wuhan did. 

Deaths matter public record western countries “excess deaths” deviated normal February/March. No, isn’t. way said HIV wasn’t killing people.

He's playing risky, reckless game kids families. ""Partial"" ""in some"". Good argument No, isn’t. don’t list every ailment person has. caused death. That’s it’s called “cause death” “health problems.” mean snark, go doctor then. sounds like something needs medical attention regardless covid. I've found Chilean...

they working long time minimize impact voters hold accountable ballot box well. Gerrymandering, voter suppression, two party system done great job enabling people voters support want office win elections stay power. think it'd helpful also show deaths / 1M population countries used get 79,860/36,960/16,170 numbers.

NEED lose incredibly valuable early years education, never made up. Forcing entire generation children worldwide “learn” home huge consequences world decades. avoided unless truly option. There’s good answer problem, bigger COVID problem general. That’s uncomfortable, it’s true. obesity. many americans obesity again?

So many obese normal. can’t prove long term effects novel virus definition sane comment?

Well said. bet everyone story like - someone make serious compromises family life work order support family.

Me personally, dad travelled fuck ton real young. He'd gone three days week years stretch another country weeks months. Mom start working could save college. time home alone felt like blessing I'm feeling like might socially stunted me. Oh well.

Yes.

Who we, definitely included. lives equal ""inherent"" value, that's type value supposed pay everyone's kids fed housed case something happens?

There's big difference sending kid school sick go work homeless housing feeding everyone's kids, like not, life changes

And? Even without kids, shit hit fan. one's saying ""take care sick child, perma flu."" Sometimes shit happens. act like doesn't.

It actually evidence points fact asymptomatic people transmissible. nursing home janitor, teen bagging groceries sunday school teacher simply tested positive, showing symptoms, evidence suggests Grandma pretty safe. 

Actually say Please drink drive responsibly. going drink close drive, make sure limit one drink (dependent tolerance). legal Blood Alcohol content 0%. takes severity account. analogy really work favour.

edit: vs  **necessarily** contradictory unless brain thinks binary. Another aspect Covid becomes political toxic. Big surprise. sides partially wrong! Another big surprise.

4% Covid. 

Some percentage Covid + respiratory failure caused Covid. Sepsis caused Covid.

But yes, terminal cancer patients obese 80 year olds diabetes heart failure also included 94%.

So what’s answer question everyone wants know: mortality rate look like relatively healthy people 70. say elderly people “don’t matter”. course matter. matter much subsidize SS Medicare. able isolate. People 70 need get back living lives.

Are going keep arguing 6% meme like toddlers? Hong Kong confirmed case reinfection also man caught early strain Asia, travelled Europe recently caught strain. Even then, asymptomatic

And another case recently U.S. physician IIRC. Yes immune memory take longer case, like quipped we've lucky far, travel. they're different reinfect, wonder efficacy vaccine? Probably come binding site blocks many fun science questions investigate, 2020.. :(  Exactly. 6% death rate underlying causes scare shit people. 94% scare anyone semblance preexisting condition.

I feel like public discourse getting worse honestly. People going back - bad/its hoax - position 5 months ago.  Slow keyboard warrior projection inferiority complex, never suggested jobless frustrated narcissistic pseudo-intellectual argumentative fuck.

Don't resort nasty adhominems. obviously make money, well pre-taxes least, glory welfare state.

Again, arguments literally policy, now. next crisis, try first explain happening ride high horse hindsight lies (e.g. Chinese reporting policy). opinion piece relying heavily anecdotal evidence writer friends mixed unsupported facts. Brings mistakes made mention remedied. talks stuff happened June ongoing mention progress happened two months since exist?

It luck infection rate curves ICU deaths going since peak April. ~~I guess lot countries extremely unlucky.~~

Even TenYearsTenDays fair critique says lot. Ya N-94 masks. Gregorian calender. article pretty Sweden everything open functioning usual. government decided implement disruptive measures closing schools children younger sixteen parents could continue jobs. **recommended people work home, never prevented going offices chose so. fact, actually encouraged show work communicate sense emergency.**

Something like 50% workers work home. Everyone know capacity this, this, since March. recommended people continue end year. huge contrast countries, friend France told sending back office argued [*Boston Review*](http://bostonreview.net/politics/adele-lebano-sweden%E2%80%99s-relaxed-approach-covid-19-isn%E2%80%99t-working) characterizes organicist society, individual choice public choice perfectly overlap dissent expelled; **twenty eminent scientists** publish Swedish approach one country’s two flagship newspapers **almost impact public debate policy.**

I understand point. many, would say time, critiques actually change public debate policy, especially people find convincing. People support public health agency, 20 scientists, specialty virology, wrote really aggressive way (by Swedish standards) also promoted models said 25-96,000 Swedes would die without locking down. would also add Dagens Nyhter Svenska Dagbladet biggest newspapers critical editorial stance towards Swedish strategy. prominent media houses critical, know say ""dissent expelled"". result? disease [still spreading end June, even contained elsewhere. country’s seven-day new infection average June 25 1,275 cases per day, compared forty-two Denmark eleven Norway. number since declined, testing, drastically curtailed early July.

It disingenuous takes highest case numbers June, publishing article end August. Sweden's positivity rate like 3%, great remarkably high. [The current prevalence literally median Deaths admissions hospitals declining since stroke preparedness, least since beginning April, schools organizations plans ready move activities online (Sweden already among networked societies earth). never used them.

I genuinely confused point. works university, moved online March, high schools. majority people could worked home continued work home since.

You really need cherry pick mislead point Sweden's failures pandemic, continues surprise many commentators twist numbers truth could still paint bad picture.

She makes good points lack preparedness, general lack action Sweden took. opinion underestimated seriousness disease, overestimated difficulty contain it, moved slowly. hand lots countries completely ignored side effects prolonged school closures social isolation population. need masks protect us 5G Chemtrails spread Bill Gates Kills counted like League Legends. exactly countries well? Gas groceries open mandatory masks, malls bars closed, restaurants take-aways. believe mask regulations infringing rights. Basically, don’t like wearing don’t like they’re told to. Gotta say, I'm planning visiting dad Thanksgiving mom stepdad Christmas. Driving, flying.

Is risk? Sure. going three people separate gathering: me, dad, probably girlfriend house, mom, stepdad, house. Afterward self-isolating anyway since work home need randomly go out, I'll order groceries safe.

But yeah. parties, I'm going see parents year. people slow selfish could different today. Maybe she'll burn Reichstag blame ""far right groups"". grounds planted. believe I've heard somewhere past. Merkel stick internal affairs retire. /r/woooosh/ reading they're trying force something go around standard process, doubts well. I'd carefully consider similar vaccine approved ones, examine evidence myself. blindly trusting administration CDC direction.

Anti vaxers necessarily absurd, selfish. They're relying everyone else taking vaccine (and subjecting tiny risk) order provide herd immunity. Pretty sure driver drove bullet, fault Argentina: 190.07 deaths per million

UK: 624.15 deaths per million

🤔 Sucks suck Germany doesnt even real foreign policy due EU surely knew :D

Calling Merkels policy times Erdogan, Putin, Bolsonaro Trump dangerous big joke, enjoy life :) yep; backup standing room city live in....

it'll start getting shoulder room couple weeks many companies seem pushing mid September deadline. initial wave anywhere 8x 20x cases knew about. Testing across board lacklustre brand new.

So although Spain reported 250,000 cases early doors would 2-5 million cases. difference sundry covid checks margin error negated. Half assed case means contact tracing, improving testing capacity, preparing healthcare system. 

The “lockdown” part wasn’t half assed severely strict. somebody give dude goody goodies. Oh neither I. think safety measures Chinese vaccines, much less Russian one. I'm gonna lie, first half. pretty good. what, 6th highest death chart? Whenever anyone tells numbers wrong cases reported lie, simply tell facts wrong, know wrong. say could also reporting covid deaths. wanna play hypothetical game. Let's play. actually calculate cost, government actually published cost covid treatments, also drew conclusion:

Many benefits available US folks also (us company) lockdowns created equal. Argentina imposed one strictest lockdowns world. kept 180 days.

But without contact tracing, limited testing. positivity 40% months cases community spread.

We also much poorer NZ. Many people go work order money eat.

Our government “easy” part, authoritarian banning things, throwing people jail, etc. didn’t anything rest issues. C'mon, man, ***football***, important! /s know vaccines potentially harmful, macro scale far far far less diseases prevent. Vaccines perfectly safe. claim much either naive disingenuous. Like driving car, accepting vaccine reasonable risk. However, rush something instance greatly undermine trust must whole process - leading large increase people refuse vaccine. thought supposed kill 30k people boost economy without lockdown, according herd immunity death cultists. simply hold 26% anti-vaxxers get dose administered. get kinds stress related illnesses even bigger drain healthcare system? Genius! /s dictator 15 years power called Angela Merkel, Lukaschenko. pointing finger 4 pointed towards her. foreign policy aggressive world right dangerous. Given caught red-handed admitting spreading bullshit believe ""bait"" votes, clear nothing pathetic troll business here.

You're worse anti-mask idiot, victims con-men perhaps genuinely believe nonsense they're spewing. come argue, perhaps miracle occurs might even walk away learning something. can't even say scum like yourself. understand like 30 minute block scheduling people? Like come alone work out, wipe next customer, repeat. could see working, considering massage therapists taking appointments right now. I'm vaccines likes ccp putin yeah, vaccine rot. Yeah, polio failure happened decades ago. then, starting COVID like month behind testing first batch tests CDC messed up. trying rush. People extra-careful they're trying rush fuck up. Interesting comparing last year, 2019 lowest mortality record (in past 30+ years, per capita) two extraordinarily mild flu seasons. compare 2015-2019 mean longer mean? cause trying stress excess deaths reported ones (they aren't, currently excess deaths compared March-August 2020 months 2015-2019 4800ish people, official reported COVID-19 deaths 5800+).

What solution elderly issue then. Currently, infection region's elderly homes sick people, really individual numbers. already recommendations authorities allow individual visits, based case case basis decisions elderly home. going blanket solution?  lol, like 200,000+ americans normal decided ""This year preexisting condition gonna kill me."" Colleges closing within 2 weeks opening, great. We're great. Netherlands pretty decent, par Germany hell lot better states. remindme! 1 year Germany dictatorship right now.. 

Yeah. Good claim accuse Belarus ""15 years power

Lukaschenko 25 years power mate, atleast learn Merkel already imprisoning people protesting measures

40000 people demonstrated Sunday. Roughly 300 got arrested attackiing police, demonstrants, carrying NaziFlags on. single one got arrested protesting. even let demonstrants thing didnt wear masks distancing, didnt want escalate ""extremists"" okay arrest them.

They carried flags German Kaiser Reich, shouting kill people, wearing right-extremists signs, furthest far right parties germany, even outside parlament (III. Weg /NPD) marched them. werent called extremists, fucking headline makes think Corona good economy. 

No, doesnt lol. says decling ""only"" 5.8% percent, still fucking ton. comparing -10% 2nd Quarter way better rate annually. shows Germany reacted, reduced spread virus (mostly) could open v-shaped economy.

So, thank absolutely wrong comment topic seemingly idea about. Perhaps people color get vaccine white people, former vulnerable. circus, monkeys. ""Our strategy good countries complete failure (500+ deaths per million)"" - Sweden Capitalism you. Yeah, like equate ""theory"" ""opinion."" challenged provide proof backpedal ""opinion.""   Damn Russians. 

*shakes fist clouds* Various causes deaths well though. Lockdowns US 2 months, full year. Baltimore education tend go sentence. read paper completely believe incorporated evidence-based medicinal practice. But, may nit-picking, dont think that's necessarily 'common sense' case studies come out. viruses manifest similarly regardless viral load upon intitial exposure infection established, think virologically sound conclude viruses behave way, despite case COVID. ""Victorian doctors ignore unprecedented negative outcome virus"" Well yeah. used USC U$C. Big difference. It’s gone around $92,000. Older vulnerable people may opt take hardly tested vaccine, expecting risk Corona higher vaccine. younger people completely different story. Ethnically homogeneous countries future. Actually do.  know noone died aids 80s. pneumonia, rare cancers, minor illnesses vaccine causes 0.1% fatalities long term, would worse virus applied everyone. Perhaps ok older people much higher risk Corona long term effects matter much Anti-Mask groups?

The name sounds self-explanatory reason this? job based York. owner 95% staff flat refuse wear mask (we work indoors confined spaces others) worst part thought without doubt jobs would go would force us wear mask especially print ""mask required"" door. Wrong, since March one customer required mask, everyone else care. visit 3-5 different job sites week Wow, you’re braindead People straight getting resurrected Iowa certainly people Texas Florida lately ofcourse NY start outbreak rejected hospitals beds available. Swedens sucess? 6475 deaths last year (March - June) lot people lingering problems Covid call sucess.

And kind life think elderly vulnerable living Sweden nowadays? Visitors still allowed ro visit relatives friends care homes. 
I supporting Swedish ""stuff away elderly"" strategy. Good. Well first reinfection sick 6 months ago believe Reno, herd immunity looking great dont think. googled, *”Why would perform tracheotomy?”* would known 1 3 reasons tracheotomy.

“A tracheostomy\* usually done one three reasons: bypass obstructed upper airway; clean remove secretions airway; *to easily, usually safely, deliver oxygen lungs*.”
-hopkinsmedicine.org

\*being used interchangeably tracheotomy individual days mean absolutely nothing. look weeks want trends. honestly light years better US, lived Canada Netherlands, even good. NZ Germany way better systems. True.100%.

Funerals cost way more. research...... start google reckless depraved indifferent coughing? course afford it; it’s policy decision Florida impose state income tax allow state run deficit, ever. don’t want ask anyone means sacrifice anything common good. double decker arrangement seems pretty cool.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Awesome True, bad choise words part there. kind blah article. says could stay hiker’s jacket 7 days instead 3...I’m failing see would contribute greater spread unless hikers taking jackets touching exactly 3 days. also says indoor spread may increase cooler indoor temperatures, every experience I’ve ever indoor temperatures higher gets cold outside stop pumping air conditioning. Safety already validated phase 1 2 trials, safety double checked, unlikely concern. Especially oxford vaccine uses well tested researched mechanism.

Efficacy bigger question mark. Phase 1 2 rrial showed worked thousand people. trials 10k plus each. give better idea overall efficacy.

Phase 3 runs year, signal expected 3 months October. gjve indication efficacy 50% given emergency approval, rolled heakthcare professionals high risk groups really hope flock social media document what’s going on. Mild severe, would good generation disseminate reality. get that. I’ve hearing since March I’ve become desensitized it. went “just weeks months flatten curve” “just another half year till vaccine.” recently I’ve seeing articles pointing even vaccine won’t get us this. Combine one corrupt governments country ever had, serious doubts control within years. honestly think it’s likely going become endemic, something could easily dealing next 10-20 years, rest life.

Maybe I’m pessimistic, believe hope am, everyone know falls one categories. Either accepted risks moved lives, continue stay homes dealing continuously worsening depression substance abuse issues. made decision public health based desire reopen return normalcy, scientific merit.

All I'm saying taken list trusted authorities something already that. 

Why fighting hard this? large difference. I'm pretty red area central Florida yet probably 2 dozen trips HD Lowes, seen anyone maskless since early June. Took trip north late May mask usage still 50% amazed everyone Tallahassee wearing masks. “Almost immune.” qualified statement. Absolutely agree you. real. people pessimism...nobody allowed hope. I'm one them. I'm bioinformatics scientists publishes epidemiological papers constantly, wrote pipelines tracing viral genomic drift strains, pretty much perfectly accurate predictions entire pandemic... constantly reading. I've read nearly 200 studies covid-19 notes. go back comments see calling things happening March, even February started quarantining working home.

Some states shitty education, shitty leadership. state scientists per capita. right (and also ability, read article) opt in. 

There zero law broken companies giving option opting tracking. Let's forget zero symptoms still test positive. 3 days see based feel /symptoms would add meds like z pack , nebulizer, etc. 

All worthless OTC relief covid. same. going many weeks now. No, Trump blew it. child sick doctors doctor's note. still count absence? Lol, I'm arms anything here. Aids covid. count deaths differently. that's point anyway, aids deaths aids CoD. treat covid way? would see real numbers, like 150k deaths dropped less 9k CoD...just like media reporting guy stage 4 cancer died. reported covid killed him. Get real, already death's door body ravaged years cancer. People power seem think advanced much. agree you. ""Karen"" videos wanting wear mask saying things like ""its body"" ""it's choice"" that's point. point sick know spread people. Okay, body choice, people's bodies choice, responsibility protect people right now. vaccine approved safe effective. evidence suggest otherwise. Oxford always planned fall 2020 elections anything else matter. 

Luckily UK people seem bit sense Americans regards vaccines politicise drugs. 

Making statements like fuel anti-vaxx movement massive public health implications.  also end issues don’t fully understand yet.  Scarred lungs life, cardiac issues, etc.  honestly know play out, happening rate 25% hospitalized patients. People concerned mortality numbers frankly. article notes medical researchers still idea 1976 side effect happened. irrelevant curiosity; continue produce new flu vaccines every year.

I've lost lot trust CDC, humanity whole, I'm still favor accelerated vaccine approval. emergency, acting slowly means thousands people die, many thousands health permanently damaged. havent heard school district requiring tests going back. NJ high number cases, schools still going forward Sept 10 hybrid attendance worried except reaction teachers taking leave absences. I’m dramatic. I’m stating saw last spring. don’t take little kid classroom stick front laptop worksheets expect learn way classroom. simply doesn’t work vast majority kids. That’s schools need back session variety common sense precautions designed make kids safe possible. Take look recommendations Europe. Really sad fact r/COVID19positive started place seek stories people experienced get support full people claiming sorts things go science, people claiming got twice even tested lots comments saying ""omg twice never tested either!!"", people claiming twice first time like august last year, people commenting immunity lasts 3 months fucked gets almost 100 upvotes... stay away sub infected looking similar stories. Gotta get 'em ready real world.

(I see stuff people office too.) Well would love that. something ethical concerns. God cannot understand people complaining Sweden moment amount deaths one day 3 moths. 

mUrIcA That's exact point. willing end it. 

People sacrifice, make reasons satisfy needing to. ""I go nursing homes love parents, contribute spread. none 180k dead fault problem.""

We decided lives important.  still suffered enormous financial damage. 

Nothing lifetime bad. I'm 40s America. satisfied life switching thrive survive. worse first world countries? student taught high school? work? grew Texas. schools get paid certain amount per student attendance wanted matter what. 

If got perfect attendance high school didn’t make take finals come school morning sign sign sheet showing school day could get paid. “ it’s education right every citizen. person denied opportunity educated.”. Even flu must educate! Also even flu must prepare meals restaurant. Also even flu must go work retirement home. sick disgusting, end costs society Ok, non rushed purpose election properly vetted vaccine 

Better? we're already rationalizing 180k deaths part cost business think neurological damage much obstacle. brings up, ask source, ask source source got, etc till find something that's official media, discuss vaccine. straight gave people syphilis. Intentionally. You’re starting sound hysterical. I’m relying recommendations epidemiologists education professionals state. impression immunity prevents someone contracting virus again. Therefore can’t spread creche (Ireland) keep kid chickenpox home 5 days, scabs form allow back. least another week maybe two kid visibly remains pox contagious. don’t grow artificial humans conduct vivo testing? both! I'm thankful every day, especially now. realize 1 billion humans lived planet mean think ever got perfect attendance award, sounds like reason get one. Even excused still school. Oxford vaccine tested safety even pandemic started, since made another virus. rushing there.

The rushing part, indeed rushed, efficacy trials. bring risks (a lack efficacy could bring false sense security, plus could actually allow virus mutate infectious strain), take much credence article concerns risk ailments mentioned. yeah national mandates masks national initial lockdown earlier leaving governor really screwed things up. I'm sure virus would still making rounds right now, think would much better place right proper leadership. someone receives low viral load transmit high viral load someone else? Ah shit right. Sorry fucked one.  I'm sorry. sounds absolutely terrible.

She always told reason go one else learning anything participate fun. Might well something fun home. still great mom. sick kids every school district. need continue cleaning already worry thosed exposed proper protection. Administer tests treat and/or wait 2 weeks give another test. panic every case close building point even trying anything except complete lockdown every person force vaccinated. company. company :( 

Pre covid rule teleworking called sick (or reason) telework instead. could WFH days scheduled to. sure people would take advantage it. even places ""mandatory"" like Walmart,Loblaws stores TJ MAX Stores city still around 60%/70% adoption masks. Whoa. link WH official's tweet? always.

We truancy officer show daughters absences doctor's note.

We pissed. Wtf supposed do, send kids school sick?! logic behind statement really questionable. What's proof? agree sentiment. Don’t want get vaccine? Go ahead. Don’t enter building meantime. Cobras? compare deaths today diagnoses 3 weeks ago better picture what's going Unfortunately, advise, mean government listen. think know prisoners end list, despite increased risk themselves. Well, think finding 100% always correct sources. 

But like sources agencies pretty much always correct, even tough sometimes make mistakes.

As opposed sources who's work process make bs :)

I mean, Russia says ""there absolutely radiaactive radiation area here! perfectly safe!"" everybody goes AAAAA LEMME OUTTA HERE! lol. reason. Maybe, maybe not. Still symptoms though week ago think I'm clear. least.  Wildcats!!!!! Ah, Florida, home state. Can't say I've missed last 39 years that's exactly. live time everyone reactionary- triggered will. Everyone afraid getting bad press (nowadays) negative social media. volume means chances coming contact people it. data important know safety efficiency not?

And btw, lot obese people countries, including India. Meds huge thing though, go school nurse even tylenol HS. Automatic suspension lot places. still time ask doctor cash price don’t insurance. thanks. already know reasoning whoops meant 2019

But yeah, im saying wealthy donors first door, likely rowdy students, Im sure stringent rules students allowed in. that, available evidence contact tracing reported countries suggests asymptomatically infected individuals much less likely transmit virus develop symptoms per 

WHO can't yet quantify ""much less likely"" suggests studies: ""Comprehensive studies transmission asymptomatic patients difficult conduct, require testing large population cohorts data needed better understand quantified transmissibility told covid much, much serious threat turned be.

If, hypothetically, U.S. made changes, expect death count be? taking **reasonable precautions limit** spread

Works me. Good luck cutting Quest, testing industry duopoly. unrelated news, state Florida announced longer use iPhones.......:) nowhere deranged political rambling seem aware Florida sustained decline cases month, 75% peak yup 10 unexcused days. think child services called kid contacted 10 days might bad parent.

If kid sick call school tell kid sick, REALLY sick district help facilitate learning reach child's needs. 

Stop spreading false information. 25,000 half season tickets sold 2018.

Also - go 2018? 2019 numbers? exactly child first wave kids. They're guinea pigs scenario #1 #2 first round kids going ones exposed, parents fear think going back right thing do. Transmission rates state low epidemiologists recommending in-person learning districts. 

So... Yeah seems like everybody leaving California partner capture additional data increase statistical confidence. Also useful test various populations check efficacy different demographics.

America instance offers great place test efficacy obese people. would struggle obtain trial run india Retraction? Trump trying pull votes way look like gigantic failure. Headaches, can’t sleep, depression anxiety.

And that’s 7 year old. :-( take another test, likely negative. Also, big fucking deal school send officer house daughter missed 15 days. absence doctor's note, excuse me, doctor himself. notes record school. Still sent truancy officer house threaten us.  guess good scientist much evidence young kids spread much less read bunch links science also read Harvard School Public Health written it.

""Harvard"" school near Boston.

Hope helps. nice day! Seems right. Vaccine limited/emergency use December, widespread availability spring. couple fun notes JMU’s response

* Last Friday, reaching around 200 cases, President Alger sent entire student body email telling us “cautiously optimistic” opening results. 

* dashboard showing results (which mess), initially showed pie graph depicting positivity rate. Friday, pie chart showed 3% positive rate. Monday, reached pie graph mysteriously disappeared. waste time. wish way reach people like that. Good trying. literally everyone thread sub asking lockdowns I'm scientist studies daily. course backed research, goes back months months, really ramping recently. findings showing children spread virus efficiently efficiently adults. already knew Israel ago, studies directly young populations, bunch studies happened past month basically consensus. CDC politically influenced, fear misinformation reached people like armed educational background truly break down.

Do quick search reading, maybe like 15 minutes research find exactly this, nevermind hours hours research someone like done specific topic becomes clear. studies claiming otherwise since redacted revised.

Children, fact, shown reservoirs virus, holding onto bit more. better disease prognosis studies shown actually harbor virus longer. also less likely properly follow guidelines shown now, schooling, superspreaders. Look around country, schools shutting dozens hundreds cases first week. Wake. The. Fuck. Up. Face facts. reacting covid dying okay. too. 

vote. drag people polls. someone ELI5 Spain new daily cases thousands sometimes, yet daily deaths never 10 20?

I impression virus way deadlier this.

Or everyone gonna die dead already? literally contradicting yourself. woah buddy data fact free thread, please edit comment include righteous rage desantis killing billions floridian gamgams mom got tested August 13th. go hospital something unrelated. I'm Canada (Ontario specifically) literally testing ANYONE wants one. said testing *everyone* there.

Her results posted August 14th morning. negative. wait time results probably close bit sooner.

I cannot believe Americans waiting *12 DAYS* fucking results. one's gonna trampled Rights piece swine doodoo, still stupid freedom living life whatever ever wanna call it. Point realistically there's viable vaccine that's going ready time soon people listen science go till Vaccine. go fuck freedom going compromise people's health. Actually go live life people mindset yours, get infected die less idiots deal with. I'm fucking tired hearing people yapping rights. Fuck die moment onwards. people pushing intentional disinformation campaign care true. Primarily protects others yes

Reduces potential viral load well

Less virus = better opportunity body battle I've never heard ""The Star"" see point article post. shitting Americans, par course sub. I’ve seen rabbits guinea pigs. confess despise hamsters. 

I’ve always wondered people don’t feed hamsters snake instead rats, since rats smart interesting hamsters disgusting breed every 17 days. poll results upsetting - author's snide generalized derision Americans goes bit far, taste. disinformation misrepresenting actually says. underlying conditions, comorbidities like respiratory failure pneumonia. things caused catching Covid. 6% listed COVID cause. 95% listed COVID primary cause 160K deaths. Title wrong. Baptist, course. ¡ɐᴉlɐɹʇsn∀ *ʇsᴉɟ sǝʞɐɥs* pray, like hypocrites, love pray standing synagogues street corners seen others.

Matthew 6:5-6 2 heads state say ""it's bad here""... Everyone thread stroking obvious is, 99% sub today ""mAsKs PrOtEcT oThErS"" nothing obvious. Take none granted never win re-election again.  Vogue? Seriously? dropped /s hit hard beginning - hit hard :( JFK's exploding head would disagree. don’t. Physical contact amongst friends even strangers important society. Masks? Sure, specter death gone. don’t see distancing help anything put Covid behind us fuck sake. 

At start pandemic, reported ask Asian countries mistakes made America. Every response wearing masks.

Put. Your. Fucking. Masks. On. remember someone suggesting using masks something use thwart Big Brother facial recognition. Muh freedom! don’t think current way life US conducive seeing flu cases drastically lower flu season due masks/restaurant capacities/working home settings? correct course action. Here, collection animal-in-mask pictures help along that!

[Guinea Pig [(Which made collectible Good know smart people there! like transparency. first people dying, anti-vaxxer get lot support. even worst one. Canada, free. government purchase supply market.

Otherwise get nothing.

That’s works. Define healthy.  statistics really tell little risk factors pre-existing conditions. That's intent. data distinguish conditions people getting COVID conditions people got result COVID.

The 6% causes really incomplete death certificates. Maybe people died home autopsy. 

This data really intended researchers. I'm really sure practical application would be. Maybe researchers looking death records potential COVID deaths classified such. times I’d see explosive headline one ‘news outlet’ subs I’m panic... I’d realize affects US I’m “Oh. Yeah.”

I’m Japan, way. Id love link still dig up. friend looks people die vs don't, would love show him. Yes made full recovery! took little longer sister mild case. Yeah hopefully contact tracers keep people affected take seriously. 3 outbreaks currently Calgary related religious gatherings apparently Fuck, fuck, trump gets vaccine November living York area 9/11 happened? remember someone putting sign said “Death towel heads” Shrewsbury Walmart parking lot. didn’t get taken right away. sticks firmly mind never heard slur before. even pre-existing conditions, comorbidities like respiratory failure pneumonia. know, things caused Coronavirus. Title wrong. absolutely already narrative. already got text covid denying relative using misunderstanding stats. response showed explanation? snowflake emoji followed silence.

This America dies tried dismiss photographic evidence rioters attacking civilians claiming ""biased"", lmao.

Sorry buddy, know support public lynchings fake news. factual sub though, bullshit work here. light handed! wait till start shooting! ain’t  Judging number see around either wearing mask nose hanging out, outright dangling beneath chin, I'd say resounding no. Also number people wearing stupid fucking neck gaiters even though shown worse mask staggering. I've completely stopped trying go stores, even though mask every time fuck anti-mask assholes.

Edit: word Whack-a-mole vaccine sounds ideal, what's point? many times CDC going fuck realize average person understand medical lingo.... Lmao Bravo. brought sister 12 pack La Croix. Left porch since couldn’t see other. drank within days. lol problem data weaponized used show risk Amen. bet correlation anti maskers co morbidities... talking mental health either.

Anecdotally, anti maskers I’ve came contact visibly unhealthy... must something low mental capacities. I’ve read studies say people mental illness poorer health.

So maybe it’s effect mask itself? so, despite fact acknowledge geographic advantages NZ duh

You still conclude Canada handled covid worse NZ? think makes sense judge handling situation context differences? agree, Canada done passably well, due sensible policy making federal level, general acceptance masks/social distancing public. 6 months though, people definitely becoming complacent, number cases continues simmer slowly. little worried things turn next month schools re-open. work research lab we’ve studying long time.

The secret: young. Oh yeah? that? get funding fight pandemic get fucked? prove otherwise? CFR consistent across nearly every country. Meanwhile IFR remains total mystery. know total confirmed cases may within 1-2% ??? not. Trump symptom. been, looks like might plateau time. end getting Pfizer trial, curious. Well it’s $5k fine you’re caught public without mask on. works around $736USD American exceptionalism truly bizarre. single country reasonable amount resources handled coronavirus worse. Official policy actually seem somewhat pro-virus, without exaggerating. Yet are, solid third people think everything US touches gold, even flaming dumpster they'll tell beautiful bonfire. No! changes nothing all. harmless there's reaction. People America underlying conditions. knew covid. Except not. It’s like point oh six one percent Cost free patient free government. ECMO machines cost something like 30,000 RMB per day run. Spain. go Mexico problem, least San Diego. Mexican border patrol stop you. come back, consider ""essential"" reason traveled Mexico, send secondary inspection give shit tell travelling needlessly, let pass. I've heard people even saying wen't dentist okay border agent. deafness also Covid symptom, everybody would rocking Walkmans Beats Dre's. like watch happens kind comments. Hashtag shit Okay shoot kill 100 people 94 already underlying health issues 6 none, I'm responsible 6 deaths? 🤔 Clearly Certainly would nice going new year worst behind us. One hope definitely looks way far tell.  stayed closed first place smh Thank you. demonstrates needs federal law mandating masks. Hopefully Biden/Harris make happen.

In many ways doesn’t go far enough either though, often even people wear masks wrongly. fault own. happens. reason task force specialists monitor masks worn correctly. spread communities work.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. obviously includes anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

Their children perhaps slightly less conspicuous symbol masks — something identify real risk result raised enemies society science.

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people “enemies” progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. task force mentioned easily adopted work. individuals employed federal government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress.

Obviously people willingly violate new mask law separated society — good society, well good. dealt humanely fairly. like Nazis. individuals simply separated families society moved safe place time being. perfectly humane fair. safe places seek educate evil ways harm world. re-educated returned society. course repeat offenders dealt little harshly. 

But benefit. Eventually individuals proven menace society danger security state, permanently removed. done humanely, key done good collective whole. system really space individualism. selfish attitude exactly got us trouble first place.

So selfish activity controlled aspects society, especially economic realm. Individuals allowed hoard cash. progressive tax policy course help redistributed, aid less fortunate. cash hoarding outlawed, banks reason exist. probably done away first. People run banks identified enemies state placed camps see error ways returned society. course allowed enter advantageous position, somewhere near base, reduced manual tasks help greater good. Needless say also special insignia masks identifies part dangerous class individuals.

Business owners stripes receive treatment managers banks. course understanding welcome opportunity make amends society. However will, protection, removed society. meme indirectly leading spreading virus people taking virus seriously. Well duh, NZ share world's longest unguarded land border United States. Also note QC share land border state new york. Ontario alone 14 bridges several ferries connect NY, millions people crossing every year.http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/ontario-511/ontario-border-crossings.shtml They'll coming Covid gold medal! used golden needle?

Yes, right that. 1/3 population New York City much larger area land contain population. Getting shit pushed lacks context actual lockdown. Okay, ""not testing older people"" article Phase 3.

Less testing = less cases. Positivity rates even NY went back upstate ny Ofcourse want pedantic sure formal term misrepresenting chart. want spin fake news say: news &lt;insert deaths fake. real numbers 6% reported numbers .... &lt;misrepresent study says Lancet. greater correlation combined measures mentioned reduction risk, meta analysis includes studies varying levels protective gear.

High low blood pressure, diabetes, fighting kind cancer, disease, obesity, high cholesterol, list goes on.

My sister works locked one says absolute misery there. Family can’t help care like usually do, volunteers aren’t allowed help minimize chance comes in. conditions, impossible give standard care used to, knowing full well don’t anything live anymore, since activities visits cancelled, many patients don’t even get bed anymore, languishing rest lives away lonely bed. easy decision make.

I imagine isn’t easy position choose locking nursing home down, banning visitors, knowing full well mean slipping standards care many die alone. median amount time patient spends nursing home death 5 months. Imagine less 5 months live, could told would never see loved ones again, would lower chance getting virus 1 20 chance killing you. would feel that? easy decision nursing home director make. easy us sit feel know best others, put resident’s shoes, would probably feel differently affected. think thinking virus ceased exist.. letting virus stop living life Uh there's still communism bad propaganda. ever read ""news"" Kim Jong un something evil dying?

Beside, said nothing done stop spread disease.

Also, talking greed? main benefits implementing widespread lockdown/social distancing higher dividends shareholders, prevent death sickness created both: 1) measures 2) economic hardship created measures.

Edit: wide use lockdown/social distancing also disgusting trade-off life well citizens rich developed countries ones citizens poor less developed countries, well life well rich citizens country ones poor citizens country. see... yeah you’d think they’d give extra leeway middle pandemic (for go back first place) hate Trump conduct would thing? Landlords protected foreclosure, tenants protected evictions, end getting evicted anyways bank takes over. I've many high school graduations years, would point student two never missed single day school since kindergarten. always assume many days went school sick dog, must sucked parents had. irony lost calling someone names trying assert moral superiority hypocritical. Wonder Tim Horton say this.

Not much. He's dead 40 years. boy pre kindergarten 2 years due delayed speech. He's kindergarten year opted keep home online curriculum instead.

Thankfully position I'm stay home dad disability God darn gonna explode....

Also, pre-k got trouble missed 25 days school constantly sick, since covid began sick once, actually kind nice.

But yeah ain't good. sure, like said it’s correspondence. you’re right, it’s start! Texas public schools funded attendance? might one issues. California enforces truancy rules super hard, part funding based attendance. need stop policy Corona IMO. lead crap like this. right. parents also slammed demands job total lack child care options. want parents right thing (keep sick kids home) need give mandated flexibility work. 


Which, given current state country, seems incredibly unlikely. “Fauci clarified CDC’s recent report states 6 percent (approximately 9,000) 183,500 COVID-19 deaths attributed coronavirus alone.

The infectious disease expert pointed figure simply means COVID-19 caused 9,000 deaths without causing pneumonia, cardiac arrest, complications killed 94 percent people contracted virus.

That data “does mean someone hypertension diabetes dies COVID didn’t die COVID-19. did,” Fauci said.”

Thank you, Dr Fauci! don’t know we’d without you, honestly. Yikes.

Thats gonna get lot people sick. states completely open. two three times bad tail pandemic.

4k rent could turn 9k rent. guys paid parental leave? Get town! mean.. country one write research paper college? People seem seriously lacking sort critical thinking evaluating sources. even close one gullible examples I've seen lately.

I guess that's scams like Nigerian prince thing still seem floating around?

News flash folks: certain people organizations vested interest trying make think certain way. always ask source using information reliable effect industry advertisement get behave want. Well certainly would died  ""system"" here, curious using punitive regulation control outcomes lack social safety nets. 

We use punishment society increase favored outcomes - case punish parents keeping kids school way increasing attendance. 

On top means supporting parents might otherwise miss work tend forba sick child. Why? mindset sees parents first laborers necessary caregivers. important us america laborers turning wheels industry. Social reproduction child care small sliver tine work bed. Childcare so-called women's work yet make effort ensure families make single income. 

We much made beds one. specific actions instance - mindset punishment, control, patriarchy, capitalist exploitation labor. 

We either change ways decline experiencing continue accelerate. Listen, virus thing getting old ok

What really need focusing [Big 10 football played fall, right Mr case long time. long time. virus would kill regardless. Early models said 500 mill infected 50 mill dead already. family mostly German Irish, come generations ago. live Michigan too, known more... rugged. 

Yeah same, sometimes 100 meant decide, wait see. “real fever” yet. Floridian, sense DeSantis found way curb testing school started. probably knew months ago played card. 

You can’t breakout don’t testing. Misinformation? month 15,000 people died, 9 18 existing health conditions. That's effectively zero. 

Compare something like black death wiped entire regions map see much joke claim risk children. Dozens children died worldwide! DOZENS!

Meanwhile, 12,175 children average die year US accidental injury. lock children response that? much so. That’s I’ve read well, countries it. learn hard way.  landlords get mortgages frozen compensate? Well simple biology anatomy seem hot days. Keep mind schools closed spring opening back now. Schools connect community think leads different situation. Number six dude Psrt job cave political pressure.

You absolutely blame job.

Just principles mean acceptable institutions none either. agree isn’t perfect. can’t think better metric compare countries going go around making otherwise unsubstantiated comparisons hard various countries shut down. total number active cases larger expected point, student behavior campus disappointing unacceptable. confronting realities taking action,"" Caslen wrote letter.

They blame students paying wages instead creating plan keep safe. Exactly! Keeping us alive little important lol long tuition paid cares? fun parties? mom hygenist who's recently put back work clean teeth.. allowing bring equipment. far got nice shielded mask almost like welders helmet size. open top wears hat it. 

Anyways question, guys put situation would buy help protect infection? Literally anything y'all think of. even hang things. ideas keep ball rolling. mines factories manned actual enslaved people children many countries across globe. America may feed systems, compared many nations immaculate labour laws.

Not excuse actions corporate America, course, cult profit wormed dirty way around globe back. Money death us made lifeblood. What’s going everyone, would like share condolences harrowing time world history. 

With everything that’s come past days “CDC quietly updating” website change COVID deaths whatever people falsely claiming days, got thinking. 

I tried looking online number people died specifically result COVID-19 (both US alone worldwide total) unable find specific number. 

Can anyone assist answering question up-to-date accurate information please? It’s hard days swimming misinformation fact-checking find semblance real statistic. right here. people like you?  states follow suit. Yeah, selfish. heart.   appreciate post. sure political views overlap (I'm blue moon) understand coming terms data trends. 

Pure curiosity, would interested answering two questions. like talking people this, especially ones trying find way vindicate prior held conviction:

1) opinion, point shifting data CDC WH? point shifting back again?

2) think trends heading downward? Masking protocols followed, or....? Death rate steadily declined no? recent confirmation majority covid deaths combination factors diseases curious countries reporting covid specific deaths counting weakened immune systems etc like are?

Pretty much want info discussion whether countries track covid deaths cormorbidies covid deaths factors? Right. sound biased, like trying justify bad decision. Bad decisions kill people. Tulsa rally bad decision Hermain Cain dead. longer contributing political discussion America went Tulsa rally, caught virus, died.

Who that? made decision killed Herman Cain? kind logic used making decision led death captain industry former presidential candidate? logic similar yours? wife tested Friday results Saturday. doctor part health system apparently swab tests they're testing a) active symptoms b) exposed person confirmed case. guess testing anyone reason, they're able process tests timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

A co-worker mine went county testing site took 7 days. about, turn CNN try watching YouTube bit.
Of course, videos see protests turn riot, thats masks get put on. protect virus ensure loot without recognized. Still, scroll NYC protests. find done day. THOUSANDS people. Even 20% dont masks, covid, spreading EVERYONE there. masks, per CDC protect getting it, protect others getting you.
If saying protests complete hive infestation, denial or, stated before, using fit narrative. 

You pick poison.

God forbid allow Church open. Way dangerous getting couple hundred people together spread across church even outdoors. riot ass off. Fuck man.

My mom died beginning (not covid). couldnt even funeral outside. day buried sat car it, got out, would run off. night, turned TV watched people country walk streets whatever fuck wanted nothing face. 
Fuck GO I'm claiming literally attended baby shower whatever 5 people one attendees covid something, called analogy analogous event.

You took risk ended triggering worst outcome. mean smart. (This also assuming actually know PCR test results people went baby shower, test results 100% valid) appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* day 2 online K 15-30 minute bursts throughout day, maybe two hours total specials (music, art, gym, technology) built in.

I know district would attempt Kindergarteners; planned homeschooling district announced ridiculous schedule like that! read education using TV Mexico. Seemed interesting doable. continue blame shitbags putting people situation - government full sociopaths view poor people resource exploited order benefit rich. economy affected due international buisness rather domestic. Also, Sweden isn’t seeing small businesses destroyed lockdown Limbo? Seems like almost everything open me. mom student teaching last year lead teacher would literally scream sleepy/sick kids falling asleep. 

She teaches 5 year olds it’s sad many kids come school relax/sleep home isn’t place that.

Teachers aren’t nurturing really shouldn’t teach, kid has. Teachers barely make enough support themselves, good ones spend much keeping food hungry kids supplies kids can’t afford it. That's virus gets bored leaves visit tahiti vacation something. schools know?

&amp;#x200B;

/s Special needs teacher, confirm learning happening April June, despite fact working 40 hour weeks trying make happen. It’s suitable kiddos. many confusing contradictory data, ripe political manipulation. Always great see local city make national news ... smh  live precariousness wealthy powerful worship money You’re entitled opinion. Interestingly, without data dump quest, total case count would’ve It’s slight uptick last Tuesday, bad people making be. problem regulations see product regulatory agency capture, create unintended consequences result. people bemoan said regulations, really seeing co-opted versions them.

This kid may pay steep price failures care holding power doung job. ""parents pool noodles""

I read several times, figure meant? Maybe try saying front mirror first?

Those internet people tough, one day show good! Sure. Thre gulf coast. Obama.  blamed stuff Chomsky said capitalism.  bad talk politicians general.  

Who bad mouthing accelerated vaccine release?  it?  Ask that. Tell look Cargill outbreaks Alberta. would Canadian meat producers lose millions dollars make Trump look bad? 

People evidently really lazy 2020, doubt friends research. [Inside CBC know...fake news. Covid19 person white, current US federal government would eliminated months ago. Yale located hellhole town. round virus? walks person face shield virus needs controlled lockeddown greater extent 99% US population. said, lockdowns one several tools available combat virus. feel ad hominem attacks lead productive conversation.

Just someone believes balanced pragmatic approach mean callous dim witted. believe Fauci would likely recommend universal mask usage, hand washing, social distancing, closing ""high risk"" establishments trying another ""lockdown"" refer vile dim witted. lie deliberately told untruth, unless know know better write article, basis that.

And *not correct*, I'd like word it. Feel free actually share knowledge instead hinting it. Says little dick big asshole. hit number month early. totals? Sanitizer ! hospital? Yes, mean CDC lied. seats recline article. Barriers virus also barriers event evacuation. They’re also likely, designed, produce projectiles crash cause injuries turbulence landings. must single lol.

If SO, he/she would say otherwise. current restrictions mask use.

Given restrictions areas US operating under\* FTFY.

&amp;#x200B;

The locales taking seriously going get slammed flu season, people fear. Coronoavirus blown way proportion. mortality rate incredibly low., especially comparison spread things like swine flu. really severely effects preexisting conditions elderly, according CDC. going back teaching already. strike ridiculous. demands union incredibly costly, funding anywhere moment. even guess long demands would take implement, could indefinite amount time. one decided think months ago, thousands teachers forced strike, losing insurance benefits salary. utter nonsense. Shocked Pikachu Face Alot unravel here. Care elaborate? lot South American countries got hit pretty bad: Chile, Brazil, Bolivia. Ecuador would probably top accurate reporting deaths. edit: removed panama Looking Internet, seems.

I like it, understand people politicize issue USA. absolutely insane me.  Honestly, discussion testing mainly younger people make sense get vaccine efficacy there. get young people prevented getting virus, spread going MUCH slower young people driving start major outbreaks. Also, generally common COVID vaccine hunt right leave age group out. Hell data released today Moderna elderly age group. needless article poke bear antivaxxing. Doctors making right decisions trust knowledge field you. Absolutely. February us tell going issue United States, picked masks, that’s China Europe. US telling us wear masks, something seemed wrong. Yes, lied. making scene becomes endemic like diseases. won’t possible contain 100%. There’s always going possible vector infection documentary Fauci air reason? Either way, CDC could prevented happening clearly understood, correct interpretation publicly available. Duh. Hey, throw states **are** taking seriously bus. federal govt took seriously start shit together whole country would better shape moment time. There's way we'll know works without side effects distribute election. could announce know say, doomers gotta doom… It’s likely lot people didn’t even know according member Facebook group said went walked around without bothering anyone! lie? Oh, cool vitamin help immune system? I'm college research department. counter original argument not. source something says I'm wrong? even doing? Mask wearing Kentuckian here, lets hope it’s mostly people refusing wearing mask and/or social distance falling victim much needed natural selection Hospitalizations fallen cliff. fuck smoking rest world considering CDC recently found conflating nearly 94% deaths caused Covid fact died causes happened Covid systems Christian + evolution. Interesting

Its crazy religious people follow religion first place. even crazier start picking choosing believe specific religion. almost like evil men used religion catalyst acquisition power. posted silly TIFU story u/bootsnboards replied vastly underrated comment: first read full story finally got laugh it, thought sounded like sepsis, lol. I'm glad 9k. many post covid symptoms learning about... Clotting problems etc. wish guys total health.

But post great job putting funny twist subject needs coverage. long list terrible post covid symptoms totally glossed ""recovered"" cases cited. brother-in-law considered recovered case, problem he's left 30% brain function, 10% kidney function, liver infarct on. Yet he's considered covid-19 recovery stat. wife three kids homemaker provide fully disabled husband three children. would better death stat"" Take easy man He's delivering word god people, also delivering people god. Imagine gullible believe propaganda without checking Sky blue take point, obviously variables come play, partially subjective judgement sure. article point directly comparing vs US though, two countries much similar categories. since posed question, answered, yeah, think 22 deaths better 9126 deaths, better 180,000 deaths Americans love liking shatted corporate boots talking free health care bad economy socialistic boohoo corporations fall pandemic, many people they’re getting answers leadership. 9,000!! much proper way describe would 'Positivity rate declined 7.8%'

And means percentage lower, lower what? Last week guess? percentage last week? numbers card game now?

Half numbers coming lately seem vague ambiguous, honestly heard single actual NAME anyone that's died COVID-19, they're 'numbers'... Saddam Hussein deliberately killing people United States stepped bomb shit him.

Do... bomb now? Right. However point flu+Covid overtax already-stretched medical facilities. differences flu Covid really point - least point. Yikes bike. That's serious delusional thinking there. would know ""Chomsky told me"", lol? Dream much?

And even interview right mentions Obama promised hope change, turned around bailed banks, leading resentment disenfrachisement.

In summary, what's point? What's bad thing that's actually thing? ""BuT mUh FrEeDoMs!!!"" Duh. everything require protest? Two words: October surprise. Well, they? “According CDC report 570 patients diagnosed **MIS-C** March July, 364, 64%, spent time intensive care unit.”  want lots things. this: convince god eliminate virus enjoy liberty want. rich damn good union I've probably gotten like 70 replies comment

Yours far dumbest

Congrats! Yeah, I'm gonna drive... Another narcissist risks lives craves audience today 9 Yup, (and four couples) cancelled fall trip Miami. NY large amount cases little warning. Florida plenty warning time peak wanted make sure spring break went hitch. Coug'd Compare even weekend numbers last 3 months. Yakima Co seen pretty massive decline probably closer zero. 

Covid claims grouped ""exposure"" claims. Exposure claim law built around things like asbestos exposure claimant could show direct relationship symptoms exposure hazardous materials. 

The law never designed pandemic response. case people could gotten hospital grocery store Uber eats driver impossible link covid work definitively. 

But state legislature could create provision front line workers like others I'm pretty sure would apply retroactively. one month 7-day daily average went 800+ 470. I'd say that's pretty good decline hear thing influenza deaths previous years mostly statistically derived analyzing deaths based related conditions jump conclusion death tracking fake. work someone like this... I've spoken couple times denies even harder makes working relationship difficult, I'm silent now.

Same guy also thinks BLM anarchist scam trick black people donating anarchist gofundme's form BLM name. Says he's considering starting BLM gofundme cash scam. Worst bit guy immigrant got citizenship 2017 pro-trump got his. even realize reason able come 2012 first place Obama.

Sorry semi-unrelated political rant, one day week work dude pisses much rest day. thought people like rare fringe got confidence start spouting shit. Wish somebody would show Cuomo 40 million chance socially distant dining. FDA want's make sure Dump gets re-elected, willing put entire nations health risk. many million died already? don’t think enough people immunity even successful vaccine probably dealing fucking virus lot longer led believe. Fauci asked (in article) herd immunity could achieved two-thirds population taking vaccine 70% 75% effective. 

“No – unlikely,” said.

1)Scientists hoping coronavirus vaccine least 75% effective, 50% minimum rate effectiveness FDA requiring approval.

2) Health experts predict COVID-19 vaccine less effective obese Americans, could leave 100 million people still vulnerable virus, reports Kaiser Health News. 42% Americans obese. 

3)Recent polls found 50% of  people United States committed receiving vaccine, another quarter lie, best knowledge. FYI University South Carolina (not Southern California) click link... Viral load. said feb everyone went crazy true..smh Yes flu far less contagious isn’t really doesn’t transmit asymptomatic also sort vaccine. Well feel people Auckland especially keep locking down. said it’s main driver infections wrong forum that. bad Chomsky tell people tell anything get elected.  sides.  force workers come back unsafe workplace? Vogue??? Fucking Vogue?  Posted Sub?  

I seen article published 10 times sub every dumb ass publication imagine?  Gotta plot conspiracy something.  

Is serious damn pandemic?  exercise political screwing around?  serious pandemic people dying large numbers vaccine need get vaccine soon amount certaintly works. already know safe phase 2.  

Has Jenny McCarthy taken world?  

If political gamesmanship, delay crowd deserves lose lose badly never elected again, would totally despicable tactic.  

So folks tell me... Pandemic Not. Serious Not. That's even said tho. dumber that. comorbidities like respiratory failure pneumonia. things caused catching Covid. 6% listed COVID cause. 95% listed COVID primary cause 160K deaths. Oh? That's analogous headline says tho... No, think that's part it. think closing schools large part well. Many people switched working home. Many people one big shopping trip week rather 2/3 smaller trips. several things.

Knowing know now, think real lockdown even makes sense. Universal mask usage, wash hands, close ""high risk"" establishments (i.e. bars) would get better results lower cost. Especially measures protect risk populations. 

I mainly pointing Florida ""real"" lockdown. Especially one implemented community spread control. Looking Florida specifically; opened soon got caught manipulating numbers hit ""opening benchmarks"" really achieved. 

End day, ""It is"". understand different people different risk profiles/tolerances. see public willingness US take steps needed control virus like NZ did. poll poll, random statistical sampling common method acceptable margin error. Results line pretty well life experience past 6 months. Feel free continue burying head sand though. Could be. necessarily would depending process data. mean I'd say actually rather difficult major cities even use local language. speak English about...200x better speak French, German, Italian, Greek etc.

And taken travelers courses languages places too. sort a, kidding here, speak English fluently near fluently, cut chase. even don't, let's honest better Italian.

Only time actually **had** use German learned something train broke transfer tiny Germany village lady working know English all.  goal testing identify sick. know you’re sick. 

Mass testing done find sick potentially spreading virus without knowing. It’s containment 

We quarantine contain. 

Also, aren’t arguing. make clear. don’t think I’m contradicting you, trying explain article tagged said. 

And said, symptomatic get PCR, well previous positives. PCR takes hours complete sometimes days result work loads. 

Asymptomatic get rapid. That’s one go CVS, lot places, they’ll give really quick. Times vary methods vary, usually takes roughly 15mins. rapids small versions PCR much fewer cycles. antigen detect. 

Nearly negative negative. week quarantine takes get solid negative, don’t see reason taking it. Esp middle pandemic? 

I don’t answer right many cycles use, hospital separates molecular/micro general lab. could find work tonight. 

Honestly though, strife? interpreting article? looking “holes” testing? sensitive specific ideal kind testing. false positives would different conversation. false negatives sure possibility rapid routes, cost much less appropriate purposes serve too. Carlisle, Type 1 diabetic Texas, sometimes tried eat days time, attempt ration insulin. 18 short cash, even contemplated robbing pharmacy, says. ""I always math many days' supply insulin refrigerator,"" 60-year-old Texan says.  know lifespan point. lifespan measured exactly many days' worth insulin hand -- plus three days.""

That happen third world country, tbh, let alone one richest countries world. fucking September. smart decision April. Death rate humans still 100%. dont like it, dont go game. Oh don’t forget people obesity, diabetes, hypertension, that’s fault “lifestyle choices” would died earlier anyway That’s bug, it’s feature Anti-maskers still think don’t wear mask ones taking risk. don’t get mask stops spreading germs. Remindme! 1 year doubt, pointing even 35 days off, weekend trip Europe really thing could need practice reading comprehension. Right, that's worked well... /s

Also virus causing heart inflammation, lung scarring, blood clots brain even mild/asymptomatic cases young people, sure, let entire young population ""go daily lives"" get knocked possibly permanent serious side effects... live Midwest, everybody know sneezed couple times last 5 months, obviously already it....... many times gotta prove masks work realize anti mask people give shit? Ohio State University parents holding large protests allow kids play. school, kids, PARENTS pushing kids play. ""If get car, get work"" mantra I'm sick injured. paid time whatsoever, can't afford miss day spine pinching nerve cold feels like death. lot Americans avoiding testing working virus, can't afford miss single day work. susceptibility spread""

That's crazy, touting people know while, know actually concept name epidemiology! give name talk it! Thanks, Well starters take try’s use data spread virus 1918 spread virus 2020, instantly discarded utter nonsense. 

It’s hard notice, appreciate, things changed 102 years. Damn, suspected. already stuff (never stopped tbh), guess careful. Might get tested safe. God country sucks hard See previous reply thos thread. depends efficiency vaccine, i.e. percentage people vaccinated creates immunity.
IIRC, threshold approve vaccine said 60%. case vaccine provide individual protection works administered large percentage population.  leadership B1G Pac-12 concerned image liability student health. happy let SEC, ACC Big-12 start playing football fans stands versus trusting protocol testing 3x/week, keeps student athletes campus younger population (vs parents grandparents home) 

This literally game every year, half dozen kids straight die field hits, heatstroke undetected ailments manifest, mention hundreds thousands suffer career life-altering injuries result time playing football. No, America turn inward. rest world go back experimenting illiberalism. work. Great. system shitty/faulty expected 😫 get tested later safe? somewhere supposed report contacted like be? fun picture! Lice checks day? back March, we’re distance learning I’ve seen current students pretty aware COVID what’s appropriate inappropriate. Religion secondary value. Religion used means create control main values.

This obvious evangelicals continued support Trump Republicans. can’t bothered read past first line drivel looking argument, none. Fuck off. sounds like schools aren’t ready open yet. go online rest year wait vaccine rolled out. Good job it’s 2020 1918, medicine literally 100 years progression research. dunce. borders Mexico actually closed.  still fly.  still fly Cancun healthcare costs 1/3 less would US. Anyone ever played wind instrument knows spit filled virus blasters and. NY lot testing low positivity rate .

If anyone open properly it’s us r/subsithoughtifellfor/ York, PA great indicator Comments like common sub infested people literally love spreading misery doomsday predictions they’re miserable people feel better others equally unhappy. It’s choice closing society totally opening totally. extensive measures between. ample evidence virus generates B cell antibody memory cell immunity. one (maybe two) peer reviewed case studies 3 reinfected patients, less symptoms second time. saying “the disease even worse fear” doesn’t mean inherently unsustainable lockdown policy becomes sustainable. brief description immunity garbled. cells don’t specifically mediate early immunity. B cell cell responses begin immediately (Some cells assist antibody function) create memory cells. Antibodies wane weeks, that’s normal. Actually everything immune response looks completely unremarkable standard including response Oxford vaccine. 

I mean disease infected 100% people left every single victim blind paralyzed, might hide house one year even fifteen maybe died old age. think need balance bad Covid actually seems rest benefits society house arrest (not mention importance providing non Covid related health care). ‘no country pretend pandemic over’

Sure US can! give month two election ends! said. exactly saying. excuse mediocrity, excuse people supposed doing, even lockdown. absolutely excuse allowing people starve abundant food.  ""the death rate lower normal long time would likely continued way"" 

... people stop dying? think works? flu season 2019 exceptionally mild (which everyone agrees on) means larger proportion fragile population survived 2019 would otherwise died then.. fragile population becoming less fragile flu year milder. Yeah well, hope people become statistic chart. World better off. clear long-term effects whereas 'long-term Covid' hallmarks anxiety.

""Ooh I'm always tired, ooh brain's bit foggy.""

Yeah, whatever Becky, got yearning attention dose anxiety. Go read ethical skeptic twitter, presents lot information different way I’m sure everyone suv used seeing. Give solve perspective least coworkers talking Yes, potential issues Apple’s data. Google data doesn’t issues.

Although course can’t tell sudden unexplained spike making strangers something Covid, nice proxy measures taken. Yeah, srsly. Yeah actually curious decision post piece piece itself. That's bad is. vaccine 98% effective, provides direct individual protection. case sufficient let everyone make choice whether take risk vaccine risk corona. 

However, vaccine 60% effective, large percentage population needs vaccined provide protection less eradicating virus. longer individual choice.

However, people low risk corona see risk vaccine differently, particular vaccine tested months only, long term effects assessed. 

I would find unethical force people low risk Corona, e.g. children, take vaccine unclear risk long term effects order protect grandparents. read it, it’s “percentage” coronavirus become severe second spike yes, getting people ICU result. happens though second wave? lot people get sick six digit hospital bill lifelong medical complications die.

So, anyone governor knows, making impossible give damn. fact small reduction ""retail recreation"" category makes strong argument never real lockdown. Ultimately, mobility data proxy variable best. 

End day, NZ couple places done real lockdown gotten community spread control (at least while). Jokes aside, Florida lockdown hard enough long enough considered real lockdown. No, he's typical internet loser. Long-term consequence posts pretty easy find. Go long haulers sub. Albeit, lots people think bunch hypochondriacs. agree, companies reward perfect attendance shit poor attendance. sick? Well job come today. Sorry bud. Oh kid sick can't go school? bad, attendance record standard. Dose kid medicine ship school infect everyone else. Maternity leave? that. need that. come work week old baby home. Sorry rant over. Heard that. I've tracking economic data see interesting trends boy interesting things going on. 

It helps see lines little bit, never tell whole story. Everyone always seems inclined tell others know full story, know? bit delayed notes briefing:

* report presented different press conference earlier today developments (expected prepared for) autumn. developed collaboration several different authorities (and municipalities/regions?), FHM. present different measures taken local level supress spread infection case local outbreaks, expect occur autumn. Wide-spread infection society (on national level, local) unprobable local outbreaks handled well time. Different measures, including clearer rules quarantining tracing people infected outlined. Masks also used complementary certain situations. People live others infected might quarantine well (even asymptomatic) negative tests confirmed. 
* 150 people cared hospital COVID-19, 20 (6%) ICU respirators. 11 regions normal mode now, remaining still ""staff mode"" (due restricted staff, mostly holidays) situation still getting better. 
* Protective equipment shortage start pandemic, Socialstyrelsen better prepared capacity this. 
* production distribution certain medicine dependent global market risk certain products missing. report analyzes type medicine quantities needed national level hospitals patients also forecast ongoing future use allow certain quantities needed.
* new recommendations testing younger students/kids allow return school mild symptoms negative COVID-19. Previously students even mildest symptoms stay home week, least two days symptoms disappeared.
* new study shows infection spread society (based self-sampling sent 4000 people) shown next days. 

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

The human response drug variation individuals incredibly complex even 2020 barely handle happening. know people would like must secret time machines home stuck 1917. Including claim masks make things worse. cannot reply - Swedish Re-Education Camp death rate lower normal long time would likely continued way therefor best compare 2019 years.

I heard official changes mitigation plan. still ""wash hands"", ""Stay home sick"" ""flatten curve"". seem shift towards supression plan people living together infected person go work. 

And quaratine recommendations people returning abroad matter severe outbreak return from. 

I suggest quaratine people returning high infected areas first official statement herd immunity plan abandoned. Wave 3 happen. There's barely wave 2. much boat US been, one part (and shit job part) well, missing two effective.

Medicine literally advanced 102 years since 1918. Extrapolation 1918 death toll illogical

Your stat Covid 40% fatal Spanish flu straight bs 

China, even though extreme measures, already back normal. FACT: passenger flight levels pre pandemic

All mass cohesive bla bla attempt say denial river Egypt sophisticated way. People income jobs affected trust aware damn well what’s going on

You accounted vaccine therapeutics pipeline available 1918 bio medical companies know tech funding also available 1918

FACT: Everyday world becoming familiar Covid recovery rates getting better 

Bill Gates second biggest donor US, biggest, heavily involved vaccines even Covid, said according extensive data available worst case scenario back normal end 2021

You couldn’t farther even tried buddy I’m almost positive still travel Mexico, I’ve seen multiple people know posting pictures within last month funny Bernie pointed flaws part campaign try repair it, everyone voted Biden instead. familiar American politics boggles mind Yes, likely know people legitimate medical reasons cannot vaccinated. 22 year old peer immunocompromised able tell unless told you. I'd guess people near similar boat. rely people get vaccinated establish herd immunity. 

Also depending magnitude nonacceptance, could strain healthcare resources making harder get medical attention need it, likely pales comparison incredibly vulnerable people mentioned first. Wow glanced word global, thats bad. rushed politicians vindication way thinking,companies want enforce standards either customers employees, anti-vaxxers want fail. None people first line gain issues. NZ say standout performer, it’s kept beginning lucky enough subsequently screw anything (unlike home state Australia). rest countries already established extensive community transmission unfortunately best option probably impose stringent restrictions maintained longterm (as ban large gatherings, don’t try set 23-hour curfew). Yes lots old people die young healthy people too. It’s nature pandemic. people might best placed sheltering home vaccine. I’m subject 23 hour/day home detention pretty much little chance wiping virus out, none maintaining populations cooperation it’s imposed again.  would criticize doctor that's willing criticize hypothetical vaccine even initial phase 3 data for. would seriously hope would willing read data available chose recommend recommend something. vaccine, I'm sure stop this.

Masks delay, stop, inevitable. American here. anyone know approximately long takes healthcare authorities whatever reach ""close contact"" someone tested positive covid? know fact one employees tested positive last week, work extremely close quarters day, definitely fall ""close contact"" guidelines set cdc. Tuesday still yet contacted. normal? supposed situation? respond post pointing true polio, vast majority people die it, either? like think CDC run intelligent people -- intelligent possibility idiots misreading information spreading bullshit actually says even radar, course happens, go ""surprised Pikachu face."" think article misses context. multiple countries developing vaccines already say China least wait till lengthy phase 3 trials completed. imagine vaccine come year early next year.

When everywhere except maybe US europe buy smaller countries around world desperate let economies open again.

I know sub wants wait phase 3 trials completely done (though suspect biden becomes president wont care anymore) point though looking scenario entire world vaccinated except US. surprise, misquoted him! never said that. Literally first words video, conveniently linked skip over, are, “The masks important.” 

Have lies?!! trying get thing going! Sounds v scientific... tree fiddy still hypothesis? exact opposite. want people take steps needed safe. want one else die, get sick, infect anyone else suffer long term consequences. 

It’s possible contain virus thrive vigilant testing tracing isolating. easily political economic it. think going watching infection rates go back up.  People see rate climb take precautions rate goes down.  get tired restriction let loose little rate goes back up. Add mix, confused jumble government messaging conspiracy theories see US getting anything truly control long time. Individual lessons even entire curricula look different online vs person. long term goals teachers teaching toward. Going back forth unpredictable teachers students get consistent series lessons. Iowa. Exactly Government shouldn’t control Healthcare. many dead Americans herd immunity? still won’t matter many times say it.

Abolishing child labor laws, establishing minimum wage, literally every bit social safety net ever enacted fought somebody profiting society’s unneeded pain.  Meanwhile school live front FL full blown open again. gaurantee kids likely sick. point solely discredit article? search ""inoculation truth"" 5th link down. wonder people keep complaining..

😔 Joe Biden gets elected better believe whole country shut month.  Ok? Wtf want do? Wait Covid gone? Wait 0 cases? can't keep kids learning going school. Actually, already do.

Don’t wear one? can’t shop here. guess HIV #3 history list?

How COVID-19 compare (as August 27, 2020) epidemics &amp; pandemics?

SARS (2002-3): 8,100 cases, 774 deaths [9.6% CFR]

MERS (2012-present): 2,500 cases, 858 deaths [34% CFR]

Ebola (2014-16): 29k cases, 11,300 deaths [40% CFR]

H1N1 (2009-10): 1.6B infections (24% population), 284k deaths (150k - 575k) [0.02% IFR]. Real time reporting less 1M cases 18k deaths. Still seasonal flus

Seasonal Flu (annual, variants): 1B infections, 5M serious cases, 290k-650k deaths [0.1% CFR, 0.022% IFR]

[3.4% CFR, estimated 0.7+/-0.2% IFR]
	At current pace, eclipse 1M late September exceed non-1918 flu deaths sometime October.
	(if 60% worldwide get infected vaccination 0.5% IFR = 23M deaths projected [987k US])

H3N8 Flu (1889-90): 1M deaths

H3N2 Flu (1968-9): 1M deaths (100k US), still seasonal flus

3. less snowflakes States Vaccine, hoax, fake news, alternative facts over, yeah inoculation zoned on. Makes Blunt: 190,000 Americans Would Still Alive the...
Trump Administration. FTFY. appreciate thoughtful analysis, however.

I've talking testing issues past month I'm sure seen recent NYT piece curious think big deal. good day depends. little guy got hand foot mouth disease 4 times 1 year. That’s week every time. one questioned science earth would still flat center Universe, tobacco big deal, fat means you’re wealthy, thinking it’s contagious, we’d still 1970’s theory global cooling. People ask parents ""Aren't worried crime?"" dad says ""Yes, that's moved here."" millions people died holocaust happen.

This actually mean anything. Florida lol lot people seem forget CDC actually publishes data, free, clearnet. appears many redditors can't handle heroic task interpreting data own, rely garbage-tier journalism them. kids whose science teacher gives quiz one correct answers covid-19 scam. isn’t even worded true false question. Here's   find bizarre rationalize paying $150 month plus $4000-$6000 year maintain heath.

It's even crazier see anything wrong this. 40,000-60,000 people year United States would still alive flu season. Unless accelerate vaccine, unacceptable media may benefit Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. Sigh. Politics. Yes, Australia one worst *paid* maternity leave provisions developed nations. embarrassed compared countries Canada anywhere Europe (or New Zealand- PM Jacinda Arden went maternity leave tenure, appointed deputy leader charge absence). 

That Americans none appalling. Ok thought vaccines go testing approval. lived place I’d give edge Georgia. Alabama enters chat, bets off. Meanwhile one trumps advisers pushing herd immunity.

Please favor read Sweden's COVID response. social distancing measures FAR softer states tried (and still trying) (Sweden even encouraging masks!). appearance Sweden reached herd immunity levels (as modified limited social distancing) I'm jealous. It’s weird TX state (with occasional exception FL) posters seem view competition states. Sure not...

Hospitalizations bottom Florida 3400 around September 14, rise back 6000 end October. Thats whole lot Trumps inauguration crowd size. lot time passes child born child going school. Many things happen time. comments mean nothing. Wonder could reverse sort study researching people currently taking Lithium faring positive Covid. Like, milder cases?

 (And continue psych meds people hospitalized Covid?)  Scientists question challenge scientific conclusions every day.

You would foolish equal scientific discussions processes anti-science attitude. No, merely said way make statement like asserting something true. saying ""yeah he's close enough okay"". No.

Cause know damn well someone-else-who-shall-not-be-named made ""maybe true"" comment would Snopes article detailing not. Same. We're virtual guaranteed happen. unfortunate lot people resources take option though. Still crazy front page reddit. Yeah virus fully endemic US now, antivax time high, country going cut rest world while. first part solution educate people use masks social distance properly. Every political leader spread message uniformly consistently. Every TV station reiterate message every hour every day. People need put social pressure violate norms. Government enforce rules strictly possible.

Second part solution wide spread, fast cheap testing. able test every worker every day every business open immediately. able test everyone go movie theater fill now. sort utopia either. people work cheap rapid testing right now. scientifically possible. matter investment scaling. impossible.  oh wow really? well, directly contradicts said racism really exist, let's ignore minute. 
 
 
i never said person certain race disciplined must racist motive. 
what i'm saying know racists exist, small percentage balls actively discriminate races like, avoid creating vague rules easily used people positions power discriminate based race. historically, vague rules used way time time discriminate people, race. studied, read it. trust me, look up. Well, can't realistically expect people live slums need work every day get food table quarantine work home 14 days, certain extent inevitable. teach middle school. I’ve students approach say “I’m feeling well mom/dad made come today, lay head instead math today?”

Of course can. Key word: Global. opionion straugh forward protest times like mask spacing ppl.
if not, dissolve protest. nope Guess really can’t trust anyone 

You SURE cannot trust random post reddit, worldometers.info one click away think fit none realms still 1% chance dying even greater chance long term played enough pen papers know don’t want chance life D100 greater chance unintentionally poisoning yourself. Unfortunately, news. happening United States. sad reality. Working class people overwhelmingly want schools remain closed. Please use shield. Lol look U.S, hell even think it’s everyone around living life spending time friends suggest start ones animal testing (I mean extreme ones sensible ones unnecesary alternatives available) Unfortunately victims disproportionately minorities poor, administration care much. CDC averages say 270,000 would alive today normal year. February 1 July 24 (the recent week fairly complete data) US Deaths - Causes 115% Expected. 270,000 Americans died expected die last 6 months.

But, let's figure back napkin values compare choices countries. US currently 569 Deaths / 1M Population. managed well countries below, deaths today (with difference still alive) would be:

US: 187,770 (baseline)
Canada: 79,860 (107,910 alive)
Germany: 36,960 (150,810 alive)
Norway: 16,170 (171,600 alive)
Iceland: 9,570 (178,200 alive)
S. Korea: 1,980 (185,790 alive)

To fair, could done worse equivalent countries:

Sweden: 189,750
UK: 201,630
Spain: 205,590
Peru: 289,080 Trump* clue universities fraternities sororities given hazing rape culture goes there. lot articles Sweden US media painted Sweden zombie wasteland fucked completely sacrificed grandmas, articles *always* pointed Sweden higher death rate US whole. (Despite fact many New England states twice death rate Sweden)

When US officially passes Sweden's covid-19 death rate, articles instantly become worthless, US media can't write new ones, means they'll stop using Sweden argument internal US political debate, Swedish person, that's going very, very, very, nice.

The focus Sweden, amount massive misunderstandings Swedish strategy Swedish restrictions completely fucking insane year, can't wait go away. Leave Sweden alone, kthxbye. school flat told us come sick call get picked up. long showed up, got paid attendance.  Cain deserved die

He's still posting Twitter (from looks like virus deadly mainstream media first made death, he's right, what? Would believe know everything virus back January mainstream media first started reporting it? almost seems obvious... said factually wrong. 

Try analogy out.

If fauci says 9x9 80. say way 9x9 4.


One would wrong. One close enough. Get it? I’m trying sound condescending question genuine curiosity don’t kids myself. kids really get sick 10 days year? remember getting sick once, maybe twice per year. Well luckily work someone results oriented rather attendance oriented never problems taking time off. think key. Still enough put kids. 30 days ago, Denmark 7-day moving average 26 daily new cases, according Worldometers. July 9th, average 14.

August 31: 84 daily new cases, 7-day moving average. **320% Denmark 30 days didn’t work you

Allow lmao. Fortunately current presidential advisor keen herd immunity. [Oh  reporting option you? That's fucked original ACA nice try getting lessons learned Europe people US. Unfortunately, GOP saw something could blame Obama completely dismantled it. passed end, Obama intended made things worse. course, things got changed health care providers would lose/gain money with. ACA US deal today prime example capitalism work, makes rich people richer poor people poorer.  opposite situation happen least 3 times. Parents sent school sick, nurse confirms low grade fever, nurse gives medicine &amp; calls parents, dad arrives medicine helps lower fever, ""Weird never sick come pick up."" Fake positive “How Covid-19 Misinformation Circulates Social Media”? 

Like Covid-19 circulates Sunbelt “America’s Heartland” — is, like fire Thanks kind words, mostly joking... I'm glad I've mostly kept various bits pants years. Blessed underactive sex drive, suppose haha. Honestly, don’t think anyone gives two shits perfect attendance award – students parents. It’s parents either feeling guilty missing work and/or sick time take full day mean rise rent costs shortage supply rental units  I'm giving light December-January. can't entire year misery nothingness, March-May sound soon enough. [A simple Google search would prove actually know this. mask mandate February, really spreading hugely outside NY NJ, many health care workers would likely died given produced. reduced capacity could increased spread death rate. 

This mean governments around world massively scaled mask making, instructed everyone make cheaply, set distribution system, etc. Nearly 10 months mess still plan get N95 equivalent masks everyone. Fauci never position make happen. case, call republican Thank clarification valid points kind mystery voice onlineverse. I’ll happily admit best stay well away form engagement anti-vaxxers. ammo argue misfortune encounter would good though. thank kindly. enough trouble anti-mask contingent family members refer Doc Fauci “Lord Fauci.” I’m starting see though may espouse anti-vax sentiments. Again, good points, many thanks. Damage done, conspiracy nut going give shit clarification retraction. Yes positivity misinformation sub ask Canada, Germany, Italy, UK, Sweden, Norway - countries managed contain outbreak much better US. 

Hell, US DOUBLE per capita deaths entirety Europe. Lockdown inevitable outcome containment failure. Nobody wants one, forced us keep healthcare system under-capacity. So, what's containment plan? I'm hearing fewer tests, reopen everything, let people decide whether masks them.

The lockdown result federal government failure, Governor. they.

Kid sent home displaying symptoms told test. Answer: depends. depends upon factors age, race, family history, weight, level physical activity, tobacco use, salt intake, potassium intake, alcohol consumption, stress, etc..
 
Hypertension alone lead heart attack, stroke, aneurysm, heart failure,etc..
 
So possible, hypothetical scenario, COVID-19 kill you. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* kid running fever Friday morning. informed work coming would go doctor get sorted I'd keep updated. Turned strep throat covid tests administered. Yesterday turned time sheet (I'm overtime exempt salary), put time covid related. came back said I'd use vacation cover it, gotten covid test would covered cares act would paid however long took get negative result back (typically 3-5 days).

I argued taking stance 1) encouraging come I'm potentially infected 2) would rather longer get paid good reason day get paid.

Ultimately able make point covered it, first argument ""we're trying follow letter law."" 

So, totally understand people go sick, especially they're living paycheck paycheck. We're fucked, part. America bad, Canada good Hey, school willing pay doctor, great!! Thanks! is... Descriptive! would think place full intillectuals, college, shit like would obviously avoidable. dont understand excuse. Thats assuming kids home dont common sense. cant possible stay home? Edited original. That's sub rules. surprised? way approved getting enough data US participants gets approved emergency use. Otherwise they're going wait data take another months gather Dude, girls bathroom high school? Fucking disgusting. many students 65+? many, any. Elementary school go 9-5 (or whatever schedule person working usually) go year.

What pre-elementary school kids?

Also elementary school extremely important children's brain development. Comparing daycare asinine. look reddit email. note went everyone (student parents) school district end school day. they?

Honest question assume talking University Illinois like one week classes right?

My reservations system tests identify people already covid may already spreading, saliva tests use false negative rate 20%, expense semester going quite high. addressed?

But time tell guess. Even 6% statistic correct , still 10,980 healthy people died preventable death. still 3.688 9/11's. year's flu season Southern Hemisphere weirdly surprisingly small number people Southern Hemisphere gotten flu year, probably public health measures put place fight COVID-19 also limited spread influenza.
That makes public health experts hopeful U. S. northern countries might spared double whammy COVID-19 bad flu season winter. Honestly think there's culture blaming people medical conditions US even nothing ""lifestyle choices"".

I can't tell many people suggested becoming closer God heal chronic illness. low-key underlying statement ""if healthy, praying hard enough, so... fault"".

And look Trump talked medical bills brief period taking pandemic seriously-- kept saying people would need care ""through fault own"". That's fucking weird. Like, who's going around getting MRI scans MS taking meds autoimmune disorder through... fault own? give shit bills? nothing rights. simply matter killing fewest people: medicine (lockdown) kill people disease (COVID). something almost everyone understand 1-2 years.  likely tested *before*, get results back school already started.

However, kids tested, know around someone and/or showing symptoms. So, send test results get back? make sense. promise? 12? Oh, absolutely! need get word start challenging bull shit.

Keep fight! like Einstein confirm 2 + 2 does, fact, equal 4. i'd less bearish lockdown tried already. manila hard, hard lockdown 100-ish days. back march/april happening people sense community. like ""do now, never again."" people happy social media eclipsed length wuhan lockdown, people thought came we'd look like china relatively safe. 

but lockdown never actually stopped trickle cases shot exit. every time government announces something people dread new restrictions, leave manila vacation homes, etc. dont think recapture feeling first lockdown again. 

if first lockdown (i'm airballing here) 95% compliance, second would less 70%. first lockdown work, second torpedoing everyone's income much benefit. i'd rather spend money contact tracing tbh. dont talk many people outside philippines know guy india who's similarly despondent prospect lockdown. sub jerks ""compliance"" asian nations breaking point like every country. know single person wear mask here. even homegrown crazy religious cult cool restricting gatherings. that's much ask 100 days lockdown

sorry ended rambling. wanted vent strange things Well linked article would fine, wasn't. cant afford anymore ever since became lethal. read it. That’s said I’m glad getting money NY slashing. making comparison two locations two different political support. happening slowly province. yeah done lot sooner. mandatory soon decided change minds saying masks work beyond me. reasoning backwards. never wear mask I'm Florida. normal life past months, nothing's changed people dropping like flys. us already covid-19, realized different flu &amp; go lives. zero fear, locking inside year, wearing mask little 5 minute store trip month &amp; spreading dooms day b.s. living fear looks like. Even half assed healthy people easily live thru virus, healthy people ones carrying future, reality that's matters. healthy means horde house till death eventually comes anyways, that's right. job stay home wear usless mask though. CDC controlled pressure lies White House, please protect children! failure CDC politicized. blame lies politicians US. SIDES EQUALLY! Plaque houses. May republicans democrats perish equally it’s leaders punished severely either force known unknown. line hear often Covid gone November lmao. Yea global pandemic disappear think US election. Also, pandemic helps trump rather hurt him. played way suppress votes making people scared personally vote see USPS dismantled see low functioning postal service influx mail-in ballots. Ha forgot that. Walmart mask day got positive result back reason know chronic conditions anything immediately dying COVID related classified 'elective procedure'?

*Even diagnosed, think everyone easily afford stay put go out*
So people can't afford stay home, we'll make everyone stay home? Huh? TIL colleges South Dakota arrests? breaking Statewide ordinance endangering people. Ok, exaggeration. However, trend holds, assume doubling cases every three days, two weeks gives us 4.5 3-day periods. We'll round 4 generous.

So assuming present infection rate measures taken reduce spread, would see 1% 2% 4% 8% 16% two weeks.

Given that, looks like would take one week longer (three weeks total) go 50%. Well people drop dead immediately getting it. Mortality 1 two weeks after. several weeks time spike. outside, literally way constantly maintain distance. 

Sorry, you’re wrong. Maybe circumstances go, easily maintain **safe** distance, many times CDC recommendations, I’m outdoors *at places personally frequent*. homeless dude sprints me, whatever scenario you’ll come next comment, mask pocket seconds I’ll need many hours I’m outdoors. I’ve never found need put mask times I’ve gone hiking/beach there’s many people out, see someone approaching, step aside let pass, or, shockingly, same.

I imagine wear mask time regardless need. That’s fine, want *feel* safe, please refrain calling liar telling I’m impossible. goes lifetime perfect attendance award. top two comments sounds awfully similar top three comments sub 17 days ago... kept fever went home gone good nights rest...

I bronchitis long turned pneumonia. chronic cough now, sleeping certain houses makes worse. 

My mom WORST about, deal it. wonder many flu cold waves caused since never allowed stay home. get kids fake it, could never stay home, good grades missing days wouldn’t hurt way. Come on, embarrassing now. Funny seen documentaries Jim Jones lately. 

Red America one giant Jonestown. team-controlled planes buses testing protocols. Friday Night Lights everyone packs pack pickup trucks, gets buddies along way everyone plays football. US. article referencing England. blame reading it. amount ads underwhelming journalism par would expect web address. one could predicted. guess today must slow, single person getting covid news. brutal, also temporary crisis over. they're back relatively normal. kid's school, need doctor's note missing 3 days. know, everyone insurance access medical services Texas. /s Elementary school *is* largely publicly funded childcare. Yes, almost leader country, risk factor, protected average slob walking streets America. 
This like saying Obamas office, hypocrites sending Sasha Malia Sidwell Friends DC Secret Service protection rather DC public schools. could forget? think also says fourth term say mean things you. Guess we're fucked. rest world working tests, fair

tests denied Americans 'leadership', 'leadership' *still* wants suppress testing I've read taken stance repeat large scale second lockdowns feasible majority world economically. statwd first lockdown meant buy countries time get thier shit together (which course haven't) means anti-lockdown realistically local lockdowns feasible long term.  sort trends? I'm interested hear more. 0 deaths... work assisted living kitchen serve rooms use plastic styrofoam everything. go 20-30 bags trash one facility everyday. 80 people. Also don’t recycle cans water bottles boss cheap lazy extra recycling bins outside. sure that's oncoming train lol There's nothing like giant wall rally motivate followers!

Especially they're people ignore problem invisible affect directly. wait US trials approving? done September. absolutely planning getting vaccinated wife soon vaccine available.

I sure son 6 however. I'm convinced less risk vaccine short term testing rather take chances virus basically effect children (statistically). guess sister NY. Teachers union carries lot weight State, ditto 1192 major NYC unions. course NY Union stronghold country new unions form fairly often compared States.


I agree unions serving members much used to, former Steward explain why. lack participation union members unions become terrible. active membership, better union. People lazy nowadays truly understand unions work necessary make viable. Let’s say someone standing inches away sneezed right face, would want wearing mask not? 

So, yes...masks protect wearers too. Yes. living Fort Lauderdale area. mid March-mid May, thing open grocery store gas station mentioned above. bars, beaches, fun 2 months. wasn’t mid May things slowly began open limited capacity. administration leaves (fingers crossed January)

Did mean January, 2029? hear 22nd Amendment gives third term spy you. Sadly really fucking people depend Canadian prices healthcare, particularly insulin. They've cut alternatives. Proof. matter lockdown not, we'll deaths failed economy.

If less death, struggling economy recover.

We need mild lockdowns. Bars gyms closed. Restaurants half capacity. Mandatory masks business capacity. We'd control. That’s exactly happen. employers can’t pay premium increases related COVID infections, force take aggressive measures prevent FL's deaths avoidable NY, NJ, MA, CT CA's unavoidable? That's actually great idea. every ten comments something, doubt anyone would notice except actively trying disseminate propaganda. Well according **lying hypocrite** Extreme RW GOP, pandemic already ""over"". 2 months seeing vaccines coming phase 3 trials. People need stop wasting time stuff like this. NOTHING change people’s minds. astounds many people seem completely unaware 1% rate death means.

Also, shitload people seem denial risk factors. can't tell many people see saying ""it's old &amp; sick people die"" 70s even 80s. They're literal grandparents. They're grandparents everyone talking saving. think realize that. Partly think messaging blame-- literally one thinks ""old"". say ""over 50"" something instead, something people group admit to/relate to/feel part of.

And co-morbidities too, seem heads either. mother law keeps saying ""but high blood pressure, take medication it"" want bang head wall. mean could asymptomatic  I'm gonna sing doomed song now: [Doom Doom Doom Doom] virus loves human stupidity.

CDC pretty much went rogue... always 3 major testing past couple months. reading headlines try sensationalize situation Who’da thunk? No, I'm sure many older idiots younger ones (although maybe less, adjusted survival rate idiots). pointing simple locking old folk. trust China Tribunal judgement? No, I've read it, you? evidence consists ""China transplants must harvest organs"" ""look unverified anecdotal evidence"" worst ""Falun Gong said media outlets"" (look up, they're Chinese equivalent Scientologists, believe God sent Donald Trump destroy china)

I eat Chinese propaganda, equally eat Western propaganda, Reddit blindly following western narrative blindly following CCP narrative, I'll help telling consider valid source

1- Well sourced academic papers

2- Truly independent international bodies (as in, UN, World Bank etc. Nothing US CCP direct control over, government funded ""NGOs"")

3- Verified video evidence (of concentration camps, deny re-education camps exist, video academic evidence existence)

Basically, cited essay university, would accepted valid source? Anecdotal evidence unsourced media stories wouldn't. can't find anything would, would possibly believe true? dont understand havent figure blast non-biodegradable crap space sun. (and dont mean orbit loaded shit already) doesn’t screw everyone equally, agree system doesn’t screw people based 3-4 factors (race, gender, sexual orientation, income), probably hundreds factors could cause someone get screwed or, flip side, give someone advantage. deaths covid get ""Trump NOTHING""? never said that... nice dodge actually said. [the current CDC IFR estimate still talking 6 times IFR seasonal flu. even setting aside fatalities, unknowns regarding long term effects mild cases troubling. side note, personal financial devastation hospital stay mostly unique U.S., plenty incentive want serious-but-not-deadly infection.

How protect 65+ population disease circulating among 1% population? answer change we're talking 2%? 5%? dilemma rough specifically people routinely interact 65+ people, clear morally owe accommodate acquaintances, colleagues, friends, family. bubble rest society say goodbye 2022? work minimize risk order protect others second order risk infecting others? Almost us within 1 2 degrees separation high risk person care about.

Most importantly - we've seen Italy done it. went active, overwhelming epidemic reopened economy society, actually able smash curve. frustrating saw possible go high infection numbers back low residual background cases 2 months' time. 6 months. never actually got cases U.S., we're perpetually stuck Italy April, May, June, July, August, can't expected live like this.

I agree frustrating. like options table carefully managed trade-offs. People governments stopped low risk activities (closing parks trails) encouraging high risk activities, like drinking strangers crowded indoor environments. agree need take managed risks, seems people actually considering costs benefits semblance rational way. oversimplification may best answer, practically speaking. Yup. wife ED doc. doesn’t work directly hospitalized patients. knows docs do. I’ve listened talk sick people even don’t die, rough time end hospital. People idea survive it’s fine dandy. don’t take consideration 2 week ICU stay someone. try explain people care mortality look, instead, hospitalization rate. That’s true telling number. 

And course that’s really raise mortality rate too. enough people get sick hospitals won’t able hospitalize need to. guess happens need medical care can’t get it. 😵

The reason mortality rate low is, slowed spread measures. 

We pretty low hit area we’ve hospital fill 3 times season already. Everyone worried flu season. well flu season census summer. intentional coordinated disinformation campaign. people sheltering place time? UK opening now. Obviously workplaces follow Bars restaurants Eat shit fascist love robot much goddamn frightening. Good god, keep missing point. complaining president needs extra security precautions, stop attacking strawman already. They're saying fact WH bothers precautions indicates respect dangerousness virus. angry Quest backlog reasonable. Supporting president getting rid funding states' testing... much. Desantis - can't ways! “fine” mean “alive” correct. substantial number people “mild” cases suffering long term (and quite possibly permanent) health problems. healthy horse get really fucked thing. comparison, entire US less 2% test positive since start pandemic.

And many total dead now? Don’t worry, couple thousand kids die.

I don’t think Apple’s data wrong, think youre misusing it.

Florida’s economy heavily tourism based cratered, fact mobility dropped would expected. doesn’t measure mobility Floridians all.

Shit, tourists south drive Florida.

So plenty reason think skewed compare ways lockdowns sustained work.

If care misleading, quit spamming it. Employment protections found Europe would pretty good start. Seven months coronavirus pandemic country, Joint Task Force eminent public health experts Monday wrote Prime Minister Narendra Modi said must assumed effective vaccine novel coronavirus ""would available near future"". also said false sense hope panacea around corner must avoided.

In joint statement, experts Indian Public Health Association (IPHA), Indian Association Preventive Social Medicine (IAPSM), Indian Association Epidemiologists (IAE) said, ""Vaccines role current ongoing coronavirus pandemic control India. must assumed effective vaccine would available near future. must avoid false sense hope panacea around corner.""

The group's third joint statement hope coronavirus vaccine Covid-19 states, ""Vaccines proven efficacy safety, available, administered according WHO's 'strategic allocation' approach multi-tiered risk-based approach.""

From graded re-opening schools discontinuing lockdown strategy pandemic control measures suggested public health experts.

The statement also states now, ""lockdown strategy control discontinued.""

While health ministry ICMR never admitted community transmission novel coronavirus country, statement outlines ""cluster restrictions considered areas community transmission.""

The statement goes list action plans government must take point infection seeped urban cities also rural areas country. India witnessing rapid surge new cases, clocking tally 80,000 new cases Monday, highest world comes single-day cases USA Brazil.

No lockdown, short defined ""cluster"" restrictions duration imposed

Lockdown strategy control discontinued. Geographically limited restrictions short periods may imposed epidemiologically defined clusters. Cluster restrictions considered areas community transmission. Even cluster restrictions imposed weighing impact livelihood target population.

With adequate health system preparedness, including facility care severe cases, cluster restrictions totally done away ideal way address pandemic.

In large cities (Y class), already substantial spread (can assessed expert committee), advantage creating containment zones aggressive testing.

The focus prevent deaths coronavirus containing infection. IEC advise people watch symptoms early reporting testing demand contacting doctor proper advice.

In class cities moderate spread: Containment zones revamped clear roadmap timelines periodic review expert committee, aim test suspects, isolate infected individuals proper treatment. zones de-contained 14 days maximum.

Small cities rural townships mild/limited spread: Existing testing cluster containment strategy may continued. Although testing strategy mandatory isolation needs reviewed view social stigma. small cities, major factor preventing persons coming forward testing.

Rural areas: syndromic surveillance ASHA village Nigrani Samiti periodic review PHC level could done.

Role vaccines controlling ongoing outbreak: Vaccine role current ongoing pandemic control. However, whenever available, vaccine may play role providing personal protection high-risk individuals like HCWs elderly co-morbidities.

While optimistic prevention control strategy also prepare worst. must assume effective vaccine would available near future. must avoid false sense hope panacea around corner.

Opening schools educational institutions: time move towards normalcy. opening schools educational institutions could started graded manner. pragmatic approach, especially areas sufficient population already infected SARS CoV-2 (ss assessed expert committee).

Even low infection areas, schools may opened due safety measures (social distancing, alternate work days, etc.), adequate surveillance outbreaks acceleration due schools.

Quarantine Isolation Policy: community-friendly. present policies, houses persons test positive, stamped, isolated barricades, creating fear society. practice abandoned immediately.

When majority states/districts affected, rationale quarantine inter-state travellers required mandatory facility (hotel health facility) quarantine (for 14 days). stopped immediately. Citizen friendly measures like following home quarantine/isolation, effective strategy many cities/states followed.

Pragmatic testing control strategy: Universal scaling testing current community transmission stage pandemic may optimal control strategy divert attention resources control measures.

With availability sufficient understanding natural history disease at-risk population, testing used due diligence. Targeted testing high-risk individuals, healthcare workers, elderly co-morbidities, screening prior surgical procedure, etc. recommended.

However, areas early phase pandemic (where zero cases reported), testing may used surveillance tool.

For cities towns high caseload: 

(i) Consider symptomatic coronavirus cases treat home hospital depending clinical condition, Covid-19 even without testing (syndromic approach);

(ii) Monitor symptomatic patients (even without testing), phone, family members, paramedics, also SpO2 values (either supplying pulse oximeter individually making available local paramedics) early shifting hospitals reduce mortality;

(iii) reliable accountable dashboard central helpline requiring hospitalisation (in coordination ambulance services).

Towns/districts low caseload: Continue practice containment zones, identify case 
and contain area, conduct house-to-house survey, identify cases testing, isolate cases preferably facility avoid spread home quarantine possible strict instruction spread stopped.

Towns/districts caseload: Continue surveillance activity precautions; actively promote physical/social distancing, mask use, hand hygiene.

Immediate resumption comprehensive health care services: 

Primary, secondary, tertiary health care services, including outpatient inpatient services including routine/emergency surgeries, resume early feasible, least areas progressing towards higher levels immunity towns/districts coronavirus cases.

Adequate safety measures put place safety health care staff engaged optimal PPE testing patients coronavirus may appropriate.

Protecting high-risk populations including elderly co-morbidities: Elderly persons years) co-morbidities (hypertension, DM, Cancer, obesity, etc.) shall continue restrict outdoor activities far possible. Younger persons co-morbidities also exercise appropriate caution.

Continue preventive control measures physical distancing, face mask use, hand washing: continue practice distancing (avoiding mass gatherings), face mask usage, hand washing prevent limit transmission.

ILI SARI surveillance: Early detection ILI prompt management SARI cases using combination syndromic surveillance 'test track' strategy strengthened.

Which it? isn’t big question vitro vivo kills human cells too? existing cancer drug probably doesn’t downfall. go...

It's heavily age stratified ""old"" far biggest risk factor.

The recent data countries highlights this:

Spain IFR age (Death Rates)

80 = 7.2 % 70 79 = 3.4% 60 69 = 1% 50 59 = 0.3% 40 49 = 0.07% 30 39 = 0.03% 20 29 = 0.01% &lt;19 = 0%

England IFR age (Death Rates)

75 = 11.6% 65 74 = 3.1% 45 64 = 0.5% 15 44 = 0.03%

Switzerland (Geneva) IFR age (Death Rates)

65 = 5.6% 50 64 = 0.14% 20 49 = 0.01% &lt;19 = 0%

Another study Spain started April overall IFR population 0.8%, remained close zero people 50, rising swiftly 11.6% men 80 years old over; 4.6% women age group.

Globally speaking every 1,000 people infected coronavirus age 50, almost none die. people fifties early sixties, five die — men women. risk climbs steeply years accrue. every 1,000 people mid-seventies older infected, around 116 early years, missing months education socialization really hurt them. kids depressed let start playing kids. things still try careful. Definitely. sucks reasonable conservative person right extreme rights making everyone look fool.

Sucks leftist system screws everyone equally. Jesus fucking Christ. You’ve obviously never real problem life. People really ought get good reusable cloth masks instead flimsy disposable ones. I've company 10 years now. got offered choice polo shirt, water bottle, small fleece blanket company logo emblazoned item. thanks. Ah yes, ""Hey, \[teachers staff\] feel like adequate safety measures put place facilities facilitate us jobs mitigating risk us contracting and/or spreading deadly disease""...

Whining...  Well good luck. don’t envy situation all. effective measures become neglected 

Such as? ah, that’s one safe say people underlying issues worst time Covid idea needing vaccine well established. agree never zero risk anything. concerned though another wave may come. correct things winding initial wave took cover globe. But, one wave passes another one form. Sure, that's point though. know abstract efficacy is. know lots people would get vaccine even 10% effective. Well, well, well, isn’t totally predictable outcome may missed part decided emergency warranted abbreviated testing. may agree it, means that, no, tests never safe, standard safe.

Barcelona - 31 ago 2020 - 10:25 CEST

August yet already among experts healthcare managers general conviction ominous autumn awaits Spain, expect significant spike mortality related coronavirus. figures reach March April, allows optimists see glass half full, higher many forecasting long ago.

“Several weeks ago, cases began grow significantly,” explains Daniel López Codina, computational biology complex systems research group Polytechnic University Catalonia. “And happens, without effective treatment, rise mortality inevitable.”

Spain saw dozen Covid-19-related deaths week average July. curve even began fall first two weeks, according data Health Ministry, given majority people fallen ill first wave coronavirus spent months intensive care unit (ICU). trend changed August arrived, recent days weekly average risen 120 fatalities. figure is, reality, even higher given delays notifications regions central Health Ministry, likely numbers continue grow sustained basis.

First infections go up, 10 15 days later hospitalizations rise, toward third week, mortality rises

Francisco Javier Falo, general director public health Aragón

The data offered European Center Disease Prevention Control – based information sent Health Ministry – show mortality Spain doubled less two weeks, going 0.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants 0.8. information regions confirms trend.

“Mortality last thing rises,” explains Francisco Javier Falo, general director public health Aragón, region seen highest infection rates summer. “First infections go up, 10 15 days later hospitalizations rise, toward third week, mortality rises. It’s last thing goes up, later it’s difficult bring down, groups patients serious condition start accumulate hospitals often progress well.”

In Aragón, cases shot second half July. end month, deaths region 15 week, number multiplied five mid-August, reach 72. Since then, despite notable fall new infections, fatality rate dropping lot slower. last week number came 62.

In Madrid, new spike infections began three weeks ago, number fatalities rise. According totals offered group professionals region’s hospitals, number deaths August 21 nine; 25th 13; Friday rose 22.

Spain emerged lockdown virus still present two sectors: healthcare, areas continued operate throughout confinement period, agriculture sector

The situation different March, experts point out. Then, practically cases diagnosed patients serious condition. immense majority mild cases – asymptomatic cases – detected, something caused fatality rate shoot nearly 20%. Now, rate expected rise, currently relatively low. reason this? “The first infections mostly circles young healthy people, intense social life,” explains Daniel López Acuña, former director emergencies World Health Organization (WHO). “Although passing days, family professional lives, end transmitting virus elderly vulnerable people.”

The experts see origin problem Spain. country emerged lockdown virus still present two sectors: healthcare, areas continued operate throughout confinement period, agriculture sector. spite warnings, coronavirus still able jump areas young people first, spreading via nightlife family events, end reaching vulnerable.

The reasons explain situation, according sources consulted article, mix population dropping guard terms protection measures, inability regional governments strengthen services monitor epidemic, delays comes adopting measures 11 guidelines agreed Health Ministry regions two weeks ago, included closure nightlife venues protection senior residences, among others.

Once virus regained lost ground, it’s difficult make retreat. “The way significantly reduce mortality reduce infections, particular among vulnerable population,” insists Miguel Hernán, epidemiology professor Harvard University. “And way achieve early diagnosis, tracing contacts isolation measures.”

“Gradual flexible” measures

Jacobo Mendioroz, head virus-monitoring unit Catalan government, argues experience Catalonia – ended confining several areas, including Lleida – well Aragón show needed “act soon possible.” key, continues, “is infections still happening among younger people, strengthening tracing isolation, control measures. avoids transmission reaching vulnerable incidence reaching high levels. That’s becomes difficult bring down, particularly cities.”

These measures, Mendioroz explains, “gradual flexible, surgical,” pressure rising falling according epidemiological progress.

Miguel Hernán bemoans “clearly insufficient efforts many regions carried terms epidemiological monitoring. appears leaders believe explosion cases avoided use masks percentage population already infection, relative immunity several months years. don’t know someone done calculation, it’s justification could explain insufficient focus monitoring measures.”
- Hows eve relevant? Noone ever died effects actual HI Virus either.

Everyone dies aids, come kill thousand different ways. reason died still remains HIV infection regardless.

These nutcases grabbing every single straw find hold dear life. would put much effort protecting others...

But people infected randomly virus wild. people likely contact people likely get early, people least likely infected likely stay uninfected. Thus, pool uninfecteds becomes harder harder infect, driving herd immunity down. much down? Nobody knows certain, probably varies lot place place. 50% probably reasonably conservative guess.

AXE I'm single payer, American system fucked right switching single payer 4 years ala M4A would disaster. People like say American healthcare system like Frankenstein's monster. various chunks slapped on. However, actually Frankenstein's monster rodent infestation leeches. rodents leeches hospital executives major healthcare companies (think HCA, MedStar, Fresenius, etc...). remove first, get universally shitty healthcare.

Right we've got hospital CEOs draining money away patients healthcare workers taking huge bonuses, squeezing younger doctors increasingly can't find opportunities join/form private clinics chain hospital businesses buying up. Cost attendance American med schools $350k+ private schools $250k public schools (in state), that's *after* potentially going back masters ""boost resume."" Residents pushed human limits 80-100 hour work weeks, outright told lie time sheets prevent unlawful working conditions. People rural areas barely find clinic. enormous looming doctor shortage.

Before imposing sort burden M4A imposes hospitals (by slashing reimbursement rates 40% meet extra demand/services without raising costs), shake problems get worse. Older doctors retire (because fuck it, I'm working even *more* pay lower), creating even doctor shortage. Rural clinics can't compensate decreased reimbursements volume, either close operate limited basis (or get aid government, negating cost-saving measures M4A). CEOs seeing decreased revenue squeeze workers, lower pay, try suck much system retain lifestyle. Young doctors struggle pay medical school loans growing interest falling salaries (and likely longer training paths try pay less working more, already happening degree).

I'd offer different pathway gets help Americans faster, still gets us single payer. Basically Switzerland (+medicare/medicaid+public option) Germany Canada. basically federal mandate (+medicare/medicaid/public option) (Switzerland), move tax funded public option (Germany), move single payer (Canada). Somewhere along line, we'd need healthcare education reform training pipelines look lot like European ones physician density increases.

At step reduce profitability medicine, drive leeches, lower costs. get universal healthcare immediately system would much harder republicans fuck M4A (which could crippled something simple senators running promises lower taxes support M4A, would benefit healthy majority need high cost care). allow change public perception healthcare usher new era politician (e.g. vote current brand GOP, hopefully relic time boomers gone). much important general public sees vaccination. every fault side pharmaceutical industry, anti-vaxxer movement gain.

I’ve lost lot hope things going back normal anytime soon decided I’d rather roll dice hope either don’t get get mild/asymptomatic infection doesn’t cause significant long term damage.

It might rational decision, it’s decision I, friends family already made. still wear mask I’m public, generally try limit high risk activities, someone invites BBQ something, I’m going say unless it’s full Nazis something. Worse.

They think understand science. CDC tests contaminated didn’t follow basic lab protocols. wasn’t rushing, incompetent didn’t care. According NYTimes someone FDA inspection found astonishing lack expertise commercial manufacturing learned nobody charge entire process, ranged researchers entering exiting coronavirus laboratories without changing coats, test ingredients assembled room researchers working positive coronavirus samples, officials said. practices made tests sent public health labs unusable contaminated coronavirus, produced inconclusive Yeah get it. Still though, students young, live young people. all, majority. Finally US got promised wall. 
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes Classic—you don’t good argument call people stupid. 

I worked admin medical industry decade. familiar death certs prepared.

You suggesting someone manually fills out, element human error play. entire data set isn’t necessarily 100% accurate. That’s true, human error impacts literally everything world. 

However, LOT data here. choosing eschew verifiable, testable data, simply think *some* data might incomplete. 

If you’re going ignore everything report think *mayyybeeee* isn’t complete operating facts am. 

And point admin might left comorbidity pre-existing condition? report shows 94% certs actually include things. 

But it’s obvious real interest understanding works. really, label death supposed co-morbidity have. I.E. Respiratory failure, Heart Failure, Stroke, etc... Well yeah deniers take small looking Data claim proof Virus killed Americans WW1. understand point view, also helps sensationalist side showing large number. shit, it’s part personal PROTECTIVE equipment healthcare workers. narrative day 1 weren’t able make vaccine key point. Although point efforts would lower absolutely valid, obviously it’s rather high importance point Covid-19.

Right, that's key difference. Everybody says ""There's vaccine SARS MERS"" ignore specific reason one (namely lack funding actually infected individuals), two things factors pandemic separates rest Why? I'll send fully armed pandemic remind love!  Yes, unfiltered recirculating ventilation causing spread indoors. kinda basic remarkably bad idea.

You would loved 19th century.  shortage snake oil. Faculty staff always young live campus. students also close live home older.parents maybe even grandpa grandma house. students live dorm college apartment others age. students young either. answer single thing asked. You.. suggested vulnerable stay locked down. asked work, start going another direction, avoiding question together. Make always negative coverage FL. first excess death article found studied death rates 2017, compared 2020, adjust population growth claimed deaths COVID. 9/10 there's bad news like someone raging Costco masks, random news article simply adds #,### number ToTaL CaSeS say badly FL doing.

FL failings, get wrong thought approach DeSantis appropriate. 5 biggest counties locked early intense scrutiny lock places single-digit cases rest state follow suit. traveled Henderson County FL annual guys trip April &lt;10 cases total 2 months pandemic. Lockdowns needed place like people still losing goddamned minds. mods would never delete fear porn like this. can't shake feeling desperate believe exchange us something actually is: expose brittleness inability process parody. traits folks invested certain political systems.

I set boasted after. want people know I've doing. There's ""being caught red-handed"" here. amazing consistently people promote certain political systems can't understand they're mocked why. 

Do really believe I'm karma? think dedicated troll would stuff like use multiple accounts? C'mon think through! 

What, exactly, see contribution as? certainly educating people COVID-19. seems glorification particular political system. appropriate subs kind thing. saying. r/titlegore And, child could completely asymptomatic parents child idea positive. So, that's another reason inclassroom instruction stupid right now, period.  People don’t understand basic science. money, eh?

Also, know CLA is? disagree think people good. However, say 10% good like propose appear like majority too. Ironic listening, refuse read, yet claim others aren't. can't helped. stupid. hilariously bad assessment guy medical scientist clue boarding flight positivity rate location. 1 7700 much much better lottery odds. thank you. anywhere near safe. article another example ""Covid Convenience Syndrome."" want justify flying, make something ignores reality feel good risking life. total bullshit. one bit. That's long plan. pre-buy. one theory hook worms responsible South’s reputation slow, stupid, lazy. saying hindsight mistakes made explained, mistakes happen now? rapid test family get two weeks old test Data dropping kid school? “So said masks important public need wear mask interview.”

And reason that, stated INTERVIEW, wouldn’t run healthcare workers. Try harder!!

You stated, “and quote...” wasn’t quote him. never said you’re walking back. you’re going quote someone, say it’s quote, it’s meant taken literally. in, people expect person actually said it. Journalists sued misquoting someone.

Great mental gymnastics. I’m still waiting lies! no.

But decide that, Trump keep fucking try get work done, I'm sure could blame them. build wall keep out. There's reason they're leaving countries. want bringing drugs / rapists / war America? Hospitals least recent past worked hard keeping death rate number low. Sometimes old news becomes new news fits agenda. bruh nobody part ever, that’s US poorly rest world resuming carefully And???? And? leaked email university president sent every department chair:

“""Hi All,

I hope good weekend. morning, CLA's credit hours 7.6% last year first day classes. crisis situation - financial job losses would stem big decline would large.

 

Students seem gravitating online in-person courses, going modestly increase seat student capacity online sections. point, step take might significantly reduce losses fall.

 

This ideal surely grumbling instructors, everyone college harmed declining credit hours revenue. appreciate helping us effort.

 

Best

 Richard Deeg, PhD"" Yes, half states. Alaska California amount people... see. Since people go work lockdown? Basically, never lockdown. far virus concerned, ""You pay pay later, pay."" Earth already controller! Humans delusional thinking they're helm. understand - nothing changed regards safe release vaccine 9 months. Literally nothing.

Have following tests?

He might saying ""end year"" response promising results looked like would, fact, produce good, safe, tested results end year. results suddenly went tits up, sets timeline back.

I'm saying happen, say ""literally nothing changed"" stupid. We've spent time learning virus. changed know vaccine need work. Appreciate civil response: 

I found scholarly article saying it’s reappeared 4 times since epidemic. it’s still around?

Although think likely confused MERS Korean instance remember - good call.

They weren’t able make vaccine key point. Although point efforts would lower absolutely valid, obviously it’s rather high importance point Covid-19. u didn’t start running/jogging/power walking every day starting March prepare lungs disease. death imo. made entire family cardio second heard thing. (9 us ages 4-63) already got we’re fine better shape ever. Altitude? Oh no, get that. understand THAT'S always first thing jump you're. think it’s stupid idea, point states attempt make move like measure outcome really right approach this.  situation worsens, lock shit back down.  Slow keyboard warrior projection inferiority complex, never suggested jobless frustrated narcissistic pseudo-intellectual argumentative fuck.

Gonna guess English first resort nasty adhominems. obviously make money, well pre-taxes least, glory welfare state.

Not ad-hominem, defensiveness response *your* personal Again, arguments literally policy, now.

No next crisis, try first explain happening

For next crisis, listen public health experts people start dropping like ride high horse hindsight lies (e.g. Chinese reporting policy).

I started getting ready quarantines late January. They're little incubators. Lol. You’re pointing issues based locking % elderly vulnerable (many already facilities) meanwhile reasonable alternative locking *entire population?* 😂 

🍿 Please, tell more. *I* questions...

How much longer continue locking everything without sort massive backlash?

Gavin Newsom California new rules say business must limit capacity based *single* case. means ONE asymptomatic case (not death,not hospitalization, case) nursing home Long Beach would keep Los Angeles lockdown. *that* sound realistic you? 😆 

Why ok deaths previously, must make massive sacrifices help folks already end rope cough years? 

Say COVID eradicated flu comes around year governor proposes lockdown prevent deaths, feel? It’s bad flu, fact seems milder previous years. However, flu spreads elderly small number lives could saved. in? different types government positives negatives. People associate communism Russia. gets negative reflex people. actually start looking definitions different styles. see yourself. 

Also, get downvotes time care anymore. First get students back campus campus housing. act surprised there's outbreak COVID cases. move classes online refuse give housing refunds. 

Result? Profit. deaths... Legitimately, one well educated engineer coworkers things bill gates conspiracy get us use computers. time alive. sarcastic, hope. like-minded much said (basically aside fact religious, doesn’t change agree known fact replaced purely fitting neatly parameters someone’s chosen faith). don’t think faith &amp; science conflict. love perspective, love way even-keeled regard way look situation quite explosive (pun). Governor: 'We never lockdowns again'

Then get everyone wear masks, idiots! everyone saw ""flatten curve"" BS fear-monger articles permanent lockdown starting come out. reports *multiple* positive students elementary schools? Given literal hundred-sized outbreaks multiple college campuses now, either lots large outbreaks elementary schools now, growing confidence younger children superspreaders? Everything see elementary schools is... 1 kid here. 1 kid there. staff here... many option. us still work meatspace. options reduce risk often involve outsourcing others. people likely suck, think people incredibly frustrated certain nations' decisions lack disease control. 

But yea, I'm exactly avidly excited see America surpass Sweden per capita deaths (and course, probable already have) think came isolation hotels. allowed unmasked security escort people outside exercise. sure agree, though I'm pro-college education reform. (I think pay college taxes, *after* fact, actually attend place burden trades encourage education bloat industries necessary).

Healthcare education reform could implemented massive expansion 2+4 3+4 programs, students graduate med school 24 25 respectively. We'd also want expand spots subsidize education (in way described above. Government pays, pay taxes later, actually made money).

The two necessarily tied hips. cancer Canadian. Haven’t paid dime surgery, ultrasound, countless blood tests, CT Scans, x-rays since. Thankfully needed surgery chemo, don’t care people say, there’s way increased taxes pay come close would cost US. Water also wet But... Water wet, it? forget. LoL Okay, takes us back beginning then.

What said would assume deaths associated respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, ARDS... acute conditions basically *that reason* listed comorbid conditions CDC, result COVID.

That would quite coincidence, since ""conditions"" actually comprise large chunk ""comorbidities"".

Regardless CDC categorizes conditions, CDC's mouth, appears pre-existing conditions, factor patient's death, actual cause. per article I've referenced earlier, CDC stated 92% deaths comorbidities, COVID determined underlying cause death. argue article ""inaccurate"" story another time. People need taught think like that. pandemic. symptom suspect ruled out. That's common sense given stake. Nothing dismissed. fall power money? 50% tested positive antibodies. actual percentage contracting virus almost certainly higher, research indicating antibodies fade quickly (commonly undetectable 3 months). 

As explained before, 20-30% would achieve herd immunity, would unlikely population could even achieve 50% antibody prevalence. 

What exactly difference contact transmission HIT one person contracting Covid-19 another small enclosed place like public bathroom? Surely contact transmission HIT imply kissing licking other? Especially US anti vaxxer third biggest religion It’s people end hospitalized covid organ damage. mild case still end it. 39k tests previous post responded to. 15k people first time testers. That's Sunday, facitilities closed. Normal volume gets 70k+ 

From new cases today's report. 1,876 residents 9 non-residents. 11.8% positive **15,921 tests new residents individuals.** 90% positive 10 tests new non-residents individuals. 11.83% positive 15,931 tests new individuals. 5.52% **34,694 tests** according DoH. Full positivity rate 8.03% 39,507 testings. FDA willing allow vaccine produced trials completed.

Of course going produce vaccine trials completed. would waste months time could use actually manufacturing vaccine? decide later, looking data, keeper garbage. Yet find evidence currently people wanting tested can't? Maybe testing many showing up?

Positivity rate falling, hospitalisations falling, deaths falling. 

Literally every metric falling. Show data that's worsening FL change mind. us don’t see point living fear things can’t control evaluated risks/benefits resuming normal life.

This 100% something control though. choose risk spreading virus going necessities wearing mask. everyone done needed start, would virus control enough would genuinely able get back normal without risk. we’re still living virus many people “didn’t want live fear”. stay adult steps actually tries fight pandemic USA. So, earliest closed somewhere around late February/early March. Unless vaccine becomes widely available then.  bet! Easier said done. Ah yes, aren’t concerned human life, want right /s

Is really think? Really? speaks volumes capacity empathy. probably believe Q anon think masks hurt freedoms.

The doomers concerned human life. shrieking rooftops desperate attempt get others change behavior protect themselves. blindly optimistic attitude deadly.  trash, pure simple. “We know can’t stop virus”. literal fuck talking about? Everyone chronic illness always accused hypochondriac. It’s fucking insulting Oh snap, that's hometown. student teacher elementary school high school.

That's they're news for? *facepalm* List various topics covered series podcasts.

Did listen any. Flat earthers require evidence believe earth flat, safest vaccine history immune conspiracy theories speculation. never vaccine safe enough satisfy anti-vaxxer crowd. people think Bill Gates hiding microchips vaccines, 5G signals caused COVID. think evidence necessary?

Any COVID vaccine presented along acceptable timeline come inherent risks. Vaccines come inherent risks. sit quietly wait absolute certainty absolute safety 100% treated, potentially waiting decades, causing incalculable harm twiddle thumbs waiting satisfy portion population functionally unsatisfiable.

The 1976 Swine Flu vaccine, considered ""a fiasco"" helped birth modern anti-vaxxer movement, caused problems 1 100,000 people. COVID currently causing DEATH least 1 200. people prepared accept small level risk order change course pandemic, either fail understand scope problem mistakenly believe they're safer rolling dice virus. 

I appreciate saying obviously one rushing sloppy work, choose faith scientific institutions that's basically ""belief science"" amounts to. We're trusting people know they're jobs. can't abide notion need take extra steps make sure idiots believe conspiracy theories, going they're going regardless good faith attempts convince otherwise. Strangely wouldnt even counted. statistics.

I came this, got high fever, couldnt speak., felt awful. dizzy -etc. Phoned GP. nearest testing point 10 miles away. Dr said (who weeks earlier) - quarantine yourself. Inability talk worst

Couldnt get official test, couldnt risk asking taxi driver friend take hospital 10 miles away.

By time got pneumonia - past detectable time virus.

So never actually got confirmed COVID test. Dr said it, Dr pneumonia told it. couldnt get proper test May. ones (had 3) June proved negative - lives system couple weeks. double lies, go people speak personally. combined effect people become afraid speak liars win. Waiting get bachelors degree secure job oversees finally get healthcare pain knee I've year now... belly-laugh emoji? appease union. 2 weeks they'll start complaining still safe need time popular goof Florida tried create ranking based risk factors using population density median age ranking making Florida 4th risky covid state. ranked states covid deaths per 100k calculated difference expected ranking actual ranking calculate performance. Florida came tied Kentucky North Carolina 10th + 12 (expected rank 4th worse state, came 16th worse.

Top 10 Hawaii, Vermont, WV, Maine, Wisconsin, NH, Oregon, Montana, Ohio. distinct advantage geographic isolation.

The worst state Mississippi, expected rank 37th, came 7th, followed Arizona, Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska.

So, riding Florida 'mistakes', cut out. pretty good job considering risk factors even account tourism. 

You may hate governor political leanings fact state fared better most.

We reported cases! - nope, state state excess deaths Florida last six months would show whack country - not. ...unless dumping covid bodies swamp gators eating them. welcome come test covid. 1 19 seems low. Shit, remember 9/11 within 3 degrees several people died day. know multiple people dead Covid, including grandfather, seems like people know knows someone. fallacy that's killing people. can't contain campus. Stop saying suggesting dangerous things  Well then, HIT different ""herd immunity"" discussed general terms, made clear. relationship HIT ""herd immunity"" commonly discussed must made clear. 

The article linked show antibodies fade, shows immunity continues. apparently true. antibodies fade, antibody tests good indicator recovered Covid-19 extended period time. New Zealand learned lesson hard way. like dying gunshot wound cause death listed blood loss... Thanks. thank you. Must alot people like me. Rural areas, miles testing centre. 

Seriously, ill, testing isnt highest priority. benefit test result information.. isolate. Priority stay well.

'it is' Nothing going change 2 weeks. They'll start whining date nears. question stubborn / ignorant people: high blood pressure you’re walking around fine catch Covid die, die from? What's thailand then? auto mod removed post p oli tics probably auto detecting certain words I’ll mix em some. didn’t put check mark red 2016. 

I pointing listen one corrupt gathering vs corrupt gathering pretty much pointless.  running phase 3 countries months ago. Perhaps need additional data. Lol robot Caucasian woman? willing take vaccine properly tested gone rigorous trials vaccines often undergo.

The problem situation requires vaccine ASAP there's much talk ""fast-tracking"" vaccines without undergoing critical steps necessary test safety efficacy. Sadly, true. also true commenter said. US, far gone, lot regions. thing try contain virus much possible health system overload. Right, worrying often put forward discussions media. astonishing studies trying shed light issue. I'll take whenever enough science behind trusted governing bodies approved it. 

I take something trump forces FDA give emergency use authorization election without completion phase 3 testing.

So leave poll? mean regional shutdown within states appropriate ridiculous people sending kids school IMO. evidence points massive superspreader disease, mid-pandemic going flu season. truly stupidest thing allow happen entire pandemic minimizing numbers posted. increases dramatic. emphasize that, consider another metric, CDC, denotes 'increased risk' via percentage. -         Risk Hospitalization - Risk Death

0-4 years	    4x lower	          9x lower

5-17 years	    9x lower	 16x lower

18-29 years	CG	     CG

30-39 years	2x higher	4x higher

40-49 years	3x higher	10x higher

50-64 years	4x higher	30x higher

65-74 years	5x higher	90x higher

75-84 years	8x higher	220x higher

85+ years	    13x higher	630x higher

Once leave 18-29 year age group, risk death goes 4x's. aka 400%. That's dramatic. 

Lastly, I'd love see source 89% figure. Simply I'm sure claim pre-existing conditions necessarily factor hospitalization. high cholesterol mean hospitalized covid infection hinged cholesterol levels impact recovery anyway. sent police military large percentage people work informal places paid leave. small shop sell things streets informal markets. military police got scared getting infected ans stopped drastic turned blind eye ensuring quarantine went on. study isn’t new, it’s weeks old. Also, like many mask studies, doesn’t account masks work day-to-day life. doesn’t account people touching masks constantly, people wearing wrong masks, people wearing incorrectly, people social distancing wearing mask. Denmark completed study mask usage practical public life, results haven’t published yet. study conclusive. possible, shouldn’t rely simulations weak studies. F people downvoting speaking obvious truth? 

We know future. year ago, nobody could've predicted global failure. know coronavirus rapidly spread come winter. 


A wise government knows knows doesn't. hand, 67% get it, relatively effective, able move past pretty quickly. **official** statement herd immunity plan e-mails obvious herd immunity plan. noticed anything (before summer) indicating herd immunity plan? rules aimed suppress disease mitigate it?

&amp;#x200B;

You may also consider 2020 flu season mild winter vomiting disease stopped almost instantly people started socially distancing. think 2019 good comparision trajectory deaths going Covid came.

(And yes know statistics. read University 30 years ago even though forgotten now. much statistics though common sense).

And see SCB published new statistics added 6 deaths period March-June 2020 6481 deaths year last. Flight crew possible, I'm less inclined believe someone snuck without noticed simply tested. I'm unsure Ofxord's not, states ""in US"". believe several phase three studies countries already started. virus can't stopped reason can't contained. basic logic escape people????? mean complain short time is, I’ll tell right Canada Australia similar time allowance, I’m sure UK, I’m assuming it’s similar? 

Sure europeans get time off, Europe broke, except Germany northern countries.

Also let’s compare time Asian countries tell 2 weeks short 40 hours week much. Last saw March/April/May people modify movements. Sure never 100% compliance anything *most* places people part help flatten curve. Waiting social isolation “until vaccine” though never part plan realistic. 

For record wear mask indoors places it’s required never complained keep distance strangers. live people good wearing masks indoors. outside don’t know single person still “quarantining” 6+ months later. really depends vaccine came from. would definitely take one thought well tested safe. Something fully tested rushed would need lot thought would risk taking. Imagine applying ""covid hoax"" logical fallacies context. people actively trying minimize disaster 200,000 dead.. awful people know risks quietly comply reasonable health orders.

the deniers loud. Canada need immigration tourism so...no. Ducey let us down. Pretending virus pretending massive underground cult conspiracy farm adrenochrome children Q Anon bullshit. Kinda surprised wear pin dog whistle. sure sarcasm... Idk ur making numbers. best guess 60% herd immunity. It’d substantially less 2 mil. even 2 mil, would good number environment economy. may right. it’s contained within low-risk population it’s end world (yet). 180k dead..

*we're doin fine* I’m even mad parents. often work options childcare paid sick leave get fired taking off. 

I’m thankful husband professional jobs take kids sick. know others aren’t fortunate. Could stay permanently Canada realizes need immigration tourism? read Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine (the promising one) phase 3 testing 730 days starting Aug 18.

:( p.m. like chemist? said.... 

Im sure economy Minister guy would listening to. prefer English version - ""FUCKING MORONS!"" - pretty cool South Korea special term. concern that, considering controversial immigration mass tourism already, countries decide make border controls permanent economic benefits international tourism immigration offset social division risk foreign plague eating 10% gdp. respiratory conditions may increase person's risk common, diverse often undiagnosed become severe. Thats weird way spell Theft. anything like here. local healthcare company offering asymptomatic tests 24 hour turn around time, know anyone getting them. wearing masks. still won’t stop virus, slow infection rate, certainly wearing masks. Nahh, look paragraphs gold ^ *Wayy* much effort trolling.

I’m sorry found questions pointing holes “lockdown everyone” strategy trollish. think might need thicker skin want hang here. entire testing process shit-show. I'm happy people beginning realize true. need wait trend start!

Back 90s, mom’s cousin moved Tampa. early 2000s, different cousin’s daughter (family four) moved St Pete. parents retired (LIRR NYC DOE Secretary), moved closer grandkids. mom retired 2017 starting grad school moved followed ex-husband son. 2015, best friend moved NYC LA, getting lonely moved boyfriend 2018. Last year mom’s sister sister “different cousin’s daughter) also moved here. 

I also family east coast Florida Orlando. 

Basically, decent support system fellow ex-New Yorkers, it’s kind nice. rushed. testing needs completed first. Absolutely. Makes sense people hopeful. I’m still convinced it’s going happen within year would safe. that’s entirely different topic. appreciate responses today. Yep. I’ll moving North Korea December. Glad finally get away dumb dumb Trump. think overblown/a hoax think they're spreading germs. There's probably bunch herd immunity bandwagon think worse flu governments let run course (the overwhelmed ICUs never seem fit equation here).  
 
Terrifyingly, people vote. Sometimes think greatest failing humans never know much hurt people love. 

In experience, able mask deaths, always something deeper motivates them. Often fear anxiety world around changing honest world changed massively past 6 months. remember first put mask buy groceries bleak felt.

""Facts"" rarely issue, bigger barrier getting see experiences valid real. best way I've found listen compassionately, extract fear anxiety acknowledge it, try draw upon experience relate currently happening. exactly easy task... far gone? Everywhere implements masks sees significant drop cases shortly after. would certainly difficult control now, impossible. 

It's difficult beginning, unwilling control it. life belong us “by choice”. Nah, JFK shot, head *did that*. Exploding head syndrome, look up. manage infection keeping low possible. 6.5%is that. Take advice think critically once! Stop useful idiot! think wrong. Though think might reading bit much.

The cells body forms vaccine help long-term memory this, body quickly produce antibodies it, confronted wild.

Combine fact people tend transmissible **when they're asymptomatic** - precisely **because antibody counts low** stage relative viral counts - come conclusion impact transmissibility, raise antibody counts much earlier.

How much earlier? depends person.

To knowledge, think vaccine done hoping better. Though believe one vaccines manufactured close Oxford's, effect. virus purposely spread?? also “smart enough” shut criticism bumbled response tightening control social media arresting journalists doctors. perfect government response put government critics concentration camps. get Phase 1 trial vaccine two weeks.  hope grow third eye something. Good luck, man. Take book, it’s lot waiting around. cannot stop virus. must manage infection - can’t stop it. You’re fear-mongering stating without evidence kids certainly go infect elderly grandparents. That’s certainty. Oh goodness. vaccine works people get vaccine. appreciate conversation clarifications civil manner again. fucked up, still fixed it. Yeah. one heard like two months ""doctors getting paid report non-covid deaths covid deaths.""

The conspiracy started medicare increased reimbursement covid patients $1,300. 

And I'm like, wait minute, actually believe thousands doctors across country willing break oath harm file false death certificate $1,300 employer keeps???? 

And articles people would forward me, even read them, articles explain $1,300 far windfall hospitals.... hospitals still losing money this. United Federation Teachers union said safety concerns needed addressed prepared go court strike, even though New York state bars teachers public employees striking.  briefing city's response pandemic, de Blasio said official start date in-school instruction Sept. 21. hell? MLB cardboard cutouts. worth risk fans there. Hell, even playing worth it. trying optimistic without realism. kids going infect parents grands. good thing. Stop spreading disinformation ""One third Americans make almost 34% population!"" :( Nice goal post movement. spike started among groups older people (fundie churches, ultra conservative older groups,), they're harder time age. Strangely, often ""one third"". amount proof matter. Sociopathic traits linked refusal comply mask orders.  Still number one innovation saying agree .. need downvote me. People sub talk shit sub time. We've washing hands wearing masks here. I'm sure bunch gen-z assholes, majority people screeching masks refusing wash older. genuinely love this. true though. I'll never understand people complain wearing mask supermarket 20 minutes, versus alternative ventilator! Whatever. me! thing doubt stories fact could actually get price services US. I've tried small procedures found less impossible even find something cost. Whatever. People take vaccine not.

I’m taking it, burning mask, throwing part, saying hell don’t. homes want. Oh goodness... can't wait university close door weeks. That’s absolutely correct - people going infected this, want “most people” low-risk groups - like college kids. also need good testing isolation procedures place don’t go infect parents grandparents. Hopefully place since hearing infection rates college - hopefully tracing isolation.

College actually good petri dish herd immunity - lot college kids live away home. Hopefully limit infections older family members way. Oxford vaccine supposed ready September?

It's September 1, starting US phase 3 trials? requires multiple doses, weeks apart?

Maybe ready September afterall? Thats saddest part ""its real"" crowd

If fake, ""dem hoax"", etc

Why can't visit White House right now, everyone White House get tested much? School policies reward ""perfect attendance"" certificates parading across stage end year, draconian consequences missing days help. Asking real questions Everything go back normal pandemic over. Look black plague... Dom Cummings written it. *Besides Openshaw, many others got arms H.R. 6666, contact-tracing bill. worried bill number close sign Satan.* Translated article:

Forecast German Federal Government - Economic collapse due Corona lower expected

The recession triggered pandemic severe one financial crisis, predicts Federal Economics Minister Altmaier. economy grow strongly next year.

According Federal Government, economic slump caused corona crisis severe assumed spring. According SPIEGEL information, Federal Minister Economics Peter Altmaier (CDU) expecting minus 5.8 percent year. April, still assuming economy would shrink 6.3 percent 2020. economic slump therefore slightly severe financial crisis 2009, gross domestic product (GDP) fell 5.7 percent.

Economic experts Federal Government slightly less optimistic coming year spring. 2021 predict growth 4.4 percent. well 5.2 percent predicted latest estimate.

&amp;#x200B;

Recovery form V

Even losses growth yet completely made next year, economy showing signs recovery, experts describe V shape. sharp slump followed almost equally steep rise GDP.

Economics Minister Altmaier present figures today. basis internal tax estimate Federal Government, take place next week.

Smithfield quite famous publicly lying outcome coronavirus cases, sued multiple localities stop investigation reporting Coronavirus cases. Smithfield deaths, 0, JBS others, really highlight fact speaking anecdotes. 

I would also like see citation plant talking about, specifically, showing 300 workers recovered. really sure mean. sure accounts referring look history see obtuse. 

The FDA basically useless now. rush vaccine approval ZERO to.do public health everything getting headlines election purposes. 

If idiots want Guinea pigs unproven unknown drugs, go right ahead. Making mandatory, fuck that. people ""die Covid"" like obviously die car.

[What covid .. [what Covid  neither good bad news us.

**The Swedish Public Health Agency produced new guide support regions work detect ongoing covid-19 infection children young people.**

The Swedish Public Health Agency produced new guide support regions work detect ongoing covid-19 infection children young people. Swedish Public Health Agency recommends children preschool class, grades 1-9 high school age tested symptoms may indicate covid-19. way, children return school quickly negative test result general condition otherwise allows it.

Children adolescents usually symptoms adults covid-19, usually become mildly ill. scope testing children young people varies different regions. aim guidance sampling testing ongoing covid-19 children young people takes place similar way regions.

Deaths hard compare differences age &amp; health country's population, we've let virus get much widespread countries have. I've never life visited racist province life, I'm surprised!  beach outdoors, probably safer urgent care. true though. leave 18-24 age group, risk hospitalization death goes dramatically regardless pre-existing conditions.

I dont know would agree words ..

*""What chances needing hospitalization dying get Covid, [according - 19yrs old = 0.1% hospital, near 0% death. 
20 - 29 = 1% hospital, near 0% death 
30 - 39 = 3.4% hospital, 0.1% death 
40 - 49 = 4.3% hospital, 0.2% death 
50 - 59 = 8.2% hospital, 0.6% death 
60 - 69 = 11.8% hospital, 1.8% death 
70 - 79 = 16% hospital, 4.3% death 
80 - 89 = 18.4% hospital, 7.8% death 

89% people require hospitalization Covid underlying conditions. prob not.

MAGA Curious, bipartisan committee democrat committee? fear combination bad administration, “available” medicine, mass incarceration. right worried require something like use populations know risk free say no? Please make worried this. live time phones longer used phones. 100% get vaccine eventually. 100% one first line. feels *way* rushed Oh my. trust picture Chinese people partying, look supply chain recovery: economy back track, US shambles. young kids playing basketball? It’s even football season yet Interesting, plan universal income China?

I've heard temporary consumption subsidies government support poorest villages. 

But Chinese government seems reluctant create permanent full social security universal income. 
It uses lot money could invested infrastructure example. 
Also granted, becomes almost impossible take away.

Do remember heard this?

It would really help unemployment. seems automation really gaining steam China AI used sectors economy. everyone living?

5G robotics create unemployment, think. dangerous work remotely? applications save lot labour? “Lockdown skeptic” aka Mah Rightz good contact tracing people sensible, that's back control fast. Colombia, too. 'exploded' later South American countries, close 400 official deaths per million inhabitants nearly 20,000 dead, currently around 8,000-10,000 cases around 300 deaths per day. info excess deaths let's face reality: everyone ""died Covid"" actually died old age. Yeah tbf hadn’t community transmission months. Would’ve thought influenza. It’s still mystery even got wouldn’t say obvious could’ve easily dismissed given circumstances Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 30 days annual leave, 12 public holidays 6 months full pay sick leave necessary. UK here.

Everything hard unionisation. worst actual death rates world would be:

Peru - 60,000 excess deaths population 33 million - **1,818 deaths per million inhabitants**

Ecuador - 28,000 excess deaths population 17.7 million - **1,581 deaths per million inhabitants**

Bolivia - 16,000 excess deaths population 11.7 million - **1,367 deaths per million inhabitants**

The scary thing is, countries fairly young populations. Median age 28 Peru, 27.7 Ecuador, 24.3 Bolivia. Makes think death rate would countries older populations like USA Europe, virus able spread unchecked. US also get put waiting lists, doctors see unless specific managed care plans service. bullshit waiting game unless oodles cash hand. Would like go are, I've heard 5 different staff members building alone masks (but wear them) first week back.
One vulnerable virus. would need emergency tracheotomy*? That's obstructions absolutely need get around right now. America: Best world, 6 million times. half-assed lockdown better lockdown get? People's irrational behavior? Like lockdown protesters? China committing genocide minority populace opposing religion ideas majority, like Nazi's. using Nazi fucking playbook commit genocide. see that? never US. Alcoholics best defences lol Actually, global warming plan work. Reduce number people generating greenhouse gases, problem solved. hell, one appointment autoimmune disease takes 4months. god damn.... 15USD consultation 2 USD enough meds next appointment (4months worth meds). leave hospital bill cost 17USD. night hospital, X-rays, blood tests, nasal checks, heart checking thingy dont even know was. cost 30USD. rather wait thank you.  European dogs measure 10 hoot. write bark, bork. makes dream, forgets current mistake real time updates simulation maximum accuracy 

Thanks brain affected areas Perú north, even winter 86 °F temperatures daily. wish saying true, definitely case country. Grow up. Sorry believe OOPM numbers. people racking $100,000s simple procedures insurance?

I've got ""good"" insurance company even still shell $1000s per year. country blows. hope really stressing advertising people stay home feel sick least. cluster started family obvious symptoms walked around anyway. perfect? course not, probably worse sending back school. 

What actual fuck? Reminder: Spain instituted pretty hardcore lockdowns March (military included) try stem rise cases. Despite that, cases STILL comes back. Whoops. 

More proof lockdowns necessarily work viruses could come right back. Whereas, places take hit month seem eventually decline cases naturally. Go figures. dumbified fuck Americans finally realize ""politicians"" blame managing pandemic.

Lock 'm fuck sake, become ~~idiots~~ dead people deserve. Checking Canada. Although people pretty well behaved, there's absolute idiots kinds conspiracy theories. 

But-atleast people wearing masks (even though think dumb economy comes ahead people's lives) China still 100k cases per day months strict quarantine , lock-down, contact-tracing universal mask-wearing, US must million cases per day since that. unfortunate Alberta consistently seems trying like US every way :/ Perfectly? “THIS BEST GAME EVER!!” Florida going 100% speedrun 2020. realise bad part holocaust use trains right? uniforms let's abolish postmen Must R party governor. Yup. companies states require least 3 years tenure get 2 weeks PTO. Even then, goes 3 days per year company. Oh let's even get started hours work compared rest world...

edit: also, hardly rolls over. company, 3 days PTO roll over; sick time roll over. well stated. articulated issues clearly succinctly offered balanced view situation press conference Monday, Anand said government also final stages negotiations drug firm AstraZeneca, working Oxford University promising non-replicating viral vector vaccine.” massively projecting bud. Apparently westerners think something Chinese yet making whatever want believe fits narrative better. 

Clearly even read comment responding either. mentioned genocide many countries guilty of, fact, that's precisely field study. 

You clearly even know anything angry guy counter productive prejudice. Nothing special reddit anymore something I'm gonna deal with. I've said part obviously one reflect. It’s locker room propaganda, amirite??? /s. mean it’s nice verified us guess? Patients complain insurances 24/7, 365 days year. good reason too. first words mouth always - ""the insurance companies business help you, help themselves."" got us first half, gonna lie  pandemic proven experts stupid smarter are. Anyone grain common sense knows 1. Masks good always been. 2. CANNOT around unmasked people static environment matter distance. space enclosed, eventually breathing exhale. need doctorate's degree multi-million dollar four year study tell sun burn stay long. really fed folks whole ""we want alarm anyone"" excuses lying distorting established science. links this?

I'm bit skeptical open-minded possibility wrong. might well stop tracking China. nothing lies coming there. hygiene issues along population density makes impossible double digit cases per day. bet true number would around 100-150k per day tested everyone. Sounds like good time quit job. Politics make sure Corona become perfect disaster.

All available scientific evidence ignored since first reports came China. changed? Yep. pretty much fucked economy ruined young people lives years come. protect old, support lockdowns, homejails masks ""granma killer"". 


So exactly saved grandparents well. Yet, last month lost grandpa grandma. died peacefully heart failure finally freed 6months suffering mindless state multiple strokes. covid involved huge success totally worth it, yes? another legend falls. I'm fortunetelling US go stupid virus rollercoaster again. deeply worried. n hopeless. FDA approved COVID vaccine going near family Europe approved well. 

That's fantastic stance have. 

I really rooting Oxford vaccine relatively safe. hope works gets approved Europe continent/countries (e.g. India, Brazil, etc).

It's one candidates intention end pandemic save human lives instead corporation wanting make profit.  know one person renounced US citizenship escape real country years back could predicted this? Long service leave, hold back day people would hop ship get visit family back England decade. still long stay company 10 years. Bunch idiots. wait see results Korean Starbucks one woman infected 56 unmasked customers. could listened science, seems people charge really care understand science. did, would realize virus going politely wait Sept 14, policy takes effect, infect many unmasked people can.  Sure They're mostly psychopaths, that's Well it’s uncomfortable sometimes you’re basically thinking responsible adult re: safety. pandemic bringing kinds uncomfortable social situations. right thing, anyway - maybe make think keeping masks face people otherwise would’ve uncomfortable didn’t ask to. don’t sound like brightest crayons though..

I keep saying forcing come shell I’ll great speaking time it’s over. wonder unfortunate handful people deal re: distancing roofers working high-risk parents’ roof, would ever imagine I’ve never paranoid germaphobe. 

But it’s important say something, was, did. *India sets world record*

USA: Hold students... Opening schools playing football (even limited) pretty dumb.

But I'm pretty sure ""i told so"" doom brigade tried thing FL/ TX/ AZ/ GA/ CA.... disappear numbers naturally plummeted 5 states. states still fraction deaths NY/NJ despite confirmed ""cases"". 

So... ""wait 2 weeks"" nah? Figured eventually broken clock right twice day. numbers existed April could lead numbers saw 5 weeks ago, again. Sorry, surprised all. Saddened angry, surprised. I’m saying - plant 5 acres. sell 4 acres worth corn. light 1 acre fire? give away least good come it? 

It’s already grown....just let someone take it. Decline exactly. good number... cold. 4 endemic coronaviruses human population produce cold-like symptoms: OC43, HKU1, NL63, 229e. 160 different types rhinoviruses comparison. ""We're gonna try 12 years! lol jk maybe unless it?"" believe believes said. pastor, especially rich one. News like surprising more.

Wait get news like: Florida says parents won’t informed someone dies COVID-19 school People arnt working, money food.. Nobody breaking back feed stranger pocket happen  Depends country, two party-system everything political. Ok. what? lies, endangers us. protest allowed free reign. long? Why? Would pretty difficult suppressing death rate (I would hope)

""Did know 94% people died COVID actually underlying condition? COVID deaths count!""

[We unlikely reach herd immunity it’s 75% effective 1/3 won’t take Putin made sure vote count. don’t think mean 1% fatal Spanish flu. would fatality rate .025%. 2 million deaths whole world infected. willfully ignorant bred taught (or lack of) this? White House said necessary Americans get tested symptoms

Shouldn't President follow advice White House country citizens? us mexico borders closed. Well, (as people) too. stop voting interests time. According this, living family ""high risk activity"".

Can't really argue that, get jobs. very, very, very, very, very, very, surprising information. truly cannot believe mislead. Truly. Sad thing nobody learn anything online... generation fucked anybody already graduated high school last year set back drastically next years. lot 21 yo kids high school next 10 years IHME considers lock something like 85% reduction mobility reference point. Considering I'm one worst worst hit countries... place like NZ would really wonders mental health. I'm pretty sure there's law anywhere US mandates bras high heels. Breaking news!!: grass green They're paid more. Yes politicians political... point? call lies propaganda side might benefit them?

Or dont like hearing much one side lies cheats compared like remain willfully ignorant? Iowa State: [For love money
People steal mother - love money
People rob brother - love money - People can't even walk streets - they'll never know world they're gonna beat - mean, oh mean, mean green - Almighty Dollar! - Cash Money - love money - People lie, rob, cheat - love money - People care hurt beat - love Half us trying hard half wants everything burn ashes.  I’m slowly losing trust government agencies. evaluate circumstances given announcement making decision case. good deal faith NIH/NIAID now. also held FDA fairly high regard year. We’ll see goes. honestly great /r/iamverysmart material. Mass death Or, gonna sound crazy, could open read article realize youre totally guessing incorrect 

I know asking alot, got shoehorn ""fake news"" right?

You guys even lazy read article even know source declaring ""fake news"". getting pretty sad. destroy crop, don’t get paid either isn’t adding value. 

Or misunderstand this? So, yes, agree want plant think sell, overproduce, give away instead destroying it? sell ranchers/dairy farmers...etc feed? mom still keeps saying already election wouldn't, honestly? You’re retarded wife’s cunt. Much revenue everything-but-class category:

Lodging, food, sports, etc. point many college towns, entire city’s economy stores, restaurants, hair places etc would collapse one least near campus. work Sweden. hell would work America? First World: NATO allies
Second World: USSR allies
Third World: Everyone else


By definition First World, US first world country. Shithole days, yes. Third World? Literally possible. It’s true, many us in-between. don’t want rushed vaccine, especially it’s multiple vaccines row. Vaccines add herd immunity way.. vaccines history still survived epidemics natural herd immunity people got sick immune. nothing vaccines, vaccines aid faster someone else (trusted) put lien house? It’s Florida. There’s nothing need know that. you’re born Alabama, you’re willfully dumbass? Whether right wrong, really addressing either two people saying, x% people already it. 

If city 5% population already covid, sure they're gonna get hit hard, that's conversation here. negative implications? foreign relations already eroded trump. listen ex-allies Canada EUs' foreign leaders. already saying trust us 3 years. multiple already called us manipulation one wants report like that. think many borders closed Americans? cause think handling well. Check back year. we'll see. China already nearly these, US getting there....
Pot

Kettle Dude, bot, make identical comments different accounts.... DOJ captured agency like FCC left sensationalized EVERYTHING. Remember insane ventilator outrage? need held accountable. can't become immune? immunity lasts 3 months get back 0 excess deaths / week, feel pretty comfortable easing back normal hopefully. One cousins told straight face. Wish could go back tell Trump went bankrupt like 4 times. I'd rather NZ right instead now. dont know keep seeing post like this. Mayne open read lol. But, went Mexico like week ago. border closed tourists (visa). Residents citizens coming like nothing. waited 6 hour line. hell never again.  get overall point you’re saying, ridiculous extreme.  Yes does. understanding? obviously never took basic college level statistics class. Correlation equal causation. deaths one year mean Covid deaths. Covid positive tests Covid alone Covid deaths. car crashes. thing called ""retirement"". hubris melt away morph depression real fast. That’s we’re fucking mess. Could done may people hunkered governments better job contact tracing isolating. You’re really dumb aren’t you? oh god, I've sort scary dreams ;;

not quite chaos unleashing like 'what fuck outside without mask god stay away me' thing definitely Kids parents grandparents home. South Korea first list. would also add Cuba UC system says something. Otherwise listed others would consider credible. Cuba lot screwed things healthcare something quite professional about. Cringe Fake news Yep... “we people” something history books pray one day restored know wearing mask objectively good helpful! Although went highschool, wearing still matter. halls packed always touching someone else moving next class. No? 

He’s commander Chief, I’d hope gets tested lot. trying willfully ignorant here, bred raised way? think needs ""literally read"".

The CDC literally lists ""respiratory diseases"" 'Condition Group' ""adult respiratory distress syndrome"" 'Condition' co-morbidity datasheet.

If problem that, CDC. people Facebook pulled little tidbit CDC report ""proof"" pandemic lie. Ignoring information. It’s interesting too. wish mind could stop least time I’m asleep. 

Antimaskers lol - don’t know. wonder dreams masked people trying make freedums? Murdoch 2.0. tons '""""Local""'"" media outlets US. Social distancing works outside... Masks face shields too. People need eat live. probably cold dry climate Peru, specially time year. tropical country high altitudes, winter specially cold dry there. Okay, thank Sir/Mam... First I've seen recognition lives lost COVID-19

All hear day day numbers getting better worse, depends day.

Seriously though, run list names victims shit every day local news? Lockdowns come cost. One developing world bear brunt of. every thousand people want leave NYC hundred thousand wanting there. NYC survive thrive. Well pretty impressive considering average age population FL pretty high Also anyone 50-ish. Age major factor too. worse, simply reallocate taxes police military pay *shudder* PUBLIC SCHOOLS.  author raises lot great points. Hopefully others read article make think, rather reading title. relatively high mask usage like USA?

not country would chosen represent high mask usage... Problem herd immunity want 80%+ herd immune. far less 2% Americans actually contracted virus far. Nicaragua 
 
Central America Panama Central America though.. South America say died obesity would dumb. sure people need world black white... shades gray CDC number excess deaths scary too. lot people like ones talking trying get social credit score here, seems. NYC way towards becoming next impoverished hell hole. people thought Detroit bad, NYC become worse. We’re semantic argument without clarifying actually mean “patriotic” can’t agree disagree you. believe want understood use phrase “American Exceptionalism” think captures spirit hopefully mean. Teaching America somehow inherently better warping history based idea completely wrong. disagree premise can’t pride country things accomplished. Like countries history quite gray, black white. you’ve said nothing specific comment care elaborate I’d love hear take. free fuck time. You’re one who’s literally trying cancel social interaction humans forever **literally** reason. Young healthy individuals small portion country spread rest. people 40 zero weight, heart respiratory issues. 

Not sure ""afraid"" nonsense is. wear mask avoid riskiest activities. Like prone falling, live single level house. Minimize risk. glad dicknose meme sticking people Basically way investors flip nyc real estate Yay. hella stupid. will, NYC. get free karma hate China

But, tough. Use FaceTime stay close can. I’m due 3 weeks, yeah, we’ll newborn (plus 2.5 year old). don’t want take seriously that’s them, lucky far. I’m risk we’ve best follow rules. Plus, I’m FL cases still high, also don’t see wanting sit around house. one favor Trump followers consuming hydroxychloroquine bleach. Define ""mandatory"". fully expect fines maybe workplaces schools require vaccination. I'll little surprised police America ever going door door forcefully vaccinating people. Well, brain wave cite something peer-reviewed. say anything COVID-19. said Vitamin important building maintaining healthy immune system. fuck controversial statement? madhouse. read anything wrote? Oh here's logical fallacy using ""Moving goalposts informal fallacy evidence presented response specific claim dismissed (often greater) evidence demanded. attempt made score goal, goalposts moved exclude attempt."" move goal post. Vitamin important strong immune system? Yes no. I'm talking COVID clear. wear mask every time i'm outside house rep favorite band. i've made 2 new friends it! point may keep wearing mask even covid's one see janky smile i'm connecting people never would otherwise. get warm, fuzzy feeling every time thousand people die? sound like psychopath. wife Houston. interesting.

Because gets COVID tests multiple times day

Why flu serious? No, virus respiratory failure disease pneumonia symptom. disease. Get facts right spread misinformation. That's works. add symptoms count diseases. 

Diseases count Scleroderma; HIV Positive; Cystic fibrosis; diabetes; every type form cancer; celliacs disease; lymes disease; etc... Symptoms count. Quit making things understand. Yes diabetes high risk disease lot elderly people many young people that!! I've seen many people gangrene interning! sad. act like contribute infections disease managed. know talking can't base fact sources credible. know without doubt. U can't pin blames like unfortunately. spanish flu potentially started usa spread globally due shipping troops around. going blame every death flu season usa genetically traced spanish flu? 

Sure, blame death first 3 months due ccp lies. too. deserved countries getting angry them, countries did. that, blame ur nation's incompetence. many countries controlled outbreak deaths 2-3 digits, many sitting right next china. 

The salt still there, whether u like not. Teaching patriotism brainwashing serves reinforce weak state. frown done countries. different here.

The country either earns patriotism raise deserves it. yeah ton people asymptomatic lot places even offer testing without symptoms Absolutely insane take, [Here “The underlying cause death condition began chain events ultimately led person’s death,"" Dr. Robert Anderson, oversees CDC’s death statistics work, said statement. “In 92% deaths mention COVID-19, COVID-19 listed underlying cause death.""

PrE-eXiStInG cOnDiTiOnS!



/s student UA already means they’re dumbass. state Alabama willfully dumbass move Mask wearing act compassion, like holding door. 100% dead alive perfection capitalism? Doubt  There's ""shutting country down"". Wear mask curtail riskiest activities. Geez. Ooh, good one! needs new sub! inaugurate Herman Cain! Initially? probably provide protection corona infection. Also desire good citizen protect neighbors loved ones. 

If governments decide uptake little/too late? desire avoid fines penalty. 

120 years ago innoculatiin common vrs smallpox. ground scabs cut arm sprinckled dust wound. led cow infected cowpox house house, cut swabbed pus cow wound. FAR dangerous modern vaccine. 1 1000 would die it, serious illness common. whole lot better smallpox outbreak, governments it. Even though sometimes hold screaming children front sobbing mothers. 

If people decide wait vaccine en mass, government officials could say ""screw that, mandatory."" Love mask hope becomes social norm wear long term. Like even post Covid vaccine ever comes fruition. Makes feel much safer like fuck haven’t along anyways? Nicaragua too. people suspect China botched Coronavirus numbers, wait till see Nicaragua. totally beyond suspicion government acted. referring example killed 10% island little extra comfort. vast majority Americans obese suffering sort underlying condition, statistically makes sense? ventilator! wonder citizens Hong Kong, Uyghur muslims, victims North Korea's tyrannical regime China backs, neighboring countries play victim China's aggressive territorial games find solace notion China's governance model ""fascinating intellectual point view."" CDC know releasing statistics bad idea. expect lowest common denominators latch onto 6%? antibiotics helping, don’t need rest! Yay! Why? There's little virus transmission moment, number Covid patients [admitted intensive around 2 per day since July. 0 reported deaths last week, might adjusted cases probably lot.

What would gained Sweden mandated masks point? love school choice programs shown favor wealthy draw money away schools need :\^) multiple fonts convinced me! misrepresenting. say ""we're sure well masks work know tell you"". surgeon general said ""Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS! effective preventing general public catching Coronavirus..."" time later (a weeks? sure) started beating drum important masks are. would expect public believe that? I'm surprised many people actually wearing masks. volunteer shelter week, there's know-it-all boomer Karen says *everyone* there, *every* fucking week! thinks impressively clever brave. polite first, everyone openly rolling eyes right face. conspiracy theory thing honor every single soldier war, NAME, well every Hollywood actor, NAME, honor COVID-19 victims name, they're numbers.

Go ahead, tell I'm wrong, know I'm right.

If really many people dying COVID-19, tell one actual name victim this, one. decent honor mourn passing actual people identity, long chalk numbers, evidence believe shit. ...and proportionate number hospitals. 

They 80% positivity rate day. virus rampant we’ve seen pattern play every state got hit. less month they’ll sending patients hospitals state. weeks deaths start piling up. comes down. August 7th till 16th. Haven't, tell sometimes people car crash overweight. Crazy think car crash killed them.. think north Korea single case yet?

Not single case.

It's unicorns. Lol that's facetious argument, i'll indulge you. dad works hospital Canada, brother works hospital Brooklyn. pretty reliable sources. Tell me, get pandemic related information from? can't trust suntanned dog turd yellow hair black face wearer diaper! North america fucked! Testing absolutely trash NY NJ peaks; lot people got never got test. Much testing CA TX, big ""positive"" numbers, still likely way less actual cases NY / NJ. 

There's also much wider use masks (even partial incomplete), viral loads infected lower, many months, doctors much effective treating it. 

Also, nursing homes locked way tighter, at-risk folks better job avoiding it. Wonder Tim Horton say this. Actually [around paid sick leave all. retail service workers, know jobs around people most, goes 36%. Welcome India. Rome built day. going way 2-3 days year? current R0 viruses transmitted via routes COVID significantly 1 measures place currently. one used get sick 4 5 times year haven’t gotten sick since measures place. 

Regardless - statement directed socially acceptable practice sending kids school infectious. You’re right sending they’ve passed stage though. visit Saskatchewan manitoba, denialism running rampant too..... hardest hit state here, open bars indoor dining theaters friday.....

Murphy perfect overall pretty decent response pandemic. he's caving, possibly worst time. No, we'll get third wave colder weather. 

But third wave ending, people start getting vaccines. would think know sort numbers. That's ridiculous. britain actually 4th behind peru, belgium Spain dewths per capita. Chile, Brazil mexico, panama, bolivia, US marching quickly towards numbers. fall going tough Republicans. hope gets really bad elections impact even greater. Great, folks going start melting car engines drinking them. /s burning section country avoided chaos south northeast experienced already? Yep.

Seems so. pretty good shape think? Wow, amazing every article group generate Trump comment!  laughed way hard logic nobody ever died AIDS, ever. never kills you, wrecks immune system.

Also logic human ever died cancer. Cancer kill you. steals nutrients healthy cells.   still get soon available (though young healthy person, I'm sure be), understand fear. pro-vaccine getting flu shot yearly since ended getting swine flu 2019. one gives pause, sure, still get that's takes life go Think millions Trump saved heroic actions 🙈🙊🙉 Sweden pulled Cuomo nursing homes initially... Pick day calendar. Odds starting +9000 day. Yeah. sister’s boyfriend makes eye contact adjusts mask. 

Where from? I’m Philly originally always say “my accident” (but “on purpose”). wife says “on accident” descend monkeys. thought protected people virus, specifically wearer? one got welded apartments*

It's amazing insidious propaganda bleeds public consciousness, it? like run-up Iraq War, believe babies thrown incubators Saddam throwing living people shredders, unpatriotic Muslim-lover. Heat UV kill it. boil cotton mask leave sun, like others said. also get (or make) masks filter pocket, comfort cloth mask put surgical mask middle extra protection non-woven fabric middle. would make safer use mask couple days washes (if must). let *any* mask sit dry week, virus dead. virus extremely unstable own, outside much safer indoors, even crowded beaches parks. There’s nothing wrong Earth.


There’s something wrong SUN!!


I’m saying, toast burns, don’t blame bread.


(Arj Barker) mostly legs felt like took biggest hike life. arms would also hard lift times. strangest body ache back almost felt like back skin sore... strange everything else felt like type muscle pain key virus fight? Dudes joke now. weekend isn’t going make things better worse. It’s key virus fight. It’s another calendared social event pandemic. would blame Trump getting elected? breathelessly await deep interprepations. perfect FFCRA passed. kinda something. Congress threw us bone there. disinformation. seems mods given pulling stuff like that's getting upvoted. Comorbidities also include symptoms caused virus like respiratory failure pneumonia. So, got it, pneumonia, died cardiac arrest respiratory failure, boom, 3 comorbidities. 3 directly caused virus otherwise healthy person. 35,000 hypertension, 25,000 diabetes, 5000 obesity listed 160K. absolutely cannot draw conclusion data. Also, would guess elderly going cautious interacting people. need people might reasonably come contact infected person.

I know parents cautious. I’m cautious (+50yo), it’s one reason applied participate COVID trial. can’t afford Control Group doesn’t get real Vaccine catches disease.  Yeah shit, rest world knows since may acting consequence. Wake fuck USA. ever inclined giving information, I'd grateful. kid takes weekly plasma I'm looking go remote I'm vector kills him. policy. people I'm talking able tell policy means.

WhO cOuLd SeEn CoMiNg know white? Whys ? venmo online money transfer sites same: tigers kill you. Viruses ***by themselves*** can’t kill you. Wow *a dork* I’m curious place black girls? one dude earth stocks acai operation schmoney dance think happened? reduction mobility due people visiting many places, closer houses? indeed.  pandemic breaks lot things society setup around. yet White House race tightening. fucking terryfimg people stupid enough still vote vain patrician toddler agree timing driven professionals field political deadlines? fear historians scientists look opening schools universities person greatest failure entire pandemic. really want wrong way anything (testing, contact tracing etc.) put back box. Inspires much confidence. think I'll try approach dating life. Wasn’t estimation actual infected 10x confirmed? like 6.16 million infected Sweden socially conscious strikes sweeping statement. evidence support claim? think fact less asked relevant well.

Secondly, herd immunity, clear current restrictions Sweden along whatever else enough keep r 0. understand failure respect.

This say approve Swedish policy- think inhumane. describe body aches? I've tested negative twice throat, neck, upper lower back sore stiff almost six weeks. Ya think?! laugh cry this? I'm back Florida taking care father . I've Chicago past 8 years fucking bored sweaty. realize drank smoked much weed lived here. boring! fucking city I'm parks dont allow dogs. Wtf? thing observed California. Mask mandate hit literally inflection point cases. Yes! brother’s symptom. runs 5-7 miles several times per week, takes temperature daily (since March). Never even slight fever. Zero respiratory symptoms. got tested whim, almost two weeks 5 days mild symptoms, (testing easy country) shocked find positive. Researchers believe much dose get determine sick get. That’s many young, fit doctors die: give resusitation CPR extubate covid patient get blast full face — over, get sick. 

It’s another reason say spend 10 minutes non-family member, keep distance, wear mask: even crappy mask likely keep getting fatal dose.

Yeah go front line serve yourself. want explosive diarrhea. Pastor John MacArthur middle fight state California holding person services, said stats prove pandemic. 


""I want offer kind expert, rather telling report came week, and, first time, heard truth. CDC ... said that, truth, 6% deaths occurred directly attributable COVID. 94% cannot. 160,000 people died, 9,210 actually died COVID. pandemic.""

MacArthur added:
""We've suspicious fact we've meeting together weeks weeks weeks, know anyone who's ill. Nobody congregation ever hospital ... 

We know reasons nothing virus. There's another virus loose world virus deception, one behind virus deception arch-deceiver, Satan himself. surprise that, midst deception, great effort going shut churches preach gospel."" second wave coming already rising cases. BC still wishes open schools mind boggling. realize actually go store order get grocery shopping done Walmart... Right? buy car part last month able add grocery pickup cart... loaded car stuff questions asked! 

I asked person loading groceries said would bring load item ordered via grocery pickup!

What saying people really stupid protesting inside Walmart. stop getting groceries, less likely get job Walmart recognize hiring process. prices acai bowls go understand sentiment, appreciate optimism, misguided.

Look people toilet paper. TOILET PAPER. shit difference whether safe covid, people still demolished stores got gunfights it. imagine would happened masks? doubt people would looted hospitals them. Q: mean? There’s age A: testing older people. huge problem. Basically people really need vaccine Q: many companies testing older A: real reason want test younger people know respond better likely get immune response lead approval.

I guess that's one things Chomsky meant said logic capitalism blocks companies useful things: hate vote mail, try get absentee ballots they're gonna *pissed*. What’s point comparing today’s numbers April. Plenty countries worse numbers today April. least decline cases means population taking seriously, contrary headline suggests. That’s ridiculous.

Still sense smell never cough fever anything Probably them... Bad habits, ignorance, malice... could open schools universities could make semester money tuition shut checks cleared greatest, beautiful world. quite people would argue that. I’m one them.

The wealthy educated less less motivation desire stay. would we? treated like trash. would want exist society like that? rarely comment posts tens thousands votes thousands comments, off-chance see this, OP, thank you. someone fed anti-maskers sometimes wonders I'm even bothering wear mask first place meant stop potential spread me, really needed read article. signed phase 3 trials (50% chance getting placebo), would fine taking vaccine made phase 3. Uh huh. I'm buying this. I’m sure big mask pushing propaganda!! Imo ECMO quite rare medical resource , hundreds China , guess patient got ECMO critical time ,and work ,so treatment continued finally recovered. U can't take ECMO away patient good .

I notice :"" critics questioned ethics using treatment cost high death rates ""

Maybe critics thought patient would suffer treatment , suppose patient die peace? btw cost free traveled Thailand surgery years ago. total flight, medical care, 10 days recovery suite nearly 3 weeks leave work $11,000 USD **less** expensive surgery done hospital half mile house States convalescing home. system broken.

Woohoo beat virus /s Well shit Stunning revelation 🤪 First question. makes ridiculous nonsensical polls?
Second question. fucking cares? Taking bets everything closes including schools sorry mist wrote small bit. pre condition dealing with. strain mental . covid thing happening around world . snap reality Yeah, sounds like bullshit me, well behaved toddler would probably wear mask least time old enough. tried yet. They're virtually doctors Amazon huge problem counterfeit products. store types products sent different sellers together grab order comes in, regardless seller order for. always gamble getting real thing something could potentially make sick. Plus, wearing mask makes look like Lone Ranger!￼ knew pretty much beginning people certain conditions vulnerable. think proposal actually means practice. imagine government proposed paying obese people stay home months rest us basically left alone get disease still decent chance sending us hospital? represent different voting bloc deserve representation. uneducated deserve disenfranchised, sometimes unto fault own? Works me. trying get retired dad Florida awhile. townhome valued 80k bottom crash valued $217k. Dueces. Yes like north pole, people live employees paid sugary beverages christmas cheer “He’s seen doubters first hand. recovering home, houseful TikTok influencers across street threw massive parties despite lockdown made news Mayor Eric Garcetti shut property’s power. De-evolution really real too.”

It’s beautiful world...for you...but me. 152 cases 52 needed shut university New York State. It’s high number considering exponential spread virus exacerbated group indoor spread. 

They won’t able contain it. latest case/death charts South Dakota. Impressive spike cases, although deaths remain Law enforcement violent unfair Latin America much breaking news ""bears shit woods"" Haha keep trusting China. fucks reason world dealing virus. tried keep quiet months help WHO. locked Wuhan still allowing people travel world spreading like wildfire. Life good me, problem calling negligence handling virus. Keep mind Moscow already approved vaccine.

North America hasn't. Parents Year awards go to... exactly point. measures arbitrary impossible comply country millions even fridge home. Totally disconnected reality. 2014 called, want insult back.

If want debate platform free logical fallacy personal attack, reddit lol.

It says equally much character assume since comment OP disagreed ""radical"" liberal Democrat (as opposed moderate liberal removed far left political left typically make a] personal attack [they] disagree someone.

I'm tired hearing excuse. Plenty conservatives damn thing. Here's latest case/death charts Iowa Dakotas, running 7-day curves promising. keep clipboard since certain individuals can’t get thick skulls. one of, the, top medical journals. individuals recovered age subjects 49. 2 months recovery. 100 patients, 78 changes heart. 76 patients signs cardiac injury seen heart attack. 60 signs inflammation. independent preexisting conditions.

If you’re troll you’ll change tune setting multiple generations sorts cardiac problems years now. Agreed. people actually listen instead going pool parties, run around streets burning shit ground chanting catch phrases, go stupid motorcycle rallies etc amazing country accomplish. good news people refusing? Okay well first all, covid's IFR 1%. That's CFR. Actual mortality much lower. 

Secondly, cannot compare 1918 2020. 
People live much densely modern travel much instantaneous. speeds spread significantly. 

Third all, modern medicine. AKA, vaccine. yeah, dramatic readings entertaining informed lol. Getting passport leave soon husband can. Imagine 4 years would Country's collective IQ... Thank you. Agreed, paper NYC reopen, huge system outbreaks. question many large need system moves virtual. see could conclude that, gestures commentary told different story. ""See? Numbers tell story want to!"" said ""see numbers misleading? Watch bullshit!"" probably would different opinion. Hell, work food service time manager tells ""mark receipts"" rushes order so, order gets fucked up. Sorry take 30 seconds make sure people get right dressing salad.

Rushing never helps unless mindless ""stamp exact way"" type job Bullshit. real reason road connects Central South America environmental engineering reasons. worth it. Farc dismantled inactive many years now. insane many people think fit .2% category. Like America prob 94% survival rate. fought other. Don’t believe didn’t. totalitarian control surveillance shut dissent there. 

They even individual towns villages erecting homemade barricades keep anyone coming out. 

They targeted anyone Wuhan even hadn’t lived years. True. one half month holiday summer, one half month winter, still another half month left split extended weekend trips. Europe kicks ass. Lockdowns effective combination policies after.

Like contact tracing, surveillance testing, etc.

If laws people aren’t amenable full solution, doesn’t work. never need one, sars mers burnt out. One Skåne four Stockholm. 3 deaths 21/8 three spread 25th, 28th 30th August. Well, overall case/death stats Maricopa county (where ASU located), plus running 7-day deaths trending down. current per capita death rate county 67.28 per 100k population, ranks 474th among US counties Trials never going completed emergency approval take 2 years. follow extended period time one big thing looking immunity starts waning. always plan. think Oxford gave original timeline September despite knowing phase 3 lasting least 18 months (and shortest planned phase 3)? government world right planning wait full end phase 3's. initial review, aware effective vaccine safety. biggest hurdles. 

And yes, vaccines currently produced- risk. thrown away deemed ineffective. Production nothing approval. Anyone produce anything; mean it'll used. 

It extremely irresponsible make statements even get initial data. literally basing whole argument unknown. Parents cannot trusted keep sick kids home. Teachers dealing ""twelve o'clock fever"" years parents load kids drugs kill symptoms send school. Yeah really misleading title I'd say I'm American lol

What else got bag propaganda trained like dog say? Fucking Russian news bot.  well said USA: *hold beer* seem really uninformed plan. strongly suggest read [this reopening schools questions concerns directly addressed. Panama could considered South America geographically well. Part country ""cut point"". Useless information still tbf asymptomatic adults. lie tell truth number serious cases hospital? anchor trying paint situation dire, said 3 beds 100 allocated COVID patients occupied. *laughs freedom* need endless lockdown. need targeted tight lockdown strong contact tracing. However happening freedom. Good. DeSantis handled well. Lockdowns mask orders infringe freedom unconstitutional. article sensationalist junk. So, study finds children shed virus 2-3 weeks whether symptomatic shed bodily fluids well. adults. new information missing something here? might want read thread big guy

Many stories people insurance still opt go countries *still* way less

If wanna delude better countrymates whatever, seems make feel better run bud

The smart people keep going places get completely ripped died bullet bullet obviously Well think terms genetic diversity- it’s matter strains - virus does/should tiny mutations every reproduction, get 100 virus particles vs 10,000 chances virus reproducing successfully different. yeah, viral load/dose matters. Also, smaller dose time immune system identify mount response. 

I’m thinking healthcare workers get shithoused Covid much more. weekday/weekend flow info pattern. Unintelligible babble left, usual. It’s true didn’t expect do. Good thing current vaccine front runners aren’t rushed! proceeding quickly corners cut. Good considering it! 


As should.. I'm sure. think sub well moderated, considering fact, maybe need (considering still here). Hey feel frustration us believe climate change real tangible threat civilization needs mitigated. Years proof increasingly abnormal weather events, loons. sorry hear this.  pains I’ve lost friends this. simply can’t imagine must feel you’re dealing family.  Good luck 🍀👍 stay strong exactly mean. 

Could honest, straightforward talk, stats?

Instead, get, this. Well escalated quickly... Except ohio. 7th populous state cases riiiiising.. neighbor buying Insulin Coumadin Sarnia. told 75% less buying plus shipping. would still better deal even shipping costs high are. Like rest us. God hate posts like yours, reason can't make comment without sounding like racist.

I going say something like ""Thanks NPR. human interest peice exactly needed trying track status coronavirus. /S""

I sick everything made political, especially constant bashing right. people like come long validate bashing.

They human beings, lives human rights matter. I'm heartless suffering, even believe need stop illegal immigration tighten borders immigrants documented upon entry. Nah cool. Trump appointed head CDC thinks herd immunity way go. Totes safe. Nothing worry about.

/s cant see sarcasm professor seemed thoroughly enjoy teaching people mislead create false narratives numbers.

IDK, kind sounds like professor really effective way teach people teach people detct bullshit. ask much, know 5 deaths reported today? Thank ""official"" answer get NeEd VacCiNE oh mah gawd dur dur dur.

I'm vaccines, astonishing quickly every major leader world jumped vaccine bandwagon actual nature corona virus even public knowledge. Again, paying premium one haves. seem grasp basic concept. Honest question, guys enjoy following league table, pretty much way watch football? really seems so. really liked comment. I’m religious, highly science-minded person here. believe Big Bang, evolution, etc...one greatest irritations college LSU anti-evolution people would show evolution/science speaking event &amp; cause ruckus... forgive people simply don’t understand statistics open mind willingness consider opinions explanations facts. ex-friends (now) propagating myth simply fits political beliefs. matter said, can’t see past idea Trump attack COVID-19 thing fake. Almost 200K deaths US alone think it’s fake. Smh.  Sorry rant. certainly Trumpians rush approval process proper clinical trials conducted evaluated. Unfortunately, US, told beginning masks work even (the particles small travel cloth). government ran it. told wear mask protect others that’s lost half population. Caring others something many Americans interested in. S’pose inject believe incredibly realistic. got point. got point pecked letters keyboard nub pencil duct taped forehead. R naught Covid-19 far higher ailment treated Ludens cough drops aisle 3b Rexall. fatality rate much higher, well. I’m fine cannabis. don’t need eat people’s faces. I’ll let Floridians themselves. 

The best part global warming least Florida goes first. “Hold breathing tube” - USA leaders can’t even agree paper ballots. specific. I've heard one. fun. /s. Yes, think low education USA cult personality around “I won’t wear mask” Trump.

I’m Canada, messaging changed, mask usage went up. cities affected, mask wearing high. one made political issue here. It’s public health issue, period.

American politicians huge reason confusion reluctance wear masks. anti drug posters, implying everyone smoked joint would automatically become junkie destined end homeless OD. 

Being dishonest public ethical efficient. small, tiny, fraction symptomatic cases end hospitalizations, hospitalizations evolve intensive care, fair chunk intensive case need ventilation. surprised see otherwise progressive people supporting kind thing. Thats maybe dumbest thing I've read awhile

Enjoy paying premium and, lol, proud Wtf wrong US?!

In country pay 30 bucks per month health care earn minimum salary.

Our doctors free, pay expensive gett 95% geimbursed.

Furthermore, dont pay surgery.

Wtf wrong there? peak April, NYC experiencing 700% total mortality compared normal. That's would look like let virus run natural course. entire US experienced one month 700% mortality, looking 1.5 million excess deaths one month alone. 25 percent plus many people wearing masks, social distancing, even people staying home helps slow spread also eases fear extent. Behind every conspiracy theory false statistic someone who's scared reality deadly virus. dumb attempts divert conversation seem think clever know called, they're absolutely using biggest number headline. 31% tested students positive could 31 students. ""31% students tested positive"" much impressive headline ""31 students test positive."" DMC confirmed evidence support masks help prevent covid. I'm sure I'll get downvoted saying though. Wow, making sense first time. Again, country haves nots. nots nothing drags averages down. Start adding zeroes dataset suddenly looks horrible. get think resign? 

It looks like task force telling officials ""we need this"" officials exact opposite. So, shave 5% want careful, make sure add back 50K excess deaths beyond confirmed cases.  Ok. aren’t refuting anything I’m saying. He’s President US gets treatment standard care beyond average person limited COVID testing. Nothing said response anything fact life. There’s nothing refute. isn’t anything disagree with. Elected officials highest levels access things average person not.

Secret service detail one things. That’s fact.

I’m sure part disagree think false delete that's best...? universities aren’t opening grade schools, opening east point anti-vaxxers. Meaning, need take science seriously, using facts help convince getting vaccinated right thing do. ask parents grandparents responded mass vaccinations Polio vaccine '60s. world better it. basically statistics class structured college. would get directive data set, support directive. Next question would data set different directive. 

I absolutely loathed class. professor seemed thoroughly enjoy teaching people mislead create false narratives numbers. Sickening me, reality world. Lie, cheat, steal, win. American - could still medically bankrupt free healthcare? cover oncology care needed? sound different American healthcare. difference client willing frontload benefits, seem relevant comparing healthcare systems. I'm sorry fuck conclude fewer 9000 people died COVID-19 page?

It literally displays death count hundred thousands... say temperature. I'm trying answer question people assumed virus would die summer. I'm also saying assumption correct. I'm crazy antivaxxer, I'll take chances virus that's killing around .2% vs rushed vaccine. 162 grain scared, want wear masks. Thank you! No, confused. make claim reduced mobility 68 percent. National avg 65 percent.


and proof eyeballing trough graphs, misleading really understand data actually tell use it.

I explained definitely confounding factors seem understand proxy data actually want.

I also think confused. think ideologue particularly give shit facts. likely people board kept saying ""we bad sweden"". actually overtaking sweden, bit humorus. haha funny tho. Wait, spelled ""Kindergarden""?? life... agree then. Cool. Sweden one worst death rates, get bullshit here. would love believe silver lining pandemic us reevaluating ton different policies things accepted norm, I'm holding breath. (But wearing mask.) kid 0 symptoms tested contact positive case. whole thing remains obscure me. Obviously, middle ground COVID hoax COVID end world. taking report context running moronic, especially since many comorbidities caused virus first place! report say 96% deaths underlying conditions. Someone died pneumonia CAUSED COVID infection considered someone comorbidity.  Dude literally told people outset pandemic wear masks public....

We would better without Could please let know plan would president? see lot type posts putting blame may well deserved. could outline plan would’ve effective? percentage would dead anyway, professor? done it. solved it!  flu contagious seasonal flu shots mitigate this. clearly novel virus higher virulence would exceed normal flu deaths.

The point is, risk group. everyone, even people worry dying it.

Of course mindful around them, society come grinding halt. Gotcha, thanks clarification!  many people long-haulers, cardiac damage, lung damage, chronic fatigue? data that? Okay. people jump 3rd floor survive too, let's then, non-issue. flowers plant growing helping this. jungle back balcony lol written time really idea going covid. Here's new ones. Highly unlikely children spreading virus adult does. cannot continue road. People scared death arguing people cautious Coronavirus responsible spread Coronavirus large numbers prolonged period time, people think overblown, hoax, harmful, problem, etc. go business usual? cut testing case numbers half. pandemic over! Unfortunately yet accurate way measure stupidity downstream effects “light” I’m referring range March-May haven’t awhile. miss words “may” “surge”. Glad see everyone still freaking out. I’ve seen US started social distancing earlier, thousands lives could’ve saved, I’ve never seen anything suggest millions would’ve died. guess entirety US followed strategies northeast, namely sending covid patients nursing homes/assisted living facilities, yeah, might see lot deaths. you’re fear mongering assumes 100% population would’ve infected March alone, which, course, possible. Story County? school started yesterday, board meeting Thursday see switching hybrid virtual. Story Co 20%, letting 25,000 ISU football fans go games acceptable. 

We sure well. guess depends rebuttal, calling end money state plan production distributions yes, dir ty com mie li b, idea money efficiently equally spent rules put place penalize making x-amount dollars name redistribution funds run mill li b pros cons side econ omic argument.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes increasing testing tracing isolating. don’t seem mandatory testing program all. maybe couldn’t find it. certainly easy question. one hand herd immunity argument, argument young children likely favor getting vaccine all, least early on. guess I'm thinking children simply put way bottom queue, perhaps need all. Please explain yourself, without condescending. I’m simply asking question. 
You first said 103, don’t die anything old age. 
You said everyone dies something like pneumonia organ failure. 
Now saying dying old age dying organ failure thing. 
Do see little confused point trying make? No, person statistically likely pre-symptomatic completely asymptomatic.  live outer Chicago suburban area. went get tested believe end May? finger prick, sit 30min, gave results. thought test widespread here? Assuming 3773 actual number today addition raises doubts about. test positive college, count case home state state college in? really think need stop tracking cases like hawk. accuracy many cases given time far variable (by even referring accuracy tests themselves, rather getting tested). first testing people sick, even symptoms bad get test. catching lot mild asymptomatic cases. recently cdc changed recommendations don’t think asymptomatic people need seek test.

What really need tracking hospitalizations deaths. much concrete stable tracking metric. We’ve seen spikes cases haven’t led dramatic spikes deaths hospitalizations. think need stop publicizing case numbers basing policy case numbers especially % positive go danger maxing hospital capacity we’re seeing dramatic spikes deaths. Well, it’s true didn’t get there. many exposed also valid question. importantly: many give to? strain cluster seen returning traveller New Zealand previously. can't tell straight face 180k COVID deaths ones seasonal flu also take out.

Given flu factually kills average 30k per year. Yeah.

180k COVID deaths ones seasonal flu also take out.  Yeah coworker think covid GONE, everything open back we'll go back living life like before. covid overblown, need shutdowns, shutdowns BS make Trump look bad bc he's ""so good economics."" 

I agree huge problems, sucks, among things public messaging shit show start. also think open everything back free all, wants. whatever. Things bad know do. kind experts leadership could really study issues provide guidance. /S

I said things go back normal election, whatever would fucking mean, I'd bring snacks. happen? Like maybe month, lot agree, places back open. Buddy come small town almost straight small businesses local artists, I'm one states stricter shutdowns. 

The thing that's shutting businesses huge proportion customer base feel safe coming ongoing virus. that's going away. Like I'm trying support local businesses much there's much one consumer, need get point people need worry they'll catch even people still wear masks around people they're absolutely required to. 

Like likely everyone wore masks public could go back least close normal pretty short order. know see happening. Q Pretty sure thousands people POTUS racist, ignorant, moron doesnt listen Dr. Faucci anyone else. He's full shit. Look age breakdown deaths less certainty decent percentage would fact dead right now, certainly would died within next years regardless covid Informative worked daycare 10+ years. spot on. fucked  another thing add argument Greek life run course become liability point Florida Texas doctors benefitted knowledge northern doctors learn hard way.

Also, we’re supposed one country. mean ... probably not? exact absence fear leads people jumping zoo fences take selfies bears.  thought Cheney behind scenes puppet master though?

Kinda like Putin Well, community colleges care... Especially since see tuition! point forgiving it’s kid’s fault, ones punished stick school day feeling crappy... many people stated. No, not. constant fear porn ""we're re-opening there's 0 new cases"" nonsense responsible this.

At point basically political I'm sick it. Watch magically stop November (the politicization, I'm talking virus). Kids always get sick. parents choose true issue not. choose all, would miss many days work. kids going school sick matter what. yeah get that.

i guess i'm saying someone presented data one column ""deaths covid cause"" i'd initially come conclusion deaths healthy people. i'd think little deeper numbers. ""Wants"" we're screwed. Maybe can't teach, learned, system also shitty 20 years ago...

Also speaking children teenagers. can't teach 10 yo math language basics art science, read book while. 

Not implementing couldn't, fact think intelligent person debating logical level. saying... 

And admit right. everyone wits teach child. 


But everything better Hauptschuleeee! Iowans gonna Iowa, guess 😣 .. hope proves worth y’all.  10 days mandatory call child services here.

Is American thing? *jeepers* dude - extreme reaction kid illness. Statistically people passing around 6% meme probably 94%. forgetting strain cluster seen elsewhere New Zealand stage pandemic including returning travellers.  school nurse never turned anyone away. girls would go every month, people sick, go home, stayed end school. Looks like vaccine trick... Florida man opens nursing homes deadly plague, expects consequences feel like goes bit deeper that. 4% positive rate imagine least people sick way going way get tested. Feel like group used common sense one attended felt sick. group 70, 2.6 people could Covid positive going positive rate. However people may felt sick didn’t show look studies see many positive cases Asymptomatic I’ll pick middle 40%. leaves 1 person group maybe? says asymptomatic spread rare outside makes spread even less common. Sounds less less like coin flip. 

As death rate continues fall, you’ll see people going move living lives. That’s bit false analogy. immune system protect viruses. immune system cannot protect knife jugular vein. 

I agree many factors, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure heart disease preventable illnesses increase chances covid death.

I wish address heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure. Masters public health (mods still haven’t approved even though reached y’all), wish took comorbidities seriously. take seriously, mean create funding opportunities local health centers. far health promotion least funded underpaid career, speaking experience here. permit terrorist work healthcare, absolutely expect such. maybe live NY Cuomo problem letting infest nursing homes. know.

All I'm saying people vote November... see. COVID hurt [DJT's ratings much America fire local state leaders twiddling thumbs... that's people like.  live parents. main concern giving them. cannot trusted keep sick kids home. 

All due respect, it’s trust. people don’t means society take sick day. It’s choice putting food table roof head, starving evicted. 

Perhaps it’s less parents instead shift blame appropriately; government corporations. kid 4th week in-person school, still waiting said disaster.  news to? Snowflake 🤣 mad Jesus followers: actually! can’t wait go back homeschooling kindergarten kids easy task.

Its easy task kids age, patient are. sucks, kids fall routine quickly consistent. waver even once, kids remember aim that. Oh worry plenty ass hole tourist town trying get herd immunity propaganda virus spread purposefully. clearly power grab. don’t see point don’t know tell you. think least consequences intended sabotage schools. torsos people understand guys. equivalent going back hometown seeing every single person dead. Nobody asked much, look countries thing less control.

Wear masks half hour public places like supermarkets public transport. Try avoid crowds, party many people, skip large gatherings year. go planes cruise ships without good reason. Plus half-decent/competent testing tracing, thing less control. Still big issue sure, 190,000 dead, mentioning long-term effects.

All necessary common sense, couple inconveniences time. Instead got 190,000 dead. Good job.  wear googles face shield cover eyes.

N95 filtration material. tight sealing mask without best filter layer. fit well nose bridge. Yeah, ""evolution"" theory people too. Go figure. that's problem, basing rule enforcement personal feelings inherently corrupt. That's legal system rules prevent judges whatever like, police follow rules arrest on. 

You may think elderly people worth children, make fact mean criticising opinion, people would disagree with, crime. lots areas limited housing world. Ever tried find place Berlin? Munich? Paris? Milano? insanely high prices (not high major US cities, though), others rent control. none problems described above. immigrants unable finding place live, illegal squatting family members. voluntary, mandatory mass testing HK. probably guessed name, hell even mistook reply notification notification sub.

Any way definitely agree theory much Australians likely travel Americans average (i say average Australia even tenth pop U.S.) also really well thought explanation, thank that.

Also take account amount Americans Visa's versus Aussie's? could difference people going? Although like said I'm pretty certain right based economic differences general public's. Huh, USA government actually something? Maybe speaking soon. always time royally F things report San Diego County Public Health Officer lol, what's ignorant reporting numbers informing public? Thanks! idiots evetywhere. got notification thought said “Fauci makes blunt” choked water. cares, one MD put - ""I diabetes. also healthy enough run ultra-marathons. get COVID doctors trouble controlling blood sugar hospital die - COVID killed me. Thank listening TED Talk."" almost like lot practice living disease infested shit hole.

China Lied, thousands died. Ok think understand. Masks important ones told wear may may effective important. hospitals need wear masks anyway like original post says. im crystal.

Ok equating effectiveness importance. 
Dr Fauci speaks absolute truths research sources understand speech.

By way masks help certainty would reason wear them. Im programmer trade definition logic may differ. 

But get now. Sorry, what's new specific recommendations - monkey say ""ventilate"" what's new precision: 4-6 air exchanges per hour (which measure CFM) use MERV-13 possible. right: test everyone quarantine positives. Complete horseshit. Look ages people died. reasonable person look list people 100 40 suggest people woudn't died causes naturally.

Common infections, cold pnumonia kill old people hospitals time.

Fauci full shit.  thought dumb Americans protested testing pro birth anti abortion base wants. anything get elected. pro choice past popular evangelicals pro birth instead. Important note free testing 🤪 Well thats day's worth testing spread 5 months ... kind drop bucket. Oh god couldn’t gotten anywhere else. Stay home you’re scared America It’s inhumane keep people away family end life. matter flip it. probably less year live anyways, would want spend without family? Absolutely not. There’s person alive would want that. right decision. BS trump fudging numbers! Subdividing house sounds like fairly reasonable opportunity additional income... However, imagine evict someone literally living home parking driveway.. great situation, all. live area high demand outside major metropolitan area people fleeing looking rentals, would way take advantage. every experience I’ve ever indoor temperatures higher gets cold outside stop pumping air conditioning.

reading realized I'm cheap hell keep 76-78 indoors summer using AC 68-70 winter heat oops lol  Excess death might better number...which even larger hypothesis old people pretty much going die anyway, coronavirus front-loaded them, guess test if, eventually, fewer old people die given period over? might depend college going to, work University Idaho tests taken campus reported Latah County, university is. bill negotiated passed. way save grandama prevent getting it. going get shooting crack street, she'll get nursing home janitor, got teen bagging groceries, got sunday school teacher.......

We dont say ""dont drive blacked out"" say ""Dont Drink drive""

Severity means nothing considering spread disease. key part transition time setting monthly medical monitoring program,"" NPR's Anya Kamenetz reported on Morning Edition. ""The plan test small sample asymptomatic students, teachers staff every month coronavirus.""

See, reason 100% districts everywhere going this. I'm teacher MA, widely regarded great public school system, yet see single district even commit testing, let alone great plan like this. district actively DISCOURAGING testing, yet using cases per 100k town guide decisions. blatantly cherry picking data make sure schools stay open in-person. People upset teachers flipping out, admin fucking answers pushing things along. Plans like would go far show support commitment, damn shame teachers threaten strike make happen little jerks throwing super-spreader parties infected 533 students 4 faculty members far. 

We send entitled brats home. dopes need college all. people taking education seriously deserve go college pandemic. Surely deserving people enjoy privilege substance-abusing knuckleheads. Lmao. Pot, kettle, black compassionate instead forgiving. kid's fault got sick parent (s) let stay home school. feel terrible kids sleepy fall asleep school. Medication makes sleepy.

My kids got everything first year. adjusting immune systems must stronger. hardly get sick now. think rule different little kids, say 1st grade kinder.

Hopefully schools school nurse. remember going lay dark quiet room adjacent nurse's office. especially nice mom come get stay day. 

I agree statement buck stop parents, also see predicament single parent risks losing income call in. visiting client told us time drop everything relocate another continent month new factory behind schedule. company gave 24 hours notice going gone indeterminate amount time. colleague looked asked two kids? said mother took care gone. said parents picture single parent, way could gone. gave strange look said ""Well, told go, figure go."" never occurred say no.

American companies expect total dedication employees many employees provide without question. That's move up. families collateral damage. Personally want someone working willing sacrifice family job. Trump vote vote fascism worst, best means claim left social issues, none influenced decision way. big football fan... That's case years.

The difference infectious disease affect sign risks. half translating original German, that's :)  makes sound past tense, finished. still dealing it. lot better states lot better home, UK... ""Football"" daft yank. state kindergarten optional, 

I virtual kinder love dealing physical classroom 1st without one kinder hard enough, without infraction year learning, issues far making rethink stance.

(I love kid's teacher, love school, hate virtual platform particularly fond administrators virtual school.) Me: Oh look state.

Also me: Oh look, town. -\_- Oh fuck's sake everything people global coordinated. virus climate change food. *anything* nationalistic everyone thing? Even true:

I would bet healthy portion people underlying conditions know underlying conditions. Due fact good bit people either don’t health care can’t afford regular screenings. That’s death certificates work. Ironic Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Everyone’s rates rise, that’s literally positive 7 day rate means - rise cases last 7 days.

[Greece’s cases rising rate UK well 20 per 100,000 level established would Scottish government go greece somewhere like Portugal, 21 cases per 100,000 rather 14? Portugal far greater threat imported cases right now.

If don’t know interpret data, stop posting misinformation it. Yea well obviously everyone can’t. Many jobs essential utilities emergency services. 

A lot transmission healthcare settings obviously can’t ‘hunker down’. Daily contact part job. 

Then we’ve got fact many nations consequences ‘hunkering down’ far weigh dangers covid. poor nations stimulus cheques ride through. even countries manage impossible ‘hunker down’ soon opened virus would get back in. combination great, face shield however not. Myocardial injuries ""no symptoms"" thing. headlines always ridiculous. Reddit doesn’t cushy work home jobs. don’t know anyone that’s solely working home anymore. May place business decided enough working home we’re back office. Rush hour crowded it’s ever been. Fauci Bill Gates financial stake vaccine patents. I'm still trying analyze CDC admitting covid numbers interesting. Texas teacher. 10% accounts students sick illness place least year knowledge. Flu COVID (and anything else) count towards 10%. looking you, glad I’m alone. Schools get easter Easter. get Sunday. never heard public school getting good friday off. Note fact 11-3 vote confirmed publically relative teacher went back work today, visiting elderly family yesterday. Got sent home work got cough. Turns feeling unwell since yesterday. thought appropriate response feeling unwell global pandemic visit elderly folk go work. Despite hearing sixth months COUGH = STAY HOME.

So really, parents, turns morons everywhere! asymptomatically contagious issue here. Viruses trend less deadly time people aren’t dead spread better. asymptotic spread don’t know cause evolve weaker. ""Death solution problems. man - problem.""  this. Sofar know Covid-19 causes kinds cardiovascular diseases including several lead multiple organ failures, degradation neural tissue, brain periphery, chronic degradation lung capacity blood oxigenation. that's things know half year. know anything long term effects all.

So, scared shitless, reading news. link study? what's point? supposed pay everyone's kids fed housed case something happens? 

Once kids, like not, life changes... expect neighbor change life too. already safety nets, improved? Sure. expanding kind state ran daycare borderline communism book, I'm pretty far left. 

Again, universal healthcare, good; free state public university, good; free tax funded daycare, bad. likely engineered where. wonder one-third Americans vote for. 🤔 really can’t compare stocks property. don’t contract company bought stock in. purchase stock, ongoing costs. renter doesn’t pay, I’m $2,000 month, regardless property increases decreases value. don’t pay taxes unless sell. pay property tax whether renter pays rent not. people self-centered lazy. care anything else.

So everyone keep trying change instead building systems work it? ignorant taken down. 

Co-morbidities underlying conditions. means pneumonia along Covid. still died Covid. sensitive? make sense. no, 90% positives sick/contagious (not accurate, less that) mean testing joke. We've known since literally day 1 virus spreads pre-symptomatic people.

Your entire post basically ignoring everything knew form beginning confirmed virus. see right wing echo chambers without single scientific thought. Deaths hospitalizations rise numerous areas overall higher months ago. Also, small blip downward due suppressed testing/data reporting data back proper hands seeing trend continue. staggering numbers across country, 500-1k deaths day easily 30k+ cases low day, extremely disturbing compared countries. seems powers care that, however. 

It'd simple shut properly month two save many lives, much pain, much economic damage. it, still can. won't. fucked. ⁹.  Trump try sell 9,000 died COVID-19. brain dead followers eat like eat excrement daily. Great question. may give chance reduce chances killing others. worrying might called schools think procedures ""...we compared database patients receiving lithium catchment area (437 patients) registry patients positive COVID-19. found none infected. finding prove lithium effective COVID-19, number patients taking lithium infected, hypothesis would considerably nullified.""  Yeah I'm glad that's **totally** enforced. Point is, bunch arguing back forth something best-effort best hold entire country hostage it.

Re-open already, getting silly. first thought “Wow, parents class, anxiety must roof now” surely struggled decision send kid school. Schools get funding/payments based many students attend day. county, $200 per student per day. That's main reason rules exist. Really? I'm literally exposing everyday job. I'm denying dangerous care there's nothing short quitting job privilege do. read wrong. covid mean can't unrelated heart attack
No one claimed unrelated, heart attack covid way means covid caused it. covid cause die, every death covid. Ok well that’s true... many would already died. many way past average life expectancy. Wtf talking about. exists vaccine, assuming immunity life long....which certainly don’t know yet, recent evidence suggests probably isn’t. Greece’s cases pretty much exactly UK’s moment cases actually marginally last week.

Stop talking nonsense.    
Their rates clearly rise.      Personally think always use percentage. meaningful statistic. Things sound like they're way worse Adrian case.

But % tested also meaningful statistic, especially expect people tested. usually lot cased around people know about. sure fairest immigrants setup like that. 

It doesn’t change amount units available amount people need homes. Well, might actually reduce number homes available, let’s say right doesn’t that.

All change way decide gets willing able pay, family member able move on, keep name mailbox, allow squat illegally, hookup like that.

It leaves immigrants exposed unscrupulous sublets without legal protections tenants normally have. Protecting tenants contracts good thing mean.. technically, suggest injecting disinfectant. make said less stupid, though. asked medical professional something could look doing, thought 'interesting'. mean.. really nothing verbal diarrhea anyway, moron trying look intelligent failing oh hard. 

 ""And see disinfectant, knocks one minute. way something like that, injection inside almost cleaning, see gets lungs tremendous number lungs, it’d interesting check that, you’re going use medical doctors with, sounds interesting me. So, we’ll see, whole concept light, way kills one minute. That’s pretty powerful ""

But also want point Trump made comment, accidental poisonings disinfectant bleach went two months. May may related, worth pointing out. Ah yes, elementary kids well known following guidance school! 😂 Easter Monday holiday almost places. Good Friday obviously Friday also lot people pathologically empathetic want everyone caring everyone else time. Yeah what? think misunderstood I’m saying. 

I said vaccines CAUSE herd immunity. course that’s get herd immunity. said we’ve never achieved herd immunity, have. viruses we’ve exiled vaccines exiled precisely achieved herd immunity them. 

What point trying prove sending link supports exactly I’m saying you? Lol Basically, wrong impression, simple that. younger reasonably healthy people, virus dangerous all. Hey, students supposed graduate college can't play football? Virus turns liberal: Hold beer. calling Sweden's success ""lucky"" actual argument? shoud wear mask, except home, alone family members separated space indoors, eating something. IN: Man covid saved covid death polar bear. Oh boy. country . choice. want get cheap bike local Walmart since Target completely sold adult bikes area. Anyway, Walmart area employees infect COVID-19 amount douche weasels support Incompetent One (aka Orange Shit Gibbon) go prevented obtaining bike use kids.

Long story short, can't get cheap bike ride kids, Walmart attracts certain individuals sharpest tools shed. considered perhaps setting insulin catapult?

But want launch 90kg insulin 300 meters? real lockdown, testing contact tracing, means long lockdown necessary. See: New Zealand.  


Long ""lockdowns"", country actually practiced yet, half assed efforts countries like US UK demonstrably count, best slow spread bit also damaging economy.  


And work, done early wave must include two actions else starving economy waiting virus ""go away"". work school psychologist starting week. school taking lot precautions wear masks unless eating break periods. kn95 mask unsure protect off. office window it’s buildings ventilation system I’m sure isn’t best one needs be. Obviously take eat certain times. anything ensure air office clean possible? keep wondering I’m erasing safety precautions taking even office... tips? Thanks! Seriously. countries make masks public places mandatory. thought Philippines longest lockdown world? We've locked since mid March. Good. Keep lousy people away countries. isn’t chickenpox “strategy” appears coming chickenpox. Vulnerable old people isolate themselves. other, particular young, go lives. there's New Zealand...even new cluster infections, NZ shown properly applied lockdown *best* way deal pandemic. cluster appears rapidly dwindling.

So Argentina shows irrefutable evidence, nothing efficacy lockdown. What's big difference Argentina New Zealand? I'm sure many, one stands is:

**New Zealanders trust government follow instructions.**

A poll showed 88% NZers trusted government make right decisions virus. surprise, then, followed instructions.

I can't find comparable poll Argentina, Pew Research showed 20% Argentinians believe government benefits everyone.

So government may made right call Argentina, matter people trust government enough follow instructions.

Lockdowns also effective South Korea, another country trust government adherence instruction high. look deeper South Korea's big infections, came religious institutions highly critical liberal regime and, recently, knowingly flouted safety guidelines protest call overreach power government.

In words, people make lockdown effective not, people trust leaders, listen. Man, Mexico keeps sounding better better. bet used captchas often, half reddit would cease active. that's excuse poor handling elderly care on, explains high numbers.

Actually low 2019 numbers explain it. So.. understand point correctly: given room major news papers, prime time television time prime time radio coverage popular radio show country, weeks guest get hour speak heart, thrown society?

And make people country dissagrees public recommendations still somehow social society? somehow kick out? Please help here.. actual arguments? intensivist friend told yesterday worried reinfection occur inside 6 months lung damage cause extremely high mortality. also said he’s suspected reinfection several patients didn’t data support tests done. Watch out, Alex Jones show talking cancel culture. main reason people US force citizens pay taxes back US regardless world. earn certain amount (70k/yr think). way get renounce citizenship. It’s pretty fucked. countries don’t this. I’m sure ultra rich workaround middle-class gon get fucked. USA: Hold beer. many lies us time refute research, win same. need proof rebut, need double another lie. can’t believe 100+ people went smash mouth show ""second wave"" US similar well. Confirmed cases 3x higher deaths half high. Raw cases terrible metric, positivity rate hospitalizations much better. Come Maryland. Lots masks wearing people here. Went running dogs 50% people outside wearing masks. I'm excited! Hopefully yields positive results. long people they're conducting trials willing, not! one serious migraine. world never locked like year. Suicides up, deaths due missed treatments poverty, inequality evictions rise. meta analysis includes studies varying levels protective talking masks. (Specifically referencing home made masks) entire suite report seems reference n95 surgical masks. (per post)

Examples:

""meta-analysis ten randomised trials evaluating face mask use versus face mask use ""

""meta-analyses reinterpret efficacy N95 respirators versus medical masks""

So, think previous post correct. 

Perhaps cite section states otherwise? would swear 50% chance roll natural 1 regardless dice used. Good move. totally agree, good see new advice let kids go school sick. often go doctor, insist check-ups? people early diabetes early hypertension dont even know it. know I'm pretty stubborn going doctor, I'm side! It’s like Toronto? Seoul places made thing? America's response also look pretty good see successfully avoided overwhelming hospitals stated goal start thing?   Salty Westerners salty Westerners. sad. Mankind work together beat virus. Westerners dont want see reality goes inflated egos. 
They still wanna believe true emperors world even cannot keep societies first world standard without imports China. shame neither candidate wants UHC. Shame left. shame shame shame. Oh frickin *LORD*, still baffles much people look wanting safe items safe uncontaminated. Like okay one likes confrontation, someone told sanitize hands I’d feel little taken aback, certainly wouldn’t look like they’re idiot. Especially I’m working job customer king part. rare union job work government States, closest thing get many Europeans take granted.

It's main reason refuse leave current job. make lot private sector, lack time spend family absurdly poor healthcare coverage want work unless choice. Arizona's mask mandate came July 17th. People's behavior presumably also changed - people cautious (or ones weren't, simply got infected currently immune), see decline cases. That's good news, necessarily permanent. get less than$100 eligible $300. [What everyone Florida needs know schools states paying it. FEMA funds. states paying additional $100. however pay updating computer systems yet again. ridiculous. Germany dictatorship right now.. accuse Belarus ""15 years power"" Angela Merkel already imprisoning people protesting measures calling ""extremists"" okay arrest them. 
The government starting lie indexes well. headline makes think Corona good economy. Yikes. Masks uncomfortable absolutely effect people's choices amount time spend store, want gather large crowds, use mass transit, etc. huge impact economy. said exact thing many times. think stupid can't see though crap. year? that's really good comparison. Canada here. self employed diagnosed prostate cancer. two kids at-home wife, would probably brought us bankruptcy, even free healthcare. client made deal: become employee, pay sick leave start, promise stay least 2 years us. Surgery convalescence went OK. 3 years I'm still working there.


When people talk culture difference, that's mean. like Federal Government shows signs brains. high death counts, remember Sweden extreamly low death count last year, largly mild influensa season. 2019 lowest death count since 1977, use per capita lowest ever recorded. data goes back 1749 back lot young children died think say lowest death per capita ever.

While that's excuse poor handling elderly care on, explains high numbers. care. war virus enemy. war ask expensive victory be.  r/subsiwishifellfor Wow, can't believe two places 200 million cases, assume idk release numbers. later, see still freedom understand it. Instead, Swedes interiorize norms rituals act free. country famous so-called consensus culture, people generally begin agreement rather ending there. argued Boston Review characterizes organicist society, individual choice public choice perfectly overlap dissent expelled; twenty eminent scientists publish editorial Swedish approach one country’s two flagship newspapers almost impact public debate policy.

This really shows massive issue Sweden country. *really* democratic. disagree establishment thrown society socially.

Its comparable something like China. Absolutley horrifying. allowed EU mean like 5+ different candidate vaccines right late stage trials literally look promising. would presume say definitely safe effective vaccine soon, would say it’s equally unreasonable seriously doubt vaccine it’s never done before. large amount current evidence it’s likely going done. point. bible, people pick choose. shows outlandish unnecessary religion is. literally nothing. Lol pathetic ass-mad article. Ok cool. anti-maskers make service workers lives hell US move Poland then.  2% confirmed multiply 10 actual number stations, grocery stores, open

Did *anyone* close gas stations grocery stores? Admittedly travel restrictions place one said ""You're eating getting gas."" think one better... sort sexual dysfunction symptom, even dumbass President would mask on.

But explosive diarrhea would definitely problem. Unfortunately lot people think it’s hoax, would someone wouldn’t get it, get negatively effects nothing life. live (EU), final trial reports submitted authorities within one year last data entry (even case substance tested met efficacy/safety target, i. e. failed proceed next stage testing). timelines trials conducted US might different, analysis thus definitely completed well year.

Accordingly, July 2014, result-related information posted within one year (6 months paediatric trials) end clinical trial2. "" (Source: ) You’re missing point. parent, choice. cannot force send kids classrooms pandemic. lot us parents would sacrifice income safety children. social media comment change this. 

Also keep mind bulk us parents school aged children survived Great Recession. know sacrifice. assholes send us money pay bills? search keywords 'korea', 'second wave', 'increasing' would 100 news since beginning pandemic. pushed. mental health “help” got I’m talking about.

League City rife people believing virus. 

It’s whole Clear Lake area, straight way Pasadena.  good explainer. right *primary* goal phase 3 data efficacy determined via statistical analysis. normally get far already promise phase 1/2 safety data. simply pointing secondary purpose phase 3 sample size rigorously uncover rarer reactions quantify side effects may statistical significance phase 1/2 data. shitty jobs. Remember people thought climate change plastic pollution biggest problems facing society? turtle straw nose? Ah, good times. mean anywhere US? swear people completely forgotten get sick, even really sick, fucking corona. Yes, susan, realize “so sick” December (which usually means moderate fever days, sore throat maybe puking) likely flu another common bug. COVID ailment makes feel crappy. economy screwed either way I'm going one goes way order food restaurants. Regarding school, I'm college town, I'm overly concerned local economy. problem coworkers work effectively kids. That's problem going harder time working, possibly kids dying. want kids school, that's choice would force that.

Grover Norquist wanted recreate McKinley administration trade did. plagues, grinding poverty, police murdering people streets... real scam would sending kids school. Option 4: Move back parents.

It sounds like shitty South Park joke guy move parent's basement, increasingly common. Rising rent prices lower salaries (to say nothing *buying* home) making reality nearly decade now. fair, anecdotes also shit rhetorics debates. schools re-opening, interesting see trend holds.

Highly doubtful, hope. Guess year good year work Labor Day weekend along Memorial Day weekend 4th July weekend. fucking bullshit virus contagious, kill attacking lungs heart, even survive, might still lifelong heart problems. Jfc, enough enough. People already jumping en masse Facebook, claiming COVID-19 caused 9,000 deaths.

It’s quite honestly one infuriating things I’ve seen entire pandemic. want bash fucking face desk. 

Scientific data nowhere NEAR stupid general population. People uneducated, biased, ignorant. 

Also, simply means 94% people died virus comorbidity. means cancer, heart disease, lupus. fucking dare people say things like, “Why shut country people would died anyways?!”

What born lupus, mom cancer, sister born without immune system. would leave die?

Fuck country. Fuck CDC. Fuck average uneducated person twists data ignorance. I’m science, don’t know anymore. one believes it. There's moose loose follow. That's like suggesting patients decide what's rational medicine hospital patients. Spain ground zero Spanish flu

Small correction. ""Ground Zero"" first noticed documented French colonies SE Asia pre-WW1. virus empire? mean biggest failure federal government since 1918 bring pandemic control? unrealistic want deaths sickness pandemic. equivalent saying ""I want nobody live poverty"". expected Political testing exposure help stave funeral?

There's much way early treatment. like never left! link says died lung damage COVID, weakened immune system contributed. Also, comorbidities listed 160K, 18K ischemic heart disease 26K diabetes time least Joke state. Texas like California. blows over

wishful thinking I'm afraid No. Exactly reason corrupt government US control healthcare. countries healthcare highly regulated considerable governmental control. Heck, many countries government healthcare provider. work better US doing. Honestly can't bring care. work classroom see hundred kids day. Whatever happens, happens. point seems there's nothing COVID can't do. guarantee lot people statistically good chance dying time frame anyways. 

Let's see I’ve even explain people aren’t right wing conspiracy theorists. It’s seriously misleading damaging.  Get shit together, America.

you really believe happen..? worked Pasco years ago! invest. Quit bitching start buying. Holy shit, that's right. WOW, healthcare, president, even post office... quite telling author highlights trust citizens government something unfathomable, unimaginable, something *bad*.

That's pretty typical people grew in, formed low-trust society. have, think citizens always forced, always told coerced right thing, absolutely cannot right thing themselves.

Which sad.

Maybe author spend time Sweden, high-trust society, could learn appreciate benefits brings. plenty examples total fools positions power around world moment, tbh would contact local health authority would advise services help: testing, no-contact delivery essentials quarantine, etc. someone credibly exposed, almost certainly tested quickly without charge. course, depends local health authority. Yes am, school students child can't overcome missing school minor amounts time like says lot parents, maybe child.  No, I’m really interested talking them. They’re still pretending week week basis school going open again. don’t think head right place. deaths California. California 33% population.

Quite success story. 🙄 I’m talking medical grade masks. I’m talking regular cloth masks using right now. many studies effective different types cloth material preventing droplets. effective. Even covering face used tshirt better anything all. studies early SARA-cov outbreak China 2003. early narrative right wrong. we're really locked down. tell, gyms and/or bars completely closed. Cov-id Goat F#&amp;ker ""Very easy"" get 45+ million people quit smoking? can't even get everybody wear masks. want guy do? Disclose classified info early day herd immunity policies objective speed infection? sure, testing via PCR often produces false positives negatives. really affect anything talking about, even remotely, though. layperson understand statistically account this, sure see seems scary. keep posting random shit though acting like counters fact based arguments. need single test, like countries done, confirm positive tests. Nice try Trumpie, Wuhan much prepared handling pandemic US. Yeah did. New Zealanders returning overseas mandatory isolation centres community. Easy test America, high rate infection. UV-C laser pointers strapped onto wings bleach cruise missiles. point? Hopefully, NFL won’t clustered. understand people use book big metaphor good morales life lessons. way beautiful story. 
 Maybe im ignorant ive yet see people use christianity crutch, way indoctrinate children, something beg instead creating self change, reason live life fullest looming idea hell. guess bad apples christianity ruin everyone else. crusades countless fights, terrible toture faced, child molestation remains run rampant, luxury people catholic church provided followers tithes. day people still kill name god. 
 ive seen religion. tainted history abuse. divider everybody. dont need orgin story good morales. work hard strive goals. Children told raised way believe thats see. 
 Maybe im wrong. Human nature may always lead us point. end species likely everything else. Sometimes think believe could start right world would different. Everyone could work towards one goal. betterment things. it’s going effect poor people developing nations. virus what’s going effect people first world countries   Yet going New York weekend trip quite common Europe. Heck, time weekend NY flight hotel cheaper days Mediterranean. It’s important understand “rushed” even means context covid vaccine. 

When look vaccine typically developed, it’s done “waterfall.” First step A, B, C.

It’s done way limit amount resources personnel required one time. net effect takes longer vaccine go Z.

The covid vaccine parallelized. done simultaneously B C. easily possible. C doesn’t need B completed first. never did. 

Pharma companies able *all* resources reallocated dedicated it. net effect vaccine arrive quickly. 

No steps eliminated, corners cut. big thing wearing mask street. become norm NYC feel contributes scary, false fear outdoor transmission widespread fact essentially zero. pandemic gone far long accept unscientific restrictions.

Disagree IFR thing though. always knew missing cases early meaning IFR always going lower initially reported. No, cause death. Merely not, way, mean killed you. still die completely independent covid, even Covid shot death doesn’t make Covid cause death though

Having covid stroke also make covid cause death. mere existence body mean killed you, even contributes death. Schools also reward teachers perfect attendance! encouraged come work sick same. good anyone. Science = bad didn’t see partner first three months terrified, feels like biggest overreaction I’ve ever allowed life. I’m still mostly staying home (I see outside household) wow really need make suffer much. Thank do. Also don’t want bring illness home family either. said, distance learning way superior classroom instruction especially k-5 age range. High school possibly junior high may arguable kids elementary school attention span focus virtual 8 hour school day. addition, special needs children likely never able progress distance learning depending severity handicap. district zoom session last week 120 parents on. exact concern brought meeting. superintendent answered year things different end truancy concerns parents call child's absence.

Has specific question brought District? state school middle big metro area. tons commuter students. agree everything said, though would add wearing masks social distancing possible, particularly enclosed spaces.... Okay forgive you, human body mindbogglingly complicated average layperson can't hope wrap head around complicated interactions long term adverse effects seemingly mild acute illness presentation.


But mean impossible happening COVID. take years rigorous research fully grasp going tease actual COVID-caused long term consequences. better maintain awareness findings take prudent steps protect clearly understand disease. much else layperson _can_ point. Lmfao understand immune system works all? course died Covid. immune system strong enough fight off. Simple that. dealing cardiovascular disease, diabetes anything deteriorates health COURSE sicker. That's 10 years ago got cold. period 24 hours felt move throat ears nose finally chest. round tests reveled pericarditis, cold virus hit heart. mid 20s, scary situation took year recover from. sounds suspiciously like ""governing"" chose one? 0-9 days seems like healthy in-between (no pun intended). Excess death literally definition number people would still alive regular year.

And excess death already 250k, Fauci already understating numbers benifit 10 days lol poor baby! 


/s Australia deaths, definitely include deaths positive case certain Nuh uh, totally strategy - test. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Legit question.....

Anyone else now? believe vaccines - get flu shots every year, children fully vaccinated.

I take vaccine trump rammed order look like hero election day. way. how. downplay anything besides excessive risk perception? prioritized people protect illness, you’re going start 40 year olds. hehehehe ‘03 here. Lol it’s old-ass high school reunion. ""Minimize mortality morbidity population.""
If goal failed miserably. 

What linked general pandemy plan Covid listen Johan Carlson press conference March 6 say: ""it pandemy deal with"". 
So use plan minimized mortality morbidity? 

Or think 5800 dead million infected ""minimization"" mortality listen Johan medical system Venezuela works great multi millionaire. old something? not, excess death already quarter million. kids die worked details? Parents die? Teachers get sick die? Asymptomatic transmission vectors? Long term organ nervous damage? okay you? good plans remote learning (including teaching teachers teach). good plans even hope in-person learning. We've wasted summer school districts. 

Let's clear - major reason opening schools day care, learning. sad. Sad children, sad economy, sad future. '06 bit me. yeah...I saw felt die little inside  I’m old school didn’t exist high school 😂 I’m bummed, y’all amazing pool use shitty Creek one. speak someone nearly impossible task finding rental unit new city rent control. easy feat. frustrating tenant system.  Years ago volunteer writer advocacy group. used say leaders ""Tell point want make, I'll find/manipulate stats support point"" Yeah! 2 child policy now! companies calling folks back, it’s them. well, you’ll expected wear mask setting. ideal even congregate again, won’t like flu season 2018/19 went work. would best WFH situation remedied, instances won’t happening, won’t go back situation allows flu spread.  near impossible America eradicate virus. stay around common flu. remain shut flying rest world years come.

Uh... near impossible country eradicate virus. going endemic countries. That's nature virus. 

The US remain ""shut off"" (as much is) rest world vaccine wide use world wide.  Probably sometime 2022 last restrictions removed, maybe earlier. 

World wide control virus established vaccines better screening. going scenario virus endemic everywhere world needs stay healthy keep americans out. work way. ""Reports"" &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; assumes background death rate left untouched isolation, economic change, diseases dwindling, etc. strong assumption. death cult going defend death bitter end. *cries schools reopened* waiting Trump start another gofundme rip followers 369 deaths day haha comical example cherry picking data. Anyone see chart deaths per day follows pattern lower like 350-450 jumps 1200 per day. pattern repeats again, different levels severity, literally entire pandemic. ex right wing prime minister criticizing current right wing prime minister? 

🍿 Look encephalitis lethargica spanish flu. Crippled millions America: Observe... Sounds like something thought starting classes middle pandemic. Utterly irresponsible plan place case outbreak knew going happen. People fearing death vaccines established since decades, fatality rates long term effects well known.

With novel vaccine rushed out, figures fairly unknown, surprise people, including pro-vaxxers, lot cautious here.

I know possible long-term health problems yet see study showing incidence severity. anecdotal now. I'm denying severe cases typically take long recovery time. Pocket Maximum theoretical, practice insurance companies fuck course do.

So say car crash, load hospital time &amp; surgeries, bill goes OOPM. pay $15k whatever. bills keep coming anyway. There's another one $3k x-rays insurance covers x-rays broken bones, broken bones right side (insurance covers x-rays), left side insurance says that's medically unnecessary count toward OOPM. Another one doctors came see take insurance, insurance pay get another $5k bill. apparently anesthesia got surgery covered... all? Like insurance wanted bite belt instead? that's another $8k. Oh, insurance cover physical therapy need walk again. Oops! Haha. Hope extra $200/wk that, count OOPM covered. $2k hole sessions already have, hey, know can't afford walk get worse debt trying.

You suspect lot horse shit insurance legally pay, ribs still broken still ton pain. many hours phone them, many letters, many appeals, stumble morphine haze, give up? boss also told (found coworkers), boss also extremely anti-mask worried even try report it. stressful know I'm even supposed do. Absolutely, especially since lack unified policy nationwide. 50 different states, 50 different levels response. makes sense would 50 different results. opinion 10-15 percent survivors going permanently disabled way horrific scientific community media focused never issues whole life 

I see Dr anytime want  Latest rumor Nebraska, Iowa, OSU voted play. assume PSU close, based public comments.  Michigan wanted avoid losing OSU again. Why, schools open rest China months. Lol enjoy getting gouged cuz misguided patriotism They've school almost 6 months already. basis say year most? even testing vaccines kids yet I’m happy NYC test country here. Oh sweet summer child lol US passed ages ago excess deaths. Sweden counts deaths accurately thinking articles came ""Peru everything right still..."". one thing say locking down, another thing actually lock down. China managed troops streets, South Africa much. really like Peru, people ignoring it? guess work eat, takes priority. Maybe covids case, I’m general children get sick dirty builds good immune system.

Being overtly protective kids creates massive problems later life allergies. first recorded Trancer history came doctors saying true though? hospital lie me?  could delay month even plans better place. That’s really great way frame church pedophilia. Thoroughly enjoyed. know, happening. Again, ""winging it""

Whats good goose, good gander

Leadership sets example. I'm genuinely curious... logic behind kind thing? I'm reading articles every day say something effect people contract covid establishment, going notify people. 0.005%. inward turning America lead Euro-Asian economic partnership. balance power partnership rest Asia. European population ages, they'll find debt Asian partners, forced compromise liberal values. 

The great advantage held US have, domestically, every necesary economic input. modern country exist autarky. advantage prove invaluable age deglobalization emerges. "" we're gonna get it"" attitude seems pervasive now. total resignation fate horrible death name Lord Orange. sooo hard tell days..... :)  know. loan *is* lease. it. Financing car rent-to-own type deal. Good dealer, bad you. Believe there's countries USA sure mean exactly, talking ""new infections"" testing. Denmark one countries tests world, undoubtedly benefiting pharmaceutical industry that. even danish scientists commenting ""testing sake testing"" waste resources. Anti-vaxxers flat earthers medical science. Hugely confident functionally absurd conspiracy theories. You’re weak selfish. kids school couple months, year most. think 'extremely negative consequences' - barely remember elementary school days lack /s threw groups/politicians quote Covid death stats, discriminate primary secondary causes delayed vaccine eventually good rushed vaccine forever bad. IIRC, chinese news April says expensive COVID bill China bout 120k USD (it paid government anyway) US currently catching projected worse Sweden 6 days 4,411 Americans dead. yeah teachers parents kids? dumb plain simple headline could March NYC closing schools ended dozens dead educators.  let get straight: praises China it’s response essentially, “lock things”. saying half-measures ok people live it? ask everyone talk quietly. Everyone option keep kid home 100% remote learning NYC. Ask mind shaving 20 years life reason think ? Personally don't. tax collected state little tourism cover medical expenses coming weeks/months. think mistake allow tourists 2020.  sucks recovered got covid tho, really hope feels better. Nah mate, know UN prosecute twice limited evidence 2009 mentioned 2019. Yes investigated closely. $1200 check ain't enough 40+ million people unemployed. Interesting question anglo-argentinian filmmaker attended briefing (documentary maker, normal media, english) : 0.1% fatality rate absolutely unheard of. Even Polio incident mentioned link, basis disaster vaccination trails, death rate seems 0.00005% (10 200,000 uses). believe mandatory, required enter business open public public school.

So mandatory? LMFAO comparing cases per day it’s relevant remember Sweden test 6,5 x less Denmark. 

Week 34:

Dk: 236.115 tests = 4.071/100.000

Se: 65.546 tests = 636/100.000 Yeah, things would killed them. caught flu died, died flu. pneumonia, would died pneumonia. difficult concept. America keep losing wars? Numbers state secret. virus enemy them, analogous response would take flamethrowers every inch facilities. comment people wear masks time future. need response going happen.

If want wear mask rest society won't. so? deaths COVID primary cause comorbidity counted CDC table. However, 95% list primary cause. think valid concern. I'm means vaccinations. wife work healthcare. I've personally given thousands flu shots career many vaccines. rush concerning. understand need expedite given current threat we're taking skipping important steps put place reason ensure something safe mass production use. cause least little bit concern hesitation. kid 0.01% chance dying covid. think million things carry similar risk let kids every day without thinking twice. Florida cut “retail recreation” 8 percent national average. comparing national average even within USA, FLA gotten bad rep. country similar situation, i'll bite

large underground/shadow economy means people work anyway, they're poor support themselves

high population density, cramped living space

a lot shit works first world countries keep people inside work poor nations. sub parrots ""pay people stay indoors"". tried that, 3/4 country bank account postal service speak of. end huge crowds stuck literal bread lines, negating lockdown anyway

corruption (funds used ""virus-proof"" places plastic screens disappear) care put profits ahead student health. young people playing football campus going home hanging friends, working whatever anyways risk developing myocardiatis lasting side-effects. home however testing protocol 3x-weekly access world class medical facilities immediately isolate treat cases. friend's son could easily caught COVID class, pizza shop, 7/11 grocery store. that. country like New Zealand, first world country, excellent healthcare, high proportion populace working formal economy, good access kind services, answer better full lockdown country like Argentina. Latin America lot people work informally, contracts social security, live day day trying earn enough money survive. can't respect full lockdown they'd starve so. 

In New Zealand government resources help people situation, government that's willing so, political system ready situations like that. Argentina government enough money help everyone needs it. There's lot corruption petty fights gets credit, means people receive much aid need, do, always enough late make difference. people survive have, help relatives neighbors, knowing can't expect much government. case Latin America. Many high schools also heading towards in-person classes here. Like one teach at. stupid. That’s thing statistics (numbers generally), always characterized support different arguments. I’d argue long article doesn’t flip raw numbers percentages nonchalantly it’s honest depiction. percentages tend straightforward, comes rate transmission covid pick one that’s scariest. 

You’re right, 152 isn’t scary, use percent total population puts perspective fast spreading risk spread. 803 less 1% using % doesn’t emphasize what’s really stake, especially exponential growth. much dangerous community 6.5% wouldn’t get percentages. It’s context matters. 

There post FB comparing US “shutdown” previous diseases things. says:

1918 - Spanish Flu killed 55 million
2020 - Covid kills 150,000 shut country. 

This would absolutely consider dishonest use numbers. First, fails mention Spanish flu 3 years worldwide deaths compares 5 months covid deaths makes look like lasted one year. Further, covid count us numbers. 3 years Spanish flu roughly 675k people US died. US already roughly 1/3 way raw number deaths even though much advanced care back then. 

I haven’t called person posted yet post leaves space change goal posts: covid count exaggerated, population much higher today, it’s flu, Democrat hoax, save children, 800,000 kids go missing every year (not related group people always changes conversation it’s trump card). 

That’s 2 cents. don’t disagree point though wanted justify reasons do. Bavarian checking in. weren’t even allowed see anyone outside household. run premier. pay leave work. I'm referring loss wages 3 weeks. 2 weeks paid time per year. quite ill long ago used up. impossible live life without risk. Thinking otherwise shortsighted used converse online American lived couple hours Canadian border. proud - actually proud - never left US reason. alone. [Are looking different deaths rise since early July point vaccines probably required enroll child school. don’t understand rush get kids back classroom. It’s absolute cluster fuck parts country. live CA governor forced schools go online. child doesn’t like it, least know he’s still alive. missing point. argument hinges idea someone *might* transmit virus someone else, thus resulting letters death.

 cold flu same.

In fact, infectious disease can. 

So logic ""dont X avoid transmitting disease"" logic applies infectious disease ever. 

And incredibly unrealistic ill chip here. academic work solid stuff postmodern neo-Marxism strawman flawed (though bad faith). JP attributes lot understanding philosophy, including Marx, Kant, Nietzsche, coming Explaining Postmodernism Stephen Hicks (a book JP recommends). look book want, pretty terrible.  


This coming former Jordan Peterson fan. became disillusioned JP started reading texts Hobbes, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Marx, Nietzsche instead watching youtube videos. 


JP often offer good advice wisdom really understand views left postmodern neo-Marxism substantiated academic work political views.  trusted numbers since Fat Donnie claimed 239lb.  Says Russian news? Swedish negative deaths would like disagree. *is* zombie apocalypse. don't, family Tampa, good hear mask use becoming common, really good. That’s sound policy 187k August 31 America real bad time tests like that, historically speaking. They've historically used disenfranchise minorities poor.  DeSantis going 'let die' plan governance. wonder defense reckoning comes. Nov/Dec timeframe probably healthcare workers first. comes vulnerable Jan/Feb (Maybe they'll mix IDK). precisely able get one March soonest. plan along ever since vaccine timeline started come together.

There 16 million heath care workers 500x amount people received vaccine phase 3. Good call. Currently 187k dead. think lot approval rating valid context fear left. think thing true unexpectedly 2016. Otherwise sane people voted fears like SCOTUS selection deep seated hate HRC. think chances winning Nov also increased extreme left seems. JB better chance ever recent speeches seemed statesmanlike quality them. People drawn that. American right border spent whatever free time could awesome country amazing people I've ever met, respectfully agree.

I really, really miss Canadaland. r/titleofyourporn people need held criminally responsible endangering public's well being. I'm protesting, straight dangerous. Plus counter productive, therefore waste time participate in. It’s six months untold surprises us. case, American, one saddest disturbing surprises catastrophic response USA. 
Still can’t believe country excelled things century going disaster. u astonished ?  Haters would say propaganda. So, Ministry Health longer giving report Sunday. Instead, releasing every Monday.

So yesterday had:

* \+847 cases (43 without test) \[40546 total\]
* \+233 recovered (15970 total)
* \+11 deaths (429 total)
* 450 hospitalizations
  * 142 ICU. think major misunderstanding death certificates filled out. Say perfectly healthy young person ends dying Covid (rare impossible). body fights virus long time. hospitalized weeks, develop pneumonia, stroke, get sepsis. comorbidities also listed death certificate along Covid. didn’t happen stoke also Covid. died complications due Covid. flu many deaths also counted. 
My dad died aggressive cancer. Towards end life, many issues come (organ failure, stroke, etc.). things hastened death, occurred cancer. always interesting read headline actually read study. anti mask anything....But whole premise study seems little ridiculous come say ""mask wearers dramatically less likely get severe case""...they probably are...but theres many variables see draw meaningful conclusions it. spot on, say #1 bit misinformation hear anti-maskers material doesn’t “filter out” tiny virus particles therefore “cannot” work. least tests particular aspect puts bed quite throughly... they’re likely care. Whoops, thanks I'm sure missed that. surprising since that's exactly February. problem, know sheltered generation pussies try occasionally share knowledge hopes gain small level self awareness perspective. Good know [able help one fair, US #1 ... coronavirus cases lol know badly got it? now? Ehhhh. can’t tell private business keep paying someone isn’t working, time bottom lines important ever. 

A better solution temporary UBI. could *only* free money could done six months still spent less current bills have. 

Consumer confidence would high people would willing spend, rather start suddenly building personal war chests. it’s spammed needs debunked here.

This shit got spilled, need mop bucket.    York well. involved lol Police love right wing terrorists. Unfortunately, stupidity often confused freedom... must lot older me, definitely remember that.

I remember Reagan saying said things knew untrue, believed heart true. data pre-existing conditions. 
It’s data comorbidities.

You misinterpreting. Lmao aged well little sheep Source that? going manage pandemic certainly next year, certainly may planning longer term next two three years vaccine may play role,” said Tam, whose comments come new polling suggests wary potential Njoo, deputy chief public health officer, offered similar words might think get vaccine everything goes back normal way before. That’s case,” measures we’ve put place still continue new reality quite COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed Moderna Inc. BioNTech Pfizer Inc. require stringent standards refrigeration, may hamper distributed hundreds millions Americans expecting receive company said Monday vaccine, work safe, would available Canadians early second quarter 2021. allow two partners produce millions doses 2020, would increased hundreds millions scale ""pre-orders"" vaccines near 1-2 billion doses, regardless companies promises deliver millions early 2021, reality production limited. started producing yet new facilities, they're building infra-structure production. commissioning mega plants takes lot time, need certify new production rout produces quality smaller production units. 

The hundreds millions doses might actually still fall short necessary billions doses necessary. it, 2 hundred million, 5 hundred million? that's even US EU combined. 

I want Debby downer, fact is, might even enough river sand glass vials necessary store vaccine ready 2021. going take time, people frenetically working bring vaccines fast possible market, infrastructure built. want take away hard work people putting this, vaccine deployment usually slow process.

We start vaccinating 2021, risk winter, rest starting Q2 supply comes in. It'll take months effectively deploy. turns vaccine requires booster it'll take longer. know requires booster well 2021 continue track received clinical trial summer/fall. going take years unlearn. I’m glad I’m happily relationship can’t imagine must trying find mate right mow thought public exposure one reasons people went Wreck Beach first place.. reasonably common people household, even spouses, one person infected other. I've seen numbers around 30% spouses getting infected, variation exact numbers literature Moving US, one biggest culture shocks had. Parks US opening hours. Parks US closed. Swede, completely unthinkable, makes absolutely zero sense. Nature *right there* whether like not! problem money insurance source claim ""Vitamin nothing immune system"". going engage honest debate keep opinions yourself. added nothing conversation. far confirmation bias, find one source reputable makes claim Vitamin aid growth maintenance immune system please source look it. want research find something counter argument go ahead I'm ears.  Honestly, wonder \[the non-Qanon-type people\] west become mask-wearing culture like many east asian cultures. [China started big time around example. Frankly, I'm planning continuing wear mask feeling ill long COVID passes. really 'radical right' leader 90% party approval says stuff like rates roof--why Obama administration something doctor-inflicted autism. lose nothing try. - Donald @jamandatrtl #vaccines #Shills insist #Autism starts utero genetic, parents insist sudden onset #vaccine"" - Donald Trump Trick already got late January. Big brain. I’m seriously starting question whether world better place without USA. breaks heart. Civilian control. Soldier control. Battlefield control.

War...has changed Beg pardon? get importance public schools, make points:

They starting find possible get sick Covid (though think 4 cases far), possible spread symptomatic...say students, friends, randos grocery store.

I doubt many teacher prepared prepared. Teachers expected everything time dime, decisions school plans made close open--I blame confusion. help week open non stop trainings everything needed (for part) instead lesson planning. also young, care parents in-laws, mention long term effects mild cases feels like gamble willing take.

I'm lucky though. found job quickly love doing, money great, play Plague Inc life. 102% covid death! Looks like fooled addition. Semantc. Systematic. Political. Economic. real disease causing excessive deaths year. see balance next three five, seeing affects mostly older comorbidity. Sweden pretty terrible way handing whole thing, though. initial strategy pretty much get everyone sick fast get immune. Remember Trump said gonna Easter US 2000 deaths do.know. pandemic killed lot people, nobody alternative explanation uttetly ridiculous face. Mark words soon Biden becomes president, excess deaths one popular right wing terms. USA, medical schools call student ""gunner"" spend every shred energy getting best scores. think lot ""gunners"" campus. 
Edit grammar. Well shit, random Karen says science flawed, somebody call professionals design run experiments professionally tell suck. Also, study show all! would trust first place they’re easily swayed politics? 

How suppose actually happened quickly? massive staff turnover? walk laboratories handing big checks?

Idk...sounds like lotta scientists silence. people laugh, tell got* virus trying keep safe. Watch quickly respect personal space.

*you might it, all, even know it. Right now. right sir! around 0.5% infected die. know serious disease, I’m afraid of. One joys life good smells food/drinks. happen idk might lose it. Better take long test drive option wait 10yrs. decide. WHAT! WAY! think we’re lucky diff president using defense production act things might turn around end 2021. sure that. go record saying think two things causing excess deaths aren’t covid.
 Like said, don’t know everything yet.

And didn’t see anything like Great Recession. could recession. water fluoridation stuff latest conspiracy theory made lose faith humanity little bit. nothing politics though right mods? long gets removed ""too political""? surprised many people went Mexico care borders closed! Maybe mental fitness test. history test. Almost like new citizens take test immigrating US. I'd willing bet even know government works constitution average American point. No, fan. Looking name feel like Chevy Chase fan.  Looks like Alf baffles even said people somehow okay told work daily basis like slaves yet cannot bothered told something SIMPLE wear fucking mask. 

Some people truly make sick beyond belief. That’s good hear. New York share wealth they’re succeeding safety aspect stage 3 testing complete rest stage 3, case see bad thing level deployment. work we'll wait another vaccine big loss work gains weeks. ""Remember time found suspicious lump, asked accountant opinion/advice..."" ""Ahhh...No..."" ""Yeah...that sound little silly mention it..."" least many Americans think lot things better Canada they’re wrong too. No. think anyone restrictions voting. creates disenfranchisement. want people unrepresented? 🤣 Actually doesn't, unless covid-19 made several different substrains (with different severity symptoms).

If get large amount virus (compared small one) tiny bit ahead virus replication. Defeat. Contain. Eradicate. Like smallpox polio. people spreading virus, dies. Nah definitely conspiracy. proof so....  Ventilation probably 100 times important decontamination. know can't handle ventilation issue decontamination able say ""we something"".  leftist become anti vaxers. timeline keeps getting better better. thing is, want argue 10k died covid, explain 190k died pneumonia influenza year, waaaay 2x normal amount  lock behind bars? Evidence pretty clear. 

*looks bodies. sure downvoted. question too. Take upvote!  first phase would cover 15% population, group said. 

That right there, along previous infections, basically ""open up"" cities travel them. Well considering 2019 sold nearly 45,000 season tickets, certainly wont giving tickets people paid LEAST year before. 1:100,000 would acceptable severe AE ratio vaccine, considering Covid severe AE ratio 1:100. However, severe AE ratio increases 1:10,000, risk profile may acceptable low risk Covid groups. fear mongering trolling, bad worse denier trolling. Stop it. virus extensively vetted independently found man made. it’s serious virus taken seriously, know documented reports 100 countries people caught mild symptoms many symptoms all.

We don’t fully understand yet people develop severe disease it, generally exception, norm. It’s actually sister law getting married. I’m 8 years 3 kids deep myself. Thanks though! think that’s valid question. It’s waited weeks update. people ages 3-75. still anyone personally gotten positive test. People think receive negative results back. wife cold last week got tested, also negative. Would seem little unlikely wide range ages 3 weeks since still know 0 people who’ve Covid. person classes already suspended. Read article Yes. day cares never closed. chances kid getting sick close zero. Vaccines less effective elderly natural immune system vastly deteriorated (typically). need vaccine younger people build immunity virus lessen spread, eradicate all.

Edit: Yeah go ahead downvote me. Let go ahead run trials elderly. result vaccine effective rest us get vaccinated. Bravo! whatever New Zealand says. case vaccine Swine Flu, disorder ""Guillain-Barre Syndrome"", affected one 100,000 people took it.

Guillain-Barre Syndrome always affects like 1/100.000, regardless vaccines? viruses exhaled droplets fall ground survive far longer cold, low UV conditions, become airborne air currents. called Subway tell thought flu. said anyone cover expected there. coworkers sent back room said stay there. Boss showed around noon sent home. 


I wish could told boss fuck off, going sere food think flu. also really needed paycheck afford lose job. shou

But pneumonia INCREDIBLY common (especially old people hospital) that's outlandish think. really wish people view, often (and especially Reddit) that's enough people feel compelled prove there's god all. Yup got trouble senior year high school missing roughly 22 days total scattered throughout year since (well, still have) immune system issues.

Even though nearly straight still kept work, called talk vice principal ""excessive absences"" 

meanwhile I'd see students sent school stomach bugs nasty things pressure miss school much.

also sick leave joke US majority jobs Reddit can't seem decide getting first vaccine dangerous want rich people get first. pick one thing get college kid populist temper tantrum about? shows much poor leadership crippled response. multiple ways issue could dealt quickly, much critical effect. put testing eggs poorly constructed basket ended mess.

Our testing response federal level still terrible it’s enough time fix things. Compare CDC response H1N1 2009. addition, CDC isn’t one charge making testing Covid vaccines, countries public health branches evaluating vaccines, Alternate scientifically accurate headline: “20 cases linked outbreak associated karaoke bar.”

Doesn’t make claims linkage author qualified make, still gets across necessary info. (That’s using, course, liberal definition word “necessary.”) Yea, I'll get vaccinated probably year release initial vaccine. They're going rush that's something want part of. sending kids spread virus around pandemic better option? normal flu would fine, knowingly went school COVID, passed kids immuno-compromised family members died, everyone transmission chain would live guilt needless deaths. trials US trials elsewhere enough? time passes, numbers fudged. think they're going get accurate, sure possibility they'll get less accurate. thing is, taking vaccine also risk, vaccinated get COVID die it. much vaccine might risk, I'd get less one risk death COVID. Well, 'States anyway, countries least try take care citizens without forcing price bankruptcy citizens. Risky business risky. yesterday first day school teaching. Even Kindergarten Pre-K students school next 2 weeks Lord Cuomo stated colleges 100 cases 5% student body became infected would shutdown campus. Let's see stays true word. issues get infected flu die pneumonia caused flu. die high blood pressure pneumonia caused flu? That's lie agenda, though. list trusted authorities this. protection nice, people get protections investment classes.

They still sell home get out, much like taking losses stocks.

This problem people living houses, problem investors. thread posted 5 times last 22 hours lol 99.8 is, everyone country age 25 least one pre existing condition. point people country think high chance surviving, lying themselves. closer 94 95 even ""healthy"" ideal kills .2% misrepresentation, hardly anyone fits category.

Yet, totally cool walk around mask dick nose hanging out. totally cool go work sick send kid school sick, pandemic. 200k dead. people power refuse govern except black person hold arms high enough police stop, then, oh boy, time get enforcing pants on! Yeah, try point bad luck Stockholm's region sportlov exactly two weeks epidemic Italy became obvious, rather Denmark Skåne two weeks barely spread infection, people start yelling luck, lack inaction Sweden take measures pandemic pandemic yet infection announced yet austrian resort actually hiding infection outbreak protect tourist season.

So then, people keep saying ""compare Sweden neighbours"" even though much spread Sweden even lockdown measures taken - obvious amount dead Sweden already start April compared neighbours (since lockdowns inacted middle March, takes 2 weeks see effect infections dropping, deaths follow infection rate 3-4 weeks actually). April 1st Sweden already 332 deaths (FHM source) Denmark 90, Norway 28 Finland 17. 2 weeks lockdowns inacted. One week this, deaths 979 - 203 - 69 - 34 (same sources). no, amount spread lockdown. nobody cares want make failure look larger. scientist studies daily, wrong care keep reposting evidence every day point. little research. comes every day kids, really easy find cases popping around country schools. little reading come argue someone informed background stuff. taken Israel's example right away reopened, certain groups listen facts

edited apparently can't mention anything political post labeled purely political. despite pandemic caused politics Hopefully next stage civilization sees us harness power earth. I’m gonna hold breath though never did. Maybe got deleted autobot something? never saw it. 

So go ahead, please link CDC saying 240,000 extra suicides US since March. 

Go ahead. dare it. oh christ, stop dramatic. people learned home entire length human history. way potential destroy lives spreading fucking virus caused pandemic currently in. wake fuck would take Toronto anywhere US. lingering “patriotism” 2016 election completely evaporated year. bible all. read story creation metaphor big bang evolution makes ton sense.

I would go far calling Covid 'relatively survivable.' crazy saying something like taboo, happened us? Olm şaka mısın Believe not, countries America. running trials countries last couple months. Jacinda Ardern hero! respond instead birdlawyerperson exactly that? 

I'm responding there's point. went someone(me) called phoney, person gave direct response argues point ignored..... know troll stirring shit because... well, actually understand 'why', seriously answer question:

\- around March-April country began lock 
\- self-quarantining became regular practice

\- mask wearing outside home practiced

\- testing started across country

\- contact tracing began across country

There's probably more, time go all. probably lie try deny claims anyway, troll. school truancy officer show door 10 year old daughter time missed 15 total days. 15 days row. 15 total.

This isn’t US :) suppose corrected mistake.

My claim countries like flawless lol. make mistake, real mistake, politician ordered say stuff.

My country, Denmark, well I'd trust us well. slow masks, like ""meh! maybe, maybe not, knows!!! meh!"" masks long time. took like 5 months correct, like ""everybody mask yo!"".

Then again, still big step Jared Kusher writing memos :) It’s pretty wild back pre Covid normal things gotten South Dakota far people’s behavior could saved University lot money study talked first Lots antivax articles posted lately. Really scary see reaction Covid. production line normally produces 50 units day.

Then suddenly starts getting orders 1000 units day.

Do cut ties can't meet demand?

There alternatives right now, take slightly increased capacity maybe 100 units day, take nothing 0? Deport part red America belongs.

I'm Boomer, portfolio straight-bonds since 2017. 2431 total cases city, 1795 recovered though yesterday. tests garbage. done more. Like Texas. They're deaths cali 33% less population. blame obesity part there, story. prepared better. Instead, governor talking shit california because, time, cases. 

Governor Abbot fucking idiot. true. That’s another aspect haven’t looked at. It’s seems like bad idea. disease risks outweigh vaccine risks take right There’s way know Covid vaccine really don’t trust risk coming ? 

You can’t referring covid know deadly. see you’re saying. think it’s like, “this person heart disease living it. Covid came along died.” That’s covid listed cause death. assumption Covid exacerbated condition would otherwise still living with. guess someone dying getting infected covid enough assume covid killed them.

I don’t disagree logic, explaining assume going on. entire point post **scientists** finding covid serious initially feared. sure age account anything. don’t proof I’m wrong that’s proof you’re doubling due sunk cost fallacy. what's important? Basing everything general cases rather severity underlying assumption stay like vaccine comes, while. virus going disappear. Basing severity means focus vulnerable populations making sure need help get it. That's whole idea behind flattening curve. bunch 20 year olds asymptomatic hardly issue especially data seems show asymptomatic people unlikely spread it. yeah guy got figured out. Let's ignore fact 175k+ already died directly covid, instead speculate hypothetical situation people die lost job-linked health insurance. Like said, I'll pass. nice life. mean said yourself, indeed facts they’re spitting. data comes messenger don’t like doesn’t mean it’s fake go whole life without hearing Sturgis site TWO historically stupid pro-virus extravaganzas last month? It’s almost like people infect others... No, all. need anyone talk comes girlfriend, reach out. me, definitely someone. burden carry yourself. Don’t know you’re downvoted stating obvious, happy cake day buddy. they're cutting ties lab that's processed million tests. Essentially creating another backlog labcorp removing quest. testing going keep dropping care people test positive. literally protesting streets Germany lockdowns Exactly. would choose rent build new rental units market legal pay rent sales market booming? Yea, like say lives equal world rarely weighing one life another. But, deep down, know really case. all, ""women children first"" come from?

This different scale. thing initial ""masks work"" line. Save supplies really need them, change everyone things settle. **Massive increase cases at** XXX School reopened person classes.

FIFY. Coupled whiplash changing plans guidelines horrible communication data State reporting, super easy see people trust anything said now. Things like reporting two different forms ""case rate"" two different places, one actually mattered hidden behind several link instead displayed main page caused nothing confusion distrust numbers. figured denote subservience Russia Yeah, ""cute"". good advert tho, get wrong. ridiculous need studies There's solid chance vaccine going give 100% guaranteed immunity. Mississippi  eat sleep? winter Brazil. things going Brazil? (looking up) good worse us. 4 million cases 121,000 deaths. 1. dont unless millionaire

2. What's point? Idk say Alabama 1000 suprising lot designed block DNA RNA replication least Floridians wear masks worry confined homes. 

Why things could slow spread Governor? Kudos taking great care citizens.

I'm small (1-unit) landlord, kept starter 1BA condo, got married upgraded. renters kept jobs thankfully I'm facing paying close $1500/month mortgage/HOA/Insurance revenue coming in. could float it, damn I'd hurting. Again, semantics. employees get paid work we’ve six months, think see patterns around advice. wonder happens next? 

The first lie masks don’t anything. Lots people started saying that. 

The second lie half-truth masks protect others. people turned around said that. 

Now we’re starting get messages around protecting well others, wonder finally get support ramping manufacturing make PROTECTIVE masks *public*. 

Think calming unifying would be. 

The left could stop complaining “selfish people”, right could stop complaining “weak minded, scared people.” clearly missing entire point said. sub show facts make horrible thing sound better. inserted opinion said everyone ought depressed. say anything people going home, sick not. totally made comment something else entirely. truant excuse come school, least CA. Staying home sick excused absence. So, long parents call school inform coming that's California Legislature defined truant precise language. summary, states student missing 30 minutes instruction without excuse three times school year must classified truant reported proper school authority.

Parents give shit kids education point can't even bothered send school morning something fuck kid life severely punished. Smart. it’s parents, it’s kids. It’s child’s fault treat badly something control over? Gish Gallop. harder takes time prove truth toss million false statements. look argumentative trying correct someone. Kids pretty much ok comes coronavirus. CDC say actually killed 9K total? basically nothing. 

Schools open Swine flu caught badly (even asthma kid week). totally possible. Thought so. obvious isn’t it? mustang. Port Neches-Groves HS (you find syndicated news least three things late) gives students never missed day school across 13 years... ford Mustang. Anyway, opened fully disallowed students going virtual. quarantining. deaths. I’m sure they’ll anybody give vroom vroom to. 😷🤕🤒🤧🤢 vaccine feel safest taking. Easily. “excuse” absences medical reason it’s discretion administration. determine time absences excessive report prosecution. Based article actually referencing University California San Francisco Dr Monica Gandhi virologist. Moderna saline placebo unless adverse reaction think placebo could possibly seen coming?! governor Virginia whole public address thing honestly struck many people wear masks. Everyone speak, including stepped microphone, mouths foot less it....and took pulled masks address Virginia citizens. understand fine masks on, reason pull enclosed spaces, less 6 feet people. kept asking time I'd see people pulling masks talking others makes sense, ""leaders"" they? critical, nobody seems know answer. hardly spreads outdoors. I’m sure child brought home deadly disease parent purposely sent kid school daycare, would laugh random member family died. Also look perspective school staff.. many quarantined whole thing shuts down. It’s logical conclusion. Parents get weeks todo deal (my guess). think there's doubt confusion we're relying bunch Florida men taking correct pandemic precautions true. ""DeSantis vows lock Florida again"" Florida never really locked long statistics show keeping people away mistake. can't believe share country sociopaths. I'm sorry think would happened let Covid-19 run rampant? seriously believe fallout would better current situation. Letting run rampant could easily caused collapse global economy. millions people getting sick time overwhelming hostpials, turn causing much worse crisis Healthcare professionals become sick longer able care sick dying(from everything, Covid-19). really see famine comes would worse anything comes lockdown/social distancing? Covid-19 kills many things, incapable seeing cost would extract without lockdown/social distancing..

What think happens many people sick production grinds halt? Goods manufactured shipped throughout world, can't even get necessities essential workers sick work. 

Doing nothing would brought world knees wondering someone think nothing would better even enough. information world, species. Sacrifice greed. 

Millions infected hundreds thousands dead really believe trade death sickness two plans action. Ridiculous, ridiculous. tradeoff can't believe human beings become weak. pathetic. Everyone knows already vaccines. hurt small number people collectively take risk together otherwise many many die. 

This lazy thinking. counter medicines similar issues side effects allergic reactions. bring like kind secret gets suppressed. I’m sorry loss. Bullshit doesn’t really change anything. process letting school know short term absences won’t get CPS called you? It’s never concern kids’ school... left tunes cnn &amp; reddit

yeah even need read rest wall text know going. Kamala Harris would throw ass jail that. No. There's contact required slum bathroom transmission.

Right, almost SARS-CoV-2 transmission. know also public bathrooms fecal plumes outside slums, too, right? Share 3-month observational study... 

Are supposing seeing decrease antibodies even short study suddenly stop become increase without another exposure infectious agent/antigen? would contrary I've learned human immunity. seen decrease, going reverse, unlikely plateau. Moreover, matter except assessing much population exposed virus based antibody testing results. Immunity still conferred via white blood cell population changes. 

But want study, go:  many died something Covid nearest ICU full? fuck. way I’d talk prosecutor without attorney me. That’s nuts. Asymptomatic transmission rare much restricted cluster spread within households. large part *because* people maintaining social distancing, wearing masks public, avoiding large indoor gatherings, **are** reasonable precautions follow. time messages ""Take precautions"" areas incidence controlled; people encouraged decide personal risk level behave manner comfortable given situation. follow mandates/recommendations limit prolonged, close proximity people around regularly, particularly indoor proximity, overall risk infection low.

For instance, psychological damage drilling doomerism brains young age. france implemented covid restrictions saw increased bed wetting, heightened anxiety, loss sleep, etc. study say anything herd immunity, except unsupported guess.

There's reason believe government orders shape human behavior strongly suggested - governments ending shutdowns suddenly make people choose go bars/restaurants/theaters numbers used to. study provides weak support that, really engage three points I've posted, grounded actual epidemiological explanations. I'm northeast state,NJ, best, people starting act like pandemic never happened. masks, partying, etc, etc. It'll back flu season rate, doubt mind all

What best us best us. pandemic. States linked, cross invisible border. People come state every day. need national strategy, evidenced entire world countries shut properly well. could've still can.

It's like fall break hip I'm 90 years old... mean everyone stop rollerblading might break hip die. people die falls specific category people -- like COVID deaths.

This stat help reign proper risk evaluation. Yes, contagious disease ain't first one we've had. Basic social distancing hygiene go long way. can't shut entire world something like comes along.

This like 2 scale 1-10, handle it? Come on. We'd rather destroy entire country, supply chains, mass unemployment, education system, mass depression over... this?

Just like anything else, let healthy strong continue sick weak stay back. fact someone 60+ years old working Wal-Mart (or another ""frontline"" job) still entirely different issue. Look Japan handles things like comes elderly. like Memorial Day July 4th.  I'm scientist reads stuff every day thanks condescending tone coming someone even remotely educated topic am

funny how, pandemic actually know way less virus others, suggesting going every paradigm epidemiology trying reduce contacts close schools. I'm actually total agreement epidemiologists know doing, massive risk reopen schools. talking stuff published 4-5 months ago, maybe, even people always concluded properly know enough yet Oh joy! warnings John Q. Public ignore! banks CA still collecting mortgages / DoTs. relief people sacrificed worked hard passive income.  want catch NY's numbers? right. I'll stop now. Flat Earth psyop   Okay then, greed.

They're fantastic right either, though. Children died it. misinformation. Look long term effects coronavirus. Boo hiss. went Lake. :P need take practical sustainable measures like masks public, getting close strangers, staying home feeling well.

But respond society measures like masks public, getting close strangers, staying home feeling well *are actively contradicted members society*?

Driving safe everyone chooses drive right side road (or everyone chooses drive left side road). even driving right side road can't make driving safe society whole gotten behind consensus. stay road, encourage friends/family Meanwhile good evidence, especially places like Sweden, herd immunity reached restrictions.

Provide sources, making positive statement. prove negative, millions infected people there's way prove _nobody_ suffered negative post-infection effects. Think saying here. Viruses want live, infect people, reproduce. That's evolutionary biology. would virus mutate severe strains kill people could become mild spread easily infecting people making sick? Mutations deadly infectious viruses beyond rare, evolution/reproduction favorable. 

[I'd recommend reading thread article likely virus even mutate much flu seasonal basis, great news. Also, things reinfection high mortality problem we'd seeing much clearly. going ""wipe us out"" would seeing now, think?

EDIT: Actually, immunocompromised, dame pretty callous. bad. totally understand wanting take precautions protect daughter (in case issues). chances are, child fine. Viruses tiny; barely larger molecules size. fairly frail. reproduce special circumstances (specific types cells, example), thus ability culture one virus necessarily translate culturing different virus.

Once virus need either inactivate properly dose small enough amount induce response without also inducing symptoms.

Some sorts viruses apt mutate can’t even reliably create vaccine, HIV, example.

Once prospective vaccine, need test make sure induce response doesn’t induce response tantamount getting actual illness. Side effects may also concern. done successively larger phases precaution. 

Also, culturing vaccines basically culturing virus. That’s what’s necessary scale one weak virus huge quantity necessary vaccine population. It’s frustratingly slow it’s simple math problem. Historically flu vaccine uses chicken eggs, sure options vaccines, even relatively specialized process handful businesses perform.

Yes can, viruses replicate cells, destroys cells. left unchecked literally cause massive tissue damage would prove fatal understanding NZ done terrific. they've less 2000 cases sensible government policies. pay visitors stay hotels quarantine 2 weeks arrive? means enlighten counter argument used excuse order açaí bowls. Don’t worry it’ll gone November American cops shoot people execution style. Well one story debunks it
No need wear masks guys. 

On side note hate people like you. think Googling fancy name HIV try sound smart instead like anti-science moron. probably even know retrovirus means, means uses reverse transcriptase go genes messenger ribonucleic acid transcriptases wrong way 1 step, cause genes convert antisense sense back antisense way around switch nucleic acid types along way, there's probably even retroviruses known science attack respiratory cells. God knows trying get people killed I'm mental health professional, I'll leave speculation them. Maybe sperm comes people coronadeath lol, kidding. thought sec we're dealing zombies Cool story man even worst I've experienced. I'd get sort take I'm best given situation. Everything gets wiped switched different plates containers. cherry pick shit science papers make anything sound compelling. Time time go read actual papers sure enough always nuance claims made.

Literally playing telephone science. That's known yup, yet see actual proof ""deaths without pneumonia respiratory condition""

I'm sure happened though, can't find That’s though, see consequences actions, won’t care Yes, like headline today first female cardiologist India died yesterday 103 COVID. think misunderstanding report CDC. example, someone coded pneumonia caused COVID lead respiratory arrest put respirator suffered cardiac arrest scenario would count 3 co-morbidities report. Sorry, hamsters wear masks. researchers simulated mask wearing placing mask material pipes supplying air cage. one general public misinterpreting things- intentional misinformation campaign involving high level government officials. People can't read.  CDC said people died covid-19 also something else fairly serious wrong (and probably pretty old top it. said that)

That mean, might died next years might lived condition Covid-19 cause die did.  

If shoot someone, saying ""well cancer going die time now"" much excuse.  matter people? Lower? Yes.

Drastically lower? We'll see. can't take much comfort level success we've achieved stopping COVID-19 social distancing mask wearing. think least 6,000,000 reasons worry... mean jokes probably somewhat funny least 50% time. 

Her responses weird 100% time. I’ve seen people say O. M. G. before, never spell LOL. 

Then still people think LOL means lots love, so, takes types. Ummmm... actual news? first impression “duh.” Yea but, Orange Sluml0rd said best, that's needs heard

You actually best, say it. Thats cults work. Right. get Except literally made entire side argument. argument social distancing *do* vaccine pandemic over, seem advocate, stupid. Republicans NEVER motivated election concerns! /s 


All want competent management. Republicans want kickbacks personal power. comes viral load, stay near someone long enough get matter protection.  demonstrates needs federal law mandating masks. Hopefully Biden/Harris make happen.

In many ways doesn’t go far enough either though, often even people wear masks wrongly. fault own. happens. reason task force specialists monitor masks worn correctly. spread communities work.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. obviously includes anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

Their children perhaps slightly less conspicuous symbol masks — something identify real risk result raised enemies society science.

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people “enemies” progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. task force mentioned easily adopted work. individuals employed federal government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress.

Obviously people willingly violate new mask law separated society — good society, well good. dealt humanely fairly. like Nazis. individuals simply separated families society moved safe place time being. perfectly humane fair. safe places seek educate evil ways harm world. re-educated returned society. course repeat offenders dealt little harshly. 

But benefit. Eventually individuals proven menace society danger security state, permanently removed. done humanely, key done good collective whole. system really space individualism. selfish attitude exactly got us trouble first place.

So selfish activity controlled aspects society, especially economic realm. Individuals allowed hoard cash. progressive tax policy course help redistributed, aid less fortunate. cash hoarding outlawed, banks reason exist. probably done away first. People run banks identified enemies state placed camps see error ways returned society. course allowed enter advantageous position, somewhere near base, reduced manual tasks help greater good. Needless say also special insignia masks identifies part dangerous class individuals.

Business owners stripes receive treatment managers banks. course understanding welcome opportunity make amends society. However will, protection, removed society. It’s both. 2 countries worst covid stats?  Brasil usa...

But seeing comment written:

""I bet *at least* 2 heads state rooting India's number grow..."" Yes, known attack heart tissue cause blood clots. Hopefully might lead finding correlations better treatment applied. Given flu statistically far deadly students sars cov 2... equally upset done protect flu? assumed getting information fear mongering sources like reddit generally try make virus far dangerous actually is? odd faith give much little. Blind faith reckless take away though. technically. But, Data Age, you’re going put statistics like public website, “interpreted” public. Otherwise, like said, conspiracy folks everyday Joes give interpretation information. agree author goes little far instances unrelated covid. particular jab pursuit happiness shooting black people. know.  author check meanings “underlying conditions”, “comorbidities” that’s important distinction given context. I'm sure families 11,000 people are, else, thankful state's numbers little less national average. CDC report said 94% comorbitity. say ""underlying"" ""prexisting"" condition intentional disinformation campaign conflating  ... expect experts get 100% correct right away? expect change guidance new information? does. Look CDC site. They're including pneumonia comorbidity. wrongly described underlying condition article. map showing much many states, bear mind one looking one kind college / university even define GMO though? literally every single thing eat form GMO, whether lab level simpler version like forcing genetic selection, splicing species, etc.

So far seems like downsides GMO handful legal battles corporations controlled ownership work, seen downsides yet far human consumption goes. called mom crying little bit made feel like ass upset. always does. idk. I've called health department something different similar ratted out. just.... One top 10 countries deaths per 100k

Out what, like 170 countries

Only delusion amazing No, genome sequences current cluster every case border match, say unlikely came border. also environmental testing workplace first appeared in, cold freight import warehouse, testing came back negative too. 

So really idea got back in. say possible paths extremely unlikely, means however got odds, incredibly bad luck. hopefully means even less likely happen again. 1008 new cases Canada highest daily total since May 28th. reason missed? may lowered cases reported death count due covid moved something else.

But really hard fake Covid deaths.

But people really # cases many people catching it. really deaths since much harder ""lie"" Well yes, here, Europe, people get 20-35 days holiday time, that’s 4-7 weeks. going somewhere that’s expensive get worth stay week far easier. get vaccinated care people don’t get vaccinated?

Genuine question. F Governor!! Essentially one incentivized *only* give accurate information quickly possible. politics PR around since January. That's too. much better paying double food worth, add flavors want. that's definitely positive think lot people experienced too. :) Wow unfortunately turned true guess statistics thing car crashes fatalities Tedros liar. World health organisation care health profit Poor people forced get one part employment agreement. 

That way businesses wont need pay PPE protections workers. vaccine adverse effects worker dies, well, I've noticed trend headlines use percentage high enough, raw numbers not. 803 cases 100,000 (like article says) less 1%. Adrian College (the ""rising"" story sub) says 6.5% 152 impressive number. Sometimes they'll use % *tested* students positive, number impressive. frankly dishonest.

I'll get shit jumped favor colleges re-opening person, fact I'm not. But, whatever... I'll accept downvotes. National socialist Shocking news! Water wet! /sarcasm

It's sad news, even sadder many Muricans ignore fake news bought studies whatever. serious mean fucking whatever. numbskulls want keep fucking around find out. saying shit couple months ago look turned out, shut anyway.

Adults without basic object permanence like cancer do? Executive branch agencies really ""under"" anyone. President sort make budgetary life difficult extent obviously play politics agency heads, he/she going to, say, go office building say, ""Hey, push want get reelected."" Bill, Susan, etc. rest diverse team people actual work going say, ""Oh geez, course. We'll get done ASAP.""

If vaccine passes phases clinical trials, passed phases clinical trials. really way fake this. whether makes sense get said vaccine, especially new one, depends risk/reward. Idiots would start shooting place

The rich fly outside country best medical care. 

The middle class/working class risk financial ruin. 

The poor go. really astonishing failure part CDC's messaging apparatus. would publish something easily misinterpreted? Lol issued big non-apology. Basically ""sorry felt way."" would accept approved vaccine Ethiopia US. Every time guy speaks public basically advertises much fucking moron is. Yet despite this, UK hired advisor. even question? figured 1918 Arizona scary place right now. Doug Ducey still mostly pretending virus. testing rate plateaued never expanded. Life back business usual here, streets stores packed. parts town (scottsdale), one wears masks.

We're also entering winter; time Arizonans start leaving homes again. self isolate summer anyway escape 115+ degree temperatures, buy charming 99 degrees yesterday everyone eager get back steadily double digits temperatures.

I'm extremely thankful working comfortably home. I'm predicting another spike visible mid October, maybe November. Wave 3 come tell North Korea fucked ""expatriates"" ""defectors""

I think I'd like ""defect"" US day soon. massive divide 2 3. Yeah America really hard compare single European country. Much easier compare Europe America. vast majority much better meaningful statistical way, unless like US performing line Brazil.

And media coverage - look countries, even ones much better control. constant, spend lot time focusing it.

The government fucked every way possible, throughout crisis. nothing anti-American sentiment, simple math. Say will, Florida’s discombobulated lockdown handled infinitely better New York’s. Florida et al. death figures close NY, would dire straits. Cheap compared U.S., like 4000 RON(990$), that's country monthly minimum income 1300 RON(320$), basically 3 months work full-time entry level job qualification. 2 least. 

But like half students get university financed state, depending grades(say 1000 students state finances 400, first 400 descending order related grades get free tuiton either semester whole year, depends university).

Still, students need pay tuition fee themselves, well living arrangements work full-time, meaning skip classes get punished it. Exactly. Also, love name. :D great article stream failures coming fr Sweden. Thanks! scary virus

No not.

It kills 10% old get it, along sick.

It's mild flu almost everyone else, most, extreme statistical outliers.

And vast majority 'long-haul' symptoms sound like anxiety/Munchausen's. good ideas think she'd take seriously. one older relatives forever see child even though I'm 40 years old lmao keep scrolling. disagree others, I'm calm person tries avoid inflammatory statements, reply like I'm temper tantrum. disappointing tbh. “Emergency” tracheotomy limited acute obstructions. Usually likely cricothyroidotomy. minimal interaction possible. need stop gas grocery pickup. That's pretty much it. 

I kinda think given parents poor health pretty old, everyone would fine even get COVID pass away it. much longer live. I'm sure discussion happened, though.  Eww pre-existing condition term used health insurance companies!

A comorbid condition something addition current illness. current illness includes associated symptoms (like resp failure). damaged scarred lungs COVID, referred comorbid condition future.

But please call pre-existing conditions... Things know needed savages barbarians (me Cause half would quit half would die. cold flu comparison Covid-19 compare lowest mortality year per capita ever (as another user pointed 2019 anomaly last 30 years) idea good statistics? Multiple places compare either last 5, last 10 years (when also adjust population changes), think 1 1 best? Good you. 

*Now people live together someone sick Covid still supposed go work.* 

There literally press conference earlier today social minister warned future local outbreaks local restrictions might made people live sick person test stay quarantine well negative tests shown. possible extended testing capabilities low infection rate (hence people test enough). 

*supress Covid mitigate enough health care overloaded*

The healthcare overloaded COVID-19 since June. Sweden going low enough infections levels comparable neighbours, seems right supressed.

*recommendations use face masks crowded places*

This something discussed widely last weeks FHM said recommended becomes relevant going benefit - crowded places public transport. trying get public transport crowded first place means - pressuring companies cars public use transport really needed. 

So nothing said right new people following government recommendations. offering solutions differ government already planning do. Idk university costs Romania didn’t way barely anyone could afford go college. Even full time job take loan cover costs. One organization, two hospitals (Solna Huddinge). get idea size Karolinska, 16,000 people work two hospitals. crony capitalism live Tennessee. metropolitan statistic area served one health care entity Certificate Need laws. competition health care state allowing licensing willing compete. kinda confused headline, since province mandatory masks indoors

Thought rest canada way smh Regardless whether US sorts shit out, pretty clear point Pax Americana US position ever moral leader world... probably ever again. That's good thing, world turns away America... America almost certainly become aggressive threatening. mean- testing, contact tracing, treatment, behavioral changes etc... much better back March. Florida severe outbreaks nursing homes, too. Make mistake- damn near every governor made mistakes. Unfortunately north east- mistakes made beginning pandemic- way costly. Got stats looking highlights rare cases? 

Last checked fatality rate anyone 40 like 0.2%. School way overrated anyways Yea, Europe, least Romania. Universities job-friendly, mostly morning classes(as early 7, like said) sometimes make sense. Like one day I'll classes 7-12 AM, next random 10-12 class STILL makes working impossible third day 2-6 PM. 

Here, master's degrees scheduled around worklife. start really late allow people full-time job, go late 10-11PM classes. 

And no, can't pick classes/hours, would dope would make far much sense country it. Good tho.  thought title sounded weird..

So can't tag post misleading? delete misinformation.  It’s pretty common US college students make schedules. worked well also needed work full time eat pay rent, would load classes Tuesday/Thursday occasional MWF class able make work work schedule. middle what? company 499 employees *total* considered small business? No, both. That's people multiple comorbidities listed. Google data detailed, that's good see. guess issue looking navigation requests mean people actually following social distancing guidelines. means they're going places need directions. could still going big party friend's house.

For example, know people use GPS navigation drive work. need directions, need live traffic data telling ""there's wreck highway, take route instead."" everyone went working home, requests would've dropped Apple Maps.

Please downvote more, people tend read those. nice article Chinese human organ harvesting. That's awful lot deaths people otherwise healthy.... That’s feel too. honestly wish could break lease Deaths really starying slow down. Good news, we're waters yet. next month two telling. 

Hopefully herd immunity+ behavioral changes + regulations + better treatment = much less deadly fall. Im optimistic, proven wrong last (See: Summer death toll) It’s like people lucky enough recover polio without dying. fact asymptomatic mild flu symptoms.

So many sheeple existed world back then. glad everyone woke now. /s Note identify pretty strongly camp, forcing people vaccinate fascist. believe mandatory, required enter business open public public school. likely pull people board, not, minimizes damage people do.

But please, fascism rallying around gunman murders people protesting civil rights, requiring vaccine. horrible.... Wuhan closed grocery stores general public, order online delivered apartment. Italy allowed go grocery store pick curbside, cannot enter store. Can’t relate all, shocked see smug US bashing here. think go places like Utah. definitely see that. think religion rates high everywhere America though. Lucky children hopefully many years make 3 months. figured back march HCQ, ivermectin remdesivir talk, wouldnt even need rely vaccine. treatments would enough go back normal

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* So, argument massive spike excess deaths outside flu season, happening time Covid spread due Covid? What's causing it? No, think belief ""The CDC deep state President. He's fixed now."" sound young; unfortunately real. Even state mandated wear mask, come across people store inside places refusing wear mask. One thing learn time laws regulations effective people willing enforce them, requires resources. Minimum wage workers yelled 10th time week customer may supported managers enforcing mask rule always likely put foot necessary resources (back management ex). Medicare Obamacare fit Capitalism? Lol back......like before...... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Dear god. 
I saw someone outside bad enough. train next level. Thanks corrected! issue is, around world, running time people completely stop social distancing, wearing masks, etc. them? Yes

To you? Apparently not.

And that's prerogative. 

Uncomfortable idea? Dont go game.

 Afraid subsequent disease spread? Stay home

Cant stay home due work something? Decide risk virus worth job. 

At *some* point risk take. also low mortality january-february 2020 compared years see reason suddenly change unless Covid come along. Therefor think best compare 2019. trajectory deaths going Covid came would likely less previous years.

The solution elderly able live normal life supress Covid mitigate enough health care overloaded. 

There could variety things do. people live together someone sick Covid still supposed go work. could also recommendations use face masks crowded places. 

But change mitigation ro suppreasion reason to.change anything.

And course use face masks nursing homes. may remember spring Tegnell recommend face masks care homes. totally agree. Though right now, ""next time"". first guys ate 100 bucks buffet stopped everyone else eating. Yes point could still passed along flu somehow killed someone else. Immunodeficient people, die minor diseases. weren’t hearing every day moralizing social media nobody cared. 

Where majority deaths care homes. tragedy could prevented protecting places better. maintenance men wear masks. mad. did, 2 months. state mandate whenever public areas. high risk household neighbors know, maintenance knows... none give fuck. old lady upstairs laughs sees us masks. Mind you, I'm bad neighbor. help ask, offer help notice something right. make sign recycle bin people kept putting garbage it. like... one cares anymore. bruh get tired this...but going make us work make us stay home longer. partner work Healthcare. go jobs people go selfish perpetuate virus spread. infuriating It’s unc school smaller one read  told cases steadily going last month reached record lows weekend? Yes flu season won’t like flu seasons. Look many folks working home compared flu seasons. Look many folks wearing masks compared flu seasons. think normal flu season (speaking simply flu cases) selling hysteria. Even without 100% mask compliance, many social events workplace settings aren’t existing right combined enough mask compliance really suppress anything close normal amount flu cases see given year. dot dot dot

Note: suggesting means forget virus live life, least lets people gauge risk better. new. talked along. multiple articles posting coronavirus subreddit. assumption would know Joe Plumber. 80-200 cases perday, going lift anytime soon. Iowa get shit pushed in. Canada handle worse New Zealand? That’s works. 

You tried. story ON, terms march break earlier provinces (BC, AB), time march break rolled around west coast gov Canada releasing travel warnings probably stemmed alot international travel.  


100% agree effect government support/CERB unemployed people stemming spread early on. People forced re-open business mid-quarantine quarantine maximum effectiveness. Follow gradual science-based re-opening plans, general public (begrudingly) adopting masks social distancing, i'd say canada declare ""mission accomplished"" flattening curve, least time being. Thank goodness good sense good governance.  


The cost subsidizing workforce short-term far less cost supporting unemployment job losses long-term letting business individuals go broke, allows economy whole rebound much quicker. Similar successes seen Germany european countries employed similar strategies potential even spread then. Christian, shitty Christian. FUCKING BRAIN!!!!!!!!! People act like “pre-existing conditions” big things affect small percentage population. 

I’d guess 70% world type pre-existing condition virus gets hold spirals from. time ~~rushed~~ FDA approval elections. Time let healthy people back. Probably starting college kids. going age. Old propels sick people need stay stay safe. sure holding hope vaccine. Seems unlikely like take another year two. USCe That's exactly people understand. They're like special child jealous another kid go bathroom without supervision. remembering last time tried covered bathroom shit gave self pink eye.

The US Sweden never Sweden. herd immunity society diligent responsible. US not. nope 99% population?   wonder many Western Australians tried going r/CoronavirusWA Well let's see lessons learned this. Groundbreaking.  /s I'm sure look cute think really stuck someone replied post talking relative, family friend (I forgot now), permanent brain disability covid organ failure would mean would always need care taker could never work again, included recovered statistics, there's ""recovered"" ""dead."" 

I think post every single time Trump, CDC, anyone else talks people die old underlying issues, children go school die even catch it, etc. True. found puzzling she’d L.O.L. all. He’s desperate cure trying convince us it’s nothing worry about. looked unicorns yet? think will. don’t think Midwest drastic rise saw south west experienced peaks, knows. reason think it’ll bad especially mask wearing highest it’s ever USA’s history.

Restraining order seems appropriate situation. fit narrative get behind. lockdowns still place MI?  time lift lockdowns go back normal life please, governor? Seems bit excessive bad China estimates higher early testing full disaster. Now? Unsure. Probably 10x anymore. they're also trying suppress testing lower numbers. coworker wear mask told ""just another virus"" worried...

Yes, used telegraph since last pandemic. /s don’t know line “real lockdown, put countries, see par course west. us don’t want school online?

you 330 people, 130 basically immobile 200 medical professional working known risk population. seems like odds would naturally pretty low, especially considering temperature checks negative tests. 

why ask that's possible? Really? Never heard one before. Even extreme estimates experts beginning this, COVID never going come close “killing 10% population”, that’s ridiculous hypothetical.

Keep pretending ridiculous black plague. Thanks expert analysis. Testing highest rate nation 9+ digit population (granted take China’s numbers skeptical eye). first people dying, anti-vaxxer get lot support. ICD-10 codes need broken show exactly many pneumonia cases caused Covid. data set released CDC also includes presumed deaths goes guidelines reporting. inconsistencies within data, something - odd.  problem well holidays around distant corner know going get worse people decide celebrate families continue isolating Maybe two thirds Americans think handled pandemic better China. i...i would prefer explosive diarrhea pent constipation getting spammed since Saturday ... whenever blew Facebook.

“According Pastor John MacArthur, church regularly welcomes 7,000 guests Sunday Service.

On August 16, Pastor MacArthur told congregation ""good news"" defied health orders wearing masks social distancing.

""The good news is, here, distancing, wearing masks,"" said. ""And also good news outside, hot there. Lord knew needed inside unmasked."" Insane read article, study, data seems reference n95 equivalent surgical masks specified minimum layers cotton, combined physical separation 1M well eye protection .

My comment referring standard homemade masks simply mouth coverings.. shocking, there's ton anti America propaganda Canada Western countries like consume. Americans consume too. Weird government willing take risk telling us COVID isn’t big deal. calm storm? Says someone making excuses spewing in-genuine bullshit engaging straw man sock-puppetry caught red-handed. spreading misinformation, intentionally.

Get out. Today learned murder anyone pre-existing condition won’t fault died. Okay hot shot have? Username always checks guy, love it. Neither country done great job. honor goes nations like Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, yes, China. Canada gets barely passing grade. US abysmal category alongside Brazil, Mexico, Peru. January yes? example, China, spreading misinformation, closing internal flights actively promoting international flights?

China issued consistent pandemic warning late December. mid-January, risk known time noone knew serious would get.

Yet China, Vietnam, Taiwan knew start taking fairly extreme prophylactic Obviously 0 possibility widespread testing. mess started March, btw.

In Global measures, well least sane ones, implemented.

A statement meaning nothing unless tell think note NL lies next neither totalitarian developing

New Zealand, poor 

New Zealand, Taiwan, periphery. say anything essence before, hence comment masturbation... 

What mean say something, ""of essence""? unexpectedly hear basic-income argument. work?

UBI idea often promoted [political ideologies filtered automod bot] means away means-tested programs. gave domain unemployed?

And yes, work. Probably make money you. Thanks empathetic humble rather something disgusting like trying poverty shame someone lot people work like work. work various sectors ecnomy completely fucked intense lockdown. 'rent, food electricity', think bit higher pyramid needs.

You talk work staying home pandemic great intrinsic humanitarian loss go office factory front desk every day month Like visiting dying grandma

Has nothing work good idea pandemic particularly lethal door elderly. Best kill grandma go month two without hugging sharing space friends

Can done social distancing context virtually. parties hangouts month two spread pandemic. horror. Hundreds thousands deaths worth need marriage ceremony.

Very small ceremonies done socially distanced context. Larger ceremonies parties put for, again, 1-2 coming back original comment, frames conflicts apart economics 101.

Extremely minor ones block implementation public health policies. know enough exact nature response, critical general population Argentina. third world country tbh. Government response maybe, people no.

Firstly, looking mobility data only, went hard NZ^(\*). lockdown lasted much longer poverty major issue 35% population living poverty line, including 9.6% living $5.50 USD per day. Cost living half compared NZ, that's like living $16.25 NZD per day. minimal government support, (see below), many months population without savings last lockdown?

The final observation overall amount money country would limited response. GDP Argentina fraction NZ per capita (\~25%). National debt covid 76% gdp compared 28% NZ. likely one reasons testing contact tracing adequate, without these, real hope control. likely limited amount support government could give too.

^(\*) edit hard NZ harder  air intake holes places virus get in, eyes well.

Plus even excluding eyes normal masks cover air intake totally, need n95 that. agree. However, aware childcare take sick kid either, right? Source, there, done that. low enough income subsidies pay childcare. know centers accept it. 
Our issue fact parents choice send sick kids also report sick risk losing jobs getting written up. messed up.  think depends branch government you’re talking about. local governments don’t offer benefits pay like used to. live high COL area, government jobs don’t even pay enough live there. sure 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ likely, trying either. enjoyed teaching students understand statistics well enough could find ""answer"" ""problem"".

Not everything needs reddit political morality play. Mexican border closed. information coming from? Border crossing hours shorter still open. Yes. state, legally take 25% pre-tax income directly employer, debt paid. Court fees, interest, penalties also included amount. garnish entirety income tax returns well, court order. say... confirm watching work it’s way friends weren’t careful. careful got anyway. many fine, survived long term issues. saying ""underlying"" bias? ; ) there? feel like can't live like another year let alone even six months. hard see anything this. need follow tests, can't safely test long term effects 6 months. could, would done vaccines.

So matter ALWAYS unsafe. admit trust level every American agency time low. 

Just like reason get COVID test supplies early pandemic... rest world figured test it, CDC decided thing shipped defective tests states. Complete incompetence every level government. Algodones, Baja California twice last month getting glasses meds. border crossing hours lot shorter border closed. uses armored car protect him.

The WH tours cancelled protect - covid. tried bike. pissed. still ended getting bike store. asshole wearing mask kids asked wait next him. explained following rules wearing mask loud enough hear answer question.

The asshole went smiles feeling like douche called out. simply give fuck more. This. honestly believe anyone studied science level past high school/ done extensive reading doesnt comprehend knowledge gap science taught school level science needed good research Yeah drive drunk time hit anyone yet really dangerous Omg remember sent wondering getting chills 2pm. parents went full pro sent meds lunch eventually. think you’re underestimating amount older folk also clearly ignorant, despite risks. Dear Americans, let fucking explain!

People see want see/ morons Well that’s nice. know 2 young people dead, 1 pre existing issues, multiple young people (my friends) everything asymptomatic put ICU week. recovered covid long haulers. guess end day that’s 2 know dead wouldn’t call “negligible” past I’ve never known anyone age drop dead type virus. highly doubt it, US Canada close two countries get without Schengen type agreement. Expect increase Covid parties then. coty exist. testament man's arrogance. people? Like who, someone Facebook?  97 years old get shot head? Death old age reckon! CDC came aboard election mode. sn agency trust? like plot movie come life. Yes. Let Institute rise. Oh boy, another round learning exponential growth everyone needs tell us small numbers fallen. Science replaced politics message formed basis bootlicking instead knowledge.   get either. watch old man die pneumonia ventilator years ago. memory alone enough keep line time. TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WTXL) - officials say Quest Diagnostics failed report nearly 75,000 COVID-19 test results dating back April, Florida Department Health (DOH) Florida Division Emergency Management (FDEM) cutting ties Florida Department Health (DOH) Florida Division Emergency Management (FDEM) announced news Tuesday, saying ""severing ties Quest Diagnostics Quest’s failure follow Florida law report COVID-19 results timely manner."" TLDR.... vaccine polio failed almost 70 years ago, person making comparison recognize much medical engineering tech advanced since then. done worse simple failure. using position actively broadcast propaganda current administration.

Even administration leaves (fingers crossed January) never truly trusted again. succumbed political pressure easily certainly co-opted future.

We need independent public health agency. dipshit Alberta Trump / Pence flag live BC... Welp  conspiracy nuts (and high level government officials) pushing conspiracy already like Fauci.

The CDC needs come statement clarifying data.

It would also help white house official tweeted conspiracy would tweet retraction, probably asking much. country recession right now? current rate they'll 50% within week two.

No, won't. exaggerations like help nobody. diseases eliminated many countries thanks herd immunity produced vaccination programmes. herd immunity something achieved natural infection.

Take example measles, caused virus around humans centuries. highly infectious — R0 value 15.

This means average one child measles infect 15 others. result, around 95 per cent people need resistant disease population achieve herd immunity.

**Most people recover measles infection produce good immune response protects rest life. yet, vaccination, measles common childhood disease.**

**Each new generation children susceptible enough people naturally became resistant produce herd immunity.**

**In 1930s, temporary herd immunity effect recorded one location US.**

**But exception, countries rolled universal measles vaccination programmes enabled come close eliminating disease.**

Scientists think R0 value SARS-CoV-2 4 6, similar rubella virus. level vaccination needed produce herd immunity eliminate rubella 85 per cent."" going national high-score? Regardless govt saying going back lots companies already consulted workers already served notice office lease, mine has. I’m going back office successfully WFH 6 months now... expect plenty same..  people actually saying they're immune actually wrong. am, that's pretty high compared state's positive test rate. Herd immunity thinly-veiled eugenics Amen! Power people... I'm starting think... maybe understand... people believe kind stuff, would unethical/shitty thing they're accusing others doing, can't comprehend someone act unethically would. Gotta love ""Walls"" bite US ass!



Make America ~~great~~ stupid Again! ""herd immunity"" without vaccine even thing. 

Yes, is. Herd immunity first recognized measles outbreaks 1930s, way first measles vaccine introduced 1960s. told vaccine gets approved current administration would testing. tell 3 major testing? WTF? go well winter I'm getting sick people posting rubbish (not post, misinterpretation CDC data). telling issues statement, gave that. tell hearing bunch bullshit either believe bullshit go dive data see themselves. I'm correct means able study exactly virus does. Exhibit A: college reopenings Disinfection really isn’t necessary something effective. Even though may touching potentially contaminated items, really doesn’t matter long washes hands eating touching eyes/nose/mouth. Fomite (surface) transmission COVID isn’t primary source infection. 

The big thing air prolonged contact people. sounds like tagging merchandise pretty low risk activity long everyone wearing masks. suspect employees lax around remove masks, increasing risks infection. wages garnished refund seized due delinquent medical debt. pay rent/feed kids amount income post-garnishments, filed bankruptcy clear medical debt. Love username btw drives crazy two major arguments see mask usage “shut wear them” “masks make hard breathe.” Can’t least nuance? Explain feel way do? hear saying. complicated equation risk vs reward.

Unfortunately, US ridiculously terrible job managing pandemic. moment, seem able manage additional risk possibly avoid it. Ignoring issue doesn’t make false. Lung scarring heart issues real problem many recover covid. it’s true. Coronavirus long tail. 

That’s apart levels obesity underlying conditions even college age people. Good news corona prevention congrats orphans well strange side note headline! soon Sweden mask requirement certain areas. cities reached threshold quiet days.

Those cities still lot restrictions place. can’t expect 20% seroprevalence (and falling) protect city go back normal life. Yeaaaaa that's going help... Yes no. CDC may commercial expertise comes things like strict repeatable protocols, company involved vaccine development massive expertise. work commercial vaccine manufacturing, day 1 drill everyone concept known ""CGMP"" - Current Good Manufacturing Practices. incredibly detailed covers basically everything problematic test development noted above. Here's best short (11 minutes) explainer video I've found, [from International Society Pharmaceutical experience, lab scientists used thinking fly forget follow stringent manufacturing practices, simply they're used many procedures follow. problems CDC test development, using primarily lab folk mass manufacturing, exactly would expect happen. White House, CDC official agency said anything COVID dangerous older adults comorbidities? happened 6 weeks add vent, I'm tired trying get relatives' thick skulls *are* ""old people"" risk, medical conditions *are* ""pre-existing conditions"" everyone keeps talking about.

And feel like keep going this, they'll careful couple weeks. another stupid fucking thing like pops Facebook President's twitter feed repeat whole cycle they're convinced ""it's old sick people though"" though they're groups. like talking 3rd class Titanic passengers ship sinking like ""it's poor people dying though"".

It's exhausting, frustrating, angering. [Rt South absolute disaster, think that's worst Rt I've ever seen since started watching it. Hawaii ever even come close good 6 weeks ago so. Somehow Hawaii never became much catastrophe though, slowly started leveling recent weeks pulled Rt something slightly reasonable. Hope SD. Actually I'm recent Masters Biology drop-out mental health reasons. focused epigenetics taught epidemiology.  I’m sure laws CA, foreclosure relief well protecting smaller landlords likely lose rented homes tenants paying rent half year? many times say this

Yep, feel like I've made point 10 times last weeks. know people get it, would prefer problem opt ignore it. one need reminding college students solely exist sort hermetically sealed domes, far away general population (ie, everyone else). concern never really shit-ton college students get COVID end hospitalized, concern shit-ton college kids get and, part community student locked university, community spread (entire community) ramp along student case numbers. argument K-12, kids usually face less severe symptoms far better prognosis. Great! kids immediate family, extended families, go mom dad stores community, etc. symptoms sick, healthy carrier. true majority people get infected SARS-CoV-2. referring Asian nations able weld people homes enforce lockdown? island nations quarantine much easier? perhaps European nations seeing large second wave? Oh no!!!!!

 forgot add ""e"" apostrophe right spot comment!!

 I'm bad guy insinuated ***DIABETES HEART DISEASE*** ""elective procedures""!

I brought dishonor shame family...  see accusation made time, nobody seems know prevalent welding people apartments really is? isolated incident something standard operating procedure? 

In large enough country, find sorts government officials sorts odd things. silly take isolated incidents pretend norm. mean, find examples American police shooting Black kids, go around saying American cops go around kill children al time, we? you’re one person. need policy makers voices social media decide it’s *Has* become? founded slavery...

Oh, mean white people. Except nasty long-term heart lung issues, right?

I get it, care. political point prove, consequences damned. That's fine, think important people know folks camp ulterior motives include keeping safe. shit right combined lack faith districts handling remote learning ended pulling daughter home schooling her. 

Thankfully position could that, she’s advanced elementary school handle better someone needed specialized support. 

What sucks many millions kids year going fall behind schools bounce back forth virtual physical back teachers drop dead.

I never thought 2020 would EVER homeschool importantly schools would still behind technology still couldn’t handle remote learning level are. someone saved waiting opportunity buy home better price frustrating. exact time moment, really want people thrown streets. confusing time sure.

Depending day moment swing one way another. 

I'm essential worker given raise continuing work. Meanwhile, others get unemployment take home pay. Exactly. difference anti-vaccine people people refuse COVID vaccine, reason stated.

&amp;#x200B;

Vaccines take years development ensure safety efficiency. telling vaccine created within months safe? think not, especially considering companies involved want make profit it, race. Whoever gets first gets $$.

Only reason would refuse take it. Ill let others guinea pig Next problem hear hard people find affordable housing all. imagine potential landlord, considering subdividing space increase supply create housing, like am, someone moving choice sell rent moment, would wise offer anything rental right now. create huge supply constraints, either force rents worse, make lot people nowhere rent price. know truly got nothing pull grammar card internet 

Lol almost like they'd rather live life left cower fear miss out. Crazy it? Even Boris Johnson died 6%. Tom Hanks. pretty much every 50+ famous person got this. Jesus fucking Christ. They're pushing 6% disinformation too. many people damn strong correlation age fatality risk probably largely function preexisting medical conditions, common among older Americans. August 22, CDC reports, 94 percent COVID-19 fatalities involved ""additional conditions causes""—2.6 average. Aside conditions, pneumonia respiratory failure, may caused COVID-19, common comorbidities circulatory diseases. Hypertension, example, noted fifth cases. Diabetes mentioned 16 percent time.  Yes, reports administration thinking EUA it. Like hydroxyclorequine. 20-30 bags?? That's kinda devastating. know sake health lordy gonna pay quick. argument used police kill someone, i.e. knee throat, comorbidity killed person. We'll there, brother! one asked year even six months.

Canada here. 52 weeks total parental leave (I think) 46 shareable parents. I’ve never found need put mask times I’ve gone hiking

Nobody saying need mask wandering around woods alone. Jesus Fucking Christ, dense. We're talking normal situations, like walking store park.

He lied contact tracers. said didn’t job, fact, side hustle teaching kids cram school private tutoring sessions. Several students fellow teachers later tested positive virus, leading allegations delay caused lie cascading effect dozens infected thousands needing tested quarantined. Covid here..we need learn live it..use yr brain, teach yr kids use brain..wear mask, wash yr hands alot!, social distance much possible..this best time history.. disagree vehemently. thinking imply PRECISELY got us here. one two words. many serious? important number? Seriously bad trolling. worked hard lame joke. Sad. Good. shouldn’t get paid turn around 24 hours ... counties hospitals haven’t trying that? That’s kinda whole point hospital, isn’t it? intercept secret communications various viral colonies. allow us use targeted drone strikes eradicate enemy good.

/s presumably travel airports (still airports), land airports, travel hotels stay hotels travel stadiums.

The entire point limiting travel unexpected interactions occur (even think we’re controlled environment). becoming abundantly clear we've along. Covid19, host things like foreign us [detainment parents I’ve talked afraid, including myself. counterpoint kids need education socialization.

I would expect school boards shut outbreaks start occur. Hopefully steps taken teachers union school boards sufficient see information? Awesome! speaking local experience. Uhhh driven Mill Ave Tempe? Kind scary since Friday CASA packed picture went viral around Memorial Day. ASU students congregating parties, along little enforcement social distancing close-knit dorm living. trends I’m seeing zip code scary live area interact types people every time even take trip grocery store. 

Tempe Beach Park almost always packed peak hours ( summer) isn’t bad since it’s outdoors but, mask wearing isn’t enforced there, since ‘physical activity’ justified reason wear mask, lot people don’t comply. 

I also think definitely numerous test sites available, can’t forget test expansion also involves community outreach get tested! outbreak lines many aware higher risk get infected. However, also seen barren testing sites recently honestly that’s unacceptable me. outreach communities encourage testing, that’s catch trace outbreaks happen. 

I also disagree statement saying top comment misleading, many many Arizonans outlook. could anxiety something like leadership proven time time don’t willingness aptitude really control pandemic? Also, top comment OP right said people get active travel around state due temps going down. HAPPENS EVERY YEAR! forget existence snow birds specifically come winter season? something think about. Maybe think anxiety displaced exists, there’s getting around it, order understand pandemic, also understand widespread misinformation (on sides although don’t think mention main culprit) hysteria exists within population.

I agree, however, much emphasized numbers improving. considerably better before, really hope see improving miss things like normal, really do. Arizonans, can’t get distracted forget what’s stake here. keep pushing help communities remember real pandemic still happening, takes CONTINUOUS vigilance really stop spread feel good things like normal!

Stay safe fellow cactus buddies ❤️
Edit: “Snow bird” call someone state visits winter escape colder temps snow home. kid would become instant folk hero MAGA-heads US Lol, I’m glad I’m one thought headline little odd. he/she symptomatic? mask itslef little effect. 

you suoposed gathering large crowds using mass transit help right now, know, pandemic. even mask, threat covid, somehow keeping things, positive outcome. 

it steps mitigate oandemic fucked economy, pandemic itself. think everyone would fine millions dropped dead done nothing? economic effects could mitigated better actions people oants head retarded things like wesring mask. people mobile 


 Yes. I’d say that’s a) irrelevant topic b) rather high estimate (recent estimates HIT much lower classical). 

But importantly: article junk indicating kids spread virus lot. Exactly. knowingly go public positive diagnosis criminally charged.

The recommendations ""how"" following theblaw. law clear itnis illegalnto knowingly expose others infectous diseases Literally one saying that. thing back care. basically emergency babysitting another name. We've utilized kids, heavily subsidized spouse's employer. know better think people afford it. ☹️ Texas

This surprise me. lot states, cities, South call COVID-19 ""Hoax"".  Thanks reminding me. Now, don’t come back ever again, please?  Texas, fucking things up
Left right coordinated intentional disinformation campaigns effective. Sigh. live az kind agree rhyme_traveler. live city, people truly dont give shit. work retail, allowed bar entrance people wearing masks. get folks walking around day masks. retail one abides 6 foot rule either. work pet store without masks people get close im working. ask question, watch get fish, etc, physically step away almost everyone. facts aside, experience see coming from. little girl mask pulled down, sneeze cash stand yesterday. sad and, unfortunately, expected ends hilarious. maybe use cancer meds cure Covid? none young adults actually got sick. give Well good thing emptied safe see happening. say perfect, exists serves purpose ""some sort publicly funded child care"".

Also, child care general extremely important children's brain development. School structured way. Disregarding asinine. Yes. want protect Trump covid, means think covid dangerous him.

And course hypocritical avoid something dangerous, want people walk it. 

Like stay away rough street dangerous, send girlfriend go shopping. would hypocritical. say anti cancer medication vitro stopped replication virus. sounds promising! Surface transmission negligible best. Looks like plan towards herd immunity implemented town. bad far seems like immunity temporary. Kid spreads school, staff spreads around, kids take home, people home get take work, colleagues work take home, cycle repeats. fucking dumb shit? Schools open This. even know saying homework assignment use couple buzzwords half-assed argument? Especially don’t even know kid sick! arbitrary, meaningless dead disabled unable work.  Plus lot kids even show symptoms. types kids parents? fuck understand common tenant.

Fuck understand common landlord. can't get credit necessary mortgage.

That rent raise credit score. use give anyone pulse mortgage. caused housing crisis. I'm tired hate speech PoL. Reddit big problem landphobia CEO Cold Stone Creamery (from '95 to-'07 according wiki). forget parents also can't afford help taking day work, Trump puts billions taxpayer dollars pocket pockets fat friends, money could used stimulus us need help  love civil, rational response gets automatically deleted, dude gets keep comment up.

This subreddit joke. Meh, what's little organ damage, amirite? revolt tyranny democracy. join quest fight COVID-19 misinformation?

Together end disease. 

Let's begin re-educating u/AliensAreDemons. Must’ve low expectations. keep mind Italy, France Spain got hit early, nobody knew treat severe effects Covid-19. US damn low CFR, doctors using Europe's information worked didn't. next door neighbour beats kids, even sober enough pay attention them. DCF gets called her, smile wave.

Yeah one sounds like really easy call, one sounds really fucking dangerous. cut services bone there's much hard work eventually work gets done bullshit. 

The question American schools strict attendance? can't *all* job training instilling industrial discipline, must something else draconian work. think somebody said UV1 zone time kill like 9 hours. India needs help Pakistan successfully curve. terms UK mild year terms deaths, lower 5 year average months. excess deaths coronavirus, deaths exceeded excess deaths. also estimated around 2,000 deaths avoided due lock down. get one eventually, right becomes available. think time tell, willing shift stance based new information. I’m operating info available now. I’m anti-Vaxxer. staying inside anyway obvious reasons. don’t understand upset position. immunocompromised people household, don’t know making plenty assumptions. I’m done you. Calling people names arguments also effective. Get better communicating. Well done New Zealand. America, here's example. Statistics, probabilities. 10? D.C. i've heard low three. understand need protect kids would think communication parents would needed jump right CPS. point alarmist comment based single anecdote? Misperception risk - either way - makes bad policy. would it? kid one millions. literally first search result. countless pages recent days ago. would argue overabundance caution merrited considering Novel Virus still know little long term effects. also welcome take chances covid talking you. worried children. excuse shut-ins like Trump waiting for. He'll rush reopen borders. wife 11 year old hospital day laundry list life long ailments now. dad family members infected immediate damages, however remains seen long term. Bottom line need kids life long issues nightmare. People though, everywhere. country government even allowed instead masks despite knowing help. simple that. math, specifically? test entire white house 74 flu always?  test Obama? Bush? Clinton?

Umm... lost track discussion? keep mentioning old men, COMMENT COLLEGE AGED YOUNG ADULTS. 

Focus. Lmao. anyone explain lying COVID deaths benefits anyone, actual sources. Like Fauci getting paid Big COVID. Fuck Clinton’s, they’re literally war criminals benefit this? Please check drinking water lead.  think Fauci claimed would never died?
 
They wouldn’t died died Covid infection. That’s outrageous. What? Every virus get control herd immunity. That’s literally vaccines work, creating herd immunity? think we’ve never achieve herd immunity? prank, bro!!!!11 Dumb #Bullshit.

You're telling people died nursing homes (which lot death counts), would still alive today? Nah, buy it.

Seasonal flu wreck havoc crowds. Nice try. going 6 months now, many people places terminal cases would survived either way.

Death nice, need tell false truths, doctor.  It’s major inconvenience, isn’t Karen? Average life expectancy US skilled nursing facility 5 months. know complete stranger came door said ""my kid Covid, watch today go work?"" they'd slam door lock it.

Leftists love shutting free speech. Historically, great thing. think known long time one reasons people want decrease caseload idiots want party wear masks want destroy national security spending GDP unemployment benefits, government paid medical assistance unable draw army.  one. together ... “Owweew SHOCKER...” state daily announcements state CDC guy alone room, sign launguage person another room video pasted broadcast. months reporters phoned questions sent via email large enough room person 6' apart masked. long run safer around date shows 6' enough esp old buildings equally elderly hvac like many \ state buildings know states too.

Masks nice make economy run people need get back work businesses need reopen. We're like come Christmas Thanksgiving too? imagine Halloween already?  no1! 

Facts Yeah they’re super basic something wouldn’t surprised given people didn’t care never dealt similar project clueless. someone doctorate doesn’t mean they’re good following protocols. I‘m longer research arguments basic contamination post docs PIs would ever thought possible.

Edit clarity: fact testing kit project organized dealt poorly CDC doesn’t mean scientists terrible. Far it. shows failed put best brightest project, didn’t even bother putting someone charge keep everything track control. speaks lack leadership and/or political pressure get things done right, instead quarter assing ended with. Dumb question: tests horizon individual small business could afford? 

This crazy idea: buy \~100 tests. Go back guests/parties house. Cover charge $15 whatever. pay test wait around outside 15min whatever come in.

 Make prediction hospitalizations Nostradamus. every single link posted literally opened available data far sufficient enough conclude whether children may drive COVID-19 transmission, according Tribble. “Even holds true children carry much virus adults, automatically mean contagious likely spread disease,” Tribble says

in science, know information (again, coming outdated information) - assume things work out. especially pandemic. hence numerous studies posted react situation. again, conclusion outdated find spreading disease. look around USA

You're trained interpret science know stuff, start trust expertise this. topic become political guidelines put forth line scientific consensus. I'm giving reality things. yes, find months I'm right, hopefully hard way family. actually never made ""stupid prediction"" - I've made correct ones, along, literally dozens them. go comb comments past 6 months find I've never wrong. spend probably 5 hours day reading studies topic analyses. stupid predictions come laypeople people without relevant background, even random MDs nurses knowledge epidemiology infectious disease. background bioinformatics medicine, giving unique ability interpret data math/computer science background knowledge. years advising CDC working bioinformatics epidemiology pipelines tracing microbes/viruses gives unique skillset &lt;1% 1% people qualified have. guess give resume since read actual arguments. reason slow spread keep mutation rate low possible Yup know, get downvoted speaking truth. I'm paying extra everyone access birth control... own. 

This year made question usual support paying stupid high property tax mostly goes schools too. I'd argue education important society. I'm starting see schools little educating mostly daycare themselves. knocking teachers either, fault. Hmm, comparable.

Swaths people 180,000 figure death's door already. Sounds like suggesting using bleach injections agree whole speech makes sense. prolife ,he pro election say anything keep pro birth group (If call prolife, care life stopping abortions. 27 underlying health conditions

That know of. 

Plus seen COVID causes underlying health conditions people get past worst death isn’t reason careful know head cold kill survive Covid. Chiming put different spin things. Yes, absolutely, parents send kids school sick. also parents neglect send children school it’s seen school’s fault. 

I work credentialed educator California. (I’m home year kiddo) noticed lot people saying CPS called kid misses X amount days school. call reason, police welfare check kid ok shape, nothing happens. repercussions. 

I’ve worked school district attendance strict. high school students cut school missed certain amount days, parents could potentially ticketed fined. hearing everything. Parents *not* want pay fine. However message received student school.

I’ve also worked district wasn’t much attendance policy. District care kid missed lot school. family would get letters district follow through. Teachers email counselors admin, asking they’ve heard student. Staff investigate call welfare check. middle schooler literally supervision home, free come go pleased. Parent came school admin called home. Students would see student about, whatever wanted. student pretty much dropped out. could’ve done hundred welfare checks kid rarely ever home, nothing happened. Sometimes parent would answer door, sometimes one would all. Teachers loss help student *did* show up. kid wasn’t malnourished unclean, always brand new shoes. kid would show scooter school, suspended. Anyway, school’s hands tied frustrating one held accountable taking care student. district nothing. filed CPS reports genuine concern, CPS always kicked back local police. 

I said say...a lot schools trying best. can’t don’t resources better. whole covid thing sucks, it’s making inequities obvious. I've seen fiancée since March, EU/US borders closed and/or travel restricted risky. Sorry, idiots going parties, wearing masks social distancing add problem prolong everything get sympathy me. early prediction underestimate. We're going 300k end year, probably 350k-400k over, depending vaccine comes distributed. really good news considering five days ago ASU reported ~450 cases. one school Norfolk Nebraska 30% people tested positive covid.

If ever needed proof humans stupid, 2020 great year. That’s sad, many people live town? risk 40 year old woman dying roughly run car walking street. maybe, maybe, idea families needing two incomes make ends meet. olden days, mom would stay home, dad would go work. Kids get raised. they're old enough, mom re-enters work force. Vaccine viable people accept genetic editing. sure looked Moderna's vaccine theyre popular option (theyre using CRISPR afaik), certain efficient know covid similar coronaviruses continue mutate.... there's cure-all here. agree. term fearmonger often used mean ""spread fear"" instead proper definition ""unnecessarily spread exaggerate fear order manipulate"". covid cause fear? one of, biggest crisis lifetime. win? Trump said safe!! Peer reviewed Deep State. kindergartener kids’ school tested positive quarantined class week. Nothing else happened didn’t even make local news. Ummm wear dumb fucking mask virus killed 10,000 people.. keep listening guy back pocket clintons ""secret news sources"" too

Won't share though. secret.  No, worsening. ASU reported ~180 cases beginning August, ~450 cases August 27th ~800 cases today. lol called it. seriousness hope kids ok. must always account everything can, minimize error aware of. could case another 1000 related deaths unaware one reason, another 1000 another reason... see might add up. much kind shit needs happen lockdown time take seriously? love put 'science' quotes referring globally renowned scientist. So, did, didn't?

Kinda sounds like winged whole thing tbh. forget Gabba Gabba! Uchitel's co-chair, Marina Baluyeva, English-language teacher St Petersburg, drew parallels occasional weekends staff asked help clean-up work, saying work voluntary theory teachers decline work get trouble.

I'm actually wondering could happen US Trump announces emergency authorization unproven vaccine election.

In theory, voluntary freedom get shot, like always refuse wear mask. right see, teachers risk losing job refuse teach person. Wow. sick week year, guess makes people come work, sick. Great policy.

Two weeks holiday? wonder think country best, time go outside see isn't. First vaccinate Trump Republicans wait 6 weeks. deathrow inmates. cops, sex offenders three priests. wait another 2 weeks, everyone else. War Tide yall! mean Roll Eagle yall! Stop fake news! hoax! Trump 🇺🇸 Forever! still explained avoid judged harshly find workplace would allow it. guess 6% May ask didn’t move country free medical? Beside “my life BS” ITT: people *exactly* they're accusing others doing. like CDC made updates last week whole sub said listen them. 

For us trying right thing instead influence others whatever *we* think right thing is, confused. Everyone seems agenda desire control others. bad job suppressing reporting ... look excess deaths enough proof theory false. Else, would means 200k people suddently got diabete/hypertension/... span months. That's ridiculous. great time believe germ theory. I'm really curious, Westerners really care life like average person Xinjiang?

You're not, trying maintain system feeble sense superiority blaming CCP, which, put bluntly, means ""we're better you, we're better you!""

But moment man yells statements another moment afraid defeated

From Chinese man. Trumpism calling heaflines BS reporting news spite 3 weeks evidence contrary? What's bidenism then? Lol checked UNC dashboard 

Lord, 1000+ imaging America gov use half defense spending medical. would help many Americans. meant say Mexican Citizens can't cross states land allowed enter plane.

Well thank kindly, people outright search information online? spend 5 minutes end daily news scrolling names deceased?

I think people would take lot seriously saw actual names. I’d rather make effort donate clothes goodwill light fire. 

That point. I’ll gather shit, put bags, pay gas, take time drive there, donate unwanted stuff goodwill. Wow. completely totally missed point. anyway....

Take off. Work somewhere else. bra nazis. thing. fighting windmills. Literally nobody this. Go work without bra let's see someone complains. 

I understand bras uncomfortable. also understand nobody makes wear them, like nobody makes wear shirts. fact, people force wear shirts, wear bra. I've never seen sign says ""no shirts, shoes, bra, service."" fourth impeachment, ask me. fish flopping thoughts matter? Yeah. think approach cautiously. Like maybe armed forces first, cops. show signs weird stuff, try Trump, Republicans, sex offenders. Next, try remaining church members. wait couple months, try crooked deathrow killers, Democrats, next judges federal workers remaining. Next wait couple months vaccinated nurses doctors well teachers, janitors cleaning ladies. pilots flight attendants. UPS people, Uber gig workers. cooks, hair stylists, porn stars, finally neighbor Bob, cousin Ed, brother Fred, self, wife, kids world good, sons, little noisy bugger first. fine, daughter. Oh one priest abused kid yet, church member misunderstanding... let's talk it, he's enough shit fed it, plus car almost broke yesterday. Ah, lover Fred....oh shit, cousin! fair, virologist epidemiologist. downplayed March. started get worried figured US would things control end summer. Well we're here. things unpredictable average person. things practice social distancing, wear mask, wash hands thoroughly. No. 8% comorbidities. people ventilators died respiratory failure, caused Covid19. respiratory failure comorbidity, death certificate listing would 92%. 8% cases people died seemingly illness.  Probably depends current context. example, I’m sure ensure current shots immunizations, effectively thing question you’re asking. he’s traveling various places around world, probably much thorough review potential risks likelihood getting disease country, would either find medicine vaccine would reduce risk, rearrange schedule avoid areas active outbreak something. H1N1 back people country, Congress, White House fallen ill, I’m confident they’d regular testing, nothing else, try identify infection early possible. pay three weeks leave surgery ? sixk5pay / holiday ?

/s projections cities start surging month two.

I seen literally zero projections. Really. said would gone easter turned 6 million cases 180k dead people. said they'd done fantastic job despite literally almost every country planet Earth far, far better job. Lucky house panel we'd never know fibbing.

And Melania said guy type animal skin stapled head, paints skin orange, teeth white, lies height weight, authentic.

Did tell time live greatest country earth need assault rifle times feel safe? quick think Republicans office turn Trump loses next election? I've assuming literally entire United States turn months now. lost battle contain back February March. 


Mainly I'm watching see place reached 20-30% threshold gets re-spiked. takes time, money, effort harvest extra acreage you’re going see dime back. Lighting shit fire free. 

It literally cost less farmer light crop can’t sell fire harvest give away. 

If pay donate clothes goodwill, would you? It’s easier cheaper throw away.  exactly right. colds circulate frequently endemic like many viruses. come around yearly. EVERY SINGLE YEAR. That's one strong immunity. Makes sense asymptomatic rate high. Yet another Trumpism. scientists right?

Several places predicted hundreds thousands deaths late Aug. Never happened.

Likewise, Fauci predicted something retarded like 100,000 cases released news PCR sensitive testing, never peaked 70000 day cases 50k good 2 weeks now.

Oh obligatory note cases/deaths/pos%/ hospitals hot spot states declining naturally good month half.

Literally, seasonality / flu season angle last bastion hope doomers. Narrator: bad idea. Thats fine, keep isolated, alive well. reason make rest us suffer. LOL .3% fatality rate age group = I'm safe I'm living life. nearly thing ever wear bra know that. Please try suggestion sometime. understand then. like think fairly open-minded even bother reading this, guys? get feeling another wall whiny ignorant bullshit. still something let 50% population constantly suffer over. many things unsure concerning COVID, pretty good idea initial growth curve looked like predict would happened without intervention.

In US, Roughly 15 million would infected end March 200 million end April. Close 2/3rds population. effects heterogeneity spread likely reduced herd immunity threshold current timeline would heavily muted fast spread. know mortality rate first wave. 1-2 million would died. fear lingering alarmist; looking reality.

Had “locked down” say half hard, reducing transmission 1/3 instead 2/3rds would still terrible result: upwards million dead burned us.

These extremely realistic scenarios indicated behaviors. behaviors realistic? don’t know. can’t imagine everyone going normal business April level incidence there. 

It’s said many times, think still often appreciated: exponential growth scary. like car accident something? Yeah.. ""passive income"" residential real estate bubble burst... many people highly leveraged absolutely bleeding out. sorry say money waiting sidelines foreclosures throwing ridiculously low bids places sale area last 2 weeks. hoping catch desperation. also joined group guys scouting commercial real estate underwater trying buy people's distressed properties banks force hand.. might sound predatory, literally many made fortunes 2008 housing bubble. Literally MILLIONS kids going die stupidity. Fuck shit Gotta love TX. ""science teacher"" also reccomend taking HCQ bleach chaser? Let's play game called daddy serve carriers disease nonetheless, spread older folks keeping things simple quick Good Morning America. delivered core info.

The rest takes longer explain. Viruses don’t kill people; wreckage cause body actual cause death. 

So, accurately, 6% death certificates showing Covid likely filled coroner didn’t autopsy results refer to. 

Autopsies actually performed rarely days, especially financially-challenged municipalities counties. 

They knew corpse positive Covid-19 may know course illness typical Covid, whatever reason (expediency, etc) wrote Covid instead organ failure ARDS stroke whatever actual cause death. school offers online option. option continuation school, student would forced stay even things returned used be, restart year, next year. arguing ""being cautious"" (ie: forced closured stores, loss jobs, failed UI states, mass depression) consequences? There’s coherent strategy testing - asymptomatic not. wasn’t downplaying it, trying optimistic. obvious appreciated it. didn’t kill people. 

He never told anyone inject bleach. far know, one did. extra deaths. 

Unproven medicine? repeating doctors scientists said minutes earlier. one given hydroxychloriquine trump recommended it. extra deaths. 

None rest points caused extra deaths either. 

The good point wearing mask, agree there. rest noise cause additional deaths. 

In fact, argued closing borders early may *saved* many deaths. original estimates 1-2 *million*. None mentioned changes shortcomings remote learning. What's plan? Wish option WFH, back office since beginning July, “appropriate” protections place. waiting entire place get hit Covid eventually! Statistics twit. complete dweeb remarkably poorly educated. home owner considering subdividing house large (and lot considering average home size America 2,600 sqft so), don’t think law saying tenants don’t pay rent would factor decision whether put housing supply market?

Asking friend...  Lithium would massive positive efficacy coronavirus viable treatment considering strong side effects. going unending stories children dying coronavirus exposed school, stories children accidentally giving parents grandparents killing them.

The number casualties directly related schools reopening hundreds, thousands.

All help man get re-elected, *actually handling pandemic* would gotten re-elected much easily. course do. last time many people cared many people died anything covid? This. deaths counted previous plagues looked many people died average. counting too.

But would increase totals. Jesus guys ever give weak shit up?

Donald Trump said sorts wild shit past 7 months. hold hard fast that?

Did inject bleach said so?

No, didn't, brain. Use bruh. photo sums article I'm surprised NYC going school soon person.

In New Jersey online instruction reevaluating October 12th also interesting question regarding Lagom (I'm also Argentinian). I've Sweden 1.5 years Tegnell gave nice definition it. Good questions indeed OMG panic run!!! 99% survival rate. news? I've seen misinformation every news channel I've watched regardless political leanings. misinformation seems come people's Facebook posts links news media, scientific backing ""reposted friend"". Clear springs baby 30 days later looks like Denmark well 100 cases per day, didn’t work None scientific publications current posted. Please carefully re-read post reply non-scientific information counter science. pointed know enough still already, current evidence cases revealing children spread virus. I'd willing bet month, people ignore preliminary evidence science children spreading comes light, lot people arguing one people saying obvious along simply known. pandemic, plan worst case scenarios, given history past pandemics know right move shut schools.

Your replies include article completely outdated studies bad information, opinion article format (2nd link)... post concludes things (1st study, led Ann Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital Chicago, found children younger five may host nearly 100 times viral load coronavirus upper respiratory tracts adults. Meanwhile, ages 5-17 least amount infected adults.  findings consistent earlier study Germany included 47 infected children ages 1 don’t fully understand extent kids fuel transmission, studies like indicate it’s certainly possible role. reminds us much still unknown virus.”

3rd link opinion article 2 sources early July. One source opinion article two pediatricians experts epidemiology small number patients rely on. also conclude children spread virus, says ""aren't blame"", meaning can't say yet major source spreading... become one IMO send back schools like this, due contacts they'll having, whereas summer, children contact family children. Hence entire post proving this... again, many past pandemics show true.

C'mon man. waste time, actually read posts ask shitty statistics diseases. almost like diseases cause older people die higher rate ignore numbers unless certified asshole. Missing point. someone dies day turn 80 covid instead 6 months later covid picture, really matter died covid. honest yourself. It’s like schools everywhere months implement robust learning experience people involved. metric? deaths per millions. 

They're top 10 deaths per million....

Why wait 2021.

However, saying include people infected COVID badly formulated. Excess death said ""include people"" since statistic. cannot linked particular death. **Literally everyone:** ""Hey Florida testing seems dropping rather dramatically, happen""  
**Florida:** ""No that's cause less people getting sick!""  
...

They may well find eating gold dust cures Covid-19. cheaper, available, less damaging body. kids distance learning, way I'm messing around this. school district uses Google Classroom pretty heavily got Chromebooks (cheap refurbished Dell CB).

But real world - rather idealized egalitarian fantasy everyone willing make sacrifices sake others - shutting world economy will, 100% time, lead people sliding poverty starvation.

Walter Whites save diabetic patients situation.  hope every single one people found CCTV charged terroristic threatening. “dramatically less likely” mean? dramatically likely sentence?

Millions form chin strap masks ship 3 hours north Green Bay please I’ll sign Oh interesting, elsewhere website mention they're trying see drugs used treat kitty corona virus, also called FIP (which around while) work fight Covid 19 Yeah right, I'll believe see it. Nothing happened 08/09. always question validity. validity tanks worry. want say basically data coming since outbreak China supporting information lockdown? data hidden? Can't block numbers?
If already house use credit mean win system? Unfortunately anecdote sample size one misinterpretation statistics makes useless.

I found interesting misinterpretation even apply case, decided go town anyways. True, COVID long-hauler, totally understand virus devastating impacts one's health even lucky enough survive it. also several autoimmune conditions, would like see effect vaccine people similar conditions (which would assume look phase 3 trial). people I'm sure they're safe, extra careful immune system try kill me.

Edit add: wonder biggest risk would vaccine effective hope getting vaccinated would give people false sense security? many angles think vaccines I've never considered year. Every vaccine I've ever tried tested years it. lockdowns. evil idiots don’t want lose money order make profit absolutely nothing.

They would rather go waste give away. People work together. People get food distributed. It’s lockdowns. Coronavirus **NONSTOP**

Damn Hamilton scientific journals forbid use ""sacrifice"". like use euphemisms like that. expect use word ""kill"", accurate, sounds kinda abrupt.  It’s hard maintain type factual narrative even president willing tweet CDC changed death toll covid19 9000 Twitter take misinformation. really listening.

What statistics think realistic?

Its genuine question. felt last response alot discussion, alot less combative. understand that’s science works observation jaded others. bizarre read. Just. Because. You. Type. Like. This. Doesn’t. Make. It. Fact. one knows yet none things make Hitler Nazi,nor necessarily even lead that.

Edit: Good, good, let hate flow you! Yup. came say that. like Google calendar alert administration set first day semester go right students get refund. seen data yet regarding compared age groups. Alright, slow here. mRNA viruses going encode DNA. bodies don’t capability, did, imagine actual RNA virus took protein would us.

Moderna injected mRNA viruses clinical trials starting 8 years ago. think good idea long term ramifications technology point. need make sure one works safer alternative, getting COVID. makes logical sense initial viral load would make big impact. would imagine intuitively initial viral load entry point viral replication would quickly FAR outweigh viral load regardless initial load. doubting research, it’s intuitive me. originally replying to: ""The [US war 227 years including many based complete lies (both Iraq wars), torture black sites, recent history.

I personally think qualifies ""short period time"".""

If u wish trace original content post, mentioning anything besides whether 100 days covid death whataboutism. original topic relation whether china oppresses people usa always war hongkong. None relation whether data truth lie. You.  know funny people accuse China (and I'm sure are) make numbers look better turn blind eye it. 

And funny mean infuriating. SF pretty dead moment too, empty office buildings, lot workers moving cheaper places. Credit card transactions 80% Financial District compared time last year. Massive evictions looming/people abandoning lease.

I'm pretty stoked 700 people vaccinated. could actually make big difference town 60k  point is? scroll 1200 credits every movie show watch, makes worse?

I suggesting someone read names verbally, decent enough scroll list names every day people totally forgotten simple numbers.

This would also help people mourning lost loved ones, also help others take situation much seriously. problem virus going nowhere, second countries reopen, virus resurges, public trust containment strategies falls (what we've seeing Israel, Spain, Germany). 

By impose strict measures since beginning, Sweden afford continuation protocol much longer.

I'd never know, IBS gang here. seem impression racists find way co-opt it. expected since states reopening schools resumed. "" going blame every death flu season usa genetically traced spanish flu?

""After that, blame ur nation's incompetence."" both?

Trump Republican party morons, think pre-existing condition, made us weak virus China's irresponsibility let world.

EDIT: Actually, refresh memory make sure conclusive link pinning ""Spanish"" flu America, found article various historians saying strong chance 1918 flu, too, originated China:  hey, delusions convincing anyone. almost much hope people like even read write contemplate upon it, alas endeavor i'm masturbatory smartass, can't help it.

i genuinely qualm family's readiness sacrifice covid, realize can't speak everyone, right? glib attitude endanger rob others agency (to want die covid), right? recognize statistics faulty, addition deaths, people crippled virus, right? annoys discount even that, shows complete indifference lives others.

Try here: would compare something like similar car accidents (COVID).... 96% people don’t wear seatbelts (old age morbidly obese) die car accidents.

Whereas wearing seatbelt (being younger physically fit) 6% chance dying.   really. seeing massive escalations sickness within house hold. 1 person gets sick, everyone house wearing mask, yet get relatively level illness despite sitting ""high viral load"" situations.

James Mason University Virginia. motivation protecting people asymptomatic/presymptomatic, could us.

Masks, even good kind properly worn, offer much less protection to-the-wearer from-the-wearer.

People realizing walking around without masks thinking risking themselves, that's business. Knowing neighborhood, I've kind surprised active cases there. folks still live area, best health, terrifies way get there. Actually, FDA looking 100% (no vaccine 100% effective) ironically, [they already adopted 50% efficacy threshold phase 3 

Unfortunately, takes time gather sufficient data establish even 50% efficacy rate. students tested positive. almost certainly many students asymptomatic get tested. 

Also, 1% population test positive last 2 weeks pretty freaking huge outbreak. comparison, entire US less 2% test positive since start pandemic. Uh, ok...ye...rig...

why new study can. ban pandemic theatre. imagine sad life troll subreddits intention answering anything backing claims. thats said troll. Troll.  Yes bad, 21/8 3 deaths, already 1 death reported before. +2 day. absolutely nothing base gut feeling March we’ll start fully open Memorial Day we’ll back full normalcy. nothing base on, gut feeling based vaccine treatment news. Patience. turn coming. It’s obvious didn’t read article CDC report *all comorbidities pre-existing conditions listed death certs* that’s % people died due Covid lowered 6%. 

I can’t conversation someone refuses basic information provided article. I’m sure mean comforting. 6% chance death huge. Racism used exist. still sort does, USA confined couple southern states, even hardly real. Seriously though, can't go back using reusable bags? Surface transmission huge issue virus. Banning reusable bags enforcing masks letting people breathe back asswards. Ohio, confirm hometowns community Facebook page absolutely inundated right-wing conspiracy articles death toll faked. dad cancer parents taking lockdown seriously. want safe dad to, idk, go grocery store again. I’m frustrated. well CDC, so.. Kinda understandable 165 days. People need work living. blame them. Keep us rest world get shit together. vital crucial things happening right now, know Karaoke one them. I'm lucky little I'm mean man village goes round long stick wacking school starts tomorrow here. think improving. 10k tests yesterday deaths flat weeks ago cases flat. expect hospitalizations deaths follow trend done every single state come it.  positivity rate 40%, lockdown name only. kind positivity possible lockdown. people going around place kinds ways. I’ll quarantine 2 months could get NZ live it’s giant joke. BMJ article called ""Clinical characteristics children young people admitted hospital covid-19."" 

18% requiring critical care children either seen family doctor, called ambulance, attended hospital, told need kept in. Probably around 0.25% symptomatic Covid cases require hospitalization therefore odds child requiring critical care 1 2,000 (and includes children underlying health conditions makes much vulnerable). actually help raising awarness, give one one, people read. Hope 50 cents used well. No, never. That's medical tyranny.  Actually biggest downside participating trails. think vaccines perfectly safe, danger adverse side effect (other fever sore arm) low. may stuck, unvaccinated, waiting enough control group get infected trial end.  
We trial Universities. 1,000 kids 36,000 already infected week in, we'd results really fast. Active cases rising since schools reopened, alarming rate, rate would expect economy reopening graphs article literally make opposite point.

The states they're talking cases couple extra cases look like huge jump. Finally common sense Good job New Zealand! Great see protective measures effective squashing flare ups COVID. 

I currently live area cases hopeful see there's another surge. Different phase levels based number local active cases seem best option world gets control. vaccines reach phase 3 fail-a significant chunk do, that's 20%, majority. Furthermore, lumping decades vaccine development neither present day technology knowledge human body currently have. 

Also, vaccines pop thin air. front runners based years work done SARS MERS. Oxford's, example, already developed went initial lab testing MERS vaccine, tweaked covid. Moderna worked platform mRNA vaccines decade also previously developed one SARS. vaccines taken years develop. still holds true. known coronaviruses threat years.

I fan Trump, paying attention since start. timeline least Oxford Moderna originally fall changed. fact, actually gotten delayed.

If paying attention process start, would known this. Step right get kill gates vaccine help fraudci. Set make billions dollars Yeah statistics funny way. pretty much spin statistics say anything want to, wording perspective give. Well, duh. lockdown correctly, really lockdown. offer irrefutable proof idiocy. Except healthy people age 70 chances ending like photo right extremely rare. Reminds anti-drug PSAs 90s.  RGB window go? It’s interesting thinks tell future. Lockdowns avoided German people able keep virus control, stating certainty kind dumb possibly know whether case? Good, get us herd immunity faster.  anyone still listening guy who? complete fraud. Thankful parents Scottsdale total morons *I* California lol. No, article written MAY. Stage 2 trials early days world vaccine testing. We'll know less 6 months now. people self-centered lazy. care anything else.

If slightest inconvenience, ditch whatever feet.

Heck, can't count number times I've cleaned-up people office. Several times day, everyday. exactly plan continue wearing masks public getting vaccinated cases basically disappear. 

Immunolgist/disease experts reddit please correct I'm wrong. I'm expert immunology, seems me, even immune could pickup spread airborne disease little while. office someone sick like immune system kill every covid particle enters body immediately, end breathing would think. Besides get exposed much viral load immune system may able keep even vaccine, especially people get sick easily. I'll keep mask especially protect 2 month old niece I'm guessing able get vaccine time soon. copy south Korea. trade one effective measure (work home) less effective measure (masks)? That's nearly many cases entire country Canada yesterday. Yup totally worth 50 million unemployed , economy destroyed. Sounds totally worth me. 

For 9200 deaths 90% false positive rate Judging response didnt even read comment. interpretation, trying explain death certificates someone refuses learn. suspect indoor smoking bans far reduce rates, hard say sure. alma mater, glorious. wonder one Trustees owns real estate company rents students like Univ. Michigan (look story up). makes sense me. mean, I'm religious slightest. seems evident that, example, science tell us excruciating detail nuclear bomb works. can't tell us dropped it, created - pretend to.

I realised read Stephen Hawking's ""Brief History Time"". posits time understand began big bang, truly singularity, never measure, ever hope find evidence came (otherwise singularity, theories go hell quickly). perspective, unknowable unmeasurable. could random occurrence, could old man sat cloud banging rocks together - cannot know cannot tell.

So people prefer replace unknowables faith, difference make either us? means god time chat (yet?). mean we're actually conflict.

But people try replace knowables faith, I'll admit get really cranky really fast.

(It's since read last, iirc Hawking also mentioned certain values strayed far either direction, universe know simply exist. someone wanted claim God picked numbers - mind that'd sensible application faith. like better suggestions. someone wanted claim values so, I'd like see evidence.) Hahaha. Can't let truth get out. fraud Okay, I'll go step step 
 SARS-1 Vaccine? I'm aware of;
 
This correct, SARS-1 exist anymore. contained shown since initial pandemic
 still prevalent Asian regions
 
In case likely thinking MERS. True there's vaccine that's due show often difficult test vaccines for. Oxford one used Covid intended MERS
  fact, believe long COVID-19 SARS outbreak Korea.
  
You're gonna show source one said, SARS effectively eradicated would news hear one modern 10s June 2021 maybe, fuck. Yeah, I'm person get vaccine, chances getting also near zero actually zero individual risk. Top. Men.  selfish attitude life hasn’t “moved on” parts country. could now, selfish pricks like mediocre cheeseburger BBQ won’t stop spreading. 

Enjoy LIVING short life. middle, might halfway Well one time misunderstood one person saying Uncle misquoted Facebook?

Checkmate, sheep. could disagree more. real evidence earth flat. Vaccines may 99.9% safe, 99.9% 100%. get vaccinated provides us, collectively, safer world. fact remains there's slight risk severe side effects vaccines. 

You're missing point here, today's anti vax crowd good point, we'd fueling massive increase numbers allowing less safe normal vaccine go public use. Vaccines individual risk. accept risk collective individual benefits. Increasing risk, changes calculus. That’s interesting point. point know placebo. saw earlier study stated (if reference elderly 65+ crowd) would lived another 10 years average. people deathbeds people Hospice got covid hospice. maryland. philly. damn might drive maryland seat dinner. guy working ass get philly point reopening things. fucktards Philly would put fucking mask nose. might Sturgis like two-three weeks ago Since ""real talk"". many college students serious cases? keep seeing Alabama 1000 cases, looking UAB's hospital numbers....they decreasing still. Maybe bit early hospitalization, least students pretty isolated young people. please go see Grandma weekend. like we're learning children smaller humans vulnerable meaning human virus infect them. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Another example country takes seriously protect citizens. want moderna one bad, I’m black live near Vanderbilt obviously near viral hotspot, young healthy get picked apparently. Yeah developed world. blow much shit people think are. Anyone rural parts country knows 3rd world nation Gucci belt. There’s also issue people without kind experience epidemiology expecting disaster-movie like numbers, actual numbers keeping experts awake night don’t sound like big deal average Joe. 

Less 1% college campus doesn’t sound like huge number. consider many people may virus haven’t gotten tested, close together kids live quickly exponential spread happens, may already late head absolutely enormous outbreak. Man I'm SA tons people give fuck. suppose part city could play big difference end different parts town regular see everywhere. Places like Alamo Heights tend better even still people caring. guns  resource showing otherwise? I’m open learning. First look online validated stated.

Looked find articles stating issues developing effectiveness it’s still around...let know anything follow wrong was. Oxford begun Phase 3 trials, expect preliminary results least Thanksgiving. However, expecting follow subjects two years. 

There mention emergency authorization, skipping standard FDA Approvals process, would presumably see vaccine available potentially Christmas. 

In short, no. trust something authorized 2 months data collection. one, enough time. Two, enough subjects. Subject enrollment screening would still ongoing, sample size would be, opinion, small feel comfortable. 

Regardless vaccine, would still require strict nationwide quarantine protocols (mask wearing, social distancing) A. vaccine widely administered B. vaccine proven effective long-term. Without continuing distancing mask use, run risk furthering spread due false sense security. hometown’s community page sharing articles sketchy right-wing conspiracy site like crazy talking death toll slashed. second tried share article legitimate news source, declined posted group. makes blood boil. don’t understand many people resistant fact. want life back without virus. tired. get heparin injections every two weeks part chemo treatment. infusion, chest port gets flushed saline injected heparin keep blood clotting device I'm treatments. I’m wondering high cases ACTUALLY suppression taken account current stats school enrollment 600.

Given level community spread, would expect least show infected.

The question asking else missed. particular kid surely one. REALLY getting zero waste groove. really reduced plastic intake earlier year. great bulk buying bags jars, bringing bag, etc....and now??? like plastic produced completely disregarded earlier year. sad.

i cant wait bulk buy again. much cheaper. Duh? lol hear lot.

So helps them? 

do people stay home get stimulus checks? 

do think people eat get stay home?

please give us details plan. stuck yet. Intake initial draw 9th. I’m still astounded ongoing crisis many months daily avalanche information data definitely shifting evolving understandings things work. days felt like weeks. Weeks felt like months. It’s hard remember lot specific details first learned them. yet, somehow, never ending deluge information thing people gleaned “I remember one time said don’t wear mask.”

Does perpetual facepalm count effective mask? facts going death certs CDC report. 

The science referring basic understanding correlation vs causation, illnesses progress. 

“Other conditions upon death” literally listed additional causes death. point wrong read actual CDC report understand that. 

I basing comments CDC reported. don’t believe CDC report, operating facts. 

I can’t respond comment interpretation viewpoint rather data provided article. using objective information. using subjective. aren’t speaking language. Wow. That's quite spike. dramatically changed testing methodology though, yes? pushing community testing? know graph positivity rate available somewhere? side effects been? What's point making distinction hundreds thousands people 55 years old, chronic health condition that, itself, spell death person? telling 44 year old Susan genetically inherited type 1 diabetes, exercises maintains health weight, died diabetes? contracted SARS-CoV-2, would still alive!

It matter COD could technically pancreatic failure. virus, would alive, meaning yes, die COVID-19. Peaceful walking minding business nude.""peaceful"" walking helicoptering dick pissing collection plate let get straight: praises China it’s response essentially, “lock things”. saying half-measures ok people live it?

The praise China locking things down.

The WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, applauded “transparency” Chinese response. There's really big difference ""sharing data"" ""locking things down"".  

 [Not everyone pisses someone Twitter want beginning, [WHO technical guidance indicated countries enact measures quarantine points  countries that. instead closed borders created lists countries safe safe. biggest problem ""safe/not safe"" closed border model incredible number exceptions! instead outbreaks managed borders, entire community lives threat infection.

My ""covid hoax"" buddy time life yelling ""toldya so!"" everyone knows. guess 200k dead people great success him, that's fake nudes anyway, right?

Hopefully winter knock us asses again. Tell states universally masking since lockdown. fun economy going shit spread ends sending lot older people indoors. Guess - fuckers need economy much younger people do.

We're together whether like not. one asks? Idk live every time news station much mentions amount cases I'm every slack jawed maga fanatic overflowing comments section questions, calling conspiracy, saying we're living tyranny, etc. hit anywhere else first could learned lessons. Oh well. Hmm something, thought something. elite need rat race keep rich. guess value there. Maybe change people unknowing slaves. want see better world suffering. So, things like vaccine made - interacts body, perhaps find safe route safely get things done. say ""but need take test subject, monkey body"" -- realize, called 'monkey body' belongs SOMEONE using body. Maybe like child perhaps, making people suffer - period. NO. find another way! -- 3D printed organs function similarly perhaps -- oh another completely ordinary option like understand organs body, they're usually made such, chemical composition, map entire body, literally guess want body, vaccine react perhaps -- need do, understand things work. saying 'need test subject' -- saying 'can never make educated guess', hmm tipping single domino perhaps would lead setting chain reaction (understanding entire body work -- KNOW everything body, predicting happen).

Like need 'test anything' -- get right first time, actually know doing. THINK head, get right first time. Think, perhaps placing thin piece wood two buildings - try stand it, would PROBABLY break it, need put wood first place, need 'test it', perhaps maybe placing much thicker reinforced wood panel two buildings would suffice -- getting right first time! Six months later, ""Hey, whatever happened people? heard now."" know concerned wanted update you. cases wedding shower 🤷🏻‍♂️ 1500 hours September normal? get this? shut again. obviously get go.  Imagine much better would handled countries' leadership put aside pride actually took steps early encourage social distancing provide economic stimuli businesses gluttonous corporations. can’t tell anything. saying bad idea produce vaccines ahead time? Why? one gets approved, surely would better supply ready go soon possible?
 
Yeah, could fail, that's whole point producing risk. sort one big parts OWS many vaccine producers around world, notably Serum Institute India mixed feelings this... system change enough people care issue, maybe good thing future US. hand human wonder afford buy medicine they'll die. That's heartbreaking, seems shocking first world country. insulin black market sounds dystopian, 2020 weird year. 

I've never thought much Americans buying medicine Canada thing, thought joke anything. anyone explain cheaper buy medicine visit doctors without insurance thing US? good advert Based I’ve read it’s far gone stop virus. window window closed. it’s managing it, real indicator good management well health system coping load.  issue college kids going hospitals parents grandparents. many times say person uses toilet, followed person B, B get virus via aerosols spread flushing toilet. That's fecal-oral transmission. enclosed chamber active ventilation (like communal slum toilets), people using toilet hours person susceptible infection. HIT slow mode transmission. person coughs presence person B 15-minute conversation transmits virus, that's contact transmission. Meeting HIT slows spread via contact transmission people limited no. contacts mass transmission requires intermediate carriers i.e. B C ..etc. people recover infection, longer efficient transmitters.

And antibodies fade 3 months. See Thats extremely expensive comparison see troll fell trolls trolling comment. never intended answering anything came here. came spread nonsense. Well played trolll lot unpleasant news stories start “one third Americans...” Media always goes scarier headline people click it. deaths cases. live headline months ago 50% rise deaths...we went 4 6. wish said willing stop virus. can't, willing it. always making healthy lifestyle choices...

For millions working poor Americans disenfranchised communities, access healthy food options stunningly limited and/or unaffordable. ability go gym, even time bother also limited stress associated working 2-3 jobs keep roof one's head leads sleep deprivation, anxiety disorders, cardiovascular diseases often come those. even possible? insurances yearly deductible, around 5k-10k max. could paid much more? Let ask two questions. Lets put aside thousand years medical history assume natural herd immunity possible:

Since herd immunity means gotten can't get lack spread community, account examples article like NY, people come community large scale (tourists, business people, people relocating there, transportation hub air travel, etc). Even can't spread within original native population there, NYers really isolated people communities. 

2) places cite perhaps best examples this, utter tragedy terms loss life, financial disruption. That's WORST CASES SCENARIO, even reached real herd immunity yet. 

For US, would mean multiple millions dead many long-term problems. strategy - rather, thing try avoid. weeks ago mentioned 70 person wedding shower threw cal. cases. I’m “Covid hoax” person “it’s still possible live life person.” People forget fast things parents knew diseases. Prior vaccines becoming available diseases, ""herd immunity"" strategy, especially diseases relatively mild childhood, deadly adults. good reason grandparents hosted ""chicken pox"" parties babies toddlers, crazy. child rash fever much preferable young older adult brain swelling. 

When small pox still circulating, 2 major strains Variola Major variola minor.  people would find less severe, variola minor, strain circulating, would deliberately infect protect deadly strain. partially reason North America colonizers faired better native people small pox epidemics. variola minor dominant strain amongst colonizers due selection pressure deliberate infections caused, variola major dominant strain amongst native people. people discovered even less severe cowpox also delivered cross immunity, infected instead. would today's vaccines without yesterday's ""herd immunity"" strategies. 

If vaccinations available covid past, would smart find least-severe strains spread deliberately, find least severe mutations cause severe common cold. bet someone slipped quarantine. snuck meet someone, exempt list (flight crews), quarantine authority forgot test them.  ... don’t think many people going Mexico Canada healthcare... Enjoy high bills then

You sure showed everyone! sad people can't afford healthcare US go countries. mention m4a democratic leadership. Pelosi: ""That never happen"". I'm sure follow country talking about? I'm saying America set precedent business kill customers, environment workers without regulation. Got good reading too. strangest case dr. Brinkley great depression (formation AMA)

For instance, little bumfuck town bars getting shut ignoring mask rules. osha liquor control board heading that. Ok sure.  70 million obese people country certainly doesn’t hurt. Lol. fun. Please continue mind votes. I've got 200k magical unicorn internet points going go away anyone seriously surprised that, like every communicable virus exposed to, kids able spread covid?

A LOT people serious denial concerning disease. They've told hoax, masks hurt ability breath build CO^2 behind mask.

Both obviously bullshit dead people appear nowhere, plenty people job day long mask on.

These people told children ""practically immune"" disease (more bullshit), thinking goes like; ""if children practically immune? spreading it"". even bullshit. 

It might take minutes Googletime find several news reports kids partied parents died shortly afterwards. kid want carry Rock Guilt rest lives?

But denial continue. all. Trials critical. 100 percent share concern vaccine approved determined safe effective -- data made public call _all_ review it.

But makes sense world put money line manufacture vaccine candidate ahead time might thrown away.

We wait trials. That's non negotiable. take advantage time prepare manufacture vaccine approved months behind terms producing whatever vaccines pass phase mistaken impression trials serve purpose.

These people far between. I’m going ask third time please stop insulting me. could said Disneyworld already explained CDC say think said. forget? Yeah, well design business model rigid fail face adversity, deserve fail. figure gum owners worried businesses would close could make special arrangements, problem solving everyone guess.  give Republicans ideas. Oh suggest "" better solution"" . dont care explain works... Maybe realized stupid.. question nonsense. wrote response,THAT NONSENSE. clearly fear mongering schools starting open back again, headline intentionally sensationalized drum ever present fear mythical asymptomatic super spreader. could *anyone,* all. truth is, people don’t seem get, can’t stop virus. course people going keep getting infected - point manage infections controlled manner possible overwhelm hospital systems. College-aged kids low risk. Those, any, trouble virus treated hospital. 

If hospitals become overwhelmed, news. bank transfers? Always felt like march could really driven ground speaking another user earlier said nobody alive knows play think that’s stance I’m going take Even they're saying straight hoaxmanship, arent pointing causes might corruption outright blowing numbers, like legit false positives multiple reports one case. arent contributing TON, trying pretend arent factors bringing numbers fuels mistrust conspiracy theorism. Yes comparing trough national FLA.

You check google’s data well. corroborates claim using different collection methods, way vague iffy. I’m talking towns wouldn’t let unless lived left couldn’t return. way pretended pandemic beginning February? amazing far went piss China off. ones dying. usually asymptomatic run around spreading germs without masks. Youre ones killing older people. delete number 3 spot on. Waddaya mean germany arrests people wearing nazi flags, storming political facilities threatening kill people?! would things, think answer. /s add on, there's vaccine MERS vaccine tested need large quantities people infected test it. potential vaccine MERS luckily infect large group people needed progress further.

&amp;#x200B;

However, MERS vaccine gave us good foundation build COVID vaccine infected world. apologies misleading.

I’ll correct post. also feedback you, since you’re giving unsolicited feedback ,I feel it’s appropriate same.

Your judgement based language callouts wrong-doing devoid would create positive change another. truly wish influence change, suggest coming place compassion uses acknowledgement also generating awareness.

Calling sad wrong isn’t say. I’ve large proponent safety education entire life. I’ve also read average hour day regarding covid since March like (so seems), exhausted seeing pure misinformation spread causes danger contributes serious issue globally.

My interests covid taking care communities also working bring awareness others. we're still discussions 100k died since.  Got thank you! excess deaths covid deaths though, I'd bet LOT hunger deaths people getting care medical issues Look, dont need obsessed him, ignoring problem make go away. Fucking criminals Would love to, could pitch colosseum population reduction ideas. think coworker said hints another major issue America...

Due cost healthcare uneven access insurance help afford routine check ups testing, millions Americans may chronic illnesses like High Blood Pressure never gotten diagnosed due able/ willing go routine medical check-ups anything emergency. Herd immunity lead 2 million deaths US argument tired. 183,000+ people died COVID-related issues. level data compare that. zombie Herman Cain said so, would lie? Don’t cancer drugs kill shit everything? I'm Ontario Preimer decided cut sick days three year. absolutely ridiculous. first year happened got really sick January used days first couple weeks year. Thankfully job lets us accrue 10 paid sick days year, lot jobs know people written daring sick 4 5 days entire year. 

Things little lax since COVID least. Yes, found places going improve degree eventually. things start improving slightly one region mean hoax. Hoaxes improve cuz they're real. Okay well I'm glad know better Yes. afraid children 👧🧒👦😱👻 (insert spooky sounds someone flicking lights on) Swedish research puts IFR whole 0-69 yrs bracket 0.09% younger people number drastically lower... read comments see actually agree overall. read entire thread, you’d see originally stated 94% people died Covid causes death listed, vast majority probably would died without getting Covid. listed Sepsis great example, that’s typically caused things like breathing tubes. patient enters hospital Covid could die sepsis... actually Covid caused death. Alzheimer’s.

The comments referring jumped person didn’t believe 6% people could died simply Covid health problems listed. seems like, comments, agree commenter, since you’re saying admin writes whatever death certificate. 6% might valid opinion. However, reading comments, actually think agree Covid main killer here, sepsis/Alzheimer’s/diabetes etc. 

I would appreciate would actually read thread next time resort name calling you’re trying pick fight someone agrees 99% issue ✌️ never one appropriately begin with... 


It takes time spread, testing, contact tracing, confirmation media attention. suspect we'll see coming weeks. Absolutely correct wondering states governors might look study see mask protect others. bring students back testing like Illinois successfully. Shame work. Bring ground outside. global warming, diseases plagues going get common. shit chills long enough I'm getting fuck third world country dressed first world one. want around next public health crisis. ADVOCATE WHIPPING SICK PEOPLE?!? It’s called summer break missed couple months. year school grand scheme things big deal considering consequences reopening White House opens back walking tours it’s fucking safe.

It’s need know everyone. Doomers basically reverting grade school behavior point. excited finally happening they're going fight tooth nail keep way, despite fact people care anymore outside psychotic online communities karens. Again, thing without vaccine. 

The article gave pure speculation based history. quoting hundreds years facts. “Children also human, study finds” it’s two year study won’t able get covid vaccine flu vaccine trial +/- 4 weeks. 

I don’t see recruiting 2 year trials planning public distribution 2 months. don’t plan changing habits March feel rushed can’t blame people skeptical. Sounds like they've thought made best decision given preferences. good reasons trials testing needs rigorous.

Some mistaken impression trials serve purpose. want bring back 19th century hucksters fake cures either fixed nothing else made things worse. Yes, know pro-COVID crowd happy kill many people possible grand economic experiment. T

as lockdowns killing people ways. stepdaughter’s middle school/high school (they’re combined), 6 teachers, 13 students + whole sophomore football team quarantine. Superintendent covid, week class. school close “encourages participation school activities, including sports”

Did mention it’s Iowa? 😒 aren’t well.... know downvoted...

&amp;#x200B;

Is anyone seriously surprised that, like every communicable virus exposed to, kids able spread covid? district didn’t even last week without case, one building closed week due multiple cases; least one case another. 

Glad, eternally frustrated, kept kid learning home. No. not. things spin control quickly SK? thought great job, exception churchgoing nutcases... Dont worry idiots everywhere. people UK believe covid deaths inflated apparently islam bury body 24 hours leaving time autopsy put coronavirus speed process. Yes, know pro-COVID crowd happy kill many people possible grand economic experiment. Thanks valuable input. really helps, dad xarelto now, d-dimer shot upto 10k time got rid virus started giving xarelto 2.8k two day back best take I’ve seen. They're coming gold medal!

I worked company years ago service contract there. Never got see monkeys though (I allowed anywhere near lab floors). bring air-freight China middle night.

Worked another guy worked monkey lab college cleaning cages feeding stuff. said horribly depressing even though animals given high level care. Unfortunately monkeys, go doors, come back out.

I believe local lab end stage testing facility. dosing critical illness / death. Even monkeys survive testing euthanized autopsied scientific analysis.

Sad business, I've seen heard, good ethical job providing medical service, distasteful may be. Yup. fact I'm numb death months means won. We're open reason.

The economy screwed either way I'm going one goes way order food restaurants. Regarding school, I'm college town, I'm overly concerned local economy. problem coworkers work effectively kids. That's problem going harder time working, possibly kids dying. want kids school, that's choice would force that.

However, since lack general evidence I've pointed out, recently finding kids spread disease, course past viral pandemics/epidemics held true schools appropriately closed prevent spread disease... proceed caution something crazy increasing number contacts adults/other children, children - actual factor missing understanding. think get actually read studies posted, obviously takes time read science.

Yikes. sounds scary. think CFS nearly intense need get lawyer. call time time I've yet see child get taken away. Especially school attendance. Usually pretty bad option since foster care always better unfortunately :( still get flu shot least studies single anecdote? 190k+ died USA alone lockdown measures, still try downplay virus...  right onto - two months later. Yep. He's bringing good point. say school day care, is, lot people. people rich enough afford child care jobs allow work home. statement little confusing. panel said reviewed available data treatment found data ""well-controlled, adequately powered randomized clinical trials demonstrate efficacy safety convalescent plasma"" treatment Covid-19

By ""found data"" mean good RCTs are, found benefit? seems like important distinction make. Unfortunately position that. work reality, awful was. would far worse involved. minimal national ""shutdown"" would likely happened without influence. Sweden's government formal lockdown everyone pro-lockdown wants make look bad. Granted higher deaths per capita surrounding countries, appear without forced lockdown able come low cases deaths now. ""Blind hatred""? pulled ass, gtfo Yup, go back see true though. people Albertan plates BC gotten harassed, hell nurse tires fly driving visiting parents BC. 

The reverse happening though, issue BC residents using pandemic justification assholes.

I want believe things like happen ""yes vaccine work ones brought [company name]©"" =P know watched week's episode! told ABC program ""Good Morning America"" Tuesday CDC guidance, last updated Aug. 26, indicates people died virus, ""a certain percentage nothing else Covid."" However, people underlying illnesses also die Covid-19, said.

I'm confused. exactly debunk? wait vaccine ~~rushed through~~ approved! asymptomatic still count covid death.  flu, disease mass produce vaccine every year. essentially question selecting pandemic variant instead typical one year. good news. mask might pick shield too, really effective Even hope investors shareholders big pharma restrictions takeaway? Sweden ""better"" numbers US, managed without strict lockdowns, think restrictions answer? Cases deaths declining declining Florida/Texas/Arizona, none gloom doom predictions states came true. death rate *way below* ""good"" New England states locked hard still locked down. that?

 pushing herd immunity

You already herd immunity north-eastern US. south getting there. get it, screaming kicking way, it, deaths cases decline across entire US. Masks masks. Yeah, pulled estimate excess deaths.. pretty. 

The communication terrible. need stay safe people need destroy lives stay safe. Fauci get assert would?

I make global statement I'm wrong. Fauci he's right? How? Remember expected much worse flu death year given strain. deaths never happened COVID-19 precautions, 270k probably low range estimate reality. someone Europe: I'd put religion US first place. average, US people met (wide variety coasts, mostly) religious people I've met Iran... live theocracy. use bright light bleach? Huzzah!!! I've seen medical staff wearing both- dentists, testing labs, etc couldn’t handled better another leader. Name one thing mismanaged federal executive branch.

(Maybe college-student study abroad kids helping) See last post. create value, not. cute advertisement. wish US Chancellor took covid19 seriously believe ""hoax""? Also remember Germany robust labor/trade unions protect worker's health &amp; safety. Here, many shift workers deemed ""essential"" seen expandable left fend themselves. Even today, 8 workers poultry plant progressive humanistic liberal California died virus, week county leaders shut plant down. German trade federation would calling strikes many workers dying factories Bavaria. Sounds like pretty good compliment me. We're getting gender confused &amp; alphabet group weirdos enough make Fl worse off. Luckily us majority us Floridian's work everyday there's bunch bored people want burn every business they're 100% sure there's nowhere left employ them. know topic seriously, RIOTERS must wake drink nice tall glass stupid breakfast everyday. TL/DR America one big ass Florida, problems exist. boat. People knew immunocompromised lied me. trust one. alone time need? lol Americans embraced virus, huh

*""800 people college campus? Meh, that's nothing.""*

No wonder there's 180k+ dead Americans guess wanted go flee North gets captured. friend Florida kindergartener suffering headaches expected 7 hours, 6 hours, 5 hours computer time. Ridiculous. kindergarten homeschool curriculum like hour instruction time. normal kinder, kids recess, gym, music, coloring, even close hours hours sitting desk. landlord. create housing previously none. take ridiculously unnecessarily large homes (the average American home 2,600 sqft hoarded one family) put fuck ton sweat hard physical work fight towns senseless bureaucracy divide people safe places live. nobody put effort, would fewer places live, price would higher available.

Some landlords parasites. add value society. depends go job. likely online learning. People worried city centres dying, but, really problem? Short term yes, job losses certain businesses city, but... disposable income spent elsewhere huge amounts money time wasted commuting spent elsewhere I’m going speed. problem try keep economy open, people get sick, economy still shitty people sick. Look anywhere US advocating open up, shit honestly back track?

There areas previously opened reverting back forcing strict measures (e.g. illinois requiring wear mask throughout entire meal cities). reopening shit doesn’t work unless don’t give flying fuck deaths move zero acknowledgement.

One thing right wings many seem inability adapt change. Areas tried re-opening theory, didn’t work, right still advocates bullshit. Curious cutoff would be? One year? Two? Five?

How long long would suggest then? mean it’s kinda worse.
 
It’s like everyone agreed 2 + 2 = 4, Einstein people worked often said publicly 2 + 2 = 4, Einstein writes book “2 + 2 = 4” people previously agreed math start scream “Look Einstein quietly admitting 2 + 2 = 4! Math lie!” Nobody said that, trade-off death sickness Covid-19 death sickness lockdown/social distancing unsure World choice brings lesser amount death sickness. gonna say. Health measures put place probably protect people flu too. faulting red tape slow pace vaccine development.

But sound reasons proceed caution.  Moonshot efforts programs backfire.

It clear rush urge corners motivated politics. bent curve point lockdown anyway. Hospitalizations dropped. Oh even start. There's massive Twitter war shit atm. See James Lindsay's account. Good calling shit.  Gish galloping ask silly question ""lol wan vaccine bd?"" Seems way far. think they're detecting crazy outbreaks surface transmission, though I'm sure happens. Yeah maybe child services makes sure sickness legitimate isn’t abuse happening don’t know. policy going need wiggle room can’t go school cold. This. Right. Here. 

Our son missed 9 days school throughout entire year he's sick, keep home.

We got called school discuss attendance school social worker it. Ridiculous. We're opening casinos first take money kill you. 6% sars mers vaccine funding burned pandemic’s sources contained controlled. need development place one first 2-3 years practical candidate never found money dried up.

That paints slightly different narrative whole thing unfortunately. every year school except 2nd grade (chicken pox) 11th grade (parents pulled vacation). Otherwise went attendance felt sick went nurse got sent home. rewarded little certificate motivation it. double blind studies

Hold second. front-running vaccines double-blind studies right now. actually aware vaccines currently trials/phases? There’s election coming. Back April consensus opinion 270,000 dead. latest estimate saw 300,000. 

And, believe not, lot healthcare systems century pandemic. Lol ironic say need go back school clearly educated. Later dense troll. Holy shit fuck?! sick 20 days year 9th class, something like 40+ first grade. got significantly better though changed schools (I got bullied).

German here, wondering. ""Mainstream"" media is. idiots like Tammy Bruce Fox News tweeting fact look replies, country screwed. need wealth run welfare state. need people working generate wealth.

Whether given school opens depends bunch circumstances, everything life balances risks versus benefits.

In normal times, teacher student die every week car accident going to/from school. find benefits transportation worth risk, take steps reduce risks. seems accutely relevant discussion.

Kamala Harris Laughs threatening parents jail Florida's numbers right now? checked. testing increasing % positive decreasing? 

Here Cali that's what's happening. We're upping testing capacity % positive rate fallen 5 good progress. place becoming like Russia, every blunder, matter serious, excused. reaction big deal. People get sick. masks precautions place limit exposure. Kid stay home wait clean test couple weeks. make sure upvoted you. gotten downvoted shamed saying think cloth masks enough make difference avoid much human contact possible. many people read assume stuff. Asked question before.The time line H1N1 pandemic almost exactly SARS-CoV-2 ,but vaccine available lot quicker.Im trying start type conspiracy , understand reasons difference. lost fucking job shit told can’t accepted unemployment didn’t work enough hours. got Marines last year lol. Recently read article... Basically stated moratorium rent/mortgage payments halting evictions foreclosures kicking road low interest rates suburban housing boom bubble. Instead foreclosures filling demand housing, 6 months foreclosures interest buying besides speculators. housing market America absolutely FUBAR everyone acting like wonderful. 


1.5 Trillion bank accounts right stimulus enhanced unemployment. Instead paying rent property owners turn paying banks, sitting peoples bank accounts compelled pay anything. payments inevitably due, tomorrow's problem. today's. mean, we're spending $250,000-$500,000 per person healthcare lifetime compared wealthy nations, one third US families go without needed healthcare last year afford spending even more. 

Yep, absolutely fine. doctors reporting 70% recovered patients permanent lung heart damage amongst many symptoms. people felt fine idea covid. link discusses phenomenon Google search many more. Well, least guys chance course correct November... I’m UK, ‘leadership’ moderately less deranged stuck 5 years Lol news point? Seems obvious would happen done person intentionally coughs essential worker. 

If deliberately infect supermarket employee, welded house. he/she dies corona, house arrest permanent. evidence 
 (this one Spanish). 

Lockdowns caused starvation South America, Africa places. contested Oxfam UN denying it? evidence died corona? 

We imagine Peru would like without lockdown actually. Look neighbour Brazil. circa 121,000 deaths population 209.5 million. good number means demonstrates apocalyptic hyperbole spreading unfounded. Millions people died despite government literally nothing. rude challenging thought that, genuinely curious - think that? fairly early felt aware big stay least 12 - 18 months What's deal hospitals supposedly inflating number deaths COVID-19 deaths bring money hospital? surprised scattered cases, doubt made dent official death toll US. mother keeps bringing according her, make sense US ridiculously poorly comparison countries.

Any info sources would appreciated! 49,000 people New York New Jersey might agree assessment. Open everything up, reduce half testing getting rid Quest Diagnostics. Even six percent figure accurate, claiming comorbidities, deserve die? don’t get thought children less likely seriously affected less likely spread it. refuse even person playdates. Everybody different risk quotient, people risk prone tend lie people risk averse.

Other parents think getting COVID big deal gonna keep mind I'm two years cancer remission. oncologist stressed one knows triggers bad cases COVID, better assume immune system fighting it, careless find hard way. go urgent care like third time week last night. Doc said one pesky respiratory failures gave ibuprofen. turned fine, don’t see you’re talking about. get it. think vaccines take years develop liberals.
 
I really know came conclusion seems like making something shouldn't, I've made efforts, given publicly released data that's I'll leave things at. going speed? bit subjective, it’s probably better opening everything back like happened early summer. idea needing vaccine well established

We always acknowledged needed vaccine idea ""stay home, save lives"" vaccine recent. first absolutely stay home flatten curve. curve flattened, people still want us stay home. yah, ultra conservative religious groups Dont belie covid.  Uh oh. go again. Five percent US healthcare spending goes towards biomedical R&amp;D, percentage rest world. reason US funds research spend obscene amount healthcare. 

So question becomes would willing trade 23% reduction R&amp;D spending (given unthinkable assumption could match OECD average healthcare spending) half million dollars savings personally? Alternatively, advancement priority, honestly think could find efficient way funding lost $100 billion research spending $2 trillion we'd saving? faKe nEwS

Good little parrot 🦜 don’t disagree. described stopping virus. scenario, still spreads. Get facts. We’re trying outraged! exactly thought. Mt Everest tallest land based mountain Mauna Kea tallest overall base summit. arbitrarily chose measure based available methods time. thought American numba one? said, ""Don't like it, go game"" fans going game putting risk absolutely wrong. replied take absolutely wrong switched talking players. appropriate we're talking football moved goalposts. 

Anyway, matter. still absolutely 100% wrong ""don't like it, go game"" garbage. Anyone going game putting others risk makes selfish immoral. excess death tolls individual states relevant? 

Also, would excess deaths trending Covid-19 trending New York? Yeah, everything would sunshine rainbows locked down? add that. He's looking really rough. would suggest manage pandemic? face swollen like influence something. No, I'm stating COVID nearly dangerous general population people make seem. still real virus, still causes real complications some. 94% people 2.6 comorbidities advanced age, likely need freak (just like young people get flu shots compared elderly).

But average person need worry it. kill ""less 10k"". killed people common flu would killed. problem virus contagious aspect it, actual symptoms complications. common flu 10x contagious, wind with.

Obviously vaccine helps people get back work sooner without fear it. desperately need. People = Jobs = Money = Economy. mention healthcare education workers need it.

The fact need spell explain vaccine useful ""preventing death"" means need go back school take economics class. I've never seen it, (since Reagan anyway) hardly means happened. quick Google search brought Trump. really dig deep. CDC politicized. would return former self different President. Illinois (Chicago) like, except one enforced gathering part. told stay home/isolate immediate family only. Shops match completely, essential open (including manufacturing, could job remote, supposed could report employer time letting you.) majority people don’t option. mention people can’t buy car without financing get mortgage even pay new phone once. mean dig new well right could pay majority people don’t kind money hand. point say you’re evangelical homeschooling. fucking didn’t care 2 million kids homeschooled covid agree transmissions contact transmissions. understand population density, still doubt would result greater 100% difference. 

I consider 3 months short observation period. Please understand, I'm saying people develop immunity Covid-19, think general do, though immunity may complicated viruses (probably somewhere HIV flu terms complexity). I'm saying antibody tests reliable determination proportion population contracted Covid-19 already recovered, due fact antibodies shown fade away. Normal blood antibody tests can't tell whether person mounted white blood cell response virus antibodies cannot detected. 

Edit: that's almost certain measured antibody proportion Pune means higher actual percentage already contracted virus recovered. percentage undetectable level antibodies, still white blood cell immunity. Lots pearl clutching here.

Largely, kids symptoms. recover antibodies barrier transmission community.

Isolating college kids large groups actually bad idea. dare somehow force Trump follow recommendations! CDC's fault! 

&amp;#x200B;

/s kinda hard shut dissent 1.3 billion people.  People criticize govt time China. know ever lived read Chinese. 

The surveillance social harmony catch criminals. 1.3 billion people, everybody matriculated post primary school educated sophistication behave etiquette fashion. Kids don’t learn much school. It’s unfortunate missing socializing, schools shut down, kids come back level, child left behind. Yea, confusing plans. Barbershop open indoors immediately nails can't, get different infection tier county. It’s don’t want to. would much rather able stay home, help take care either drug up, risk grandparents getting sick work. around sucks Nope lOnG tErM eFfEcTs know right

BunkerBoy much sophisticated kid sneeze normally like rest? getting ridiculous That's basically entire day tests get reported. think we’re better putting resources protecting vulnerable populations. Sacrificing education crazy me. Same!! Ohio outside ton it’s winter imagine everyone socializes indoors opposed fresh air. virus definitely spread stuck inside! Nope don’t understand either. One thing abundantly clear, relax protections virus come roaring back. We’ve seen again. 

We’ve learned ways live virus get effective vaccine, treat like hungry tiger, cute kitten. Lol what's source that? specifically, site general.

When look charts US walking, driving mass transit categories Florida driving.

so exactly comparing?

You trying argue Florida locked calim Florida shows slightly reduction mobility average. 

Distance travelled metric course, even right, proxy actually want know. It’s like U curve think. High mortality low virulence die relatively quickly, low mortality high virulence. disease unfortunately middle somewhere now. deadly virulent enough cause lots problems. Thanks sharing that. Crazy. Funny everyone cheering mandatory rushed vaccine Portugal day it’s Trump’s vaccine suddenly question things. include non-covid deaths need Covid positive death within 28 days coded. 

""Counts deaths causes death, including COVID-19, presented"" 

I pulled CDC themselves.get facts right quit lying. point propaganda? Lie much often people eventually believe actually reinforce lies. denounce everything contrary fake people successfully indoctrinated. Americans truly unbelievably stupid.  rate, many dead 200million become infected? (hint: 6 million). Ya say? read CDC's clarification regarding this.

There's definite counterargument presented, point feels like beating dead horse. “Fewer world” lol know reading obits lot young people dying unexpected deaths dying home bed state within month. coroners stopped listing corona death aren’t tested report. like anything, reports skewed, falsified, etc. proof, documentation. hopefully helps context, basically written confirmation obvious. Yea well example actual trash could actively hurt someone. going life actively hurting someone. would catch virus, shed virus come contact vulnerable individual order transmit virus. things done purposefully driving drunk done purposefully. world opening back up, people going back normal either get stay cooped home forever. Don’t really know else tell you. Excess deaths would similar flu COVID less dangerous, yet way higher. Yes, include non-covid deaths. Whats 80% asymptomatic rate according COVID-19, data date suggest 80% infections mild asymptomatic,

Asymptomatic thing asymptomatics mild. news, water wet. that's news half country. ish. know fact lot young people dying unexpected deaths dying home bed state within month. coroners stopped listing corona death aren’t tested Like said, left die. like rest us. democrat-ran states can't afford pay UI? administration obfuscating truth. It’s fucking discussing behavior. It’s slap face died enables behavior geared towards contracting spreading disease. I'm waiting Therefore bot, something like that.... freedom! Living SK, recall news subsequent aftermaths(i.e. second wave) making sub hundreds likes, feels like population sub mostly American, expected (sometimes ""here"" without context thread discussing countries means ""in US""), news countries without interest regarding anything directly US get much attention. 

Well, goes community language, understandable. Sometimes reading Korean news written Korean makes feel SK population worst terms following religion blindly. :( Anyone know flu death comorbidity causes higher 6%? 

I would imagine medical community much better handle comorbidity issues case flu they’ve dealing long time they’re pretty clear treatments. 

To clear, I’m really trying understand comparison without political filters. wouldn’t think would hard get apolitical medical statistics data, right?

This is, however, 2020, so.... Fucking war crimes literally read says Covid posite code require Covid positive test? That's literally provisional account. Get rid Google medical degree. apart problem Karen. 

That's called heart disease one top killers America way. Yeah people walk around waiting heart attack. stupid. Quit twisting facts. Heart disease kills Americans car crashes. course cardiovascular virus cause issues situation. heart attack cooking also triggered caffeine way. Yeah, good point. 6% 183,000 definitely bigger 25% 12,469. Love it! parents go-to saying growing up. worry troll, seems lot fun thing; leave alone might actually go away. Counter point: you’re major university makes tens millions students year. take responsibility. Maybe need see ""bed"" count broken 3 categories. home bed. hospital bed, ventilator. Maybe numbers would make things real, reality probably not. People see want see hear want hear...
I bad set lungs, Sarcoidosis, well diabetes, little heavy doctor nagging it, concerned. Pneumonia would probably kill me. family arguing ""economy, economy economy""
Its screwed up... Ten posts says are.😂😂😂 America: “I wonder he’s talking to” tell me. goalpost. Yah see, I've seen several past 3 4 months. However hold true false.. countries seems gain much traction.. least become noticed. personally thought, ok perhaps study needed? cases tend follow type pattern.  
Seen one say 2nd time individual way worse 1st time.. Ventilator such..  Unfortunately aside currently know (which slight changes time time seems) unknown virus.  America people part seem take seriously.. everyone think hope know mean.
Thus personally I'd rather wait see vaccine pans continuing responsible best can. opinion...
Ty response article one way isles shouldn’t pass someone don’t want to. Personally, point face shelves I’m passed I’m slow looking something.

Discontinuing one way isles wouldn’t bother much. I’d rather put foot hard say mask, sale.

Yes! No! Google!  Agree  That's bad take stats. stats telling cannot find root cause 9000 deaths attribute ""COVID-19"". 94% deaths symptoms directly caused virus, e.g. Fever, pneumonia e.t.c. cruel sadistic expect teachers kind choice. hard comprehend excess deaths include deaths require positive Covid test count?! Seriously?! hard read right states top page!!! 

You could hit bus tested positive Covid 80% asymptomatic rate according WHO, co-morbid death rates support 0.00026% Covid alone death rate. 

That's excess deaths. Provisional counts accurate account EXCESS deaths counted Covid coded falsely. 

""For COVID-19, data date suggest 80% infections mild asymptomatic, 15% severe infection, requiring oxygen 5% critical infections, requiring ventilation. fractions severe critical infection would higher observed influenza literally happens fucking time, please grow  Give liberty give death. 😂 China genocidal dictatorship people sub want gloss Absolutely not.

    Argentina offers irrefutable evidence long lockdowns spell disaster

   Hailed model beginning pandemic, world’s longest lockdown saved Argentina coronavirus misery cases daily deaths continue skyrocket

   Argentina enters yet another lockdown, teetering edge global top ten coronavirus cases – one handful countries curve almost statistical graphs skyrocketing.

  Friday 28 August, president Alberto Fernandez informed nation three weeks lockdown necessary “stop virus spreading order stop deaths… problem AMBA; problem whole country.”

   ""AMBA” refers Greater Buenos Aires, third 44.5 million Argentines live. strict lockdown force, occasional modifications, since March 20. long periods people unable leave house except shop food collect medicines. Even open-air recreation banned weeks.

   Despite this, many businesses remain closed. Restaurants bars offer takeaway service. indoor meetings groups permitted.

   rules place 164 days parts Buenos Aires. Nonetheless, even president concedes, “We long way resolving problem AMBA.”

   spring arrives Argentina, tourism season usually restarts. Prior pandemic, direct flights UK (as well Europe many US hubs) ensured capital enjoyed steady flow tourists.

   Buenos Aires’ grandeur already much faded; danger fading lockdown extends. South American cities ancient sites, historic palaces, beaches natural attractions, chief heritage social cultural life. wiped Covid-19, little left enjoy.

   Argentina weathered economic crises countries. pandemic hit harder recent slumps. 2001, currency crashed, tourists filled empty tables.

   large informal economy less collapsed. Mass unemployment could dire consequences, least fact private health insurance system people rely funded salaries.

   Back March Argentina widely praised swift response crisis. “You recover drop GDP,” president Alberto Fernández declared, implementing early lockdown. “But can’t recover death.”

   Matías de Cristóbal, director general Awasi luxury hotel group, laments hubris. “For first couple months, government enjoyed people’s support. poor communication skills notion cases might peak eroded trust.

   ""The government compared favourably Chile, Brazil Peru, even Europe, often using flawed data. made grave error predicting peak April, May June. bet allowing economy collapse story there’ll many fewer deaths government ‘on top of’ things looking us.”

Cases mean nothing without Hypertension another big risk factor. overweight tends cause hypertension. Even BMI. one saying Canada's healthcare perfect. trade-offs system, overall America's undeniably worse. However, problems trying make America Canada regard healthcare

1) American healthcare currently run hospital executive roaches who, go single payer, make medicine unbearable working it.

2) Healthcare =/= health. America costs high two things, system *and* people. Trying reduce costs Canada-level doable lay doritos, pepsi, six packs stop suing hospital every 15 minutes. Preventative care nice, noticed, country people like listen doctors/experts.

3) Physician density extremely low is, rural areas hit extremely hard.

4) Americans politicians support taxes would support single-payer system, M4A could crippled simple tax decrease (not know American politicians run promise massive tax decreases businesses...)

We'd better mixed private/public system, least time being.

Personally, think something like Switzerland's version universal coverage additional public option + medicare/medicaid would *enormous* step forward American healthcare, without departing current values nation. [We need that, two-tiered system would expand coverage eliminate much cost burden middle class allowing rich subsidize much cost higher-paying options. seems politically tenable, point single-payer system likely achievable.

This avoids many problems u/igglepuff talking his/her post, real serious.

I go home tell mom, hey I'm get perfect attendance award school year.

Mom tells that's wonderful, im proud you.

Im like mom, that's wonderful, ill get made fun of. deserved rewarded, punished. scheduled dentist appointment. 

Thanks Mom Considering school less 2,000 students population pretty high. guy makes point pretty concisely:

Companies this, this, stupid. long ban for? Oh, again. Forgot block you. 

Have fun passing moral judgment. Even fatality rate half. That's still 1 million deaths I’m happy see people’s opinions shifting using logic. Faith humanity restored! November... wait. never hit 50% student body testing positive. Yeah. 6 wings everytime trash get 1-2 bags wings. trash twice day. Thats 24 bags max right that’s 50-60 residents. another unit 15-20 people, workers also get meals styrofoam plates around 20 workers day. company 210+ facilities states &amp; canada.

There good answer here. Short life? death rate less quarter 1% age group lol That's weak consider Diabetes Heart Disease elective procedures MANY HOSPITALS CONTINUE SO.

How “elective” implies optional, elective surgical cases fall somewhere vital preventative measures (e.g. screening colonoscopy) essential surgery (e.g. cataract removal). Ample literature across surgical specialties demonstrates worse patient outcomes higher costs treatments delayed* suggest go comments articles. bet kids.  mean literally waited right Trump superspreader event Phoenix issue another close allow local governments issue mask mandates.

It calculated strategic, move cost people lives.

Unrelated him, still troglodytes places like Scottsdale Tempe refuse wear masks. overlap absolute dipshit seems 60+ risk crowd, 16-25 superspreaders. Yeah, even vaccine bad effects small number people vastly greater good impact overall. literally eradicated polio huge problem beforehand. sources show fatality rate COVID-19 anywhere 2% 6%. I'm trouble finding good chart shows anything weighted age, understand fatality rate lower children, higher adults. I've seen high 11% adults. 

But no, stretch imagination would 0.005% fatality rate worse COVID-19 deaths. Even exaggerate 0.1% virus would fatal. Someone light symptoms equate allergies, something ate, may noticable. Sure, correct, speaking people may symptoms recognize such. Rambling fine. make artform!

Did Philippines restrict international travel drastically first lockdown, knowledge? perhaps importantly, Philippines somewhat looser border controls given large number islands, perhaps allowing foreign nationals circumvent border controls bring virus? Or, comment seems suggest, limited contact tracing?

I'm genuinely curious. Ontario (and think Canada) land borders closed aside either essential transit US citizens wishing travel Alaska (which created problems, though think generally USians complied restrictions travel directly Alaska). Airports open, number flights curtailed. know oceanic shipping, imagine sea travel essential services (i.e., cargo container raw material transit). main thing Canadians seem favor keeping border closed US drastically reduces number cases. includes province's PC (a conservative party) premier, position found pleasantly surprising. Vaccines fairly similar things, extreme. mix batch number placement sticky label, cause $75,000 investigation pharmacy can't read label throw $20 flu shot, make sure nobody received 'faulty' vaccine. cotton tops aka snow birds leave summer likely spread way. rest AZ lives full time necessity. ya everyone tries escape heat remaining indoors ac there's that. Good luck there. Source: I'm Phoenix. Cardiac arrest symptom COVID. get add random ones one person happen virus. That's _not_ medicine works. Complicatons != symptoms.

It's like saying pooped pants ear infection, that's symptom everyone else. even close.

Your heart breathing directly related. **existing heart issues**, **any activity places additional stress** lead cardiac arrest. Difficulty breathing cause elevated heart rate, etc.

What typically kills obese people? Okay, surprise COVID especially dangerous obese people? That's called comorbidity.

There misinformation post. absolutely medically accurate, ask doctor. Look medical journal website, including CDC. hearing smokers obese people drastically likely risk. wonder why...

Condition makes getting oxygen difficult COVID Harder breathing Elevated Heart Rate Heart Attack individuals poorer health. Bingo.

#Quit censoring inconvenient truth using intentionally ambiguous rules. trolling legitimating arguing something?

US mobility got mobility hardest lockdown. Argentina got similar NZ response. Argentina kept virus levels low months, even though government could even afford proper testing contact tracing.

Sadly enough. coppers low rest world mess, would suggest Argentina now? 

Personally see good ways forward immediate future. agree. people means keep kids home though. babysit niece nephew every summer. I’m currently unemployed offered take M-F distance learning cheap ($150/wk, two kids, one special needs) don’t want long term effects also don’t want spread anyone else. sister chose send anyways. told cannot babysit go back school (I told decided). already miss them, don’t know she’s going school inevitably shuts again. refuse take quarantined two weeks. damn case study Chinese's restaurant mini split system blowing directly infected person caused super spreader event. applicability central HVAC systems almost nil. They're supposed conduct contract tracing still notify people direct contact positive case isolate, send memo whole school anymore. would imagine they'll million parents call wanting exact details want deal it. Also, parents find often kids coming positive, they'll probably throw fit matter time child next. 

Parents really crowdsource starting FB group report every time child told quarantine class involved, etc.

\-Donald Trump, Situation Room meeting, March 14th, 2020 Antifa literally means anti fascist. name anyone fascism moron. Americans fix healthcare system? Excess deaths prove false. Otherwise, year would look like standard flu True dat Well that’s what’s going there. Maybe research recommending something don’t know anything about.

[China forcibly sterilizing Uighur forcing Uighur women live Chinese seizes hair shipment forced labor camps think Aussie would circumspect Chinese to. Yup controversial saddens think many lives could saved implemented volunteer method like advocating since beginning pandemic. would likely already known front runner that's already proven safe effective would probably already distributing high risk groups. point probably already late since several phase 3 trails far along. DNC keep fucking us putting want versus people want. clearly problem. also like Biden seem dementia (maybe bad Trump still noticeable.) Personally even though feel Bernie Sanders would make excellent president, we're clearly point need upper age limits presidents. Cognitive decline serious common issue post-65. There's also sexual abuse allegations believe. two sleazes go head head presidential election idea two good choices. agree Republican moved crazy far right Biden looks liberal comparison. fair though, read proposed points agree lot says certain things mean follow through. 


However, Trump given free reign break laws enrich donors. keep mind, Trump be-all-end-all problem. McConnell republicans who've lockstep voting together part problem. Getting rid Trump going answer. Getting rid McConnell Republicans issue. anyone gets upset, *if republican politician serving interests constituents, even disagree politics, that, me, good politician.* seeing *not* that. That's uniquely American problem  But, but, covid need 40% infection herd immunity. /s

Even 40%, 340 million people would mean 135 million infections, generous 1% mortality rate 1.35 million deaths. Sounds reasonable (/s). Show hands, wants volunteer 60%? (Don't worry, kids already volunteered.) Masks never really mandatory anywhere American south, places orders enforced I'm pretty sure Governor ordered report real cases. cant trust ""official"" results DeSantis Trump acolyte. now? thought started months ago. no, vague rules individuals interpret wish. 
 
but would ask important try use sarcasm shut discussion racism even understanding about. that's major red flag. maybe care racism becoming racist, that's big red flag i'd investigate try correct you. many ventilate That's true all. Tech employees negotiate best vacation time, highest wages best healthcare. never unions. numbers line world per population. dont get Americans think numbers hiked up. India, UK, Spain, Brazil, Peru Italy also fudging numbers? 

I personally know 2 ppl passed COVID-19. insulting hear people pushing crap. 1 19 people US know someone died COVID-19. dont know anyone, wait. Well going see lot problems. real impact covid show quite time virus passed. piggy you. Thankyou. still amount quarantining back March.

Monday-Friday dont leave house except walk dog, go Walmart grocery store Saturday.

My gf works grocery store, potentially exposed every single day one that, among things, hangs price tags around store.

So one wears gloves, hand touch everything store, could come contact Covid number ways.

They've 4 5 Covid cases Publix, management threatens fire catch standing next another co worker 5 minutes.

When cases, even disinfect anything.

You can't disinfect grocery items.

Its gamble anytime go store. least trying limit exposure. Okay I'll bite... insurance cover procedure? Haha. Yep. Fuck virus man. lol, Gov Reynolds say could predicted....... CHANCE first ""release"" COVID vaccine going effective safe comes trump turned FDA, CDC political action agencies. Europe eaten coworkers, definitely higher standard taught people. US, it’s like said. Fork hand mouth. Using standard knowing allergies trigger deadly asthma attack, someone dies allergy-triggered asthma attack, actually dies allergy, asthma. Same. take care too! Russian Roulette never signed for.

Keep mask on. touch face, disinfect hands often. probably bottle desk encourage students use too.

Good Luck. Confirmed cases fraction actual cases... Like usually like add:
When comes society changing diseases like this, law pretty clear. individual must order prevent spread disease. FHM recommends something, expected follow it. 
It trust, also law. Yes people suddenly started asking directions reason, would show increase mobility. potential flaw although couldn’t think plausible explanation would case moment.

So cross check Google’s method actually tracks mobility, gets nitty gritty telling exactly people stopped going. see compare FLA USA actually deeper *amok states lower prevalence, still trouble contact tracing people answer phone, trust government, lie history. Uhm yes, I'm sure least 6 Twitter threads, 2 Facebook posts, Youtube video since removed. insurance company need prove got elsewhere. need prove got work.  appeal say they're covering it. burden proof you. also coverage eligibility court sue them. likely right. read something long time ago something could considered conspiracy one many reasons *could* assassinated seeing Vietnam lost cause wanting pull out. link good article though? 

I also wrong wound 4chan thing-- make lies hawaiian shirts okay signs white power thing white supremecist groups start it. way around. I'm unsure put edits let people read see wrong. Respiratory failure underlying condition last time checked MAGA KAG MAGAA

what next? People reddit make huge deal little sick time Americans get. There's reason need more. Americans take time have. one taking time that's offered would employer give time off? say undercounted, deaths classified unknown pneumonia. think better analogy would 6% car crash fatalities ""car crash"" listed cause death.

Essentially what's happening something like ""massive trauma"" listed cause death, ""car crash"" bottom-line underlying cause, people claiming means car crashes actually killing people.

Or direct comparison; AIDS rarely actual cause death. ""all does"" rob immune system. typically see, eg, asphyxiation cause death, pneumonia, immunodeficiency, AIDS underlying causes, order. indicate asphyxiation epidemic!

So 6% AIDS fatalities ""AIDS"" listed cause death, indicate aids killing many people claimed - it'd indicate 6% cases, death certificate filled poorly. - goes back incompetent Gov DeSantis profits way important public safety spitting distance person sure.

But given ""social distancing"" that's really risk it?

Bottom line home made masks primarily source control, nothing whatsoever protect people aerosol born contagion.

That's reality, messaging. Well, I’m glad NY state slashed school budgets 20%. We’re expecting school closures, layoffs online year middle high school now. bet regret calling countries names! proper stuck shitshow wishing could get nothing changed really. vast majority Americans traveling Canada Mexico healthcare. Another one ""lockdowns bad” bullshit articles. bad ""fed-up Victorians"".  😭 

I keep hearing so-called ""negative economic social outcomes people"" like wtf?

These doctors little preoccupied sadness. believe lockdowns ""harming general population”. bogus. I'm always surprised see violence hospital billing agents Healthcare industry.

If ever got bill like 100k dont know would do.

I would never get that, could never get married, destroyed debt.

Its evil.

Hospitals charging thousands saline, aspirin, seconds doctors time. Cases 75% peak, without need lockdown. becoming increasingly clear lockdowns harm good. make excellent point can't say I've thought much except terms ""Go west"" sudden there's ""west"" wilderness get away create/recreate yourself. reforms would suggest since probably thought lot this?


a years ago, read wall comment redditor hypothesizing humans mammals veruss insects. gist mammals live small groups like humans would, history, live packs village groupings. However insects live hives; there's ton living top ant hills, bee hives, stuff like that. person made comparison metro areas hive-like. happens mammals live like insects? much could consider social breakdown could attributed that?


I think lot. effectively like $150k problem data reflects Apple Maps direction requests., skewed based locations. People large metro areas often use GPS navigation they're familiar they're going want bypass traffic. Someone rural area small town need directions much.

It's interesting data point, think tells full story. means people less likely go somewhere new, staying home. really. mean, yeah, typical reddit - biblical literalism one form exegesis, particularly compelling one. (Though yes, disproportionately popular US fundamentalist sects.)  point national lockdown made sense. US large makes sense lock local level. Even state-level lockdowns really make sense smallest states. go stand next bunch infected kids without masks. I’ll let go first.

Already there. I’m high school teacher first alert positive test campus came last week. students fairly good job keeping masks sometimes feel like I’m forced play game Russian Roulette never signed for. least prompted finally update will, so, silver lining? hope becomes socially acceptable live masks after/if quarintine ends. comfortable, hate smile people public Absolutely nothing says mask infected person effective one.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hit stats, hit downvotes. Awesome. Deep thoughts second paragraph. true. talking Denisovians versus Neanderthals?  live here? suggest opposite experience. seen 1 person without mask indoors 2 months. also suppressed evidence outbreak back December, multiple doctors started sounding alarm, blocked international investigators entering Wuhan last time 15%. rarely ever 50%. vaccine like this. saying sides saying that's I'm saying?

Because agreeing another redditor's metaphor-- options suck least we'll able get Biden he's better alternative. going double twat? Got it. know ""God"" one responsible Covid-19..
I mean believe God must understand responsible everything... attempting derive humor obvious application methodology opposed to. Meanwhile USA, Brazil, India:

I'll pretend see that. Also bit fact check [*Our World mid-June—at height testing effort—Sweden administering twenty-seven tests per 1,000 people, compared 180 Iceland, ninety-eight Denmark, forty-seven false. mid-June Sweden second Denmark group nordic countries daily testing per thousand people, time actually reporting ""people tested"" ""tests performed"" later countries do.

Maybe means ""total tests performed mid-June per capita"" argument uses really makes sense - everyone **knows** end May Sweden testing limited prioritized groups; would say ""at height testing effort"" comparing total numbers? expect half-a-month increased testing catch countries 3 months massive testings?

Edit: 27 people tested per 1000 people seems total tests performed Sweden May 31st according OurWorldInData. sentence entirely wrong ""in mid-June"" entirely misleading premise ""at height testing effort"". Shows lockdowns unfortunately always work. Actually works... live small spanish mediterranean island, first wave got 130 positives, lockdown acomplish record 40 days new infections. july 1 island open tourists start coming, last 14 days +200 cases... work go holidays fucking pandemic. Cuba? mmmh... Wait... ""AKHTUALLY"" guy, regularly see groups kids playing basketball public courts drive home days, past month. lot time, kids play casual sports according seasons. They're trying hard downvote anything even remotely casts ccp bad light. Damn. I'm dumb. read original report study see study transmission spread authors clear detected virus RNA *not* live detection virus RNA respiratory specimens study necessarily imply viable virus present. know why? mask face physically stopping things entering nose mouth. “masks don’t work 100%, though!” yeah, astute observation dumb fuck. stop small percentage things, one could liquid droplet containing virus. beginning economical crisis. lot back normal, lot still hold return normal anytime soon.

The effects lacking medical treatment also show coming months. Good old propaganda 

An ironic thing say someone exclusively posts pro-china propaganda Madrid around 8-10% positivity post first wave. hit pretty hard, hit number see things seem slow down. certain regions/cities Europe hit number since mitigation went fairly well began.

So again, close Northern Italy/NYC/etc... 5 vaccines stage III historically, 83% phase III vaccines pass, odds none 5 passing low. Wait, contagious? not? 

They long?

We know, probably highly variable per Isn’t way test that??

Sure, go stand next bunch infected kids without masks. I'll let go first. Taking Europe example, I'd say first drop numbers low able safely say ""contained"" virus cases go skyrocket (Spain, France) again, would so-called ""2nd wave"". humble opinion, I'd say US 1st wave yet. cases declining, also jumping up. draw straight line chart mostly staying same. argue accurate data charts is. Considering people manipulated last data set CDC recently release, yes.

The unfortunate truth research explained people adays, needs crystal clear otherwise elements side manipulate data say want say Teaching patriotism actually teaching nationalism. entering 4th Reich. mostly ccp trolls trying downvote anything negative china Unfortunate. kind alternate thinking tons really stupid Americans cutting slack believing Russians stirring shit net. fix society high numbers people like this? retrospect, correlation.
In cases, body left able fight covid virus, level Herd Immunity obtained. problem sake economy mainstream media barely made news fact virus confirmed airbourne everyone caught talking importance masks they've stopped mentioning confirmation airbourne transmission virus easily enter eyes. billboard like Detroit. Sad needs said are. 1)They hiding deaths

2)This yet. Death double every 3 weeks.

3)We much younger population 

4)Numbers per million inhabitants stupid way measure. I've always understood home made masks source control.
In words, masks stop droplet born contagion. 

But masks little nothing stop aerosol born contagion folks. allegedly educational institute teaches smart... Oh definitely! beginning faith Japan (diamond princess fiasco...) even fluctuating numbers things fairly peaceful. I've going bars busy restaurants otherwise I'm living pretty normally people. Take care yourself! provinces. two digits number cases months ago testing contact tracing. Buenos Aires tested people symptoms contact people coming abroad. 

Many people call emergency numbers report symptoms tell call 3 days symptoms persist. never get tested.

For first months official numbers stable actual number cases grew exponentially.

No contact tracing positivity rates 40%. need adequate testing want contact tracing. can’t comments. Sick sick fucks. news, water wet. drop 95% cases peak, it’s like comparing early April early July Europe, i.e., second wave. positivity rate still long way go suggest drop real. fine them, close business can’t pay it, jail them! That’ll teach ~~Trump~~ ‘em! senior likely comorbidities. I'm guessing deaths get coded varies widely - I'm 75 hypertension diabetes would otherwise lived 80 without contracting covid-19, I'd prefer covid coded primary cause death.

On flip side, I'm 20 died mauled death polar bear covid19, I'd prefer left covid death counts. Xinjiang 14 days without case yet. think see extra restrictions imposed Corona virus lifted days.

""It's almost injustices scale seen since Holocaust currently happening Xingjiang""

Whilst agree happening Xinjiang absolutely terrible needs stop, still disagree statement. think injustice killing millions middle east tops it.

""If pandemic fantastically control,""

If rest country virus free, reported on, anybody? willfully ignorant bred raised way? Trump: wall wasn’t safety. yours. repost? Pretty sure past 4 years disproved theory sound willfully ignorant uninformed. doctor opt see pay. schedule neurology appointments 6 months advance. secondary insurance didn’t pay share quickly enough. owed $105, cancelled appointment. didn’t even get notice.

I gotten used paying medical bills deductible met (since I’m seeing neurologist, always meet deductible fairly quickly) since wasn’t used getting bills, didn’t even think it. 

They weren’t concerned whether saw neuro timely manner. wanted money. vote different candidate. There's 2 felt like Karen. feel like karen always anymore. remotely completed trials yet. Andrew Jackson wants dance little invisible bombs got there. can't wrap mind around CDC would release study way did. makes sense. study examining comorbidities pre existing conditions, looking everything written death certificate. main cause death listed along covid certificates pnemonia, condition caused Covid! also sepsis, organ failure, stroke, heart attack, etc. Listed thousands death certificates they're common complications CAUSED Coronavirus.

The wording study made seem like ""only 6% Covid deaths happened previously healthy people"", actually meant was, ""in 6% Covid deaths doctors clue virus killed patient list anything."" 

Words matter feels like words intentionally misleading/reckless. Even CDC lost sanity point -_- Look, sooner accept deaths everywhere forever Covid sooner you’ll get upvotes. don’t play shit here. lockdown worked? That’s Karening though. shouldn’t big deal irresponsible. Several fascist thing. like echo chamber thing. (Specifically 2, 3 4) words great Melania Trump... ""I care, u?"" Florida's new slogan ""Come retire permanently. hurricane take COVID will."" surprise one... Interfering interferon alone probably enough example virus also downregulates MHC-I, used detect destroy infected cells. Everybody knew that. think decrease cases Guatemala since reopining? anything. Beds freed up. Deaths down. Hospitals complaining much. government lying deaths fantastic job hiding bodies claims mass nighttime burrials anything like that.

Franky, I'm shocked. thoughts? article misreprents co-morbidity scientifically defined statistics. That's comorbid deaths counted scientific community. Pre-existing conditions are. literally says there. Literally. Read. say that? want make assumption that’s completely nowhere try make look dumb gotcha. 

I won’t taking vaccine rushed, skipped phase testing, labeled miracle political leader, individual, human non-human, human choosing identify another species. 

Does cover it? **Xinjiang experiences draconian COVID-19 Government China's Xinjiang region imposing draconian measures combat coronavirus, including physically locking people homes arresting comply strict quarantines 40 semi-autonomous province country's far-north west home persecuted Uyghur ethnic minority — Turkic-speaking Muslim minority — subjected appears world's largest imprisonment based religion since recent years, scores Uyghur men forcibly detained placed internment camps, Uyghurs' physical movement online activity heavily monitored Government *China's frontier Satellite imagery lifts lid size spread China's internment camps, used indoctrinate vast numbers Xinjiang region's Muslim June, Associated Press (AP) investigation determined Uyghur women coerced abortions forcibly residents forced swallow traditional Chinese medicine, according government notices, social media posts interviews three people quarantine, least one herbal remedy contains ingredients banned Uyghur woman told AP dozens cellmates detention centre strip naked week sit cells hosed No, school kids theleast risk catch die virus... George Carlin point. one moment *novel* virus.

But general point proven medical science. Children need exposed germs order train immune systems. worries - they'll back lockdown many times finally immune virus. woo hoo extra credit! absolutely lose shit trying discuss this? i’ve unfortunately lost good friends lightly they’ve taken they’ve behaved throughout whole thing insurance. Na, that's works. never opened borders tourism. :( I'd also accept Canada, New Zealand, Singapore Taiwan. That's going stay way. projections cities start surging month two. New York New Jersey states projected massive increase starting around mid-October. scientists predicting another wave weather gets colder scientists right far. called ""herd immunity"". Get program!

*Whip sounds* current rate infection take ten years everyone get infected examples people getting second time. smart take. dysregulation overreaction otherwise young people affected. Wait, thought China banned foreign press... Western media seizure yet again. troll dude China No. think jobs schools allowed require it, national level would problematic (constitutionally practically). First, mandating vaccine reduces burden proof vaccine safe effective needed get people take vaccine. could mean one coming market enough testing done. unsafe vaccine really propel already growing anti vax movement. Hell, requiring would give megaphone idiots. 

I trust majority people working FDA. think unsafe vaccine come without ton leaked memos whistle blowers. is, potentially, important vaccine since polio. Cool, starting get it. almost injustices scale seen since Holocaust currently happening Xingjiang, coronavirus pandemic cover continue atrocities.

If pandemic fantastically control, lockdown complete disregard human rights needed? Right - question asked is, would people died year COVID? Some, yes, excess deaths show many would have. Unless diabetes heart conditions universally got worse year accord, much lethal time comorbidities, virus raging population. interfere interferers interferons. related news, House extensive process finally arrives conclusion general public, many months later... voted piece shit? cast vote Hilary, good. Covid also alright laaadies! USA Chinese state... Yet... No, trust it. 7 months ago (which incidentally feels like lifetime) would much shit shaken since basically zero faith bullshit comes administration. is. think vaccines using Adenovirus platforms going underwhelming. Effective 50% people couple months antibody levels transient. Oxford vaccine uses chimp Ad, maybe different eh, think so.

I 0 faith Moderna's vaccine, Biontech/Pfizer vaccine unstable practical/widespread. leaves us inactived vaccines Phase III, work? math off. 3 deaths per 10k people assumes everyone infected cannot reinfected. Current trend appears roughly 500/10k population confirmed. said, way get real number look excess deaths years correct knowns (like lower driving rates) things proven false. Also, things nothing fight covid19. I'll hold scientific consensus single individual, regardless reputation. Save foreskins Insider knowledge huh bunch assholes. heard wedding venue back open again. fines issued bride/groom inviting many guests? fines failing quarantine? base thinks virus fake wont take it. say ""If yer scared, take vaccine, aint scared""

Currently say ""If yer scared, stay home"" really interesting see many people similar dreams. Several people know also said they've dreams along lines too. wonder antimaskers too...  governor learn absolutely nothing last time Texas prematurely reopened? What's definition insanity again? positives need quarantine. Separate rooms, given potential additional viral dose impact severity. one place China another place China! seem necessary headline written past tense. ಠ_ಠ forum talking Corona? article writing solution - limitations - problem? Holy shit 😱 fair start vaccines year. building SARS vaccine work. wont take Trump Putin vaccine unless scientific *consensus* agrees looks legit. nothing lockdown. friends believe opposite true. think severely counting deaths blame amount people simply fact we’re “testing more” it’s good see stuff affirm opinion theirs.

Too bad people like never see stuff. like live 750 miles closet border crossing, I'm SOL. could care less point. Put sugar water syringe call vaccine let us move lives care almost word word neighbor said today. Exactly. news boring lately seems shit already know, said new group.

Ya, know. /r/NoShitSherlock people think outdoor flu shot clinics? Seems like good idea time. I’m decently confident doctors office would safe inside precautions, figured I’d ask people know/are thinking doing? comes surprise considering he’s outwardly downplayed virus whole time, even stopped hospitals reporting CDC, no? [please clarify I’m wrong this]. Depends many infected people get plane China.. could presympomatic, case, positive accurate necessary contact tracing. Except vaccines don’t solve virus problem practically overnight like movie Excess provisional different counts. Duh.  right free press report what's happening Xinjiang can't deny billion Chinese happily going normal lives virus free. seems odd. thanks NRA! though Wuhan grappled 50,000 cases Hubei 68,000 all, many Xinjiang, residents weren’t forced take traditional medicine generally allowed outdoors within compounds exercise grocery deliveries. Even Wuhan rest China mostly returned ordinary life, Xinjiang’s lockdown backed vast surveillance apparatus turned region digital police state. past three years, Xinjiang authorities swept million Uighurs, Kazakhs ethnic minorities various forms detention, including extrajudicial internment camps, widespread security Cult 45 keep vomiting out,""Fake news!"" anyways like news really anything. think warned us said? I'm referencing Uighger Muslims forced education camps China. obviously happen U.S. Contact tracer said tested positive brother tested positive. seen couple years live 3000 miles apart. Nah, know. people right Reddit praising response Covid. No, explain all, we'll say time gotten point, Republican Party played long game successfully managed gain partial complete control many state legislatures Governor's offices, quite states considered ""battleground"" states national elections. rampant partisan gerrymandering protected two consecutive census years 2000 2010, Republicans able effectively disenfranchise large parts country, tactics known packing cracking districts, yielding districts given names ""upside-down elephant"" ""praying mantis"". 

With President Obama illegally blocked making single Supreme Court appointment, along serious delays several federal court appointments well Republicans managed pack courts, including SCOTUS decide Court role stopping one party disenfranchising voters opposition, even Deep South, where, much like everywhere else, African-American voters tend vote bloc Democrats, Republican-held legislatures nationwide state redistricting choices made partisan reasons, merest fig leaf covering naked racism. equally partisan Supreme Court pretended could see outlines huge bigoted penis inheritors legacy slave-holding South, Republican Party, continues fuck Black people minorities day.

So lose due willful destruction nation's democratic ideals, asked years look back times answer happen, us yet taken ""re-education"" subsequently ~~being gassed millions~~ ""now camp providing useful labor state"" would likely want explain anyone, person asking dangerous question likely informer bounty really believe horse shit, mean happened? won, remember? owned Libs good, forever! remember executions traitors Clinton, Biden, Pelosi, Schiff, ask rest? 

Doesn't everybody support worship Dear Leader, Trump Jr., son God-Emperor Donald J. Trump? [\**turns portrait prominent position wall snaps perfect Nazi salute*\*]. 

Don't you? [\**looks person foolish enough ask stuff every student learns elementary school eyes narrowed suspicion*\*]

I'm tired too. I'm suggesting talking ass making terrible points sad thing one CDC's main functions supposedly agency able communicate health policy masses Never said implied stats wrong; purely discussion death certificates issues involved relying caused someone's death.

To use analogy, there's reason take deeper dive car crash fatalities. useful know caused them; smart phone use, alcohol, etc. crash would happened without one variables. true Covid-19 deaths. Generally speaking, people died would died lacked comorbidities became ill. lot people confused. Countless articles last month said ventilation indoors what's _causing_ spread.

Of course, articles bit nuanced, people rarely get past headlines. Rutgers undefeated 2020 Wait, shot? law enforcement? Where? think says ""Tengo"" report isn’t pre-existing conditions all, it’s comorbidities. It’s important know many people died pneumonia vs ARDS vs cardiac arrest. It’s important list causes death death certificate. doesn’t mean underlying conditions. describes covid killed them. 

For *some*, comorbidities *also* pre-existing conditions, reverse true.

that cannot perceive objective reality


let virus take care name comment together scare me. like think CDC run intelligent people

It's run political appointees. probably intent. incredibly true! Although insurance companies, confidence government deal swiftly effectively. know covering maybe thousand cases, generate incredible amount goodwill positive press translates income. 

Singapore lot cases end, vast majority happened foreign worker dormitories covered government insurance companies. Pretty sure OP bot

Look comment history, like 95% begging karma make account look legit Welcome wave three 

I guess good part morons maybrace get coronavirus able vote makes realize US never says shit organ harvesting China. Sure........😂 go back basement Reptard. Please still wear mask. mean awhile, like since began. never mentioned 5 presidencies. did. Also, learn spell attempt sick burn. Definitely summer allergens air. ;) one surprised Thanks that. fact experienced past failures means know prevent future occurrences. something afraid of. 

Flying safer ever learning past failures made system safer. wearing Tegnell T-shirt? Maybe Bush, Cheney might fitting... kept one drafts people greatest influence society works money, turn rest us be, whether willing not. factual statement. seems COVID attacks body similar way. makes harder fight existing new infections. Imagine 80's cavalier AIDS said big deal. returning traveller infected someone community would theory seen infections develop elsewhere. would spread spread contacts cluster connected tracing.
  Also, virus contain DNA RNA. Personally, point, I'm ready see shit crash burn even larger scale people start acting like virus went poof disappeared, start huge gatherings people again. Fuck it, shit cull stupid point. Okay DEFINITELY Onion... right? call missed week, plus doctors note like anything else, let healthy strong continue sick weak stay back.

You can't compartmentalize population neatly dealing disease 5 day incubation period 67% transmission occurs symptom onset. people vulnerable part population need contact rest society.

And diabetes obesity comorbidities. Statstically, lot people passing around 6% meme 94% group like shoving fast food face.

And entire point everyone mask up, shutting bars restaurants gyms would cut virus tranmission near zero allow rest economy open deal isolated outbreaks testing contact tracing. we've saying along.

We can't 100% open let rip society.  could wear masks 100% time, shut exceedingly dangerous sectors economy, everything else back open normal. Instead get virus dribbling population, can't open back completely starts rip again, shut everything thousands people die.

Half-assing means dribbles months. people cough less likely spread virus? knew?

So agree restrictions healthy people reason suspect sick mostly lifted? addition reasons parents can’t know they’re going able able go work. Employers going accept people randomly week week may may need watch kid. US “locked down” (an exaggeration sure) March, 1-2 million people would dead point.

Whether “lock down” point makes sense debatable, casual dismissal primary emergency control measure troubling. Oh said going 0-6 year. thought meant starting season going 0-6, overall.

Obviously, would’ve lost OSU year, think seriously underestimate Harbaugh draw here. Fans accepted are. 9, 10, maybe occasionally 11 win team. Lmfao! Dude personally know three different people it, top countless patients I've run tests hospital. dumb ass barking wrong tree here. Bad... death.  Sure, let’s listen dumb what-aboutisms someone’s actual firsthand experience. seek medical services sometimes? Maybe life saving intervention right situation? Yes. doesn’t matter does, benefits people like normally either. start convo. started. really like job, part really like coworkers (even two outliers work, ones talking to- people Trumpy) whatever reason decided try engage gently. they're human beings. can't even write idiots, they're dumb. (Well one good qualities try force see work peacefully together.) trying. Bc occasionally get curious genuinely want hear think talk out. exhausted. We're still coworkers mostly get along. 

No minds gonna get changed, conversations largely worth it. awful. people genuinely major things common with. Shit divided. propaganda machine/Russian spies/societal dysfunction working together make sure join together get pissed thing once. remember work anything care about. exhausting disheartening. Social distancing washing hands extreme. Forcing businesses occupy 30-50% occupancy even extreme, even ideal.

But downright forcing businesses closed (and selectively that), months end absolutely is. enabled destruction small business prop big-box mega retailers. **When done anything similar before?** remember Sweden shutdown complete disaster seem think. [Actually zero deaths last 7 days, complete downward trend since fair? Ya'll want rile big corporations enabling get fatter like this. Way go. fail see everyone Wal-Mart Target big lines ""doing best"" smaller places can't open.

Meanwhile states failed UI systems still issues distributing money people (and never got gave up). complete disaster. ""CLOSE EVERYTHING CROSS FINGERS BEST"" meanwhile people work months underpaid paid all. would agree 10 days row. always seems total though. Gov Abbott! guarantee nothing learn person worth risking lives for.

edit: misspelling. Half us mad way use word. half us mad way use word. They're sick COVID-19 there's zero energy left except flopping bed aching, possibly padding equally cranky spouse/kids. Thus, pool noodles. It’s fair assume Sweden much effort testing tracing Denmark would find lot new cases currently do. 

One two danish university researchers commented Denmark’s amount testing might excessive. true. Wether it’s waste resources political economic question better answered people involved actual strategy. It’s clearly conscious priority spend money testing exchange fewer restrictions. 

Sweden’s strategy generally testing tracing people without symptoms pretty unique. Except Trump forced CDC also recommend asymptomatic testing. [Apparently make US look new here? Oh? Howd work Herman Cain? know way, WAY richer BJ Tom Hanks?  super famous somehow magically protect you? Fake person public option needs versatile aimed dragging young, healthy people away private insurance keep costs low.

The biggest fear public option become dumping grounds private insurers. Regulation savvy design needs prevent that, easy know stuff.

It needs multiple levels, prevent catastrophe level.

Sort like investing, young person go higher risk, higher upside. higher OOPM, lower premium. relatively cheap, still ""buy-in"" add-ons older at-risk people. sort stratification prevent run-away costs supplements costs need it, creating system compete private insurance levels. subsidies middle class need give public option slight edge, complete domination private insurers. 

All also requires private health insurance reform. instance, non-planned care automatically covered. bullshit see provider complication surgery wind $10k bill provider network needs end. funniest thing can’t tell satire real, people upvoting fits framing. Dude parents enough home schooling kids. Like oh it’s open it’s time go. 

You think think whole house fine asymptomatic? ESP since kids higher viral carriers adults studies. need help anxiety also need stop spreading misinformation, thread OP says caught twice (even though never got test first time) full people claiming reinfection common fucked cause immunity last people upvoting comments like crazy. mean, kid's school recording attendance based homework assignments submitted end week. Zoom sessions recorded case able live. need get stuff done week.

If kid submitting work week, live Zoom sessions, sort expected outcome? effectively attending school anymore point. ""Perfect attendance"" awards awful need stop. parents type people wanted perfect every sort way school, *had* perfect attendance. got point despite really bad fever mid-term exams, mom forced go school. wonder many people got sick parents sure got sick situation. I'm pretty sure grew Kansas, missing like two weeks school semester enough police sent house. Later friend California stayed home half fucking semester lmao Actual double blind studies take 8-12 months, 2. 

The protocols thrown window. 

Hence, credibility gap. hope low-incidence areas don’t expect mild effects high-incidence area like NYC likely see school reopening. People like source divisiveness happening world. think self righteous always wrong Appears Covid taken care 😣 California law, employer required provide 24 hours (3 days) paid sick days per 12 month period. employer provides 48 hours (6 days). Sick days also accrued, meaning earn 1 hour every 30 hours worked begin using 90th day employment (3 months). anywhere good enough least something. I'm favor socialism.

I well know rights worker U.S. that; fucking morons think like prolonged thing way beyond reasonable measure end sight. agree point need distinction, person replying immunocompromised. 

So probably open many schools safely, need start liberal exceptions students.  agree child become risk older adults back home, that's responding to.

Then, course 2 big factors, would audacious say biggest. order we'd identify every major variables, quantify them, impact, conduct mutlifactorial analysis.

Public sick leave necesserally impact. helps sick people isolate stay home. enough paid public sick leave enter effective quarantine 14 days. federal gov. stepped created special one covid. Moreover, half transmition asymptomatic people, sick leaves really effect part problem.

Universal health care played big part, mostly population's trust health system, broadly public institutions. (That's one seriously fucking important factors US) also played big role capacity threat population. system accessibile, vulnerable people could taken care off. real risk health care system overpressured point triage. really important make sure every ressources system well invested. also social reaction people would normally go emergency rooms go year. afraid covid (lock-down effect), lot simply catch flu need use emergency rooms. (Our lock-down also prevented viruses ;) ) But, lot people covid simply go hospital. would say accessibility played big part. 

Other big factor : government call covid hoax winter. helps collectively organize overcome pandemic everyone lives reality. Seems like good first step plan closing Greek houses there’s good vaccine pandemic well-controlled. Yeah, faith people take seriously. Fauci Birx say whatever correct warnings they're gonna say, there's always gonna too-big portion too-stupid country thinks virus hoax go lives COVID gone.

TLDR: America gonna let virus burn vaccine widely available we've allowed sociopaths get levers power.  6% 190,000 keep new math? /s kid sick long school considers ""truant."" mean. look statistics flu deaths closer 61k. That's CDC. generally contained flu season throughout summer. Please take time go look CDC stats.

I’m doom gloom kind person, don’t understand whole “we gonna many deaths flu anyway” thought process 1% though. pretty much collective ""eh"", especially Florida, means following strict reopening schedule based % positive. Desantis mad people see numbers say spike. think he's probably underestimating people that. obviously backlogged data, little impact Florida now. means ur area nearly zero herd immunity Capitalism built life living though. computer use, schools learned at, car drive work etc etc. without capitalism drive success many advancements exist would benefit so. capitalism spurned ideas might save planet (sustainable energy, fuel efficient/electric cars,efficient appliances, sustainable forest management, improved health care systems products etc) look eastern block reign soviet union see slow progress drive create reward success.

To believe things would ""be better"" money/capitalism thing ""grass always greener"" fallacy filled ifs buts. Yes course system creates equality among people would fantastic, never done never done equal influence creates conflict peace- hence every major civilization history man leaders never true democracy citizens voted every decision. 1 - think adequately explained stupidity, I'll go that. legitimate problems hospitalization data reported (accuracy, timeliness, etc.). I'm guessing administration saw this, thought couple things -

* data inaccuracies makes us look terrible

* improve maybe look terrible differently

And naturally, every person administration incompetent fool, turned could better, problems got even worse, looked even worse it, they'd also stacked extra level public outrage reason. backfired hard pulled ripcord got out. Bunch idiots. 

2 - I'm really qualified say, complete answer complex difficult quantify experts seem good grasp either. guess, would say yes, seems case whenever area gets slammed hard unchecked covid spread, culture shift occurs months follow people start behave reasonably general. seems virus actually difficult contain initially supposed; anywhere adopted even basic measures mask compliance, forbidding gatherings, closing/limiting indoor eating/drinking seems see cases go freefall matter weeks, even making minor changes steep increase already occurring. 

And general nonscientific observation, seems ""standard"" progression virus country. I'm seeing pattern emerge. First hit hard Northeast March/April, late May 8 weeks later, well control there. several weeks later began sweep south southwest, saw massive mid-July spikes FL/TX/AZ/CA. now, roughly 6 weeks later, every one areas seeing virus recede pretty heavily. imagine another 2 3 weeks, July problem areas fairly control. today September kicks off, we're starting see signs virus gearing hammer mid-west, last remaining major region (other maybe northwest) seen huge spike yet. imagine we'll see cases spike throughout September, say mid November many recovered. whatever full explanation may happening, looking like pattern point. hand, studies showing antibodies fade based actual measurement.

It's like swab COVID-19 test. costs more, time consuming, useful wide scale merely seeing infected.

Again, confusing lack testing reinfection lack reinfection. like Trump, think exist tested for. Herd immunity plan. make seem like thing. We've known along. underlying issues affect more. Said person may lived another 20, 30, 40 years wherever underlying issues. covid, died today.

Density terms distance people (which different people divided area) we'd want know, sure that's collected well. e.g. New Zealand low population density area still urbanized.

Also, Taiwan dense Also registration might better worse (for example belgium registers 'suspicious' deaths covid, countries conformed cases).

The math works exponential growth organisms like viruses. start 10,000 significantly lower viral load someone starts 100,000 virus particles.

People die COVID much likely old, old people likely live past average life expectancy random person US. Also, pretty sure you’re talking criticisms making comments, peer reviewer (not like changes much anything). 

It would fair, want work averages, analyze average age death someone US ages 65-85+ average COVID-19 death. way, you’re working age group suffers vast majority COVID-19 deaths, it’s still simple easy understand metric since it’s average. 

I hope makes sense. course, factor fact people die COVID often comorbidities. I’m sure better studies come factor variables, I’m pretty certain still pretty significant average years life lost.

No, real question (that still answered) caused 8% drop Swedish GDP second quarter year. finally answer? still claiming migration significant change year, suddenly caused GDP drop dramatically. so, please present theory supports kind interpretation. 

Every economist commented drop says covid-19. None blame immigrants. 

What theory immigrants cause drop, professor?   Disney World reason go there. Next year lines really reallt short. Always billing (tm) virus breached quarantine Melbourne due colder weather able spread much quickly efficiently breakout Queensland would have. What's unfortunate rich working stuff like hydroponics farms printed meat, could literally affected this. Simply true. Masks determinant contracting COVID-19. Pre existing chronic conditions determine severity. two morbidly obese black women, one mask wearer not, contract COVID-19, equally likely develop severe case results death. I'll remind month early, 187k we're entering September everyone:   Ok, COVID kill own?

Should pretty thing answer, no? nice theory, nice context power actually works.

Who think written exam US history *actually* going exclude vote? People power put procedures place existing power. would X party say ""Gee, let's make harder people vote?"" don't, go ""Hmm, make harder party's supporters vote?"" 

Its also nice think highly educated people would vote interest Republic, lets real. They'd vote interests, since education class go hand hand, imagine voters holding purse strings federal, state local budgets education everyone else. 

Instead thinking ""How suppress vote idiots?"" maybe asking harder question, ""Why country create many stupid fucking people?!""  Absolutely; maybe gyms. could safe f2f school now. Sea level rise pretty slow (it's still rising 5000 years now). second half century, hundreds millions, perhaps billions, starve due crop failures. even then, they'll climate deniers. Well obvously they're saying based science Trump tells say would foolish trust them.

I also trust Russian scientists assume Putin tells say.

Idk saying things ""mass exrinction""? Covid kills 0.5% infected. January yes? example, China, spreading misinformation, closing internal flights actively promoting international flights? time noone knew serious would get. Obviously 0 possibility widespread testing. mess started March, btw.

All measures, well least sane ones, implemented. note NL lies next countries, neither totalitarian, developing, poor periphery.

The math regulatory framework based different, diseases delay severe. 
 
My broader point however, seem keep insisting non-Trump/politically rushed vaccine available reasonable time frame, true. leading experts concur this. likely

Are sure that? Yep roller coaster sure! Wishing family best. know mom tired right I’m trying bother worried calls texts. told would send check text everyday would love response it. I’m sure wants peace quiet feel stress phone. Hang there! Lol well since ""not sure counter argument"" really sure point exchange is. asked country better, answered. asked whether thought certain variables context important, answered. 

Now want know specifically deaths per capita? OK, NZ - 4 deaths/ million, better Canada 241 deaths / million, better US 567 deaths / million. want write peer-reviewed scientific study respond reddit comment section? 

Again though, i'm curious hear thoughts matter, i'll pose question you; country think better? know lot coronavirus 5 months ago. Thus, conclusions change. 

But yes, Fauci, much admire work, shot foot making statement. reasoning “so people actually need masks available” won’t shortage still could promoted homemade cloth masks. again, maybe saw different procedure outcome mind actually happened reality idk.

But Fauci say anything related “masks don’t work” you’re still wrong. statement “you don’t need wear mask” __not__ mean “masks don’t work”. again, can’t make choices based 5 month old conclusions. feel like tripped shoelace fell 103, would die.

I roll sleep wrong 103, would die. Oh my. read part well spat tea across room.  Yup. Unfortunately. best helped ways. I'm hit hard I'm lucky meds still reasonably priced even though gone bit. Really interesting story stop laughing read part:

Hamsters divided unmasked group masked group. Actually, make sense would like someone explain wearing mask prevent getting *severe* case covid. 

AFAIK, different sizes covid viruses bigger/worse one would blocked, get system, host replicate issue quantity. takes one. 

If I'm wrong I'd like know...  Trumplemathics (tm) Every Walmart curbside worker interacted amazing (I stock shop infrequently person) wish could tip them.   Thank you. I’ve cleaning house work always keeps busy. Hoping quick recovery. Glad hear uncle recovered. recently flew vegas, gambled have, flew back following mask guidelines...

Without legal requirements people *not* going what’s necessary. might worth considering much faster AZ would able get clinical trials done mass produce vaccine.

I've heard reasonable arguments comparative advantage giant pharma companies R&amp;D anything like that. comparative advantage getting potential drugs regulatory approval (clinical trials, talking government agencies, etc). That's basically partnership would be.  Aside renderings, none going happen. Airlines want spend money (and fair, probably can't afford it), pandemic ended ready.

Dude control, wear masks like puppet masters controlling fate. /s accept big mistake made outbreak started. Like former Soviet Union Chernobyl. lucky mind immune powers. stay strong brothers Circa two months ago called idiot defending use masks. redditor said *you idiot, masks protect you, protects people you*, I'm like, even case (in mind, wasn't; always believed masks protected both, better safe sorry etc.), since unknowingly asymptomatic use protect others, therefore everyone use protect others.

 Granted, Joe Rogan subreddit.  Mines devils lettuce chips ahoy. doesn’t take 90% herd immunity covid. baseless unsupported assertion. Based what’s happened Sweden, particular virus it’s likely 20% virus starts fizzle within community. (Not disappear completely slow significantly) Lo, indeed.   needs upvoted more. many illnesses invisible others strangers. people could see outside, CF, diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer survivor, kidney disease, would floored. People ""pre-existing health problems"" like half population. see getting sick acceptable functionally innumerate want pretend fine. stupidest fuckery. think meant every single person would get regardless. There's still wide range symptoms depending severity... part many people wear masks think they'll ""be fine"". Because. They. Are. Lying. data well available literature

Then make already. Anyone makes claims prepared back up. Even Vogue better source *nothing*. surgery Mexico 6000 usd including flight, saved 83,423.26 dollars so. ""... 2019 lowest mortality record (in past 30+ years, per capita)""

Just boost argument little. indded lowest mortality since 1977. comes per capita lowest ever recorded 30+ years go way back 1749, probably even longer measels smallpox data go back. I'm worried dryer air making way easier virus spread (much easier aerosolization). also think virus severe lot people winter weather weakens people's immune systems.

Now much interesting, since flu means little/nothing year. winter air make easier spread Covid? countries gone winter thing already... really seen much analysis winter affected them. refering to? like getting buffet get told expecting u afternoon tea full meal u can't eat.

No like paying $20 eat buffet, eating $100 worth food, getting pissed next time restaurant charges $100.  Insurance business lose money. “Now one us six months consider pandemic make judgments it, surely it’s time relax rules, individuals take personal responsibility make decisions risks they’re prepared run”

At least good job explaining idea terrible. civilized nations? nations gas stations grocery stores closed? Please fill us idiots  Well global survey, 74% respondents said would get it... reading article overrated. much insurance Generally speaking, risk come people room you. impossible get infected viral particles shredding someone *not* room, concentration would low risk infection close zero. long eat alone OK. really 

Fear got us mess. going get us it. depends province get slammed, even take seriously. lot people taking seriously. Businesses restrictions, large events entirely cancelled, even nothing protect themselves, benefits everyone else around protecting them.

This lightest flu season modern history. Thanks sharing idea this. always careful pick reliable seller seems pointless now! Good grief. Literally replying jokes ""karma points"".. fucking lame, reddit dumb lately makes sad pitiful sub caved another political shitshow barely actual coronavirus all. Scrolling posts, politics, politics, politics. disease ALREADY dire consequences economy. wont add fuel *that* fire.

Since first big wave spring, hospitalizations deaths significantly/appreciably increased anywhere, despite widely fluctuating case rates depending look.

If fearful virus, see actually is:
A virus quickly sadly killed large proportion eldery/infirm spring, since relatively stable *nearly* deadly.  UN sounds good enough, CCP paid almost “How would feel morally looked back months later said, know, could done this?” mayor asked.

Well ""How would feel morally looked back months later dozens teachers, staff, parents family dead""... 

They talk face masks hand sanitizer says nothing solid test plan contact tracing. show image classroom surprisingly looks like good social distancing, typical NY schools?

And especially teachers school officials clamoring delay person learning, feel properly set up.

I'm glad New York got virus less ""under control"" I'd fearful set tumbling back. Fucking garbage fat loser.. hate world you’re skeptic point isn’t anything convince you. man train tonight took mask sneeze 8 times putting back on. (Tokyo) smh glad grandmother aunts cousins got there, guy idiot getting people killed. stupid. suspending disbelief order put party ~~country~~ everything. actually citizen permanent residency paying Canadian taxes call bullshit pay would Texas are. 41 years never pay thing OOP medical care, multiple surgeries chronic condition requiring management. thing pay copay RX employment health benefits don’t pay (about $30 CAD year).

Also never wait necessary medical care. wait five months elective surgery much scheduling arrange time could take weeks work. times 1-2 months elective surgery. NEVER wait necessary care including emergency situations. get GP today appointment needed. pro-vaccine, pro-consent, anti-fascist camp? another reason religion cancer German here.

The named places open lockdown, restaurants closed unless provided take away meals (normal restaurants could also this). Schools closed well every location private amusement. Bowling centers, cinema, normal bars, swimming pools. Additionally, playground barred, park lingering forbidden, gatherings outside either family one person prohibited. 

But no, single shop sells stuff eat minimum requirement society (gas) ever closed. 2000 cases week? 

Florida: hold beer guess new candidates easy find information on, may even concidered majority people I'm going assume missed stories Michigan, Ohio state Penn state players, fans coaches complaining season canceled unfair players take away season. also proceeded look options play another conference could still participate fall season. secondary sources awful comes scientific research. would stop 75% population still susceptible far higher baseline density cities 100% susceptible?

There cohort people catch this. gets dropped jail meat plant, everyone catches it.  People like problem America. Thanks making country miserable #dicks Harambe sciences haste makes waste know people put 2 spaces periods, put 4 5? see familiar American medical system. outside &lt;40% filled masks, knows. protests spread it, maybe football wont either. unusual. Spanish Flu idea dealing also intermittent wave pattern comes big chunks. 

Once people realize severe epidemic present, hide transmission decreases. work Home Depot south fl 1/3 customers still come without masks, despite “mandatory”. management without backbone, much like governor, guess that’s happens. testing done report article essentially boils frequently shoving swap nose test subjects running rt-PCR test everyone uses. Detecting viable virus particles much complicated detecting viral RNA.

The rt-PCR test actually amplify live dead virus cells would detect either. 

The gold standard culturing virus lab injecting cells see cause cell damage death.

This rarely done though, requires Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) lab.

I can’t find now, remember reading mother isolated newborn birth COVID-19. Something like 60 days later still testing positive via rt-PCR. finally able live culture virus show longer infectious.. shedding dead virus. Well smart

I've umpteen know

It's basically like winter's cold varying severity healthy. bought drinks 10 days first started. lol 1/3 fraction - r/math confirmed independent world health body pretended seeing human-to-human transmission travel bans affected region would effective order protect political sensitivities one donors critical early stages outbreak. can, won’t work, can. fact works better replace us. benefits, eligibility unemployment.

Okay. employers required pay said vacation time utilized. offer less since people use it?

Absolutely NOT. We're outbreaks universities schools Michigan right now, Central Michigan University 176 cases two weeks. 

In-person school working, creating 2nd wave. always use baboon WH scientists creating vaccine...... people think trump lab concocting serum himself? honestly live country people forget FDA FULL scientists, companies making vaccines FULL scientists. agree everything that's said, reason can't go Europe weekend combination expensive flight plus timezone difference. costs us roughly $1000 USD fly Europe, sometimes more. worth going unless take entire week least. Weather/social patterns turning Midwest. go outside Southeast goes inside. summer waning last burst high humidity school/university back.

Midwest probably good winter. also welded people apartments. No, like China. Yesterday began show many covid symptoms (ie. Dry coughs, fever, headache, tiredness). But, woke next day felt completely fine. mean didnt corona? points stands, many country simply cannot afford repeated lockdowns, least strict first ones. might good solution NZ, could right one countries Nawww, communist dictatorship draconian things? Say ain't so! /s I'm Boston area colleges starting come back. I'm guessing October they'll close 4th person plans angrily yell protests government gives people mandated time they're still afraid take think cost jobs future raises. Problem solved. Instead tens millions unused vacation hours hundreds millions. Great solution. virus kills indirectly, yes. 

Did COVID destroy lungs, cause stroke, render kidneys useless...? think racism exists all? form? nobody ever racist? nobody ever racist? that's statement would mean. sure that's saying? literally said loud

""The goal testing reopen""
 
""We want testing show deaths decreasing""

They literally want numbers give measure deniability help push narrative hopefully make enough people stop paying attention everything go back normal matter many people getting sick. want narrative allow people convenient, comfortable position ignoring reality people getting sick around them. genuinely see current reality current numbers people dying reason shut things down, see testing asymptomatics nothing spook hurt economy god emperor's reelection chances. Burger King Wendy's, Tim Horton (gotta em all) Um, case noticed, people saying vaccines pretty major story line lately.... say vaccines proven cause almost 0 side effects 60 years injections one forced get vaccine when, especially ""at risk."" 

Now, say free things like send kids school everyone else vaccine them? Probably thats great way fuck everyone. WTF masks mandatory indoors Canada already??? let go back home though....They resources watch over/take care hundreds sick kids. one student Covid dies quarantined campus, imagine clusterfuck would ensue afterwards University. I'm saying go school I'm real. Corona bad damage Us English went abroad took places brought back What, nordic socialist country making people pay health care? muh socialism know mean. reopen America protest killing people. Wow snowflake. would said Republicans investigating democrats. realist religious political zealot. Typical radical leftist - personal attack disagree someone. Says much character me. Fake news someone complaining get trial site. Got sources apart baseless accusations Western media (who remember, told us Iraq WMDs throwing people's babies ground, even 3/4 times year told us Kim Jong Un dead) NED funded us gov't mouth pieces, Adrian Zenz allegedly asking 8 mystery people may may even exist? Case-demic across Europe right now.. 

Should driving policies cases? key stats hospitalisations deaths, yet completely overlooked. Absurd. ^ real reason casinos open Detroit concept comes fact respiratory viruses propagate much lesser extent summer. Things like flu common cold far common winter summer. multiple reasons might be, conclusion summer, reproduction rate (the number people infected 1 infected person, average) viruses goes down.

And reproduction rate goes far enough, drops 1 (each infected person infects less 1 average) infection end disappearing (at least locally).

The decrease reproduction rate noticeable, big. diseases like flu fairly low reproduction rate begin (in part due various levels immunity people previous exposure and/or vaccinations) summer-effect able push 1.

There indications summer similar effect reproduction rate SARS-CoV-2. since reproduction rate SARS-CoV-2 much higher flu (due lack immunity previous infections due simply different contagious virus), summer-effect nearly enough drive reproduction rate 1. Dudes joke now? Oh mean last 5 presidents. thing joke lame comment. Covid hears you, covid care Dumb idea. We're outbreaks universities schools Michigan right now, like Central Michigan 176 cases two weeks. many thousands people died mistakes? I'd guess: a) public transportation packed mask help much, b) poverty keeping buses/vans full people can't afford work, c) lot TB survivors lingering respiratory problems. Please tell else vote for, ass hole. would like help country too. Last time checked everybody Joe Ronald dropped get ""organ"" bullsht conspiracy from?

Did recently teleport dimension? ;-) sound like ignorant piece trash. Get help, loser. college classes online. cancelled one FTF class looking forward to. despise online classes. miss friends desperately stupid zoom hangouts whatever long, long gone. supposed done now. Yes, I’m completely 100% it. don’t really get choice I? blow NJ this. district thing (central NJ), many schools person starting early next week. CDC reduced death count related widely shared social media posts suggest U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention “backpedaled” number deaths caused COVID-19, AP Fact Check finds that’s true

Get Facebook Tennessee make sense. Hypertension make likely murdered, preexisting conditions make likely die COVID. I'm trying downplay making sound like amplifying risk factors virus indisciminate killing help anyone either. wish teachers this! Thank caring much students. protesters maybe defending post offices foreign agents. Let’s make two years argument stays that’s realistic timespan either vaccine enough knowledge minimize risks Except true. put covid covid. go check make sure heart attack indeed caused covid. covid mean every death caused it. referring cases. Florida almost 200k New York does. far deaths (and cases) go, already know Florida doctoring numbers may never know many people Florida died COVID. OMG nooooooooooooooo doomed! right along! Oh sorry. misread it. mistake. 5 days gets call DCFS. 10 days gets home visit.

A friend child number health problems. DCFS worker came knocking. sat kitchen table friend laid medical appointment paperwork made read every page. We’ve know months. 

I saying numbers reported peak mobility decrease error.

I saying using wrong misleading way compare take account Florida tourist destination.

asking number shows understand talking about. US seems country fixated testing sewage honestly wonder why. What's different US makes even viable strategy? people like talk shit? dont believe comment directed anything said tbf  like ""if Dumbasses"" *correct answer: true*

it’s audacity 😂😂 Lol, big whoop, that’s drop bucket. source this? keep hearing this, yet one provide source right wing conspiracy website agree general consensus excess deaths attributable Covid (either directly indirectly). Though, think you’re right saying unemployment indirectly kill hurt people (e.g. heat exhaustion AC, lower nutrition higher exposure pollution, drugs, crime, etc...). thing measure number people die different causes ones related unemployment ones making gap recorded Covid-19 deaths excess deaths.

[This link CDC Pneumonia &amp; Influenza Scroll bottom says “P&amp;I Mortality Surveillance”, you’ll see pneumonia influenza deaths year compare past years. notice numbers year much higher previous years, y-axis measures % total deaths, recall higher year previously, numbers would even larger scale absolute % total.

But astounding part chart pneumonia influenza deaths started rise astronomically *right moment* normally decline. Additionally, people using masks, working home, socially distancing whole (to varying degrees, undeniably greater previous years). possible explanation pneumonia influenza deaths rise sharply time you’d expect all-time lows due measures taken?

I’ve yet hear reasonable alternative explanation misattributed Covid deaths. alternative explanation? lol? I'm exposing everyday unlike Reddit cushy WFH jobs. confirmed voting Trump. may ""left social issues"", somehow decided okay voting fucking fascist? conservative, also telling us hypocrite. many conservatives voting Trump. people, okay, maybe common differences. You, much. figured everyone would. virus can’t spread nobody spread to. actually people suggested. month like “screw this. Nobody cares”. Newsom great job handling pandemic California, understand issue? % contagious % viral debris? unrelated heart attack

Who claiming they’re unrelated?  Even including pneumonia nowhere near 183,000 died. died natural causes/accidents tested positive corona. sure someone died heart attack directly related COVID idea exactly virus yet? Especially since average age death 78. much likely heart attacks brought age pre-existing illness. one asking basic questions Fauci promoted equivalent God media.  I'm gonna mister silver lining here, theres going lot less people dying old age next years. And? Risk succumbing age same. wear mask I'm out. avoid large gatherings use hand sanitizer immediately leaving store. whole family gets yearly flu shots. anti vaxxers.

I take 'Trumpcinne.' thinks rushing public win points election day. I'll happily take covid vaccine properly tested shown safe. answer, situation sucks humans. Falcon saying knew good daughter, individually. Falcon control environment vs hazards point drop &amp; classroom. 

Plus others saying masks 10. didn’t even know thing Falcon kids. Airflow makes outdoor transmission essentially zero. Remember transmission requires certain length time, air moving freely becomes difficult exposed long period. It’s doubtful lower temperatures much impact that. Yeah meeting room full 1st graders parents. us valid reasons absences. ridiculous targeting little ones one pissed. think even prosecuting attorney paying lip service lecture it. Running tests multiple times norm. flying blind. PCR test way sensitive hinge literally everything to. 90% positives actually sick contagious, entire testing process joke. understand that, people. want get this, starts here. Identify sick quarantine there. 

Deaths hospitalizations way important part. seems powers care that, however. Trump resorts empty, really think that? preexisting condition. get coronavirus they'll 94%. COVID listed cause death, well cause death per medical expert filled death certificate. every one deaths COVID listed cause death. funding based attendance. sick child costing money can't afford lose any.  office workers sitting home since March: saying employers slowly try gaslight come back office? 
My office trying slow reopening people unmask desk wear masks walking around. Many vacationing, going out, joking masks. Management visibly without masks office. Management also used conservative verbiage, comparing flu stating wont let people know someone gets sick. 

I’ve following updated studies informed enough response seems AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WTF WRONG YOU

which course professional. anyone draft sent employer stating good idea go back? legal protection? Either Biden gets elected starts something pandemic (there months lag time actions yield results), vaccine developed effectively eliminates risk. things see happening open short term. maybe political pressure US government open border becomes much medium term government forced open border placate hostile US government. fucking flu. People die flu every year yes...and vaccine it, less people YEAR die flu died 4 MONTHS this. Car accidents disease human human transmission preventable proper measures. **Diiiiiiirt baaaaalllll!!!!** doesnt issue warning rioters fish rots head. teachers expert virus, kids need learn. Dumb comparison heck secondary insurance? citizens talking about? Thank fuck I'm Texas Florida. NYC bad enough May, learned lesson hard way. Viral myocarditis well known entity, people don’t always recall inciting illness. cardiologist It’s really hard believe. I'm Nursery school teacher feel like hypocrite telling pupils afraid I'm probably afraid are. talking about? isn’t true. New York still almost 3x number deaths Florida two states similar populations. Well, find place people could actually afford living instead top 10%. accused cheering virus. believe virus contained impact minimized compared now. *China

We already knew Trump handle problem like bring problem existence.

It's like blaming kid able handle fixing engine. China broke engine, hired someone qualified fix one. Bark right tree. Always go source problem, degrees separated it.  bulk comorbidities respiratory failure pneumonia, directly caused COVID, pre-existing conditions like diabetes could weaken immune system function. Diabetes listed 17% them, example. cross-functional collaboration R&amp;D folks last year part scale manufacturing, determine process steps behaving differently. transition GMP environment eye-opening some, jaw-dropping others. incredibly bright PhD-level people. different normal environment, like said.

After month general consensus ""We better understanding challenges guys face making process work scale... we're glad stay lab give expertise there."" excellent team-enhancing activity around. fucking care. doesn't. reduce infections conscientious people like yourself. every one you, plenty people either can't afford recognized positive want inconvenience.

Rapid testing hands public without oversight lead kinds people higher levels improperly placed confidence. LOL Parent here. adding tally parents care. Lots us choosing homeschool return classroom. won’t hear much us though we’re exhausted balancing work teaching functioning parent. Stop judging parents stereotype (I agree people really parents). vaccine then? Also, can't give kids 4 months reason. Teachers ready teach, admin can't get buildings safe plan keep safe, remote happen I’ve gotten real, professional help. Coping mechanisms usually glorified distractions. Yes, it’s good able focus something else little bit, stand said product circumstances good mental health pandemic don’t tend play nice together. result people “trying hard enough.”  might change: close I'd give Trump better even odds win despite huge unpopularity (he already sabotaged post office block mail ballots likely rig electronic voting machines used person swing States) thing wearing looks like covering mask would. see issue that, either. last days I’ve feeling like I’m going pass walking single flight stairs. heart absolutely races minute two feel like I’m going die. Ive thought going emergency room times week. previous cover related symptoms. happened try isolate socially depending endless amounts cash. US plague state. Zombies meme? mass shooting Vegas got less attention instance (pick one) single black person getting killed last year.

Basically can't put good person's face front tragedy everyone get behind event quickly forgotten. Agreed. It’s bad. best treatment COVID-19 get infected. Sadly still know side effects disease. I've read many stories someone ""cured"" days weeks suddenly die young age due cardiac commodities. Large portions citizens buy secondary insurance. So, essentially years then..given current situation...   No. society creates many perverse incentives. people incentivized return positive test. They're going test. employers want test; won't. on. Lead Paragraph:

Lithium shown capacity to: a) inhibit replication several types viruses, similar SARS-CoV-2 virus, b) increase immune response reducing lymphopenia, c) reduce inflammation preventing reducing cytokine storm. present study, treated six patients severe COVID-19 infection lithium carbonate. found lithium carbonate significantly reduced plasma reactive C-Protein levels, increased lymphocyte numbers decreased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, improving inflammatory activity immune response patients. propose lithium carbonate may deserve place treatment COVID-19. That's literally comorbidity affects body. word. literally separate cause co-factor death.  feel like death rate way higher simply everything standstill since feb/march. many usual deaths dropped like car accidents &amp; workplace accidents yet rate still usual. relevant what's happening. related article researching team UK reported effects Covid-19 effects metal health brain (from neuroscience perspective) due isolation, aside effects described another indicator depression.  
 
Honestly, short vids help explain best me. many people mixing means death certificate. whole thing roll authoritarianism. tests done using PCR device detect viral load. Remember fruit tested positive? one problem faced scam people actually sick. That's asymptomatic comes in. supposed hospitals run ghost town. want move us controlled society like China tool using. Consecutive cumulative? worst! Covid shot death doesn’t make Covid cause death though. deaths patients Covid cause death, died testing positive (unlike UK figures).

Some Covid deaths would people vulnerable norovirus, flu, etc., would killed next minor infection come along, simply weakened another terminal condition. case it’s still cause death, excess mortality e.g., six months year. exception rather rule. 

Even then, still killed Covid, like someone murdered get shot jumping tall building. already know works. look real world data. Japan, South Korea, etc. know masks prevent air freely flowing body air turns prevents virus filling rooms hallways. them.  worry, married Lake girl could fuck enemy Short answer: like New Zealand is. Put actual experts control. Preach. Middle school awful. HVAC systems typically combine recirculated fresh air.  probably apply lessons learned indoor environments anywhere indoors outdoors people close quarters extended periods time. ""Everything’s open since beginning August""
You misspelled June. par course folks, complete unnecessary self-own (hyping plasma) made ""great plan"" kind moot. 

Any vaccine announcement going raked. news worthy surprising anyone? generally page COVID widespread, extremely contagious would found students go school? Wear mask open everything back up. live virus, shelter place indefinite amount time. Wait Australia gotten turnaround time testing 24-48 hours guys still waiting 12 days results??? time. used 10-15 place times week, \~50 month. always people, COVID would probably irresponsible. Honestly don’t even think mental health services help. Human beings simply aren’t built this. You’re going mentally healthy self-isolation living constant fear virus. It’s done, speaking here, don’t think therapist going fix me.

Plus mental health help received form “this hard everyone, practice hobby” complete horseshit really. Aaaand censored

That's happens put truth  funny even American fake denial numbers double certain country's total, including excess death too

United States Projection, lol Occupant WH worried eviction past November. Hell yeah! Although, hated part life lol Human logic notoriously bad dealing microscopic things. things, study effects different mask approaches, hard due confounding factors (that also many things different places). indications masks effect studies, situation Europe countries different mask rules, seem go drain relatively similarly ...

That's much doubt among actual epidemiologists. really layman groups sub one side blind anti-maskers aide think ""obvious"". simply isn't. Coming back future make statement? many tested? preventative measures taken reopening. There's lot opportunity learn article would supply information. you’re Texas. speak neighborhood Facebook page full people claiming made up, kids can’t spread virus asymptotic, CDC lying everything.

The district article school district. Pull pants stop playing yourself. Jesus. people. really hung people last 6 months? answered article reason though.... kids hard hearing often rely lip reading understand said.

[Useless love analogy falsifying information.Just someone covid died mean covid caused death. covid magically make immune health issues. covid mean can't unrelated heart attack. covid shot mean died covid. Compare Switzerland, one expensive healthcare systems Europe:

* pay $150 $500 per month depending kind gold plated spoons want, case ever end hospital
* pay something $0 $1500 per year ""out pocket"", depending much pay per month.
* case ever something chronic (i.e. anything needs treatment multiple months), ""out pocket"" capped automatically prevent bleeding dry got something serious.
* limited sick days. sick, still get salary paid. Even gone months.
* Health insurance mandatory. cannot afford (i.e earn less $1000-$2000 month, depending family situation), state pays it.

Fyi. looked 2017, bad year flu, one worse. 50k people 65 died. nursing homes. without looking many died actual nursing homes, know less 50k.

This year, isnt over, claimed around 80k nursing homes. double nursing home deaths year isnt 2017 huge average flu year. best stance still shows wrong are. end   school, cooler weather, big holidays ...

Whats next, Bezos' evil plan make wear scarf?!?!?!

No one cares debt. Trump followed precedent successor critical component stopping spread convincing 40% hoax-ers ain’t hoax. Eventually see friends relatives die start changing minds. least while.

CDC lied prevent run masks. wearing masks, unlike shoes, clothes, unnatural devil’s mark! Today got little bit wet cuffs wearing rain coat. Guess bothered There’s ZERO deception CDC’s part “only 6%” nonsense. They’ve reporting numbers way — including percent Covid cause listed death certificate— since least early May.

This “only cause mentioned” clause isn’t anything new.

Unfortunately Fauci CDC told everyone first masks would help don’t wear them. tons people won’t change mind. Hase George Carlin nailed years ago...

'Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.' Ayyyyy Florida man. assume vaccine examined/approved FDA also examined Canada rather country looking approve version. even discussing specific vaccine point? articles look simply say he'd willing consider fast tracking one mention specific trials. I'm saying they're thing. trying explain biggest quarterly drop Swedish GDP ever migration slowly going down, much easier explanation explains drop every country, namely coronavirus. 

Yes, racist get. Seems like route every school going. Ugh! Data deaths following completed investigations indicate 98.1 percent (1,289) people died contracting disease underlying condition, chronic lung disease, serious heart ailments, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease mean many fewer Canadians actually handled COVID ALL, pretty obvious Americans handled MORE. 

And, Americans, know BETTER.

Therefore Americans handled COVID BETTER.

Q.E.D. Convinced exactly? wearing mask reduces chance getting infected would reduce severity illness. CNN article weeks ago saying various non-mask coverings like neck fleeces bandanas helping actually worse mask due way respiratory droplets split smaller particles travel air wearing mask keeps hands away face keeps overall state vigilance. Even mask nothing better on. fucking kidding? think we've 200k extra deaths loss healthcare alcoholism? 

We see anything like Great Recession (and options health care state exchanges). Alcoholism mostly killsong-term.

See, trying get record saying think causing hundreds upon hundreds thousands extra deaths - anybody reading knows utterly ridiculous. doesn’t make sense compare average life expectancy average age death either, I’m sure know that. know average life expectancy includes entire population, people likely live older age get older. compare something basically brought young part America disease mostly kills old people? doesn’t make sense. That’s analyzing data right either. Virtually one dies age 50, people age 50 bring average life expectancy someone US. 

Most die ages 70 85+ too, absolutely roughly compare average COVID-19 death age life expectancy individual. makes sense compare every age 65-90 somewhere around there, try make average using 77 reference point. this, analyze majority COVID-19 deaths. It’s still rough estimate, concern virtually squashed then, because, like said, captures die COVID-19 makes data individualized per age death. concern wasn’t even great first place, since deaths 65 anyway. fact wouldn’t apply well someone younger (for example, 30 like said) doesn’t matter much. 

Plus I’m sure you’ve read Well CDC saying unscientific stuff Trump wants say. Trump took tight control recently.

So there's mystery. OK science based, bow Trump based instead. Trump's case, non-alcoholic beer. Wearing mask = less load mouth nose. 

Goggles = less load eyes wear mask – even cloth mask – typically exposed lower dose coronavirus didn’t.

From article. think so, no. 50 year old male, get covid-19, get pneumonia, get ARDS die, death certificate would three conditions. That's normal say anything overall health.

Had person lived, life expectancy would additional 30 years. both.jpeg Context everything. Yes, try contact tracing nothing else, worthless. everything else ignore contact tracing, achieve good results. 

Just look important contact tracing countries contained virus. want anything crazy, basic mental fitness test. think people least know they're voting they're going vote? would like border close going forward....hold on...aren't guys advocating building wall?? field. fact, Special Ed experience (504s/IEPs) really helped me. remote. lot remote companies there. big believer public education, given crap going politics thus schools, I'm out. Canada part America.... doesn’t. shows voluntary reduction mobility, slight one.  

One DeSantis part discouraging. 

Florida really weeks things closed, exception Miami / palm beach area. Handled!? can’t use past tense, America’s still mishandling pandemic dont recall here... first hit US mainland someone told government would token service, try look good, end push herd immunity. 

Looks like need hunt person give gold. 

If still alive, is... “So well think US handled COVID-19?”

Third Americans: yes Cruise ships petri dishes even outside current outbreak Weirdos think may real question is, happens second wave?

I guess herd immunity strategy, re-infections show anything, dangerous gamble. Herd immunity apply vaccinations. We've done every year flu, even prior flu vaccines. key difference, course, mortality rate. bad year, various flu varieties kill 40k people US, typical years around 1:10000. 2 **million** people projected due COVID-19 somewhat higher...  reduced mobility 68 percent. National avg 65 percent. That's insane suspect much behaviours mask wearers--observing social distancing guidelines such--as actually mask face. won’t get accurate reporting Trump office, wether means November 4 years.

That’s honestly scary thought. 

This partisan, unfortunately it’s not. Good luck finding legit surgical mask, seal comparable face use?  Agreed said still feels pretty shitty would depend measures put place. 

People mocked Disney World opening, yet mandatory measures place likely safest place Florida be. expected different, got played. lol America thinking several obvious things could be. Lots people lost jobs, it, health care. Fewer people access health care bad mortality rates.

We also know depression spiked, causing shortage Zoloft, alcohol drug abuse also went shutdowns. Alcohol sales spiked 55 percent shutdowns, sure percentage drugs. Together causes killed 200k year pre-pandemic. 50 percent spike would account another chunk.

The lineups food banks ridiculous places. people hungry can’t great mortality rates, even nobody dies starvation itself, good nutrition generally contributes longevity.

I heard people working conditions nursing homes intended keep Covid pretty bleak live under. people already fragile states, could cause people go downhill faster normal.

Could lots things. Data deaths following completed investigations indicate 98.1 percent (1,289) people died contracting disease underlying condition, chronic lung disease, serious heart ailments, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease necessarily.

Also, read definition comorbidity is. cause effect relationship, simply condition exists alongside. SARS-CoV-2 known cause sorts conditions alongside COVID-19 article:

""[CBC’s expanded Pew, quoting [a delicious Leger poll asked Canadians Americans nation better handled outbreak. Apparently, 87 per cent Canadians said national response “much” “somewhat” better U.S., 38 per cent Americans agreed. Fine. get this.

""It long past time Administration finally implement national plan contain crisis, still killing hundreds Americans day.” Yikes

He even posted chunk took agree article never said anything conclusive. really never conclusive evidence virus primarily transmitted aerosols. Although know flu measles does, it’s never scientifically proven. It’s basically overwhelming circumstantial evidence. evidence mounting COVID-19 primary means transmission. It’s important changes messaging prevention measures.

The dark ages called want trope back goal testing identify currently sick contagious. PCR test sensitive rely 30 cycles. many lab run test considered 'positive?' 

Most places absolutely test symptomatic easiest way I've found block someone reply them, get reply something stupid back (which also confirms fool and/or troll), block inbox screen. ""Car accident"" cause death; would almost always listed death certificate ""blunt force trauma"" variant.

Death certificates capture lot relevant information how/why patient died. vary one state next person filling obviously prone errors/omissions time time, like rest us. reason many public health officials universities launched studies comorbidities associated Covid-19.

What point trying make? Access private business privilege, right. 

What came house demanding act differently want to.

Come morons, unto others, respect neighbour shit.

Geezuz. objectively untrue. Every substance vaccine already used medicine before. new substance like thalidomide. potential problems interaction problems. Every individual ingredient already tested before.  American history, probably not. Entire world history, even close. Since Republicans ever given fuck choice It’s 1 - 1/R0 R0 reproduction number uninfected population.

R0 initially looked like ~3, 60-70% numbers came from.

Reducing transmission (e.g. social distancing wearing masks) reduces R0. US it’s probably something like 1.2, requiring 15-20% population (which states like AZ FL peaked hit numbers).

So herd immunity currently achievable, possibly fragile, aiming numbers terrible policy. 2007 review academic literature nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found ""over past two decades, efforts estimate fiscal impact immigration United States concluded that, aggregate long term, tax revenues types generated immigrants—both legal unauthorized—exceed cost services use.” Testing too- can’t really say it’s decline cases. like don’t ask don’t tell. Massive international plot requires multiple world leaders damage thier economies anger thier voters, make Trump look bad he... Says mean things?  inevitable pandemic hits, man failed business ventures fails response he's bad job. tell scenarios occam's razor favors go boys! Yea, called Republicans. Right think we’d seen hard hit areas see resurgence now. Take NYC example. saw 10k cases day even things locked down. Things open long time they’ve maintained almost case count per day (a fraction peak looked like). scale entire state, NJ smashed curve. highest population density country almost everything opened it’s status quo much longer period time. haven’t seen indications states gone horrible, intense wave resurgence expected. look active cases. They've stuck 500 Edmonton last month. Calgary fluctuating around well. get logic really do.

Trump sent prison unless capitalism everything goes abolished first.

Imprisoning old political enemies dangerous precedent set far right still access running office.

Is valid reason imprison him? Yes. NextTrump^TM starts DoJ imprison enemies, reasons won’t valid. Like many reasons police make kill imprison black people (planted drugs, thought holding gun, unpaid ticket), they’ll first manufacture reason second.

That’s line one left fascism want establish precedent crossing, even means one horrible person sadly gets hook. I’m saying there’s science says doesn’t hurt. There’s science back helps you’re near another person, *because humans source virus*. 

I see people wearing masks 1000 feet others every single weekend go state park near house. also see people 20ft everything between.

Wearing alone, far people, purpose, sort weird virtue signaling. So, “wear fucking mask” you’re near humans, sure, there’s science says need wear far alone. Even [recommendations CDC]( says social distancing fine, unless can’t maintained, mask help. It’s terrorism tell people everyone going get virus accept fate. hire actual effective teacher cost prohibitive. Well blanket statement. almost like wearing mask works Yes actually come survey every single American polls handful morons like last place want deathly ill cruise ship. guy trying sell book. Phase 2 testing testing safety testing. purpose Phase 3 testing test efficacy vaccine. work efficiently, need people change normal behavior. need know come contact potentially infected people determine “real vaccine” group “no vaccine” control group statistically different comes. portions test population stay isolation don’t get meaningful results. Word mouth community helping contact tracing... need swat team that?  So, tried drinking bleach? Hmmmmmm? think so! knock it! tasty teeth super white. Surely individuals handled better others.   Opening schools COVID hot zone huge unnecessary risk right now. give damn dead New Yorkers use prop defend fat boys Yep agree 100% Oh see. truth lockdowns threat pandemic probably caused us go paths previously would've never taken. Well apparently 1/3 US take coronavirus vaccine even available, helps illuminate reasons why. think something big deal probably go way get vaccinated it. Makes sense Ultimately, think there's way knowing sure many deaths ""true COVID deaths

There's almost way know anything sure, statistics group CDC published [another majority deaths COVID-19 reported death certificate (approximately 95%), COVID-19 selected underlying cause death. Fighting covid M16s 🇺🇸 sub removes repeated information could part issue States still slowly reopening.

Two weeks see another headline deaths rise. India badly means China must too. Apparently countries neighbouring China get message (85,048) publicly notes 82x fewer case non-China Asia (6,981,182), 73x fewer US (6,211,682). Using Chinese neighbours like Korea example, Korea imported 68x non-China Asia (1,271) 45x America (856) China (19) 27 Aug 2020.

As such, China's public figures considered reliable rather never fully closed borders China since lot Koreans work there, relatively similar number Koreans working US. U Fayetteville, whoever wondering. Total number active cases around 220 according article, starting classes last week Yep, sweden still snuck little bit ahead. We'll pass end week. news. literally misrepresentation chart that's months. That’s generic response, filled flaw everyone’s reused guess that’s got, it’s got. accuracy numbers cdc website, find right one.

that said, he's positive 50% true he's he's negative nearly 100% true he's negative, makes sense It’s crazy, isn’t it? Like...there’s compassionate human somewhere, bringing surface way save person know. it?? :(  doctors gave something proven RTCs work, wanted snake oil! I'm super upset gave best treatment available potentially saved life. charlatans! Oh wow. retract previous comment sounds super.. uh.. *sigh* -- internet ruined us. country drawn regionally seems followed pretty similar pattern. think thing keep eye going forward whether hard hit areas resurgence. refunds Wow Already happened North Carolina **pikachu face*

/s That’s historically stupid lol, imagine medical professional users sub tearing hair out. reason better understanding average person im curious biology, body amazing, etc.. ppl won’t bother read past headline. Yeah, that's going matter long boomers nimbys continue get increasing property values. * New resi construction increased 23% July August 
* Home sales general picking up. Resi market red hot general
* Many companies beating earnings calls big ways contrary news outlet reporting state broader economy
* Unemployment declined April onward
* First time jobless claims continue fall
* Alcohol sales shot roof March, online sales increasing 200% (Winc online new membership increased 340% March even though everyone saying afford put food table)

WFH going globalize white collar labor market like we've seen happen blue collar already. Worldwide competition put downward pressure wages work remote increases competition lowers scarcity. 

We see huge rent price drops people leave major cities

Crazy stuff news always seems focus negative side things. Translation, news loves talk small percentage people struggling attempts apply broader economy actuality, fiscal relief given CARES states reopening forced winners losers large scale. see ""the rich getting richer"" laugh they're trying say working class American rich/doing well not. anything, wages working class stagnated way long we're seeing happen economy attention given keep running. really sell home though comes non rent-paying tenant can't evicted indefinitely? end government directly causing landlord damages unequal interference. get wrong, think eviction freeze much needed. agree earlier poster also mortgage freeze balance provide relief landlords. government effectively taking away livelihoods small-time landlords, business picking winners losers context. end ""winners"" banks worth protecting? Using logic, took risk issuing mortgages investment well. contracts mortgages collateral, tenants landlords. worry FL, Gov Rona DeathSentence promised pesky lockdowns attempt save lives! Omg yes, it’s pain. I’m fortunate enough work home son stay gets sick. Unfortunately one school year caught terrible bug school week. principal called stated days left miss I’d taken court. following school year really started enforcing important students miss school matter situation. It’s infuriating. Absolutely. We're told vote (as should), truth lying continue held personally accountable lying public. 

It's abuse public office. 7 deaths. Taipei major city 2.5m people theyve basically stopped spread virus. true might concerned freaking kidding me? already another super spreader event Sturgis? Sturgis armpit America. another anatomical structure. one says ""Fuck us money"". Yah, 800 human beings all. few. mean many die, right? /s


Again, humans everyone easily dismiss support theory lessening restrictions.


Even you, fact creating positive negative thing brings point lack empathy. know doom gloom there, trying find positive right like trying find positive midst unnecessary war... don't. honor sick losing lives, absolutely prevent unnecessary sickness death.


Edit: I'm saying people's lives need negative, wish people would stop commenting positive things still horrific situation. [We can’t help ""Colossally stupid"" favourite phrase description myself. viruses probably get physically carried air. question is, process render non-viable? Trump “great” stock market 2019 every economist warned signs point imminent recession. Obama’s economy healthy enough keep going couple years. pretty reasonable assume Trump’s main goal office make borrowing money cheaper ever, would inflate markets incompetence corruption collapse entire government. definitely didn’t think twice investing first two years Trump. read article? love little pre planned speech ready go

Its cute 

Did go way expected? What's better learn home? catching virus taking home? catching friend? think getting pretty close.

So many people think Canada shut harder fewer anti-maskers.

Neither why. Nail screen guards exist. think about, even safer barber can't use one. Maybe giving kids time develop interests let achieve goals instead forcing learning 20year old 80% unimportant stuff judge live it. Kids ain't stupid, loose interest learning they're forced learn stuff hate

I think homeschooling could great way parents children try many different things specifically fit child, focusing one (two, three) kids alone strengths weaknesses instead forcing 30 different kids learn like smart fast one

Also bullying home hope Nail screen guards exist, even sit facing other, try now, non issue. rain! chine cammie haoxx!!! rushed keep crybaby's happy. Trump plenty logical people know reason rush vaccine, lock act like world's fire. whatever reason though, left tunes cnn &amp; reddit 

(ran good ole ccp,no wonder china portrayed perfection here)

Yet still can't grasp they're bullshitted. Y'all cried vaccine great President say's problem I'll put everyone &amp; get quick possible!

 Even though knows pissing money away &amp; needed point. us think already herd immunity. weak already died part hense cases dropping 5 weeks strait. 

The one's depending Govt. hold hand tell safe walk outside now, drastically weaken immune system sheltering inside house 8 months btw. next cluster infections/deaths. They're big reality check vaccine works 60% time best, probably closer 40% reality. thing count save ass getting phenomena &amp; getting vented. know vented ass grass. covid kill vent will. 

TL/DR Trump ask &amp; still ungrateful ignorant fault rushed.. definitely dem clan pushing fear followers making mountain mole hill right? universe vaccine &amp; rushed one that..Trump's idea? pelosi fauci fraud trying use sanity leverage turn money printer back on. Trump coddle entire left like they're bunch adult children would went herd immunity &amp; stronger country it. But, Adult Children make political everything side fence. ??? comparing politicizing disease scientific fact? ""I'm bad situation I'll make easier forcibly making bad people"" got situation start with. ""this situation"" mean modern America generally. news water wet mad tho Let’s look obviously dead.

What group think would higher mortality rates group average: 100 percent access health care? 90 percent do? Devo great. lot songs (besides well known ones) would say apply today's world. (See: Joko Homo, Gates Steel, see music video Beautiful World, one well known one, Freedom Choice.) Devo formed losing friends Kent State Protests. name comes concept De-Evolution. Mass child sacrifice? Data shows that, comes young children Covid really dangerous typical flu season. Less ways, becuase majority young children get infected little symptoms   10 days need Dr. note. 

Last year, son missed week needed eye surgery. first 5 days missed point sent back Dr. note. colds later hit 11 days absent total said needed Dr. note on. felt like first 5 days shouldn’t counted Dr. note those, expected us take Dr. damn cold Dr. absolutely didn’t want us coming something didn’t need treatment could spread every person going office.

I get need try make sure kids going school, it’s overkill. live Houston area working home two little ones feeling extreme guilt lack socialization taking much longer get work tasks done. makes feel bit better decision keep daycare. no, stop. making much sense almost many small businesses fucked regardless ever job work really hard little pay fill core job functions, manager always walking things top it?

Yes? hypocrite.

No? terrible. Yes lets completely unknown virus know nothing long term effects run wild amongst young population. ever go wrong?!

Not disgusting selfish literally sacrifice elderly poor people (the people jobs easily get infected + pre existing conditions) economy it’s also EXTREMELY short sighted. ten years turns virus attacked organs (which btw) way men become infertile? Isn’t worth 1 year keeping people indoors prevent? Objectively better hospitals verge overrun like 2 months ago people wearing masks taking seriously.. really hard comprehend? Nope border fully open. Yup. got detention 5 times high school. Never behavioral stuff, always many tardies absent sick many days. sick 3 days per semester high school, weren’t allowed go field day sit back school kids shitheads got suspended shit. nerd got sick lot days sucked ass course important number. kind ridiculous talking point that. would mean vaccine unsafe general public risk needed taken.

Is it, though? see particular reason take risk. risk COVID already negligible. infuriating thing child school handed back fucking math assignment points show work problems require level effort. 

Do thing exactly say suffer consequences! better? Kids can't pay attention much tech hands young age, even issues paying attention 15 mins zoom senior college. 

Not mention kids busy homes without good place sit concentrate, furthering gap kids room kids live bad areas.  Perfect attendance awards incredibly bad idea, even normal times. 

You win either (a) getting lucky getting sick (b) infecting classmates teachers went school sick. Neither worthy award. sure? animals opposite, recall reading study monkeys intentionally reinfected mounted superior immune response

Moreover, reinfections rare many asymptomatic *wouldn't* hear them, would hear exceedingly rare instances becoming serious, could confirmation bias Strange... thought Swedish hospitals problem dealing limited number cases reported... refusing patients conditions simply keep beds unoccupied?

Is kept hospitals ""overwhelmed""? Yeah yeah, empathy, thats Republicans give charities Lefties. God, far sides jump bridge together world would ten times better. get Christian holidays off. absolutely 100% agree no-win scenario, uncaring coldness reality, parent must shoulder ultimate responsibility child.

Ideally parents teachers everyone else get together vote caring, compassionate government realize helping families makes country stronger, are. told yesterday excess deaths include people COVID, can't know COVID deaths. We're guessing thats unscientific. 10,000 new cases per day week versus average 1,500 per day month ago....that's same.

the US CDC estimates IFR 0.65% would mean 6.5 every thousand cases would die, bear mind deaths immediate deflated basketball. can't speak Spain's case, Canada virus absolutely tore long-term care homes killed thousands vulnerable, slowed dramatically. 

Part decrease improved treatment, higher medical capacity, public awareness. also risk populations already dead. Haha, love ^help ^us ^most ^don’t teacher enough compassion forgiving, need find another profession become childhood trauma. don’t owe anything. Stop harassing this. someone bother writing article this? missing something? Man, predicted last June getting control *slowly* returning normal fellow Floridians decided meant carry like virus suddenly ceased exist. Whoops. submission removed because

([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* post obituaries connected them. First governments showed way. federal, provincial municipal levels closed public places owned made much employees work home. We've pretty good public communication strategy. Federal government provinces held press conference everyday Prime Minister, Health minister executive scientists would update population virus contagion, cases tracing, testing, equipment stocks importations etc. 

Our governments declared emergency state pretty quickly, closed non essential buisiness, prohibited gatherings, etc. federal created PCU, giving money people lost jobs, people employment insurance find new job, students could find job hours decreased, sick people without work leaves, etc. also created program help buisinesses strugling rent, salaries. permited debt population keep consuming, letting capitals flow economic structure. 

You need details ? know they've undergone significant safety testing already major side effects far. know ""immune"" means? can't ""almost immune"". I'm actually Canada, contact people US missing items post right now. Mostly people see boomers... maybe different places. spend lot time hospitals clinics possibly spend lot time universities. 

Now eldest generation see always masks. Kids teens though guess developed enough realize good them. yet they're perfectly OK person charged assaulting officer cop punches someone breaks finger. 

The mental gymnastics gullibility quite profound among conservative set. school funding based attendance maybe stop basing funding attendance.... husband jokes never sick kids. :) Sad trombone daughter's option skip finals based attendance. No, words exact. know “exact” means? heart right place, teacher perspective.

But keeping kids home sometimes option parents. parents can't miss day work.

It's bad situation around, teachers taking kid he's already sick. students fault shit wack.

A teacher pretty forgiving sick kid walks room. way they'll get better rest. someone lives league city basically, wife teacher another district... great. measures listed mitigate spread disease, suppress it.

And Tegnell Aftonbladet March: 
Anders Tegnell praises British idea **​​herd immunity**: ""**Where need go**""

 

  
\- Even sounds like lot, may one 60 percent get really sick maybe five six need care. smear five-six percent six-eight-ten-twelve months, manageable healthcare. 

So point Tegnell estimated 6 million Swedes infected, 60 000 really sick 3000 3600 needing care. 

 absolutely mentions vaccine article clear Tegenell believes herd immunity without vaccine.

You may also remember e-mail speculated keeping schools open would lead quicker herd immunity: 
**""One point would keep schools open reach herd immunity quickly**.""

&amp;#x200B;

I use March - June calculate excess deaths desease killed lot people. months think appropriate use? Can't include January-February virus started killing Swedes.

&amp;#x200B;

You also check Folkhälsomyndighetens weekly report week 23 theyself indicate missing deaths (ca 17%). Testing capacities limited dead even got tested.

&amp;#x200B;

But really matter 6500 5500 deaths Covid now. great disgrace Sweden Folkhälsomyndigheten ten times many dead people potential life long complications desease neighboring countries.  
Or still believe Giesecke (We're little bit ahead curve nighbors catch up)? Well tens thousands people 5 continents taken approved certainly first. Americans never cease amaze me... South, oversight pretty lacking specially move around fundamentalists Christian circles. Talking letting kids risk without support, years! that’s shocked disgusted lots republicans pundits talking “think children!” reopening schools case. really didn’t care do? Yeah....  Ah, ok. Thanks clarification. Yeah, CDC complete cluster point. One hand doesn’t even know another hand exists much less hand doing. 🤷‍♀️ [my brain reading Well, could have, let politics get way science. That's too-common issue days. Nailed agree.

Considering information we've able collect virus time hospitals build resources, policy makers pursuing targeted &amp; narrowed approach slowing spread.

That said, citizenry throw caution wind. one afraid go work recreation, common sense used, needlessly contribute increase rate spread. slower rate spread economic activity be.  Fire then, problem Aslong vaccine approved EU standards might OK it. positivity rate still long way go suggest drop real.

No, all. 2 months ago 4000 confirmed case per day positivity rate 20%, ~500 cases/day positivity rate 5%. clearly capturing MUCH bigger portion overall cases today 2 months ago. risk, may think simply take lesser risk. look everything table. Consider factors like economy job losses. Increased isolation leading loneliness depression. 

Considering factors may lead pushing quick deployment vaccine. increases liklihood complications vaccine. That's decision-makers must consider options risks. Oh fr? Damn guess it’s happening then. Everyone shoulders responsibility child dipshit. fucking child. Day One ""life paleo era society"" shit species. Oh man, screw Field Day. Missing Pancake Breakfast, that's terrible! discriminatory. California requirements Texas, necessarily need prior training. 

If certification, simply file yearly private school affidavit state (it's simple application). teaching requirement, must able teach required subjects, teachers must file. also keep certain records (attendance, vaccination, etc). can, however, avoid filing affidavit certified.

Source - Myself. lived homeschooled CA several years, lived homeschooled TX that. making sure parents job get harder... keeping job put food tables roof families head. 

We shitty system US. I'd argue lot parents situation probably worse teachers pay/work rules/ retirement benefits. Ultimately, people arguing strand RNA. losing. you, Jesus? 

ALL PEOPLE STILL GOING DIE!!! know know going die? country relatively mobile since March mass graves. March. alcohol consumption spiked shutdowns. Alcohol cars deadly combination encouraging. seems group provided evidence requiring seasonal vaccinations virus. serious concern vaccines currently production able treat new variants future. adaptations evolution virus seem neutral stabilizing evolving changing. still cannot rule encounter covid-19 strain future vaccines ineffective against, however, evidence suggests likelihood improbable thought. CDC taken made another mouthpiece Liar Chief, trustworthy source information/guidelines, that's true. Thanks.  what? Tbh rather easy Russia.

As non American, resistance Trump meagre. political system seems fine becoming third world country.

The checks balances turned toothless tigers. Yup movie theatres gyms bars reopening they’re still trying get kids back school 

Nothing really changed positive tests day went exactly cdc stopped getting results went White House real value supply rentable houses.

As guy moved lot life, rental units tremendous value life. Moving somewhere student, buy place would wasted lot money banking, lawyers, agents, etc. frictional cost buying selling house tens thousands, moved much education work opportunities, renting saved lot money.

Also, frees lot money would normally sink payment put good use starting businesses things. vaccine? thanks! I’ve wanting talk fellow guinea pig Ya. first thought “okay, kid spread it?” 

Kids going bring school. It’s going happened. okay need keep kid home. question whether spreads school. kids wearing masks? able distance? isolated stay home detection? It’s also risk groups 70+ go first. It’s need lower risk sooner, it’s also trading large risk infection tiny risk adverse vaccine effects good trade.

For healthy 40 year old equation different.

For healthy 10 year old point odds say vaccine taken may never, five years known vaccine.  Get fuck out. People dying. one two brain cells rub together shocked this. New York Times says. 90% tests false positive low amount virus threat anyone. 

The inventor PCR equipment said used test viruses. Instead used amplify RNA. 

The CDC said 6% covid deaths caused covid. died things like cancer. 

Heath Canada said proof covid isolated. came response information request proof isolated. 

Thousands doctors calling end lockdown, saying lockdown causing harm virus. 

Yet won’t end enough people stop going along it. Keep fear mongering spreading Reddit youre great. Deaths probably remain flatter young people less likely die catching it. 

However, still bad, means tons virus circulating elderly risk person hiding away home past 6 months STILL keep it. Colllege students may die covid transmit someone will. Uh, no. still plenty vulnerable people aren’t getting sick and/or dying know better now.

Don’t dense. I’m glad I’m one little confused line thinking. Quebec City little covid cases, first province mandate indoor mask wearing. 

We deal 20 cases fine. We’ve 2,000 total cases since March. thing Well something reaches cells way. vitro you’re essentially exposing something directly chemical. Sometimes medications reach cells fashion taken orally (or evening IV), dose takes vitro effects body systems too. example, amygdalin might kill cancer vitro would convert cyanide body compete hemoglobin well. 

TL;DR: Getting pill needs go without screwing systems doesn’t challenge moving lab body. (I'm skipping ahead coz best part)
Bowel shaking earthquakes doubt remorse... I’m saying agree approach, does:

Healthcare workers know infected healthcare workers still reporting work. shortage healthcare workers, hospitals medical industry stays open. 

If grocery store worker gets infected stays home, worker won’t missed much. Some, yes, store manage. store won’t close. 

You separate person job. isn’t protecting individual human lives. It’s making cogs wheel turn. cogs humans, case healthcare workers. 

Play game like Civilization Sim City. It’ll make sense. read them...? said lockdowns leading high risk starvation. Spanish source also explicitly states it.

Considering know IFR relation age implausible young country Peru people died coronavirus. Hunger far likely candidate food shortages problem country currently thanks lockdown. Speak yourself. I’d rather kid school risking coronavirus kid home, working home trying learn fucking computer. clearly don’t kids think kids home instead school. Psychologically, would potential destroy generation. argument there's always risk, specifically opt put others risk? That's selfish immoral.

Attending sporting event right something completely avoidable puts people risk. something completely avoidable puts people risk something selfish immoral person would do.

It's like this:

Driving without seatbelt? Fine, risk yourself. say smart decision, you. Driving drunk? Nope, something avoidable puts people's lives danger makes selfish immoral.

How self-evident? they'll fine. make claim abot Canada's measures? made claim agencies science based.

I mentioned 4 countries well: Canada, Germany, Schwitzerland, New Zeeland.

It world two kinds countries: Developed countries, agencies supposed sceientific fact scientific. guess everybody loose impression Schwitzerland like like El Salvador not.

So USA moves category ""not believed""-countries like Russia, White Russia, Turkey, Iran on, look agencies serious countries. plenty.

I'm American, USA fast becoming like Russia country says ""we new medicine works!"" assume lying take joke. obese

Yeah problem every single time go CNN dumbass headline '150 experts urge U.S. shut down, start over' know thinking: media always sensationalist. bigger problem governors dangling lockdowns head like little school children. virus sucks everyone's best interest stop spread, going away time soon risk keeping economy shut would catastrophic. pay almost $10,000 year childcare, aka school. even kids. Mom kid’s school posts photos daughter wearing mask. constantly around everyone. never distanced. doesn’t believe virus real. 

I chose virtual school her. know ton moms like selfish. 

I don’t blame parents work choice. mom doesn’t work. pawns kid doesn’t deal daughter. Thank much taking time source data me. update views accordingly save comment future references. AIDS

On particular subject...HIV rarely kills anyone first contract virus. However, years line (without medication), HIV transition AIDS, infected person inevitably die.

We know long-term effects COVID-19. home school them. adult Yeah heard. FIL wants go rally see crazy. said wanted get Biden shirt wear it. I'm currently begging goes, keep mask dont talk anybody there. University Alabama hit 1500 2 weeks since students starting going back agree. rich people, celebrities politicians gonna first up

USA fool bby everyone stop renting likely false negative real one tests. noice, wanting one while, going good deals weeks. antibody immunity always lasts weeks months. immune cells remember make antibodies, make virus shows again. cells last years. Hong Kong confirmed case reinfection also man caught early strain Asia, travelled Europe recently caught strain. Even then, asymptomatic. fuck sends kid school right now? like I'm living nightmare. weird hour Chinese guy work? whole idea people prison jail getting vaccine people outside phase 1 2 tough bear many people really needed flexibility district offering. work part-time mornings. I'm usually one casual office, bring kids mom watch them. school afternoons.

Young kids (mine 5 7) need 8 hours busywork. finish &lt;2 days, plenty time reading. appropriate response politician coming condemning past policy behavior. Otherwise indicates still perfectly fine legislation consequences. SIDES EQUALLY!

BS, know it. 

Stop it, part problem. Thank this, I'm 1/3 hopes take it. I'm ""anti-vax"" B.S. brain capable critical thinking want put brand new 'type' vaccine body top rushed 0.025 amount time tried true vaccine.

As far new 'type' vaccine, prototype mRNA vaccine. First kind, ""trick"" body producing viral proteins itself. work using mRNA, messenger RNA, molecule essentially puts DNA instructions action. Inside cell, mRNA used template build protein. ‘An mRNA basically like pre-form protein (sequence encodes) protein basically made later on. immune system detects viral proteins starts produce defensive response them.

Just look vaccine *gave* thousands kids measles 60's. tainted polio vaccine sickened fatally paralyzed children 1955. 2 incidents, *not* rushed trials.  doubt it. get $89,423.26 number? local hospital can't tell specific ultrasound cost till it. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

No, I'm particularly worried. thanks, I'll continue listen scientists doctors instead 2 month old account reddit. I'm sure 30-40 minutes research makes much qualified people field entire career. really, MERS never major impact, SARS relatively contained. Neither pandemic scale COVID is. Hence blank cheque vaccine research.

Also worth remembering research viruses basis Covid vaccine candidates. Hence close vaccine within year virus discovered. may case Corona, there’s enough data yet. previous coronavirus reinfections worse outcomes second time around. novel coronavirus though hopefully isn’t like others it’s definitely something aware of. fall behind schools bounce back forth virtual physical back

I see people saying lot. considered big deal?

Kids desire predictability regularity. get that. 

But since in-person education much better, seems like 8 weeks in-person education 3 weeks remote better 11 weeks remote.

What's evidence transitioning one leads bad outcomes? Recent example: Dengvaxia, Philippines luckily demographic who's best position pay hospital bill lengthy stay.

&amp;#x200B;

you die.

so keep payments. Oof :( small natural variance excess deaths year year. 

Even year's excess deaths covid directly, almost certainly still caused covid one way another. 94% survival rate. misrepresentation. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ really. responding fact flu supposedly 0.01% death rate. point people still die flu. severe conditions old higher rate dying flu either case healthy person. hypothetically possible younger healthy person could pass disease someone else ends complications. 

That doesn’t mean shouldn’t stay home sick try spread pathogens others. prior moralizing way covid been. People need stop letting fear porn headlines social media run brain. Sure. think people advocate vaccine take first. Put good health mouth is. Omg edgy! sadly even DNC vested interest preventing socialist policies implemented. group claims businesses using pandemic revert using huge amounts single-use plastic.

Obviously? can't re-use stuff pandemic. think even allowed to. 

In VA, government mandated refill existing glass growlers breweries, instead, give plastic bag filled beer. 

Now, take consideration like every single meal long time takeout (with disposable materials) instead eaten inside restaurant re-useable cups, plates, etc. nice, live may ask?

Also, scared unknown side effect? Ford Mustang festival going 1000s Ford Mustang fans owners Sturgis week trust Switzerland. one ""kids can't get transmit virus"" countries. initial comment stated everyone wanted, many still do, vaccine year.

'Cause answer to,

AMERICA, F-YEAH!

pewpewpew leadership desperately wants approve vaccine, too.

FDA compromised. should, realistically, able hunker month two done it. didn’t happen. Count ""doubts"" camp. anyone else president, Democrat Republican, case. guy's openly compromising federal agencies stooges place political concerns agencies' missions. worship money forced work homeless starving don't? d3s closer friday night lights likely not,its likely isnt getting reported either, I'm Boomer. I'm young enough absorb potential volatility.

Perhaps Boomer...and are, risk tolerance far greater mine.  sorry, mean say trial rushed. meant there's probably bit leeway approval (again, conjecture, know vaccines) challenge trials really done released.

they mentioned wanted challenge trials, bit unethical right due lack treatment options.

as aside, comment, continue previous one: also another fear thread mentioned manufacturing process risks. time article (1976), made huge scientific technological leaps. lot sentiments regarding fear vaccine seem stem distrust companies governments. there's need keep accountability towards entities, fear comes this. ""the world test lab"" thing really hardcore conspiracy theories that, although happened past extreme examples, would imply huge cost, lifes, money involved. they've got much gain us, vaccine works. Ok Karen Lol, though

No need lie son Sure. might die good meal lose bucks do!

Is trying see many deaths happen watch? think like, people generally block facts confront biases make uncomfortable. nice I’m sorry. sounds like basically surrounded jerks. I’d mad too. don’t get hell someone would make fun people masks. pandemic really exposing people’s selfish nature. How? sides politicizing disease equal force. keep saying stop stop it, stop what? telling truth? example parties saying earth flat. one saying flatter other. sounds horrifying.

No thanks. reaction was, ""huh."" Public sick leave universal health care probably two biggest factors.  First source nothing Florida state commented about. Secondly nowhere say anything backs either original claims. never said anything reducing testing original comment, talked state kicking back results data blocked, something entirely sinister. quit testing asymptomatic blocking data labs closing labs. Florida complete shit show Ron DeathSentence blame. thing economic duress. However good opt-in far first infringement cell phone privacy. fought, especially advertising. quarantine classroom. kids school keeps classes interacting, happens quarantine one class keep spreading. 

we really cant keep kids home 2 years hell ignoring 175k died already.

But saying shouldn’t dying Covid.

And isn’t hypothetical. Look New York, compare Sweden actually less deaths baseline average Covid outbreak slowed.

Would rather come Covid outbreak excess deaths causes besides Covid? fewer deaths average. presenting false dichotomy saving lives Covid saving lives shutdowns. already probably 30 million infections u count mild asymptomatic cases chinmask.

nosemask

languages funny. Yes death rate zero age group really excuse send school, miss another year education end even behind. 

It's fine, wealthy children private tutors need go school. poor children left behind that's be. fuck poor protect vulnerable even though vulnerable group 80s jobs could stay inside. JEE
All best ! getting 40,000 cases per day track reach 7 million 25 days. I'm going back another degree next week. I'm scared. trust fellow Canadians keep right things keep us safe. We're wearing masks schools going online much possible.

And importantly federal gov't app works Bluetooth let know around infected person.

When case school gets reported happened Quebec, send whole class home instead infected person people direct contact with. erring side caution.

The government allocated extra 2 B dollars help schools stay safe.

So done everything within reason. breakouts eliminated Covid bring us knees. dealt it. learning hard way vast number peole country can't math science. detriment around punish students? kids fault here, makes sense treat like shit showing feeling well enough keep up. Must've many positive Governor DeathSentence. read study linked to. So, guess paste it.

No. acute wake exhalation event within feet infected person contact know also public bathrooms fecal plumes outside slums, too, right?

Unsurprisingly, familiar bathrooms Mumbai slum toilets. filthy, active ventilation. look like ones left side: I'm out. agree you. Sorry wasn’t clear; test course schools reopen I’m pretty confident they’ll monitoring things pretty closely respond appropriately. Yeah too. 

I rave feb, club week (no I'm party person whatsoever two close friend's birthdays sure like party). Nobody really knew Covid back then, table... remember even thinking really really this.

I kidney failure dialysis, week HOLY SHIT feel well. breathe, nearly falling consciousness... knew something right. know body. 

I called unit extra dialysis run got prob. Usually trouble breathing means much fluid built up, but, barely all. 

I asked go emerg dr laughed said, ""you covid, fine, go home."" really tried get test refused. Meanwhile week later friends got sick knew something right... Finding need point positive? Jesus Christ. Keep wallowing. saying right, lot parents assumption school allows kids go school results back, either feel risk think sue school someone gives COVID kids.   yanks mad. take away. I've read shown spread well elementary schools guidance followed. expected kids bring in. ""send kid school"" ""lose shitty minwage job end street"", choice clear. Bit stretch make connection, eh? Good. Schools opened since day one quarantines positive tests reported. even make day 2 exposure situation occurred. teacher tested found positive. 

Thousands quarantined point. 

School safe right now. realize longer takes fizzle mutate less virulent strain, larger likelyhood mutate way? There's cases reinfection documented since March, early tell, seems mutating fast enough around. 

So, repeat, mutate milder form (whether less infective less virulent) within two years, around runs human fuel. One side corrupting scientific process, side not. sides same.

Plenty places spikes (NY, PA, OH, MI, MA) none testing numbers plummeted amount peak.  Got it. worded 94% threshold real cutoff number people incomplete death certificates. one largest campuses US.... surprising good news given could be. Organized? Ecuador done terrible job probably deaths tracked.

Even DARE worked extent. offered coke times count always scared sudden cardiac arrest like Chris Farley. Smoking longer considered cool majority teens. It’s sick nasty. He'll crowd 7 white people KOREANS TRUMP signs. Except decided zafir wrestler robot..Just added wig end heard last night someone brought up. said 6% deaths strictly Covid. Basically saying healthy people accountable 6% deaths. Everything i'm reading today seems back up, missing something?

The false narrative people saying 94% die covid, correct? people told report say seems apparently people saying that?

I'm trying figure uproar. Nailed it? common trope used yet offers zero rebuttal system change alternative would look like. “Excused” ends gray area don’t necessarily count towards limit administrator deem excessive. data based articles, second peer reviewed one. using CDC data. folded administration mid-July local subreddit post kid asking do. several Covid symptoms parents wanted go school. What's opinion matter ?  cause cut groups lockdown, mean locked down. 

You keep trying, really almost place US lockeddown. NZ, China, Singapore, HK, countries got shit control. US not. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* exactly changed I'm scared testing rushed. public perception vaccination ruined.  test kids school wait test results? TIL okay taking frustrations innocent. think okay teachers treat children like shit failings parents?

Class act. People like reason country dumpster fire.

Also, try respond actual substance said. parents treating children like shit, teachers treating like shit. Maybe one day smooth brain catch up. people die. let asymptomatic people circulate population, people die. die horribly, time, alone, terrified, unable breathe. want? want responsible person dying? Maybe someone like, maybe coach teacher coworker. family devastated, business may close, economy get worse.

There path situation makes easy convenient painless open go back normal spread disease nonchalantly. going happen, matter twist spin try adapt situation personal desires. even possible worse US? \- Children higher viral load upper respiratory tract \- SK, shows children drive spread \- children likely get/spread infection \- children still spread act like die \- first case, saw knew schools likely reopen. Planning begun back then, really shut fully back then, May

There mixed evidence topic. findings show children less severe disease lower rates infection, all. see reopen schools also spikes cases/rates, especially countries like USA social distancing/other guidelines adhered properly.  fact, undetected undiagnosed cases may spreading virus most, could children presenting symptoms: important note: studies prior past period children dealing children constantly classrooms, contact adults family. may spread virus less among children present symptoms get tested, clear spread less adults adults adults. fact, studies directly children looking show otherwise. Again, look results - schools opening causing spikes around world. changing environment following guidelines place before, sending kids learn closed room adults, can't really apply lot past data involved kids mostly dealing family kids. transmission rates children households mixed bag, many studies showing much adults.

Maybe outside packing together rooms inherently unsafe, spread less, maybe - undeniably breaking social guidelines send back school going infect people. like kids get spread virus.

Countless schools USA already reopened closed, stayed open virus spread rampant school staff. dig probably 10 articles already this, really easy find. Like Georgia, example, course going way back May Israel first figured out.

If belief could follow guidelines properly adults, nevermind get kids follow them, I'd supportive reopening schools. seems like society can't handle one year sacrifice change get existential crisis. We're screwed comes bigger issues like climate change. important, recognize admit need study more: happened prior campaign reopen schooling... see case kids spread - real world evidence across globe

Its also important note many findings prior month ago based adults, extrapolated children based clinical findings. finding children may studied differently, even tested differently differing immune responses virus. Again, science demonstrating higher viral loads respiratory system children, tend tolerate infection better. studies** read through, many published prior pandemic first politicized pandemic I've seen. cover respond pandemics closing \- close schools pandemic. lower contact rates. \- less contacts children = less spread see, pretty insane go paradigms past pandemics findings related them. political. Curious cultural background? Caribbean fever, going school. Fevers three digits only. Aw caved anyway, cute. Long term? Stop voting evil conservative capitalists.

Short term? right answer, ultimately parent's job deal it, someone else's. Like what? Christmas yea, people celebrate something winter break non-religious people celebrate Christmas too. fugck Texas 6 months prepare, fucking idiot. NY couple weeks. new york one I'm aware of. recorded state record number tests conducted. 


 mean, take either ""approved"" FDA... I'll wait till there's one available countries, thanks 😬 seen rapid rise confirmed cases coronavirus. New infections surged nearly 50 percent August, making highest monthly tally since beginning pandemic, Reuters reported. said first thing. Kids desire predictability, especially problematic kids.

Bouncing around person remote whole process teaching learning literally night day different REALLY fucking hard kids need help, ends bringing entire class them. end kids get done hour get upset nothing do, kids 6 hours isnt even enough. happened daughter direct reason pulled her. finished planned lessons 1-2 hours nothing school would get supplemental work help friends etc.

Couple kids dont access web, kids dont parents help, kids dont access computers normal times etc fucking mess.

And going 8 weeks person remote, shits going fall apart less 4 teachers get sick fuck. cannot believe Americans waiting 12 DAYS fucking results.

It's almost like want spread. I'm aware kids one rewarding things life, I've never happy loser girlfriend around get pregnant. Literally close friends young kids big struggle them. let vent me, seems help little. propose alternative then? seem really good tearing choices moment offer nothing replacement. houses sold, never rented? people want buy want rent?  Oh yeah I’m really pleased took class early, otherwise would taken expensive college courses confirm career path wanted. LONG time ago- it’s almost 20 years since graduated high school!- yes, end finding fulfilling career path. wealthy children issue, yes trust fund babies problem tutors catch up.

But average poor child, even get good education begin with. already behind happened. parents read them, nobody teaching quarantine. take years away catch up, get left. never go university now, set back completely nobody cares them.

It sucks one child country may die, child sickly would die flu anyway irrelevant. can't fuck entire generation protect one person. that's kind numbers dealing pandemic, one two children dying. death rate non-existent them. bus lightning strike likely kill them. Sounds like greed. majority society NEEDS money. small minority wants everyone else doesn’t have, happens small minority control everything do. worked Lowe's Hardware, employees mother three quadriplegic husband. Well, course 4 cycle sickness required essentially burn 5 days sick within 2 months. got to, work sick limited days.

Well, 6 months later illness bout forgotten, called due flu, hospital 3 days.

She comes back put final warning ""constant absences"" truant calling work laughs. Companies care.

When look history, 10 years company, rarely called out. husband horrible accident care kids happened. Plenty working class people US simply can't make choice keep kids home school them, keep food table. government step help ?that's another rabbit hole go down...could US afford that? absolutely....would it, no.

so are. lot districts seem best, think shut schools next year . posted archive link read it.  agree. think stories see Florida schools shutting outbreaks due school opening uncontrolled area. Okay Dr Phil, much appreciated 😂 wish country recycling bins. Wish place like Slovenia required law dispose trash cultured manner. Wish could prevent shit happening :(. &amp;#x200B;

I assuming trolling simply past parts comment favourite search engine find long lint mainstream news articles claims. 

The one may hard find claim Health Canada. here’s link information request response.

[pdf nuanced advice. face coverings replacement social distancing however face coverings reduce risk etc.. Also wrapped early “advice” need prevent run n95 masks (was probably late anyway). combined zero leadership created ton confusion mistrust. Yes, we’re seeing now. 

Masks don’t work. (Healthcare gets good masks).

Masks work you. (Healthcare gets all
the good masks, ability make cheap masks widely available public, let’s that).

Now we’re starting hear masks protect others you. saw three large boxes full N95 NIOSH approved masks Lowe’s last week. Well... I’m sure everyone happy cloth masks, they’ll never sell them. Right? .... right? 😂

I hope you’ve stored enough mental energy parsing vaccine lies. need figure vaccines safe effective, figure get it. hope goes well, considering much bullshit we’ve waded masks... mean, solid vaccine life changing. also risk populations already dead.

What suspected, then. horrible, horrible person. 

I hope someday realize try better. I'm curious people think world actually works. soon someone says, ""it's God-given right,"" - game over. honestly think single person making news indicates herd immunity impossible scenario? 25 million people sick, ONE 25 million getting reinfected means reinfection likely? funny thing even then, death cert would list gunshot blood loss. Even simple gunshot death going end 1 cause listed. look protests? half, more, screaming yelling, bumping wearing masks.

Bullshit. 'em, sure, ""over half""? Nope. That's simplest way describe business model. Albertan here.

They spent months telling us would safe open schools school boards would make safe, enforce rules.

School boards budgets cut previous year. given impossible task, told less funding.

.. govt continues pushing safe, school boards ensure this.

Then day students return, re-write rules.

I think schools closed.. way beyond disgusting.

The people Alberta broken. government broken.

Any ideas Albertan make better? Texas best. entire state shit hole minus Houston Austin. said 6% deaths strictly Covid. Basically saying healthy people accountable 6% deaths. Everything i'm reading today seems back up, missing something?

Yes, missing fact COVID causes secondary conditions. die COVID-19, often die pneumonia ARDS even otherwise health individual. would considered co-morbidities listed death certificate. Even perfectly healthy person listed death certificate. 6% death certificates listing COVID-19 cause death high lazy registering death certificate. 

It's spun seem like 6% fatalities otherwise health individuals. data shows, though.  admit know dw.com. ""fake news"" obviously I'd delete it. Doug Ford? Current premier Ontario much alive causing problems?

Think meant Rob. kid symptoms? think 250,000 extra (more normal) suicides last 6 months?

are fucking crazy? accept reality conservatives completely believe propaganda conspiracy theory fed them. bottom depravity compulsion shield ego. were/will yelling, were/will standing right next tight quarters hours go home families. Nobleness cause impact transmission rate I'm trying say.

Edit: School also says tailgating ISU sell beer football games... exactly, think bank know they’re doing. Windfall profits desperate landlords choice sell. It’s hard ppl understand important housing CA, due pace growth - prices central OC kept going despite recession 08. Ppl work hard get shit banks guess congrats weeding early? hope found something fulfilling do. somehow antibodies despite knowledge ever this. Karens: None, I'm fine dying preventable diseases. need brethren Tucson [sewage Indeed stat little time ago. It’s probably much higher mild/asymptomatic side. Excess death great indicator COVID deaths, TONS confounding factors there, many simply can't known. People driving less, fewer deaths that. People nervous going hospital, deaths untreated conditions. Pollution down, fewer deaths that. Depression up, deaths that. Stress up, contributing factor lot deaths. 

The 6% figure absolutely ludicrous, death toll almost certainly higher current ~180,000 figure. excess deaths studies, environment like this, need seriously stringent modeling, come pages caveats. know two dozen young people die, per-existing conditions everyone school potentially exposure. happen every school US parents keep kids home they're sick. That’s one wants talk about.

They talk it, gets downvoted Ok asshole look numbers now. dickheads care elderly?! care rampant elder abuse talked news? fits agenda care. Also, future generations important already lived full life, can’t wrap head around really Neanderthal. people wanna leave Cali, it’s partially due price living, mostly people getting tired fire season here. last one started dry lightening made people tired dealing top pandemic. ✌️ National Champs SUNY Oneonta well known party school require quarantine testing students returned. know expected happen. Good, look Peru lockdown since March, it’s worth should’ve stayed oki think adding ""almost"" reason children cross fingers behind back they're fibbing that's mean. Outdoor spread likely spread watching Netflix home. people spend time office regardless. Lower temps mean going *as opposed staying home* spread. CNN clickbaits implying link text article might info long term effects: raise question though: data yet suggest virus long term effects? Something mouse. Must exterminator convention.  sun-sneezer (person sneezes looking sun sometimes sources light), feel uncomfortable sneeze mask, although change sneeze slime. extremely rare sneeze snot, really care masks. Also able stop sneeze comes out, although ruins fun sneezing me, drawback. sure showed internet today! Good thing kids contagious contact people might adversely affected virus. guess it’s worth risk then, eh? couldn’t stand living somewhere rural like that, though. I’d amazed county live population 100,000 still pulled feat. 

Nevertheless, guess I’m talking general negative sentiment us population seems regarding science, collectivism “authorities.” — France pushed forward reopening schools Tuesday, sending 12 million students back mandatory in-person classes, even country reported sharp rise new novel coronavirus officials warned possible need second national lockdown, schools highly affected regions remain closed. government wants students classrooms, facilitate return parents work curb learning gap high- low-income students authorities believe worsened two-month lockdown seen rapid rise confirmed cases coronavirus. New infections surged nearly 50 percent August, making highest monthly tally since beginning pandemic, Reuters reported. ""Based data, appears humoral... 

That's entirely speculation part, make bones it. hand, studies showing antibodies fade based actual measurement. No. acute wake exhalation event within feet infected person contact transmission. 

Citation please, making definition ""contact transmission"". Unsurprisingly, familiar... 

In worst case fecal-oral / fecal-inhaled almost certainly small proportion total SARS-CoV-2 infections. still doubt conclusions study posit herd immunity occurs 20-30%, experts said 60-70% range even maybe case SARS-CoV-2. 

Edit: grammar Timing right dumb idiots went Sturgis. data wrongly interpreted. transmissions occuring indoor, true, mean people leave house go outdoor. Transmissions occur connection points, people picking virus restaurants, bringing home, family members going church, social activities, restaurants, etc.

The last sentence make sense me. waiters passing viruses last thing want have. Convections carry bastard viruses. People need study fluid mechanics, diffusion, convection better.

I agree points. HVAC dry droplets however. convection air human traffic people washing hands, wearing masks major cause indoor transmission. Learn Asian folks man. mountain evidence learn from. Look cases. ashamed creating theory theory, reinventing wheel, even proper one.

We surprised campus cases. even sanitize bathroom, classroom, elevators frequently. professors refuse use plastic barrier, students refusing wear masks etc. Cafeteria dining places open, students sneezing, burping, etc. end better situation.. personally want policy makers first batch guinea pigs. Show us policy works follow. use us students staffs shitty thing.

Oh also ruin CDC, critize CDC shitty. moronic. Schools forced reopen, bad cases, WH right wing media criticize ""those liberal-minded schools students"", ""they know full party-loving hedonistic Democrats"". F U.

How come back say thing that? shame all?  Turkeys open. Super cheap remember people treating like I’m idiot said didn’t understand mask protects people me. asked explain two-sided barrier doesn’t help all. seems physically impossible. they’d tell whatever CDC message moment was. 🤷‍♀️

Whatever. I’ve wanted protect people since day one. Protecting others important, also look yourself. Especially now. 

I also can’t think American way protect ourselves. public messaging awful. Fuck antivax bullshit. 450 people couple hundred million, 1 100k chance virus killed millions last time around. government can't do. long relevant laws allow private companies this, 4th amendment issue.

Edit: 4600 people dead COVID-19 end May. three months since 1200 deaths. June - 865, July - 256, August far (not entirely completed records yet) - 54.

So decline really steep now. case vaccine Swine Flu, disorder ""Guillain-Barre Syndrome"", affected one 100,000 people took it. upcoming Coronavirus vaccine similar response ailment, would result 3,300 cases. 

Keep mind could talking people otherwise healthy risk serious complications coronavirus. There's going negative reaction. question is, cure worse disease. never one hundred percent safe. need decide level risk we’re willing live with. 

If spouse didn’t quit job, you’re obviously willing take great deal risk, benefits family so. I'm old enough remember George HW Bush president.

Except doesn't. evidence kids 9 spread much less adults.

It good idea close schools March, know assumed would like flu, i.e., kids super-spreaders.

Since then, lots evidence lots countries opened schools, scientists epidemiologists tracking students turn positive.

There still risk, like everything. without lot details can't say school opened not.

Maybe develop Tylenol breathalyzer every kid enter? maybe give parents days jail? patients sick, asymptomatic carriers permanent damage believe differently bigger problems covid. think article bears headline. Even using numbers pretty bad making vaccines, sure seems like death toll possibly 'rushed' vaccine way way less death toll caused government launched program seven months 40 million people got vaccinated swine flu, according CDC. vaccination campaign later linked cases neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, develop infection or, rarely, vaccination live vaccine.  due vaccine, fact done hastily, hundred cases although definitive linked,"" Kinch said.  [CDC increased risk 1 additional case Gullain-Barre every 100,000 people got swine flu vaccine. Due small association, government stopped program investigate.

So 1 case every 100,000 people death rate 0.0001%. Coronavirus death rate, averaged, around 1%. give 100,000 people vaccine, 1,000 die coronavirus, instead 1 dying rushed vaccine. numbers pretty clear here.

I think vaccine rushed much possible still 'relatively' safe. Every month one 10's thousands people die.

Some people bad reactions vaccines matter long wait safe are. What's national record among colleges far? listen CDC anymore?

Only suits agenda. Group thing, fun thing. 1. Power

2. Money

3. ~~People~~ power money

FIFY mine taking rushed vaccine neither America. need go ahead try release 2021 one take waste money. try make mandatory recoup money, expect crazy riots everyone. anyone know studies article referencing? article. Young people social. afflicted 'the hormones'.  Coming town near soon. live eastern NC wouldn’t believe ppl believing 9,000 ppl died Coronavirus....they won’t believe anything else even try?? groceries delivered go anywhere....I live ignorant area believes masks killing protection expose (I underlying condition surgery). need realistically explain position. think think vaccine good idea? pushed sooner later? somehow think people agree, including President?

I mean really... listening words typing? ask something else? that's said. *sickening thing America

While countries perfect, way everything America commodified worst. Many countries free water (Ireland) housing homeless (Sweden) Free childcare, healthcare, education (Too many list)

While money world-wide problem, far worse America Yeah arguing someone day. confront excess mortality data, least acknowledged people dying something. essentially saying ""well (people comorbidities) going die anyway, die coronavirus,"" trying push antimask narrative saying deaths overcounted 1700%. 

Also odd people already know COVID hitting people comorbidities harder. That's like... corona 101. Sheesh that. allowed let facts get way sensationalist headline! say relevant, less relevant unless specifically trying compare individual states, there's currently huge potential margin error chaotic things states. statistics I've seen compare entire US countries. higher percentage elderly live 5 minutes away League City. 

Nothing shocks me. Here's hot take: country NEVER EVER cared health citizens incentivized one thing, economy.

That said, think think government overreach seen last six months name 'health safety' horse shit, plain simple. information purposely contradictory fragmented impossible parse that's point. Keep people confused importantly, keep people scared. need wake fuck up, easier keep sleeping. No, emails obvious discussing effects herd immunity plan it.

I noticed herd immunity plan when:

* ordered students 15 years old study remotely
* told people work home
* told people avoid congestion use public transport
* told people stay home sight slightest symptoms (even ones associated COVID-19)
* told people keep kids ages home sight slightest symptoms
* forbid public gatherings 50 people (something even international pandemic experts comment likely reason continual decline infection rates even without lockdown even Europe seeing increase).
* forbid restaurants bars serve people seated.
* (not sure even worth mentioning ban visiting elderly homes here)

2020 flu season starting COVID pandemic started, mild, started all. no, taking outlier ENTIRE RECORD good comparison sense word, unless looking another outlier.

Why insist comparing March-June, find weird. period actual excess mortality period normal baseline? even care compare years 2k less deaths baseline? Please, use common sense compare year pandemic outlier year extremely low mortality see ""pops out"".

I see data SCB least **use** it. I'd tell him, crazy shut downs social distancing mask enforcement procedures followed, pandemic improved?! Lol thank you, say — dude like solid 4 months behind literature. Someone hasn’t attending journal clubs!

(It’s me. haven’t paying attention journal clubs. It’s hard care cryo EM right now.) No, parents aren’t ones struggles, one many reasons everyone able sit back relax. comment well earned one response flippant unsympathetic suggestion. “I quote verbatim makes happy.”

Good. understand quotes work.

“There reason walking around mask.” 

See previous response concern shortage healthcare workers.

“Cloth surgical masks never danger short supply. encouraged wear.”

As matter fact, encouraged wear surgical masks intended healthcare workers. paper masks available stores surgical masks never short supply effectiveness debatable. shortage masks, better nothing. know, knowledge changed regarding ‘novel’ virus, information recommendations. simple concept, actually.

“So hospitals overstocked masks?”

They not. I’m healthcare worker working surgical setting. Masks available, wouldn’t say they’re overstocked. N95s still short supply. still wear one day. eye protection still hit miss.

“You really want say Fauci harm statement then?”

Of course harm. There’s people like walking around unable put 2 2 together. literally starts blanket statement masks important. goes explain recommended actions, keeping mind shortcomings knowledge virus supply PPE.

Fauci world renowned epidemiologist. I’m advanced practice nurse. Even know important masks preventing spread respiratory illnesses. basic science. Fauci never suggested one wear masks don’t help. simply false. N95s stop 95% airborne particles, including viruses, recommended CDC. (See link above) Why? they’re short supply healthcare workers need them. Simple! [You know Nowhere close. like ""With current restrictions level social adherence measures... covid finding less people kill"". every state different Florida fucked up.

My understanding dynamics masks dramatically decrease risk others, (by speculation) might protect wearer severe case.

Which makes news article, well, *news*. Lmao. Drunk college kids wearing masks. sweet, summer child. mean, last sentence entirely honest either. works ways. person would died got COVID heart disease, heart disease kill them? counted COVID deaths heart disease deaths? I’d certainly like see article. would interesting. need federal government all. Tests given then. tried. Canada continue robust immigration safe countries. 

Losing American tourism dollars hurts cost public healthcare would devastating Fauci rescue think Harbaugh gives shit losing OSU collect $6 million? Useful idiots coronavirus. I’m sending mine school, they’re taking precautions I’m comfortable infection rate state low.

Is active five year old supposed forgo education play next year two, gets figured out? fall globalists ABC news! 96% false positive. 99.99999% survive! 0.0002% death rate. 99% deaths 85! 3% 85 years old. one else looking you....look yourself. Exactly this. think people probably seen many death certificates, understand they're filled out. Ship fools Smart move - coronavirus SARS was, though, result masks commonplace Asia nearly two decades. I'm giving opinion experts, literal expert myself, listen, speak me. That's condecending. pointing expertise, past clinician scientist publishes epidemiological studies develops mathematical/statistical techniques used field, condescending. direct point, I'm frankly sick people expertise arguing me, accepting truth explained choose believe nonsense there. pretend know landscape medicine/science part it, know consensus.  
 do. I'm part it. back nice anymore. Lives stake.

Again, take simple look past posts. posting articles posted nytimes latimes science, btw. I'll link since able find comment search yourself: I’m saying lift lockdowns live live normally herd immunity reached fast. It’s really good way cases would skyrocket isn’t wrong. question (as uninsured currently unemployed American who’s broke don’t even know they’re going eat near future) is, would get notification?

I already wear mask every single moment I’m around people (which little possible), already keep 6-9 feet (2-3 metres) distance others even means walking middle road.

I definitely couldn’t afford treatment, probably couldn’t even afford test (assuming could even get test). always behave I’m infected, even though I’ve never exhibited symptoms. millions Americans comparable situations mine. Probably people countries too.

So, theory I’m interested seriously need ask: would others situation do, we’re already doing, got notification? could 50% weeks current growth trend holds. Wrong! maybe 5 million, worst case world wide. Let's see happens next year. says nothing odds dying 6 months year age preexisting conditions. useful all. Yes, like didn’t fill actually killed (pneumonia, organ failure, stroke, sepsis horrible ways Covid uses kill human). Covid underlying cause, actually brought death day one effects. Yeah, seriously. Every high risk individual Italy died healthcare's asinine handling situation, there's nobody left kill. 

Italy role model lol One infuriating constant conservatives inability assess simple human motivation properly. 

The scientists who've devoted professional lives immunology climatology lying; rich businesspeople who've dedicated lives acquiring wealth stand benefit discrediting scientists honest ones.

The wealthy Democratic politicians advocate helping less fortunate lying; wealthy Republican politicians whose policies favor well-off people like somehow trustworthy. Stupid people thats how. November going magically make half country start taking seriously, though. They'll continue shitheels. Lots students still live home parents probably many grandparents. Here's related piece published day Trump's attempts distort death data: feels weird I've taught America greatest place world places like mexico terrible, crime filled places. reality world places good, even better America. America also terrible crime filled place lot areas dare anybody question science, right 2 links ""page removed"" copying old bullshit. 

Quoting article

""None available data far sufficient enough conclude whether children may drive COVID-19 transmission, according Tribble.
“Even holds true children carry much virus adults, automatically mean contagious likely spread disease,” Tribble says

I happily check back another month. I've last 2 months people make stupid predictions Yes I’m towards middle I’d say. support lot left social policies economic policies I’m right. ideas common! seem accurate given Fauci said. making seem always error COVID-19 alone cause death. According article, Fauci never suggests error small percentage cases COVID-19 lone cause death. fact COVID-19 sometimes lone cause death make less cause underlying cause comorbidities causes condition causes death. seem help matters say, without evidence, 6% death certificates filled incorrectly cases COVID-19 actual cause death. 

Further, one need positive test COVID-19 listed cause death certificate. deaths listed probable. They're delusional. They're lying know it. land borders closed Mexico. still fly Mexico anything including vacation I'll next month. Anti-science never works. work US, work Brazil, sure hell work India. “We” do. Individuals can. mean like half America can't math? thought way more, like 50 %!! beginning, lockdown properly implemented, lasted two weeks iirc. Almost movement streets.

Then started slowly lifting it, people went back streets. on, cases began climbing steadily, government kept saying fine. don’t think understand exponential growth all.

Also, biggest downfall incredibly poor testing effort. live building confirmed case. Nobody ever contacted family. say testing going great, infection rate 40% days otherwise. 

This type lockdown can’t work country much informal workers. type school system let's kids fall behind they're present gives little help catch get back school. first days essential getting used class making friends/acquaintances classmates, missing make outcast since able make friends. trivial things people, downside slim none chance, mind, get covid/give classmates, worth risk. 180k dead sure are. actually though? definitely norm majority country that’s we’re still spiking test entire white house 74 flu always?

Did test Obama? Bush? Clinton? Sure, know lot more.

&amp;#x200B;

We're basically stage low enough infection rate, prevent another outbreak using tracking prevention methods like mandatory masks drive-through wherever possible. South Korea that, alongside testing, keep infection keep low long time. 180 400 800. got roundly downvoted saying that, current trend additional containment measures, half student body would coronavirus within weeks. That's unexcused 10 days parents communicate teachers.  

School call, email text kid show school. 

After 5 excused absents, school want doctor notes. least that's kids school. CDC came recommendation covid within last 3 months recovered exposed need get test quarantine. Pretty common sense point, right. headline news (both left right) produce recommendation ""CDC SAYS IMMUNITY LASTS 3 MONTHS"". going fight tremendously hard fear mongering journalism here.  No, said costly follow proper pandemic preventions reductions per Federal Reserve printing money extinction. sorry 2% extinction.

Greece’s cases pretty much exactly UK’s moment cases actually marginally last week.

There number countries higher cases Greece UK Scotland quarantine list, including Portugal, Ireland, Italy Liechtenstein. It’s difficult anybody knows data see anything playing populism. Nothing wrong freedom ride leading 100,000 Covid infections... tail worth it. matter? made outragous statement basically saying none sick elderly people would died anyways wanna see came conclusion. Everything’s open since beginning August. Bars restaurants. People going other’s houses throwing parties. kinda saying basic proper things. sad even say them. Like wash hands warm water soap! Basic!

Germany podunk country, excess ICU capacity phenomenal testing regime decent contact tracing presumably. need lockdown even last resort unless miss 10 million cases somehow despite high levels testing.

Actually, lots places use lose policies. I've seen XX hours year, nothing rolls over. company accrues bi-weekly, caps 4 weeks, 4 weeks saved up, stop accruing. US law requires employers pay cases, terminate employment, think may ways around paying even (which folks blow lots vacation time right actual ""quit"" date). 

We argue okay not, happen. I've found trap, often cap PTO. again, argue that's right, alone. 

Note say *should* offer less, offering necessarily mean people use --- workaholic culture real thing and, experience, stems (real imagined) fears seen ""bad employee"" least real ""team player.""

The government's mouthpiece reasoning behind *was* racist. fairly well praised news first broke seemed like right thing following hours tweeted (or made comment press briefing, quite remember) basically saying decision based trade war border wall bullshit. remember quite clearly posting article came basically ""He almost something right! say corona said quiet part loud."" used corona political tool advance agendas. Depends are. state employees law accrue sick time work given enough time would sick leave use. Vacation time well. part civil? insult person posting?  always whether they're serious, also they're spreading to. Many students tested live off-campus, many presumably parents. many parents child old enough go college probably fall at-risk groups. outright say hire it, fact. Newsflash: people lie.

I'll wait Well probably depends. die instantly accident? no. die due internal hemorrhaging hospital days later? no.

Did car accident cause hospitalized month later died ARDS? probably yes. time partay!  scares getting Covid. That's I'm everything infected. kid 7th

Called school, said online, would follow bell schedule. would fail class.

No way 7th grader going able stay home follow bell schedule youtube/games/anything fun. Awesome example. try remember next conversation have. Ty Yes excess deaths factored number probably closer 230-240k deaths attributed COVID-19. Keep mind CDC 56k excess deaths listed far that's incomplete. So, 190,000 still safe estimate. There's point arguing people. They're still trying argue deadly virus everything that's happened. Protect stay away them. Student can't learn online Politics, full competent leaders... lol sorts radical changes country needs entertaining. High school Texas teacher here. 

We second week. Still kids building. taking behavioral special ed kids first next week. ten kids. They’ll part high school. that, stagger sixty kids per day, going opposite days week. 

On colleagues got Covid right started last week. find teacher rumor mill. idea they’re students. plan isn’t awful, per se. way transparent summer. achieved 48 hours minimum... 48 days maximum. Strike, die are, thank you. mention already depressed anxious folks stuck indoors worsen due things like SAD, less/lack sunlight, etc. cold winter night spent months alone really, REALLY get you...

Let ask you. long take actually manufacture vaccine? AstraZeneca today told, get many store shelves quickly can, big batch long take ""bake""? realize probably already started I'm curious know got emergency approval many doses likely warehoused many new doses heading door week. essentially saying ""well (people comorbidities) going die anyway,

Literally everybody going die something. What's lost life years died would've otherwise died underlying condition absence COVID. 

""If COVID, person underlying condition would've lived another 3 years"" example. People touch faces less wear masks. 

This study actually finding method test good masks catch particles. studied masks validate method. parents must proud you. New cases deaths definitely trending Texas. Here's latest charts running 7-day averages schools re-opening, interesting see trend holds.

Overall Texas still better average US state. They're currently 44.73 deaths per 100k population. today. US average per capita death rate 55.13. I'm skeptical numbers regarding covid US good bad. want dismantle America? it. yup, seems like done forever (lol). could actually think this? see parents can't afford miss work feel forced bring kids school, schools metrics hit order get tax revenue. fortunate enough able take time work without fear replaced unable pay bills kids get stay home needed, get picked middle day needed. parent like ""screw sick kid, go school suffer, 9 hour shift WalMart dying get to"" comment say replied read 20 posts saying NOBODY wearing masks. tend believe THEM. fair majority types kids parents view school chore, obstacle, getting day internet tiktok videos watching live sports.
Here massachusetts much same, parents try teach kids school privilege, much like everything else. varying degrees success.  school viewed chore things return! big data dump one. Never believe data point way line previous days. Correct number half that. bonkers. I'm NYC suburb we're opening next week. Masks mandatory exceptions kindergarten up, desk plexiglass partition around it. They're contact tracing cases nobody fucking around. elementary school. Middle high schools 2 days week person make sure class capacity lowered. kid can't wear mask, get sent home remote program. matter order people stay home provide means feed themselves. something Catch 22 approach lockdown. No, would need explain it. ~180 deaths last Tuesday, ~180 Tuesday. Nothing unusual lol. even close... would best possible outcome. even possibility. mention people dying delays issues hospitals last 6 months... someone says ""Let's work vaccine let's rely herd immunity instead"" would bad. say ""Herd immunity might arrive vaccine ready"" that's different matter entirely. say ""If strictly quarantined elderly worked getting herd immunity young beginning, we'd done already end fewer deaths"" sounds radical, theory math bears out. 

I've saying literally last 6 months. literally done nothing, would better situation right now. Especially confirmed immunity lasts 3 months. Meanwhile actual dictatorial regimes planet kill people droves.

Thinking America absolute worst terribly Western-centric dismissive extreme hardship people world feel. vast majority us clean water, access kind food shelter, electricity. America!! BEST worst! 
Only best winnings Covid!! 
Smfh either change ways decline experiencing continue accelerate.

Option 3: Polygamy? Time get 3rd breadwinner home! ""about effectiveness face shields alone""

You supposed wear face shields alone- supposed wear mask. mean kid doesn’t symptoms comment relevant all? would 100% assume kid fine he/she symptoms knowledge hadn’t exposed all. end day life get back normal close possible cases going happen it’s impossible stay isolated 0 cases exist never happen. seems like school right thing quarantine kids contact 14 days everyone else resumes planned. long keep safety procedures everything fine. someone who's dad died relatively young pre-covid assure matter all. Dead dead. reason irrelevant end result same.

It matters media people choose obsess it. Quest screwed Arizona too. seem over-promise deliver. feel like come January 20, 2021 sweeping changes strategy. far band aids blame little responsibly. whole Northeast did, think. shocking number deaths. think RI’s still ranked sixth US deaths/pop 😣 You’re able tease nuance “properly tested vaccines good” reductive list? Oh yeah lot. arent even sure numbers trusted Florida staying vaccine widely available distributed.

Why? hell thought anything different? looks like gruesomely succeed since consistently refused take actions needed reduce transmission. parents working way get back work. sucks that’s reality it. work money money house.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Coronaviruses RNA viruses, many DNA viruses too! Herpesviruses example. know it’s semantics, maybe you’d find interesting. Lockdowns designed “slow spread”. Peru, like regions world, issued stay-at-home orders slow spread virus. Whether voluntary like Japan, military enforced like Peru, idea force people inside homes aren’t spreading virus amount population. Peru month 6 lockdown, virus shows hasn’t stopped spreading. highest death per capita, highest excess death rate entire world. similar numbers Belgium, believed pretty good country, Spain/Italy/UK trail well. friend NURSE RETIREMENT HOME FLORIDA tested positive, quarantined go back work waiting negative test processed. don’t know laws countries school seen optional long time holdover agrarian roots. make hard nose laws like force attendance dipshit parents they’re occasionally abused idiotic administrators. Taiwan got spread control without lockdown. double blind trials don’t take place raging pandemic. It’s like test subjects wait around get infected SARS live Canada 

Over 80% COVID deaths nursing/long term care related 

We fucked big time there, NY. 

Like, learn mistakes others? actually shortening younger people's life expectancy via increases poverty rates result shut downs. course that's probably concern you. They're talking 6% dying without pre existing conditions, money. new narrative 94% deaths happened people underlying conditions. area hot spot already. Okay, cool. guess we're page. definitely lose valuable people time (including probably beginning next year sometime lol). local government though exceptionally hard get change ways. banned sub weeks ago. 

Why lift ban? really think election COVID disappear aware shortcomings remote learning? ways unfairly disadvantages working poor parents? full shit. Excess mortality far year even higher official Covid death count.

Sure people would died underlying conditions eventually, difference ""eventually"" ""right now"" makes huge difference victims families. Well may coherent strategy works --- Big Ten college football player. unfortunate. least chunk $ going towards principal, increasing equity. stocks went year start clamoring society put poor people streets, like landlords.

Seems like many.self-described capitalists beat chests trumpet free market gambles pay off, first clamor handout take loss. Wait, schools america person? Yes. Technically US worst per capita. Yet. Yeah, remember Memorial Day? 4th July? Floridians do. Lots infections hospitalizations. 

How know Labor Day does?

Very convenient “outrage”, governor... it’s labs capacity run tests. equipment run specific test cephid, id now, helix ngs etc.

This top normal volume blood work tests daily basis. would job total fool unless team handlers heavy thinking him. know going happen refusal risk reduction - masks etc. - he/they either care desire possibly get lot people state medicaid low income elderly get medicaid medicare. What's difference? Help :( it’s like living nightmare. watch RNC it’s like coronavirus wiped out. don’t understand many complete denial reality. I'm beginning think deliberately ignoring users answer direct questions. I'll give attempt.

It proven covid affects people different ethnic backgrounds differently others. diverse sample size testing better. Whilst vaccine trials countries wlil conclude faster others, overall sample size larger diversity participants help improve data quality effectiveness vaccine. 

Does answer question extra tests needed? kids already bouncing basketballs two time. Great article. Rapid tests + PCR necessary way dont understand kids attending person classes? I'm seeing friends post kids first day whatever grade praying soo hard 🙏 

But really states rushing kids attend school???? anyone profiting person school attendance??  close contacts means need concern

I think CCISD 4 grades going school right firs couple weeks, like K 3 6 9. think building K maybe 3 it. Producing vaccines well established technology science. Don’t rush testing, rush paper work shit show. like Alabama. Lead Paragraph:

 Lithium shown capacity to: a) inhibit replication several types viruses, similar SARS-CoV-2 virus, b) increase immune response reducing lymphopenia, c) reduce inflammation preventing reducing cytokine storm. present study, treated six patients severe COVID-19 infection lithium carbonate. found lithium carbonate significantly reduced plasma reactive C-Protein levels, increased lymphocyte numbers decreased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, improving inflammatory activity immune response patients. propose lithium carbonate may deserve place treatment COVID-19. Wait... telling us 300K deaths least? reasoning could ever get people start randomly calling WFH. job require person dealings there's potential happen guess seems like one things would deal individual employees causing issues rather punish everyone something happened yet. 

But know lol forget school union busted whole city charter school bullshit. city rebuilt dystopia vision conservative values. average. remember people die younger actual life expectancy time everyone 78 live 86. Tenants get jobs contribute society instead mouching people. thousands calls emails send yours. mention... death toll trying mitigate. socially distance wear masks lockdowns flu.

I think measures still half-assed, toll still high, would significantly worse without them. Exactly, feign outrage mistake get want it. Cut Quest testing, provide additional testing infrastructure....CASES WAY DOWN!!! yet, many photos I've seen teachers schools back session wearing face shields, masks. No. wanted see original poster comment would go fixing system. Seeing fan current system safely assume right fiscally, since right, must mean left. trashing anyone highlighted extreme would make one far left-ist versus moderate realistic approach. generally prefer [actual random statements short interview. overall goals pandemic work are: minimize mortality morbidity minimize negative consequences individual trying reduce spread infection delay course pandemic, possible shift flatten top spread curve. way, burden healthcare society reduced proportion patients given time (the top curve) decreases, time preparation increases vaccines become available. effect achieved help medical measures (including antiviral treatment vaccinations) non-medical measures (including social distancing).

Shocker. Also, mention herd immunity anywhere plan.

I would started eliminating pandemic team set predecessor faced pandemic two terms. Let's go number would used someone else oval office. Lots anti-maskers states well. would imply people eventually develop symptoms not. factually incorrect case Covid-19. 

Most people show symptoms, explains countries like Sweden nearing heard immunity less 1% population tested positive, anyone symptoms test free. Biden quite good plan outlined webpage. Read want see competent technocrats recommend. partisan. dying know rationalize Chile, Uruguay Paraguay. even know possible, probably like fill contributing conditions report? according link, died 9 years young. Thanks! I’ll look it. studied coronavirus get PhD, that’s thought heard from. I’ll ask sources check. think read something 2 minutes ago said ""any covering better nothing""...there much contradicting information Covid, even funny anymore. grateful kids able come home quarantine. bet mom really misses soon get solid answer, we’re gonna agree goes 3-topping pizza St. Louis. Atlas said ""Would kindly open schools?"" happen, oxford vaccine way far ahead.  No, original post ""and china oppressing people 100% time since Mao began leading. Fuck China, Free Hong Kong. "" post mentioning often US war is, itself, whataboutism. guy TV day. convincing all.

Also terrible federal response seems harming NYC purpose. I’m confused. people hospitals telling family members Americans handling pandemic better Canadians? that’s making sound like. Sure Jan Maybe Alexei Navalny volunteer vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

/s Yeah, like people got tired hearing stopped reporting it. definitely something considered schools opening. NYC much worse shape 1970s. city back India male version Karen
 Suresh coronavirus subreddit, responding guy responded person claiming vitamin basically needed overcome SARS-CoV-2 mask prevented vitamin D. 

Do know are? need help getting back came from? words: demographics mask wearers less prone severe Covid ones already Disney fine it, I’m sure. New Zealand's governing party history spreading misinformation actively censoring news like? Don’t get Gov Stitt twit Oklahoma. held back like 8 memos freaking White House telling us take precautions. Guys dong bag Oh man you. Honestly, like Trump, definitely political move, decided defund essentially laughing. They've last credibility mind. 35 zero history heart problems. issues, pre-existing conditions. got flu, infected heart, ended hospital Myocarditis. 

had died, Myocarditis would death certificate. mean flu, caused Myocarditis, killed me. LFG I’m trying to, **during pandemic**, dumbass.

After pandemic, fair game, anyone says otherwise antisocial moron massive proportions. 1200 people die single day? 9/11 death toll every week, want watch someone reading names hours? Moderna’s injecting people similar vaccines 8 years now. difference one protein codes for, also, know, COVID jams full of. I’m really concerned long term effects vaccine compared long term effects COVID. contrast risks here. Wage garnishment income tax refund garnishment happen...ask know. TIL.  

But 25 big jump; haven’t seen stories local news MIS–C cases since first one NC. put better quote give context. Keep calling bullshit! People WalMart... Exactly. Make oozing pustules face, see mask wearers. 100%, big upswing. Especially old data Italy much specific. Ok, live country really 70% fall categories, serious problem.

How harmless Corona also shown island live. 0.001% absolute fatality rate. heavy industry followed long list things could important factor much much higher fatality rates countries. White House US. Unlike China, everyone toes party line keep social credit score up, healthy debate diversity opinions America. Americans Trump administration. Time fight it, then. there's anyone getting fucked Dumbo people like mindset, God hope ever gets infected stay community. God luck trying live Rights pandemic. put mask go inside house yesterday. didn’t even realize husband gave strange look. ""Reports"" arent always studies focus consistent issue within medical field. Reports articles speculating might issue. That's opinion. legitimate source credible one. 

CDC accurate data collecting months dating back years. done due diligence credible time time again. That's say fact opinion. rates show co-morbidity major factor. Many occur regularly elderly that, occur symptoms similar Covid. Stats also show H1N1 dangerous Covid individual death rate 0.00026%. Compared H1N1 that's extremely small. Covid number found taking non-comorbid percentage 6% deaths multiplied total US deaths Covid CDC, divided total US population. Around 10K deaths. H1N1 kills around 60-70K. go collections annoy rest eternity phone calls. What’s worse show credit years essentially create huge headache cost form high interest rate time need something requires good credit. Always try negotiate hospital don’t insurance. wrong counted. Comorbidities symptoms diseases. Diabetes literally one ones listed. still disinformation regardless. want know specifically deaths per capita? OK, NZ - 4 deaths/ million, better Canada 241 deaths / million, better US 567 deaths / million. 

My question stats are. easy access those. question think total deaths meaningful statistic deaths per capita?

That's yes asked whether thought certain variables context important, answered. 

Did though? that's second time said ""you answered"" still know supposed answer was.

The question is: judging well country handled covid is, (A) raw numbers alone enough reach firm conclusion (B) numbers alone insufficient conclusions also consider context numbers different? either/or country think better?

Canada's raw numbers look better US, Canada also advantages (due geography, population laws) expected better numbers. logic comparison NZ, except Canada/US situations much similar raw numbers. 

I'm confident enough enough information assess country expected perform. Therefore, can't accurately compare performance expectations. I'm able reach conclusion feel confident with. suspect anyone world able figure right now. think understanding nature pandemic going expand greatly next 10 years. 5% information going 10 years now, conclusion reach 5% valid. Absolutely. Fear killing lots people well. Look Dengvaxia used quote time pandemic. I’m going distance. 🙄”enslave” 

One selfish self centered comments I’ve seen  Literally everything life money. honestly sickening thing humanity. Wearing mask cowering fear missing life?

If that’s case happy clear fuck selfishness insane. *Pseudo Gold Award*
I gold give, friend someone ""gets it."" Bravo. 'Makes sense' valid argument. make sense, fair even, work. Sometime arbitrarily keep things closed little longer keep spread down.  Probably, ever encountered non standard axioms linear algebra. would get problems solve would state ""prove theorem given axioms."" many times addition defined ""a + b = + b + 1"" nonsense think clarification would anything. people bothered read CDC wrote they'd set already. get it. think vaccines take years develop liberals.

But take years develop often work proper testing takes time. Despite spending $250,000-$500,000 per person wealthy, first world countries lifetime healthcare: 

[US Healthcare ranked 29th Lancet HAQ (of 11) Commonwealth Prosperity World Health US worst rate death medically preventable causes among peer countries. 31% higher disease adjusted life years average. Higher rates medical lab errors. lower rate able make next day appointment doctor average. world doctors per capita. infant mortality levels. Yes, even adjust differences methodology. acute care beds. lower number psychiatrists. forget ability create targeted troll farms! Road fatality changes nearly significant think fatalities per mile actually also heard household accidents everyone tries DIY

Yes, president really really dumb Pretty much. Fake news please Face coverings required age 2 group sizes limited 18% normal capacity. Attendees required practice social distancing tours take place two days week instead five, Fridays Saturdays.

(And used campaign events.) Guys anyone know someone slovak residence card enter slovakia situations currently? heard closing borders... little science understand, good thing? Yes, gets us back reopening, worth it. fought virus. Americans fighting mathematics, science, facts religious nonsense. Quick maths people visit US care, [2.2 million people expected leave US seeking treatment year. said ""I wore mask park San Diego first started opening up"".

So, park major US city. wandering around alone woods. thing is, exactly ""wrong"" much victim media gaslighting. heard told thought ""well dont want racist, I'd better stop."" way stop cycle everyone stop fucking listening media. lie constantly extremely gullible. to, society, stop listening. Maybe meddle make countries shitholes leave.

100 years people still blaming US Latin America's problems. Good. globalism True, statistically less likely. data basing claim surface transmission big deal aerosol transmission? would like read new updates scientists studied. 

Also seems though referring grocery store example, stores around shirt shoes mask service policy. I’m confused, reusable bag policy added policy replacement it. Agreed. kid high social anxieties ended therapy Covid screwing daily routines, still doubt person safe. 

A year home **minor** blip otherwise hopefully long life. Knowing caused loved one (parent, grandparent teacher) die fuck life. come back dead. Well yeah generally they're (though that's usually due red tape, funding getting subjects) least one completed Phase 1 2, results analyze basically front-runners 
       
The Chinese candidates Phase data brought Doctors.. SMH fine let's say manufactured. fact still could well ""discovered"" purposefully released. end result still same. future Onion headline “thoundans protestors converge capital stop spread COVID-19” get worse  YES HITLER CUOMO CHECKMATE! looks like drunken frat boy picture. made unsubstantiated claim. asking able substantiate it. Distance learning online option. Like zoom whatever Jesus, fucking sad headline.....  people would listen fauci trump would shut fuck next time mild cold, full 3 week quarantine, right? Otherwise risk transmitting someone person dying. School policies reward ""perfect attendance""

Post WW2 school systems primarily set up, much educate, make good citizens (read: workers). taught things class, taught nonetheless: Show school regularly near perfect attendance, late, get work done time, behave. 

For example, hand perfect math assignment hits marks ""mastery,"" work late, get points taken off. 

If late class, get points taken overall grade.

If talk much otherwise get trouble, matter much mastery show subject, usually points taken grade.

If they're going teach ""citizenry"" ""how good little worker bee,"" class outlines things grades things *there,* math/english/social studies/art class. ""A total 45 children died coronavirus United States February 1 August 1—compared 105 died seasonal flu—out total 13,000 children died causes Honestly I’m sure else done. It’s concerns aren’t valid limit half capacity schools like third, two days week, temperate scans daily, schools close two cases three percent population, classrooms shut even one case, limited bathroom breaks, prepackaged food only, masks, hand sanitizer social distancing required. majority teachers aren’t comfortable either need propose specific policies need remote. difference sweden enforce lockdown measures, mean citizenry implement largely maintain lockdown measures themselves, plus population density sweden considerably lower nations; information routinely omitted people want portray lockdowns unnecessary ineffective guess gambling vaccine long term, locked country. Kiwis leave simply quarantine return (albeit gov advises this).

They partially open business, film crews coming back etc. listened public health experts, public health experts experts fields. arguing point. think we're talking two different things. Children always need care whether sick not. need care home, school. question supposed care children school? Certainly parents. I’m lucky enough preschool aged kids working front line health care. made conscious choice risk others lives since higher risk contracting spreading most. hand also ability work home do. 

I don’t think it’s subjective though government perspective. “Are policies killing people? Yes? Let’s work better policies today preserve lives constituents.”  Trying force kids back school one policies. reference Trump parody named Ronaldo Rump, Biker Mice Mars. push overestimate efficacy masks attempt get people wear them. would wear one 1 percent effective, would still need know effective make accurate risk assessments resulting best outcome right lol

That's insults sound childish. Florida hospitals holding?   evidence that, either. guess what, massive spike deaths right pandemic deadly virus, countries low level testing. wonder could be? Quit playing Also countries locked mean ""spreading unchecked""? governments introduced strong counter measures early.

That's point. death rate lockdown, imagine would without. different countries different frustrating. really sad indictment intellect US even needs explained. work district. reopening plan includes closing campus 10% students/staff test positive. mandatory testing staff students, self health check supposed home morning.

The magnitude COVID-19 pandemic underscores urgency safe effective vaccine. Many vaccine candidates focus Spike protein, targeted neutralizing antibodies plays key role viral entry. investigate diversity seen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences compare sequence vaccine candidates based. Using 18,514 sequences, perform phylogenetic, population genetics, structural bioinformatics analyses. find limited diversity across SARS-CoV-2 genomes: 11 sites show polymorphisms sequences; yet two mutations, including D614G mutation Spike, already become consensus. SARS-CoV-2 transmitted rapidly evolves, viral population becoming homogeneous, median seven nucleotide substitutions genomes. evidence purifying selection little evidence diversifying selection, substitution rates comparable across structural versus nonstructural genes. Finally, Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence Spike protein, basis different vaccine candidates, matches optimized vaccine inserts, identical ancestral sequence one mutation away consensus. rapid spread D614G mutation warrants study, results indicate drift bottleneck events explain minimal diversity found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences. findings suggest single vaccine candidate efficacious currently circulating lineages. not, used much whitening cream looks successful. India whiteness trend I'd also worry people avoiding hospitals well. Wonder much people found lump said ""I'd normally get checked want go doctors clinic hospital right now"" shooting pain arm number things would normally get checked got put backburner. 

They Covid deaths course, fear Covid mean checked sooner. terms years life lost. Friendly reminder everyone here: it’s really hard stop growth anything lab experiment. probably like 20 reagents would stop growth COVID-19 bench fridge, I’m even full-time wet lab anymore!

It’s even matter selectively killing virus human cells. chemical also work body, meaning delivered target sufficiently high concentrations work. even that, drug candidate often say “fuck you, I’m anything!” unfortunately, despite much know body medicine, still don’t know enough predict everything. Mine pretty strong. Headaches 2-3 days. Severe arm soreness pain lift it. Body aches. Nausea night shot. went away 3 days I'm interested see side effects come second dose Guinea pig high five!


Weet weet weet! needs federal government? Landlords supply housing, difficulty cause supply restriction. simply squat housing people produced hopes extorting profit something people need live. 

They rent-seekers (literally) value producers. second time data submitted. think times pretty convenient DeSantis act like infections sudden bunch come like - oh well, old data, worry that. saying safe now, know labs whose data ""in"" 


How know labs holding back data now. Making look better is.  


I'm teacher part job check students submitted work. missing work, need realize ask again. 


I feel like DOH FL verify results - basically free all. benefits DeSantis cases reported fact. Atlantic credible source unbiased information. CDC link talks follow-ups three weeks testing. I’ve colds took long clear up. None justifies destructive lockdown measures. People still influenced commercials woken coma seems. Super power 2020 looks like bust point, come back next year Murphy also cut back cases started rise mid-summer, limiting outdoor gatherings postponing indoor dining, kept potential second wave bay. sn agency trust?

This 100% outcome Putin looking got man White House. goal create much confusion, chaos, infighting nobody would trust institutions anymore.

Bravo. actually line early estimates, 100,000 240,000 deaths intervention.

 interested epidemiologists decide classify covid-related deaths look back years. miss early detection cancer don’t find later stage, Covid related? excess suicides due economic collapse Covid-related?

Guess find out. **Affiliation:** McGill University, Department Philosophy 

**Study Title:** COVID19 Beliefs impact Cognition Mental Health

**Study Description:** Researchers McGill invite take part research study help us understand a)the diversity beliefs around COVID-19 pandemic b) COVID-19 pandemic and/or social isolation may affecting aspects mental health thought processes . study carried Dr. Ian Gold McGill University. **You must 18 years age participate.**

**Study Link:** (ethical/legal):** study approved McGill University Institutional Ethics Board, (REB File: #20-05-026).

**End Date:** June 2021 Ditto lucky they’ll go broke world move without parasites Covid pandemic around last year. point moot. Good luck get covid. Nope. Disney Universal aren’t reporting employee positivity even bother test. Pourquoi pas les deux? So, argument massive spike excess deaths happening time Covid spread due Covid?

The data show Covid specific deaths 6%, deaths result Coronavirus infection list effect, like respiratory failure. India- catching really fast soon number 1 data accusing misrepresenting? article posted covered 12,469 deaths H1N1 pandemic 1 year April 12, 2009 April 10, 2010 US. article states 500,000 deaths annually global basis. US 4.25% world population better health care nothing misrepresented that.

If look last 100 years yes, influenza deadliest costliest virus humans, look past 100 days.

Anyway, sorry almost died H1N1 last year happy suffered long term effects COVID-19. dangerous viruses comorbidities safe say want catch either definitely want time get flu shot! Uh, don’t think contestants supposed talk other. Funny implemented quarantine faster anyone continent still bad. economy informal put quarantine without people going streets sell stuff eat. broke got bad pandemic going on. Worst year graduate fr... yet somehow swedish people always saying good reddit. scary virus. yet know little post-COVID effects like this. hope data catches fast enough doubters change minds. consider 60% country fits one comorbidites start understand meaningless think way. Ah, that's Stephen Seagal's publication. news: sky, still blue. Voting POTUS change shit. local way state make pushes change. nobody votes put people charge push goals instead actual good people ideal? Shutting down, going lockdown, opening back restarting process. point best bet play. 

The virus major health concern it’s one it’s doomsday virus. Flattening curve realistic goal, “waiting vaccine” quite ridiculous one never part plan. news, water wet. don’t think you’re using term ironically using brainwashed ironic Historically America, many people would get vaccine, *or already gotten it* without ever knowing.  Oh know said that. said population obesity high blood pressure diabetes ! Coworkers response ""I things "" oh right forgot perfect precious angel unhealthy fucks deserve die. Like said. I'm tired. lol sound like Chinese apologist. you’d trade QoL US high speed rail “infrastructure” don’t know tell think concern approval would rushed there’s testing. Makes sense, basically situation, schools really changed attendance policies 2 weeks. This. parties fault. Parents want keep kids home, schools award perfect attendance, state threatens punishment miss much school.

It's system full unintended consequences, perfectly tuned wreak havoc pandemic. Djokovic real hard time win Cincinnati ATP tournament Sunday, Covid 2 months ago. good people sides, right? Well, sucks. believe investment thing. US wanted, could afford both. bulk population want subsidized child care. That's going change lifetime, young nation's could change lifetime. Yep never end deside resume life eventually. waste minute it, time something never get back. Logically speaking Tobacco &amp; alcohol individually kill 4-5 times people low end I'm sure &amp; one bats eye. body's made fight viruses, treat body right &amp; let handle rest.

If Texans want risk covid killer hoax .😱No sweat Abbotts back ya'll. republican still support administration ?  Clearly since following sub Either way reopening schools disastrous move made argument, people say “well look around, you’re *that* locked down.” winning sane guy says we're fine 180k dead people..you need aim 500k dead people realize middle fucking pandemic acting like fucking toddlers wearing maks going escalate situation.. stupid say judging comment..
. Except nasty long-term heart lung issues, right?

More fear-mongering. suffer issues minority political point prove, consequences damned.

No, government taking care everyone. instead rich thriving open economy lower classes make living. next stimulus? people can't get unemployment? fuck them, huh? getting paid working home missing beat care less struggling families right now. three options: lockdown vulnerable immunocompromised proximity (living forced contact them). Pay people stay home, let everyone else go lives. Option 2: Open fuck it. Start building temporary hospitals open bed space. Option 3. Continue half measures go nowhere. /s. dozens stories last week potential FDA approve something October. might benefit someone's reelection, redditors hard it. like Children Men scenario. That's counted. counted Covid illness compounding previous condition. hard read understand it? literally someone pull H1N1 co-morbidity stats shows 75% around 12k people. Covid 94% around 9K people. That's less. Let's elementary math yeah? H1N1 literally stats dangerous. ""No shit."" -Most country. Haha, no, farmers dont get paid, wont harvest crops. Fuck that! FDA lost credibility. fucking way vaccine approved political agency, ever credibility needed wide adoption. Panamanian, attend this... 6 months full lockdown staying home. Mask mandatory soon put step house, go based genre, men (Tuesday, Thursday Saturday) women (Monday, Wednesday Friday). shit show even measures one worst coronavirus hotspots (Top 3 according worldometers), thankfully months communist quarantine September 14 relax measures. economy taken big hit due economical movement many months (No restaurants allowed open except deliveries), things like barbershops/department stores, malls, casinos etc. People support total lockdown minds, went route brought disaster good. Thankfully family well seeing others lose everything saddening. 

Edit: grammar, info Ohhhh triggered 😂🤣🤣🤣 r/howyoudoin thought read day halting trials US one want pay benefits because, due years Republican mismanagement, can't afford pay benefits. can’t real I'm glad starting track LMAO dentists around parts hour Maine border USED month wait time normally get see days clogged Americans. Come Nov 4th, matter wins, it'll over. Kids back school. Businesses open. Life back normal.

I honestly hate way virus politicized fucking votes. lives, fucking votes gain power. collateral damage politicians. power greed matter side aisle. 

Hate Trump Biden want wasting alot inner strength worth it. fucking lie, pander steal. 

I view elections like WWE wrestling match. outcome already predetermined drama match must staged viewing pleasure. Yup I’m totally nazi.. know fucking stupid sound? Easier say anti antifascist, profacist, yes? No, misinformation anyone basic understanding health statistics understands. don’t, suggest start searching stats course online level dumbery, employable unless it’s pump gas. know dem-soc is... farm.  live capitalist society. can't make money pay bills I'm wearing body harvest it.


Maybe people dependent less 1% population nutrition?  roll coal screech ""YEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!"" “Shock” article says trial last two years? Seems little long trying times, no? Wife pharmacy technician. live 5 hours Canada new customers getting medication getting Canada. System broken people need neither. least comment made sense. short, cover up... Meh. Houston, hospitalizations deaths steadily declining time period. would case hiding positive cases. did? saw video person using pop socket place missing ear. Thought clever. Yes are. That's less Covid 6% non-affiliated co-morbidity. 

Can math? 

25% bigger 6%. hope that's hard. 94% co-morbidity much higher 75%. Thanks proving right buddy. then. We'll spin wheel 20 slots, winning slot comes up, get operated on. Maybe surgeon removes half one lungs, kidney, scrapes heart tissue. maybe prefrontal lobotomy, severing olfactory nerves, little much electroshock therapy. Maybe three above. It'll surprise. 

Care sign that? God needed another Angel already know even matter cause one anything it... think mean skin color antonym red terrorism. Define fascist please. 😒 tried Uhh, no. Excess deaths deaths. Non-covid deaths excluded. suffer previously documented comorbid disease count towards 6% co-morbidity stats. due data people previous, co-morbid, condition. hard.

Completely false. comorbidities acute conditions likes respiratory failure. Nobody walking around pre-existing respiratory failure cardiac arrest. Yeah Jesus liberty loving wheeling dealing American capitalist. 6%, great, terrible populations size developed countries. No.

But required get attend things like school, yes. mean...the US longer Top 10 deaths per million Mexico plus South American countries going surpass soon.

And hot air US response, terrible, everyone seems forget Europe midst shitting bed again.

But that’s point, lockdown couple months can’t forever. countries done you’re seeing increases cases countries like France, Spain, Italy on. 

The US gets absolutely shit locking country extended period time....but EU didn’t lock way either...each “state”
acted based situation....which different US response.

Each EU member testing....just like every US state. 

It’s fun bash Trump he’s easy target lot people need get perspective. 100,000-200,000 pretty accurate. Abstract 

Global health threatened COVID-19 pandemic, caused novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Although considered primarily respiratory infection, many COVID-19 patients also suffer severe cardiovascular disease. Improving patient care critically relies understanding cardiovascular pathology caused directly viral infection cardiac cells indirectly via systemic inflammation and/or coagulation abnormalities. examine cardiac tropism SARS-CoV-2 using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) three-dimensional engineered heart tissues (3D-EHTs). observe hPSC-CMs express viral receptor ACE2 viral processing factors, SARS-CoV-2 readily infects replicates within hPSC-CMs, resulting rapid cell death. Moreover, infected hPSC-CMs show progressive impairment electrophysiological contractile properties. **Thus, COVID-19-related cardiac symptoms likely result direct cardiotoxic effect SARS-CoV-2. Long-term cardiac complications might possible sequelae patients recover illness.** realize left dead also. Excess deaths misrepresented provisional count created. actually read cdc coding method would acknowledge positive test needed positive Covid code. SIMPLE THAT. That's provisional count made- account misrepresented numbers. 

That accurate statistic. 

If suffer **previously documented comorbid disease** count towards 6% co-morbidity stats. due data people previous, co-morbid, condition. hard. works not, ramifications taking unvetted vaccine. Shot scary bullet proof, doubt it'll placibo.

And Russian vaccine, reason avoid it. US 12/12. get free desert? Ok well someone tell coworkers. According them, deaths people covid comorbidities matter, also tons false positives, also everything reopen go back normal election bc make Trump look bad. I'm tired. know anymore bc nothing matters. someone tell me. Thanks. IFR diamond princess 20X average flu. less dangerous flu, excess deaths would lower, WAY I'm scientist (data science) I'm good listening scientists outside area expertise. mRNA vaccines tested en mass cautionary principle applies. listen me. Listen actual medical experts saying thing I'm saying.

Vaccine specialists optimistic cautious mRNA vaccines (btw said viruses imagine meant vaccines)  Aye, crack open cold one schadenfreude. empathy reserved deserve it, circle people encompasses almost everyone dumbfuckistan. Nothing psychopathic it. That’s I’m saying. needed official announcement guess get 10 packages Sanofi brand insulins $99 month. relied Canadian insulin, good alternative. Talk local pharmacist Yeah! Lol Lol far strict. tried make strict people go work sell things starve. Peru completely mishandling this. allowed indoor dinning concerts thats getting worse day day. I'm going saying, ""amigo."" fault ""mad"" incoherent, brah. Respiratory virus wearing mask go hand-in-hand.

If legitimately worried run masks, told people put anything face except N95; save health workers.

Of covered mugs beginning something - anything - 6 million confirmed cases now.

And run masks happened anyways - even small number people able deduce ""respiratory virus"" means covering damn mouths nose - whether protect people. bad China it.  America: hold beer... back forth back forth

just get vaccine meds thats give shit about...... openly-stated goal encourage spreading virus much possible. irrational feel even frustrated see exposed nose covered chin opposed seeing someone completely maskless? 

I mean, latter group gives pause, compared them, former group really gets me. healthy people die multiple comorbidities. noted, pneumonia, respiratory failure heart stops due lack oxygen, that's 3 comorbidities. 9K list even though vast majority form respiratory distress leading death. either errors person filling paper work know time investigate. Covid kill own. misinterpreting arbitrary decisions whats report.

Excess deaths disprove notion died flu. That's even Thanks Honestly feels like pandemic already ended. news hardly covering anymore covering riots upcoming elections. times really remember still pandemic wear mask. Potus would never lie! honorable man is!  ^^^^/s Expected since simple rule - US accuses country something, US either already right now, past, plants future. Agree. restaurant industry Orlando finally embraced mask culture we’re seeing bars creative order open stay alive. Texas open. Right? Looks helpful. I'll check every again. Thx! “tiny fraction death.” Undoubtedly plays part.

That's major understatement! positivity rate drops 1-2%, really reason drop further! (unless bulk testing large chunks population).

So 5x drop positivity 20x drop cases, means every new case results 4x people tested seems like good thing rather warning sign.. What? make sense, amigo. Like, seriously, train thought followable.

You keep assuming things me. mad hypocritical accused assuming things you. article provides pretty good list. look state level data see usually diabetes, obesity, heart disease also primary driver hospitalization. young disease able live fairly normally minimal hospitalization death group. think affected deaths well? Would pretty difficult suppressing death rate (I would hope) shit late US? UK's Phase 3 started early June. Brazil's arm started late June. 

Imagine got shots back then? great data would since second wave beginning.  difference fauci admitted wrong changed opinion, something adults presented new evidence. fact fauci shitty little mask thing way back shows much grasping straws. [Judge lest ye happens everyday west. dumpsters trash cans instead fields. right, think believe care rest world handling virus either. That's death toll 180,000 counting 1000+ new deaths day government declaring mission accomplished. one blood relatives tells day, freezer trucks outside work hold dead bodies piling up, co-workers given 1 mask week told re-use them, use garbage bags instead proper PPE, turn people away tests clearly symptomatic, tune presidents daily corona briefings consistently disregards scientific advice tells people drink bleach makes look bad, call life experience. freezer trucks show outside dads work, i'll reconsider country handling better want manipulate claim without defending that's fine. data shows dangerous previously thought. H1N1 higher risk this. Princess Dimond cruise perfect sample size since isolated event data that, incredible sample study, supports current that's misrepresented bud. No, would probably far less. However US population general healthy. Kindergarten teacher sent email parents yesterday reminding everyone kids Zoom meetings work Canvas truancy charges could filed. 

That's heavy shit right there. draconian consequences missing days help.

The year graduated, school district implemented mandatory attendance policy. student 4 unexcused absences class 9 week period, failed class. way get excuse doctor's note, even something obvious like high fever, vomiting, pink eye, etc. Since parents take time work spend $50-100 doctor sign note, sent kids school sick let school sort out. f'ing glad graduated BS went effect. “As much possible” subjective, though. going outside all? so, you’re potentially exposing others.

It’s finding balance. Yes, sure. great legislative answers, mean good answers parents right moment kill messenger, say...

""The order, endorsed Dr. Deena Hinshaw, states 'an operator school need ensure students, staff members visitors able maintain minimum two metres distance every person student, staff students seated desk table.'""

The next paragraph follows with: ""The decision applies classrooms instructional settings seats arranged prevent students facing one another."" 

So social distancing abolished specific kind classroom arrangement only? still wear masks either case classroom?

Later on: ""Hinshaw adds masks remain mandatory students, staff teachers shared areas, including hallways buses, appropriate distancing cannot maintained.""

Again, question is: masks mandatory still anyway schools? Even yes, understand teachers' union upset this.

And generally think Alberta bit racist cesspool based largely anecdotes heard Canadians actual data random sample, New Canadian impression public health official negative. grow US, standards acceptable levels competence integrity lower, mind you.

Anyway, thanks posting original link. Coronavirus finally got well-deserved break. Agreed. also asymptomatic infections thing, whether symptoms not, sending school death sentence child’s teacher.  I've students situation. used let take nap back room feel good. wish could more. need let know.... Democrats conservatives.

Wait approve one fine. average obese person dies younger average person dying C-19. 200,000 - 400,000 Americans die obesity every year, growing immunity make number lower next year. Almost half Americans obese movement simply accept it. People don’t care health. people expected different C-19 never know. let us down.

Isn't executive experience limited formerly owning pest control company? governing public service experience, correct? Id interested see much number suicides people afraid go doctor things

It’s like news media *just now* learning things painfully obvious entire field decades. thats awful  Yes, far less frequent interaction risk people. effects year’s crisis lasting. Even best-case scenario, UN predicts famine increase next decade pre-pandemic forecasts. 2030, number malnourished people world reach 909 million compared 841 million estimates end year alone, 12,000 people could die every day famine linked pandemic. could victims virus itself, estimates NGO Oxfam International. values ​​are based jump 80 percent number people risk crisis-induced growth malnutrition also significant effect. lead weakened immune system, limited mobility, even deterioration brain function. Children exposed malnutrition early age feel effect later life. someone thinks commercial good source information making decisions children's futures. anything, undercounting COVID-19 deaths. see clearly looking many people died year versus previous years.

I agree excess deaths is, statistically speaking, excellent indicator actual death count. UK increases actual count 64K, vs official number 41K died due COVID-19.

One add though, excess death caused people either unwilling unable get medical care fear COVID-19 load COVID-19 created health-care system strictly speaking, die COVID-19. No, elective procedures imply procedures necessary treat disease prolong ones life, optional nature treatments procedures available. 

Cancer screenings biopsies diagnostic nature medical professional makes case necessity ones insurance provider would covered such.

It's frighteningly easy sick kid get system go almost un-noticed barring testing. UV single largest environmental factor. Texas already thousands covid cases schools since reopening person started Early August. We're tracking : Brilliant! Less testing less cases! recall Quest one biggest testing facilities? stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. It’s true, applied literally anything making completely meaningless. 


“Mount Everest tallest mountain world.”


“To fair Mount Everest tallest mountain humans decided that’s it’s called. Letters arbitrary symbols assigned. said, mountain represented name “Mount Everest” tallest one world.” parents said first 6 months day care sick almost entire time. said also got sick several times 6 months. exposed sooo many kids little immune system tank now. haven’t sick since kid outside minor colds. chance putting someone else risk extremely low tested often. actually understand science someone immediately symptomatic moment contract COVID. Big-12's protocols testing Wed, Fri Sunday. football player manages pick COVID somewhere, never couple days test would immediately isolate become symptomatic. NBA, MLS, NHL 40 different soccer leagues actually managed start finish seasons safely aside yearly asymptomatic outbreaks, MLB well also.

more people risk take 20 year old, ban campus, send home parents grandparents remove ability get instant tests 3x/week hospital close by.  hard figure out. link actual don’t understand need go blog post find it. anyways, saying “all communication channels recorded observed” huge overstatement. wouldn’t believe number companies don’t this. jobs require person work don’t provide paid sick leave reprimand using it. mean private lab. look what’s administered processed FDOH it’s teeny tiny number every day.  point trying make ambition leaves people spread thin. Like dog chasing car, run Life. 

But yes stay healthy.  vaccine projects ultimately fail.

[Most vacacine projects reach Phase 3 high chance Lol, impeachment means nothing. Call progressive, think life matters objective preserve much going shitter possible. ever need much proof ppl get program? fucking common sense? rains, umbrella help block water? Like fuck hard fucking idiots? “The way get ahead that, try explain people, want people assume ... overreacting looks like overreacting, probably right thing,” -Dr. Anthony Fauci, March, 2020 measures implement science? numbers too. 

Scientists say 'there evidence something', next day read headlines link two. 

Like saying:

Detective, John kill Roger?  
\- evidence crime 
John innocent crime.  high positivity rate signals testing enough, missing fair amount active cases. I'd like see Abbott subjected peer reviewed accountability. Lmao reported acct quick trusted found would cave political pressure black white anymore. Reddit going tough combat fake news. far left far right news sources going hyping fear tactics point nobody going want take vaccine. Even Fauci said he's particularly concerned safety, efficacy now.  
For me, signed trails, get picked. I'll first line available general public. almost like they're brainwashed lies

The thing hear kinds people ""I'm pretty sure early year, like cold""

Of course, never got test think account deleted now

LOL *per se also mean 94% deaths ""underlying conditions."" Sure, list includes hypertension diabetes, bulk comorbidites listed CDC include: ARDS, respiratory failure, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, heart failure, renal failure, sepsis.  point comorbidity list two fold: 1) factors increase risk death, 2) ways covid actually kills Litteral blood money. masks use daily, fucking shopping bags can't use own, extra gloves use work disaster. already use credit, pay credit cards full every month, nothing left over, use like debit cards. guess shut credit cards could issue, use debit card pay straight bank account. mom tested positive month ago. ticks boxes people get really sick it. 62, weight, high blood pressure along bunch problems. 2 weeks low fever, body aches, slight cough, slept almost day every day, lost sense taste/smell. fine now. worried problems hit like flu. Yeah easy keep DL adults kids even teens pretty dumb, even higher functioning ones. cup “I shocked“ please. Absolutely correct look study masks protect others. go outside put mask NJ mask orders outside since July 8th. School teaching learning. baby sitters 
Also someone mentioned even childcare cannot enlisted take care sick children? Perhaps change too, bigger child care facilities separate areas sick children. hire cna similar look them. Yes again, know fantasy land, alternative - sending kids school sick way better option. Except I'm not, said exact words thought fringe facebook idea lmao.  must high. bizarre way interpret statistics. Multifactor causality real thing, rare find disease death influenced comorbid conditions. What's important person well controlled diabetes hypertension, example, would probably still alive today COVID-19. Proclaiming 6% covid deaths actually caused virus assinine. Also Argentina, super long lockdown 150+ days, economy destroyed yesterday reached 400k cases FDA outright said along might approve vaccine partial phase 3 data, data good enough Nice guys keep 😁👍  Hey guy who's constantly double talking. I'm sure he's honest time though. almost like worshiping money gotten us bad position here......  Poland far right, expect? know vast, vast majority people recover COVID fine, right? 

I’m trying downplay seriousness vulnerable populations, come on. It’s going “wipe us out.” ""wear mask dont endanger others"". masks useless fuck others. wearing one human rights. im sick.

""wear mask protect yourself"". wear mask. 

they told people masks protect wearer. 
""they dont protect others"". humanity ignorant selfish. covid easymode climate change. fucked anyway Excellent points worded well. Pretty sure can’t spread Covid full immunity. It’s similar coronaviruses respect. issue potential vaccine may confer full immunity cases. means average redditor social Karen moral viewpoint. mean place want build [Fort made official national king, ruled populous party European Court Justice... mean country share disregard human life anti-intellectualism American right?

At least America center bit left fight far right, Poland right far right. Shit holes gota shit hole Tough luck Switzerland! make cut! would generate CO2 incinerating worked restaurant would “fire” brought doctors note would “rehire” reviewed note. note, job.

When yoy say ""some people day earth flat, say round"", speaking true, instead propping lie.

Stop it. better that. Awesome, thank you! doubt get test positive first day peeps. go changing subject again. fans going game. said, ""Don't like it, go game"" makes seem like fans going game going needlessly putting others risk. absolutely wrong. 

When presented that, changed subject players schools. suspect know comment kinda boneheaded want address it. admit comment wrong. 

The fans going putting others risk completely avoidable reasons ""Don't like it, go game"" B.S. sentiment. understand frustration.

I think new plan little gung-ho school reopening, main problem can't constantly make new plans expect people listen care. First statewide Phases, counties allowed jump phases, areas allowed hybrid phases. scrapped phases went watchlist. watchlist gone we're color tiers. 

Nobody know actually expects color tier system last much longer, either. There's something said willing change new evidence comes in, can't constantly announce scrap long-term plans without people tuning entirely. many good answers... Right, 25% “go back normal”, that’s precisely I’m saying. reasonable hygiene (aka altered behavior) seems significant milestone group immunity. visitor Canada. costs much Texas pocket.

Sue... whole COVID situation US really shows objectively lack leadership. Bush Katrina essentially lost entire US city. Sure, rebuilt, rebuilt corporations many many many people lost house culture part it.

If US face SERIOUS disaster (say 5x serious COVID) could result millions deaths could plunge US depression.

US anti-intellectualism FAR FAR FAR dangerous COVID.

COVID spreading misinformation masks. COVID trying stop testing. COVID responsible US form serious contact tracing, etc.  I'd kind rather waste energy arguing you. Cool. parents would lacking empathy department start with. UVM exactly small school 10000 undergrads, solidly medium sized. Two years. pandemic control burns within 2 years, probably gonna wipe us matter what. I'm going historic precedent, btw. famine mostly third world countries.

And would really work say Norway told people ""we ain't locking famine India next year, get covid screw you, Norwegians !!"". 

It's like system links countries keep stuff flowing, country particular resonsibility system links. yeah, somewhat fragile breaks global crisis. I’m saying aren’t important. I’m saying school system grades things *in process* grading math skills. show mastery math math grade reflect that. shouldn’t clouded extraneous bullshite. extraneous bullshite important, needs class separate grade that. 

If you’re trying get job math teacher, future employer know good math well timely. stands may B math, looks like haven’t mastered skill, it’s tend late. “late” scale may subjectively elevated. may important potential employer know you’re always late, need able assess hirability (sp ?) fairly objectively, weeding B grade it’s true meaning. 

Normative grading sucks btw. that’s another story. read Second Thought's voice? really ""reopening schools"". They've open since June, summer vacation  sister teaches now. surrounding ISD's look CCISD far do. Everyone follows lead. We're still talking 6 times IFR seasonal flu.

When decide flu worst virus we're willing accept without shutting society stripping people civil liberties? need much evidence ""worse flu"" resort unknowns regarding long term effects mild cases troubling.

How unknowns regarding long term effects shutdowns? mental health issues? poverty unemployment rates? small businesses bubble rest society say goodbye 2022?

I'd say better bubble risk instead *all society.* They're working vaccine able distributed risk, elderly, early 2021. Meanwhile good evidence, especially places like Sweden, herd immunity reached seems people actually considering costs benefits semblance rational way

I agree this, seems like maybe opposite reasons. think negative effects shutdowns *massively* understated. need take practical sustainable measures like masks public, getting close strangers, staying home feeling well. Otherwise, time let young healthy manage risks go back living lives. also time stop pretending like economy important, government fund things indefinitely unemployment rates skyrocket (which means less tax revenue!), eventually we're gonna run money things like food housing going become problem *everyone* except, course, already wealthy. idea common is: fraction outbreaks Texas Elementary Schools August - [Sul Ross Elementary, Henderson + [Reeves Hinger + [City View + [Coahoma + [Wilson + [Walnut Springs + [EK Downing + [Reagan + [LBJ + [Fry + [Mission Ridge + [Steadham + [Montclair + [Freeman + [Centerville + [Hardin Jefferson + [Henderson Primary + [Kilgore + [Latexo + [Velma Penny + [McLeod + [Mason + [Mineola + [Woodway + [Hughes + [Rice + [Cox tracking since state : forgiving

I'm totally mean snarky, please take personal attack, teachers forgiving? They're underpaid take care 30 screaming kids time making sure learn enough useful members society.

Come me, downvotes. Yeah make sense. kid online kindergarten though specific school Hillsborough country. hour two online screen time. well sofar trys run off. Hopefully gets better homeschooling kindergarten kids easy task. incorrect world big place. People still think earth flat moon landing faked. want waste energy 'exposing' them, knock out. know, feel sorry guys :( still, way, might worth try. nation wide coordinated plan, designed medical authorities, would good start. improving situation AZ ASU? Avoid reposting information. many religious people America, quite opposite actually. No, part problem people Jonestown didn’t .6% chance dying drinking kool aid. Part problem school funding formulas. states fund schools many students school day X (October 1 usual suspect). states fund schools ADA, Average Daily Attendance. absent students ADA states cost school money, perverse incentive want kids school even they're sick. They're literally \*paid\* sick kids school.

Note -- simplified significantly (the funding formulas downright byzantine states), TLDR: Schools get paid sick kids school, thus set policies encouraging sick kids come school, despite lip service contrary. it? wonder mad rich people lol Basically callous, deceitful, hostile, impulsive, manipulative, risk-taking assholes ones think wear masks. #sciencerules Texas governor thing, approval rating plummited, cases deaths started exploding, gave us consolidation prize ""requiring"" everyone wear masks. Florida exactly Texas already went fucked state hard. Get ready health economic impact. Things “winding down.” US Midwest still trending sharply upwards, example.  Went get tested yesterday public site city free. line, wait. nice wait, wonder people getting tested times. guys saying literally 40 years say objectively better, whose objective? disease care statistical gerrymandering. act like everyone it, going get it. worse, spread lot realize it. dumbest person knows going happen. wear mask house. “neither America”

That’s speculation assume based poll showed 40% people said would get vaccine available. poll showed another 40% undecided. 20% said would get it. would fall undecided simply wait read efficacy report phase III 4 leading candidates. me, live America. talk guilt like people give shit. Well winter also flu cold season plummeting everyone’s immune system outdoors direct sunlight. masks, fine. That's point. point list CDC gave us pre-existing conditions, conditions causes upon death. include pre-existing conditions, that.  


The list people saying pre-existing conditions like half causes death.  


You 'cardiac arrest' pre-existing condition. That's I'm concerned about. Especially winter, sub zero temperatures (surface aerosol transmission). Surely London cases Scotland? sent school sick. Look **every politician like past 50 years**, doomed us all. trapped hell. would developed nations care repercussions lock poor countries? They're trying protect populations world. got Marines last year lol.

I got Corps back 2011 left live South America 2015. regret coming back every single day lol ""might"" vs already 175k+ dead really lot weight. sorry ""almost maybe might possibly"" died guess. People really care. heard way many ""if time time"" excuses reasonably should. Things going get hectic next weeks Russian Roulette 1/6 chance. county 3.5-4% positive rate. 8% cases hospitalized. 2% ICU. Feel like odds different...  Fake nudes? think want Bella Thorne thread.  Fine fine, list :) Ethical concerns? I’m saying clone living, thinking human beings, grow torsos stem cells. Back late 2000's changed school policy never showed school passed final exam would still fail year. Meanwhile child perfect attendance homework record failed final would still pass. 

That insanity me. Logic would dictate dont pass unless know material. True news channels, know much deliberate misinformation. seems channels deliberately misreport things channels report things heat moment always get right. swim team member high school tested positive Day One. tested weekend, test results gotten yet, went school like everything normal. got results 1 p.m. first day. went well. petty enough say shit like 

""I actually never made ""stupid prediction"" - I've made correct ones, along, literally dozens them. go comb comments past 6 months find I've never wrong."" Wow. state must something right. got daughter’s results next day. Loads friends Facebook saying ‘yeah! Finally peace quiet!’
Wtf. 
Did expect robo-kids? RemindMe! 30 days I'm hoping COVID opened eyes WFH majority time. I'm WFM 95% right begged doctor medical lol. Otherwise they'd coming every week thing home, ugh. issue many schools went break teachers staff told would coming back fall hybrid learning person. schools teachers spent lot summer planning for. actually get closer, see lot schools districts start backpedal switch online learning. online learning supposed great say general public parents. likely would that's schools teachers planning whole time, alas that's lot districts focus last months. can't tell many pieces trash see blow trash trucks definitely can't wear masks social distance appropriately. That's shown time time again. people wear masks. people social distance probably. even excluding crazy people refuse wear masks, even wear rarely properly consistently. I'll post thread. Let's take COVID equation.

Between February 1 July 24 (the recent week fairly complete data) US Deaths - Causes 115% Expected. 270,000 Americans died expected die last 6 months.

After we've accounted *expected* deaths (who ""were gonna die anyway""), account unexpected ones? Lol Canadian teachers don’t make $19 hour man. average wage elementary school teacher province $44 ($33usd), low end $35 (26usd) high end $55 ($42usd). 

For high school, average $50 ($37usd), low end also $35($26usd) high end $60+ ($45usd)

Keep mind province arguably worst country teacher even non union education assistants make $20+. another province, average provincial wage BC: $75,000 ($60,000 come family go teachers. Parents, siblings, nephews. low end looking like $30 hour, $22-$25ish USD. making $60,000usd range senior ones make $80-90,000USD. Sorry, no. many studies done hard track remember one goes common unproven objection masking Well best zazu. curious, find home schooled children need help? reports investigation? Look actual question asked:

""If vaccine COVID-19 available, would get it."" Agree/disagree?

You're given enough information make meaningful choice, many people going disagree caution. available enough. also see effectiveness rates, side effect profiles, possibly talk doctor regard individual medical conditions. think looking starting wage Canadian teacher. wife elementary teacher BC makes $85,000. Keep mind, salary summer breaks, spring breaks winter breaks off. would say that's pretty nice wage. No, I'm saying completely **bullshit** Fauci hand wave away fact many 190k people would lived 6 months. going say thing 2021 goes on?

He acts like crystal ball convenient.  That's true. worked HIV/AIDS surveillance San Francisco years. absolutely death certificates. posted above: 

Fine. Let's take COVID equation.

Between February 1 July 24 (the recent week fairly complete data) US Deaths - Causes 115% Expected. 270,000 Americans died expected die last 6 months.

After we've accounted *expected* deaths (who ""were gonna die anyway""), account unexpected ones? CDC numbers seem say Fauci under-counting many would still alive typical year. It’s sad educator this.  12 days norm everywhere. Minnesota friend got results two days. One reasons switched kid private school truancy letters would constantly receive son chronic illness. would catch cold classmate sent school green boogers son would end icu severe asthma, pneumonia, respiratory infections. multiple times would stay home miss school severe food allergies refused accomadate within classroom would regular severe attacks need treatments miss school days. classroom party always included food allergy could unsafe. built IEP due chronic illness allergies missing days built still received threats truancy. evidence masks helped 1918? ""we something scientific base hundred years ago"" good argument again? reach conclusion comorbidities?

Sure, doesn’t directly mean “pre-existing,” majority cases certainly does. People aren’t instantly becoming obese diabetic catching covid... phase 3 studies involve many people, mostly need figure efficacy vaccine. Essentially, efficacy happen need certain number people trial get sick coronavirus. enough infections trial group, data unblinded see there’s difference placebo vaccine group.

Safety focus earlier phases, smaller completed prior release. However, long phase 3 lasts dependent long takes enough people get sick. big reason takes long time approve many new vaccines, aren’t enough events see difference placebo vaccine.

Of course, safety looked phase 3 even release well. However, goal phase 3 state “despite risks, it’s better give vaccine everyone rather not”. teacher, tell students worse before, even much worse online learning. equity issue either way - also communities heavily affected COVID many cases. Either way poor decision going majorly impact health lives people long run. There's easy call - would love get back teaching classroom, live right time yet. would try NYC low case levels, schools would need also guarantee proper precautions that's would worries about. proper cautions low enough COVID numbers, look others countries successfully able go back school without needing shut again. made account specifically r/leopardsatemyface

Comment responded like innocent r/shitAmericanssay - see point.

(P.S. reason Aussie laughter:

[~43% Americans passports versus [~58% USA count non-citizen green card immigrant passport holders statistics, Australia counts citizens. would drastically lower amount Americans using passports recreational travel, would instead include many Mexican, Cuban Canadian green card holders working United States require passport prove identity. reverse also true - Americans working border regions Mexico Canada need passports. Australians can’t simply travel accross land boundary day work another country, others same.

Now comes actual travel - whilst many Australians fly 3-8 hours closest ‘neighbouring’ countries Indonesia New Zealand holidays, remaining 60% 2019 travelling Aussies [flew 8 - 20 hours destinations Asia, Europe Despite fairly rigourous Internet search morning, could find list travel destination statistics comparatively smaller proportion US passport holders - state department information passport statistics places US passport valid and/or visa required. However, think safe conclude much larger proportion Australians travel least annually destinations duration flight time LAX JFK HNL ANC Americans. 

The reason course due fact Australians proportionately affluent get older due better medical care, working conditions compulsory retirement savings plans, also longer mandated paid annual leave period 20 days plus additional paid sick leave). Quit constantly moving goal post every single time post. least stick nonsense spew.

"" telling people died nursing homes (which lot death counts), would still alive today? Nah, buy it.
Seasonal flu wreck havoc crowds. Nice try. going 6 months now, many people places terminal cases would survived either way.""

You painting narrative people would died year flu. said. cant say didnt. right you. 
Again way wrong.. pointed wrong. dancing around issue trying act like thats said. grandma moved got worse.... peoole worse, thus deaths. confused nursing home is. Fine. Let's take COVID equation.

Between February 1 July 24 (the recent week fairly complete data) US Deaths - Causes 115% Expected. 270,000 Americans died expected die last 6 months.

After we've accounted *expected* deaths (who ""were gonna die anyway""), account unexpected ones? seems like poison pill -- equipped replace denied tests offered US. little internal mass production capability, we're able ramp overnight gigantic responsibility dumped them. essentially set fail. failure cascaded tight restrictions placed allowed tested. parameters narrow predetermined unknown pathogen made whole thing seem rather suspicious. entire premise predicated assertion Wuhan, can't possibly mysterious virus knew little about. exponential growth potential losing month onset event pretty much guaranteed would worst equipped highest mortality country. evidence back first claim?

Also, primary reason study show cheap easy way test mask effectiveness. People believe 6% figure means covid-19 harmless even scared would mean 180,000 deaths (~94% 190,000 deaths) ""just happened""... even believe deaths happened all? issue affluent parents demanded schools re-open. Public schools gave option person online. strike, even parents chose online facing repercussions rich people’s demands. They’ve pushed back online instruction start Sept 21st. make one bit sense parents chose online learning kids punished demanded person learning. Yet another mechanistic study droplets. Yes, know masks reduce droplets, nobody sane mind argues study bring anything significantly new debate.

The problem evidence gathers virus spreads significantly aerosols, small stopped cloth surgical masks (generally anything tight seal). Moreover, still questions stopping droplets translates overall reduction transmission, virus still persists mask shed it.  Fat dudes stacked together single mask sight. America finest. uncertainty direct impact Covid-19 excess deaths certainly *extreme* uncertainty. know many people expected die year certain causes, know sort variance comes categories, know many people died year determine whether it’s within normal ranges it’s (spoiler, it’s within normal ranges affected countries).

This exactly tell fewer traffic accidents year. Though, every state US taking measures (of varying degrees) prevent Covid-19 transmission also lower transmission airborne respiratory infections. see deaths attributed flu pneumonia (spread similarly Covid thus prevented similarly) somehow FAR normal ranges time country taking measures ever prevent diseases, ask whether it’s possible deaths misattributed could Covid-19 related.

Many researchers done ask hypothetical questions, they’ve put test using rigorous statistical modelling evaluate hypothesis overwhelming favours global pandemic leading contributor. becomes increasingly evident look regions high cases low Covid-19 recorded deaths, somehow high excess deaths correlate closely areas similar infection rates.

I’ve yet see argument comes close explaining pneumonia flu deaths WAY seasonal levels time high preventative measures taken misattributing Covid-19 deaths. 

When mechanistic arguments, statistical analysis expert perspectives say think it’s likely one best remains mask, preferably n95+, face shield. Yep, I'm sure racists there. whole point I'm trying make becasue person certain race disciplined mean racist motive involved, disciplining person make racist.

I'm petty enough come back say ""I told so"", except colleagues actually doctors scientists like me, I'll make exception  Why? shitty child services live? go someones house find kid clearly valid reasons going school that's good know.

This entire comment must joke right? wrong like crafted wrong. This. comment says all. case, **every** business allowed re-open? wear masks social distance appropriately. Ok come guys, first OPs title misleading. Nowhere article mention Fauci said 190,000 people would still alive Covid.

Do really think would 0 nursing homes deaths year without Covid? never achieved disease without vaccine... saw article, sure healthcare worker administered only, test cheap, required machine process? monster read end. threaten us caravans invaders maybe finally get moat filled crocodiles (or alligators?)


Oh alligators snakes: cheaper friken sharks frikin lazer beams. Unless job goes someone who's owed favor powers desires favor future. literally appointing prolife judges supreme court I'm expert think fact trials need control group given placebo. exposing *them* virus trials definitely unethical.  Complete BS. Average age deaths close average US lifespan. “I said people, slow testing down, please.” - asshat charge know could do? could borrow plan many many countries got right. Seems like would work, huh? Since US one worst handful countries?  Insert Stalin quote etc etc families 190,000 Americans, start. That's sad. would tell move state strong unions, know always easy. 2019 school district went strike received 6% salary bump, smaller class sizes, hiring support staff, like nurses, librarians, mental health, etc. wish everyone could opportunity strike employer giving need job properly. case really worked favor.
EDIT: CA btw ""Abbott says begin manufacturing 50 million tests month October. tests cost $5 apiece."" sure rapid type test is, affordable. words John Oliver: ""Cool."" Seasonal flu **can** wreck havoc crowds.

I say DOES. I'm saying CAN. in, outbreak spread. reason much flu shots. great, COVID.

Point is, contagious respiratory disease disproportionally kills compromised. typically elderly folks.

Hospice basically ""get affairs order"" palliative care. People die far sooner nursing homes, everyone makes hospice (or afford it). die covid, die alone. EU needs reinstate border checkpoints (pre EU) traveler comes country n question send back. Also stop wasting time taking people's temp. effective, especially colder months approaching quick google search showed average teacher salary Canadian teachers $39,600 year average teacher salary United States $60,477 year. 

I used currency conversion tool calculate differences American canadian.

Canadian teachers making 30302.71 American annually average. 

Contrary wise... American teachers making 79058.56 Canadian annually average. 

I’m afraid $19 hour shit wage Canadian teacher. rest takes longer explain. Viruses don’t kill people; wreckage cause body actual cause death.

this true, distinguish SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19. latter cause death. That's gets ICD code. accurately, 6% death certificates showing Covid likely filled coroner didn’t autopsy results refer to.

I see evidence this. cause, vast majority death certificates filled doctors. 1) Wash hands warm water soap 
2) Social Distancing (if smell perfume get virus) 
3) Masks worked 1918 work today 
4) People died virus, unfortunately still die
5) shall pass (sooner start carrying one another) 

You malicious pervert five simple points. Ontario Canada though. Wearing masks universally allows normal commerce commence keep going. Oh my. seemed getting second wave control. You’re wrong. Though year research development vaccine modern age doesn’t necessarily mean it’s rushed, especially considering SARS-COV-2 (covid-19) mutation previous coronaviruses like SARS-COV-1, Oxford University done years research well way making vaccine for. 

It seems incredibly rushed consider much technological advancement exactly virus is. still amount testing, takes less time research manufacture used to. cmon really want compare us Peru?
a country high corruption index? 😂 Make mind. dying seasonal flu. grandma also live home YEARS. one saying people dont die. one insinuating flu always kills huge portion homes. thats lie. grandma grandma living years there. yeah, base feelings.

And said got worse moved.. Aka... hospice. Like said confused.   Iron bowl year higher case count wins guess lifetime bad. I'm 40s America. satisfied life switching thrive survive. worse first world countries?

Last thing remember caused major shift society AIDS/HIV 70s 80s. Put pretty damper fornication previous decade. following 2-3 generations lot prude reluctant engage sex late 90s earls 2000s. Wtf. college campus 30000 needs 200 cases shut  idea then.

But sorry tried offer idea y'all. guess I'll jump blind hatred wagon  phrases like would certainly alive today
 
**He** phrases way? headline Reddit post phrases way? headline post quote Fauci. measles outbreaks last year earthquakes fires.  article unconfirmed clickbait. It’s clear party. said governments. everyone involved government, governments whole. Even worst organizations, optimistic enough try improve inside, believe central mission (or part it) enough tolerate/ignore parts. 

I lot say outrageous cost education fact higher education hasn’t made accessible tie-ins military recruitment I’m drifting sleep sentences I’ll leave that. China's warnings late questionable trying cover whole thing up. today many dead infected. Deaths higher U.S. last monday. point still absolutely stands. can’t rush science. can’t rush long term studies. 

There studies done seeing adverse affects medication, gmos, dietary matters. 

Medication gets shuffled around time, anti depressants found help allergies nerve damage despite used 80s 90s depression. It’s one small example science needs time. boss. fire bad behavior. Please never work place ever again. People die direct result football game. really worth it? Pandemic over. serious. Move along. recurring dreams forgetting mask too. always dawns I’m already unsafe situation. hospital full sick people don’t know can’t find mask anywhere, really crowded store, ect. store worker got intercom politely asked customers please wait outside remove couple dead bodies found, would let us know could come back inside checkout. chipper polite - please thank you.

But it’s always, “Oh shit, let get situation mask??”

I wonder many people kinds recurring dreams. It’s interesting minds try process things. wish mine could without repeatedly scaring sh*t dreams though. Every country dodgy position, know can’t lockdown forever out. It’s sustainable. know sub really sucks New Zealand happens vaccine ? could could case, then? Lockdown every sighting? population sort immunity built up

Lockdowns killed UK economy I’m scared effects second lockdown virus. economy lot people’s money, it’s peoples well being.

The viable option they’re till end year nothing vaccine department comes then, reconsider Young people die too. cousin died ""pneumonia"" time, young, 20's, gay, knew ... mother acknowledge say words, even took care final months. Florida 3 NFL teams getting ready games fans less 2 weeks fucking flu 0.01% mortality rate!!!! fucking vaccine. seoul asian countries already pretty strong mask culture, guess didnt need ask people wear mask mandatory since already pretty much norm. religious cult spread again, decided something drastic it. mind I’m going post too. Also, young people die well:


The thing is, it’s less 1% taken precautions: lockdowns, closing nonessential business, working home, closed schools, wear mask, etc. that’s that. ignored “lived lives” idea would happen? I’ll tell you. many would become sick overrun hospitals. there’s enough medical supplies ventilators go around mass die offs happen. 100%

My area population roughly 400,000 people. want know many ICU beds have?!!?!?! 105. HUNDRED FIVE. look hospital info too. google it.

It’s attitudes outlook like going prolong this. also make virus die like damn near several countries took seriously. Everyone complains cost healthcare, nobody really asks fundamental questions why.

I suspect factual answer really desired. Hi. I'm gen z. peers seem ones actually give damn disaster. testing? interview promote book. also stomatologist, emergency icu doctor, put gastric balloons. time receive people digestive problems private paid consultation insurance, cash find information doctoralia gives appoinments. interview uploaded video YouTube continued strategy, promoting book first launching conspiracy messages make go viral. Actually marketing campaign quite good, attacking target audience. fiancee diabetic says pays $5/month insulin. What's ? patients coronavirus treated dihydrogen-monoxide. may cure virus definitely help. thing is, it’s less 1% taken precautions: lockdowns, closing nonessential business, working home, closed schools, wear mask, etc. that’s that. ignored “lived lives” idea would happen? I’ll tell you. many would become sick overrun hospitals. there’s enough medical supplies ventilators go around mass die offs happen. 100% 

My area population roughly 400,000 people. want know many ICU beds have?!!?!?! 105. HUNDRED FIVE. look hospital info too. google it.

It’s attitudes outlook like going prolong this. also make virus die like damn near several countries took seriously. like language

It's weird many Americans seem think that's actual problem, people learn languages go overseas lol Yep capitalism running muck. 

American Values Rankings:

1. Power

2. Money

3. People new study, published August 28 website medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, conducted Roberta L. DeBiasi Meghan Delaney, analyzed data 91 children 22 hospitals across South Korea. ""Unlike US health system, test positive COVID-19 South Korea remain hospital completely recovered infection,"" says DeBiasi.
According study, roughly 22% children developed symptoms throughout infection, 20% began asymptomatic later developed symptoms, 58% tested symptomatic. study also showed great differences length time children remained symptomatic, ranging three days three weeks. One-fifth asymptomatic patients roughly half symptomatic patients still passing SARS-CoV-2 virus three weeks initial infection — though **this directly reflect contagiousness.”** “

Wait, contagious? not? long? Isn’t way test that?? file bankruptcy. states nice homestead exceptions keep home. Money retirement accounts also protected. 7 year black mark credit already home really need credit. someone coughs directly onto purpose, sneezes, spits, that's assault. considered assault since long pandemic. 

So... Punching somebody coughs *is* self defense. viable solution? Keeping everything open wiping elderly, disabled odd random healthy individual, whilst creating long-term unknown regards future complications virus potentially cause even asymptomatic people?

Please, circumstance right now, without vaccine yet available, viable option?

Face facts. NZ demolished rest Western world response. Politics ""economy"" get way. vaccine available, NZ probability eradicating virus getting living, whilst rest world continue struggle. That's said though. People might take say seriously try accurate use cited direct quotes.

But would weaken argument. insane. overall testing/contact tracing there? Thx information. WTF, Poland? That's attitude: kicking universe mostly creates ultimate craftmanship. Good point. Seattle one first outbreaks coronavirus US all. initial outbreak contained (at least American standards) Seattle. American here. sick days vacation days combined, 3 weeks total. I'm sick hope near weekend take 1 2 days sleep weekend. take vacations December depending much I've gotten sick earlier year. competitive field there's always hungry new grads willing take job. page 15, still cute raccoon.

...I hate you. goes Christmas Back March, friend called “negative” said could possibly still dealing virus September. much longer shot people seem appreciate.

For sober take adenoviral vectors, Oxford vaccine's using, far, decades trying, using adenoviral vectors yielded *no* effective human vaccines one commercially-available vaccine animals (a rabies vaccine raccoons). someone infected cough guy? Fake news, part plot sell masks, medical condition. 

Every Karen there. [Nothing see Move along, folks. Everything looking good. I'M TRAPPED YOU, TRAPPED Murica!!!  Boris actually got damn virus changed tune pretty quickly afterwards. News one one read ""Mongolian Country bars""? fuck that? CDC released new statistics reporting less 9k actually died virus....

Edit: Wow, everyone super impressed edgy guy can’t stand near windows probably hoist “mission accomplished” banner. photo op always ages like fine wine, guaranteed. Tell Tanzanian president But... But.. CCP... Tibet... Freedom... Fuck... actual data support assertion though. misrepresenting it. think we've moved well past early signs. I’m sorry can’t handle truth. That's exactly we're trying do. thank GOD terrible times we're living, least telecommunications advanced are. 

Thank blessing, recieve open heart also ask GOD blesses loved ones always ways❣🙏 older brother sent 'statistic' today. Letting know I've bamboozled media start coming parties. doesnt wear mask, know thousands people, one knows it. picking fight saying misses me. cried got phone. Agreed! perfectly healthy got covid complications led developing ARDS death certificate listed ARDS cause death covid contributing factor would included 94%. CDC table lists second cause. want know percent underlying health issues could subtract things known caused covid (pneumonia ARDS) make guess % due covid percent due underlying health conditions heart attack stroke add others obviously preexisting conditions (diabetes obesity hypertension) get better estimate percent preexisting conditions data want. Shoutout diabetics traveled either country insulin. Hope OK. Sincerely, diabetic Surprise pikachu face ""intended cause death serious bodily harm civilians non-combatants purpose intimidating population compelling government international organization to abstain act""

I mean sound like military no? I'd delete this. looks petty sad. modernized dictionary definitions useless confusing everyone.

Variolation used Vaccina (Cow Pox) everything followed called another Vaccina / vaccine.

Variolation word ""Vaccina"" changed word disease (Cow Pox) word cure. claim word ""vaccine"" modern vaccines do.

variolation === vaccine Even DSA crammed social democrats.  Surely least one act terrorism acquire label.. We're butchering English language point. Hard charge someone Russia... Murican No.1\~   commenting said eye surface transmission significant.

I also think study still useful. confirmation masks work. worn properly anyway. Idk everyone excited elect businessman president (even got good one). many people never laid job told enterprise would better without them? model want apply nation? areas reporting backlogs still uncounted

Better get use hearing line lot near future. new news? Easier said done, food quickly goes bad useless long aren’t trucks transport it. strategy start really. Sounds like brought guy board validate always wanted get go - nothing. use position power using tactics control entire country, definitely help look like Hitler's Nazi regime. That's second time instructed leave, kind authority.

Given politics commenting history, quite easy make case one spread misinformation. proselytization effort seems something put lot work into, seems service entity history sure judge harshly.

I mean, least state politics front commenting here. Shocking. Thx update. mixture Americans freedom, actually. It’s everything previous two intelligent humans noted. one add, though, sure maybe fools attend game aren’t afraid. Good them. also shame concern fellow human beings. say bc become carriers asymptomatic, odds spreading unwilling participant compromised immune system high. immunocompromised person could die bc fan went game bc arent afraid. That’s problem Yeah gonna say, verse two mentions covering come contact someone plague sort?  Lol guy went covid party last words going onto ventilator ""i think made mistake""


He died. Then, u allowed mention ""The fact China run atrocious, tyrannical government"", exactly whataboutism u eagerly trying avoid, yet cannot mention ""america's warring past"". dual standards? u perhaps, mixing ur preference politics allowed influence ur judgement health issue? Lol lol lol lol Lol lol lol lol lolLol lol lol lol lol lmao dumbass Stupid stupids does. Funny many downvote comments china here. Corona virus originated wuhan china. Even sub's description mentions that. college, it’s shitshow Never say never... How’s Xi Jinping’s asscheeks taste like? might leading organization? well case point

had call early ER cuz BP shot 117/110....hard talk someone number chest burning

I guess shall see expendable tomorrow call follow Doctor bullshit.I might even caught Covid trip too! Wonderful.... What's ""ANTIFA""? can't find hard data organization.

Do names leaders, know HQ'd of? might make research easier.

Right seems like exist organizational level. woman legend. Shortly born Spanish flu India badly affected. May soul rest peace ! studies what's corona virus death rate?  I'm curious Biden wins, he'll balls declassify suppression coverup summer 2019 March 2020.

On one hand, crime committed Trump Biden would moral obligation disclose it, hand, would negative implication US foreign relations amount apology Biden would ever recover damage. I'm sure shit happens I've emergency room canada triage process seemed pretty sensible. People stuff literally kill always go front line, people could wait hours wait hours. show something non-life-threatening hospital unusual load going wait. Overall tradeoff seems worth it, canadians still live longer paying far less, healthcare tied employment life general far less stressful.

I'm US work \*still\* wait overnight hospital something ended taking like 20 minutes end. Canadian problem. Shut fuck kid, one cares say. means house die, heirs. That's real point. get whatever might've left behind. kids get fucked. Funny turn logic sudden longer agree Iowa upper midwest states turn now. Eventually bug find get matter hard people try hide.  
Even countries try lock turn eventually stay way vaccine comes. 

Meanwhile, check numbers former ""hot spot"" states. CA/TX/FL/GA/AZ HUGE declines occurring naturally across board without new interventions lock downs. fraction deaths NY/ NJ experienced. 

Sooner later, virus find Liam Neeson style. Hope best does. Looks like they've found monkeys. Iowa shit show recently governor, Kim Reynolds, mandating masks forcing schools person. spiked new high record 2,000+ cases last week (around time schools reopened) keeps getting worse. Huh? weird. No, well known preciseness real life. bit frustrating. matter small error was. Ha, *blanket* statement  How's Adrian Zenz's asscheeks taste like? Please tell bipartisan committee? point spreading word only/mostly Democrats. Well, probably since said actually true. Easter saw guy going around multiple channels youtube today claiming 9000-odd deaths virus US. Dumbass. private option? Brazil, there's both. private, pay fixed amount get everything done (not plastic surgery procedures) usually, company work pays you, come paycheck. public usually good cold want something fast, otherwise going put waiting list, still worth pay anything. case emergency always get surgery done early. think long run, there's public health, decrease costs public health making ppl go doctor often, get checked costs surgery expensive part would probably avoided. work service industry, started wearing mask work everyday March initial shutdown happened state. Still got July even washing hands every free minute state mandated face coverings customers talking servers/ bartenders. sent home slight cough pretty weak day before. know close proximity coworkers weak coughing. person got covid masks time. Victorian lockdown could better imo sarcasm, mate surprising, especially droplet/airborne seen spectrum rather completely distinct routes transmission. think new Zealand beat anything. Mexico’s borders open Americans. 
Source: live near border. scrolled much stuff sounds like 5 months old news. comes China bots voting down. Damn end. Holy... Fair enough. probably right, statistic encourages responsible behavior without reading. people finally know like autistic/on spectrum?  wait hear spitting Yeah. People dumb. Can't believe know obesity heart failure diabetes result Covid. Morons.  mean? covid positive would added marginally inconvenienced while.
 
So, basically impossible US. Oh wow, wonder making information go cdc becoming public best plan. Like maybe inevitably going lead conspiracy theories?

No? Okay then! sounds like concern actually manufacturing vaccine candidate advance posibility FDA might approve ineffective/dangerous vaccine, yeah? 

The solution _not_ approve ineffective/dangerous vaccine. Anecdotes certainly aren’t gold standard they’re without value. add anecdotes, sister 17 literally world class athlete. tested positive asymptomatic TIA shortly diagnosis. mom’s also nurse noted Covid patients blood tends little thicker normal. 

I’m also interested seeing pervasive is. Hopefully complications fringe cases unknown makes thing worrisome. course little germ factories  like wait release studies school opens.

Whatever gets grant money, right? refugees allowed EU, rape went substantially. completely halal though. Fuck hope co-workers right.  sure would expect things go back normal South Korea US general election tho mean that’s fantastic idea all, sounds like would actually *help* working class folks, know that’s roundabout soshulizm bad /s I’m getting tired trying explain people. super right wing conspiracy theory family took running days. can’t even begin argue it. intelligence like that, could work Trump administration! Well, duh. would thought that? gonna bother read article. cannot safely indoors around others without everyone masked. office, need know intimate details ventilation system mask necessary. Now, cover vent ducts HEPA furnace filters, okay office/room. safest approach, works best, everyone mask indoors. Ironically, people quoted article misunderstood too.  Everyone jumps straight talking many Americans pre-existing conditions, that's true, important point Lessler says bottom half article:  First, COVID-19 causes many co-morbidities mentioned, respiratory conditions. So, having, example, respiratory failure death certificate addition COVID-19 really another cause death, coronavirus infection almost certainly caused respiratory failure. 

Co-morbid mean pre-existing. virus causes heart stop, heart failure co-existing cause death virus. causes lungs longer function, lung failure co-existing cause. Etc. etc. get it. know mask protect others data clear protecting wearer...so going inconvenienced others gain. want bad Healthcare,, selves people trying say kids cant spread virus get back schools load vaccine tranquilizer darts shoot antivaxxers ass rest world working tests, fair Temporary loss control vehicle counts comorbidity. navigated late-night Israeli mini-bus system people speak language write notes me. sign said ""Take central station"" drivers would either shake heads wave bus. found someone central station able translate immediately (from Russian, suspect could found English speaker bit effort) get right bus. gave driver $10 (they even gave change!) got saw stop Google maps. super friendly seem care lack language skills. I'd willing pay taxi (my backup plan), central call line 4 language options including English.

Honestly, get phone signal willing pay roaming (it's $10/day plan now), feel almost never problem, especially dietary restrictions. (I eat pork US. expect succeed outside US although usually try learn words ""vegetarian"" ""please"". also carry Benadryl mild allergies.) Museums tourist attractions always translations, many food places pictures (and not, it'll adventure!), Google usually pretty accurate navigation. smile observe people doing, follow rules, usually need lot words outside situations anyway. Oh sorry, IDGAF questions argument nonsense. 

“hOww u PaY tHeM?”

...he asks government going broke paying unemployment stimulus entire country

😂 😂 😂 promise death toll higher that, government suppressing numbers.

separately, Hospitals country reaching capacity. means deaths sources start rise. expect late 2020 flu, traffic collision, accidental death counts American history. Let's open get virus ASAP can't stop it. Back normal OP's case, absolutely applicable. $100,000 bills come uncovered procedures, typically emergencies can't sure every physician in-network, insurance company says, ""fuck you, pay all, bill you.""

For planned procedure, never happen. check company beforehand make sure covered. never position say, ""oh $500k procedure, 20% co-insurance gonna $100k."" select plans that, prominent would medicare without supplemental medicare advantage. rest niche plans.

OP likely uninsured. He/she could getting procedure covered, would rare truly medically necessary. ""dead virus"" plain viral RNA without ability replicate float around body month? Where's originating from, non-viable viral junk, where's stored body month able shed continuously? kid 80s still lot propaganda Russia/Communism equals bad. media tighter grip controlling people thought things back then. thoughts probably still linger lot people.  agreed delay extra 2 weeks. presumably prepare, feeling want see rest schools NY major outbreaks.  quantity people, caliber politician. exclude people would died eventually anyway.

So death rate 0. Cancer drugs, known non-damaging generally restorative effect human body... America good health care system. No. I'm saying deactivated virus largely irrelevant modern vaccine technology, contamination production nothing human trials. way test quality control production production begins. 100%  Well shit. That’s kids school district decided herd immunity (without knowing actually achieve herd immunity) new goal. don’t give fuck million die 20 million+ end organ damage Could sworn all.doors building welded? making one entry exit easily control people exit enter. Bad for.firehazard though. did, imagine someone balance checkbook (if giant cooperation multiple transactions) month clue give back you, playing catch still making new transactions. (Best scenario give) reduced mobility 68 percent. National avg 65 percent.



How exactly get 68 percent Florida 65 percent us?

Were comparing car data peak decline single point?

You continue make sweeping claims really vague use sources.

I’m moving new vague claims iffy sourcing. Yeah I’ve waiting mansion open up. extended family want visit bad, hate masks too. officials say [775 1.04% student population, 28 staff members, 0.2% staff members, reported testing positive COVID-19.

That's remarkably few. Anyone half brain knew asymptomatic transmission tiny risk, people hyped months.

Anyone half brain knows people complaining tiredness brain fog anxiety/hypochondria, it'll demonstrated soon enough also. exact reaction, don’t live anymore it’s baby brother’s school district 🤦‍♀️ Dude families pnw city going hungry facing eviction mostly service industry governor allow reopen, devastating many immunocompromised. ::looks population growth history::

Nope. assisted campus utter tools Real question - stand gain condescending towards people take pandemic seriously? That's quite superiority complex have. 9 THOUSAND dead children basically nothing? Tell parents 9000 children, nothing them. heartless selfish HOPE never experience losing child. infected individuals much less likely transmit virus develop symptoms

wow, people cough less likely spread virus? knew?

Everybody stay safe listen guy, put lives risk yet somehow remain 5th largest economy world, people like hate lol immaculate labor laws difficult extort populace claiming 'bastion democracy' 

Cough *Prison-Industrial complex*

But yeah, money bad Nice mouth. power persuasion? educated debate? Pointless name calling?

One child tests positive serious symptoms lose left mind. Per article - ""*there close contacts means need concern""* want horrific, you? That's sub - one big afraid shadow circle jerk. moved countries beginning year, grew went school CCISD entire life. school particular can’t imagine running without mandatory screenings decreased class sizes. It’s large school, always issues overcrowding make even worse it’s like elementary schoolers isolated since it’s one big campus 3 school levels. Even young children don’t get severely, campus elementary high schoolers close proximity means could easily spread they’d serious case.  also look yourself

Right, far I'm concerned, want good PPE. N95s KN95s me.

Because buy fully logic, seem physically impossible kind properly-worn mask afford wearer protection well. Extending logic, better barrier better job?

I still participate cutesy office mask photo contests. put multicolored cloth mask, put surgical one dog, take photo, win contest. disappoint everybody days I'm WFH wear super-boring KN95 office. literally English language works, yes. pay attention happened nursing homes last 7 months so? Exactly! problem using excess death complex, uncertainty extreme. unkonwn top unknown top unknown. Locking people reasonable answer truancy
 disaster American social policy perfectly captured Harris's story mother threatened prosecution helping social services. That's American way: little help offer poor people comes threat prison. Mr. de Blasio's judgment suspect. foolhardy open schools January 2021 possibly September 2021. indecision instability fucks people’s lives. chaos summer, clear agree online learning 2021. Thank god district made decision. running I’d say day 2, it’s success, know for. prepared mentally, make best situation result...  close 230 cases so. Neat.

To put context, approximately 100 cases per day Ontario last weeks. Ontario's population 15 million.

So, want twice many positive test results province 15 million building 2100 people think there's problem. heterodox shop lists Charles Koch Institute CATO Institute ""like-minded"" organizations lol. Looks like suckered someone believing junk. Btw, heterodox shops freak shows modern day economics academia. Thanks. I’m trying confirm countries also count multiple ailment deaths dismiss claims countries lower numbers bc enough backlog ""govenor""? Can’t wait see Fauci’s helpful clarification “6% meme” go viral Facebook feed. Yep. minute now... right. mother spent last years life special memory care locked ward. horrific see there, cannot imagine much worse would ***couldn’t*** see there.😣

I guess don’t staffing let go outside visit loved ones. 

Pretty sure mother wits choose, she’d chosen see visitors even wound killing her. would way Covid-19 make choice without impacting others might get sick did.

Damn pandemics. mainstream articles right 90% tests false positive virus pose threat anyone. 

Is really news worthy simple really.  


Remove covid. still die?  


It's also possible they're related.  


Extreme example, consider guy diabetes gets hit bus dies. really want diabetes death cert one? What? middle road injecting insulin? Even remove diabetes equation, they'd likely still die. remove bus equation, life carries on. affects Glasgow 2 smaller neighbouring areas, cases concentrated. None 32 London boroughs enough positive cases recently (per 100,000 population) form local lockdown, although number places have, mainly North West England. Within London, Hackney Kensington &amp; Chelsea currently slightly higher case rates, although varies daily. unimportant distinction, remove covid still alive covid still cause death. Minor surgery like hernia wisdom teeth riskier obese individuals co morbidities die surgery table surgery caused death. Legit everyone know calls crazy person thinking covid real. need new friends. daughter made 3 days kid tested positive class. many would still alive US competent leader White House? real malicious intent

I'd argue absolutely is, aligned Putin decades extreme narcissism combined caring optics reality.

Which he's allied Putin. wants ""solution"" coronavirus time election, ""solution"" mean wants something use deflect criticism. 

Right, actually want solution all. he'd spending government money said solution instead rescinding funding. he's done pick worst possible option every turn regards Corona. knows hoax, knows inaction killed hundreds thousands Americans. care thinks Democrat lyin' Joe Biden stop talking Coronavirus, never says word new FDA Approved* vaccine** I've already started shipping***.""

Again though, deflection ***for purpose.*** know appears like Trump care literally anything himself, done many things make look like complete idiot, weakening USA. ***It's weakening USA bit point.*** Trump narcissist, there's question that, he's ***Russian Asset*** first foremost even narcissism. FDA effective Republican states

Know 3 points look like anyone outside USA? declaration war citizens USA. Something Russia definitely wants come makes Donald Trump look good, needs happen. makes Donald Trump look bad, needs die. guy epitome style substance.

He is, he's also absolutely controlled direct things way they're directed. explanation Trump flipping missed call Putin? He's 100% Russian Asset, even honestly believe he's convenient idiot Russians, think he's fully involved like Oligarchs Russia. can't comprehend there's decent chance American People put death ever gets chance enjoy ""wealth"" earned destroying US top seat country. y'all delusional. can't tell straight face 180k COVID deaths ones seasonal flu also take out.

Using ""180k deaths"" doom gloom continue paralyzing economy whatever else society equally disingenuous.

99.5% average age decent health people get COVID die it. want tell ""muh lasting complications"", show stats that. saying happen, concept.

People pissed ""they think hoax,"" they're angry feel response over-dramatic basic lethality disease people society. ""The fear something usually greater actual thing itself.""

It's like saying ""we're closing places near coconut trees there's 0.05% chance one fall head kill you."" live alone? little affects may well immune. Like Florida even cares fast testing hate 95%+ articles like one include link even information would lead actual study. job gives flu shots free exact reason. thousands customer facing employees, even people crammed big buildings (top 10 banks), flu going around catastrophic. think smart. bad Russian bot, bad. N E  K heard last recording? imagine unrestrained Trump townhall would like. Except Jim Jones charismatic progressive time relation civil rights seeing black ppl equals. (Before lost marbles) since liberty Christian rather American value? i'm really tired conflation two. extension said...

The excess deaths default directly covid infections, still attributed global implications pandemic overall. deaths resulting people afraid go hospital would likely still died hospitals got overrun result implementing pandemic mitigation measures. consistent science-backed public health messaging could positively helped. People afraid going hospital urgent care. Similarly excess deaths attributable stress depression dont magically go away taken measures lot people would sick. lot suffering due pandemic guarenteed (sunk cost) matter response goal minimize that. Fear mongering... biggest news covid point *PEOPLE CAUGHT COVID*
 
The people interested interested furthering public fear virus. People staggeringly stupid... reason test take 12 days get results.

It's test anymore then. much time results void. Either results positive spreading almost 2 weeks. results negative may picked sometime last 2 weeks.

If can't get MINIMUM 48 hours turnaround tests, useless.  never shut Florida he? left counties iirc. memory could though... it’s long apocalypse... know math people would agree he’s saying, actual operation 2+2 depends something called Pareto axioms.

Sure, putting “2” objects together “2” objects results “4” objects, abstract statement natural number 2 added natural number 2 equal 4 depends couple assumptions (axioms) results those.

The first chapter Terrence tao’s analysis 1 book covers pretty well. experience, lab scientists used thinking fly forget follow stringent manufacturing practices, simply they're used many procedures follow.

This can't overstated. GMP something jump into, mindset. 

I'm pharmaceutical development, 20+ years. I've worked career R&amp;D, spent year GMP back. I'm good scientist. successful R&amp;D career, floundered GMP. get head right place it. 

I'm used learning last round work improve next experiment, second nature...I'm always looking change procedures streamline work, things better. That's great R&amp;D, making something going go *inside human being*, room that. matter show found better way easier way, got validated way. Interesting see exactly 18%. Maybe know something restaurants increments 25% up. Maybe that's magic number reasonably safe? Yeah that, south korea pays north Koreans large amounts money make grandiose stories North Korea. Youtube ""the loyal citizens Pyongyang"". tell case count screwy 6.8% mortality rate Well, opened window single wasp flew in. time right noon. bothered close window, why? lone wasp. 

The hive outside eaves next window mean damn thing. Let's leave hamburger sill shits giggles. would forgiving either.

Intentionally getting othe people sick convenience unacceptable.  expect general public research, like did, 15 minutes find facts.

1. Cloth masks nothing vs aerosolized vectors
2. Cloth masks help protect others droplet spread
3. Surgical masks 70% effective vs aerosolized spread
4. N95s 99% effective vs aerosolized spread
5. Reserve surgical &amp; n95 masks healthcare + essential workers march-june

I never even knew surgeon general warnings advisement mask controversy started people pointed previous statements.

So know, hard someone 15 minutes credible research learn facts, maybe deserve place society. agree saying that. soon one kid gets symptom even gotten test county district, shut everything down. Kids going 2 half days week is. rest week half day home. Unless chose virtual only. might uncomfortable hear lot people. lot PCR tests really high threshold like 40. Testing positive doesn’t mean you’re infectious shedding virus. takes quite viral load become infectious affect people. eventually going amount viral particles, tests still end positive. increase cases alarming , it’s much nuanced wish clarity data Yeah same. stress levels near enough non existent. want go back, yes short term might shit I'm buying 700 billion pound loses whatever is. economy by-product spend £7 day pret ffs. time change hope stick it. missing school still get high grades rewarded.

People want able see loved ones, loved ones end life, year two ""wait"". effectively choosing everyone's loved ones. choosing people might wanted prevent family member dying gruesome way. that's terrible get option.

I'm sure even blame CDC one. actually clear basic understanding death certs work, doubt cdc going make video stats page.  Cause worked well first time... sick leave vacation leave

I think I'm getting sick reading this. Wtf

Thanks response, makes sense wfh situations sometimes  judging weight bikers show sturgis entire state takes lean towards Sturgis 10 days. :-) think so! that'd require actual trust employees lol! Though knows it'll like COVID shown majority job WFH issue. I'm surprised they're jumping thought able rent smaller space.  Absolutely. Nowhere say previous poster (or his/her kids) forced attend school. obviously need prioritize remote options.

All said previous poster telling people kids even scientists saying risks minimal kids 6 many cases (especially less privileged kids) developmental consequences staying home (and occupational havoc wreak parents) going far outweigh risks starting back. want rebuttal, suspected. want trash left leaning people Remote learning. better. Agreed. Also Ontario. Tested Saturday, results Sunday night. You’re back looking deaths percentage cases, like Trump wants too.

Jonestown deaths: 909
Americans Dead Covid: 140,000 Yeah, son’s school said close hit 100 year. Students narc classmates shit. went back started looking exactly discrepancy - updated dashboard yesterday reflect new calculations, actual numbers/100,000 actually match division. looked happening - San Diego includes prison stats population - they've decided subtract numbers calculate per/100,000 stat. 

So ""Purple"" include prisoners, ""Red"" subtract them. China isnt lol simply illustration quickly odds fall intuition gets wrong. expect everyone gets infected large gathers would say exactly saying now.

At 70 people probably still coin toss. 1% county shedding presymptomatic low symptoms 50/50 chance someone group shedding virus. needed one February. wastewater testing cornerstone it. one crack addict? Btw thumbnail caption clarifies photo March. Trump suddenly let competent professional back fold. already pass ny? Yeah, really can't imagine leisure travel making comeback point. teh f? kid went get tested Saturday. bad allergies congestion. Per public health rules runny nose could go daycare. got tested 10AM Saturday results Sunday night. Well I'm President, basics start:

Not stubbornly wait 4-5 months wear mask publicly. Leadership example.

Not continually downplay it.

Not stop talking public pressers told people inject bleach everyone made fun it

Not continually accuse countries good response lying, fact country caught misrepresenting data multiple times

Not throw unproven medicine recommendations, suggest people speak medical professional area treatment and/or prevention advice

This; leader come tell everyone Fauci said, attempt go unite everyone? US still 7 day trend right one worst death rates world. leader help message helps people?



That's top head. I'm sure others add Mine starting senior year. graduate. kids going get sick colds flu well -- every one going benched in-person schooling two weeks (minimum). Nice job Texas username checks  nuts. feel like WFH allow situations mentioned. go whole life without hearing Sturgis

Uh huh. reporting numbers based data Florida providing before. wrong before, averages. Exactly, absolutely, positively, **NOTHING** going prevent deaths barring safe, effective vaccine. mean it’s pretty stupid keep getting told exercise stay healthy gyms aren’t open He's finding cut testing sites. mean... things prevent kids can't afford take care them, worse can't bothered take care them. putting burden society fix someone takes responsibility? 

I'm universal healthcare I'm state paid daycare. sex, use protection, live choices. Well one person, first confirmation reinfection lol sorry rain parade buddy, vaccine ain't gonna save you. Yea ridiculous. mean Covid could simmer things may go back normal election finally leader knows manage crisis. double whammy case proper mitigation see countries manged Biden wins takes right precautions see less cases things going back normal hopefully some, pretty shocking many people I've seen news interviews actually doubt existence virus. age death 78 years expectancy US 78.6 years old.  Ah shit, forgot lol mean still sensationalist language right (I'm native speaker) ""rapid rise"", ""surged"". 

The key part article seems Fewer cases France requiring hospitalization spring, mortality nowhere near spring peak. recent reports April? There's 25 million registered Covid-19 cases worldwide, likely top iceberg considering asymptomatic cases never get tested. 25, 250, 2500 even 25,000 cases develop strokes whatever nothing insignificant dot global statistics. I'd take chances Covid-19 time. free please. Here's song (not rick roll) We're comparing US Peru ignoring everything fact claimed something defined loosely ""lockdown""?  ancient Portuguese guy stopped talk dog died: how’s Google / Apple going know gets Covid spent time commiserating offering condolences? 

We’re dog-walking acquaintances; although we’ve known eight years, doesn’t even know first name, let alone last. absolutely cell phone, I’m sure. CDC said 94% COVID deaths comorbidities, prior health conditions etc

""Some"" taken mean, reason, 6% 190k number actual COVID deaths, rest fake stats by...well knows place blaming days. accurate say 6% covid deaths essentially people dropped dead, usual causes? That's terrifying. get pneumonia, heart issues, clotting, still body shuts you? find hard believe could withstand 0-6. can, it’s actually kind sad. guys got lucky dantonio stupid loyal, would also 1 win MSU too. fault parents ultimately terrible sick day / WFH policies? week. Big deal. Mr. de Blasio irresponsible. know motives are. matter. Stupid stupid. full shit horrible person. is. it’s reported Worldmeter, media, Florida’s DOH, without historical data dumb, number new cases would 3773. Stuff like happens, it’s always best check rolling averages. Based metric? deaths per millions. That's South America, Italy, UK, Spain.

And look death increase per day -- low. Actually [zero deaths last 7 I'd rather take quick fast approach months bullshit. Landlords probably get jobs contribute society instead. anyone capability definitely India point hard, sure. question posed nature, government.

The pain experience affect length pandemic. see lot people talking difficult is, possibly affect reality. 

They usually clandestine anti-mitigation astroturfing campaigns. say ""it's painful,"" really mean *""we stop trying mitigate virus go back normal.""* Donald Trump get tested ""multiple times day""? Time good enough, need paid sick leave. 180k actually happened Sept 1. bought enough toilet paper late 80s (when right wing talk radio took off), entire professions profited stoking irrational partisanship. 

Yes, corporate lobbyists lied, knew full shit smoking lead gasoline. smaller evangelical movement hated schools taught current science, widely viewed kooks.

Really talk radio Fox online wingnut echo chambers see huge disinformation *industry*, sane voices drowned screaming people give slightest shit truth. Depends viewpoints are. tow line Republican party. I'm moderate conservative believes lower taxes, less spending, cracking welfare fraud illegal immigration, getting rid identity politics.

But I'm also firm believer climate change pro choice, even though I'm Christian.

Just side ideology mean lock-and-step viewpoints. source claim ""Vitamin nothing immune system"".

I'm making claim, don't. would evidence something never said?

I never said unicorns existed either, see getting mad providing evidence added nothing conversation.

I'm pointing irony came defense someone ignoring science, used science justify it. called observational humor. probably start Governor Cuomo officials housed Covid patients nursing homes, leading thousands deaths. ""No side effects"" ass. There's always something. Plenty get minor soreness/pain injection site. people get fever even, immune system thinking there's infection fight. pretty much can't zero side effects. **serious** side effects, goal vaccine. clearly idea talking about. Yeah, coronavirus thing Miami dance clubs strip joints doubt. That's death talking could get ethically morally wrong subject others potentially deadly virus stubbornness nonchalancy, won't, sure understand already others also explained comments.

What get however pointing focus death rate flawed. disease, like diseases, coin toss. either life death. large scale starts asymptomatic goes mild, mild, severe severe symptoms ends death coronavirus. 

While true chances death severe case COVID19 higher people contributing conditions higher age, mean disease knock months severely impact quality life good. severe case means double sided inflammation lungs, wich hinder lung capacity forever. likely never fully recover severe case. means even though virus kill outright, ability sports, dance, go stairs damaged completely gone. even mean shorter, much less enjoyable life anybody.

So do? try minimize chances transmitting disease others minimize chances getting severe infection. Almost kind mask fit first goal although cloth masks stop infection (but N95/KN95/FFP2 will!), reduce initial viral load inhale, get infected. initial viral load LOT severity resulting disease (see: article), wear even makeshift cloth mask, mean difference life death. also mean difference coughing day two fine longlasting lung disease make life lot less fun live.

Mask wearing also decrease vitamin production significant way, affect blood oxygen levels make inhale CO2, passes mask, like O2 breath in. antimaxx claims unscientific coming cohort non-intellectuals think know better lifetime medical professionals researchers. listen idea talking about.

And yes, know sucks wear mask, it, need go back quarantine, able keep virus check safe tried(!) vaccine pops up! suck up, tough now, worth end, tell kids much hated wearing ugly, uncomfortable pieces clothing defended lives, family's lives economy. Literally Hitler Nazis guideline effective propaganda

Sound familiar? Yeah, seems obvious asymptomatic transmission. want eradicate it, test known contacts people positive.

If care bringing new case numbers, yeah, restrict testing symptomatic patients. moved america thinking advanced country earth. regret? No. disappointed? Abso-fucking-lutely. Might dead bodies piling up. Tons people do, especially get scripts way cheaper, like lol?? It’s pretending it’s real first place. ^^^^^/s Yeah, it’s pretty amazing fucking stupid people country.  mean, cmon folks.  simple understanding statistics actually reading table fifth grader could comprehend enough understand saying. literally explaining conservative parents yesterday. dad countered with, ""Or maybe masks trap virus breathe more."" honestly even know say. people brainwashed ignore sound science spout crazy theories. Like, consider fact doctors nurses wearing face masks around sick/contagious patients decades now? somehow dropped dead yet. I'm going give mom dad tough. Today August 31, 2020. 187,000 dead. month early. Ugh. Ugh.

We even get that. shitty parts China none good parts.  American exceptionalism strikes again! USA! USA! USA! 1 covidiocy! Crazy skip re- part anyways.

With 616,629 documented infections there's still 20 million Floridians go. almost impossible Mexico cases, US 3 times population Mexico definitely connected countries Mexico. Feasible truncate normal process, always plan. normal process normal reason! sure getting downvoted. have. Thats going happen, rolling lockdowns mask mandates aren’t practical won’t followed. gonna like seasonal flu point. Americans best health care world best health care system. 

Enjoy America, enjoy... Good point! sign posts used less frequent. think I’ll try since I’ve plenty dreams like already. thing say one peer reviews points exact error handling data did. 

If took Covid it, interpretation data would still questionable. That's whole lot ""if"". Hahahaha! many years biden take replace them? gets replace first place. Men? DEVO Whole caravans people ignore say ""only like 5 confirmed cases"". 6 million confirmed infections US. People social distancing. many would exposed twice officially diagnosed times.

I honestly get mentality here. viruses produce long protective immunity. Many viruses kind make sick months later. There's vaccine SARS common cold. hard people accept? duh I’ve never thought this... AMA people tried would interesting. understand many people virus genetically sequenced?

You claiming lack testing reinfection means lack happening. sound like president. Yep, engaged fb discussion this. brain cells died whole happened. Agreed. concern animal studies large enough sample sizes? Fucking idiots There's guarantee Victorians Christmas dinner anyone. would take minor outbreak cancel Christmas states. Go fuckin figure Yeah! let science stuff sway you! I'm sure way smarter experts who've devoted years lives studying particular fields... Well, population density also plays role spread. netherlands one densily populated countries world. course effect spreading ilness.

 Also registration might better worse (for example belgium registers 'suspicious' deaths covid, countries conformed cases).

Not saying netherlands great anything pointing deaths per capita cherry picking. means headline making claim well founded.

I huge problem headline based overall evidence provided. look study, link severity influenza infection (based symptoms experienced) amount initial infected tissue participants inhaled. Since masks (ideally) reduce viral load would breathe in, think huge leap say masks potential reduce severity illnesses similar flu. Bad bot, bad... Remember time vaccine going ready September... Yeah, nobody dies covid medically speaking.  Covid causes patients go cardiac arrest ARDS ultimately kills you.  table says 6% patients covid listed cause death, that’s basically cases person recording death doesn’t know outcomes killed them, it’s presumed covid. could simple recording error, maybe person enter data didn’t additional information needed record ARDS cardiac arrest.  table ultimately bit cluster fuck. doesn’t make sense include pre-existing conditions (diabetes, obesity, etc.) things covid actually causes. Granted technically still comborbidities kind glosses massive distinction creates confusion people don’t take time understand can’t process basic statistics. Trump's death toll biggest, best! fuck's sake!! Stay inside! yours, family's &amp; surroundings' sake!! idiot. Severe case? there's levels covid? masks prevent levels severity? complex general public. first sentence logic. like saying ""Why trust girlfriend cheating you, back zero indications cheating you."" Well d'oh.

It described general news stream last 2-3 weeks Trump forcing say usual Trump stuff like tests possible open everything ASAP.

Also FDA taken forced approve snake oil treatments without scientific basis.

Not rocket science lol. 

I'm American btw. watching show. crazy president breaking health systen, seen fine that. terminology sounds like bad youtube clickbait video:

The Dutch PM made rookie mistake. Two fine examples fast PM paddle back truly listen scientists.  Yeah, makes sense several substrains virus different severity symptoms. preson unprotected much higher chance he/she gets multiple strains, including severe ones, compared protected person, better chance getting single strain. Yes, understand initial infection confirmed different manner reinfection. completely beside point I'm making, misleading slightest anyone modicum reading comprehension. Fact remains, 7 confirmed cases reinfection, such, that's reason assume vaccine give adequate protection. argue might reinfections. data?

I fully understand high risk, likely either die diminished quality life moving forward.

I ask world stop protect health. minimize exposure helping get groceries, wearing mask visit her.

I loved ones risk. assume wrong believing comprehend gravity situation.

Have good day. Lol Agreed. one thing article points faults high efficiency ventilation systems. Maybe takes programming lot buildings solve lot potential problems. That’s swab it!

Worse deadly virus ever. conservative, climate change real scary.

Isn't core conservatism idea oppose progress? If, seems likely Russian vaccine available substantial quantities months vaccines available, going significant pressure governments make Russian vaccine available populations. really strong evidence seatbelts prevent serious injuries death car crashes. evidence exist masks covid severity. Lol idk. stand comment. I'm pro-vaccine likely able trust vaccine released next months lack efficacy data. FDA rubber stamp operation Trump point. want get hydroxychlorquine'd.

I could clearer suppose. referring 1950s Salk Dead Polio vaccine. One labs fucked gave bunch kids polio. Parents trusted government back people freaked got vaccine anyway sorted problem. That's likely happen again. need effective safe vaccine first go. fuck authorize bad vaccine there's reservoir public trust make that. tried warn y’all cause pain everyone instead causing pain people? need stay locked homes get data. Full hazmat suits disease gone! I'm sure would make happier:

* telephone poles eliminated power distribution buried underground
* politicians prohibited speaking public matters public policy live made illegal public without one. Can’t even car one person without one even family conduct much testing did? Testing enter argument - look deaths/1M pop. testing important locating eradicating virus, get rough gauge mitigation effectiveness looking death counts. testing miss infected, miss many dead.

As smaller land mass/populations, also relevant. handful countries similar population sizes US, one (China) trust. India handled pandemic almost poorly US, Brazil. Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria major travel hubs (your next objection), Bangladesh, Russia, Mexico roughly population Japan (at 126.5 million), indicate comparable US. look [population compare smaller country larger one. 

&amp;#x200B;

|Country|pop/km^(2)|
|:-|:-|
|Japan| 333.38 |
|New Zealand| 19 |
|Vietnam| 290 |
|United States| 34 |

All countries denser population centers rural areas.

As traveler volume, travel restrictions thing done. fact, Trump famously them, half-assed fashion typical response threat. Also, Japan Vietnam much closer epicenter pandemic, means early much higher percentage traffic country came China local nations. So, ""early spread"" hypothesis support claim US harder high travel volume.

States look federal government agencies guidance. president says big deal, makes harder state tell citizens take threat seriously. actively advocates taking proper precautions wearing mask, calls state leaders traitors locking down, makes even difficult get nation wide response going. states quite good case passing blame. Cuomo rightly criticized bit stupidity, suffer consequences. see blame passing defense US response Coronavirus playing Whataboutism.

And yes, expect Federal government leverage power encourage states what's right. states enforce mask mandates, Fed assist whatever resources assistance require so. entire country works together combat threat - every state itself. Divided fall, united stand hard concept grasp. Dead instead read...Freudian typo interesting choice? “point” statement America probably Baseline way vulnerable thanks obesity

But contradicted claim even show death rates America anywhere close 20% higher say Italy healthy countries many cases covid?

I can't show American stats trusted regarding difference order 20% US systematically underreported infections deaths.

I show Americans obese recite claim obesity factor morbidity. never said one wear cloth coverings. Everyone obviously should. never said anything like that. Obviously n95 preferred. everyone obviously covering face holes regardless. point people illusion wearing little layer cotton face ""protecting"" infection. not. purpose covering protect other, protect yourself. get it, Americans selfish, mean ""individualistic."" frame like one wear shit huh. pretend like cloth covering actually protects wearer. that, rain wet..! Shock horror..! summary Austria

Great, country almost everyone smokes still smoking indoor places people use like bars, cafes, restaurants. ""COVID-19 big deal""

But mean expect bring college kids back campus? Honestly we're done heat humidity, mind wearing mask. bother job garbage a/c, hot fuck. bunch really fun masks now, kinda dig getting wardrobe fun work since uniform wear black. LOL.

Since product attractive anti-vaxxers, something like billgatessataniium? Half crap listed actually strengthens immune system. Exposure disease strengthens immune system. That's entire point behind it. Inflammation result immune system strong. food allergies. Stress going produce cortisol steroid inhibits immune system, malnutrition inhibits basic functions, obesity lowers leukocyte counts things list actually going weaken immune system modern society. 

By means, go get COVID want ""strengthen"" immune system exposing antigens. guarantee going pleasant time. people believe vaccines first place... [Moderna's trial ends Oct exactly 7 days election.

It started Jul 27th. Since 30,000 patients enrolled study probably looks like month enrolling patients 2 months observation give 2-3 months safety efficacy.

Even proven safe effective though due production, distribution supply chain issues expect I'll able get March earliest.

And Moderna already starting at-risk production, approval process speed anything up. Trump could declare tomorrow he's approving Moderna vaccine, I'm still getting March. could take extra month Phase 3 trial push December, I'm still getting March.

(Just taking Moderna vaccine one example since managed find actual clinical trials notice)  Thank you. need apologize totally get that, I’m glad could reasonably work discussion Afaik yes, even got it, fact wore mask makes degree ""got it"" smaller.

Over simplified explanation: Imagine one unit covid multiply thousand units span day. happened wear mask exposed to, lets say thousand units. But, wore mask exposed 10 units. one case body would fight million units covid one day exposed, case 10 thousand. smaller exposure lets body time adapt fight virus simptoms smaller even non-existent.

At least that's read months ago, I'm definitely oversimplifying think gist right, anyone knows please correct I'm wrong. Perhaps missed constant conspiracy retweets leader charge. recent one claiming 9k ppl died covid. may fix underlying issues country, certainly making worse must say fully understand passion behind the""Medicare all"" debate USA. We've Canada since 1961 Kiefer Sutherland's grandfather introduced first province Saskatchewan, going national. perfect system costs less, better outcomes, provides greater freedom choose primary health practitioners healthcare institutions. National differences interesting. Critical Thinking tricky concept; people think critical thinkers. documented psychological Effectiveness important safety. vaccine 25% efficacy administer everyone, suddenly everyone crowding bars without masks 75% people going get sick. 

Not mention administering vaccine turns completely ineffective make lot harder public trust public health officials next time need convince take vaccine. 180k deaths (actually well 200k excess deaths) lockdowns. Wait don’t test asymptomatic people don’t COVID-19? country shitty education system half people's brains gasping bloodflow seas colesterol. really get point. well done trials use masks preventing severity disease covid. 

But no, need vaccines - bit cloth save everyone!!! actually much worse that. Check report CDC minutes. 6% figure removes everyone died covid19 also Pneumonia Respiration failures among things, normal preexisting conditions tens thousands Americans live everyday. “things already know” $400 Alex That's graceful attempt. Compelling seems people get less sick wear wear mask – even cloth mask – typically exposed lower dose coronavirus didn’t. mask perfect, wearing one might prevent getting infected. might difference case Covid-19 sends hospital case mild don’t even realize you’re shows cloth surgical masks block majority particles could contain SARS-CoV-2. experiments shown good cloth masks surgical masks could block least 80% viral particles entering nose final piece experimental evidence showing masks reduce viral dose comes another hamster experiment. Hamsters divided unmasked group masked group placing surgical mask material pipes brought air cages masked group. Hamsters infected coronavirus placed cages next masked unmasked hamsters, air pumped infected cages cages uninfected expected, masked hamsters less likely get infected Covid-19. masked hamsters get infected, mild disease unmasked places everyone wears masks, rate asymptomatic infection seems much higher. outbreak Australian cruise ship called Greg Mortimer late March, passengers given surgical masks staff given N95 masks first case Covid-19 identified. Mask usage apparently high, even though 128 217 passengers staff eventually tested positive coronavirus, 81% infected people remained evidence come two recent outbreaks, first seafood processing plant Oregon second chicken processing plant Arkansas. places, workers provided masks required wear times. outbreaks plants, nearly 95% infected people asymptomatic. ""the rise cases ~800 ~1700 day greater attributed solely testing increases, terribly high number itself, direction trend concerning.""

Or ""the lockdown reasonable.""

Or ""it's advisable completely go back normal life yet."" Let's put way

You wear mask works, helped you

You wear mask nonsense - gives shit, lost nothing deal wearing mask Costco half hour

But makes sense it? Think approaching army troops, less troops. God, really hope that's something made actual thing.  LOL, Awesome Headline! thought sure would edited headline. yeah hes already done cut funds CDC testing. Ya dingus. CDC states excess deaths 30k original due under-testing reporting multiple countys. Found guy understand joke too. mine take place college I’m class don’t mask others don’t around stresses appreciate response, apologize dismissive prior comments. folks seem start shouting falsehoods, edge.

It's deadliest pandemic ever, deadliest pandemic now. “point” statement America probably Baseline way vulnerable thanks obesity

Can show death rates America anywhere close 20% higher say Italy healthy countries many cases covid? Considering many obese overweight people you’d expect see way deaths no? course

USA #1 Canada little bro USA. 

Can never better USA #1 Spoken like true American. 

I don’t advocate child abuse, unless don’t like I’ll advocate child abuse. 

Keep bullshit, need keep everyone fighting bring whole system down. 

Hopefully kids end better humans you. shouldn’t surprise anyone newest deception. There's always another lie. 
One ""other causes"" pneumonia. 


This 6% incomplete death certificates. countries it, easier is. we'd taken nonsense approach East Asia, would now. is, effective countries get spill weaker countries, stringent border enforcement.  Level stupid: charts proof whatsoever people developing vaccines USA, UK (non Russian) taking shortcuts anything unethical, except proposed emergency use authorization? youth soccer referee terrible fire (no ears, much nose, burns visible skin) still remember positive impact seeing living life adolescent me. Obviously? left anti-vax. 

They anti-political interference vaxing win election.

There huge difference. refuse accept reality. WANT SEE PICTURE HAMSTER TINY MASK GODDAMMIT!!!! That’s works.

Except yeah seems exactly that. Yeah too, nope, snarky opinion piece wanted say made happy see someone use word like obfuscate. Hamsters didn’t actually wear mask usual, New York Post blogger got photoshop needs think death numbers wrong degree discussion useless. 

Never mind fact it’s easier lose track cases lose track deaths. even assume deaths twice high, number cases least twice high probably closer ten times high. 

It’s hard argue someone says missing deaths outweigh missing cases. ""128 217 passengers staff eventually tested positive coronavirus"" n95 wearing group. seem dramatically less me. People use critical thinking: seem think they'll paying top insurance(??). seem register idea insurance thing, pay amount (or less) taxes instead, get better coverage without strongarm insurance company actually jobs. Really frustrating see people defending health insurance scam compared universal healthcare. said first.

But ongoing situation.

You know thing like best science? supposed afraid admit wrong data comes in. 

It's scientific method. test hypothesis. over. hold true, formulate new hypothesis.

We much data mask wearing Covid-19 now. neuroradiologist...

Great! Thanks unqualified advice Scott Atlas. Next, we'll hearing Ted Plumber Jim-Bob ""Gator Wrangler"" advice correct pandemic management... Trump appointed top people various agencies. wants, ins response public pressure them. 

This hard understand, can't wrap brain around it? Indeed, thanks. ELI5: would husband get virus military training get virus him? work?? Also, funny comments like ""He cheated"" whatever. know didn't. Please serious replies. slightly improving. So... reopen everything again. too. I’ll dreams I’m class don’t mask one around freak cuz can’t see friends family cuz can’t expose Feeling everything though. surgical mask far comfortable decent cloth mask protect better specially designed task. is. Even people violently resist wearing mask know it.

To them, nothing thing masks, virus, health. 

To them, individual ""rights"". right whatever want, matter consequences. see people wearing masks political statement, movement, brainwashed, kind ""unnecessary conformity"".

They see personal identity attacked. ideologies stake. They're fighting death something value else: self

And stupid dangerous, considering actual death line. But, again, care. Sounds lot better cull. wearing masks sucks.

Before pounce me, I’m anti-masker. wear one social distancing possible, it’s required business. 

But let’s pretend wearing mask doesn’t suck. way test every day - 15 second “litmus test” equivalent - would part morning routine, like brushing teeth, taking shower, hair, etc. 15 second test put piece “paper” something tongue see you’re infectious not.

See thing masks, sucky thing prevent even sucky thing. one likes wearing masks, prevent mass spread virus. home test would “mask masks” - this, wouldn’t wear masks! THAT’S get buy in. continue introduce less inconvenient, easier measures suck less previous measure, higher % buys time. OP used headline newspaper verbatim. We're little worried Alberta right now. numbers trending upwards recently, several days row 100 cases. got easy early complacent, loosey-goosey mask mandates government level, nearly every county conservative China bad upvotes pls Sweden strategy? like it! sure anyone information new queue, but, goes. person wears mask gets slight case, person goes family everyone family catches inside house mask (because know sick yet) - family members get slight case potentially serious case?  know sorry fee fees running reality. Written zombie Herman. even look data make facts, right? 

Sweden Finland pretty much unemployment rate start year. higher Sweden. 

And anyway, explain 8% *drop* GDP 2nd quarter? Sweden suddenly get massive number immigrants? course not. actually falling already several years peaking height Syrian war 2015. 

How admit dead wrong statement Swedish economy covid-19? trolling. way almost September, people *still* passing case fatality rate actual fatality rate Yes, know, something totally protect you, protect all.

Therefore, seat belts protect car accident! Take r/conspiracy please Good news Syrian Hamsters - humans That’s article saying, yes. Obviously it’s guarantee, it’s less likely bad case (and others) wear mask appropriately. Brace long term cancers coming right. endangering people’s lives including yours. I'm willing assume organization godfather neoliberal economics Milton Friedman member best full shit worst sadistic blood drinking freaks, either way people trusted skeptical? Seems pretty simple me, virus moisture mouth nose, mask stops lot moisture escaping. Even mask poor seal still help There's also chance 0.1% chance fatal reaction suddenly 300k people dead generation grows antivax. giving something 100% population, need 100% sure safety Ah yes, ""reality"" ""logic"" cannot coherently communicate.

You're gonna win ""I'm rational you"" pettiness contest me, friend. I've seen insecure glory. Current stats 3-4% simple math beyond people. 180k dead 5.7mil infected. Keep numbers. time hit 50million 1.8 million dead Whoever wants believe this, I've got ostrich farm Mumbai sell. “Oh it’s media’s fault”. Shut fuck bullshit. It’s trump’s fault. every idiot listens Hitleresque rhetoric. It’s fault every apologist like you. Scott Atlas, Aka Dr Doom all. I'm talking 3-4 weeks ago. suspect testing times way better got ridiculous. wife got tested month half ago took 8 days. wrong though. nuanced. cloth covering protect virus. still get infected. Quite easily fact. Though infected party cloth coverings, get infected infection likely less severe otherwise. 

So we're going black white, yes no, 1 0, infected infected, cloth covering protecting virus. best simply reducing viral load. best. still infected, perhaps, maybe, bad. understand? coverings actually capture virus particles themselves. Meaning wearing coverings properly, properly sealed, etc. actually protected virus itself. reducing exposure level, actually protected. infection all. thought everyone died covid-19 actually died something else USA /s Hah guess wishful thinking part Correlation equal causation. People getting downvoted denying reality. gotta tell you, hope didn’t buy car him.

If you’d put check mask issue you’d much better psychological position negotiate deal. Pretty sure Japan SouthKorea already. didn’t change anything. They’ve reporting way since least early May.

Here’s link archived CDC page. It’s early May 2, 2020. 

This “only cause mentioned” clause isn’t anything FDA already done multiple things show undue political interference. CDC number scientific agencies. Loss jobs start wish obtuse think I’ve figured out: natural cure hidden giant ice wall billionaires go plan deep state. It’s pretty split folks know. half struggling pay bills half struggling invest money saving. It’s strange watch unfold.  said every GD holiday too. I’d eating restaurant friends suddenly remember oh shit Corona fuck mask oh god killed self didn’t I. New nightmares 2020 leader one socially distanced communities world still got it. Arrest ensure criminal records ruin whatever futures idiots have. trump? you? No, new. timeframe we're living in. 

I think first read month half ago. hamster paper came end heard happened chicken factory mandatory masks. Gonna lot Labor pains? actually, found need least finish phase 3 publish scientific community look at. r/coronavirus: Listen CDC! Listen science!

CDC: Wasting tests asymptomatic people achieves little, deaths extremely vulnerable populations reopening schools top priority.

r/coronavirus: *those* scientists!

Ya gotta chuckle 😆 maybe, people wear masks take corona seriously, make sure keep distance wash hands etc. People wear masks reason, probably care less measures. Medical science answer lies cloth-face-covering inaction March, IMO. 7am Beijing. 😂 yet office Thanks CDC excellent advice early Prasdent Trump done went teevee box done said coronievirus hoax cause Hillary Clinton ain't want say Merry Christmas more! That's done got rebel flag muh pickup cause I's Murcan Patriot! somehow effect severity COVID? Isn’t based things completely control? another one ""other causes"" respiratory arrest! people got covid randomly stopped breathing reason. I'm guessing people bothered actually look chart put two seconds critical thought it. I’m curious learn World Health Organisation saying people Covid can’t spread it. That’s awesome. stoked see people walking sheltered here, hear fancy bikes selling seeing parks get busy. good signs look collective message nada. 

Everyone looking info, great time talk activity, provide funds people work struggling buy bike — make bike, support healthy eating leave better habits least worse ones. Please read book. Many written many corners cut building WTC compromised structural integrity building. There’s vast conspiracy. take fall goes wrong. Thank you! People raised concerns kind process labeled ""anti-vaxx"" ""anti-science"". proof called ""educated"" people far ignorant realize. really need make bars restaurants carry everywhere. That's it. Every place else function long distancing masks enforced. kinda that, nothing stopping employers firing recover it, make another excuse fire you. fits research well. current understand know immunity isn’t certainty. People right may able fight reoccurring infection longer others. 

The thing sure people definitely immune. 37,100 per year average last 10 years according CDC Agreed, fuckin unconscianable, University supposed pinnacle education state plan someone gets case ofc will, plan students need quarantine... 

&amp;#x200B;

WTF, hard time served President University, allow watch CRIMINAL Good idea. I'm used second nature. wonder fuck epidemiologists studied university huh? Putting world cloth face coverings March no-brainer. ✨🌈*IMAGINE THAT*🌈✨ probably get lower viral load, wernt wearing mask. initial exposure. Many doctors gotten worse cases frequently exposed. u/nythro cmon bro gotta game! Fearmongering squad u problem theres incentive ends. Incentive lock people longer per diem prisons get. incentive report cases assistance funding. mess. confirmed way. 

You confirm case nasal test. multiple genetic tests two different strains confirm reinfection. 

Do understand basic point, comparing different things misleading people that? article completely honest. severe case based people's health fact wear mask.

Think it. likely outside wearing mask? Healthy people, right?

Who's likely wear mask? Sick people able vulnerable choose stay indoors.

If catch covid who's likely get severe case? true non maskers, got nothing fact group wearing mask.

Not saying masks bad, dislike dishonesty article. CDC nothing this. They’ve reporting “X % Covid listed” since least early May. Time UV kill virons. washing masks we're exposing bacterias though - different survival characteristics viruses. Also, well fitting higher filtration cloth mask wash/dry use may offer better protection 3-ply surgical one - [this one sure absolutely wearing masks completely support argument. personally social distancing everything can. wanted know proven scientifically Children absolutely spread teachers, staff, parents, grandparents, inevitably leading increase community wide spread,.....

It'll fine, everything fine, Gov Abattoir it! Yes, coronavirus always us now. Infectious diseases cause death part alive earth. can’t live rest existence Purell cocoons. That’s compassion, it’s cruelty. Exactly this. Everyone keeps arguing many people infected. Ohhhh someone's making numbers sound like sound like that. people going start fucking caring people dying? going start talking people fucking lost already instead debating virus real not? good portion country fucking full honestly get terrible image world large getting worse.

If one death much start fucking acting like it. Dying, I'm talking dying. lot 20 years folks too. point. Covid directly cause deaths, ultimately responsible nonetheless. looking total impact covid, count excess deaths. I'm still amazed ""excused"" absences count towards limit. course are. met people? We're awful. Surprised? That’s Texas you. It’s like isolated incident school anything majority schools around globe doing. least asked kids tested prior. school district isn’t testing fall semester starts next week. least tried. uh, president blatantly stated national television ""rally"" Tulsa. quite literally said ""If less testing would less cases. So, told people slow testing."" online learning “so much better” face face? parent special needs child please tell rest class MR severe ASD ever successful online learning. group somehow manages always left generalizations. LOL. literally said following last you, fact creating positive negative thing brings point lack empathy.

Of course fact people infected bad. pointed 1.04% positive rate (our total population) low. comment absolute absurd assumption tantamount subreddit become. Yeah, see email said ""one idea would keep schools open"" remember closed higher classes universities. That's difference discussed adopted policy lies. Protesters dont tailgate use massive high volume bathrooms drunk. hell wrong school system would punish children things outside control? children choose whether stay home FFS. .. meanwhile BC implementing LESS STRICT rules schools.. kind sucks wind argurment, BC's policies worse.

Might want check fly, see bias. great article share friends family, showing that, no, probably reporting COVID deaths, promptly ignore call communist. people taken original lockdown seriously, would now. countries took lockdown seriously, ended problem area.

Why take lockdown seriously USA? idiots spread misinformation refused wear masks people thought special rules apply them.

The real mental health problem country weak-spirited assholes can't troubled one little thing protect fellow citizens. wear mask, cancel party, flock tourist destinations like never another chance take vacation.

They follow letter law spirit wearing masks chins complain time inconveniences people heaping upon them, fellow humans choice control course disease.

It's always ""me me! anybody understand distressing me?!"" people inflicting problem instead cause problem themselves.

We could stopped virus tracks, unpatriotic, conspiracy-theory-believing naysayers made effort, contributed nothing helpful, complained every sacrifice, blamed problems people, prolonged pandemic absurd degree selfish, self-centered, unclean, disease spreading attitudes.

That's today, maybe think part solution instead part problem. Individualism strong part culture US it’s complicated perhaps. know share news sick often get response “well young don’t worry it..” . don’t understand hangs older risk people. individual centric view, lack empathy , politicized masks inconvenience lifestyle impact .. freaking perfect storm.

I think leave proof stuff math students deal proofs that’s biggest concern here.

Frankly, I’m concerned safety point — vaccinologists know make vaccines, none vaccines use remotely interesting adjuvants, indications literature vaccine probably going fine. I’m much concerned efficacy, that’s whole point clinical trials.

But know moment *single* bad reaction vaccine, CNN ilk it. there’s enough doctors country I’m confident least one want his/her 15 minutes fame raising concerns vaccine, matter unwarranted. (If want fun example that, check Schachter Schachter NEJM recently.)

And address elephant room: Dr. Hahn really needs work communication skills, almost inconceivable referring anything prospect emergency use authorization based trial prematurely terminated DSMB due positive signal interim analysis and, accordingly, breach clinical equipoise.

If words made sense you, also probably reaction heard that: shit, course prematurely terminated trial would count.

If didn’t understand said, that’s problem we’re facing here, would multi-paragraph explanation happens clinical trial regulatory perspective, much less easy digest headline says “FDA COMMISSIONER SAYS MAY APPROVE VACCINE PREMATURELY” snippy comment corruption whatever.

We’ve learned much since spring. Instead teaching people math works like teach brute force approaches shortcuts make sense unless understand underlying theory. whole education system dumbed past decades. make population stupid get away anything. yeah definitely linear algebra, proofs theorems n-space.

I considered ex-pat workers returning Middle East elsewhere possible vector.

My understanding Alaskan case long US citizens proceed directly Alaska stop along way (except, assume gas hotel), cross border. know show proof residence Alaska. cases US travelers alleging headed Alaska, stopping sight-see BC getting fined caught. understanding people BC saw US license plates, likely call authorities. problem also dual nationals holding Canadian US citizenship property lower BC, would come stay property. unclear people practicing 14-day self-quarantine, happened live US half year already BC months.

My understanding trade exempt border restrictions, know details. suspect companies handling trucking rail shipping especially vigilant limit contact transmission, might wishful thinking. 

Before year, really thought much Alaska's trade routes rest US. would imagine currently also governed exemption essential workers (and trade), actually know.

It's September 2020, new science anymore, there's already overwhelming evidence hospital records, stored pneumonia patient samples even old waste water samples shows virus already circulating US Europe time Wuhan, Wuhan place detected it, and/or told public (which caused panic it), dealt it.

The virus objective, replicating reliability let anyone get away denial coverups. suppress testing blaming Wuhan want, end Wuhan that's returning normal right now, place suppressed testing virus endemic. Lol. type knee jerk reaction partly Covid denialists able spread much misinformation direction. 

To discuss schools rationally, make distinction age cohorts. Middle schoolers basically catch like adults absolutely school. young kids (ie person’s 5 year old) different Day cares remained open California even schools shut down. July 22, 33,300 facilities capacity care 720,882 children. date, state recorded 1,365 COVID-19 cases linked child-care centers, including 261 cases among children

So whopping 0.036% daycare age kids infected daycares open one hardest hit states pandemic. since it’s also shown young children highly unlikely spread kid-to-kid, it’s likely many kids got sick adults home, making odds daycare infection even lower. 

When odds catching mild case ‘rona ballpark getting struck lightning (and likely significantly lower odds getting car accident en route daycare) comes off

Thing is, us doesnt care stuff. province 10 million people, freak 100 cases day. deaths mind you, 100 cases. us flatlines tens thousands cases day 1000 deaths. one cares.

Theres difference us zero risk culture. Pretending US martial law full lockdown ludicrous.

Masks distancing stay since provide relief. definitely arent zero risk zone. Ask someone South Korea china looks like - Promise anything like usa. like 100% accidental drops.

It easy accidentally drop mask lose it. light, catch wind, fall pocket, keys catch them, on. I've lost 2, kinda sucks hard get. 

Or people take off, fold neatly put table, completely forget time leave. I've seen many times well. numbers anywhere? [This analysis June seems suggest find little evidence support explantaion relies herd immunity following reasons. First, cumulative per-capita mortality rate COVID-19 plateaued different levels (appendix). . . Second, countries went lockdown early experienced fewer deaths subsequent weeks. Focusing countries applied strict suppression measures, compared per-capita deaths time lockdown per-capita deaths following 6 week period (appendix). herd immunity already reached, would expect correlation, even negative correlation, lockdown would alter herd immunity threshold population ultimate death rate per capita. strong linear trend suggests countries went lockdown earlier experienced fewer deaths following 6 week period. trend therefore inconsistent herd immunity explanation; however, exactly one would expect explanation lockdowns curtailing transmission deaths, making effective pre-lockdown transmission Third, finally, strong consistent relationship exists prevalence antibodies SARS-CoV-2 mortality COVID-19 European populations . . . . strong linear relationship seroprevalence mortality indicates disparate regions experienced similar mortality per infection.   exactly.. selfish.. message ""wear mask protect YOURSELF"" day fucking one.

Nobody actually feels way dumbass. know vaccine nothing Trump. still fly Mexico, though needed overtime. he’s dead.

This part fucking depressing. Since see discussed much, also want mention underlying medical conditions rare, even non-elderly populations.

[CDC 18+ Americans) : ""The median prevalence underlying medical condition residents among 3,142 counties 50 states District Columbia (DC) 47.2% (range = 22.0%–66.2%); counties highest prevalence concentrated Southeast Appalachian region. ... underlying medical conditions included prevalence estimates selected using subset list conditions strongest consistent evidence† association higher risk severe COVID-19–associated illness CDC’s website June 25, 2020 ""

As study mentions, data great well standardized, [Centers Medicare &amp; Medicaid seems early 2010's, estimated "" According new analysis Department Health Human Services, 50 129 million (19 50 percent of) non-elderly Americans type pre-existing health condition."" Note course high-risk/COVID-19 conditions, research centered pre-existing conditions impact Affordable Care Act.

And personal mostly uninformed skepticism/speculation, since cool thing days: imagine massive, wonder many dying dealing severe cases underlying condition aware underlying condition prior COVID-19 possibly even subclinical presentation. doctors looking it, realize hypertension, etc. admittance COVID-19. Weird real.... I've cooped long overly active imagination cop write this? companies bankrolling manufacturing vaccine approved, making gamble approved. Glad know I’m one nightmares. Excess mortality adds around another 50k. teaching English? confirm. China stealing American brains decades replace potatoes. many Americans brainlets. assume third antimaskers. Debunking misinformation

Calling conservatives directly.

Definitely two different things degenerate ""Durr hurr conservative r bad""

This sub used decent go-to covid news. half mindless crap see r/politics \- excuse circle jerk politics. forgot mask went bathroom work. supposed anyone else left classroom. came back classroom parent couple kids felt like got caught pants down. pulled shirt like someone darted looked away ran Literally  Sorry. I'm going dick here, think means actually find funny wants polite..? wear masks also face shields country. cases significantly decreased. It’s really small effort wear Cool, guess parents never go anywhere anything ever again. Glad saw December shit started. Wish known it'd last while. It’s okay, still golf 
True. 

That said, Florida better. Here’s latest case/death charts, running FB 7-day cases deaths trending quite bit. Florida currently ranked 16th per capita deaths, 52.33 deaths per 100k. That’s little less national average. yeah kinda like queen Victoria Krakatoa eruption. Ghandi would India today still british colony? Queen Victoria would volcano erupt? sometime ""big history figure"" things change history. sometimes happen history changes around dont enough guns. USA hand... think country going unique vaccine? That's little stupid, it? reasoning fitness test America racist classist uncaring monster use weapon disenfranchisement. reveals problems country voting. Teachers need chicken work hard home. don’t daft. course lockdowns work.

and, surprisingly, wearing masks better hygiene also works flu, Australia shockingly flu cases winter. O.5 % lot people? 1 200. Yeah, sure, notion going open business approved open foolish. They’ll get fined arrested cases seeing now, people get power shut off, etc.  seeing people operating within constraints, changing constraints.  people ignore social distancing mandates, etc, doesn’t mean constraints lifted. Call Larry David sort that’s counting excess mortality woulda thought ugly shitty every person dies ""because virus"" actually die number physiological failures? saying rest underlying comorbidities?

The report combines two, think there's much confusion. [Here information question, section labeled table contains entries like ""Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases"" ""Ischemic Heart Disease,"" clearly pre-existing health conditions.

However, also contains entries ""Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome"" (aka ""*Acute* Respiratory Distress Syndrome) ""Heart Failure,"" acute conditions two common ways virus kills patients. *(Not sure distinction ""Heart Failure"" ""Cardiac Arrest,"" listed separately. However, numbers similar, example works either way)*

What mean? think understood case-by-case basis. example, patient history heart disease spends 3 weeks ICU struggling COVID heart finally gives out, death certificate might coded ""COVID"" ""Heart Failure."" That's clearly COVID death.

On hand, patient pre-existing heart disease finally eats one chili dog many, heart attack, tests positive COVID croak, get coded as? [According CDC reporting coded COVID ""if COVID-19 played role death."" So, that's actually doctor going vary, based professional experience context clues. happen contract COVID days prior going die heart attack anyway? ignoring symptoms weeks, COVID finished heart disease started? Depending answers doctor's perspective, might coded ""Ischemic Heart Disease"" ""Heart Failure,"" ""Ischemic Heart Disease,"" ""Heart Failure,"" *and ""COVID.""*

Ultimately, think there's way knowing sure many deaths ""true COVID deaths,"" based figures. However, also patently false say 94% people pre-existing conditions. think come wash fact, excess heart failure deaths compared expected heart failure deaths based historical data, etc. Last checked, excess deaths pneumonia heart attack way high, everywhere, think time show we're underreporting COVID deaths, anything. circlejerk comment section deserves ""trending"" section pornhub. people deciding live virus, happening many areas. hope toilet also made full recovery  people middle, like pretty much laws. small worth chasing down, big fight back. Yes.

Why think many health care workers died?

Because even PPE, viral loads high. many get sick....they get very, sick. [One-Third Americans Won’t Get Coronavirus Vaccine] 

Problem solved! likely combination above. wear mask sneeze, mask catching spreading around.

Now obviously start taking mask off, wiping nose, mouth, etc.. touching things without washing sanitizing, ill spread more.

Mask net gain benefit though. teach preply dot com

Probly many parent looking teachers kids atm still one orangutang available believe... Yes. Tons people do. 

There even bus companies specialize medical tourism. article says medication forced persons quarantine traditional Chinese medicine though. [Here's use treat Covid-19 frustrating thing it’s likely challenger democrats may produce 2021 venal meth user. signs green that. However people must realice 2 types immunity:

1. Sterilicing immunity. means protected life survived infection gotten vaccination.
2. Adaptive immunity. Best example read common cold influenza. child catch rest life wil get reinfected again. virus changes immnue system wil adapt it. common cold never get really dangerous people. influenza older people, sound familiar?, certain risk groups need extra protection vaccination.

Big questions wil be:

* long take fully recover Covid19 average. weeks? months? years?
* much adaptive wil immune responce be? Wil bad first infection? like influenza? like common cold? hope last one high hopes least coming 25 years.
* long average time reïnfections? Months? Like common cold influenza, wich 1 year. wil lucky wil like Tetanus, wich 10 years.

In short, coming year wil boring right thing, wich is:

Be adult take bit extra care other. What’s India’s version Karen? us, yeah. 

...I'm 21 friend group isolating. can't stop idiocy, though. Medical professionals, cleaners, scientists construction workers wearing masks forms PPE stronger cloth mask decades. fine. Stop hoax arguments. really matter, it.

You're finding shit supports view, justify ignoring something doesn't.

Textbook confirmation bias. really matter say. Thanks interesting response Me, too! got two left, find stores. Finally found pack 36 online. Catch starter pack got another wand need. Cuz many us would normally fleeing Mexico Canada care. Probably incomplete answer expert need make sure safe (or evaluate side effects vs benefits) also make sure works, meaning induces immune response allow protected long time. clinical trials vaccine put market.

SARS-COV-2 vaccines candidates already exist clinical trials ongoing. think 4 5 candidates already phase 3 (clinical trials divided 3 phases).

Edit: answer question directly: yes ""just"" that, already have.

Also another factor make vaccine useless virus keeps mutating fast pace able predict mutations, always least one step behind virus vaccines protecting yesterday's mutation (e.g. HIV, AIDS virus).  Good point. They're plague proportions there. recommend intensive culling program, especially due lack genetic diversity leading obvious retardation caused excessive inbreeding many ""political"" bloodlines... Look “the emperor clothes” you’ll see bombard individuals endless “scientific studies” yet look around eyes rational mind, it’s obvious what’s really happening. put personally attacked stating opinion, derived common sense, emboldens belief.

And yeah zeitgeist 2 got way heavy handed “energy utopia” nonsense. even condemned nuclear energy. Check Pandora’s Promise. Dope documentary.

And don’t take seriously. media governments sudden care health yet allow steady stream poison consumed nonsense. May sound like conspiracy, governments media don’t care us sudden say do...I always look alternative reasons. Everyone pre-existing condition inevitably results death, therefore number people actually died Covid-19 zero. condition called mortal. Also wearing full PPE protect tear gas probably hurt Except case Covid probably likely pneumonia &amp; AIDS. feel like confusion &amp; arguments come in. know lack young people dying virus finishing old &amp; weak off, thing causing weak. enlist least little bit ready die lmao No. asthma. Years ago developed policy touching nose/mouth/eyes hands I've touched anything outside car. found really cut number colds I've gotten. (Though found flaws system. Like Kleenex. gave cold reusing tissue pocket. use squares toilet paper. One square toilet paper small enough I've touched nose, throw away. I'm going long time winter, load pocket squares toilet paper.)

With pandemic first got home would go back car bleach solution sanitize everything touched. Also house doorknobs.

Now carry spray bottle rubbing alcohol spray hands (and rub alcohol bottle) get car hands already sanitized.

The faculty fucked well. Professors old shit. great time adjunct professors get hired though!  scientific evidence... again. Implying done well...

It implemented anywhere Global North outside New Zealand. Shutdowns reactive, proactive. Welfare benefits increased often without lockdown orders, quarantines, contact tracing, etc. Countries continue ""open up"" despite actually getting cases control extent contact tracing could ever work chance avoiding second wave winter.

Meanwhile, New Zealand, Taiwan, Vietnam, China chilling, relatively speaking, taken proactive measures instituted public health recommendations Please let know interventions Dutch taken, where.

- Preemptive shutdown, stopped flights country instituted mandatory quarantines essential flights January. Rinse repeat border crossings.

- Lockdown within country 3 weeks January instituting widespread testing evaluate extent infection already spread. Based results, either institute social distancing, mask mandates, contact tracing continue lockdown.

- lockdowns reopening, float residents generous UBI ensure rent mortgages paid *or* freeze mortgages rent prepare real estate fallout. Also people eat, electricity, etc. fairly capitalist friendly version figure amenable crowd. UBS would better sudden socialist reorganization would better I'm trying meet nerds halfway want keep theoretical masturbation sessions, try including non-materialistic elements like 'joi-de-vivre' (you know decadence bourgeouis hegemonic culture), everything zero-sum-game.

TIL understanding straightforward public health recommendations European socdem economics = non-materialist masturbation. don’t believe you, where’s evidence? /s failed account air bypasses mask sides. masks ""tightly fitted"" around ventilation. They're dividing smart dumb politicising this. disgusting.

We human affected this. People going die even unnecessarily now. I'm going word slacker dad retired cardiology job 83. tell link apple mobility data, shows really lockdown? looks like half assed it.  Everybody dies heart attack severed brain stem. truth deaths illness always deaths complications. people die illness underlying conditions, healthy people die illness.

It's like saying one ever died cancer. non-medical terms, like saying push cliff kill you, impact ground did. validate people saying though? 94% people dying Covid already sick enough die number things. watching stats closely we're determined see super deadly virus. Sure. believe unfair 90+% life we're taking us. morning flash panic forgot put mask on. 

I house. Nobody else home. Sorry  That's best one hope for. Lets forget took data month highest stage dramatic decline. Several areas reporting backlogs still uncounted. bizzare insulting time. literally makes sense. fuck? fuck paid make account like yesterday say life never go back normal? That’s craziest thing I’ve ever heard Lets compare 2 worst affected provinces (Ontario, Quebec) US states. provinces significant outbreaks long term care facilities, local governments widely criticized, largely prevented widespread community spread. 

\- Ontario would 5th largest population (15 million, 2857 deaths, 42,195 cases, 3 million total tests conducted). terms cases (42,195) would rank 36th. Testing, conducted 7th tests. terms deaths, would rank 17th. 

\- Quebec 13th largest population (8.5 million, 12th including Ontario, 5760 deaths, 62,492 cases, 1,663,403 tests conducted). terms cases QC would rank 28th. testing, QC conducted 17th tests. terms deaths QC would rank 10th. definitely think be. agree. go debunk politics sub. result convinces even people wear masks, potentially saving thousands grannies question whether, weeks lockdown, really made material difference.

Look situations like recent church initiated massive spread SK.

They’re struggling recontain one incidence.

And we’re never going trace isolate US.

Under 1,000 take away people pre existing comorbidities. Nawww, thought masks new fashion trend. infuriates everyone saying Sweden held example everyone operating, take account cultural differences. people Sweden following guidelines? Absolutely. Swedes large socially conscious expect high rates compliance. 

Even still Sweden made mistakes, admit it, closing nursing homes earlier, resulting deaths could prevented. also far achieving herd immunity entire goal, that's failure sense too. spared recession purchases decreased sharply thanks elderly high risk choosing stay neighboring economies choosing lockdown. 

There many cultural reasons Sweden's autism approach would never work America, also reasons related government services infrastructure. Sweden offering compensate people cannot work high risk groups, meanwhile can't even get compensation people missed work *had* Coronavirus waiting tested exposed. trying make easier population avoid infection instead forcing risk lives others might profit labor. Shit no. us want decent paying job. admin lied cover severity pandemic?

We discussed months ago. people knew.

But there's still believe bs. lot schools require masks classroom now. Also York go Walmart. crazy. Okay? Trump assured flock they'd vaccine year.

On average people get mild cases.

You could pre-existing condition. (I've heard [someone went exposed dead three could immune system over-reacts. could someone Covid-19 sneeze eyes get big dose.

But likelihood would less sick. Maybe completely asymptomatic. see really wants keep FL top. Mandate masks least partial lockdown ya idgit. doesn’t effective, non-lethal election. Guess Floridians going anywhere, anytime soon think sarcasm. maybe 4 confirmed cases true, however lends contrary Well someone knows many people caught recovered also couple died, I’ve decided risks I’m willing take. probably done think vote mail it’s election fraud. immune system would come part 2. II allows document conditions part main causal sequence death likely played role hastening death. example might ischaemic heart disease patient died immune system problem cause spider bite vice versa, contributing factor death.

It probably 1a multi organ failure, 1b sepsis, 1c spider bite, 2 immune deficiency

A minute two conversation, finally realized forgot mask car. went grabbed nearest surgical mask, felt like idiot. I'd wearing months...and randomly forgot. Worse admin process it, realize caught myself.

Thankfully, employee-only daycare healthcare org. Masking second nature parents (nurses). occasional idiot forgets. (It once, swear.) neither simply “losing track” (much deliberate) situation states going, “oopsies, don’t know someone died!”

Tell deep state lying Q! actual title article Ah yes, finger waving Proud Boy MAGA u/top_kek_top

I’ll stay touch. Go touch someone else. guess so. stupid question all. It’s taken long time feel comfortable speaking often it, easier gets. 

In regards mask situation reddit post nice silly visual makes sad subreddit (UK) reading soundbites letting political opinion sway lot discussion. imagine governments done throughout history new talking point deceptive debunked. Could worse mate. run monkeys doubt quite inconvenient really stinks, running toilet paper, that's way shittier... many factors play. That's can't compare country mask mandate vs one without assume effect mask wearing.

Also thing ignoring practices focused mask wearing pure conjecture. could also say mask wearing remind people practice disease spreading behaviour. conjectures ""make sense"", yet mean nothing without supporting data. mask goggles solve fogging problem.

Then saw article switched mask face shield. no, not. hey, simp694200! *dong*  thought mask prevents spreading, getting it? That's ... I'm sure call ... crazy? Damnit. waste money Yeah, shit. Dumbass org.  Obviously argue different policy. would liked Sweden-version protection elderly.

Doesn't make discussions less retarded. composed Americans hammering politicized points. 0 actual interest country case: masks good trump bad protest good republican bad. Invert opposite group.

I bet beaming found death statistic. Ironically relate masks, late measures, massive early hotspots deadly variant.  think death numbers wrong degree discussion useless. 

Nope. said something different dumb like Never mind fact it’s easier lose track cases lose track deaths.

But I'm discussing systemic underreporting coronavirus cases deaths. neither simply ""losing track"" (much deliberate) situation states going, ""oopsies, know someone died!"" Instead, ascribing cause particular infection.

For point matter, know US' *systematic underreporting* changed ratio metrics one particular even assume deaths twice high, number cases least twice high probably closer ten times high. 

Ah, ""realities"" ""logic"" making believing It’s hard argue someone says missing deaths outweigh missing cases.

Quote saying apologize error, King Logic. long time ago Chinese topexpert estimated herd immunity 25% 70%. Current estimations 50% 85% according immunity fixed number. lot depends peoples behavior. Rule thumb take, freely people moving higher Herd Immunity Treshold wil be. measures taking states countries aiming that, lower immunity treshold keeping economy going acceptable pace. wait vaccinations get higher immunity treshold people move freely. chart MSU website pretty alarming showing growth last two weeks comparison weeks prior: killing hundreds thousands extra people i. US, happens coincide pandemic, virus?

What hypothesis? point possible COVID death (don't worry, tested negative) would make ""fear it"" would common flu.

Why not? example covid people age. So, fear it. necessarily sake (although justification well death thing covid causes), spreading virus someone else like grandmother. Someone brought virus grandmother's nursing home caused havoc there. virus widespread society, would less likely happened. everyone's duty best numbers go outbreaks avoided. entire point post. I'm going freak act like end world may exposed COVID going business. take precautions let paralyze me.

Well, that's selfish you. Since risk group, care spread people are. kind individualism cancer society affects ability fight pandemics many problems well. school reopenings begun appear US case profile? Thank sacrifice. learn lot wisdom may already it. may symptoms. might lucky maintain good hygiene avoid getting it. yet still countless idiots refusing wear damn mask. one dies car accident die things like blunt force trauma, punctured lungs, ruptured spleens etc doomers touch agree.

The reality quite difficult people reconcile see news personal experience.

I talked many people ""see"" bad made be. interactions online either communities like reddit, facebook, forums/social media platforms, coming contact anyone witnessed anything remotely disturbing result virus. result, seems like serious reports exaggerated.   excess deaths C-19 deaths. I’m Disney cruise group. poll couple months ago, think July, people would feel comfortable going cruise again. Many said NOW. Right now. hell. turn study next ? Dying old age thing dying pnuemonia... covid?   Correct. rank one worst countries terms C-19 cases per capita, much better terms excess death percentages overall. regard quite unremarkable, actually average deaths much Europe seeing resurgence not. I’m teacher giant student loan resign. man literally ruining life. Yes, that's point article.

Wearing mask protects reducing amount virus enters body.

And poster right. one place could speak car dealership. Even salesman, say ""I'm comfortable people wear masks properly. situation corrected, I'm leaving."" explanation? Please leave us Canadians this, get goddamn shit together. Thanks  Oh yeah. make nervous them. funny part folks, followers, is, think real, serious, big deal etc

Then Donald Trump get COVID tested ""multiple times day"", entire White House gets tested daily?

I thought serious? Florida residents already dominated cesspool Yeah, think there’s actually good collaboration various countries. really think it’s team effort, despite gov leaders may wish. Going down, sir?  Simple question. Would beliefs without however get news? I'm saying media's fault, excusing anyone. I've already mentioned problems lack leadership. ever want solve issues, need figure happened happen again. Even lets say 1000% everything since beginning time trumps fault. corporations businesses whoever donating money/controlling too. people vote him? ostracize enough population way? suddenly woke decided hes best thing ever? brewing forever one cared. act mad. Nah want inconvenience golf game, Kevin. influenza-associated. think we're trying say thing. Someone decided go deep SEO point lol. “Skuld” also conveniently translates “guilt” Fauci right go pretending people would still alive that's far truth.
 
According what? Thank father special needs kiddo depressing try get use distance learning. needs hands help needs constantly. made huge progress last semester (she pre-k) seems like lost. went back physical classes last week started seeing immediate improvement IEP. Thanks do! never thought we’d drop 5k Yes, pandemic control Texas. good. Business usual. 

You need watch sassy mouth dreadful words like “crap.” Dirty, vile filth!! Masks actually work better moist. videos people saying horribly racist things canada, northern states, place. know rock living under, consider racial epithets examples racism, something important missing understanding concept racism, come conclusion have. 
 
i really, really, really hope 7 years old. Part-time employees usually get nothing too, right? post office today two 8yo looking girls pulling masks blowing raspberries other... yelled across lobby needed keep masks indoors... 

Kids don’t know serious is. don’t think it’ll impact go ASU, love handling it. I'm forced attend physically, classes Zoom. require hybrid classroom people want go video records class online. doesn’t really matter. Thanks! There's certainly lot politically-motivated nonsense floating around, think part it.

I've following Oxford vaccine efforts since beginning, hard, they've said almost nothing publicly. succeed, interesting read book behind-the-scenes story. wait - implying people fact come world class medical care? so, please cite evidence. intention sign language interpreter present? I’m going pull prediction given DeSantis didn’t pulling Quest list approved vendors. cut testing capacity half, again, we’ll probably see 2500 cases day quite time. voting Trump? so, really nothing common. not, may something talk about. equate fear urgency taking Covid seriously accepting schools reopening trust children wash hands encouraged gather streets protest BLM? narrative follow? I’m runner many people rely swimming cardio fitness due weak joints etc. 
Gyms open want encourage fitness, everyone’s knees run miles week keep relatively healthy work biomedical research lab, would fired heartbeat failed follow protocols even single time. Don’t bother argument. people kids, special genetic code kicks makes think everyone else care take care them. expected initially people campus. Ideally would expect they're finding cases get handle drive Never say never honest, even trump makes covid serious, American people still brave won’t wear mask day day interaction. want free housing, move projects communist country. I'm tired entitled brats acting like world owes handout existing. see point, thought kids get certain vaccines going school. always way? FaceBook allows people believe anti-vax misinformation people protesting. way 190K would still alive today considering

(A): total death toll reported 185Kish. 
(B): many died people nursing homes; eg, close death anyway. Many *would died anyway* sometime March August *anyway*, covid not.

This classic fear mongering political spin That's garbage schools pull anyway. pulled one kids (to go another school) ""extra"" work piled on. 8 3 enough, piled another 20 hours week extra. nearly cried yesterday nice cool breeze came through. version fall, hahaha. be. Maybe tweaked whole nuclear family idea, supported multi-generational household. start providing data Mid-July. trust Florida DOH accurately relay information? No. way completely side-step comment try jump different topic. Hopefully year two we're able get effective vaccines. world without international travel essential immigration allowed almost fate worse death me. Redditors 1 day always make great contributions. Yep, body choice risk others. People right risky things risk themselves. right take people's long term health lives away too.


their right swing fists ends end nose.

they drink allowed drive after. kid incredibly sickly due various childhood health issues. parents ended sending school sick occasion. understanding, would held back missed days, even though worked ways work home bring back in. I’m sure else parents could decided unless wanted wait 10 finish first grade. right. Good point. similar. Sweden definitely relaxed restrictions European country, however ""lockdowns"" e.g. Norway, Finland Denmark strict either compared countries like Italy, France Spain. thread thousands kids dying. right, same. flu far deadlier group Five months end national nightmare. Tick tick tick. know way make monkeys. hear horrible generalization. parents luxury staying home child. literally given choice working homeschooling child savings disappears. 
Throwing parents boat individuals describe make sense. 

If possible solution single parents can’t afford stay home let alone hire nanny, Id happy hear it. please stop generalizing like this, hateful... I’m curious actual experience online learning parent K-8 children? opinion literally harm good. Better let play creatively possible. Sounds like Nordic countries, except masks mandatory/recommended situations general think (at moment)? Oh Jesus, ""fake news"" parrot 🦜 Really sickens fauci masks critical period outbreak.. teacher? It’s 9k children it’s 9k total referencing, wrong based 6% number CDC put purely healthy people dying Covid. Tons people died Covid plus complication, idiots using excuse claim lower numbers, fucking stupid.

101 children reported 8/27 died. .02% child reported Covid cases (476k &lt;10% cases). argument whether it’s 1 9,000 kids, there’s level death isn’t tragic. also need pragmatic risk catching/spreading/dying vs. long term socio-economic damage kids. In-person schooling mandatory masks, distance possible hand washing feasible alternatives need accept we’ll probably live virus. Fauci knows virus empire crumbling. He's scared people onto him. Florida like cousin got drugs fucked family he's worst family get it. Texas over-privileged, rich cousin never told ""no"", never grew up, became pushy, entitled asshole. way, family hates Texas more. 10%?? Jesus, we're Webster watching unfold close home, especially well funded town like LC, disheartening. Stay safe. Truth inconvenient one-third voters. stuff like 100% attendance cements fact schools conditioning kids ready working world instead critical thinkers. think people agree shutting overreaction, part necessary people stupid wear masks. infection starts spreading faster people (more people, spreaders). started wearing masks outbreak back March/April (timeframe dependent location), seriously doubt shutdown would necessary. mostly response conspiracy interpretation CDC comorbidity data intentionally conflating comorbities preexisting conditions. Good, think Canadian looking go south anytime soon given current situation. hope Americans also restrain travelling Canada whole thing blows over. 67% respondents said would get vaccine

Hypothetically that's definitely herd immunity territory  cause housing shortages high rent. simpler abandon person responsible this?   104,654,644 people. Come dude. hell would know many? are. Peoples brains literally melting away. 2 month old account pretty obvious agenda. Speed run  Yup. made ""coronavirus likes this"" gif auto-reply stupid people social media. Nice! Cheap organs available transplant recipients black market again. That's one many questions Speak yourself. We’re pretty well northeast. Right.. open day... get infected? 
“Pneumonia Deaths” &amp; “Flu Deaths” Jump Enormously 
""Rise deaths attributed pneumonia suggests official US coronavirus death toll grossly undercounted"" sources contradict other. Education position. We're longer asking best solution given situation is, we're taking positions based politics. sickening. Trump's legacy one binary political division led impossibly bad outcomes. analysis topic linear algebra topic.

I don’t think linear goes Peano axioms agree. see people saying “But kid far behind! NEED socialize mental health suffer.”

I’m like well, life worth means. Personally, I’d rather kid behind alive. cousin 30 got corona. damaged heart bad enough heart surgery. fit worked preexisting health conditions. step dad also got ER week. took 3 months get somewhat back normal.

I think seeing people close get freaked out, especially cousin. Part effort reduce testing? remember living post-truth society though. Agreed aweful policy. Perfect attendance Kindergarten Senior Year high school meant automatic scholarship district growing up. Always hated policy rewarded great immune systems kids coming school sick sharing germs everyone. Oh yes! definitely understand agree. elderly mother two high risk kids I’m taking care of. I’m can’t risk either. I’ve basically relegated working less bc home schooling. empathize people choices. 

The pandemic widened existing fissures. daughters preschool, contrast small, high quality, Private Hebrew preschool. forced close couldn’t reopen still protect everyone. elect moron? Look Doug ford still alive would big disaster Canada boris johnson screwed Britain 

The problem populists embrace morons become morons different failure elite failures give Vietnam Yes, upon discovery began assigning arbitrary symbols concepts discovered. *concepts* mathmatics universal, *symbols words* represent concepts not. Sure, I'm saying good thing 

I'm American I'm genuinely asking death total entire US compared death total (again totaled entire US) previous years?

Usually people talk excess deaths mean total states. statistics individual states relevant. true. reduce rate transmission point cases decline combined set measures like face masks, dramatically reduce threat virus community. governments foresee locked down? mom would always let stay home qualify fun day. 

Thanks mom. see conservatives jumping ""revelatory data"" odd reason like proves something. seems like we've known since early days virus likely affect underlying conditions, might explain rampant America. hard time understanding COVID still cause deaths. saw friend pose it. similar saying nobody dies AIDS. lot people die AIDS contract bad flu pneumonia. people usually recover viral infection like flu, AIDS reason body defenseless infection though. seeing virus actually deadly even killing people without underlying conditions. Anyone pretend, False hope probably right term, public health policy based hopes future vaccine. pretty doomsday me. Worst thing that's happened life. 

Massive changes everyday lifestyle enjoy. Hassle wearing mask everywhere. Avoiding groups. activities enjoy. 

And sacrifices, we've still got 180k+ dead country? men, life expectancy fallen 2 years. 

If need positive spin, smallpox. I'd hate bring disease home kills bankrupts parents. know I'd love myself. Yes. That’s one wants talk about. NZ relies tourism big part economy. It’s gonna hard stay locked down. can't get/afford take time work reactions time. ""Perfect Attendance"" big fucking deal people.

Wipe vomit face load much medicine possible mask symptoms, head class. Fuck whoever got sick. people matter. Perfect Attendance mattered. Careful assume excess deaths Covid deaths.

New York, Covid outbreak mostly, well double total weekly excess death rates causes US average, despite three times fewer deaths C-19 per capita national average. I'm actually Canadian. I've quite while, never lived communism Naziism. Tbf, college kids usually stay within 5 miles school. would assume better way back home terms significantly limited interactions older people. me? Almost every one coworkers blasting morning. don’t even bother argue anymore it’s pointless. [Some people like president Google cost per kg ton orbit. Really expensive would guess. Yeah, listen experts, listen random Redditor. dude knows what's up. people working vaccine, promising treatments? complete lie, random Redditor uncovered truth!!!

People subreddit crazy Facebook posters site. that's impressive bar given stuff Reddit. Wait mean India actually going BS way out? pssh. dont go anti america circle jerk. Hmm, I'd rather one guinea pig unless signed one.

Given even FDA approved drugs vaccines (to smaller extent) still pretty adverse effects individual, would think higher percentage said effects would noticed population vaccine go proper trials established norms ensure safe majority. Jeeze, I'd foster care quicker mf days missed went school. County county city city. local government given freedom implement regulations. However, state similar circumstances two months. Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm, Tampa area... largest cities shut down. one beach Jacksonville opened everyone lost damn mind “beaches opened Florida!” reality one damn beach. couldn’t even use apartment pool moved July still. Oddly enough, moved back Midwest, people WORSE masks Florida.  Even get shit together it’d take year get cases enough. known transmissions occur indoors lack fresh air coming in. AC systems blow around.

In AZ july + august temps degF everyone stays indoors AC blasting cold air.

As temps drop 100s people spend time outside. start outdoor dining must go eat socialize. I'm middle school art teacher. Anytime kid walks even looks down, quietly let know need, put head down. also let can't everyday thing.

Even kids act ""beef"" appreciate really helps entire room seem like community instead jail go 8 hours day.

Their health comfort waaaay important knowing analogous colors neighbors color wheel. Lol First phase peer reviewed studies literally already published vaccines 🤦🏻‍♂️ side effects already published medical journals want spoonfed reading headlines ""Smithsonian Mag"" probably Buzzfeed articles live real country. don't. Drag out. Trumps administration worst US history - especially would reduce severity. mask mean standard cloth ones lots people wear. Assuming true- mean secondary attack (ie. One gets infected public brings back rest household)?

Assuming minimal number people masking homes- imply it’s riskier sleep next masker interacting public would masker themselves? remember thinking happens movies! every death. Xi's China killing it. guess confused ""i know rights america"" see viral walmart videos reddit every awhile...but beyond everyone wears mask reasonable to. really can't go anywhere / anything without one I'm going get thousand downvotes dont care upvotes mean nothing. 

Wear mask dont wear that's choice. 

I repairable health safety responsible mine. 

Simple. Lol. Curious want continue? retirement forced via family work? Check case curve Hawaii: mandate went effect April 20th, right tail end first bump cases. understand anyone look say masks mandates great. Transplant recipients look forward cheap organs soon. June? thought quarantine stay-at-home would weeks! bright side, plenty toilet paper stock. better quantitative metric? best music

One Thor Ragnarok soundtrack. Basic questions like ""what's state capitol?"", ""who's governor?"" ""Is Sean Hannity real journalist?"" would probably wonders. agree you, I’m holding breath everyone equally infectious every point... actual rate transmission among households 10-30% depending study read. trend too. way accurately show much city locked down. American virus transmitted across pond. would ECMO considered  ""something controversial""? mean stabbings near Roehampton go go up? Fauci says January entirely feasible. UK, Canada, Germany, say late 2020 early 2021. opinion direct contradiction top infectious disease regulatory experts. Coronavirus breathes huge sigh relief.  USA No.1! Anyone ever questioned that? can’t silence fact. original data models fucking shit, current ones aren’t much better No, nonsense needs addressed, talking ""conservative talking points"" that.

So another politics sub now. Pointless covid information sift endless political threads.

Another sub, lost mindless rabble. It’s never-ending race bottom, point. wonder anyone’s going beat US’s high score fucking shit.  Learning Chinese see. Teeth falling tornado's coming lol. know need work stress levels start dreams. still get water you, umbrellas useless one use one.

\- Anti-maskers exactly suppression turn mitigation? want know judge countries different measures. Sorry I'm going listen communicable disease specialists instead random commenter internet case OP, random commenter internet link opinion piece written professor economics case.

There 6 million cases US 36k new every day... maybe bit fear-mongering given many people see give shit stop wearing masks social distancing. There’s huge backlog.

Cut 50% vendors...

Uhoh. Poor boy! modern advances technology, automation, productivity, need work much keep starving homeless. Fewer people could working fewer hours keep us living comfortably. Greed capitalism allow this. upside guys really fantastic nicknames govenor, proud that!  want save American sports, follow NHL format go play bubble...in Canada. even remotely considered news except enough stupid people getting together cause community spread even cautious. Even masks social distancing there's still amount risk going grocery store risk increases amount community spread area. Ask mom. Maybe good reasons decisions. Maybe realised mistake. Cheney shot guy. Lol 12 days, actively turning people away getting tested asymptomatic. least Houston last month, 2 co-workers family members test positive told come get tested. got community spread control observed timeframe, may (probably did) lockdown. get spread control, KNOW real lockdown. Exactly. CDC say anything incorrect. crazies among us chose misinterpret precisely said justification continuing give shit vulnerable among us. can't. He's getting bad Trump spouting nonsense sounds good people believe it. much this. timing peculiar. doubt there's story. Quietly conveniently forgetting thousands thousands thousands thousands dead. kids adults too. Ahh thank clarifying. Reminds AIDS epidemic people actually die aids virus instead compromised die cold something typically minor. 250,000. Americans Hitlr killed. Yeah that's I'm wondering too! tried figure another thread got downvoted reason...what 6% look like? honest question certainly would died within next years regardless covid

What's matter die eventually, right? mom.at end life nursing homes rehab. lot cases elderly rehab nursing home place. sending late 70s early 80s type rehab 30 something gets. 
So mom still alive something happen would rehab home help. also least nursing home/ elderly living. able apartments extra care needed times stay way till all. could many years.The apartment sections huge compared eol high need section. would nice Fauci would use numbers far closer truth official counts even CDC realized 50k official deaths 100k June. Well 1/4 million Americans died far say every time. come?? think lot companies similar mentality. old school need catch risk losing valuable people. It’ll lighter it’s less Southern Hemisphere. flu seasons happen flu bounces back forth hemispheres via travelers time indoors = spread winters flu season.

Because flu light (and international travel still limited) it’ll light too. It’s cycle we’ve changed locking world literally told people outset pandemic wear masks public....

You're forgetting thing called AIDS kill ruining immune system another sickness kills you? effectively AIDS kills one, sickness kills give everyone AIDS? logic fucking idiots. Here's decision negative repercussions anyone!

/s number? saying inaccurate? Anti Vaxxers: Durrr vaccine bad mind control bill gates

This Sub: Heh, anti vaxxers dumb

Also Sub: Nooooo vaccine blumpf want vaccination nooo Really? think he's problem? say that, context thought masks better used health care folks. far, biggest issue politicizing pandemic. state bear responsibility cross check labs submitted data.  


I'm teacher keep track students hand not. responsibility find assignment is. list labs testing? Good news. Since Quest booted out, count way now. Party on!

It uncomfortable enough bring car mechanic, able trust need work say do, actually used hours parts say did. Imagine getting feeling go doctor. situation, logical skeptical.  fuck erred mean wanna see ""science"" followed make statement. guarantee 80 year old nursing home resident 3 comorbidities died last 6 months anyway? ""it kills people pre-existing conditions"" make anyone feel better?

Most people pre-existing conditions last time checked people high blood pressure still people. incorrect argue subset people, however small may be? people majority opinion, I'm supposed argue them?

They're numerous enough see Reddit every day. Hey, cool links scientific studies posted. look invisible everyone else, magic eyeglasses let see them. Thanks sharing them! stated comment above: discussion schools reopening needs context age cohorts. Everything state correct older kids absolutely true kids age 6. 

Do maybe like 15 minutes research find exactly this. seriously asserting risks 6 kids returning school high schoolers objectively bad job stark disagreement pretty much entire epidemiology community. I'm south texas. bring freezer trucks store bodies. people spreading misinformation criminal, responsible unnecessary deaths. Fuck hell. I’m talking Americans. really don’t care y’all water. Y’all take vaccine care. really couldn’t care less. guys go first let’s see happens. y’all don’t die might take it. Early pandemic, crapton news virus similar matched viruses animal populations part China, currently nothing comparable USA Europe aware of. similar reports Europe USA?

The origin virus frankly irrelevant need it, objectively speaking, still seems likely began China, zoonotic event. Contrast Spanish Flu, AFAIK outright unlikely began Spain, rather, China, France, America likely origins - ascending order likeliness. POTUS: Hold beer. tests positive COVID-19 first day in-person classes

So?  missed FUCKING PANCAKE BREAKFAST every year school Jewish holidays (Rosh Hashanah Yom Kippur always 10 days apart one always weekday). course missing school Christian holidays like Good Friday count attendence. got caught lie you’re trying squirm it. Dunno, great corona yeah guess. IMO Covid flu, vascular disease explains complications killing patients. That's rest sentence part there. Insert obligatory ""It's flu bro"" joke. population sort immunity built 

So? difference catching now, catching later?

Actually, difference... even without vaccine, survival rates increasing doctors find better treatments disease. longer person remain uninfected, greater chance surviving become infected.

The idea ""front loading"" deaths ""herd immunity"" take affect incredibly stupid results unnecessary Lockdowns killed UK economy 

There lockdown Sweden, economy suffered well. binary option. long pandemic continues, international trade severely affected, globalised world means every nation's economy severely affected - lockdown not. make even worse otherwise would without law. Many parents can’t afford stay home kids they’re sick. serious societal problems. There's 3 different versions front page right now, one removed. Sorry. Nail salons involve client provider facing other. That's huge difference barber shops. lmao won't

No one Georgia giving fuck point unless government threatens livelihoods them. People keep forgetting reason we're locked right anywhere world/country government enforcing it, people scared. mean breath air virus it, may able affect could still hitch ride sinuses without affecting you. know next breath could clear airways could overthinking this, would still prefer come home change clothes least wash hands well visiting anyone potentially immunocompromised even vaccine. know bio 101 basics this, I'm guessing experts could clarify would much appreciated. though? even know risks vaccine yet? haven’t even finished trials yet. don’t know risks. pretty much know risks Covid. know nothing vaccines yet don’t think efficacy rushed. new vaccines, likelihood encountering disease wild low. means takes years efficacy information. pandemic, chance exposure much greater shortens length time needed determine efficacy. So, it’s much rushed quicker gain results due circumstance. 

This head Moderna stated makes total sense. Playing Russian Roulette ending bullet lodged skull mean stupid playing Russian Roulette *Every* picture like that, tho. facing other, wearing masks, exposure limited less 30 minutes. odds transmission case pretty slim. Hospitalizations 50% late July.

 Usage&amp;country=United States&amp;county=All&amp;state=Florida allow opinion articles articles opinion articles. Sorry. forget places tardy considered absence. kid could classroom butt seat bell rings counted absent. surgeon general literally told nation masks don’t work biggest problem parents still expected go work. work time leave 6-10 year old alone laptop day? Without government stepping giving people assistance wont work. say 'just send daycare' got problem again. frustrating see highschool college kids go back person easily stay home online learning. Mostly “excused” absence come doctor. absences it’s parent usually marked “unexcused,” though varies district district, even state, county, city. 

Sometimes even vary school, if, example, there’s charter school that’s technically part district, don’t necessarily follow policies. Still trying catch Alabama. Maybe use knowledge inoculate people. Yes. Death certificates part 1 part 2. Part 2 comorbidities, part 1 stuff involved chain events. implication thing sets chain motion there, chain occur.

Part 2 also means involved chain, help it. one lung would example. means one lung cause person catch covid, help did.

What means covid thing listed person caught covid died, insufficient proof pin specific cause complication covid. If, example, person died acute myocarditis clinicians might able say ""myocarditis"" certainty. Oh yeah, risk 40 year old pre existing conditions also hikes (with childern) 5 8 miles every weekend? fantastic shape despite balancing challenging life high degree reaponsibility.

You tell me, since education done justice. calculate let's see come with. think it’s important mention UK UofL started classes two weeks ago. rise, concerning, expected students coming back campus. think rule 4 there? not, going get bogged mindless political rhetoric.

Too late. misrepresenting data say China getting free pass, Chinas per capita emission half US investing massivly green energy (but yes. Also fucking lot up) pointing somebody else going ""why they...."" answer actually pretty simple, still moving country city, 1/6(?) world population, ""west""/we dicking around 30+ years able urban population without raising emission, factor also produce lot goods ""for"" us, suddenly sort makes sense.

Also unknown measurable effect planet basis, look ozone layer, look lead-polution gasoline, oh look ice cores recorded temperatures. might science religion, religious side wilfully ignoring and/or misrepresenting science, claiming ""we dont know"" know House arrest basically  thought her! Lolll there’s thing evolution.

/s Yeah, use animals, mandatory publishing. screw results intentionally try avoid publishing, sanctioned.

Non-human, animal research something humans determined necessary evil, acknowledged evil done utmost care. article says treatment considered controversial concern prolongs suffering patients likely live, also due high ethical concerns technology half patients receiving treatment eventually die.  treatment also prove extremely expensive. Last year United States, family 19-year-old died respiratory failure left US$4.2 million bill 

It also say got transplants, mentioning different patient Wuhan got lung transplant. I’m pretty sure shot staged since guineau pigs don’t drink Tropicana orange juice. Ahhh. seems equates ""A tremendous success..."" then... ""He die directly bullet heart, died oxygen deprivation brain."" 24 hour team i'm sure 2 time coming from. active 24/7/365 saying case everyone. Far it. still reality people though. Personally, I’m still camp I-don’t-ever-want-it. obviously americans failing points There’s another study looked outbreak two cruise ships - one passengers immediately given masks one weren’t (so effectively one control group will).

The mask wearing group significantly less worse outcomes, got infected less asymptomatic.

Edit: link another case study food processing plant  attitude making feel crazy. feel like everyone around enjoying life like things normal, going restaurants bars shopping fun I’m still isolating work grocery pick every week Ya silly seeing people say like ""Fauci said masks!""

No, trying make sure supply health care workers clearly stated 

Because much exposed Bruh. think people died pneumonia already unrelated reasons got covid? still help even though get fired lose two weeks wages homeless. cause death listed, means cause death. 

Please read actual CDC document. lists every single comorbidity cause death. So, again, cause death listed, means sole cause death COVID. 

This facts science nothing dispute man apartment building pointed laughed me. don’t get it. That's broken link. Well think it, Labor Day thanksgiving followed Christmas 🎄 people don’t care follow regular holiday tradition. Really? can't believe it! breaking news! moment history hear news. changes everything! Ill beat shit suggest. long know fear need anything else, right?

It’s hate lust violence brings us down, please keep up. Advocating violence best path failing society. I’m happy share goal you. 

Since seem able advocate violence towards people children, must church goer. attitude jeebus teaches.  Whaddup I’m back  Obviously lol. realize spreads actively avoid things, wearing mask part even though designed benefit, benefit. still shows know what's going things. saying qualifications voting? Right look thousands cases we've found know 35-39 age bracket chances dying 0.029%.

Source - Also wants get sick first place? wrong people? It’s serious personal recurring theme. Nihil novi sub sole. mask helps much, much help used conjunction face shield? Double safety! hope parties barbecues worth it. That’s conspiracy. That’s CDC Florida department health.

Keep bullshit /r/NoNewNormal shit reason milk goes bad bacterial growth, difference still number pathogens well body deal them. Say it. say it. 

What caused 200k extra deaths US pandemic, virus.


Don't coward, say think is. mean definitions it’s currently plague Sadly...to news. punishing everyone possible issues few. Ugh. God damn. must live sad sad life. 1 hour delay fetching comments.

I messaging 29 days [**2020-10-01 00:00:00 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-10-01%2000:00:00%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide  CDC dashboard shows excess death rates associated covid-19, they've removed external deaths (injuries) unknown causes death. perfect, control variables debate work this. don’t know make make sense someone. months data Johns Hopkins &amp; CDC doubters didn’t wouldn’t acknowledge, CDC throws 6% suddenly I’m told “I told so”.SMH. Yep. four days get letter informing child services reviewing child's absences may investigate. faithfully turned doctor's notes still got letters.  don’t think so. think it’s what’s death certificate. well could nuanced that, places pretty rushed it’s like entire country one specific procedure. understand. involved local government position. work home full time though. becuse get laid hates world cuse life horrible  trophy Check google coronavirus map data plotter. New case rates France surpassed previous peak. yes, would call surge.  Okay going logic would mean masks anything necessary would mean Arizona's downward trajectory nothing masks even though everyone about. 

Good news though massive downward fall hospitalization correlates pretty strongly city/county mask mandates. since love anecdotes, actually live Arizona. shop work here. Everyone seemingly wearing masks. Grocery stores, gas stations, retail places. Masks everywhere. mandates came probably 50/50 split; whereas, would estimate 95/5 split low end post-mandate. Sure, could vary city city, mean NOBODY wearing them. again, logic would mean masks ineffective. makes think could ‘hunker down’ over? trying make joke, actually asking - wear mask drive car, even it’s you? mind following up, doc

Remind 45 days No, confusing jack shit.

My grandmother assisted living place years dealing Alzheimers (and later moved memory ward got worse).

In last months visited least 4 patients passed away. no, people absolutely dying, COVID not.

I'm suggesting ""deserve"" die sooner anything. saying Fauci wrong. Think medicine religion.  head church known bigot, makes hard to....  faith. 

Now potus m.d. someone believed science wonders efforts. straight never got mine. got laid missing 19 days row You’re right, sour. Especially school college students, bet much higher 10% could really help colleges places funding contact-tracers 👍  keep seeing this, believe hardcore agree theory. It’s unfortunately complicated lot states. I, example, teach Texas, punishment striking even much joining/creating union terminated license revoked. Meaning lose job, income, health insurance, lose ability ever work field again. considering degree music education, don’t exactly lot options. Like said, lot teachers would strike could, career passion held hostage. goes farther individual districts striking; need complete total reform national Department Education make teachers voice, school boards Yeah, great ourselves. government run ideas ages ago, health minister left currently vacation near Canary Islands yacht (after making money mask respirator purchases), mess. also opening schools today worst preparedness Europe.

We got lucky far thanks quick lockdown helped believe hoax gain power. suppose. :/ That's unfortunate, really position say what's irrational case. &lt;3 Jacinda NZ people. Class 2000! Hate see League City front page Reddit though.... *thumps chest* fuck tryna say bout me? thread. reddit one think correctly. Imagine like Doctor one top field served multiple Presidents simply gives professional recommendation..... world!!!!

The guy hinted drinking cleaners injecting bleach hero doctor reasonable recommendations villain receiving death threats. 

4 years lunacy think civilized nation like Afghanistan/iraq/Mexico send troops overthrow government. confusing nursing home hospice. People hospice dying. grandma nursing home 6 years... seasonal flu wipe nursing homes champ. Lol stupid, extreme people make hard give information. pretend understand undermine message taking literal meaning words using speaker. Lol imagine dumb fool  actual data anecdotes though, serious health concern it’s doomsday deadliest thing earth clickbait articles social media makes be.

Oh is. Look NY NJ. People dying left right. I'm pretty sure people felt like living apocalypse movie.

The rest US builds upon knowledge NY NJ gathered treat severe symptoms thus keep people dying. Would spread whole country March April, US would lost million people, 200k. think greater problem people think flu lump together common cold. Many people say flu fact it’s cold actually influenza, often make people extremely sick. 

So comparison covid flu due similar symptoms really people equating common cold, therefore meant people took much less seriously. count everyone dies **with** virus COVID death, get numbers like this.

And even try tell count like that, [Dr. Birx said reason people complained Sweden ""re-open costs"" pointed Sweden example simply ignore virus go business usual everything work out.

Then Sweden's approach stopped working. disagree ""re-open"" crowd point flaws.

Swedes altered behavior, different culturally American culture begin with, despite regulations. Still American ""re-open"" crowd suggests America return full capacity bars, restaurants, entertainment venues ignore virus. phrases like would certainly alive today. we're talking people serious health problems people 70s 80s beyond can't convince would still today. may still alive might lived another month covid. knows? time peoples side. Lol.

Fired. present math you’re referring to?
 
Or imagining statistics probabilities support claim? I'm custodian. work delivering school supplies Teachers front office. take care 5 lunches!!! top mopping, sweeping, cleaning kids ( 1, 2, 3), every day, oh yeah work sporting events. want get sick bring home family. South America?

Let’s way school without virtual classes too? racist sign? curly hair though. disgusting really. That's one AstraZeneca bringing market, may fast-tracked US regulation.

I'll take it, testing Oxford one, want know signing for. I'm saying they're deserving health care, are, someone ""undocumented"" means country illegally, i.e., citizen. See here's thing. compare flu 2018 COVID mitigation measures place time.

COVID associated 180,000+ deaths, significant pandemic countermeasures place. 2020 far, according CDC, less 7,000 died flu.

If countermeasures place 2018, would 61,000 flu deaths. emphasizes much dangerous (relatively speaking) COVID flu.

With said, think full lockdown necessary given know virus now, definitely downplayed. shield helped lot since 18% got infected wore mask shield. isn’t states. Teachers Canada paid quite well. I'm American fool

Enjoy exorbitantly priced medical bills pretending ""world class""

Chimps easy trick guess really sick seeing misleading anti-US garbage again. I’m US. I’ve tested three times, time received results within 36 hours. true everyone else know tested. 

Some states absolutely need expand testing get better efficiently returning results. That’s debate. However, states top rapid testing reporting literally *months*. Stop taking lowest common denominator standard. can't assume kid fine symptoms. That's we're problem first place. fine, schools keep outbreaks reason wearing masks inside family then? would work whoever brings family.  know it, don’t mind asking? ""This sub aimed information pandemic, debunking misinformation pandemic pointing source said misinformation? That's step far, man!"" There’s science back that. doesn’t help you’re 1000 feet closest person. point it’s safe.

Disclaimer: wear mask I’m going without 50 feet another person, keep one pocket otherwise. I’m hiking park alone, don’t keep on. That’s pointless. rest us then. Hopefully dont infect immunocompromised people rat licking. pro plague lifestyle Yes. much want people voting know they're voting for. Like said. vote count literally even know means? consider tens thousands hundreds thousands lives ""material difference""? Stop claiming "" never going do"" justify nothing destroying economy insane loss life. You’re right course. kind thing allowed ignorant fascist orange hair might get elected. Can’t that. point there. can't believe people never done anything country keep tarnishing legacy one fought independence. even desire become prime minister. wonder wears pants public “Governments want population capable **critical thinking**, want obedient workers, people smart enough run machines dumb enough passively accept situation.” important. That’s people refusing wear selfish jerks. think many Americans decided get normal life back, seeing area life basically back normal. best bet lower spending reduce military budget. Illegal immigration mostly likely decreases amount taxes pay illegal aliens actually pay taxes."
