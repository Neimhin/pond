It's already happening Israel they've stuck 50's% seems working anyway, positivity, hospitalizations deaths dropped cliff:  could try leftover dose canceled appointment makes feel better! Yes, generic drugs things around forever. vaccine disinformation, people know things trust.

As bad sounds, con men exist capitalize large droves times fear. Currently Philippines getting hammered COVID distrust vaccines general ""offbrand Chinese variants"" tested people believe ""unofficial ones"" killing people. disagree conclusion, mean point valid one man humanitarian organization, I’d like know find hordes Brazilian women. going hopping boxcars, or? Naw. Canada’s case issue pfizer interpreted contract ramped production. exploited contract loopholes maximize profits elsewhere Lab studies suggest quite bad South African (B.1.351) variant comes evading vaccines.

For example, Oxford/AZ vaccine, widely-used globally, poor results B.1.351. I'm sure everyone spring break self isolate couple weeks get home. \*Angelina Jolie's double mastectomy entered chat\* I'm taking him. aunt dr seem motivated he's really online himself. do? I’ve never seen might go every two weeks grocery shops.

Even New Zealand go far, there's need arbitary. Asymptomatic spreaders. Enough morons able scaremorgering people instead curing patients. Bible literally says supposed test God expect save one tricks Satan tries pull Jesus desert Agreed. case data useful too. summary then, 

in US, cases fallen 75%, deaths fallen 70%

in UK, cases fallen 90%, deaths fallen 94%.

So *death decline* running ahead *cases decline* UK. perhaps evidence vaccine effect (versus lockdown effect). don’t understand laws accommodations? Neither South Korea Japan lockdown. That's UK it. could find authentic one small faces, that’d great. One size definitely doesn’t fit all. Yes, but... cant find article now, said booster shot trials done previously immunized people. booster group placebo group fully vaccinated standard vaccination. previous versions vaccines almost certainly protection new variants. Efficacy could take much much longer establish. doesnt seem like bad outcome, immunity wanes along rise variants, may another time crunch.

Another alternative test boosters unvaccinated groups, much harder recruit effective vaccines exist. even allowed ethical standards. Dubya Bush whole “Texas idiot” persona. smarter let on, set bar low easy. Edit: downvoted. It’s truth. 

This social media. like truth around here! KN95 =/= N95 Okay maybe get anti-vaccines (not really though) anti-lockdown. completely fucking stupid selfish anti-mask??

It can’t hurt you. There’s mechanism govt controlling there. It’s dumbest shit I’ve ever seen life. pathetic examples puppets bad actors even imagine. sad hear state Brazil. hope gets removed force. Please apologize English, pretty great! clearly good student! paid time lockdown first time?

That seem case lot poor countries, makes effective lockdown impossible. see CDC website? see CDC website? Enjoy banned! Hahahahahahah

That’ll teach pushing anti-vac, anti-science agenda factual subreddit. Begone troll, back Fox News  better value price. reused N95 works better brand new KN95 performs way advertised proficiency (NIOSH tested KN95s actually filter 35% vs advertised 95%). brand new N95 filter 95% reused one retained basic structure probably functions around 90-94%. pretty sure calling people name faux pas days see comment thread detailing ""huge"" surges places like wyoming going 2 cases 3 (50% INCREASE SINCE YESTERDAY) terrifying. America, confirmation bias clouded judgement. Kids protected virus, see children affected covid like places. restrictions place seemed help. count first dose, complete dose Thanks tearing like votes. I'm learn like hope are. I'm boat. kid 6 willingly make science experiment creeps out. agree MAY better actual virus though. say idea mRNA vaccines long term? thought relatively new widespread, unless I'm wrong? That’s killed lot young people 1918 flu pandemic well. EU contract specifically states Initial European Doses (ie 300M ordered front) manufactured within EU. It’s clause 5.1. Production contracts outside EU therefore can’t conflict. Contrary UVdL claims every legal analysis seen confirms 5.4 (which talks Uk factories) applies additional optional doses pre-approval Uk factories requirement use initial doses - fact 5.1 clear doesn’t. 

AZ massively behind supplying UK well - something rarely mentioned. meant 30M doses 2020 got 4M. Uk chose recognise production issues go blame game route. Production challenges UK spite us signing vaccine supplies May (under original licensing agreement) 3 month head start production. Vaccine supply conveyor belt process. 

AZ way behind schedule conspiracy theories vitriol around beyond joke now. big pharma company making profit vaccine moment. said PR department hopeless. found weird too. 50% fully vaccinated star trek  Ok, good, thanks considering flying Mississippi shot. checked CVS NJ, vaccines still strong limitations, zero appointments. Mississippi, free all, tens appointments week. get mine. like KN95 headband. Papers, please. data anomaly reporting I've vaccinated. still show passport anyone. Yeah get mean motive good, lot social engineering going on. might seem totally cool thing say, additive effects information transferred population eventually goes ""the vaccine side effects take rare extreme side effects"" ""the vaccine really bad side effects worth taking it."" 

This reason growing trend population decided take it. things influence behavior getting vaccine combination perceived benefits stack response effort/risks ""negative side effect"" overstated general public perception, people actually get vaccine. know study reading, imo *partially* educated (for example, person poor critical thinking skills studies light subject second-rate college) even dangerous completely uneducated. goes double someone partially educated spends time people education, get accustomed idea they're smarter everyone else.

I relative fits pattern exactly. teacher went college two years complete anti-vaxxer thinks covid ""scamdemic""; generally ignorant lot things insists knows everything. *Exactly* like Peggy King Hill. husband finish high school reads books, takes virus seriously, got vaccinated soon eligible, generally follows good advice. knows he's smart life (and politically incorrect 1960s teachers) drummed fact head again, defers people know better.

A lot redditors YouTube political ""experts"" exemplify too. Okay again..you missed. I'll enjoy beer fail realize B1.135 first documented July South Africa, competing highly transmissible variants B.117 time

What would take get 25-35k per day? Oh god! Really??? Wow, sounds like information back claim baseless speculation That’s unique [We seem is, big town South Korea US first official case day, believe it?

The US plenty time formulate working response chose sort serious tracking know turned out. None severely ill? 

Someone can’t read basic charts.

And OT severely ill, many spread 73% population yet vaccine. average person spends 2.2 years nursing home. check go home. Unless mean heavenly home many go there. better getting Putin's bad side. issue localised brexiteers anymore.

Already plans meet them. least we've facetime. noticed deleted comment I'd already written response is.


Firstly way around. Enough cases overwhelms hospital capacity space patients. hospitals diabolical state full are. run ICU beds can't treat covid cases condition requires emergency care. I'm saying controversial, well established fact. Brazil's hospitals pretty much full limited restrictions going change. Currently Brazil highest number covid deaths per day globally. 

Cases Mexico started decline, Brazil sky rocketing. Deaths also skyrocketing Brazil compared countries, including Easteen Europe. 

The infectious P1 strain expected dominant Brazil circulating long time. was  detected within Mexico end January become dominant. 

Brazil currently vaccinated 8.01 per 100 people, slightly better Mexico's 5.03. much lower compared countries also high death toll (14.94 EU, 47.62 UK, 40.87 US). India well vaccinations (4.21 per 100) large vaccine supply, Brazil not. make clear enough I'm talking worst country world right now. end highly likely Brazil worst affected carries way. also said 1/4 world's daily deaths currently. agree theory practice, people around supposed know vaccinated (and someone feel like wearing mask)?

This important people risk need actively avoid could potentially spread them.

1) J&amp;J study determine giving second dose increases efficacy. 

2) study going UK determine happens mix match doses (in case AstraZeneca Pfizer). 

The likely thing happens J&amp;J shows increased efficacy recommend people get second dose. Even though AZ J&amp;J vaccines use technology, doubt recommending using mRNA vaccine second dose J&amp;J. Sounds like experience doses... day after, felt like I'd late partying night before. Felt totally fine 2nd day, though. course do... UK variant enters chat French &amp; Lucky Strike Exactly. Unless spending long time someone makes zero sense. half million died? Trumps competence? Also, where’d 100 million missing shots go aside lining pockets sure? varies person person, side effects sore arm minor headache. vulnerable person, I'm OK people refusing vaccinated. balance private inconvenience public risk. example, someone active TB, can't legally walk around public. detained quarantined, treated. getting bus baby board could kill baby, airborne contagious dangerous young. covid-19 mutates serious lethality, like Ebola, quickly new laws requiring vaccines negative tests public. Germany never hard lockdown. 

So everything, like schools, cinemas, hairdressers, fitness studios, etc. pp, consistently open last 12 months? sure actually talking Germany there?

Because [another claimed: Im Germany like 1/2 3/5 people see supermarkt using FFP2 masks

Which **absolutely** wrong, least Bavaria. seen anybody without mask supermarket *at least* half year, likely even longer honestly can't even remember last time saw somebody without mask supermarket pandemic.

And [another admit even speaking German, even properly understanding now? Sorry following Germany's ruling mess even speak German.

Yet making claims like ""Germany never hard lockdown"", could able judge admittedly even understand restrictions currently place? you’re saying spike? data? Probably due old, delay, would interested. Call protest. winter. Spring break. covid right? everyone team, work years average. money last whole lives. Lebron. Even salary 5 million dollars, half taken taxes still mortgage.
The minimum 1.4 million get injured play anymore, lasts year. Since many guys go right high school, career fall back on.

I'm crying tears rich guys, plenty vaccine point, they're traveling USA mixing teams states. exposed far know of. Husband WFH. Thanks advice! I'm still feeling bad tomorrow, I'll definitely get tested figure delay vaccine dose.

Luckily I'm low risk individual, concern getting official go-ahead quarantine household. Yeah youtube comments shidshow Yea it’s Joe leading covid charge /s pro-vaxx propaganda that's drowning website past 2 years?

I'll take ban honest question freely speaking mind now. question. wonder (out loud) people celebrating getting together still contract transmit virus, particularly vaccinated? Unless told incorrect - vaccinated people cannot spread virus. It’s weird virtue-signaling cus hermit nature praised year. 

Us planet earth who’ve locked fucking year close fully vaccinated going. back. to. real. life. 

Enoughhhh fear-mongering bullshit. Jesussss Christtttt. lot poorer countries bad registering deaths general, much less covid deaths. track mortality, necessarily release timely fashion.

India, example, takes years release data. little data they've released certain regions sometimes, implausibly, claims deaths actually *decreased* 2020. There's basically way calculate excess mortality. ""image"" Sweden, defending fundamental freedom western civilization China worshippers want lock us down. feel you. “overseas American” myself, perception America given time tangible effects you’re received. 

I remember times passport meant invincible. also remember times passport meant target. I’ve seen studies stating Vitamin deficiencies create severe health issues, exactly debunked? Aha. answer right front face, usual. Thank you. underrated comment! *What ever living fuck WRONG people?* US Intelligence Community countering disinformation harmful US ctizens always. 
Phillipines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Mexico, African continent ect.

The workable solution vaccinated many people get [The CDC's data says 7-day moving average deaths US hit 991 Friday, first time since November 9th gone 1,000.

Confiscate Arstotzcan vaccine passports. vaccinated dying covid report names recognize Mercola (obviously, skeptics community well aware years BS) and...RFK Jr? vaccinated, worry much transmitting covid unless symptomatic. rare, possible.

As masks, personally plan make fuss getting vaccinated. still mask mandate absurd scenario like 10 deaths day nationally, might start caring. hear you. It’s really “hindsight 20/20” thing though given timing learnings Israel.

The logistics supply thing big question mark here. knew promised, would get us carried risk. best hedge go guidance vs risk botching operation doses didn’t come through. persecuted blessed, look back history Never trust man can't comb hair tv appearances.

Vaccinating NBA players month advance key step toward opening NBA games full capacity vaccinated fans. turn important states pushing higher vaccination levels ending pandemic.

Each state's design dumber inefficient last, technically know created vaccination prevented spread almost completely. do, really need rework every priority stop deaths, end pandemic sooner. means prioritizing greater risk creating spread country prepares start partying. need vaccinating professional athletes ASAP. obvious step moment learned vaccination prevents spread. two examples listed still really common - would judgemental acknowledging that? 

I’ll add another, distance, normal travel methods carry increased risk. stupid reach herd immunity one way another. question final body count? vaccines drastically lower chance transmission. 90 percent. impossible? No. super unlikely, live immunocompromised unvaccinated people still worth careful, still unlikely.

I wish DNA replication error correction elephants. would awesome. Well certainly *a* reason, one. Conservatives really want lifestyle change insofar tell, many (definitely American conservatives) would actually like see regression/rollback certain changes. Combating climate change Covid require significant lifestyle changes sacrifices; things conservatives willing change/give up. new Covid variants much contagious. means young people infected end hospital severe cases eventually die.

This already known clearly see reported numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

There inconsistent news, certain variants also cause higher percentage severe cases among infected, even without that, much people end intensive care die much get infected compared old Covid variant.

Because that, current wave easily become worst one far speed vaccinations significantly. protecting old high risc groups longer enough prevent health system getting overwhelmed. Trump liberal though. Far right follow Guess gotta postpone Brazil vacation next year year after. knows President would it. might sell vaccines November, seems Australia also low deaths 2020, makes perfect sense. *know* normal flu season coronavirus restrictions.

I think places like Iceland, New Zealand, Taiwan Singapore (to name few) would also fewer deaths. know J&amp;J approved you? must agree gets credit calling virus big deal. huge mistake! Antibiotics work directly attacking bacteria, either breaking cell wall interfering DNA/protein synthesis. bacteria survive may certain traits make resistant antibiotics, time they'll replicate become new strain.

This quite different mechanism action vaccines, people thread expanded upon. What’s motive? like couple months since good n95s back stock US that? UK vaccination effort awesome (and I'm totally jealous), able set still EU. mRNA vaccines proving effective like winning lottery quickly tweak design account variants slip new version production queue Thanks, kind dick Title leaving out. AZ problem waste water sample 2019 collected non-covid related means. stored site, plenty opportunity plant operators mix otherwise contamint fresher influent. Cries European Union can't believe it! Shocking! one saw coming!!!!! Right UK spends money two small plants places order pharma company. EU proclaims open worldwide vaccine production starts talking vaccine bans starts taking vaccines countries paid for. untrustworthy one here? bribe, share land border Ireland UK Ireland 'common travel area' agreement. come word soup.

I mean infection rates Germany still lower US Hahahaaa amazing Absolutely stupid unnecessary Man saw pictures people partying streets Madrid like pandemic over. really semi-lockdown? you’re within driving distance another state, check see you’d eligible anywhere state. 

Examples:

Missouri- allowing people states vaccinated sites receiving vaccines directly federal government provided would otherwise eligible Missouri vaccine plan. 

Oklahoma- Choctaw Osage Tribal Nations offering vaccines public. tribal nations same, require Oklahoma residency.  Papers required stores closed France clothing/shoe stores. Everything business usual 6am - 7pm. They're issuing Japanese people/permanent residents Japan individuals travel abroad countries require vaccine passport. announcement they're opening vaccinated travelers overseas. Tourists still banned, vaccinated not. Bloody hell, year pandemic, people still get it.

It's risk one person. right, accept risk, many things. 

It's overloading healthcare system. hospitals full, *noone* get medical care anymore. Car accidents, heart attacks, births, cancer operations, etc, etc. result orders magnitude deaths COVID ever could.

And think live first-world country good medical system, happen. Exponential growth rate would overwhelm best healthcare systems. maths yourself. Time reach capacity = log(total hospital capacity/current hospitalised patients) / log(R_e). he's terrible fit definition genocide. 
What talking abuot? effectively shut social life restaurants, cafes, gyms, museums, theaters, movie theaters leisure activities closing down. Good loving family go home to, many people lives standby since November taking toll people. bit empathy  realistic situation Long term? when? extremely rare. Vaccines protect falling ill, getting infected. Stop downvoting people trying warn unresponsible. seen news yesterday? long though? can’t see places requiring vaccinations passports five years now. Ok stop end? much worse would be? happy all.

My parents hated seeing grandchildren messenger 111 days lockdown last year, can't imagine bad must American grandparents wait ❤ kinda lucked work. I’m afraid symptoms thing i'm gonna miss pandemic ability take naps meetings. Nit quite true, cases younger people increased throught august september. Although believe largely due university students returning. almost guarantee using sunscreen much worse whatever carcinogens exist popular sun screens. issue studies make claims carcinogens without putting context. Yeah? I'm down. Lets media sources well spread disinformation daily. Papers, please. agree. Equal distribution (by EU whatever, idc) would help prevent Hotspots therefore new mutations. I’m afraid mutations might danger us... talk vaccines, rightly so, decent known treatment would real key reopening. Hopefully trials like find humanities sake I’m planning something July, I’m going decide whether keep close go bust little closer time. honestly don’t know living like hermit affected me, I’m going allow month experimentation vaccination see I’m cool damaged. don’t wanna book trip feel scared whole time. 

Def *something*, though. Need summer! I'm really sorry hear this. bet grandma great lady. misleading headline. People still getting infected nursing homes problem vaccinations haven’t helped.  


If staff refuse vaccinated, need replaced. not? It’s interesting. know people admitted flu

I answer work Microbiology lab (in UK) - anybody suspected coming A&amp;E (the Equivalent ER) respiratory illness tested multiple pathogens. Since beginning October 2020 approximately 100 patients day - 15,000 end February

Covid positives accounted 7 35% tests time (Peaking higher number early January 2021), around 1% tested positive Rhinovirus (common cold). 15,000 samples number Influenza positives Zero.

Why? Several theories - people taking precautions hand washing masks, much less international travel meant low numbers Southern Hemisphere winter - subsequently almost cases Northern Hemisphere ours. 

A negative almost circulating strains influenza, difficult know put years flu vaccine. screening question application nursing/medical school ""What stance vaccinations?""

Anti-vaxxers denied admittance. believe basic life-saving scientific discoveries belong healthcare. Yup! reason you’ll find LGBT people big cities rural places too. Florida, difference city rural could clear. big cities mask mandates, rural places fought mask mandates. difference shock me. best heroin Wendy's! Italy lot fake news social vaxx. lot people trust them. sad know That's great, guess people 40 getting Novavax since AZ Pfizer doses reserved second doses. go idea one mutation making vaccines 0% effective. Better nate lever* Novavax fully online impact supplies dramatically. supposed ramp 1.5 million week May. Lucky uk suffering lockdown since January. Maybe government done would coming lockfown...your one positive vaccines becoming available more. death rate low. actually dumb people incredibly pessimistic date would reach herd immunity.

140,000,000 doses, 42 percent atleast one shot.

If keep going 3 million plus day (incredibly likely considering J&amp;J), would reach 210,000,000 (the population adults 18 US) around April 20th, 63% atleast one shot.. keep going May 8th that’s 265,000,000 vaccinated, 80 percent people US fully vaccinated, according machine learning 21.5 percent people virus... like actually dumb possible almost done like mid May-Early June? Obviously like hesitancy happen vaccine not, still seems like overwhelmingly amount people vaccine like May? J&amp;J probably bump numbers too.. optimistic everyone pessimistic. American King County sounds familiar - wasn’t place first broke badly US?  - accurately - first place managed test prove outbreak?

Might climate + high rates travel + good public health + citizens engaged enough get tested. wait Indy 500. Even allow 50% capacity, still 125,000 people together 8 hours. we're actually sure that's true, look Israel even asymptomatic infections falling 12 million stockpile. soon vaccine ban started threatened stopped first doses ensure enough supply 2nd doses.

Delaying 1st doses 50s cause far less deaths delaying 2nd doses 50s. vaccine expiry date don’t think would waste time transporting sea Please fuck off. Covid going anywhere. never eradicated lifetime. people get covid thats them. People lives get back to. People lost jobs, businesses livelihoods. pretty ironic, lost last job needed move back grandparents, couldnt afford small flat anymore.

They vaccinated hope find job soo move again. Im even willing get infected give job, already lost 1 year retirement now.

And people dont understand eithter students still living parents (or live University home) people never lost job home office.

Its easy say health money money enough survive lol. know plenty students following model UK. hard. Why? trust data presented graph made creyons?

Test theat used even validate. trust ""science"" none fundamental principles adhered to? “There’s single large populated country currently state covid lockdown United States is.” 
You undefined parameters there.
Large - define it. 
Populated - somehow equivalent large, you’re going need define it.
State lockdown - terms following guidelines simply guidelines?
United States - nothing United states pandemic, aside getting screwed federal government comes getting help federal administration would typically provide.

Secondly, using “large” mean landmass “populated” within certain % States’ population, you’ve locked US category almost itself. Probably comparable Russia, China, India, Brazil.
At point, you’re comparing political administrations since none countries used healthcare-guided approach dealing health crisis. AZ vaccine already approved countries perhaps don’t high bar

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Scary read that. hope keeping covids way! vaccinated? week ago labeled conspiracy theorist evening mentioning immune escape. still investigation.

The found vaccines delivered Belgium, clear final destination was. Imagine thinking preventing peoples death wearing mask imposing rights human? morons. 

Have respect decency people. sure hell bet heart attack cancer rely heavily people think opposing. can't really say ""poor countries"" use india example they're 2nd largest world. family actual poor country (india poor...) ok lockdowns government sent food/gas/water trucks neighborhoods That's like 3.5 canada's 28 new zealand's. morning Nottinghamshire bookings opened anyone 40, mistake turned hours. honoured bookings already done. Anyone severe back pain second shot Pfizer? Along almost constant vomiting 102 fever? issues first shot. I’m worried back pain isn’t “normal immune response” would expect someone get vaccinated September, mean need 3 doses?

2 normal doses plus booster? vote. I’m gonna go ahead venture guess you’re data scientist. science suggests many months potentially couple years. vaccines joke. anti-vaxxers France agree vaccines work, think adjuvents toxic give alzheimer's, unneccessary trick BigPharma take money. 

This may french issue, hepatitis B vaccine fiasco 90s, wanted get us vaccinated, eventually vaccination plan stopped tracks proved unnecessary.

Anywho, getting medecine feel fine always raise issues people analyse world emotional reasoning (that's when, feel it, real, holds weight factual evidence align feel instant). rise deaths? lol Ireland like worst example island nation could use. even whole island... Presumably probability mutation remains high till unvaccinated people weak immune systems exist anywhere world. Theoretically mutation completely evades vaccines develops starts spreading world, vaccine efforts become pointless.

Also poorer countries pretty bad records testing properly recording covid deaths hard accurately judge spread disease there. actually proper reporting would take serious hit people say flu. Ebola 21 when? AZ delivered EU contract Johnson boasted capitalism triumphed. Oh wow... NI’s google covid results must show UK then. mistake need use daily work/shop. Hey, still received mine. spare. Disgusting self centered ego driven humans. Always go fun. Easter next weekend it? government supplies free charge, sure. I'm quite content cheap £10 4 reusable snoods otherwise, thanks tho. too! I'm flying California June visit dad seen since January 2020. We'll fully vaccinated then. father won’t get either. honestly words. would've thunk? France seems better states. countries real success able shut borders hold vaccine created. US Covid cases declining months, would've without restrictions, countries stricter restrictions. never, never, able stop influenza type virus already global scale. never possible done politicians could save face government organizations could save funding. Smokers actually less burden healthcare systems die earlier Thanks, dude. Ableist garbage. one ""beats"" sickness. sign strength. That's great news, although DailyMail saying going 500k doses. guess anything welcome though. Hopefully see Novavax approval soon well.  Love honesty!  lmao reddit moment run tourism outside Chinese strategy eradication destroy outbreaks size hundred work. Let's real, politically able go alone EU. stayed tried that, may well left anyway. 

Would possible? Sure? Plausible? No. virus ends eventually becoming endemic reaching herd immunity infections (if vaccines aren’t available), doesn’t really help happens three months later. sad life living :( Nooo send brazilll!. way could vote world president allow nations control elections jurisdictions. Even China agreed list every candidate, could require every person vote, could run state sponsored pro-Xi propaganda campaign beforehand could give ballots election, intended vote Xi get red ballot. candidates get blue ballot.

Set check points make sure criminals suspected criminals vote check points also verify people ballots them.

Everyone blue ballot gets stopped suspected foreign agitator gets instant re-education, screamed at, roughed sent back line everyone line screaming shaming them.

If individuals come back another blue ballot really foreign agitators trying disrupt Democratic People’s Voting process they’re arrested.

End result China 99.5% turnout 99.97% votes Xi, protest votes probably get through.

China also runs campaigns Africa, Asia, South America. outspent America, Chinese focus country know build economies lift people poverty, America selfish looking exploit world gain, drone anyone stands it.

End result Xi wins plurality world president, candidate India coming distant second. China also participate voting first past post. someone politically naive bribe. Incidentally proposal already floated months ago Irish PM basically said send COvAX countries. Pro tip , want appear political tell media political motivations. UK transparent window. Ah thanks, thought moderna new one talked last week. Lucky! dumbass family refuses get it! “But muh 5G!” thought funny ridiculous people saying this. mother 😔 joke. common sense can’t process exponential growth, shouldn’t trust area. Countries, regardless well (or well) they’ve handled pandemic right procure vaccines. They’re rush vaccinate they’re going vaccinate citizens regardless. Tens hundreds thousands flu tests administered US year: great sample size you’re trying estimate prevalence population. Look Nobel-prize winning inventor PCR test say Fauci get back me. info AstraZeneca 1 shot? Curious, business travel stays severely dropped, mean it'll less expensive people travel see friends vacation No. Shit. Sherlock. Except there's frequent ferries UK Ireland New Zealand literally 1.300 miles coast. New Zealand completely isolated rest world, thing restrict air travel. comparable Iceland. I'm french, follow recommendations french government restrictions, listen french healthcare workers *beg* us wear masks social distance.

The countries people actually followed restrictions lockdowns loop, New Zealand Australia. Japan applying testing approach addition pretty effectively curve *declining*. Breaking news:

Road wet rain! friends Philippines said little lockdown. They're rich expat area, they've allowed go pool park go vacations. Think bigger issue hard lockdown like 9 going 10 months. can’t ask people keep over. They’re headless chickens.

Germany deal shit planning shut preaching others. actually psychotic. Eastern Europe? Way generalize half continent. Eastern European countries even ICU beds per capite France Italy. 

The worst affected region Africa. countries anyone needing oxygen died. lab confirmed cases record yet testing? assertion one dumbest things heard fair while. Moderna made Switzerland filled various EU countries. Novavax one made UK. Supply Moderna solid never heard mentioning EU ever considering Moderna shipment (all non-US Moderna doses made Europe) “People 18-25 age group also filling hospital beds infected virus. Orange County reported Thursday people age 45 account one-third COVID-19 hospitalizations.”

What fuck kind jive Juke reporting this? subject paragraph 18-25 year olds, people 45? God damn it’d nice know actual hospitalization rate 18-25 year old is, wouldn’t it? Yes really dont understand reproductive rates you. 

If controls put flu reproduction rate 1 rapidly dies out, controls easily leave transmissible rate 1 get exponential growth.

September insultingly late Wendy using lunch money buy heroin? Probably not, know? want lunch money going drugs! Who's taking drugs? would point? I'm asking questions! see one friend choose one vaccinated works healthcare seen handful friends past 10 days, one vaccinated works home recent social interactions? fully vaccinated live late 50s parents yet. Or, continue ""enjoy"" parents' company risk losing mind? God Yeah except happening places substantially pulled back restrictions cutting argument. Spring breakers silly things pandemic!?! Never. Florida? clearly could Florida! Spreading virus? shame. spring breakers large study groups preparing exams. remember downvoted hell sub month ago saying woods yet vaccine saying mean cases increase again. everyone access vaccines chooses get one, think morally acceptable punish allowing participate society, worse yet allow *nobody* participate society. That's coercion collective punishment.

This whole thing originally preventing hospitals overwhelmed preventing people infected will. never eradicating COVID preventing every possible COVID death. Body autonomy important COVID. ying. yang sick, sick think say. I've wanted go Megacon ever since like 2013 never panned try save enough so. taking granted year. Hopefully April 5th vaccine holds well variants fuck us journalism necessary democratic constitutional state,"" Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus said.

So open commerce, freedom association, freedom practice religion, are. reasonable blame grass fires next highway drought conditions *and* jackass flicking cigarette butt window. got first shot week ago would personally take 3 months long covid right go school person maybe Comic-Con. Clustering cases specific geographic location could also point local outside factor surely UK used limited supply well. chosen concentrate using 30M doses (doses used far) getting smaller number people double-dosed (as per US strategy) 10 -15 million would missed altogether. ongoing supply limited, problem would lot bigger now. lying? Cases up, hospitalizations up, deaths flat. Ignoring pandemic make go away. Strawman argument.

HIV spread via air saliva. 

Try again.  People definitely party, think way overblown. People get shit systems pretty quick. June + July lit. guess late joiners dreaded club ""I know someone died covid19"". husband's colleagues family acquaintance family member, one met per say.

Somehow today learn father one son's closest friend (in 4th grade) loving across street us moved (never made connection) died 2 days Christmas. Due remote learning son get chance talk friend even though remote classroom.

 also time son gotten knee surgery, found vascular tumor lower thigh/upper knee area (thankfully begnign, let say mind quite concerned around time well). almost feel horrible back son talking surgeries (first biopsy removal tumor), showing scar everyone caring friend going much worse (he also grandma hospitalized 10 days time, luckily made it) sitting silent. known would told son gather everyone sympathy actively back (I suppose teacher school limiting conversation anyone private life zoom learning hours, especially something tragic, even though highly doubt kid mind attend class mentally, went back person January son stayed remote).

Worse thing found accident. truly shocked. 34 years old lovely dad kids. son friends sister staying moms (parents divorced time) still attend schools town rest year probably go wherever mother lives (a town nearby). 

Anyway ruined day idea tell son. would bet lifesavings day hit 50% adults vaccinated still find reason keep restrictions around. happens state vaccinated? go shows NY? someone putting vacation foreign country putting ""lives"" hold? Personally think there's safety reason PAX East can't happen soon June, without masks distancing. states offering shots adults month time happens. want vaccine, that's fine, I'm going give normal life prevent getting sick- see big controversy. That's awesome dude, hard time getting friends join adventures, ""I prefer sitting inside watching Netflix"" types hope people open fun numbers legit one would manipulate reddit! even money! aren’t considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks first dose. number people fully vaccinated end April however many first dose last Wednesday (which think ballpark 80 million). 

Even don’t count extra 2 weeks end, you’ll get first shot within next week half get second dose end April. assume it’s around 2 million new first doses day then, bit 100 million.  I’m saying 5000 new infections good thing. responding quote shared, that’s all. yea makes sense, probably level typical flu vaccine right now. least die go hospital get it. Tell Canada us... Telling “mask up” makes want cough risk person find... I’m tired told isn’t “over” fucking shit. even end goal see realized??  Forth wave case wise, sure. Death wise, doubt it. I'm quite I'm extra production shutting completely killed side gig lol hedged bit saying ""at worst"". head head comparison one dose Pfizer vs. JnJ want oversell it. regardless, study shown &lt;70% efficacy Pfizer vaccine 14 days first dose - even biased towards elderly populations likely weakest immune response single dose. yes, *likely* one dose mRNA vaccine better JnJ vaccine, without head head study difficult compare. sure October? first known case world November. True Marion County projected reach herd immunity mid May early June *Ted Coup care everyone getting fully vaccinated. long everyone opportunity schedule shot. I'm wearing mask people want vaccine I'm carrying around vaccine passport prove I'm going infect people get shot. redditors act like amazing anti-prejudice heroes second modern day apartheid gets implemented becomes “Hail Science!”


I can’t take people downvoting seriously anymore. government told walk cliff would. They’re lemmings. Careful, stating facts get heavily downvoted land liking negative news. understand that. would never try censor people's opinions disagree (unless dangerous course). 

No problem all, too. Hope nice evening :) hope so, favorite bars could still half full Friday even Saturday night - want see people floor I'm means critizising measurements danger Covid is. Covid x times dangerous flu. objectively, coming less 19 deaths per day amazing completely normal range. Therefore, 19 Covid deaths compared tens hundreds saved flu, actually amazing one fully fascinated weeks, know what's holding everyone else up. believe fascination supply shortage? majorities right even want vaccine cause they're still brainwashed false conspiracies including microchips bodies? crazy normalizing sort thing.  
Signed,  
Fully Vaccinated Individual COVID test 100% accurate, could still hundred infected slip by. need vaccinate people fight bug without problems, much less need swab shoved nose even know thing. New York eligible receive vaccine already. interesting hear long expect use app, mention created app. 

Some mentioned pass expires 90 days, knows happens then. things go downhill restrictions even shutdowns come back, seems like would waste. Except Coronavirus poses significant long-term threat vaccinated. become less dangerous equivalent flu. see vaccination cards become virtue signaling year two quickly dying people realize ""Hey really threat anymore. really deadly anymore."" county fully renovated HVAC well installed high flow filtration class rooms, take years man. teachers fully vaccinated well. Im loling you, there’s difference there. I’m upset, feel better ways express without ignoring upsetting people effected topic. laughing nothin that. refuse vaccinate, giving optional activities. 

You don’t ever need go plane vacation. don’t need eat restaurant. don’t ever need go cruise ship. Michigan back November levels infection setting repeat December January. states may joining soon. Forth wave looking likely states clank hard.

And yeah want that. Lock downs hard. dying. like things prolonged periods time. supply basically unlimited vaccinate entire population matters weeks probably beat many nations herd immunity. mine ffs said wear mask crowed. hard.  Testing see r/coronavirus really allow got mine yesterday partner surprised / disappointed aren’t given cookie afterwards. She’s still getting shot think folks underestimate small incentive remain motivator folks Nursing home hospitalizations deaths way down. working. *Cries Canadian/French/Belgian/XYZ*

Are done comment thread now? you’re describing logical fallacy ignore rule large numbers. Covid infectious flu higher death rate, even though science community made incredible strides lowering number. couple months ago people dying every day died 911 20 years later take time memorialize 2,753 human lives lost(rightfully so) waiting vaccine distributed high risk populations deaths control. want something more.

It seems like implying *have* brought deaths control. However, still around 1000 deaths per day. That's 9/11 every three days.  nope Well, Ted Cruz go Mexico, alone tells stupid fucks fleeing south. believe study UK Pfizer first dose gets like 80% 2 weeks, even better JnJ  agree, see reason announced yet. NY done decent job vaccinating. ahead Texas Florida right supply used ahead California total percentages population given shot. need wait announcement. everything US. Many countries successfully lockdowns (or areas within countries). higher numbers overall (not new cases, overall) doesn’t mean hasn’t effective. haha no. live south? What? No. 

Re read that, try again. maybe clarify mean. can't wait fully vaccinated, going like flood gates opening lol  Okay. think that's I'm trying do, adding context news feel valid.

It equally valid feel otherwise. that's thing message board; I'm allowed post contrary opinions even OP disagrees.

Thanks civil reading responses. You’re obviously optimist believes everyone eligible vaccine ready access one get one.

The last year taught mUh fReEdOmS important fellow man vaccine skepticism (at point) extension that.

So yeah, think vaccine passports definitely thing. least covid’s prevalence on-par seasonal flu. Got first shot moderna yesterday. Can’t wait fully vaccinated go get haircut can’t even explain utterly ridiculous fully vaccinated crowd mask distance? fuck?? guess idea steady improvement out, 1000/day upper limit doesn’t get exceeded. guess I’ll change statement “The Vulnerable Protected” “The Vulnerable close protected, *significantly* less risk decided shut down”. 

If I’m honest, don’t entirely disagree idea giving one month- *truly, one month*. believe many people here, particularly young, risk averse 20 year olds, believe need keep society closed risk eliminated. case. may part excess indirect missed cancer diagnostics, cancelled surgeries. respiratory illness way normal day year, flu zero many countries. Allegedly wet government makes requirement becomes first amendment violation. Well, 18 families. Uncle Alf wrong'un. That’s great. Lockdowns implemented well many countries worked perfectly well. know damn well plenty people subreddit would cheer clap idea vaccine passports want vote, they'd scream people question ""Just want kill grandma."" Stay inside rest life then. enjoy shaming rest human race shut-ins left sub. way protective, glad *something*. right life get harder without vaccine eventually. find odd upset terminology pandemic laughing loud. That's way disrespectful someone saying less deaths brilliant. current messaging people vaccinated need keep following guidelines anyway. much would change volunteers lol. **Literally one** refers Mexicans Americans.

I mean obviously learning wrong pretending meant ""only folks Reddit"".

Stop swinging dick around admit realize thing. say bad people dying. Yeah don’t know downvoted, agreeing me. think responded wrong comment  Ok, Norwegian rule thumb 1% EU deliveries extrapolated ~1m we’re getting. still quite lot though considering 1-shot vaccine. That's speculation. logic implies prices gone pandemic, that's happened. Vaccine numbers propaganda? 

Government failures need analysed future think trying force agenda making big deal thread No, Portugal's case 3 months. Upside went worst currently best region world cases deaths per capita. Lol even talking about, certainly true. Couple things:

I think little bit chicken egg - think people feel normalcy masks gone think masks gone people feel like normal. masks disappear phases, take time.

I'm less optimistic numbers think. Nationally I'd kind surprised hit 1 per 100K (which seems magic number people want) end year. virus simply transmissible many people vaccinated (and be). post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

I know internet allergic nuance fact one bad thing happening world time, particularly parts developing world many preventable health complications remain common. Trying pretend game pro-lockdown anti-lockdown really helpful addressing really complex Heartbreaking. Sorry loss. absolutely critisise Government handling pandemic. let fantastic vaccine programme going blind inept leadership past 12 months There’s also going lot trauma living constant fear year. 

Like, think it. Unless never cared, every second lives pretty much devoted getting COVID. grab mask leave house don’t want get COVID. get bus wave driver behind glass panel protects COVID. sit down, careful get close strangers might COVID. get work wear mask sanitize everything every thirty minutes dodge people dick-nosing masks COVID. go home talk friends discord knows, someone might COVID. 

It’s exhausting. It’s inhuman. went loving crowds petrified others shit. It’s something I’m going wake one day get over. shit long-term. I’m sorry loss. Hugs you. Really East Asia (apart China), Australia New Zealand avoid blame. Choctaw Chickasaw nations Oklahoma. Chickasaw Nation opened vaccinations anybody state already too.

Tribal nations really done good job vaccinating members. think weird every time cases go down, attributed vaccine, every time go up, variants. basically factors 2020, yet cases fluctuated wildly sometimes. other, important factors consider looking we're doing. Whoa!. believe virus czar getting ahead here. reckless loosening restrictions like led Europe's 4th wave infections death. public lied regular basis party leaders, lose trust there. 

Placing CDC instead Fox republicans disingenuous. What? Ah suddenly it’s Biontech, sone bad news. Otherwise it’s always Pfizer. lol Ah well. Sorry looking numbers without PhD. Makes sense, ease mind think reasonable that, everyone follow buy eBay. 

Mine lot cheaper (about $0.25 each), material still seems pretty thick, combined mask brace (hope) there's nothing terribly wrong. companies holding supply make money boosters count deaths COVID there's trace COVID system. Hit car asymptomatic COVID? well done sir, latest victim pandemic. Drowned sea bad cough positive COVID? RIP sweet angel, can't believe COVID took 😞. 

Not sure still counted like now, time last year deaths occurred. stop... EU make doses. Private companies made countries purchased them. result export customers, that's trade works.

EU snooze EU lose statistical point view excess deaths caused covid.

But COVID deaths higher excess deaths deaths causes, like flu traffic accidents, COVID restrictions incidentally prevented. good reason. median age falling total cases either increasing plateaued overall, it’s reasonable conclude young Floridian cases increasing. SURGING strong word though. like spring breakers used lax mask rules America assume everywhere else also taking pandemic seriously.  maybe lot assume lot people vaccinated US lot vaccinated every country. Alabama get stuck household appliance piece furniture recieve jab. downvotes applying basic algebra situation completely inappropriate naive. Holy shit epidemiologist figured out! Alert media!

There's places never really formal lockdowns people still masked social distancing.

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing Positivity Rate: said lot subs positivity rate go time people vaccinated require testing. Last year, *the* metric watch, likely wane quickly importance overall testing drops. necessarily worry sudden high positivity rates, mass testing likely drop pretty quickly, particularly testing sites converted vaccination sites. 

We may want use newly found testing sequencing capacity test sequence higher proportion flu samples. might give us head start flu genetics circulating, help eliminate flu two. We're single digits flu cases places, awesome! likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6 

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need like [thegracefuldork's prediction vaccine previous prediction. ""rosier"", better.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.


Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

NYT [some good fact, [they *

More [good news goodness. like read comments something... side effects vaccine:

Nobody saying side effects. clearly side effects. I'm even saying side effects vaccine could last years. effects infection may show while, [and know last long notably loss sense smell.

I'm saying we'd find side effects within months. side effects suddenly show six months vaccination already shown people.

If example side effect vaccine side effects seen within first four months suddenly found four months post-vaccination, I'd change wording post.

I'll tell though, I've still gotten example vaccine side effect show least people way vaccine administered.

I get plenty ""look, vaccine used decades ago tiny country rarely causes one long-term side effect, wrong"", address point I'm making. Politicians power give them, talk power 
I live ignore every politician's name try better person family

But think war preferable option anything going on, fully understand war really family wellbeing immunity covid without vaccine limited last much past 3 8 months. also stop spreading it. spread new variants really bad places hit. Hospitalizations went way variant hit area. mention hit kids harder original. level younger people getting hospitalized serious covid symptoms much higher variants. Additionally every time new variant infects somebody another chance new variant mutate. Second class citizen useless overly-emotional description. saving lives economy. People right healthy infected. Govt take sort actions guarantee rights. PANDEMIC.  Cancún issue. city ""semaforo rojo"" ""semaforo naranja"" quite time now, would mean public businesses multitude people would prohibited, citizens fighting back government regulations order re-activate economy since primary source income tourism; lifted several regulations restaurants, bars, clubs hotels order re-gain economic power.

However, came multiple waves COVID-19 cases safe say, multitudes people attending public venues without sort protective regulations. passed Hotel Zone (where clubs hotels are) flabbergasted little importance give whole pandemic. Large gatherings people without masks, less five centimeters next other, little regard physical contact.

And even venues following careful procedures, low level might well invest them. example, government regulation mandated restaurants include ""shoe washing"" mat entries exits establishments, (sure, get COVID-19 feet), thermometers (which usually pointed hands reason), antibacterial gel (which time, soggy inefficient since sitting full sun multiple days).

The closing Chichen Itza drove away tourists archeological sites like Tulum, Coba, El Rey, flocked large gathering maskless tourists matter time close well.

Vaccination carps ready introduced city, low-supply vaccines think they'll effective population whole. Meanwhile, tourists time lives enjoying cheap prices luxurious zones, us second-class citizens (students, office workers, salarymen/women) rely patience someday admitted back regular daily lives.

That's something keep mind trouble getting appointment. people would starve. Jfc Dude, one forcing anything. Thats Covid sucked fucking much states, every 1 person cares others there’s 5 people like you. “Once I’m safe fuck everyone else” essentially you’re saying. 

Trash humans. uniform guideline cdc basically deferred states. maybe consult states health page advice. NJ say topic

If COVID-19 recovered need get vaccine?
 COVID-19 vaccination offered regardless whether already COVID-19 infection. required antibody test vaccinated. However, anyone currently infected COVID-19 wait get vaccinated illness resolved met criteria discontinue isolation (basically meaning 14 days post infection). recommended time frame infection vaccination, current evidence suggests risk reinfection low months initial infection. Therefore, people recent infection may choose temporarily delay vaccination while
 vaccine supplies limited.

Notice wording recommended time frame recommendation essentially safe get you’re longer sick likely may want wait getting supply limited. Given nearing point supply picking would say wait month post infection get you’re eligible. know several people gotten vaccine long infected fine. understanding research I’ve seen suggests long recovered covid risk vaccinated. Hmmm almost like kind medical method introduced around point helps prevent infecctions... Yes true. experience (from Jalisco) authorities ask enforce mask usage people use ask soon forced seen either forget take off.

My brother morbidly obese (really badly). fear he'd tough time Covid. go back working office June 1, want worry acting carrier giving virus. want resume semblance in-person social life full immunity kicks (2 weeks dose 2), want move concern (my parents need financial help, that's live home), would stress much worry him. anything convince get him? could get volition, he's still age he's kinda deferring mom dad decide, dad poisoning brain anti-vax disinfo. mean Stephane Bancel?

That’s lot talk “omg cases!!!” among young people articles much huge numbers hospitalizations among them. young people end hospital, comparatively rare cases? Yes. long there’s hospital space them, that’s *fine.* idea prevent every case absurd. 

And 362 days ago... know didn’t have? Millions millions elderly high-risk people vaccinated, millions millions recovered Covid. It’s completely different situation March 2020. Yeah we’re basically weeks behind them. Hopefully looking Israel shows happen country near term future People quick blame tourists, virtually precautions taking place country. Well also case 10-25% population natural immunity infection. “real” immunity close 75% stop spread effectively. That's still minority across whole us. people wear masks. 

Even tourist areas incoming people much locals ignoring mandates Every person know gone uni caught covid along housemates surprised.  yeah, unfortunately work weekends sometimes take sick, 24 hour heads uo availability back Feb pass up. National stay home order lifted tomorrow

Keeping IA card part-time gig. goalposts moving, common sense every person know kids saying exact thing entire time. Hopefully whenever happens 70%+ adults got vaccinated. Actually pretty eye-opening how, even comment brought story's truthfulness question, hundred people upvoted comment rather take opportunity read article. like think Reddit much better social media, there's probably *ton* misinformation spreading here. IIRC, thousands recorded variants mutations mostly benign. also remember reading concerning mutations also detected early on, less prevalent vaccines besides know effect mutations would vaccines. u/yaolilylu might wanna chime in, though, since that's remember reading things from. yes plenty people struggling need assistance (which address, get wrong), majority people catastrophic economic situation. ""Vaccine passport"" aside, going start facing hurdles without vaccine eventually.

Countries require sorts vaccines entry. Cruise ships start requiring PR disasters result outbreaks. full authorization happens kids, expect schools require admission (I'm old, school would vaccine drives students).

This first great illness we've faced country, first time immense negative pressure get vaccinated covid circulates long time.

I'm saying means agree digital passport. I'm telling surprised life gets harder refuse vaccine. hope not. It'll make jealous miserable seeing people party stay home nothing do. would love lost friends unfortunately. Tell creating monopoly, extremely high levels unemployment, suspension basic civil liberties printing large quantities currency, going long term beneficial impact situation? 

I said before, say again, deny existence Corona virus. I'm question measures implemented clearly convoluted logic.

Clearly careers fortues build here. backs people lost livelyhoods, people suffered directly indirectly, people convinced acting good like yourself, people disappointed whole ""pandemic"" like myself. counting epic Mad Max shit. 

I care year ot two. Though, manage. However, I'm concerned going happen 5 years, 10 years 15 years? foundations lay right forever change socio-economic political landscape. 

Once get people wearing masks shops wearing them, care either way. Ask questions. going number X number years. changes, meaningless right now, impact long term?

An example. call conspiracy nut care. know why? know I'm conspiracy nut ;)

I'm halfway (vaccinated), see green light vacation since I'm still putting people risk. sneaking suspicion vaccinated people feel even lax impact surroundings, i.e. proper mask wearing, hand washing, distancing, etc. Since generally piss poor enough risk catching/transmitting virus, imagine increased vigilance getting vaccinated ""I'm safe."" That's think important wait everybody chance. people choose readily available, care outcome anymore. maskless idiots going responsible mutation bypasses vaccines throws back another full blown pandemic mean sure. don’t care people come in, services understand. Hair, nails, waxing... fine. It’s exactly essential, understand. Especially manage virus bit better. spa day? Seems silly me. level mutation catastrophic, leading RNA can't even work.

Fortunately, tests almost always negative, good, considering possible flu covid time people getting covid may susceptible getting flu. Chinese vaccines ineffective Brazilian variant seems heavily dependent that. mRNA new technology first mass deployment it. Development testing indeed rushed. don’t think hesitancy much intelligence. Humans suck evaluating risk. isn’t mass outbreak anti vax. Though people certainly make things worse. Lots people vaccinate kids fine shots general pausing. need meet mentally offer reassurance facts want it. last thing need another front culture war.

Life goes on, year already we're getting older.  still european vaccination debacle vaccinations give people.  Part filtration done due electrostatic charge, begins weaken prolonged use. get around 98 percent filtration first, drops around 94 40 hours.

Oh, yeah! never question! sad reality got sick though, that's much planet implement hugely damaging lockdowns managed slow transmission C-19.

I feel you, feel kids others lost hugely important year studies impacted last year. said, work healthcare, mental health, seen devastating consequences colleagues patients families cannot condone anybody ""giving up"" progress hard won. let's clear, suggesting doing.

In 5 years time likely look back ""that awful things better now"". that's reality, long life yet live likely get back track. people die now, partly due people giving up, still dead then. story stops death, still told. RemindMe! 34 days Whaaaat? way. absolutely way could possibly known exact situation would happen. like thing happened, know, around time population year ago virus, right? also exposes weakness that, Japan/NZ/Taiwan cases travelers don’t follow purposely break quarantine. course US blame significant portion this. I've never thought said otherwise sorry. Logistics absolutely fucked last year though.  read. answer questions reddit, facebook friends group. People get tested influenza, result mask usage, lockdow covid/pandemic measures influenza spread like before. area went lockdown every possible contacts infecteds quarantined, found infected also, virus spread quarantine. outbreak stopped, infecteds cared one one recovered. efficacy = 1 - risk vaccinated / risk unvaccinated = 90%

10% = risk vaccinated / risk unvaccinated

Number infected vaccine = % without protection * risk unvaccinated * number people

In example, let's assume there's 5% risk getting infected unvaccinated elderly encounters relatives. 1 million elderlies, would expect 50,000 infections.

With vaccine, would expect 5,000 infections. means 100,000 protection vaccine. Remember, risk getting infected immunity 5% example. tested influenza rates always tested it.

We entire surveillance network set around influenza symptoms seem flu like tested flu.

The flu world wide too, counties covid, every country world. Going see mine Friday. live excellent sr. care facility (they 2 bedroom apartment). 

Now I'm fully vaccinated &amp; too, get see first time since January 2020!  dad cried approved appointment Thursday!  grandmother's health decline terribly last 6 months. 

Several grandkids take turns ordering groceries last night order ingredients cake homemade bread. cooked year grandpa said practically bouncing walls. Someone explain point getting vaccine still get virus vaccinated. Ah yes european vaccination gives countries like canada, uk, mexico japan fighting chance virus.

Not sure nationalistic approach usa isn‘t blame many usally answer this, us care anyone else. Funny we’ve seen media reporting Pfizer clots. whole thing stinks. Go Montana Tribes! moves job mid-pandemic?  live nation that's economy largely relies economies countries around us. got vaccinated them, would disastrous economy begins... made sense pandemic. COVID really shuffled decks. Baylor/Biological E’s vaccine cheap easy store months away still. comment lot people governments need understand. shitstorm end year ""rich"" countries going follow suite sacrifice old everyone else's survival You’re selfish. words it.

You call submissive, even assuming freedoms world, you’re telling us chose make free willing choice save people’s lives. mother eligible early (first responder) kept pulling ""I'm gonna wait"" line. 
 
""You're seeing kids vaccinated"" changed tune. manipulation? Sure. ends justified it. think meant starvation hunger No! side right anything!  Funny self described socialist wouldn’t interested forces capital behind guy like Fauci’s rise prominence. Watch interview. It’s interesting promise. several news associated Mexico mishandling vaccine.

The website created crashed good amount time allowing people register vaccine, apparently prepare appropriate servers entire country. reports fake vaccines given states well. 

Personally city going Red Alert/Orange Alert past year, always end going back Red people start opening businesses real precautionary measures owners desperate keep businesses afloat Graun going tell us countries fare use method counting UK? Zdog forum posting pandemic though. What's wrong you? race anything? creating division. fools divided race.  Yeah, never curfew restrictions Britain. Yes! one incredibly close died, I've 11 outside funerals last year. Never go someone's home, bring food, service lasted 15 minutes. 

Next week, I'll finally get see grandparents seen since January 2020. One physically gone downhill much. still hanging like, missed birth 6th great grandchild whole year rest them. lost lol. EU exported 70 millions doses, many countries would otherwise able afford them, UK exported zero. 

Vaccine nationalism bad look. virus struck Middle Ages, would substantially higher.

Yes, COVID soooo much worse Tuberculosis. -__-  really need emoji that. would save people lot typing. article doesn’t support headline. Cases increasing amount young Floridians, median age infection falling people 50 increasingly vaccinated. SII f'ed production manufacturing capabilities. half held promises UK, failing move vaccine high speed; statement political statement 0 value. 

What India could done allow foreign players distribute specially Moderna Pfizer. given rise nationalism every thing associated ""Made India"", dying economy empty banks, basically beggars buying game! Suffering success. New Jersey Maine experience. mean true. It’s less chances severe infections. still take vaccine available. can’t keep guards completely, much idiots don’t take seriously mutated stronger strains. well defined. Deadly means causes death. I'm perfectly within reason say virus deadly kills people twice fast. Every single manufacturer missed production estimates. Maybe stop kicking particular football. TwO WeEkS Got look data. Fortunately CDC capable year last year. keep hearing still sooooo long wait.

Oh well! Thanks teen daycares got duped buying new age ion therapy device, something science never claimed worked. stop dramatic. Thanks sharing that. I'll need go read whitepaper references morning, best means got lucky effectively wasted time waiting phase 3 trials going ultimately change plan run real-time test public. Hopefully we'll smart enough steer supply higher demand States. big issue when, country state, promote tourism.

I saw yesterday ad giving 20% go weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Come, get 20% covid-19 free!!! New variant's may stopped current vaccines. Booster shots development. continue follow CDC guidelines common sense Fouchie tells us coast clear. I'm group 9, offer letter yet. non island totalitarian country well opinion? We've lockdown since last summer.....didn't stop things spiking hard fall winter. Honestly, really care people they're fully vaccinated state drops restrictions. see fault statement. They're even confined environments nursing homes. see issue That's good point. changes degree correlation lag cases deaths. helps sure, stay well Cries Canadian. about? EU already paid 200 million 300 million ordered doses (The EU agreed pay 3 installments, two facts suck

Lol. strange imagination =/= facts. don't. Like literally. mother law COPD problem wearing mask. think get ""breathing problems"" COPD. severe enough would need oxygen would mean going anywhere anyways would need tank begin with. (American here) I’ve trying get shot 3 months. world talking about? want over. Trust fun... vaccinated done it. 6’ person, 23.5 25 meaning putting almost 9 pounds meal. Please try show us done! one wake live level fear? Sweet holy Jesus... Look Israeli data. see deaths age group start tank way # cases decreases. takes get R &lt; 1. EU stealing Oxford-AstraZeneca IP would expected congregate living setting like prison. Also keep mind prisoners probably tested readily compared general public really choice get test first point wrong. agree probably fourth wave deaths anything close previous waves. vaccination change three week lag. Less people going die due vaccinations, ones die die weeks getting sick. point I'm fully cheering every single state lifts restrictions. I'm surprised authoritarian governors trying hold onto things like vaccine passports, I'm surprised people subreddit begging politicians control daily life, I'm happy many states side people one.

Depending long authoritarian politicians plan running states like prison might need consider moving. becoming legitimately terrifying, terrifying fact people supporting them. Given virus mutating toward deadlier versions data know current vaccines work effectively variants. Already read stories people fully vaccinated catching another corvid variant becoming sick. That's ANYOME, YOUNG OLD continue wear masks coast clear, least 80% us fully vaccinated booster shots variants available emergence use. 

Does help understand requirement. really common sense end day. We're currently 1,000 deaths day due covid. would 365,000 deaths per year. That's 6x disease load misquoted worst flu season 10 years. average 36,000. we're actually dealing 10x deaths covid average flu year.

So, 100 covid deaths per day that's acceptable level based influenza deaths. even then, SHIT INFLUENZA. yearly vaccination campaigns people ignore ask stay fuck home sick influenza. expect covid response, point, ""fuck it."" Expect ""get vaccine, stay home covid symptoms."" People supported draconian lockdown measures caused immense personal financial suffering longer decades taking high ground never gets old. true, looks like people even mask use come close contact people donate them? cannot disagree decision made best guess political motivation - however current data showing 12 week delay vaccinations favourable, least AZ. Example Given fully vaccinated, inherent risk situations low. 
If feeling apprehensive, implement another protective strategy distancing masking visit. I'm sure would understand explained desire take chances parents. free go situations want put something body.

But rather force put something body enjoy life want.  Maybe suburb communities, urban lower K areas devastated. expect crime major metros increasing next decade. Ben Shapiro?  California lockdown like California stop stop sign kinda sorta stop reality roll slowly.

About half people California follow restrictions stay home order December January. Er....but they're hire clinicians! far likely thats holdover lockdown cmhead, valid point increasing immunity people getting covid. point out, documented strategy many Trump administration health officials charged justifying opening quarantine restrictions. know turned out, highest death count world USA! Another thing is, shouldn’t assume young revelers first couple weeks covid, going mild cases resolve quickly. MAJORITY Covid “long haulers” 18 50(!), big hump around 38-45. People seemed sick first “acute” stage infection, variety debilitating “long covid” symptoms caused lose jobs, partners happiness. Around 30% people get covid show LC symptoms months later. 28 million people USA (official count- real lot higher) who’ve covid March 2021, third nine million people 😥. Probably whole operation confusing hell lol They've supposed been, seems inconsistent, I've asthma doctor's yet offer even first dose. days ago announced 4 hobbits Lord Rings con that's it. guarantee show up. early bird ticket prices end days refunds 2 weeks con. refund processing fees though. Nope Obviously huge number factors come play here, right? 

Weather, local ordinances, political leanings, average age, things simple someone infected getting plane going City rather City B. get shenanigans, like Florida’s intentional misreporting numbers.

To mind, obvious reaction complexity stick basics. know virus spread breathing air another person, take steps you’re fully vaccinated. love people smartphones, every single bit information it, concerned app generates QR codes vaccine status. 

In case, vaccine paid federal government distributed state government.

The point allow full capacity leisure activities - concerts, sports events, musicals, gyms, etc. Otherwise limp along 25 percent capacity masks uncomfortable testing. done national level.

We can't force people get vaccinated, can't force people use technology attest vaccinated. plenty privileges reserved vaccinated government wasted 5 trillion dollars virus response, avoid spending another three trillion sell There's difference UK saying need vaccinated enter country shaws street. right. would gladly see 100 patients day long non-COVID related. UK really needs invest NHS run vaccine production facilities happens UK 4 months ahead year ahead show eu member states eu useless matters. would huge boon UK medicines would drop price dramatically delivered much faster.

It known fact NHS run facilities effective privately run facilities.  new normal privatizing dystopian future pretend exist ""nobody's making it"" UK mostly vaccinnate older population astrazeneca ? seem blood clotting issue mostly affect younger people. Yes, yes &amp; yes. Similar boards independent scientists US recommended changing dosing schedule tested.

The fact decision made board degrees change fact choice went existing data.

Without data decision based best guess political motivation. case vaccines, huge political gain saying twice many people immunized even technically given one dose. Yes can't require masks Stop blaming trump. Bidens hands younger people senior citizens vulnerable people vaccinated. result going see deaths come cases stay relatively high April. suspect going see lot reopening early May case regardless case numbers may show death hospitalization numbers going rapidly come Yes. do.

 Perhaps misunderstood context. individual answering said: ""I got vaccine, pandemic *for me*.""
Tell me, think statement right, wrong? Cases matter. novel pathogen, sure evolve allowed spread widely. Certainly evidence newer mutations contagious virulent (i.e. harmful). Furthermore, yet plans vaccinate children, appearing may affected first thought. Caution advised. Exactly. “surge” “wave” saw last spring past winter. anything “uptick” cases. everyone wants use scary words make sounds worse, someone look December compared realize new wave.

An uptick? Maybe surge. Cool story dude go get questions. know military require vaccine receives full FDA approval, likely required fully approved (all current vaccines still EUA).

1) schools (or workplaces) require vaccine hasn’t met full FDA approval (this assuming aren’t fully approved fall)?

2) long take FDA go EUA full approval?

3) Since 3 vaccines EUA, happens one two approved fall? schools accept vaccine, even isn’t fully approved yet? could it. sense people grasp it’s explained them, least roughly, actively reject it. course, even Sunday pretty low. Yeah, except cases flat/going last 2-3 weeks. beyond easy get vaccine appointments bumfuck Indiana.  makes feel better, pennsylvania vaccinating people per day average florida is, despite florida 8 million people Case numbers look pretty flat US past month. think reasons listed contribute like instead continued dropping like deaths hospitalizations. helps show vaccines working risk death hospitalization vaccinated first. looks like Isreal similar situation cases vs deaths enough people vaccinated drop case numbers. snort shit, looks like I’m trouble .. northeast tends preceed rest country due weather population density/travel hubs. likely see increase within week two many many states like last week. Hopefully weather increased immunity hold much rise states France mocked “stewpid Amereecàns” Well, add reading comprehension list inadequacies. really helping case. Nowhere say people right cross borders freely. stop. Rethink life viewpoints. See went wrong. Thanks. think seeing general trend entire population.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* gonna lie, like brag it. vegan I'd brag too. Hate game playa. way you’re saying disregards real effects that. I’m sure will. believe we’ve purchased billion vaccines 400,000,000 people US India surplus vaccines readily donate too. I'm glad we've safety, never take granted seeing people's faces. miss faces. Same. got second dose. I’m drawing line this. gonna it. It'll interesting see amount second doses given.

I've seen rumor allocatable stock second doses given increase numbers first doses , amount available second doses going available time effective second doses. Whipped calculator sped it. 736,000 dead Americans still massive number Sinovac proven effective P1 (the Brazilian variant), based preliminary testing  Could interesting opportunity make profit. 🕵️‍♂️ literally said: problem unvaccinated kids. Wrong Portugal actually froze orders AZ  ...Facts matter Oh duh thanks Google (I use Google Search, btw) knows looked appointment. idea helping people look appointment. appointment got appointment (I never put Google calender). copy vaccine card status. Google seeing, knowing yet. reporting usually far less Sundays, bit cherry pick think Inslee planning opening due pressure Biden's May 1st deadline. opened asap. Folks waited long enough. certain point, micromanaging vaccine appointments pointless. Let's get jabs arms! 57% UK adults received vaccine.

43% UK adults remain unvaccinated. Dutch rate low? I’m Canada. guys got head start since deliveries stopped coming last February bounced back beginning March. We’ve outpaced guys already. There’s much shit wrong you’re saying. problem isn’t “unvaccinated kids” it’s MIS-C, deaths, hospitalizations, possible long term effects. 

Did say wouldn’t able socialize educated? I’m saying adults stand wear masks avoid things like crowded concerts **few months** kids vaccinated. 

And it’s endemic disease right now. It’s pandemic virus kids natural immunity towards. matter. prevent death. matters. Actually, 8th worst deaths per capita Europe (or 9th count Gibraltar).  Yes... definition, PANDEMIC means everyone gets ur flu.

These morons think we're living 2005.

""If dont accept Pandemic happening, happening!!!"" get read another 300 stories dumb kids families, sick/dying hospitals, typical quote of, ""I know real!"" 🤦‍♂️ vaccinated catch covid chance hospitalized die nil,so get vaccinated!! I’m coming conclusion accepting it’s time move. work remote also. Would start fresh new city. Miami sounding really nice live life again. quarantined almost 2020 100% this. time think beyond borders,"" said. ""The world safe single country still fighting left spread, risks mutating extent vaccines treatments longer work. goes beyond ethics - scientific economic imperative.""

This absolutely true. wealthy countries like UK US start get situations control, best interests start donating vaccines. need put fires, especially poorer nations underdeveloped health care systems, new variant arises actually evades existing vaccines threatens put everyone back square one. Well maybe taken profit. moment everybody getting lot less doses payed for, one could argue pay higher price.

Let's hope AZ let's say companies AZ contracted improve production soon. Even Pfizer new mRNA technique sending ordered EU hope also UK. believe anecdotal stories...  hear way much align hear see real life. ...  personally know 3 nurses refusing it, doctor. legal yet repeated incorrectly anyway? You’ll never win argument topic someone whose reasoning simply would like exercise personal freedoms.

In case vaccines, nothing done. won’t getting covid vaccine personally risk individual work risk career field. 

The vaccines rushed, studied, vetted, widely distributed impending sense necessity let virus plague every day lives US. think vaccines micro chips? Absolutely not, I’m fucking daft. also don’t think it’ll kill real long lasting side effects. 

But there’s always chance something go unnoticed process developing vaccines. lot people, chance great justify getting vaccinated point time.

It’s personal choice. People allowed make themselves, regardless responsibilities one another society. 

(If people really cared responsibilities one another country wouldn’t rollout vaccines first place. We’d quarantined locked 3-4 weeks March would that.) Let’s face it, people would dropping dead 2-3 weeks later even without Covid. don’t mean callous, 90+ year old mother assisted living well. inoculate millions elderly people, absolutely going dying couple weeks later Covid-19 exposure, many times even virus. Yes, people need reminded 90% efficacy means there's 1 10 chance immunity even completing vaccination. 

If million vaccinated elderlies seeing unvaccinated children grandchildren, 100,000 elderlies effectively seeing relatives without protection vaccines. I've gone almost 2 gallons last year. me, husband, 2 kids. upset this... Well Uk doesnt export ban. Read book, least google typing shit Take taxes elsewhere, dude. nice weather worth crap deal there. guess India 'fuck cares ' attitude among public Honestly, I’d kind take this. share lot dual citizen Uk Ireland sure would swell able go see family! want people panic Done via fax machine agree. sampled studied small explore effective dosage regime longer time span doses.

Nevertheless, indicative happen new variants Advocating death another human based post online terrible, regardless much disagree posted death rates younger Brazilians increasing rate case rates = “alarming new shift” ok. you’re adult you’ll eligible regardless starting tomorrow. mean, carcinogen found literally anything anyway people family getting vaccine soon. anti vaccine anti mask basically everything pro-stupid mom coming visit we're going prank her. 

Going either cousin uncle lives waiting mouthful foam fake seizure. also first shot scheduled middle visit. think attempting prank second time great. think US government allowing vaccine exports time. seem recall reduction risk around 15%. Enough make glad wear glasses. enough first dose every Irish adult, good news Ireland. Indirectly help EU supply doses intended Ireland used areas Ireland agrees. wonder might little optimistic. lot people ditching masks acting like pandemic also group say won’t vaccinated (including 50% Republican men).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'll give credit telling people inject bleach shove powerfulights butts. true leader.... Imagine parallel universe leader powerful country embraced science pandemic began..... congress stood behind science instead front it. really well written. wrote book, read it. lot people lost gamble. people lining hugs someone else got sick died. coming years, see ""killed people"". Gallowboob probably  maybe people lead second third fourth waves. propagating notion lied vaccine efficacy safety promoting conspiratorial thinking experts pushing kind dastardly vaccine based agenda. untrue, misinformation, dangerous public health. done elsewhere well. I, like others, answered question comprehensively. given scientifically sound, informed response, balked apparently good enough you, fit agenda, fundamentally question genuine looking answer. proceeded spew vitriol. lead horse water can’t make drink. 

Reporting simply taking appropriate action deal unacceptable behaviour taking part in. never see anyone common cold? real concern. Kids less likely get acutely sick virus, serious illness isn’t unknown, either. I’m concerned long-hauling symptoms, affecting lots people right now, especially ages 20-50. kids affected long covid, too. absolutely hate correct answer. learn much crappy argume tactics. Why? would hurt random citizens country nothing this. breaking news, water wet. “news” CBS Sometimes, beat sickness. trump would continued still power. Either ways, bad English second language? It’s prevalent sub recently. Almost every thread actually over. We’re close woods yet, apparently that’s controversial. Apparently we’re shut-ins wanting cases continue go vaccines aren’t wasted people getting infected 1 week dose. less cases total, better. sure considered controversial some. one state ""at employment""?

Feels like employer can't *say* getting vaccine. right, credit blame that. I'm partisan, apparently are. Partisans blight ruining nation. Can't throw virus plane? I’m sick seeing people say “it’s over” isn’t. It’s definitely way over, quite yet. people going accept that. less people infected, easier vaccine able effective, right people vaccinated still risk infected couple weeks after. I’m jealous! tier yet Washington State. complaining, though; it’s great letting grocery store workers teachers lots important people get shot me, shots going arms around state, uncomfortably close covideniers North Idaho. Come America. China recently beat absolute numbers per day. gonna stand take like that? Let's pump numbers!  SA apparently concern here, either jump hoops get first 500 000 doses J&amp;J less 21k active cases total.

121 countries banned South African travellers yet SA schools open functioning normally month.

No surge. Less 21k active cases. course, many could asymptomatic recorded demand testing lower.

It Level 1 before, feels...almost normal again. God willing. 

Can’t quite credit vaccines, Pfizer month late first shipment. AZ booted. J&amp;J stepped vaccinate frontline healthcare workers first. fact collaboration even possible miracle: fussy hell.and DOH clearly don’t favour panic jabbing whatever easily available without full data local testing.J&amp;J fortunately conducted trials here, Pfizer, they’re two order. We’ve refused donations without data, 500 000 doses J&amp;J research stock offered pay put aside use provided us *gratis* part implementation study. 

I hope anyone thinks like mayor Detroit regards J&amp;J substandard Moderna Pfizer remembers President South Africa willingly rolled sleeve one first receive vaccine knew effective still technically experimental subject formal EUA *any* country stage,including own. 

The man power elect wait months Pfizer arrive, mention fact medical doctor wife, pitched smiling public hospital middle Cape Town township receive jab I’ve heard Americans say they’d rather avoid leave homeless. variant, SA luxury choice - moment it’s Pfizer J&amp;J. simply means lot many people every political/medical leader SA fight COVID took J&amp;J shot despite active cases pretty low, certainly low enough wait ‘Golden Standard” vaccines arrive. 

We always knew we’d back queue. secured amount need - vaccines evaluated contingencies. people order 3-4x doses need promise pass “poor” afterwards. they’re done. Honestly, no. won’t end pandemic.We pay need, touch poorer involves additional logistical roadblocks push us behind queue. 

So along vaccines we’ve ordered, paid acknowledged likely late, done get vaccine rollout onto sort track. mean, expect majority people go younger crowd? Expect see drop May vaccinate younger adults. Places packed here, mostly people 20s - 40s. Oah boy. gonna pissed learns retroviral infections natural effect genes. Tell one thing I’ve posted that’s factually inaccurate. Yeah pretty much let people's guard down.  believe report anti-vax misinformation, true actual information too. 

Ethanol (as alcoholic beverages) group 1 carcinogen. amusing read, you’ve reported uncivil discussion

And it’s quite clear certain variants impact vaccine efficacy. one “scared shitless” admit that. you’ve proven point, you’re pushing agenda 

Your comment history (like recent reply) filled conspiratorial, anti-vaccine garbage. would say so. lesser chance catching jabbed. said 0.65% chance infection someone personally manufactures pfizer vaccine vials, assure microchips it. add nurses dilute pre extraction. Oh now, don’t know know anything. Top comment clearly read article guess neither thousands people voted it. really can't say shit disinformation people even read paragraphs. I'm sure employer fire getting vaccine. Right now, vaccine fully approved. vaccines use right given emergency authorization. Employers may want test legal issue requiring unapproved vaccine. People like facts. saw true, reports increasing. seven day average second week March averaged 55K, back 58. Michigan getting worse, there's hotspots around country. people beyond tired taking precautions. Yeah, although agree part, even possible young healthy people get without technically lying, ones getting are. least stretching truth... like claiming they're caregiver get groceries parents occasionally. know looked changing dna could actually cure bunch diseases would basically bring whole new era modern medicine. could make trillions it. nah , let’s put mark beast (whatever is) peoples dna Great comment, smart...

The Nazi’s persecuted due political ideologies. Thanks laugh. Report spam??? Seriously?? That’s funniest thing I’ve read ages. really completely full (and excrement). 

“Notable protection “ huh. OK. you’re scared shitless admit current vaccines aren’t effective new variants. admission might make fence decide jab. might keep US reaching 70%~ need herd. 

I’m far virulent anti vaxxer. Think people avoid vaccines fools. flu vaccine last fall. flu January 2020 didn’t want repeat. wasn’t regular flu. COVID-19. Based symptoms be. 

But doesn’t fit official bullshit timeline. lied constantly. people told us don’t need masks obvious did. mailed several kid Fauci telling weren’t necessary (yes, know lied protect holy health care heroes). 

Well, lies, pompously pronounced arrogant fools like you, poisoned well. intention multiple posts learn whether it’s contents dire seemed layman. response convinced are. Take spam threat rih. one adjusts noise, simples Damn, Romania soon take step outside home better mask face Unfortunately yes. guess come 200,000 cases day people start thinking they've ""won"" something. Well soon people putting risk willfully refused vaccine, point expect full free all. living miserable lifestyle protect anti-vaxxers. would irresponsible add fuel deniers false positives. decision makers know, even basic maths teach, double tests = double found cases. 

Headlines sell papers, inflammatory = fuel biased agenda. 

“Cases double schools return shocker”. Small print... testing more. like UK mean, definitely allows exports, happen. say, do. UK exceptionalism Money large one India developed Covaxin, efficacy 81%. even matter developed vaccine. Xenophobia bad, hope change mindset. long core pillar antivax movement

I seem remember report last year half anti-vax propaganda facebook directly indirectly funded RFKjr. depends definition political Kent Bazemore though... smh seem recall time figures deemed high indeed stressing Americans ( least majority). “people” see low now? Interesting. Thanks info. unaware that. heard get you’re tiered groups. Coz changed mind. initially said take it. 

I know stocks options work. 

Putin stance elaborate vaccine choice. want take it, choice. that's fine. US proposing vaccine passport. 

Duterte linking old news. 

Are going take mers ebola vaccines got out? Didn’t entire nation reject astra Zeneca vaccine?

For record, US approved AZ vaccine yet either, FDA main body that's currently grilling AZ details data, EU, EU backed away. Yes, unlike US severe shortage vaccines Germany Germans maybe can't afford picky like narrative Germans spoiled stupid maybe trusting AZ 100%. Also, despite disagreement involving AZ vaccines, UK inoculated vast majority citizens Pfizer AZ. told stepdad getting vaccine, told careful “causes sterilization women.” I’m 34 weeks pregnant talking doctor months vaccine. I’m pretty sure OB/GYN would encouraging get vaccine sterilization issue. 🙄

The hard thing much respect stepdad person (he hasn’t married mom 15 years, still close). avoid sort political social issue discussions don’t want know part him. Fortunately, one two times shared kind nonsense like me, think also intentionally avoiding it. Stupid stupid does. keeps asking bring Taco Bell.

Makes sense. franchise wars. might due supply issues Vaccine manufacturers coping Demand United States order meet 16 goal Biden. hope, there's lots evidence happen. depends would exposed covid. Data show that’s hypothetically 14 days you’d likely fine grandma died around Thanksgiving sister doesn’t believe COVID wouldn’t wear masks. I’m glad people get reunite.  said goodbye grandma via Skype.  right never truly understand agree argument UK government somehow exploiting virus ""transfer wealth power"" they're pulling stops vaccine production distribution, also funding billions various schemes. Recently, they've announced £500m Mental Health Recovery Plan, argument government using psychological warfare us pretty unconvincing. 

""Eat Help Out"", however bad move infection rates was, strong evidence want we, people, more. They're moving remove ""Stay Home"" order, even supposed ""third wave"" ""hit shores

Incidentally, third wave Europe driven Kent variant caused third peak back January. third wave hitting shores, way around. Fortunately us, vaccine rollout means vulnerable groups protected COVID strains, including Kent variant set globe's dominant strain.

Yes, reservations current UK government way mismanaged many aspects pandemic, find far-fetched suggest there's clandestine power grab going on, matter conspiracy theorists say.

There time believed theories speculation unshakeable truthes, high functioning autism anxiety issues susceptible believing many outlandish claims time like this.

Posts comments preceeding one sub nothing gloomy predictions doom eternal lockdown cycle. Let clear say suddenly started seeing life wonderful, blissful existence. 

However, things got better country nations vaccines, started doomscrolling far less looked objective facts aspects world living in.

I posted article show tackle virus, even variants, matter clickbait journalism place keep us afraid clicking articles outlets result.

Don't start getting blindly optimistic, also think best hope never-ceasing death march. Stay safe, wherever may be. balls, Covid already affects 😱😱 16 days 95% efficacy (or whatever is) measured 2 weeks 2nd shot.

They measure before, efficacy number cited. Good thing. Italy ridiculous outdoor masking mandate example. theater obviously, show government something. got shadowbanned another sub saying, “I got vaccine, everyone please get vaccine, track closely people become ill getting fully vaccinated probability escape variant lot higher we’re uncontrolled spread taking appropriate suppressive measures. It’s still way easy terrible stuff kick again.” 

People bought narrative vaccines handful rich countries going solve problems overnight. I’ve resigned look “nuts” continuing cautious, hoping develop boosters variants escape current regimen. arm little numb near shot area, felt kinda lightheaded 10-15 minutes shot, I'm fine. Ask shot provider, think I'd able handle physical activity today long someone around case suddenly felt lightheaded activity involve using weak arm. None get severely ill. immune (reinfection BS) good honest also function cases. UK less 10% peak, US never much 25%. Back 60k, 1k dead, good hear.  know else we've done?

Locked down.

Portugal also looked bleak 8 weeks ago, Portugal also locked down, Portugal also back last summer numbers. Portugal vaccinated 10% population.

Lockdowns effective. assume Obama would taken approach Trump H1N1 deadlier (and blame Obama assumption)? mean that

How much money grocery store worker Have? profitable pay less? 

And money go, difference?

It goes shareholders, lovely piece ass. countries harshest lockdown rules Great economies need Reset, know mean lol.

People getting back normal they're immunized. want see people continuing hide away avoid world they're vaccinated, could mean culture permanently damaged. Sure frustrating young person still protected others get lives back, like wait long. We'll right within like 2 months tops.  routes expensive routes significantly lower. loving fee changes cancellations. cancellation amounts getting way control. Unless someone family especially high-risk lot exposure public large, seems overly paranoid harsh. imagine seeing anyone outside household even entire year. qualified got first shot Pfizer yesterday.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Great guess got wrong. Keep trying. They're quickly going surpass lot nations, possibly even US UK, deaths per capita. Yeah non sensical. mean, anything decreasing R role even 20-30% immunity help, definitely enough prevent spread living like 2019. Reasonable approach I'm glad paying attention detail. Indoor bars restaurants high risk areas closed consistently government money adequately cover them. Could definitely kept cases low allowed schools open safely. Schools definitely nuanced debate. 

I'm definitely concerned US cases sort flattening last weeks, states countries, seen enough yet effective vaccines variants (could vary quite bit depending one). That, vaccine updates, many people get one much long-term immunity getting virus truly builds go long way towards determining trends go. Cautiously optimistic maddening states lifting mask mandates, risking keeping cases elevated worsening future surge, best case resulting unavoidable deaths even trend goes down.

Thanks good discussion. Logging bit feel free reply. I’m arguing argue. Stores area allowed sell parts store (considered non essentials) first wave agree this. feds do, state thing would think. France curfew papers leave home. UK never either. ‘essential’ pretty stretched. ...1+ years ""2 weeks stop spread"" accept germ theory near kind patient. lipread. That's communicate world. masks, feel would world suddenly went quiet. eyes ears, can't lipread fabric. alternative lipreading.

Notes- unclear handwriting phrasing opportunity follow questions.
Gestures- unclear possibility depth conversation.
Signed languages- expensive. can't afford learn.
Giving someone phone- want back gets nicked. may never reach pandemic levels again, see continue cause epidemics animals known carry it. data already starting come Israel continue. five weeks, we'll probably know lot more. 

It likely reduce, eliminate, transmission. you’re vulnerable group like 65 years age significant auxiliary condition, get Covid there’s risk. you’re groups, risk contracting Covid severe low. Unbelievable, could happen? Although context Jan 27th UK exactly 3 weeks current lockdown, response large surge following Christmas. We're still lockdown.

I'm belittling amazing vaccination effort impact numbers. However, even absent vaccination programme expect see *enormous* improvement dates. ridiculous number anti-vax nurses. allowed matriculate, much less graduate. I’m curious bar approval opposed EU. People sabotage purpose field worse one all. US 140M total today. way! don’t get it. state Missouri entered chat. 9% population knows COVID.

Most natural immunity know it.

Running everyone antibody test would quite lot resources add another large cog machine. Doesn’t sound “imported” me. Yeah

I've noticed lot articles recently admitting terrible messaging telling people get vaccinated go right back full social distancing masking might shooting foot 

As acknowledging progress trying give kind concrete guidelines loosen lift restrictions That's load bs, people buy generic drugs time. think people gotten invested becomes change status quo live normally, we’ve seen, people don’t like change. People gotten used this. Part reason masks sticking around long months fear mine don’t want continue culture avoiding possible risk doubling virus fear stuff. 

Like friends saw last may without masks outside mad say vaccine prevents transmission one sent picture outdoor event people school masks outside sitting close proximity, overstating risk significantly anything bad happened since last couple times said event unsafe. Plus, person literally marching band October, playing football games people packed bleachers! Like come on. logic: protect whatever do. mine. 91 nursing home still restricts us coming visit her. talk every night really needs see family visit people medical staff. Makes sad upset. probably work then, think know already.

The poster already suggested. Buy wallpaper, put away week virus particle ever wallpaper dead then. look healthy.. latest data Israel showed Pfizer vaccine reduced chance death 90% fully vaccinated people, handful deaths fully vaccinated people. Shocker. Vast vast majority physicians strongly pro vaccine. It’s almost always health workers roles anti-vaxx. far common female nurses applied logic. Thus smart, it? Oh no, trust anything: see railway barrier, drive around see barrier protect us! us us experienced themselves. suspend life everyone vaccinated. change point, though. ""low-hanging fruit"" people vaccinated, daily vaccination numbers start go down. people either applicable want vaccine. would love ignorant self select part normal society, would solve ton issues. think proof vaccination required vote.....😉 I'm terribly remote, live sizable area. political mismanagement whole thing. one site huge city. Car lines miles long, people getting fistfights line. still bad. always give shots needed. can't undo lives lost. Reddit fuels sadly. Powecom KN95 - ones tested FDA found 99% efficient, sold reputable US company, scratch-off QR code bag verifies batch factory. $0.99 head strap style. want ear loop style looking good fit stays place. Google bonafide masks (can't provide link here.) China New Zealand Korea Singapore Japan? latter 4 effective lockdowns still humane. try argue reasoning argue.

 


It's simple that.

 


It's fucking pandemic dude try argue fighting useless whataboutism According Bloomberg, 7-day average doses administered 2.7 million, reference that's population city Chicago. state really uptight people might want call ahead places ask. understand issue isn’t leaving China much returning China going abroad. last article read said bio parents worried losing jobs unable come back home several weeks. First dose second dose, full doses + total doses? disease deadly, less deadly, same?

How hell know refuse sort zeroes groups three sepparated commas numbers readable human? expect do, zoom count digits one time place thumb ones I've already counted keep track I'm supposed read touch screen select de-select swipe zoom zoom go insane I'm struggling finish reading one lousy huge number? Screw that. already posted Reposts removed! worry P1 variant way worry getting automobile crash; anything stupid probably impact you. I've done basically nothing year I've vaccine (and waited two weeks Tuesday), I'm starting things. I'm fully vaccinated, I'll more. people die auto crashes mean avoid getting car. 

I suspect eventually vaccine boosts immunity also cover variant. agree you. I’d love proven wrong, feeling things drop quickly around 50%. kids ineligible, anti vaxxers, millions people going way make appointment seek dose, things hit wall eventually. Unfortunately impossible compare strategies way. immunity 1 shot strategy wanes create lasting immunity? early draw meaningful comparison. unfair businesses sell clothes? another store allowed open sell groceries also allowed sell clothes. isn’t clothing store essential? Perhaps I’ve gained couple kilos pants small :-)  say charity. course aren't. However, factually, vaccine producer making profit. big issue people don’t realize couple weeks vaccinations opening all, isn’t really much need keep measures place. Like I’m fine wearing mask grocery store school want go away point continue knows go away. don’t like way affected people’s risk tolerances, they’re willing get car 30 minute drive live almost completely normally post vaccination, something wrong. already posted Reposts removed! I'm find end April! We've online since last March 😳 Yup. isadisaster listen here.

Here's thing : Hoszplations include go hospital 1 day go home.

DEATHS biggest factor affected vaccinated seniors older people first greatest chance dying disease. people vaccinated, really get significant cases hospizations. Please refer comment made days ago Greg Michael case still investigated. know proven death cases direct vaccine cause. Wait, second dose 4 months later? Hopefully won't, negating happens stupid. People start talking needing masks anymore, schools fully open idiots coming back springbreak Florida.... AZ last week

10 hours started feel bit tired. next 24 hours had, headaches, hot cold (very cold) flushes, diarrhea, vomiting, sweating, dizziness standing, joint point (in every joint bar hips). felt like beaten up.

I fully recovered 4 hours 24-28 hours. never recovered feel ill quickly, super weird.  Ok
So, shouldn’t presume.. extreme contagion ocd.. even ration still need things Many don’t seem realize COVID-19’s 1ish % IFR *with modern medical treatment.* virus struck Middle Ages, would substantially higher. Likewise, Bubonic Plague today, would lot less frightening considering antibiotic therapy early course illness treat (yes Plague still exists today including US it’s still dangerous, it’s treatable). Stupid stupid does. excited small, backyard barbecue 3 months. hugged mom stepdad today! First time year. elect Mexican version Bernie Sanders? person said “there reason”. gave reason. Vaccination exercise. insanely easy get vaccinated socal. check eligibility show up. concern. People like many deaths occurred. Thanks that. :) I’m Mexico personally know 7-8 people died Covid back home. I’ve never known many people die single disease short period time. older, doesn’t really matter. It’s terrible loss many people close me. 

I live NYC stayed since beginning. contrast, don’t know many people gotten sick here, don’t know anyone who’s gotten seriously ill even anyone someone close die. Meanwhile back home, numbers remained significantly lower NY, almost everyone family (thankfully everyone asymptomatic) friends, parents, etc. based figured numbers Mexico INSANELY fronts. cannot lift restrictions penguins reached herd immunity! mean four championships California. Yeah fuck mask wear mountain climbing relevant lol relevant discussion everyday stuff. exercise sweating making mask lose effectiveness 🤷🏻‍♂️ Absolutely surprised this. think Russian propaganda farms dedicated sowing much FUD every front possible. think key reason things gone well Germany poor communication inconsistent rules federal states. That's another problem thankfully here. New Zealand, COVID response handled central government level communication clear consistent. Likewise. Powecom legit verified federal government they’re exclusive importer. 

I bought 30 going last forever realize families separated border closure, right? in-laws never met 6 month old daughter live US we’re Canada. Look downvotes. 

I think clearly wide ranges “grandparents” agree. 

We never stopped seeing grandparents , parents 55; wife’s 59. 

Isolated rest world, can’t imagine parents holding grandchild turned like 15 months old .  Everyone make decision, easy line sand draw .

Their relationship kids super important special. statement UK PM enough doses 12 million 2nd doses due April. publishing due fear EU get jealous ban vaccines. 7 million inferred difference EU published exports UK Pfizer vaccines administered far. source believe. random person reddit Name American quarantine without exposed.

Name one. feel like still missing key information. Im Germany like 1/2 3/5 people see supermarkt using FFP2 masks (the equivalent N95 standard) already. problem using like shit. Also many seal completely nose air leaks there, reducing effectiveness. bought couple 3M Aura FFP2 masks amazing, use masks glasses without problem... issue fucking expensive they. process peer reviewing studies take least 3-4 months, willing look preprints, get data want time soon. That's weird, excess deaths actually Florida state. unless they're secretly throwing bodies ovens silencing families, can't faking it. I've seen lot justification ""well, tell people fully vaccinated need masks anymore people lie say they're vaccinated""

In areas people would pull kind shit already complying masking that's moot point certainly possible. Mexican healthcare system, already weak, *did* collapse this. would push COVID closer deadly naturally is, cause avoidable deaths. Well reading article reinfections surging Czechia think variants. yeah one's really certain. Peru excess death 3500 per million even higher. got RGB plaque every tooth 💯 imagine knows dgaf mostly make money since years, spreading hate misinformation huge part business model create engagment make purposely, imagine. Weigh risks bro, weigh risks. bring back variants higher infectiousness, higher death rates even young, higher chance infection.

Florida, United States Mutation Report

8,996 believe anecdotal stories ""the one person believe got dies!!"" hear way much align hear see real life. 

I personally know 3 nurses refusing it, doctor. going billions people refusing vaccine. Trump rejects plan early vaccines White House. Bolsonaro same, entire country.

Yeah, they're totally same. way address point avoiding vaccine personally benefit it.

Young healthy people get vaccinated sorts things, big reason herd immunity. social good. seems people forgot that. everyone think themselves.

Generally big disruptions supposed bring better stronger others, would appear done opposite. People whining easiest shit ever able cope something people fairly daily occurrence.

The people get complain essential workers. go bars get dick wet complianinig ""young"" ""deserve"" certain kind life due age, fucking fuck calling ""hell"". close elderly family member mine sent Bill Gates chipped vaccines propaganda video got vaccinated immediately could. think lot people changing minds. absolutely right. People paid decent amount money super quick easy access. certainly big part success we've enjoyed - one. *think* aren’t danger COVID. Many kids young adults still died even lasting ill effects getting virus. Plus, know people five years line. I've read jury still that. I've heard 3-6 mos thing I've also heard 1-2 years. think really know we're even 18 mos since first case world found. anyone confirm??

Careful!

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Many native groups events anyone esp don’t mind drive Nice, *actually vaccinating people* Japan? Alcoholics overweight well. 

Though bring addiction disease, even predisposed, punished. Spain AFAIK. South America countries (like Chile, Peru, think Argentina also). know Spain, South America problem lack economic support, high labor informality etc, months lockdown tiring compliance go (either necessity whatever) Canada,federal govt botched vaccine procurement.... article Brazil complete garbage.

Yes, hospitalizations 30 49 age group increased 316%. would concerning, except see cases age group something like 318%. means actually deadlier demographic, infectious. want get ""back normal"" ""flatten curve"" need never go outside wear 3 masks take vaccine every months rest life. 2 weeks flatten curve. need work together. family following rules like grandparents post report authorities! I’ve seen parents grandparents past 13 months. miss normal stuff like going restaurant sporting event. Luckily I’ll fully vaccinated 3 weeks.  don’t see indoors. don’t see problem this? Esp already vaccinated... deaths rise

source? think vaccinations go evidence this, drop fearmongering. agree wish would proper lockdown compliance “normal” closer may current vaccine rates get us 60-70% vaccinated. world live though. still take precautions must live world. Daily new admissions actually trending slight, great either way. countries people wealthy enough afford locking down. Sure globalists try capitalize it, lot people western nations wanted lockdowns. think anyone answer question incubation period new variants known. 

In order study incubation period, need know date people got infected, areas rampant spread, impossible studies. contact tracing studies seen come countries controlled pandemic well cases relatively easy guess infected therefore calculate long took become symptomatic. sick people spewing bullshit. People still getting sick idiots think means masks don’t work. Yeah, aren’t 100%, everybody even wearing them, imagine much worse would nobody wearing them. fucked logic like saying seatbelts don’t work people still die accidents even though wearing them. type person stupid ever convince otherwise. expat, makes proud American. Finally something impressive embarrassing. I'm responding article, I'm responding person saying there's reason vaccinate unless restrictions lifted lol. Like vaccines much higher level importance government policy country, personally get it.

As far tell vaccines prevent transmission believe scientists wanted make sure assuming it, transmissing reduction 100%, effect strains unknown. That's quite thing ""if vaccinated, 100% safe"". Given response places like UK expect restrictions lifted vaccination rates rise. know people expecting now, though, we've barely keep masking

Can stop acting like great difficulty. masking worst thing ever happened please exit conversation. never hear word surge ever soon haha. overused word ever year! think may middle ground full lockdown completely giving up. sure sub agrees too. I’ll never stop wearing them. reason everyone posts daily covid case increases instead totals. ""127,265,260 total covid cases today"" tell anything what's happening recently fell Italian guy year ago. would awesome get see person time... Hopefully hospitals Italy overwhelmed next weeks need extra hands. Yes.

Most people died old. means young people beat Covid. still really jack young healthy person, rate that's still concern. live Korea, never lockdown Germany never hard lockdown. People followed recommendations giving shit like agree there, sure. said thing. angry small businesses essentially shuttered, naught. lockdowns basically nothing harm compliance low.

I’m saying, doesn’t change fact practicing covid prevention measures place regardless us tiring them. That's really WFH people living Boise, we're discussing.  Please don’t make explain life experiences aren’t exactly like yours. I’m sure you’re old enough understand it’s slipped mind.  could’ve resigned said exactly that. “Today resign position made clear elected leaders, (insert names here) whatever reason want virus spread lots die. It’s probably time get streets you’re dead.” 

Would’ve got attention, promise. it’s true. numbers comparable? know within USA countries criterias differ (e.g. counting covid suspicion vs. confirmed, lax suspicion covid etc) actually STILL certain people feed replying exact phrase, sarcasm, posts mention upticks various regions. Jabronies still get upticks started people wear masks. fuck getting downvoted World war 3 90's followed united earth around 2042. cases Oregon. All
Nursing home residents though. old immune system great. don’t think much relevance younger relatively healthy ppl Got first Pfizer today man I’m looking forward summer correct, wrong. However link provided confirm it, better Clarification: German Dr's German Politicians?  Worldometers reports 200,862 deaths Mexico. population 129,927,988, deaths per million 1,546.

If excess deaths really twice many reported linked coronavirus, Mexico's deaths would highest per capita world. It’s better die feet live knees. could’ve done what’s right publicly lambasted dumb ass. Sure gets fired, probably also saves lots lives instead remaining quiet letting lies kill us. Fuck her. hope lives 200 never gets single day without reminders helped kill what. That’s true all. case lockdown made favor greater population compliant. Without compliance case rate never fell enough lockdown make sense, prevent hospital overload. 

Now global variants guaranteed covid won’t going away 3-4 years. signed months quarantine idiots ruined it. can’t let children lose anymore childhood elderly protected be. **Mar. 28, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

This true, unless hard understand Wuhan-Style hard.

Several countries Europe hard lockdown March/April 2020. worked wonders acted fast (Austria example epicenter spread Europe, contained quickly), look good hesitated late (Spain, UK) sure without would drowned death. like Sweden avoided altogether, paid price super lazy decay infections summer (when rest Europe virtually clean already).

FT grapths excess deaths positive tests there. crazy bad really Incorrect. simply means health dept govt across world simply don’t resources determine cause death excess hundreds thousands dead. Indeed. 
“[Australian] Department Health data shows confirmed flu cases fallen 300,000 cases last year meagre 21,215 year.’

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Might better waiting vaccine supply open rather becoming tax-paying subjects wealthy nations again. looks like there’s significant concerning jump cases Washington State, looks like trend mostly happening King County, rest state cases still plateauing. expected, cases primary increasing young adults even children. state getting close going 1k cases per day.
Case big concern, expected since Washington vaccines approach preventing hospitalizations deaths.
This also makes covid thingy interesting. come states like Washington strict measures compared rest US big increases states like Teaxs Florida little restrictions low cases?


I would think seasonality climate cause, matter restrictions are. States warmer around time year(TX,FL, CA, varying levels restrictions) seeing less cases states colder time year and(MI,NY,WA).
It looks like 4th wave, ones impacted may states cooler climates time year. France, Germany often lauded example done. Looking profile, one contributing pandemic. Extremely based pastaboys. change (Netherlands) follow them. Yes routinely test flu, way year overall. Flock immunity brands tested? Almost every country's government models, unanimously showed way reduce number DEATHS vaccinate based age (after healthcare workers going first). vaccinating essential workers first would reduce CASES fastest, ultimately models showed even declining cases, enough old people would still get deaths wouldnt decline fast protected old people first. makes sense. Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) 85 year old dying covid something like 15%, around 0.01% 25 year old (source: 85 year old 1500x chance dying 25 year old. IFR 75 year old 4.6%, 460x chance dying 25 year old. 65 year old 1.4%, 140x chance. Ultimately, want reduce hospitalizations deaths hospitals arent getting overfilled, although cases mostly still spreading among younger essential workers, ultimately huge percent recover fine. 1. see bribe- please elaborate

2. UKs wish

3. two islands share land border CTA, smart move protect themselves. reddit awards mistake. need show new virus

I disagree that. elaborate?

From perspective, shape, size, behavior aerosol different viruses. behave differently regarding masks? Reminds ""Spanish Flu"" became ""Spanish Flu"" even though start Spain. neutral WWI published truth pandemic hitting harm. rewarded honesty stigma persists even truth widely available. average 34 infected, fail detect one.

For 5000-people concert current level incidence Spain would expect like 5 infected, probably OK (although risk).

But start doing, say, 10 concerts like week definitely infected people concerts week. NZ population Ireland, they've 2500 cases vs. Ireland's 234,000. isolated island nation able stop people coming reason they've fewer cases vs. non-island nations, they'd still lot worse are. They've (relatively) almost cases whenever discover new ones whole country goes lockdown like week prevent people potentially spreading it. I’m 20’s live Germany. 

Hopefully I’ll get vaccinated age 80+ group rate knows. sure else would hate socialiced medicine. even blame that?

Still make said true child spoilt rotten every child yours.
Mark words, I've seen happen many families now. efficient Pfizer vaccine 16 days first shot?

Asking friend... It’s government reporting excess death. wonder excess deaths compare. Right. finding right balance bad options. Breaking news: Fire Hot. like story (had seen before) -- reading ""Failures State"" moment quite shocking inept government throughout pandemic. like spectator piece sure enjoy this. ever get enquiry really end several careers involved. government get easy ride everything they've done really badly mismanaged Trump. grandma told brother come visit miss him. asked vaccinated yet said ""oh no, think that's necessary me""

Thankfully brother someone listens science said he'll wait he's vaccinated then. hell Biden fix, since discounted everything Trump did. Biden even realize he's alive. got shot yesterday (Biontech). work study data medical/scientific analyses medical device industry, talk depth several people there.

It's ppl refuse AZ now, majority. Right handed papers register talked lady, told tried discuss ppl came refused AZ, sends away. many ppl like that. sat there, getting shot talking doc, said I'm basically one would also taken AZ. 

What told FAAAAR worse realized. 

Our politicians fucked degree can't even fathom now.

The good thing: vaccination centers work like perfectly oiled machines. Within 15 min upon entering got shot. handle even more, there's capacity used. need vaccine doses. smarter population Yeah, good guess. I'm old people seeing families, I've seeing tv old people going meeting vaccinated friends, I'm seeing meeting larger groups public places even starting recreational travel again. even COVID deniers, know better. Admittedly, know common is, honestly annoys bit. I've spent year sacrificing going staying distanced people consideration unknowingly infecting them. moment get theirs, care anyone else risk that's still line act like everything 100% normal everyone else. least wait till everyone wants/needs one access one. sheesh. disappointing, guess selfishness fittingly American. Mom vaccined yesterday, sister monday, vaccined tuesday. much looking forward normal time.

Currently lot testing (we many free testing possibilities Austria) gathering still keep distance. almost one admitted hospital died flu year. Yes, probably cases there. virtually spread flu year, would seen represented hospitalizations. got first shot today also! also require 2 week quarantine like China? use hard lockdown import new cases later. lot old people vaccinated, less deaths. Let's forget fact young people land intensive care even survive likely occupy place double triple length old person used to.

In many places (EU, US), likely heading scenario non-covid excess deaths. Hospitals full young people covid immune old people triaged dying vanilla heart attacks.

Great job everybody. I'm noticing anytime people bring continuing safe get voted. 😏 That's vaccine, day vaccinated. ok take pain relievers vaccinated though UK back rebuilding empire trusted divide conquer. We've got cities like rest you. 


The issue lockdowns. live desert here. Silver lining: novavax probably going finish clinical trial way faster expected. real issue people need sign vaccines use sunscreen instead wear hat, long sleeve shirt pants. that, never get sunburned. everyone unvaccinated refused vaccine point time. Give couple months start mocking unvaccinated, I'm holding back everyone wants vaccine get one one do. know people influenza? tests influenza? ever got swab test confirm influenza? say people influenza test influenza? wonder dumb people like are, clearly there's lot upvoted post is. Let reframe dumb ""5 networks control 98% US population consumes"".... Propaganda legal. Good luck pretending twitter accounts lmao. still get it. woopdeedoo, old people coming rocks finally stepping foot nursing homes they'd normally anyway. 

If ask first people vaccinated (other healthcare workers course) people *already there*, day day, commuting trains buses working essential jobs - risk exposure, contracting it, spreading it. want nip spread newer variants? Prioritize *them*.

Ffs grocery store workers, warehouse workers, delivery drivers, cab drivers, *teachers*, every damn day since pandemic started, they're still even eligible vaccine states. 

We probably would've seen sharper decline new cases prioritized rather Mary Ann Bingo team. think things calm folks going lot trauma loss finally come terms around world. Loss terms loved ones passed away, also terms *time*. Think many moments experiences we've missed on. also tough. hope empathy roars back normal coming weeks months United States around world. fear what’s going happen many people saying won’t take vaccine. It’s going keep circulating years it’s mutating quite fast seems. takes bit bad luck rolling nature’s dice get mutation make current vaccines ineffective. everyone followed rules lockdown would've taken effect anytime soon least everything political debate, money health I'll checked shipped gf bring flies over, cheers! ""The US imported vaccines EU"" ""US producing vaccines domestically"" mutually exclusive. true. vast majority vaccines used US produced US also received vaccines EU top lol says country took 20.000.000 vaccines EU lot vaccines India. 

EU hand already shared 71.000.000 doses. Nah, new ones actually good. 

97 % infected people correctly identified infected. 
 
99,03 % infected correctly identified infected. 

This quick tested done via nose. not? tried hard.
And got far.
But end.
You still sound like dummy. talking choosing citizans first right? lets keep vacines made. 

Or mean people nation live in?? time understand nation big deal. Wow, world seems crisis. news changed much America vaccine rollout. Thank you, 46, hammering out. sad see what's happening world. Wish best. immunity possible outcome Covid 19. combination exposure vaccination. Covid eradicated. So, we’ll *all* reach herd immunity “one way another.” Took 20M doses? paid them. 

We proud vaccine industry help domestic market help many million people around world. 

By Q3 EU UK vaccinated, along Europe closest allies. celebrate fact getting together! well look curves lockdown, masks social distancing measures, we've ""flattened"" curves *with* said measures. there's date, worldwide. perhaps brightest question think Suez Canal ship disaster effect vaccine distribution? Let’s see science based longitudinal studies. dont see corono viros im picture question doctor Except that's nonsense assertion. (australia) thousands lab confirmed flu cases, 30+ lab confirmed flu deaths...... without testing? 

You clearly wrong. *Faux Gnus fairly effective opinion one wait two weeks second shot fully let guard accept fact many different mechanical studies covid masks last year would imagine wasn’t super clear beforehand.  that's nazis said. Good Friday actually next week! Yeah, weird Japan elderly population too, no?

Hopefully, we'll find right doubt last pandemic we'll see given we've potential swine flu, avian flu, SARS etc. last decades. Imagine Daily Mail getting snip hair cut lmao U.K. would detonate good. 😔 data whatsoever supports statement absolutely wrong, least Bavaria. seen anybody without mask supermarket least half year, likely even longer honestly can't even remember last time saw somebody without mask supermarket pandemic.

What? Learn read. talked FFP2 masks specifically. Bavaria mandatory use them, rest states either FFP2 surgical masks I'm BCN, Madrid. Madrid right wing mayor wants everything open.

Also photos lot recent French tourists thinking photos.

The hard lockdown like March May 2020. semi-lockdown started Xmas 2021 differs state. Cataluña one harsher ones. think simply mean 2nd doses priority rate deliveries enough serve 2nd doses. 

As UK 2 current vaccine providers prioritized 1st doses, means large amount people due 2nd dose, 1st dose administering slow down. Moderna, J&amp;J Novavax start delivering, 1st doses given again. made big deal EU decided ban vaccine exports them. probably producing vaccine deny obvious irrational selfishness. UK keeps vaccine supply domestic use - Hoarders!

UK donates 3.7M vaccines nearest European neighbour shares soft land border - Empire building! UK government also mentioned morning Moderna arriving mid April.

Also 'from Easter' still weeks away. unbelievable people think right virtue signal internet important someone else's ability clothe feed themselves. beg differ think concerns pressure applied FDA approve vaccines prior November. Nope, entire economy runs tourism wanted open summer.

In fairness, tourists needed covid tests though I'd surprised major cause subsequent cases. described top proper following Covid restrictions. refresh CDC website.

And evidence following covid restrictions decreases covid. There's single large populated country currently state covid lockdown United States is. does. read article years ago reporter events Boris speaking at.

At first event Boris arrived late speech, running room fluster messed hair wonky tie, speech made witty remark lateness everyone laughed at.

At second event entrance Boris arrived late, ruffled hair made look dishevelled, ran room put exact performance first event.  NI nowhere near 3-5,000 cases day. 7 day avg. like 154 atm. nonsense, given case rate entire UK around 5k day last couple weeks. tests done

Now that's wrong. everyone healthcare smart and/or reasonable. 

There seriously terrible people healthcare. ""twice contagious"" eliminate completely? see 2:1 ratio?

You know else completely eliminated lockdowns? Comon sense. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* jobless several months pandemic, indeed money health.

Im Luxembourg unemployment among young people skyrocketed nearly 30% lockdowns, couldnt care less right get sick give job. AFAIK home rapid tests need confirmation PCR tests rapid tests administered schools trained administrator don’t need confirmation Yesterday Northern Ireland 138 cases 2 deaths.... Something tells you’re preaching wrong crowd. Thanks trying. They'd better be, second dose appointment already booked in, moved supply issues I'm gonna fucking... absolutely nothing except whine it, I'll complain *really* hard, let tell you. mean huge stockpile unused doses second doses? refer deal made EU make sure exports blocked? Yes (and do), jobs, and/or study family see occasionnally lenient sharing maskless drinks same-age friends.

Covid restrictions would much effective everyone followed them.

And that's fallacy BTW. 🥺😭😭 Post American propaganda using Iranian Propaganda. Sounds legit. Well, actually kind like think I'm one contributing maintaining healthy level comon sense friend. experiencing killing fly nuke. Totally disproportionate. thought Germany done (ordered extra), Brussels chose ignore Germany it. would backfire skiw things diwn.

The easier solution pump Brazil full vaccins. enough local government Bolsonaro could stop tge vaccinations Merkel power wield 

This 15 years brainwashing looks like. COVID twice transmissible flu. influenza virus almost entirely eliminated lockdowns less contagious.
Where getting idea testing done? someone admitted hospital respiratory symptoms, they’re tested flu well COVID. Brazil offers clues. put body. Codified UN. Nobody tell take.

Also dont dramatize killing. kind person use science data dramatizes everything max extend. major impact people specific age category people severe health issues.

People covid Isolate. get low chance reinfection. data showing reinfections large.

Also many vaccines guarantee stop retransmission. Read scientific papers.

Are scared, take vaccine. Dont dictate others take it. choice. ""Europeans hilarious"" lol. pretentious af little sad. That's viruses champ I'm soooooo glad figured vaccines domestic manufacturing. thought exactly same. Even you’re vaccinated potential spread virus. actually mutates slower viruses.

But definitely going away. Vaccinations continu time come.

I suspect odds lot unvaccinated people eventually get it. least hospitals wont overrun. test flu? talking nonsense. get wrong, I'm sure vaccine good impact too, I'm saying can't properly seen compare figures peak start lockdown locked months.

The big difference compared previous lockdowns amount testing. everyone testing like mad going see much bigger difference peak lowpoint simply actual cases detected. never testing UK lockdown, expect higher numbers throughout, also bigger difference beak lowpoint. This.

But still using argument, get feeling next time guy repeat argument over. much use reasoning them. TBF, know long side effects last point, sequels eventually self heal, stay bad worsen. early sure survivors 60yrs. How? know people admitted flu? tests done. even extremely flawed ones, like rapid test give massive amounts false positives.

How possible flu spread, COVID spread? infection mechanism? Isreal cases collapsed around 50 percent vaccinated 1 dose UK getting close number. seeing western nations likely taking 100% excess deaths covid deaths. 

People driving less, fewer dangerous activities, getting flu due lockdown, etc etc. 

The baseline ""2019 without lockdown covid"", baseline ""lockdown without covid"", would lower total deaths. 29 million doses found Italy UK, going Belgium place.  part distribution process Get offs damn lawn! Cancel Merkel Interesting, area in? 

I’m 40 people know who’ve offered 50 either CEV healthcare. Fucking hope so, i've wanted since february last year damn bowl chips haha typo say june* changes type pace epidemic spreads. mask mandates steady slowly uprise line infections (going 1 - 1.5 - 2 - 2.5 - 3 - 3.5). masks, exponential (going 1 - 2 - 4 - 16 - 256 - 65536) progress number cases/fatalities. One factors fewer over-75-year-olds essential workers, meaning quicker vaccinate them.

Another factor ease nursing homes could targeted: know exactly many people living there, made available day given time, even already people staff give shots monitor side effects.

By focusing shots hospitals nursing homes initially, various groups involved effort opportunity start working kinks mood generalized distribution, supply, logistics sectors. certainly many, *many* issues later efforts, managed identify even solve issues affecting small, targeted population. Oh get that, obviously aren’t adhered everyone aren’t effective lot see people saying don’t work all, i.e even everyone totally compliant , wouldn’t impact Damn that's 14 generations infect whole world. Around 3 4 weeks generation whole world infected year. ifr around 1% access medical care would collapsed kind spread least 100 million would died worldwide including 3 4 million US. yeah lockdowns definitely way go. “Comrade?” Oh Christ. almost wish TD still around give Pepe pukes “safe space” you’ll leave rest us alone.

Genuine question, I’m hearing much conflicting information; it’s understanding vaccines lowers risk (or makes disappear) developing SEVERE case Covid dying it. still become infected transmit disease, even vaccinated people asked continue wearing mask. case? South America Eastern Europe, certainly. lots anecdotal reports India huge numbers deaths rural areas counted. I'd expect similar issues poor countries.

Iran also caught undercounting deaths insane degree, although appears deliberate lying rather incompetence. That's probably happening Russia well (Russia's excess deaths 400k region AFAIK). China North Korea complete mysteries, since doubt we'd even able get accurate excess death numbers.

The sad irony lot places really bad reputations (USA, Brazil, UK, Western Europe general) done better lot countries received significant attention all. Bernie anti-science, socially centric, fiscally center-right, etc. Please educate yourself. words, re-statement Ben Embarek, WHO’s leading animal disease expert, said team conducted scientific investigations four main scenarios SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, spread first, single person exposed SARS-CoV-2 direct contact host species, horseshoe bat. virus could circulating humans making breakthrough heavily populated second scenario, seen likely, involves transmission humans via yet unknown intermediary species. Liang Wannian, expert China’s National Health Commission, said pangolins potential candidates animals - including mink even cats - may also third possibility COVID-19 originated first second scenarios transmitted via cold chain products. Chinese experts attributed later COVID-19 clusters imported frozen food raised possibility might also caused Wuhan final scenario SARS-CoV-2 leaked Wuhan Institute Virology, known studied captive coronaviruses.

No. AmLo democratic socislist. He’s made Trump’s image dictator-lite centrist politics. May want check rest Europe sorry I’m gonna wear mask rest life 5% people that

And reason can't nice things. 

It's ""for rest life"", moron. attitude pitiful. people die auto crashes mean avoid getting car.

No, wear seat belt (mask,) obey traffic laws (social distancing,) air bag (avoid crowds, stay home possible.)

So sense analogy apt shows precautions still needed. Biden nothing increase Moderna Pfizer vaccine manufacturing. Trump also ""order"" vaccines, CDC did. Trump ""guy"" praising pushing back red tape (both Moderna Pfizer's vaccines would taken another year develop otherwise). least could do? Perhaps. credit still due due. give Biden credit something do. remember back people bashing US country NA poorly, ignoring metrics Mexico like tests per million. saying US done well Mexico tragic.

It’s least statistically reliable type evidence.

What see hear real life doesn’t always match actual stats say. RIP advance scientist... Someone numbers back said 75% sometime May keep pace probably take closer 70% Comparing Mexico Russia USA Brazil shows countries good job tracking deaths punished court public media opinion.

The former two countries far per capita deaths, latter two get negative attention. Politics plays extent, can't explain it, Western media hates Putin almost much hates Trump Bolsonaro. Kind sad acknowledge Brexit probably helped UK’s vaccination effort, unfortunate admit... right, context insensitive. making point there's bit difference 417,000 excess deaths deaths officially attributed Covid (as time post).

I spent day reading articles along lines 'Mexico goes past 200,000 Covid deaths', excess death numbers reliable probably happened sometime last year.

Yeah comment meant comprehensive want respond entire Gish Gallop. really wish people would consistent logic. blatant contradiction population density comment stood out. last reference cites study accounts population density across state Wisconsin, didn’t mask mandate late July, waited 2 weeks sent kids back college. seeded spike cases saw Wisconsin rest country.

Wisconsin harder one analyze governor sorta gets constantly fighting heavily-gerrymandered state legislature, wary court balance they'll strike down, counties want thing, strong anti-mask sentiment everything I've read. 

But yeah think critical part general summer. Case counts declined somewhat lot places, many governments got complacent, lifted restrictions high risk areas mask mandates, surges happened south people flocked high-risk indoor areas, remained high level elsewhere. Pointing winter surge (where maskless indoor household gatherings larger contribution spread) evidence masks failed silly, since largely dependent level virus currently community (in addition antimask policies many areas November). Far greater chance holiday gatherings spread virus base level contagion community much higher going in. Hard point get across among looking discuss good faith. That's fraction approximately 440 vaccinations. 
Also long take ppl get concrete appointments. vaccine roll bad testing roll out. Ya, would better countries stepped plate came vaccines instead waiting imports foreign countries.

But didn't, are. guys get massive covid surge control US see plans opening border BR Uh grocery store stocks tshirts buy sure.

 


But dedicated clothing stores open.

 


But like hair cut business whatever open non essential business. Well said start countries could made investments purchases. That’s way works. means likelihood vaccines efficacious variant, still retain modest efficacy, example. J&amp;J 72% US 64% SA Right, let's never go back person interactions ever again. Life indoors sitting front screen fine replacement outdated things like friendships, family, live music art. sit indoors consume media forever. /s  Brazil eventually everywhere Hi! So, short answer is: depends, general, risk transmission vaccinated likely much lower unvaccinated person.

The best data point Israeli data efficacy Pfizer vaccine, found prevents 97% symptomatic infections 94% asymptomatic infections. potentially suggests vaccine decrease transmission pretty dramatically -- person infected can't transmit virus! addition, community spread appears decreased dramatically populations vaccinated, suggestive potentially decreased transmission.

With said, couple things keep mind. First, obvious vaccines similarly effective -- fact, quite likely vaccines suppress transmission less others. Second, studies *directly* measure transmission; rather, measure amount symptomatic asymptomatic infection, use decrease interpret likely decrease transmission. Finally, likely risk *zero*, per se -- although that's rarely case anything medicine.

Hope helps! shock! B117 ravaging Europe, states lifting restrictions mask mandates. really expect? hey real kicker: variants deadly younger ones too. No, get jab worry more. amount people think “I recovered, nothing else bad could possibly happen

By large people *okay* COVID. COVID, fine, vaccinated now. people long lasting symptoms tho, sucks. Hell, don’t wear masks outside now. Follow science outdoor spread chances slim nil. Yes you’re like 92 percent two weeks first dose. Basically full efficacy Oh, forgot, checked (white, elderly hippie) uncle local Walgreens DAYS availability.  refusing get shot scared. pointed lived polio, gotten shot. needs get scrawny butt Walgreens. knocked concern cost told GO ALREADY. Interesting definition achievement. 

I wouldn’t consider Fauci contradicting Trump achieving anything. fact, I’d say actually made things worse US. 

Is possible contradicting trump making virus political actually smart choice Birx don’t properly understand events took place last year? Birx said Trump “so attentive scientific literature &amp; details &amp; data. think ability analyze &amp; integrate data comes long history business really real benefit” mean buy tshirt store that’s opened groceries? would part store closed?  new me. Seems vaccines “neutralizing capability “ significantly downgraded. claiming it’s on/off switch? Jesys fyking chryst.... Yes, deaths delayed. more. Stop fucking hopium. Wear mask, help others get vaccinated shut mouth. white washing facts annoying negating covid altogether. literally impossible. Non-essential shops closed Germany months daycares unless parents worked hospitals etc.  UK ended running capacity anyway.

no think big part overwhelming medical system mortality rate. time period neighbor ER doctor said strains COVID ER someone coming heart attack might able treated medicine released.  Looks like steady increase me. week ending 3/19 actually decrease relative week before. ""Absolutely skyrocketing"" bit travel private jets don’t go security lines like normal people. There’s express route them. What's US on? Japan one never heavy restrictions. knowledge fully vaccinated person approved US vaccines dying covid? Like 2-3 weeks second dose maximum immunity? open three weeks mate closed 4 1/2 months Aries best :) Yet another article pretending isn’t huge issue people mild cases followed long Covid. Hospitalizations deaths *not* thing talking about, J&amp;J talking point downplay difference 94% relative effectiveness contracting Covid-19 vs significantly lower effectiveness.

Commence downvoting. Incredibly easy, car gas money. elderly in-laws drove 45 minutes scheduled drive-thru locations. military orchestrated precision, thanks assistance MS National Guard.

They live capital MS, drove 45 minutes capital get shots. Granted, bus service speak MS, state requires car, period. ironic needed leave capital (which multiple major hospitals) get processed shot. though. Reducing case growth pitiful 2% prevent winter wave. Mask mandates work. system like yellow fever vaccine? must option that's digital, excluding lot people.

Yeah that's take, massive tours happening industry banking on. lot venues open sports anyways think it'll hard find crew (maybe I'm underestimating skill sets, I'll apologize that's case) it'll come logistics line state laws/guidelines part international touring headliners want respond pandemic. Oh point reducing ""case growth rates"" direct effect cases. Every state got hit hard, mask mandates failed.

Reducing case growth rates would result less cases growth rates higher. Mask mandates worked. Chill out, want ""drag"" us back social lives, traveling, visiting family friends, seeing concerts generally living meaningful life. want live new normal things part life anymore. point EMA suspend use AZ vaccine after. IMO business travel 100% permanently dead. Fauci *didn't* do, acquiesce Chumps pressure. parrot back word salad.

Birx, spent time carrying Chumps water, sat blathered UV enemas, bleach hotshots. vaccinated 19M US week. Despicable. Like non sbux coffee chain job, essentially. Fuck bullshit selves. really deserve worst. everyday use, difference breathability.

And 98% effective compared like 30% article says.  isn’t exactly perfectionism means, worry much every shot 100% guaranteed perfect date mark? Oh shit, guess filtration vary wildly different models. one referring [with 35% me. Super relaxed though want anything.  Nice whataboutism. 

Leads thousands deaths? everyone else vaccinated could lead thousands deaths?

You sound much like someone speaking emotional, logical state. know doctors don’t want vaccine. gulag guess? “Years”....we’re, like, 2 months away done shit US behaving like going prolong it. act like decent fucking human couple months great summer. isn’t exactly perfectionism means, worry much every shot 100% guaranteed perfect date mark? Way less fakes N95s. comperable really. article day said % people plan get vaccine dropped lot amongst college students? hard! Omg!

He lost Instagram account last month: 'On 11 February 2021, Instagram account permanently deleted ""for repeatedly sharing debunked claims"" COVID-19 vaccines.'

What sad legacy family suffered... ""Work environment"" CA's criteria; elaborate. article quite clear writer know criteria used vaccination. actually know criteria (if any) used, right? We're BMI comment chain gone topic (which bad), BMI criteria also conjecture.

In response edit, issue comment. We're conjecturing going on. However, believe lower risk high-weight in-shape people versus high-weight out-of-shape people found, weight may (or may - I'd say ""we know"") risk factor regardless whether muscle, fat, (presumably tall people) bone.

Back BMI topic, suspect NBA players particularly high BMIs. weight divided height, all, they're mostly medium weight really tall. quick google search turn 25-30 range (Steph 23, Lebron 27), though. Wish people that. guys really believe either delaying interested taking vaccine jabs anti-science? 

It's like 18th century religious groups keep gaslighting atheists like morons atheists want stay alone want get involved religions religious groups kept spewing like atheists, world morality going dumber dumber people ethics, morality human civilizations? 

I understand vaccine effect preventive measure. sake delaying jabs, dont give benefits doubt? 

I'm sure reddit PC MSMs controlled news space. take vaccination downvoted oblivion. They’ve already said won’t let foreigners Olympics. point what’s point? let people long don’t attend Olympics enact everyone wants vaccine gets one, sometime August anyway. case numbers November right huge christmas, new years spike. We're actually pretty bad place right now. Especially knowing deaths lag behind. look around board. ""Covid over! I'm burning mask! can't stop going bar! Open er up!"". dumbasses fueling Everyone that's high risk gotten now. Yeah UN UN things flailing. countries name only. idea equal stake vaccine laughable. personally went volunteered mass vaccination site week ago could get mine get done. believe really want it, get (in many states, anyway). Another thing note though say rate 0.1% us detected 30 million cases, 500k deaths, 1 60, way 0.1. Well that's quite assumption making, it. Problem never know kn95s. little quality control lots fakes True people get vaccinated quickly want get back normal, sooner go away. Great news pilots! Regional airlines already hiring again. I've already put three applications, three thought would able put year. Remains seen. lose market share someone travels, damn well better believe biz travel return. political sides work together using Hegelian Dialectic, Divide Conquer Order Chaos? Anyway, half brain could see psyops going across board US years now. whole media bought controlled behind scenes Council Foreign Relations. Virtually everyone that's high risk vaccinated now. over. matter people get it. Keep vaccinating everyone let's get herd immunity move on.

But that's sub wants do, it? want move on. Covid given pathetic lives purpose. That’ll one hell hangover! No, probably people allowed work. ""flip script"" fit timeline? sick long. think disappeared Taco Bell got hands it. Lots 3rd world countries less excess deaths. Mongolia Philippines example. Thats tough situation in, one probably amazingly common nowadays rift anti-vaxxers/maskers listen science. smartest moral thing would tell parents exactly worried why. Guilt trip brother either getting vax masking parents back it. way change anti-vaxxers mind give incentive far able glean. Science Logic seem work, guilt authority figures(parents) pushing might break through. Either way dont, tried responsibility make choices them, adapt keep things safe best can. true, nothing lose sleep over. Hospitalizations cases moving up, deaths still dropping, slower were.

There's still lot unvaccinated people, they're ones getting sick. shots get out, smaller ""wave"" Omg masks another months! horror! Yes that’s true. supply SoCal Central Valley. Bay Area shortage. Yup. It’s getting worse. Tell hear bill dreams now. keeps asking bring Taco Bell. pick cell phone ask she’s walking around tracking device. Plenty types speech already illegal US whether dumb people listen (libel, certain obscenity laws, incitement etc) see criminalizing misinformation harms public health medical emergency different statistical point view excess deaths caused covid. either it, hospitals full prevented people get care needed. 

Fun fact: influenza deaths due covid. total covid deaths more, compensated excess death count lower number ofinfluenza deaths. think vast majority people page, there's lot impatience frustration going around. I'm interested see numbers cases stemming event would be. I'd like optimistic hope people followed guidelines see effective masks tests events like would short term future. Yep, art natural brands sold really widely! wish shocked see report. Social distance basketball might awesome watch. Pfizer consistently robust immune response feel like “stake out” float needed. summer, everybody gets together posts “his section” river. anchor floats, chill good time. Bonus, we’re piss wife off. wear show hardly massive inconvenience? vaccinated people stopped wearing them, means unvaccinated we'll massive spread. live practically normal life otherwise, wear mask social distance public areas now. Maybe less 75,000 new cases day 1200 deaths might fucking start. mean holy shit epic cognitive fail batman. justice system couldn’t track behind capital siege literally carried flags, signs, shirts name doubt they’ll “be able to.” Russian bots again. true. Thanks president Trump heavy lifting continuing it. I'm guessing many vaccinated people immune, safe worst effects virus, open full resources attention hospitals take care seriously sick people without overwhelmed way many facilities last year. nightmare stuff. read experts say variants, afraid become. reason said phase 1 trials specifically obviously first people receive vaccine, they're ""longest term"" recipients (I assume that's works, anyway) Huh? They’re still working it, tons people arrested prosecuted. planning visit Japan everything turns normal, got vaccined sinovac shot. There’ll problem Japan doesn’t approve shot? Nope, signed normally. places longer verifying. Supply catching demand. Muslims notoriously want make people, especially men, Muslim. belief system mouth visible—I mean, seen hijab? Could cover face more? suspect driven unvaccinated. variants going tear stupid population. Nah, look Israel, numbers plummeted hit 50% Thank you, however think way get 90% weird. see 14 28 days 2129 people infected control group 927 infected vaccination group. 
I part vaccination campaign got moderna myself, however wish numbers explained more. honest would get vaccine Serbia could. warning taking shot get ahead symptoms.
Taking Tylenol Advil better tolerate actual symptoms fine. possible, sense true India would alone South Korea Japan countries world without significant increases mortality course 2020. banning export time, bear mind Indian develop vaccine that's really case, viewpoint hard convince someone anti-vax anti-science. Israel feel end coming.

Like feeling December January time anticipating lives thrown positive kind chaos trying adjust life without COVID restrictions masks. I'm worried U.K. variant going massacre kids schools reopen. suspect that's what's driving meteoric rise cases Michigan. think 500,000 dead adults bad?  

Wait couple hundred thousand kids. link reports us? Curious read them. knew either Joseph Mercola Mike ""the Health Danger"" Adams would make list. Number one, baybee! “Even vaccinations increase”

Wow, infuriating, disingenuous headline. Even vaccinations increasing, still people haven’t gotten single shot have. still ways go getting close herd immunity. surprising cases would go again?? mega rich people India- need to
enough money give people basic income lock period.
I think really killer mutation virus going come place like India people living close together already really robust immune responses.
An virus going killer somewhere like Australia mostly live different mean, things two things. Seems like reasonable guess. Thanks! so? People don’t respond questions? There’s “just” people Double edged sword. significantly higher mortality people wouldn’t need government tell stay home, wear masks, etc. Everything political, human experience side. anyone ever read ingredients bottle sunscreen? Hey Spain, welcome mid 2020, gonna love it.

From, Kiwi. Learning nothing one year? Genuinely humour might best way Well fucking shit Imagine stupid r/masks4all Tell got booster shot take it. everytime around OP tracked too. mean, can't criticise government handling crisis yet travel incubating fuselages super spreader light candle. go look clinical trial publications vaccine took, antibody titer data there, although know directly comparable depending testing methodology.

Also keep mind cell-based immunity memory B memory cells important circulating antibodies, cannot measured easily. 

I'm sure well antibody titers actually correlate likelihood future infection, use antibody levels time measuring cell-based immunity way complex expensive. 

If detectable levels antibodies vaccination would take win concerned. thinking CRISPR see that's bad add delete certain cells including viruses still years away also medicine gotten sophisticated since 1918 Influenza Outbreak “long covid” cult based little science “covid flu” cult.

Israel even ahead still mask mandate enforced.  Except...

Also ask heard try change mind? No, ethanol (the kind drink sanitize with) group 1 carcinogen.

Ethanol alcohol (like alcoholic drinks). listed ""probable"" carcinogen way bodies break (it turns toxic), near level carcinogen Methanol Benzene. Yup, makes think bad, imagine shitty virus would feel Yes newer variants. vast majority people die still old.

If variants killed young people easily killed old people, would incredibly obvious death rates would astronomical.

Also, post evidence ""the vitamin thing debunked"". Yup, also make angry post /r/Seattle mean, would divide us conquer us? Back 2000s like ever stopped government whatever hell want do. parties worked together control us back pretty openly. Divide conquer would imply outside power going swoop conquer us, philosophy make sense internally. US conquer US? 

The issue one party (the GOP) previously controlled majority money, previously held majority stake policy post-Reagan, watching followers die money leech new industries due agenda destroyed developing world. party (the Dems) gleefully accepting success they're handed passively thanks investments innovation, phony ""progressivism"", etc. GOP getting desperate maintain party they're starting realize party demise inevitable current republic. realization conveniently occurred time ability essentially brainwash masses thanks social media algorithms trained literally billions brains once.

Here’s scenario clarity. live rural county, couple times every week vaccine clinic anyone get vaccinated regardless qualifications current phase. want friend get first shot since county this. would come back county 3-4 weeks later second dose, schedule they’re from? Would qualify current phase still, would pharmacy assume since they’ve already first dose? Yah, you’re trying win relay race anchor it’s already over. You’re trying purist it’s over. lost.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* brits lie, news 11. Ahh, must misunderstood then. 520 million doses small number single dose, might reach saturation point. Still need time actually put doses arms also take spillage account, beginning August perhaps bit realistic? depends vaccination rate experts predicting herd immunity end spring. even don’t, vaccine widely available everyone wants get it, Biden encouraging May 1 many states earlier, people gonna start dropping restrictions precautions left right. 

And me, don’t care there’s limited capacity baseball game long go. don’t care mask inside restaurant long go. want able see parents without wear mask. that’s idea “done” point. don’t need mosh pit signal end pandemic. Idiot me- guy high DEA going setting restrictions loose without damaging NHS, realistic political option. vaccinated people means less people hospital less transmission, means looser restrictions. people fail get second jab end hospital, one hospital stays strong argument tighter restrictions. Yesterday officer Broward County (Ft. Lauderdale area) died Covid.  48. eligible vaccine, FL available first responders 50, yet men women dealing spring break crowds. right. real, politically able go alone EU.

Why not? Clean air simple common sense. Elon

Uh isn’t one people? Roomers still around days? (replace R ""Roomers"" ""D"" word get comment removed reason) 420M since start Q2, counting doses already received Q1. Also, J&amp;J one dose regimen perhaps AZ able export US India end Q2 may revise expectations upwards. Mid July full vaccination pretty ambitious goal. think it’s doable, beginning August probably bit realistic goal, take delays, spillage administering bottlenecks account. It’s proven there’s probably little chance harm. Reducing particles theory good moving around room get filter creates issues. Example restaurant China people two tables got slow steady blast air directionally. Outdoor air quite random even ‘prevailing’ winds dissipates clear necessarily works one thing really clear: BASIC research done redone. understanding things really old outdated knowledge. study hand transmission, air transmission, airflow effects, toilet plume, elevators, cars, ventilation systems etc... we’ve hearing repeating things years like germs hand contact. Maybe, one. also need develop proper PPE strategy. architects role play. Physical design spaces airflow crap, even hospitals clinics. sending best. $120,000/person? That's $92k USD. means WA richer pretty much country. God damn. normal. example, Pfizer says room temp 6 hours. Moderna 12 hours. They’re going inject freezing vaccine you. think make economic arguments ways. health measures protect life matter living, healthy people contribute Economy. GDP US heavily weighed personal spend (and ability via income), life expectancy also significant. 


Previously healthy people expected live another 5-25 yrs died prematurely, far frequent sick time used across working population lowering productivity, long short term negatives economic growth. 

A lot jobs lost lower income service industry, hence they’ve constantly thrown extra unemployment / eviction protection / stimulus direction. still negatively affecting way many people, it’s hard everyone different reasons. literally FDA EUA list. one listed ""No longer EUA approved"" list.  Mexico really need wall   India proposed remove Patent covid vaccine UNO . RICH WESTERN COUNTRIES agreed . HIV /AIDS control medicine 80-90s . US president BUSH, European countries imposed sanctions banned Indian medical exports qualified cheaper , millions dying due HIV/AIDS African countries , thousands West.

Western countries want pharmacy money saving millions lives . 

Better know History world first , blaming poor countries trying save lives . ability videogame/running/cooking/whatever love lunch time :) Well, antivaxxers people medical conditions can't vaccine, children young vaccines point. Oh folks want vaccine available yet keep distributing antivaxxer land get used instead places want them. mask linked tested 90+% filtration rate even list provided. Give one filtration test actually matches list CDC. often wonder myself. sensible people realised climate change serious problem 20 years ago, politicians journos waking it. :surprised pikachu face: (Reuters) - European Union exported 77 million doses COVID-19 vaccines 33 countries since Dec 1, 2020, head European Commission Ursula von der Leyen briefed EU leaders summit Thursday.

8 million doses went UK alone February. I’m addition, young people like can’t even get vaccinated yet- course numbers age group going up. point allowed go creates less tourism. think get teleported ruin site without overflowing nearby cities? Amazes little people learned this. Don’t force report lot non-fact checked information. 

Yesterday, saw post someone named “Ben” received J&amp;J vaccine Chelsea/NYC died later day. interesting first time saw comments saying people hesitant share story verified. true, sad. However, found information corroborating post. Lol saw too, must kids HS article didn’t finish name joke? got AstraZeneca market town surgery Saturday. planned cycle let go soon could get formalities. overheard somebody say hoped 2000 day. mp3 player headphones never used them. Today slightly tender left shoulder side effects. obvious signs traffic congestion, people happy drive probably booked jabs larger sites town. think we're talking 2 different things. saying lot poor people India, I'm saying country they're one fastest growing gdp earth continue long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I agree many poor india due inequality. also many poor US reasons, yet considered poor country. doomed repeat history. We're still ending prohibition stage, psychedelics weed. Post pandemic going parties social golden age, another huge market crash, war. time likely China, quote that, uneducated high-dea I've stuck awhile 420 million enough 47% EU population assume two dose regimen. nearly enough anything close herd immunity. hope suspect number delivered vaccines July bit higher that. industry traveling much ever business. Three far, no, sorry way ""negligable"", even macro policy level. new, deadly variants coming every day know number gauranteed rise children vaccinated.

And argument discompassionate almost absurd. parent willing infect child COVID-19 restrictions eased irrational? Yikes. good, people know second shot delayed anything additional helps. clear, Italian police satisfied. need tin-foil hats. beat anything. There's always chance illness return, nothing strength ability ""beat"" something. Lord. idiotic behavior reached equilibrium previous strains. new strains infectious longer equilibrium. general think people cautious real world. certainly true me. Ikr, begin every story “guess what?” second Pfizer shot knocked ass. Thought fine 6 hours late woke sporting fever, weakness, soreness over, weakness. hope ends soon. feel like hell. Thank :) that's case, America incredibly poor, since majority nation less $1000 name. behavior really blame surges.

Of course is. ""it's over"" attitude apparent even sub, normally *more* COVID-cautious general population. apparent government proclamations lifting restrictions mandates. apparent walking past restaurants major US cities. Yeah cos it’s like Elon throwing fit allowed open worst pandemic anything... someone help understand this? got vaccine can't get real sick still pass virus someone else? like people paying doctors write cause covid government saying people dying pulmonary complications, covid 🙃  easily verify brand reputable looking filtration tests. posted specific brand / mask. one posted already removed CDC / FDA list long ass time ago failed filtration tests. I've also seen reported many cases second Pfizer shot delayed far beyond 12 week gamble due lack supplies. re-watch movie Airplane lol.  Excess deaths necessarily directly caused covid ""first world"" imperialist terminology 2nd/3rd world offensive terms. better. Certainly lot unreported deaths (for Mexican government 320k 420k excess deaths due covid) also unexpected increase mortality

Certainly many unreported deaths (for Mexican government 320k 420k excess deaths due covid), also increase non-covid mortality (hospitals collapsed several times many people able get treatment etc.) astrazeneca 2 months ago, alive sarcastic ever. Gates 5g banging. 79, Bitches!! ((Proceeds flip everyone)) fair, lockdowns cause massive devastation marginalized communities US. I'm lockdowns wished US stronger lockdowns poverty increased, fragile communities got worse, people lost businesses. kept going work reduced hours months. long term drawbacks regarding much money save bills cannot speak everyone. Yeah throwing switching generics bought Trader Joe’s. Nah man, *virus* virus. lockdowns could much much shorter everyone pulled together 3-4 weeks year ago. no. Idiots screech “their freedoms” Impeached President told ignorant followers would go zero days (over year ago). sorry hard people. truly wish people would responsible last year instead purposefully stupid reckless heads European Union’s executive’s vaccine task force, reiterated RTL radio TV channel LCI European Union deliver 420 million doses COVID-19 vaccines mid-July, enough allow bloc reach collective immunity. Nope isnt, that's narrative uses. Thanks, source debunk may ? production meet demand, Trump administration royally fucked contracting melt blown fabric facilities hedge risks. Companies willing produce melt blown fabric necessary produce masks, Feds want pay up. data private hospitals one best shows 10% death probability enter hospital. public service number goes 50%. Especially looks like seasonal disease. country referring to? third wave United States. Europe rise cases associated schools /u/swayedperception

/u/RareIdol Please keep reposting every day! That's fine. yesterday aunt told went local Stater Bros saw half people without masks. That’s PA put many people early phase. Hard move 2/3s adult population “priority.”  opinion they’re going sued absolute oblivion “vaccine passports” decidedly unconstitutional pretty useless. fantastic! great UK could contribute world effort way! tagged USA really clear, I'm anti-lockdown. lockdown China amazing job stopping covid dead tracks. Also, lockdown measures reasons friends Thailand South Korea able live pretty normal lives now. 

I friends Asia countries they've able manage disease help lockdowns. Unfortunately, Philippines seems exception rule. say lockdowns ineffective, I'm expert seems like tragedy Philippines local issues. 2022 mine :(

Honestly every little thing persuades people getting vaccinated better, don’t care little passport thing, free donut $100 gift card want thing over. hospitalizations sharp rise, disturbing. percentage critical care units slowly starting go up, soon say they're accelerating not. hope plateaus. No, really. times reason party fun things time didnt ""get enough it"" first good party. time insane partying me. That's probably true now, we've talking reopening schools since last spring, definitely vaccinations near future. They've always trying say safe conditions like good social distancing modernized ventilation know going followed much time, still pushed reopen anyway.

I agree teachers vaccinated ok schools open, lot pushes vaccinations nonsense imo. they’re saying 19 people dying brilliant. entire point. they’re celebrating 1181 people saved, would **absolutely** call brilliant. Lol, that's argument? furry?! sure would even get idea, laughably wrong otherwise. 

Survival rates stratified age, per CDC:

0-19 Years 99.997%

20-49 Years 99.98%

50-69 Years 99.5%

70+ 94.6% /u/swayedperception

/u/RareIdol think good years, likely 2024 2025. That's realities climate change set in. NY NJ got sucker-punched even knew country against. think fair look situation response recent developments, ancient history year ago. think commentor meant Mexico handling better people taking COVID seriously - mask wearing, temp checks, sanitizing. No. June 10 ish.

May 1(1st dose) May 21(2nd dose)June 5(fully done)

Or May 11 J&amp;J people. Vaccinating UK help world variant circulating. It’s hard one it’s death within 28 days positive test. 

Someone could past Covid stroke day 25 counted.

We need really looking excess deaths rather deaths per day I’m genuine... talking about? 

No. things obvious breach law already existence practice can’t “written law” ... thing? 

Also murder definitely legal ahah.

Never miss oportunity party things outside. already party animal become double now. mind COVID passports international travel. However, bit excessive use things like going movie. forbid all, that's millions people traveling every day live Paris sick smug, narcissistic attitudes lot people. sure living denial, crazy. I'm honestly starting deal anger issues folks causing travel restrictions prolonged. Heaven forbid live without socializing aperitifs...I seen family year. Thanks explanation. I’m view, what’s going happen NY’s passport program, program planned summer rollout hinted Biden administration? really want Vaccine, apply one pretence ""unpaid carer"". 

Many people skipping queue. sounds shocking, ammount people want vaccinated great news. many daily covid deaths would unacceptable you? We're living Utopia, looking statistical point view, 19 deaths amazing. Kids fine. vaccinated point. Stay classy wasn’t meant that, meant lockdowns around world, yes viruses natural, bad like one causes unnatural circumstances, also never existed year ago, sustainable let “natural” us. moving average +2.71M doses per day, highest 3.3M reported today, 1.9M (58%) first doses.

Not good. Vaccines failing already? quick, back square one guess... Lots pent-up saving spent means entertain without relying businesses. That's rural houses, camping gear, computers, ""toys"" currently selling like crazy. Let's ask volunteers stay locked free doses export.  Come everyone. Maybe start petition....sign want dose exported. people living apartheid rule ethnic cleansing - yes, get much much worse. CDC recommends 21 days first second doses Pfizer. Heads anyone wants follow CDC: Walgreens refuses set second dose 21 days! You’re confusing actions laws, legality constitutionality.

Murder legal law says so.

Vaccine passports written law. law later declared unconstitutional court, happens, law remains, de facto, constitutional.

And again, opinion non-judge irrelevant. even actually, Mexico never closed borders made obligatory quarantine testing. Source: I'm mexican That’s issue! Well mean it’d best less people vacationed right now. going go doesn’t matter you’ve vaccinated, wear mask. still spread others. go vacation don’t wear mask, basically saying “I don’t care health wellbeing around you.” POS. Nope yet, I'm going call week see anything changed given Doug Ducey's lift COVID-19 restrictions. still businesses however agree with. think governor early easing restrictions given 30% maricopa county residents vaccinated least 1 dose Phizer Moderna. Exactly. Die covid starve? No. give does. may occasionally forget put mask entering store seeing others wearing reminds put mine on. sub means nothing. It’s conglomeration many different districts, countries even languages together. local laws people voted matter whatever area in. personal opinion subject digress. astonishing watching live. Well probably someone doesn’t care unvaccinated kids. listening anime podcast brought people actually habit washing hands/using sanitizer wearing masks would probably go pretty far reducing con flu. Oh please, show PhD epidemiology infectious disease. spouting nonsense. Yeah I'm going listen furry scientists. Fuckin hell. people like everything wrong US right now. know 50% people average intelligence? Realize fall kindly shut fuck already don’t think anyone’s arguing front helping get everyone’s tourism economy back full swing, there’s major difference vacationing March 28 end June regards vaccination efficacy people die.  die, enough mental fortitude? sure. a.) people making argument aware thing b.) unfortunate side effect many teachers, worked state followed model long enough receive pension (even small), negatively impact ability receive social security upon retirement work **did** contribute system would otherwise eligible receive benefits upon retirement (e.g., work 10 years DC [no social security] 20 years New York [social security], receive reduced pensions due lack sufficient time either system - addition, social security would received time working NY and/or non-teaching jobs before/after teacher reduced due public pension “windfall” provision). mentioned elsewhere wouldn’t really issue WEP. Income metric means nothing without ones, like healthcare. 7-day moving average +2.71M doses per day, highest record. 

Out 3.3M reported today, 1.9M (58%) first doses. Ah yes. I’m judge can’t tell murder illegal. Logic solid gold lmfao happy guys. wish Biden would ship more. neighboring country interest vaccinated quickly, moral thing given AZ even approved yet. Anti-vaxxers hypocrites childhood vaccinations complaining COVID vaccination. want see fast anti-vaxxer gets ass doctor get tetanus shot stepping rusty nail. Ok, I’m wondering little bubble circles mean chart? line apparently number cases? CDC recommends 21 days first second doses Pfizer. Heads anyone wants follow CDC: Walgreens refuses set second dose 21 days! hope Reddit leave pandemic less racist towards India Indians.

Never gonna happen. written law decides what’s legal. courts rule action carried within law not. 

That’s correct, don’t understand disagreement is.

And you’re judge, opinion irrelevant. 95% less likely to. Keep mind that’s likely age related well, young healthy person probably even less likely to.

There nonessential travel ban time. much enforced either country. Agreed. rot. facebook account kind social media presence, absolutely room complain type mitigation. 

What ever living fuck this?

You're required Facebook go places. I'm happy number first doses. decreasing two days straight now. also advocating masks social distancing COVID first entered US. argued travel bans cases started rising Eastern countries. hate constant virtue signaling. People ""care"", media tells care. act like vaccine documentation/vaccine travel passports new thing.

Please see: yellow fever, malaria, polio. think better, sensitive words use “brilliant”. nothing brilliant people dying, matter way view it. funny every country antivaxxer, antimasker idiot fan base. I'm sure varies, like America. rich Philippines play rules, plenty people trying follow rules, many people live situations social distancing pretty much impossible. 

Countless large families packed tightly together, living hand mouth eking livings industries never really safety standards. people driving trikes, hawking street food, working factories way ""work remotely."" 

It's always seemed like Philippines worst worlds, restrictions seriously hurt economy actually able stop spread. Actually virus natural. 

Hundreds thousands people die every year viruses, many deaths preventable exact measures prevent covid deaths. 

And don’t think deaths kills someone know. think death while, go right back thinking them. TL;DR Around 14 days start see difference number cases vaccinated unvaccinated people. No. number people dying heart disease 70 liver disease 60 drops 80% concerted public heath effort, that's massive victory. Yeah, Russia Asia nobody refers Asians. babe.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* several super responsible friends headed Hawaii April. idk depends talk able visit sun room outside masks home made official yet. Hopefully coming weeks. Try again... vaccine cannot prevent infection, help fight infected. Public health regulations stopping anyone traveling. Mexico City speeding vaccinations elderly (the goal give first shot half people 60 couple days Easter— half already it). boroughs they’ll using Sputnik, AZ. don’t know guys feel US shipping doses helped pick pace, don’t know thankful am. shhhh \^hi 100% serious. Courts decide legality laws; individuals. That’s works that’s always worked. figuring people want last forever. glean hope shut immediately. Ah gotcha. think would count zero death days then. offices closed though go unreported “catchup” Tuesdays numbers. personally wouldn’t worry, it’s irrelevant question.

Why would worry vaccine passport you’ve vaccinated?  know every time come sub (which every months face place pretty depressing) say cases hospitalizations going up. Every time. look data, even close reality.

Up relative. Every significant metric regarding COVID DOWN. Way dropping fast. continue vaccinate day. Meaning reasonable person would conclude path pretty fixed right continue get much better.

(Oh boy finally get say it, sub loves phrase) wait two weeks! Masks spit guards (idk that's name, thing that's like face shield goes mouth) probably required kitchen staff restaurants going forward, general food safety standpoint. Climate/weather pretty big driver delaying 1st wave warmer states summer 2020, whereas colder states hit earlier spring.

At time explanation weather - either cold hot - driving people indoors. Chichen Itza days ago. 100% everyone masks on. stop going road site make sure everyone wearing mask. 

Now.. everywhere else Mexico.. kills 0.23% people infects. Flu kills. 0.10%....

Where draconian measures last 100 years?

Fuck outta statist bullshit. Keep licking govt boot. would throw common example? Obviously can't guarantee covid lots things make covid free humanly possible essentially same. 

They 5000 person concert Spain day required negative test get in. types events popular even thought hey can't ""guarantee"" it. That's really great news, know that, considered lower viral load would limit meaningful exposure. thanks sharing that! nothing. likely protection 9 days. also ""cases"" started diverging placebo vaccine groups 12 days actually likely caught covid 2-14 days prior day caught covid likely well day 12. point day 9 10 likely protection caught lunch today. anyone else live town people completely ignore mask requirements stores? kinda weird here. Even there's sign door person checkout/counter wearing one. look like I'm weirdo following rules put up. think vaccine useless then. care people it? going protect protect either. taking vaccine consider effective? somebody says vaccinated, trust them. need require evidence vaccination. Lemme get straight. want mostly white country invade Latin American country, overthrow democratically elected president, force needles people’s arms? I’m sure work well. wonder would happen government partnered businesses set incentives people get shot. I'm sure people would interested getting shot material reward. maybe would perceived bribe turn people off.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* You’d partially correct talking something like tetanus  First, unclench pearls. propaganda. They're declaring major Covid victory UK actually we're worst hit Europe top five world (worse factor unregistered deaths per capita, we're worst affected world) decisions actions one worst governments history country, reframed victory. 

Boris Johnson tried delay vaccine rollout two weeks get fucking Union Jack sticker vial, care helping people re-opening economy ""war time"" hero. certain people rejected Pfizer vaccine (which always tested slightly better) ""want British one"". best vaccine one get soonest.

The UK vaccine program great huge amounts waste plan list extra leftover doses. can't even build list. mention millions wasted taxpayer money spent ""world beating"" track trace system never, ever worked.

Multi-omni-shambles. government claim victory papers laugh people dying Europe whove bothed vaccine response fantastic initial response (they tried include us massive PPE buy Q1 2020 refused) we'll claim another win British exceptionalism pat back 160k dead.

You're welcome see things different way, world views. please take second look around you. Lol ignoring happens sake positivity pretending. feel like think you’re really smart sentence. Youre literally saying nothing. literally thing. “evidence” research exist. I've never ready part statistic. April 1st can't wait think too, also thought lot things point. I’m trying keep open mind. hope late summer mask mandates lifted everyone chance get vaccine. argument waiting might take longer? User name checks Oh, maybe you’re right! Except one little thing: Covid much likely infect someone else flu!

Once covid goes “flu” levels, back square one. means people usual 50% people get yearly flu shot.

Next! cares? masks easy.  claimed France equalled EU. dishonest. link provided describes levels vaccine hesitancy France, Germany, Italy, Spain together contain half EU's population. sure 90%+ Scandis get vaccinated.

Oh, *sure* you. person complains source covering EU countries believes *their* claims require evidence they're *sure* it. Hypocrite. vacccinated care antivaxxers anti maskers around you...and everyone wants vaccine gets one, one left care antivaxxers happens people antivax Israeli data shows 94% reduction asymptomatic spread Pfizer vaccine.

Public health offficials choosing words carefully - they’ve stating *we don’t know sure* asymptomatic spread possible, definitely occurs. data emerged recently points vaccines effective preventing spread, that’s great news.

And makes sense - lower viral load body replication blocked naturally means lower amount virus spread onward.  chart might referred fully vaccinated. far know, one received second dose AZ yet. 

Like commenter said, [there Malta got hands extra doses, claim heavily criticized. uptake going pretty well, 900 unused vaccines 203,000 received far. I’ve Mexico plenty times, that’s irrelevant discussion. Lmao, nice pivot I'm going delta ""individuals receiving least one dose"" directly reported CDC. possible we're comparing actual administered versus reported? send document via DM maybe figure delta. traveling another country one thing. going bar even flying domestically another. Also curious this. Still lingering symptoms initial NYC outbreak last year scheduled J&amp;J next Friday. also need remember bulk 15 million countries. reach point supply demand, supply flow countries Ever smoke weed? pretty vague, sign fuck TSA temporary. certain places wanting allow vaccinated people violation human rights. Holy shit idiots want badly feel oppressed think best part getting shot, mark calendar two weeks second shot. ""doom death"" every flu season? forever? virus going go away. data says 1000 people still dying every day. data says cases hospitalizations going up. say people won’t vaccinated end April, really means people won’t immunity end May. admit isn’t over, want open anyway. you’re bored. Jesus. stupid measure. Inside, absolutely get it, work. Outside? 🤨 Hahahahaha.  People moving countries basic human right now? Let burn passport walk Canada! better living around people like you. Hahaha. ridiculous lack self-awareness. Israeli data shows 94% reduction asymptomatic spread. combined masking, think it’s reasonable vaccinated individuals resume leisure travel long precautions maintained. documented evidence widespread vaccination fraud. Username checks out. Reddit, comment posted. venue ever tout unless want sued oblivion. It’s impossible guarantee that. 3 months low cases opening up. problem opening early, another wave came. likely due contagious variant. Since time began, could give kid flu, pneumonia, RSV, dozen things  especially risky compared COVID. expect never go near kid without full PPE again. Yeah much AMLO incompetence spring breakers That's 0.2% population per day.  need 5 X least. theory virus seasonal normally peaks late winter/early spring. seeing normal seasonal spike since immunity/vaccines last year severe time chime Texas, caveat I’m 1000% Abbott fanboy, things didn’t change much opening up. rural areas still continue ignore masks, throughout, businesses cities continue require masking. live Dallas, I’m still seeing total mask compliance everywhere go. That’s including many restaurants packed, they’ve packed since least last June. numbers statewide fairly steady decline 17 days since Governor dropped state mandates. I’m guessing everyone that’s already infected, number increasing vaccinations, businesses largest metro areas still requiring masks, lifting statewide orders didn’t real noticeable impact making supporters cream collective pants. matter kids vaccinated, they're ones attend Comic-Con. Michigan fully opened up, one still curfew virus going mutate comic con variant gives people super powers week half ago guide said closing prevent large group forming equinox. like TSA right? temporary? crisis control, worry? like patriot act? something make sure everyone safe human rights restored? people truly love doom gloom cant handle positivity guess. 72% 1st shot. Thats alot protection right there. Prevents death hospitalization high rates. yes, protected. pandemic, specifically measures taken response, lowered flu deaths. That's consequence pandemic. I’m teacher able get vaccine January I’m immune compromised. still colleagues waiting first dose driving 3-4 hours towns get them. district didn’t roll vaccines couple weeks ago we’ve back person since January. day appointments aren’t thing area. wait least week called successful registration. *The seditious traitor Ted Cancruz FTFY I'd pay less attention fully vaccinated number focus first dose. mRNA vaccines give worst protection (likely more) single dose JnJ call JnJ fully vaccinated bit apples-to-oranges worry two full mRNA doses. 

And metric, around 150M. We're 94M today, get least another 4-5M end March. means takes 1.7M first doses day get us 150M, 60% adult population. 

That said, unknown variable vaccine hesitancy states. could impact rate first doses even aggregate dose numbers per day continue rise. IQ high, thank much. much skipped two grades went special school gifted kids, tv ""genius"" throughout youth. intelligence especially relevant here. Anyone read publicly available data virus, see tiny risk majority people. don't, prefer listen sensational bullshit, that's misfortune, really care either way. 

What care tendency people like try impose fear-based perspective self righteous b.s. onto others. may recognize slippery slope restrictions going since last March, response virus. Mask mandates, big deal. Lockdowns prevent people working survive support families, drive millions people poverty large corporations reap profits? F that. mention mental health repercussions, people getting treated serious illnesses people decided Covid important thing world, negative effects kids' education! Restricting movement one country another basic human right? No. vaccine passports/digital IDs? People like seem stupid realize much government overreach things like are, especially something comparable flu anyone specific demographic. demographic protected vaccinated, rest society can't continue vilified punished cater few. Stop shaming people living fear like you. Considered user's reply. Headaches, fatigue, mostly. still get tired stuff like walking hill. Ive never felt like positive. Vaccinated people. bizarre lots us too. Lock downs meant protect vulnerable stop hospitals overwhelmed, fair enough. vaccinated hospitals near capacity. Yet still strict lockdown. Looking chart, could make far optimistic headline: “hospitalizations 50% Michigan VW surge” nonsense. COURSE mom vaxxed people gathering, gday interesting see retrospective analysis teases really drove COVID case growth decline. obviously multifactorial problem. Obviously behavior important aspect, clearly there's it. hear mRNA vaccines seem help long haul, hold true j j one also? also interesting note months ago someone said got mmr vaccine long haul symptoms went away. It’s like vaccine sets immune system straight again. odd US high risk people able least schedule one yet, get one? requiring masking another 1-2 months essential places enough? NIMBY - backyard ok people's

i wonder many covid deniers time hate China covid.... Seems bit early, Dr. Fauci said we're likely get back normal around Christmas. heard someone attended spring break one resorts Cancun massive testing fraud may occurring. lost sample results someone party, hotel simply opened results email Word edited name print documentation needed return home. Another staff member apparently alleged customer swabs simply discarded replaced “clean” swabs known-healthy employee sent testing.

In words, resorts vested interest actually finding cases COVID guest arrived, interest making good quarantine-in-paradise offer.

(I primary source allegation, certainly sounded plausible enough me.) What, like idea Chris Cuomo telling can't go? kind attitude could really hurt social credit score. Ah ok, chart must wrong, really matter. certainly lucky gotten hands extra doses. Well yeah, that’s point EU. hand, would feel comfortable Ireland rooting UK get priority, order get doses campaign finished. make perfect argument anti-vaxxer’s people fence taking shot get vaccinated.

I'm sure came conclusion statement. I'm getting vaccinated, one thing, simply stating that's green light go back life usual, least understanding (and posed response question, meant rhetorical). I'm suggesting wait LITTLE longer since already know jumping gun gone poorly past. case referring statement ""not caring"" vaccination readily available, good green light point; I'm going continue cautious account other's ignorance, care infecting somebody wants get vaccinated, chance. another poster said vaccinated people transmit easily, that's true, definitely contributes trying learn adapt new information. obviously permanent thing. Around 25% people vaccinated right gather safe way, means making sure they’re vaccinated wife tested positive Covid 2 weeks ago. able get us vaccine appointment next week. still get wait? Really want get don’t want find another appointment avoid it. like shot 💉💉💉💉 Make list non mask wearers blame deaths people. Actually theyd still feel guilt shame, need intellect that. I'm glad! worth getting triggered misunderstanding like Someone know thinks masks work doctors wear keep getting stuff face, so... Probably not. venue wants tout ""covid free"" experience requiring negative tests vaccines allowed to. 

However, would rather state handle data someone like ticketmaster. apps/""passports"" gonna needed “fruits vaccinated” shouldnt able enjoy life. benefits vaccine health 3 million per day average around corner! 

The light end tunnel gets brighter every day Chicago burb myself. guess need travel Champaign get dose huh Perhaps next declare HIV status travel? so? would mean 300k dead due COVID. USA 600k deaths average, almost 3x Mexico's population. That's sick government still poop situation that’s exactly it. can’t look numbers there’s always way present numbers look better actually are. example: like Philippines “”auto-heals”” mild asymptomatic cases every Sunday skews data look better actually used better statistical methods. they’re middle-income speak doesn’t discount fact still LOT poor people problem inequality society lot corruption. still makes poor compared already developed nations. Insta kids, use crap. understand anybody could value money life. people dictators sadist. even best vaccines estimated prevent Brazilian variant infection 63%. Shit. Changing ""rapid reopening"" ""people generally careless"" agree. director public health Mexico lmao think US done shitty job counting covid deaths. I'd anything reported. Sounds month, made sure wasn’t going town next month 3rd shot blood draws possible shot many strains covid counting calculation? chances mutating result kind lazy response? chances mutated strain re-infecting already cleared? don’t understand got conclusion want country, much less house lol. group notorious cognitive deficit.. EU exported anything. all. 

Companies production facilities EU exporting vaccines. 

Companies paid set facilities countries quickest way get vaccines arms people - factories already existed EU.

They thought, time, safe realise EU would start try steal vaccines.

How many times need said stop lying?

I took look account looks like know claiming Ireland subreddit UK diverting vaccines away Ireland. 

Which genuinely feel sorry you. desperate try turn nasty ""perfidious Albion"" nonsense spun several years UKpolitics. Unfortunately work anymore, we've seen EU we've seen UK is. Reality broken ability ever going back days.

You're failing badly getting deeper deeper lying now. Reinfection happen, especially newer deadlier variants. WA would gotten away it, wasn’t meddling kids. Oh, kids? Yay! country live something right. hate humanity ever well, that’s hating *people*. Don’t turn misanthrope you’re better people hate. plenty wonderful people could one too. worry, still chance. forget virtue signal shit insta ;) It’s easy blame younger people make easy, spring break perfect example, excuse, yolo, really doesn’t resonate majority population; 100% correct stating older population guilty, so. first foremost much vulnerable portion population, people associate throughout pandemic ones flaunting rules refusing “give way life cold”, words selfish. That’s say everyone 50 hasn’t making sacrifices pandemic, applies everyone 30; experience it’s 50 I’m likely see wearing mask, wearing mask incorrectly, socializing generally going lives; younger generation wearing masks, taking precautions time trying maintain semblance social life. wife got second Pfizer yesterday morning. Felt little tired woke chills middle night took Aleve went back bed, woke feeling mostly fine. Seemed pretty mild compared horror stories I’ve heard wouldn’t stress much. It’ll vary per person. Michigan, especially Southeast Michigan slow rolling vaccine. 75 year old mother able get shot yesterday actively sought one weeks, numerous places signed contacted her.

Eligibility opening mean availability. people pining limited doses available. got J&amp;J yesterday knocked well. Still recovering. Strangely fever registered, everything else: chills, body aches, bit nausea. worth vaccinated get this!  514, still ten times much summer 2020, soon follow. importantly 30 million spread randomly wants stop there. Uptake groups far ranged from
85% actually full 100% age brackets (like 75-79 think?)

Hopefully commitment getting vaccine continues 85% range gets younger groups. unavoidable fact work better everyone vaccinated. Theres absolutely point people bailing complaining year shouldn’t said no, either got “long covid” mutation grew area. think understand meant. think lot people read thought saying need restrictions since almost half it. implication another 400,000 would die. 

I see fact arguing restrictions.  Probably boomers able get vaccinated 65 Omg fox new types same... people stopped trusting fox news.  ones still reasons pandemic killed many people.  contradiction youre stupid understand thats whh watch fox news lol last couple weekends neighborhood indication, yes. Unless catch covid first. loosened restaurant restrictions state basically turned things big party 21-30ish crowd. emergence mRNA technology one hell silver lining pandemic. works. safe. relatively quick easy/cheap make. drawback juncture difficulty cold storage cold chain logistics, knows, maybe they'll find way around eventually future. obviously huge priority now. Granted, I'm expert know necessarily limiting factors makes impossible, hope.

mRNA technology nothing short godsend applaud who've played part development emergence. general rule, think big pharma scum earth, I'll give one hope make absolute killing helping end worst outbreak century. Ah see, Id assumed trials would separated booster type used 

Wow fourth shot? Didn’t know that. know kind time interval they’re using third fourth doses? would stop trying enforce stupid stuff like masks outside, overall compliance rules would better ... Reply able climb temple steps fat fucks fell died shut permanently. Would like invite us house party today then? Yeah might flatten even more. Bizarre UK hasn’t lifted restrictions yet. US advantage supplies ever increasing, UK hit month long slump soon. bullshit story.

I Chichan Itza two weeks ago.

#1 - everyone masked up. Everyone. almost 4 hours. single person mask less, chin mask, pulled bullshit. 

Mexicans taking COVID seriously. Way stringent US. handful times I've seen anyone chin masking, matter seconds someone shamed back compliance.

This article say Mexican government already scheduled close Chichan Itza (and every major Mayan archaeology site) back January every major holiday spring.

Spring Equinox last week? Everything closed. Americans. 

It's smart close sites major Mexican holidays prevent insane crowds. prevent domestic crowds. points blatantly obvious anyone think.

Except they're not. Tons people trouble assimilating information conflicts doom gloom narratives. pretty pedantic argue ""the less cases better"", paint call strict lockdowns 

No. fundamentally misrepresented criticisms constantly fretting case numbers, corrected on. pedantry want hear sub overrun people downvote even basic scientific facts goes idea basically , poster talking 

This really reeks projection, honest. recently, sub generally downvoting anything even suggesting *might not* die this. many seem unwilling accept evidence turn nearly bad said would. Given things trending positive direction, least US, they're ones ought grinding axe with, worried ""basic scientific facts."" Here's issue I'm maybe help this. quick tests, far know, sensitive enough consistently detect virus peak infection. However, PCR tests sensitive enough. I've read person become infectious two days onset. would mean could well test negative 2nd, 3rd 4th days quick test would react high enough viral presence. days could infect others. brand test looking at? looked Joysbio using colloidal gold immunoassay (all Greek me) Aesku using immunochromatographic. would like look CT results tests speaking of. Excellent news! We're moving fast now!! I'm 23 getting first jab tomorrow! Can't wait!

Pub, come! “I’m hopeful go back endless consumption patterns got us mess first place.” Yeah see using example headlines also doom gloom everyone! people vaccinated. course, wear masks, safe fly plane vacation. Yeah got dizzy 24 hours feeling lot better morning. Yesterday shit... really hope believe god don’t feel like hosting rave collapse humanity never went away. oh stfu. people want travel responsibly freedom without shamed cowards. said wore masks etc. want hide house forever welcome impose fears others. It’s 50/50 don’t tell you, also giving people 4th shot second jab booked 3rd June. get it, cross little while. might bite bottom lip bit. 'hundreds' maskless assholes It’s selfish dangerous, it’s plain worth it. really same, work salon + spa, I’m AMAZED many people go little spa day middle freaking pandemic. 

Like haircut understand, it’s kind hilarious looking people masked robes separated plexiglass staff runs around sanitizer wait massage. Like idea relaxing time? worth money? certainly isn’t book, whatever. 

Why wait things get better actually enjoy yourself? know sucks able anything weird half-life isn’t lot better imho. call ""selling past close"" seems wearing mask. Handed door perhaps? N95? so, thats encouraging. virus spread would blocked masks.  better countries work diplomatically accomplish peace, longer win

Nah that's works. War moved front lines tech, espionage, trade, money, etc.

If young don’t let stop investing Think weird doesn’t bother you... love seeing smiles even sad faces emotions. life! need back. course get this. face identifies happiness sadness way. truly sad us care this. oh come on, thats 19 families mourning loved one. although massive decrease, still sad Double maskers stay home vaxers downvoting you. types** using high school math try downplay pandemic entire time, gets old.

Got it. we've 'othered' person perceive challenging severity coronavirus. that's they've downvoted hell back.

I guess see way. looks like they've put good faith effort share real information, there's nuance help adding nuance comments - tearing down. ask qualifiers spewing absolute dogshit rhetoric. sub full people sort controversial, downvote anything -1, never stop consider nuance. Ralph Wiggum style “helping” actual beef lack life fulfillment, confusion regarding concurrent events, social media addiction. I’m impressed made negative triple figures. 

I got voted local sub simply stating can’t quit job, commit employment insurance fraud. Ocean downvotes people likely don’t realize scamming employment insurance, you’re making things much worse people authenticity need it. Untreated hunger he’s referring to. couple months? state? NC opening everyone soon, meantime seems like everyone get shot want it. may take hours searching various providers clinics point know healthy teenagers getting shots. point vaccine rollout, every single shot every single arm major net positive point, exceptions. can’t afford let demand slack even little right now, shouldn’t feel guilty whatsoever scheduling vaccination appointment she’s able so. You’re forgetting natural immunity addition vaccination rate. doctors say 90 days get body might respond poorly. you’re past December. India rescuing world virus pretty much.

I hope Reddit leave pandemic less racist towards India Indians. long enough since infection. receive vaccine available you. fair. Mexicans economically ok. 

It’s countries like El Salvador Venezuela people come No. People lonely. bad anything resembling stringent lockdown. Countries actually stringent lockdowns, Australia New Zealand, saw lower all-cause mortality usual, since lockdowns save lives. definitely read eulogies first clotting issues people close relation AZ vaccine rare there’s nothing indicate AZ cause timing two things. 

Second, you’re getting Pfizer AZ

Third even something like ITP linked vaccines, number reported cases low you’re probably likely die Covid getting vaccine fatal side effect (of there’s evidence vaccine cause). Yes Allowing another wave, guess many variants around fail get vaccinated vaccine boosters much greater risk. Also, worry hospitals may bill people unreasonable amounts may cost arm leg. anyone else think plateau/small uptick cases result rapid reopening rather variants? I'm complaining, watching city come back life beautiful brings tear eye, I've seen people going around without mask past month I've seen past year (once again, I'm complaining), considering also warm enough yet outside often, could factor uptick? Decreased scale definitely. Decreased length, no. ignorant laugh Looking US vs UK vaccination strategy quite interesting. wonder one better strategy, end, I'm guessing UK since info came first doses vast majority work immunity, see.

I presumably covid back December around Christmas (Mom tested positive car, symptom onset, several hours congestion loss taste dad sister showed different symptoms well) state opening vaccines 16+ 3/31.

Is period shouldn’t get vaccine post-infection? mean jealous fantastic vaccine news constantly coming UK EU fails miserably There's long term side effects known covid

Take pick: Diabetes population deadly, yes. % people vaccinated covid19 less likely spread disease lower R value virus. Depite this, cases still going up, vaccinated people, would likely going faster. Yes. Yes, are. heart hurts. Mexico's official death toll COVID around 200k. Could due unreported deaths something else play? (i.e. cartel violence, economic impact lockdowns killing people.) crazy, Mexico February road tripped Mexico City Ciudad Juarez (on border) back Hidalgo. impressed amount masking kind shocking toddler even allowed go stores. even went highway check points specifically looking masks!


We touristy areas, contact like 3 Americans. happily wearing masks. saddens hear invading touristy areas maskless millions. crazy, Mexico February road tripped Mexico City Ciudad Juarez (on border) back Hidalgo. impressed amount masking kind shocking toddler even allowed go stores. even went highway check points specifically looking masks!


We touristy areas, contact like 3 Americans. happily wearing masks. saddens hear invading touristy areas maskless millions. trying without much success. tried call local CVS Walgreens phone system bounces around eventually 800 number local store. wife got vaccinated asked ""extra"" shots person said waiting list extra doses exceeded list regular appointments check back weeks.

I heard people get shots maybe depends area element luck. Many local pharmacies left doses - either due cancellations / shows open appointments.  One pharmacy chain scheduling 60 doses day always get fully booked. 

I friends stop early afternoon check unused doses.  It’s hit miss successful times not. One pharmacy took name number said would call unused doses. pharmacy called next day. 

IMO, state needs open appointments doses get used. debunked. doses always meant EU+Covax.

UK get smaller amount AZ doses expected coming weeks due less doses India Netherlands. debunked. doses always meant EU+Covax 

UK get smaller AZ doses expected coming weeks due less doses India Netherlands. Hey, wouldn’t worry much. Essentially, found acceptable level benzene, much all. I’m chemistry research handle carcinogenic stuff time including benzene *ideal* risk pretty negligible using hand sanitizer (and drinking hope😂) think KN95s recommend wirecutter pretty good. worried problem EU right powers act now. Health completely national competence. Trade really exclusively that's handled vaccine procurement. trade deal, would've great obviously wasn't.

There seem movement least people realising inevitable needs gain competences areas like this. problem that’s rule. fair, missed post responding to. Yeah know 3 week gap exists, mean i’ve seen reports NHS aren’t allowed give 2nd doses 11 weeks Wales seems giving lot last month knows. love everyone trying come reasons fine. people, concerts &amp; going bars highlights week. sad really whole heartedly don’t understand anything pandemic.

Take second think bit, look actual flu test data, look mitigation, learn bit. They’re getting spreading people low risk. cares? Covid less deadly flu you’re 35. people die drowning (4,000) 35s US die covid last year (only roughly 3,000) really wonder numbers would look like vaccinated 18-55 age range priority nursing homes. older folks know FL ability stay home, get groceries delivered, family drop things off. Instead, first vaccinated non-working class people everyday jobs, make working class people like teachers wait retired-age people chance.

I understand percentages hospitalizations death, wonder fighting fire spreading opposed places isolated fire would effective approach limit spread. Leftwing civic nationalism ftw. dad turned 83 yesterday grandkids brought great grandkids little early outdoor Easter egg hunt. mom beside joy. Surfaces don’t really need disinfected, it’s really transmitted via fomites.

Not jamming hundreds corner store, yes it’s higher risk super market, wasn’t comparison making it? 

Haircut shave plus waiting get seated, yeah that’s 20-30 minutes easy. Life expectancy India 69 years. Far fewer 80 90+ age people who've beem majority covid deaths globally. US life expectancy 79 years. yes diseases comorbidities US like Obesity far higher. China definitely cases definitely controlled virus love rural Ohio, last Monday unfilled appointments could scheduled 16 older.

My wife got shots way. 

It local pharmacy giving choice J&amp;J Moderna, opted Moderna going rolling restrictions even three successful vaccines variants, isn’t worth it. can’t return normal life without masks, reduced capacities, government restrictions another vaccine won’t help. gladly got first. get another. Life needs get back normal humans social creatures, continuing kill people saves. Makes sense since officially fattest world. Muslim men wear hijab

Hijab cover face

Christians want make everyone Christian

All points anti-Muslim propaganda you’re yet eligible means you’re low risk. 

That might true state, everywhere. Eligibility rules vary state. Last read estimated IFR around 0.3%, that’s 3x 0.1% example still jealousy UK stealing vaccines? RemindMe! 1 week Science gets credit creating vaccine, like not.


The government's role distribution. Biden's administration surpassed Trump front every way. could happened? /s Yeah, they're using Chinese vaccine, knows effective China refused release data Phase III trials, they've published efficacy expect people take trust.

Israel using Pfizer definitely worked cases deaths plummetted. believe they’re allowed give 2nd doses earlier 11 weeks. hope massive catch 2nd doses maintain good daily rate.

The Pfizer Moderna guidance lot shorter interval three months. Israel stuck 21-28 day gap.

The problem UK reliant diverting EU AstraZeneca jabs stopped EU raided factories AstraZeneca failed deliver contract. stupid. I'm EU consider Brexit stupid mistake. said, British right stupid (or smart, depends see it)!

If Brits want donate vaccines Irish, that's great, thanks UK! vaccine given win us all. Sure, might ""bribe"", improve relation Ireland, even show EU. still care positive development! don’t say don’t see supply Maryland hope find use mine soon. far seems like it’s MSG. like field. sometimes tend conflate ability perform job-related tasks full understanding discipline moral intricacies. Confirmation bias, anecdotes, Dunning-Kruger effect rest. house Idon't mind people going there. objection unmasked crowds. speculation may way injections administered, would explain clustering cases. absurd touch. key opening schools vaccinating teachers opening certain, headwinds Isn’t country notoriously unequal economically? Make look problems. Lol too. part crowd lol stfu ""All countries really need work together."" This, 100%. may borders, extends beyond borders impacts every one us. One reasons think serious intervention needs happen ASAP Brazil... That's people feel normalcy yet. numbers come people start changing behavior regardless messages government may tell even really good. watch see. Chile 50% cases rising new lockdowns announced It’s easy find racist days happened specifically AstraZeneca know longer divert supplied contracted EU higher bidders like UK. apart places successfully used bring cases control, instances zero, course. People like poster seem think black white. feel sorry them. due respect, think way, way, way optimistic mask use.

States view masks negative barely hit point eliminating mandates - use still widespread. even close eliminating use places see use positive. kids high school really feel peers friends. entire year socializing, sports, classes, etc. completely lost they'll never get back. mixed feelings high school skipping entire year major loss. Especially kids whose lives revolved around sports. going major mental health issues contend next years. event overwhelmingly outdoors would assume includes kind mask mandate. whole ""just wait two weeks"" thing fetishize outbreaks got tiring long time ago. Yes know tons people gotten like this!

My work block health department essential workers group. 78 people work building full time got close able leave quickly. Every afternoon 3:30, they'd call say ""the next # people come 4:15"". 

Some extra doses others people skipped appointment cancel postpone number reasons. It’s hard wear mask—you’re absolutely right. still don’t like miss seeing faces. makes human full emotions, baby. can’t wait longer wear them. good point. notice subtle name changed- pfizer-biontech that's commonly used ""biontech"" describing vaccine greater china cares cases everyone high risk vaccinated? south africa variant large presence Israel too, doesn’t seem impacting much. quite true. Hungary example using Russian vaccines. took 2 days Moderna vaccine designed 42 days first samples released testing genetic code released.

That's insane... wonder quickly takes normal vaccines. Portugal closed shops, bars/restaurants, schools, mandatory teleworking, curfews evenings/weekends (but everyone goes park anyway 'exercise'). Masks always rigidly adhered to.

We went Europe's worst region, one best within matter weeks. Vaccination weeks later approaching 10%. document (for doctors) shows checked treat happens way reported maddening me. seen little efficacy days 0-12, 14 becomes 90%. often reported ""50%"" average first 25 days.

But like saying team started game 0 points, finished game 24 points, scored average 12 points. Nobody cares score halftime, care final score. Here’s study seems show effectiveness high. Israel's latest data, yet peer reviewed, collected two weeks administration second vaccine dose, reinforcing idea doses needed achieve full efficacy report. receive vaccine 44 times likely develop symptomatic disease, 29 times likely die Pfizer vaccine far 94% effective preventing type infection, Israel's Ministry Health reports -- encouraging news vaccine could help slow silent transmission. absolutely know year lockdown hurt kid's social development.

And know odds coronavirus hurting low.

All choices life balance risks. People go path perceive less risky.

In case I'm going side experts like American Academy Pediatrics. don’t even like cruises friend invited family I, said HELL YES! I’m vaccinated ready....LETS GO! already (which created landscape Trump pandemic) repeating 30’s... know comes next. 

It’d really great journalists world leaders weren’t 10+ years behind. means *sharing* locally manufactured vaccines countries ...?

That’s *big* win Brexit ? Yep too. Admittedly CA getting millions done every day.  

Most states open everyone weeks. NC another week everyone available rural counties already opened everyone due ton supply new sites opening up. guess vaccines becoming widely available weather warming up, going see spikes cases spikes hospitalizations fatalities, risk vaccinated. Cases without illnesses bother all. nah shit crash pandemic, that's Fed inject massive amounts liquidity starting September 2019   Maybe it’s best people stay away kids? Yes, makes even worse. Schools can’t even afford pay teachers properly, don’t start there, first? Probably job. December still Easter, least calendar.... analogies show trouble understanding vaccine also intended protect others. want live cabin interact others, wish. Better 90-100% death rate, pneumonic septicemic plague are. mean much regarding time-scale. UK delays AZ give priority citizen. Let’s see, Irish resident hope fastest think New York City somewhat different position pretty much anywhere else country going need keep level mitigation longer. think hope masks anything else seems reasonable. fact could case even NYC mask mandates masking stops earlier think. see major harm mandating masks people vaccinated Broadway. think ultimately going vaccine system rather masks.

what mean?? official data provided government Lol. link says Easter assume deliveries start soon. convincing anybody telling they're vaccinated still stay home, still wear mask, still socially distance.

That’s they’re told. opposite. biz traveler booking last-minute coach seat flight $650 subsidizing $300 coach seat booked two months ahead time. Fares may cheap near term entice people fill planes again, biz travel softens long term leisure travel prices go up. Nah it’s mostly guys domestic vaccine production don’t. It’s understandable you’d want get country first sharing saying it’s ok

British Medical Journal reported Pfizer's first dose 52% protective two weeks, see real world data, hand, found almost protection 2 weeks, around 90% protection 3 weeks. ""After initial injection case numbers increased day 8 declining low levels day 21. **Estimated vaccine effectiveness pretty much 0 day 14 rose 90% day 21 levelling off**. cause initial surge infection risk unknown may related people less cautious maintaining protective behaviours soon injection."" likely explanation gap: trial volunteers told, behaved exactly get vaccine, saw steady rise protection. real life vaccine recipients dropped precautions soon, saw increase infections day 0 - 8, day 8-14 vaccine risky behaviors cancelled (resulting zero effect), 21 days vaccine totally won. handed EU, Ireland would see tiny proportion them.

How help keep UK/Ireland border open? astounds we’re year this, people sub therefore decently read issues, still can’t grasp exponential growth.

On hand, I’m increasingly suspecting ability intuitively grasp concepts around exponential growth pretty good shorthand intelligence test. guess makes sense threats coming EU.

The crunch AZ supply delays deliveries India. happens front them.. need check math Strange? Fuck. Diseases spread people around struggle spread majority population take steps like quarantining, wearing masks, staying 6 feet apart. mention many restrictions public spaces placed across globe whole year. 

It's like Flu's worse case scenario spreading. would like Wile E Coyote going grab road runner suddenly Road Runner riding car now, spread oil behind road gun. 

The whole point taking extreme measures help easily spread disease absolutely crush flue. However Flu likely come back years, go back normal. Probably take little get back 2019 levels.

It's story. one wants cut social group. But, still feel coordinated effort limit social contact would bring manageable levels, limit spread new variants. many examples countries successful this. Australia chosen continent.

There’s mechanism happen.

Late occurring side effects happen due damage noticeable/measurable time (radiation etc) long term use (where damage that’s small detect adds time).  Neither apply covid vaccine.

The possibility side effects occur quickly (within couple months) rare meds takes years see statistical link.  doesn’t apply covid vaccines either, many people them.

The UK obviously vaccines ""spare"" under-50s yet vaccinated, helping Ireland drive cases vaccinate elderly (and indirectly helping rest EU drive cases down) useful overall UK paranoid bubble, nervously looking fence waiting next variant... facing reality. natures way slimming herd down. much stupidity selfishness moment Take whatever way like, mind, judge xD. 

We flu vaccination almost 100 years. work eradicate it, recently disappeared. Fair enough, stranger things happened, put question purpose flu vaccination? Even little?

And saying patogen exponentially infectious controlled using method failed control less contagious patogen almost 100 years? going done span many months years?

Doesn't rises eyebrows little? proves vaccines work 1 dose strategy working UK. Hopefully world sees 1 dose important supply constrained environment. Yep. need look many countries EU went way regards vaccine procurement outside bloc. None (well, now, mayhem started)

Brexit 100% helped Britain get top vaccinations. got weird way interpreting comments don’t think refund money cover oncologists. 

I hope hell real place people cashed selling dangerous products. attitude US lot worse. writing 50 page research paper would gladly provide extensive works cited page nice little sources. way could go them, find one may even little questionable could pretend like everything I'd written false paper lambasted across internet.

That way never hear differing opinion ever again! nice, safe echo chamber. Anti-maslers bad ruining ruins. doubt good stats it. healthcare “system” majority Brazil. Flu symptoms get blamed dengue many northern regions due lack resources training. Many regions going back lockdown airports shutdown like first wave last year. stuck northern Brazil waiting airport reopen 3 months. Let’s hope Bolsonaro gets replaced someone recognize facts real takes steps toward improving situation.  First: Im sad hear hope overcome anxiety depression soon. wish best.

But every person different point, wouldnt really care get sick. dont want anyone else get sick, dont care anymore. last months hard want job money again. Im living grandparents costs cant anything right now, dont lot savings Luxembourg expensive country housing Europe.
Our governement completely failed, 30% unemployment among young people disaster dont think situation improve near future. Australia example favourable conditions regarding covid.

1. island. Much easily controlled borders.
2. Rich. countries can't keep borders closed. Can't handle economically.
3. Got lucky many regards covid never heavily seeded.

My point WAIT. Vaccines outbreak oriented right scarce. remember stuff thing shelf Target months. 

Maybe ok.. touch carcinogens time. Could kind thing that’s super bad used years, like dyes sodas. See post 3 weeks ago. .... Wow. money made outweighs loss life Florida experience? Fuck, guess abolished slavery, since money made outweighs value human life. /s

Man, flew biggest ""I jerk"" flag statement, still think people should/will take seriously. Incredible. Spare. I’ve mine yet /s spare vaccines unless Europe releases UK's Astrazeneca supply Belgium. UK looks supply constrained next month two.

One action UK could take half dose full dose strategy AZ. shown studies least effective full dose full dose 55. Follow money frustrating part whole thing. compliance was/is low, live it. can't bothered bothered anymore. Rock up! daughter too. think life would better immediately lift limited social contacts? Yes. think future would better crush this? Absolutely. convinced people see immediately front them. Apparently we’re shut-ins wanting cases continue go vaccines aren’t wasted people getting infected 1 week dose.

That's total misrepresentation people saying. people labeled shut-ins, usually suggesting insane shit like ""no bars restaurants open every single case COVID eradicated,"" that's looney toons talk totally divorced reality.

Hospitalizations deaths really matter here. Cases equal hospitalizations, particularly cases among younger people. r/confidentlyincorrect good bitcoin.  would say tagline 2020-2021 years cone be:

""Never get truth way good story"".

I great hopes ""pandemic"" turn massive disappointment. Ugh, grumbling cock. wrong, dude. never bought off-brand hand sanitizers afraid wouldn’t alcohol ratio CDC said needed effectiveness. never occurred many people would put poison one sort another bottles. That’s deeply shitty. 

I think I’ll always keep lease one big bottle name brand sanitizer around rest life. 

Ever meet old people survived Great Depression? We’re going interesting habits... maybe need widespread distribution poorer areas? sub gone ""stay safe home"" ""I need over"" millisecond, goaded along anti-public-health-guidance groups like LockdownSkeptics, etc. 

I idea changed. months ago, downvoted oblivion even slightly complaining wear mask. people get bagged repeating basically verbatim guidance CDC post-vaccine protocols. 

It's probably natural result people's tiny attention span low frustration threshold general lack patience empathy. People afraid pandemic actually changed society many accounts, has. 

People hate change. want go back Applebee's. want go store nothing need want ""browse"". want go back office people standing around water-cooler telling stories one truly listening making ""active listening"" faces even though even know even talking. 

They miss ""the old world"". sad.  ""Curfew restrictions 8 p.m. two weeks would work — we've seen France, Britain Portugal.""
Hello friends France, Britain, Portugal. right? I’ll take no, didn’t look thing figure something half infectious could lead rapidly fewer cases.

Covid might end endemic. Solid enough vaccination might reduce low levels, maybe even wipe got serious. doubt I’ll happen, probably could compulsory vaccination. submission linking vice.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Healthcare system, least Ireland, failed many years ago. People dying long time became ""popular"". amount ""additional"" case load would cause system collapse already run.

Doubt fear, say non-stop around clock broadcasting case positive case test results (without talking account false positives giving idea many cases actually required hospitalisation) would job spreading fear introducing draconian measures.

We talk compassion, talk number people suffer lack adequate access health care. talk long term effects prolonged shutdown economy, levels unemployment, social impact, shift economical structure.

I'm compassionate next person, draw line? say interest takes precedent wellbeing majority? example proven, high impact unhelty lifestyle, healthy, look myself, eat healthy regularly exercise, I'd cost horrendous amounts money, lifestyle. Yet, need pay premium life health insurance people choose lead unhealthy lifestyles. compassionate towards person consciously making choice put risk? u/bschug relevant quote, recommend reading whole chapter get much better sense supposed behave sick.

Biden down, US government really great job virus post January 2021. second point valid, first? vaccine ever going 100% effective, virus going become endemic. never going go back way life before? given death hospitalization rate 16 really one top problems today, right? live wealthy nation We'll see, wont we? God, hope freaking Floridian variant doesn’t made people chose careless. Israel updated numbers since early Feb report. think theyre seeing bit higher agree - one water wet things. give normal people trust science stop wasting resources chasing anti-vaxxers? think they’re pouring country unrestricted, virus all. varying two variables attribute changes one them. seems like obvious self-flattering LOL meant make feel good yourself. ""wealthy nation"" chance? mean would fine things staying forever honest. seen indication people voted politicians vaccine hesitant now? Enough. lockdowns prolong shit obvious. Thank information. Holy Hellfire man need relax! Please tell may sigh little bit well!!!! wishing Covid infect people thus kill people deadly virus would. six thousand haven’t seen studies showing voters left vaccine hesitant. source that? know india totally different way counting, using comments makes irrelevant nobody outside India idea talking about, 5.94 crore. almost 6 thousand, yes believe is.  Good thing dont young people USA....oh wait.... kn95 fits good. hate ""absolutely measures whatsoever."" Yes people getting vaccinated, keep basic things like masks public transport, capacity limits, etc time we're fully it? Seriously. obvious, human thing India justifiably garner good PR it. well done India. live densely populated city, makes sense. Ebola 20 happened. nothing. See “new” part misleading, especially deaths days state reports deaths, sometimes say “we reported 20 deaths today. 15 august 18th January 21st. 5 March 13 26”. That’s exactly “new” especially ones August people still active either ""return normal instantly"" ""lockdown till 2022."" middle ground stopped paying much attention.

People unreasonable. last year taught us proceed caution? Yes go socialise meet vaccinated friends, hold massive parties yet stop wearing masks social distancing public since people can't tell vaccinated walking around. Sad 😢 He's right. Covid hit sweet spot able kill people deadly virus could *and* sweet spot many people possible willing enable seemingly low risk. think you’re underestimating northern Ireland population. 

Adjusted population Northern 56 cases per 100,000 people Ireland 160 per 100,000. What??? be?? /s 

Seriously. makes sick stomach watching unfold. Almost 30 million people recorded dose vaccine UK. majority AZ. 

I’d like know numbers blood clot would imagine they’re negligible. last twelve months I'd agreed cursing maskless idiots spreading disease... ability travel internationally without much worry feel pretty good u.s. regard pandemic. ain't till over. We're still far predicted last year actual scientists. practical though. People jobs move to, family take care of, etc.

A lot people vote Bolsonaro. It’s competition. Stop. EU supply production ramping next months well, hopefully getting soon enough! Wishing good luck. Could J&amp;J play role? Wtf, I'm fan lockdown all, stuff like this? want able travel see family, care less missing concerts another year. Water appears wet, data suggests  April 1st April 30th example? Theres quite difference. 

If true 500k late April, can’t see making huge difference thats fair enough, UK didn’t put much Moderna order maybe could it’s hard know vaccines going producing delivering now. possible visit outside masks on? ""And see them, we'll still say phrases used last time"" Lol. rule inside show strict use high-quality face masks provided concert organizers. Nah UK would bullied joining EU procurement plan subsiding EU member states. Anti-maskers got well deserved lesson!! blocked moving on. unwilling learn anything mistakes. hopefully seek get help need Hope stay safe man 🙏 sounds horrible Really? direct, normal flights cancelled option expensive transfers.

I'm going work pay, connecting flights different test requirements crazy. happily give New Zealand credit they’ve earned measures. need compare Ireland completely different every way. It’s silly. Here's American MSM saying thing, shady Iranian bullshit Likely places subreddit. Privileged white people don’t understand black people already made black people enemies minds black people’s vaccine hesitance.

Luckily one got sick, continued post bullshit Facebook. someone comes hospital super sick, tests negative covid (Hospitals use PCR tests, extremely accurate), positive flu test ruling causes, almost definitely sort influenza virus. 

Since pandemic started, flu hospitalization rates super low, precautions reasonably successful covid (social distancing, masks, reducing social “surface area” cancelling large events, etc) extremely effective less virulent viruses like flu. I’m this. wife fully vaccinated two younger kids focus shifts mental health.

But actually commenting number first doses nearly 100k vs last Sunday. Thank you. 	TOTAL REPORTED	ON MARCH 27	14-DAY CHANGE
Cases	723,324	5,026
+134%
Deaths	17,038	23
+26%
Hospitalized	1,924
+101% way trump steady 35% 43% country support whatever does/did.  Nothing trump bad, even affected negatively. Balso same.


Its wave far right semi totalitarian governments installed. Social media helped  far right gain lot power 60,000 cases 780 deaths yesterday. See beach.

“20,000 week”. OK, we’re moving goalposts within single post. We’ll got 20K someone say 1000 way many. Okay, people mind business live let live.

Does make guy replied anti-asian racist? No.

All Britain Europe think lost US still mask mandates, maybe he's south? point excess deaths calculations.

120 people die covid

minus

20 people would've died flu end living

100 excess deaths covid responsible for

Sure, know exact number people died actual covid infection. net effect matters. true parts country. predict happen? No, that’s works. one, example nose lung, it’s highly unlikely hit one other. happy respond. end goal see 1 COVID patient month. Urgent Care see 50 less patients day. see every person wants shot get one. finally, wear mask day, fear life, lives others. never big partier, let's say waste time things dreamt doing. years wanted visit Thailand, never slew reasons: travel buddy accompany me, lack funds, grad school, finally position to, COVID happened. That's example, point is, want something, hesitate less life short want live regret questions ""what if."" Number first doses gonna 50% overall, apparently aware that. It’s fake propaganda article. average age cases getting lower around world seniors get bulk vaccines. 7 day average up, today's number vs last Sunday thing yesterday's number. right 64 year olds preexisting conditions. last line coming quick!  one fully fascinated weeks, know what's holding everyone else up. believe fascination supply shortage?

Did device change ""vaccinated"" ""fascinated"" ? Maybe fascinated though. someone British, always impression science-related programs always well respected. know can't get vaccine covid last 90 days. I'm sure that's everywhere though. percentage matters, that's way look trends. 

Absolute nonsense. percentages raw data numbers helpful without context % increase.

And proven statement ""plateau"" wrong refuse admit stubborn case confirmation bias.

You not. Going 18 23 average deaths 2 weeks described plateau state average gone fret, common problem amongst understand interpret data.

Which seem lag 3+ weeks, factual. counter real data, remains factual.

In non-vaccinated population, indeed. case noticed, Michigan vaccinated 20% population including elderly population.

I can't believe someone willingly ignoring additional factor important vaccination pretends giving advice data analysis. entitled Americans can't follow simple masks laws another country, deserve allowed there. he’s basically Brazilian trump. lot people buy stories love him. think important note GDP unemployment support may indicators overall growth, quality life wages comparison costs living probably relevant indicators. would surprised bunch laid folks (particularly arts/culture) forced work ""lower-skill"" jobs immediate future got laid off, field competitive, and/or need something right help pay bills. Positions within organizations materialize nowhere, plus federal government dropping ball providing relief certain sectors. Also, wages generally stagnant/declining value, imagine notable proportion population struggle make big changes (e.g. move new state suburbs affordable housing) least years.

Not saying everyone's gonna bad (plenty executives weather storm done already), I'm sure homelessness/poverty going get much worse peak pandemic. However, underemployment inequality currently continue huge problems. Walmart carrying J&amp;J vaccine Wisconsin. New appointments released midnight every day. Everyone know works care homes tell different story, realise that's anecdotal. No-one testing carehome deaths December 2019 Covid. One care home (not nursing) unexpected deaths otherwise unhealthy people December 2019 normal 12 month cycle, again, people tested Covid. chalked seasonal deaths.

I know that's large data pool work so, believe years evidence numbers appraised different picture now. Decrease exactly? 1st dose 7 day 1.75M/day, 1.5M/day last week. Low impossible. you’re vaccinated exhibiting symptoms, get checked out, per CDC. Oh yeah, good idea. Mexico cripple economy even keeping vaccinated U.S. tourist dollars. We’re clearly dealing member brain trust here. Deaths 3 week lag.  new wave started past 3 weeks. 19 people died Covid. didn’t necessarily die Covid. shame live civilized states. No, geriatric patients gotten vaccine. Many homebound, non-computer/cellphone savvy still waiting FL.  point still stand......why would trust numbers come out? Thank you! lock cases! flatten hospitalization curves. let people pretend wasn't. make really important point. deaths people dying within 28 days testing positive Covid. deaths may entirely unrelated Covid. mask mandates end automatically make someone anti-asian racist.

Most south ended mask mandates redditors still chimping people wearing masks anyway. sure hope so, I'm teenager that's never experienced damn thing life. Oh shit! year! That's right! US vs UK vaccination strategy quite interesting. wonder one better strategy

They vastly different positions too. uk produced vaccines last year, made setting uk part every contract could. Even now, one/two factories working. end year though 4 exporting. usa scaled had. done spirit Christian charity, I’m sure. traffic deaths actually US 2020 That's big fucking reach friend.

Wanting mask mandates end automatically make someone anti-asian racist. majority young kids elementary school back class, least hybrid part week. sports teams resumed practicing/competition age levels. Theoretically 10th gr seniors back class soon states allow vaccination 16 17 year olds, since CDC approved 16+. US export vaccine currently EU sub clueless americans idea bad things around world. LA came close running oxygen earlier year. Meanwhile Phillipines people run oxygen hospitals hoarding little left critical patients. percentage matters, that's way look trends.  Raw numbers helpful without context % increase.  I've proven statement ""plateau"" wrong refuse admit stubborn case confirmation bias. fret, common problem amongst understand interpret data.

I made false assumption lag?  Deaths lag 3+ weeks, factual.  counter real data, remains factual.

Good luck! testing site attending pharmacy? call pharmacist ask. pharmacy vaccination site used questions sickness covid positive tests last 14 days live kid vaccinated, chances may pass virus them? Huh? always find strange people think recovery thing bubble. shows complete misunderstanding market dynamics long term basis. Let rewind bit. 1994, market balance. Starting Jan 1995, dot com boom began started massive bubble. late 2000, began correct. became correction July 2002, quickly rebounded brought market back balance Jan 2004. market made stable gains Oct 2007, subprime mortgage crisis reared ugly head. noted actual crash, market bubble time. market bottomed March 2009 actually never fully recovered. partial recovery, Covid hit pushed yet again. Nov 2020, market returned without Covid, recovery 2008 crisis still far complete. fully recovered, SP500 hit 5,850 month. We’re 4,000 currently.

Barring another global crisis, see bull market seen believed. People say “but can’t that! It’s already gained much since March 2020!” again...those people lack long term market perspective. funnier would willing bet market fully recovers, people claim must crash surely like 1920s run Great Depression. Again...they lack perspective. 20s biggest market bubble ever existed. Seriously...look chart. It’s staggering. currently recovery. It’s going long forgot was. Proper Ding Dong Doo Highly deceptive comment. “Highly effective” stretch.

“The COVID-19 vaccines currently available offer protection variants,” said Dr. Wilma Wooten, San Diego County health officer, statement announcing P.1 cases there. “People continue taking preventive measures work variants novel coronavirus.” based take too, restrictions seems like it'll never happen June I'll overjoyed. Like totally. lot people going travel back home spread there. Travel increases chance spreading getting COVID-19. CDC recommends travel Although COVID-19 vaccines effective keeping getting sick, scientists still learning well vaccines prevent spreading virus causes COVID-19 others, even symptoms. still learning effective vaccines new variants virus causes Also, CO2 levels enclosed spaces actually get point mental function impaired. foggy-headed feeling sometimes end lecture? Sure, tired, dozens people breathing poorly ventilated space CO2 1000ppm more. Yes, definitely evidence long term issues small subset cases - probably mix auto-immune actual disease damage (e.g., taste/smell receptors). 

That said, theoretical reason believe resurgent virus scenario called out. It’s scare mongering point. makes frustrated newspapers. I've always managed cope mine lungs getting worse I've never hospitalised I'm SOOL. Would rather shutdown job? New York announced phase 2 starting vaccinations rolled vaccine passports. appointment vaxxed next week, use I'll actively avoid anything requires it. 

I'm getting vaccinated decrease risk severe covid. I'm go reduced capacity events still mask social distance prove I've vaccinated NYS past _90 days_ negative test. Lockdowns supposed flattening curve. hospitalisations levels last summer. justification lockdowns numbers. fingers crossed date June across pond New York started using think. knowledge format regarding medical exemptions? people certain health issues told get current vaccines. ""Now time think issues, Lurie said. swine flu pandemic, tens millions unused U.S. influenza vaccines held warehouses months, awaiting shipment overseas, cumbersome rules imposed U.S., World Health Organization overseas governments.

“There 68 steps one knew about,” Lurie recalled. “My favorite fumigation certificate required wood pallet exporting doses Philippines.”

Merck faced similar problems tried ship Ebola vaccine West Africa 2014-16 epidemic there. Commercial trade rules, Food Drug Administration regulations red tape make shipping unlicensed vaccine country complex, said Feinberg, senior Merck scientist. “It took lot jumping hoops even send vaccine Guinea Liberia Sierra Leone.”

Again, reading article extremely beneficial. talks actual issues faced ""donating"" vaccines urges plans remediate earlier. actually considering making reply comment, haha. still remarkably January peak 200+ per day 7 day average 120. Heck 7 day average still 50 percent February.

If seeing right, 25 percent increase talking 7 day average 16 deaths March 14 today 20. Something keep eye next weeks yes, reason raise alarm declare jump 150% whatever along cases 

Something keep eye on? Yes, rea Remember surge south summer last year? temperature seem matter.  question? want get back socially acceptable beat asian people masks There’s reason think happen Michigan. I’m worried. drinking alone year. It’s like prepping marathon. body ready I'm teacher UK, kids teachers required wear masks inside.

I really hate wearing mask ideal 1000x better teaching online. difference makes mental health see everyone incredible, even wearing masks indoors.

I'm definitely camp masks got go vaccines fully rolled out, moment gives us normality short term well worth it. moderate-severe asthmatics.have thrown bus comes vaccine. quiet meet jcvi guidelines I'd 3 lots steroids 3 months a+e visits never admitted. doctor used clinical judgment flag group 6 another a+e visit nebs steroids. definition severe asthma. marginally, keep using percentage instead raw data know would prove point wrong. 

You have. made false assumption lag thankfully corrected, withheld raw data scare people fake trend. LMFAOOOOO symptoms based virus's point entry body? example, get virus nose might get sinus symptoms inhale might get lung symptoms? Sorry, maybe silly question curious. Thanks. immunity builds time (then levels booster). buffer time took administer matters. I'd really interested hearing experience get vaccine. received JnJ 16 days ago quite strong immune response including 102 fever, horrible pain behind eyes, etc...pretty much full blown flu-like symptoms 24 hours followed another day moderate symptoms 48 hours later fatigue. Now, never tested positive Covid last year everyone know received JnJ strongest reaction far. recent research showing least mRNA vaccines first dose previously covid-infected individuals may mount robust immune response possible strong side effects I've waiting eagerly see data JnJ show something similar. might hit 250 million things go well been. Well. Let invite darker side COVID. Come sit phone calls get concerned parents child barking like seal 101.4 fever, 92 year old want go hospital - trouble breathing, going lie weak calling much...or lady bronchitis years ""this time much worse"", 17 year old throwing three days despite correct medications....shall go on? 

This day, everyday, *plus* knife wounds, broken bones, heart attacks dog bites. 

Now multiply factor 2. 4. 
Come see dark side. 3 4 months everyone wants vaccinated able to, point short period time especially said restrictions loosed place using it. still wear mask socially distance venue running reduced capacity pointless.

Are really expected keep order protect people refuse get vaccinated? near me, obvs. that’s point.. someone wants wear one, completely okay. I’m talking requirements mandates. know ironic not? guess that's state sub now. Prove it. Show polls. No, high list rollout. No, mixing vaccinated people huge groups non vaccinated people begging mutations virus created. mention deaths Dec 2019 early 2020 tested count towards total.

I belive many (if any). educated guess based fact work one first UK laboratories tested (back early February 2020). lab pick first positive early March - so, even given relatively small numbers tests comparison later months, obvious pool infections first recorded death UK. I'm college professor. student mine wants wear mask next year, whats you?

WHY CARE MUCH OTHERS OH GOD sure whats going brazil want go rabbit hole time night dont citizens rise him?  that’s completely okay tell get fuck hospitals lockdown again.

**Young adults seeing higher infection rates Florida reports 5,759 new COVID-19 cases**

**18-25 age group filling hospital beds county’s [**average age new infections lowered age trend, according Dr. Raul Pino, Florida Department Health Orange County. Yes does. true, means social platforms really failed duty. kids anti-vaxxers anti-maskers vaccinated grands want see them? brother asthma still goes without mask, mask kids, get shot them. new baby. parents really high risk seen little kids since Thanksgiving 19 since sick Christmas year. tell parents go, tell brother stop stupid? wild today's view states legal restrictions private gatherings home.

Do now? Sorry following Germany's ruling mess even speak German. understood restrictions regard mainly applied gatherings public space. well regardless what's legal not, perception Dortmund that.. people give fuck 🤷🏻‍♂️  You’ve basically turned crowd didn’t want lockdown first place. patience ran immediately, run now. 

Yeah it’s taking mental toll. doesn’t change fact patience still required time, even stamina low. Deaths largely stopped falling cases rising. Wow masks social distancing life? Sounds completely realistic entirely sustainable! It’s European vaccine using American mRNA technology American producer distributor. 

Europeans hilarious. Little brother complexes little sad. That’s cool link. Thanks sharing it. I’m hoping see similar trend states. can't wait till kid get vax. US deaths rise. suspect hospital capacity soon headed down. worldwide race get many people vaccinated possible contagious variants become widespread. Ive idea talking about. going see true impact virus excess death numbers like this. learned nothing China's handling outbreak. Trace accounts back users. Sue damages. Jail endangerment. Something. try twist way want, people wearing masks still getting sick people wearing masks. masks worked mandates would stopped winter wave clearly didn't. simply can't blame small amount people wearing masks time florida would hit right now, like ""experts"" predicted dropped mandates, fine. Uhm getting serious symptoms vaccinated difficult, eo actual evidence role transmission? guess makes sense lowered risk transmission, since well less viral load, read ""extremely unlikely"" much certainty

Mandatory PS.: I'm expert, contrary, reddit so.. I've posted threads hoping someone else experienced - got first shot Pfizer yesterday 1 pm, brain fog severe husband pick work could drive. 30 hours later brain fog lifted still feeling like absolute shit. energy, lethargic, around unwell. Still glad got it, definitely messing me. symptoms started within 5 minutes getting injection See, masks don’t work. /s Fox News doesn’t say see people. Fox telling people see whole time.

Immunity memory quite similar real memory, things remember forever (smallpox usually gives lifelong immunity), things forget quickly (many seasonal viruses immune memory months) recall quickly upon re-exposure, still protected people never exposed vaccinated. read EU contract. UK plants mentioned 5.4 deals sites pre-approved production talks vaccines generally. therefore included Additional Optional doses EU could order later. Clause 5.1 specifically states Initial European Doses (defined original 300M) manufactured EU - include UK. 5.4 clearly limits definition EU including UK 5.4 cannot apply 5.1. 

The two somewhat contradictory seems (and legal analysis read agree interpretation) Initial doses manufactured listed EU sites. Uk factories pre-approved EU ordered AZ decided use line probably intended fulfilling 100M exclusivity deal UK. Commission choosing interpret UK sites involved everything politically expedient so. intention specifically state otherwise 5.1 limit scope 5.4? 

The contract seems bit mess considering high powered legal teams available sides lawyer certainly Belgian lawyer. clearest indication Commission position weak lack attempt actually go court beyond rather symbolic issuing letter requiring mediation. pretty sure spread via aerosol, also via ballistic droplets. Therefore, word spoken proximity capable transmitting infectious dose.

For example, fomite transmission demonstrated Chinese outdoor study done winter conditions, people meet talk outdoors.
It looks like could minor influence epidemic, seem 1000-fold risk reduction something like that. study concludes risks known certain. Also, outdoor contacts tend couple social groups, increases influence course epidemic, least high R dispersion, meaning clustered outbreaks - mode seems less prominent right Europe, according sparse hints released governments. I'm glad wear mask, many people unless required. still required.

I understand probably us forever, I'm saying anything like wait we're 0 cases. actually problem things opening back mask requirements reduced capacity makes sense. me, I'm anything I'm fully vaccinated, month now. far fully back normal, think need wait vaccines way limited, pretty much everyone wants one one. Presumably cases also low point, too. think we're months away this.

I'm sorry events cancelled. seems like outdoor sporting events healthy people kind thing still pretty safe now. Hopefully rounding corner kinds events common. That’s awesome, hope comes fruition near future Pure bs really whole big clinical trial thing boosters. get approved way flu shot does. Vaccine makers big clinical trials new flu shot every single year. in-laws met granddaughter. year old. scheduled get first shot early April. thank Thank God Donald Trump! try reading comment learning subject, might understand Henry dead. I'm sure would agree results. end? what? I’ve seen entire family inside unmasked past year. people still care... Many studies cited efficacy number one shot. Vaccines efficacy also decrease time. would shocked J&amp;J data six weeks themselves. state crumbling dump middle White Supremacist Police Surveillance State Second World Shithole™. 

Keep fucking chicken there, buddy. ""Some Americans"" personal pronoun; I'm well aware quarantining many Americans not, that's talking about. Ah yes it’s knows what’s best interest every individual person planet. Yep, aren’t vaccinated (in 30’s, two kids 8,4). 

Spent afternoon evening law parents today. Feels good. shots we’ve (relatively) safe. Go BO JO! People say deaths lag case counts forget vaccination lags case counts 2 weeks too. 25% American adults vaccinated 60-70% vulnerable population covered. 

At point must go back normal (probably may) continuing invest science come better cure vaccines variants. 

But anyone tell shock emotional state billions people (think children’s mental health without friends) worth getting back normal soon. Yeah, reasons work probably reason worked Germany: lot people still need go work people private meetings even illegal. Germany ever restrict mobility level Chile (permissions requested go outside limited 2 per week reason ""essential"" job, forbidden interprovincial travelling without good reason, strict national level curfew), much less level China actually worked (permissions per household, mandatory app tracking tracing, strict control hell essential job, etc).

Other reason economical, support affected people joke Chile. Germany problem, still wont ever restrict mobility level would efficient planet let people make personal life choices you? I’ve seen grandparents whole time, we’re fine. alarms ringing entire trump presidency though  don’t care get sick. That’s thing.. say willing take risk. probabilities tat won’t get sick views 

As long you’re around vulnerable people, say go that’s want risk want take.

Just don’t come back upset happened. majority Funny voted considering countries handling covid well would definitely sounded alarm bells ""moderates"" whole slew officials booted one another. stupid. I’ve seen family grandparents whole time. We’ve fine masks, indoors. It’s called risk tolerance. could trade covid diabeetus get donut every day! Thanks heads up! It’s heartbreaking hear daughter cry say goodbye short visit grandparents. can’t wait fully vaccinated longer trips! B1.135 lineage

Wtf even mean?? 

I looking information. known I’d get propaganda here. worry, somehow someone comes solutions world's problems every reddit thread too. We'll fine. Reddit's case. Thanks taking time send back serious response. 


Few things:
Your articles saying exactly saying. problem detaining minors US rather turning away making wait river. letting ""illegals"" originally stated. article highlights detention created crisis see now. Biden going moral high ground. 


This think confused: would fact make sure is, immediately surge border — people seeking asylum. deserve heard,” Biden said. “That’s are. We’re nation says, ‘If want flee you’re fleeing oppression, come.’”

This 100% correct saying think saying. Asylum seeking illegal immigration. legally morally obligated help asylum seekers. Since came statement, explicitly launched campaign saying hold due extreme circumstances dealing now. try find presser lady charge program interested.


Thanks link press conference, watched live (I end watching due nature job). think two great moments - first, says something along lines of, regrets detaining minors sending back forcing children fend themselves. important me. second analogy parents deciding sell everything send child stranger United States. story designed tug heart strings something personal knowledge/experience hit home. Early career, worked project cataloging remains (DNA other) tried make trip US never made it. goal project give parents relatives closure. parents relatives story reality. 


I agree coming due perception Joe Biden allow in. think different reality unfortunately used advertising tool links say. careful distancing perception reality. immediate thought draw parallels people stormed capital stating reasons behind Jan 6th. mean, don’t know long long long term. first mRNA vaccines widespread use. However, they’ve gone stages vaccine would need go widespread. vaccines typically take longer stages spread due vaccine needing ASAP. phase 3 trials, they’d submit approval. It’s like wait 1-5 years see happens phase 3 trial. approve keep monitoring afterwards. one would pour R&amp;D vaccines took 5-10 years come market. 

And, aren’t new terms research development. mRNA technologies developed treat diseases conditions, it’s need new vaccine use type delivery system. finally ran scenario using makes ton sense, did. 

Pretty much vaccine side effects found within trial timelines. AFAIK, vaccine ever used, find really bad side effect like 1+ year later. extremely unlikely, based past precedence vaccine works, side effects take year manifest. Shit, would extremely rare took 6 weeks manifest. That’s trials length are. It’s extremely unlikely something would present conclude. it’s going happen, it’s going happen relatively fast. mRNA vaccine going circulating within 1-3 days. mine last Sunday. thing inside spike proteins body producing immune response to. eventually destroy those, that’s it. liposome pegylated delivery system similar seen AIDS medications, cancer medications, etc. afaik, don’t see long term side effects taken regularly compared two dose vaccine. Zijian, deputy director China’s Center Disease Control Prevention, identified four possible origins:  bat carrying virus infected person.  bat infected mammal gave person.  virus came shipments cold frozen food.  leaked Wuhan laboratory researching viruses. 

“A coronavirus variant circulating Brazil likely able reinfect people survived infections earlier versions coronavirus, new data suggest. variant emerged Brazil, called P.1, carries mutation already known make variant prevalent South Africa harder treat antibodies harder prevent available vaccines. New data suggest many recovered patients, immunity earlier versions virus afford immunity P.1. “

[article I’m perfectly fine wearing mask blows over. arguments there. got first one today!! Here’s hoping normal soon... Papers, please. Ah yes, brutal US sanctions Maduro's fault. Anyway completely deflected, move goal posts, someone bus driver effective are? bus driver bad? classist? Isn’t problem national infection rate increased 223% vs group 317%? 

Wouldn’t indicate infectivity group higher absence perfect testing age group displaying symptoms prompt higher testing levels previously? Venezuela's quality life plummeted last 7 years Maduros fault. Lol okay bud 

Point July November 5+ months. That’s long took B1.135 become dominant. Also hope know B1.135 *is* 501Y.V2. B1.135 name lineage. Might want edit comment. also ignored highly relevant fact B1.135/P.1 currently competing B.117, data indicates B.117 outpacing two variants. 

You started asking question it’s clear intention start argument. You’ve embarrassed it’s apparent don’t know you’re talking about. evidence that? seen any. far know, younger people seem affected vaccinated yet, makes cases hospitalizations seem high comparison Thats quarantine is.

You really, really confused. mild symptoms even lack means incredibly difficult find patient zero. sure drink lots water later. Ice acetaminophen arm sore. Sure. reduce cutoff age 50 years corresponding percentage 4%. Alternatively 96% deaths people aged 50 older. look what's going Brazil feel like could've us gotten new administration Jan J&amp;J study conducted Brazil time P1/P2 variant accounted 69% cases; vaccine showed effectiveness 68% Brazil, 66% overall, 72% US symptomatic covid (and apparently higher efficacy severe covid) (see page 37: 

So J&amp;J vaccine proven efficacy P1 variant. vaccine's efficacy *substantially* different US, little P1 variant time. 

There work Pfizer AZ vaccines vs P1 variant lab results promising, conclusive (bottom page 14: 

It seems likely that, even though available vaccines optimized defend P1 variant, provide protection. get rid version Donald Trump, help lot getting things done right better. Nope, Virginia. upstate sites extras? Nice classism Surprised Pikachu face! we're dealing risk adverse germaphobes projecting fears onto rest society.  thought Coronavirus thread! Pick bent story true, regardless what's said accurate inaccurate.

When absolutely sick coronavirus news reddit, simply blocking dozen accounts silenced nearly everything.

Social media game people. highly doubt it. CDC keep guidelines place. Walensky never going give clear. disposable? Irrelevant. B1.135 almost entirely replaced 501.Y.V2 October December, 2020. multiple spike protein mutations 501.Y.V2 P1 make far contagious. supplant far quickly. 

Not trying argue. understand imperative you’re working under. Obfuscate truth greater good. People tend find looking for. push agenda even know full well facts support it. Let's prolong lol ignorant self select part normal society 

That goal governments businesses want require proof vaccination--and negative test results--for people fly, attend sports music events, enter government building place business. surprised see article says: ""**Do need negative COVID-19 test get domestic flight?** Mostly no.

It’s real shame became politicized. banking China's population voting, think even know vote... Wait what? assumed would worse Ireland due UK vaccination rate. would FTC that's supposed uphold truth advertising many people careless infected youngsters infected? people doing? forget /s

Compared Denmark, Norway Finland, Sweden's approach great success. long vaccine immunity last ? believe that's bit outdated, they're like 4000/million right now.
Russia close 500k excess deaths around 3000/million.

I think real worldwide death toll least twice much reported, probably even more. believe official numbers coming countries like China, India, Indonesia, countries Africa etc... They’re higher Northern Ireland, that’s open transit England. Ireland would much lower cases weren’t Northern Ireland  OP, guess refers fo point 13.1 (e) EU-AZ contract.  You’d surprised.

Why folks dv'd pointing out?  parts US low seropositivity like New England live. Fortunately people willing get vaccine least locally achieve herd immunity think.

I'm worried South turning constant slow burn churning new variants attitudes change though. curfew achieve though? UK pub, restaurants, anywhere else want go evening shut anyway, can't go people's houses either. see /s panicked 100 upvotes...don't want reddit go full crazy. havent said anything like knowledge.

Id curious know exactly youve read make believe contrary. I'm still convinced college students. colleges completely cancelled spring break. replaced handful Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays (never 1 per week) others completely got rid days beyond weekends. Even many local government officials said things like ""I think college Calling people names contribute productive conversation. Wait cases significantly higher Ireland Northern Ireland. Adjusted population like 6 5 ratio wish media push sensationalized stories give impression younger people vulnerable dying COVID. means you’re skeptical cynical everything reason, 1 10 million event occurs validates you, use smug. Ah well. Still hopefully mostly now. doubt profit would change production problems honest echo desire see get sorted. I'm norwegian.

It's here: wait 6+ months get free get faster local private clinic, cost. Survival rate much higher 98% regular people. response question, reasoning based logic science, political expediency. 

I hope learned lesson asking genuine, on-point questions. Enjoy -55 downvotes.  say? SMFHO. there’s kids grandma. woman 70’s still thinks covid isn’t thing refuses get vaccinated. know won’t kids giving her. They’ll seeing FaceTime foreseeable future. Moderna Novavax coming along soon. Constrained supply period gets better - assuming EU don’t go full ban. Why? Rich countries much higher death rates &amp; case numbers per capita. What’s reasoning giving equal amounts every country regardless situation? Yeah closing ruin site seems bit token effort country it. Wow clever.  Nah would got shredded undermining unity internally within EU. pressure conform would enormous spineless politicians would gone along status quo. made easier plus Boris bit gung ho big majority Parliament. imagine Teresa May David Cameron saying better taking risk going alone? can’t. Well think trouble ""we"" decided cutting death number asap priority cutting transmission, deaths almost exclusively age group, it. absolutely would've seen bigger/faster decline cases we'd prioritized occupation/exposure, even open season right start, that. think Australia producing vaccine can’t really much it.  45 “Anyone defiling disease must wear torn clothes, let hair unkempt, cover lower part face and cry out, ‘Unclean!

I'm fellow commonwealther, assuming NZer. Socialized medicine pretty shit, best functioning systems largely private. Honestly least privately delivered, public hospitals, publicly employed unionized nurses/Drs, paid government capable paying themselves.

Wtf lmao We've batting 95%+ older age groups.

There might case countries taking complete supply, countries taking surplus. might explain deliveries specific countries scalable rest EU + Norway. currently, adults deliberately sabotaging it. bet don’t even want vaccines, thrive controlling others. control.. Except is. People calling America get herd immunity letting everyone get sick, going number(which due improved care, also goes packed hospitals are), that’s 7.5 million Americans dead. maintain “small” number actual sociopath Reporting lag probably two days average, realistically /u/jjhorn13 tomorrow's data. varies bit state factors. UK makes lipids Pfizer vaccine, EU stealing UK's lipids? think so. think proposals DRASTIC team relocate centers virology research outside major cities makes lot sense could mitigate risk. 

The next virus could lot worse identifying source could mitigate risk. nothing politics. Oh meant tax day! Thought you’re talking vaccine eligibility Every single ""vaccinated only"" situation we've seen far still requires masks ""social distancing."" Fauci, Biden, every public health official seem pretty adamant telling people vaccines anything masks stay. I'd swear they're trying deliberately sabotage vaccine effort know better, actually makes blood boil stupid they're this. people gambling *other* people's lives. 

Want guess many times I've seen someone sub say vaccine reduce transmission? individual getting vaccine changes nothing person still need live like hermit still spread COVID?

Herd immunity comes result individuals getting vaccine changes something individual person mass level. Every person gets vaccine another individual step towards herd immunity. get vaccine, helping end pandemic help things get back normal. fully vaccinated weeks, start going back normal (seeing vaccinated friends family, going beach, outdoor dining, etc)

But that's sold lot Americans result it. knew coming, campaigns tell people #Stay Home least #Stay Local? the, ""You want Spring Break parties? Get vaccinated tell friends same!"" 

Wait, young people can't get vaccinated? Gee, wonder who's fault is! anyone asking Spring Break pushed back late April people would chance get vaccinated? 

It's 2021 everyone still asking wrong questions getting wrong answers. Already did. 

Last fall, actually.

Had chills back discomfort days, lost sense smell taste week. 

I’ve flus hangovers far worse. 

Not single issue problem since, much like 99% people get thing. 

Spare “long COVID” nonsense, too. far I've seen AZ trials larger gaps different dosing amounts peer reviewed, controlled studies scale phase 3 trial. mean work way, data available back decision based either conjecture political. adjust downwards two-shot vaccines though? 70% country gets Pfizer Moderna shot, that's effectively 35% completion vaccination. certainly won't, vaxxed Yes it’s true half people 65+ Florida gotten least first shot vaccine. I’m one them. doesn’t change fact huge crowd maskless people jammed together dancing yelling open drunken mouths, hookup sex generally usual spring break craziness, isn’t perfect storm covid superspreader event? Especially sneaky virus often asymptomatic strong young people contagious. 
 I’m glad I’m west/Gulf coast instead Miami!  like lightswitch. many vaccines. referring? combination people letting guard down, possible seasonal factors, UK variant. 

Pennsylvania needs double number currently vaccinated individuals permanently drive cases. getting way, alternative force everybody? Who's selfish one lol? Fake news Yeah French definitely messed up. Point is, factors like society built up, public health, medical policies, climate, cultural norms, seasons etc. Etc. much impact harshness restrictions. Harsher restrictions always equal better outcome places looser restrictions. Many factors play! real hipsters get novavax. running 'round. la Beatles one dose provides significant protection. effectively means hospitalizations almost entirely people refused vaccination June. think fair ask country give another Summer protect them. I’m educating vaccinations encourage actual knowledge increase likelihood can, get vaccine. 

I also believe abuse power manipulation exists. Forcing documentation definitely going worry people fence, even rationale could debated. well first off, i'm sure relates said. stay inside protect risk.

Kids able go school excessive fear endemic disease. Can’t wait till required vaccine passports. Wtf. Fuck Every month goes learn another one ""Stand science trust plan!!"" safety measures actually anything. Staying three feet apart apparently good six feet. Closing restaurants reduced spread one percent. Normal masking apparently good, need double mask.

And anytime anyone questions it, they're called ""science deniers"" want kill grandma. fact asking questions considered science denial scare shit anyone knows science is. people wonder there's ever diminishing amount faith public health authorities. constantly admit knowingly lying justifying positions faulty data, apologize ask us trust anyway. maddening. get people continue tolerate it. Thanks, said basically, stealing. production inside UK goes ZERO EU, stealing. AstraZeneca delivery contracts ignore EU, fulfill UK contracts. Delivery contracts equal. Plus EU paid entire production AstraZeneca vaccine FRONT contracts UK. Right... 7 billion people, 0.23% still “big” number. Except, isn’t. there’s 7 billion us. Cases absolutely tanked CA, Israel type proportions. expense rest Europe, gg. Pfizer recommends six weeks. Damn move next month. What? comment talking vaccinating kids, better air filtration...  get argument; hearing people constantly admit flagrantly ignoring instruction medical guidance, tell administration determined undermine system place avert disaster, *would* lessened. 

Non-COVID patients would go down. least... much. Perhaps misread. fascinates story idea ""masked tourist"". would anyone themselves? simply going go vacation place would require wear mask. That's simply orthogonal idea ""vacation"". mostly means spending free time random parts nature country, mostly completely alone, that's feasible option right now, that's still miles ahead even attractive tourist destination ""pandemic precautions"". hoping 1 dose strategy going take help distribute vaccines faster around world. several less “official” studies say least somewhat protected 14 days, yes, however studies also contain large windows variances protected actually are. seems widely accepted first dose offers quite bit protection two weeks, also “full” vaccination, seems judgement call. Right, official death toll way less excess deaths mean government done shitty job counting you’re describing logical fallacy ignoring rule large numbers. Covid infectious/spreads much faster flu higher death rate, even though science community made incredible strides lowering number. couple months ago people dying every day USA died 911 20 years later take time memorialize 2,753 human lives lost(rightfully so) pay attention u/Dumb-reality, know interpret data. Please stop posting misinformation. Thanks. cannot imagine family going through. kids, son's friend (10yo) sister (who believe 12yo) probably went worst months lives, getting covid19, losing dad right Xmas (he ICU ventilator month prior must sucked anyway), almost losing grandma cares lot time living fear mom (the adult life hospital) could get end similar condition (luckily never caught stopped contagious full time) basically leaving system. 

All year school closed abruptly mid year, longer able see friends hobbies outside home, probably school struggling remote learning like many others... gosh 2020 cursed them.

In comparison even time family going similar amount stress, least ended ""serious"", got news couple day prior xmas sons biopsy came back negative cancer could get tumor removed safely would longer pain recovered (he surgery day friends dad died). Sure scary month comparison nothing. worst us year mostly daughter definitely struggled remote learning luckily back person bit son stayed remote recover physical therapy. 
I know son going sad friend likely longer school/town him. trying reach mother hang point safe so.

We're woods yet, know well happens open early. countries froze agreement effect cancelled it. think that? Bible Belt country? We’re one of, the, least religious countries world. Bible Belt however, people living said Bible Belt fanatical. Wait vaccinating children? USA beginning testing think means vaccinations complete... second shot 3-4 weeks first. means expect adults *done* first shot mid May. People confusing timeline states given dates scheduling *open* adults. timelines completing vaccinations sooner. family saying you’re pretty much protected 2 weeks trying argue sooner able hang friends I’m wondering Brazil, means Oxford/AZ Pfizer/BioNTech, mostly use Sinovac (and we're yet receive first batch Pfizer shots) mom's hugging grandkids since started. high risk 68 zero interest isolating. get sucked getting much shit trying stay away I'm going work every day accidentally infect her.

Thank goodness we're (except kids course) couple weeks away form us fully vaccinated. feel like dodged bullet I'm still little peeved disregarding health guilt suffered trying keep us healthy. people live complete isolation. hospitals clogged sick people bad business, ya know. AZ WOULD STOPPED SUPPLY COUNTRIES IMMEDIATELY mean PA’s entire rollout. bad reopening continues. vulnerable vaccinated weeks (if want it). People free stay home needed. PA getting hammered new infections? care guess does. agree, unfortunately add one flair thought vaccination tag relevant. many people think executed breaking quarantine Wuhan? What's source that?

Or rather, *parts* advanced.

It huge swathes unimaginable poverty, right next places, areas pretty similar (south) western Europe. hospitals ability keep records good.

Imagine like US, corruption. lots people living third-world conditions (which makes suppressing virus much harder), giant mess. sad could prevented taking lot stricter measures. unnecessary name like name I've saying since beginning. people initially tough times due long span unemployment, majority people remained employed adequately assisted benefits, simultaneously seeing expenses plummet due lack available discretionary activities. lead lots middle class people enhanced demand discretionary activities (anything going movies travel), enough funds actually make happen. see massive boom.

The thing concern potential another subprime mortgage crisis, good amount people ability pay rent, used evicition freezes so. civil war know, I’ll take get. Middle April.

We already point rural places mostly y'all vaccinating or??? going stay home every child vaccinated late 2022?

Since we’re allowing international travel, going stay home 2025 final countries get vaccine?

After 2025, since variants moved, causing need boosters, stay home entire virus eradicated? advocate entire world follow? locked we're cautious ""ignorant"" states. be??? problem unvaccinated kids. risk less it’s zero. fear everyone completely disregarding masks social distancing virus hitting millions kids spared far. weekend days don’t really count offices shut we’ve always reported 0 deaths weekends even peak. zero deaths day reported Tues-Sat means much more. suppose gain keeping place, covid over? +3.28 million according Cyrus Shahpar. 3 million last Sunday. get you’re saying, it’s probably huge deal long run. sad :(( Polling bad news immediately vaccine paused checks objective measure. temporary situation. work saturday time sunday comes day catch stuff devil always details.

Prolonged lockdowns restrictions do. huge personal societal cost, discussion table. think happening world. know anecdotal, see completely different picture Slovenia compared last year similar regime lockdown.

Lockdowns simply working - science behind wrong (even though decisions really stupid) trust lost, government helping financially need money eat, simple that. Almost businesses except culture sector working ""in secret"", taxes paid. loose loose situation all. ""lockdowns"" simply working. peoples fault? guess. personally know I'm done. take care infect elderly family (or anyone get damn thing, course). simply believe anything anymore. end? 2022? 2023?

I'm miserable feel stuck situation I'm allowed socialize, meet new people, fun others. funny news articles always days behind. New hospitalizations increasing deaths beginning plateau. Unfortunately, bring case level low level, kind surge would probably second biggest winter one. 

Since making good progress vaccinations, remain hopeful major surge avoided, going take everyone sticking preventative measures time being. twelve accounts, article short doesn""t contain much information. fact ask good sign. may be, happening even minor frequency, we'd certainly hear it. They're really solid price. initial break nose wire (it leaks first 6 hours face) seal better kf94 kn95 particular face. Unfortunately look ridiculous, since they're skinny aesthetic larger head, Im concerned safety looks now. I'll go comfortable visually pleasing kf94 second shot. Apparently doesn’t take long new variants become dominant. linked article:

“The 501Y.V2 variant spread rapidly South Africa, accounting 11% viruses sequenced (44 392) first week October 2020, 60% sequenced (302 505) first week November 2020, 87% sequenced (363 415) first week December 2020.”

11% 87% two months seems pretty rapid. 

If P1 is, conjecture, prevalent America BC, far contagious original CV19, seems quite plausible could become dominant US quickly. point efficacy US administered vaccines P1 extremely relevant. Damn. huge number. many families devastated Covid-19. It’s hard nihilistic, this. I’m work parade cars anti-mask signs drove past honking. People stupid. could agree more.

Places like hospitals, airports, government buildings reason remove mask mandates, doubt ever will. Sanitation theater continue exist various businesses. I'm confident life ""return normal"" places can't operate sanitation theater (mostly entertainment industry), I'm **extremely** pessimistic restrictions ever going away completely.

Unless there's huge amount backpedaling government CDC provides official guidance recommending people stop wearing masks stop social distancing, never gonna stop. see happening. Britain domestic capacity make 140 million vaccine doses year new site Oxford, 140 million Braintree, Essex, 200 million year Livingston Scotland next year result UK government funding taking proactive approach. Here's response ""Christian"" friends family using excuse:

First, Leviticus 13 tells us wear fucking mask we're sick stay hell away people make sick. 

Second, great tempter asked Christ throw temple ""trust"" God would save him. Christ called bullshit. know Christ's response willfully needlessly putting others danger guise ""trusting"" God literally following Satan's orders. 

I'm particularly religious anymore, long time. grew religious household still keep enough call bullshit see it. dying covid per se, vaccine’s side effects, like Florida dr. Greg Michael think name.

There confirmed cases people contracting covid taking vaccine. Eat asshole lol Imagine living disgusting lame life  US wrost actually. Congratulations spreading misinformation. July 4th fantastic. 70% magic number easily pass number end June.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* expect see point? Vaccination largely targeted vulnerable, less infected see less hospitalization death. However, people moving around like pandemic ended January, we're seeing infection less vulnerable people, population less likely end hospital.

So, vaccinate vaccinate vaccinate (well .. two anyway). dont see reason would issue. get shots different locations, different state can't imagine would matter. Who? Im interested know lockdowns could work, pure common sense point view, people aren’t mixing together could reduce cases everyone mixing normal? 

Because people disobedient. close public places people still going meet privately.

Same reason mask policy fairly irrelevant. people follow strictly responsible enough need mandate it. also take many measures reduce spread. people would need mandate, wear street publicly take friends private. agree school extremely important, contain extinguish method proven effective. 

If keep case levels low kids go school. bars closed, schools. 

Young kids actually pretty well virtual, person less risk. Older kids horribly virtual, spread virus person. 

My local school district open along. 17 year olds infected age demographic city. extremely concerning since kids likely asymptomatic thus get tested. 

I’d willing bet 40-60% high school students infected. 

The current prevalence high school 0.7% last 14 days tested positive. community prevalence last 14 days 0.1%. high school 7 times prevalence. 

At one point November high school 3.7% population test positive 14 day window. community putting 60% positive per test rates. heavily Republican area know lot people getting kids tested. time 1.8% community tested positive 14 day window. two week time period people became infected first 6 months pandemic. 

They finally shutdown high school 4 weeks, kept everything else open like high schoolers don’t younger brothers sisters. mess. 

Cases doubled high school last two weeks. another seasonal surge coming nobody anything stop happening. Yes, need wait while. ask doctor. work ATM’s company offered us $150 Walmart card get vaccine.

That's also could control virus without much lockdown cases like Taiwan South Korea. US time idea quarantining people came virus already widespread impossible trace. one could tell anymore, way quarantine infected lock everyone.

Handling virus early key strategic difference countries well ones didn't; results lockdown quarantine strategies really consequences early late. Noone talking forever. enough people vaccinated. see, that's good then. Pfizer? Dad got month ago. That's ok miss show compassion got vaccinated let live lives again.

More importantly, bottleneck shifts supply demand, lots people bother getting vaccinated they're told still need follow depressing guidelines even vaccinated. strategy already tested:

Maybe better air flow wouldn’t end massive spread kinds germs every winter. I’ve seen multiple situations school majority class gets flu, many teachers combine classes, etc. Maybr covid motivate us start addressing air flow maybe help lessen spread sorts things. 20% substantial, infection rates rebounding now. much opening soon. patience.

Excess deaths already accounts this, no? Let's say see 100 excess deaths. Maybe that's 120 people died covid 20 people die flu. Either way, covid caused 100 excess deaths. Covid causing people die heart attacks delaying care, also reducing traffic accident deaths. Either way, excess death numbers (imperfectly) capture behavior. ""it short-term"" argument laughably absurd I'm convinced people say hand-wave away ethical legal issues things raise.

This, comparatively, child's play. least, vaccine passports serve important purpose (whereas information voluntarily give tech companies every day usually). guess saying here, support roll vaccines, would hill willing die on? much intrusive forms data collection already occurring. year ago 0 deaths, it’s new virus, one ability remove entirely, seriousness least. nothing natural this, locked entire world. Yes eventually go back normal world well pandemic over, something touch everyone, sense connection, fail see problem here? mean wont die day caught covid. Weekend days dont seem different view. talking about? me...We, entire world, know since clinical trials conducted 21 days, 42. get trying funny zeroing seconds minutes. nothing world exact. best get *as close* mark possible.

The CDC Pfizer recommend 21 days first second dose Pfizer. I'm going follow CDC's recommendation try get *as close* recommendation possible. I'm sorry upsets strange reason. one decides what’s legal what’s not. courts that. fast tests work presymptomatic people. I’d curious ro know who’s saying otherwise. Biden hasn’t blessed yet U.S. Citigroup sending thousands part study. They’re already use elsewhere. 


- They’re selling Germany: UK: “trials indicated test 98.1% sensitivity, meaning returns false negatives, 99.7% specificity, meaning false positives.” US testing behind, Citigroup gets around lack approval part academic study. (not sure what’s url, story there. got first shot, rather feel shitty vaccine covid damage body parts It’s breach medical privacy. 

The difference exempt mask usage medically exempt receiving vaccine actually documented cases chronically ill/immune suppressed people cannot medically receive vaccines. mention children, toddlers, micro groups people vaccine wasn’t tested on. Refusing let people business didn’t get vaccinated? That’s law suit medical discrimination waiting happen. 

You can’t force people disclose specific condition prevented getting vaccinated violation HIPPA. Extremely, extremely illegal. anyone realistically try implement this, sued. know people love idea authoritative action “vaccine passports” anything international travel insanely unconstitutional. think lot misunderstanding would actually used for. much unknown! read article sub best ""timeline"" could find real physical evidence behind it. Prior 10 days seems detectable level immunity 10 days able find real cell detected majority people. also detected types immunity 12 14 days. Killed half million Americans, left even may permanent side effects = mostly harmless virus. denser thought refuse argue idiots. good day Since card would easy counterfeit alter, think unlikely accepted significant purpose. *7821. Almost 8k people die every day USA Mark words, Mexico one last 5 get rid virus put america danger this, new variants appear mexico focal point them. government simply able control this. don’t get decide what’s legal what’s not. courts do, courts ruled yet. mandate could federal facilities, buildings commercial airlines, kind like RealID requirements. maybe they're considering foreign travelers arriving here, makes sense. Yeah, maybe pandemic dude's putting ball hoop important considering immense amount interstate travel easily spread disease. extremely confident every state open 4th July. rationale lockdowns then, point costing business. Northeastern states starting open even cases still bit high. Oddly currently well average number deaths occur time year.
Its virus killed LOT old winter normally kills anyway.
Every cloud, that. people really holding back pre-pandemic? It’s warning. literally happening speak. 

If someone tell something happening right front face makes lose respect them, you’re kind idiot. try, link actual site article  I'm assuming among those aged 30 59 surged start year mid-March pace nearly double national average 316%. age groups saw deaths jump least 317%"" Like 20 girls saw walking around Bar-hopping Algoma Wisconsin Bachlorette Party Fri night.......of course is...... Okay, fair enough. time, trying weed clickbait headlines find actual data, looks like risk fully vaccinated person catching virus extremely low. risk spreading even lower since viral load reduced. 

We're never going get 0% risk vaccine gets percentages low enough think reasonable expect fully vaccinated people stay isolated another months. Especially vacation someplace going hanging outdoors sun heat, know pretty safe even vaccinated. Well, part problem original premise flawed - done vaccinating vulnerable certainly anywhere close vaccinating 35+. We're still couple months away that, young people getting still spreading people die long term complications it. Exactly many vulnerable one dose far...a good level protection good weeks time things open. Yeah, flattened 1000 deaths day. Yay? would probably separate states groups based waves happened. place dropped january 80% wave 2 might different place dropping 90% wave 1 dropping 10% flat spot wave 3 whatever.

figuring much january/feb drop unusual unexpected would hard think can't live like forever. Humans social creatures. might well crawl back devonian ocean living like forever plan. So? really don’t understand issue. get vaccine. It’s free I'm allergic another -cillin (so likely penicillin too) fine shot. know idiots are. Rona God's idea point us???? 19 deaths UK (80 million people) vs 25 deaths city? country talking again? article US endzone US May 1. sure covered part two book involved higher education, personally think none nearly restrictions fall everyone wanted get vaccine chance get one. 

now flu season, think masking rules similarity symptoms, doubt classroom setting masks required areas high vaccine uptake Even neighboring Connecticut expanding vaccination adults April 5th. Cuomo miserably failed initial Coronavirus response he’s failing vaccination campaign well. people see using comments people explaining much crore is. tell it’s whiskey, 100% vaccination month mean, flu deaths still thing normal nobody would call tragic people die flu. numbers low, look excess death statistics. dang... thinking getting J&amp;J convenience 1 dose, side effects sound worse college hangovers. True. Travel good example too. Bringing international tourism back would big impact economy. sooner get everyone vaccinated, sooner bring travel back. Percentages don’t matter unless you’re given context them. “300% increase” sound scary without given context, knowing something increased 9 27 sounds less scary. anybody day day ""timeline"" various steps immune system process happen vaccination? sheer curiosity - got first Pfizer dose yesterday pretty good sense mechanics works, seen ""what happens when."" Like, sit weird achy muscles slight fever, mean cells started making spike proteins, T-cells already called in? B cells start making antibodies? There's amazing project going inside body want follow along play play! xD officially, everyone chat seems think masks still mandated, that’s Rutgers (not school) officially announced study 20,000 healthcare workers United Kingdom found 6,600 people previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, 44 contracted — less 1 percent. Exactly. Birx stfu. NEVER need hear again. zero credibility, authority integrity. What’s worry you’re vaccinated? said ""not knowing"" ""a big deal"" admitting know 42 days dangerous 20 days 5 hours 21 days 3 hours, decided get upset appointment booking day 21. 

i realize may calm anxieties that, also admitted knowing said studies indicate difference efficacy based day on. based hour day 21 second within hour. worry sick trying sort things must happen specific day versus lol. bet tylenol went every 6 hours someone went around stop watch worrying taking dose minutes early late Went school rural NC town, teachers practically allergic opening windows, especially temperature 75⁰ EXACTLY. 

Class taking place outside would probably boost everyone's morale. Non paywall isn´t inviting stupid young people rying get infected ? driver's license? Kinda need make sure safely operate 3500+ pound moving object ""not dangerous"". normal person using virus means societal control. people want get vaccine, power you. dont want random private company know medical history. creeps fuck people excited this. many sensitive Americans sub lately. laugh off. maybe people gave up? 

They wouldn’t still hunting “given up,” fyi. You’re contradicting yourself. vaccines *available* doesn’t mean isn’t still high demand them. What’s dangerous declaring global pandemic simply you’re bored it. know thought November too. walk in. None pharmacy area scheduling answering scheduling questions phone. app opt in. that's correct assessment. celebration pisses quite badly. see covid societal collapse preventable deaths... Thank award :) Amazon actually pays employees pretty well states US (starting pay like $15 warehouses). states still $8 minimum wage. Yes I'm saying peg expanded qualifications number doses delivered state. example say restrictions availability 30m doses delivered state opposed saying restrictions availability may 15th whatever date entirely true, UK started vaccine planning major mistakes made inform us future mutations? put edit I’ll repeat it: 

If one denied service due race gender, still need judge tell that’s illegal? would understand can’t act within law? Excellent. That's million doses per day. better get 2.5 million first doses sometime next week. OK get virtuous stop signalling it. ironic Ireland, EU member state, probably would've better EU *hadn't* seized UK's AZ supply dutch factory. country small population, Ireland's share anything EU gains tiny, whereas UK got would genuinely lot room help Ireland out.  don’t want back !🤬 majority population vaccinated?

Yeah weird. happens something happens phone like dead battery stolen? okay app compiling data whereabouts? coronavirus becomes endemic yearly booster shots like flu, end? told point getting vaccinated return normal, pull phone prove vaccination every point entry every business isn’t normal. thousands people die preventable cause ?!?!?! able exceed 3 million doses day? would think given urban India people live within reasonable distance city current criteria get vaccine narrow always expand criteria. seems weird urban country many people 65 give away vaccines prevent going waste. Interesting, thanks insight! Would easier schools adopt 401(k) + social security model? don’t think EU even agreement Novavax. least haven’t heard it.

I don’t think Novavax capacity supply Europe we’re vaccinated producers. shocked find availability Q2. Big time this. concerts bailed sold tickets simply wasn’t mood go night. “There shows every night, nothing worry about” thought. LOL, little know...

And finally scheduled first big foreign vacation couple months COVID hit. Obviously, cancel it’s probably going happen mid-2022 earliest now.

Never procrastinating passing opportunities shit show over. I’m sure completely agree that. I’ve understood stuff correctly, reason much ado side effects AZ vaccine precisely lack understanding mechanism. COVID causes blood clots, would assume it’s conspicuous people get vaccine develop “regular” clots side effect. thing AZ clots present alongside low platelet counts, symptom COVID, makes far atypical conspicuous side effect. 

I’m medical expert, though, I’m going doctors reported. would certainly interesting know low platelet counts present Pfizer patients well. links articles blood clots related Pfizer vaccine? 58% roughly line rest week (e.g., yesterday's reported figure 61%)

Well idk spreadsheet wrong according yesterday 65.56%. last weeks average 67.2%, bit lower. much lower.

(Can't post google docs links send interested.) didn’t edit anything. did, would little symbol post indicating did. symbol put know what? You’re right. We’re brainless meatbags ability think kind linear logic critically understand rules structured society. desperately need lawyers judge overloads understand every micro action made within law! Thanks clarifying lmfao

You’re brainless every right hold opinion constitutionality laws. ultimately, judges get final say. You, ordinary person judge, get final say. don’t power judges do.

You yell scream, stamp feet like angry little child, ultimately power change nothing. Judges power, don’t. Accept it. People talk ostentatiously sad things like ""every tragic death"" actually feel sensation sadness: would crippling. signal stating think intellectual level, they're actually experiencing sensation. Well done. I'm 42 moderate severe asthma wife works care (where actually throw away unused vaccines 2/3 months ago). even phone call first vaccine yet despite contacting doctor NHS. 11 million doses coming next week Cuomo fan call bullshit. He’s holding back announcement time it’s opportune him.

I know, one states threatening prosecution giving doses would otherwise wasted. He's pretty dumb. Lmao. Getting concert hall, cruise ship, basketball game kind ""freedom"" they're talking about. prob sound stupid. would happen people getting second dose? immunity last 6 months? instead many years? hope so

The best times came tragedy 

Which 50s America looked good, post World War 2 optimism live lives choice 14% 16-29 year olds Scotland least one shot. likely health care workers health conditions. Theres figures say many young people two things said no. personally think everyones “doing they’re told” receive letter thats anecdotal. 

So 86% go 30’s! Looks like end April now. sure got downvoted, pretty reasonable analysis.

All helps, that’s 250K double doses longer come elsewhere. That’s us COVID day earlier 🤞 cry cake runs out. One person knew college told thinks we’re gonna masks five six years due anti-vaxxers. 

I don’t know say response, say anything all.

Well idk spreadsheet wrong according yesterday 65.56%. last weeks average 67.2%, bit lower. much lower. vaccine protects infected, hell care someone else might get sick? faith vaccine? people without smartphones? CDC recommends 21 days first second doses Pfizer. anyone wants follow CDC: Walgreens set second dose 21 days make sure double-check! 19 day.

And almost 20 million UK population. Yeah, small sacrifice required cover face breathe fresh air time. you’re vaccinated therefore protected you’ll ever virus, care stranger next vaccinated not? Yeah almost like vaccine become effective societal scale people it. almost like still taking precautions everybody vaccinated.....You know, like experts shrieking public since vaccines started rolling out. 

Seriously people fucking stupid. young, skinny, non-smoker, pretty aggravating seeing basically everyone else eligible. that, basically everyone know getting vaccinated anyway saying ""smoke"" even though they've probably never touched cigarette. original person you’re responding to, I’ll take crack question.

Because one month, people currently saying “why can’t *just give one month*” saying thing. 

If sort promise said - “Yes, height vaccine rollout. Yes, vulnerable protected, need give one month masks, distancing closures. But, end month, regardless happens, 100% done. mask mandates, distancing, 100% open” - would 1000% board. would wear stupid double mask 30 days, I’d stay home order groceries 30 days. would model pandemic citizen Fauci’s eyes. Unfortunately, wouldn’t happen, day 31 would calls *just wait one month*. 

I agree OP thread. specific American states, it’s time start process opening. Texas style 100% open - it’s time start process. vulnerable US protected. bet ass are. get second shot Tuesday 10 days I'm gonna roar like I've never roared before. children vaccinated then!? create new variants!? ones partying, ones stuck working bars restaurants? Wait, written 14% offered accepted what? spot it’s ok, I’ll definitely adjust expectations. looks like people want vaccine end June/July unfortunately lost patience responsible protect irresponsible I'm nuggets saying kind stuff would happen year ago called conspiracy theorist comments got downvoted oblivion.  yet are. Dude trying cause panic reason. Walgreens scheduling Moderna Pfizer 28 days efficiency. literally millions times guarantee aren’t putting anyone risk so.

I sincerely encourage stress this. theme park? Concert venues? Unlikely, there's ticketing process.

Just note, NY testing using concert / sports venue. Presumably enter, scan ticket QR Covid QR. usually protect both. Pfizer Moderna 90% effective preventing infection all. safe effective vaccines great too! still decrease compared last week. I'm really hoping see massive increase first doses soon JNJ. leads another good question. evidence California's restrictions actually saved lives reduced hospital burden, operating assumption definitely would worse without restrictions? *losing* child’s classmate past week. Fun times. Nope, fair share covidiots also ridiculous measures. Today city allowed leave home 8 pm. Like, what's point, everything closed anyway... Let’s open Border!! Ah ok, you’ll pretty much done guess won’t make much difference. Thanks information. CDC states you’re fully vaccinated/protected 2 weeks 2nd dose. Seriously, last response I've already wasted much time nonsense. even thinking ""freedom"" contributes spread potential death others. selfish, and, yes, tell intelligent. may think 'critical thinking skills,' quoted CDC disagree do. like Bible thumper picks chooses follow Bible tells others they're wrong interpretation. Again, people like think something worthwhile say running country ground. wish social media IQ test could post anything Tweet's length. That's huge. lot natural infection. One dose gives incredible amount protection. Excellent comment. imagine least one American tourist unironically said ""I'm American, know rights!"" US laws trump local laws nations Americans visit.

Sigh. We've met. I'm vaccines all, I'm fan forced coerced getting vaccine even authorized full normal use yet.  digital passport thing seems bit dystopian/invasion privacy well. slippery slope. say edited it, that’s you. Lol

Surprise surprise 🙄 Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Just there's infection mean need take vaccine body.

If taking vaccine, go it. 
But shovel not. 

It's like vaxxers become religious cult proselytizing atheists taking jabs MSMs talked goodness religion bashing atheism.

Sure you’d like convince whatever companies ship USA break contracts. pharmacy tech approach shoppers ask announcement store loudspeaker? “We sale Hamburger Helper also, care vaccination?” wear masks forever? Lol k. Yeah laws break exactly?

They're acting unethically like laws anti vax. actually multitude laws protecting right. around 1000 deaths day so? Actually whole point vaccines wouldn’t die got sick.... think actual studies ""PA mask lot cases, TX mask cases"" show mask mandates effect, reduce cases &lt;10%, easily concealed effects things. can't wait 'til pandemic becomes bad memory. I'm sick reading deaths, feelings hopelessness. Unless you’re Brazil, also article work done universal coronavirus vaccine?

Like Covid, coronsviruses - SARS, cold, Covid, whatever strain either

That would game changer Lockdowns significantly reduce deaths though.  - paved way even faster EUA variants already looking booster shots major vaccine manufacturers. way.  NY lot weird criteria may let in. sure look list times takes 2 weeks first shot start working. incubation period, someone could catch test positive 20 days shot. much rule 34, little time EU also gets much much less doses ordered AZ. AZ proportional preferring one country violation EU AZ contract assured EU contract conflict order. see morale reason force AZ fulfill contract. AZ able produce doses everybody ordered.

If come government rule shops stock way cheaper.
Like Germany enforced nearly nowhere found except odd shop overly expensive. 

After government ruling ffp2/ kn95 masks shops stocked starting 1 euro per mask atm 88 cent probably go lower time. 

 


I would pay around 3-7 euro per mask online yeah... Online simply expensive.

Way many young people died COVID.

Thanks lack health insurance, many didn’t even know comorbidities late helped get number high relative countries. People US assumed younger made immune. i'd suspect even california high number vaccinated july 4th means first dose june 4th. knocked 5 million first doses month let's conservatively add 5 million april, may june get 26 million 2nd doses july 4th....that's plenty open Important many Brazilian unemployment fiscal measures expired haven’t renewed lot people go back work it’s tragedy shocking people ones getting sick. believe fake media 

Most people stopped believing fox news long time ago.  Cdc said safe see vaccinated people. thing never end. We'll stuck virus ages idiots like this. Keep checking site(s). Friends end April appointments able move new appointments become available pretty easy. Walgreens,krogers, walmart. state run sites many. doctors.

As long includes coaches support staff exactly happen. suggesting Obama instituted lockdowns H1N1? Geez, Republicans think lockdowns excessive pandemic killed 500,000 people (\_with\_ lockdowns), wonder would said swine flu, resulted \~12,000 US deaths.

I think got pretty tough job want make case Obama ""dropped ball"" H1N1, particularly relative COVID-19. Well shit. guess forgot Germany center Europe goods transported land touch German soil point. aren’t island authoritarian country. want live life plenty options. reading correlation 

A woman healthcare

B level education

So essentially, education likely get vaccine less education Dunning-Kruger effect takes place think know everybody else avoid taking vaccine something like that. One hospital 100% female doctors take like 70% nurses 30% medical assistants took it.

Weird woman much again, ones worried fertility typical guy. OK, let's get back normal - masks on. There's really good argument wearing masks allows us get back normal continuing prevent infection amongst us.

However, reasoning rather flawed.. think we're close higher risk people vaccinated, though. Obesity significant risk factor, 40% adults obese.

Waiting longer make less severe - we're vaccinating millions people every day. That's millions people protected every single day. That's good reason stay home. you, I'm going wait.

And lastly, new studies showing vaccines (Moderna pfizer, least) protect disease also prevent spreading others. great news means actually help keep people getting sick. keep it. Worth noting Brazil’s health public health infrastructure, European level, joke this. It’s absolutely humanitarian crisis right now. There's big difference proving vaccinated enroll school showing ""papers"" piece security-guard human filth every time walk business scan ID. enough businesses this, would enable warrantless government database people's locations ... app needs disabled COVID hospitalizations deaths fall acceptable level (it never entirely zero). Nah got wrong friend. got lockdown case rates control mid December due UK variant vaccines even approved. UK early March using Pfizer AZ roughly half half. Since 8th, govt locked us long ass lockdown road map every relaxation 5 weeks apart. makes sense it’s tough. worried P1 variant? first June knowingly used extreme example sounded like arguing vaccines real side effects.

Who over-emphasizing extreme side effects COVID vaccine? Me? people forum—myself included—just say headache/fever/chills/arm pain sucked, it’s worth it. (And yes, know you’ve already argued it’s impossible get fever this, information sheet given nurse vaccine even said people experience fever.)

Personally, experienced symptoms beyond arm pain. doubt people *can* experience psychosomatic symptoms. trust vaccine makers monitor effects control group people get shot trials. I’m confused. studies coming Israel say exact opposite. 

Is sort Israeli propaganda? Ignorant conspiracies written incoherently. smoking borh vaccinated. CDC already said safe visit vaccinated people. Except he’s never said vaccine doesn’t work.

You’re making things up. Yepppers. agree completely. say like 2 months. End May first June. thoughts (as huge live music festival guy) see lot outdoor events summer, return full scale events like festivals indoors shows starting around Labor Day. Maybe lots smaller bands get indoor shows booked summer. issue restrictions, logistics. takes plan tour, bigger acts, takes even longer produce &amp; rehearse show. startling number nursing school classmates anti vax anti science. money job security. Brazil never big COVID threat U.S. lmao civil war. It’s mask, minor effort save people’s lives. anger much? 1,000 people dying every day still, matter much inconveniences you. surge also show case numbers immediately either. agree relevance, ""money bank"" depend on. going, going there, aren’t men joining them? 100% happening atleast 50% country like first one said 100 days mask mandates reduced cases 2%. think means work think proves don't.

"" Mandating masks associated decrease daily COVID-19 case death growth rates within 20 days implementation. comprehension problem appears.

Edit: Probably confusing part study on-premise dining:

"" Allowing on-premises restaurant dining associated increase daily COVID-19 case growth rates 41–100 days implementation increase daily death growth rates 61–100 days implementation. ""

Makes sense one understands lifting restrictions necessarily result restaurants immediately opening indoor dining patrons rushing back right away. want gyms open already rate cases texas directly proportional lack testing.

Dont listen youre vaccinated good time.  remember still spread covid unvaccinated people.  Enjoy visits!

That’s birthday too! state going open ages day well, pushed 4/1! Ooo, that's good news! link? New York City far “reopening.” Indoor dining barely thing. people say things “packed,” referring outdoor dining.

Target back, risk getting shot something?

As ardent supporter going back normal, call fellow lockdown skeptics, anti-maskers, similar folks commit violence business, condemn unequivocal possible terms anyone so.

That said, state lifts mandate, personally plan vote wallet avoid businesses much possible.  there's next round vaccines needs even quicker approval first. Whole comment basically cherry-picked set falsities, half-truths noticeable difference Canada United States extent Canada noticeably lower population density

So understand population density. Good start. Somehow failed mention comparison death rates still lower multiple ""serious"" states mostly indistinguishable bulk rate South Dakotas 28% higher national average. Dakotas far lower population density national average, comparable Canada 3 times fatality rate Dakotas fact higher fatality rate U.S. average despite 9 times lower population density. Remarkable achievement.

Trump said nasty things people spoke him. guess see ton incentives - though could wrong restart flights competition airlines.

Brazil registered nearly 12.5 million cases since pandemic began, official death toll risen 310,550, according ministry data. Brazil catching us. exactly going there? much worse now? ANYONE getting vaccine there? problem masks. Even mandate lifted really changed much yet. comment pointing eventually need get back normal waiting longer necessarily make situation less severe now. Even vaccines still get sick, mainly helpful reducing hospitalizations dying. people higher risk two outcomes already vaccinated. Oh BIRX said it....🤨

HIV herpes? Leprosy? people really want go road? I’m way likely patronize business check vaccination Yeah.. allowed covid spread much flu number would multiple times higher. What's point? Florida: Working Urgent Care Center, solidly say people are:

1. Letting guard down. cannot tell feeling seeing two elderly women, trying talk one another. Unable hear other, pulled cloth masks leaned closer speak. @#!&amp;??!!

2. Deniers force primary care doctors prescribe antibiotics steroids pain reporting insurance whomever - congregate public unmasked ""I COVID, sore throat,""... Six weeks later arrive clinic asking ""Something stronger."" want test? No. provider convince them? 50/50. 

3. Antimaskers 20% rate here. shop unmasked unfettered despite county mask mandate shops afraid employees shot. Everyone gun carry permit here. 

4. Travel-related sickness. ""I see family Texas/Georgia/NYC/Michigan/Hawaii/Puerto Rico/Wherever. got back got call saying tested positive. entire family sick.""

5. people still unable pronounce ""Coronavirus"", know name ""COVID"". completely unaware symptoms, know wear mask, zero idea transmitted. watching news year, reading newspaper magazine, listening radio, Internet service, absolutely morbid stupidity?

Fauci knows people stretching rules. keep repeating: go without mask, travel, etc., perhaps 3 years people look back say, ""Oh, that's so-and-so died. shame never thought follow rules, tsk, tsk.""

Florida's numbers begun rise. foresee another month sheer hell hospitals, Urgent Cares, Doctor's offices, Fire Rescue, Ambulance Services schools. 

It's till over, folks. Mask up, get rid single-ply masks gators. Wear real mask. get gas stations, pharmacies grocery stores. kill. 0 chance lock again.

Wife finally appointment tomorrow morning - getting first dose Moderna :) 

It’s nice able plop date calendar madness end us. Michigan fully opened up. Restaurants 50% capacity limit masks required almost everywhere. vaccine requires three doses? typical tourists littering archeological sites trash.

Barely new vaccinations April due supply issues, greatly increasing ""fully fascinated"" population though since second doses prioritised April.

Huge difference. developed countries difference 10-20% official counts excess death counts. think Ecuador's excess deaths estimated 10X confirmed count. also important understand excess deaths mean, everyone affected got sick COVID. folks needed medical attention reach hospital due saturation COVID patients, counted excess deaths number. protocol, countries report confirmed deaths official toll pandemic, agree excess deaths give accurate picture, also take longer determine. need both.
Yeah, folks vote anything like guess. I’ve hiding information cycle weeks. I’m seeing short research tonight promising scientific studies, haven’t yet fully proven science takes time, showing fully vaccinated individuals unlikely spread virus. people loosening up.

Neither FDA vaccine developers cut trials talked several people healthcare eschewed vaccine. Many around long enough they’ve come distrust Big Pharma and/or FDA. Stopping trials early didn’t help.

So would've happened India lockdown Covid19 ravaged community? US, 500,000 killed population 300 million advanced medical help arguably richest country's infrastructre.

India billion people cramped location. many would've died Covid19 went entire population without proper care? let's real, post-covid fashion statement anything. masks going norm lot sick people public on, like they've asia now, looks like acknowledging reality simultaneously using advertise brand.

Coughed hard threw constantly.

But felt better, aka monthy coughing worse cold stopped evening temps 100 degrees, felt fatigued. Like bad. Christmas (2019) gotten smart watch wanting. would struggle go single flight stairs. heart rate like 100+ minute after. wore watch every time stood go break room 100-140bpm. 6 months later brunch (a month COVID lockdowns) brunch looked bom tracker, literally every time stood shot 140bpm bit.

I dizzy constantly. drank coffee (which high caffeine tolerance to) would feel dizzy would sit down, like bad vertigo. times vision would black standing. got use sitting slowly standing slowly. Heart rate would elevated trying go sleep too, heart randomly racing. one point raking dirt stop heart pounding, pulled phone out, 180bpm. note prior getting sick resting heart rate like 65bpm could jog half mile easily. even now, 1.5 years later still get winded walking around sometimes. never fully recovered. lungs also feel bad sometimes like smoking, congested feel breath wearing mask (still do, pretty sure affect oxygen levels).

I ton research figured POTS. know that, like article notes, commonly shows illness. Whatever bad still sffects life although mostly back normal. even COVID, exist yet. people tell stop dramatic ... No. can't go again. can't put family again.

It’s mention brazen “I’m vaccinated I’ll want.” shit people didn’t follow rules initially did, probably one same. 

Sorry coming bit heated, many dick heads around. everyone fully inoculated, hope ditch masks fall still tourists idiots current state UK probably better (fewer dead day respiratory illness) normal year single usually 3-400 something(?) flu/pneumonia deaths per day March. number also tells something small number 19 really is.

So actually support things currently forced, disagree social stigma vaccinated people relaxing private behaviors. made clear social stigma disagree with. Yes. spine call tRump — didn’t. Enabler mass murder. someone extremely cautious dumbfounded people dining indoors/going gyms right now, November really shouldn’t problem one states also exempt social security withholding then? Spread long declining way then, thanks seasonality already vaccinated individuals. Mexico whole badly. Underreported deaths. President anti mask too. response horrific.  Also dating year looking someone special too. they're going follow exactly game plan Winter Surge: they'll literally wait ICU's overcapacity reinstating masking orders shutting indoor venues. Even case numbers surging expect hospitals get slammed like vast majority seniors vaccinated. Hopefully overweight &amp; diabetic GenXers use sense take precautions they're still vulnerable get shots. side effects wanna read day get J&amp;J shot!! Excited get vaccinated nervous side effects. immunity covid without vaccine limited last much past 3 8 months.

There's difference immunity reinfection immune response. again, immune system binary. Find hospitalization rates fatality rates reinfection. I'll level younger people getting hospitalized serious covid symptoms much higher variants.

This worth watching, would bet real money either vaccinated covid already ending hospital aside extend edge cases, always exist dealing large numbers. Anecdotes useful applied large populations.

Studies coming one another showing crossover immune response variants much higher expected. data blowing estimates water.

Everyone high risk opportunity vaccinated point, come Wednesday, everyone able area.

People different points lives much comfortable living way last year. assume everyone much longer.  mRNA vaccine, hopefully efficacy Pfizer. one outside EU bought though. overall risk society whole stays though. According excess death studies, transparent US weekend, figures unquestionably true daily average (although also way better previous Sunday since basically last summer). 

With prevalence 1 400, fact anyone hospitalised would tested routinely, probably say 3/400 deaths, 12 per day, would happen within 28 days positive test. 

Once seven-day average hits that, say Covid fatalities essentially impact public health, depending course many cases community time. weird? Everyone knows vaccines take time reach full effectiveness. nuts upset want follow CDC guidelines?..

Bizarre. Thanks reposting correct link. Quoting LOGH

*What cowardly shameful thing human conduct? people power, people flatter hide safe places extol war, force patriotism self-sacrifice others, send battlefield die. * talking last feb/march ""wuhan"" strain ""italy"" strain. seen assigned varient numbers though see ones dominant today Side note, updog also works surprisingly well topical treatment.

So hopefully send letters healthy 50 civilians end April get 3 categories lot. fear time receive letters, they’ll already able go pub won’t much incentive. However looks like nightclubs (which won’t open til late June earliest) strict vaccines knows). 520 million doses small number single dose

Small *so* small. around 12% total Q2 deliveries. people care topics/subjects mainstream media tells care. one cared wearing masks actively taking precautions others pre 2020. Even early COVID, people wear masks gloves videos coming China people falling middle roads stores. Shrinks raking business.  even figured re-enfranchise lost birth certificates vote every november everyone family multiple vacations throughout entire pandemic. think I’m nuts taking precautions. Yep. thing ACTUAL lockdown... half hearted measures.

Flying already sucks ass enough TSA probing ass, charged $7 Snickers bar, crammed seat designed people 5'6"". I'd prefer roll accept another random middle finger airlines.

I also like overall messaging normalizes mask mandates permanent aspect society. like idea masks mandated anywhere we're longer pandemic, implies mandating ""necessary"" absolutely not. need people digiital passport feel safe public. quite ok going public event without knowing everyone's covid vaccine status. new variants seven times deadly young people, data keeps getting worse. Read news.

Appeal emotion? standard ethics we're talking about. Saying a-ok viral spread among youth ""not big deal, trust me"" plain stupid, made fact know little nothing long-term effects. Wasn’t trying say problem exclusive Italy. problem plaguing nursing profession general. Definitely good idea, need panic! Again, ideal, still. was. Thx. really need account anything imo. Excess deaths bad, matter what. Oh now, go play traffic next door dash delivery Mask deniers undergo open heart surgery mask free operating room.

Since respect others, seems fair me. right party public beach spread deadly disease important public’s right safe imbeciles can’t understand simple virology. Well original issue brand, certified brands. respirators linked certified Chinese agencies GB2626-2006 model. Yea do. order foot quarantine hotel bills plus multiple PCR tests (each $150 $200) included $2000 (additional charges add people like children example.) cost said hotels. charge little less slap big unannounced additional charges top that. Plus needing find pay second hotel quarantine half additional 2 weeks (roughly $100/night) home bathroom amd bedroom isolate with. top $1200 plane ticket round trip including health insurance stay (normal stuff). also live right area government sanctioned follow PCR tests need taken home submitted mail, quarantine cannot leave quarantine location... live right place makes delivering tests challenge. Especially time sensitive. fail above, including getting tests time face $750,000 and/or jail time...

You need afford it. schools reopen tada look 3rd wave. ever could seen coming.... got pulled wifes grandmother fiat 600 gave license Florida goes ""ah floooriidaa bella, ciao"" speak little bit wife phone ready translate lol. loved there, likely retire looks like counting 3 million doses first doses mixture 1st second doses. want say current rate first doses little 1.6 million day.

You keep saying ""regular"". ""regular"" people ""irregular"" people, here? seem saying certain age (55? 65?) ""not regular""? Xi Jinping. would probably win plurality. first past post voting he'd world president.  know breakthrough case is. 

But data coming Israel clear. Pfizer vaccine stops transmission. It’s either conspiracy they’re posting fake data, statement inaccurate vaccine actually stops transmission. two possibilities. Didn‘t country (the same?) find covid traces waste water samples march 2019? happened that? can't get people use cloth mask way would good number people wear n95 Please link peer reviewed study! COVID exists, ive never met somebody whos denied that. Remember, almost every single person died ""with covid"" died life-ending problems - cancer, heart attack, forth. Show peer reviewed study links long term health effects covid! 

You wont - cant. science yet linked those. Dont science denier. They've maintained, we've busier ever, maintenance stop aircraft flying, done based time well number flights. nothing?

I don’t expect achieve anything way, power. Birx. everyone claiming Birx achieved more, apparently like Fauci did. 

But Fauci didn’t actually achieve anything. don’t know Birx expected done so. There's lot crazy misinformation vaccines there. unfortunate - category - vaccines safest, life saving, cost effective form pharmaceutical existence. 

I honestly believe lot delivery mechanism: disgust response many people needles. feel like vaccine hesitation would far lower delivery could done pill form (unfortunately cannot myriad reasons, although needle-less vaccines development). madness. 56% adults England least one vaccine. think dogmatic rollout helped.

Where am, local mosque drop sessions younger members church giving elderly people lifts get jab. understand saying. suggesting US quarantines people exposed virus? Mass could get booked. It’s going fully booked beginning Fall point, that’s we’re lucky Well good friend gonna travel Hawaii April 21st 90 million adults received shot far, increasing somewhere around 2 million day, yes 210 million adults, half shot within next 2 weeks. There's caveats though -

* vaccine takes time work. least 2 weeks time first dose got decent protection, real ""immunity"" come two weeks second dose. number people truly immunized naturally lagging way behind number doses we're administering.

* point surely lot overlap people natural immunity vaccinated people. can't add two together. 

* Almost 25% population 18 can't vaccinated, combine adults get vaccine, probably can't actually reach herd immunity US right now. Hopefully benchmark resuming normal life. 

All said, personal hope end next month, there's high level immunity vaccination infection cases finally continue dropping, maybe around 10k/day mark. maybe month that, life normal again. grandma never gave fuck. Stay bitching seeing 😂 Fucking exactly. guarantee Massachusetts vaccinating people well August point Germany following plan countries. Keep infection level manageable, i.e. many deaths, overcrowded hospitals, infection rate bearable.

The sure way manage infection rate keep contacts people low enough. different levels lockdown that. measure set % effect spread.

Different levels lockdown go vaccination level exceeds something like 70%. Vaccinations accelerate production improves. Summer may also help infection rate.

I'd accept fact lockdowns go couple months hope they're needed autumn more. Worrying things can't control going help you. said that? 

Medical experts warning people several weeks we’ll another surge. We’re nowhere near vaccinating enough population (young adults) driving new infections. That's online store Canadian company BC featured CBC report. Canada willl never subsidise N95 mask enough healthcare workers.
BTW, Chinese KN95 masks $5 $7 per piece stores. get vaccines lol. I‘d guess always exposure game like pfizer gives IgG 10000 AU/ml seems lot you‘d sit constant exposure breathing air couple hundred covid infected, immune system would surely get overwhelmed. Ofc thats speculation I‘m virologist far sight right now.

He's 80 year old man, who's working 12-16 hour days better fucking year. 

 whinging internet. ""open borders"" crowd woke racists see non-white people sex objects fast food merchants. 

It's unsurprising militant shutting international travel pandemic glutenous sex pests longer possible. even half isn’t enough neither? understand saying, one ""skipped front line"" things. players taking vaccine December January February. THey're literally taking time available ot everyone (meaning important people already got it) week 2 everyone else (and again, essential people got it).

&amp;nbsp;

I think there's big difference. virus running rampant among population, gets kills lot older people. Societies unable keep away people vulnerable spreading among everyone else. think it, explains lot.

College kids sign flocks! Access definitely issue - vaccines available, rural Mississippi may still mean hour drive get it. Many people impoverished rural towns may access reliable transportation. cities ""easy"" address issue (because density existing service infrastructure), rural poverty especially difficult deal with. 

And, end day, 20% population food insecure... worrying COVID probably high daily priority list. Even car, $12 gas may need go putting food table rather getting shot. many administered? Paywalled may lower transmission doesn’t totally stop it. Also, ppl still catch covid. Google breakthrough cases. shady way putting it, intentionally not. 

H1N1 hit, weren’t prepared it.  Luckily ended huge deal. 

The Obama administration realized weren’t prepared pandemic created team build report give us playbook, did. 

The Trump administration burned playbook. 

So SiDeS shit doesn’t play maybe knew maybe didn’t, now, guess we’ll see prefer spread truth lies this. I’ve seen several users post it’s unlikely COVID mutate point completely escapes vaccine-induced immunity mutated much would likely lose ability infect human cells, link study/expert saying (haven’t able find one)?  Instead blaming government, place blame square you, people. Reopen travel anyone vaccine card.  won’t lie? Okay. good news help stop COVID spreading. good news smell disgusting gamer breath. Useless comment, useless person. Fade sunset scarfie Help eat certainly help. huge queues every restaurant everyday day week. 

Encouraging people go sit packed restaurants (takeout drive throughs didnt qualify)was absolutely crazy proved truly clueless make decisions are.

Luckily NHS charge running vaccine program. Imagine state would government charge it. there, gotta look around move fast Texas. 4th wave? Really? hard enough spend one spring/summer indoors. Jeez walk dogs living don’t really come contact people don’t think would? Florida open months USA comparable lower death rates states lockdowns harsh restrictions. Bearing mind count deaths way nobody else except Belgium. I.e. People ever Covid dying, possibly something else. countries would higher death count likewise. 

Makes wonder would... oh, Guardian. Carry on. Would reasonable plan trip (fully vaccinated obviously) UK June? Based lockdown schedule, seems quarantine hotel thing lifted along restrictions museums, hospitality, etc. Quick question: come Subreddit say things like people take shit seriously? Yeah, things like want go business? self taught epidemiologist listen experts? Late April May going critical month going watch come flying mean flat admitted Top Gear years ago. Would continue wear masks stores, transport, etc social distance public? figure that? I'm paranoid. know paranoid.

That person troll. yep, specially richer states São Paulo - accounted 1051 deaths today. think vaccine hesitation shockingly high *everywhere*, although places affected others. 

Getting 70% vaccinated going way harder people would ever thought. 

Republicans (especially men), minorities, young people (&lt;40) showing lower uptake we'd probably like. Women interesting getting vaccinated men, hesitancy / concerns vaccinations higher group. could women likely seek healthcare begin men. Indy 500 probably 75% capacity. 16+ year olds Indiana eligible March 31 downvotes applying basic algebra situation completely inappropriate naive.

Now I'm curious. kind math would rather use? new symptoms similar meth bath salts. Things like didnt happen Luxembourg, never went lockdown whole year already. Brazil’s latest variant killing young people higher clip before. 2,800 Brazilians 40 died Especially since lot people aren’t local. live Florida drive beach that’s pretty safe. fly state, party several days fly back without taking covid test potentially exposing people airport. It’s kinda like, “Oh, think I’m selfish? Well fuck it, I’m gonna selfish asshole help greater good,” lmaooo.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes that’s excellent point. I’d prefer publicly funded campaigns, public healthcare, higher min wage better protections workers form two year contracts, min 401k match 50% mandatory sick leave, etc. Basically bring union benefits all. Read wrote.... said politicized vaccine. Harris, Newsom, Cuomo certainly did. put words mouth. believe way politicized beginning affected opinions absurd. absolutely culpability. Trump admin favor vaccination beginning. politicians media left absolutely tried make sound like admin wasn’t going thorough job didn’t best interests Americans heart. even goes vacation pandemic Remember came roaring twenties......................... Except utter nonsense.

The UK gets Pfizer doses within EU, Astrazenica. Nurses make decent money high demand.  I’ve probably gone two three bottles Artnaturals last 10 months. beyond upsetting. lmao even $500 HUGE earn live $5 less day can’t save live band mouth. ya know like many people living extreme poverty around Asia Africa ok America 👍🏻 even open borders then? know American tourists come listen rules. We’ve seen entire fucking time. It’s fault even letting tourists in. hits close home me. used feel comforted surrounded big groups people time. I've spent entire year avoiding thing used comfort total fear it. weird, psychological thing recover from, something used bring comfort turning something induces fear. Life expectancy India 69 years.

Yeah. infant mortality rate 5 times higher US.

There 10 million people aged 80 India, number US. “a fourth wave could look different country previously experienced, characterized fewer hospitalizations deaths, according experts.”

“With rapid dissemination vaccines, increases cases among healthy populations necessarily translate hospitalizations deaths previously seen pandemic.""

“However, experts say many at-risk Americans dosed, potential wave may lethal significant previous ones.”

“Even fourth wave ""likely,"" Sehgal said, ""I think anywhere near magnitude wave like saw winter holidays, deadly.""

Good. Fewer hospitalizations deaths. Maintain protect hospital capacity it’s available people need it, we’re good shape. Don’t panic “cases!!!1!” - raw case numbers mean even less less at-risk vaccinated.

“No one ever get sick” isn’t goal, reasonable. can

Nope. Can't. case I'm - get vaccinated ASAP. Zero reason moral superiority putting vaccination crazy variants spreading. pay all....  Fosun distributor. produce mRNA vaccine BioNTech Good thing America world record infections. Florida basically restrictions fine. entitled a-holes think visiting theme park whatever want actual foreign country laws, etc. basically ""The Ugly Americans, Covid Edition"". 

These folks who, pandemic, would gotten pissed Mexican food Mexico like Taco Bell... Blimey ratio 18,000 1, even normal medical attention must difficult let alone this. points blatantly obvious anyone think. pretty pedantic argue ""the less cases better"", paint call strict lockdowns 66% UK vaccines came EU, know there's export certs attached. 

Now India restricting AstraZeneca contracts UK, going tell they're Indian exports? affect everyone differently. first Pfizer shot sore arm, headache, chills, muscle pain, bit nausea fatigue lasted 18 hours.

I apprehensive 2nd Pfizer shot. got sore arm comparable flu shot. mother's 2nd shot symptoms also milder. concert study 5,000 people registered participated it, testing, follow researchers, good thing. study results help save lives well shape policies many countries, apply multiple crowded situations, airports school assemblies, concerts. 

I agree vaccines best, learning ways protect people countries able vaccinate fully also good. reporting error, Israel really 0 new cases? said country it. said 1.41 mil reported cases 147 mil population............ realize viruses stop borders, correct? Florida never really locked healthcare system collapse. right? Compare numbers states harsh restrictions fewer restrictions numbers really show much benefit any. never said need stay locked lol. saying cases matter unless leads hospitalizations. Well, is.

Yeah, maybe go back re-read exchange commenting it. guy saying ""the less cases are, better,"" explaining oversimplification. Obviously cases lead increase hospitalizations, silly pretend scale equally younger demographics older, high-risk groups vaccinated steady pace. Well, case NY variant, there's evidence vaccine resistant, evidence not. probably, wait vaccine widespread. Woohoo 0 exported EU. exported companies factories continental Europe we’re paid countries set production quickly possible.

Had countries known EU would try steal vaccines I’m sure would made arrangements.

Look get it. narrative you’ve spinning 5 years UKpolitics fallen apart don’t want admit it.

No way we're herd immunity (meaning, many people immune virus can't spread) end Spring. Even got 70% vaccinated (which would stretch based expected pace), that's enough accomplish something looks like herd immunity. Honestly, I'm sure ever get something looks like herd immunity - cases lower, think ever going effectively zero non-transmissible (as case something like me, don’t care there’s still limited capacity baseball game long go. don’t care mask inside restaurant long go. want able see parents without wear mask. that’s idea “done” point. don’t need mosh pit signal end pandemic.

I care. moshing days well beyond me, I'd still like able go concert opera ballet performance. sad? saying necessarily good idea, people like concerts bars, really issue people would want return them? depends long first system first states’ rules are. might straight lose money weren’t system long enough vested may eligible payout contributions (or may eligible receive tiny pension). varies depending state. 🤷🏻‍♂️ expected AZ fucked massive scale. Pfizer delivered promised new type vaccine much higher demands storage. People typing shit Reddit ""serious situation?"" Lol would put 2nd worldwide... Brazil &amp; Russia officially update actual numbers. Probably ridiculous take. Yes, still wear mask majority people get vaccinated, intents purposes, pandemic gotten vaccinated. considered.. know.. road tripping country height pandemic vaccines weeks months away? live tourist town (PDC) say 95% “maskless” idiots ruining everything everyone gringos. 5% markets Cancun. really need account anything imo.

If ignore tens thousands deaths flu COVID restrictions incidentally prevented, under-reporting COVID deaths significant amount. Got mine midday Friday (felt nothing first shot) whole night fever, chills, vomiting. Saturday felt like bus hit super tired. Back 100% today - push through! really. lockdown sufficient stop original variant enough stop spread UK variant joined mix. That's saw original variant r number 1 UK variant significantly above.

If want lockdown works UK variant look UK December/January (especially Christmas). fucked lot stuff UK committ lockdown successfully brough UK variants r number 0.7-0.9. countries need follow want bring case numbers mean, private businesses contracting time - donate money candidates help get elected turn around lobby for/enter negotiations contracts public works projects, outsourcing stuff (call centers, manufacturing), etc. Probably won’t worry culture places ready get back normal already “trying” to. first March 2020 felt like whole world United stomping virus month later entered state “do please”. Sidelines began drawn mindsets formed. 

The Joe Rogan MMA episode usuals May turned trashing California’s Covid response pinnacle acknowledging public done Covid restrictions form simply due governments ran things. cases governors sides saying one thing another didn’t help. Trump’s response also didn’t help. Part really hoped bad case could still survive show virus nothing play with. Instead vehicle tours around hospital recovering keep image reassure supporters virus still joke.

With everything opening again, still feels like we’re “fend yourself” attitude, feels bit better vaccine help fending lot. parliamentarians made criminal complaint international court. know bring results seems analyzing it. many areas US, people still idiots. would think 500,000 deaths would take seriously, many don't. scheduled vaccine later next month still wearing mask, handwashing staying away large crowds. makes sense. get people it, last pandemic. 

If look large companies depending highly skilled workers preparing long term making drastic changes processes environment. know really care us personally care bottom line profit need highly skilled workers. Christ. quote NY Times:

""Vaccinated People Get Covid, It’s Likely Rare""

Stop spreading nonsense. Shit like makes less likely people get vaccinated first place. Thank agreeing point contradicting guess? guess it’s 100% settled science...

People 30s 40s aren’t eligible vaccine many states going ones getting sick. like hundreds day admitted, like 65+ group. less 40. degree, Swedes Nordics generally always follow government advice high trust them. they're told five people over, maintain social distance, etc nearly follow them. can't said countries, especially Brazil. sorry interjecting serious situation fucking experience. Can't pesky facts get way beliefs hey? Another good reason remain masked need maintain normalization masks least herd immunity reached. vaccinated stop wearing masks, might push not-yet-vaccinated people fence masks masking non-masking. one tell vaccinated, wearing mask great role-modelling! forget, still individual risk.

Says who? Reddit? hospitals coping, people make judgments level risk acceptable, everyone else same. I’m sorry don’t understand exponential growth.

We cases deal negative aspects lockdown public policy.

We couldn’t covid. Avoiding something like 1918 collapsed medical system saved tens millions 100 million lives. Ask doctor I’d prepared “no”.

The general rule avoid getting shots within 2 weeks short-term illness. could make vaccine bit less effective.  There’s hard evidence either way (it’s difficult study, find 1000’s people shingles plus vaccine plus exposure covid).  doctors tend go cautious route suggest delay. Happy hand revived mine. got Pfizer first 10 days ago now. I’ll getting second one days Easter. end April I’ll fully done finally.

More people crippled poverty help specific party one fighting continue restrictions. they’re saying covid 5.7 R0 normal behavior. 

Even without mandates, doesn’t mean behavior hasn’t hugely changed. Big events still largely shut down, less travel, lots people working home, much population masking, etc.

All lower R0 quite bit, even local state government stupid. shocked face.  tell pandemic essentially controlled China travelers China test positive COVID significant rate.  Leronlimab take long hualers ""And people dont understand eithter students still living parents (or live University home) people never lost job home office""

False. face face teacher district avoiding true responsibility safety colleagues students pretty much entire pandemic. seen fellow teachers students get incredibly sick nearly die. seen die. Kids come parent funerals. new case every day.

Yea. Trade me. shit terrifying miserable vomit stress mornings, sunk severe depression constant stress.

I would gladly take spot; lived poverty before... preferable fear live now. stay students... want least give stability year. would quit announced normal, maskless lunches students Trump didnt shit white right leaning jackass. This...it depends states. Louisiana many driving Mississippi first. vaccine program open everyone. Huge selection dates ever vaccine want. way soon states. Mexican branches family, least two every branch died COVID. Double ICU capacity heh.
Sweden put extra tents hardly used.
Sweden's ICU kneeling 99% December. Reaching 99% mean ""just made it"". means triage effect people denied intensive care units Swedish capital region Stockholm reached 99 percent capacity Tuesday first time coronavirus pandemic, region's head healthcare called Stockholmers follow recommendations strictly. Also Greece locked since months. open bars, restaurants, etc economy collapse thier ICU's capacity still low daily new cases high.

Lockdowns efrective. UK started stock pilling Pzifer since early March month refuse battle wits unarmed person. countries let pandemic get epic proportions first place. punished arguably handled pandemic best? also helping pacific nations like Papua New Guinea pacific islands. countries really need work together. supply Moderna basically non-existent. clear beginning part contracts.

So nobody really cares. Yes. understand real world data is? Cases dropped. Sweden lower rates 2020 compared several EU counterparts. North vs South Dakota differing mandates masks, case rates.

Follow data, follow science What, vaccine loneliness??? Imagine thinking preventing peoples death wearing mask imposing rights human? morons. 

Where came that? free whatever like dress whatever way see fit comfortable. bother me. respect decency people. sure hell bet heart attack cancer rely heavily people think opposing. 

The submissive argument. Found entitled white righty. good news new variations mutations chance become deadly.

That's you, wishing death people. case forgot wrote couple hour sago. Yes, correct. lost track dates... think insurrectionist suit them. Ah okay interesting. Thank insight Counts China based guesswork, like ended Wuhan lockdown, claimed hundred dead.

And shipped 40,000 funeral urns mobile crematoriums. Hi, America. fucked over, too. government's fault, former guy stabbed government back. US vaccinates everyone fhe age 16 proud it,fucked world thought Norway deaths go well? Yes, basically.
This would ideal. Trump nothing. matter UK press, German media state same. Oof. That's 1918 levels awful.

But people grasp that. understand RO is? Cows make happy I've ever looked page graphs. Seems fairly accurate compared sites... Maybe day half day makes sense. Three months, what, two doublings?

That's pretty huge backend.

Especially since day delay day closer serious vaccination. last 5 days, 0.40 per day? bought 2 could use one decontaminates, need keep buying them? solid answer, thank you. 

There still many wholes entire process. example, ok 200 people enter likes TESCO safe beautician barber operate? Yeah, no. understand vax problem vax's.
Most vax' around ages, proved work, long term side effects etc.
No one knows vax - whether suddenly discovered side effects 5 years time. Also, much lawyer represents answers bar, nurses doctors adminstrative organizations represent, licenses taken away represent poorly. can't say whatever want become RN. Wait well. officials defended pace payouts, noting takes months process cases individuals families need submit documents, including medical records, support claims. first case, filed September, alleged injury convalescent plasma agency still needed medical records, HRSA Director Communications Martin Kramer said email. Exactly! That’s distribute vax equally, prevent Hotspots create new variants. UK know it, variant extremely dominant Germany example. Shouldn’t happen again, might resistant time I’ve data locations worldwide past year I’m seeing trends like all, give example? Aside initial wave explosion explained pretty handily fact nobody really tested April despite spread since November 2019, trends followed expected patterns Tell R0 means, continue conversation.

If course looking up, grasp getting, would genuinely excellent. Oof dumb one denying right. Prioritizing point here. Australia New Zealand need right rich, yeah. Sexual. failing deliver 100 mil doses nothing it?

No expected new vaccine new production line. EU bought 2.3 bio doses population less 500mio.
See want pay full price went cheap countries outbid us reason vaccinated 1/3 population compared UK 1/10 compared Isreal. Novavax also soon, lovely. Especially it’ll made domestically well. assuming way data reported across countries. tell mom, lives another European country, shocked going test sore throat. country test hospital serious clear symptoms, like loss smell/taste fever. mean likely poorer countries less testing wealthy ones using example. I'd expect people ending hospitals dying tested similar rates, general population.

I imagine happens even poorer countries without infrastructure proper tests except bigger centers.

My point is: idea situation really besides countries resources rigorous testing. Freedumbs! Nah, still belive you. argument must extensively definite parameters assertion irrelevant cheap debate strategy attempt invalidate points. Put simply ""large"" long, hard close borders, ""populated"" high population density. exact numbers anything pandemic going necessary define terms absolute specifics. US thought would best prevent spread failed. almost every country pre-existing benefit unrelated lockdown procedures. I'm making assertion restrictions prevent spread covid set bad precedents government mandates. repercussions still unknown. easy way insurance companies track lifestyle choices adjust rates accordingly.

Well probably run government sunset clause written law, I'm worried. 

We require proof vaccinations. see what's wrong also one. Less half African countries even death registry systems, probably never know true number recently went doctor tested flu. also flu 2018 tested well. seems don’t know flu tests exist odd reason It’s rare. benefits vaccine outweigh risk rare side effect happening you. probably right friend. excuse get 15 car line McDonald’s drive thru there’s clearly single person line inside. kid grandma last week. teacher receptionist cried. 

We thankful vaccinated. issue at-risk group, virus spreads, higher chances creating new (possibly worse) variant. thought experiment, let's use results estimate might happen hypothetical Challenge Trial. 

Say try infect ~10,000 vaccinated people. ~1,000 become infected. 

Of infected, ~100 hospitalized. 

Of hospitalized, ~10 become severe critical hospitalizations. 

Of severe hospitalizations, ~1 patient die. 

Including people co-morbidities, fully vaccinated person 1:10,000 chance dying Covid-19? (If co-morbidities, chances probably better.) 

I ignore Asymptomatic cases none need hospitalized.

This seems incredible, maybe I'm misinterpreting results. Ya, invite hundred people house pandemic, knowing full well aren’t going wear masks, it’s fault get covid. Grow up. Well, read experts say vote comment disparage point does. like told cover face, COVID. like surrounded faceless people, put COVID. ""weird"" want see smiling faces again. need justify treated like I'm crazy feeling way I'm absolutely person feels way. vaccines available everyone wants one, want keep living like this. Um, yes? Comparing influenza COVID-19 like comparing apples oranges though, that's really fair, we've almost 500 years experience influenza pandemics know much need know responsibly say death rate acceptable. know long-terms effects, impacts health issues, affects different age groups, limits damage do, etc. also predict frequently new strains develop prepare ahead time.

But COVID-19 different story. mutating faster aggresively anyone anticipated. Canada, susceptible harder time getting population vaccinated general. variants B.C. right entire United States, example.

So I'm saying is, maybe time everywhere, based locality, based history (ie. poor response provinces since beginning), based lack info have, based timeline mass vaccination think irresponsible send kids blindly viral fray hold back months vaccine ready them.

""Muge Cevik, virologist physician University St. Andrews Scotland, told “many things worry — outdoor brief contact one  Nope. 

What learned it’s people 70 needed protection. 

Mass lockdowns everyone didn’t much stop death rate COVID still spread nursing homes. 

What see 3 years excess deaths time period. 19 deaths per day terrible, it? amazing would completely normal. 7 day rolling average risen past week, 30 rolling average pretty much stagnant, older people vaccinated, no. case it’s 100% younger people getting infected. number young people staying constant, subtracting older people case rates, overall case rates would falling, they’re not, so: younger people getting infected literally week two they’ll start getting vaccinated. Like idiots. Yucatán month February saw someone wearing mask almost guaranteed Mexican. Tulum worst. Hardly tourists wore masks. heard stories getting infected every days. felt bad Mexican people. Ahaha get real idiot. even close similar situations Yeah, people need understand distinction ""religion"" ""culture"". related may be, they're thing. Awesome that’s reassuring! Give source based export certs proves UK received one AstraZeneca dose produced within EU then.

Edit add, India restricting AstraZeneca supplies UK? please enlightenment rationale buying excess 1.5bn vaccines problems expected.

I sure got idea issues deliveries pfizer french sanofi gsk vaccine hasnt worked well either. don’t think nurses anyone allowed smoke inside hospitals patients. Dude completely underestimate Americans' addiction stuffing gullet huge portions restaurant number taken literally, Notice quantifier ""even"". taken lower value sake argument. Actual CFR needs studied years may still unclear due difficulty calculating mild cases. overthink it. trouble finding data it, tell rare is. also possible players refused get vaccine. follow professional league closely theres media certain players wanting vaccine. quiet, exists. UK cases going 37.5k positive cases 8.4 million tests last week; positive rate 0.5%. Doesn’t seem like that’s accomplishing much, seeing numbers there. discussion allowed without PhD? 

I honestly can't tell serious, joking, trolling.

This bizarre. That’s interesting twist happened fresh minds. /s. know fly there. get used atm easier find appointment. switched appointment 3 times earlier conveniant appointments opened up. general population green lit, I'm sure tough find jabs certainly run people willing get shot downstate higher % uneducated, highly religious, rural, conservatives, contributes vaccine skepticism. Yes course will. People seem believe there's going massive conspiracy ends keeping place though. matters number deaths, number covid deaths. Fewer flu deaths means fewer deaths, good. need factor out. Selfish assholes wear masks bus, that's different story. claimed original story. Nope, it’s tourists fault. logic, it’s woman’s fault getting raped allowed happen. understand downvotes... There's science support increased transmission rates outdoors. I'm saying people wear masks break rules, damn... Stop fear mongering. test influenza.

Easy correction silly misunderstanding. low while. NYC variant making rounds, counties connected city cases. course people there, theres lot people moving around going city. expect that, exactly? Tell government gain keeping place. say ""variants"" ""fear-mongering"", explain they'd gaining first place. going Cancun, five hour bus ride enclosed space strangers. Covid anyone? 

People fucking stupid. birthday (pre-pandemic), folks around there's gifts cake eat, cry death around corner. 

Chill. reason celebrate over. ok. Victim blaming? Nice. Im curious, perhaps don’t know believe Pfizer testing variant specific boosters third shot existing vaccine. know trial in/what you’d getting? Ted Cruz think really, really young population high proportion people already got infected. Also scepticism towards vaccine always spot journalist who’s never stepped foot typical American public school. Actually really nearby cities site, small areas accommodate tourism. people visit places like Cancun, PDC, Cozumel, etc. majority go sitting packed buses hours, stopping crowded stands selling souvenirs, eating packed places too. contradicts literally every source.

Perhaps getting mixed Pfizer. change certain... Leadership... that. H1N(202)1.... soon? right here. wasn’t 48 hours ago Hawaii complaining thing visitors acting poorly etc etc.

News flash: see tourists right now, pandemic, likely crappiest bunch humans location. Let’s real, it’s selfish dillholes vacationing right now, without normal “mix” good bad tourists, it’s much obvious trashy right now. Hope news, Sun fire! Loss smell taste pretty big one never recovers pretty large loss quality life, mention safety hazard use smells signal sorts important things like “there natural gas leak near by” First problem ""assuming IFR 0.6"". [The CDC bunch alone incredibly simplistic view. entire series calculations offset error there, there's zero nuance using single number. Mexico different place demographically economically Canada. Japanese people tend older countries. Ya dig? 0.6 part bullshit.

So, ""kind"" math, something takes nuance account? types using high school math try downplay pandemic entire time, gets old. Real world data always varies trial data. Real world data Israel incredibly promising Pfizer. one’s working great stands reason others will, too, since target spike protein sequences. could, could not. draw large similarities past multitude small differences propel us number different directions. hope so. People starting get little comfortable wearing masks couple weeks already. That's perfectly fine. specifically activities remained closed wearing mask enough. Think sports, broadway, concerts, etc.

If want go park restaurant (or anything else currently open NY right now), need worry this. Mexican president shown meant ward virus, lying stealing helps avoid infection. went around mask constantly venerated large portion population (including many uneducated people look set example). kept border open consistently downplayed pandemic, shaking hands everyone contracting COVID. hundreds thousands Mexicans died, ruin closes tourists wearing masks? Seems like definition token effort me.

Your downvotes came people blame tourists side government seems implementing sensible measure. tourists morons measure sensible, definition token effort, wrong. pretty dumb 

In likelihood initial vaccine drive won’t see kinds restrictions deaths hospitalizations largely controlled. point getting updated vaccine mean putting risk, can’t see you’d want someone taught full time 5 days week since August, I'm baffled we're still talking opening schools. bother you? post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

What's point starting war nobody actually win, better countries work diplomatically accomplish peace, longer win, nobody win, presumed loser nuke country last-ditch effort, boom, countries void life.

&amp;#x200B;

I seriously think large-scale world war happen anytime soon. fact CDC longer recommends asymptomatic vaccinated people get tested enough consider vaccine end. I'll wear mask public everyone chance get vaccinated, (and majority people subreddit, looks things,) personal concerns left personally getting spreading covid vaccinated people. judge people personally choosing cautious longer, get force rest us vaccine. Oh sorry, must made mistake. bad. 14 months? anyone data many cases ITP (**Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura** ) occurred covid vaccine natural covid infection? aztrazeneca vaccine scrutiny lately? I'm getting Pfizer shot tomorrow trying calm nerves condition, even though know rare. No. Personally realized didn’t need go eat often “something do” weekend. think many adopt “save money, cook home hang home” often pandemic. asked you’re getting downvotes. That’s downvoted comment. argue day long, using terms like “fair chunk” makes look even less informed.

I not. another person. almost trying distract people something. I’m anti-mask all. I’m dentist wear every day practice. 

I’m anti-government. such, I’m government forcing people wear masks. Uncle Sam’s massive package taste mouth? Keep choking like good little servant are. say anywhere seeing friends family good idea 🙄 Even CDC saying fine. said think cautious going crowded places bad idea. saying you, nothing wrong others cautious 🙄 Kids wear masks pretty good it. Parents make choice.... Usually three six years, [according Absolutely yes. 

At least, July 4th gonna lit US never real lockdown. maybe two weeks California people took seriously.

After Home Depot such. 

It probably helped large indoor gatherings. Masks helped also. 

But never actual “Vietnam style” lockdown. reason worry public health measures existed vaccine trials impact efficacy rates, vaccines hold efficacy numbers restrictions lifted? something controlled somehow? exactly point, India often removed models discussing asia reviewed own. compare india literally every country category, india's numbers look great. one feeling kind hopeless masks social distancing guidelines good certain environments? see places like concerts bars removing restrictions pretty much fast possible affects bottom line, hospitals, airports, government buildings worry that. people using services get choices. long federal government CDC specifically recommend removing guidelines, they'll stay, can't see CDC ever removing guidelines long COVID exists new variant pops every day.

Someone please tell I'm pessimistic. U.S. vaccination campaign accelerating rapidly, 91 million people — roughly third adult population — received least one shot Covid-19 vaccination Saturday. nearly every state announced meet President Biden’s directive make adults eligible May Saturday afternoon, two states — Arkansas New York — still declared timeline residents, according New York Times vaccine rollout third state, Wyoming, also said adults would able get shot, eligibility state expands county-by-county basis, spokeswoman state’s Department Health said, 20 state’s 23 counties allow adults get vaccinated. said expected full access “quite Arkansas, Times database shows 13 percent population three million fully vaccinated, Gov. Asa Hutchinson week extended eligibility military veterans least 18 years old. decision came soon appointments opened additional essential workers adults 16 64 health conditions. New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said news briefing week states setting dates based allocation projections coming federal government. Mr. Cuomo said wanted “to make sure allocation projections we’re getting feds right” setting specific date eligibility “I would rather get specific allocation number tell people state,” Mr. Cuomo said, “so don’t change advice don’t create pandemonium scheduling operation.” ... can't agree facts. February 1st, 41 million doses AstraZeneca vaccine sent EU 33 countries, largest chunk sent UK, sent US, export ban new account, got banned again? reason India giving away many vaccines vast majority population hasn’t vaccinated? It’s awesome Bangladesh it’s kind weird given 2.2% India vaccinated far according Bloomberg. milestone Israel really started bend back cases. Wow, that’s using helluva lot. bought 2 gallons last year gf we’ve barely made dent one them. Listen, asked you’re getting downvotes. That’s downvoted comment. argue day long, using terms like “fair chunk” makes look even less informed. look Israel see herd immunity achievable, lower rate you’re assuming. Israel’s 58% vaccinated, reproductive rate respect time really insanely low (near 0.5) almost restrictions place. Yup. district (~80k students) back person parents given choice classroom distance half chose distance. brother 1-2 students per period max. I'm guessing change people actually ABLE get vaccine appointment area. Again, family lives actual poor country. GDP growing there's end sight suffering, go off. Curious anyone bothers commenting without PhD then. Commission, Parliament. Lack knowledge politics especially EU work another huge problem. mean pass Ireland's EU assignment AstraZeneca exported UK? 

Johnson cited capitalism behind vaccine success, even though UK mostly dependent EU exports, essentially AstraZeneca delivered EU contract London paid divert. 

This forgotten. think depends are. DeBlasio said he's hoping maybe possibly open Broadway Fall - meet unspecified conditions kind unspecified restrictions (it certainly sounds like masks required).

Even sub, people last gasps trying keep people locked down. There's another thread front page people freaking Spring Breakers Florida. yet. think transparency US terms deaths registration. Yeah visited grandparents whole way through. It’s choice government’s lol Second hand smoke? reminds artist formerly known gas brakes 4th July Michigan last year   White insult now? 15%+ vaccinated. That’s increase 5% per month! rate, I’d love go vacation covid restrictions easing up! mounting world’s fastest per-capita Covid-19 vaccination campaign, Chile forced announce strict new lockdowns plunges deeper severe second wave cases stretching intensive care trails Israel UAE vaccine doses per 100 inhabitants worldwide, new cases risen quickly amid mixed health messaging, travel southern hemisphere summer holidays circulation new variants.

Chile emerges global leader Covid inoculations 'pragmatic strategy'
Read half South American country’s population received least one vaccine dose, Friday, Chile recorded 7,626 new cases 24-hour period – highest total point pandemic – approaching 1m cases total. inexpensive KN-95s buying eBay definitely fit tightly N-95s, that's important.

HOWEVER, also use $15 reusable silicone mask brace, fit dramatically better.

I know N-95 level, got better people doing, also cheap, convenient, comfortable. data back whole city overrun type, proudly anit-science proudly walking around maskless like they're better masked plebs. 

Elon needs hurry go mars, believe science hopefully believe mars either. world.. puzzle face, tell us truth,half none??? Well vulnerable can't vaccinated, that's responsibility anti-vaxxers wise rather everyone else continuing lockdown.  Considering controversial section spreading anti-mask propaganda, I'd say need stop throwing stones around glsss house yours. Yes bear mind UK surplus summer. EU much doses Right, also society let participate it. Literally 3 minute search confirms concrete evidence. expected diminish transmission long term implications understood, social distancing &amp; masks advised even post injection. might talking fines? travelling US get vaccinated instead? know someone thought way friend. said precaution ensure side effects known. Details variants research Pfizer vaccine changed mind. Appear!! Numbers rising everywhere also appears coincide vaccinations. maybe last five times try wear one day work including lunch breaks etc, find get bit wet probably switch best efficacy. We're talking wearing one twenty minutes shop (although people that). point everyone wearing better masks governments industries need production subsidise employees. key reopening schools vaccinations. exposed many schools terrible HVAC upgraded keep people healthy years come, that's worth getting after. can't keep schools reopening.

Teachers given priority vaccine line society, exchange resuming normalcy sooner. every last ductwork installation needed ideal union would stop fighting, diverted shots ahead vulnerable populations. went Ocean city yesterday like 70% people masks crowded like hell. understand still lot new cases. cares  I've reddit long time seen many random dumb ideas spread reddit spill onto world. month two yet doubt mask mandates end people like feel safe virtue signal India desperately poor. live here. Watch slumdog millionaire. accurate. believe logged ~2500 deaths month March 30’s age group. seeing massive surges amount cases. article floating around yesterday getting people riled listed, within body, cases ~317%, deaths ~317%. it’s case sheer numbers people getting infected, leading higher number people hospital, unfortunately higher number people surviving. P.1? health system collapsing? something else? believe they’re still trying figure out. P.1 indeed seem infectious, possibly result severe outcomes, place control Brazil, it’s hard tell, early make call. Thankfully P.1 variant seems escape vaccines, can, get vaccinated! Dude giving vaccine free u care make money know correctly donate vaccine 70 countries free u crying export ban like u loving mud hole amaxon forest something... could think so.

You go place large number foot traffic, people interact objects surfaces. hardly surfaces desiccated.

Or small, corner stores small footage, low ceiling, poor ventilation. 

There theory practice.

And need change barber takes 30min cut hair xD. you’re yet eligible means you’re low risk. people die drowning average year people 35 died form covid. Would prefer eat pile shit would prefer pile shit filled nails, blood, fungus, hair, razor blades, piss. 

It's damned do, really really damned situation. states lockdown properly funding numbers. Florida lying since day one thats proven time time probably one actually read article. False. Keep reading. They’re probably also shit ton drugs, unprotected sex, kinds stuff they’d live side effects of.  Another record day!!! combination demand somewhat higher supply lot lower.

Taking Soutywest example, planes still flying 2/3s capacity lot fewer flights. Places could normally go 5 directs day normal times 2. decline January February result lockdowns. Closing businesses enacting curfews negligible impact spread respiratory coronavirus Lol Actually evidence shows fully vaccinated people cannot asymptotically spread covid, that’s CDC allowing grandparents visit families grandkids even aren’t vaccinated. sane person 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 one seems understand without lockdowns would utter chaos. lesser two evils. lockdown would still resulted people locking saw deaths skyrocketing. would led massive social unrest. Panic. People killing eachother food water. Systemic collapse. 

Just look people hoarded toilet paper. hospitals collapse, dominoe effect. People would go survival mode stop going work frantically collecting supplies support family. means people provide food water well, supply lines would absolutely fucked. there's food shipped around, harvested. things get really bad.

No one realizes close world came societal collapse. takes one domino fall rest get triggered. 

Lockdowns literally exactly intended. Avoid mass deaths avoid social unrest mass panic. 

Is totally shitty lockdowns? Yes. lesser two evils best option virus deadly virulent? Absolutely yes.  didn’t answer question: mask wearing damage small entirely wiped small business Ireland

For start, lie.

Secondly, didn’t support government stimulus packages order keep afloat? India fucking socioeconomic nightmare beyond China outcome specific circumstances.  people travel - consultants, sales, etc. - basically to. large portion recover near 100% quickly. Okay, excuse reckless behaviour happening Florida. Holy macaroni ? week saw headline mentionning 30m doses supposed get EU held Italian depot, suspected rerouted UK ... next level geopolitical deception here. Fact every country EU pressurised joining.  Oh, question become nurses, become antivaxx? Reddit sometimes confusing hell. small business? lockdowns almost entirely wiped small business Ireland. like ghost town.

Why people fixated wearing masks? Some. Kind fetish? care less put face.

Lockdown restrictions murdered economy, relying passing trade. Even adherence nonsense. numbies  understand closing chichen itza, ruin site? people drawn studying nursing job security decent money (I know latter varies location). necessarily people empathetic, good critical thinking skills, passion science. 

And use authority medical professional spew conspiracy theories people think holds weight. regurgitating taking flawed lockdown skeptic talking points. Sweden throughout pandemic still much higher cases, hospitalizations deaths (vg .no/spesial/corona/norden/) neighbouring Nordic countries, shares similar demographic structure, culture geographic location with. 

North Dakota introduced statewide mask mandate November 14th, couple days [cases started downward fell much quickly neighbouring South Dakota.

The virus geographic nature affects different areas different severity different time points. visible looking [which states improving fastest point pandemic dynamics complex, masks one factor help slow exponential growth- solution. 

Following science would mean accepting numerous (and most) peer-reviewed studies shown masks lockdowns effective reducing spread, become less less effective time re-enforced people start caring less less. Crore = 10 million
Lakh = 100k Five Thousand Fools Barça Hey Kim, key reopening schools vaccinations. exposed many schools terrible HVAC upgraded keep people healthy years come, that's worth getting after. can't keep schools reopening.

Teachers given priority vaccine line society, exchange resuming normalcy sooner. every last ductwork installation needed ideal union would stop fighting, diverted shots ahead vulnerable populations. Except actual lockdowns.

And even US lockdown lite works pretty well. Given Brazil's highest death count far 3600/day seems extremely unlikely unless reason half deaths relatively small age band know relatively low risk compared older individuals. Pfizer actually nothing AFAIK. They're manufacturer, involved discovery creation. Fosun manufacturer Hong Kong's BioNTech vaccine. know fact. think comparing NI's 7 day rate Ireland's 14 day rate. yes, even doubled, NI less cases. Debatable whether could say significantly, depends consider significant. Homie say ""poor"", we're mostly referring per capita wealth. raw amount money country tell country wealthy not. That's like saying Switzerland/Sweden/Norway/Denmark/Iceland poor countries economies smaller India. world standards, India wealthy country – middle income, sure. wealthy. Florida Man variant believe see eyes

moon landing happen confirmed go together also nursing homes bubble. staff even make precautions inevitably catch it, running rampant general population. nurse used secure job, good wage. meant whiever could coast lessons internship half-decent, could land job safe dor life.
In general, may happen people vocation inclination choose jobs basis security wage.

This get anti-vaxxer negationist medical personnel, this, believe, sense first comment. Well, that's case, reopen, healthcare system nowhere close overloaded. Certainly Florida, probably anywhere.

You're going come another argument. sense wealthy countries vaccinating first though. Wealthy nations likely far movement people economies heavily rely people interacting outside immediate area. Also, lot less wealthy nations' economies rely strength wealthier nation's economies (whether ethical different issue) uninsured maybe, still better bleeding death know “advocate” means? Saying sky blue *advocating* blue sky.  Endemic Covid gonna happen. Read article. Even might learn something. Specifically amount (per volume) neutralising antibody verses different strains.

The number antibodies alone doesn’t matter.  It’s whether attach problem.  

When say x-fold reduction imagine one dude giving 2 blood samples. One sample put test tube original virus.  put test tube SA strain.

The first sample might show 1,000 antibodies per microlitre. second sample 20.  That’s 50-fold reduction neutralising antibodies. blood, number antibodies - don’t attach different strain.

The important question many neutralising antibodies actually need real life.  It’s hard tell. AZ looked like still 22% efficacy SA strain real life, even 86-fold reduction neutralising antibodies lab.  2-7 fold decrease vaccines probably bad sounds.  Definitely doesn’t mean efficacy would drop 50-13%.  Right point is, bad been, *is* working. Essentially, failed take steps did, millions vulnerable people would died. would overwhelmed health systems worldwide millions would died lack healthcare access. Certain areas outcome least somewhat, like Italy. relied neighbors help took extreme measures reduce spread. However, globe same, would neighbors rely on. 

Even now, local hospitals verge collapsing months ago, even wait times 7+ hours ED. People died ED waiting, horrible. that's many reasons, staff stretched thin finding workers almost impossible, several units still chock full Covid people need constant care, regional hospitals worse. bad time still need hospital care. 

And comments angry doubting something that's pretty basic. Specifically topic skeptics making similar comments made worse spreading doubt fear, causing people comply basic safety measures, causing unnecessary deaths. Compassionate people see horrible waste life become upset see someone unnecessary skepticism. Really Brazil? I'd thought they'd similar rest Latin America. Emoji allowed titles. Make new submission plain text title.

What phrase! UK genome sequences 1 3 tests. got pretty good hunting variants last months believe even special task force set that. MI April 1 believe. Nah, read blogs, prefer reading angry comments comments Reddit. 

I appreciate Willy E Coyote analogy, work COVID? Lockdowns, masks, distancing numbers still there? problem? flushing economy drain reason? Would less restrictive measures equal result infections, create another problem? using Willy E Coyote analogy, really needed big massive anvil would better small one, going fall head anyway? Vaccinating vulnerable across world would drive deaths hospitalization down. two metrics keep pandemic going. Also, young people far likely seniors asymptomatic know symptomatic people several times infectious. US right vaccinating age 16 many states.

Maybe Brazilian President former President BFFs? Stop spreading anti-vax “Vaccines don’t work!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!” bs. Cases creeping people younger 65 (the primary spreaders COVID) largely unable get vaccinated, thus spreading contracting COVID, 70% older 65 (the at-risk people) least one dose. COVID cases, hospitalizations, deaths going elderly vaccines. didn’t vaccines, would worse Brazil right now. we’re not, VACCINES WORK. PA apparently everyone vaccinated wants vaccinated June 20th...

Aument said state projects complete state’s four vaccination phases following dates:

* Phase 1B by May 2
* Phase 1C by May 23
* Phase 2 (general public) by June 20

If get pay walled, open You’re right, let rephrase actually meant said that. one says “Americans” referring Mexicans. doesn’t make sense, even though geographically correct sense Mexico part North America. 

Let ask - “Americans” way refer people US, correct term them? widely recognized way refer citizens United States America?

I’ll concede point give clear direct answer asking. Ok, explain cases falling, mass testing either. easy shit Birx consider this...

Also, hanging around outside vaccination center closing time gives really high chance vaccinated, often pull people street rather throw away unused shots end day.

I guess data interpretation struggle with, reading comprehension well.

Good Luck! mean it. 4th wave virus kills 0.00001% healthy young people. stop propaganda please. don’t think they’ll longer Fall. live Florida tell places Mary mask sight cases declined folks getting vaccinated. given vaccine threshold order ditch vaccine passport? say it’s temporary it’s not. People think vaccines dangerous and/or ineffective.

Plenty people don’t get vaccine antivaxxers.

Regardless, mRNA vaccines (1) essentially brand new technology little long-term track record (2) lacking meaningful long-term side effect data.

Regardless whether vaccines *appear* safe, literally *cannot* know safe long-term around long enough. QR code either display phone, print hard copy desire. live state still hasn’t opened age group, went ahead booked appointment April 22, assuming eligible then. I’m not, I’ll still get shot. Science making inferences based past data.

Coronaviruses mutate slowly said. Thus risk escaping vaccine low. already negatively affect small portion population elderly. leaving rest us relatively unbothered. Maybe cold flu symptoms. I’m rare cases may see lung damage.

We say 100% say 80-85% thing control won’t worry us near future. gotta look Europe.

Remember crazy conspiracy theorists ones first wearing masks stocking food supplies?

Remember average person said COVID worse flu? Early r/coronavirus used ban people suggesting COVID worse flu. first place advocated masks personally remembered

After media blew up, people started freaking starting caring. Buying Cool story dude go get covid vaccines don’t create magic shield virus, prime immune system fight quicker gets system.

The point vaccines reduce R value (spread rate) vaccine 1, virus longer spreads exponentially! No... We're going full dystopia. Buckle 

Although rare, HIV indeed spread saliva ok.

Thank you. Seriously. needed someone remind this. Literally anyone wants get right say “unpaid carer”.

Yes. called 7 day average weekly rolling average. consistently seeing higher numbers day week week.

Its rolling average deaths actually went 23 March 26 20 March 27, no, again, giving false information. trend line consistently projecting upwards since early March.

It difficult understand worrisome.

Too early want take quick glance, look peak reporting day week, falls thurs, look trend past several weeks -- increasing since early March. 

I have, wrong. alright, people hate plateau, anyone interpret basic data see this.

It is. luck, need it.

Lol. yeah November lock (ish, seem strict lock like one December). still change point pretty much 3 months summer open (with social distance restrictions) saw cases rising leading November lock down.  Honestly, think anyone accurately predict that. tell without free home testing random testing, (population sampling), never get rid it. Getting vaccine everyone quickly - would good step. They're working it. Yeah love big government looking neck ""saftey"" too. Nobody wanted excess swine flu vaccine reputed bad side effects, much later disproved, fizzling pandemic. Unapproved Ebola vaccine? Sure, fix potential roadblocks. 

Also recall folks calling US share supplies now. get vaccinated get COVID pass unvaccinated people made stupid choice getting vaccinated sucks them. travel countries, vaccines must date everything readily available, regardless prevalence. makes think Americans visiting Cancun aren’t vaccinated? really hasn’t. haven’t gone 40k infections day what, year now? Based lot comments here, I'll probably stick house parties BBQs, sounds like everything else (concerts, camping etc) super busy year.

But live somewhere can't get shit together vaccine probably think haha don’t think EU even agreement Novavax.

I understand logistical challenges here, elderly kind help appointments, groceries, whatever, else they'd literally dead now. 

Most good citizens willing help asked.  huge windows classrooms school refuses give screens. Bugs sometimes birds fly in. It’s wonderful article headline wrong.

PA open vaccines everyone May 1, expects everyone vaccinated June 20. seems like reasonable timeline. Cuomo. likes another little tool take people's rights away. dies care thresholds, temporary measures, safety. fact there's pandemic going incidental convenience fantasy American dictator. Holy fucking shit. ALREADY got Nazis. You’re unironically meme. spreading easily all. We've almost issues imagine mask usage among kids ;) assume masks probably absolute last thing go given there's real economic disbenefit closures limited numbers venues even social distancing requirements. need quarantine risk. elderly close 100% vaccinations game, set, match covid. need anything close 75% population vaccination herd immunity. people get pretty much week so. Yes outliers elderly risk people vaccinated everyone else gets shot bonus. you’re worried viruses spreading, killing, mutating, I’ve got bad news you. It’s happening forever.

Covid much deadlier seasonal flu. According data, people (worldwide, regardless rich country vs poor country) kills .05% infected people 70 years old.

When factor everyone, it’s 0.23%.

Again, that’s data. That’s rich countries poor countries. That’s young countries old countries.

The reason you’re freaked Covid it’s hyped 11. Statistically speaking, mildly concerned Covid seasonal flu. weren’t wearing masks, avoiding stores/bars/etc. flu, probably don’t need Covid either. SHUT TF WEAR Without assigning intentionality, Redfield told believes origin pandemic lab China already studying virus, exposing human cell cultures.

""Most us lab, trying grow virus, try help make grow better, better, better, better, better, better experiments figure it. That's way put together.""

It controversial, politically charged theory -- one World Health Organization calls ""extremely unlikely,"" clear evidence support [""lab leak"" many official studies regarding this, two weeks second dose general ""correct"" answer. companies made mRNA vaccines said, best answer moment, I'm sure trying say. picture thumbnail isn’t taken long lens, looks like around 35mm. people close appear be. leadership failed taking seriously start. Plus lack help humanity leadership.

I understand people became jaded. Vaccine cards, centralized system Netherlands bible belt? Where? #1 rule/strategy people use arguing bad faith: attack person say anything. idea “living basement fear”. That’s nonsense, I’m defending system safe reopening. system like literally built people “get back lives” safe way. like someone right say “muh freedom, ain’t gettin vax”, business right say “alright, fuck then”. Fuck....I hope US right thing donates vaccines we’ve gotten point. app-based system, could give us feelings could ""slippery slope"" Chinese-style social credit system first Pfizer dose 9 hours ago. far, zero issues aside little bit tired. think back feeling things year ago updating sub vaccine experience today crazy. modelling helped too. fact open source meant everyone could contribute critique gave meaningful numbers could discuss scenarios. wife friends (we're 30/31) NHS last week - wife mild asthma GP reached Monday. 

I think depends country they're definitely getting list. Unfortunately disagree. variants contagious vaccinated. hope deal B117 surge April P1 surge July. don’t care rising cases now. LMAO, problem exactly happens 2 months, way things gone goal post moving..and thats big problem, plan laid return normalcy job, intent *slave* pandemic, get cursed constantly, coughed continually, life threatened patients busy wait testing. doubt blame Fauci, sounds right  says healthy young person.

What non-healthy young? Full resistance like going back March 2020 quite unlikely happen. Resistance mild illness spread certainly possible. increasingly common, know yesterday huge vaccination centre near 250 no-shows course day, happens lot places tell volunteers text anyone area might want one get vaccine bodies. scientific decision experts knew immunity disappear weeks. 

The AZ trial also 3 month gap participants knew immunity would last gap. AZ trial immunity actually better longer gap touche vaccinated, matter someone else wear mask?  Another consideration one shot might work well two shots variants. Valisure list products benzene turns Artnaturals version specifically infused aloe vera, particular version apparently falls 2ppm benzene. he's first governor approve vaccine passport. Cuomo wants punish people getting vaccine wants punish people giving people vaccine. wrote book fantastic governor amazing job handling pandemic. artifact? regularly check daily covid cases first time see this. However almost plausible must reverse exponential R0 thanks high vaccination rate I'm afraid vaccine passports go way posf-9/11 security theater. words, go away all. claim falsifiable. way know death toll would done things differently. try make inferences based happened countries zero covid never going work diverse country 330 million people two porous land borders. European countries took strict measures much better. Asian countries well many factors play.

Also fails answer question. number non covid patients urgent care this? would number go down? think is. get tested twice week university shared lot information positive result. Said positive B117 variant not. I'm also young healthy helps. Probably full decade probably months. Let's say early fall critical. Two-thirds Covid deaths directly attributed obesity, hypertension (high blood pressure) diabetes heart failure. say want conditions arbitrary. They're direct result said people lived lives. 

It baffles everyone look lives lost say travesty people dying give shit health macron blame vaccines It’s even poor choice words, though.

Or, specific, it’s “poor choice” account absolute spatulas *choose* offended nothing. 30% US virus. like 30% first dose vaccine going stop cases. Assuming 30% 30% virus probably looking 50% people immune That’s Fauci CDC aren’t telling people it’s true end line. giving people hope saying “wait little longer definitely certainly open up,” think many people would impatient. massive population densisty difference there.

This fallacy. everyone get vaccinated been; COVID rare. 
You still risk becoming sick. still variants there, may aware them. COVID becomes deadly, circumvents vaccine, what? develop boosters. 

And depending upon vaccine gotten, may may still able transmit it. 

Please careful. clinic seen patients thought clear still ended getting it.  *cries Dutch speed vaccinating* Astroturf likely 1. UK exporting anything vaccine production inside UK, importing EU, USA. shabby, ignorant immoral.
2. UK EU delivery contracts AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca delivering UK instead equality UK EU.

I agree Mexicans also Americans; however, case linguistic laziness. think another ""short way"" referring people US. suppose could use Estadounidense, entirely accurate either, it? all, United States Mexico! people enough things going back normal yet. Every person street, every store, every restaurant everyone masked up, temperature checks, mandatory hand sanitizer. 

You want come US think taking seriously 😂 see, see. 

What I’m saying nowhere near zero Covid deaths (and again, talking given state? Across country? long maintain zero Covid deaths opinion lift mask mandates?) CDC already said it’s fine wear masks certain situations. number situations CDC outright advising masks continue grow. 

I’m saying won’t wearing masks airplanes 2022. 

But I’d wager close 50% country mask mandate time fall. Probably more. idk first part comment accurate, second part kinda cunty, no? 

Secondly, fuck Andrés Manuel López Obrador? 

Because idea. Von Der lier try spin make UK's fault somehow apparently Biden Administration working wide-reaching specific “vaccine passport” policy rolled summer.

A certain 35% country accept calm rational manner, I’m sure mother allergic penicillin fine  Honestly would motivated bottom line ever lead better outcome following health guidelines instead.

This country severely needs learning area risk assessment critical thinking. Promise wear mask everywhere I'm next week. I’m 80 there’s way I’m putting life hold year. I’d smart things people act like hermit somehow righteous agree. Yeah variants concerning times, 26% Americans fully vaccinated. think combination faster recordings pandemic fatigue, people may going even vaccinated, people immunity infected gradually losing it.

In fact think fact it’s plateaued increased bit actually testament good vaccines agree. know case wish could also wear mask I'm working flu season. work restaurant routinely get sick almost every year. year though! It’s just, nobody wants go war days. People learned past. It’s worth it, especially nukes around. we’re taking seriously lol. president anti-masker, told people go hug first wave, caught covid. subsecretary charge pandemic mocks deaths covid, keeps going vacations, walks around maskless also caught covid. sure hope different variants strains start popping out? remember hearing anything December last year. That’s bit insensitive actually crying “these people”, no? 

Yes, low amount deaths good, means UK something good, way approached stance last spring break, media reported stories virus suddenly became deadly young people. 

It must strange variant quickly died out. 

I wonder variant reappear media spring break. anyone time parties regardless covid happened really hope see declassified stuff die inner workings experiments government put interest pandemic. 

I doubt it, hey, there's declassified stuff years ago available today. id honestly rather wait 2 months legal restrictions go rather restrictions lessened massively go tougher restrictions later kids could potentially infected transmit one another, younger kids less likely spread teens. you’re looking strictly follow cdc advice, kids different households take precautions one household unvaccinated people gather one time others vaccinated. you’re willing take bit risk meet, could keep gathering outside kids wear masks stay apart. Or, continue modified form bubble let kids play together, keeping informed child symptoms showing sick, etc. 

I don’t think there’s official guidance yet. really wish advice published topic. it’s hard flip switch go wide open without precautions, time, kids really benefit social interaction can’t imagine keeping young kids 6 feet apart play. Really excited least see grandparents vaccinated adults now, safely, though! hitting priority targets 1-9 too! Quite milestones coincide lockdown easing. Pennsylvania also. sucks. still stage 2 believe. never going get there. Yes, you’re fine. family member went thing, told it’s fine fine injection went restaurant yesterday eaten outside at, cases rose fell, last year. Inexplicably, employees masks on.

Perpetual lockdowns reasonable trying cure - it'll rest lives future generations. literally said phuket, let's open. deport Americans don’t wear masks.

Take children put private, profit detention facilities. That’s true every disease though mistake Brazilian president Jair Bolsanaro Mexican one? Everyone south Mexican, huh? Republicans read headline. Yes, thank clarification. 

Citation post here: Covid isolated incident response human hubris overconsumption. Natural disasters health crisis's continue humanity learns boundaries. get coming from. sense already economic war China least. sanctions uighurs impact I'm really comfortable talking much impact know.

There's much economic war tensions get high destruction happens. people would rather make people disappear work them. means so. data indicates I’m biggest majority, though. Americans agree wear masks CDC tells us to. guy center photo - even wear pants that's going wear them? Lol that’s good analogy. Biden letting thousands people could Covid. Amen that! journalists anymore. old guy often astounded historical matters ""journalist"" fails mention. agree this. kids going back school almost fully spring break don’t see problem fans, open windows outdoor time. (Our school told us send small blanket lessons outside whenever weather permits). mental health aspects children going something we’re addressing years, truly believe kids get vaccine (fingers crossed it’s end year), slow transition back friends less fear help much. Schools best (ours is) don’t think they’ll need intense measures (new hvac systems). got dealt shitty hand school seems best. I'm afraid get it? Seems beyond cautious point [CA] old school teachers benefiting. make 2.5% every year worked. taught 40 years, make 100% pay. teaching, paid 8% pay. 

However, new teachers make 2% year (if teach 40 years, make 80% pay), also pay 12% pay year, 8%. 

I pay get less. Fantastic news. guess next milestone 50% population, 34 million. Gotta date Pfizer Thurs. Stoked..... Require proof vaccination flying.  America reach herd immunity july.  way arent back normal 2021 three official government figures Russia:

* Daily COVID deaths according COVID Operative Headquarters (used sources): total **97,740** today, March 28.
* Monthly COVID deaths according Rosstat (up January 2021 moment): total 131,118 deaths directly COVID, additional 69,314 deaths diagnosed COVID considered main cause death. total deaths diagnosed COVID **200,432**.
* Total mortality data according Rosstat, gives us estimate around **400 thousand** excess deaths January 2021.

The ""5x higher official count"" statement comes comparison first number Operative Headquarters (which around 70k end January, latest total mortality available) excess deaths. *rumor* statement, publicly available everyone interested.

And compare total deaths diagnosed COVID (200k) excess deaths (400k), Russia actually undercounts factor 2 instead 5. still lot, fair. reason native americans go different vaccination system? different healthcare structure them? Nah, think virus made crisis US. Mask mandates lifted 95% places long hit zero deaths (and zero deaths across long period time way?) 

They’re already lifted now. 

I’ll wear mask I’m asked (and set foot friend’s house year) I’m curious know ‘we’ refer comment comprised of, I’m pretty sure you’re increasingly small minority vaccine rolling out. got first Moderna shot yesterday. arm insanely sore, like tore muscle, rash too, it’s constant pain hear lasts two days wife totally fine.

My question is, expect similar arm pain second shot? comparing apples oranges here. Israel vaccinated 55% total population, since 30% population 18 can't vaccinated, they've actually vaccinated 85% adult population. 

UK vaccinated 45% total population far, equates 57% adult population quoted article. we're actually still ways behind israel vaccinating rest adult population, especially 50s without underlying health conditions. You’ve completely failed engage difficult questions I’ve presented. mental gymnastics - they’re pretty straightforward questions.

I know world hard understand want make sense it, denying impact pandemic feel cleverer everyone supremely self-absorbed, actively contributing damage.

Grow up. That's incorrect, I'm wondering they've got az Pfizer confused export Pfizer EU. 

[Here's correct EU exported 77m vaccines 40 middle- high-income countries since December 1, according commission figures published Thursday — almost many 88m delivered within bloc. 21m doses gone UK, EU officials said, including 1m AstraZeneca jabs sent EU export regime came force late January.  knew time already, SA resigned using AZ this. Might UK already announcing boosters, although EU also ordered, sure US plans do. Comparing post 1918 pandemic period events today way author selects proper historical evaluation. many ways roaring 20s brought perfect confluence factors events. war ending, pandemic ending, exponential rise globalization, technological boom factors considered significant variables.

The decrease globalization shifting towards self reliance isolation national certainly allow economic prosperity would required repeat perfect storm occurred 100 years ago. protection hospitalization much higher protection infection. end, really matters terms governments forced respond outbreaks. would think vaccine thats 94 Percent effective could prevent 100 percent deaths lol Well, Arizona vaccinating elderly teachers since January. believe state also bunch essential workers well. point, precisely waiting for? Even NJ said anything k. I'm person replied to, mandatory masks airports would effectively end travel me. panic disorder agoraphobia. severe enough can't drive I've tried jump moving car run road panicking. already sedated planes car trips outside city.

I use Uber public buses get around since mask mandate passed, panic attacks increased frequency weekly daily. I've spent entire life trying fight agoraphobia experience world outside neighborhood feel comfort zone slowly shrinking can't tolerate feeling something mouth. Even ""it's cloth."" conspiracy theorist friend, never was. enjoying mental gimnastics guys must make everything fit. Love it. Yeah Mexico doesn’t unemployment business assistance like US. really suffering, it’s tough situation. Might better luck pharmacy last appointment is. Well course they’re different situations. point arguing Mexico blame, tourists blame behaviour. That’s all. CA appears similar problems. People struggle get appointments LA, SD, Bay Area, etc Fresno seems always open appointments. Also running cycling. Although lightweight cool breathable sunblocking technical clothing becoming available. Lol there's nothing moralizing it. People want things exactly covid thing acting like it. bad covid still much thing. Ergo, numbers rise. logic, long something human nature fault people that's society works all. Killing people much human nature still laws murder treat murderers like bad people. Society makes rules go human nature time greater good. We’ll stay home eight billion people vaccinated, since international travel spread variants.

Of course, can’t possibly get within 3-6 month span, we’ll need stay home get boosters. 

Did get point? We've zero deaths Scotland several times already, including today. earthly scenario would result genocide. Stop scared. wonder Malta able secure many extra vaccines already given first shot 30% adult population, thought receives vaccines EU. Good though. We’re sending Ted Cruz! safe enough open high-risk activities everyone. According Bloomberg, 75% Americans vaccinated July, would assume around timeframe. 

And clear things like concerts sports events, remained closed since last March. less two-tier society way safely open parts economy couple months early.

In case, also open negative test result (if actually read article), *need* get vaccine really want to. (You absolutely though) We’ve got lockdown well fairness 10,000 better things could spend bloated military budget too, continue spend billions billions every year, think you’re concentrating small fish frankly it’s employers’ business whether you’re vaccinated not, especially you’ve already covid.

not mention opens kinds cans worms - asking medical information condition work? happens don’t voluntarily submit you’re vaccinated? It’s like force share information, let alone religious implications vaccinations either Guess what. They’re catching ones can. 6% population 65 they’ve vaccinated 2.2%. don’t think vaccine hesitancy explains it. C-h-a-d. K-a-r-e-n. think getting point. latter type American believes they're unaccountable local laws customs because: ""I'm 'murican, know rights!"" Depends region current 1 dose rate believe well hit like 70-75 % first dose end May it’s hard imagine we’ll seeing huge demand point May given know large group never vaxxers, hesitant vaxxers, lazy people. guess mid May higher demand states mid April early May lower demand states/areas I’m aware think there’s 1000 better things could spend money for. Yup. would though younger age brackets regularly would already caught imagine U.K. must getting close sort herd immunity. everything nazism except nazism good look seriously doubt that's true. go elsewhere

Yeah that’s point. know stupid understand, time person's fear rather respect others spreading potentially fatal disease. I'm 35 relatively healthy, comorbidities, choose staying home love fellow man, fear. I'm driving Denver Colorado Springs next Saturday go get mine. Lol. really need study everything life days? got second shot NY mass vaccination site week ago qualified medical reasons. almost one vaccine site. nurse said lot people aren’t showing second shot opinion, jabbing anyone wants supply demand. That’s purely anecdotal though take grain salt. agree UK strategy better, US different issues. large number people refusing get vaccinated. live Michigan hard find vaccine, travel 40 miles south Ohio easy. areas largely spared first two peaks getting hit. huge number people refusing mask state governments (Texas, Florida) overriding local mask laws business restrictions. www.euronews.com/amp/2021/03/26/vaccine-hesitancy-rises-in-france-after-astrazeneca-suspension-survey-reveals read comment said it’s analogous 4 drivers arriving time 4 way stop, 4 waiving go first. seems noble it’s slowing whole process down. Alright! Let's fuck up! government spends far far stupid things every single day tbh Hell yeah! Entertainers gotta make money too! I've stringently social distanced mask wearing etc, I'm immune, restaurants live music time BABY! “I don’t want working building you’re okay potentially infecting workforce causing us shut unknown period time.” Seems like good business me. I'd say going private condo something like enjoying beauty weather problem. got first Pfizer dose yesterday! covid months back, extremely mild (thankfully) felt like sinus infection. I’m 24 hours besides feeling tired slight headache-which since gone away, arm injection site quite sore bit swollen. that, far it’s good! Wonder second dose go weeks.  stupid take. house parties every couple months friends hold last year. friends fully vaccinated late May. going go back partying time. I’m early 30’s, married, work full time. Still plenty time part weekends. Learn live little. Pfizer &amp; moderne better efficacy preventing COVID symptoms j&amp;j preventing serious illness. 
Do know j&amp;j numbers preventing symptoms? want disclose that? believe NY already digital version, seems like easiest way reached beginning ""papers, please"". certain genocidal German workers party would proud. Screw passport screw anyone think okay. wants tell dirtbag influencers Tulum “precious tourism dollars” fact “saving Mexico.” teach mask rule college, worried I'll continue next Fall even students chance vaccinated.

It makes frustrated president press secretary take masks speak podium, lecture podium mask. Feels like different rules elite people. hope ends soon also see end sight. vaccine orgies at? Going say I'm sat 33 going last chump back bus rate stolen?  


Is business dealing private customers theft now? policy could see actually enforceable without disenfranchising people need passport go nonessential businesses without mask. War moved front lines tech, espionage, trade, money, etc.

Wars always fought way. similar sentiments taken truth World War 1. I’m saying war coming, reasoning flawed. depend entirely state live in. states, absolutely. states, maybe. mayor country lost job said interview: “fortunately” lost 25 lifes city. “Please respectful visit country.”

That’s two months now. 2 million+ vaccines Indiana residents . Cases low summer. Snake pit probably won’t happen outdoor events fine then. spend time travel subreddits thankfully people subreddits responsible covid willing wait vaccine traveling...

...but there's loud minority sneers covid restrictions, basically straight-out say think lives covid victims worth saving means giving vacations.

Lots people like flocked Mexico thanks lax restrictions there. Putting people's lives risk know sit still entertain themselves. Really disappointing I'm glad minority people overall who've acted way time.  Interestingly enough, another thread people saying “I’m vaccinated, point it’s important go spend money help economy stay inside minuscule chance could still get sick.” Makes sense. Meh COVID damage lungs hearts age. take care stop worrying details. borders never closed people world travelled, currently UK Brazilian variants ramping government cares tourism money.

And let's face it, there's Canadians cancelled flights saw plenty old coworkers sharing Cancun pictures. May ones afford 3 day hotel fees back. Presumably high risk group, open 50s yet Edited reply, ""single IFR 0.6"" personal problem it. I've seen ton back napkin math sub makes really big assumptions. Maybe OP included uncertainty calculations, I'd give bit credit. problem oversimplified math used place either downplay pandemic undermine public health efforts like mask wearing. Well governments like take advantage crisis they’ll use excuse book keep things place. It’s happened before. I’m pointing things could go since U.S government loves restrictions. 'tiny batch' makes 'largest chunk' 41million doses.

You reaching bit, you?

Much likely newspaper got mixed 11million Pfizer doses UK imported. Thank posting this. donate clinic may continue serve. Actually Bolsonaro far worse. I’m hoping there’s least digital option way print additional copies, aren’t disenfranchised society misplace original. Lol I’m seeing people say “it short term”

If it’s short term trying drop probably millions dollars try implement something place couple months. LOL yes is. Cuomo TV Oct/Nov going he’s putting place vaccine review committee didn’t trust it. sounds unethical think vaccine mandatory. least charge substantial fine refusing take it. Perhaps refuse put lockdown? think missing point. whatever. key. Yep. drove San Diego LA mini staycation, major tourist areas, maaaaybe 50% people wearing masks, many nose-dicking it. Like, know numbers vaccinations up, come people. Can’t wait nineteenth wave 2044. let’s get lives brave... borderline underweight already, hunger heck quicker death sentence fat/closer overweight like united states. Plus plan open close again, need prepare everything it. bought Bielcor ones article &amp; really good seal Actually war reasonable alternative Bolsonaro. live paying attention... still 1A! optimistic lmao. even 1B 1C yet. Lol half country can’t roll functioning vaccine registration site want vaccine passports now. U.S. COVID-19 VACCINATIONS:

180,644,125 doses distributed

88,725,276 first doses administered

50,141,769 fully vaccinated people

+3,475,894 since previous update city yesterday encountered many groups/families clearly visiting Europe. also ones wearing masks. think vaccine supply outstrip demand? End May? Got J&amp;J shot yesterday morning. 

Had fever, headache, body ache, threw 6 times last night. 

Feel lot better today though. Fever gone feel bit since really sleep not. Buy HVAC stonks. hopefully Better be, cinema airline stocks waiting fly XD drones think that's ideal Unfortunately anecdotes don’t mean you’re right bigger scale. Sorry friends feel way. moved front lines tech, espionage, trade, money, etc.

Don't forget proxy wars two different sides use poor middle eastern country similar fight other. variant spread around world regardless. UK international totally shut like NZ, bad variant appearing anywhere world still affects UK. variant appearing Ireland incredibly unlikely given population size, makes little sense slow UK vaccine programme that. part mom wants visit make get tested. I'd argue still ending prohibition phase alcohol states named Nevada. laws still archaic. pandemic loosened bit necessity. Let's see remain expand. Oh please no. I'm already depressed stupidity going gonna help. suggestions still careful despite vaccine great, stating vaccine 10% population immunity incorrect.

If case, we’d see similar ratios sickness, hospitalization, death 10%, don’t. Among vaccinated groups, zero severe symptoms, hospitalizations, deaths. original post say million people exposed would 100,000 people effect vaccine. reality, might 100,000 people cough runny nose vs non vaccinated population hospitals death. Thanks info! Im always fascinated see stuff development process.

Where hear trial sign up? second shot usually worse. 

All coworkers got Moderna said first shot fine second shift absolutely kicked ass. Well no, since also decrease flu related deaths 19 probably better normal. 


We need look excess deaths next week/month. Ahhh good point, probably another weeks 50% population like Israel cancel visa deport them. Small?

A lot people know don’t support idea (especially long term) domestic activities. Nice way duck question.  expected much. 

Enjoy show. even arguing about? 

I could give long winded complete explanation il leave takes quite long time variant become dominant. South Africa, took 6 months B1.135 became dominant since initial detection. Variant first outcompete variants become dominant. Efficacy terms geography meaningless. Also every vaccine still retains modest good neutralizing ability variants, boosters already testing, vaccine still protect severe disease 

So either you’re asking question point answered it, you’re looking argue point interest that

Also I’m Canadian, outbreak P.1 BC isn’t “large” it’s small contained, BC far genomic sequencing pretty much part US. likelihood you’d find P.1 cases populous US state BC  grandparents fully vaccinated now, got come watch little sisters first winning lacrosse game today. always wear mask even though required multiple places visit. said, people obesity months get vaccine Texas. phase 1a 1b. reason state decided open phase 2 number people showing get vaccinated dropped significantly.

C19 become endemic, like common cold seasonal flu. waiting long time everyone vaccinated (enough reach theoritcial herd immunity). much longer wait? 1 month? 6 months? 1 year? 

Sorry seem harsh. always pro slow spread mentality recently I've felt scored C19 paranoia. past 9 months I've trained two Ironman's cancelled right good reason. People Ironman triathlons fittest people earth. Super low risk hospitalization death. Yet, everyone wants keep waiting gets better. better right now. one them, feels like giant weight lifted shoulders, placed directly onto left arm. guardian PRO-eu newspaper, prior, post brexit. going people point claim masks don’t work.

Exactly. Kind get tired hearing fervent anti-maskers, way previous president, spreading misinformation masks fighting nearly every restriction big small, using increased cases say ""lockdowns"" work, making sorts flawed masks opening college, high school, elementary schools going overpower effect masks might lead cases rising. 

Schools, particularly elementary schools, one area greater respect argument reopen view maybe along lines reopening provided big steps made keep schools safer, filters, PPE. hope recent stimulus help making schools safer general virus spread going forward. emotional effects school long time big concern kids, least younger kids may great vectors spread. Teachers administrators vulnerable. Holy shit, dude. going back normal. I've heard Novavax think they'll able meet targets EU want, given EU treating AZ, best avoid supplying altogether they're confident. know reducing amount supplied option. Considering Covid’s genetic code RNA, really chance something like blindness situation could occur? sure trying white knight Biden hard. go back read initial response asking OP thought would better job, since thought trump bad job. pointing Biden equally worse job Obama. b multiple choice question. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now mind, trying binge watch second season Battlestar Galactica rudely interrupting me. lets take break shall we? genuine question. short lock Easter, cancel that? get pointless something 4 days, going back didnt strike would normally do? reduces transmission. really. likely closer 50% 92% point. None ""mutations"" make current vaccines even close useless Israel far faster vaccine ramp still saw significant lag drops became obvious.

Take look ), looks like sub population around 40-50% second dose push significantly, 60-70% really crushes curve. We’re well far, level yet. think might Brazil.

That said, significant doubts many studies risk cross contamination. Unless samples well documented history, can't stake them. lies? Dr. Fauci Dr. Birx control public health mandates US? Otherwise, response half disastrous. \*curb immunity\* article. clear Sweden better EU, substantially worse comparable Nordic countries.

For record case previous pandemics too. Sweden Denmark hit harder Norway Finland Asian flu well. US: No, look elsewhere vaccine manufacturing.

EU: Sure, factories make vaccines. (months later) Never mind, ours.

I'm saying EU prioritize citizens, there's clearly difference there. US situation, I'd want government same. clearly would disruptive countries' vaccine acquisition plans, whereas refusing give start allows different plans made. Yea point hospital much could done. One coworkers came w possible blood clot covid held hours make room since hospital already capacity sent home w double pneumonia possible blood clot. i'm fit health 32 yo UK boss said 20:30 last week ""the clinic road 4 shots left - wants them?""

and thats got first dose. 

2nd one booked already july! Kids living completely normal life. virus won’t anything risk people families vaccinated now. hope broader discussions social acceptability mask wearing possibly sick ( like Japan ), sick days workers prevent spread disease, etc. things, needing masks time issue, better wrt colds flu too.

Technically coming sick food service jobs health code violation many places, people due manager pressure reduced income sick leave. want see family. guess it’s really banned it’s unplannable. got first Pfizer shot today! Glad much company! far know, vaccines work, long term side-effects typically present within first couple months glimpse might come line patient. 

Besides typical reactions seen many vaccines, side effects present within two months trial periods. uk opened schools 8th March. shops selling food essential items open time. France less restrictive give less vaccine.  Likewise Sweden actually. field hospital Stockholm first wave never used. wrong say smokers?

idk might though  facts played out.  sort “facts” use arrive SiDeS conclusion? Yep makes sense, every dose going peoples arms fast possible. Teachers forced teach yet. prioritized teachers senior citizens live carehones live.

That guarantees deaths overall compared keeping kids person schools think whole pandemic taken toll everyone, think takes responsibility poor handling uk thats looks like. plenty people California, chronic illness, disabilities, barriers vaccination, still waiting get vaccinated,"" said Nancy Berlinger, bioethicist Hastings Center, research institute Garrison, New York.

you want vax guys get planes 2-3x WEEK.

please do. Lol quit trolling Probably every years. neutralizing titers vaccine produced antobodies Uk/SA/and Br variants lower still provide pretty robust protection.

Theoretically, might need boosters every years.

The P1 variant Brazil showing reinfection got sick previously, vaccine still appears work.

The people vaxxed stay vaxxed, less Covd spread, slower mutation rate be, longer take evolve escape vaccines. many people MS laughing vaccine, they've laughing entire pandemic. know people like almost everywhere, particularly rampant MS. ""just bad cold"" mindset popular one here. Americans consider state they're quarantining official, government-sanctioned process COVID-exposed people quarantine.

Places like Singapore Iceland dedicated facilities people need quarantine/isolate. Fauci knew masks work. saw happened MERS SARS. saw China South Korea doing. Everyone subreddit knew masks work back February 2020. 

I can’t forgive cutting message. pleasure! federal government handling distribution good thing. 

I honestly wouldn’t doubt states would hold onto doses keep people unvaccinated point. Hell, need reallocation within states too. NYS vaccination sites upstate always openings, south can't find anything.

Florida South Dakota implement restrictions surge last winter there's evidence excess deaths occurred due people unable get medical care.

Plus number people vaccinated currently, way hospitals would ever get overwhelmed virus mutated become deadly young people evade immunity. I’m 33 mine yesterday. passing community centre giving around 5pm asked spare said yes. You’re seeing opposite sides. 19 deaths zero tragic, 19 people lost lives, 19 families loved ones, etc. 19 deaths 1200 brilliant, 1181 people saved, 1181 families rejoice fact loved ones still them. pick side. Last days Berlin. dont know, EU screwed every turn comes vaccines far, Novavax said they're delaying vaccines EU, claimed supply issues, others saying EU working better deal, saying Novavax seen EU treated Astrazen scapegoat, yea right deal get would better have, dont know EU politicians playing lives citizens, shocking, pandemic really shown world broken nations emergency.

It also doesnt help nations EU saying vaccines arent safe, first France said one 55 believe take Astrazan, one 55, take it, 55's, last weeks blocked bloodclots, Italian government admit blocked political reasons UK, EU going find reason blame others failures this, wonder long normal citizens stand honest. bottom line. height arrogance puts many people unnecessary danger. Quite frankly much fun could be? 

Time break could utilized take small trips regional getaway spots crowded. Go chill woods days. Rent lake cottage. Take hike. Go cycling. Visit outdoor historical site interest. Go low traffic museum. Stay home tackle home improvement project. 

Are unimaginative free time equate beach beach? Woah now.. sure?! public health measures evenly (or nearly so) impacted groups fewer hospitalizations deaths would otherwise doesn’t mean can’t still surge them. 

This sub tends waaaaaay overestimate impact vaccine rollout. US 15% population fully vaccinated. That’s nowhere near enough don’t worry increase cases. negative take think supported facts. I'm much rationalist anyone else, watching closely see businesses start shutter support starts go away.

But Fed projecting 6% GDP growth rate year, unemployment support pretty robust rest year (and imagine extended rate remains high later year). think woods means, expect least people's situations continue improve year. US something selfless? going happen imho. Fair enough, I’m sure there’s stuff like that. know partner gets massages help back sometimes. get kind annoyed people want pretend whatever course action desire perfectly fine. Schools, indoor dining, travel, whatever people need assure ""fine"". None fine everyone vaccinated. things worth associated risk, magically absolved risk. I'm even saying NJ made wrong choice, people die based decisions, maybe frame brainers. think question related AZ vs covid, topic random blood clotting somewhat interesting one look think pharmacy want handle extra doses. past month SoCal they've waitlists they'll call/txt ppl come &amp; sign up. said they're forgoing approach first come, first serve end-of-the-day leftovers (like friend) since priority tiers lifted waiting lists get long &amp; cumbersome. would assume percentages people catching COVID Brazil would changing? vaccination campaign great say least. I've going Mega years (since 2006!) always managed avoid dreaded ""con flu"".

I'm already vaccinated I'll still mask decide go, plus masking already accepted activity cons due cosplay. saying let spread people chance get shot? even know long term affects getting covid yet. Plenty people desperately want get sick watching numbers skyrocket irresponsible behavor. experts like Dr Facci saying still careful over. irresponsible selfish take less seriously before. probably is, three months past. trump get vaccine 3 months covid diagnosis sooner? hope wave last. Really want us bring end coronavirus pandemic reach herd immunity Again, level “safe normal” different every country; map travel notices CDC help understand “while country may way full swing recovery, location want visit may inhibited lack carefulness cause they’re yet.” Ok, vaccinated people stop wearing masks would also push unvaccinated people stop wearing what? Great thank uncle joe friendly reminder : aristocracy demolished, common people eligible it. chart linked show Pfizer Moderna vaccines less effective neutralizing P1 relative prior variants. sure bottom line don’t see reported MSM. someone confirm means?? acting like entire population US military get vaccinated this. considered experimental reserved extreme cases. never vaccine deployed public like that. I'm talking mild side effects nice try straw man argument. I'm talking overemphasizing extreme side effects turn makes puts public availability biased mindset. misinformation works conduit it. Yes babies experience psychosomatic symptoms proxy parents. think babies pick phone self-reports? hi, I'm baby uh experiencing fever muscle cramps. mention I'm baby?"" FL TX definitely.... they're past caring outbreaks point. think anything July 4th Open-Up states go. may implement seat distancing/occupancy restrictions, may not. think regions serve litmus test see resilient vaccines new variants. Lateral flow tests useful, numbers get low (and we're many tests) create noise data. ""When they're sending people, they're sending best!"" I’m confused lmao. Yeah, first shot nothing either. even sore arm. I've flu shots hurt less jab. scared. little bit suffering 95% personal protection afterwards. small cost. Probably herd immunity actually away, especially supply issues. 
It's nearly exclusively second doses April government plan says end July everyone's first dose, means could end October time every adult second dose.

It's yet totally clear herd immunity kicks fully open society, could mean we're waiting almost October.


The government seems focusing hospitilisation rate seems smart, hospitilisations high enough overrun hospitals let virus run reduced-impact course let summer happen, year younger people shielded protect vaccinated elderly deserve return normal. think read 85% people surveyed France said would decline vaccine Unions cling pensions benefit older members retirees system long enough avoided early-2000s pension reforms. Additionally, depending state, pensions may still actually quite good (thinking state - New York), despite significantly reduced. 
 
Also slippery slope mentality play - pension goes, it’s hard argue things also go - tenure, summer/spring break, testing, strong health benefits, etc. Unions exist advocate members, district/state. 🤷🏻‍♂️ British response. says that? Covid + excess deaths since covid 800k+ rn America. Please favor shut fuck adults handle this. Lol ok KenM Actually February 1st, 41 million doses AstraZeneca vaccine sent EU 33 countries, largest chunk sent UK, sent US, export ban 19 deaths UK. Terrible lot less month ago. Vaccines work. “Even” mean ‘real’ death toll? Absolutely, it’s crazy infection. 

My point basically majority severe COVID cases would end death without medical intervention. Think people required supplemental oxygen, even intubation. % people would succumbed COVID without supplemental oxygen?  right - that's modern day usage tends rooted imperialism (notice one really uses 2nd world, always 1st 3rd). 'Weeks ago' UK even vaccinating people 12 weeks. think idea math people dying mind betting big part difference places like Vietnam (35 deaths) Mexico (400,000+) Vietnam good rationally calculating effective strategy. Viruses really care feelings running numbers choosing effective policy work. lying you...

I know you’re finding difficult one listens lies spew UK anymore. actions EU utterly broken narrative. welcome spend day night spamming nonsense try spin back direction sadly days over. Mexico needs ban foreign travelers, shut like Japan, New Zealand etc ruinous ruin ruiners, going around running ruins. you’re missing point. Indian lives India (the country u say one fastest growing GDPs) knows conditions average person majority says India poor, India poor 

fastest growing doesn’t equate wealth. could growing 100% year-on-year, still means it’s 1% GDP per capita US, still doesn’t make India rich either you’re comparing two makes US look like dream.

Elderly people robbed year seeing grandkids. Adults robbed year time good health. Young adults robbed year pre-children/marriage freedom. Students robbed year socializing new experiences. Children robbed year proper social development.

I'm pretty fucking miserable whole situation, I'm even close worst-off. government figures aren’t correct first line comment replied maybe fair chunk: Improved ventilation alone silver bullet safely reopening schools. part ""layered approach"" also includes wearing masks keeping children socially distanced. “Good world” 

“Ok world” 

“Bad world” Yes. UK obviously putting aside Pfizer vaccines second doses now. would super irresponsible to, think?

The extension dosing regime 12 weeks give bigger window build stock whilst still vaccinating many people possible.

The UK's Astrazenica vaccines produced domestically, therefore 2nd dose availability less concern. However also contracted 10million doses India would let carry giving first doses good rate whilst also giving 2nd doses. doses delayed, AZ supply crunch weeks. don’t know - telling - know extensive prominent media coverage AZ clots long anyone understood mechanism, yet zero prominent coverage Pfizer clots. can’t retrofit explanations bias. won’t wash. Emmanuel Macron says hi. much misinformation. Innocent civilians affected single sentence. wish knew power President's words carry. Barça short name football team, short name city Barna (no one ever says Barcelona anymore).

I expect Barna become official name two three generations.  Yep, pretty much. experience either. Barely anyone subreddit does. dumb thing say. since 50% “most population”? It’s simple, made big claim data doesn’t support said. Random citizens prop government give broad support. Look Putin's popularity Russia. Obviously can't take polling face value, extremely popular two things. relative prosperity Russia Putin compared predecessors, sanctions would address, fact thumbs nose west, sanctions would also provide consequence for.

The people country absolved actions government. start putting cages India invent hiv/aids medicine then? Certainly guys going modern days robin hood. pharmaceutical company spend huge money research guys want free, guys still want sell back Europe America drive invented medicine business? sorry logic beyond absurd.

And guys banned export covid vaccine save lives? lmao. so, authentic. lol.

You can't. I’ll definitely going lot restaurants next bars covid eradicated daily concern. resurgence there’s lot people like money spend saving year. 

So next phase boon small business owners think. might less great large corporations people flock experiences opposed things. big business largely creates things experiences.

Basically think there’s lot money sidelines flood things bit someday. might see inflation result would end party quickly though. I'm confused. big deal hundreds people gather outdoors massive ruin site? thought risk transmission kind environment extremely low? Sebastian Ugarte, runs intensive care unit Santiago’s Indisa clinic, said every bed facility, even though number critical care units nearly doubled 70, already vaccinated, almost disappeared emergency rooms,”** Ugarte told Al Jazeera younger patients, gravely ill.”**

My sister got back Mexico. trip tells us ""I'm going Mexico"" well that's great idea ""I'm vaccinated""

JFC disappointed her. fucking chemist too, know better! Please keep him, really want back! Vet here. Good luck. I’ve trying local VA hospital weeks. Apparently problem billing system can’t vaccinate people enrolled VA care would generate invoice (even though vaccine free). Nice President moving Heaven earth get people vaccinated holdup problem billing system. Hopefully they’ll straighten August. SMH. Wow, that’s super impressive. Uptake problem (Canada). Long term care home workers barely 50%, even high % older folks aren’t signing Yeah 2 weeks went back uni pretty much everyone accommodation Israeli here. lot young folks (16-30) say shit won’t hurt wouldn’t take experimental vaccination. stuck 55% total vaccination lot young people won’t bothered. Luckily lot establishments employers demand showing vaccination approvals number actual anti vaxxers manifest within month so. Awesome! flattened curve. vulnerable get vaccinated stay home be.

Motherless fucks act like they’re first ones think Spring Break Mexico like they’re gonna go douchey pseudo spiritual “new age healing” convention Tulum. One hardest hit groups Sweden comes Covid-19 deaths Finns. Also there's excess deaths, somewhat reasonable say people would probably died anyway. tell data doesn’t support it. Every healthcare professionals tell mask up, social distance don’t change behavior 1 week 2nd shot. people see large number downvotes join without even looking comment people think country 139 million people depends turism? Lol see happening, Russia already said deaths could 5 times higher reporting, Brasil, well went insane getting worse daily, dont understand countries hiding true numbers, gain so. dying... Yeah I've seen well, like people think someone certain age gets sick automatically younger person's fault even older person taking precautions keep 19 deaths per day becomes manageable. would point return normal. guess also depends hospitalisations etc, along chance resurgence.  really wish worldometers somebody would start tracking excess deaths well. Russia released excess death figures last year saying 3x higher official covid deaths. knowledge none aggregator websites show that. public health measures applied placebo group vaccine group. That's compared get efficacy number. Real world effectiveness long term may vary probably much. That's OTT. world people spare, trust me.  Interesting. I’d guess summer, they’d let vaccinated Americans, knows. open vaccinated people now.. median income US 33K USD. median income India 1.7K USD. Also europeans there. wealthy countries like UK US start get situations control

I agree, US control. keep hearing, cases rising various states. US 100% **cannot** start sending vaccines country. Requiring quick teat entering public spaces might better. don’t care people vaccinated, want know they’re contagious. Quick, cheap tests exist using instead passport checks would avoid ethical concerns. Yes! possible skin may allergic reaction vaccine injection site, unlikely happen first. 
If happen, would anticipate additional swelling, skin irritation possibly rash. We’ll see. People saying case counts going instead they’re ticking going crazy places like Michigan. agree. They're asking many questions point. Good luck you. I've heard people giving friends relatives car ride vaccination centre getting vaccinated themselves.  know know yet.. saying exist basically like saying covid exist. guy dismisses everything. South Korea less 300 miles away China. epicenter pandemic. China largest trading partner. flight China South Korea costs $239. People flying South Korea last 9 months. 

The guy pretending US everything right Canadians Mexicans constantly bringing virus borders problem. 

The fact remains earlier action, masking beginning, effective lockdowns would helped save us worst consequences.

In state Wisconsin, didn’t mask mandate late July, waited 2 weeks sent kids back college. seeded spike cases saw Wisconsin rest country. failed policy around. worn masks day one, shutdown bars needed, schools cases got control; wouldn’t seen 550k deaths. 

It poor management anti mask herd immunity crowd wanted shove virus throats ones blame mess. 

It crazy till day people like can’t learn anything. can’t point South Korea acted quickly effective testing contact tracing strategy early see failed miserably done better. :( supply production handle kind demand, never going be. lot factories running full tilt demand healthcare alone exhausting it. Pfizer FDA approval kids 16 up. states opened vaccinations people ages 16 right follow. Clinical trials run kids now. seriously considerung disinfecting wallpaper? 1 year pndemic people still dont know virus spreads. Smh

Can keep anti mask/vax hot takes here, please? totally shocked asked friend would get vaccine. vaccinated.

This man consistently worn masks, used hand sanitizer, socially distanced last year. careful.

He said going wait trust vaccine yet. long enough period side effects happened. Yeh FDA approved..just emergency use authorization,,but still looks like good risk get vaccinated. 

I want wait 3 4 years see long term side effects. shocked aware potential severity covid still delay. agree, symbolism much anything. ""During March 1–December 31, 2020, state-issued mask mandates applied 2,313 (73.6%) 3,142 U.S. counties.

There two groups can’t get vaccine: people allergic 16. 

Under 16 problem since it’s fairly large group. it’s really much dangerous influenza age group. Less kids died COVID died flu 2018-19 flu season. It’s contagious flu, country vaccinated. 

Those allergic lockdown anti-vaxxers get infected high enough rate get heard immunity. trial? Yea one dose seems pretty well me. tested positive Tuesday (asymptomatic) signed study would test daily. first sample collected came back negative Thursday I've negative since.  part country? Cases matter restrictions. Deaths hospitalizations do. lock cases, locked hospitals get run. venerable protection, need restrictions. 

Do care may people cold sores? No! even 300 million cases almost one dies. new cases people already vaccinated lower risk age groups, cares? Cases matter now. Well think alternative concert see appeal hardly balances information.  couple posts day needed, least. downvotes ridiculous -- people downvoting accurate information like it. confirmation bias, negative thing. yet we’re still full lockdown I’m saying that’s think, I’m saying that’s people think see people cry “surge” every week, makes look unreliable act surprised nobody listens something actually happening. god please let soon Watching band crowd faceless people sounds horrible. haven’t concert since January 2020 sea vibrant people huge part experience. TIL terrorism airborne infectious disease. downvoting negative news, simple fact highly unlikely Michigan (or state matter will) deaths hospitalizations rise match used given obvious change circumstances. get handle soon crazy variant could produced vaccines handle. It’s get Reddit/Discord moderators real life.

They get genuine pleasure policing people wearing masks depressed longer feel morally right yell people. totally agree, worth keeping mind ""terrible"" equivalent ""average"" west. courts decide that; you. always catch Con-Crud. cosplay job, frowned upon wear mask, really wish people would take care conventions Lol according sub America place people parties lockdown ignore mask mandates... That's people Covid last 30 days too, could run bus time kind anyway, that's comfort course fact Cuomo give date universal eligibility ridiculous. California, Texas, Florida states larger populations date universal eligibility. know they'll enough NY doesn't?  That's crazy cause though words bruh. realize go concerts pay attention band politicians fucked vaccination programme, face choice telling people thought close vaccinated free actually go back another tough lockdown, taking popular decision lockdown letting cases totally spiral control. Macron latter right now. relieved, went first yesterday found getting J&amp;J! one shot, need wait 4 weeks full immunity. It’s like “get jail free” card! see. do, I'll concede wrong.

Well conceded wrong plateau, I've already proven wrong. I'm hopeful. seem bad case confirmation bias. common problem. think universal great step honestly. Otherwise run risk fakes. helps one 19 deaths low could easily reporting error. it’s likely 19 pretty old ill. It’s safe say things really changed UK that’s good thing. Mind you, there’s still delays death reports it’s likely we’ll 100. great. talking stuff like this, remember certain segment population DUMB, sadly sometimes need cater them. 

Most people get vaccinated don’t want disease, understand herd immunity. non-zero amount people stupid won’t get vaccine don’t think anything change. people exist, kind need tell “things change get shot.”

Unfortunately, moronic policies like helping anything. actually bad public policy standpoint. OP couple others exactly that. Literally got first pfizer dose 1 hour ago! (California)

On top world!

LETS GOOOOO! Yes not. vaccines required college different yeah

when get vax mail.. game indeed move dramatically alter vaccine distribution, also tested form ***a tablet.*** ""That game-changer,"" said Biovac CEO Morena Makhoana.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

...albeit little late. 

it make boosters we're probably going need much could vaccine manufacturing capability **in little three years** deal local pharmaceutical firm Biovac US vaccine developer comes fruition. forget year bud? People want face truth, simple. No. not. I'm pretty confident husband fortunate able pretty strictly self isolate last year. post needs higher. risk benzene exposure pretty negligible, definitely outweighed risk infectious agents. major difference? people vaccinated January February immunity. prohibited traveling? They’ve part protect others.

I understand unvaccinated people wearing masks traveling around fucked up. believe stage, people made mind whether get vaccine anti vaccine anti mask crowd still travel dicks it. Sucks ruin play nice.  Seasonality. see lot posting actually, maybe couple day? weird isnt concern it. absolutely concerning. Confirmation bias never healthy whether positive negative. Source? Replying seriously anyone citing Nuremberg non-research context waste breath, applaud nonetheless. 3 week lag.

Had 3 week lag affecting completely non-vaccinated population. continue increase, instant.

We'll see. do, I'll concede wrong. keep claiming ""plateau"". 26% increase plateau.

Please look raw data. 7 day average deaths Michigan peaked around 125. going 18 23 2 weeks definitely plateau, trend similar cases. anything think still reopening little soon. point it’s tough act government balance people’s willingness follow guidance vs completely following science (for once) Awesome!

I think I'm getting one soon... registered said they'll get back maybe I'll part second third? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Wouldn’t unfair then? Especially we’re vaccination passes grocery store, target, restaurants, cafes etc. fair ban unvaccinated population activities? Especially asked young people put social lives hold work pandemic put bottom vaccination priority. 

Why keep social distancing masks still access basic establishments it’s turn. turn, shouldn’t everyone else opportunity get whole thing irrelevant? much logistical ethical ambiguity justify requiring vaccination passes enter basic establishments. told vaccinations way normal, normal don’t know won’t permanent. posting thing multiple times per day, everyday. almost like people notice folks peddle bad news.  Thanks. Looking sheet, seems jive number exactly. Cell G95 - ""Raw First Doses/Day Increase"" 2,148,504. Cell J95 - ""Total Doses/Day Increase"" 3,496,047. Taking two: 2,148,504 / 3,496,047 = 61.4%. 

I'm talking daily number, proportion total first doses doses administered. 91M/140M (total first doses / total doses) 65% number mentioned. *expect* number continuously go base fully vaccinated people goes up. wish public medical policy wasn’t fodder ridiculous “debate,” yes. Yes vaccinated student populace mask sight. “Americans” way refer people US, correct term them? widely recognized way refer citizens United States America?

Norteamericanos, estadounidenses, yanquis, gringos common options. county went around 60-70 cases day weeks solid low mid 100s 200 350 yesterday. blips. I’m glad vaccines rolling really felt like stumbling across finish line. rolling back many workplace protocols masks getting less less.  I’d fine June vaccine offered time still 1a. chose celebrate defeat virus Gregorian Easter, Julian Easter. We'll MUCH better spot then. No, absolutely right, good indication overall effect pandemic - deaths directly attributable virus, guy died heart attack bed intensive care.  think also people vaccinated stop getting tested. literally already vaccine cards schools international travel submission linking oann.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* absolutely nothing 'anti-vax'. can't get vaccine Europe anyway, people's personal opinions irrelevant politicians fucked up

I zero interest defending government AZ also continually fucking up. Feels like there's new damning headline every week. Fair enough, there's still chance exposure people that's enough them.

I'm okay public schools, even though nuances like religious/philosophical exemptions. think there's big difference letting big corporation know vaccination history information. I'm uncomfortable that. know can't deal COVID way pandemics... Yes, know novel, yes certain things change (if sick, please call work, yay washing hands more), I'm comfortable shit. swine flu ebola? sounds great hopefully individual EMR apps acceptable proof rather utilizing universal passport. No, 50% previously covid. 20% based blood testing donation testing. way going, vaccine 2022 Coronavirus poses significant long-term threat vaccinated.

We know yet. know headed towards becoming endemic disease stay us, continue evolve time. know coronaviruses evolve quickly flu, far existing vaccines provide level protection recent variants. extrapolate claim certainty future variant pose threat currently vaccinated folks. really hope require masks. plan going mass gatherings require masks Chill FFS. Without ability include risk factors predictions, predictions valueless.

Stop pretending experts fields yall aren't. 1,000 people dying every day, vulnerable protected.

Just someone’s eligible mean they’ve able get shot. someone’s gotten shot mean they’ve developed immunity yet. think happen five six years? one posted known case: 
 I'm sure clots, apparently 0 platelets left. unavoidable. I'm letting people know check dates reschedule want to. doesnt. still spread virus vaccinated. Don’t think evaluated companies, bars, event venues, schools, etc decide enter, work, eat, drink sports somewhere. traditional yellow book serves tool governments quick check border (seldomly done actually, yellow books rarely checked). energy seems like would best spent elsewhere, like said, you. Increasing evidence shows it’s fine especially since first shots efficacy super high alone. risk would immunity fades away time seems might really case. Everyone still get second shot however absolutly sure immune long term sure you’re downvoted - you’re right.

Imagine getting covid two weeks vaccination assholes want dine indoors Wendy’s. actually disservice abstaining, context greater population

you can't say boxes vaccine collecting dust shelves - there's neglected syringe sitting tray waiting forever home.

the disservice ""society"" can't manifest injections snatched fast they're thawed.. ""society"" arms - one belongs right here?

where live? 

what's case rate?

how many beds full?

what's area's uptake %?

what % area one shots?

what friend (for living)?

what mask/social distancing etiquette?

how many random people friend exposed daily basis? might retesting? although I'm sure benefit retesting someone ICU (maybe want make sure covid continued damage organ damage looking for?)

I imagine quite rare though since 28 days counted positive test date, going hospital tested basically 28 days hospital admission. No, won’t fix personalities ""In particular, Lurie others urging Biden administration make plans getting surplus U.S. covid vaccine supplies overseas Americans vaccinated""

Reading actual article helpful.  don’t know.  vaccines aren’t FDA approved. They’re used emergency use authorizations. know correctly vaccinated person forming immune structures responsible years decades worth protection. 

Israel study efficacy first dose Pfizer. found high efficacy right second dose. UK betting single dose delayed months, we’ll know subject them. never said concrete absolute confirmed evidence, evidence pointing way. absolutely agree continue distance wear masks, I'm saying evidence pointing towards fully vaccinated people able asymptomatically spread covid. many vaccines sale, major producers export bans equivalent policies (US UK) considering (EU), rest really vaccines sell scale (Russia China). [like read first comment see simple heads let people know. happened afterwards lol? proceeded get numerous replies people arguing reason.

I've never lived global pandemic before. find second dose life-saving vaccine meet official recommendation, I'm going try let others know. likely get vaccine soon. last tier myself(stay home mom health issuses) got first vaccine week Missouri! Get second three weeks. also haven’t going wait able live life again! seeing grandparents first time year next month can’t wait! become desirable someone sticks needle forcibly? lame reason 

""I use Airbnb credit"" 


Literally could used home state vacation rental. need get one plane spread virus around. bet people state also need tourism money. Maybe stay lockdown forever Id even biggest majority /r/Coronavirus, views absolutely represent average American. everyone wants vaccine gotten chance one really reason wear masks. anti vaxxers decide they'd rather risk that's them. hold opinion could potentially kids 16 vaccines yet long someone around kids really reason keep masks assuming person vaccinated. mask required don’t see problem then. things change. God bless India! Interesting. definitely makes sense restrictions place. 596,618 patients 16 years older vaccinated, first dose 46% effective COVID-19 infection 14 20 days later 92% effective 7 days second 14 days. feel people forget horrible AMLO pandemic. telling people worry wear mask. complete failure leader dwarfed Trump's. That's reason see received much criticism. 19 covid deaths UK much you, compare flu deaths last years please. aware, 10'000 - 20'000 people die flu UK? April 12th first major restriction change (Tomorrow outdoor sports etc).

It's bit slow think government wanting cautious since severely lacked caution last year (opening soon closing back late caused really bad second wave).

I think people fine late opening really last time Sounds like you’re living fear. don’t blame you, could try influence others it. little passport thing might nothing you, others red line shouldn’t crossed. One thing realized normalized WFH going mean people spending outside home. It’s much easier tourist work remotely day. Science works using facts current knowledge. None mutations really proved beat prior immunity yet. literally asking people wear masks Anyone doesn’t get vaccine “antivaxxer”... lmao. You’re fucking moron. Showing contempt humans actually enjoying lives, huh?

Real piece work, are. lowering age 5 weeks age group eligible. took lower age groups last week. Pretty sus ask me. ...knowing would take 6 9 months best case vaccine. yes, well done enough done situation time. publicly discussed ""natural herd immunity"". Feb disease everywhere. Carehomes. Hospitals. Schools. whole population. take disease three months get Wuhan UK. 2019 everywhere Feb gov way slow reacting. feel otherwise, great, enjoy day. feel Gov everything right ten years forced austerity somehow put NHS stronger position deal pandemic. Great. Enjoy yourself.

In world live in, nothing throwing money vaccines enough early days pandemic. Read fucking article

You what’s wrong news

You made shit fucking link That’s can’t nice things generally undesirable people around. substitute “Amazon” Walmart, McDonalds giant corporations thrived past year. Even $15 hour, live major metro area, need 3-4 roommates roof head. Right second shot, stopping bank deposit card safety deposit box. Raw number absolutly means nothing. matters percentage young people contracting variant die/severe illness 

Young people contact and/or saying fuck caring thus getting sick, doesn’t mean ifr higher problem anyone say medically exempt don’t need proof forcing one disclose specific condition violation HIPPA. mask usage, documented medical reason can’t wear mask vaccines. 

Are starting see legal mess? longterm care worker unwilling take vaccine, fit job.

Unfortunately large percentage industry, coveted jobs. bored. Looking numbers seeing data actually says instead scared nothing. end April state vaccinated everyone wants shot. suspect country same. good guess, based data President's expectations.

We get back normal ASAP cost enormous waiting longer. I’m sure they’ll prevalent sure, especially think lot people wear work flu season. also want work healthcare future I’m fine wearing them. 

I don’t think it’ll government mandated past Q2 next year though, unless something drastically changes variants renders vaccine useless. Lol. India far urban. 60% population rural density health care centers really poor. Logistics yet caught vaccine production capacity. opposite problem western world, production capacity catching logistics. delaying shipments delaying signing contract believe. Unfortunately everyone flying blind mostly we're learning lessons NEXT pandemic. valuable one day, less right now. slight nitpick, 85% either vaccinated recovered. recently dropped excess deaths yes.

&amp;#x200B;

December, January Febuary pretty bad excess deaths though (I think totalling 60,000+ excess deaths across ""second wave"") wouldn’t call stupid. can’t expect people’s put lives hold 2+ years. however long it’s going be. point move on. Idiots Things different now.


WFH normalized, people time spend money outside house. got first Pfizer dose Walgreens fine 4 week gap. Take business elsewhere problem it.  28 days well within range 42 days. sure freaking this. we’re trying tell it’s end world miss second shot day days, weeks. Pfizer said window lengthened bit doses. Dad missed second shot date week supply constraints, didn’t come Reddit timing warrior knew slight delay wouldn’t impact effectiveness vaccine. 

But means, makes feel you’re making difference enjoy flustered small things, you. think could also psychological testing every 2 months, prove terrorist thoughts. get freedom pass.

That would weed extremists airports large concerts. Forget politics, proud work scientists do. get enough credit media talking groundbreaking work vaccine available, everyone said: never force vaccine passport onto people, civic liberties rights respected. Now: fuck that, let’s vaccine passports let’s pressure everyone getting vaccine. slippery slope already begun slipping. Fact is: you’re forced vaccine injected body -nobody’s decision yours- life without become impossible. Lol 31 here. behind ya! Even President wearing masks. going happen anytime soon. yeah, urge sign theater series; pact w/ husband attend one concert month; etc.

But even though get laid off, much money spend! make decent salary low housing costs area. forgot Brits happy escape rules &amp; regulations specifically wear mask Mexico Australia NZ, two ISLANDS took proactive approach locked couple hundred cases, great comparison friend! nothing preventing EU countries source vaccines outside EU agreements. Several EU countries done this. Yeah read it. Sounds like might bit put mud slung astrazeneca unlikely experience bad side effects anyone brings something differs believe “triggered”? Seriously asking? LOL, amusing it? totally unintentional app acting silly. Maybe simple case follow leader. Yeah map thumbnail give clues. says vaccine passports won’t exemptions legitimately cannot vaccinated due medical reasons? wonder get COVID 9 days instead 10, fucked lol evictions hit Still way way slow. really need get vaccines approved mass produced take years get Covid control globally. According NYT tracker 23 vaccines phase 3 trials hopefully successful join global fight sooner rather later. Lmao they're even mandatory states right now, wearing masks, yes. I’m fully vaccinated still wore damn mask time public. kind right, then, something like 86-87% 16+ population either vaccinated recovered. Among non ultraorthodox non Arabs 94% 16+. 

Most taken vaccines indeed young, overall uptake pretty great. surprised click read wasn’t Urk (again). Dude lol. need mental help. Go seek professional help get reddit. America already fully opening places. Masks minor inconvenience another months. shit June/July latest. started vaccine investment planning February... Lol yeah. wonder part I’m getting “older” can’t party best em wanted to. Haha. Empathy ""Please wear shirt"" incredibly different ""Please inject something even approved FDA body want go grocery shopping."" I'm fully support vaccine makes blood boil. kind bullshit reason people consider vaccination efforts dystopian get thank God position authority. Granted Cuomo's team clearly much better. Right! Perfect. You’re getting there. 

So also what’s called ADA, similar court ruling protecting citizens medical disabilities ensuring receive rights treatment without. 

If physically/medically cannot vaccinated due circumstances entirely control, different rights healthy. It’s illegal. 

It protected class like race gender. helloo anyone know Japan Korea poorly terms vaccination? According they're sitting .3% .8% vaccinated respectively. comparison India, China Russia around 2-4%, EU 7-9%. get Covid bad Japan SK roll still seems really slow compared basically every developed country. 3 million doses 3 days row, old 3 3 deal can’t spread anything. They’re constantly tested, antibodies, vaccinated, combination 3. entirely accurate. first plan build natural herd immunity. people pointed many lives would cost started talking lockdowns vaccines.

They also sold PPE China early 2020 profit none carehomes. Carehomes got exposed elderly folk transferred back hospitals zero tests precautions.

They knew vaccine would minimum 6/9 months away saying started planning early fantastic, always going little late. population people die vaccinated now

They aren’t. little less 50% people 65 fully vaccinated today (and that’s population really needs second dose get full protection). 

Remember bad New York’s first wave was? result 20-25% population catching virus. still PLENTY vulnerable unvaccinated people around let another wave make significant impact. Spring break end people consider low risk enough lockdowns. exodus work local spring break. Sure, places like Florida got lot attention lot non-college students traveled. Oregon, testing gone nearly 10% last two weeks positivity rate down. seems indicator leisure testing moreso exposure. going depend. grocery store probably can't survive requiring it. theme park? Concert venues? Unlikely, there's ticketing process. Excursions? Luxury hotels buffets? Cruise ships? starting get businesses suffer PR outbreaks closures. Plus UK giving good vaccines. *The seditious traitor Ted Cruz I'm professional musician yes please please pay us money Pfizer Moderna? hi dad 49 shop worker, really wants vaccine feels unsafe. can’t book appointment yet, could get one asap? UK death ""giving up""?  Alright New York. Time open April 15 disrespectful? immoral feel happy thousands lives saved, tens died? immoral mourn tens dead thousands lives saved? disrespectful celebrate birth child, person dies time room over? immoral mourn death loved one, next room child born?

I’m saying either view *the correct one*. want opinion, I’d argue views equally valid.

I understand argument maybe sides feel closer metaphorical ‘middle ground’, disrespect side. then, also take issue use ‘tragedy’ original commenter? think issue vary widely person person, based everyone’s situation. took seriously, height suggestion leaving home go work supermarket. Nothing like Chinese restrictions.

That's accurate. Lockdown measures Da Nang recently Quang Ninh similar Chinese lockdown measures. quite severe Wuhan, people could leave Da Nang month, people allowed leave homes every days buy essential  Many ancient wars quite long well, stretching decades. Hundred Year War set three 20 years more, Eighty Year War that, War Roses 30 years, Greco-Persian War 40 That’s good thing. Young people getting it, recovering, gaining natural immunity.

“Zero COVID” fantasy. 

I don’t want grandkids sacrifice youth account. Kindly point [Mexico travel says Americans allowed cross border. lots googling last summer, like early data BioNtech Moderna knew I’d seeing Covid daily work wanted get involved, knew real thing first dose really sore Sounds rough, hope turns around soon. get corona get corona. Haha! I’d personally want see good track trace place.
Personally I’d risk scientific experiment they’re closely monitoring well maybe strict conditions chance concerts future? we're 2 weeks away finding work need lockdown CDC: ""42 days allowed You’re leaving rent moratorium lifted, people still owe 18 months back rent, meaning best case scenario, they’ll rent increased 50% landlords recoup costs. people living rentals living check check, evictions really haven’t happened yet, kick overdrive.

As GDP growth, exactly help someone that’s work year? guess drive Doordash, since companies mainly contributing growth, running nearly full speed since May, you’ll available consumers.

It’s bleak picture, lot people haven’t lives ruined yet, white knuckled summer/fall 2021. Hell good chance they’re related instance.

Only much do, within 28 days perfectly adequate figure. die day 29 included, get wiped bus day 27. draw line somewhere dealing thousands cases every day. CDC: ""42 days allowed Meanwhile florida open, beaches busy people living like nothing happening

Watched guy explore Amish / mennonite community florida, hundreds playing yard bowling one seems care.. messed I'll check out, thanks!

I'm 100% wanna dedicate going since money's tight year heard guest announcements yet, main reason go Mega. CDC: ""42 days allowed think meant regarding businesses employees, consumers. “perhaps”, is. Hahaha.

Once again, one decides point exactly? want taken court deemed unconstitutional? spoiler alert be.

Maybe be. hasn’t happened also hard time taking one confidence seriousness wrote statement “legality law”

I haven’t said that. Read comments again. hope First-dose vaccinated 3 weeks ago (most efficacy). Second dose week. Still wearing mask essential places like grocery stores gas stations people go CDC: ""42 days allowed We're close finish line feel celebratory mood maybe month premature. UK variant, states going one last flameout cases (case study example: Michigan) things normalize. 

It look anything scale like winter surge - fortunately LTC facility vaccinations elderly populations prioritized - deaths worst continue plateau rather rise... going die end tragic preventable deaths given light end tunnel close. Tbf taken year fix massive cockup full lockdown feb 2020. Even 5% lot protection. Death rate close 0. 5% get milder infection. 

If enough people get vaccinated, they’ll protected heard immunity.   China us? exactly. hate see news channels fear-monger cases suddenly spiking big cities.

The weather getting warmer, people naturally incentive go outside. Also, young people unvaccinated, except underlying conditions. stop complaining promote vaccine more. think people willing spend another spring summer locked up, away family friends. 

except Europe course. screwed vaccine drive paying consequences. governments also abusing powers keeping citizens locked keep mind states like FL SD. Even emergency stricter mandates Winter Surge California de-prioritize care non-emergency patients, emergency patients would've transferred regional medical centers advanced treatment delayed days. Every state follow different path based local conditions. that's fine imo. Texas FL SD choose prioritize different constituents. lot people lie mates medical conditions have, plain like believe high risk patients.

 
Had tell many teenagers clinically extremely vulnerable big chunk always say they're fine. Well medical record test results say otherwise :D Surprise surprise, that's happens reopen without enough people vaccinated know smart may be, capable using critical thinking skills, research takes account raw data source, interpretations variety scientists, rather swallowing mainstream media's biased interpretations ""science"" without question. recommendation recommendation, law. every country ever traveled to, US State Dept. ""recommended"" Americans go ""dangerous"". Adults able make risk assessments, freedom movement guaranteed human right. grown ass adults want travel, taking precautions like wearing masks vaccinated, really one else's business. Again, scared, stay home. Comon... odd. Rather celebrate incredible scientific achievement, government response (since Jan) flawed could worse want doom gloom Karenest Karens traveling right I'm surprised  true, depends area. 24 w/ underlying conditions mine couple weeks ago now, luck draw seems. issue. appointments opened group, booked first could Walgreens three hour drive away. stores started getting doses, able find second dose CVS much much closer. seem mind all. got make sure brand vaccine same. Nah. I’d rather go ones require vaccination proof. would want surrounded anti vaxxers? can’t give another month? Colorado great vaccine program. worth trying end day. friend mine weeks ago took details could call back next time. absolutely lock several weeks areas, including entire cities time two provinces, confirmed cases. People allowed leave homes except essential purposes, travel allowed. countries, response probably similar There's 4th wave one, infection rate never went down. would say odds favor 'during-pandemic roaring 20s'.

It ain't over, folks. matter much want be. N.Y. one. I’m sure states fed follow.  We're also gold standard anymore lot tools keep things stable. literally last year went least 3 separate women climbing onto ruins, tour guide told get acted mad bitter, extremely pissed. Fuck people like Masks forced Italy outside ten 14 months. kid not. agree, point think abandon AZ. I've going long time every years get it. gotten vaccine able get con. I'll also wearing mask regardless. check r/MegaCon. good info hard find wise. Assuming they’re retested can’t see not. assume ICU COVID would retested No... “perhaps”, is. Hahaha. 

What’s point exactly? want taken court deemed unconstitutional? *spoiler alert* be. 

But also hard time taking one confidence seriousness wrote statement “legality law” Nice! might start lurking round locals, although Wales seems mass vaccination centers gp live NY. coworker mine went Miami weekend, didn’t tell job going coming back work tomorrow. made whole plan lucky enough get first dose vaccine 5 days left Miami. parents sister high risk (my parents first dose done last week) I’m still comfortable going work week. Thinking calling till next Monday case. think it’ll like end April anyone able get day. absolutely problem that. I’m rip roaring ready go post vaccine, continue wear mask.

It problem anti maskers, though, even vaccinated still transmit virus. since don’t carry around flags say “I’m vaccinated”, folks don’t wear masks look like assholes  food prices stagnant wages. already one NY. finds database vaccinated tested negative people generates pass. get \~ 50% first shots, less double now. think happen early May. wearing mask.. dystopian Yes - definitely possible. worth, we'll definitely hit 75M doses administered month, may end shy number actually reported depending things land. 

Here's hoping 100M April. theoretically possible based expected deliveries existing inventory guess we're going run serious demand issues many states end April keep us achieving goal. able public Businesses require proof vaccine quickly find business ones don’t. Even vaccinated people turned asked show papers front door go next door not. someone dealing covid patients close personal since March last year, I'd like believe still doubts. would expect Mario say burned chicken cacciatore. novavax say delaying EU shipments? scheduled 1st dose April, hard find appointments Arizona :( Awesome news get point, meant actually rich people, governments, employers, corporations, etc, give shit employees/people use generate revenue expense health. I'm Belgium, saw big corporations use excuse Covid lay lot employees financial danger. extra workload forced remaining employees, can't handle it, company still care. comic book industry pissed expected work thanksgiving thanks ignorance timing. normal thanksgiving matter corona situation is.  confirm vobid symptoms almost disappeared since got vaccine, damn actually go short walk now. best well...it sucks, know we'll get it. everyone would willing make necessary sacrifices. medical discrimination. It’s pretty simple thing understand definitely don’t para legal get it. Lol

Perhaps, courts final say like don’t judge know kill one unprovoked... that’s murder?

Trials exist reason. may *think* someone killed unprovoked, could also case arrived scene crime late without seeing full context. That’s courts exist; deciders. aren’t. endzone. It’s haven’t responded. IME tend areas people also careless elsewhere too. it’s hard say. kids 10 13 better adults, least public setting. 0 realistic. would great one died. would love still see patients, family members, friends passed on. reality.

Ignoring fact dangerous. sets policies like ""if saves one life"" looks one specific cause death ignores costs associated trying accomplish something hard reach.

In state 98% covid deaths people 50 older. fully vaccinated 18% state 32% least one shot. 25% state 55 older. means essentially provided form protection everyone risk dying COVID.

The pandemic over, know yet. Yep, asshole already tested positive   Yeah, faith people remind everyone annoying around quite soon whole thing over.  filters RGB well light shines mouth mask Trending up, different sitiation, way less vulnerable 65+ year olds. make 80 percent deaths. Yeah honestly that's thing. New York passport. hate it, least handful people getting vaccinated. Meanwhile japan 0.62% population least 1 dose, 0.03% fully vaccinated. show exactly saying?  **Katrillions?** I'll know gamer breath smells like mountain dew™ doritos™ toothpaste. Lockdown quarantine two separate strategies dealing pandemic. difference matters.

The point lockdown SUPPOSED stalling tactic give governing agencies time put testing, tracing &amp; quarantine processes place, along policy guidelines (washing hands, wearing masks, etc.) stockpile resources. Instead, U.S. locked things never went much beyond that, wrecked economy people's lives little nothing change course pandemic.

Quarantine supposed happen individual level soon testing shows positive result. tracing contacts leads quarantine, infected persons contained. 

By time U.S. started haphazard minimal testing, well beyond point contact tracing feasible even useful. communing spread raging. agree. It’s become pathological fear avoidance, think people allowed ocd level fear dictate general public. It’s pretty easy considering lot New Orleanians signing MS’s health dept website traveling get shots. believe filter inside mask disposable. maybe social media isnt worth it. checked I'm like 25 health problems, work essentials. places say I'm eligible guess I'll wait.  average lifespan 79 years, Spring Breakers usually least, what, 18 years old? 61 years fucking long time live side effects virus. Anyone else dumbass coworkers saying things like ""well everyone else gets vaccinated spread stop I'll good.""? Ugh... true, I'm trying downplay seriousness disease. increased mortality age striking, (rising roughly order magnitude per decade) I'm mystified received attention. older people anyway sicker .. phenomenon seems related specifically advanced age itself. Something younger confers protection. world spent tens billions dollars developing vaccines. wish could also devoted resources understanding puzzle. 70/80% directly due covid (very likely, maybe even bit more), Mexico would second highest number deaths per capita Perù I’m vaccinated, hate nonsense too! seems like new way control freaks control people. 

I understand certain circumstances (care home visits, cruise ships) otherwise? already hear neurotic parents kids school asking vaccinations schedule play date.....me hubby them, got ourselves. Woodman's Unionized Buffalo Grove/Lincolnshire. I'm sure they've treated pandemic sit behind huge sheets plexiglass hand sanitizer next time. Cases rising, deaths stopped falling. last 3 days ticked up, need look averages. still falling likely continue. article states three currently approved two upcoming United States. hadn’t seen grandparents since Thanksgiving 2019, 1 year old can’t keep mask daycare didn’t even risk outdoor visit. Cut year later: grandmother survived stroke, grandparents moved home nearly 60 years assisted living facility. able come visit month don’t ever thing I’d seen grandparents joyful got see great grandkids first time 15 months. Can’t wait get soon. Really hard understand all. original variant still affected vaccines there's article still peer reviewed new mutations p1 variant. However, still early assumptions.

Couldn't find articles Damn, giant party July 4th might actually possible. unfair?  thing significantly modifies game currently playing. Duh. DUH! that's they're saying. They're basically saying modify behaviour vaccination, best saying okay gather small groups everyone masked, even everyone vaccinated.  mental health crisis occurring eyes young children. Schools closed longer. Kids need around kids. Well don’t want infected Tuberculosis. want proof people next don’t it. Look stats Tuberculosis around world. also don’t want around people HIV.

Hep A,B,C, STDs, Herpes. want nano bot record health provided me. paper do. implanted digital record. know plenty people negative rapid test ended testing positive.

I know that’s anecdotal crowd size it’s surely valid. Uh, no? Two days? Look weekly averages. went down, flatlined, they’re going up. dislike too. Hopefully NYS gets better governor 2022. want PHI accessed anyone needs verify COVID vaccination? What's source claim? India's existing infrastructure handle 7 mn/day doses. fault leadership vaccination drive failure. Yes whole country lives touristic área. happens, hope consumers punish right back voting wallets and/or filing lawsuits. Oh nooo providing income hard hit developing country whose economy relies heavily tourist revenue, selfish!!! know lots people 30 50 vaccine UK medical problems. appears vary hugely depending country due local demographics. mortality rate USA significantly lower USA vs UK. Yup. Made even dislike people loved spending time with.
Covid made really see willfully ignorant, selfish, confidently stupid people are.
I real desire go hang people anymore. media entity loves COVID authoritarian politicians. Outrage generates revenue.  Prevent 100% no. 95% yes. Even US excess deaths far higher official covid tallies would suggest defending selfish actions Americans, looking Mexican travel videos lately decent number locals wearing masks.

Americans unique America's biggest boosters critics tend believe. long hospitals overwhelmed many seem think anything worry about. Redditors love punished controlled billionaire owned corporations, evidently. Thiis Bible Belt country, one surprised sure talking about. supply area country. gone within hours. issue saying things “sheer hell” makes people expect sort war zone cities... doesn’t really happen (btw there’s “sheer hell” going FL) think it’s BS. wife comes Cameroon.

They simply test it. die fever, often assumed malaria.

And malaria much prevelsng pandemic. I've heard people scared visit hospitals now.

It's plausible Africa's Covid numbers may lower e.g. Europes. we'll never know. neighbors talking wearing sheer tulle masks flaunt rules going Mexico.

Why. people like this. women elderly, they've likely vaccine actively chosen point. Cuomo wants trust science gives power authority. turns he's wrong ignores calls misinformation. Can't wait office. Awful politician. weirdest part family believes vaccines. mine growing child. one “bad.” I’m American agree completely. Brazil P2 variant rough. state, Arizona, far less population UK, deaths 19 daily 20% vaccinated. Good. government it, major businesses definitely should. Sweden almost one wearing mask, all. cases declining still. Dont think question wether mask on/mask them? Lol
Why aren’t parents vaccinated? Forreal. It’s literally vocabulary used, 

“masks required,” great! I’m it. 

“Mask up!!” Fuck entire bloodline. matter. Go live life. That's vaccine for. National Lampoon's pandemic vacation Per capita i’m wrong that’s almost 4 times deaths country Sweden(10 million people, 13k deaths) crazy, multi-generational house holds common Mexico? No, use house Oaxaca already booked else don’t get money back, ever floats boat. Major airlines already working enforcing vaccine passports, private businesses, allowed that. even government doesn’t “punish” people that, airlines will. Oh whoops, mistaken impression Mexico 2/3 US population living fear want over? remember events last June 0 testing, much larger concert, everyone claimed perfectly safe. problem. anti-vax cousin talked aunt fucking stupid. Grandma's vaxxed I'm gonna get soon opens 16+ family damn weird whole thing originally preventing hospitals overwhelmed preventing people infected will. never eradicating COVID preventing every possible COVID death. Body autonomy important COVID.

I pray media remind political leaders that. Unfortunately, given accustomed they've grown Covid, doubt will. don’t know you’re downvoted. TED talks getting repetitive aren’t accomplishing anything. Can’t get enough me, you?  Creepo. Maybe can't transmit HIV BREATHING someone else? 


If HIV sex people without taking proper precautions (following regularly infectious disease specialist/using barrier protection), go prison state. Imagine COVID. no, know plenty assholes went public symptomatic take proper precautions, including family came PEDIATRIC CANCER UNIT work- penalties them. Know feeling, except grandma's husband instead taking COVID masks seriously, afraid losing caught him, pulled grief sucks still hard time fact walked dead body immediate aftermath. understand all. repeatedly said would trust science, they're trusting all. wish they'd spend time looking help long haulers want discourage people getting vaccinated what?? He’s talking “new normal...” 

If people get vaccinated, means pandemic authority comes prolonged. want entertainment business flee state like California?

If majority people leaving people would vote future elections, could motive. care people get reach herd immunity unvaccinated kids safe. Air filtration CDC guidelines opening schools since released them. I'm guessing chose actually familiarize Spain incidence 143 per 100k moment would 7 people infected average crowd 5000. antigen test, would leave 0 1 infected whole crowd. Shortsighted (Looks closely chart) well look last 2 days sure looks like pretty clear me

If freaking little tick never getting pandemic I’ve wondering entire time. Cases seem rise fall near-random points. wonder ever narrow specific set actions. Several countries got hands Biontech like Denmark Germany others bought less full share. Austria complained know, could done reckon. like around ignorant morons general. hundred infected 5000 false negatives. brain broken. I'm talking manufacturers delivering promises, Pfizer delivering promises, I'm talking Pfizer, I? 

Go ahead, let know one facts false. Perhaps something wrong. vaccines need morally abhorrent.

This quite dramatic way frame it, again, measures EU weighed blocking exports vaccines suppliers meeting obligations EU. 40 million vaccines produced EU soil exported, one shipment +300 blocked EU. I'm honestly surprised meek. again, confederation states exactly going decisive.

But really, getting weeds. I'm saying come surprise anyone self interested entities acting self interest EU corporations doing. one saint caricature boogeyman find matter hard try find one. certainly raver - since masks staple decades pandemic lol  Hah. right. mass exodus Florida Michigan snowbirds going home couple weeks ago. Surprise, surprise: Michigan jump cases week got home.

There simple way tell person asymptomatic: Quarantine travel. Test. Fly. Quarantine after. Test again. states want *hamper* travel, Florida guilty spades. Getting first shot tomorrow! I’ve counting days since DeWine announced Ohioans 16+ would eligible 29th embarrassing I'm introvert too, last year shown there's big difference introversion antisocial. way many people latter category claim wonderful want lockdown/restrictions end they'll interact people again. Well that’s health officials saying since start... protect NHS. That’s rationale. think (before adults chance vaccinated) time repeal restrictions workplaces public places people can’t choose go you’re nuts. 

Just someone doesn’t die doesn’t mean shrug exposing contagious pathogen places can’t choose avoid comfort can’t wait month two setting start easing restrictions .  

If vaccine pipeline get “we’ll forever?” sentiment point know that’s true.  Saying eff right borders negligence. OSHA MIA pandemic hugely problematic. 45yo workplace put position he/she shoved conference room bunch anti maskers (who freedom wear them) 5 weeks he/she option fully vaccinated. know Covid weird stuff (my friends husband can’t taste anything right year later) it’s illogical someone avoided long want make across finish line. 

It’s insane someone workplace expect protocols stay place offered vaccine.  Here’s idea, workplace offer vaccine clinic 3-6 weeks get rid anti Covid protocols (depending one offer) otherwise employees eligible start process rolling everything back. feel sorry guys. governments world forgot artists. seems like underpromise, ovwrdeliver, PA currently fastest vaccination rate, even rough start. logic, support flat rollout vaccine support obese smokers prioritized people less risk? okay, show last 3 months

I get it, rising now. point highly unlikely get Novemer-January levels one thing need vaccine card travel internationally. another thing NY talking requiring people vaccine passport go restaurant. thanks. want actually sick long, took 5-6 weeks afterward get endurance back work exercise. though? Even vaccinations done, lot places still going require proof got vaccinations done means passport.

To me, pandemic ends said places don’t require passports proof, probably won’t early 2022. make converge 60% something, deviate far 50% IMO. sure problem here. shots week went second doses big deal. administered point. No, vaccinated long that. Probably maskless gringos  Vaccines clotting problems new, they're recognised possible side effect existing vaccines, extremely rarely course! Source, nice doctor BBC R2  flu quite contagious COVID-19. Pretty sure there's big difference flu COVID-19. downvoted oblivion week ago delete comment called conspiracy theorist getting attacked private messages seemed extremely far left nut jobs. I'm lefty, still want think myself. ex flew Mexico. hope gets bad case dumb. true, new variant also carries substantially higher infection fatality rate. I'd say solidly ""topian"" Yes may little truth think related viral behavior people's behavior. part, people careful since beginning still careful.

It's evident looking wave saw fall/winter US something geographic going virus--whether climate, people staying indoors, etc.. surges clearly moved north south seem started back north again. there's countries lock hard early still good results (Norway Finland come mind) countries comparatively strict restrictions long times still bad results (spain, france) Extremely low. Another lockdown absolutely horrible idea.  Also, Walmart likes build stores top Aztec Ruins, bribing government officials get stores there. go sell souvenirs store, taking away business people make living selling I’m assuming they’ll eventually go back normal stop dwelling people die world, worry won’t fundamentally change lives worse.

If (collectively) get attuned blind deaths world,. really beginning end humanity. 

That's say sit around nothing moan deaths day. passively accept either. 

The vast majority Causes Death world preventable-causes. 10x 20x reduce those. live yourself? Florida seen spike UK variant supposedly rather widespread there. Really doubt variants \*reason\* cases ticking back up. Perhaps influence think reductive true reasons. way look trend look day compared week before. MI consistently seeing higher numbers day week week.  That's trend line consistently projecting upwards since early March. difficult understand worrisome.  want take quick glance, look peak day week, falls thurs, look trend past several weeks -- increasing since early March.  plateau, anyone interpret basic data see this.  Good luck, need it. says lockdowns for...? Yes correct, would wager rise deaths hospitalizations won’t close January 30 percent Michigan, mostly elderly risk, vaccine, highly highly effective preventing serious cases trying die America? We've never herd immunity flu kills 60k per year. typical Paris? smugness.  one things can't accept. philosophical puts bad taste mouth. simply can't okay either government corporations kind power. give ease. know US, corporations gods lot people comfortable that. 

TBH, I'm sure ever used services medical purposes. I'm security-minded person. try give data away free Big Tech.  Considering flu nearly non existent year wear mask flu/cold season probably able cut much get sick science isn’t clear yet vaccinated people spread covid asymptotically. Currently kids 16 approved vaccines. know fact can’t transmit vaccination irresponsible people refuse vaccination ones able go back normal instead parents want protect kids. dominant variant Israel UK variant. Brazilian South African variants dominate us, still effective searched online bit anything exemptions found articles professors said exemptions, nothing actual policy.

I dislike whole idea. enough people vaccinated deemed safe open arena, majority people inside likely vaccinated problem health care system.

The good thing assume take longer create something nationwide, point many people immunity matter anymore. Like remember Apple Google vowed create contact tracing system? took forever dropped, one used it.

I'd expect US system likewise take forever create, drops, matter anymore. Internationally, could see countries (and especially EU) requiring entry bit dumb take public health emergency one way out. one wants fucking vaccine absolutely incentivized get one whatever way possible. got called conspiracy theorist last week talking vaccine passports.  getting “0 deaths” day soon Scotland (during weekday counts) it’ll feel good finally go restaurant April 26 knowing nobody died day. I’d feel uneasy guilty going socialise deaths still hundreds here. Oh. Theyre jealously guarding paid for? Evil. dare care own. wish district. 80% chosen go back person. countries seriously need ban Americans. garbage people. Let continue destroy shithole country. Cancel America! ""I'm American! know rights.""  study read caused similar response lab as... original SARS. like new virus, thankfully vaccines work bit. I'm sure much better send... Even US people acting like everything fine now. looks like small bump nationally. look state state level, several states seeing unmistakably called big surge. seems likely start happening everywhere hope I’m wrong! conservatives dont care people.  Theyre selfish guess CureVac included since delivery dates bit vague. Um...duh? one last groups vaccinated? age group usually careful older age groups I’ve read Michigan opened up, full opened up. good news article seems age group doesn’t need much ICU care. let’s use lesson continue masks playing safe majority age group vaccinated (my state opens ages beginning April). mean honestly think long we’ve this, basic safety measures like month truly isn’t bad. Pllleeeaaasssseeeee. kids going back school 4 days week spring break I’m nervous numbers rise significantly, they’ll go back remote. It’s bad little brains screens much. ""you people"" ever get tired thwarting public health measures high get potentially infecting others? want know never combs hair. sloppiest looking major politician there. running around* Agreed. 

Now teachers vaccinated, kids vaccinated things likr airflow really matter? great international PR, charity also cornerstone many religions followed area, could boost governments popularity.
However, kind weird hes focussing people.  Yep here. going go part problem. I'm badly allergic penicillin sulfa first shot fine. Pharmacist blink answer asked allergies. That's always say drive home drunk! /s saying plan hermit rest life? dissent It’s sad media flat lies support narrative. We’re agreement then. CDC says longer recommended masks, I’ll take mine too.

It’s looking people don’t like masks. expect follow guidelines do. part! think people worried AZ clots/low level platelets Norway way many cases compared number given AZ vaccines. used lot Pfitzner, even problems seems less likely people. people ever get tired line little emotional hit get saying it? I’m showing covid passport go anywhere. need one I’ll go elsewhere. Nice happens isn’t it? feel like it’s peak people’s lives, that’s live for.... pretty sad. could see another market crash easily, another war seems extreme especially China. could see maybe proxy war happening, US China cannot afford directly go war other. see went Mexico? Americans supply problem. do. Brew booster faster brah goalposts keep moving? Nobody saying teachers starting getting vaccinated. grandmother coming meet daughter first time next weekend! Might get downvoted shit yeah people understand places starving business. Everywhere America. long follow guidelines would anywhere else, OK imo. saying Im right, far grayer area people think. Guidline published CDC. longer advise us mask must. cases even lifted slightly ending restrictions, left wing oppositions would tear Boris ""irresponsible"". news Americans come up? tragic, poor people. Hopefully able carry effective vaccination programme quickly possible. Shutting country listening scientists would slashed numbers Jair told everyone hoax nothing stop spread. math useless point. Let's wear masks months reach herd immunity! SOOO CLOSE! GET VACCINE END Despite sense smell, still detected gas leak property. air felt strange heard hissing. 

After 5 months, I've gotten used it. change food texture become important aspect foods. Agreed Define “after mess?” covid extremely low levels zero deaths, it’s safe take masks off, that’s we’re going do. interesting one comments 100+ votes 20+ downvotes... thread... People interesting say dick, sincerely hope american half population still thinks trump second coming christ parellels brazil uncanny.

If american, well... bit complicated. People truly need get brainwashed believing someone help cognitive dissonance sets person doesn't, start blaming literally anyone besides person who's fucking over, get trump/bolsanaro cult following.  spare everyone UK offered vaccine becoming yet another groan-inducing COVID talking point. Basing reopenings things like renovated HVAC systems, larger classrooms, fan installations ensures take YEARS return normalcy. current virtual learning setup way past expiration date already. don’t get kids back normal routines fall, social educational ramifications cataclysmic.

Vaccinate teachers, vaccinate parents guardians, move on. Vaccinate children throughout fall
and 2022 shots available, stop pretending rare threat severe COVID children outweighs damage long-term isolation half-assed education. I’m getting tired insanity. You’re ignoring difficult questions bragging “stirring shit” lockdown scepticism sub.

Low-ability egotists often find solace conspiracy theories, boy good example. Mexican President's strategy ""let rip"" beginning. Mexico one countries without travel restrictions president anti masker. ""it's outdoors, need mask"" probably majority thinking USA. 95% + protection getting infected amazing. less 5% get mild symptoms. Go live life. Listen science, media fear. Compared 1200 january amazing. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made UK two sites: Oxford Keele. third plant Wrexham puts vaccine vials packages UK ordered 100 million doses. Almost come within UK, 10 million doses made Serum Institute already received, half held confirmed UK received vaccines components EU - apart one ""tiny"" batch Leiden plant. zero problems masks remain required air ports, planes, government buildings. That’s required everywhere. It’s reckless disaster. impressive amount downvotes. Here, another. Sorry. dont know even reply comment. never look people wearing mask choice. Keep up. dont look us wearing one mess. We've hit really badly UK twice now, think better cautious tbh got first Pfizer vaccine 7 days ago may exposed. I’ve heard mixed things effective vaccines various points gather, don’t whole lot protection yet. correct?  I'll bet good money celebrities got shot LONG ago. got money burn lifestyle/industry keep. 19 deaths UK, 19 coronavirus, no, normal. Israel experienced large amount cases course vaccination program simultaneously seeing decreases death hospitalization. seeing similar trend US. Also country monolith virus hasn’t everywhere. You’re going see spikes surges certain areas. There’s data available assume variants dominant playing major role rise cases either. no, don’t think that. think early already promising vaccination campaign people seeing promising data also fatigued restrictions they’re empowered take risk. think lot extroverts opposite, making lost time.

I social anxiety literal agoraphobia even I'm tired hanging home. change anything? Ah, makes sense. wish they’d reciprocate. can’t link specific study reports I’ve read rate people received vaccine got rate people didn’t get vaccine. words, vaccinate millions upon millions, people clotting disorder people going get clotting disorder life. Masks protects life! care much seeing people emotions important want keep people alive. protests US/EU thing happened like HIV drugs sold less price . check news channels protest country BUSH president supported pharma industry instead people country. apologize. took original comment criticism badly Mexico handled situation, endorsement less, I'm sure dogshit rhetoric referring to. wasn’t difference American states. makes sense. feel like headlines like make fodder vaccine skeptics. totally see someone reading thinking “well even bother getting vaccinated cases going anyways.”  I'd 65+, overweight, working health care can't get state rn Mexico handling Covid better US Please apologize comment That's fair take - could kinder went adding nuance around IFR. really hang days, bit hot take part. I'll edit OG comment add bit nuance like suggested. sorry hear guess puts majority people country level poor never escape poverty India inequality 

to poorest poor countries inequality problems like India, end sight suffering too, yes go off. *Amazing* may poor choice words lmao Maybe I'm misremembering, feel hearing variants since last September. seem like idea variants seriously concerning started vaccination numbers started going up. I'm expert, think going OMG VARIANTS COMING. anticipated quite easily, bottles arent bottleneck (hah). were, load 747s fly over. Calm pal. First all. I’m Canadian. Second. I’ve never Mexico. third, statements agreeing you? don’t think tourists right now. Let alone going flouting local mask laws. would guess us spend enough time hospitals, airports government buildings really affect us.

I also think places going mask mandates long. Yea yea yea. Everyone said wreckless year ago much happened. dozen events holidays last year. lockdown? Regardless strategy, uptake UK much much higher. I’ll curious see final percentages come July 31. Yeah definitely still want shot, since know odds getting covid awful effect far outweigh chance negative vaccine effects. looking reassuring data, help nagging anxiety. WA couple weeks away. Hockeystick growth again. 2 months ago correct, seeing demand slack everyone wants shot getting one. additional phases slowing us down. Yeah, bs. knew infections would rise reopening/relaxing regulations. cause alarm here. guess consider getting people killed order make jobs easier ""good reason"" Southwest dropped 2/3 capacity back December. Delta one still it, gone 10 days too. read/see price medicine selling price . India selling alternative medicine works perfectly &lt;5$ new invented one foreign companies made india , new medication costs 10000$ per dose per week . 
Next time preaching peace, prosperity, freedom, justice , SHUT , millions died due money money 💸 rain sufficient.


Now complaints policy bans exports lives saving medicine .

Suck up, medicine people wants dieying.

When countries people died , EUROPEAN,US banned indian medical exports sanctions African countries.

Your Full Shit open eyes whole world one place family. people wants see breakdown vaccines used age across England, see:

Vaccination rates age - England, 25th Still 25-50% admissions higher age groups too. Shouldn’t vax brought much more? Yeah that's I'm saying. CDC says absolutely unavoidable, stretched past 21 days, recommended time frame 21.

I think problematic Walgreens reverted default time 28 days, they're trying achieve 21 all. better people know better travel fucking pandemic. Though Mexico made decision let resorts open welcome spring breakers. obvious going happen. idc man. thanks think don’t understand lockdown. obviously didn’t work first time shit ton people saw, citizens / businesses / airports taking seriously I’ve seen US. understand Mexico’s death rate per capita way way worse though, I’m sure logical explanations that, haven’t looked up. know is... half people see US wearing mask EVERYONE saw Oaxaca wore mask, even dude side road middle desert one around him... lol.  why? get inside, tell wear mask that’s it. “new ventilation systems” etc sounds like talking point keep kids school. want every public school US, would take years. think pandemic measures stay little longer places like hospitals, even think would permanent. lived Hong Kong right SARS 2005 hospitalized possibly bad influenza, people wearing masks time nurses. Hospitals probably keep measures next year see bad virus majority-immune population. know there's explosive camel unit latest version age empires 2? anti-cavalry unit mimics Tamerlane's use camels burdens flaming straw elephants, causing flee That’s pretty unethical also both, can't really expect rapidly reopen without people generally careless imo much money coming turism... Assholes not.

Sadly, local federal goverment care less extra deaths economy risk.

I dont agree that, show must go guess. Current CDC guidance safe fly vaccinated people, though wear masks. course, follow guidance laws home country country visiting. true, agree enforce it. Way oversteps bounds Lol comments excited concern hell me. 

We accept passports domestic activities. Pfizer ceo already said it’s going endemic. Everyone get vaccine every year you’ll never allowed go anywhere ever. Amirite? Yeah rescheduled CVS instead, thanks milestone Israel really started bend back cases.

I missed point all. Israel vaccinated 85% adult population young old, UK vaccinated 57% mostly older people spread virus much.

What i'm saying cases going crater UK like israel, fact they're likely increase April start vaccinated younger people May onwards. Importantly though, increase cases lead increase deaths people major side effects . feel great 2nd dose, worry. AZ prioritises UK involved development, trials, sorting supply chains, signed months earlier stronger contract, leaving late-arriving EU choice sign weaker contract teeth it.  
 
Those facts. still want live fantasy land UK responsible every EU mistake go ahead. Nobody cares forget things happen first place. Halix plant Leiden! AstraZeneca seek certification EU raided company sites found unaccounted stockpiles. 

I surprised EUs missing contract fulfilled sold higher bidders. 

The EU problems BioNtech Moderna exports, tabled restrictions specifically AstraZeneca. compare mortality data last 2 months, clear already UK strategy far superior. wish would unfortunately relies much tourism money. live? health conditions? Thanks They’re wrong. ACIP’s official recommendation says go lot longer second dose (I think Pfizer said well), it’s probably best get second shot close 21 days possible. Fine day Sunday. opinion, best day week. that, Dudley? Yeah 7 days next protection, get tested godspeed. really understand asked ""why even necessary?""

Because obvious extenuating circumstance like ""my girlfriend live continent cost get back canada"" something similar.  course. Every country different follow regional laws guidance particular area. Many countries able much vaccination yet, either. original comment I'm worried CDC never fully remove guideline though. thanks rational case numbers mean even less less at-risk vaccinated.

it's younger people now, though.

for part, even eligible.

**Spring Breakers May Taken Coronavirus South Florida Across US: Data think places going run toilet paper again.

just like last year. source this? always enact peak wave declines naturally. Britain three lockdowns pretty much worst deaths per capita Europe. Good, can't wait care less certain small EXTREMELY vocal percentage population say. Typo? assume meant “don’t” I'm fully vaccinated recently finished trip Cancun. wore mask required enjoyed myself. refuse put life hold longer. Ehhh go Tulum instead infect yuppie trash. confirm, used work behind meat counter. I'm put meat scale, I'm even capable ringing matter much yell me. sheer entitlement palpable. 15% country fully vaccinated. We’re still long way “grey zone” cautious need be. Depending availability area would schedule 2nd dose CVS somewhere else. think waiting matters much want get time reason to. pretty certain not, weird. It’s ok though icing arm today resting. Small price pay freaking ready restrictions lift. highlight week lmao he’s young, especially he’s already covid, risk ridiculously small. don’t fault people critical thinking - doesn’t make anti vaccination means sucked leash people time! Clearly us sending best I’m Michoacán. Massive Parties still going on, nobody wears mask, city masks mandatory people wear right. know every single EU country it. delusional claim otherwise. 
 
27 27 pretty big indicator. union card live entertainment (IATSE) burning hole pocket waiting give well-paid work again. Party fucking asses people, I'll background collecting paycheck. Everyone hail distopian future. Yikes. looking like repeat November right now. China US share markets economies. That’s fine can't. Unless politician, athelete actor fall guideline exemptions like compassionate reasons (family reunification, medical treatment etc) Anything incentivizes people get vaccinated good thing imo. actually read it? talked increase overall number cases increase percentage tests coming back positive. N95s uncomfortable oppressive. properly fitted, they’re tight. Straps dig face. you’re claustrophobic, they’re absolutely hell. I’ve worn them. can’t handle 10 minutes time. said one I? Europe not
 UK 5k fine get caught leaving country holiday. nowhere go anyway, apart Dubai Mexico seems. Yes, get summer going wild go back normal! Probably sooner realize. It’s given plenty opportunities spread mutate within population, every country testing bulk new variants. Britain France didn’t understand Feel free downvote me, spent 2 nights mexico last week friend. stayed Atelier Playa Mujeres pristine, crowded, everyone wore masks, regret hotel all. 

We vaccinated, flew different parts US. booked private travel car many people. one second felt danger, hand sanitizer every encounter person, phone/electronics sanitizer wipes every restaurant, people stayed away other, everyone wore masks properly. beginning end, hotel experience impeccable.

The airport check-in departure entirely different experience. took 2 hours line people noses hanging out, wearing masks, standing top line, almost airflow get check-in security. knew moment seriously miscalculated extent population still handling virus honestly doubt travel quite awhile. Yes, stupid way learn majority people follow protocols, sorry industry locals forced deal people follow rules. 

For part, took precautions could possibly take ensure we, everyone around us, protected spread anything including virus. feel, retrospect, everyone outlook sense responsibility instead entitlement vacation, entire trip would incredible. missed point. They're comparing two countries' current numbers. cares Hungary still EU programme. bought extra side, allowed Russian vaccine part EU programme (yet). allowed buy extra pfizer side, example. *you* read article? also mentions increase case numbers increase percent positive tests. Dictators sadist suppressing economy free market friend. lead far problems long term. Social economically. Trust me, government never public well-being mind. fact decisions essentially created monopoly likes Amazon.

I question existence COVID, question level measures introduced.

The amount money wasted due situation. Decisions made based ""evidence"" China.

Highgly suspect decision timing made different governments around world.

And piggybacking ""Pandemic"".

We need remember, can't let good crisis Goe waste. [An actual good thread spent overwhelming majority pandemic back Mexico, I’ve always found funny obsessed American media Brazil pretty much everything applies Mexico, America’s neighbor, much. comparing UK's vaccine delivery status 2020 vs EU's status now? think fair comparison, value all? done they've fixed earliest possible dates. want repeat past mistakes things early. Every easing restrictions started schools month monitored impacts course several weeks restrictions lifted. anyone interested information covid mexico r/covidmx great moderator daily updated graphics.

I’m also going leave link graph (also made moderator) deaths per million latin america, mexico number one even surpassing brazil 12 million confirmed cases (we barely 2 There's actually fairly substantial percentage people full vaccination already (15% Americans) getting second shot within next month (an additional 15% Americans). There's reason individuals prohibited travel seen irresponsible take long needed vacation, fact could really help businesses hit hard pandemic. still wear masks wash hands, aside that, they're threat anyone. talk pharmacies giving incorrect date second doses?

Walgreens refused schedule Pfizer vaccine 21 days, despite telling CDC recommends 21 days thing past ok *only if* 21 days cannot met 21 official time period. graph, alongside death + hospitalisation drop last 2 months needs signposted sent worldwide. going frustrating countries max 50%-70% range. obviously ways go, look current numbers make informed guess moment. 

Taking Worldometers numbers, UK seen 7-day average daily deaths fall peak \~1,250 day late January current rate 65 day, 95% decrease. time frame death numbers US dropped \~3,473 994 day 72% decrease. 

If US able mirror UK's decrease, we'd currently daily death average 180, would mean 800 people day dying COVID. 

Now, there's variety factors play (UK lockdown, etc.) impossible say US could mirrored UK numbers exactly shifting delayed-second-dose strategy, think extremely plausible would cut current death rate half point would mean saving \~12,000 lives month. 

Personally would willing bet money UK strategy look much better end. bigot, everybody needs vaccine eat bugs Good. It’s becoming crystal clear need put pressure anti-vaxers force them. doesn’t end enough people don’t get shot.

Ultimately employers great equalizer. get enough major employers mandate vaccination, think it’ll tip scales. need policies incentivize employers mandate. vaccine rollout began, partner, also long COVID, couldn’t help worry. 

That *quite* coincidence something [~2% prevalence beyond three author article claims higher rates studies suggest 10 30 percent people documented coronavirus cases experienced long-term consequences.

Here's [paper survey sent November 2020 collect data. purpose survey understand respondents’ experiences timing duration COVID-19 symptoms impacted asymptomatic respondents could participate, data respondents reported symptoms included results. focus experiences people PASC, data analyzed limited respondents experienced symptoms longer 21 days.

You've *got* shitting me. He's actually citing evidence third people infected experience long COVID actual finding among self-selected group respondents symptomatic COVID lasting longer 21 days, third experience long COVID. I'm attacking study, fine first pass figuring figured out, even remotely imply number infected people long COVID.

I generally expect Atlantic better this. Take peek page art naturals web QUESTION OFTEN ASKED “IS ARTNATURALS HAND SANITIZER RECALL LIST?” 
 global demand sanitizing personal protective products, hand sanitizer sales grown unprecedented exponential rate. demand, poorly formulated hand sanitizers made way market, causing massive recall certain brands hand sanitizer.

 cautious going products family use everyday, know trust artnaturals sanitizing needs! I'm there. think restrictions vaccinations stop that. People vaccine 100% chance going hospital dying (of covid). think that’s faulty view wars decreased scale. 

If you’re losing war decide nuke enemy, also get hurt worse surrendered. Traditional wars absolutely possible neither side uses nuke, even though them. 

I think wars decreased scale mainly world become interconnected. US China going war would major economic event well shock comes war. economies tied together, wars directly wealthy countries cost used to. Instead, see rise proxy wars militant groups funded large nations don’t directly duke out. logistics effort rolling vaccines everywhere, wants take another huge project rolling passports everywhere, making sure get intended recipients?

Amazing! COVID before? Friends family know prior COVID diagnosis similar experiences first shot zero issues second. know anyone without COVID history side effects shots. This. could publish schedule based doses shipped state rather dates delivery timeline update number doses received everyone could see progress towards full availability. Compared 0 deaths COVID ""terrible lot less month ago"". much time spend government buildings, hospitals, airplanes etc? 

And results less deaths illness surely small sacrifice careful areas rarely in. 

Unless govt/airport/medical worker case know say. Ya think thousands going rent van? maskless people personal space van?

Any excuse make ""ok"" thwarting health measures. saw Pfizer, apply vaccines across board (like J J)? Plenty stores stopped temp checks enforcing masks now. nasty bottle sanitizer keep adding water refill it. go out, half people see maskless. Hate burst bubble, people sick head rooting Florida see rise cases. You’ve done shit since last March and, guess what, DeSantis - decisions love criticize much - done one best jobs governor. Great time watch fat fedora wearing neck beards go around RGB masks filter germs unsolicited attempts seduction. Deaths largely result cases 3 weeks ago. going start rapidly coming next 2 3 weeks. people die 2 3 weeks already baked large mean, lying jump line. jump line, means okay taking dose someone actually actually needs it. Someone far risk person fake health condition get it. could also lie live jump high-risk under-served community vaccination drive well. Nobody going stop you. Sure, it. still asshole it. OP said *people* I’m concerned getting sick. I’m concerned virus spreading, killing, mutating I’m also concerned people responsible enough get vaccine go back lives without dragged anti-vaxers big problem looks surface. vulnerable largely vaccinated. People really starting live life cases hit critical mass vaccinations bad, forgot, everyone disagrees brainwashed. confused many people automatically trusting big governments big pharmaceutical companies. seems obvious unknown side effects vaccine rushed market. I'm anti-vaxx slightest I'm realist. truly wont know vaccines impact couple years possibility worse people covid itself. example covid negligible effects young people 0% chance vaccine fuck up. many people begging potential government big pharmaceutical says so? enough vaccines everyone wants one, there's zero risk hospitals overwhelmed, personally care less people choose vaccinated. accept another shift goalposts. much different anywhere.  

PA got rocky start moved middle pack I’m vaccinated wearing mask. small chance I’ll get sick, even minuscule chance I’ll get sick enough I’ll need something it. Also, San Diego less two hours live Los Angeles, weekend - get sick, would long home able use resources. EU seized anything. They're trying get AZ honor contract better.

Fellow Floridian here, I'm vaccinated yes, me. issue lot people *not* vaccinated think act like vaccinated public health messaging guidance enforcement absolute shit show country.

Every Pennsylvania adult wants coronavirus vaccine able get by June 20, according projections made Pennsylvania’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force. 

To accomplish that, state need move next two phases vaccine rollout opening broader public, said state Sen. Ryan Aument, Mount Joy Republican serving task force, created last month Gov. Tom Wolf.

Aument said state projects complete state’s four vaccination phases following dates:

* Phase 1A by April 18
* Phase 1B by May 2
* Phase 1C by May 23
* Phase 2 (general public) by June 20

Pennsylvania still Phase 1A remains committed scheduling least one vaccine appointment everyone group by March 31, opening eligibility broadly by May 1, per President Joe Biden’s directive, spokesperson Department Health said email.

Communications staff department Wolf’s office could  immediately confirm projected dates completing vaccinations shared Aument.

The projections assume 80% participation rate. one required receive vaccine people say won’t take it. vaccine supply increases, state continue target hard-to-reach populations hesitant get vaccine, Aument said.

Vaccinations began December Pennsylvania, Phase 1A includes people age 65 older, residents workers long-term-care facilities, health care personnel people medical conditions put high risk COVID-19.

Once state gets Phase 1A, rest rollout move quickly, Aument predicted. attributed much delay thus far large size state’s 65-and-older population early vaccine rollout fumbles.

The state’s population 12.8 million, third — 4.5 million — eligible Phase 1A. 3.6 million them, 80%, expected seek vaccine, 2.9 million already received least one dose Thursday.

The Pfizer Moderna vaccines require two doses, Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine requires one dose.

The federal government week reduced projected Pennsylvania allocation one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, Pfizer Moderna continuously surpassing supply projections, Aument said state officials confident they’ll still able meet goals.

Many country’s populous states lowering age eligibility 65 50s, several large states, Florida California, setting April dates every adult eligible.

Aument said task force discussed lowering age point Pennsylvania, said believes changing eligibility requirements soon could “lead lot confusion.”

“We manage supply effective manner, driving through-put laser-like focus 1A population we’ve set,” Aument said. 

Pennsylvania continued increase volume vaccine doses administered past week, ranking 15th country administering least one dose COVID-19 vaccine, according Centers Disease Control Prevention.

Aument predicted supply surpass demand “sooner think.” 

“It quite remarkable — we’ve response COVID,” Aument said.

Aument said understands frustration early chaos state’s early rollout, credited “American ingenuity” ability mass produce vaccines help country end COVID-19 pandemic.

“I hope folks see remarkable particularly last couple months get many millions Pennsylvanians vaccinated short period time,” added.

They would still likely significant immunity one dose, studies Israel single dose Pfizer may similar J&amp;J vaccine, would still able receive clearance vaccine passport? would hope yes, would also assume developers probably think intricacies beyond ""Vaccinated yes/no""
