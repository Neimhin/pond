I’m US don’t think will. you’re part phase 1X they’re saying “end Summer.” people scared virus even without vaccine. 

My personal feeling at-risk vaccinated, I'm resuming life 100% without vaccine.

That's choice, free make another one. Not, know.... vaccine took. NYT might well Fox. I’m getting covid sense taste smell gone. sucks. (It could worse mild case). Think enjoying anything getting texture instead flavor. friends saying took months taste return. Hoping doesn’t last long. thought figured covid primarily spread via surfaces dangerous too.

It’s difference leaking covid days spewing weeks Yeah, kind muck article. least gives timeline specific dates, albeit conservative.  Clearly balance struck, I'm advocating anarchy. People behave recklessly around every day, like it. accept certain level risk part price participating society. 

Public shaming generally going win people reject antisocial behavior. Compassion, understanding, mutual respect will. wear mask right should, since I'm vaccinated.

Once I'm vaccinated, equation changes, may make different decision. also made many people (including me) think wore mask, alarmist fool wasn’t following science. 

Turns fool wearing one, misled. 

Don’t think stuff like contributed politicization pandemic? always going little spike many states rolled back testing much storms. hospitalizations positivity rates still dropping much reliable. Johnson Johnson vaccine tested new variants? hope effective. article also says mandates likely drop summer, many people continue wear masks volition, that's okay. friend works people involved J&amp;J vaccine trials accounts disorganized mess. pass J&amp;J vaccine help it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* surprised see masks come summer. personally won’t take mine I’ve mRNA shots one J&amp;J shot.

It’s looking like that’s going happen July August. friend who, end 2020, proudly made post Facebook decided focus “gets do” rather “can’t do” mentioned cutesy stuff like take virtual tour Disney baked “depression cake.” Like pandemic governor wasn’t telling see, see “could” go? know someone else bragging Instagram “I finally got DIY project phase pandemic!” seen brags “pandemic projects.” Like it’s nearly year people still trying make seem cute fun. still get emails email lists “comfy work home styles.”

I actually placed order last night couple new clothes. Casual clothes, yes I’m tired wearing things over. even wore makeup around apartment couple weeks ago feel human. Seems like everyone else still wants bum keep trying make pandemic sound glamorous.  Children lower risk high risk person vaccinated. groups vaccinated people can't see might well shoot now. time line never clear constantly changing. It’s unlikely enough people get vaccinated spring restore normalcy. fact, experts fear pandemic could get much worse near term, variants virus contagious vaccine-resistant original version begun circulating United States.

What?? Cases literally dropping like crazy. exactly would cause shit get ""much worse""? fuck variants? They're everywhere, yet, cases dropping. Sweden sparsely populated weighted density Sweden comparable France European nation double Norway Finland? Unless course use whole density country rediculouse measurement use know anything Nordic countries. mean international hubs Swedes one country travelers Europe? Ok discussion shows little know Nordic countries. clones eachother. far truth, millions people family significant others countries can't visit. Thousands workers stranded ships work on. list people affects ""the wealthy"" goes on. lot people work countries order send money back families far wealthy, too. 

In addition, tourism provides livelihoods millions working people throughout world, many anything close would describe wealthy, lot workers struggling make ends meet seeing jobs evaporate. saying skin game? reopen borders. absolutely problem ""recommended"". huge problem ""mandated"". want everyone get vaccine quickly possible. there's incentive get it, fear people blow off.


EDIT- say benefit, obvious FFP2, KN95 masks April gonna look like? Even NY opening up. rest us live.

Yeah, say that, almost 2.5 million people dead. hermit want hard lockdown end try force cases down, *get out* lockdown start live again.

I'm sure people understand exactly want strictness. strictness leads options, Australia, couple harsh lockdowns, that, I've lived completely normal life since April 2020. imagine time 40-50% vaccinated see US starting share.  Sorry clear preview made, article also says masks come summer.

Pretty sure difference summer 100% normal fewer conventions concerts, etc. Nuts posts like “I don’t care pandemic” get upvotes here. feel like people least care, even little getting sick. 

Also there’s wild discourse mask wearing starting appear. Like get quarantine, god damn folks dramatic wearing mask washing hands. 

I don’t know happened sub. I’m saying people live fear, like, smart, give enough shit wear mask. even 95% effective means there’s 5% chance infection, numbers, although coming down, still high. Sweden realized mistake changed, late likely end pandemic worst Nordic record. that. production still gets sent US. vaccinated, production focus EU. already starting ramp up, told vaccinated (as young healthy adult) next 2-3 months, already got appointment next month. got covid, January got surgery remove brain tumor diagnosed last November. surgery went nose, since longer able smell thing.

it took several weeks finally accept situation...partly taste intact...I can't imagine life lost taste along smell. that's horrific me.

I checked scientific papers smelling neuron, seems like keep repairing along lifespan, hope smell's return remains.

wish better soon. virus diary? response scheduled months advance? shows understanding nature problem, required response. almost like situation constantly changing!

It depends vaccine manufacturing. J&amp;J slow down, able ramp production recently. significant impact general population could get vaccine. could get killed driving home work today, horribly, permanently injured. could another person. 

It's risk, take risk low benefits outweigh risks.

Others choose differently, support since decision, mine make them. ask return. 4.5M doses day doesn’t seem totally unreasonable. hit 3m doses day flu vaccine past fall never worried getting Covid, even March 2020, I’m 64. I’ve much worried society’s response Covid, seem healthy me. It’s literally recommended public health officials. delusional, seek professional help happened 6+ months ago agree more. Except NIH &amp; CDC never really recommended population large length time. February. course people trouble obtaining extremely limited resource far. Yes, realize everyone thinks important person world right therefore deserving vaccine. everyone stays sensible weeks, problems largely resolved everyone fine. Note: three-day weekend figures. Woot  buy ""power hungry tyrant"" meme, believe public health community terrible messaging, scared policy makers want make mistake parsing messaging, turns blind-leading-the-blind clusterfuck. According Israel data yes, research trials protection grew linearly, real world behaviour effects vaccine. 1st person shared codes knew doing. Somebody actually create message lie ""leftover"" vaccines open everyone. benefit person spread free certain circles.

Think person would that. answers pretty gross. remember listening NPR couple months ago guest said thing. ""Get vaccine that's offered."" going anyway, stuck me. want shot damn bad  1 crore 10 million. They’ve administered 10 million doses. luck getting Pfizer shots, JnJ ready available, would taken it. hesitation. Nothing strict UK lockdown. joke. measures seem designed totally ineffective virus simultaneously inflicting economic damage. Dude, working retail pharmacy, one biggest fears, since vaccines started rolling out. People say they’ve vaccinated therefore don’t need mask. know said you’d wear one required, like, mindset freaks out. Also MRNA vaccine cdc guidance says risk fully vaccinated people could spread coronavirus, others ""still uncertain."" However, ""vaccination demonstrated prevent symptomatic Covid-19; symptomatic pre-symptomatic transmission thought greater role transmission purely asymptomatic transmission,"" according CDC. Who?  Health Canada slow approving it? assumed vaccine would approved week EMA 13 million doses Pfizer week going change trajectory thing rapidly Joe responsible 100k piece shit.  ‘Murcia. guy proven quite hack. talked to/directly asked 30 experiences? gauging say social media casual conversation? personally know 6 long haulers, 5 40, none obese, 1 preexisting conditions Add comparative obesity rates start get clearer picture. actually old people *fully* vaccinated talk dropping restrictions. month also cases even down. that? Amazing, let's keep train going! Mutations stopping. years developed world access vaccine.    quit day job. Unless involves forecasting, epidemiology, infection control, public health policy. 

If - DEFINITELY quit day job. Yes, precisely thinking. I'm fairly optimistic we'll decent mix natural immunity vaccine-acquired immunity time. yet course, sometime relatively soon.

As said, people refuse vaccine are, definition, people unusually unconcerned either acquiring transmitting virus. would expect usual behavior interactions others reflect lack concern, meaning vastly likely caught disease, soon. 

Honestly, would strange case. likely significant chunk population 1) takes virus seriously, social distancing/masking/avoiding indoors/etc, point successfully evading infection highly contagious disease...*and* 2) going steadfastly refuse vaccine? people exactly long term plan? misrepresenting anything. literally said it. literally walked back. literally said Fauci "" never said matter bad faith interpretation may be."" Go away. going ""daily mass casualty events"" vaccination Let's fucking go! 20 million vaccinated people March gonna help much. Oh yeah whole sub full high quality information, thanks bot Honestly sign get it. extremely liberal 1b group 47% already vaccinated Israel, least many take US  real. bad day today, don’t test me. 

... I’m full shit too. Don’t arrest either. They're literally already making them??? Numbers nosediving still told can't hug Grandma even get vaccine. I'm tired zero public direction Pandemic sinking feeling government roll back regulations financially forced people str8 revolt.

We've '2nd wave' 'dark winter' entire year \- South Carolina Anything short restrictions gone start summer complete failure public policy. month impossible justify continuing restrictions. 2 impossible justify mask wearing.

I think he’s also touch impact closures regular people jobs businesses cautious result... probably isn’t surprising guy born multibillionaire. also consider anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, able take vaccine due legitimate medical reasons. stock, everyone getting shots. I'm happy see uptake generally positive hospitalisations confirmed cases dipping tho.

But regards original poster replied to, still find pretty selfish say rather US looks now. deaths sky-high number cases last year never happened. I'm sure affected families would preferred hard lockdowns instead tragic losses. can't wait vaccine. I'll happily wait place line. Others need currently, I'm gonna happy get jabbed arm. probably fine. They're getting sick would much think vaccines prevent transmission you. Signs point obvious outcome vaccinated can't transmit, I'm personally risk averse I'd wait studies done go anywhere without vaccine myself. bad, take first one offered you. very, good vaccines. Yup last Mon artificially low holiday snowstorm stance; phrasing differently show apples-to-apples comparison sounds absurd.

When comes businesses individual rights, look things point view ending pandemic good society. comes nurses (or teachers, profession put pedestal) instead look perspective individual. emotional irrational.

When put side-by-side, looking perspective, becomes clear absurd hypocritical worldview is.

You need better awareness biases. Like said, may industry considered essential area's economy. Oh look people told us Saddam Hussein making chemical weapons. High risk populations largely already vaccinated.

The highest risk factor age. Mostly 65. ~50ish million Americans age 65. 

The highest risk factors highly correlated age (cancer, heart disease, etc.), means high overlap 65 serious preexisting condition. 

At point, weigh tediousness/bottleneck vaccinating people exact right order based risk, vs *speed* would come removing limitations. Well, hard argue well help Mexico :) That's big problem to

On another note, looks like person plans unmask dark downvoted me. Pitter patter culturally relevant think everybody looking last time through. It’s really hard snatch away then. people want get re-elected. mean there's good information every post, mixed paranoid, scientifically illiterate fear mongers. much people malicious, rather read one study, assume makes expert trot around newly acquired expertise like know everyone else. even studies wrong. need years experience really sift everything get complete picture possible. need years realize even lot seemingly credentialed people talking asses. Eh dont think covid pressure due asymptomatic pre symptomatic spread. could technically become 50 percent deadly long keeps week two pre symptomatic spread still provide enough new host. Doesnt really explain much helps OP jumping line, least clear. link: ""Individuals aged 65 older, individuals ages 16-64 medical conditions, defined Centers Disease Control Prevention, increase risk severe illness virus. conditions **include**: cancer,"" etc.

""Include,"" exhaustive list. Problem [CDC keeps two lists underlying conditions - ""definitely risk"" list ""maybe risk"" far know, everyone ""maybe risk"" condition gotten email they're eligible, everywhere look one actually explicitly lists conditions reason eligibility. Infections good metric US lot testing. There’s way know properly compare infection rates. order Amazon. used plastics grocery bags well. Pliers work pinch get box inside. Cool! Thanks confirming! don’t think Chicago competes trade shows much places like Orlando Las Vegas, going waaay ahead reopening (in addition existing advantages like weather, absurd fees expenses McCormick Place, on). They’re biiiiig trouble. strongly disagree. Ignoring fact gave restrictions pretended COVID exist, *everyone* (and mean *everyone*, close 100% population) would get COVID. would mean hospitals would overwhelmed point routine issues like heart attacks strokes get hospital, would die. 

Aside that, people *survive* COVID frequently horrible quality life. Breathing problems, cardiac issues, clotting problems, permanent loss smell taste, name it. mention lung transplants ""recovered"" people die 5 years. 

Lastly, even matter number became miniscule discounted people. people lives (I'm sure live US, *huge* portion population falls category, hence half million deaths have), saying someone obese pre-existing medical conditions means deserve die horrible belief hold. I’m bragging. I’m telling won’t get till March  Hahaha can’t go bar you’re persecuted aren’t you? sympathy family hospitals Heart brain? Yeah we'll see kind goes. hard compare influenza reasons terms much severe although may change time... We'll see happens far infection patterns go time counter point: 13:00 - 15:00 marks. Sure either guy could correct. Nobody knows certain. Jha makes pretty good case thinking public eye intentionally pessimistic. agree. highest risk people vaccinated least 1 shot March fully vaccinated April. then, anyone wants shot probably get scheduled one. Deaths crater (even now) March April open season point. wonder come future people scratch throat light cough couple days extremely mild covid infection that's cases went undetected.  end end near near may take months show impact cases.

So, wrong. take months show impact cases unless hard lockdown. shown nearly every country again. spread significant seeding. believes definite explanation disease dynamics wrong. 

So, wrong. Plenty people definite explanation disease dynamics. studying individual outbreak events, epidemiologists place reasons behind case drop.

So, wrong. epidemiologists place reason cases dropped. several say herd immunity. several say seasonal effects. individuals left explain increased case loads several countries hit hard also similar weather patterns US. good indicator cases rising falling. It’s weak proxy.

So, wrong. Mobility good indicator rise fall cases. call weak proxy really show ignorance. probably hundred papers strong association case burden mobility nothing stops dime, cases world US collectively fallen faster raised last 3-5 months. cannot argue that. 

So, wrong. third longest wave 3 peaks. initial peak fall current decline longest period wave. looking third peak direct result increased mobility followed fast fall happened starting November initial case fall. lockdown England lockdown Florida. dynamics virus’ pace slowed vary wildly countries drop distinct dramatic every country happened. happened less around time.

So, lack understanding you. Lockdowns way people distance. People stupid people want believe. cases go dramatically, decrease mobility. Here's global composite mobility index months. mobility doesn’t much think lockdowns.

So, wrong. See citations also look graphs mobility. large drop world went people definitely visited local families friends holidays isn’t reflected mobility data you’re showing. 

So, wrong. mean, use eyes. can't help refuse look.  Lines mark Thanksgiving New Years. person would normally travel plane LA NYC work won’t Christmas travel LA San Diego visit family. mobility went crazy high number still mingled outside household they’re still potential covid case. considering people live near grew up, it’s likely case. Local small family gatherings continue major drivers infection. cross country travel.

So, wrong. multiple reasons. First being, airline travel holidays.  Second being, mobility data already calculated community level. person traveling across country crazy high mobility calculated local level gauges whether person home visits someplace like grocery store, park, saying immunity anything drop. I’m saying mobility little it.

So, wrong. we've seen mobility, again, causes increases peaked October. lead wave continued new year people went relative’s houses holidays. wave went holidays. None needs explanation cases July somehow directly seeded cases December.

So, partially wrong. Cases July also seeded cases October. seeding period period distant spread. That's had. cases never dropped previous trough. indicates seeding period.   even see comparing IHME data case data. Mobility increased massively April June. You’d expect bigger increase June October. Yet saw cases go down. 

So, also partially wrong. Again, cases never dropped previous trough. Look data. end second ""wave,"" daily cases double previous trough (~21,000 vs ~35,000 lows). seeding period proceeds exponential growth. necessarily expect large increase cases June October look demographic data, see second wave largely younger individuals. necessarily get deaths wave deaths lower, get distant spread, especially factoring college age students return home. 

Mobility literally explains happened. There's really better explanation unless want get fanciful talk seasonality herd immunity. Cute dogs. already animal kingdom thought unfortunately. Hopefully spread bad among point you’re trying make lots company idiot, right? missing something? happened pandemics vaccines weren’t available? Knowing luck vaccines allready covid, getting weird reaction typical me. swine flu vaccine bend knee week really walk foot. still i'll take vaccine turn! worried dying? them. worried hospitalized? them. Try go general public idea shitty way life continue undisclosed amount time we've vaccinated promise normalcy.

You'll get laughed room.

Try institute politician career over.


We're going back normal, join, stay way we're going. Anti-vaxxers minority, vocal. Germany tried found one tiny competitor able switch vaccine 3 month retooling factory. even pharma giant Bayer said nope, none required tech, can't produce it. super niche stuff. always get downvoted asking this, I’m really pessimistic. Im curious, would work kids? two really small kids would likely go school/daycare. I’m happy going back since need social interaction, would risk little since adults vaccinated ? know it’s bad kids, would still rather didn’t get Got correct buddy. JnJ vaccine cultured Leiden, Netherlands, send US bottling small vials. Source: engineering Dutch production site.

Europe worried vaccines shipped packaging, batches destined Europe blocked export ban. I’m Oregon wondering mean “states like California Oregon.” referencing stricter guidelines places? (Genuine question, combative) would include ""overweight"" obese. Fauci usually conservative public statements quickly things improve. That's probably better optimistic reality failing live optimism.  That's stupid. contract totality legal agreement. there's important legal, contract. They're rolling vaccines age know it. essential workers would vaccinated, they're not.

And sure, less disease = less cases hospitals, I'm arguing that.

I'm arguing people hospitals older, getting population vaccinated means less hospitals well.

The moral story reducing transmission cards much longer mitigation keeping hospitals getting overrun us going distancing much longer. lol first all--I looked bit, used NON UNIQUE CODES. Like literally used things like LA5280 Code...and people shared codes. god's green earth thinking?

Also, get shots arms stop pearl clutching every 5 seconds. 120 million doses coming March. think anyone gonna fight boss making mask work vaccine, use Karen public places required. Good luck trying police private though. Yes, think would lot less supply constrained. seems like COVAXIN India rapidly scale hundred million doses month University Oxford attenuated vaccine. Cold temperatures actually help preserve viruses longer.  Wow, live small UK city (50k pop.), multiple vaccination centres, one capable 900 jabs/day. Take get better vaccine becomes available get one. 

So, EU citizen AZ vaccine became available would run get it. question effectiveness? Sure. reasonable, even given latest article, surmise mRNA vaccines qualitative edge (regardless emerging consensus taboo say vaccine ""better"")? Sure. 

But media circus acting like AZ useless really unhelpful public health perspective. Go get AZ jab offer.  Completely misleading headline. I'll mask business requires that's right ask, get strangers grills since understand space big deal people impact that.

I putting going bars restaurants hanging maskless friends family also vaccinated indoors, asking people absolutely ridiculous. Deliveries EU increase dramatically q2 enough vaccines without needing help US. Also wonder medical field. approved kids then. Every kid age 3 get well. Despite baseless myths dumb ""at rate"" claims, EU enough vaccines everyone August. point matter whether want take not. made zero attempt explain Austria defend Pacific Ocean. going take years according nearly every expert.

We going shut USA instance mostly vaccinated couple months people countries vaccinated.

The political careers anyone suggests immediately over. right many aspects guess share conclusion USA would spend dime less thinking president would move Europe. “BuT fReEdOmS!” - Americans, actually Use [low dead space get one dose per vial.  unnecessarily complicated. Jj want 12? Ask single question: why. course hospital medical staff first, fact states used exact model.

What I'm saying vaccinate large younger population 65+ population. fair point around.


What normal vaccine? Non mRNA. They're Battle tested know works, got experience making too. Would option Canada earlier on? think we're making one recall correctly. Degraded immune response rendering vaccine fully ineffective. variants build parallel different locations. Cries european havent completed trials. Well actually covid easier contain cities Germany, sure worked Canada. country side people trust tend say ""that Bill, know him, it"". Tbh global infection rate perspective makes sense vaccinate poorer countries semi-dysfunctional governments low trust authorities first, order reduce number potentially dangerous mutations.

Those ones likely reach high infection rates, due people needing go work live daily hand-to-mouth basis, using public transport living cramped, money PPE proper hospitals, adhering official rules recommendations.

Ofc economic perspective different. US 7-day average worldometers went little today, first time done long while. 


Could artifact last Monday holiday? Absolutely, I'm interested see rest week's numbers. look numbers Israel you’ll find hardly change share Test positives. Deaths still December level. despite fact 80% least received first shot. 

Moreover trends pretty much universal independent countries.

Look ourworld.org literally welded people homes. Surprisingly far AZ proved effective reducing hospitalisations Pfizer vaccine UK. longer gap Vaccinations raised overall efficacy much closer levels.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Half next two years, ok... long term plan. Yeah Canada needs get laid. worse, people careless think wrongfully protected carefull people? 

That decision someone take. EMA mentioned danger, mentioned age group 55 older. 
German authorities made promise approve safe effective vaccines, rushing anything. 

They faced rushed study. weight confidence decisions, every could read EMA warning messed AZ study undermine trust recommendations. long covid way someone significant trouble breathing is.

That incredibly frightening. Many us may infected know actual longer term effects later life, ever.

There likely people misdiagnosed kinds weird stuff basis original COVID infection. mean get graduate high school person :,)  comparable numbers. average life expectancy 83 male 90.

That's assumption they're healthy. 

The average life expectancy 40-year-old person 50 years obese one make past 45. Oh shit, yeah bad. need really ramp production better affordable ones. point vaccine meet people showing symptoms, plus illness might even covid.  quite sure getting here. UK Belgium worse. explanation needed.

Virtually every country name better US did.

Your next response Italy handful others.

Doesn't change fact US one worst deaths/population rates world.

I agree #1 statistic. Bill Gates scientist he’s businessman. I’ll listen scientists.

On sides issue. (overly?) narrow scope closely related family. I'd interested survey estimates outright ""how many people lost COVID felt close to?"". imagine many would 4mil would respond least 1, possibly pool high-mourners (I.e. poorer communities) Imagine half risk population ***with 1st vaccination.*** less restrictions countries beating covid19.

Personally desire covid19 category rest Europe. That's putting bar way low :( Yes. US fifth highest country COVID deaths per 100k population ([Johns Variants know today. Future variants? Nobody knows. Zero chance would even slightly consider J&amp;J. 

I'd rather get effective vaccine, thanks. idea anyone would even consider it. Wait minute Redditors going boycot Johnson &amp; Johnson knowledge baby powder possibly abestos, company continues sell baby powder outside North America? I'm confused. Hair cut dentist appointment things I'm looking forward to...dentist especially lol. Reeeeally want teeth cleaned professionally bet I've got like five cavities now!

I eaten either. Even outdoorsy things I've avoided. risk greater benefit :/ There's thing vaccine facility manufacture novel vaccine.

Nowhere world mRNA vaccine mass production facilities start pandemic. lab-based manufacturing, trials done, nothing scale, much thought given mass production.

The way Pfizer Moderna manufacturing vaccines essentially method done lab, scaled parallel. engineers trying optimize process.

Because this, there's massive supply chain constraint, particularly around nanolipids. Pfizer Moderna scrambling address supply chains, Pfizer trouble Belgium. kinds export restrictions critical components supply chain.

My point never going possible Canada develop manufacturing capability mRNA vaccines, even Manhattan project start pandemic. Without domestic industry support entire supply chain, Canada would reliant foreign suppliers, many export restrictions.

Obviously every country working address this, going alleviated time goes on, something could throw money make happen.

Manufacturing attenuated virus vaccine obviously understood, would probably possible develop capability domestically. available supply make mRNA vaccines, Pfizer Moderna would already it. Oh normal. Classic America. you? Canada hasn’t experienced “full lockdown” AFAIK. Two pieces paper similar August date totality Uk-AZ/Oxford agreements.

You look UK's R&amp;D infrastructure investment earlier year see that... fair, sub existed years covid-19. Perhaps left scientists posting articles generic coronavirus study. already gambling one vaccination enough. want double risk early reduction lockdown well. gambles fail, result could spectacularly bad.

Think way, David Cameron gambled two referendums. one failing cost career. Cameron thought control gambles. Boris going take two gambles something can't control. cases cyclic Wednesdays/Thursdays always highest number cases dropping weekend. That's trend. That's test. That's use 7day rolling average slight upward trend. sma one. Unlike week ago average continuous drop weeks. 
It might early say pattern continue! cannot deny we're longer seeing decreasing trend seeing happy about.

German media also reporting Melbourne? 

Yeah close had. brother lives different. Restrictions enforced rely goodwill trust. saw sone right stupid shit going on. what’s science here? variants looking like cause deaths people vaccinated time infection? don’t want say much “defeating point” know might rhetoric truth. 

The summer probably early, vaccines good suggested right people actually getting sick, I’m sure see super spreader events people ragers. That’s say mind wearing masks many months shouldn’t continue businesses coming months, I’d like see science behind idea super spreader events among vaccinated people (speaking point future large majority adults want vaccinated vaccinated).

My bigger concern people acting like need strip masks now. seems like greater issue vaccinated parties. covid rear view mirror, movies ne convince people get less effective vaccine. that's big if. Look countries, wear masks even due air quality. said would still it, I'd expect anyone else too. never said afraid flu. picking choosing words fit narrative. BioNtech/Pfizer One least favorite articles ever. thought too. unfortunately kid daughters doctor told today looking year MINIMUM kids vaccine. new problems kids having, anyone child sixteen younger really needs stay lockdown kids get vaccinated. 

So basically I'm even halfway done yet. Ugh. Movie theater popcorn guilty pleasure always regret couple hours later, enjoy moment. Borris evil, amoral. Good. Everyone else one shot vaccine I'll take effective one. 

Why FUCK would anyone get lesson effective vaccine? I'll wait get pfizer moderna. Bruh. idea could buy vouchers. Noice.  agree 100%, simply going happen. Messaging already tenuous is. waffling masks look happened there. matter technicalities it. People told need masks told vital caused lot confusion pushback. CDC make mistake again. manufacturer recommended two doses that's going now. People got one dose think getting screwed over. better continue original plan. 

Since December 14 vaccine rollout going blistering pace reaching 1M/day mid January (after 1 month). currently 1.8M/day 13% vaccinated. continue accelerating pace, easier continue 2 doses per person already ton people vaccinated end March. frontline workers, hospital staff, teachers, everyone 60+ vaccinated, major danger gone anyway. Schools completely reopen, healthy people safely reasonably go masks, older people breathe little. Sorry live City Atlanta. Kids go city schools county. Trash us picked city county. Water city county (so sewage). airport part true impossible find space city airport. Clayton County (where airport is) still jail go arrested airport (DO GET ARRESTED ATL Airport!!!). Arrangements made Clayton County City Atlanta Atlanta operates airport. Boundaries definition arbitrary matter. definition matter geographically (I know exactly borders are...one twenty houses away me). Commerce dependant population centers ever driven Atlanta. covid19 mutations moving goalposts. going base plans scientific evidence happen. permanent fascination negative mutations? could positively mutate too!

It *does* positively mutate well — ""positive"" means example strain spread well within humans, strain wither away. evolutionary pressure filtering mechanism keeps negative ones surviving. yes, sorts mutations happen time. lot deaths area immigrants living household... kids got sloppy work hanging friends infected/killed parents grandparents

What said true, think America offload AZ countries don’t excellent vaccines. South Africa offloaded AZ. Surely market them? say ""good news sell papers"" 1100 month worth, things like alcohol soap causing super bacteria much concern. dangerous part overuse antibiotics (of small, finite amount antibiotic families know of), since bacteria evolve countermeasures them. can't happen easily alcohol soap. Alcohol soap (particularly alcohol) essentially rip destroy cell, antibiotic way careful specific ways kills hampers harmful bacteria. makes way less dangerous (don't drink antiseptic alcohol kids), also makes antibiotics easy sidestep.

Imagine trying poison kill someone (the bacteria). either use known allergy sneaking peanuts food choke death (which children might even have), could give half pint drain cleaner drink. allergy allows attack specific people (give crowd people peanuts target likely one die). There's way humans evolve protection drain cleaner next thousand years, within single generation child may inherit food allergy.

It's speculation, plenty economic factors: currency strength, access capital, liquidity, credit rating, inflation, GDP.

Right expecting 90Million Q2.

This article claims AZ provide less 90Million, much less - headline indicates it’s half expecting. Seems like bad idea, given CA viral mutation worse UK South Africa that's capable halving vaccine effectiveness. Meaning 30% chance she'll make 30% chance won't? Sorry know CFR acronym. They're tribe, species. daycare free? open really help many people can't afford it. People able work home use Grubhub Amazon instead things person extremely recently. Count blessings. I've trying get one like crazy. would qualified second round county never received vaccine second round. I've applied county work counties around live. Still luck looking good. county getting week, either. California. Anyone get think second part question got banned. take hardline stance around anything personal events stuff like that.
  
Also, honest, nobody really knows anything seasonality right Covid percentages lot stories off. 

We like 329 million people, get vaccine right anyhow since nothing's approved people 16.

There around 264 million people US age 16. [According poll looked up, 30% saying take ""only"" leaves like 176 million needing shots, many already least one dose.

Of course, dipshit brigade might keep us herd immunity really large poll suggests, we'll need extra doses loaded blowdarts start vaccinating (best use J&amp;J that, single shot all). That’s depressing cancer isn’t preventable doesn’t discriminate Ah trust vaccine either? Fair enough, care much supposed 'export ban' UK government apparently imposed mind think untrustworthy? happy filthy serum developed inherently inferior Brits infect good, clean European blood? this. said 6 million doses got delayed.

We’ve crafted society enact reasonable measures accommodate health issues. construct buildings allow wheelchairs access, make bumps sidewalks let blind people know approaching street. examples reasonable measures burden everyday people point aren’t worth enacting. 

For tiny percentage people cannot get vaccine, it’s simply worth massive inconvenience making rest us wear masks safety. falling places never locked well. US better per capita death rate UK states nothing. Lockdown might help little obviously enough make real difference especially light drawbacks lockdown.  Covid China? Lol Lollll got banned r/covid19 asking seasonality, guess ill come here. 

I see people attributing third peak seasonality. question seasonality coronaviruses typically start northern hemisphere? September? October? 

I’m cautiously planning small wedding beginning October (with hope guests vaccines - we’re Ohio) still would like respect science/seasonality. full system register well. kidding me? one stating forced masking eternity going forward. sound like someone r/conspiracy offer anything like state. :( Im referring data directly compares two. data impossible draw conclusion... shows we’ve collectively idiots decades, centuries: many people still died flu last decades mind boggling, could wear masks “have cold”, public transportation public places high traffic attendance, like supermarkets, cinemas etc ... mention sick leave shouldn’t something people can’t afford.  many Reddit contributors going claim know Fauci?
 
Remember early Fauci said masks necessary going cruise fine?

He ""expert"". !!!

So know less Fauci know asshole hole ground....what mean someone acting like authority viruses? principal standing on? cant believe got plane England US flu wear mask. days later fever dropped 100°F went back work part time cashier, still wearing mask Uh that's schools. school buildings well 30+ years old point, there's political raise taxes fund building new schools within existing neighborhoods. You’ll get credit hit even file eviction. It’s bullshit thing- even positive result favor case paying doesn’t remove credit. NYT Daily actually story months ago. absolutely reason bring topic first place point finger blame particular ethnic/religious group. users pointed evidence overall group vaccine-hesitant sweeping generalisations making unfounded. Let go. according blue checkmarks Twitter. gloom doom them. Statistically, CFR 80+ 130 million total end March; 44 million received least first dose far, enough another 86 million end March.

Note take account lag time vaccine shipped gets arm, seems take week two. true many Asian countries see mask usage (and pre-COVID far less likely get weird look wearing one), believe mask usage universal East Asian cities misled. 

While full spread across East Asia, I've worked Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore. winter, see mask wearing (maybe 10-20%?) Hong Kong Tokyo. Primarily street public transit, almost never office communal setting (ironically) spread happens. saw virtually masks Singapore, there's also winter (or even cool season) there. I've spent time Seoul well never winter, saw masks well. wrong. girlfriend flu That's spicy satire Also societal value, teachers educated certified, easily replaced 22-year-old behind checkout counter Kroger (who unlikely hospitalized) 92-year old living Social Security circling drain. Even doctors illogical stuff, lot training nurses.

Exhibit A: Andrew Wakefield. Well confusing occupational aspect. Work education? danger, importantly, source community spread.

Either vaccinate education workers, vaccinate age group. Combining two looks convoluted come sort indignant rhetorical questions. blah get vaccinated bleh? That's cheating line!

They vaccinated healthcare workers spreaders. vaccine education workers. schedule vaccines deliveries EU? Like exact numbers get many vaccines?  Thanks generalisation. Really added whole post. Nothing can't remedied. Europe needs get troops continent anyway; 4 years next insurrection hits USA latest. I'd say area similar. think I'd add restaurants capacity restrictions sporting events can't crowds. Well can. can't. Like high school spectators believe.  Almost thought ad Harry Potter is, fantastic people many *options*. I'll opt seeing people person activities bring joy life, want stick Zoom zero deaths world, free country Yeah moron. Someone saying 'no one following' mean 'no one following'. means 'enough' curb less transmissible virus. pushing END PANDEMIC. pushing lining AZ's executives pockets money people die.

The fact AZ shut entire factory, convert mRNA tech actually produce vaccine end pandemic. BioNtech German vaccine Astrazeneca used two months saving older people Covid UK.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* midwest US restaurants jam packed people wearing masks. Interesting Uruguay Chile, two countries ranked higher US list, account 3.5% population Latin America. rest population live countries ranked well Saudi Arabia Cuba. Half population lives Brazil Mexico ranked 94th 124th respectively. overwhelming majority people receiving vaccines live countries huge corruption problems.

en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_American_countries_by_population  totally unrelated news expect ship 50 million US April.. Canada BC reallllllllly lax restrictions, could go back ""normal"" pretty much wanted to. things really restricted gatherings household, nightclubs (unless random guy hosting apartment), *some* gyms closed mask mandate businesses currently eating.

That said freaking global pandemic I've treating such, really annoying scared put actual restrictions place (especially bad vaccination rates late) loads people less continuing life normal. sports teams want root absolutely disgusting, that’s is, ashamed.

Telling American treated redditors last year classic. Every day scoreboard count. First all, real-world efficacy much higher. proven. Besides, trial efficacy higher 60% anyway, you’ve pulled number thin air. Literal disinformation.

Second all, 60%, that’s still absolutely superb. They’re better worse, that’s valid comparison situation.

I’m pushing vaccine, I’m pushing vaccines. Haha. I'm Pennsylvania we're much better.

Where work supposed vaccinate us. But, they're struggling get doses 1a people. hear people say April May...I scoff that. wish so. But, infrastructure seems messed up.

Kind crazy big national strategy distributing better. literally seems like let states figure themselves. I’m butt hurt, soon it’s safe I’ll living life nothing barring way happily leave people like behind me. You’re dumbass intentionally holding back. also exact fucking kind person made pandemic drag long. forecasting supply demand, I'd imagine. is, much supply available coming soon vs many outstanding people eligible populations still need shots, adjusted account many people eligible populations refuse choose wait. refusal waiting percentages probably bit guessing game based community surveys prior knowledge, like flu vaccines. reasonably forecast supply outpace demand among eligible populations coming weeks, they'll open populations.   odd article. Who's even suggesting otherwise? Maybe good idea donate right maybe feel bit weather adding blood donation maybe enjoyable... what? Meanwhile Fauci said vaccines younger children even begin first quarter 2022. We're still long way end here.

And stop lying. dug bullshit months ago, thought found gotcha moment, wanted gloat it. Better luck next time. That's i'm at, vaccinated way people, still plan avoid unvaccinated. would problem hanging people vaccinated. Hey, that's better told us could potentially start *thinking* returning semblance normalcy! really glad made statement, scared thinking normalcy would offend lord Fauci I'll give point. bad Macron got involved ""French Pride"". ever suggest secret knowledge? whole point J&amp;J knew asbestos baby powder never changed said anything thousands women got ovarian cancer it. even suggest fuck best? think careful interpreting results trials hundred people contracted Covid. Scottish study, much robust data AZ (much higher n# tighter uncertainty intervals). would surprised didn’t also reduce transmission. think good plan would prime people AZ boost another. trials effect researchers think could actually confer superior immunity.  Thanks - wasn’t digging favour measures put place. curious question 👍  Yeah changed behavior created new government aid programs. Simply brute forced nuclear option.

I don’t think fold great insights next one dunno y'all I've built quite nice collection masks past year intend use long Covid gone (knock wood). can't believe used think nothing person next theater coughing sneezing. can't believe used think nothing going work cough... really. say assertively, understand unlikely ever know certainty original source virus. opinion circumstantial evidence points lab accident -- intentional lab leak. 

Even walked back recent investigation whose investigators said lab leak theory need research. However, investigation clouded well documented conflicts interests well concessions made parameters investigation mandated Chinese Government. investigators also stated publicly line Chinese Communist running state media virus imported via frozen food... scientist really agrees.

All ask, really coincidence outbreak started couple miles away Wuhan Institute Virology, China's one Level 4 Lab. question though: compare unvaccinated people mild symptoms AZ-vaccinated ones mild symptoms? entirely possible long covid happens former, since latter necessary antibodies prevent exponential replication virus. get bad feeling goalposts keep moving. “Oh three people died state week, can’t open completely up.” Yeah especially Texas. Bars packed tight weekend masks It'll tough subsequent years everybody's immune systems atrophied. ""coronavirus guidelines"" - doubt 'guidelines' force change minds. Right, 70% combined average 2 high dose shots low dose/high dose mix up. means spacing shots proved even important, initial efficacy like even lower 70%, 12 week spacing jumped around 83% believe. 

I'm disagreeing claim J&amp;J one-shot. They're currently running 2 shot trial, based Oxford data timeframe peak antibody levels, there's good reason believe (IMO) 2-shot protocol J&amp;J increase efficacy good bit. 

Even saying MRNA vaccine superior feel putting cart horse. terms preventing infection, sure. Scotland, Oxford vaccine seems reduce hospitalization risk Pfizer (4 weeks first shot). agree overall point though. multiple ""homerun"" vaccines, nobody reject basis one ""slightly"" better, especially since appear almost eliminate risk hospitalization death. appointments start going unfilled supply increases much would expect that, states start moving on. 

It's state state decision say state wants numbers slow going allow thousands appointments go unused long. It’s political yes, practical terms...

America proved completely incapable containing virus. Last year mounted possibly worst response developed world...so *some* benefit everyone Earth get control ASAP, mutates suddenly repel skylight. saving thousands lives would living fear Yeah agreed. That's ridiculous.

And things like exercise sunlight good you. message portrayed better this. Exercise! Eat better! healthy!

As country, large percentage overweight unhealthy people. guess easier lockdown tell people get shape! (Granted everyone get shape depending condition.)  NY added essential workers phase 65+ immunocompromised individuals?

Isn't basically like opening entire state? qualify point. that's true CT catch cases missed tests, scans China definitely missed lot people too. timing. take scan major damage done lungs, show up. CTs better tests, rather CT scans catch cases fell gap. end test perfect. least GSK/Sanofi honest meet targets protecting elderly. AZ continues muddle through. powers certainly implemented restrictions far less robust evidence already vaccines reduce transmission. contracts must made equally powerful parties? Seems like fantasy. Yes, doesn’t invoke reddit,emotional, political rage. long term effects using much hand sanitizer though? Explains I'm seeing clorox wipes shelves way more. numbers add quite simply. Covid contagious flu. Covid longer period presymptomatic spread flu. measures block decent amount covid infections block even greater portion flu infections. part difficult understand? 

Positivity rates flu testing available confirm lot flu anywhere right now. think governments nations faking flu test numbers? good thing many ways socialize without direct contact days I'm glad I'm getting first shot week don’t worry getting stuck J&amp;J Astrazeneca. first problem facebook first place

it's cancer society article interesting, certain points kind illustrate entire situation: EU really help companies set-up costs research, unlike US UK EU bet companies failed, Sanofi (vaccine said launch 2022) making brands vaccines France (starting next month) Compared UK/US, EU haggled prices down, tried prevent members negotiating doses alone, etc. resulted countries going alone getting Sputnik vaccine 


Non-factual interpretations: AstraZeneca victim smear campaign German press now, Germans wisdom decided inject staff hospitals time, got batch vaccine appears produce common-cold like side-effects resulted people missing days work, crippling hospitals. still shitting AZ vaccine today, yet efficacity seems proven via UK vaccine drive. 


Now UK proved vaccine work, EU wants quickly, DE/FR/ES/etc. struggling.

It'll interesting see plays out. AZ high ground, EU trying make look bad, like tried get Pfizer send doses got shut back.

Congratulations US UK good vaccine policy strategy, EU proven disjointed really are. forced sell 200k house 10 years eating away nothing. 

Take wealthy old lady! We're Lockdown I'm atleast. Things open restrictions.

Going store, know covid thing here.

But, sporting events still shutdown. understand wanting hang risk, unvaccinated person fear tiny risk spread. also understand wanting hang vaccinated people unvaccinated yourself, willing wait turn. jam, least see logic.

It's ""the vaccine changes nothing!"" saying two vaccinated people still can't even hug whatever, grinds gears. Clearly vaccine helps *something* else wtf point getting vaccine? Also let's use brains - decent amount spread symptomatic vaccine prevents symptoms high amount cases, spread logically go down. Maybe zero, down. 

It's like pre-conceived logic got thrown window year. Yes, need cautious, let's pretend virus different throw book logic previous viral research window. Connecticut announced lowering threshold 55+ Mar 1. Would expect announcements states next week two. Idk jab doctor's hope people go doctor prevent either. go problems need solution. Pretty sure doctor would prevent people sought prevention. teachers GA driving AL get vaccinated. still haven’t vaccinated vast majority people 1A. I’m younger healthy, don’t anticipate receiving vaccine June. makes sense case. case, sort thing happens time. probably 100s 1000s process improvements margins certainly incredibly complicated supply chain No, think reserve Sanofi, even agreed use production lines vaccines. senior citizen qualify Medicare? Disgraceful company, absolute horror show. CDC said fully vaccinated need self-isolate even known exposure, quarantine symptoms. AZ probably wont approved US, would US produce it? disagree that? asleep here? Government instituted lockdowns, yes, wrong. People general public supported attacked fellow citizens spoke it, wrong too. wealthy supported lockdowns got richer (generally speaking) lockdown caused greatest transfer wealth history country. know this, people sub many many others deny tooth nail can’t understand anyone would think lockdowns bad slightest. attack I’m side here? win dude. US vaccines made United States. US doesn’t give crap EU gets zero billion vaccines plants outside America. skip middleman soak gin. conspiracy, certain places testing flu, covid. coworker (in different town) COVID/flu symptoms tested COVID strep (due sore throat), flu.

She low fever, cough, chills, sore throat, aches, loss taste/smell etc. Tested negative COVID/strep, told random virus. Exactly, Pfizer/Biontech showing really best effort sending doses EU. Currently 200 million doses expected Q2 alone looking possibly increasing high number. Moderna also deliver decent quantities Q3. appears mRNA technology much easier scale terms production quantities. Unless J&amp;J manage deliver meaningful quantity vaccine, looks like EU population large vaccinated arguably better mRNA vaccines. teacher mostly taught online now, usually get sick September, November, December, January, March.

I sick year. Ok successful civil cases one year in?  would think low household attack rate disproves this. 

Droplets travel air currents, neither CDC recognizes airborne. wife’s boyfriend knows someone canada bad experience free healthcare don’t like idea know OK move onto next vaccine rollout phase? 🤣🤣🤣 Agreed.

Edit: r/holup That's doses AZ, total doses obviously. total, Germany receive 80 million doses Q2. yellow right? green? 0 cases day? Well ""with attitude"" powerful people like keep regular people like fighting, take money.

Wake fuck up. Well, I'm going keep wearing masks get sick. Definitely worth it. Enjoy influenza covid. I’d lying said didn’t, use dirty diapers, go fast come in.

Plus I’m old lady, it’s okay. Ban exports what? AZ exporting vaccine product EU countries. could ban export AZ change thing.

Or mean banning Pfizer exports (which others already paid for) leaving EU? imagine would work UK reciprocated banned export lipids vital european Pfizer production? click link above. Keep mind 70 million able vaccinated. receive enough vaccines vaccinate 75% population end June. Considering 20% get 20% ""wait probably get it"" that's good enough. I'm latinamerican take grain salt: little complicate that. maybe? 

I remember reading Pfiezer asked Argentina contract signed president term ""negligence"" ""patrimonial indemnity"" excluded specific laws Argentina declined. Why? really I've never felt weak. I'll never forget extreme fatigue felt lying bathroom floor. Yes worth considering contributing factors getting COVID

It's really not. 

Fighting anti-mask sentiment, absolutely worthwhile. propagating idea ""*those irresponsible people get covid!*"" ""*They must distanced!*"" fuckwit material. 

The vast majority cases occurred people tried best. Talking shit people contracted covid arrogance personified, somehow better susceptible. they're ""dirty"" ""what wearing *that* *that* neighborhood?!?!"" style bullshit thinking.

If breathe, susceptible. Stop demonizing people fallen ill serious virus ultimately spread beyond control due abject failure government levels, internationally. actually get single shot rifle shotguns.

They actually kind (inhale deeply) both. grip mounted directly barrel like brake barrel shotgun, makes rifle less accurate, light weight makes shotgun kick like absolute (maternal fornicator)

Auto mod silly **[Non-paywalled mirror link](http://archive.today/QCPO7) article** credible evidence mrna risky? ask friend -- actually working PhD studying influenza's spread evolution IIRC. We've talked little think remember telling birds virus' ability survive water while. probably endemic (and areas) among waterfowl, based reply maybe interacting farm animals and/or hunted spreading humans there. Probably southeast Asia place endemic, high population density places along also lot rural area, makes sense could fertile ground diseases like this. Absolutely! discussed commentor IG. However look data we’re still testing people flu, albeit fewer tests previous years, % positives gutter. shows A) Masks, social distancing, flu vaccination works B) infectious CoVid compared flu, largely concern CoVid general. isn’t necessarily much deadly seasonal influenza, infectious is, kill far people. Lolwat  can't really isolate different regions say approach area independently reduced flu rates. Flu strains circulate globe, mass disruption spread one area ripple effects parts world. 

Plus, I'm sure anywhere US described ""minimal effort."" Even lax restrictions beyond would tolerated typical flu season. purpose restrictions recommendations like wearing masks specifically limit infection transmission virus. limit limit viruses ability replicate possibility emergent variants. 

edit: don’t restrictions place risk waisting preventable deaths give virus opportunity spread harm. difference thousands lives. that's something shrug at. also major change economic activity everything open back month two earlier. makes sense though. restrictions meant Covid, clearly contagious flu. even people following restrictions don’t wear masks like should, amount help apparently enough keep flu control. pandemic, people would often go work mild flu symptoms send kids school them, something tolerated now. Also, keep mind flu, it’s mostly elderly people need hospitalized (which measured here), elderly - general - mind covid restrictions better younger people (because covid hits harder well) especially nursing homes etc. 
The flu shot pushed pretty hard year. sure it’s additional amount? yep different things leveraged appropriately assuming people charge scientists lawyers notion getting J&amp;J vaccine equates risking health preposterous. I'm sorry misinterpreting J&amp;J publication. think one business predicting happen fall. obvious point can't really predict trajectory covid. Prepare worst case hope best case. Wait wtf covid really much contagious I'll save click: Yes can. imposter sus! think flu diagnoses actually flu-like symptoms diagnoses, typical year's flu season makes sense equate two rather testing specific influenza. Extreme cases flu probably also lot people would normally die flu, died covid. There's probably chance dual infection well, covid tested found search stops there, could flu well. 

People ignore mask guidelines probably infected whole bunch crap, making highly infectious subsample population. subsample probably huge overlap anti-vax/anti-medicine crowd would avoid doctor started showing symptoms.

This opinion, think flu closer ignored right eradicated. definitely think flu pumping covid numbers, testing gotten pretty widespread, especially among infected. Dual infections might thing though. comment linking webmd.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

It stands reason could increases transmission come next fall winter amongst gotten vaccinated people might voluntarily cautious due PTSD we've past year, can't see anything mandatory per se. said, would absolutely political societal point think restrictions would even necessary public health/epidemiological perspective. understand defending headline, trying move goalposts try claim sufficient data.

There reason believe vaccine ineffective, data show ineffective, yet newspaper question stated fact vaccine ""8% efficacy"", entirely false.

If think appropriate publish false efficacy figures political attempt undermine vaccine, guess done here. extremely anxious. mom took 2 Tylenol second shot. reading everywhere advised don’t take painkillers prior vaccine could interfere immune response. overly cautious recommendation seriously going get properly vaccinated now? seriously worried? remember people talked Canada ordered huge number doses compared population, would surely tons left pass on!

Haha, ha

:( It’s almost masks social distancing work reduce spread respiratory viruses... Sometimes people hard time cooling upstairs bedroom, generally issue keeping inside cool. summer days usually 100+. Worse night hardly cooler all. years ago like 60+ days 105 days actually closer 110. truly miserable dressed beach. great article interested vigilantly policing every single dollar goes person need it’s fucking radio silence way corporate entities appropriate funds. 

600 dollars week would barely cover expenses cities. yet countries less resources less time prepare achieved that. 35 deaths Vietnam approximately 120 adjusted relative population. control group 21 people, none hypertension, skewed gender proportions. Additionally, one main questions asked was, “Have experienced following symptoms due illness?” wouldn’t expect healthy individuals report symptoms experiencing result illness.

Yes, control group existed, would call proper control group Vaccines started two month ago, supply small hundred thousand doses lies around freezers system broken. heard new variants even transmissible ?

This mostly fear-mongering. vaccines effective preventing death hospitalization new variants, also cases kept plummeting since discovery. Summers looking like gonna semi normal sure. get that! also like first good sniff something almost like really differentiate scent, fades.

I could smell citrus body wash good second morning, kept trying smell eventually smelled like nothing all? That's original government contract called for. u/veryniceguy2 R/Denver creating website getting vaccines Colorado.

[Here post it] webiste] I’ve seen term “hygiene porn” used describe performative covid prevention  take word it. Slow bud see happening many follow rules now. also confident America fewer deaths World. put perspective. Normalcy March unrealistic. Sorry ;( distinctly recall boated bottom lake number times people claiming reinfection ""couldn't possibly happen"", yet are. Still far cry April, though, originally projected. price minor inconvenience step far, man. Vaccine trials. covid vaccine, risk severely underrepresented trials. reopened allow dance. There's really measure ""dance again."" me...it’s Paul McCartney again. Man 70s. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Gottlieb previously optimistic vaccine rollout? fairness, he's another Fauci. Compared rest first world, Americans tend anti-vaccine statistically. 

However, pointing ultra-conservative religious communities higher anti-vaccine sentiment ""completely incorrect"" least. America Israel, ultra-orthodox high rates anti-vaccine sentiment, Amish parts America, hardcore Islamists, among super conservative Christians. 

Nobody said ""all"", save silliness. article: 
 swab samples processed analysed scientists Public Health England (PHE) every week survey prevalence different respiratory diseases population.  685,243 samples reviewed PHE’s laboratories since first week January, single one tested positive influenza. problem. I’ll even send beaver. think experience broken lot already fragile, neurotic people. 

Ouch, don’t sugarcoat anything tried explaining doctor covid even though nasal swab came back negative wrap head around idea. mean body loaded epithelial tissue infected, crosses blood brain barrier hand brain. diseases like Ebola go epithelial/endothelial tissue hide balls months. nope covid either nasal swab ... almost 12 months later still suffer long term covid shit.  think willingness people forgo accept restrictions second holiday season zero. Find country island, democracy beat covid, wait. know little biological viruses, real question trying smart combative either; know different influenza COVID-19 SARS variant viruses? think that's logic that's getting twisted misinformation. expect make 100 million I’ve seen one company deal. That’s net add 130MM ~60MM vaccinated far, correct? feasibly around 190MM Americans least one dose?

Wow. tried burnt orange trick? I've heard nothing I've also heard instant cure random people internet 2 bucks take try probably worth it. would eat nut sack virus circulating without knowledge November could stopped 1,000 deaths regardless president was. even draconian like response Italy China kept death toll 1,000. Fucking pipe dream people here. problem feed eachothers panic modes end departing reality lol Attitudes different October cases skyrocketing. would governors lockdown case numbers falling fast everyone hungry normal? They’ll tell flu deaths still marked covid deaths part bill gates wank dream That's joke pretty much proves population blamed 'slacking off' adhering rules. lets one doubt credibility whole article. Fauci literally says Biden's plan better video. says ""we're starting zero going see real ramping up"". 

So wrong. Trump plan, good Biden's. Well alleviate concerns still getting far mRNA vaccines delivered that's good you. Also, make point try find locations using vaccine try make sure go place giving mRNA vaccines. suspect they'll handing J&amp;J vax people without health issues anyway initially. 

No one force take J&amp;J want it. He’s always predicting storm coming.    supply demand. decide get business entirely, may sell people plan buy live (reducing rental supply). can't find buyer lower price (e.g. different landlord make profitable lower expenses), may sit property, better empty property improve tenant occupying (and causing wear tear, outright damage) paying.

These extra expenses incurred landlords **will** get passed renters, one way another, whether higher prices fewer options, both. also aspect vaccines may resilient mutations, makes sense spread eggs different baskets. Thank you. convince Neo-Nazis sign get vaccinated? rhetoric many subreddits virus spreads, entirely people wearing masks. look thread virus spreading somewhere, bound see comments showing 'In area, went insert supermarket no-one wearing mask'. generally become top-upvoted comments visible. rarely mention factors facilitate spread virus lingering surfaces many people touch even masks, virus still spread. Likewise, virus spread low, comments going mask compliance high.

In conclusion, virus spreading thanks covid restrictions strategies prevent spreading, vast majority people must partaking measures. distribution company UK bigot live NY. I’ll send canoe Lake Ontario, alright? 

Just send syrup back here! Quick status update Sweden anyone interested:

To combat new mutated variants spreading rapidly, several regions (at least Stockholm, Gävleborg Västerbotten, think also Västra Götaland) starting recommend face masks public transport times days, also indoor environments hard keep distance. national guideline face masks recommended rush hours public transport.

Other new measures include distance teaching grades 7-12, whereas earlier mixed distance teaching grades 10-12 time.

The government also looking tightening restrictions maybe even closing shopping centers, gyms restaurants. Since pandemic raging nearly year. Someone make video map world showing every day pandemic showing case numbers per country America many vaccines coming doesn’t need take risks Pfizer/Moderna. 

Perhaps administering one dose makes sense places like Canada need supply 2021 much stronger. 

I think lot Americans willing wait months order take vaccines way vaccines studied. 

We’ll see. Also lot potentially serious flu cases probably got COVID make it. Uh oh  agree hindsight 20/20, local governments still haven’t learned. 

A year pandemic KNOW virus simply spread outdoors. Countless protests, parades, election celebrations, events “supposed” super spreader events panned out. Beaches packed summer NY/NJ lowest infection numbers. supported every scientific study. 

Despite knowledge, Los Angeles still allowing outdoor dining fullest extent. real people make living restaurant industry. Outdoor dining beautiful climate like LA would helped local economy. Cal Berkeley isn’t allowing outdoor exercise.

The EU vaccine portfolio UK US one. anything they're less dependent UK UK exact production delays EU facing, difference invested manufacturing months earlier time iron issues.

No, difference started vaccinating December due earlier approval, AZ completely trashed also purchased every type vaccine realising would winners

The EU purchased vaccines 5-6 different manufacturers. Sanofi never ""big main hope"" covered 20-25% deliveries initial plans, AZ slightly BioNTech J&amp;J. Bottom country infrastructure, education, economy yes, healthcare. Massive opioid problem. People would rather die rock face let kids move 22d century. Trump cult 70% one legislators leading insurrection. Face facts it’s huge surprise State well Covid vaccination it’s news. low risk category live covid-conscious life, would make great deal sense give people like slightly less effective vaccine waiting supplies become available.

But choice ""yes vaccine"" ""no vaccine"". could, example, continue quarantine months effective vaccine available. likely quarantine effective J&amp;J vaccine, would increasing risk.

And sure, quarantine get J&amp;J vaccine even better protection. think everyone operating assumption get one vaccine, get J&amp;J, never offered another one.

So people rather reasonably might choose continue quarantine months exchange better protection. 3rd insane numbers. 85% Pfizer, 94% AstraZeneca. 50 states following different policy. free travel them. 

With Trump providing central coordination /s want change? Yank funding. International trade still continuing, know nothing.

The borders closed tourists.

And yet spoke like knew talking about, Aus NZ trade continues without issue. refuse compare Sweden neighbours? think delusional. Vaccines last forever. future covid surges, going really bad. like bad flu seasons except much much much worse. article suggest prevent future outbreaks going control again, social distancing measures would need reinstated back control again. reason eventually countries able control virus first second waves. virus just...leave own. US done worse 184 countries, Fauci's characterization remains accurate.  know talking comparing NZ lockdowns life US point last year.

You make even clearer know anything claim normalcy summer. Could hermits stay home let rest us live. Hell yes we'll running arms May.

In head, said voice stereotypical New Yorker movie: 

**""Hey!! We're runnin' outta arms here!!!""** can't. can’t compare numbers different trials

Each trial involve different people different places, definitions used decide whether disease different too. two vaccines compared “head-to-head” trial accurately judge one working better another, rarely done. It’s really hard resist making comparisons vaccines results different phase 3 trials comparisons misleading.""

That's right line 30-40% estimate. declared presumptive nominee 2024 head Republican party — sure keep telling fantasy it’s move on. Look comments decide guy biases. one guys compare Sweden neighbours, New Zealand Taiwan refuses even look European nations.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* LMAO understatement year. thousand. minimizing symptomatic infections, infections. near tell, zero data confirmed effective (or vaccines) reducing asymptomatic infections. probably do, much matter lot.

If people use vaccination engage risky behavior, might actually find worse position. :/ vaccines initially tested 3-4 weeks, keep clinical trials short possible. proof 3-4 weeks optimum. AZ since testing longer intervals. thread living proof terrible America, Americans are.

90% ignoring article talking either crow country hoarding vaccines solve pandemic, cause problems line.

Then another 5% talking getting back normal, even tho mid-pandemic STILL.

People clapping back heartless country's response been, ignoring STAGGERING death toll, deaths continue day.

The future planet grim US China strongest countries world give shit ptheir people, let alone people world enlightened era well truely dead. social distancing equally stupid. calling bot like I've said peak Internet brain. commander Royal Canadian Mounted Police county [said escalated “education, opportunity compliance, lastly, enforcement” regards GraceLife objective “is interrupt church services, prohibit services, deny peoples’ right practise religion—merely ensure public health restrictions adhered so.” Bot test: reply falsely claiming I'm masks? Okay see stupid think strategy proposed ""Never see friends family again"". Apologies, known better. Listing UK example socialist system hilarious. seems German correspondent writing. Maybe it’s copy paste job translating German reporting. Without mouth sideways effect? Good job following recommendations, like people observed.  PSA: two successful countries UK Israel close 'socialized' Healthcare could get.
Other countries develop vaccines. exporting, even evil enemies China /Russia (now depends party root guess) exporting.
I totally get US strategy , pointing successful. moral problem exporting, get angry. Americans literally justify nuclear bombing countries protect fellow citizens refuse wear fucking mask. Truly amazing see. OK, guess me. permanent harm anyone 417K. country lot internal movements cities, interstate travel, global travel countries world top off. miss ""long term"" part comment? need stop covid, I'm opposed masks. ""Never see friends family again"" viable. state dont sign county live literally said it. literally walked back.

Yes happens pandemic caused entirely new virus. understanding knowledge changes know protocols. much idea virus spread initially, masks would effective needs wear them. studies conducted guidelines evolved. Fauci scientist, nigh omniscient being. advise based whatever information available moment. understanding things work moron (rhetorical question, answer necessary)? Also Netherlands last week! One thing definitely true:

When one person sick home, pretty much everyone else gets it. AZ per week

That frustrating low. much privileged fucking first world baby you? fucking pandemic going killing millions people wear fucking mask get close people. FAA recommends fitting mask helping others EU insists antagonising UK left.

The victim complex full show. \*fewer stats quite work like that. better worse said. 15% chance severe covid-19 compared previous risk, already pretty low. 

But study count ""long covid-19"" reportable outcome basically counted stuff landed hospital. permanently losing ability run exercise would still considered good result land hospital.

The vaccine _probably_ protects extent that, know data. Exactly, thank you. delays even AZ behaving irresponsibly. particles get initial infection/exposure likely end ICU longer. seems consensus data available. guy dodgy best. trust judgement. source would recommend. Looked timeline, he's unreasonably skeptical way through. I'll wait expert commentary instead.

There even bit admits understand completely disregards purely understand it. 1) true people healthy strong immune systems decreased risk contracting covid?  


2) infection death counts high sick people susceptible contracting can't fight off? 


As always, sources appreciated. People also care long term solution involves getting lives back.  People asian countries wear masks voluntarily cold. nothing would even myself. 

I however strongly mask requirements deaths dropped single digits vaccinations 70%. delivering product amount uncertainty incidence virus. one year, everyone knows governments decide short side situation changing weekly basis. 
Of course can't predict future, Biontech kept promised assumed future. claim exact opposite burden prove yours. nothing magic fact blind speculation assumption based source topic. blind speculation. that's true 4 7 people county infected dont see possible. Look hiv went. Simple testing, protection yet still spreader like wildfire local idiots people lined miles run out. get local pharmacy without standing line day maybe I'll get one. Norway Finland much lower density populated places. Population-weighted density around 2200 Sweden, like 700-800 Norway Finland. fully understand stats, maybe someone 44,325 people trial. 468 symptomatic cases studied. 5 died COVID-19 placebo group none vaccine group. confidence interval that?

Is reduction 5 0 statistically significant? understand risks breathing people's germs, betcha we'll see people wearing masks even required. Heck, might even reduce annual flu deaths way. Hitler medical establishment worried lockdown might serious question? actually unfamiliar what’s going Malaysia “gotcha” explain you’d tell that’s technically definition failed state? ""If trust rest world accurately report Covid deaths would disagree""

That's American thing say. ignorance, holy shit. higher up. initial argument plenty coherent, since able comprehend slightest I'm going waste time reading essay stupid OPINIONS. yes, even though clearly think omnipotent, opinion still that, opinion. follow recommendations relaxed. someone living EU, tough see UK US far ahead, knew time frame along. low number vaccinations January February, increase March, high numbers starting April - communicated December, far appear track. Everything eased 5 week intervals, first one schools 2 weeks. reasoning gives chance see effect previous stage hospitalisations going further. 

The exception 5 week thing seems 29 March outdoor stuff, that’s probably line Easter holidays. Schools finished bit slack ease studies virus years interesting unfortunately see average 7,500 deaths day America. state Minnesota, 62% 6500 Covid deaths long term care residents. It’s unfortunately small amount total cases majority deaths. Also unfortunate Google search says life expectancy LTC resident 12 months. We’ll see guess decent % deaths tough shape begin with. know grandpa died March 2019 would’ve likely died LTC... also terrible diabetes 3/4 heart wasn’t working     great news let's get ahead ourselves. best knowledge still know vaccine effective mutations can't know effective mutations come. Combine fucking idiots/conspiracy theorists/political religious zealots think vaccine evil opting ruining heard immunity may around while.

I want get rid mask able see friends family too. rushing forward set us back again. 

Cautiously optimistic phrase use here. Yea take issue comments like pretending care know expected society. like country bred sociopaths. Talk covid act like want world shut forever. ignorant understand propaganda bought wanting profit unnecessary death.  problem lot studies lack proper control group rely self-reported data surveys.

There control group study... yet anti covid people think proves covid cover 🤦‍♂️ still spread/mutate amongst species, never truly eradicated. building house right dont want credit hit would probably look like Spanish Flu, right? Flu manageable problem throughout lifetimes specifically aren’t immunologically naive. Kids growing naturally gathering immunity COVID. 50 60 years people alive don’t level protection. Sounds like family looking excuse start eating gin-soaked raisins! using photo someone getting shot Tel Aviv? Thank you, thought misleading read sources, wanted check bias well. 

It’s annoying thousands followers third time I’ve caught spreading disinfo month.  There's thing called learn it.

For example, measles' R0 high someone measles room walked room 6 hours left, could still catch measles them.

Not infectious diseases equally transmissible. example, there's entire *group* diseases hard transmit, generally *sex* person catch it. won’t really help issue flu HA active site amazingly flexible mutations. need vaccine targets conserved root HA get good universal long lasting flu vaccine market barely down.  amazing! 


Looking information [this see 65 account 373,428 460,234 recorded Covid deaths. That's 80%! Imagine, could two months away seeing 80% reduction lethality disease! 


And mind you, article talking additional 140 million doses, that's top 65 million already administered, could seeing 90-95% reduction around May June. Mark words, even achieve herd immunity year still come time summer Covid looks like flu bad year.  mention frequency 'high-dose' infections back spring?!
Masks almost non-existent back people clued airborne transmission. Surely many infections back would started lungful counts well threshhold.  Someone downvoted reason, think correct. likely yearly vaccinations new variants. Like yearly flu shots same. Doesn’t mean thing.  No. Less half us take flu vaccine average 30-60% effective depending year/strain. Less half us took vaccine 2020 well. can’t believe took global pandemic get people take hand washing seriously. That’s something I’ve thought take seriously since kid, always seemed like exception pre-COVID days. I’d wash hands make sure every part hand/fingers got good scrub lathered soap, guy finished taking nasty shit stall would come spend two seconds wetting hands haphazard pump soap didn’t even time lather. 

It’s like, people realize actually work soap hands work properly right?? Covid pushes flu.

Link study viral interference coronavirus influenza? papers I've read(1,2) show increases severity symptoms, making even important get flu shot.


Influenza Vaccination COVID19 Mortality Flu Vaccination May Protective Effect Course COVID-19 Pediatric accurate? Last checked USA 8th worst terms Covid deaths per capita. Regardless, that’s still enough people create herd immunity, believe also read private corporations collecting tissue homicide victim corpses, time forensics people there, corpse scavenged parts there's much study. Probably better HCQ Definitely remember that, that's awful. Yah, although common h1n1 Uhgggg ok chad let explain joke you. Jesus you’re exhausting. I’m saying suck sarcastically guys leaps bounds better us every aspect coronavirus quality life general. I’m making fun article saying we’re somehow better position guys. I’m making fun Americans looking anywhere internally. It’s joke we’re comparing anyone. joke. Jesus man... didn’t think I’d spell you. must blast parties. guess everybody wants fully vaccinated end May.

The math: 2M+ doses per day moving forward (we’ve already 1.5M Pfizer/Moderna track much more)

260M American adults

50% American adults likely want vaccine right away (60% later time)

130M people vaccinate 260M doses 2-dose

70M doses already administered

190M doses left administer take ~90 days end May.

If ends 60% adults, timeframe still similar 20M vaccinations single dose we’ll probably closer 3M per day things speed anyway. even though surface transmission already said severe originally thought, there’s still people insist wiping everything, see playgrounds superspreaders.

lol parents still hoarding chlorox 11 half months in. Ignorant question would someone prefer JnJ others? Isn’t *less* effective? Yes current scenario seems uni owns student. guess missed joke. Still, propaganda makes J&amp;J vaccine seem better even good two seems dangerous. reality vaccine acceptable significantly inferior. Take get, possible find way get one others. lockdowns masks work, wild. else that? jail time I'm completely tar feathers.

Who else that? jail time I'm completely tar feathers. took basketball hoops public courts last may kept off. 

Heaven forbid kids play basketball get exercise outside. Better keep locked inside year. Bottom sure, EU contract says Brussels may suspend payments AstraZeneca fails deliver, specifically states AstraZeneca may impending contracts would hinder ability supply EU. also states AstraZeneca’s performance “impeded competing agreements, AstraZeneca shall deemed breach” agreement EU.  

UK agreement penalties missing deliveries required much greater notice. EU agreement not, specifically states effectively subservient agreements waives right sue.

Hilariously effectively written contract must make best effort deliver fulfilling parties orders. incompetence highest order.   catch hate it. wedding I'm tired catering everyone's level comfort, put qualifiers buffer. enough people though. 

I think it'll get easier late spring rolls around, US want vaccine least scheduled. almost certain flu got basically suppressed covid likely almost completely unrelated everything else. data suggest April 2020...

So Prof Pagel solid data, say whatever feel like. would violate medical privacy laws 

Nope. already require vaccination records school, college, certain jobs. Stop pulling stuff ass.    Hurray, yet another vaccine Canadian never see one study\[10\] wikipage puts R0 high 5.7. source \[9\] wikipdage refers several studies says:"" initially estimated R0 1.4-2.5 (average 1.95), however recent review 12 studies estimated basic R0 3.28 median R0 2.79. "" paper say review 12 papers refers to. 

So, would say 3 much likely value R0 ""a bit 6"".  problem government/media/corporate/whatever try’s way hard accommodate non white community turn ends racist.... one wants talk 
It’s really simple, vaccinate every human matter color background. true, long Covid impact many people. won’t know full impact many years. 

The driving metrics Rt, percent positivity PCR results hospitalization. Yes, aside 18-24 incidence rate isn’t far off. 

I’m hopeful get somewhere large scale vaccinations herd immunity sooner later, I’m holding breath sooner summer.  Sued? means nothing. Come back he's indicted. INB4 people start claiming tanking stock market proof **VARIANT SZN** coming it’s gonna bad.  Would really work Scotland keep hard lockdown England re-opens? create huge amount pressure Scottish government re-open also, since people could travel England? like people getting tested covid sick, come back negative, bother getting tested flu go home wait out. He's face government response. may logistics expert somebody putting piece paper front says expect X-doses Y-date.

He's messenger. see latest stinker masks Q2 2022: news getting good people getting excited. So, pissed everyone's Cheerios keep us going hog wild public. well US boisterous group hates/doesn't wear masks Nope.

If choose food &amp; gas flu shot, going flu shot. know anyone circumstances chose flu shot things like food &amp; gas.

If live US like that, something changing society live people choose food &amp; gas getting flu shot. Yep. big wimp comes needles, essentially ran clinic first day open flu vaccines, even flinch either 2 moderna vaccines. excited get vaccinated needle fear even register. One could known last June, case fatality rates began fall around world. testing better hospital treatment protocols.

Nah dude definitely gin soaked raisins rosary beads else that? jail time I'm completely tar feathers. Also recent vaccine supply news it’s almost certain high risk vaccinated Feb/March April May open season. Except taxes scale insurance doesn't. lose job lose insurance. anxiety uninsured sucks. devastated Scottish “exit” strategy lockdown. basically non existent makes English one look reckless comparison anything cautious. can’t go living like EXACTLY I'm talking about.

Even everything we've seen last year, still multiple replying saying ""hur dur, wuz politicol.""

The idea Trump could shut Mexican border January people absolutely lose fucking minds joke. get mine already 

I’m sick hearing medical workers old people refusing vaccine, like ok dude fuck give it

I don’t care don’t want stop holding line [this study suggests viruses compete hosts suppress prevalence one another, even inside host ‘broad-acting http://Visualping.io

She told checks periodically won’t necessarily ping moment state vax site updates, worked well hospitals monitoring. Good luck!!  think people know vaccine they're getting.

For one, ethical aspect inject foreign substance someone's body. brings obligation tell person exactly injecting.

And, practical note, differ second shot: J&amp;J requires none (yet), Pfizer 3 weeks, Moderna 4. giving shot, know person receiving available second round. know second round happen (or won't), know vaccine get. Yeah average 5m/wk point it’ll curved slope acceleration. 

I can’t wait dig threads November go “wow things weird”. 

Already kind toilet paper/mask rush March last year.  gonna good  spreading myth? handing cash...I'm black...from waist down! super-spreading US. expect relaxed guidelines, caveat two tossed cover low probability risks. I'm aware taxes do. saying free pay insurance, also free pay taxes  Ask physician need bit education. several things could mean need social measures. 
Hopefully unlikely, far certain won’t. 
If immune enhanced infection emerges won’t much option hygiene measures. Forgot consequence: even harder large group people rent landlords institute tougher credit standards. I'd say 22,000 lot better wealthy countries. whatever. People dying sucks.

Anyways fucked topic. COVID TERROR THREAT: ELEVATED What's handle? Pfizer, Pfizer delays EU currently. Again, weird it. Almost like sign date relation words BioNTech’s founder; Şahin: “Unfortunately, unable give details contracts. process Europe certainly proceed quickly straightforwardly countries.

Yet again, Pfizer delivering schedule, modest delays mostly contained within week respect stated stated contract actually

It didn't. use UK plants, name EU embarrassingly walk back contract publicized every lawyer planet took AZ's side.

Factually wrong. find opposing arguments within 30-seconds Google search. also, quarter AZ formally breach anything, goal EU go court get vaccines. fun enjoying day increase transmission itself, long done safe, low-risk manner (such outdoors getting sun/Vitamin D). beginning stages finally going away, least THINK happening. I'm even sure I'm downvoted fact people tired COVID. cautious necessarily bad thing. Percentage total global deaths mortality rate deaths per capita. different statistics. Scotland, largest study far, suggests performs significantly better Pfizer preventing hospitalization single dose Scotland, largest study far, suggests performs significantly better Pfizer preventing hospitalization single dose. Nope! (Thankfully) province claim medical exemption except airplanes proof medical condition required. still mandated get vaccinated claim medical exemption. schools described studies ive read sound like lot schools personally know about. It’s also issue effects races socioeconomic classes evenly. J&amp;J court ordered pay almost 5 billion women developed ovarian cancer using products? J&amp;J lied 3 decades baby powder containing high amounts asbestos? Yeah, I’m think I’m good shit. I'll wait good stuff rate, take it. crushing thing lately. hyped get virus behind us. Perhaps MHRA staffed scientists actually know doing?   Leave tiktok romanticize pandemic... come conclusion air crisp back then, therefore want go back like March... soon thousands people per day start dying, worse, blocking hospitals, inhaling trace amounts tobacco minutes, importantly, expelling characteristic time days. deniers keep vomitting equivication, make ok.

Tell cool grandpa story people lost children pandemic, im sure agree gotta break eggs make omelette. /s Covid cases vaccines everywhere got hit CA last hub. beginning heard immunity looks like.

If look deaths state graphs similar 1918. first places hit big spike residual (New York). remaining smaller bumps since ready still got hit. agree ditch masks likely wear one long governor mandate place, hopefully beyond summer unless live meme state like California know people preach zero covid policies bit touch reality, really put critical care unit that? tell Germans. like wasting AZ vaccines using daddy Lauterbach told us inferior. EU _never_ allow France UK doing. one that’s 60% effective right? right, proof. Also, everything know **AZ** far indicates efficacy grows longer timing shots (up 12 weeks).

But also non-peer-reviewed based real-world data Scotland clearly increased time peak 28-34 days post-vaccination  vaccines.

For **Biontech** yields:

||VE %|CI %|
|:-|:-|:-|
|7-13 d|38|28 47|
|14-20 d|60|50 68|
|21-27 d|72|62 79|
|**28-34 d**|**85**|**76 91**|
|35-41 d|68|53 79|
|42+ d|64|49 75|

This indicates optimal interval 4 5 weeks **Biontech** independently ""keep trial short""-argumentation.  ""Everyone vaccinated September!"" --Lying politicians  I'm UK voted 'remain', way EU handled covid shady actions around AZ vaccine actually first time i've felt good EU more.

No, first time seen EU work. idea country able keep schools open peaks weren’t? 

Finding reasons important voted tackled wasn’t poor governance. Yes please! It’s almost full year since we’ve done much, can’t believe time. March 10th day went home, I’d love celebrate anniversary prick arm. 8 of? look comments, collective amnesia / retrospective re-writing history already begun. Oh damn, bad? major German politicians still spout shit celebrated cult. Dr medicine, disregard fact one study enough prove disprove anything. thought Johnson &amp; Johnson's products meant Tears...  thought that. virus rn wish never left room. hell vaccines rushed

🙄 morons going stop repeating myth? Convenient, since huge chunk patents become public. Meaning, companies produce products, especially OTC drugs, they’ve monopoly over. 

Seems like PR ploy keep investors buy time decide they’re going follow continue course. Basically, decide profitable. Welcome UK COVID restrictions, sit takeaway shop waiting 20+ minutes food long two customers inside shop. cannot get haircut metres people barber full face shield mask underneath shield. Yeah, live claim medical exemption mask-wearing allowed ask proof medical condition due human rights laws (except airplanes). tell medical exemption wear one. Sometimes might insistent I'll forced wear one part, won't. USA good fixing things throwing money problems. glad guys going loose many people. hope guys help allies afterwards. us lockdown since November. never ended. Downvoted facts. 85% effective severe covid, possible 100% effective hospitalization unless none 15% went hospital have, since severe covid necessitates hospitalization. Probably confuse virus Massachusetts.  anyone else stopped caring getting covid? Like personally stopped caring? even sake grandma. feel like I'm point lot young people last summer shittting going fun. I'm person wants start going fun, vaccine vaccine. feel like mental health toll/depression I'm experiencing worse whatever virus would point.  KN95 mask Funnily enough Vietnam well this. That’s insane fall Remember Russia said COVID vaccine lmao Oh fine. Stop overthinking this. already work them. How's gathering dangerous? Well writers actually writing song driving Maryland. although landmarks marks primarily western Virginia (all still partially West Virginia too),the writers stated song West Virginia state. Like said, going wait published paper see statistical analysis. can't help that. really society wanted traffic fatalities drop would everything advance self driving cars ASAP ban people driving soon can.

Also would try make easier drive majority accidents happen 3 miles home. 

Drunk driving eliminated good public transit infrastructure. People ride bus kill others driving.  agree entirely wrote, country risk low due fact wear masks even gloves streets often low crowded clean, people respect even sometimes there's dumb asshole wants king gets ignored anyway. go vast majority are. way US producing vaccines, imports EU likely little rounding error. problem EU right combine 37 ""little rounding errors"" 21 countries adds quickly.  Sure, comment critical Pfizer Moderna vaccines despite fact vastly superior J&amp;J vaccine. Yes require shots provide far protection. interim analysis assessed 468 cases symptomatic COVID-19 among 44,325 adult volunteers Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, United deaths related COVID-19 reported vaccine group, 5 deaths placebo group related COVID-19.

And missing evidence death finding predictive. That's happen begin with. several posts it. 98% effective two weeks. Something like 99.5% effective preventing severe disease.

It's effective south African varent mostly effective others. think might due Pfizer jab approved first going older age group got priority. Canada December/January: Hmm yes declare. would make pleased borders stayed closed indefinitely dreadful Americans figure method get plague control mmm yes mmm indeed.

Canada now: Send ur vaccines plz :) :) :) uwu  outsider ignorance america's biggest problem. Almost nobody cared wear mask still complained got virus. April May 4 weeks each. 13 million doses 6.5 million 1st doses. That's 25 million per month, 50 million June 1st. hyperbolic bullshit. Faucci right. government time made masks precautions political. Millions people paid lives needlessly. Putting shifty straw men won’t change fact. really. 

The US fucked Canada also done pretty horribly compared countries size wealth. fewer deaths US mean 22,000 deaths country like Canada good. brother one them. life hardly changed. understand hard many people. anyone USA talking South African variant it’s dangers? Europe worried it. think fall the, ""just enough information dangerous,"" category.

Also people good school still total fucking idiots. could see school systems requiring masks fall. also could see small 4th wave next winter. Someones salty. shame people things endanger others. ignore it? Reddit loves Fauci reasons can't imagine Spain. Christmas screwed everything. people know got Covid latest wave got xmas. Idiots. funny threads US vaccines always see Canadians lurk jokingly begging vaccines too. wonder effectiveness breakdown age one. public data ? know give different doses vaccines like flu vaccine depending age. EU granted total 37 authorizations vaccine exports 21 countries Jan. 30 Feb. 10, spokeswoman said, without giving precise figures number shots exported factories EU, citing confidentiality reasons.

Interesting, thanks link. impression doses US manufactured Pfizer Moderna US.  Lol, yeah rest world hardly vaccines. It’s going take long time. possibility mutants. Hurry lockdowns work. hahahah. Ill spread diseases infect u fucks hahha. TRUMP 2025!!! giid going buch people stupid wear masks enjoy pastimes spitting fruit supermarkets. tf America high vaccine list? us live cities. want drive 60+ miles city (which usually coronavirus hotspot anyway, many people fled) get vaccinated. love EU. doesn’t mean can’t point it’s made error, clearly vaccine distribution

The dates final contract irrelevant. U.K. involved Oxford even AZ partner (indeed UK government blocked first proposed American partner, concern Trump would issue, recommended AZ. deal AZ way back Italy, France Holland actually deal June, put hold EU decided they’d charge (with agreement member states) took started over.

AZ sets production region sells to. UK sites got going early. takes time site get speed. yield production 100% first. UK sites three months longer, EU sites weren’t set due EU making firm commitment. 

The EU sites haven’t nearly long get speed, shortfall vaccine. get there, haven’t long perfect process get full yields. 

To pretend AZs fault, demand AZ provide vaccine another market producing longer, pretty shitty EU. slowed things down, expected take vaccine elsewhere suit needs. They’ve since absurdly talked AZ vaccine political reasons, people aren’t taking it. 

It’s pretty poor behaviour. Misleading information: deaths per million population way worse several European countries UK BELGIUM ITALY etc ... 

Also death count modalities different across wonderful world. Amazing poor leadership get true. EU continuing export Pfizer Moderna vaccines 21 countries, including US UK. Malaysia failed state? reminds idiot co-ed threw house party found Covid. House packed exposed it, PROUD!

There real psychos there. Can’t wait till vast majority population vaccinated finally kiss masks goodbye. Taiwan lockdown, they're fine. Macau lockdown, they're fine. 

Of note places close China, densely populated. good health system outstanding leadership, handled COVID effectively without lockdown. Heavy weapons guy approves message. dad running Idaho - appointments left county, counties either side. We've trying get spot since sign started already full time. literally one person make sound like 50 people ""ignorant"" get that, really almost never interact anyone besides husband also isolates. groceries delivered picked up. times we’ve around others like medical appointments wear N95 masks, eye protection, gloves, completely strip shower like we’re contaminated get home. groceries quarantined wiped using. take seriously want better vaccine. Yes sure, vaccine side effects aren’t real. still see happened. virus targets respiratory system, bowels.

It almost like hearing pandemic like ultimate laxative. Way completely miss said. filed police report. officer walked public space mask near him. followed today mask first till talked it.

Most police departments stand behind Trump hinge every word. he'd said ""wearing masks help us reopen"" STFU rest time, hundreds thousands people dead billions dollars lost.

So yeah, Trump telling everyone remove masks gave asshole power needed lead way. police *should* enforced god-damned law instead, continue suck off.

How people enforcing law allowed flagrantly ignore it?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   absolutely crazy think people wear masks deaths per day single digits 70% vaccinated. live fear flu either. Ironically, case rates plummeting, might take lot longer get readout e.g. J&amp;J. even hit 2m yet? We've done 17m vaccines, many Pfizer? Whenever see stats lot people assume.

If we'd hit 2m last month would cover 50% total vaccines. Canada's lockdown way stricter New Zealand. Nice bait. 

Or...or wait...wait minute....

Are you....serious??? whatever available 

Idk man, I’d get Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J. hear Chinese one pretty trash. Thank God friends (in 30s) complete fucking morons we’re getting vaccine listening bullshit J&amp;J still means hospital death, I’d willing get it, offered me.  comment removed allow safety medical advice sub.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Neither UK Belgium covid control. main idea wrong basis article. UK strain clearly while.

The CDC doubt drastically undercounting amount strain U.S. mind, crazy cases STILL DECREASING knowledge.

The Media CDC pretend strains/variants getting here. must think hella stupid take genius know already now. Death Row inmates already Covid get too... Seriously. Test positivity rates, reported death rates, hospitalization rates comparable. model inferred estimates transmission infection rate parameters.

Countries COVID control test much US rampant community transmission. countries test positivity rates (&lt;&lt;1%) basically indistinguishable antigen-test false positive rates. I'll also point OWS one program among many. Specifically, pre-orders many cities went funding research production. I'm sure downvoted. Polling suggests 60% reasonable guess many Americans currently want vaccine, US ordered enough vaccinate whole population eventually giving surplus countries. also made fat. 3 tubs popcorn 3 movies, 3 bags boxes candy, bunch cherry coke zero wash down. That's meant criticism. relatively fast US. anyone vaccinated, agonizingly slow. *phew going ""vaccine passports"" anything except possibly international travel. would violate medical privacy laws government mandate it, businesses incentive try check vaccination status --- would cost money check whether customers vaccinated would cost business. would also little public support. can’t stop variants even lockdown restrictions all? thing would one path. Infection. percentage us acquired Covid antibodies now. going get done. ever be, right?! Dude I'm prepared wear mask public rest days. really mind. ears mind, dont lol. going struggling covid variants years come. Yet ones crazy pills saying so?  want mrna ugh worst time healthy lol fucking love sacrificing shitheads things ""I wanna!"" scientists believe vaccines broad enough cover variants. There's caution intermixed optimism, course going say that. Don’t jinx it!  long vulnerable age groups get access first prevent needless deaths family grief, that's awesome. thing misses fact Spring, Summer, even parts Fall/Winter timelines already large swaths country. 


Hell, March Madness going 25% capacity starts 3 weeks. Schools around person since August. Bars restaurants bartops open again. Masks required wherever elderly people numbers. sure airplanes, polling stations, hospitals, dentists offices, course, retirement homes. I'm glad handling quarantine well able work home, need get back normal safely soon possible. way see it, take whatever vaccine give you. That's one shot closer us getting normal. necessary public health, wellbeing, economy. made cry. idea 500K people never seen moment needlessly died. It’s much think sometimes. bad. belief mainly Germans research, India ones producing it. Israel vaccinated percentage itd population done research accordingly. Oxford England. Might agree United States part, still doubtful Americans. Maybe country mediatised get access riots, walks, governors/states masks biased. I'm wrong, good. definitely, still hoping front liners get access, unless another debate anti vaxers least measure responsibility sanity part. Try make outside! :) ugh yes someone canada CDC estimates 1/4.6 case reported even better! Btw, right, think Fauci including margins. still say changed projections J&amp;J announced lower production, think deserves criticism. still reduces (eliminates? sure specific numbers) death hospitalizations significantly,

Pretty much eliminates.  attitude get hospitals case rates low.... couple weeks later shit storm again. *Sigh. never learn, we? 

Also, common cold pandemic level historic event. cause millions deaths life long health issues. Covid common could *not comparable*.

Public health reactions *pandemic* must strict reactions cold flu.

I swear like everyone insane. Jfc. others said, even J&amp;J vaccine practically eliminates risk getting severe illness go hospital. Also, 66% nothing shake stick at. That's efficacy good flu shot. thing mRNA shots they're using brand new technology one idea would effective are. discredit J&amp;J's vaccine which, especially considering one dose, DAMN good vaccine. whole picture. It’s marketed single dose vaccine get once. it’s adenovector based vaccine, first time get develop vector specific response well response COVID antigen. means try vaccinate again, response much much weaker immune system attack vector itself. Overall still good news noted JNJ one ~85% effective whereas two dose mRNA ones 95%. small ultimately meaningful gap. Keep mind infected still need vaccine. 

I point two reasons: 

1) Theres still sound science natural immunity ends. say years, say weeks. 

2) every person talked goes ""Well swear back March last year knew was, like cold, longer, no, lose smell taste covid specific symptoms bad cold!"" decides dont need vaccine ""They already it"" we're going prolong this. No. incorrect. Independant article written November, really idea. data linked post, shows vaccines act reduce spread significantly. FT writeup poor, others better 75 90 percent reduction doesn’t matter - big drop transmission,” Linial said. “It means individual vaccinated protected, inoculation also provides protection surroundings.”

The idea COVID long-hauler somewhat fuzzy. really know result organ damage, post-virus syndrome, something else. indications vaccines help things.   Ahh yes snot rifle   COVID=Measles, Mumps Rubella? Right. That’s true. worked JNJ many years. don’t fuck around, also slow. Glad they’re getting something market 2021. says summer people able gather friends, stop work form home, eat restaurants, travel domestically.

Well yeah, also like 50ish% country already living way....so that's summer people vaccinated...  dose 1 2, vaccine? It’s frustrating exciting read J&amp;J vaccine every single time find something “new” seems like it’s 28 months away. laced dangerous stuff like actual products are? comment I’m replying dumb shit, tell what... comparative, definitely far lax-er Western Europe even many US states.. read link? That's exactly does. Ok Music great hobby, bet improved loads too! hope family stay safe healthy possible *hug! 

My extended fam acted like life normal entire time knowledge none contracted covid. I'd want to. frustrating see, sure. 

Your situation sounds far riskier mine. know lot people good still careful possible. make through! suggest giving read: Capitalism Serious question - Fauci saying masking social distancing possibly 2022? makes zero sense summer. So, funding research vaccines, funding production vaccines (before even approved), testing vaccines, etc. among least responsible? United States probably done, far, country develop produce multiple vaccines saying among least responsible?

Interesting logic. somehow made make even less sense guy knows movie idea going somewhere criticized wearing/not wearing mask never return.


C'mon, that's even remotely true. Yes, according CDC, NY veterinarians staff still qualified per Cuomo. Hopefully soon come direct contact clients patients constantly. rich class consciousness. rest us same. worked. Melbourne too. decline occurred 2-3 weeks winter solstice.

Oh come *on!* sure wasn’t alignment Jupiter Titan? Revisiting post 76 days, bit 2 months. 

And Americans administered 64M doses. Canada done 1.5M 

Adjusting population, thats still 4x slower Canada States. 


Source  look Pfizer's graph clearly protection around day 11, take incubation period account protection start earlier that. But, Israel research data suggest opposite, big surge infections right vaccinations, researchers sure thought maybe people dropped precautions soon got first dose (despite told to)

“Surprisingly, daily incidence cases increased strongly vaccination till day eight – approximately doubling. don’t know initial surge infection risk may related people less cautious maintaining protective behaviours soon injection,” said uk south africa variants. Oh wait, cases declining Don’t worry understand weren’t belittling anyone!

Just sharing know help someone else navigating therapy/mental health.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* actually bothered reading article commenting, headline, know testing done analysing respiratory infections. can't confuse influenza virus Coronavirus. 

'Thousands swab samples processed analysed scientists Public Health England (PHE) weekly basis survey prevalence different respiratory diseases population.

But 685,243 samples reviewed PHE’s laboratories since first week January, single one tested positive influenza.' really optimistic? It’s still saying things like surge fall 2021 even mentioning words “2022” prediction seen pessimistic. That’s cute fanfic. I’d totally read. Lol. Give rest lunatic. disputing Australia &amp; NZ kept Covid out, dealt Covid already present reducing interpersonal contact reduce R0 number 1 disease gone. coherent explanation. None. Gregor Waschinski Handelsbaltt, here's thread still backing story. direct result reporting many Germans refusing AZ vaccine. Way go guys! mean, want say ""hey, maybe wear mask sick go out"" yeah, think people buy that.

Anything lunacy, though. new data UK looks promising, minor issues,

but could help restore trust seems higher impact side effects (well, wanted effects...) see clinics 50% people fever day vaccination, happen Biontech.

Now campaign let teachers get third group first priority group, give AZ. see works out. Seasonal flu R value 1 2. Covid 3 bit 6. comparison's sake, Measles 12 18. find way back.  One reasons America bad crisis corporate capture. business interests apparent short term alignment human welfare, issue. vaccines everything alignment solution money. Yeah, aiming belittle people experiencing things first time! one fairly brave person another, let's keep good work :) work like that, main family flu viruses (the ""A"") also infects birds pigs, act stock new variants us. That's year get new variants elderly fragile people need get new flu shots. get people tired stuck trapped, want things eased. honestly, thought losing smell taste months, worse, truly evil fate. Think much life eating, smelling things air go life. truly terrible thing lose that. me, that's worth risk. course. came that, I’d far rather disgustingly sick several weeks endure interminable months lockdown. that's fair enough.  Sometimes things it’s right thing do. everything quid pro quo.  let people drink driving? Ah shame people drunk driving. Cool story bro. Johnson Johnson getting sued baby powder screw ups? still want breathe  Tbf part Maryland West Virginia AF Well, they're infected, they're essentially vaccinated anyways. long at-risk vaccinated cares?  Ruin education/career uni Australians can't even travel freely states.

Lol. Despite five days cases. remember year ago Asians around wearing masks everyone else looking like crazy. Funny much difference year makes. people would look funny wearing mask. Shortness breath, fatigue, brain fog, rapid HR, high blood pressure... turns got long covid without ever getting short covid one get fastest. done. You... realize anxiety causes cortisol buildup inflammation too, right? It’s like anxiety fake illness. It’s like debating whether people sick not, real things. It’s question whether virus caused physical trauma, caused psychological trauma causing physical trauma

For record absolutely know long covid thing, know people it. think 30% seems really high, personal sample (I know two dozen people recovered fully within 3 months) historical perspective. 30% long term damage experiencing minor short term stmtoms would weird fuck. Usually virus fucks long term fucks short term well. always cases exceptions aren’t norm. Flu sitting isolation wearing double masks. afraid get sick COVID 🤪 I'm expecting wearing mask public transport high traffic enclosed spaces norm. 

it's minor inconvenience, stops spread flu like illnesses. not? another virus hits better lot people still wearing masks. slow little?

I also expect people asked drag office sick. people stupid. Hey, forgot get vaccine first! probably do, know do.

Also ""long covid"" symptoms start appearing *months* initial infection, ... give time.

And ""calling bullshit"" something happening tiny little personal bubble really healthy way think world. Hundreds things happened neighbours you, still things exist, even though experience personally! kidding you! Hopefully! Well, media tells still afraid 24/7. blame them. year I'm still stunned comparatively transmissible covid is. We're still struggling contain that, yet we've made flu fuck entirely. note... post 17, - 1 Infection risk increase exposure time. situation OP described low risk, ""we already spend time together"" good argument. Vietnam, Australia, NZ etc better COVID, that's debatable.

WHY better debatable, however. Lockdowns one hypothesis why, others, counterfactuals efficacy lockdowns.

We need honest we're going learn something this, definitely know answers yet. mRNA save lives COVID took. There’s thick silver lining awful situation. Oh, doesnt make sensens regards...which makes frustrating. psychological, societal thing. Panic buying. Still stories reporting deaths soldiers... We’re Americans, don’t care us unless we’re writing foreign aid checks ""we point anyone sign get vaccine April"" ""we enough vaccine vaccinate everyone end July"" mutually exclusive? useless vaccine them...no thanks poison *this* I'm tired of, personally. wear mask, go stadiums, whatever another several months - yeah fine, Syria I'm living through. sickly-sweet, corporate commercial ""bUt fUn! like it? love staying HOME"" crap just...blech Sorry! Removed. give rest world much foreign aid literally nothing us, don’t really care meme love NJ! I'll never understand hate state. right. definitely people cutting line. people think ""no one checking anyway"" others think ""it's fair smokers go first.""

Whether agree lists not, we're middle global health emergency. make peace line jumpers- realize end day, that's legacy crisis. So, continue thing work, maybe try something different? well may one day clean shite may even get FDA be. welcome. It’s great lower risk individuals people getting vaccinated odds getting super slim anyways.  Refugees. states guidelines? Nobody given fuck months. I'm skeptical ever get single digits unfortunately. comparisons sake, roughly 65% children 45% adults get vaccinated flu every year prior COVID, typically around 40,000 flu deaths per year US. Across span flu season thats roughly 300 per day, year round thats 100 deaths per day.

Now hopefully people vaccinated COVID typically get vaccinated flu, COVID also deadlier flu easier spread long incubation period, restricted flu season. Barring massive medical breakthroughs cure COVID provide permanent immunity, hard time looking 5 years road seeing US less 10k COVID deaths per year US re-opened 6 months ago.  callous jerk. American. 100%. idea vaccine downplayed upon release, it’s extremely effective. Yes. Mitigate risk fuck off. K-12 school districts thinking continuing hybrid, even all-virtual instruction even next year. Agreed, vaccinate spreaders first, age 20-40. Yup. Ooh, sorry! Replied wrong comment true. There’s absolutely reason beneficial mutation human’s perspective tied decrease transmissibility. could be, exact applies negative mutations. referring OP said they'd lockdown since March 19th. Seems quite long heard anything it. feasible US. isn’t. wish DeWine would add autoimmune diseases. Yup. I’ve actively going therapy treat ptsd anxiety/depression decade. I’ve many tools place help navigate triggers seasonal depression etc.

However many first experience trauma. therapy. incredibly overwhelming even know begin. Therapy subjective individual grounding rituals work me, might harm someone else.

For example. Vanilla scented candles greatly calm down, someone else scent might trigger bad memory abuser. 😂  Spanish flu never ended, people think will? go-go? need government officials tell cannot meet friends? use judgment? Interesting. I've never seen Canadian ""shit American capitalist behavior"". fact last checked Canada capitalist market economy. probably thinking Americans raise Canada model functioning Democratic market economy social safety net? Yea we’ll see. many times gonna rich people make promises us don’t follow with? Remember Elon Musk said going make ventilators ended buying bunch shitty CPAP machines? care America stop seen meme Roaring 20s post pandemic? universal desire doses shipping March already manufactured

Exactly. J&amp;J already making vaccine at-risk thanks Warp Speed. talk good things past here.   swallowed pride voted Clinton, choose jack. best blame people vote, think learned lesson four years later. bad took much death civil unrest poverty make people understand can't live apolitical world. I’ve already said twice, I’m already vaccinated. yeah, someone chose get vaccine Bill gates conspiracies, I’d avoid crazy fucker costs. Y’all issues.   I'm Canada last week, everything closed except groceries stay home order, leaving house unless essential reasons work. 
I would consider full lockdown. Well nice hear someone works there. hope booster shot helps improve results obviously wait see that. mean unlikely long term effects children? wouldn’t myself, young healthy person conditions. would someone advocate someone conditions risks isn’t able mainstream yet try protect person really eligible anyway . sure deal code though. actually really close that/ exceeding biden even took office numbers drop high-spreaders vaccinated. People rest homes, yes. people shelter home, no, actually need vaccinated immediately. unvaccinated elderly friends would benefit drop spread virus. recent research support assertion.

In fact, recent evidence vaccinating teachers would highly beneficial society. I've saying **long COVID fucking terrifying**, affects huge proportions people get virus.

Having virus fatigue symptoms 6 months called ME/CFS, check stats ME/CFS, 5% people fully recover it.

No one ever written news story someone recovered long COVID. due date middle April, would love somehow get doses give birth. Ancillary healthcare here, visiting different medical offices/hospitals day. interesting eligibility varies wildly state county. fear hate unvaccinated lead digital verification system. get right non-believers you? else safe know vaxxed otherwise right? Except shut everything stop transmission, stop hospitals getting overrun.

So, open back up, need keep down....the easiest way get everyone 65 vaccinated first. way I'm still wearing mask get vaccinated. masks annoying uncomfortable increasingly evident vaccines reduce transmission. Shut take money!!! CFR particularly good measure. relies entirely upon amount testing. Like vaccines, US excelled testing - including testing mild symptoms. test non-severe symptoms, lower CFR goes.  fuck buy n95 masks?? We're fucked species. over.  


We're done. vaccine it. Period. you’re willing resume life vaccine, you’re never going it. *always* going risk variant another. Forever. 

Some people might live like forever. Fine. don’t expect everyone else it. donald, forget he's reason 500k dead. Watch say that's doublethink post Covid America. Feel free tell rooted reality? efficacy lower, moderate severe data points. prevent spread? Long covid? data reported mild covid likely track it... we'll study one gets used wild. Either way I'll wait turn option feel protect me. obviously same. looked it’s 75% population fits categories  older 60, essential worker, risk. pretty much impossible come good plan trickle age. thing i've excited year getting two shots.

and shot mean vaccine. 

Liquor later. implemented multiple restrictions including 2 week quarantine Deagu following church outbreak addition wider school, restaurant, bar closures. defacto lockdown result citizens following public health advice behaving rationally. Streets absolutely barren early pandemic, masking adherence social distancing adherence extremely high. combined rapid action government establish testing, contact tracing, mandatory isolation infected lead superior personally would prefer J&amp;J vaccine standard vaccine instead mRNA unknown long term effect data. will. I’ll also sure comb comes prior section again. Thank you. I’m saying might want commit making statement changing mask wearing vaccinated people good chunk time passed. idea long, see experts holding back announcing changes sure. Pfizer already made calculation. suggesting violating ramifications. saying.

in normal situation vaccine would arrive single dose ampule. American people voted in. chose this. That's actually true though. vaccine traditional one Novavax What? I've seen headlines attributed Fauci say May, June, July, August like past four days. 

I can't expect anything. I'll wait actually hear state official say turn. young, 50 clinical sense. Agree.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yea but... cant distribute fast. People 16 eligible vaccination COVID. tell European friends likely going third Same. Save fancy 2 shots ones elderly front line workers. I'm happy get JnJ 5 sterile needles (actually 6 pfizer) protocol works now. article suggesting pooling leftover vaccine multiple vials get doses. introduces whole host concerns:

a)batch traceability. vial Pfizer vaccine unique identifier. adverse reactions must reported number. mixing vials made impossible

b) cold chain management. distinct unique steps taken ensure vaccine good safe. complicates greatly, vials allowed cooled. Generally, one prepares doses disposed vial. would worked out.

I understand many medicines pooled vaccine somewhat unique - never really accepted practice vaccines - fact western countries vaccines shipped single dose dealth with. think people grasped extreme unfairness slow vaccination roll-out. Many people unvaccinated absolutely desperate vaccine, people behave imperiously fortunate enough vaccinated. us unvaccinated class raise HOLY HELL prevent hypocritical vaccinated anti-maskers lording us. political divisions grow. funny issues SARS vaccines before......these vaccines rushed......the amount virus crazy (the viral load extremely high infected people lot infected people). advocating waiting 100% effective vaccine, advocating trying best really stop transmission, vaccine preventative measures think long.

In general vaccines past many possible epitopes, whether weakened virus, virus like particle (VLP) contain many viral proteins...this vaccine targeted handful mutations could allow virus evade immune response. Instead sarcasm lets keep conversation serious - life death people Deaths hospitalizations low early May would allow reopening Huh? Ya. USA heck job vaccinating, reading people get way optimistic, way even government officials.

If US get 100 million people partial protection (and guys sticking proper dose timing, means good chunk full protection well) end March that's quite feat.

The earlier get Johnson Johnson significant quantities, easier math becomes game changer, good news. earth old people supposed get appointments? ludicrous Wait would take 6-9 months. Israel coming reports daily half country vaccinated. Also, babies essentially zero risk this. Like literally lower risk flu 10 demo Weinstein Heying charlatans peddling ""China made lab"" conspiracy theory. They've booted academic circles good reason ignore absolutely propagate nonsense. young remember AIDS pandemic? really might headed toilet, ha!

Time. experts jumped opinions soon Covid-19 first appeared. think better idea transmissions vaccinated people six-nine months vaccinations.  
Masks annoying, social distancing annoying, get it.  
I continue wear mask 8-12/day foreseeable future keep new moms babies protected happy so. end day came way many people giving shit thinking fake going days normal

And people running country, Senators, police officers, mayors, governors, one President. I'm sick tired explaining this: CANNOT PERSONAL RESPONSILITY WAY NATIONAL CRISIS! want New Zealand, China, South Korea, Iceland has? Get functional fucking government. Ha, good man. would taken screenshots appointment making process, claimed *evidence gathering* case news actually hit. didn't, well, congrats welcome ranks vaccinated? Win win you. ordinary situation enough vials everyone, I’d agree you, think least someone make risk calculation; dangerous, pooling liquid, vaccinating 10% less people. mean, well known theory called hygiene hypothesis. necessarily subscribe it, like OP pulling idea thin air don’t think it’s hurtful honestly. doesn’t sound like want see OP. Friendships fade end time usually anyway. sounds like one way out. Many many people safely gathering comfort level pandemic. Masks outside, distanced outside, etc rational people vaccinated household is, resume normal activities. Regardless whether seeing others pandemic capacity. place stop date it, it’s worth it. OP choose either way; perspective. Question upset view? dropping fast! belive going happen people get vaccinated, masks end optional outdoors mandatory indoors, means could go walk around theme park ride rides maskless wear one going inside gift shops. Look top comments username haven’t. sure agree won’t back even longer! hope too. Hear, hear True. least NYT posted article today roasting people. called vaccine alarmism faulty recomendations every US politician beginning Pandemic. Source? Hadn’t seen bit research. ok lockdown next year new exotic variant insisted something even understand could 'the best?' 

Good lord - americans start worrying wasting tax dollars would great - tax dollars spent giving rich corporations money instead managing virus first place? J&amp;J vaccine clinical data variants still effective Lmao. parents Barmstedt- live US still plugged German politics fairly competently. They've less CDU one party awhile federally foreign minister Mr. Maas one anti free expression ""liberal"" pols. think of. idea long ago outlaw ""sexual"" advertisements. three week review statutory thing, infuriates antimaskers city combined. yeah, especially horrific winter surge, people ignored cdc guidelines traveled that’s fine really, people becoming minority soon extreme minority laugh them. Uh, that’s works. piece paper two stamps saying vaccinated. I’m already taken care without insane conspiracy shit.

Oh. Damn, bet crazy ass $100 told that. apparently fall dumb bullshit really easily. celebration track play everywhere world practically eliminated coronavirus. Americans end 2021: get better 2022! Americans end 2022: get better 2023!  think business conspiracy NYT, think political. stories UK since brexit relentlessly negative. 

Even topic, EU pressuring AZ making look like tits UK govt sat back watched, NYT headline story 'EU UK fight Vaccines'. Like, what?  new studies come saying transmission cut, don’t “experts” pivot. There’s great NYT article today. It’s completely bonkers. reasons prohibited manufacture. Mostly due nervousness tracking lot numbers also lack observing temperature control this.  Yes, did. company, guess winner sh\*t.

Small businesses might getting somewhat screwed US, imagine UK: barber shops - closed, shoe stores - closed, toy stores - closed, opticians - closed, everything closed ""essential"" (not food supermarket like Tesco). closed since 1st January closed until.. knows long, probably April.

Restaurants allowed operate ""take away"" mode, really profitable. Lockdowns questionable strategy, especially vaccines proven effective.

The UK strict lockdown months, one world’s highest death rates. Meanwhile, death rates US significantly lower, haven’t UK level lockdown.  key word ""patients"". among hospitalized finally President cares fucking election hurt ego. Yep  

Avg BMI: India 21.9, China 23.9, UK 27.3, US 28.5 mean maybe, there’s probably something - it’s also important take vitamins even non pandemic times. live, sun doesn’t pop much winter, take vitamins get sweet sweet vitamin D. 

Take vitamins! reputable publication? journalist, 2021 journalist, question figure whatsoever instantly wrote article it. 

Because that's definitely journalism supposed work. 

You ask politician complicated science, publish uneducated opinion fact. Also vast, vast majority young people catch Covid hospitalized. said would lock every year? That's I'm suggesting. end using vaccines highly effective, like Moderna Pfizer, likely help us achieve herd immunity. AstraZeneca [won't get us no. AstraZeneca reduces asymptomatic transmission 27%, symptomatic transmission 62%, stop spread. vaccine mostly helps severity symptoms dosn't really prevent infection. [Asymptomatics mildly infected people get long hauler likely referencing recent reports drop moderna/pfizers ability neutralize SA variant lab studies. still neutralized virus, significant drop overall response. likely still protect well variant really need real world data. studies leave lot factors like B cell cell memory long hauler know latenthirties/early forties. I’m sorry you’re situation! blows! It’s definitely feels like existential crisis. Like, go alone baby making? never dreamed single parent don’t know finding husband possible time. 

I desire pregnant 40s, even try. think doesn’t happen next 5 years I’m going adopt lot dogs. get sperm. single mom choice MANY responsibilities doesn’t sound remotely easy pleasant.

I really, really, really resent men waste women’s time like this. They’re cowards stringing women along years. say don’t want kids serious relationship. I’m done dealing guys say “maybe” “someday” comes wanting family. want family mean want pregnant tomorrow (which seems insane idea many men have) mean expect marriage partner honest cherish me. agree patriot act TSA crackdown infringements freedom! go watch sports game bar restaurant pizza pitcher beer. Something used take granted think, lately seems like want do. could probably right actually, I've pretty cautious entire time 

Also playing laser tag would fun not? needed save us daily mass casualty events would. reason - self sufficient, pretty much live paradise anyway compared rest world. know space station Elysium? That's Europe. Statistics show young people Covid indeed milder flu, often asymptomatic. Play D&amp;D person. online game going, want roll physical dice write real character sheet eat pizza pet DM’s dog. Sitting alone front computer headphones anywhere near fun. makes sense UK, Mexico also hit hard. ""The U.S. reported Covid-19 deaths anywhere else world.""

I’d imagine similar.

You probably could get one august July assuming you’re 16. man, don’t know legally works out. Sounds complicated. 

Rest assured. statistical chances getting severely sick low. It’s old people’s fat people’s disease we’re honest. Whats vaccine marketing? forced kind dont need market it. Israel pretty damn clear real world data, actually. countries free develop manufacture vaccines amazing socialist healthcare. Australia New Zealand pretty open point? 1. you’re 16, probably sometime early May July, depending rollout going state. you’re 16, might take couple months longer (they’re still finishing trials children preteens). 

2. vaccine broadly available, I’d expect could wander pharmacy get shot. Probably best bet would older sibling family member, etc. taking in. 

If fails...In state, vaccine distribution centers allowed require checking ID - it’s honor based. I’d imagine could say you’re 18 you’re asked. sample size enormous (entire population Scotland) effect size huge (85% 94%)

Except still appears prevent death SA variant. vaccine prevents death seems ok TBH I'm less worried goes US, even strict areas things improving: NYC opening theaters, parents protesting LAUSD's school closures, despite skeptics' insistence governors become dictators whatever.

What concerning way Europe seems headed. England Scotland recently issued reopening guidelines, skeptics criticizing draconian... know what, agree. diseases identically contagious spread exact manner.  It’s also incredibly difficult without specific tracing pinpoint source. You’re much likely catch person surface notice besides press release published actual data release reports journals public viewing. suspicious me. Moderna run frenchman. Pfizer run greek.

As scientist behind vaccines, mostly Europeans. Wow. plan really coming together it? can't believe thought bad idea.  necessarily since flu less transmissible Outside + mask you’ll fine.

Why mentioning Switzerland approve vaccine, FDA that's probably approving either. Maybe - MAYBE - AZ fucked up? no, ""fucking europeans"", EXPORT BAN - liar. fact, lying. spamming stuff days.

Yeah man, you’re right! I’m sure would extremely rare covid contracted hour 5v5 basketball breathing touching other. Thanks insight Couple factors probably make difficult:

1. Pigs livestock live close proximity highly dense populations. probably makes spread almost inevitable.
2. livestock flu vaccine, would work better human vaccines (remember years flu vaccines 30-40% effective)
3. Even able eliminate flu pigs livestock, still strains present wild animals (bats, birds) . Eventually, cross species may reenter swine population. 

That's problem viruses: highly adaptable prone constant mutations. especially true influenza virus. Sure, assuming stays high.

A lot Pfizer production instance done manpower 3rd party labs around country. That's expected get done fast, infrastructure house, point partnerships eventually lapse.


The worrying part countries even resources needed begin vaccination without massive foreign aid professionals vaccination process. That's say nothing political instability tends happen 3rd world nations. companies going keep making round clock vaccine COVID supply getting used.

Not say getting vaccinated important, reality goings Central Africa much immediate impact USA, certainly enough one justify large domestic restrictions.

We're going done sooner world is, asking people still distance nations vaccinated going bring valid rather unfortunately nationalistic question: we're worried 100% cose boarders minus trade goods extremely race circumstances followed mandatory quarantine? makes sense right? Obviously want that, bad look (getting vaccinated removing rest world), politically unrealistic think people going accept ongoing restrictions home country fully control.

I’m understanding it’s important seeking vaccination get too. sole purpose vaccine protect yourself. isn’t enough data definitively state prevents transmission (I’m sure lowers still accurate), force people don’t want it?

I'm suggesting kind conspiracy, I'd rather go known known point, especially relatively healthy young person. Alabama Hot Pocket goes show incredibly effective masks stopping flu. Think lives could save every year everyone wore masks public cold flu season. way. typical financial situation means money flu shot medicaid eligible regardless location family. Trump-following Governor Hee-Haw Missouri (least educated gov entire country--no college degree) made us one worst vaccination states, worst. Last heard taking urban areas' supply give higher share rural areas lot wasted. effective hospitalization death

That fuckin amazing. [Duterte rules face-to-face Philippines school almost year now) R0 intrinsic value, depends environment virus spreading fluctuate accordingly. effective R number (Rt) COVID high ~ 5.3 New York last year, example. (site .csv file still available) Think around mid march so. J&amp;J applied slightly later EU. common cold, yeah maybe flu. curiosity, contributed (as now) slow rise cases Germany? US, seeing sharp declines cases nearly country, country. Probably clean tub week rather disinfect every single time person steps bathtub. South Dakota herd immunity cause single highest infection death rate month two. That's difference. things also matter right key bit getting hispitlisations down. vaccines win win even less effective preventing minor symptoms I'm surprised many people affected lockdown. last year I've avoided restaurants, movie theaters, bars sporting events we're pandemic, restrictions.

After year, would hoped federal government would come way target compensations people financially affected covid. I'll happily cash stimulus checks, really going people lost job small business owners crippled pandemic. argument would go absolutely nowhere court 

So think delivering less 40% doses period six months could described ""best effort"" court? mean, seriously? 500,000 them. I've worn mask nonstop (since even CDC recommendation) claim minor inconvenience bit extreme. Beyond moderate discomfort (I live that), communication made far difficult masks (between muffled voices, lack lip reading, significant reduction facial expressions). communication piece really bothers can't live with. 

I definitely think try figure reduce burden flu (hopefully coming years mRNA vaccines used provide real-time protection flu example ""working sick"" reduced phenomenon) - wearing masks full time (or even flu season) step far (myself included). yeah that's cause every type illness cold announced covid case stupid everywhere. Great.. wasted effort..... believed priority strictly reduce deaths reduce spread I’d less inclined individualistic it. personally don’t think it’s purely reasons. purely reduce death, you’d go age. reducing spread, states would prioritize professions exempt Hawaii international testing requirements well, almost not. personally believe political pressure influenced priority list, therefore I’d rather vaccine go old person even eligible. 

I realize you’ll disagree, it’s personally believe looking. traveling CA see family end April. It’ll first flight since February 2020. 
I fully vaccinated. 
I live house 5 people, 4/5 fully vaccinated. 

Will need quarantine return? know it’s kind roommates comfortable with, guys think it? CDC guidelines bit confusing regards travel. article calculated current rate administration soon virus supposed end supply may naught think they’ll (Pfizer, moderna, j&amp;j anyway) prove effective preventing severe disease, hospitalization, death, good fully preventing symptomatic illness “regular” types. J&amp;j trial info know vaccines overall efficacy 15% lower South Africa vs US. 

For Pfizer moderna, don’t concrete numbers, I’ve seen estimates ranging 15-50% less effective. I’m sure we’ll know definitively, personally would expect (15%) difference vs SA variant. think saw Scott Gottlieb guessing 20%. So, decent chance somewhere range. important part still work well getting severely ill dying.

There may may boosters made available. are, would bet come late summer/fall, knows really. Personally, I’m sort expecting point next year. know they’re working them, think it’s partially prepared SA variant, also process ironed case concerning ones could arise sometime future. Ding ding ding ding ding still wont get flu vaccine probably still wont get flu seeing eat right, exercise, drink plenty water, get plenty sleep. 

This article utter bull shit. 

The flu linked 3,000 49,000 deaths 200,000 hospitalizations year United States. 

There estimated 50,100 excess winter deaths England Wales 2017/18. 


SOoooooo England eradicated flu **hardly** following social distancing guidelines covid ravaged whole country????

Explain makes sense. Seems flu overshadowed Covid. #'s simply add up. Grocery workers contact public already eligible, sure ones. list essential worker jobs became eligible.  make feel better thank Belgium master governments. Belgium went year half without government. sure really sucks. needs vaccine. Full stop. government completely fucked up. Even ease restrictions mid-March, hardly general population vaccinated, rates climb again. We’ll keep going cycles lock-down / easing people vaccinated enough people it.  would commitments supersede this?  actually bothered reading article commenting, headline, know testing done analysing respiratory infections lab. can't confuse influenza virus Coronavirus. 

'Thousands swab samples processed analysed scientists Public Health England (PHE) weekly basis survey prevalence different respiratory diseases population.

But 685,243 (1% population) samples reviewed PHE’s laboratories since first week January, single one tested positive influenza.' ""little"" ... nothing take looking for. people could behave way, would less animosity surrounding covid. added sources lol requiring ID voting hot political topic. would assume arguments would carry life death discussions, hey, downvote true. Fuck yeah dude.

Why I, 29 year old, get average 57 year old? I'd honestly feel like jerk walking get young healthy person remain prioritized groups. We're absolutely fine UK. fact proving even effective Pfizer. lmfao people naive heck attitude. Right profits people, everyone thinks unchangeable truth. landlords start hurting, oh poor landlords, banks fail, oh poor banks. things really way?
Majority renters don’t purposefully rent want less responsibility ease moving, rent can’t offer buy, can’t afford buy partially people sitting property don’t live turn profit it, partially spend money rent COVID fire though, virus, vaccines. Weird metaphor. That's shouty. Ease caps, there. Maybe, hear out, maybe time 9-5 workers FDA. 70% number doubt; average two study arms iffy statistics. There's concrete evidence ""escaping"" viral vector immunity. worked adenovectors 5 years. tons seroprevalence studies. pre-existing immunity Ad's (Ad5) parts world. Even ""low"" seroprevalent adenoviruses Ad26, Ad28, Ad35, number 30% range. 

I think we're topic. point multiple vaccines great. mRNA vaccines clearly superior, turn JNJ AZ ones given opportunity. initial testing freezing rate cold storage chain done 10 doses. submitted new data supports 15 doses per vial. idea behind pfizer moving allow wider range freezer temperatures. Astrazeneca really turned worst everything. Lol yeah people like advocating end lockdown problem. You’re literally trying force people get drug companies protected liabilities adverse effects. want, want butt hurt following line you, go right ahead champ. flu cases rolled Covid stats ... state isn’t even close done 1A, generally don’t see everyone fully vaccinated May. Monday already March, states far behind vaccination schedules. ridiculous statement Yeah I’m sure putting responsibility starving people middle pandemic oppose bill gives almost nothing tacitly supporting corporate bailouts. 

Especially considering congress doesn’t give shit oppose anyways. Beyond reasonable doubt required criminal cases. Civil cases never requirement scrutiny. common sense even high schoolers. don't. ""bored home"", millions people suffering depression, anxiety, loneliness, etc. socialization nice little thing, key aspect lives huge factor mental health. mention amount jobs lost entire industries peril. 80% COVID deaths people 65 older. Vaccinate people health conditions lead severe increases death COVID, let everyone else actually live lives. Measles another disease seems made jump animals humans. Oddly, we've wiped original zoological disease (Rinderpest) humans still Measles reasons. 99.999 reinfection rate based entirely sample size, insanely small sample size. vast majority reinfections likely go undocumented, partly likely mild asymptomatic 

I think end day complicated several factors (antibody levels infection vary 200 fold , cell responses etc). know yet long immunity lasts covid vaccines X percent people. 

So might right. I'm basing antibody levels. higher vaccinated people. . sera recoveries seems fair less well e484k variants vaccinated individuals vitro. might full picture

My point well protected long covid even get mild infection still helping lot without  Joe Biden plans uphold U.S. policy guaranteeing Americans inoculated first country shares shots, despite requests co-operation Pfizer plant Michigan supposed help supply vaccines Canada. exclusivity deal U.S. government guarantees American-made doses stay country Washington’s orders filled.

What today 4? Semi related: uncle took shot whiskey every night bed. lived 97. we’re 30% need 60% herd immunity coronaviruses, LOT deaths get there. seems extremely premature fully open we’ve vaccinated recovered covid. don’t care people saying me, it’s absurd rush hang little longer open safely. people know anyone died got sick? high risk people lives? really don’t get it. Lack empathy sure. Yeah paid enough roomy luxury apartment decent neighbors wouldn’t mind. stands price range crapshoot budget minded neighbors trash earth, modest sized space. Everyone keeps raising question none ""J&amp;J good!"" folks answer. Yes, preventing hospitalization death obviously good thing. I'm worried what's statistically much likely happen get COVID - mild moderate illness followed potentially months (or more) lingering symptoms like loss smell taste, fatigue, etc. therefore I'd personally strongly prefer get vaccine that's effective J&amp;J vaccine preventing infection first place, i.e. mRNA vaccines Pfizer Moderna. fair amount considering Israel size New Jersey. 50 states would 10k per day. Good thing federal system zero say matter. 

The economic demands great allow businesses stay closed avoid cases. Great news! certain categories people. routinely given people 50 health conditions pregnant. 

Still better though US... No, lockdowns DON’T suit me. That’s ZERO patience people like couldn’t tell scientific study asshole. pandemic prolong even one minute longer needs fuck deserve whatever shunning get. 

All posts say “ME ME.” Grow up.  decide.for.some.this nothing.. vaccine choice. get loser. fading smell something lesser extent. go completely away me, luckily. Yes one would love live permanent nanny state. share blame. Government power people give them. Lockdown able last long people support it. share blame here. Stop exonerating people haven’t woken seen massive mistakes made last 12 months.  It’s sick. people know fully vaccinated weeks, 20’s 30’s btw, terrified even leaving house think still carriers. hell point vaccination then? gonna see goalposts shifted end time? entire point vaccination campaign reduce deaths hospitalizations get back normal. i’m honest, already resulted suspiciously tall order “we go back normal everyone wants vaccine get one.” I’m grandma killer don’t wear two masks, resume normalcy second dosage. people need clinical help. lift button case - know wasn’t hanging air lift, exactly? Hence outbreaks, yes. Doesn’t change said. probably start referring BioNTech, soon Pfizer manufacturing it. seen articles say eradicate it, I've seen several say take many years regain former strength/prevalence. that's nice. Oh well, people's fault conservative government bungled response, again, surely happy going better them? hear AZ vaccine refused many Europe due perception inferior? Perhaps better stay Britain they'll get used... differing views, wouldn’t really want hang truth told. Especially expect wear seatbelt make drive. choices make. Biden said 300m available end July. Yet certain wouldn’t case lol. It’s okay we’re wrong sometimes, thought interesting. Cheers! Exactly this! think missing asterisk FREE ""No cost insurance plans"". insurance. probably this. think perhaps week going problems getting vaccine actually administered open everyone. week-old news One upsides isolated atm, sorry hear stupid people travelling though! never closed borders ALOT people travelling UK places (especially Dubai) .. stupid! Anyway, really want visit Alaska one day! easily measured damages caused

Sounds like blaming lockdown me. again, stop blaming peoole start blaming government. think lot doomsday-fantasy type people feel validated COVID-19 pandemic. goes away, people stop listening them.

Obviously knock voices urged caution pandemic. I'm one them. I'm referring people fantasize extras disaster movie. Almost exactly year ago, like 10 coworkers got sick one another. remember pissed spread around like big deal. covid happened are.

 hope normalizes sick leave everyone, least, wearing mask sick work. Yeah, wanted hang out, couldn't. hurts feelings. would hurt feelings drove without seatbelt too. educated actually that’s see reason get since poses risk me. great, avoid me. You’re favor. You’ve done nothing assault attack I’ve literally done nothing you. Lockdowns suit people like you, know, assholes one wants gatherings anyway. 'lets give ideas eh lack smell/taste, symptoms really thought sinus infection, get regularly, lasted 12-24 hours.

I honestly realize probably get tested first person small group got positive COVID test (one person infected 5 us) joked pointless drink high end bourbon taste it. bourbon hand, celebrating b-day myself, realized smell it. thought days realized able smell anything days. Belgium Pfizer’s global supply workhorse. doubt supply US anymore it’s used supply basically Pfizer’s global orders. say wasn’t? lockdown can’t fault, it’s abstract concept. government shut people delayed relief political gain, obviously it’s fault. people home supporting demonizing would speak real problem here. Hmm thought would reopening now. avoid people like like literal plague. vaccinated? Ok. family bbqs, kids events, game nights, holidays home, etc invites you. time idiots can’t trusted bare minimum.

And vaccines protect everybody. impotent child raging mommy making get shot. Grow educate yourself. borderline criminal, EU sue them, country member pile lawsuits. 8 weeks notice delivery, disgusting.

An unreliable company, trusted - trials delivery, everything involved shadiness. meantime almost noone wants AZ doses realy problem guess /s Lol people still died year... excess deaths WAY up.

Also, life expectancy Americans \_dropped\_ full year: first time modern history life expectancy declined. still might right. We're **hell** long way average person able readily get vaccine. checked eligibility status couple days ago estimated late fall I'm even eligible first dose. TON people behind line too. ass measles. Result things opening people almost forgetting Covid still around. People want vacation party. schools offices opening that's huge contributor :( sad question much longer stay lockdown? may affect well people poor suffered immense distress time. I'm glad things opening annoying see people use opportunity pretend like nothing happening. think stuck around numbers get closer herd immunity.  cost vaccine? Maybe, maybe EU commission fucked wrote contract AZ several months later others signing anything. conspiracy, shitty governance. like asking glass wine ham sandwich night impact vaccination.

Like, mechanism could play?

It's fine.

I seen thoughtful answers ""it's fine"".

Actually, someone asking could immediately get laid getting shot. Like, cares? Wait 15 minutes vaccination place good. still here... next deadly virus transmitted like aerosol, we're screwed. Ще не вмерла Україна!! course getting downvoted pragmatic opinion. dooming acting pandemic done. sure sub wants hear.

For record, completely agree you. Cases may declining, all-time high. There's nothing wrong ""wait see"" approach. I'm hopeful, naïve.

The Serum Institute started pre-producing vaccine clinical trials even finished last year. took huge risk vaccine would eventually approved use. April 2020 Serum Institute made plans this. already making doses EU even signed contract. EU fully even sign contract August 2020. Also unlike India producer Europe started making vaccine far advance approval. Sad true 😞 EU still exporting US? know first Pfizer/BioNTech shipments EU since assumed domestic production. Somethings touch on. 


The UK's contract AZ ""Best reasonable case"" ""produce ordered vaccines first UK plants giving others"". 


So AZ contractually obliged complete order UK, reasonable AZ divert supply EU. Therefore AZ going EU contract best reasonable efforts include breaching pre-existing contract. 


In regards delays. type delays literally every AZ order faced. contractually obligated report issue EU. course work resolve it, still say. 


It EU acted shot back heard early report. 


This EU walked back response. like reality. GET MEDICAL ADVICE REDDIT.

Seriously. need speak doctor. top voted comment every single one daily threads something questionable. You’ve got 40 mods sub, none spare time keep eye daily thread consistently full skepticism? 

And contact mods warn damage daily threads doing, basically got response told get it. 

You guys taking proactive action daily threads, relying reports. sub promoted Reddit place go COVID info, frankly, means higher responsibility tamp **** down. isn’t topic discussion amongst mods, needs be. hope one thing comes everyone stays home they're sick. Even normal colds, go work make everyone else feel like shit days? don’t get you’re downvoted. right. doesn’t mean things won’t go back normal, will, yearly vaccinations *at least* three years inevitability.  It’s hard admit reality NPIs simply haven’t worked large scale. Every state scattered hodgepodge measures less restrictive states also lower voluntary compliance general, yet numbers pretty much completely random scatterplot. Even factoring population density there’s convincingly large correlation. I’m fine it. would seem imply actual COVID cases could even way higher thought (the 4-5x diagnosed number) since nose tests depends enough virus nose. landlord college older retired woman whose income beyond Social Security rent townhouse one next door. Arguably two roommates, parents fall back got trouble, economically secure landlord. 

Was blood-sucker? Assuming still kicking around 10 years later well may dire straits right tenant can't kick way replacing income. I'm sure keeps needing said:

""Not likely"" mean ""impossible"" science. conclusively ruled out, interested parties must act contingency.

Who wants get sued wipe door handle good enough bank can't trust customers touch face keep noses in? people go bonkers headline, read article. fear mongering. identifying hole system apparently currently consistent mechanism report cases people get infected already received vaccine.

This based Even mRNA vaccines’ famed “95 percent efficacy” really measure well vaccines prevented symptomatic cases. Flint didn’t expect one people slipped cracks. importantly, though, expected somebody care. “I thought there’d mechanism,” said. nobody asked vaccine status got tested. nowhere file information doctor. part confused Flint. “Shouldn’t somebody want know?” Yep, should. do. Efforts already underway gather information help scientists understand effective COVID-19 vaccines real world. “How well vaccines work?” “Should counting every vaccinated individual gets disease?” two different questions. recall justification drive might end taking scarce hospital bed. needing ambulance, knew going occupied 24/7 driving around scooping COVID victims. thing is, hindsight 20/20. say lockdowns make sense, without partial restrictions...we may hit 500k cases day. hard say, would certainly higher cases.

And case count flawed testing bad early...so 235k cases...we may actually 350k new cases day. (Which part reasons cases going now. math. runs hosts infect.)

It depends this. lot people work office jobs kept working home made job stimulus. end spectrum people work person jobs laid off. $600 additional benefits helped, ran out.

This definately 1 size fits pandemic. populations groups people got hit way harder others education level.

&amp;#x200B;

Why record, I'm favor continuing travel orders, business shutdowns, etc. upcoming weeks/months vaccine distribution climbs cases/hospitalizations trend down. think wearing mask pretty minor inconvenience board continued capacity restrictions months longer even vaccinated - still listen science.

I understand mental health consequences understand feeling year lost. season changes luckily way opportunities gradually restore normalcy. Hope horizon, let's lose sight finish line forgo human empathy everyone life significantly impacted. Sir Tom Arnold died 100, media people acknowledging sad low key expected given age. right tone take. 

I thinking maybe would bit different, since remember major media outlets calling ""tragic"" 95-year-old Nelson Mandela died. religion? nothing religion. Perhaps didn’t know this, religion Hasidic Jews is...Hasidic Judaism. know, problem modern medicine vaccines? one?

Like said, there’s minority don’t get vaccinated, minority slightly larger groups bc limited secular education.  Wearing masks vaccine might ok, everyone get vaccines due pre-existing conditions etc. think small price pay, definitely restaurants etc allowed reopen original capacity over, economy run normally again.

No, think so. idea going this

Completely false. warning signs global pandemic around us. knew next pandemic well could infect entire world. That's exactly race M-RNA vaccine.

The Trump administration [fired pandemic can't preventative measures anything important costs money...up front.

Not going that? That's *trend* guarantee anything.

And GTFO ""YOU ONE ELSE STOP ME"". nothing fucking ""letting go"". understanding risk clearly not.

J&amp;J 66% effective vs Moderna/Pfizer's 94-95%. 

Yes everyone else would safer got J&amp;J vaccine. be. 

They know yet take both, probably years. booster even developed yet. 

So willing less protected everyone else safe, virus causes severe life long disabilities. That's comes to. 

If willing risk long term health everyone else safe, better person me. Lol. Id prefer protected. Crazy limited capacity restaurants theaters seen safe somehow limited capacity schools ... Copied article:

A coronavirus variant emerged mid-2020 surged become dominant strain California spreads readily predecessors, also evades antibodies generated COVID-19 vaccines prior infection it’s associated severe illness death, researchers said. TL;DR:

Mainly comes differences English Belgian contract law. UK contract contains specific wording (e.g. supply chains plants), enforceable (UK court uses much literal interpretation reaches decisions far faster Belgian court), specifies oversight (in AZ notify UK/EU early delays, UK/EU AZ come through). Source cmon Less infections (we testing last April), plus better care + capacity (probably cut expected deaths half).

Not mystery! Lol, ok That's exactly told lol he's currently looking transferring credits different school.  Define ""a long while"". seems keeps getting longer longer months go by. still wearing masks 2023? 2024? Even 2025 seem like 100% table yet. There's proof *doesn't* last 5,000 years.

It's soon say ""life long"", possibility. 100 million total end June. current process distribute covid vaccine unbelievably inefficient. People expected periodically check online find available appointments? Since appointments fill quickly, chances finding one slim. compete people get appointment scheduled. black Friday best buy soon doors open people stampede scoop high ticket electronics. soon health department posts openings websites, lucky sign they're gone. want use appointments distribute vaccine, damn waiting list? people access computer know use one? Right, since class race often linked US, getting vaccine poor communities color risk makes sense instead wasting rich communities happen mostly white. impression recommend flu shots every year new strains virus, immune response fades... provide link actual study? can't seem find anywhere. yes completely incorrect. See comment.

There’s like saying Americans tend antivax.  country (USA). world like 6mn/day. flu vaccine always free England?  Indeed. virus raging, boards lot people calling gov step lockdown.

There best way handle this. basically sacrifice deaths economic good.

Now, think comparisons amount deaths caused flu interesting discussions. Like crippling population flu? think is, think case made directions. see first part could make MERS irrelevant here, assume many many cases disease somehow make disease evolve less virulent/deadly. IFR different ages support objection MERS example endemic coronavirus become less virulent/deadly time?

Regardless, claim diseases general always evolve become less deadly obviously wrong. assumed saying evidence coronaviruses specifically. correct? exactly point? Well wave smaller almost everywhere else. Brah don’t even feel *needle* it’s like they’re drawing blood something. feel pinch, cool sensation, wait it? Clearly can't predict shit country, fauci ""under promise, deliver"" strategy

It'll months. promise  Murphy done lot well pandemic Jersey, fact smokers getting vaccinated people go work every day since start pandemic joke. ridiculous. helps American people

Because American people footing bill.... Showing know fuckall stuff yet still sprout mouth off. It’s nightmare seemingly end.  may: Americans tend favor convenience, think that's issue here.

Compare ""give good wipe one walk away."" flu cold virus survive without host? Could eradicate flu cold virus? Children’s lives value anyone else’s, think need try put end pandemic phase COVID-19 west actually opportunity without locking like full year  suspect it’s due pre-symptoms contagious window Covid. Even places didn’t close reduction cases due near halting international travel.


Even like places actively open millions people running around carelessly. People still wear masks people limiting time outside home interactions others. 4 weeks sense smell recovered maybe 10%-20% used be. still hope?  know low risk still there. Last year person sitting table covid luckily catch others table did. Even precautions. way much loose Fair enough, thanks. fully vaccinated, still necessary get PCR tests? huge irony 235k cases lockdown restrictions.

But, Spring way lower numbers...partial lockdowns.

All lockdowns keep people getting weeks, ended, people went back world got it.

This virus politicized much. side opening businesses. locking keeping people safe. ideal world, they'd work together come somewhere middle instead 2 drastic ends. Pfizer upgraded Brussels plant weeks ago almost double capacity. That's part behind EU shipments. Well, no, since hospitals overflowed. isn’t. said may less receptive less. That’s evading. Calm down. Ya tho definitely still aren’t dropping fast places. sure we’d enough natural immunity avoid big fall wave wrong knows. goes people able pay rent strategic chicken farms

[Ha, people know chickens kept -- locations undisclosed matter national day, hundreds thousands eggs trucked facilities, protected guards multimillion-dollar, government-funded security systems. mean every little helps. Flu kills hundreds thousands every year (tens thousands north america). personally would mind wearing mask heavy flu season even saves 1 life indirectly. They’ll filing bankruptcy spring lol Good thing got flu shot.  Wonder sanitation increase world done going affect virus bacteria immunities. remember hospitals US year ago saying bleach longer 99% effective viruses bacteria due constant use. may seem like much, evolve *a lot* faster do.  true this?

However, enforcement hard- odds pass cop driving night? 25%? 50%? everyone decided start driving drunk, we'd still tons deaths destruction, even people later arrested. Social pressure- drunk drivers anti-mask folks shamed acting better- crucial. can't functioning society unless least people care others, matter many laws get place. That's COVAX initiative important.

I think also saw Sanofi going start producing Pfizer maybe even J&amp;J increase EU availability well. nearly impossible find too. back start bought 3 sets seen back stock since. i've ripped first pair already. big issue gloves grip. drop everything using them.

The. Fucking. Article. That's old kindergarten teachers described me. Yeah, missed last 100 years scientific advancements vaccines primary driver viral infection reduction. 

Also, missed mounting body evidence vaccines inhibit transmission. Like everyone expected to. 

Or maybe understand basic concept less infection better infection, quite good infections

Maybe clear ELI5 terms:

0&lt;5&lt;100 first factor critical confirmed 10% initial cases first wave roughly 30%. 

How much think virtually non-existent 2021 flu season contributes secondary infections key part Covid mortality? So, really dumb questions: 

1. still flu shots next season?
2. ever ""repeat"" strain quadrivalent vaccines? mean, I've gotten flu shot last 8 years, given strain twice point? plenty countries report accurate COVID numbers. fact think otherwise speaks volumes ignorance. lot countries handling pandemic much better America; even areas contact tracing, shutdowns, testing per capita, sequencing, etc etc.

You ignorant. seems problem people communities aren’t signing up. open everyone didn’t sign up. code didn’t sign enough either. Times reporter article able sign learned story means slots gave access weren’t filling.

McConnell let stimulus get passed September/October, feel like lot governors would’ve followed Newsom’s lead thought since people got stimulus money, it’s okay close Winter. Lmao mean... drop 399,925 known cases.... keeping mind large % country doesnt give shit masks restrictions... certainly leaves room speculation. Look COVID starting, blamed Obama H1N1 Ebola US.

For reference, CDC estimates 12,469 people died H1N1 US. Wearing mask helped sinus head cold prevention. think may every winter Wow much compassion immune systems.

This karmic payback, getting started. can't use cases compare across different time points running vastly different numbers tests. seeing rises falls cases real time best metric predict near future hospitalizations deaths going look like. Back fall lot people dismissed rising case numbers ""casedemic"" hospitalizations deaths up. Then, weeks later, deaths followed. see people (decreasingly, deaths dropping now) saying things really better deaths still high, despite plummeting case numbers. obvious deaths going decline, massive decrease cases. always get cold time year year sick once!!! Amazing! I'm actually cool wearing mask forever, dont talk people grocery store, nobody breathing me... yes! Eh, people still got flu shot. enough get immunity going.  really think flu 100% eradicated? lol read half dose effect yet still using full doses. Makes sense. half dose exact effect given everyone half dose doubled availability doses. makes sense, I’m curious: didn’t start higher dose count begin with? mean, 10 psychologically satisfying round number, I’m sure must either production line reason scientific/medical reason ...that know thus far. Wouldn’t surprised even earlier. according mechanic.  He’s authority things. Bullshit, cherrypicked one finding confirmed bias running it. significant issues, least study peer reviewed/lack breakdown many Pfizer vaccines used/the predominance lackthereof SA variant Scotland/etc. 

You're ignoring *everything* else suggests AZ qualitative issues vis vis mRNA vaccines conform bizarre bias. 

Not least finding Israeli government shows ridiculously effective Pfizer jabs are. 

 again, nation bizarre variant emerged ditching Az vaccine donating doses African Union. guess next thing say SA incompetent, right? 

The Az vaccine good vaccine, already vaccinated offer would course take it. ignore smoke pretend good mRNA vaccines (in case saying SUPERIOR) seems like bridge far. puts us right track saying: ~220m doses end March. Great hear still think meet numbers 5 weeks go.

This means first week April see easily 100m people first dose. April see vaccine open everyone May, anyone wants vaccine able get already got it. Airborne. Meaning literally someone could've walked area 2 hours ago they're kilometers away breath still lingers air. 

An airborne-related pandemic would absolute doomsday scenario. aerosolize ability aerosols infect depends concentrated (hence large, open spaces ventilation risk mitigator). could lead proposed change work: companies face massive productivity losses due constant annual flu infections, maybe considering allowing employees work home Winters could solution that's embraced. mess unemployment system made wrongfully denied, get help.

That's old article, there's lot actual real world evidence coming UK showing AZ vaccine highly effective preventing hospitalizations covid also people transmitting it. fit narrative Pfizer good, AZ bad.  far factors lockdown. One frequently overlooked population density. UK whole 715 people per square mile - Virginia 212.

I can't remember really seeing fear monging (maybe newspaper headlines linked?), browse sometimes.

I recommend avoid meeting people especially seek new people meet new opportunities get copy corona - fear monging yet?  yet, according massive clinical results, is. Canada also ""let"" 22,000 people die, equivalent 220,000 US. 

But keep patting back March lockdowns pretty close werent full. that, governments gave implemented ""lockdowns"" instead many exceptions werent lockdowns.

Worst worlds. almost annoying mild preventative effect.  already damaged economy beyond point return aftermath 2008

Germany's GDP per capita, consumption wages grown slightly US' since 2008. Hardly ""damaging beyond return"". Sweden Ireland even better. NL, Austria, Belgium even France far behind.

You keep missing point anyway. Europe, long term border closure = food, production, money. Simple that. That's countries like Italy currently even internal restrictions external ones. comment sagging supply exceeds demand approved populations, make appointment. one high risk turned away. completely agree, think make distinction donors patients here. much story UK. Overall shitty response COVID, population government, vaccination going well. 

The one thing better UK US turning virus kind political divide issue. completely agree. would find useful know well. rules mightve written early pandemic knew far less now, still weird thing tell donors. cite sources: Among participants different geographies including infected emerging viral variant, Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate 66% effective overall preventing moderate severe COVID-19, 28 days vaccination.

And someone please correct wrong, would really like be, see evidence studied transmission, long COVID-19 symptoms, even serious illness land hospital. know number folks ""counted"" sick numbers, still can't smell taste anything, months later. That's still something I'd prefer avoid.

There's definitely reason suspect reduces infections, really hard know make informed decisions data there. definitely better vaccinated not, need understand risks we're going use vaccination protect risky behavior. That's happening 29th march need look actual real world data. Fortunately UK vaccinated millions AZ Pfizer data shows AZ considerably effective reducing hospitalisations Covid Pfizer (95% vs 85%). not. widely available delivery plans. latest one country.

Denmark, part EU procurement scheme, also [recently vaccines everyone late June. they're human Americans? completely void empathy, maybe hope they'd care came it? transmission rates real question. people still catch transmit J&amp;J vaccine spread vulnerable unvaccinated populations “dAtA” trump card every conversation you’re winning in, dude.

You DELUSIONAL. risky gathering me, 2 coworkers, one’s son (all vaccinated except son home schooled never leaves house unmasked)? I’m concerned BF unvaccinated. attending gathering.  argument goes way too. easier avoid getting Covid heart disease. may run heart disease even exercise eat healthy life, way get Covid approach someone it.

So tragic is, people died Covid knew risk and, like infected, careful enough.

Thats proof restrictions doesnt work people dont want stop living virus harmless Lost smell taste monday, 90% back saturday. early say really.

A spike cases seemed happen little schools re-opened lot countries, seem ignoring blaming Karens wear masks. 

Meanwhile we've watching cases fall US states like South Dakota apparently almost lock down, high cases per capita seem getting back normal we're still technically allowed SIT park yet friend.  1.5 billion germany. 2.1 billion germany. UK agreement AZ May handed £80m start logistics local production. seeing one contracts. called fake news, exists over.  Link patients filled online survey. 30 percent given infected ..yes. transmission rates decline, chance Covid quite low. multiply times .3 really get quite unlikely. Also that’s within tiny span given you’d fight quickly. That’s birthday is... god hope you’re right. I’m expert seems clear supply became bottleneck weeks ago. actually saw someone tell shouldn’t lift restrictions rest world vaccines could take like 4/5 years small poor countries Herd immunity didn’t work magic Manaus. speak level certainty authority shouldn’t. disagree conclusion. Orange county denser population Los Angeles county yet Orange consistently better numbers. 30% ‘minute’? actual sauce. Yes amount times he’s said variation ridiculous Perhaps spent less time snarky

You replied ""that's stupid"".

They lower EU UK. AZ said manufacturing difficulties cases. UK EU authorities consider matters - me. First, think evidence spreads indicates well could kept schools open focused types restrictions. Second, importantly, ignores limited information available time. 'general' lockdowns 'general' (a) system overwhelmed (b) know relative risks certain activities specificity.

That analysis seem support idea spread schools. 

Regarding second point, exactly kind analysis presented paper instill methods worked didn't? countries everything cases went down, method used paper able distinguish different methods. country X closed bars/restaurants schools banned gatherings 10 people one go relaxed also time, method used able tell one reason fall cases. one other, would able tell something this. event, believe someone else could make credible argument dealt pandemic immediate 1 month lockdown, exclude schools outdoor events it. 

In hindsight Chinese experience, would fully agree 1 month harsh lockdown. Even big economic short term impact, total effect would far less serious gone through. I'm sure exclusion schools. Outdoor events, probably. 

Even we're sure make working methods, think key seems always better react early late, course politically really hard difficult implement harsh measures almost nothing happening even though measures put place early, need place long put place late (so, even ignoring higher death toll associated late measures). course possible even wrong lesson. get next bird flu whatever react total 1 month lockdown first case observed, turns disease serious contagious even measures would needed.  Citation? Vaccine information monitored sub. would surprised 50% eligible population tops out. expect like 75% 80%. Right 16 aren’t eligible may enough full herd immunity vaccine people already covid, expect get us significant herd immunity importantly drop death rate flu like amount annually. helped create whole new fields science. Good thing covid deaths children incredibly rare oriented independent minded” fancy way saying “selfish stubborn, often combative, even face unprecedented suffering death fellow americans.”

No, worst margin, ugly face, visible, attracts attention.

Not everyone freedom oriented independent minded rckless moron, would even argue people aren't. ""a libertarianish guy wears respirator uses seatbelt"" make great news, much less clickbaity times. guess different data used comparable. correct, inaccurate reporting. FUD. works well tangible products, much less anything softer involves behavior modification.

That American public schools still subpar, even though relatively well financed, many people morbidly obese sick that. Bingo ;) put scale, local doctors office 4000 week UK. \*laughs Czech\* mean still, entirely new vaccination campaigh new Covid variants takes time sorry health issues understand frustration fair characterization priority system. 

The 80/20 rule fully effect here. 80% deaths age 65+ makes 16% population. Vaccinating group first makes perfect sense. 

Adults 65 medical conditions also prioritized group though elderly states. reasonable. medical conditions nearly risk factor age is. Trying subdivide underlying medical conditions elevate priority highest risk isn’t practical. Age easy thing divide people on. comorbidity level underlying medical issue versus someone else’s not. Unfortunately means people high risk wait little longer we’d like. system perfect tried implement perfect system we’d end bad one. Sure. plenty people don't. financial standpoint reach average American. Even Fauci trouble word 'almost'.  yup, minor one still apparently eventhough eat eggs without problems.

I think mrna vaccines created egg though? whole vaccine situation Germany embarrassing hell. 
People tried call hotline 50 times couldn’t reach someone appointment. 
In hometown, 13 elderly died 3 weeks ago government couldn’t provide vaccines. 

Everything hear is: „we need keep up! weeks! days!“

It feels like never ends! haven’t seen friends months now, temperatures rise start freak out. can’t much longer im pretty sure many people feel same. 

It’s okay best higher reason protect vulnerable hope recovery politicians telling us can’t anything numbers fall willingness cooperate decreasing. understand countries relax measures soon cases declining even though numbers still far okay. opposite, decline slows down, 10-day full lockdown implemente quickly get numbers manageable place reopen fear cases bad 3 weeks want focus Gen X older. Priority given men named Brian, Jeff, Matt women named Jennifer, Heather, Laura UK fighting US biggest laughing stock politically 4 years really shock went hell either. crazy uk response Covid criminally negligent. responsible locked up. Bullshit. Stop drama queen. Plenty people travel internationally. sorry opportunity get vaccine would encourage give up. lot vaccine doses way soon. Don’t end dead got frustrated. going die eventually. would see increase life expectancy. “The devil already here” objectively reporting? convert field hospitals vax centers keep pushing shots arms tbh News: Astrazeneca halving deliveries :/ ""Ben Shitrit’s brother-in-law told Kan public broadcaster set anti-vaccination Facebook group swelled thousands members..."" “When arrives backyard understand need think differently. understand cost coronavirus,” 

What total POS, 5.6K dead Israel 2.5mil+ worldwide enough ""understand cost coronavirus"".  people claim vaccine gonna kill you, secretly flu etc I’m still wearing mask everywhere it’s needed even places like apartment complex laundry room consideration others law. I’m also enjoying bars restaurants following guidelines. 

The Israelis showing vaccine curbs good doompills felt like gonna Big One think it’s back nuclear war short-term climate change long-term disease rears head. Normal herd immunity reached. Sorry sort assumed (obviously) bundled statement.

Lol least called statement dumb. didn’t say wanted permanent, masks still *need* normal *right now*.

Also masks social norm bad thing? haven’t sick year it’s awesome.  hate guy, I'd never willing accept COVID restrictions flu, effective vs flu, unless somehow insanely deadly strain.

Also next flu season going tinderbox. Think California wildfires, want small controlled burns there, next flu season protection besides shot (hopefully people get it). spread going completely uncontrolled compared before. anyone surprised?? Ofc america wasnt going help backyard without massive catch According AZ, EU said two factories producing AstraZeneca’s vaccine Britain supply EU contract company. **AstraZeneca said British government prevented exports vaccine** citing supply British government declined say whether contract AstraZeneca gives priority British central role played EU international supply vaccines, bloc’s decision register vaccine exports caused global came **AstraZeneca Plc announced large delivery cuts EU, told EU officials could ship doses factories Britain** obligations contract British government, EU officials told Reuters said export ban place COVID-19 vaccines, repeatedly declined comment whether contract AstraZeneca prevents shipment doses That's always it. What's recovery room situation places? stay minutes make sure allergic reaction anything, right? absolutely massive?

The part scares lining people stick around after, hopefully least well ventilated. Exactly people feel entitled dick-nose Walmart, really feel entitled anyone's personal bubble without consent [Protection circulating strains wanes half peak levels 3.5–7 years infection humans induces broadly cross-reactive protective neuraminidase-reactive I’d take easiest one personally great problem hands haha. Good you. 🙌. Happy you! Rrrrright. Even flu now, likely get doctor confirm it. know, everything Covid right now.

In words, even new cancer cases dropped significantly past year. social distancing helps.

/S hard know numbers beyond Q1 devided individual suppliers, total sum.

Denmark however since late december buying extra doses Biontech (2.6mill, far understand doses countries pass on) top standard allotment EU purchase schemes.

Link DK vaccine deliveries roll out: testing flu? effective vaccine? media outlet, pepper seemingly amounts required quantity pessimism general direction article positive right, took ""All told, AstraZeneca’s total supply EU could 130 million doses end June"" subtract 40M Q1. Exactly, that's point, there's source points going Europe. free insurance pays free government pays it. Even month ago fucking insane. Keeping anything closed fall basically death sentence industry.

We can't destroy entire sections economy *just case.*  someone Netherlands (part bloc initially negotiating contract EU took over) completely agree. past years exposed EU's biggest flaw (imo least)... enormous power influence acting whole, inept so. Let’s hope so. Well good news surge supply vaccines expected coming months.

If EU gets act together, finds doses somewhere, could also done end summer, looks unlikely.

The difference US EU US leadership now, whereas EU 28 people thing, EU management team trying dictate (their latest thing 10 day ultimatum 10 countries EU closed borders reopen them... great idea...) people think earth flat know everyone wondering possible...because masks, gathering groups less social contacts quite logical flu exists season. depends virus would get contact with, one, none vaccine mean ""back 'normal'""! 

"" Fauci recommends people still wear masks practice social distancing even getting vaccine, told CNN’s Jake Tapper “[State Union” Sunday](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2011/15/sotu.01.html). choice vaccine two different locations, would take? consider week difference second dose.

First shot around day, Pfizer longer commute longer wait line seriously going believe, 1 person entire fucking country got sick flu? Exactly, people acting like AZ pantomime villain EU hit back sheer incompetence. sort message would send ban exports second important leader EU essential made libelous claims vaccine? keeps US exporting doses purchased.

What labels purchased vaccine USA purchase country? Nothing.

That's effective export ban hundreds millions vaccines delivered. Factories could simply split production, can't.

Now try sugar coat it, reality USA UK exporting supplying Canada (aka, exporting) US plants talked using plant help EU's shortfall.

I found source this, Canada might start receive vaccines India - USA. It’s media hyped potential “twindemic” everyone prioritized getting flu vaccine year way didn’t previously. 

That fact people likely get severe case flu people at-risk groups Covid taking strictest precautions last 11 months. “Social distancing doesn’t work”

“Masks don’t work”

*flu season disappears* true, one thing consider said cdc estimated x number cases right n many know of. estimate be.  could going USA.

Source Oh, mean CPI linked? used refute point? table good enough now? Here, let try again.

According ranked 94th Mexico ranked 124th. That’s half population Latin America. Uruguay Chile, two countries choice, countries rank 70 account 3.5% population. rest population live countries corrupt Saudi Arabia Cuba, according transparency international. means vaccines Pfizer sends Latin America actually going countries huge corruption problems, according transparency international.

Are asking find better table used? Don’t encourage them. „under 90mln“ Europe Q2 
10million 120Million?  What’s covid truther? Someone carry load.
I reading information tourist industry Spain Portugal. bad. Hotels/restaurants/etc. hit hard.

France kind limited damage tourism lot french people go holiday within country. Spain Portugal luxury population rather poorer.

France also paying large portion people's salaries industry, helping businesses. countries can't afford anymore.

This mean France's debt going skyrocket. watching debate French business news day, basically thinking pushing debt back 2 3 generations, grandkids greatgrandkids pay tax increase, meantime sit debt.

Sounds fun right? USA laid cards table far, far earlier that. fact, position AZ got Oxford partnership instead university's preferred partner, Merck. almost year ago now. Can’t get flu shots? someone gets hit lightning cloudless day rain say well prepared. current best guess fomite transmission turned effectively thing COVID significant flu vector performative cleaning companies started disproportionately effective flu.

This good news since relatively low cost measure overly impact people's lives get companies continue level hygiene, could save non-trivial number lives every year going forward. isnt true. think need calm down, certainly British people's fault AZ signed firmer contract UK government EU. fault many Europe refusing vaccine anyhow, quote nothing deny. almost sounds like disappointed British people dying, honest dude coming bit hateful nationalistic. China, South Korea, Japan regularly use masks start flu season. really makes wonder certain people refuse wear masks US. claim it’s means taking away freedom really ones losing freedom dying completely avoidable disease. Imagine 100% US masking lockdown? We’d Australia is. Instead politicized public health methods designed specifically contain respiratory pathogens point one side refuses mask would make look liberal liberals support public health measures, think virus “99.999% survival rate” also true. They’ll eat whatever “my non-science friend Karen FB posted..” instead doctors decades. anybody good link debunks covid Truther claims? U.K. export ban though. second time comment doesn’t change point slightest.

Quick math. Honestly, US would probably give sh!t. supply vaccines produced US, long that's threatened, could care less. real problem part lipids mRNA vaccines come UK, would take couple months catch production lipid particles. Flu gonna hit massive backlash shit gets back normal. Thats amateur uneducated guess atleast. say EU bet one company.

I said EU common policy came investing helping set-up research, tried common policy making purchases customer, led shit show.

The EU bought vaccines suppliers, proud it, thought amazing announced all, look result: buy enough, spread doses thin, demanded doses US UK infrastructure failed (AZ Belgium producer), convince Sanofi produce competitors vaccines now, March 2021... shambles mate. Forcing people make highly complicated products limited experience recipe success. 

It's also like dozens unused facilities able make vaccines. equipment supply lines tight. every article variants met childish dismissal written fear-mongering? possible objectively report yes, newer variants may transmissible without necessarily implying we're fucked. know place never one nuance jesus fucking christ. try put position try find reasons messaging way is. non-exclusive options: 

1) pure incompetence. 

2) (un)willingness take risk. don’t believe giving people ounce additional wiggle room smart idea everyone would go whatever infections would spike like crazy. hold another months current set restrictions/ rhetoric/ mind set, we’d vaccinate enough people infection spike people start whatevs would much less likely. 

3) don’t believe current rhetoric lead people taking vaccine. Maybe data/research see almost everyone wants get it. So, think doesn’t matter message remains (a little?) longer. 

4) something political behind it. single case *detected* Merck spare mRNA vaccine production capacity ready go? specialty lipids like SM-102 purified recombinant vaccinia virus capping enzyme?

mRNA vaccines new, many key ingredients used make large supply right now. might better equipped make adenovirus-vectored vaccine like Oxford something like Sinovac's vaccine, neither approved US currently. 20M two doses; 25m one dose need another. announced plans delay second doses. IIUC US longer holding back second doses, instead banking future supply consistent. ""Doses arms"" usually lagged doses shipped 2 weeks. 20M mRNA doses currently waiting used, \~20M J&amp;J doses plus \~135M mRNA doses incoming end March, early/mid-April see something like 100m fully vaccinated, another 40m who've initiated vaccination. assuming, course, distribution become bottleneck. state middle 65+ begins 55+ teachers next week- that’s done hospitalizations deaths really fall floor! 

After comes 45+ finally 16+ that’s currently listed mid May. 


Let’s goooooo!  mrna vaccines tested symptomatic people trials. AZ tested everyone regularly. makes impossible compare efficacy based trials (asymptomatic covid know quite big factor probably even bigger % total cases vaccine involved).

The real world data suggests AZ vaccine advantage importantly, brilliant vaccines say markets exporting, far know could going USA. Though they’re respiratory diseases, transmission rate COVID-19 much higher influenza. Going backwards 9 months trying again. % country doesnt give shit masks

How compatible flu's disappearance?

Are measures working not? unimaginable, predictably stupid.

I took kids sledding last week *not fucking soul* first hill went wearing mask. leave find spot sled, way going able stay clear all. 

People sticks still somehow think they're exempt global pandemic. flu hospitalizations deaths avoided year

Wouldn't people got Covid instead? Sure mate.

A lot people fuck stop virus. 400k cases 75? single case England headline tells us? Quick math, come on. That’s data says though, that’s important. data contrary saying, don’t see maintain right person wrong. It’s bad say country’s government corrupt, region tendency corrupt governments area that’s truth. Yes, look, you’re shaming something control. whole point parent comment… people hiding exact kind stigma. true. companies retrofitting factories make vaccines, takes time. Even wartime stuff took time. established technology, unlike mRNA vaccines. democrats majority last year... Internally things opening. gov worried new variant vaccine resistant would come abroad.

 matter, though, never actually manage enforce types decisions, making statements. Im sure type variant would found Israel, way far. Good you. Mate sorry tripping.

Vaccines made Europe yes, example AZ, plants EU standard ended-up issues. EU demanded doses UK plants, contract, would made contract UK breached, AZ stand ground.

Pfizer/biontech contracts place, manufacturing many locations.

Sanofi agreed make vaccines companies cause failed own.

The EU exporting anything. vaccines made EU exported companies. EU bought number doses, bought more. contracts. 

Regarding EU infrastructure : secret brain drain Europe, especially countries like France, researchers can't get support earn good money, leave UK USA.

The EU helped set-up costs research, global pandemic. got together joint effort. Instead France went alone Sanofi, Germany alone Biontech, etc. end result invest, individual countries, reaped 0 benefits EU screwed-up negotiations. ask Clorox.  California tried get selective initially, they've shit together well month now. feel like beginning end pandemic we've entered home stretch throttle wide open not. Far behind what's needed promised, single place register, tracking done volunteers, every state different, poor, homeless, prison, detention camps completely ignored. People care. I'm abolishing borders, least terms migration restrictions, frankly international travel part od folks lives. niche concern skewing wealthy (I.e. folks skin game) oddly enough adjusted deaths per capita change much... means shifted deaths old obese less deaths due to, say, car accidents flu Nice article history DNA/RNA/mRNA vaccine research, title clickbait nonsense! I'm little confused. code 65+ Healthcare workers, code provide? specific appointments reserved code? state literally holding appointments minorities only? logical argument 'we tested 1 other'. satisfying, sure agree either, obvious either way me.  Sports arenas already thousands them. Case counts deaths going plummet. great shut within 60 days ending, low case counts low deaths, call whatever want. want hold rich US great right now, many still facing economic difficulties loss loved ones.

So sure anyone made far without major losses, US fine/great soon. i'd rather safer country slower bounceback Thank God countries like India helping poor nations unlike rich Western nations hoarding vaccine anti vaccine populations call hoax. use article table stats vaccines effectiveness infection serious illness. clickbait. Even assuming data regarding WIV completely accurate virus possibly escaped lab - big assumption - Earth would consider frozen meat hypothesis?

There basically evidence sars-cov-2 transmitted fomites, frozen goods would, guess, make even harder. seem come hypothesis thin air, even sliver evidence pointing direction. Completely ruling reasonable hypothesis lab leak hypothesis favour another requires even assumptions bad scientific thinking. Unless data made public dangers ice-cream.

The efficacy 65+ position Germany etc stemmed concern ""absence evidence evidence absence"". Whereras UK took different position.

From purely risk-minimisation perspective, using AZ vaccine &lt;65s (general age people AZ trial) there's ample Pfizer terrible. Unfortunately may case, decision seems stoked AZ vaccine hesitancy. Dang, thought people would get King Diamond reference. Lol. happen notice it? 71 given getting available vaccines. car, living rural area, lame health department, waiting lists i've signed expect vaccine time soon. assume old folks get vaccinated. i'm sure i'm one be. can't really blame Trump though... governors mayors major cities dropped ball

However, stats line age groups antibody results showed older people similar antibody response, reason think work older people, conclusively proved (while vaccines work less well older people, less effective immune systems, case vaccine, would shown antibody tests). Ema, mhra approved ages 18 accordingly. german authority ignored fucked deciding ""play safe"" due lack proof th phase 3 test, ignoring safe decision pandemic decision means old people could vaccinated left unprotected dying otherwise would result. restricting unnecessarily also undermined trust vaccine hamper take up. media culpable much German authorities.

There also couple resources finding vaccine appointments I'm aware FB group called FindACovidShotWA can't link here.  people getting better vaccine also helps you, immunity challenged come across infected person, widespread immunity never happen.

Get vaccine celebrate every shot every arm. SARS less 9000 confirmed cases world wide. Nobody prepared pandemic size. Great news honestly makes lot sense.

I replied previous post fair, pisses normal healthy rich people manipulate system elderly high risk people still hoping waiting vaccines. there’s much it. Imagine open up, millions vaccinated people walking exposing unnecessarily virus. happen. 

First, get virus, die it. Vaccines 95% success rate comes preventing illness.. much higher chance preventing death. people reluctant take vaccine point deaths excuse take it.

Secondly, variants vaccine work well. Right variants make small % virus, increasing. last thing want variants exposed vaccinated people, allow variants adopt develop ways infect vaccinated people. sort like drug resistant bacteria

The less infections have, particularly asymptomatic, means less chance virus mutating becoming nastier. mRNA works 30 years. new.  pfizer? 'let's say mean?  could bit exaggeration. people nobody grieves for. 1 let’s say Pfizer love it! people need shame others, even post GOOD NEWS. pandemic becoming control, still need shame. Whatcha going over?  Today learned able anything closed lockdown anything name.

It's clear way people would satisfied roving patrols shooting people sight walking dog beach park. right. afraid sued lighten restrictions get vaccine become ill pass away. need get approval/guidelines state federal government. almost done theaters I'm really done.

Trying see gets use arm rest cup holders first, keeping blinding light cell phone eye. much involved going enjoy anymore add covid..yep I'm done. invested 5K new home theater system year ago..that enjoy movies now.  feel way flu vaccines? exact process It’s different thing. 

America great making stuff available. great getting people stuff. I’m even gonna worry don’t want it. Get vulnerable population first. lot young people high risk conditions forgotten. Yep long wear seat belt drive they'll fine Yeah part says give J&amp;J healthy people 50. Everyone else gets two shot mRNA vaccines younger people want wait turn mRNA able to. uneducated guess would there's confluence of:

A) anti-vax/anti-mask people letting COVID run bubbles got miniature herd immunity (sucks people died could eat restaurants hardy har har)

And

B) us stayed home getting vaccinated alongside ton anti-mask/pro-vaccine people

Also huge events besides Superbowl past 2 months, even Superbowl hyped parties probably big anyways. Boris announced overly cautious plan he’s able unlock faster make look good. No, people crazy Thats shame. I'd prefer one jab someone come say Gen pop shots light. governor nothing. turning Tiktok opinions anything, really? mass vaccination clinics open could maybe go 16 without parents permission. 16....not sure. Maybe parents take physical sports doctor might give one without permission.   
I know media social media hype covid lot. 16 chances anything serious happening covid low. Fauci can't give answer, hands local state government. realize Congress responsible right? thought makes tear honestly  emergency lasted nearly year few, any, plans loosen restrictions. protection Boomers, certainly know thing three selfish pricks.

We pieces sacrificed. inherent value merely expendable buffer keep Boomers safe. far many people board seem disagree that. busy honoring time Florida mask mandate made city level, unenforceable, governor continuing tradition corrupt piece shit. think lot people suffering confirmations bias. People bothered masks notice ones wearing them, people bothered maskless people notice maskless. already times...and yeah votes thing lol. really understand people there. think would perfect way vaccinate low risk young people quickly. doubt it, especially rural communities. don’t man power match that. top it’s free all, happens high risk populations. reason possible enforce keeping people phones talking movie. used thing someone walking movie played often sitting top watching everyone longer happens go back that. two reasons alone biggest reasons I'll go back theaters covid..yeah I'm done.
They could use night vision goggles help watch won't....they care I? What! ?!?  90 year old laws can’t get vaccine NJ March 9. signed early February earliest date. check multiple times daily see get vaccine sooner, far nothing. better us far greater population density Thanks link.

a observations:

* probably fair assumption long term symptoms much likely respond

* ""out-patient"" probably implies people contact doctor, definitely means lighter cases severely underrepresented

* ""fatigue"" common symptom, yet likely least reliable..

So, 30% incidence long-term symptoms almost certainly apply across covid cases. question whether 2x 20x overestimate... vaccine numbers also limited - thankfully vaccine seems worked well Israel finite amount doses (of lot going America instead Canada etc etc) type extended restrictions it’s fucked response that’s massive push back them. can’t hand waive away people’s personal freedoms say there’s pandemic. larger pandemic US over, sure, amount people, especially elderly, still susceptible severe COVID-19 virus mutates vaccine-induced immunity wanes, 5% vaccine appears totally effective. virus continue circulate (a smaller number of) people still die, certainly won’t hurt good antivirals ready. always told would prefer norovax vaccine using ""old"" non MRNA technology. anyone dumb ape like explain idea bad good?

Duh. Dumb people listen scientists. never said matter bad faith interpretation words may be

Fauci literally said that. gave direct quote date. Game over. get argue different point proven liar. best case scenario. Ensure Americans get inoculated Spring 2021 (an ""open season"" March) achieve herd immunity summer early Autumn 2021, finally get back mostly pre-corona lifestyles. Let fix \*you\*.  


Fauci initially lied masks later admitted wanted reserved medical personnel. created initial skepticism masks, TV months pushing it.  


On July 31 testified congress, oath (meaning penalty perjury) Trump admin exactly CDC recommended steps saved lived. felt otherwise, compelled oath Hippocratic oath truthfully say so.  


It's easy lay blame Trump admin's feet inconsistent message. pretend Fauci's messaging much better, pretend stoking politcal divisions needless interviews goes ""it hard get access prior admin"" rather leaving alone... well... let's call spade spade.  


Trump fucked COVID messaging. Reps Dems made COVID political, Fauci picked baseball glove, ball bat joined right in. anyone ever tries argue Fauci hasn’t politicized position. Surely suggesting **Taiwan News** could sort bias reporting government mainland China? True, Japan still 7,000 deaths. zero. believe write way make clear deliveries going US government send out, necessarily elsewhere could wrong Great it’s peer reviewed full study published along data PHE comes along fantastic. hope reach herd immunity summer Nova Scotia done well overall. maintained 1-4 cases per day (many zero days too) since May June, believe, fairly small second wave started October back control. 


Mask wearing, limiting numbers people homes/businesses, coupled pretty good public compliance restrictions around people entering province, made us bit success story. true lockdown couple months last year. Things remained opened part since. millions Americans across country line shot getting Covid-19 vaccine, health officials still struggling meet surging demand, result short supplies . “It’s valuable liquid gold, truth told,” said Melanie Massiah-White, chief pharmacy officer Inova Health System, nonprofit hospital network based Northern Virginia. Inova health officials say large vaccination clinics like theirs, doses used almost immediately, already protocols place protect type cross contamination. indoor dining reopened limited capacity? seems inherently riskier, principle can't done masked. going concede you’re right that. It’s complex question. maintain oversold effectiveness though. That’s say they’re worthless. magical unicorn tool led believe. Chop chop Fantastic. take account number people actually want vaccine, late April basically open season. know may unpopular, rythm can't see US would use J&amp;J all.

All need vaccinate vulnerable.

It terrible knee-jerk unthinking response treat COVID-19 though child-killer like diphtheria whooping cough (pertussis). even measles influenza. isn't. different sort virus almost never (never say never biology) kills children. mean child mortality rate COVID-19 small worth wasting resources vaccinating healthy children ALL. Children (minors) 20% population US far developing countries. best cases (save chronically ill children) divert vaccine doses adults seniors need them, let wild virus vaccinate children. case, herd immunity comes natural infection, all. not, matter.

Of course sounds like heresy, we're used living world viruses kill children, polities tailored fit scenario. find new phenomenon need new thinking. COVID-19 something unique. fail treat such, we'll end something crazy like vaccinate babies, infants children HPV virus children risk adolescence. Even recommend HPV age 9. would especially bad consider using HPV children still short world doses adults, exactly see contemplated COVID-19 vaccines. need step back think, first.

The concept herd immunity important must stop spread virus. irrelevant case like COVID-19 50% population less risk flu, 20% real risk all. cause, one focus vaccinating vulnerable move countries nobody vaccine access. Could be. I’m going pretend know Japanese culture. However would suspect apt gather all. "" Constitution allow "" - correct

"" amended "" - incorrect, takes two different governments propose changes constitution complete election give people chance change government approve proposed changes. happened cannot happen least year more.

Curfews ""stay-at-home"" type orders unconstitutional Sweden. Closing businesses considered excessive government pass temporary law give specific rights this. Ya thanks you. Thanks telling people wear masks setting stage lunacy followed. Fuck guy. rubbish. US 7th deaths per million. Behind fellow western countries like Belgium, UK, Portugal. plethora factors contribute death rates, population density, average population age, open borders etc. 

The US intrumental developing vaccines countries benefiting from. US' operation Warpspeed made speedy development vaccine profitable ensured companies comfortable investing billions create vaccine.  


The US response inconsistent individual states set COVID policies. Places like California fully locked down, Florida never fully locked down. states disastrous policies like NY's Cuomo COVID-patients-to-nursing-homes nonsense. US allowed mass protests, political rallies later mass political celebrations go summer autumn.  


Fauci blame much Trump admin. Fauci openly lied masks, know stop spread. contributed original skepticism masks persists today. admitted lied, even science showing contrary. way, opposed school reopening despite science Germany Finland showing children poor vectors infection rates low school environments, reversed position election. never given direct answer medical question TV, constantly promoting lack knowledge uncertainty.  


Fauci front center COVID response Trump. anyone play Roman general fall sword, him. lot longer 2 weeks area Ok that’s article Feb 12th. fault, Fauci changes statements often changes underwear. gave several interviews last couple days made 2022 comment.  I'm anticipating outraged mothers decrying babies can't made wear face masks school.

(Or maybe they'll happy rid again...) We’re beat Covid barbed wire bat likely. pull numbers asses low vaccination rate without evidence?   keep track lots 25% end summer.

The hypocrisy. evidence Biontech actually delivering vaccines? None, one predict future blind speculation. far, nothing gone planned everything government said happen happened. either believe things magically change get better... don't. 

Personally I'm choosing get hopes want dissapointed 2022 rolls around still vaccinated. Denser populations. People physically closer one another. late dead. deserve need shut hotspots prevent mutations running wild. Fair, can't get comparing life expectancy birth. 130 million americans vaccinated end march (if vaccines applied well)?

at 60% take rate, thats 66% US population said no/yes, 24% pop 18. means 10% pop waiting vax want it. 

factoring 40 percent population likely covid raises immunity population 64%, close need herd immunity. working great Israel. I'm sure see extent. imagine requiring vaccination school, air travel, concerts, employment. 

Corporations going want force people get vaccinated too, corporations country, they'll get way. Yeah long people get one part. Personally wanted MRNA, that's got, can't fault anyone taking J&amp;J even think anything fear MRNA. could drop death rate couple thousands, run country higher economic activity rate, fast track produce masks later vaccines months sooner, essentially saving Christmas, still get blamed. That's exactly OP's calculations reflected. wrong. HAH! It’s 8 months 40% smell 90% taste NFL team's color red, mean rank number 1 I'm even going try people want to, oy able to, hear positive news. Fauci Biden say July others calculations come April. Fauci says could need masks 2022 people predict partying streets July 4th. longer get blame inept administration spread virus variants. live virus, cannot reproduce... safe father numerous immune conditions  live Illinois, high risk people 65 join phase 1B days...except county, remain 1C. enough vaccines go around yet anyway. Chicago thinking they'd get 1C 29 March, might get pushed back.

I'm treated physician group major hospital system, word is, they'll contact vaccine me. Sweden bad, yes. can’t sure subset octogenarians died COVID healthy octogenarians general. districts area voted. Teachers didn’t want another big change end school year. It’s 2 short days per week in-person otherwise remote learning, matter happens virus summer. Great, friend Joe Biden sure send vaccines Canada Europe! Great article. I’d much rather get J&amp;J, one dose young healthy really need care rest world again? change much neither Europe US. know virus seasonal component, spring lockdown pandemic sleeping may October relatively light rules. 

What's important general population vaccinated October winter come back cases rise Raviolis legally forbidding gathering friend's house

I'd like see writing. many mandates limiting gatherings ten people. nothing prevented people visiting friends relatives. vaccine *is* protective measure, it’s far effective masks distancing. Thanks I'm glad see alone this, thought maybe insane questioning whether actually got not. super relieved arm started get sore. I’ll go back I’m vaccinated. look “pandemic playbook” CDC it’s pretty much opposite recommended time around. opposes border closures, restrictions mass gatherings, school closures beyond weeks, mass testing community transmission high mask use population. I’m sure effective playbook would’ve been. P1

I thought UK SA variants worst ones. Brazil letting virus spread un controllably year now. surprising one too. Ah, true. There's certain level trust papers record like Handelblatt certainly (aspires be?). news broke, immediately covered exactly manner article does. sad Handelblatt would act manner though. result, thousands vaccine appointments remain unused Berlin (per day!). seems like they're asking people start scam. Scotland, average age COVID19 death males 83, male life expectancy normally 82.5

These comparable numbers. average life expectancy 83 male 90. Well said worse seasonal flu children false. Judging SARS afflicted countries handled it, no, also fear SARS.

I guess equivalent covid-contageous virus gave people HIV, cancer, Ebola. People comply super fast. we've vaccinating well let's forget monumentally federal government many states government failed last year. handled better may prevented least thousand deaths. month COVID, I’d say taste 7/10 4/10 smell. Lol tasty bread. Love stupid name. Yes, US. state/county mandates, legally forbidding gathering friend's house. believe fine violation  meanwhile, water wet. far they've moving eligibility tiers slightly ahead supply places. reason think continue, could work kind metric unbooked appointments 24 hours open eligibility further. talks way much someone subtly changes they’re saying every days. I’m pretty much neutral opinion pretty much ignore everytime see story him.  Americas problem money problem throwing money it, problem throwing money wrong things. 80 million people need can't damn thing it! kisne kaha kam pad rahi h?? live USA? I'd like know cities martial law preventing people so.

Would arrest you? Beat you? No. People go supermarkets every damn day. People go work every day (those fortunate jobs). People go lots places every day, nothing keeping visiting relative.

Recommendations simply get tested, quarantine, wear masks social distancing much possible. that's it, recommendations. Yes inconvenient. Yes pain ass. also visit see friends family really wanted to. measured risk. fine, think kind dumb see Canadians bitching able buy shitting US selfish. Like, Canadians think countries give Canada willing pay money, Canadians shit American capitalist behaviors literally trying same. abandoned plans years ago. “Nah, good” 😅  celebrating, sure. 

Summer 2019 crowds? highly doubt it. 

Biden team doesn’t think hit 75% potentially thanksgiving. Unfortunately can't trust people tell truth they're vaccinated not. many businesses still require masks while. Probably everyone wants vaccine offered one  arrive? Although '70%' study highly flawed, unlikely Manaus nearly proportion population infected. confused simpleton like 😅 gonna make summer 2019 look like child's play. Yes massive festivals such, people celebrating. Half country already opened up, numbers low vaccines prevalent government hard pressed stay closed. got first dose. week second one I'm going go nice restaurant wife. eat almost year. get feeling type person would want people stay home isolate every last case covid disappears world 7 years Hoarding would imply stocking excess doses cant use right now, isn’t case.

We vaccinating constituents using American companies developed paid vaccine. Seems fairly normal. Eh think 130M *eventually* get vaccine, agree demand may taper sooner expected, portion desperate get vaccine others super motivated. Ehhh might jobs. 

In 2019 small outbreak Hep B area. restaurant gave us months vaccinated lose job.  Ah, conflated two users.

So amend: could still ask question. doubt even 130 Americans volunteer vaccine TBH. Big difference saying you’ll get hypothetical survey actually signing it. cases plummeting laziness apathy set folks feel like risk getting COVID become small it’s worth hassle (and potential risk unknown long term side effects, tiny is) get vaccine. Linked easter holidays me. want allow loads folks going holidays, going gyms etc Easter risk spread. easing hate people mention ""soft power"" everywhere now. Praying 🙏 That's America's plan. Europe differently though. decision country make. I’m saying getting deaths 2,000 day isn’t victory lap time. Progress, it’s progress. kind “flexible lockdowns” subtly proposed policymakers last spring, stuff like traffic light system UK basically this. However, reality politically untenable: people tend oppose lockdowns general; support measure fully contain virus (remember pro-lockdown rhetoric back winter “if done right first time, wouldn’t need now”). approved probably nobody authority ever told anyone can't visit friends relatives

Uh. That's true all. know live government figures telling people shelter place refrain visiting anyone outside household think comment saying they’d possible capacity. We’re going things control *here*, masks may still required things like international travel, hospital, suggested large crowd. example, AP Disney Universal, used see Asian tourists wear masks time flu season. could see people wanting wear place like that. Keep mind vaccinations moving faster select countries much world. rather shutdowns never put place save patients lingering symptoms. politician year ago said would shut country down, 1 10 people get infected feel dizzy heart palpations 6 months catching virus, lockdown would ever put place. vaccines rolled elderly sick time open back No, that’s you’re jumping line, know well  know relevant sub. not, feel free let know. It’s almost France &amp; UK common culture.....

.... naaa, cant ok. heard certain politician said Easter. September early date IMO completely lifting restrictions. June sure stuff travel? Nah could *maybe* see point dad high risk vaccinated yet something. vaccinated? Go see dad. Whoever gave bad advice keep isolating twat company KNOWN giving people cancer. Wild people jumping vaccine. believe there’s people downvoting Yes, people like make season game. Millions living today never die (of COVID 19) thanks info, I'm deff gunna look No. quoted piece article believe inaccurate. think confused different user. heart disease covered way covid is. 650,000 people die heart disease yet one bats eye.

Heart disease communicable. can't give someone Heart Disease. 

Well, maybe could lack empathy, that's different type disease. it’s classic Biden underpromise/over deliver.

Yep. think lot that. lot better promose 100m shots 100 days deliver reach goals. excuse put people danger, see coming agree. Brexit allowed vaccinated quicker rest Europe.  Well I've always spare tire stuck gut. Many people getting Covid without ever diagnosed goes almost countries never mind Brasil. number cases Covid SE England example estimated researchers somewhere 4 &amp; 8 times official number, excess deaths UK, vast majority must Covid running 30% higher official Covid death toll.

Good point. city, actual cases estimated 7x official number (which would mean half city already caught COVID) I'd rather J&amp;J one honestly think I’ll spending entire masters degree online virtual classrooms fairness, exports initially halted contract gov't made vaccine manufacturers. US entitled first x million doses exporting doses order complete would violation contract. backed Defense Production Act secure supply chains gain leverage enforce people moving vaccine doses outside nationalized response criminal charges instead (very hefty) civil ones. Note: help prevent exports. also helps disincentivize hospitals pharmacies selling doses highest bidder prioritizing large donors. 

The UK similar setup. really ban exports, would major breach contract suppliers exported vaccines. EU definitely halt exports, I'm sure can. know ins outs EU's authority controlling international trade, surprise severely limited. could gotten around similar clause contracts vaccine companies, whatever reason bother able work provision agreements. Good job India necessarily, lot people already stressed go panic mode especially uninformed.

but yeah crazies too.  Go see therapist. things Sweden European nations don't? think Nordic countries clones other? looked comments, see comparisons Nordic countries islands Pacific, link comment compare European nations? Fucking funny. way more. Many deaths unreported. Period. Many people getting Covid without ever diagnosed goes almost countries never mind Brasil. number cases Covid SE England example estimated researchers somewhere 4 &amp; 8 times official number, excess deaths UK, vast majority must Covid running 30% higher official Covid death toll.
The Brazilian Covid deaths numbers joke. least double. case, probably wouldn’t get shot. Unless lie it. Please that. work vax site would comfortable proceeding process. clear go ahead. shotguns slug shells accurate, saying! hand, may qualify comorbidities vaccination state rules. Win? random, coincides vaccinations - case April 12 3 weeks point everyone 50 offered vaccine. Woohoo!!! Best luck you!!!! Here's text article David Leonhardt. (He's writing really good articles public health Covid-19.)

#**Good morning. look costs vaccine alarmism.**

If you’re regular reader newsletter, you’re probably familiar idea vaccine alarmism. goes something like this:

*The coronavirus vaccines aren’t 100 percent effective. Vaccinated people may still contagious. virus variants may make everything worse. don’t change behavior even get shot.*

Much message basis truth, fundamentally misleading. evidence far suggests full dose vaccine — appropriate waiting period second shot — effectively eliminates risk Covid-19 death, nearly eliminates risk hospitalization drastically reduces person’s ability infect somebody else. also true virus’s new variants.

Yet alarmism continues. seeing real-world costs: **Many people don’t want get vaccine partly sounds ineffectual.**

About one-third members U.S. military declined vaccine shots. shots first became available Ohio nursing-home workers, 60 percent said no. N.B.A. stars wary appearing public-services ads encouraging vaccination.

Nationwide, nearly half Americans would refuse shot offered one immediately, polls suggest. Vaccination skepticism even higher among Black Hispanic people, white people without college degree, registered Republicans lower-income households.

Kate Grabowski, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins, told heard relatives friends co-workers choosing get shot keep hearing still get Covid pass others — still need wear masks social distance. “What’s point?” said, describing attitude.

The message experts, Grabowski said, “being misinterpreted. That’s us. We’re clearly something wrong.”

“Our discussion vaccines poor, really poor,” Dr. Muge Cevik, virologist, told me. “As scientists need careful say could understood public.”

#**The cost confusion**

Many academic experts — and, yes, journalists — instinctively skeptical cautious. instinct caused public messaging vaccines emphasize uncertainty potential future bad news.

To take one example: initial research trials Moderna Pfizer vaccines study whether vaccinated person could get infected infect another person. accumulated scientific evidence suggests chances small vaccinated person could infect someone else severe case Covid. (A mild case effectively common cold.) wouldn’t know much public discussion.

“Over again, see statements theory one could infected spread virus even fully vaccinated,” Dr. Rebecca Wurtz University Minnesota told me. “Is ambiguous messaging contributing ambivalent feelings vaccination? Yes, question.”

The messaging, Dr. Abraar Karan Brigham Women’s Hospital Boston said, “somewhat paternalistic” quality. It’s many experts trust people understand vaccines make enormous difference unanswered questions.

As result, public messages err side alarmism: *The vaccine get-out-of-Covid-free card!*

In lives, medical experts — and, again, journalists — tend cleareyed vaccines. Many getting shots soon they’re offered one. urging family friends same. speak national audience, deliver message comes differently. dominated talk risks, uncertainties, caveats possible problems. feeds pre-existing anti-vaccine misinformation anxiety.

No wonder experts’ communities (which disproportionately white, upper-income liberal) less skeptical vaccines Black, Latino, working class conservative communities.

Over next several weeks, supply available vaccines surge. large numbers Americans say shot, however, many suffer needlessly. “It makes sad,” Grabowski told me. “We’ve created amazing technology, save many lives.”

What public messaging vaccines be? “They’re safe. They’re highly effective serious disease. emerging evidence infectiousness looks really good,” Grabowski said. “If access vaccine you’re eligible, get it.”

#**Virus developments:**

* number confirmed Covid deaths U.S. pace exceed 500,000 next days.

* Officials states expanded supply available vaccine doses redistributing unused shots nursing homes hospitals.

* U.S. help finance global push distribute vaccines low- middle-income countries. problem wait later point TBH. Nurses huge category anti-vaxxers. Don’t get it. 7th of?

&amp;#x200B;

Man American's terrible maths. [Here's ""The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated complete protection COVID-related hospitalization death, 28 days post-vaccination."" want math, gonna wait publish full results journal, trial tens thousands participants. depends metric use. perfectly fit purpose means preventing death serious illness covid. Yes, Pfiezer vaccine gained slightly higher efficacy. But, that's massive trade-off given AZ vaccine stored fridge, whereas Pfiezer vaccine must stored around -60, making transportation / delivery expensive difficult, especially poorer / hotter countries. UK placed Pfizer AstraZeneca orders May. 

No, UK completed license agreement May finalized order August, like put less money levered contributions

Towards AZ. heavily financed vaccines, starting BioNTech Sanofi European Commission placed AstraZeneca order August 27th even worse, absolutely bewilderingly, placed Pfizer order late November 19th. 

Funnily enough, AZ problems instead Pfizer. Almost like AZ overpromised. Go figure.

For n-th time: matter contracts signed. matters what's written contracts. AstraZeneca eventually use 'best effort' clause, knew EU carved up.

AZ made ""best effort"" contract UK too. even respect stated contract itself, (among things) ""best effort"" included using UK plants support EU production case shortfalls. California population density significantly greater Sweden. Canada done great!

Lmao that's terrible attempt trying make Canadas response look worse.

That's F buddy. refuse compare Sweden European nations? saying Sweden many things going compared European countries comes fighting pandemic, still managed fail utterly hard.

This failure result incompetent government failed strategy. Lucille anything, less that. Many deaths people ""with"" covid reported deaths ""from COVID"". picture New York City subway article Czech Republic? 20% deaths, 3% worlds population.

What home run. still proof vaccinated stop transmitting there? would Vax 25 year old teacher then? appropriate shite. fact even know worrying. insisting vaccine completely safe, huge amount people taken seriously sick days. know vaccines usually make feel bit rubbish that's new level. People even died within days, although insist unrelated, happening much write simply coincidence concerns little. basically, I'm worried vaccines spend usually 10+ years testing, allowing people find side effects best remedy lessen them. Even can't, least point risk people taking them. can't find side effects, especially long term ones, within less year. I'd take vaccine, normally I'd weigh risk disease risks vaccine. Here, can't properly know risks I'm dealing yet. know I'm fine risk covid I'm sure vaccine put danger already, I'm comfortable taking it. ECONOMY GREW LAST YEAR US RECESSION.

What fuck.

Look US's unemployment numbers right now, look employment engagment rate, foreclosure rate, amount mortgages due, amount rent payment behind.

Yea, im done Americans, know anything, want learn either.

Just keep watching countrymen die cheering half-sunk ship.

Australia makes vaccines. go prove vaccines come American scientists, spoiler alert can't. Citation needed. yet see math demonstrating 5 deaths compared 0 deaths statistical power say ""immune death"".   I'm phase 3 study group vaccine got second injection yesterday.

Slightly sore arm, mild headache hours, crazy fatigue / brain fog rest afternoon seems resolved now. Hope group got actual vaccine (50% chance placebo study) experiencing ""nocebo"" effect.

AFAIK vaccine developed original coronavirus spike protein, variants. Let's cross fingers hope shows good efficacy variants well! Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Believe me, absolutely noone WANTS this. reality now. Humans lived much much worse conditions still survived. able same. Experts trying reduce eliminate respiratory virus.  job.

But measure total societal burden. That's politicians. Yes. 2 available right (pfizer moderna) 2 shots 4 weeks apart. grandma mom vaccine I'm worried myself, point I'm going things. still wear mask im worried meeting people anymore Add that: likely behavior changes mitigate flu. people likely get flu vaccine, one. people also wear masks weather gets colder, another (this would follow East Asian experience SARS, people started mask frequently). they're vaccinated. fine. realize landlords lose, tenants get kicked anyways?? Well, yes. mean risk built investment. Particularly investment risen price astronomically recent years. better analogy would Harley Davidson stock risen 560% last two years vendor issue impacted profits causing price go down. Landlords still sell properties want to. ideal time sell there's value.  Trust me, majority.

It's mask shamers look like assholes public. I'm professor state university, health safety guidelines fall semester (the class schedules fall due couple weeks despite ways students start registering courses then) assuming full capacity classrooms right now, worth. would indicate university system assuming social distancing longer issue then, we've classrooms 25% capacity since reopening fall 2020. vaccination done mid May. Back normal memorial day one worries excessive use cleaning wipes considering: creation super bacteria environmental impact (paper, chemicals, plastic containers)?

They said early soap water sufficient soap destroys capsid. change? We're still higher numbers peak emergency Summer. We've lot good news premature suggest anything over. say lockdown fall, people it. Want know really scary? new pandemic IFR 1%, 2%, 5%, even higher, going able convince people lockdown like time. used three generations lockdown response .5% IFR. locked harder 1918 pandemic, people never going risk giving years life another lockdown. Why? soon normalize this, way normalized it. 

Also, think 50% people lying overstating precautions. math starts adding really good news May. States I’m sure excited it’ll them... Sunk cost fallacy Wtf about? Experts unified voice still entire fucking year pandemic solid unified direction whats going concrete steps / goalposts end experts- completely wrong hot takes. That’s true. previous two administrations made noises reducing investments Europe (and pivoting Asia). don’t think either anything radical significant. someone source discussing vaccines (any/all them) prevent long covid/the long term health issjes covid lead to? bad covid symptoms are, long term damage?  waitlists local hospitals? lot people focused trying get appointments state megasites county health department, several area hospitals pharmacies also distribute vaccines residents. Englewood, Holy Name, Valley Hospital vaccinating Bergen county, text people waitlist appointment cancellations/openings. think you’re thinking ventilator. respirator type face mask that's listen experts Reddit favorite propaganda site.

Because moron presidents telling dictate policy. could give shit masking public, stay care.

It's masking private that's going go window vaccinated everyone knows it. Everyone needs get new flu shot every year. tried hobby thing. puzzles early pandemic. I’ve baked things. service organization, unfortunately still lot virtual meetings I’m engaged it.

Hobbies fine still love miss things I’ve lost. It’s looking like can’t enjoy 2022 unfortunately. :( Super Bowl good indicator US headed, neither Florida’s policy public events, sports arena country right things full year ago instead waiting 2021. 

Again. Anyone understands disease says fall. Sorry disappoint you. Things won’t going back normal March, April, May, June. Depends happens. virus suddenly started killing kids (very unlikely) would definitely lockdown. 
You can’t possibly know future. I’m curious, hasn’t received hers? It’s surprising hospital hasn’t provided one yet. problem something squishy herd immunity goal, reasons we're seeing play right now: big unknowns may lie, experts trot policy based abundance caution continue draconian may even provide incremental benefits disease control absent forces understand (ie seasonality, immune escape, whatever). first started back Spring, felt like even took walk outside get fresh air people would attack horribly. particularly bad social media. lot people know PTSD like symptoms it. It’s gonna take people heal jerks that. mean people say they're vaccinated, done. think that's relaxed.

Most people still following guidelines, they're sick it. hope so, also know Chicago probably last city country fully reopen. Regardless well awful vaccine rollout goes, doubt CPS going back full time in-person next year. would plummet? Flu vaccinations up. circulating, less mutation. mild flu season next year? Totally fucking sick people care people die long mildly inconvenienced hour shopping.

Humans awful risk assessment worst petulant fucking babies anything related risk. Less contagious, still dangerous. flu usually kills tens thousands people year US. It’s responsible serious post-viral complications. Fevers young children lead seizures onset autoimmune disorders. 

I’m advocating wearing masks protect flu, flu laughing matter. Masks extremely effective flu. Vaccines pretty good protective measure well. Insert ""well we're waiting"" gif here. winter storms delayed 6 million doses going out. said yesterday caught midweek obviously take longer get actually scheduled, arms reported little longer see catch up. Imagine simping Pfizer understand perspective. I've trapped house year son disabled immunocompromised. would like best vaccine possible course want released prison. I'll take whatever effective. eat Gin soaked raisins... gag puke  shutdowns Yep! come vent complain like minded people.

I miss normal life daily thread qualify everything *I'm anti-masker but* time say something. Less overcrowding., Probably frankly many fewer people got second round... Knowing do. Also probably many susceptible already got first round surely cannot believe this.. Europe 100 year debt never claw way short default. see well wages growing.

The ""point"" lie.. pay people nothing lockdown place. costs less letting virus run rampant, cost debt free moment.

I think done here.. clearly pushing sort wheelbarrow.  I’m sure it’s hard who, example, jumped Florida many restrictions, see they’re basically middle pack, better lot “locked-down” states, far fewer secondary effects boot. 

There’s also dramatic increase number people realizing accepting disastrous secondary consequences restrictions, said, they’re problem solution. That's.. Messed mean I’m sure help somewhat it’s something mouth nose, impression greater benefit passing something someone else 

And flu less contagious less reason wear one know shitty illnesses besides Covid, right? Great news... US done pandemic early May absolutely following herd immunity reached: limit public super spreaders concerts, conventions, etc., Continue mask wearing public spaces stores, keep restaurants open distance restricted bar access, basically anything open that's outdoors assuming mask wearing close proximity others. know 2 people lied said healthcare workers.  exact situation ""AZ,UK,EU debacle"", export restrictions leading fulfilling contracts better others? mean real, also could due anxiety hypochondriacs caught this.

So, saying COVID-19 induces hypochondria? rate COVID-19 patients 25% higher see general population. Good luck reconciling that. Restaurants full capacity? Movie theaters? Offices? 

Yeah no. Stop bullshit narrative Fauci said would make receive Wednesday --- something along lines. Same. frustrating close done assholes prolonging it. Pritzker set metrics numbers Illinois's different tiers proceeded ignore them. final reopening hard metrics, vaccine available new cases. Well yeah, makes sense. thing is, “hard lockdowns” lot places aren’t really hard there’s still many people things normally. thing hard lockdown need done gets bad. UK essentially left late, cases dropping fast you’d expect. Melbourne went strict lockdown, getting insane amount cases per day (for Australia) continuing worsen. locked right time. 

It’s shame it’s come we’re here. must reporting old data. Mississippi 17% population yesterday least one dose. I’ve doses. like bring people say mask every winter flu.  Less, maybe. None, course not. 

Right anybody stuffy nose staying home flu doesn’t chance spread. Plus kids aren’t school lot areas. Plus covid dominant virus. much fear mongering people getting viruses, usually doesn’t work like that. Covid pushes flu.  Think person would that.

Because oppose racism? Depends people behave, likely r number would tiny we're things stop spread disease uses similar routes transmission covid. dad mom elderly still wont vaccines till late march.  idea masks positive effect wearer always bullshit. Second, flu much harder catch covid. part indoor concerts still maybe back 2022 fucking sucks.

Every hole wall venue probably gone then. No, ""denier"" sense absolutely believe kills people. 500k far US. incredibly sad. also includes 2 relatives mine.

But let's real- overwhelmingly kills elderly, sick. they're vaccinated, going pretty quickly, hospitalizations &amp; deaths fall even now.

Once achieved that, amazing victory, quickly remove restrictions place. restrictions' negative effects outweigh benefits.

Anyone advocating anything else position fear, pragmatism. want diminish loss life, impact healthcare system. also need realistic ""end state"" looks like.  sure demand anymore. Past trips store shelves packed wipes. bet everybody stocked grabbed saw past several months. people ten cans basement. Correct I’m wrong see scattered people say wear masks flu. I’m sure decent amount wear masks public doesn’t mask protect others, you? scattered people wear it’s gonna help? People wear whatever want, doesn’t bother me, doesn’t seem make sense. Literally iconic we’re good #GCOE #YASSSS #USAUSAUSA cold part corona family? hoping breakthrough mRna vaccines pinpoint really put dent cold too. deaths drop nearly zero point. healthy young population first world wait. People like need vaccine. rather want see vulnerable people world get vaccinated first. It’s called solidarity fellow humans. 

If USA others step gain load soft power.  Hahahaha that’s hysterical. weird, worked Melbourne. worked Australia New Zealand.

Inb4: isLaNd NaTiOn Also struggle get PPE tests lasted months*.* Vaccines pretty much thing USA *didn't* terrible job logistics. couple days ago hearing everyone would shot April would take July vaccinate everyone. Yep... believe much going you. people likely super spread probably already got virus going actually go probably safer since almost start pandemic. We'll see potential reinfections terms changing spread pattern changes

If bought Harley Davidson stock government came next day froze account trading declared motorcycle manufacturers must sell inventory pennies dollar would reaction ""Oh well, investments carry inherent risks.""  much optimism blind shield. sub sounds like virus gone lol. think I’ll sit sidelines watch play instead jumping gun either way. Makes lot sense! likely, immunity population plummet. Leaving lot people vulnerable/kids/older people. shit show.  went one states feb 10th. literally middle nowhere school middle field 2 KM town 300 people. 2000 moderna vaccines state they're suppose 65+ medical care/caretakers. hour 1.5 hours decent sized city capital state. went listened screeners telling people ""so caretaker?!"" basically coaching people get shots.  

I got mine still return 800 vaccines local pharmacies seemed dumb area rural many vaccines. Gotta data fail surely. Ok, many hospitals turning people away today? anticipate needing within next month? one cares strangers death. care virtue signal strangers death. cry 9/11 watch first responders risked life run buildings die fucking cancer. bother even show all. get fucking elected again.

No one gives fuck. thing Americans care pays them. That's money says god trust. Mammon death. matters.

I'm sick hearing now. Americans care. don't. individual little special islands. Boot strapped way godliness. act like care trying get paid.  Wait find he's Governor put COVID patients nursing homes. Wait get rid flu still going seasonal thing? replacing covid now? Cause one gets sick flu can't mutate right? could eradicate it... Maybe? jail half governors case. mean distribution based race? that... Racist?

By way, really late now. Joe Biden went visited Bob Dole, who’s 97 stage 4 lung cancer. he’s comfortable enough vaccine, it’s ok vaccinated people go back things, too. Taxes exist pay public goods. non-free roads. Even found 7 weeks kids wearing masks stop majority flu cases prevent 10s thousands flu-related deaths per year?

The flu seems spread kids, kids take home family, especially around Thanksgiving Christmas spreads even further. I'm appalled. shady actions ? action related AstraZeneca heard reduced vaccine output europe european commission fought defend initial contract There's really nothing West Virginia cannot also find western Virginia.

Seriously, need stop wishing go forever. final leg pandemic. Smart actions need taken protect hospitals woods, that's it. So, stay Negative Nancying hiding things happened, rest us getting back life. JFC. Flu immunity lasts 6 months. Don’t get concerned we’ve lost meaningful immunity losing years. According Israel’s results studies vaccine actually stops spread well. taste smell. tongue sweet, bitter, sour, salty, umami, rest based smell. There's thing ""palate"" sense flavors, separate nose mouth.

I assume surgery messed nose inhaled air miss smell receptors, air mouth hits them. state planning may. tested donor via nasal swab got negative. Looks like infection lungs undetectable nasal passage whatever reason. Yes, mother-in-law Sicily told yesterday read end March Italy would 13 million doses. knowing little bit dysfunctional Italian government probably Milan, Rome northern Italy Sicily gets shaft.  actually say that. 😊

I'm going streaking get shots, public health perspective, that's bet. I'm paid promise over-deliver, interest likely path given information known date. mean also requires booster doesn’t defeat whole purpose pushing vaccine two? 
 
But I’m wrong feeling uncomfortable one, so... Let tell odds dying COVID... No, Fauci modified projections based new evidence, last sentence posted. J&amp;J huge impact projections (currently) requires single dose. 200M doses J&amp;J, rest us (population 330M) need 260M doses ((330-200)*2), 60M already administered! That's another 200M. 100M doses J&amp;J, need 460M, another 400M. need roughly twice long new J&amp;J production estimates.

Biden talking points based old numbers. source that? I've seen people hesitant get it, think hesitation evaporate realize tens millions people gotten without adverse side effects. always portion anti-facts, think way, way smaller estimate gave.

Here one source shows 2/3 Americans want get right now. Another 17% considering it. think numbers increase next months, I'm worried right now, especially given supply constraints Diluted like it. understand it’s ethical question may complex answer government speedy manner every single stretch essential worker count,  grocery worker, in, worker who’s status essential worker never question, think it’s BS lose Covid spot line that. never asked go first, fuck me, it’s ridiculous I’m last line except minors. Especially since right yesterday state telling us last year we’d eligible sometime March. Maybe doesn’t seem like much, really acted incentive tolerate toxicity serving general public. I’ve pretty stressed lately, feel like vaccinated middle aged person mistreats I’m going punch throat. say fraction sentence. countered claim ""splicing fragment sentence"", implies combining unrelated sentence fragments together. change fact that's Fauci said that's Fauci meant. Funny Trump-haters continuously distort order maintain narrative.  nah, they're already producing vaccine at-risk. Yeah, understand dynamics still far cry compared folks thread saying we’ll woods come May...

Add variants, including B.1.1.7. variant becoming widespread... I’d rather cautiously optimistic “under promised, delivered” one. get flu shot? Preventing deaths equivalent racism? Last checked, killing millions pretty different thinking Mexicans human. end deserve it, partly partly giving Americans shit racism pretending don’t race problem own. Yes, would even neither us vaccinated Japan owes lot acting early travel restrictions, masking, state-of-emergency April last year. failed things like testing, rates abysmal. Freedom isn’t political idea? Okaaaay. die, die. love freedom killed lot people year, mourned. care. won't. understand why. debatable. getting 2nd quick makes feel better vs south African variant new ones. submission linking blogspot.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

USA use project soft power allies developing world. see us sending shots Canada Mexico neighbors. Maybe key allies places want make good name ourselves. quite possible decent chance antibodies would show test anyway point.  Keep up! dumbass trying lose weight last 3 years winter shit hit fan last March.  Hate set fire wet blanket dudes already got rona. watch,gonna lit, like yo blanket 😊 Yet take “US done pandemic April” guy Johns Hopkins seriously... let’s find mild illness post vaccine causes long covid nasty reactions people reported mild illness like heart brain issues start laughing.   India probably performed better expected, *the* best? what's rationale that?  Osterholm’s rationale prediction? see surge possibly, vaccinations getting vulnerable US, don’t see hospitalizations/deaths thing. Fauci expert infectious diseases. supply logistics. many vaccines delivered outside scope expertise, insider knowledge.  Get Twitter, search people announcing local shots, find maps shots, find discord servers people post them... 

Get touch family practice - ask know places getting shots.

I know single person produce medical records order get shot, kind honor based system... young healthy may get stink eye still probably get shot... Absolutely true, figured subreddit really place bring up. hope leadership competent enough realize amazing us shipping leftover doses less fortunate countries would look rest world. (Not mention would genuinely good thing do, but, know, I'm realist.) Kids apparently transmit virus well adults do. Also, working getting vaccine age reduced low six, per Fauci, expectation slowly introduced Labor Day. effect regardless motive. Closing borders extremely damaging. Pretending closed borders big deal justify current reason closing them. justifies closing them, period. anti-immigrant right forget moment, people like handed great talking point. US finishes putting fire, it'll definitely start hosing rest world. local vaccination center walk line give vaccines leftover shows every day they’re wasted. see seem dim view EU. Fact signed contract one day UK did, virtually identical (""best efforts""). seems hardly logical get much fewer doses.  Quarantining distancing separate policies lockdowns. Countries like South Korea Taiwan opted distancing quarantining instead internal lockdowns. travel restricins still needed testing person isnt vaccinated maybe measures people dont spread especially resistant variants  False.

(The flu worse children) Ha. get drift. still go get shot knowing you’re lying asshole... Yeah agree you. last days, I’ve finally started seeing articles epidemiologists (legit ones, like Johns Hopkins Columbia) discussing natural immunity different academics estimating actual number people COVID likely naturally immune may somewhere 3-6.5x many confirmed cases (in US), terms population percentages could 40-50% parts country (like LA).

Now, don’t think natural immunity among group people mentioned earlier. I’m sure fair portion people everything “right” got infected nonetheless. means people already immune getting vaccinated, fine. long significant portion people decline vaccine already naturally immune (which makes sense based assume behaviorally), means threshold immunity come sooner easily since head start since % immune greater % vaccinated. would’ve great people infected suspected infected able check immunity beforehand - could’ve made initial vaccine allocation go little smoother. Like example, wouldn’t surprised 50% healthcare workers nursing home staff members who’ve gotten vaccine already immune asymptomatic cases, maybe would’ve chosen hold we’d elderly vaccinated now. But, Johns Hopkins guy came predicted herd immunity April (natural + vaccine) past weekend said antibody tests underestimate immunity anyway since it’s really cells (which become activated re-encounter virus start producing antibodies again) demonstrate immunity, maybe it’s good didn’t kind mass-antibody-testing thing get pessimistic. Two weeks flatten curve

ZE ENTIRE PLANET MUST TAKE ZE VACCINE Yep don’t ask questions check shit FWIW, “essential workers” 70% population. It’s meaningless term. I’d problem someone who’s eligible group and/or risk it. someone who’s young healthy risk essential worker think it’s pretty fucked Italy Spain first countries outside Asia. Yup, there's lot different models there, there's ""one answer"" there's bunch ""this probably good method"" state running differently actually kind cool see working change methods work. Well long-winded way saying “I sociopathic tendencies”. 

That conservative think tank cited conveniently ascribed extra strokes heart attacks younger patients non-Covid related, despite represent huge increase previous years. 

That’s great way putting extra Covid deaths stacking years life-expectancy column “see, couldn’t treat young people suddenly strokes busy Covid!” Without ever finding excess heart attacks, strokes kidney failures younger patients Covid related begin with. 

Win also chance delay 2nd dose pfizer moderna since single dose appears (from early data) effective, least while. could mean doubling people vaccinated March April. too! Hi trial buddy!  You’re insane. You’re making bunch shit world around cannot possibly prove—most directly disproven easily. also create reality things absolutely, categorically, verifiably false.

You really, really need help. I’m done insane conversation. hope get help need. Medical advice...from world bank chief? Something adding here. never said significant. said data looks odd take it. Long covid likely less issue mRNA options... Go see Israel data stopping pretty much symptoms spread (IE likely prevent long covid since preventing infection all). Either way dont care vaccine want push wont convince change mind. family friends countries. Australia rolling vaccines now. I'm also glad dead/sick.

Also, vaccines still produced without entire country running amok. single expert saying need 90-100%. You’re also leaving many people it. 10x amount known cases. really wanna go outside concerts, travel go swimming :( take J&amp;J problem ! Why?  Dumb question: US basically gotten many vaccines that's enough whole country, happen vaccines made US? ship country? Pfizer Moderna go full ""Fuck you"" stop making them? Think reverse situation, exactly everyone living previous administration. go well either. Long covid called... it’s coming third people thick recognize J&amp;J’s vaccine crap compared others. fun long term health problems potential disability didn’t see coming focused solely hospitalization death.  way read J&amp;J reports “You’ll good chance bad case, maybe long COVID, least wont die.”

I’ll take give me, give J&amp;J, it’s better nothing, still consider unvaccinated...no shopping, shared indoor spaces, bubbles, friends, travel. already spent six months severe pain last year, I’m done suffering while. I’ll reconsider hit herd immunity get one really effective vaccines.

I’m 57 type 2 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis, want reduce risk far possible. still data efficacy vaccines RA, especially immunosuppressive treatments.

The “prevents 100% hospitalization death” sounds like spin me. also don’t know prevents 85% “severe” COVID, severe means hospitalized, also 100% hospitalizations. state deny you? No. I’m done wearing mask soon vaccines widely available, there’s damn thing anyone it. saying mutation certain render current vaccines completely useless soon. straight possible. Stop spreading misinformation. Oh yeah ? city ? least side effects mean body reacting appropriately making antibodies! Glad you’re better :) never end still diseases like polio backwater nations like Afghanistan point, divisions de-escalate. That's thousands hours actual living then.

But reject projection. actual evidence ""end July"". currently injecting 1.5M doses per day, 60M doses administered. rate, need another 400 days reach 660M vaccinations (at 2 per adult). J&amp;J help, J&amp;J production problems, talk 2 doses J&amp;J well. 2 doses per adult, need approximately 4.0M doses per day reach Americans end-of-July. Even 100M J&amp;J one-time doses, need 3.3M doses per day (where .67M/day J&amp;J). add 3 weeks, account 3-week delay first second dose, that's still 180 days go, would need 2.7M doses per day. I've heard promised 2M per day, that's promise.

You sold bill goods, grandfather used say. We're looking end-of-September, best case. silly rely best-case. project based actual number doses per day, averaged weeks. That's science. Let flow , they’re saying 1 dose MNRAs .... it’s cryin think means, July supply issues. Like going flu shot. April open public, long waiting times scheduling. That's big sad right seeing pics. illinois well, problem J.B becoming dictator. I'm terrified virus becomes common cold still circulates, they'll fall victim hysteria case counts continue restrictions, albeit lesser degree. hope god I'm wrong, really can't see quick pivot cases focused approach fuck it, care covid cases still high bc vaccine basically made common cold, take ur masks pack stadiums. right behind that! 

got laid last month i'm hoping land really nice remote job home. like desk setup I’m sure people get (rightfully) start locking people jobs, concerts, travel, sporting events, etc. time leave unvaccinated behind society vaccines freely available. Closing borders stop pandemic pretty different keep brown people out. worried murdering grandmother wash hands went coughing sniffling everywhere back 2019? posted cheeky way earlier got downvoted I’m rephrasing serious way cuz actually want people’s thoughts.

Today know someone got sent text friend link legitimate COVID vaccine sign website code could enter order make appointment. tried code works, even though I’m group eligible vaccine neither friend. (For record, go thru making appointment). curiosity tried signing without code denied. told friend there’s way code meant us think line skipping plain simple. Friend insists told (by another friend) surplus vaccines opened appointments people (i.e. anyone). Friend using logic go ahead get vaccine. heard anything surplus specific large metro area? think could truth story? Wouldnt news? would situation? (Like said record don’t buy I’m going it). Also overreacting? cuz whole thing actually legitimately pissed ones weaken make variant die flu, bro. ones go direction foul things EU, UK, USA, others working efficient trials vaccines made address problem variants. FDA said long vaccine made methods would allowed small trials vs normal 30,000 participant trial. There's massive difference ""no prioritization"", Fauci saying ""we enough vaccine 330 mn people"" Gosh don’t actual public health experts agree you? Oh yeah - know Probably beginning, US tested well million daily last couple months, think tests free (I could wrong), that's pretty damn good  Funny many polio outbreaks dark corners earth vaccine derived polio.   still essential worker? Ya single supply promise met. It’s marketing scam get govt purchase Sorry meant vaccine. Ops It’s highly contingent upon live. LA County, seems like almost everyone know it... probably 15-20 family members close friends alone, plus lot people I’ve either heard acquaintances. R/covidlonghaulers Yes 15% chance severe covid serious risk long term morbidities population almost risk 

That 10% extra reduction big gap preventing spread especially mutant strains spread adult child adult adult schools surprise - we've known while. Child child spread much less common. Vaccinating adults solves issue schools. adults (and adult-sized kids) Go wrap head tinfoil. think top percentage get vaccinated country? 50? think get 70-90% vaccinated unfortunately. 50-60% create herd immunity atleast Slow enough beat it? I'll interested see!!!! Remember allowed go families house November everyone went Thanksgiving anyways? Yeah that's still needing stay away others wear masks everywhere US vaccinated 60M people, distributed 60M doses, 40M people receiving first dose only. There's fair chunk population either terrified needles transient make two doses. Ideally pick prefer -I want two dose, S/O full terrified needles (despite tattooed) wants J&amp;J specifically. I'd rather people like get J&amp;J avoid together.

And yes think sucks plenty T1Ds kids cancer deal jabs every day like champ, but... can't pick every battle. least he'll vaccinated. However, fact many refuse vaccination precisely reason masks required many years.

Large chunks natural immunity idiots caught already. natural immunity durable enough.

Masks necessary. year? I'd bet June latest. still senior citizens only? available everyone? past month so, cases dropping faster time pandemic. might even speed due vaccines. think pretty good idea now, we'll close 100% accurate idea weeks. sort science take 6 9 months millions people vaccinated day. data coming in, real time Thank informative. numbers make much sense way explains it. incubation period 2 14 days, average 5 days, effective week. infectious symptom onset. probably prevents transmission. better cautious science it. now, unsure people vaccinated continue transmit Covid asymptotic manner.

The data pretty convincing.  Yessss can’t wait get stabbed got vaccine today still wear mask. possible unlikely could still spread virus policing vaccine impossible, especially lots people lie.

But situation vaccine 2+ months knows things then. Chile one well-organized countries South America - they’ve done excellent job general last two decades, instituted innovative health policies (like mandatory stop sign “high calories” food labels). It’s great see they’re making good progress, hopefully they’ll able share expertise regional neighbors vaccination campaign progresses. It’ll definitely lot better summer. data coming last several weeks. shows vaccines significantly prevent spread. talk acting community cases ""in dozens"" - window passed January February Western countries

That **absolutely** false.

Community cases, in, source untraceable. Cases, in, tests positive.

Most western countries many failures contact tracing far back January, even Italy grand total 3 cases (not even limited community cases!) mid Feb, *12 fewer Australia* day.

But testing well early days - again, New York outtested fucking Perth second week March, American failure.

I think upsets deeply lockdowns used successfully - including Perth (April undeniably required), combined border controls effect many push around world. Instinctively, want argue ""that would never worked here"", truth we'll never know, one else West really even tried late.

That largest difference - border world closed early, initial lockdown early compared regions, relative case count. last summer. summer lots people vaccinated start hear people wearing mask hot out. boom masks become less less frequent. goes zero 85% day 7 day 14? Denser population centers, colder areas, reliance mass transportation. I'm sure belief systems played part well. pandemic places like NY London going get hit hard.  What? it’s worth, literally feel needle all. fact zero sensation skeptical even given shot next day arm ached. Except lot people gotten pregnant getting various vaccines. signs problem. Vaccines contraindicated pregnancy. scientific reason believe sort ridiculous Internet rumor

Lets like - COVID vaccines make grow second head. Would still say know sure? live Philly 99% people see walking street themselves, away everyone else, wearing masks. swear I’ve gotten glares mine nose chin, even I’m 30+ feet away anybody - people whack East Coast. doubt it. people hate much can't wait rid them. symbol 2020 yeah, idk getting downvoted, prevent treat? - America You’d love see people concerns rushed vaccine using new technology previously passed safety standards pushed notoriously evil pharmaceutical companies become second class citizens?

Take look mirror second ya. Ohh! That's good point. vaccines approved pre-adults, September. numbers off.

It remains seen many people actually refuse vaccine. that's double-edged sword. think production numbers still optimistic. also ""seepage"", could run needles use ""extra dose"" Pfizer vial.

I hope right though. Several. P1 pretty serious. rate, dead 700 years slow rollout? percentage world's population beating US vaccine rollout? somewhat uncoordinated, slow. Pfizer Moderna making vaccine long time. probably boosters. whatever else. thing now. 

Totally agree we’ll send bunch doses countries. know you’ve handled pandemic well single case makes international news. Hopefully walk first REAL, in-person class law school. able sit meet classmate first time without signs arrows telling sit direction walk into/out room/building way designed limit human communications. weird cold smell taste changes March. jack shit July. remember online meetings, phone interviews, etc.

July finally 'woke up'. Sat bed head finally clear. tired time. Yesterday, 86 year old mother got touch 89 father first time since March 2020. pneumonia, infection, sepsis transported nursing home hospital emergency room.

Shhhh sub US getting vaccines thanks I'm already immune Thanks cells body Exactly. mean people doctor’s note says person excused many days, shouldn’t count them, especially people don’t come school don’t feel like hair appointment. CICP lot answer for. give body gigantic boost beating virus, takes risk death zero risk bad symptoms small well. literally never leave house, guess wait, even go grocery store, taking bigger risk waiting taking slightly less effective one.  


I imagine laying ventilator, losing consciousness, wondering I'll live, knowing passed opportunity prevent scenario. family members crying, thinking ""why take J&amp;J risk death"". me, worth waiting That’s good news next September. Makes sound like isn’t necessarily child child issue. We've ramped 1.5M doses/day, hit plateau weather turned shit.  We're going sit around another 6 months without figuring double velocity.

Over past 56 days we've averaged adding 20,000 doses every day. integrate curve Dec 28th we'd hit 462 million doses (70%) July 26th.

That includes impact winter storm. look rate weather hit adding 30k doses every day would done 70% population June 13th.

And matches delivery schedule Pfizer Moderna looking deliver 545M doses end July. agree. Something give. 

Right we’re delivering ~4M Doses day. 

Administration need ramp GREATLY keep up. 

If vaccines start backing enough people aren’t taking them, they’ll choice open eligibility wider. Thank God.

Unless you’re state/city governor, mayor, people charge school/place employment decide take word divinely inspired law. national guard roll rural communities jab everyone.

Oxford University run stringency index lockdowns. UK 3rd world, behind Lebanon Venezuela. stopped caring May. Since it’s long wait people slowly catch up. Good. think time endemic behind us. COVID would still around, much better managed fewer extreme cases.  I'm sure EU production capacity without needing US One friend. Outside. Yay. like War Worlds, Tom Cruise movie. Sometimes, everything heals itself. adds 83M doses.... De jure, no, de facto, yes.

There’s way major European power would’ve opted without Brexit. one has. *Canada would like enter chat * Silly argument, heart disease takes years, decades even. 

Covid takes SECONDS contract. 

And unless you’re rich afford work home everything delivered live alone, can’t control come contact people may it.

You putting forward argument shows touch are.

You say it’s control, really it’s laziness. lazy lift finger help save life. What's wrong wearing masks? France England/Britain spent existence two arch-frenemies get mortally offended everyone says 'You know, two pretty much exactly alike' even though mostly true. Same, thanksgiving. may missed it, see anything mentioning level efficacy, article. 

That incredible statistic, it’s true. *sounds* like exaggeration. 

It interesting high percentage stay, data available mass vaccination. 

I’m used hearing good news. doses March last three months combined. 


Now would bad time lose faith Ok, help out? johnson johnson owned guy owns New York Jets? I'll wait Pfizer vaccine thanks. 1 3 don’t show symptoms, true rate infections per day probably higher vaccinations opened early. Plus you’re forgetting potential vaccination staff becoming ill maybe dedicated parts hospitals. 

What I’m trying say it’s simply black white.  get “it’s effective 2 weeks” argument. said point people aren’t going live fear. people 40 already big ask low risk. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Baby butt oil? Stupid comment, get educated What's issue baby powder? European countries implement measures done Singapore? look worldwide downturn infections happened January, clear something restrictions, population immunity, holiday travel play. seems uniform across countries vastly different situations regards. ""Seasonality"" becomes explanation - we've observed similar annual patterns viruses. temperatures shifted significantly places, certainly enough start gathering outside impact vitamin levels across population. one common denominator countries (in entire Northern Hemisphere least) - decline occurred 2-3 weeks winter solstice.

I read article somewhere relationship melatonin, immune system day length, can't seem find it. gist subconsciously sense days get longer/shorter, big impact regulating sleep immune function. anyone good sources this? find theory fascinating sound kind like new age hippy dippy take first. top list developed countries. 1st world countries really tracking covid. 50 US states done tests per million # 1 country Africa (Kansas 420k/m vs Botswana find like 5 years cases everywhere way higher deaths. sounds great. state this? meet 1 person outdoors exercise, can't leave town village so. Non essential shops, gyms, pools, restaurants, bars etc... closed. I'm saying going many people dying mass vaccination occurs....we can't prevent every death covid, make sure hospitals overwhelmed. Considering U.S. bouncing anywhere around 5th 9th considered highly rated hospital system deal pandemic, I'd say yes, pretty embarrassing. percentages counting per capita, crux argument remains true. friend said still wear two masks getting vaccine. public health messaging regarding current successes (vaccines, declining case counts, etc.) awful worrying now... thing.
I got sick around end February. country first case reported early March.

I sick around week somewhat recovered, phlegm, every hours remove it.

Never prior that, year.
I live 4 vulnerable people, even though kept generally distant them, much infectious I'd assume would got too, case, would expecting cold, assumed was..


But since mental bug whether could covid..... Imagine was.... irony.... I've living bunkered without life year..... nothing... Xmas. want again.

I getting vaccine ASAP. Doc here. 66% generally population joke. importantly, J&amp;J's trial included South African variant, something moderna pfizer's trials not. makes J&amp;J's vaccine incredibly valuable. really can't compare numbers types covid variants tested different.

Plus, three vaccines met endpoint - stopping hospitalization. people end getting covid J&amp;J's vaccine cold severity, percentage point likely near negligible. read governments report directly compare Pfizer AZ Lol awe fan. Thanks! guess it’s everyone high fever trouble sleeping moving bed. Besides able breathe intense versions symptoms covid. Thanks :) Can't remember. There’s good evidence substantial level herd immunity achieved, didn’t help much. 
Yeah, samples blood donors - corrected still reduction growth rate second wave - wasn’t. know know good day? Started sorting sub hot instead new, that's know. David Leonhardt writing spectacular pieces analyzing public health messaging. wish findings widespread. metric ""how many people received least one dose"" 13% population (behind Israel, Bahrain, UAE, Chile)

Has error here. UK would 2nd list. I've talked directly. course I've asked feeling. said completely fine. many old people left vaccinate? Seems like enough 65+ vaccinated hospitalizations even lower 66% effective- thanks- I’ll wait Moderna Phizer Exposure still biggest factor transmissions people become eligible based criteria, example one siblings, showed email saying they're eligible 7 days significant immunity symptomatic infection mRNA vaccines. another ~12 days infection reported testing, 20-40 days infection death, 1+ weeks death reporting. 3rd people verified Covid, according Wordometers 29 million people. 1/3rd 10 million, twice many people births per year. Plus lot easier miss person long term Covid pregnant woman. Yeah wonder j&amp;j people treated 2nd class citizens things like travel. Efficacy weak. Schools surprisingly small vectors transmission. Distancing, dividers masks stay place least end school year. gives us fall minimize overall transmission virus. Worst case, schools open full capacity students wear masks.

If adults longer vector, virus may simply common schools. Time tell pans it’s entirely likely schools non issue (or minor one) come fall. Misspelled like true American.  Cool. get vaccine (after risk population) mask goes trash. possibly achieve zero covid-19 good quarter population interacting holding Impossible beliefs together time seems rather insane well. acknowledge essential workers keep working yet expect never spread disease? fault? It’s cost lot people freedom oriented independent minded. 

Compliance easy China. don’t listen go prison. shits unamerican though. Basically, decided need remain close unmasked contact high risk person entire time made everyone else house’s problem. It’s certainly them. 

I’ll moving partner couple months looking back. Lol sure buddy. love 100 million infected 30% population, implies chance 30% vaccinations people already immune. means would closer 0.7(130) + 100 = 191 million immune remove double counting.

(this assumes number infected remains constant clearly true, decent estimate considering cases slowing down) hundreds cases came Europe without anybody knowing testing tracing?

No, like US back January. hell talking about? stroke? supposed mean? Help friends, friend Thursday cold. Sunday started cold symptoms feeling like ass. Today wake cold symptoms worse( headache, sore throat, runny nose, feel weirdly weak never really felt like this) try take deep breath chest hurts reeeaaaally bad stabbing pain haven’t felt before. pain super bad breathe deeply otherwise it’s manageable. get tested wait out. Sweden's population young, median age 41.

That's higher US, overall 47th oldest among 200+ 100%

I move around much less exercise. drink because, frankly, I’m bored home time. much sun. 

I used go dancing every weekend haven’t done year point. AZ trial US. 

So far, good... Let's see: CFR (deaths / cases) = % cases healthcare system failed treat successfully. 

US CFR: 1.78%

UK CFR: 2.92%

UK NHS win! /sarc

(plenty mundane stats support - e.g. US ICU beds per capita nation earth, beholden government bureaucrats healthcare spending) Amazing news. Thank science Donald Trump Let’s goooooo!!!!!!!!!!! Well that’s roommate Nope. hate needles shots. hope get JJ vaccine go twice. read recently Pfizer vaccine might 85% effective one shot, I'd happy one done that, too, approved. Lower efficacy ok trade-off I'm young-ish people already vaccinated.

ETA: hating needles. two hour long panic attack getting flu shot year, that's safer new mRNA vaccines, also safe, higher risk anaphylaxis flu shot. No. way could work. countries achieved successful lockdowns without literally batshit stuff happening. mind insane. true, struggles matter. hope &amp; family stay safe caught COVID twice already, girlfriend got second time even though living together. almost done it, still quite sick somehow 2 tests negative, even though smell taste ,fever, cough, nasal congestion diarrhea jack shit nothing except 3 day fever.

These tests hot shite mate. registration portal ask conditions, conditions eligible yet.

I know people upset Type 1 diabetes example eligible type 2.


Individuals High Risk (Phase 1B)

Individuals aged 65 older, individuals ages 16-64 medical conditions, defined Centers Disease Control Prevention, increase risk severe illness virus. conditions include:

Cancer
Chronic kidney disease
COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
Down Syndrome
Heart conditions, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies
Obesity (body mass index [BMI] 30 kg/m2 higher &lt; 40 kg/m2)
Severe Obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2)
Sickle cell disease
Smoking
Type 2 diabetes mellitus You’re right. must’ve changed last weeks. Ok? opinion I'll keep mine. I’ve gradually things like too. Especially nyc, indoor dining started again, shopping, etc. ready adventures like that!! Weird UΚ's gambles keep paying off. Anyone got idea might be? Funny gravitate towards easiest target one mentioned. Talk strawman.

How closing parks, beaches? know, open, outdoor spaces?

And quite frankly, aside wife, kids, parents (all whom, curiously enough, got Covid one death, hospitalization, symptom temporary fatigue loss sense smell taste), know anyone really care enough burn entire year family lives for. Also though controlling mean/median age? I’d guess median age Beverly Hills like 60-65. Would like see demos broken vaccine eligible population. Yet ppl still claim it’s hoax wrong. kids pass much adults, especially younger ones. broader populous herd immunity hope existing protocols disease rate super low, course adverse outcomes children ultra low.

So bigger picture, deaths covid plummet. Hopefully long haul covid cases also plummet, that's reported on. mean like US back January, right? That's mostly disclosed study limitations.

Careful estimates population incidence going take long time.

This establish worryingly high number people population hospitalized though.

Even actual incidence turns 1% actual infections something like million people. would 4x larger already Gulf War Syndrome. 20x overestimate going significant ongoing health concern. Spain lower US. 100% effective

Death hospitalization issue. Even moderate cases Long Covid symptoms can't believe plague became politicized success rate still 60%ish, keep it. point get first dose 2 shot approach. Plus, last heard, still nothing variants. It’s pay back sending us Ted Cruz. Oh turned 24 December 2020. still got things like took nice driving trips, went fun restaurants (both outdoor indoor allowed), etc. little control can/can’t do, especially 20s, frustrating probably lot others. knows would’ve done covid didn’t happen..and I’ll never know. first vaccine news came cried tbh least end sight nonsense. 

Unmitigated, unvarnished, nonsense. 

""The best vaccine going."" Sure Jan, that's South Africans rejected it. Looking Derek Lowe's past discussion this, version spike protein used Novavax basically J&amp;J one (as well version spike used Moderna Pfizer). difference J&amp;J using adenovirus coax body produce spike, whereas Novavax producing outside body harvesting vats.

There much difference. Get vaccinated earliest opportunity. They're good.

Note Novavax finished enrollment Phase 3, results available months.

Also, they're using recombinant protein tech. That's super traditional. want old school inactivated virus vaccines, need get Chinese one. That's conceivable way lockdown could work. believe insane hold entire Society hostage depriving basic human rights reasons live. Lockdown simply could never work stop passing blame weakest society realize entirely fault elected leaders corporate heads lot personal situation. roommate gives stink eye even suggest meeting friend. city general takes pretty seriously, immediate living situation basically Fort Knox. I’ll moving come summer, though. It’s much easier crush strain little community spread first place. Yep. virtue signaling political gain. done medical staff, elderly, immune compromised. Give exclusivity like two three months fair chance get shot. give everyone 18. Finally, President represents Americans. God bless him. Wait—THAT think meant lockdown? legitimately think meant shut grid force people starve? actually insane. You’re danger around you. Please seek help hurt someone yourself. We’ll take ‘em! It’s really issue long mask fit right nose piece. fact might help mask sealed better. live moderately sized city sees barely 10 cases day. Unless open sub turn cable news, covid mere afterthought Lack investment contact tracing. Refusal local officials enforce health safety regs.

Unwillingness citizens comply? probably possible tbh 100%. really good news. 

Right people getting vaccinated getting good vaccines. Comparatively, Johnson Johnson vaccine pretty much trash. 66% efficiency compared numbers we're seeing Pfizer Moderna, complete dreck. 

A 33% chance getting serious case covid contract getting J&amp;J vaccine? thanks. that's regular covid, serious variants. 

Government really step approve J&amp;J vaccine. Focus mass production better vaccines higher efficiency. know Pfizer 3 US facilities making vaccine. Biden visited one Michigan last week. Hurry already! Gotta get 20M doses people 

Supply vaccine isn’t bottleneck right now. Getting shots people want problem states exchange word boomers christian, women, latinos, children, group. guess using words would derogatory identifiers. saying sounds ridiculous is. im glad minority here.  Every sterile needle exposed environment negligible amount time usage.

Six needles exposed six times long.

Each pooled vial six exposures negligible chance bad itself, limited risk six patients.

Pooling spreads risk subsequent patients subsequent vials breaks limited exposure current methods.

Is worth risk? Possibly. acknowledging existence escalating risk vial vial answer. feel likely reason statistic - glasses wearers masks fit better. Addiction largely defined impact people, addict themselves. someone could alcoholic go life fine without affecting people, doubt AA would thing.

Again, using affliction you, simply hoping aware things (myself included) hurt people. fact life. mostly unavoidable since perfect person exist 24 hours day. ""God grant serenity accept things cannot change, courage change things can, wisdom know difference."" yo yo effects thus far vaccine go it. totally different.

I think would true,. get massively high percentage vaccine-takeup .. say somewhere 90 100% range. shock US even get past 50%. ""250k 2.5 million extremely generous range. That’s like guessing age somewhere 10 100 years old.""

True enough. However made statement back Jan-Feb 2020.. think even 1st official case till late Feb. everyone kind shooting extreme dark then. are. Shipping Pfizer US government/states. never said that. lockdown never could worked people still fed emergency rooms various parts society water power grid essential round unless everyone went underground eat month chance hell stop blaming people. Blame lying entire time. Bacteria also get trapped mask leading respiratory problems. paying attention official announcements even everyone vaccinated want continue masking social distancing indefinitely. Escape front line workers old geezers want vaccine vaccinated later April 1st. open vaccines younger people comorbidities well considered ""essential workers"" grocery/food workers throughout month April, followed general healthy population vaccinations starting May. words, barring sort bullshit setback, pandemic least United States July 4th. 5% young healthy people require hospitalization. mean, world easy tell vaccinated wasn’t, would probably fine tell vaccinated people ditch masks I’d 100% it. say easy way verify vaccination, you’re going get “I believe anything racist uncle posts Facebook literally die put piece cloth face Walmart” people lying they’ve shot. I’m getting mine tomorrow I’m fine wearing masks either enough people gotten shot proof idiots there’s magically sort vaccine passport gets universally checked. Bang Bang!  specific mechanisms proteins every latent virus has, coronaviridae biological machines. linger people become latent. Got positive test result Dec 18. still get strange pains behind eyes, body aches, taste/smell still disappears sometime. It’s like sudden onset arthritis throughout body pains. course.and complications wouldn’t anything covid vaccine. This. Waiting able choose vaccine likely going take year. We’re going distribution vaccination clinic mode end summer. one US going get pick menu least September, even then, think start exporting vaccines stay mode “here’s clinic site options, they’ll tell one get” mode nearly starting second round vaccinations (a year now) becomes endemic remember ""Introverts prepared moment/time shine"" memes going around lockdown first started. may funny first, let tell you, really took toll mental health see anyone barely go anywhere. [Don't make things think overlap huge. talking elderly comorbidities people getting shots right now. yeah overlap. Either way final stretch sane careful. Canada America makes pandemic worse globally ignorance inaction hordes vaccines pats back quickest disaster responsible making worse. Yep, sounds like America. Cuomo: *How get people stop talking nursing home death fraud? [huge reopening fair, makes good argument. 98% covid deaths 50+, 87% 65+. Yes sounds callous say, level sadness 500,000 dead 50,000. number big. Pfizer going need average 2.1M delivered per day *starting today* hit goal 120M delivered April 1.

So may need delivering ~20M week back half March Right people still gonna hand wring “even vaccine there’s minute chance could spread!!!!” act like you’re personally murdering grandmother able use travel rewards. like 20 free hotel nights expire can't use end year. bet ass soon things safe I'm going massive vacation.

I honestly think we're going see tourism surge massively soon things safe again. Everyone wants get fuck house. places go (like Hawaii) already cost huge $$$ high demand. millennials point. That's actually much sounds- works $400,000...not nearly enough honestly. mean, risk actually pay super low...they could bit better... Agreed. actually contacted local reporter make appointment, record. That’s fine. elderly high-risk ones *far* end hospital, ICU, die. gat vaccinated, we’ll see benefit biggest change numbers. scarce good gobbled want know how. sites LA don’t check anything inevitable. He’s phony. dude, wait tell cancer pharma US. 

This chance prove completely worthless, looks like it. get whatever shot can. “Freedom oriented independent minded” fancy way saying “selfish stubborn, often combative, even face unprecedented suffering death fellow americans.”  behavior morally bankrupt, saying issue freedom total copout. cant tell stand issue may may addressing you...

Safety laws infringements “freedom.” Seatbelt laws, speed limits, restrictions smoke cigarrettes around, restrictions selling expired food etc. - americans tend respect rules, large part don’t listen go prison, I’d hope sense responsibility infringing rights others clean safe public environment.  I'm even bothering reading this. piss already. convincing anybody shit. Yeah worst peak month half ago. Sending hugs, man. Itll soon people interested staying home Google Meetups day lol Imagine heart disease covered way covid is. 650,000 people die heart disease yet one bats eye. don’t care. point vaccinating corpses. New York bad Gov. Cuomo get Emmy. Working full time part time job time tough :( appreciate lol would feel esoteric point that's was. models predict enough population vaccinated APRIL, let alone August severely reduce chance someone 65 get it. politician public health official full steam ahead summer reopening enemy point. 

To even talk majority (or even like 60%) vaccinated population FULLY FUCKING REOPEN disaster. Combine 60% LEAST 30-35% already damn thing already reaching herd immunity. control point. still people ""unsure"" whether reopen schools science suggested schools super spreaders kids spread rapidly know high risk.

Can't see motivation here? pass stimulation package 2-3x larger need stimulation bunch ""side"" wants like 15 dollar minimum wage bunch unrelated bullshit. government incentivized keep going much possible. didn’t learn much first SARS apparently let SARS2 get bad Canada least bit true actually read facts absolutely unenforceable. law enforcement officers led way wearing masks. got Daddy Trump, told think listened told could abuse suspects he'd pay bills. running fresh hosts infect!!”

Just crystal clear, number Americans infected still tiny minority. company 10000 people we've less 100 confirmed cases. Even 10x unconfirmed cases still leaves almost 90% unexposed. far, far away herd immunity via exposure.

And yes, realize making joke. Sorry. people think saying literally true important people know not.   That's part point. Cases, deaths, hospitalizations declining pretty much everywhere, US much less restrictions Canada Germany (so daily life lot better here) better vaccine distribution (so decline cases likely accelerate faster US countries). Yeah prevents transmission. know exactly much though difficult figure precisely thought process almost undoubtedly resurgence fall, manageable. us stop governments overreacting. Leave alone! He's clearly like 15 years old lmao. Hey, it’s God given right! Sure, want chance contagious version fibromyalgia rest life, guest. Already fibromyalgia, think I’ll pass.  high asymptomatic rate. would expect reinfections. 75% reinfections asymptomatic residents 60 70% staff. suggest antibodies protective symptoms know older people average get higher antibody titers. 85% immunity 90% natural immunity right. Marine corps study showed Marine corps 80% immunity antibodies largely depends neutralizing antibody titer !! It’s game key reasons. 

It continue mutate. 

We plan vaccinate kids, spread help mutate. 

Vaccination grant temporary immunity. Killing half million people? Yeah, definitely didn't. Maybe listened doctors scientists instead people sold souls rich decades ago? People still listen guy? permanent fascination negative mutations? could positively mutate too! This. I'm happy take J&amp;J even though less efficacy - still reduces (eliminates? sure specific numbers) death hospitalizations significantly, healthy young, I'll take it. get panic attacks faint lot time get vaccinated too. vaccine 100% effective. you’re waiting happen, might well find panic room stay forever. know vaccines available - like others - curb transmission markedly. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I'm sure put get attention.

The vaccine's 100% affective know sure. Vaccinations proper social distancing mask wearing, likely bring infection rate point basically goes away.....if people get vaccine like YES I'm free whatever want, run big real risk finding mutant virus could evade vaccine. (Edit: risk even vaccinated people careful, becomes much bigger risk careful)

All vaccines basically designed around one small area virus, portion single protein uses cell entry. Basically inject something codes protein (mRNA) protein itself. particular region protein easily recognized, antibodies people develop target region.  vaccinated run around freely, takes one person finding mutated virus evade antibodies...and completely screwed again. makes complete sense careful couple months really try eliminate virus much possible. Think stupid states/cities quarantine different times, compared countries shutdown whole start.

AZ production problems practice delaying two months planning production EU. 

The production level expected Q4 2020 (30m vaccines) delivered Q1 2021 (40m), production level expected Q1 (90m vaccines) delivered Q2, production level expected Q2 (180m) delivered Q3 (170m).

This already known authorities, AZ comply 300m vaccines end Q3 instead Q2. 

Funny thing one year ago everybody indicating way pharma companies would able develop produce large scale vaccine within 1 year instead 5 years cutting corners. actually producing want kill production problems causing 3 months delays. No, smelling lack covid cases.
The Chinese let covid run rampant throughout country. virus needs transmitted replicate change. copies equals DNA changes. little bit knowledge genetics virus spread would help out. Word Thank Capitalism fact! Grocers, restaurant workers teachers public-facing jobs get early. They're running large risks every single day, part day day jobs. dealing children raises risk may called need physically control certain circumstances. can't always socially distance.

And transmission matters making virus go away, stop selling genetic lottery tickets. Required masking done minute vaccines readily available anyone wants one. point masking everyone ability get vaccinated certain people choose to? wish countries detailed schedule Efficacy percentage people contract disease. percentage reduction individual's risk contract disease.

Skin game: cruise tickets never cheaper admin purchased 200 million doses Pfizer Moderna, option purchase future initially turned ordering 600 million doses Pfizer wanted see companies' vaccine trials progressed.  think J&amp;J applied approval straight away Ok that’s I’m saying, view risk minimal wouldn’t support decision get made it? comment made get legit teary-eyed happiness Throwing money something profit of.

That makes sense. ideal time sell there's value.

Great, megacorps buy like everything else. contract purchase X number vaccines whether go arms not. Yes, case think susceptibility might caused reflux. Every cold get goes lungs becomes Bronchitis. rest family get sniffle better I'm hacking lung weeks. I'm really concerned getting COVID result, since diagnosed condition comorbidity, wait genpop phase eligible. [NYT publishing articles ""vaccine Also, ""variants"" longer viable excuse, vaccines shown less protect them. makes feel better, ICU went opening two extra units January one patient yesterday. went coding 6 patients one day hearing code blue two weekends row. It’s fucking glorious. actually bothered reading article commenting, headline, know testing done analysing respiratory infections lab. can't confuse influenza virus Coronavirus. 

'Thousands swab samples processed analysed scientists Public Health England (PHE) weekly basis survey prevalence different respiratory diseases population.

But 685,243 (1% population) samples reviewed PHE’s laboratories since first week January, single one tested positive influenza.' people dead. RIP 🪦 Say that. People always gung-ho making sure right people get assistance. It’s realistic. Give everybody money. government wastes billions stupid shit every year, let’s save lives. likely people regular flu going hospitals, know... risk adding covid flu.

I'm sure plenty sick regular flu watching Netflix drinking tea home.  think I'm implying?  ""Resurgence"" loaded term nebulous meaning. summer average 500-1000 cases day, going 3k day ""surge"", threatening one broad scale.

There's going % population that's Never-Vax, question many already caught COVID earlier many left act carriers later year. I’m glad easy get now. 

I’ll stop wiping phone I’m told don’t need wash hands. 500k dead still trying imply there's problem Hard same. Please let regular closures flu season. paranoid? tighten? Winter Surge receding. Even Los Angeles, hotzone corona, pressing concern &amp; re-open schools! late real restrictions mandates. hard truth total lockdown like London, UK measurable effect stomping virus. can't get low positivity closing restaurants gyms. Agreed - goes show much ""Victorian Work Ethic"" really still embraced. Working illness injury (physical psychological) lauded encouraged, altogether mandated. 

I honestly hope make changes society based we've gone past year, based responses I'm seeing threads, we're eager go back getting shaft employers demanding nothing further. There's matter level viral load also. might've got lucky contacts shedding much. Hopefully time weather warms up; vaccines started really take effect prevents another massive outbreak. Covid transmissible flu. Easier get flu control whereas covid harder argument making AZ dilatory failing deliver hundreds millions doses time period faster vaccine roll year. argument would go absolutely nowhere court (disclosure know specifics Belgian law contract governed). Again, I'm sorry disappointed claiming people arrested less evidence wrongdoing helpful. Lockdown likely get extended again...it sucks care care health, care stopping spread COVID-19 society large.

I concerned personal risk -- risk severe case tremendously small me.


This much felt vaccinated. ""majority"" initiate vaccination **end** April we'd need give least another 120 million people first dose (while also giving people second doses) 67 days. need averaging 3-3.5 million shots given per day (to also account second shots) get bare 50%+1 majority. can't see things ramping quickly enough get point. sure validity commenter said, they’re really shorting EU 30% quarter that’s different Canada’s situation. 

Canadá still getting 4M Pfizer 2M Moderna promised Q1. doubt they’re shorting EU much though, feel like would’ve heard it. I'll take covid please. 1. Flu
2. Tu.
3. Trips? old it’s posted before. Hopefully they’ll prioritize essential workers grocery, transportation, manufacturing, etc. groups can’t work home choose level exposure, often can’t afford get sick even they’re low risk death. Congrats! I'm interested see flu coming years especially mRNA vaccines highly efficient also extremely easy adjust think I'm going wear masks avoid crowds flu season on. first winter get sick. wife, gets sick every start school year, flu last January, sick year now. Would nice certain government actually procured vaccine citizens. might also effect size 3rd wave. /s fully agree. Usually get virus infection requires antibiotics every winter lasts two weeks. far happened. Facts. Two fold - personally find surgical cloth comfortable. wear glasses reduces fogging, bc surgical ""suck in"" way fabric does, easier breath. know true everyone.

Second - recommended CDC. B117 (UK) variant present here. N95 I'd wear that. Again, I'm less protection model behavior suggested CDC. Normalizing might help others community, currently vaccinated awhile, feel comfortable well.

Once vaccination rates significantly increased area, I'll probably wear masks I'm ER medical setting (which common I'm first responder). Twitter people go angry wrong heart condition. care mild think is, get shot ASAP able. Combination inclement weather vaccines? MCR tickets September too! Pit tickets. neeeed happen. kinda funny Americans ""You can't judge 330 million people"" (hell comments get population wrong. That's pathetic) meanwhile Americans fine generalizing 1 billion Chinese people think every single one member party something. case anyone confused am, there's sizeable number anti- maskers, anti- shutdowns general covid deniers posting nonsense thread.

If comments looking bizarre disingenuous, surprised. 5 December last year — eve traditional Christmas gift-giving Belgium — residents Hemelrijck care home near Antwerp treated visit by Sinterklaas, Santa. festive event, intended spread cheer, turned tragic. Forty staff members 100 residents — least 26 since died — unintentionally infected coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 costumed volunteer, also subsequently tested positive.

From one person? That's nuts. IRL friends family, thanks asking. want go back office. course, office actually bar haha Patienceeee, 640K doses delivered week Canada 3 vaccines review right approved, 49M doses end June. drives nuts. 

Poor baby, sacrifice real longer takes get people vaccinated longer gonna locked yeah care. get damn shot over. mean actually annihilated economy. People realize yet one spending money. see 1/4 total money supply printed 2020 things open back up, going get hit inflation likes US never seen. infuriating.  ask race, age, profession zip code. way give impression codes need. Total failure state working website. code said white worked communications , able shut till im eligible. time Serum institute india yield issues produce vaccine AZ viruses transmissibility.

You either payed much attention last year playing dumb. Honestly boggles mind people turn work respiratory illnesses. Especially work days.

Oh can't come work wearing scruffy clothes, coming work coughing everywhere fine.  germany media communicated exactly like entire time though. sufficient phase 3 information people 65+ license.

Noone ever implied harmful wont work. phrasing couldve better write still technically correct. that's socialism can't we? Sweden started quietly bring face masks yesterday today. One whole year rest world got that. public poisoned even public transport recommended longer mask usage estimated 30%

Meanwhile local hospital hit covid capacity infection numbers roof. Local stories hospitals churches ""we followed distancing rules meeting people still got sick""

Yup probably airborne. 

Go Sweden. fight fight fight fight! people infected already among vaccinated especially don’t know infected. ineligibility children, vaccine hesitancy, distribution limitations also going cut number immune people end March.

Still though going LOT immunity population soon. know new variants thing would shocked see another significant wave US considering decline we’re seeing long usually takes large-scale trends cases reverse themselves. Things could looking lot better April May we’ve assuming. covering fact people long term complications Covid problem? vaccine 100% guaranteed effective. Vaccines work juicing herd immunity. Thus, want many people interact immunized humanly possible. ""the flu disappeared masks social distancing!"" 

So many covid cases?

""Because people wearing masks social distancing!""

The ""problem"" there's flu Sweden either, people generally wear masks..

Masks silver bullet people thinks, sure may marginal effects really matters working him, limit social interactions, keep distance stay home sick. 100 year debt never claw way short default.

The US debt countries Europe bar unstable costs less letting virus run rampant, cost debt free moment.

No one lets virus rampant. America seems daily cases seen low since July/ August? Good job guys. Awesome see. Seriously, what’s auto industry wearing mask? got one guy sits office people without mask, helped brother pick car dealership mechanical dude answering questions right next us without mask. outside, still, close. I’m surprised business allows employees without mask interact customers.

Im germaphobe people fucking gross im totally fine it. dont wear one outside im around anybody anytime im indoors near people put one on. pretty normal many Asian countries years too. explain me? people seeking Covid tests instead flu tests thus never testing positive flu tested negative Covid? explain massive drop flu hospitalizations? irrational live beyond means. basic finance 101. Move somewhere else can't afford rent... like, c'mon dude. I’m vaccinated I’ve continued wear mask, AMA.

Part absolutely “normalizing” wearing mask. stop wearing one means people stop *more* people get sick this.

We hit half million deaths. Geez. Please tell I’m wrong, aren’t Pfizer Moderna set deliver 200 million doses March alone? that’s case we’ll supply get 120 million Americans top we’ve done. 17/18 year olds eligible Pfizer vaccine, soon broadly available access. expect May-June time frame. 

For 13-16 year olds, trials underway may finished approved FDA Late summer mid fall year.

I sure get vaccine own, think would depend age. believe many states allow 16+ make medical decisions things really sure younger that. I'm shocked learn phone-based system-- think alone probably makes huge difference.

Here SE Michigan, almost entirely web-based seniors relying young family members savvy enough time look get appointments. Worse yet, people like father, qualifies vaccine able get appointment sister found one online, calling around asking get appointment repeatedly getting told ""you go online."" Like... really telling 70+ year old man ""go online"" sign without instructions?!

I hope states get supply barriers go away people, little ridiculous. wouldn’t consider UK’s lockdown effective one world’s highest death rates.

I live urbanized county US hasn’t lockdown winter. However, death rate half UK rate. seriously removing criticism linked site? Maybe air conditioning; meat packing plants, Arizona surge summer. That's absurd overreaction seal entire continent rest world disease even already vaccinated against. many people treating covid like mythical civilization ending plague. awful, worse needed be, like pandemics world history wane - without elimination virus existence. mean unfortunately don’t know sure we’ve right? possible seems unlikely. agencies US said they're going come assessment post Trump one government actively making case more. vast majority scientific community also dismisses conspiracy theory. I'm relatively optimistic foolish discount possibility. number possible causes.

* Vaccination rates slow either due supply issues vaccine hesitancy.

* Dominant mutations arise seriously impact vaccine efficacy.

* dip we're seeing due seasonal behavioral changes herd immunity. Hope right. Anyone attends college restrictive state feel jealous friends going school south/less restrictive states?

My friends Texas southern areas post 30+ person parties, going bars, in-person class, etc. schools hosting graduation too. Meanwhile, college campus 100% shut since March 2020, already cancelled 2021 graduation, socially blasted much mention seeing single person outside house. Even socially campus organizations/clubs said anybody posts social media someone outside house faces disciplinary action...yet friend South Carolina went unofficial sorority formal two weeks ago.

It's crazy see drastically different pandemic different areas US.  Yeah little lucky vaccine, least exposed (health workers) vulnerable (elders) getting protection.
 Maybe mindset ""when mom/dad/grandparents vaccinated mind gonna rest"".

We wait.

And yes, distribution equal that's wrong   3000 people died 9/11. Oh well! People die. Wow. beautiful well prepared article. Thanks sharing it, OP!

Does anyone else remember funny pro-lockdown commercials Germany last year? ones old man tells grandkids helped country lying couch, watching Netflix, getting pizza delivered front door?

It funny seemed easy time, hypothetical German guy commercial would probably hot mess now, especially remained alone... I've solo lockdown since March: I'm introverted, okay keep waiting, damn miss people. :( even taking advice banker? centuries* What's good definition widespread? Everyone wants one? wondering that. Someone know irl. really anything scared of. 7 got made full recovery new reported cases humans days ago. Russians careful around birds, everything fine. Honestly, bad idea. need many vaccines get even aren’t effective preventing infection, still prevent severe covid death. I’m expert another one let’s say, Moderna’s mRNA candidates another disease goes trials it’s found it’s super-effective like COVID vaccine, would expect eventually almost vaccines made mRNA process. It’s much simpler make vaccine using mRNA well, carries less risk. live bay area describing experience. serious?

I go beach, park, etc. sit I'm away people take mask pretty much everyone else distanced.

Walking busy sidewalk? Masked

Sitting apart people? fine take mask off.

Go outdoor park bay area weekend see much mistaken here.  Saturday Sunday different parks this. since whole things started. Medically end* social end already upon us.  shit Germanys active cases, 132,000

Canada, 30,000. even like lot guesses based assumptions 
from single professor. less data. mom nurse lot young coworkers refusing get reason.  guess paves way future drug approval without much testing all, since test people. Big win drug companies. dont know , mean China actually made.it think win. Yes, adjusted many things.

[From (Table for: time (in weeks), age, sex, SIMD, number RT-PCR tests prior vaccination number underlying medical conditions inverse propensity vaccinated too. hope businesses everything incentivize vaccination provide education it. many people know vaccines work testing goes them. disinformation, lack info make reluctant. Sometimes people need someone trust answer questions.

the sooner majority vaccinated, better prevent surges allow pockets outbreaks potiential problem mutations occur. virus host can't mutate. deliver 20mil April 1, every timeline needs shift least month sooner! paper we’re getting enough 90milion people next 5 weeks! April could see walk in/drive vaccinations without appts handle month efficiently! Unreal! indoors, tend hours.  two pretty big risk factors.  upside, people sit next other, talk movie.  I'd say risk probably similar restaurants, they're considered less essential guess.

I went times year. went big theaters off-peak showings.  never within 50 feet anyone wore mask whole time. calculated risk, I've taken those, continue enter year 2 this. I've always read shipments UK relatively fine.

Are also half promised? so, wrong. needed. self sufficient pretty much everything, except perhaps raw materials gas?

World's longest lockdown anyhow I’m personally going Israel data hypothesis. could wrong that’s I’ve gathered data ending going take years according nearly every expert.

I still actually get why. Pfizer Moderna ramping vaccine production? enough vaccinate 70% worlds time next year? average last years, influenza killed 17,000 people year UK. year alone, COVID-19 killed least 120,000, per Worldometer. 

Over next six years, people could apply learned COVID prevention influenza, balance life-years lost due COVID could reach zero. many factors consider number (post-viral syndrome, age death, etc etc). Still possible that, time, pandemic, horrific been, could eventually seen turning point led world better way live. mean clinical trials showed pfizer, moderna, johnson johnson effective AZ vaccine. appears genuinely asking question instead making declaration opinion, maybe forthcoming would lead better discussion.

In country (USA) forced vaccinations everyone making decision, premise compelled vaccination something really relate to. Israel? study, know , found certain viruses compete.

I think open hypothesis whether particular strain covid particular strain flu also compete. study looked 9 years data form conclusions... doesnt exist yet covid. Yes, guess UK get hit particularly hard lots innocent people died due mistakes government.

Good news AZ vaccine proving much effective preventing hospitalisations predicted though, eh? Sure agree great news! :) I'm sure would helpful they're catching cases. better none. I'm conerned people still spreading disease produced enough antibodies show nasal swab. majority use masks, uncommon either live. shop groceries see maybe 20-30% people wearing one, important purely anecdotal also varies depending shop time. know public transport take bus times. usage definitely gone least, fall barely anyone used mask.

I must also note live one largest cities, rather town around 100k inhabitants. may well different cities like Stockholm, Gothenburg Malmö.

In media reported around 20-50% travelers following national recommendation face masks public transport. numbers come either directly estimates journalists bus companies themselves, taken pinch salt well.

At least particularly politicized here, that's something. think government would've actually made push get people wear one, compliance would high. I'm lucky regained full range smell post-infection.

AstraZeneca’s vaccine authorised late January EU member states Hungary also using COVID-19 shots developed China Russia.

**OUTPUT BOOST LINE?**

While drugmakers developed COVID-19 vaccines breakneck speed, many struggled manufacturing delays due complex production processes, limited facilities bottlenecks supply vaccine ingredients.

According German health ministry document dated Feb. 22, AstraZeneca forecast make shortfalls deliveries end September.

The document seen Reuters shows Germany expects receive 34 million doses third quarter, taking total 56 million shots, line full share 300 million doses AstraZeneca due supply EU.

The German health ministry immediately available comment.

If AstraZeneca ramp output third quarter, could help EU meet vaccination target, though EU official said bloc’s negotiators wary company clarified extra doses would come from.”Closing gap supplies third quarter might unrealistic,” official said, adding figures deliveries changed company many times.

The EU contracts stipulates AstraZeneca commit “best reasonable efforts” deliver set timetable.

“We continuously revising delivery schedule informing European Commission weekly basis plans bring vaccines Europe,” AstraZeneca spokesman said. Meanwhile US still got 56 million flu cases nobody take Covid-19 seriously say ""oH rEaL"" ""My FrEeDoMs"" even ""It'S gOt LeSs OnE pErCeNt DeAtH rAtE"" grandma 500,000 people dead. [1]

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - AstraZeneca expects deliver less half COVID-19 vaccines contracted supply European Union second quarter, EU official told Reuters Tuesday.

The expected shortfall, previously reported, comes big reduction supplies first quarter could hit EU’s ability meet target vaccinating 70% adults summer.

The EU official, directly involved talks Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, said company told bloc internal meetings “would deliver less 90 million doses second quarter”.

AstraZeneca’s contract EU, leaked last week, showed company committed delivering 180 million doses 27-nation bloc second quarter.

“Because working incredibly hard increase productivity EU supply chain, everything possible make use global supply chain, hopeful able bring deliveries closer line advance purchase agreement,” spokesman AstraZeneca said, declining comment specific figures.

The European Commission, coordinates talks vaccine manufacturers, declined comment figures.

The EU official, spoke Reuters condition anonymity, confirmed AstraZeneca planned deliver 40 million doses first quarter, less half 90 million shots supposed supply.

AstraZeneca warned EU January would fall short first-quarter commitments due production issues. also due deliver 30 million doses last quarter 2020 supply shots last year vaccine yet approved EU.

All told, AstraZeneca’s total supply EU could 130 million doses end June, well 300 million committed deliver bloc then.

Lol. I'm vaccinated went movie theater yesterday first time since last March. glorious. past year taught anything can't rely government entity make smart decisions tax dollars.

We're reaching point country level grift, skim outright corruption becoming outrageous obvious accepted. Thats lockdown's fault, that's government's fault plan place. Pleanty countries plan gave money middle class families Firstly, vaccine protecting yourself, secondly, you’re assuming virus currently prove beyond reasonable doubt finally it’s special. It’s high risk group possessing working immune system. Vaccinate vulnerable, that’s always worked always work. Forcing masks, lockdowns vaccines healthy people tyranny I’ll part it. problem that? one avoid me, I’m done changing life people veil selfishness faux concern others. Measles easy spread basically statistical certainty every person would get point. Luckily rarely directly fatal, also damaged immune system made vulnerable diseases. measles vaccine came out, rate death infectious diseases plummeted. Health impact aside, think I'd mind cigarette smoke nearly much linger hair fabrics. 30 seconds standing outside next someone who's smoking cigarette clothes smell like ashtray hours.

Already planning ship Canada. work public health role setting state government policies, making educated guesses based we've seen restriction rollbacks taking place places imposed serious restrictions. time really matter much given high rate everybody else producing vaccines USA? think lift export ban pass onto countries already approved it. automod would remove comment used certain words. I've happen uncontroversial comments took bit figure going on. Nope. Nature ""It might tempting, simply isn’t possible directly compare effectiveness vaccines basis results alone, cautions David Kennedy, studies ecology evolution infectious diseases Pennsylvania State University University Park. measure efficacy comes degree uncertainty, trials might differing definitions important criteria, constitutes ‘severe’ bout COVID-19 compared ‘moderate’ one."" 'the' scientific publication. 

Also, FDA medical regulators around world never said AstraZeneca vaccine effective, pointed LACK data phase three trials 65s steamed low infection rates group. Essentially, regulators exercising caution efficacy proven, or, crucially, disproven. whole notion ""you spread covid much even fully vaccinated person"" wildly unscientific makes angry.

Yes, still gathering data. Yes, made sense weeks assume ""just case"" could get data collected. Yes, might still *little* bit spread, nothing absolutely perfect, especially scale.

But enough stuff come indicates spread greatly reduced someone vaccinated. falling deaf ears. I'm afraid masses stuck ""well said know means nothing changes!!"" mindset. Grrrr.  Since kids can't get vaccinated yet, I'm definitely going require everyone exposed vaccinated. absolutely everyone, vast majority.

I also multiple elderly people living me, (used to) care even time time. One cannot receive vaccine. 

If coming over, vaccinated. mechanism propose vaccine would cause cancer? here, nothing value lost decide continue wearing masks flu seasons. anything, opposite benefits others. Flu Pandemic 2023  


Meh ! Nothing Covid . Yeah. Assuming vaccinate kids eventually. LIVE SOCIETY.

I’ll vaccinated, kid won’t be. aunt going cancer treatment won’t be. nephew special needs immunity issues won’t be.

If want value protection living society offers you, obligated protect others. think you’re special get vaccine, go live mountain somewhere alone can’t infect rest us. decisions affect everyone around you. Ah apologize. I’m way loop chess related humor knowledge. actively avoid queens gambit principle. Deoends data UK. efficacy looks good, people will. whole conversation thread started prediction super bowl spike. materialize. important go back evaluate predictions know whether adjust thinking going forward. blasted predicting super bowl spike, lot people need adjust thinking going foward.

I already explained ""Christmas Spike"" actually real. People know read graphs interpret data can't comprehend *every single holiday* reporting lag makes look like cases drop right holiday, spike right data catches up. [Go look national ""spike"" following Christmas/New Year size ""dip"" occurs right holidays. dip, reality, like spike. [This pans look hospitalization less noisy, ""dips"" ""spikes"" holidays.

Predictions single days significant drivers epidemic failed. know, one people making predictions back Thanksgiving. big enough person admit wrong, changed thinking accordingly. hope be, too. gonna get downvoted smokers, right.

They know right.

Their doctors know right.

Their family knows right.

They wont change they're bitter lol. unfortunate widespread pattern  think Pfizer EU deal big enough 300m, EU ordered 300m beginning year. Total 600m. complain, wish EU mader bigger (and earlier) deal Moderna, think complain Pfizer deal numbers. 


I think EU vaccine deals numbers good...wish would take long reach deliveries.  Oh I’m fine overkill, better safe sorry point think even vaccines available, German bureaucracy going huge barrier quick inoculation. Quick accelerations like UK really going happen. 

Take AZ vaccine. Germany decided wont inoculate 65year olds it. Instead starting give 65 year olds, sitting it. currently rules state 80+ year olds frontline workers currently inoculated. sell countries negiatiated higher price got bribes from. 100% agree this. Although spead misinformation social media exposure whole anti mask movement US groups people started believing wearing masks etc. overall respect government mandates wear mask whether believe stupid conspiracies. Leaders *all* political parties worn masks right moment asked to. heard instance someone yelled store keeper letting inside without mask. rule rule. 

Something personally come notice people third world countries trust high ranking scientists doctors information hear relatives/ friends. 

This helps better management imo. sad many countries turned political issue. answer report them. think care time? Like constantly trying offset stuff? Report stuff see help us positive way instead making job difficult starting meta drama.  trying tell bag bags? I'm hungry right Pfizer Moderna extremely powerful vaccines, you’re young good health might actually overkill. obviously take that’s you’re offered, work Ooh!! find source spread stopping? shots new ""strains."" Currently, variants circulating protected currently available vaccines.

It's going go away completely, days constant looming threat almost behind us. Beyond Astrazeneca, deal Serum Institute India. deal Brazil produced Fiocruz. Lockdowns easily measured damages caused. People weren’t speaking reason all. affluent gained working class people harmed, cases irreparably. must received lot pay life insurance. /s LA \~ 4 million population according quick google search. 40 cases total. 10 cases / 1,000,000. Hm?  perks getting pfizer vs moderna vs JnJ gets approved? younger good health knows shot available curious one hoping for/trying get possible.  get flu shot lol. That's two million adjust population.  know flu might it. experienced flu symptoms (tickle throat, 5 hours later shaking &amp; sweating bed); nothing like cold. Slugs red dot let get heads way across level. Good luck! really hope guys sorted soon. quicker come hiding better! spread misinformation. say article linked vioxx paid 7 billion ? Supreme Court ruled last ten years AstraZeneca shady company think restrictions, starting now, process loosening don’t even need restrictions point everyone’s offered one. point vaccines become available everyone, restrictions gone almost everyone truly needs vaccine gotten theirs. right, landlords necessary. skip one buy property yourself. obviously problem competing lots people also want skip landlords live desirable place, want tie tremendous amounts capital property long period time.

Look, I'm making humanitarian argument, I'm making economic one. agree would nice, I'm giving cold hard reality rational actors going actually do. Landlords going operate loss, period. know net profit going negative, going get game. prospective landlords also recognize prices must go substantially make economic investment worth risk. meantime, ample opportunity hedge funds speculators swoop keep properties vacant inflation hedges place park money. means rental unit, means outbid everyone else fewer units available rent. Supply demand.

Landlords simply supply housing liquidity, allowing people move much cheaply easily via buying. means change jobs move cities without incurring costs involved real-estate transaction. want actually fix problem rising rent prices income inequality, sniping landlords going help you, going make problem worse. Vaccines awesome, drop started available.  know they're testing less flu. That's great question. imagine Covid test comes first, always. Whether follow flu test question. Mind linking thoughtful answers reddit search sucks simply cannot find info. comprehension skills need work. dont doubt that. kind nice isolated (my town accessible boat airplane, road out) fortunate pandemic affect us much. many cases assholes come vacation get away covid lower 48. come cases start popping up. ruined cruise ship tourism though everybody broke fuck nice wade throngs tourists summer living life. sure yourself... Yeah like said, saying agree article, saying bother read - source linked.
You said know got from, told you. I've got issue anything said. chosen individual, sure.

Mandates absolutely go, business based policies. Rectified downvote humorless freak. good, lol. think people realize long COVID sever COVID people upvote comment. 10 million residents county   ~100 cases / day. Unless get artificially round bit.

So, basically impossible. vaccine sat unused 30 days, it’s game on. Open everything. Why? There's little international travel. hard seed influenza countries spread. always come natural reservoirs, mitigations put affect covid bigger effect influenza since less infectious. plus 2x many people got flu vaccine crazy. Well, personally think great despite poor leadership Britain success vaccine program. one wants see innocents die due failures leaders, right? Right, flu thing anymore world living in? People states whether they’re vaccinated not. flu specifically caused [Influenza [common caused variety viruses (most often [rhinovirus cause upper respiratory tract infections. live Germany: EU insisted buying vaccines together poor countries (i.e. Portugal, Greece, Poland) would chance fucked badly criminal. Germany, we’ve lockdown since November vaccines going people hospice. People pissed probably going stop cooperating weather warms up. really know close finishing next trial. Didnt say disappointed ED choice?? im confused certainly think one concerns overwhelming available healthcare. UK flu stretch resources NHS normal year. Add Covid basically find capacity unable effectively treat great number people, would disaster.

 Covid associated 0.1% mortality averaged across general population (that's best recall reasonable number), untreated Covid could imagine would least 10 times that.  Well aged like milk, AstraZeneca announced deliver half q2... literally every place I’ve ever lived states there’s plenty places give free flu shots know. People catch covid now. Flu thing longer. Gotcha Hahahhahahhahhha  serious taken seriously. basically wearing mask wearing mask. Absolutely fucking stupid wear mask get effective vaccine. 

What forgetting absolutely need get critical mass vaccinated people (herd immunity) soon possible. everyone waits absolute best vaccine, we're playing fire.

Your mask analogy flawed premise choice moment. clock ticking. Well looking wikipedia looks like used treat covid patients. Definitely take kids indoor play centers flu season

I mean, that's basically time take kids indoor play centers. live Texas Mississippi gets oppressive months summer. what?  Interruption spread border closures viral interference.

Both well known.

There mystery. Okay, joke bad indistinguishable someone piece shit. Sarcasm work well 3 word sentences internet.

Your comment got deleted, like Trump? Lmao remaining people get vaccinated, covid spread, natural immunity quickly reached

Yes, they'll eventually give rise new mutation makes vaccines less effective need it, selfish know get leaflet whatever side effects vaccine are? Yeah, we're getting that.

See, here's part get go ""Oh, so, person blaming know-it-all actually know they're talking play: know significantly less think know, listen public health experts do? reason think long term side effects echo chamber. We've putting mRNA tech people 25 years seen side effects worried about, want right tell exactly evidence long term side effects, I've got 25 years evidence telling ""There long term side effects""

Not seems, stigmatized. Somehow moralized catching highly infectious respiratory virus much, people ashamed catching hide positive status. helpful tracing prevention.

Feels like AIDS crisis. time, what's immoralized normal human activities. Bonkers. actually bothered reading article commenting, headline, know testing done analysing respiratory infections lab. can't confuse influenza virus Coronavirus. 

'Thousands swab samples processed analysed scientists Public Health England (PHE) weekly basis survey prevalence different respiratory diseases population.

But 685,243 samples reviewed PHE’s laboratories since first week January, single one tested positive influenza.' could change big way. mRNA vaccines *huge* breakthrough, speculation could lead truly universal flu vaccine. advances made year could dramatically affect immunization treatment viruses well.

Respiratory viruses good thing going, COVID get greedy fuck everyone. cannot work home missing lessons internet. year really hard finished 10th grade perfect marks realschule + (the low form never first second grade). Abi higher form aducation. way harder since Gymnasium level 2 levels last year. missed lot end 10th grade teachers simply offer online school teach stuff start here. 


If went school could risk death grandparents, caretakers. would result drug addictive Vater getting possetions wich bank would take cover debt. little sister would left without home. scared risk almost homeless bunch times. could work good job, marks last year could bit work really get manager position. finding job pandemic hard jugendamt would go grandmother find cause dropped school. 

Everything way risky right now. actually bothered reading article commenting, headline, know testing done analysing respiratory infections lab. can't confuse influenza virus Coronavirus. 

'Thousands swab samples processed analysed scientists Public Health England (PHE) weekly basis survey prevalence different respiratory diseases population.

No severe disease day 28. 85% effective moderate disease day 28, 100% day 49. Mostly luck, guess. Covid guaranteed spread contact someone. also may gotten it, mild symptoms, known it.  Flu vaccine take among vulnerable groups highest record Oct-Nov 2020 you!! Oh okay, guess flu non-existent year magic then. Yeah they've fucking Canada lack exports well. Oh well, atleast vaccines starting come in. look deaths age race. minority groups disproportionately affected covid almost 1/3 deaths happening 65 demographic. There's fairly decent chance never knew it. Yes I’m optimistic too. older one school reopening next week I’m quandary wondering send keep virtual summer. kid needs social interaction also seems way early, toddler home alone without sister ""It's fairly effective preventing serious STIs! happy use it!""   talk marks early due shortages referred n95 masks healthcare workers access Eradication flu impossible moment hosts species well. would keep replicating mutating horses, pigs, birds even single human caught particular season. haven’t done anything remotely normal since Mid-March cleaning college dorm, occasional trips 7/11, Dunkin, Haagen Daaz get snacks would eat somewhere secluded outside aren’t many people. 

I’m hoping find work Spring start saving place goals year expert’s current rhetoric. Actually flu vaccination drive took place Oct Nov 2020.

Take unusually high, age groups 90%. low behold, vaccinated population, get sick. That’s there. mistake /s put non Covid patients ship. 17, remember correctly. happened commercial entities closed residential supply needed increased. It’s actually pretty logical. one offices hotels cruise ships. food health supplies shifted oversight.

You can’t sell commercial toilet paper stores. It’s labeled distribution isn’t set up.

So natural occurrence people incorrectly pin hoarders. unless sick people actually something protect others, staying home, washing hands masks. excuse flu needs spread unchecked. Exactly. I'd rather protect life thanks. We've year now. absolutely fucking stupid get less effective vaccine. 

Like hey guys mind using condom holes right? Oh turned 24 December 2020. still got things like took nice driving trips, went fun restaurants (both outdoor indoor allowed), etc. little control can/can’t do, especially 20s, frustrating probably lot others. knows would’ve done covid didn’t happen..and I’ll never know. first vaccine news came cried tbh least end sight Oh meant rather didn’t get COVID, vaccine. would gladly vaccinate approved safe. anti-vax, I’m anti-science

You unfortunately. free want w.r.t. vaccinations clear fundamentally understand scientific process basic university level statistics. also gets vaccines imported EU even close. don’t think made calculations? randomly landed current dosage vial amounts/processes?

Have considered ramifications mishandled batch vaccine acceptance rates? People looking flaws justify anti-vaxx views. Safety number one priority fucked. Belgium's method measuring Coronavirus deaths brutally honest give shit saving political face. basically ends excess deaths yearly average. 

Point Belgium really belong list. measured deaths way rest us death rate would much lower I’ve two cases recently people actively trying avoid saying got COVID. 

I family member died recently immediate family didn’t tell anyone Covid. found weird coincidence.

I also found friend family positive right now. didn’t tell anyone yet share literally everything social media.

It seems like COVID become stigmatized. guys observed that? may problems stem people hesitant talk it. Schools closed Czechia basicaly last march. Alright, rest world? aren’t meeting delivery requirements EU... That's fine want that, nuts still forcing kind silly safety theater everyone. much Lightfoot Pritzker talk following Science(tm), sure lot arbitrary nonsense. Normally, evict non-payment. That's allowed moment, landlords placed impossible position.

No person making kind investment could predicted year type position. goes well beyond normal levels risk. going one universal date lockdown over, hate tell you. Plus, wearing mask extra months equivalent complete lockdown (not people followed complete lockdown anyways) Y'all also (have!) payouts JobSeekers helped many families stay fed roofs heads.

These people weird. nitpick successful countries slip ups turn blind eye huge dumpster fire own.  Thanks! seems like rough couple days! wonder doctor planning shots fridays patients.

Do think covid that? commenter said bad already infected previously. resolved quickly one went months. That’s total lie. tried new hobby thing unemployed couldn’t focus. Ended going walks playing Xbox every day. Credit people found new passions. think manufacturing facilities Belgium Germany also Sweden Norway essentially zero mask usage also essentially zero flu. ultimately, bank owns home collateral (landlords pay banks)

the banks ultimately bailed gov't printing press, gov't tell banks suspend temporarily collections, trickles landlords. realise Australia also worked vaccine? New Zealand lift button transmission

I find hard believe especially infected person enters confined space poor ventilation (an elevator) right touching button. Stop racist. much better others though. jj one unquestionably worst one. That's good. Hopefully keep going I've never paid flu vaccine, even without insurance? lot people adopted hyper-individualistic notion virus still spreading ""bad people"" rather policy failures. basic anti-political idea ""if everyone like me, would problems!"" lot people also assuming anyone gets sick ""being bad"" completely ignoring things like masks distancing mitigation devices, shields. Google 'toilet paper shortages US', dont know willfully ignorant stupid thing. They’re team, they’re better two years ago they’re happy. restrictions given vaccine tossed window favor making sure vaccines aren’t sitting shelves.

Yea, tell doctor ARRESTED dispensing vaccines going wish making up... plenty people pro-vaccine, want one. Newsom clue he’s doing, he’s extreme Cuomo mitigation measures point. Well, recent college grad, I’ve made getting second vaccination weekend without getting COVID, none quarantine group gotten well. Tbh, pretty easy get it. live SD, CA. 

So question is, many people getting infected dying, yet basic quarantine wasn’t even locked inside home, never got it. Luck? people generally suck limiting circle physical contacts? work physically since June too, drove small trips. It’s like I’ve monk. grades slipping cannot learn home

Ok, want go school can't learn home either. exactly expect this? one help neither option works you. article NYT past weekend acknowledged messaging led vaccine hesitancy better stop drinking water! It’s full chemical H2O. 

Seriously everything made chemicals. get water poisoning drinking much. 

Look MRNA vaccine technology— gives body blue print make harmless spike protein virus uses enter body. body creates antibodies spike protein. 

If get COVID you’re risk many problems, long term. I’m young really afraid getting COVID, I’m afraid lingering effects COVID. think urgency present J&amp;J. significant profit motive get shots people’s arms quickly possible. society’s approach unhealthy mean obtuse stupid. one said society. know words mean? Society government fucking yet fucking purposely acting like think make stupid shitty point one arguing first place. I'll pass J&amp;J 100% wait either two. I'm rush better options available. Yes, children benefit others around vaccinated. simply less vectors available become infected. 

However, would caution ruling vaccine children point, simply enough data yet. Keep eye published studies regarding children throughout rest year. ability make informed decision increase time passes. think people know anything like chronic illness/disability. Spoilers: sucks there's little support system. basically ""remission"" endometriosis excellent surgeon took care mine 7 years ago. (I permanent issues internal scarring, manageable cut certain things diet.) chronic illness experience, I'm everything power protect covid go again. Yea, much outweighs unknown long term effects mRNA vaccines. Plus, point we'll herd immunity well. things considered, want standard-style vaccine. won’t new flu, along flu. Exactly. like, would rather wear helmet that's less effective preventing concussion get back mountain biking tomorrow, hold mountain biking another months get superior helmet that's effective preventing concussion?  making 1 million n95 per day instead Per CDC recommendations. Theyre going want get jail.
Ppossibly mismanagement CDC make “not big deal” “just flu bro” led this. North Carolina, SC, VA investigated undercounting deaths nursing home well.  Hygiene Theater It’s also crazy ignored “wear two masks” narrative everyone states. 

Numbers declining anyways.

Experts wrong super bowl super spreaders well. think that's point... Waiting risking life long term health. getting slightly less effective vaccine that's what's available first.

Which scenario think likely get sick in? (made timelines/amounts used make general point, completely accurate)
1. along 80% population gets single dose vaccine next 3 months since widely available done quickly.
2. 50% population first dose vacccine within 3 months, next one still lined up, get first dose 3 months earliest. Second dose take longer, reach full efficacy get it.

I think people trying say completely reasonable want better vaccine. course. too. reality is, lot people vaccinated shorter amount time, given protection much earlier, even less effective vaccine, much better off.

By waiting, leaving way people without vaccine all, meaning spreading population general, still completely vulnerable well since vaccine protection waiting better one.

Waiting gives zero protection, much bigger risk. Again, combined less people overall getting it, increasing chance exposure too. something need make everyone else happy. anyone else really... think anyone cares vaccine got personally long got one. They're trying say better protected, either kind vaccine that, get can/what available rather taking risk catching protection would rather hold extra 10-20% better result.

Do even know can't get both? info all, sorry ignorance. possible ""everyone"" vaccinated, always get better one afterwards, different booster released people got single dose version, make sure everyone effective protection lasts.

I would rather get two dose vaccine could choose, based hard get vaccine area already, think would take whatever get doctor. save lot stress hassle. sure even qualify yet, people get basically sit monitor websites days waiting openings, see right either one. I'll take I'm offered becomes available, hopefully soon. really feels like end game here, it’s demoralizing context widespread highly effective vaccinations. There’s possibility even labs campus remain closed fall. shows coronavirus interacts adenovirus, respiratory synctial virus, parainfluenza(which, despite name, related flu, causes croup), interact influenza.

Thanks? poor enough choose food flu shot definitely qualify medicaid get shot free. Yes, terrible I've part try buy goods services people ""do right"". Maybe come together country get people actually follow health guidelines laws reopen business?

The people ignored everything helped destroy business. people voted morons gave tax money rich friends instead you. mad people double-fucked you? far I'm aware, vaccines still limited. work healthcare industry technically part responsibilities would occasionally visiting site replace servers whatever else remotely. However, even since Covid started.

I'm late 20's outside job, would eligible vaccine. question people healthcare. vaccine rollout still limited would opinion got now? course want vaccine, also want take spot someone could actually serious chance risk. killing disproportionately. killing essential workers able work home disproportionately regardless color skin have. issue vaccine racial statistics we're prioritizing elderly (who overwhelmingly white) essential workers (who disproportionately minorities).  ""This guy White Castle asked autograph. signed it, 'Dear Covid, thanks support, asshole.'"" smell cig smoke. I'm worried vaccine.

I'm worried Pfizer J&amp;J going over.

They already horrifying monsters pandemic.

After pandemic, they'll horrifying monsters massive production capabilities. they're already done. next stage. Basically essential workers people comorbidities. later start April thT general availability starts.  Fauci said can't stop taking precautions, vaccine 100% effective. Well yeah   Holy shit taken forever. Happy help! Newsom voted out. stupid virtue theatre costing real people lives. honestly think people naturally immune covid-19 vaccine readily available. I'm dissing makers, seems like obvious thing happened. Yep - Montana this! GO MONTANA!! actually bothered reading article commenting, headline, know testing done analysing respiratory infections lab. can't confuse influenza virus Coronavirus. 

'Thousands swab samples processed analysed scientists Public Health England (PHE) weekly basis survey prevalence different respiratory diseases population.

But 685,243 samples reviewed PHE’s laboratories since first week January, single one tested positive influenza.'  Surgeon here. PCR antigen tests came negative enough viral shedding nasopharynx. pathologist friends told none proven COVID autopsies positive post mortem nasopharynx swabs. actually massive headache, really need solid policy COVID autopsies.   Lol swear editors companies must look first drafts say ‘not scary enough, again’ know. company work home policy COVID others called meetings. 

Originally organization going hybrid meeting tonight went restaurant anyone didn’t want could go Zoom home. one wanted go restaurant friend decided would meet virtually. home state, couple weeks ago, 0 flu cases . Nobody town much sniffle see first rodeo. 

Where work temperature checks everyone feel safe. love people spout bullshit response get upvoted, said anything value. Also people anxiety. allergies. No. CDC saying months contagious 10 days first symptom. anyone luck talking people making plans move forward? seems like everyone hesitant make plans return normalcy another couple months (I'm U.S.) live large city upper midwest, liberal, therefore concerned Covid. part time job playing music church, many people trying double improving online content, would like talk metrics plans return in-person activities. every Osterholm, Gottlieb saying decline continue. People need need effective vaccine. 

BTW know 20 year old cross country athlete died covid. healthy 35 year old. 36 year old life support. 

Young healthy guarantee Covid. No, really isn't. hire fucking football coach can't even name three branches government make decisions safety country general. gonna make purchase early last Thanksgiving parent’s rhetoric scared submission.

They’re making think I’m bringing Covid house buy anything don’t approve of. Yeah I’m sorry parents sound unwell point. article LA times said. Read article. Can't wait go swimming 40F here. really. Lockdown says don’t go work. Travel ban says don’t fly Sweden Chile - twice. lucky though, mild discomfort couple days.

I endured quite lot ""You can't have, kids yet it"" ""But can't get twice"". whole article based one physicians opinion. Buried saying it’s something concerned it’s actually less dangerous South African variant. Yeah that’s suggest annual flu shots might realized exclusive. initial email may explicitly said ""this code certain races, intended white essential workers""

Its hard leap someone assume (incorrectly) sign code valid eligible groups.  looks line I'd expect.

So states vaccine shortage...ie infrastructure get shots arms, enough doses.

Some states Infrastructure shortage...ie doses vaccines distribute.

It depends lot solved.

Then, vaccines require 2 shots, seem struggling determine whether start people 1st dose, give someone 2nd dose. Things like that. expect social distancing fall either, areas might still require masking. feel jarring shift NH. NH notice difference normality apart little bit theatrics enter establishment. people still double masking, crossing street improve social distancing neighbors. That's half people making decisions everything power ignore science. Maybe yelling fix shit? yeah flu vaccine effective. Speak yourself. portfolio 10% week haha. doesn’t evade antibodies. I've heard plenty similar stories everywhere, honestly bizarre vaccine rollouts  Jesus christ. would drop people would grab garden supplies, lighting, whatever. say what’s essential? Sure shovel sounds like garden tool. need dig broken plumbing line?

Good point end. doubt people say ""you take vaccine can"" remote countries mind. travel ban, lockdown right? Also Phizer Moderna - Johnson Johnson say 20+ million doses ready March? they're able offer types numbers help lot. Oh man - think first time go place appropriate waiting time getting vaccine... think I’m going cry. able go places without fear catching covid... know fear isn’t entirely rational, I’ve taking pretty extreme precautions, it’s almost like can’t bear hope day - fear disappointed yet another thing yanking proverbial rug us. 

... I’ve cracking pretty bad approach year madness. 404: sanity found. get extent. ambulance driver. trained certain routes.  normal route. think mindset, closest hospital flow facility. Kind like muscle memory. I’ve seen comments often threads think point need accept parents absolutely nuts, like, well within upper 1% paranoid part society.

You either keep living move out, it’s choice, nothing you’ve described comment even remotely normal February 2021.

I hope right though! one worries excessive use cleaning wipes considering: creation super bacteria

There’s evidence alcohol-resistant bacteria becoming significant problem.

[A study showed bacteria collected 2009 resistant alcohol bacteria 2004, study needs peer-reviewed samples

Progress unfortunately moves slowly... like one dead old conservative time! read new contagious deadly California variant evades antibodies. ever go away? someone please make feel better life?? Someone know covid months ago. recently tested positive again. maybe long term complications. But, 10 days, even 50, would person still contagious despite recently testing positive? Read Tulsa World morning 10,000 people got shots Norman, OK yesterday. incredible me. Sure wish got mega POD Tulsa discussed earlier month. Hopefully still coming soon. 

I'm feeling great world getting back normal lately. I'm much ease two months ago. another two months, feel like basically over. Rent based demand people pay specific area.

Which people actually worried gods that's massive trade-off given AZ vaccine stored fridge, whereas Pfiezer vaccine must stored around -60, making transportation / delivery expensive difficult, especially poorer / hotter countries.

And why, fucking fuck, would care that?  Maybe tell COVID racism bad since killing Black Hispanic people disproportionately since simple Read recent research. posted here. certainly impact plumbing systems people started flushing gazillions toilet March.  auntie Jen pretty invasive. went closet fridge looking expired food. 

It's quickly either way, videos people getting it, helped get fear. Crazy good hygiene consideration others accomplish. better thr end going fucking work sick. state I’m last group, sometimes “May Beyond”. us, doses aren’t much issue much lack people actually administer vaccine.  garbage person blocked. cover problem, response. one knew hell happening, especially Federal government really assisting.

You’re confusing respirator ventilator. relate this. I've working full time site whole pandemic, April last year realized afraid all. I'm waiting everyone catch mindset.

If vaccines help get there, fine, working like normal entire time, seen point getting personally. know people using claim Covid numbers inflated counting influenza Covid. I'm trying open debate hole, Eminem goat rap. least. Thats option though. options get less effective vaccine risk life long health, wait get effective vaccine protected.   general public knew Federal government known since December 2019. pandemic could easily stopped fewer 1000 American deaths, 500,000. still trashed economy. Definitely. think evidence scientific studies coming time made announcement. head picture little big compared tonhin hands? Cases irrelevant statistic truly bizarre aggressively people latched onto it. two things actually matter many people ending hospitals many people dying. headline reason accuse prognosticating doom. ""The Devil already here"" ass. don’t really get you’re suggesting/implying. explain? idea people get cash it’s “okay” close again? 

If that’s you’re saying, no. cases start trend back up, I’m sure states will—for better worse—close again. 

If I’m interpreting comment correctly, you’re talking utter nonsense. Absolutely, though completely. Probably Seriously, nobody ever expected 100% immunity. know that, least short term, reinfection uncommon. That's matters.  SARS-CoV-2 better start sweating. fucking cost? Car accident deaths, cancer deaths, cardiovascular deaths avoidable. COST?????? Everyone know it, got it, described like normal flu. experience. manage team 12 employees, employees contacted covid well, additional sick days taken. open honest team. one experienced ""long term effects"" spoken People need need effective vaccine.

But importantly need rather next week. Hopefully Friday afternoon like ""You good? good?"" "" Yeah I'm cool are"" ""Me too"" ""Ok cool cool"" ""Welp see y'all later""   Wow. considering difficult production mRNA expected problem. Maybe fill liter bottles allow countries refill themself? mom received vaccine February 14th. found doses given 2/15 site deemed ineffective, stored properly. sure vaccine effective? said arm felt little sore day after.

Tried post article clarity, bot keeps removing it. appears unique vaccination site mom received it, occurred 2/15, happening one day us bit concerned. Must nice right time Huh? I’m afraid dying vaccine. 

I’m concerned getting lesser quality vaccine catching mild moderate case Covid long term lingering effects. 

I’d rather keep isolating wait MRNA vaccine, feel protects better feel safe enough around others return normalcy. way, also learned that, compared traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccines actually generate stronger type immunity: stimulate immune system make antibodies immune system killer cells — double strike virus” that’s mind control allow installation bill gates microchips get MS-Vax-10 Public health tracking one Colorado, CDPHE discovered three dozen cases since started looking beginning February. FWIW we've found twice many cases U.K. variant, we're much genome testing, frankly. tried sign Walgreens website, option remotely applied me. harm we’ve hearing year already. sensational doesn’t mean effective. Mostly means clicks. case missed it, Michael Osterholm claiming one coming within next weeks. 1 ever 800,000 file vaccine damages think reach stage soon. Israel going show us within 1 month quickly expect deaths drop.

Also production going world. spot on. US sure could done better, cats bag virus there’s really going back.  similar western countries boat. There’s really scenario country like US would unscathed like, say, New Zealand (great leadership, isolated island helps... see: Hawaii). 

Overall I’d say poorly, it’s much nuanced. basically boils piss poor job protecting vulnerable (the 70+ population).  Last spring didn’t know much. last summer dialogue turned toward protect folks (e.g. daily testing workers, N95s residents, etc., along dining restaurants certain age things like that). Instead focused Karen Whole Foods mask nose, scheme things least problems terms preventing death. saw Bonnaroo. pretty good. I'm super fan might've blown away. Plus 2 headliners phenomenal fair. Declarative statements like ""Covid new flu"" provide citation studies indicating such. contradict assertion ""Odds are"" next sentence. Sorry pedantic, unless want provide data rephrase indicate personal prediction.

From perspective, many unknowns factors make statement, particularly regards long current vaccines remain effective, effectiveness future mutations.

I'll provide alternate possibility: mRNA vaccine production lines quickly modified target new variants, effective global distribution vaccine could wipe virus entirely. Severe disease important.

Yes, people get vaccinated asap. collective individual advantages getting vaccine dwarf advantages waiting mRNA-vaccine. want protected possible.

To protected possible collectively need everybody get vaccinated. reputable expert argues otherwise. even tragedy commons-like situation waiting Pfizer beneficial individual People spend money buy car that's safer too. Shocking know. take whatever car offered them. matter safe is, safer walking highway without car!

This way comparable buying safe car. buy safe car choice end day. choice like buying safe car, people absolutely opt Pfizer. argument that. circumstances much different. dealing virus spreading wildly across globe, mutating does, stopped soon can. can't stop we're going picky vaccines.

Be glad missed it. [New Zealand saw near elimination influenza covid flu year. Shhh say 1.5 million plastic canisters thrown away daily. Great stuff hope recycling! Thanks clarification. much detail it, although knew coronavirus one sort cold one. What’s bullshit? fact 95% isn’t 100%? pandemic sure hell scared ever renting property.

The thought tenant can't kick 6+ months unpaid rent terrifying me. point, I'm mercy choose do. best interest leave never pay rent, so, pray decide take/sell/trash everything building. Best case likely foot bill cleaning apartment eat 6 month loss rent. Worst case almost limitless.

""What want us do, kick people street?"" want allow landlords enforce contracts pandemic, fine. someone footing bill case, rather telling landlords eat loss. going force rents everywhere go end, risk renting property increased dramatically now. Without experienced science viruses sounds like would expect. month ago eternity terms knowledge efficacy single dose. month ago knew basically nothing single dose delayed 8-12 weeks, significant amount data, UK people got single dose US (due bad reaction reason). Fauci, asked 3 weeks ago, said would follow data US data justify extending doses farther... mean we'll never data. 

also, people worried PR, still give high risk people normal dose schedule set aside percentage doses toward people volunteer delay 2nd dose. make optional. nearly 5000 deaths involved flu/ pneumonia week 5 idea got J&amp;J didn’t “fuck up” baby powder Tylenol, vaccine experimental.

So... parts?

And yes, I’m familiar references, please don’t think hold secret knowledge this. Let’s pretend fauci stupid. knows he’s talking about. He’s bad communicating, understanding American people. get board that. beat flu mask year. suggest cutting Facebook life least practice.

Highly recommend. people, European Brazilians? No. appetite increasing restrictions case counts go down. also acknowledge republican politicians using vocal minority example everyone thinks used excuse stay open / cover cases / test / contact tracing income tax states would go bankrupt longer states stayed closed. everyone uses numbers prove lockdowns don’t work uses deaths. look covid cases per million state, first 12 states lowest covid case rates real lock downs mask mandates, 15 worst 17 case rates didn’t real lock downs.

Those states benefited learned early deaths NY, NJ, MA, CT - great, using deaths metric prove case lockdowns don’t stop spread backwards. adjust amount mutations different influenza strains accumulate ""off season"" hemisphere comes back? irrational pay 4000 month 400 sq feet suits sit empty? irrational commute hour half broken transit system can’t afford live closer minimum wage job Manhattan? irrational 45 live 2 roommates still pay 1000 month rent? It’s almost if.... 

*checks notes* 

...mask mandates enforcing restrictions well streamlining vaccinations flu covid ~WORKKK~ crazy one test hospital (needed emergency surgery) brain punctured two others swabbed nose lot people frequent Twitter dumbest, gullible people world. surprise don’t even mention majority population vaccinated summer.   Yep! That's estimate. 10% people herpes, example, estimate group 100 people, 10 herpes. Knowing info group changes estimate, estimate nonetheless. 

You're totally right medical workers likely changes number, random guess – there's probably accurate calculation, estimates work! :D appreciate situation dog, honestly sounds like control rather actual pandemic concern they're gonna get pissed buying something mail. previously stated addressing bottleneck production. don’t medical trials giving friends saying “see they’re fine”...must ok. 

There several medical reports people unwell months contracting COVID. Blood clots damaged lungs showing people mild cases. people still haven’t recovered sense taste/smell many months. 

Plus don’t get vaccinated risk catching spreading someone vulnerable population. 

If us get vaccinated get back normal life. times like wish everyone, every single country better jobs collecting samples sequencing. necessarily. make (numbers completely made up) 10 doses per minute doesn’t matter whether put one 10 doses bottle two 5 doses bottles. still made 10 doses.

I guess means either bottling speed bottles supply limiting factors?  that’s every single vaccine maker pay billions damages cant prove it? ugh. know people, use hand sanitizer dont touch face, could save... like.... 1 billion canisters clorox wipes waste per day. lol, no. $20-70.  know sure lol. never touch handles! Severe disease important. long term effects. minor. serious issues. 

Don't forget death rate Covid incredibly low itself. 

I want protected possible. idea people acting like thats strange. People spend money buy car that's safer too. Shocking know. take whatever car offered them. matter safe is, safer walking highway without car! disingenuous argument equating optional leisure activity participating society. people world choice contact people otherwise would starve, lose house, unable feed kids, etc.

If genuinely belief speaking privileged position. that's generous reading it, would ""fuck you, got mine"". get one Target give money spend Target. pandemic expected last 29393 months. Wear masks, stay safe, socially distance. even bothering read articles anymore. I’ll continue wear mask I’m social distance it’s turn get vaccinated. much else worrying tiresome. got flu covid time year! know people also happened to. possible there's flu England? want bunch people street pandemic? 
You know NYC landlord eligible loans experience hardship New York Forward Loan There's risk acquiring disease there's risk severe disease. Older people comorbidities fall second group, prioritized. Next line essential workers, gen pop. checked phases state? ""This plan. Come like it, come don't. judge you, judge me. year this, trust make decisions long respect mine."" - wedding mantra. Biden administration said weeks ago (maybe month?) using two doses, studies Moderna Pfizer established. think people year got it... hope. agreement not, specifically states effectively subservient agreements waives right sue.

No, part article (and agreement) refers competing agreements **made Commission** (or member states) **with third parties**, AZ third parties (such UK). basically means AZ cannot blamed Commission makes agreements contrast EU-AZ one. Oh, missed that, thanks. what's point sharing study's results media publishing study itself? depends are, yes.

There still occasional anecdotes people 65+ waiting, tell 65+ family members friends vaccinated. felt like leper HFM. awful. Well point, towards *end* pandemic, vaccinations metric matters. US everyone wants vaccine immunized within months, largely back normal summer. He’d better reasonable don’t want “you travel! Nothing else!” There's need baseless, speculative conspiracy theories.[The CDC tracks publishes, weekly every flu season, results lab tests influenza suspected continued testing influenza year [like every time last year, 19% 823k flu tests positive. year, 0.2% 632k tests. Hey bought 400 million doses. Could actually send along us? 

Thanks.
Canada talking friends last week hosting pool party closer end summer everyone's birthdays we've missed last year, obviously saying timing could change depending vaccines. met ""well, know safe be"" pretty much everyone. We're talking 6-7 months now, still met hesitation.

Meanwhile husband actively planning summer trip year... way test hypothesis would look flu rates countries strict anti-COVID measures zero COVID cases, like New Zealand Australia.  probably skeptical first bet. experience oven cleaner, actually. Long hand sanitizer, wipes, paper towels, toilet paper, etc stock, moved apartment needed deep clean oven, drive 4 stores find one stock. obvious doses per bottle equates vaccinations? don’t insurance I’m pretty sure government covers cases. almost there, remove part color are. Better stay silent let people assume fool open mouth remove doubt. L enough shots everyone wants one summer. 65 year olds going suddenly die old age then. I'm young generally think COVID measures developed bias favor helping old expense young, zero problem age based prioritization vaccine. suggesting anything. There's mixed lab studies Pfizer SA-variant. studies show dramatically reduced response vitro. good real life data, know. lab studies show higher antibody response AZ SA compared Pfizer/Biontech, real life data appears show AZ good preventing mild/moderate disease SA-variant. would put Pfizer? - again, one speculate, could bad. 

With I'm trying say - know - that's gonna change comparative studies real life data. many unknowns, like long efficacy lasts, quickly declines etc. blindly say mRNA-vaccines better one number, defined exactly trials, make much sense.

What makes sense get first approved one offered.

If turns later, one working strain, one says can't get another one later (except mixing AZ J&amp;J may reduce others immune respons vector, that's different story). still noon. plenty time say something stupid. I'm upstate. end last summer virtually normal (except masks). County cases day around 10. truly believe summer vaccines natural immunity pandemic pretty much behind us.  Great! also cost double/triple- used to. point comes philosophy here- much government responsible for? coworkers case completely ignoring NY restrictions quarantining travel, government trying make act responsibly. Would prefer full-out police state enforce things like that? point, people need responsible making decisions. Unfortunately, many people seem capable that, I'd rather live stupidity let government control everything. Yep. Maybe even compared Pfizer. Pfizer slow, people would've died impact business. However, J&amp;J slow, everyone US get vaccine Moderna Pfizer instead. nod good wink blind bat. anti vax whole. vaccine messaging horrible right now. full tons people saying vaccine actually change anything. important thing right getting many people vaccinated possible. people continuing say things like ""vaccines stop getting spreading Covid, make less sick"" That's true, see everywhere. Singapore vaccine rollout pretty orderly. eligible get mail appointment date according date birth. completed healthcare workers, shipping industry airline industry, moving elderly Private hire drivers (ie versions Uber/Lyft).

I’m sure would USA since guys don’t centralised ID system everyone. United States, wanna take real close look places like California Florida next couple days.

They major snowstorms last week screw reporting. continue see similar week-over-week drops we've seeing since mid-January, assume recovery phase continuing reporting artifacts areas. 

If show smaller drops we're used to, might seeing earliest signs upward pressure transmission rates, either B117 loosening behavior news bad. 


I think probably holiday/snowstorms creating data artifact, important come ways differentiate hypotheses advance rather wait data happens come reason change priors. news, water wet. Yep. guys vaccinate people *one day* country done, total, since approving Pfizer Moderna months ago, FFS. Good. Let’s retire word “Twindemic” we’re it. experts freaking last fall. Yet BBC bootlicking Brussels. three months later England MILES ahead everyone Europe. EMA authorisatiin slow tragically bad negotiations made shit system worse. Flu eradicated, then? anyone need worry next year? say reporting flu cases covid cases, since they’re thing, that’s there’s flu cases reported.

Obviously, don’t agree that, since it’s
a moronic train thought, I’ve heard people say.  CDC seems updated tracker today option show rates based 18+ population. think data 'proves vaccine ineffective' either looking different data different interpretation 'proves'. ""Et tu, virus?""

-Flu Yes is. fact think traditionalist Catholicism comparable shows don’t really understand Hasidic Judaism. 

There anti vaxxers group reasons mentioned comment, tend antivax. minority, vax rates 90%. It’s less 97% needed herd immunity, hence breakouts. Yes lots people don’t know that. waiting bad boys come back stock, love cleaning kitchen bathroom. 

The really bizarre shortage pandemic, least, oven cleaner. can’t find anywhere. Individual cases like translate probabilities population level. Variance factors like viral load, shedding, viral variant, etc. make huge difference transmissibility. example particularly transmissible variant peak infectiousness person keeps sneezing accumulating virus mucus membranes exceptionally infectious. Whereas less transmissible variant early late stages infection person mostly shedding digestively relatively uninfectious. much ""the"" agreement. still new agreements made. date agreement, own, tell fast government moved. *Its South African/UK/Brazil hybrid covid, steel chair!* That’s manhattan, look LIC everywhere else happening last 10 years. Even back water area Queens empty developments sitting around. priorities truly fucked we’re going keep defending bullshit hoarding parking funds, people backbone economy forced farther farther along train lines. thanks 5 examples Manhattan, really puts things perspective, great gob! Fire Fauci new cases lower peak summer. trending sharply downward. Germany covid tests got combo flu corona tests automatically. One contracts....like said dont hand £80m without anything written first.

Yep EU handed cash August, May August. Thats UK started things. Thanks reassurance! flu. Tu.  know plenty healthy people plan wear masks going forward. much adherence.. doctor, grocery store, anytime feeling ill.  care much every single person know caught basically bad cold days. one lingering loss smell. That's really biggest reason want it.

I think vaccine news, though... point might well stay cautious wait vaccine. long estimates correct. Something extraordinary happening, vaccination

I don’t think there’s need “get back boomers” couple months away younger people getting vaccinated like everyone catches every year. could go years without actually exposed flu. seems like pointless fearmongering.   Right? remember reading back late spring subways aren’t major spread factor. 

Public health experts: don’t talk strangers subway

NYC: WISH GRANTED!  mean could confused flu symptoms covid No. can't. blocked non subscribers. see anyone cares amount doses vial. matters total output doses. produce way? I've noticed work (an assisted-living / LTC facility) - we've dozen residents pass away since lockdowns started. 90s bedbound years severe chronic conditions end stage. honestly think real tragedy passed away 90s, spent last year time earth alone separated families visitors allowed since last March. confirm. 4 FEMA mass vaccination centers opening Florida,

But number one see Germany well, roughly. That's makes really good vaccine compliance necessary. 55 still capable flooding hospitals.  People naturally think terms ""Made XYZ"" forget almost nothing made one place anymore. pretty much completely forget notion consider inputs.  COVID resume lmao love it’s also accurate seems lot recycled material getting slopped together repackaged ""new information"" recently.

Still 20-minute wait table. stepdad also waited almost hour another restaurant week two leaving see else could get seat. Plus people camping tables get in, making wait times even longer. agree know months unfold...still, even 2000 times reinfections officially recorded...it would still result 99% immunity rate. made day. Good her! I’m you. deaths hospitalizations I’ve poked I’m living life. I’ll comply whatever rules events businesses ass going thinking twice anymore it. I’m young poked near end anyways. sir speculate data seems fishy hell dummy believe big glowy box tells you!   many covid cases misdiagnosed I’m curious. find hard believe it’s zero. Wow, thanks much taking time explaining! really interesting read (though obviously make frustrated you). 

So many things familiar (I'm Israel) - incompetence, flip flopping measures based popularity measures don’t even make sense... 

I guess one silver lining infection rate must level population immunity point – one 10 already tested positive. 

Fingered crossed guys better leadership easier times. putting renter. said I'd thing.

They also absolutely understand energy efficiency 100 years ago...

They also made sound like intentionally left smaller radiator on, turn off. sounds good, employers actually either keeping wages stagnant, reducing increased competition fewer jobs. spent lot time networking groups LinkedIn, working professional two masters, it’s simple make sound. 

Low corporate taxes, along higher healthcare costs payroll taxes encourage offshoring jobs, growth low-labor industries like tech, drive shifting costs benefits employer employee. Please provide better index.  absolutely agree. can't wait roll sleave whether it'll mRNA, AZ EMA approved vaccines. Reddit, hunches get upvotes thinking well. usually avoid colds year round. Normally might get ill two three days year nobody house illness since January last year. ace dunno, two months short time, anyways, sooner better. i'd even get sputnik i'll tell (impossible obvious political reasons)  title saying first dose, assume mean. Norway, similar size population get similar allotment, also assume people one dose either June July depending supply. think risk groups done, least see normal summer last year. kids transmit flu far adults. Everytime speak adult got flu, likely place kids got it. Adults get right top play around adults they're sick, unlike kids. get back school without masks, expect flu numbers go back normal.  well, people's fault conservative government bungled response, again, surely happy going better them?

What happy government that's standing top thousands deaths allowing vaccines exported, try prove point Brexit best choice? hear AZ vaccine refused many Europe due perception inferior? Perhaps better stay Britain they'll get used...

Oh worry not, need stop listening propaganda. Here's manufacturers EU said two factories producing AstraZeneca’s vaccine Britain supply EU contract company. **AstraZeneca said British government prevented exports vaccine** citing supply British government declined say whether contract AstraZeneca gives priority British central role played EU international supply vaccines, bloc’s decision register vaccine exports caused global came **AstraZeneca Plc announced large delivery cuts EU, told EU officials could ship doses factories Britain** obligations contract British government, EU officials told Reuters said export ban place COVID-19 vaccines, repeatedly declined comment whether contract AstraZeneca prevents shipment doses times, right? saying is, instead starting groups increased fatality rates virus, like elderly, start essential workers, get virus might pass people likely die vaccinated yet... like elderly?

I get mean, stuff modeled over, epidemiologists getting lots work days they've figured mortality negative outcomes minimized protect old folks first. decide things differently, we've decided we're smarter epidemiologists must bad modeling. we've decided economy important stopping loss life. becomes much complicated conversation.

In area, health care workers vaccinated, old folks done soon, essential workers next line. relief bill every magnitude large. People like really short-sighted view forced inflation guise helping people. bloated stim bill definition cutting nose despite seemed ignore one serious concerns. can't allow cases start growing raises risk mutation potential viral escape. 

This virus significantly deadly 65. go growing cases matter nearly much individuals younger 65. zero point shutting distancing one second longer 65 either gotten vaccine opportunity vaccinate. choose vaccinate THEM. 

We going continue socially distance people vaccinate. Maybe make covid vaccines pets too, cats get coronavirus 🤔 read EU help set-up costs research. think Biontech (don't remember much), maybe others too.

Of course throw caution wind, that's said ""almost behind usx instead ""completely behind us.""

I acknowledge vaccines working without going full blown ""don't give shit"" mode, like acknowledge viral mutation reality something keep eye without going full blown ""this never going end"" mode.

The virus going mutate. resurgences, outbreaks, things nature. pandemic going end tomorrow month now.

But technology keep bay enough start returning normalcy enough people vaccinated.

If drive infections deaths sub-flu levels, get outbreak new ""strain,"" right word, implies almost entirely separate virus, that's happening observable way, booster shot like flu.

It’s hard wear mask shopping work. long supposed put lives hold ""safety society?"" Gut reaction majority preppers still think covid was/is hoax. didn’t know AZ still applying America. 

A lot people American want high-efficacy vaccine, America purchased enough everyone *wants* one it, AZ shipping counties desperately need it? 

Is related manufacturing problem? infinite number profession. That's besides point. point every person inherent value. Becoming educated increase inherent societal value. get special treatment simply rich enough go college.  whole notion ""you spread covid much even fully vaccinated person"" wildly unscientific makes angry.

Its usually pretty easy beat strawmen. mean, call strawman? Extra years healthy life, similar long term effects using soap.  age, would forego vaccine let less vulnerable get first? you’re prying. It’s business. Interesting shoving everything bag, typical countries, right? like flu cases getting treated covid cases. mythical land called Australia new cases Covid19 long time. people started get restless started flu like symptoms. jumped cars headed nearest drive thru testing clinic. testing numbers gone roof week NSW. AZ vaccine get FDA approval would pretty damning signal though, greatly strengthen skepticism vaccine. don’t you? last statement makes seem like don’t.  AZ US production set up, ""shipped"", they're manufactured domestically. Unless proof saying otherwise... That’s dream, reality societal collapse wage gap grows grows. Companies like Amazon go right poor performing high schools shelters recruit workers. go really desperate people luck. worked contractors, benefits, paid leave, us hauling bags packages backs Manhattan, sometimes 80 pounds, even allowing us collect cash tips (all tips went Amazon electronically.) every day dispatcher mantra, least job, you’re late delivery subway messed up, slipped ice, person didn’t open door time, say good bye opportunity continue employment. Look there’s long pretend people choices, it’s pure exploitation. apply biggest colonial empires too?  simplest thing stay home sick. concerts give refunds sick people feel obligated come. let people obviously sick. maybe wait bit concert give grandma hug. probably beneficial road Covid recovery, UK chip-in help Spain/Italy/Greece/France/etc.

that's interesting point. I'm sure Germans love asked pay Europe's recovery. USA getting vaccine made 3 European plants? That’s horrible! build profitable, that's people want. People willing pay stupid prices monstrosities debt cheap thanks historically high interest rates. Income inequality accelerating wealthy leverage capital take cheap debt ride top wave asset inflation wage slaves get left behind. true, Trump signed executive order December since January Biden revoked it.

UK interesting case, decided possibly slow deliveries cost others receiving vaccine first. Yeah, clearly capable reasonable discussion this. Viral escape bad everyone, obviously understand what's implied there. Indeed. 

I haven’t heard peep US handing 400M Sanofil/Merck vaccine production efforts fail. whole strategy make rain manufacturers knowing money going go waste. Devil's Hurricane Already Here! - LA Times, probably. There’s good evidence vaccines stop contagious. isn’t shows still be… conjecture. Ah bad knew somewhere area EU couldn’t find it. open beginning wanted do.

I fully agree, Trump signed executive order prioritising deliveries US population December 7th already! time, countries still order vaccines, course. really think May everyone wants one one? Ya. already. Thanks. Skepticism rules. There's difference skeptical asking questions vs leading people misinformation. remove tons comments thread every day. ban dozens people every day. suggestion shut thread considered option, think would rob lots people opportunity ask legitimate questions. Germany also. get contagious 5-7 days showed symptoms, right? went week getting tested. Unless never leave home, chances got someone infected. probably know person hid symptoms like telling anyone sick. get know. know intentionally trying spread virus. point.

Sure workers care patients hospitals risk pointed hospitals could get overrun enough staff. moral judgement HCWs valuable others, reality jobs. 

Many HCWs given priority though. know several young HCWs either work home work low risk settings, hospital administrators example given vaccine 67 year olds still go work. Nope, it’s based science. It’s mask man, it’s big deal. please stop wasting vaccine elderly?

So telling want elders, high-risk folks age group, want suffer? Even young peoples' grandparents? wrote article based online survey 177 people..... quoting rise prejudice covid 19, I'm talking CPI? apologize, interview. say movie theaters less month ago (see mentioned halfway down). mentioned article referenced top-level comment, read quickly thought made comment movie theaters today too. don’t “enjoy making shit up.” LOL J&amp;J producing 6 facilities 3 US 3 Europe. welcome - certainly object.

People idea vaccines ranking vaccines never fail amaze Mask wearing measure now? distinct difference stating contract vaccines produced country must given country first realising cocked subsequently taking control vaccines bought people. 

The difference clear obvious everyone genuinely brainwashed???? actually believe flu went away? say oh covid woll never go away it’s fucking thing flu. article complete BS lmao infectious diseases disappear THATS ENTIRE POINT SUB. think pushback probably people assuming saying ""hey let's shit run everyone it'll work out, minus million people so""

I can't comment USA, never been, right me, EU joke, bad year year Covid. Maybe, it’s based paranoid conjecture, science. go ahead add non-factual whole bullet list. idea making large-scale deals (big enough companies can't actually deliver them) companies somehow ""betting"" one tiresome.   real.

France invested Sanofi, actually screwed-up pushed vaccine back 2021. Germany invested Biontech, could guarantee doses themselves/EU EU negotiating seperately took forever due struggling reach agreement member states.

They also ship doses fairly due logistics. France Germany receiving doses countries, per capita.

We'll see happens next, defending EU time, fierce defender EU Brexit, crisis proving wrong. willfully ignorant actual situation. UK US made abundantly clear start policies were, changed nothing regards export controls. Whenever EU proposed threat political play, different situation. also laughable consider tha fact almost latin ametica USA orchestraded coups. hard tohave stable political acene someone fucks constantly.

FLU DODNT GO AWAY JUDT ARENT COUNTING. pretty basic stuff. top current two pairs?  I'm skeptical would make much difference wearing masks business settings otherwise social distancing. someone wearing mask shopping hanging inside friends family, going bars restaurants, attending concerts large events, children attending school in-person, think they're reducing risk getting flu much. point COVID-19 death infection rate similar ""normal"" flu season.

Couldn't argue less? flu shot significantly less effective COVID vaccines think COVID vaccination rates (meaning people willing get) going much higher. people competing rental properties responding rental property demand. surplus prospective renters relative units available, prices go (meaning people priced out), attracts developers corporations acquire rental properties rent out, lowers prices. however, also side effect raising housing prices. Everything interlinked.

I understand aiming for, noble, think thought consequences market forces interplay. Income inequality real problem. One main driving factors rental housing price increases *historically* low interest rates available right now. People afford astronomical mortgages practically free borrow obscene amounts cash (if approved). easy debt fuels price war see.

If really want fix things, can't get done piecemealing rules achieve desired outcome. rules likely unintended consequences, probably get sidestepped big money like always do. really, really want fix income inequality, need raise interest rates back reasonable levels people borrow productive, speculative, investments. Unfortunately side effect slowing economic growth, really bad high unemployment recession. cold hard reality real mess decades irresponsible fiscal policy bill coming due. vaccines hot topic media, AZ also gone directions communication, wonder people skeptical. people preference spoken to, actually prefers AZ vaccine “old school” vaccine. course completely anecdotal evidence, situation ground black white would think reading Reddit comments. fair Russian vaccine far away best use mRNA.  I’ve noticed multiple subreddits downvoting responding people say “hey won’t vaccinated January soonest” stuff like that. 

Ok folks. Guess won’t disappointed time comes! 

A lot people really cynical right now- think we’re another year without things loosening going back normal all. wearing mask on, matter crazy Republicans try pitch.  much convenient getting sick every year, put makeup, fake-smile neighbors co-workers, generally like feeling safety give me. Hopefully others agreement follow suit, even government wise enough make permanent mandate. mean could admit maybe wearing masks along (when sick). honestly, wearing mask never crossed mind (before covid).

I wonder many people regretted washing hands (knowing may caused many deaths) discovered washing hands prevents transmission.

Or take new-found knowledge apply future. vaccine made Janssen? Source. Almost every vegetable cheap, farmers would probably start growing whatever item demand stop pastures barns cows. 

I never EVER understand people say can’t afford eat healthy, like dude know havnt even looked. takes little time cook up. ""This even final form"" - u/tendie-dildo big news, I'm fairly sure calls export ban kind restrictions realistic ever. rightly EU. capitalism?

Europe worried vaccines shipped packaging, batches destined Europe blocked export ban.

That would extremely shitty. comes waves: People listen interviews doctors virologists, stop partying. get tired it, convince okay, listen people like you. people know get seriously ill, lasting issues. stop partying again.

It's tiresome, quote movie. Adding gives ~ 46-66 + days vaccine death reported. Well, 500,000 deaths.... Pfizderna Johnson bat name? yet within Australia NZ closed borders massively popular. right minds wants travel moment? Perhaps spent less time snarky could find reason number deliveries much lower. Take certificate wherever travel.  Unless symptoms specific COVID like loss taste sense smell

My Mom sister got Covid last July (8 months ago), loss taste still messed up. Coffee example taste like another example garlic tastes weird them.  get understand Sweden then. 

I'm arguing anyone necessarily take anything anywhere. anything, data shows mitigations restrictions imposed (as policy) correlate little outcome.

Perhaps takeaway people act matters, restrictions say much (i.e. strict legal restrictions people follow them, different loose restrictions people adhere to). Sweden known pretty ""loose"" restrictions, pretty good adherence. Sweden can't really compared every country world 

It's fair compare anywhere anywhere course. one needs careful conclusions. comparisons means argue ""x works better y"" ""country z better country q"". Circumstances vary. maybe realize many people travel daily get work, many fill public transports otherwise way go work. 

Not sure arguing here. What's response to? seem arguing something really even debated here... new restrictions limit spread mutations. (primarily British variant) spreading worryingly fast certain areas. better policy restrictions livelihoods destroyed fir reason benefit tried explain this, supporting answer link article source apparently cannot even name. got automatic removal notice. tried quote message quoting also auto-removed. mix scientific illiteracy good old fashioned vaccine nationalism. Vaccinated people still contract virus, thus spread unvaccinated people.

The value vaccine becomes much, much harder do. Therefor, enough people received vaccination, chance spread vaccinated people essentially disappears.

Since children cannot vaccinated yet, demographic still risk.

The timeline fairly well communicated past year, we’ve lucky stay track fairly well. know 50 people counting job Facebook easily. Literally followed right wing playbooks Trump, herd immunity regardless bloodletting could longer excuse inaction. followed Trump's example, lacked degree steadfast ineptitude. half store gotten girlfriend dad nobody long lasting effects. whooped dads ass though drives lockdowncels mad. constitution limits stay-at-home orders restricting freedom movement, closing stores like. Changing constitution possible least 2022 requires passed two parliaments election between.

What done normal, temporary law passed gives government authority. new authority mainly restricting closing businesses, also things like limiting private gatherings fines individuals IIRC.

There amendments constiution. European countries far density populated. E484K (South Africa) again. Pfizer Moderna vaccines still effective it. variant hype. Yup
It's Brexit
The EU desperate Brexit MUST seen disaster
So UK's invented AZ Vax simply 'rubbished'. flak sweden got 'not lockdown' last spring relation society shutdowns stay-at-home orders done many European countries, China. would imply stocking excess doses cant use right now, isn’t case.

US stocking doses ingredients make dosis. 

It called export ban. *Upvotes help give OP another email* far understand simply trials didnt include people 65. Thats all.

Technically correct. Duh. export ban. Omg that’s ok, broke her. I’d say one full headlight one slightly dim headlight. Still pretty damn good come don’t know dozen long Covid patients then? call bullshit. mean heard news man 60 day hospital stay covid got landed million dollar bill too. sure money spend healthcare actually going. Tax , insurance bills included 🤔 Dallas today around 350 cases today; 200s shit storm. 2200 January. Big pharma big miracle win humanity... 

Who would’ve thought.... easy draw conclusions it. interesting see figures month Oxford/AZ data.

The bits interesting though first two readings (7-13 14-20 days). much comparable numbers seem show Oxford/AZ vaccine gets running quickly Biontec/Pfizer one.

Both sets numbers brilliant really good sign.  they’ll say 1 year anniversary “14 days slow spread” worried long COVID? clear, probably Pfizer Moderna.

Are worried transmission baby can't wear mask, isolate meaningfully get vaccinated? clear, probably Pfizer Moderna. There's ways healing body besides drugs (and fun drugs either) don’t understand point you’re trying make. believe Covid? saying fuck it, it’s important go outside people die? claims based on...? Perhaps stamp foot bit more, keep pretending delivery *guarantees* AZ-EU contract, able change history. “Gottlieb says something positive once” like vietnam example can't use ""duh easy cos island"" excuse people using explain Taiwan, NZ, Singapore's abnormally great performance vs covid unity behavioral modification selfish assholes general trick countries. People working home little zero risk covid exposure weaseling way vaccines essential workers wait, keep delivering groceries etc. It’s fucked metric. clearest sign yet class race determine suffers covid doesn’t. don’t think you’re reading article right. 
It shows US reaching herd immunity November included immunity vaccines alone, completely discard immunity recovered virus. ‘Vaccine-only’ herd immunity pointless consideration know recovering virus confers immunity.

Additionally, even looked vaccine-only herd immunity, article suggests would take November vaccine administration didn’t increase current rate 1.7 million per day. 3 million per day scenario, article suggests would reach vaccine-only herd immunity July.

Countries manage high case numbers adverse impact several months come. slowly increasing population immunity evolutionary selection pressure virus, emergence new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue, potentially leading contagious variants, perhaps even variants existing vaccines less effective. variants could quickly exacerbate crisis, long enough people vaccinated. Cool. explain simultaneous plummeting hospitalizations. don’t watch lot news coverage, less COVID doom, found doom report. live Canada definitely full lockdown. Depends live Cali. Rural cal, one gives shit. No. point butthurt something said last year see right.

Do patients ever fail disclose actual facts health status, either inadvertently otherwise. vaccine get today need effective long term, also effective new variants continue emerge years. 

This incorrect, assumes shot get April one we'll ever get. Take get stop pandemic ASAP. take second vaccine later year following years tuned dominant variant time. Maybe start, eh?

Corona finished. mass casualties UK say nothing effectiveness quarantine distancing things instituted *as result* mass casualties year still people recognizing problem mortality rate, infection healthcare toll. hospitals get overloaded deaths rise, sources, like blindy point .2% ignore many people died treatable cancers, heart conditions God knows many things simply get treated properly. uneducated: get wrong? Ok. Let us agree idea whether patient saw covid unless told you.

Do patients ever lie? Nice I’m glad got multivitamins. probably start taking those. reality referring one two weeks flatten curve? one vaccinations would end mask social distancing one today? Viruses considerably smaller holes every type mask there's reason people work labs wear full plastic suits breathe purified air tank. security theater something make people feel like they're something. New York Los Angeles Sweden Florida roughly fatality rate. Lockdowns we're never going create zero Covid.

Depends mean ""worse"" locality. general- majority Reddit's audience worst terms deaths, infections, hospitalizations almost certainly behind us. mean go back full normality quite yet we're getting there. Unless something absolutely drastic left field occurs next months- see reason say worst behind us. delusional thing I've read today. Canada successful vaccinating people containing virus. Pretending they're sort success story laughable. They're going one last rich countries vaccinate, utilizing severe restrictions freedom world extremely long periods time. example disaster, success story. feel way measles, smallpox, polio? curious draw line what's needed. British variant - cases heading towards winter UK took hold 1b includes professionals though, not? I'm sure varies per state, implying healthcare.  


For example, 1b category Food Agriculture, veterinarians state qualify for. categories people like 1b, right? Hi. Friendly recommendation. don’t know anything you’re commenting on, don’t.  put boss? could bit cash seem confused. 10% mortality rate would astoundingly unusual, extent it’s completely unrealistic. fact one strains *might be* 30% deadly means goes fraction 1% higher fraction 1%. Eh, always peaks troughs optimism pessimism. Sure, going forward mKe much sense.

Do think lock people hospitalizations deaths low? mean realistically, point got end really going back. would even enforce that. would know?

I imagine there's like 2-3 week delay ""delivery"" arms. Let’s say family member got Pfizer shots, another couple weeks pass. yet vaccinated never COVID, would feel safe visiting indoors home mask wearing?

I’m thinking yes. reasonable? Also, 500 000 people died. Like, congrats getting much needed vaccine doses pretend that's sign success. selfish say prefer almost ""normal"" lives unlike Australia NZ families 500 000 lost mothers, fathers, kids. lockdowns place *because* high death rates.

Fuck Tennessee dropping ball hard great month ago falling apart rate take years vaccinate everyone. r effective gonna decimated May 1 latest. vaccine numbers unbelievably good quantities pumping daily Yeah I'm getting several cases Corona Extra one. US country despite incessant failure care citizens. Unlike Pfizer Moderna's vaccine, means 20,000,000 people getting vaccinated, initiating vaccination process takes five six weeks. doses get distributed March, would virtually guarantee pass third American adults vaccinated March. Maybe even two fifths.

I think majority adults April pretty close certainty point. Coupled third country estimated infection, we're going getting very, close local transmission within months. think ""mostly normal"" summer much question anymore *normal* normal May. bull fucking shit least don’t many antivaxxers Spain, 80% people would take vaccine, despite EU disinformation.

 
Ah that's good positive news then. France knows send unwanted vaccines they've sitting shelf weeks then. idea anyone turning vaccines global pandemic still blows mind. recently impossible find, currently still Limit 1 local costco. That’s great news! admit wait see back November, I’m going get shot soon I’m eligible. One friends younger brothers 11 years old talks lot mental health problems he's suffering pandemic. he's missing kid, he's scalded parents wanting wear masks like friends families do, parents adamantly anti mask / believe kind ""planned pandemic"". grandmother passed away pneumonia testing positive coronavirus family gripes day pneumonia killed covid proof fake. can't imagine kinda mental stress constant gaslighting must taking him. Hell i'm sure thousands kids America gas lit parents this.. mean, grandparents believe coronavirus aunts mother father died 27 days apart. Thankfully I'm late twenties I'm able make mind myself, child I'd confused would incredibly upsetting. See, get sub. virus first came everyone seemed agree needed strict precautions Republican Governors saying otherwise idiots. Fast-forward today number cases several times higher yet people sub want end precautions. people can't cake eat to. Either agree Republicans right whole time keep standing precautions even though sick tired them. can't ways. Well another month supply legit doubling Ask China reacted swiftly aggressively? knew virus came from. waiting cases come they're waiting President Biden say open governor say it. pandemic 3 4 months that's probably long delay must kidding. really believe countries exact testing standards ability United States? tried biotin supplement? noticed years ago take need use hand lotion quite much. Guys! 100m Pfizer Moderna March plus 20m here. That’s 70m freakin people! get butt whooped. love science talking

We live very, different communities. Yeah, back people stockpiling masks well hand sanitizer, toilet paper cleaning supplies (there reason believe stockpiling masks would deny medical workers dealing sick patients PPE)

But also, point, Trump refusing wear mask months following initial outbreak want adversely affect economy present virus threat revolting. Yeah. Right we're probably getting point contagious pandemic flu point interventions we're even limited going big difference Hopefully eventually falls off. know, everyone Canada vaccinated :P That's actually crazy thing think about. ramifications trauma year going last long. good luck! UK seems struck nearly ideal balance killing people failling help economy.

The best policy always zero-COVID. doomed within crucial weeks government decided go ""herd immunity"" keep travel open. West VA dense populated area either....anyone lived near like know this.
They still large amounts hold outs according friend mine Charleston. believe everything read. 85% doses administered. supply constraint varies lot state. states 85% wanting vaccine others low 50 55. however low end already lot people virus think barely scratching surface health problems caused covid restrictions. significant examples:

* Increased obesity, etc., due less exercise.
* Delayed screenings treatments non-covid diseases like cancer heart disease.
* Increases depression substance abuse.
* Increases poverty, leads variety worse health outcomes.
* poorer countries, mass starvation due economic failure. lot countries hell really even knows. Argentina Saudi Arabia report numbers. estimate half million people died TB India 2019, knows many died Covid last year.  
At end day think US line Europe South America. hope would best, happen. Id rather England shops might open April 12. insistance keeping schools open certainly help.  (note: reference last spring, reposting clarify)

In retrospect, would *rotating* reopenings good idea, instead states countries actually reopening? useful compromise now-derided total lockdowns reopening fast?

For example, schools open September 2020 November 2020. switch online instruction extended winter break December January 2021. Meanwhile, keep indoor dining closed August October, re-allow November February outdoor dining becomes unsustainable due decreasing temperatures. also close non-essential retail October Thanksgiving weekend, reopen Black Friday holidays, shutting back January. (These dates examples, need 100% exact, matters they're clear available public.)

All *would been* plotted advance (preferably autumn *2020*) surprises. course, stronger, blanket lockdown would still table case. get effect as, even better than, haphazard reopenings reclosings actually took place. say? IIUC total ""I want now"" plus ""I'm going wait see"" stayed \~80% so. people flocking ""I want now"" camp.  confusing name. probably something. explain lot. Hi Donald. I'm growing increasingly frustrated apparent attitude many state governments vaccines change anything. We've two months now. nursing homes initiated vaccination every resident wants it. mean restrictions go away, hell does? Basically New Jersey free-for-all. get first case hit US shores people socially isolate take precautions. Mask wearing 2022 topic.

Distancing quarantines work, don’t require government explicitly say people stay home. people understand COVID risk without constant barrage information leaders.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  lol. Yes has. Walk around major city you’d never know pandemic going on. similar gerd someone tell see dad yet. We’re fully vaccinated. Like actual f. I’m gonna see dad Post source. Fauci repeatedly stated recently mask wearing COULD continue 2022. sure Times reporter Sweden google translating Swedish sources second hand... 

It sunny beautiful today southern Sweden, winter holidays started. Downtown packed families enjoying day. think relatively vaccinations first shot first week May let's put way. think JNJ going get much here. They're going 20 million doses end March that's probably going many distribute. literally thanking Pfizer saving America Bourla.

I suspect open season occur probably first couple weeks April interesting data... regards variants Europe. recent poll 70% Americans willing get vaccine (including already vaccinated). That's 180M so. J&amp;J able supply 20M doses March (and presumably, then, 20-30M April), could enough vaccines every US adult currently wants one end April. Actual distribution likely take bit longer, course. Tell dude whining America vaccinating Americans. Lol imagine afraid take vaccine. pass J&amp;J vaccine wait mRNA options.... long covid still thing J&amp;J deleted ""mild"" data point study. feels like hiding something give warm fuzzy feeling. Either way J&amp;J fine long give people option. Yeah, in-laws listen podcast repeated gospel us last week. based variants apparently. I'd tell I'd go back condition get fully vaccinated first (2 doses + 3 weeks following second dose). Absolutely would put front lines unprotected 70. feel way never allergies whole life back April cold like symptoms week moderate severe allergies symptoms almost daily. yes everyone is. GLAD ok. Really.

So problem USA without proper contact tracing team place NOBODY say associated deaths. simply way know.

You followed advice hand. advice errant. even today still rampant community spread conservatively cost couple hundred thousand deaths end.

If ran dental surgery Australia - know EXACTLY EVERY case Covid spread. would shut someone visited virus, would ENSURED werent' part spread.

The USA chose this. fault like said fucking idea got where, whether gave anyone, whether needed shut day two. None that.

I wish best but, man! fucking war crime way USA responded. everyone wants vaccinate way work (it might - number reasons), pain continue. First day new cases prior total 7 days ago. probably fair comparison last Monday holiday winter weather. yeah think missing parts cause reinfection. ability cause reinfection fairly modest neutralizing antibody assays I've seen bit problematic compared UK strain. I'd speculate maybe 15 20% reinfection rate that's total speculation. you’re girl big butt it. Deaths detail wider picture? Uh, no, cases detail. no-one got infected died, covid would nothing-burger. 

That said, US death/cases much lower confirm poor socialist healthcare is. think that’s direct costs. agree, isn’t large one would think. America’s commitment defense Europe actually costs lot that. defense umbrella (includes nuclear defense, size shape military deployment) protects Europe North America attack Russians China, included direct NATO costs, shape size military much larger expensive would otherwise need protected US. America’s naval force also larger would need be, US didn’t commitment defense Europe (but also Japan, Taiwan South Korea).

Anyways, US also gains agreements, it’s completely lopsided. allows peace security gives America ability trade more, allows US say global affairs would otherwise have. off-topic now. virus bit protein. neurons, organs, capability thought. Sadly that's true. Doctors paid prevent disease. 125,061 Benghazi's think every huge medical company (including vaccine makers) pay tens millions legal fees every year? think lot different dates.

Anybody wants vaccinated, probably able get vaccine around may. probably lead 50 60% population vaccinated.

Then rest adult population, vaccination turn slow crawl, lack vaccines, people want it. need create measures slowly make much people vaccinate possible. probably go 2022.

The good news need everyone vaccinated start getting back normalcy. 50% population vaccinated, spread severely diminished. anyone cares it, able get shot. state governments burning credibility left right now

Especially leaders sides aisle screwing pooch sneaking parties conferences break restrictions right. think 3M N95 regularly available, want wear NYC Subway. hate getting sick.

But seeing friends socializing, take off. enormous scale illness death wrought coronavirus traced figures grown far beyond familiar yardsticks daily life sometimes difficult get handle news Monday United States recorded 500,000 Covid-19-related deaths year latest way put context compare major causes death 2019, year pandemic took hold deaths times number people died U.S. kind accident, including highway accidents, 2019 eight times number deaths influenza pneumonia 10 times number suicides number deaths strokes, diabetes, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s related causes, combined heart disease (655,381) cancer (599,274) caused full data 2020 available Centers Disease Control Prevention, Covid-19 certainly one leading killers. trying project rank may complicated. large share deaths Covid-19 people medically vulnerable significant health problems like cancer, lung heart disease. number would probably succumbed causes, counted categories, deaths hastened Covid-19.

— Patrick J. Lyons got second dose Thursday last week similar me. first dose definitely felt, second unsure done successfully evening arm hurt move. Vaccinations US going really well. Note US numbers misleading; America much less genomic sequencing European countries, don’t good idea variant prevalences. Makary's theory based argument believes us lot closer herd immunity believed since thinks way explain drop cases seeing right now.

Other experts disagree, believes behavioral changes reason.

What would interesting see get data amount detectable antibodies population looks like. would give better idea whether theory correct not. claim UK far less infections. saying case numbers aren’t reliable. say countries control. said, comment related mine? said, comment related mine? said... Sure.

Why not.

So, topple over? 

Besides countries going broke....When ever lasting lockdowns fail keep people check we're walking around perpetual police state. Pretty much guaranteed unless something drastic happens. could ask question. Ok great. something everyone. we're far enough normal shit go smaller social venues without mask done far I'm concerned

I wait little longer big events long day-to-day life back normal area live in? NY, would eligible pfizer moderna today. days read article saying vaccines ""work all."" wash, rinse, repeat. comment related mine? New studies showing vaccines stopping spread like expect. Anyone says can't see family members vaccinated dunce  also #4 vaccines administered per 100 people.  Unlike Pfizer Moderna's vaccine, means 20,000,000 people getting vaccinated, initiating vaccination process takes five six weeks.

This really true. Pfizer Moderna effective first dose range JJ. issue second dose provide 10x antibody volume response.  way they're going able sell public lockdowns vaccines readily available 

Once toothpaste stomped tube sometime around July cases really plummeted there's putting back Yes right. point, everyone become exposed. Especially restrictions distancing stops. keep pointing widespread California variant California becoming dominant UK variant. Cases still decline, good and, opinion, means immunity holding. Anecdotally aunt, contracted covid (north LA) pretty fit. works hospital day first dose vaccine came symptoms (thought vaccine induced). go away got tested covid. rougher time expected took couple weeks recover. often wonder Cal variant. last month. think they’ve finally run modal verbs lol. addition current commitment US?

But point I’ve also done part live life again. Safely course :). heard may may not, question research. focus vaccine research preventing severe illness, simply know. promising indicators, still.  wouldn’t say great vaccine production distribution. Great would mean would vaccinated now. currency science, citations, guy 200,000. He's one cited researchers alive. 32nd Google Scholar. H-index 222 (222 papers least 222 citations). still kickin?

Well, (220÷2)+20. course Palestinian terrorist arrested terrorism get day court. law. Procedures often drag years. quite we're 100% seeing beginning end massive drop cases happening time we're mass vaccinating keep Truth. Please polite.

I’m meaning antagonistic, providing perspective feel way (and suspect many others do). perspective, approach comes considerable risk own. Funnily enough, Vietnam well.out war them. 10x dead. I’m really willing ask older people sacrifice lives suit personal preferences wear mask I'm asked I'll damned I'm happy it. Fuck masks can't wait burn There's set public conditioned make moral judgements every social encounter fly. Complete moralization everything do, everything around doing. You’re joking right? Nobody wanted kill Kaepernick. I’m pretty sure problem politicizing NFL, could wrong. freedom means free make decisions, even they’re literally life death. land free, government stop saying is.  Never hated unions life. I'm really willing ask children country stay home another year. don’t need vaccinate every adult see vast majority benefit. Old people high-risk ones far likely cause hospital capacity issues and/or die. vaccinated, we’re much better shape. That’s number far “every adult”. 

The point restrictions vaccines isn’t “no one gets sick”, keep health care available it’s needed. thought sense taste least partially tied smell. saying full taste zero smell?

(Hope come combative anything, I'm genuinely curious) Canada done 3 times better US keeping death count down. population whole smaller state California. US control situation see major exporting vaccines Canada. 15% risk severe infection untold risk long covid fine. take economy model vaccine. lose sense smell taste, cognitive function, lung capacity, limbs, overall health. C- good enough! Yes, age breakdown infected skews younger. Since people younger cohorts eligible vaccinated yet, they're going previously infected taking vaccine, least early process. So, there's overlap, previously infected unvaccinated significant group.  Great! One done. Yes. lot people do. know l, must surprising people things don’t, She’s heavily invested gin soaked raisins, 4000 call options. enough retardants buy it’s MOON retirement FUNds baby yeah!!!!!! 😎 can’t move virus high fatality rate certain segments population without actually addressing problem classic combination rum raisin overlooked healing properties. remedy also quite effective substituting raisins ice. feel like Pfizer approved Friday, shipped Saturday Sunday, shots arms Monday Knowing treat patients? New drug cocktails? slamming people ventilators like kid eating candy Halloween? overran hospitals? minds. Especially all-virtual, even hybrid. really think parents indefinite access childcare? kind privilege districts coming from? think kids won’t continue fall terribly behind, socially academically? say teacher. It’s horrific idea hope people push back. Desire different means. huge proportion population spent time unemployed, furloughed, temporary (if lucky) pay cuts. take years many people recover. Even lose lot money may hesitant start overspending. People terrified losing jobs entire economy knife's edge going take years stabilize. 

I know Chicago hotels expecting take 2023 get back 80% pre-pandemic bookings. Large event (conferences, festivals, etc.) organizers information events allowed again. Things planned year, one knows state allow it. Theater, live music, dance, etc. -- one ones reopen. 85% amazing! Let tell why. know virus every year? flu yet one scared it. end getting flu, either cause mild illness severe illness along life-threatening complications (sound familiar?). Flu vaccines 40%-60% effective. Let's honest here, people get vaccine every year. Everyone age 6 months get vaccine annually. Overall, J&amp;J vaccine effective ending pandemic

Edit: flu vaccine available March optimistic lot things feel like stuff spring pretty unrealistic. Even variants mildly contagious, they’re gonna cause small bump. going really quickly - point wish *new* hospitalizations metric would provide better detail regard.

My partner's aunt passed away last week 5 weeks hospital, others hospital weeks. many 56k since January, would love see much new hospitalizations declined. people dont, still vaccinated wear masks. gym today one wearing mask. don’t know still fines wearing mask would stupid Agreed 100’s million. can’t bust vaccine nut consent I’m legitimately rooting you. Thanks  friend Oregon. live TN. compare open restricted lot.

Oregon locked HARD compared TN. Well.. TN really locked all. essentially restrictions. Businesses sometimes recommend wearing mask that's it. 

I going gym (without mask, mind you) since June. closed four five weeks total here. Theaters closed while, opened sometimes around Septembers (though weekends). Indoor dining capacity limits since gyms opened up. 

Outside social distancing signs businesses mask wearing (somewhere around 25% 50%, depending business), pandemic Tennessee. sure correct. 

But I've number ""mystery viruses"" years - ones never even sick enough go doctor completely knocked action days - took months ""feel like myself"" get level stamina back completely shake niggling cough etc. one definitely left chronic sinus issues.

The truth almost viruses kind long-term effects Covid. barely anyone's rader before. thought attack immune system body, infection. That’s understand it. Another dullard doesn’t know asymptomatic means 🙄  won’t get sick. body know handle infection keep hospital. get vaccine, hospitals handle cases come in. Potentially yeah.  sign portal contributes fact I’ve trying sign older relatives list possible within hours drive never get through. know 2 people early 40s one smoker barely qualifies BMI. qualify trying signup system furiously well.  It’s like need step aside stop clogging system.  Imo age point. idea time recommendation approval might be?

They meeting till Friday even instant approval, I'm guessing time shipping getting someone's arm least week, looking 2nd week March best case starting J&amp;J? cousin's wife lost sense smell bare minimum sense taste. tried train kids recognize smell natural gas leak. They're still fairly young, hard say quick they'll notice leak.  “officially approved”? vaccines efficacy something like 65%? hell even wants J&amp;J? expected, like going preventable. 😂 feel you. type 1 diabetic husband relate. Many health problems, kidney, heart, immune compromised. He’s 50. He’a diabetic since childhood. 40+ years takes toll. manage disease best A1C 6.0

His family keeps thinking already vaccinated, WI priority.  healthy 65 year old neighbor vaccinated sick husband. Even administered wrong missing 4,2 million. 64,2 million administered, 60. 

But yeah, keep downvoting! ... fantastic genes don’t know people would unexcited vaccine prevents serious illness 85% patients vaccines prevent infection ~95%? I’m talking street, parks etc.  typo part, distributed replaced administered. Wrong word me.

Also dude, youve responded like second flat comments. Reddit times coincidence?? curious, lightning fast response. 😂”getting covid test stranger crowded bar” chart awesome makes think I'm fear mongering? develop new vaccine real fast. second full pandemic. never said would be. probably mutation that's immune current vaccines require new vaccine. remember ""up 100k deaths"" fear mongering?  Never closed fl German newspapers talking data AZ presented european health agency approval.

That data lacked older participants, still day, European countries upper age limit AZ vaccine 65 70. Cuomo got moved dog house? /S get downvoted still spread unvaccinated vaccinated. Sure drop rate significantly wear mask one two months longer everyone wants vaccine get one. lot hyperbole understandably frustrated people whose personal professional lives turned upside disease (statistically speaking) impact lives catch it. I’ve signed every pharmacy town get shots months ago. Still zero notifications. rollout criminally slow. happens bureaucracies incompetent governments control rollout. using every ounce military deliver vaccine shots around country. We’re war. taking long?? want live normally again. [http://imgur.com/gallery/zKhr9aN](http://imgur.com/gallery/zKhr9aN)

The flu gone everyone wearing masks, yet coronavirus control bc one wearing masks..?


How make sense people lol Thank responding! wondered since last year vaccine announced makes sense. make mask wearing hand washing thing feel unwell on. I’m going say general public thought still spread COVID even you’re fully vaccinated. I’m going social situation soon small group us quarantining getting tested first - half us fully vaccinated following protocols. may able eventually, get ""schedule shot Kroger"" phase. thought would less people got year less immunity population next year. doubt one year much though. western world isn’t using Sputnik V time Phase III studies came late order get time. Russia barely able produce vaccine immunize population (they vaccinated 3.9 million people. population 144 million); countries ordered vaccine way back like Mexico barely getting any.

Considering trouble EU vaccines, they’d probably take Sputnik V heartbeat, shots would probably arrive late year next. So, let get straight, came article compares excess mortality Europe Sweden fits spread, point much better would done like Singapore?

Totally, waited six comments bring Singapore. long play...

Get real. keep hounding comparison. Ok, compare Sweden success story see far away Sweden even trying contain outline measures Singapore took much harsh ones Sweden?

Phase 1

Schools closed.

Businesses closed.

Condo facilities closed.

Visiting households, closed.

The thing open grocery stores, go restaurants, delivery services, hospitals, utilities, transport, banking.

Masks distributed households government.

Sweden nothing like Singapore. entire country shut spread controlled test, trace quarantine place. Sweden test, trace quarantine every single case find? not, Pre-pandemic, first day illness would expense. One first things back March 2020, started recommending people stay home smallest symptoms remove make paid. Hands European tissue cries Canadian get vaccinated another state state especially county slowed absolute crawl able vaccinate everyone summer Wondering trump Sure thing.

I got Friday morning, around 10:00AM. shot hurt all, first led believe got placebo. hit like TRUCK around midnight. HORRIBLE chills body aches. Slightly elevated fever. tried deal hours broke took Acetaminophen, helped tremendously. 

Saturday wash. bed day watching Netflix playing video games. 

Sunday started feel better. Maybe 50% mid day 90% late evening. 

Monday morning 100%. 

I virtually side effects second (booster) shot.   really hope culture change US regards wearing masks one feels might something brewing inside themselves. honestly really care. time ever aware CDC recommendations past told us stop eating romaine lettuce, people posted articles mocking Facebook. I've always comfortable using common sense risk assessment, I'm sticking moving forward. curious also. One one hand forced lockdown essentially. hand, forced super spreading events. Hi- business 0 revenue since March last year. dependent large conventions survive. 60+ employees 2 locations beginning last year. Today, me, income.

So, get it, please understand ""ugh, masks stupid"". family's survival, thousands families like mine, dependent return normalcy quickly possible.

Yes, still selfish, I'm minorly inconvenienced. ""worse country"" mean? 

Worse countries world (so worse median)? That's probably true, applies definition half countries, bad. 

Worse country. That's likely true. let's put way pretty much impossible find per capita metric US would done worse country world. course drop per capita look absolute numbers, maybe, kind comparisons silly think Fauci would stupid think would value. Using kind metric would make California worst state US even though deaths/capita numbers national average. 

I'm saying US done great, I'm trying get bottom Fauci trying say. Pretty sure R value flu observational, takes account everything.

 intrinsic R value really thing. could try estimate R value san immunity would still depend population (connectivity, social customs, environment, general health) really intrinsic. R value measure interaction infectious agent infectee, cant intrinsic infectious agent. Lmao know people always posting “Stay safe! Stay home! need shutdown!” Twitter eating restaraunts time shapchat Hearing scientists say stuff like good reminder purely need scientists informing public policy. imagine implementing social distancing measures every winter?

(I say already degree... Definitely take kids indoor play centers flu season, definitely partake holiday festivities I'm willing give year year) alliance treaty requires EU European country act Pacific. US separate alliances countries covers pacific, namely Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea countries....but set differently NATO cases aren’t wide reaching NATO (ie quite regional, single alliance).

Having said that, unwritten rule countries allied West act common force around world. saw play war terror (Iraq Afghanistan) , many countries West agreed participate....and saw play UK France commenced military action Libya. US support engagement, contribute logistics assets action expectation alliance EU. Pretty much large corporation (be privately State owned) countries rule law pay billions lawsuits lifetime. everyone vaccinated still spread ? Idiot really isn’t true. AZ trial U.K. 8948 people, Brazil 6753 South Africa 1476. That’s lower 40k Pfizer trial still perfectly acceptable data. It’s positive it’s different regions negative. US trial data still come. 

The big difference Oxford compared profit vaccines release everything, warts all, academia always shareholders worry about. mean people original trial still protected least 6 7 months growing everyday Exactly. 

The vaccine approved two-dose regimen extensive clinical research.

I also gladly taking second dose, based science already have. miss part explains ""best effort"" means completely different things completely different legal systems?

No, guess missed fact clearly stated EU contract ""best effort"" means, mean delivering less 50% doses without using available plants could potentially use. 

I still quite get UK contract would relevance anyway.  Old people say darndest things! finally dispel myth 'no one wearing masks lul' since obviously effect viruses? Ah, media! Can't speak effects read one analysis says happens quarter vaccinations guaranteed. Hopefully miss part. That’s said all. Please don’t make nothing thing. That’s harmful pretty much every situation. wrote best selling book successful response was, Emmy (really), praised Fauci correctly. Fauci CNN said new CDC recommendations vaccinated individuals coming soon. think Yes. Let's talk today try get handle optimistic versus cautious still. weekend Sunday told Dana Bash could recommend fully vaccinated people get together grandchildren. know also said think fully vaccinated people dining indoors going theater. not? vaccines 95 percent effective, let people get back semblance old life? 
  know, Alisyn, lot discussions that. mean, look would personally, would feel comfortable something like that. want make sure make recommendations, CDC, agency primarily responsible collecting data making public health recommendations, want make sure sit down, talk it, look data come recommendation based science. 
  clear -- absolutely right, I've discussions this, comfortable discussions. say, well, wait minute, I'm fully vaccinated daughter comes house fully vaccinated, really stringent public health measures would stranger vaccinated vaccinated? 
  sense tells that, fact, stringent public health measures. want, want get firm recommendations CDC, believe coming soon. started important recommendation think others coming. fully vaccinated person come contact someone known infected SARS-Cov-2, kind quarantine recommending. Remember ten days without test, seven days test. That's put aside. 
  believe going hearing recommendations relax stringency things particularly dealing something like personal family people vaccinated. believe forthcoming pretty soon. Accidentally socialist? Welcome club, man. doubt it, could wait. apart swedish Better lead example act like rules apply you. lot room taking seriously assuming every old person gets dies. comes lifting restrictions global pandemic. political longer reinstate restrictions. hypothetical scenario there's another outbreak, one going want go back restrictions. That's cautious waiting hit critical mass vaccinations lifting restrictions en masse; go normal there's going back. mentally ill? moment right now, people fully vaccinated could benefit one less person potentially spreading Atlantic. J&amp;J’s announcement 20m yesterday, think 21-25 age group able get vaccine?

When predict everyone wants vaccine double vaccinated by? wrote elsewhere, really hope covid given people awareness spread germs around poor hand hygiene uncovered mouths flu cold. Popping mask public poorly much ask would great became new social norm, courtesy. world country? whole country Florida either. vast majority country operating like normal. Even Southern states Midwest. easier businesses say they're something called ""solution"" cheaper alternative (like redoing HVAC system adding air filtration system may practical would expensive).

Plus gives illusion action taken safe go there. Tell subreddit basically every healthcare professional shouting CAN'T START THINGS SAFE YET, except also realistic answer safe. 2024 realistic answer. Fauci CNN morning saying official guidance vaccinated people ""soon"".

I expect advice comes out, vaccinated people lot confidence do.

At moment, information void (due emergency use vaccines) creating FUD. hope mask restrictions gone, CDC tests kids needing wear masks school November 1st winter break counties, compare counties' flu outbreaks similar counties mask restriction children.

Something tells would see large drop number flu cases areas. big enough, could enough reason kids wear masks school 7 weeks per year   complete 180 sub taken wild one extremely rushed tested extent vaccines. heard JJ Tylenol recalls fuck ups? JJ baby powder cancer lawsuits? sad, frightening.  Yes. pissed winding down. Canada. asking someone would want know level risk take vaccine something strange? one thinking second third order consequences here. decide government cripple landlords drop hat adding risk never priced in, one two things happen. Either landlords jack price compensate future potential downturns, decide risk getting screwed high sell. Either way, effect market forces drive rent prices up.

Landlords factor risk like tenant damage, vacancy, repairs, on. one factors unprecedented government interference. might now, going cost us. wear cloth mask help prevent flu, legit, disposable N95 masks available next flu season? Yeah, I'll probably put one stepping crowded subway station. whole country California know? lot places even masks norm. One thing hope outdoor dining summer. nice, pandemic not. Yeah, we're fucked measles ever gets control. psychology people ostensibly pro-vaccine spreading information questionably factual likely hurt vaccine effort. think flip thinking one, meaning evaluate benefit benefit others. Like people, can't afford day every time get sniffles, caught flu times know first day (for anyway) usually distinguishable cold. cough fever sets in, know what's going make plans stay home, point likely I've spent day work around friends loved ones may infected. idea experiencing cold, wear mask protect around you.

I think masks mandated get first flood vaccinations, probably wear mask I'm sick must go future. 39 pretty late risky, glad worked can't really say preferable everyone that. 

and effect cohort women. They'll always able find man wants marry settle them. men actually want age, marry younger Fair enough.  Great news! Perfect timing vaccinations warmer weather. powers consider boosting vaccinations areas hit new variants continue drive counts. insurance. exactly, people susceptible days Wait, Johnson &amp; Johnson? baby company? learn something new? Gaslight away you’re US think state bad, remember UK you’re even allowed meet one person outside next two weeks. Well flu circulating scientists short data vaccination. Could potentially see season flus. Plus natural immune response fade. it’s going take mutation scientists don’t pick right away. boom races. saying it’s going happen, I’m hypothetical. Yes that.

Although obviously new movies watch many people still avoiding restaurants. I've heard ways. I'd like remind people Buzzfeed News actual journalism division website well-regarded. particular article reached several medical experts discuss practice found precedent sort ""physical therapy"" training nose able smell again, magical cure everyone. people walk away spot hold mrna vaccine see non-mrna vaccine vial front one administering says willing give them.

Probably many people grand scheme things, people this. I’m guessing place someone lying registration form. you’re right: states eligibility guidelines based combination risk factors (age, health conditions, workers job related exposure, essential services). young healthy people supposed getting vaccinated people work jobs place high risk provide essential service. Definitions priorities vary state, legitimate arguments that. see occasional mask every winter crazy online far between. Never encountered someone like real life though. 20 million doses death. expecting wearing mask public transport high traffic enclosed spaces norm.

No. People done fogged glasses, unable see expressions, rebreathing breath, etc. Tangential fact:

Gin tonic took drink helped treat malaria (tonic water quinine it.) Nah... ( arthritis ) UK contract also ""best effort"" one.

Did miss part explains ""best effort"" means completely different things completely different legal systems? Here’s issue, immune compromised pockets population given access. States allowing folks considered vaccine.

There people parts cannot get vaccine. vaccinate others work numbers probability. vaccinated, timeframe share disease others drops since body knows fight it. less less people incubators, cannot get vaccine much lower risk contracting.

While wait get point, masking, even vaccine, important. Saying madness inappropriate. It’s needed protection get critical mass vaccines. googled did. know. guy behind bars? thought vaccines available people who've already COVID, since immunity bit? crazy even get vaccine nothing changes. still get virus, still transmit, still need mask businesses still closed. Literally nothing changes may reduced ""effects"" contract What's happening effectively massive example eminent domain whereby government effectively commandeered NY housing offered owners property nothing return. 

Next time there's natural disaster people displaced imagine government says ""Hey here's Rusty, place live he'll crashing sofa next 12-18 months. allowed kick out. We're together. all, assumed risk could subjected ridiculous abuses private property rights mistakenly bought property heretofore free society.""

How risk tenant assumes sign lease may able pay due unforeseen circumstances? live walk lease wages garnished landlord owe money made whole. diamond hands lockdowns worked extremely well two island nations work well places island nations, maybe fact they're islands something I’m good masks, one really distancing anyway tbh. don’t see people think vaccine b like magic tho. It’s magic lol. point subs spew shit into. TL;DR:

January 23 Halmstad announced PPE equipment policy school personnel, reversed **literally day** massive public outcry.

Swedish sources:

* ban first reported Halmstad local radio: Pressrelease Halmstad municipality reversing ban: discourage people think make pass one vaccine that's done, go back accept get vaccine rejected. None choosy beggar stuff.

After everyone's vaccinated covid finished start opening vaccines commercially, point people pay whatever vaccine want. make best bet accept vaccine offered.

I'm sure legality/morality surrounding could even tell people vaccine got, least they'd it, got *a* vaccine. like lockdowns masks work Lmao, interesting turn phrase considering willing keep majority burden children. yea sure, kind think vaccinated people active community (20-30 year olds realistically) would limit spread elderly hence hospitalizations... 


I know entirely agree age based system though understand trying do..  referring ignorance “freedom-minded”. Yeah, sure. many times end hospitals overflowed?

You seem angry maybe there’s difference deaths past years deaths last year. world objectively worse place COVID suffering immense.

What fuck happened place can’t even say without someone trying reduce that? Lmfao. Thanks Chad, would like run comments future? opinion said? No, obviously don't. disagree metric mask elimination tied cases- believe tie hospitalizations deaths. least holding up, FDA approval. J&amp;J can't really anything right speed really think people continue masking summer? must close gyms. think cognitive dissonance going people ardent defenders lockdowns. say could still correct lockdowns thing ends pandemic - vaccines be. think hard people let go defending becoming clear soon problem solution. something heard endless Spring/Summer even though conditions changed arguably true &amp; may true then, people hard time accepting reality.  Thanks! best friend, retired doctor TN, got first dose last week, wife young wait. live USA.   said Implied denying anything? You’re damn quick assume. life expectancy covid higher normal times. it’s unfortunately wild fire tough shape. Whats data places close? what's argument giving vaccine time older residents? wait line age group, especially since they're remote interacting patients? say 20 million doses end March. average 5 million week. things tend go way could see small amount beginning large dump month end. COVID saw quite lot extreme paranoids since China government' fault. also saw school girl threatened sheriff jail time posting COVID information Instagram Wisconsin. put US government? think isn’t optimistic enough tbh I'm teacher still coworkers 50s 60s vaccinated. see going old crowd, people 50 work grocery, schools heavily public facing jobs gone health care nursing homes MS line phone. I’m senior, problem line system. Got second dose yesterday! side effects, Pfyzer.  Fauci!

I need Fauci tell I'm safe! going ask... increase chance worse influenza season next time around? going bankrupt due market forces going bankrupt due government intervention. receive compensation government FORCED cancel rent include ages 55-65, also seeing significant covid deaths, that's 52 million people. Add hospital workers, teachers, first responders, prisons that's approaching ~60-70 million people. 63 million doses administered date, least 35 million received one doses, least half vulnerable populations. 

News Oregon saying sometime April finish vaccinating vulnerable groups. let's say end March figures correct pace continues accelerate. right here, sure. CDC stated quarantine exposed 3 months vaccination that's statement vaccine work three months, certainly good least long. 

Also, I've noticed users stating post everywhere, often little sourcing back up. worth asking sources checking people's source history see pushing narrative. judge people want stay lockdown single second longer need solution government needs ensure vaccine faster.

I see convince people vaccinated still social interaction year plus pandemic would largely less severe vaccine.

What hide hospitals empty ignore majority want see friends family coming summer?

Maybe compromise keep masking restrictions know last.

The floodgates opening like not, change people breaking points this, robbed millions people financial security. People thread cold face saying need closures distancing full year longer minimum.....really? Yes. I’m tired doom spreaders damn thing isn’t yet know every received backlogged deliveries weekend? 2.5 realistic. 15% Pfizer week plus tons states never received shipments last week. It’s likely year LEAST estimates I’ve heard meant CV19. Obviously well. know agent Orange napalm. Yeah mean I'm sorry people lose money sometimes that's happen. bought stock company lost money stock would go down. can't keep supporting landlords protect market changes. data durability antibody response comparison two 2 shot mRNA vaccines? UK voted 'remain', way EU handled covid shady actions around AZ vaccine actually first time i've felt good EU more.

I’m exactly same. Bit reality check really. Same, know people lost day two. know 1 person took 4 months fully come back. one guy lost 4 months got covid last march lockdowns. talking outside Covid situation, breakthrough mRNA technology. yes statement true. theory people saw outbreaks ""someone's fault"" vaccines like get jail free card see people unworthy getting. judge people 3 times? think it’s “madness?” believe Pfizer went FDA committee recommended EUA - day two later. Somebody knows week bad New shots given? reccomended public health officials brush teeth 3 times instead 2 times - dosn't mean going make break life 2 times mRNA vaccines effective measles vaccine. obviously level numbers get lower, current rate new cases dropping US, 0 less 3 weeks. Friday FDA advisors meeting discuss vote recommend approve it. get recommendation, official approval usually soon after. know Pfzier Moderna reviewed recommended Fridays received approval weekend over.  think depends are, old are, friends are.

I’m obviously trying get covid won’t catch packed nightclub, aunt uncle GFs mother vaccinated, I’m justifying anything anymore. stay safe aunt uncle get vaccinated week gfs mom front line phase 1c Ohio won’t issue anymore.

Once I’m staying safe safe, I’m justifying shit. get then, it’s damn fault. bit misleading tbh, 85% related diseases SARS protection COVID, “no one hospitalized due COVID taking vaccine yet”. It’s 66% effective. Which, means 34% people continue spreaders still get sick. 66% doesn’t get us herd immunity whole lot faster.

Still, better nothing, vaccine choice. know it’s possible pro lockdown understand science, also understand increase domestic violence, drug alcohol abuse, mental illness, right?

The lockdowns social isolation, well lack access help (the fuck gonna do, go see therapist go AA?) absolutely killed people. doesn’t mean weren’t necessary. It’s like saying “we shouldn’t stormed Normandy, people died!”, accurately, acting like anyone acknowledges people died pro-hitler. seeing that? seems like great news. last priority group matter reason happy get pushed back many people expected taking it. Unironically world us imperialism time, yes.  Awww poor imperial core inhabitant Human influenza strains currently suppressed globally eradicated. human interaction travel go back normal bounce back something similar previous equilibrium within months years. naturally fluctuate drastically summer-winter seasons.

Additionally, already said, animal influenza strains eventually jump back humans even human strains eradicated globally would temporary thing.  start work quickly. Considering kind big time demand fade quickly around 50% adults shot... state failure motivated adult cannot get shot May latest. much demand.... also good thing mean far overshoot herd immunity. got second dose yesterday, Mississippi. According State’s numbers, 17% population quite 3 million received least one dose. got bro means less immunity around next flu season blast. US eventually need share, completely selfish country that. However, point quite time. see JJ AZ/oxford shared don’t need much anymore. I'd like see states keep literally one town, headline already wrong. 
The article also old reversed. quick googling. Moderna Pfizer vaccines tested people 16 older. Pfizer recently completed study children young 12 Moderna ongoing study children young 12.

If results studies positive they'll move 5-11 age aunt uncle serious lung issues get vaccinated Thursday god going relief. mom one daughters seen year. Looking forward summer fun again! Fuck piece shit! looking certain states, like New York, seems like opened eligibility many people based availability vaccines. really think poltical reasons. say opened teachers, essential workers, elderly, people various illnesses etc.... reality much harder individual get appt. many people prioritized, one prioritized... probably true, since 105, also got shots. article goes even say family going start eating gin soak raisins, thank god, etc. nothing vaccine. I'm salty, know it. wish people would give credit credit due. article takes away science dedication that's gone beating Covid hands raisins gin. Great.  companies definitely providing enough vaccine make happen, question distribute fast enough thinking ventilators. respirator high quality mask. Yeah I’m going start stopping friends tracks. You’re grown adult, trust know shouldn’t do, accept risk tolerance. don’t need COVID resume. Good article, week old Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* soon fully vaccinated, see need justify actions. Meh, saying live mask worry-free restrictions 2022. That's pretty damn good outlook. Hopefully that's also case fall 2021, it'll depend cases blow again, seems unlikely.  experimental vaccine. Footing bill aka going bankrupt I’m slowly seeing optimism, even usually non-optimistic sources! I’m seeing less less talk variants. learn AZ Moderna deliveries EU delayed UK seems problems.

#Exit used work pharmaceutical industry. Reviewing new medecine efficient drug is, also secondary effects, drug made, secure plants making (we want someone poison lot, retrieve active agent), secure ITmanaging (they also review standard operating procedures things like gets access servers storing data related producing shipping drug) etc. whole line fabrication every detail needs approved. wasn't, drug get pharmacy could swapped something else, corrupted ineffective, wrongly labeled past date ...

That's health agencies issuing expedited approvals skip steps, them.  don’t know long works, atleast Moderna, father brother confirmed still fully protected week received first doses august I’m 7 months pregnant, I’ll ecstatic get vaccine, I’m picky. certainly don’t want get Covid caring newborn. trying pretend like wu? Winter solstice marks turn shortening days lengthening days, always important climate predictions. feel same. Everyone family extended family qualified one reason another. feels like it’ll never happen I'm callous never wanted blame greater society death, something going experience? 

If truly mindset, feel sorry you. Life good rough. noticing too. 

People easily misled. don’t know else think. conversations led with, ""As people get vaccinated, mask mandates disappear gradually""?

That people think negativity convince people optimistic realism beyond me. know everyday gets little bit safer last finally May ask you’ve sleep study shows RDI diagnose UARS?

I figured symptoms mine due UARS. got treated feel normal first time 5 years. got every vitamin, hormone, thyroid, ct scan etc etc rule things out. Forgetting COVID entirely, yes, please stop working in-person people symptomatically ill. quarantine two weeks whatever, intentionally meet people know sick. less got vaccinated. I’m 25, healthy, someone wound list got text get vaxxed.

I justified morally fact crowded classrooms everyday coach every afternoon, perfect super spreader.  need Sniper Rifle (COVID) kill sleeping bear, shotgun (FLU) kill birds.

hey, wants sell sniper rifle doubles shotgun, i'll take it. realize still get sick thing even you’re vaccinated right ? Australia New Zealand cannot remain isolated forever. gambit works someone else produces vaccine economies collapse. welcome. rule world. high risk people probably still vaccine anyway, since create better immunity real thing. talking \~5% difference full attendance baseball games

don't see deaths/hospitalizations low. Hospitals overrun people right make decision microscopic risk dying what's basically rendered common cold vaccine.  say believe 90% likely, didn’t said came Wuhan.  Everything speculation, said investigated that’s it, watch interview? Closed border damaging reasons preventing international travel, especially nations dependent international trade Australia New Zealand. little shocking see people almost certainly outraged Donald Trump's anti immigrant policy suddenly pretend closed borders totally acceptable. don’t think people realize get past 65 year olds risk groups many people opt get it.   making sense.

What ""instant availability"" supposed mean? means instantly available anyone wants - opposed April's ""open season"", ""instant availability"" means everyone wants it, gets it. July, October. absolutely need herd immunity virus R0 It’s 66%  damn mask. 

i feel like people would rather wear mask ban under-16s participating society. It’s literally section sentence way claim aren’t taking fraction sentence. fact sentence longer provided you. don’t like don’t convenience narrative. main worry hysteria case counts fueled young ppl caring anymore old people vaccinated. I'm worried governors still brainwashed whole ""covid deadly young ppl too"" rhetoric, imposing restrictions everyone takes vaccine even worse, covid cases basically zero.  Whatcha talking about? can’t imagine would mask mandate past spring, businesses ask stores, would comply.

Edit add: would likely wear one inside summer help others feel ease since vaccines may take long. But, can’t imagine mask mandates lasting long. yeah, think evidence growing mRNA vaccines given single dose now, wrap back get people 2nd dose 2-4 months. maybe still give high-risk people both, 20-year-old, fit cashier fine single dose summer studies accurate. always months away, sentence lost meaning. literally telling people vaccinated still live isolation. Explain value vaccine stop us isolate. Texas, people drive rural areas &amp; smaller towns get shot... FREEDOM.......ugh.....why tf can't americans act selfishly

It's actually kind funny every single country seems think people selfish ones reason virus still circulating. easy people completely override human nature socialise see loved ones coming year now. american thing, human thing.   Yes I'm sure Fauci wants control life. I'm sure that's it. man cautious made calls early mistakes, he'd rather cautious considering he's trusted essentially Chief Advisor President United States pandemic. knows road pandemic, wants keep things going steady path. PCP know live virus vaccines contraindicated condition showed CDC documentation regards. rare condition, advocate understand doctors going know everything it.  someone copy article. behind paywall I'm concerned case counts still like moderately high, liberal states like illinois (my state), still impose masks maybe capacity restrictions even hospitalizations deaths extremely low. way keep restrictions virtually eradicated, I'm mainly concerned hysteria rises cases something that's basically become flu bc vaccine. full lecture halls frequently mask college prevent cases common cold covid would've transformed into, *livid.* fully understand safety laws. However shutting small businesses thousands crowd Walmart ok? Where’s science safety that?

Is making illegal leave home even socially distanced alone really safety? girl town next mine cited fined going got joy ride.... alone... country. 100 days stuck home. violating stay home ORDER. Again, science safety that? totally socially distanced officer approached her. risk downvoted, sad country among least responsible handling covid, getting vaccines. Meh, money talks. enough people get vaccinated wear masks. take time get point. months, years. panic. I’m fully vaccinated worn masks throughout pandemic. urge make premature assumptions. 

Last heard, might actually pretty close herd immunity US, though. believe heard figure ~30% population infected. Combined vaccinations, we’re reasonably getting place infections may slow down. don’t think that’s thing causing drop COVID metrics, probably contributing factor.  there’s 10-15% excess mortality, that’s lot. 

Maybe Scottish actually tried prevent extra deaths, hardly say US. Given vaccines known reduce symptoms transmission, it’s hard believe also reduce effects virus body. Less replication means less cell damage, less damage means less effects. yeah, rollout much worse been. knew year. paid out-of-work folks last spring/summer identify contact elderly folks via social security database (keeping data safe, course), hired apple, google, amazon create sign-up list takes information prioritizes people. people hammering F5 CVS website day hoping get apt older person gets jumped line immediately. realize still good odds vaccine? suggestion give people exposed most, moron. That’s biggest fear point. light end tunnel it’s getting bright. minimizing infections still incredibly important. Every person gets virus mutation risk. It’s complicated that. you’ve vaccinated vulnerable populations, restrictions don’t make sense. Full stop. Covid worse seasonal flu children. vulnerable adults vaccinated we're good go, even virus continues spread among children. “The American people worried frightened this. It’s very, low risk United States” Jan 26. 3 days Wuhan lockdown. Bro talk pcp. give ok set. don’t trust J&amp;J all, possible I’d prefer different vaccine. said today c.d.c. really know believe anymore. talking Christmas. Maybe wasn’t talking politics. that’s bit stretch part. meant childhood indoctrination. Take look childhood social studies book they’re titled things like “the land free”. Well turns spend decade teaching kid’s tend grow believing it.   Sorry, adenovirus vector ""new technology"" around tested extensively multiple applications since 80s. referring that, ""traditional vaccine"" thing. get KN95, good. May 2020 PTSD real need get lol doesn’t strike ego centric. think “power” mitigated quite bit last year.  
All know nursing school 800 years ago learned social distancing mask wearing presence immunocompromised people.  
These recommendations decades old invented COVID-19 appeared. hundred thousand dead 65

It ""typical"" seeing half deaths people age US life expectancy. assume died perfectly healthy COVID, expect [16 lost life per death. since deaths either people already sick issues (e.g. CVD, T2D, obesity, etc) elderly people, number drop low single digits. 

Note 80% COVID hospitalization deaths patients never admitted ICU -- i.e. bioethicists determined would unethical prolong lives already sick problems elderly. 

In US, COVID disproportionally hits elderly ""all cause"" mortality:

COVID mortality 15-65: **18.8% total** ([all cause ""involving"" mortality 15-65: **26.1% total** beginning look cost elevating COVID care forms care. [This analysis estimates COVID care saved 17,000 years life, ""collateral"" cost causing 250,000 years lost life people without COVID healthcare neglected. Whereas state announced 2 separate medical entities ramping campaigns educate people getting. vaccine people literally showing appointments different groupings people high number people refusing even get it. apparently ton orphan shots there. dad 68 went ahead got list can’t seen May 18 earliest. want optimistic think many dumb people bottlenecking distribution gonna allow us clear soon everyone else thread thinks. trying edgy, I’m sick tired arguing this. don’t feel comfortable getting J&amp;J vaccine, period. That’s opinion. it’s wrong, unrealistic, whatever, doesn’t change opinion it. I’m anti-vax, I’m anti-science, one particular vaccine makes feel uncomfortable don’t want take it. Sorry don’t like that. feeling now? better still symptoms? course means nothing assumes vaccine roll static, clearly isn’t. also assumes people willing receive vaccine, aren’t. still wear masks vaccine, point vaccine wide majority population. madness never going end, it?

I supposed meeting boss tomorrow discuss things. texted saying feeling symptoms wants get test seeing anyone in-person.

But... like... I'm vaccinated. vaccinated. like quarantine herself??? going quarantine every single time sniffles? trapped homes force. They’re scared death government. Administration capacity far greater supply

Considering states used half available doses, I'm quite confident you. lot says left February, idea 2x vaccines per day weeks seems pretty dubious.

But agree timeline better looking general sentiment Facebook can't say many ""friends"" yes know least 50. Numbers slightly padded 2 families 6 caught friends sister college who's whole friend group got infected together. April start gral population, July instant availability all, October everybody wanted done Go hug FIL - cancer almost fully vaccinated. done social distancing visits since March 20 single dose vaccine. means 20 million doses equal 20 million people. Less work health systems health departments do. case red good, makes sense. lower efficacy rate J&amp;J vaccine (~66%) still considered effective rate, despite quite bit lower Pfizer Moderna vaccines. 

The flu vaccine, 40-60% effective, still considered yearly success. truth people act means care COVID, need opposite. hurt angry deaths. There’s people legit this. Check vaccine hunting. It’s better go anyone’s arm rather trash!  Lol that’s goal! honestly already roughly 20% vaccinated feels pretty good considering feb isn’t yet  subreddit nut shell. 

Gotta wait 100% people vaccinated see people. Please continue living isolation. Dude I'm straight verge chilling around vaccine sites go ""hey need living human get vaccine someone missed appointment expires 2 hours"" proudly volunteer mention quarter population ineligible vaccine due age alone. lot people keep glossing fact kids 18 cannot receive vaccine, constitute 75M Americans (going 2010 census data). Sure, kids don’t get sick... spread threat still pretty pronounced.  Fauci said masks work, begging people wear masks.

Who listens fool? remember correctly lists 3 objectives closing schools. longest term one 6 months. Don’t quote though. think people get little confused timeline is.

The May date (was April J&amp;J said going behind shipments first -- though may severe J&amp;J said last week) date US expects done priority groups open appointments everyone.  anticipated date ranged April early June. key fast Johnson johnson supply vaccines makes math lot easier.

The July August dates dates Fauci expects everyone wants get vaccine offered least one shot (or possibly even both, unsure actually, likely least one though - UK expects everyone offered 1 shot end July example. Canada end September). difference according mild moderate covid. thing vaccine 66% effective preventing it. 85% preventing severe covid 100% preventing hospitalization death. That’s pretty damn significant. 

Long covid? Really? Pfizer Moderna read outs supposed long covid? Ryquell Armstead missed entire season due effects COVID. continue distancing masking? selfish you. even mean? Show pandemic “burned out”. true, CDC lied face masks, screwed testing beginning. Fauci also repeated lies.

Shame reddit downvotes saying truth way, pandemic worst nightmare come true. somehow, I’ve found way tolerate live fear... till point germs phobia quieted precautious whisper. Based we’re seeing, seems like odds one vaccinated person getting infected transmitting another vaccinated person low.  Apparently Connecticut competent government guess understand open mask requirement considered open.... Kids able get vaccine fall last heard. big deal. hi Covid: “Nooo!! can’t pump vaccines I’m already running fresh hosts infect!!” 

Companies: “blue vaccine bubbles go brrrrrrrr” holiday

Which holiday? Super Bowl? Tbf vaccines thr US going quite fast. mean UK ahead us terme western nations Put me! seems absurd majority vaccinated also UK strain, arrived month ago. Crushed one :)  trackers count children, even though one sixteen vaccinated vaccines approved people eighteen. told April May also “No Idea”. There’s plan central California.

I already resentment building toward medical community. really want build that, letting healthy person go medically vulnerable disabled good way it. profession captive clientele, hell even asshole get nothing done? Let’s goooo Lol, shit. mean it’s likely we’ll see increase cases fall. question significant depends well vaccines work variants widespread vaccine acceptance is. reasons hopeful valid concern. Mine Godzilla vs Kong lol Fingers crossed you! 🤞 June 2020 - turned - June 2021 wedding stressing me, too. Covid19 cases whole dropping winter surge terrible, however B.1.1.7 cases doubling faster initial wave covid19. 82 cases B.1.1.7 New York far, number super low slowly thing spreads lag symptoms infectious. 82 cases drop bucket compared bad things winter, hell 100 cases New York alone today, cases B.1.1.7, atleast hope god would mean even infectious thought. problem covid slow moving not, spreads silently lag symptoms, blind sides health infrastructure asymptomatic spreading sudden start getting sick, rolls like waves, one bigger next peaks drops off. bad things winter see cases start go upward March. Thankfully time around we've got vaccines, even though cases might begin shoot back B.1.1.7 surge, deaths go stay down. vaccines will, (and hope being), essentially turn covid19 something like common cold. Hello friends - looking info new Pfizer trial pregnant women. say anywhere chose 24-34 week gestation period trial candidates? got first Pfizer dose half hour ago. good news hope reaches arms quickly can. roll thus far (at least state) lackluster. Pfizer specifically prohibits insert. understand lifestyle works people. making statements like “I really hard time understanding people aren’t comfortable alone thoughts” makes people suffering feel even isolated. Different people different needs, different people different time life you. caregivers, trying teach college-level coursework, trying keep struggling business alive, living mental illness cut support systems. Even none things applies someone still find difficult, that’s understandable humans are, part, social creatures. Please, enjoy time, try find empathy others struggling. Half population? That’s pretty badass think comment referring fact lockdown exacerbated issues mental health domestic violence, furthermore, lack physical activity exacerbated health conditions. Death rates gone outside coronavirus, caused lockdown. isn’t saying shouldn’t lock down, rather better job containing controlling virus end lockdown sooner. won’t go back movie theater masks longer required. There’s really point wearing masks since take anyway food drinks. Okay, one no-brainer. Nice, nice goodness sake talking *the past*, right now... Even though clarified I'm still getting downvoted... Ugh... Lawyer well. goes way - wanted exclusive, exhaustive list, could said ""These conditions ARE:"" agree ""including, limited to"" definitively open-ended. ""Include"" somewhere between, open-ended closed-ended depending context interpretation. say ""this car includes internal combustion engine,"" foreclose car hybrid electric motor too. [Because even asymptomatic people end like this. 99% sure bit year ago. Back virus officially ""arrive"" live yet even talk much all. trouble breathing horrible cough point would wake middle night coughing uncontrollably 5 minutes. time still went friends (mind country officially cases everyone thought common cold) always made jokes tuberculosis.
Well, seen face heard virus already around time noticed symptoms matched perfectly. Going favourite restaurant whilst theyre busy ordering shit ton food. feeling crowded restaurant miss most. Money can't fix stupid. love hate relationship covid discussions lol. someone legitimately claim expert many aspects it, there's probably far know know. dont fault people seeking information though Canada still begging India scraps True. also keep mind oldest population also amongst lowest vectors transmission. 

I think end April it’s entirely different scenario. younger people get vaccinated R plummet exactly arbitrary limitations ridiculous point. 

Give people whose health greatest risk, you’ll automatically cover vulnerable taxi drivers, grocery workers, etc.

After that, open floodgates. Even someone doesn’t get immediately, everyone benefit people protected. LOL. thought might crossed mind. You’re wrong. facilities working insane paces especially given complicated production is. biggest constraint production lot supply constraints, equipment constraints, lack qualified people job. isn’t like producing simple consumer electronic. supply chains robust enough handle demand equipment manufacturing procedure takes long time get going validate safety/quality. Vaccine sites likely ramp supply ramps point waiting manufacturers said ramping next couple months. read article, guess rich people general following guidelines. Fauci maybe? ""640K ought enough anybody."" 

/s Heart. I’d rather take hit heart also. think mean specifically old people end hospitals case usually severe, that’s people vaccinated first? also stunning revelation?

By definition article also stunning revelation. scrolling since late January 2020, back people could still make text posts. panicked virus people real life still know talking about, husband included.

Oh mean 0, mean significantly impacted. We're also way less dense Israel help us--and happening seasonality side We're already close fifth

Are we? nytimes tracker shows 13% least one dose, 6% fully vaccinated. say virus escaping lab Rich countries tend large elderly population US also unhealthy country begin think worst behind us. Vaccinations increasing everyday. We've seen data showing even one dose provides good amount protection early signs show looks like also prevent transmission. Deaths/cases decreasing well. course things could always change would quite drastic change things get really bad. correct, check post Totally possible. It’s cruel card play pony money via OWS. 
I’d like see us take every dose bought Astra Zeneca Novavax donate them. Flat donate wherever. time two come plenty population already. gets us sooner.

We're going back normal summer vaccine available not, better alternative. Actually didnt. fact majority Americans get go college child. please tell missing 4 year person college end world. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Didn’t memorial service Covid victims day inaugurated? It’s almost like politicians shouldn’t take epidemiologists’ word gospel. Politicians’ failure consult behavioral psychologists sociologists become glaringly obvious. Maybe could stated obvious told people aren’t going withhold social interactions entire year. Depending state, getting one soon. 

But also, “a lot” relative. around 17 million cancer patients + survivors combined USA, vast majority (~2/3rds) age 65.

It would take days vaccinate cancer patients survivors &lt;65 years old USA. 

And that’s assuming overlap previously vaccinated groups.

And cancer patients initial groups.

But eventually, marginal benefit restrictions starts become negligible (is *really* much benefit vaccinate one healthy 30 year old “essential” worker vs 3 4 healthy 30 year olds?)

The people vaccinated better EVERYONE, eventually restrictions got go. That’s true important note resource usage perspective (most efficient use vaccination clinics time) slightly misleading mRNA vaccines effective single dose J+J is. That's still shit ton money. Australia 417k US dollars easily buy house, able afford unemployed 10ish years lot people respond ""I anyone who..."". Please recognize cognitive error. Here's example, something like 4 million babies born year States, yet know anyone given birth lately. Dos mean giving birth incredibly rare event? government lying babies really getting born? oh gosh, really - quite nit picker you? required restaurants they? People required wear unless table eating. Nothing change public places part regarding masks kids vaccinated. Accept it. guidelines generally say ""pulmonary disease"" includes Asthma without steroids. states might go specifics diseases, Illinois just, ""do lung disease."" really underestimating people’s desire leave houses extended periods time it’s safe so. I’m hermit even want house. correct. NJ portal, looked:

Have ever following medical conditions?*
Asthma (moderate severe)

Cancer

Cerebrovascular disease

Chronic Kidney Disease

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

Cystic fibrosis

Down Syndrome

Heart conditions, heart failure, coronary artery disease cardiomyopathies

Hypertension high blood pressure

Nicotine/smoking addiction

Obesity

Pulmonary fibrosis (damaged scarred lung tissues)

Sickle cell disease

Thalassemia (type blood disorder)

Type 1 diabetes mellitus

Type 2 diabetes mellitus

These include maybe risk conditions listed OP. also wondering since I'm NJ seeing people seemingly young healthy get vaccine. would yh. point person pretty much protected. full data yet whether vaccines stop transmission early data showing thst reduce transmission quite substantially probably safe well catching them. Game me. vaccination I'm restrictions again. countries locked everything others restrictions. arms)

I would literally get multiple shots eyeballs end stupid pandemic. Illinois consider anyone pulmonary disease group 1C, includes Asthma. forgetting kids? even started kids yet. School still hot spots. current recommendation wear mask you’ve vaccinated PROTECT OTHERS. 
As now, unsure people vaccinated continue transmit Covid asymptotic manner.  
I vaccinated continue wear mask respect others. Fingers crossed you!! Restaurants? bit hard eat mask :P What?! excess mortality Sweden’s Nordic neighbours 0. Agree many people gotten COVID still getting vaccine anyways, many 2/3 cases accounted likely unknowingly asymptomatic likely get vaccine well. Regardless everything looking good. Ehh probably mixture doom gloom good news. Go want. Supermarkets, big box stores, public transportation places still wear mask. Age still biggest factor hospitalizations scientists unwilling unable say whether vaccinated prevents transmission. would think would fairly easy question answer apparently not.
Maybe Israelis, Scots, take care us Unkess US done real world studies I'm unaware no. think Moderna used much outside US atm. Canada EU barely supply Moderna right Uk even received first doses Moderna yet. probably much different pfizer fairly similar all. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* well sure bar something - stores, restaurants, museums, etc still require masking. Good, hopefully ""bUt gOtTa kEeP wEaRiNg mAsKs"" crowd dies off. served presidents parties nearly forty years. Trump uniquely bad warrant criticism. guess that’s good. wonder whether theaters make profit 25% capacity. also don’t think many people keep masks lights go out. long bag popcorn soda, one really make put mask either. really, comparison would like entire US dying Covid. 🙄 friends mostly 30-ish NYC residents. ones roommates romantic partners mostly stuck around duration fine, less happy things going, past year. friends live alone, one suicidal episode ended hospitalized, left live parents 3 months; another spent 6 months parents, returning, alternating NYC parents' place every weeks. that. chances getting COVID Novavax vaccine comes US sufficient scale high. mRNA going future technology vaccines. good!

Think higher cases double edged sword. Ideally want little people infected possible right? avoid pandemic first place (the world messed bad) time higher cases means immunity. vary factors considered. type virus? reinfection happen? jazz.

I believe answers I'm exhausted. apologize. Millenials get screwed boomers again, else new US hundreds cases *european variant* testing tracing. 

Australia mostly Chinese variant, contagious variants came able test trace. 

You call excuses, I’m trying theorize based data. countries handled well Asia-pacific. there’s correlation severe lockdown measures/border control success containing virus worldwide. best explanation difference virulence two strains, already known explains data. deep gullibility trust elected officials best wishes heart? believe weapons mass destruction still Iraq ? think Tuskegee experiments fair game? deep loyalty people hate you? advisable throw around terms like junk science clearly unable understand facts data. made 3 assertions brief comment somehow opposite truth. 

You look extremely foolish. Fauci charge whether people wear mask. Gee, could predicted this?? /s

Literally everyone generation (gen Z) see writing wall living ""once lifetime"" events KEEP FUCKING HAPPENING. shit want kill ourselves, see future everything keeps going downhill rapidly. playbook said schools never closed 4 weeks? I'm sure, that's reasonably close time period women encouraged get pertussis vaccine, week 27-36 pregnancy gives time mount antibody response pass baby kid born bit early. think you’re getting I’m trying say though. force vaccines, immunity barriers virus responds find new hosts. Well hosts dwindling perhaps new variants response Exactly. That's point! Yes, ample proof vaccine prevents contraction and/or transmission. Neither required. reason say masks/social distancing required assholes w/o vaccine lie say vaccinated mess everything up. Ergo pretend majority vaccinated. optics. head US 340 million, actually 320 million.

It's 330 million: agreed share bunch demographic data everyone country got vaccinated pfizer, normally happen - way pfizer track vaccine behaves different age groups, genders etc didn’t mean specifically , whatever. You’re foolish depend people power save you. think politicians best interest mind? Keep hoping right thing see gets us nation. matter shitty politicians could went much better people took personal responsibility. people blame even told wear mask refused still do. aren’t contributing problem? They’re innocent? preventing 100% severe COVID hospitalization, yeah. Take look current infection rate per million US Canada. difference far less 5x right rate dropping faster. We’ll see exact timeline (it’s speculation point), death rate drops Canada, I’m favor dropping export restrictions. lol...ok. Keep living fantasy world think would remains good idea, long entry exit criteria well defined. Dr. Bottombitch weighing commemorate 400,000 Americans died virus. latest one memorialize 100,000 victims since then. chip app they've renamed vaccine passport make palatable going required get food job well believe yet right happens. New York California worse numbers Florida spite destroying joy life Can’t opinions sub apparently. ordering enough vaccines vaccinate whole country.

That's terrible idea, never vaccinating everyone, especially 15% population *can't* take it. That’s cool I’m wearing one I’m vaccinated. time get vulnerable people least offered it. point don’t care. Well virus follow patterns seasonality that’s works there’s conscious behind ot 2M day *by* March, 2M day average March.

Vaccinations ramp significantly March along distributed vaccines. Wait weeks Europe surpass USA comes deaths per capita thanks vaccine.

 surprise end day, USA #20 even lower ranking deaths per million. countries get vaccine last keep climbing charts. ok that, since pay quite lot taxes US government I'd like priority absolutely makes sense higher ages first. I’m state I’m going wait behind 37 year old remote workers. Mask wearing transitional period fine seems like overkill relative risk, unless insist going crowded indoor event cold flu. things continue pace, fully believe States begin formulating concrete reopening plans around April 1 steadily reopen fully Memorial Day. variants already escaping immunity, systems science rise occasion time move on. kids banned certain venues rather bothering paying customers. Mostly likely sometime April/May. long now. lot Japanese people travel home visit family around New Years, Christmas popular holiday dates.

Japan worst spike mile right around Christmas/New years, kept going mid-January.

I think Christmas/New Years (and America, Thanksgiving) unique vs others people gather/travel _a lot_ holidays, basically holiday. 

You're going see lot Americans even non-COVID times go way gather family Mother's Day even Memorial Day BBQ, example -- least scale would Christmas. That's €0.30 per EU citizen. 
We fighting right live. exist. win day, Fourth July longer known American holiday, day world declared one voice: ""We go quietly night!"" vanish without fight! We're going live on! I’m suggesting anything I’m typing behind two masks. isn’t dropping people suddenly started complying. Lol.

Similar plant expelling pollen days getting short *shrugs 

 exactly thought process feelings response none less lol doubt it. listed tuberculosis lists pandemic: extemely dramatic. said possible masking could last 2022 depending upon dynamics virus community. completely accurate statement--it's possible vaccine distribution go exactly planned, enough people refuse take vaccine prevent herd immunity, god forbid variant mutates escapes current vaccine protection. 

All things possible. Public health officials must convey uncertainty public messaging. interview expressed hope returning normalcy fall, added caveat certainty. There's absolutely nothing wrong commentary. Blame people believe news without fact checking themselves. ""It news, true!"" joke? Florida—like Florida, famous one botched responses entire pandemic insane people like you.

And COURSE you’re one Bill gates tracker chip crazies. bonkers shit while. honestly thought stories people like gross exaggerations are, glory. IMO really matters events/venues open &amp; operational. begins norm vs. pandemic exception, capacity restrictions evaporate. Plenty people scared covid. It’s people need convince. you’re saying taking shot literally doesn’t change quality life, it? They’re assuming everybody prettified covid that’s true.

You hit nail head. I’m 30 overall healthy. I’m worried all. parents vaccinated 95%+ concern before. older people vaccinated I’m really gonna give many fucks. I’ll still get vaccine avoid worry giving someone vulnerable go back normal, actually keep wearing mask afterwards I’d pretty apathetic towards vaccine. 

As stands though I’m still getting vaccinated afterwards regardless anyone says I’m wearing mask I’m going back normal, think many joining me. business owner says can’t afford that..

Then can’t afford business. I’m saying knew could’ve closed border, didn’t. Simple concept really. excuse US already hundreds cases, Australia also hundreds cases every day. still contained it. every city America open things like go NBA games person soon.

unless seattle ;) Maybe would redirect tax money back federal government help pay social infrastructure programs help get messes like this. Yeah. vaccinating 2M people per day March, avg blended time doses 25 days, could closer 150M Americans vaccinated least one dose Pfizer Moderna March 31.

I’m sure math but....

2 million doses day starting tomorrow running end March 70 million shots total. currently 25 million people waiting second shot, leaves 45 million doses new people. 

Even throw second doses window (which doing), adding 45 million 44 million already gotten least one shot brings 89 million least one shot end March. genuinely hope true genuinely hope FDA approves J&amp;J end week. anxiously waiting get vaccinated. Trump, obviously.

/s state literally announced today essential workers won’t get vaccinated faster gave time every age group go. Yesterday state website said sometime March I’m grocery worker, I’m pushed back May.

Not going lie, I’m kind pissed. mean, US rewarded throwing tens billions dollars vaccine manufacturers global pharma manufacturing hub. want different results go back decade country build pharma industry. I'm picturing toddler sidewalk chalk. Slowly surely grinding nothing literally hand-picked single country used single data point base entire argument massively complex issue. There's many countries socialised healthcare outperform US CFR. further, sticking UK, there's many single data points would indicate UK healthcare system better. isolation make reasoned argument either system. need look full picture. follows course two already EUA, meeting Friday, followed administrative stuff Saturday approval sat evening Sunday. doses arms early Monday Tuesday. understand actually results published nothing peer reviewed.

Misinformation peddling. Right it’s hope theory. wonder going trace back single elavator button Also keep mind there's 75+ million Americans 16 years old eligible vaccine. percentage actually even higher taking account eligible people only. Exactly. doubled everyone together to, keep people safe possible, I'd think completely differently. instead solidarity, many people pushed back good reason rebellious spiteful, resulted lives lost. Unfortunately see way, sad.

All citizens wear masks, socially distance, wash fucking hands regularly. Yet seen oppression. government properly supported industries forced shut down. little that, offer, made damn near impossible struggling companies get relief needed.

Hell, I'm still waiting 9 months backpay unemployment promised.

Instead everyone going partying thing ""over"", hold moment silence nationwide 30 minutes died pandemic. that'd ""inconvenient"" everyone, probably. stopped vaccinating people already would better shape Every 60 seconds minute passes Africa wrong, distribution capacity far exceeds supply. example, LA literally temporarily shut vaccination centers due lack supply. said true since January. touched another human live with, outside medical contact, almost year. rest immediate family. Mainstream media editors shitting pants right now. Thank youuuuuu Hey Fauci, want politics involved pandemic? I'm same. know ton people it, including high risk lung cancer survivor multiple elderly people, everyone got bit time. know, 2nd hand 2 people died one first hand who's anything bad flu took weeks get over. person know long term symptoms someone got early doctors still destroying everyone's lungs ventilators dialed 11. 10 months later, he's still oxygen. Ahhhgreeed. Like people write years like it’s biggie kids like younger it’s huge portion lives. friends missed much already. Wow, it’s almost like family might exception. Hard conceptualize know. Also unfortunate live world must consider interests around even naturally callous. Nobody stopping going outback. Israel get chosen case study, get everyone vaccinated country? Anyone know background that? Orgies Yes, absolutely has. Please stop spreading misinformation social media. 65% effective no? want it, got Pfizer one mean literally google numbers vaccines given per day going back mid December. It’s steadily increasing whole time. also know ton people had, including myself. primarily work live events restaurant industry early on. Perhaps it’s less geographically risks people personally know choose take lead higher rates infection. mention whole flatten curve thing initially sold preserving hospital capacity... whole hold achieved herd immunity (which may achievable anyway) bullshit another order. look Florida Switzerland see restrictions makes difference overall mortality completely seal Borders exist island one entirely different thing large interconnected landmasses much hope containing that. interpersonal life really quite lovely can't get together things outside house still interact much fun spite everything. hope good well. say I'm frightening paranoid distrust individuals. Gladly pick hitchhikers meet new people can't trust political parties repeatedly lied news continuously proven wrong. get trying help people seriously need think comes Global ID 24-hour tracking intersect right body. 65% effective care odds point need save themselves. can’t abandon good people healthcare workers stuck floundering. do: I’m mostly concerned J&amp;J general. recently came light hiding fact knew asbestos baby powder since ‘70’s. 

I’m vaccine one them. efficacy effectiveness. J&amp;j doesn’t absolute prevent virus, reduces weak cold basically 85-90%+ preventing severe covid results hospitalization death. mention weaker illness = reduced ability spread others. That’s huge. 


and there’s plenty people prefer j&amp;j wouldn’t get mRNA vaccines several reasons, including ability travel clinic twice general fear mongering picked news. Every little bit helps. keep reading doses coming. watch news stories doses given. hear good citizen take doses. I'm losing faith I'll ever given dose. So, vaccinated elderly, sick, politicians, well connected, front line medical first responders, athletes, pretty much everyone besides 18-64 year olds working fields. great! X million doses coming! one? ""Sometime summer"" guess :/ Thank you, hope everyone wants/needs get relatively soon. Learn read context doom life ignorance. Sounds like you’ve made choice. mean, - I'm drowning video games mind bandwidth left think haha. 13-year-old self would've loved this. 34-year-old self waiting vaccine... Everyone excited J&amp;J vaccine it’s garbage compared Pfizer Moderna? 66% effective overall per J&amp;J website....idk.. Bye Europe guess... fact even comparing Canada US they're anything remotely similar laughable best. Y'all ""defeated"" COVID mainly geography affects population density.

Get fuck undeserved high horse. Glad could get it, hopefully increasing supply let wife get soon. stop commenting then. Internet service server farms leave quite mark environment. 85% effective preventing severe cases. Probably nearly 100% preventing death. MIGHT unlucky get cold. Probably enough active cases around month catch easily. Holy misinformation campaign batman. 33% chance SEVERE case it. That's contracted infection, PERIOD. 

In vaccine, along others, 100% effectiveness preventing hospitalization.

ALSO efficacy take account different strains population time seemed way less mRNA vaccines tested. J&amp;J testing conducted significantly higher infections variants well. id

Uh oh, party line topic alert. compare Thailand Vietnam, certainly islands.

Point is, European countries built differently politically public cannot controlled easily. Also, people obsessed rights public good often left aside. would absurd way handle sign-ups appointments. Call local news (after make appointment). bad can't vote 500,000 times. pretty normal US international travel reach citizens. expensive requires lot time work. people ability take 2 weeks off. That's year's worth time jobs decent benefits. typical jobs impossible reach. Wow, that's really good know! 'handshakes' known  makes feel better, tends happen bit anyway university years go by! High median age, access healthcare, low black population. Boomers poor, oppressed subset? Boomers spiked real estate prices NIMBY policies everything restrict housing hurts property values? Boomers caused 2008 recession get-rich-quick schemes based exotic unsustainable investment vehicles?

Here's little something think about: Thanks artificially high housing costs, working professional mid 30's still home time. Basically real thing value time lifetime. even must taken protection Boomers, need ever everything, matter must taken from. Eventually people enough little stolen them. 2021 journalist, plenty good journalists covering Covid. story get published reputable US newspaper, need multiple sources confirm something like expert provide context, would likely meant number properly clarified reported.

The age 65+ underrepresented trials thing known awhile, mostly talked crackpot ex-reporters like Alex Berensen wanted journalist did: shoot hip anything confirms bias.

Otherwise, AstraZeneca government's shady ""no comment"" response screams something hide. leaked ""draft"" recommendations saying vaccine used age 65+ icing cake. comedy errors, good journalistic process (like major papers use) would've shaken truth out. work USA try travel abroad least twice year, 3 weeks though. I'm going go back contractor soon though much time I'm financially okay with, specific goal traveling more. ridiculous 2 weeks standard here, treat workers like shit country. hear you, people level immunity, harder disease spread. Regardless vaccine got, never get exposed get infected Daily cases US average third peak earlier year. Daily cases Canada Germany also around third peaks. Daily deaths US 60% peak value, Canada Germany 30% 40% respectively.

Whatever causing decline, US specific. I'm completely impressed vaccination efficiency US has, countries named seeing recent decline cases death rates. claim understand it, I'm generally cheered same. I'm skeptical last sentence, appreciate positivity! collectively across globe experiencing trauma. 

Agreed, spare thought many us already facing trauma pandemic... big west coast cities still like this. majority people wear mask even outside nobody within 10 feet them.

That’s funny, wasn’t long ago I’ve seen post similar sentiment everything back normal March. It’s almost like wild optimism expertise area... It’s unclear far know. We’re getting verdict vaccines already administered. seems like would least reduce risk transmitting it, since almost eliminates serious illness, serious illness covid linked higher viral load Pfizer: ""I actually Moderna: ""Me J&amp;J: ""meh"" Funny left data. It’s 85% effective preventing severe covid 100% hospitalization death Wow, look you, back tracking already. conspiracy theorists loud ballsy they’re expected actually put skin game? Fuck off, dude. Get help. I’ve gotten rounds vaccine already I’m glad ability travel see people without endangering lives innocent people, I’m selfish paranoid fuck literally needs seek mental help. takes time lot subjects get good enough sample group get statistics might give meaningful correlation ... it’s still correlation may taking account factors result incorrect link. violating widely upheld principle medical information withheld patients, limited try make work claiming donors 'patients' (although Red Cross USA appears give donors antibody test results, authorities feel strongly behavioral theories + public health simply flouting principle one case, stance warrants serious skeptical attention (and say someone favor strong anti-Covid measures). response saying hand-picking individual countries make solid argument pick second? That's genuinely hilarious.

It's also interesting happened choose two countries among worst affected COVID (3rd 6th deaths per capita) compare to. I'm aware that. That's said ""much Europe"", many European countries imposed much harsher US, i.e. several countries severely limited outdoor socializing, severe limits far travel home, France 6 PM curfew, etc. remember work getting NYT news alert phone US reached total 1000 confirmed cases country thinking ""I feel like work rn, feels like getting control"" celebrating state gets 1000 new cases / day. totally get it, funny perspective change know we're riding wave vs riding up. don’t think fair. Many us US hunkered homes almost year point. tax dollars subsidized vaccines. Yeah. definitely better nothing, I'm glad one I'm getting. wait see December. waited. saw. works. exactly said going do. Monmouth. understand multiple people checking daily weeks. I'm ready see Steve Harrington beat shit like Demogorgon feel like 100 million vaccines 100 days actually feasible now. things certainly helped.

What also helped social distancing targetted lockdowns.

But know Americans like attention span goldfish understand that. J&amp;J vaccine still basically eliminates risk serious illness, current pace, seems like could likely get one two-dose vaccines midsummer really long wait

Also keep mind effective rate isn’t risk getting Covid, percent reduction (so Pfizer, risk reduced 95%). don’t 100% chance getting infected, 66% reduction already-somewhat-small chance infection really quite good. Yeah man, check bushes 😉 though research increasingly suggests it’s unlikely

If looks increasingly unlikely, need reevaluate messaging around vaccines. already know whole lot people getting vaccine “it won’t even stop giving someone COVID”. Public health messaging abysmal since day one pandemic overestimate much power US has. Sterile fill finish takes x number days (usually 30+) fill verify contamination non negotiable. doses shipping March already manufactured. additional supply improved logistics. Well still eat garbage, forage,and hunt. guarantee allowed purchase food hold job live normal life. un vaccinated become new class blamed society's problems. bet 5k papers live normal life two years seems like political compromise. sure public health officials plan, pols got involved went, well XYZ. get votes. etc. Ok, 12,500 strippers live Key West? never knew!

A lot states started 65 skipped essential workers. already gone best epidemiologists country recommended. it’s cut dry may implying. Still Biden’s fault. Folks like Joe Manchin hand anyone say that? said keeping hand sanitisation stations around getting people feel bit weather due cold flue wear mask. one said stop things add hygiene. virus suppressed people wearing masks, washing hands interacting others. 100M ""option"". Exactly. getting bent shape, vaccine that’s bit iffy. aren’t even due get Oxford doses, start supply surge mNRA vaccines. 

Please Biden, send Europe...so stop complaining AstraZ/UK/USA/Israel screwing over. gloating lol, thought interesting fast situation changes. Here....


“If look projection, would imagine time get April, would call, better wording, open season, virtually anybody everybody category could start get vaccinated,” Fauci said. “From on, would likely take several months, logistically, get vaccine people’s arms, hopefully get middle end summer, accomplished goal we’re talking about, namely overwhelming majority people country gotten vaccinated.”

Lmao go. try twist turn argument let’s examine stated.

Your statement: average joe able get early 2022

Reality: Fauci claims “anyone everyone” eligible get (in words, average joes eligible get vaccine, obviously every single person vaccinated average joes getting vaccinated summer. Which, opposite claim)

Ok dumb good day didn’t instant test, one new saliva tests. know Merck German.

It even says Germany’s Merck KGaA

Merck KGaA nothing Merck &amp; Co. US. Two different companies.

They already supplying lipids needed Biontech, due increased mRNA vaccine production, ""accelerating"" supplies. Who?  keep spamming misinformation. AZ contract UK agreed well EU. EU/AZ contract states delivery dependent upon 'prior' commitments met. EXPORT BAN ffs.

Plus Macron dissing AZ vaccine without data crime here, also take look Germany currently 600k AZ doses taken 'public mistrust' fostered mnedia.. mean France's debt going skyrocket. watching debate French business news day, basically thinking pushing debt back 2 3 generations, grandkids greatgrandkids pay tax increase, meantime sit 

Seriously? Jesus Christ. totally fucking global climate leaving uninhabitable planet going bad enough. might turn balls blue, might not. instant test useless even symptoms accuracy rate 50s like randomly guessing yes 600,000 worldwide? ""tendecy"", trying bend OP said lol

Imagine going Uruguay say corrupt country latin american countries corrupt legal systems. factually right? that's OP said. bad idiots using excuse say coronavirus isn’t real flu. I’m glad don’t understand think. falsehood:

they expect **ship** 50 million **to US** April.. test flu like covid? test that’s routinely done diagnose flu? it’s legitimate discussion debate covid cases flu? someone less decade said age group, folks attitude downright frighten me. market demand also includes wealthy people wanting park money somewhere. increasing inflation low bond yields, many good options, happy buy properties sit them. interest rates higher, option would less attractive speculators. Ok, flu kills 600.000 people year come back much stronger next winter year immunities declined. could justify locking every winter on, looking 200.000 - 1.000.000 deaths flu, something know prevent? Multiple years, boosters necessary. Maybe maybe busy dealing pandemic unpopular opinion - US Pharma companies far efficient innovative asthma med jumped $40 $500.

The drug companies share warm room Hell Texas energy suppliers.  exactly easy flipping switch toilet paper factory. knows much… article say banned exports? certainly consider working there. seem place giving orders right now. think EU commission would wanting keep head down. They're shipped within US. said totally unrelated issues Europe. Actually read comment dude. seen daily comment threads?  Even came bulletproof evidence they’re dumb enough think covid isn’t big deal they’re smart enough change minds thinking every cold except flu.  tire easily ""you need respect opinions!"" bullshit anti-vaxxers. propaganda absolutely costs lives. 

That said...I know Israel wish America would louder fact ACOG well respected institutions recommending pregnant breastfeeding women vaccinated. feel like message vaccines yet tested population drowned everything else. Breastfeeding mom here, twice vaccinated Pfizer hesitate. 130m full vaccinations! idea getting downvoted speaking sense. Pre covid, employers pretty much told people come work sorts illnesses hope release germs exist spread employees customers. working sick productive us infact make even ill stress. get flu every year like clockwork. 2020 present, flu. fact, yet talk family member got flu. live Southern California.  Janssen OWNED J&amp;J, forgot tell us little part. What's false it? literally said unrelated! EU really help companies set-up costs research, unlike US UK

Source much EU invested vaccine research/development production please (so EU invested contract). Including individual member states investments, count investment EU production well. Also sources numbers UK EU bet companies failed, Sanofi (vaccine said launch 2022) making brands vaccines France (starting next month)

How much Sanofi vaccines EU order, percentage current total EU supply Sanofi? many Sanofi doses US UK Compared UK/US, EU haggled prices down, tried prevent members negotiating doses alone, etc. resulted countries going alone getting Sputnik vaccine

AstraZeneca prices cost. point relevance. paid Moderna vaccines paid less vaccines. matter... high ground

AZ's initial goal deliver 300 million doses Q1 Q2. planning deliver 130 million doses. talking 170 million doses initial goal. cannot high ground miss targets 170 million vaccine doses 6 months. Even contractually obliged deliver amounts. since August time make sure deliver enough doses. means deliver 130 millionth dose, 9 months preparation deliver vaccines, still whopping 170 million vaccines. received hundreds million euros make sure production facilities ready. massive fail AstraZeneca.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, way, UK officially signed contract base deliveries August 28t, one day EU. supply also completely relies ""best reasonable efforts"".  Let guess, also think random coincidence signed Pfizer revealed Trump administration taken offer order vaccines them. order basically forced Pfizer contract production US.
I would also recommend checking order, might surprised wording. Uh... end major holidays? ranked 94th Mexico ranked 124th. That’s half population Latin America.

So population size countries dictates every country given region LOL

The gift keeps giving. penalty clauses EU/AZ contract late delivery, pretending surprised much anyone Export ban vs contractual agreement. Nice little factual error slipped :) TLDR, UK study showed two shots Pfizer (likely moderna) 86% effectiveness stopping infection (i.e. person cannot transmit vaccinated). fantastic finding backs Israeli study released days ago. hoped, count on, vaccines suppressing disease extent. result R0 collapsing people get vaccinated. executive order Trump signed December (early December) basically toothless. reason Moderna Pfzier exporting US due contracts, due executive order.  late December (after EO), Pfizer still planning using US production supply globe starting Q2.  came agreement witht US change that, saw get priority certain components order speed production US got doses.

And Pfizer giving EU benefits well, likely result negotiations.  75 million additional doses Q2 one them. also... let's forget vaccine attacks spike protein, natural infection results immunity whole virus, unfortunate world virus mutates need spike protein, vaccine useless. LOL. Sure Jan. 

Oxford Groupies making things upvote. Where'd read that? People subreddit always throw around numbers like 35 40 percent USA doubt lot talk subreddit people desire property, prefer others take hassle comes property ownership? live? Property owners rent properties provide service least segment population find preferable. know, MORONS hopefully employers might force people cold flu come infact everyone.  wouldn’t waste time. They’re stupid Actually AZ shipped 8 million doses US EU recently. EU factory ship single dose US. comment sour falsehood Merck 

Didn't know Merck close collaboration BioNTech, significantly accelerate supply urgently needed lipids **increase amount lipid delivery towards end 2021**,” Merck said statement Friday.

Yeah, supply towards end 2021 make huge difference February 2021. [Unfortunately data beyond interesting see extremely large increase number vaccines year.

Years past would walk local grocery store pharmacy say give shot. year due COVID schedule even wait almost hour since backed many people wanting flu shot.

While discount efforts masks distancing telling see stupid high percentage increase flu vaccine 2020 lockdowns became necessary people bothered taking minimal precautions prevent spread. Oh, Trump crew playing politicizing whole thing. one wants lockdowns selfish assholes made necessary. Oh fuck oh oh Could still worse. 90 million doses delivered better 0, firms delivered.  Walgreens still works, Rite Aid either. Plus link directly page signups location listed. general link main store vaccination page seems. site locations NJ offering vaccines. constantly We're safe everyone vaccinated, yes let's share help other. say British people's fault. UK government enforced AZ export ban,and allow AZ use contractual factories EU (in UK) fulfill EU orders.

The british people voted though, yet matters matter almost sounds like disappointed British people dying, honest dude coming bit hateful nationalistic.

Nah, slap export ban costing lives, forcing private company fulfill contractual obligations absolutely disgusting - that's trying justify European deaths definition ""best possible effort"" different UK Belgium.

You talk like UK hoarding production vaccine sort achievement, that's nationalistic - fact - **it's definition vaccine nationalism** friend.

I'm calm :) , maybe like read truth lol Welcome future. both, stupid malicious. say they’re going miss targets Europe huge amount time saying US FDA approves vaccine deliver 50 million doses end April.  Pfizer? Pfizer expanded invested Belgium plant global workhorse, made contracts countries expectation able use factory supply global orders. 

If EU restricted exports Pfizer, yes, countries would retaliate completely cutting off, countries made contracts plans based fact Pfizer global production. restricted exports, Pharma companies would think twice investment EU.  

I sympathize Belgium EU, also expectation planning.

Also don’t forget millions people haven’t in-person school work helps tremendously spread  Starting year ago, every pharmaceutical company dog began trying develop COVID vaccine. succeeded far, planned going succeed developed infrastructure began obtaining supplies particular vaccine. companies rework infrastructure (and gain expertise needed making mRNA vaccines) probably take months, still hope vaccine approved within months. kind varied. hurt, like weird pain, back, kidneys, lungs time mostly fading now.

Maybe made even 1/10th effort could keep flu bay too.  sure US world massive flu vaccination push year, probably explains reduction. significant reduction international travel also contributing reduction influenza. Influenza typically spikes Southern Hemisphere summer, spreads via travel northern hemisphere spikes winter. Plus masks, distancing, increased hand washing/cleaning, working home, reduced use public transit, reduced domestic travel, isolation individuals respiratory symptoms, etc...Many factors seem helped suppress flu year, suppressed number COVID cases far level would experienced without containment measures. Coronavirus also infectious there’s pre-existing immunity, it’s introduced it’s much harder control. There's risk everything do. point, COVID never going away. 50 relatively healthy, risk severe illness extremely low--probably less hurt automobile accident point year. still drive places? vulnerable around you, ability get vaccinated soon already. weigh risk influence news social media minimized want able without bias.

This outrageous, honestly baffles many willing justify it. may minority agree you. deny possible J&amp;J reduces transmission degree, based trial data mainly seems alleviate Covid symptoms much reducing transmission long hauler. unless research shows effective long hauler somehow actually reduces infection rate, there's reason assume that. use vaccine let virus spread makes Covid ""like flu"" risk seeing huge wave long haulers, organ damage blood clots. would mean lots disability, much hospitalizations deaths Covid another financial crisis.

Another issue J&amp;J 66% effective **moderate** disease. vaccines assessed based performance symptomatic disease, including mild, one actually much less effective people think is. means [like AstraZeneca, likely hit required threshold preventing Covid infection herd 

Another concern vaccines provide partial immunity [they stop virus know vaccines (e.g. Pfizer, Moderna Novavax, Novavax would require booster SA variant) provide fuller immunity much likely actually help reduce transmission achieve herd immunity end shit all. we're choosing gamble risk prolonging nightmare even longer.

It isn’t me, it’s people aren’t healthy enough get vaccine, immunocompromised people, people cancer, young kids.

So yeah, care everyone circle getting vaccinated. Deeply.

We need care arms length right? told, AstraZeneca’s total supply EU could 130 million doses end June, well 300 million committed deliver bloc then.

Teachers, doctors, grocery store workers, public-facing jobs much ability protect themselves, many people choice avoid COVID don't. widespread incorrect notion wearing mask staying six feet apart magic bullet, anyone gets covid *just responsible!*, completely anti-science utterly disdainful get virus.

That true, people mostly staying home people going huge parties. six feet plus mask magic bullet, six feet+mask+outdoors pretty damn close magic bullet. provide sources showing low rate outdoor infection. level normal masks school, activities, stores. Maybe that’s much ask end school year, I’m hoping it. summer pretty much normal last year I’ve regularly seeing friends since basically April I’m waiting things control ‘normal’. I’d surprised current administration takes turn “watered down” vaccine territory many still unwilling get vaccine all. 

I don’t even know public messaging would even look like. 

America collectivist culture. can’t even get half coworkers wear mask. 😂 family 10 children, likely either vaccinated not. parents decide vaccinate one kid could reach average. average meaningful entire world. look particular community, vaccination rate might low. point concerned evictions cash strapped behind payments. They'll wait moratorium. Nope!

Covid-19 caused SARS-CoV-2 virus, coronavirus (SARS MERS also caused coronaviruses, SARS-CoV MERS-CoV respectively, coronaviruses cause consider common colds, though colds caused rhinoviruses).

The flu caused influenza viruses (with names like H1N1 H3N2).

Coronaviruses influenza viruses different phylum. reference, mammals, birds, reptiles (and animals) phylum other, insects different one mollusks another.

The Covid vaccine developed quickly flu vaccine, companies working vaccines SARS MERS years, able apply research.  get he's saying though. hard understand easy transmits life, seems hard get.

It took friends almost entire year going every friday/saturday night, traveling, around eachother get it. 

My parents never got live 950 sq. ft. house them.

My grandmother never gave grandfather slept bed her. 

My aunts uncles ate multiple times week entire period could, never got it. 

I get easy catch, *can* see people think otherwise. wearing two masks despite vaccinated, that's I'm trying ""be living example."" live state COVID19 restrictions we've hit pretty hard. qualms unmasked around vaccinated people, though. I'm sure I'm plenty safe unmasked, community isn't. airborne real sense. water droplets. Measles floats air. Czech Republic warned country’s health system brink “absolute exhaustion” may need help abroad, central Europe braces third wave coronavirus pandemic.   past two weeks country recorded 968 new cases coronavirus per 100,000 people, EU’s highest infection rate per-capita terms, forcing many hospitals delay non-Covid-related treatment. Exactly. news already couple weeks old, happened immediately minor scandal Sweden everyone called idiots forced retract everything Frankly I’d much rather taxes go towards rent relief paying 29.5 cents every federally taxed dollar fund military. think competitors hypothesized one shot would effective, proven yet. proven two shots provide substantial immunity. 

In case, I'd rather guarantee high risk individuals. I'll sign one shot study, know that's experiment, guarantees table. we're nearing 40% prioritized population least one shot

with supply expanding J&amp;J adding pile surprised anyone wants shot make appointment april 1st get fully vaccinated memorial day people washing hands, they're wearing masks, socially distancing flu virulent covid. everybody every winter would make heck difference flu cases. make sense. impression likely transmit objects.

Was one wearing mask unlucky? according dad's cardiologist covid really impacting pre-existing heart conditions. doc skeptical severity early pandemic, he's seen number patients mild, well-controlled heart conditions wind hospital, surprise. advanced heart diseases make back home. So, cardiologist says get shot, delay. Take it! Yeah! Somewhat fair, would say 45's failures spread pretty evenly across planning, response, ordering distribution. essentially closed eyes, plugged ears, shouted ""na-na-na-na"" months. AZ already produced millions doses US keeping stockpile gets FDA approval. point doses going expire..  mRNA uncertain new vaccine, including JJ’s vector vaccine. mRNA vaccines tested longer time, people. I'm privy details, likely vendor vial size that, written contract. Now, want contract modification mean, could next owner evict law bans current owner so?

My understanding even building owner changes tenant can't forced out.  politics. Sweden (which one two countries AZ based) problem scheduling many Heath care workers get AZ vaccine day. Result same: massive problems minor side effects made staff unfit work next day. fucking plastic garbage :( Thanks much linking this! Also wanted share added Twitter bot: notify people whenever new vaccine slot becomes available 854k doses? don’t stack like that.  someone trying enter workforce, hope go hybrid normally. like office vibes internships, Jfc commuting sucks. Also, environmental impact reduction alone make worth it. That's would prefer. Essential workers age 50 55 priority. 

Deaths 20-40 low. heard story symptom NPR months ago. said people lose sense like hearing vision report depression immediate aftermath, year reported well-being typically back baseline. contrast, people completely lose sense smell taste tend report mental well-being fine first, gradually declines time year out, commonly report depression. reason suggested smell taste strongly anchored memory emotion, food drink people used enjoy longer triggers positive emotional reaction, smells provided emotional coloring memories gone, leaving world seeming dull lifeless. Sounds like prepared unforeseen circumstances, like people say working person gets pushed onto street unforeseen personal tragedy. I’m definitely suggesting it’s over. unless new super virulent virus mutation going avoid mRNA vaccine protection, never go back spring 2020 winter 2021 numbers. Vaccines going plentiful within month two anyone wants vaccinate would able summer. actually responding person seemed like were, responding person head said predict Still far cry April, though

Also April, though, originally projected.

But saying First March

I think want complain lol think flu magically disappeared last year?... Welcome capitalism. huge portion public, that's afford. far I'm concerned, things ""normal"", restriction wise, back January 1st, 2020. exactly?

Because one right mind ever define ""best effort"". blatant breach contract full stop. 

It's disappointed. Considering distribution fraction doses six fucking months hugely unacceptable ""being disappointed"". sure exact math, would something like 115 million shots 140 million one shot. Yeah, numbers...

By July, we'll vaccinate adults. That's like 260M total. those, likely 70% want get vaccinated, we're 180M, 360M shots. 60M already given, 300M remaining.

Pfizer alone deliver 50M month soon. pessimistic, Moderna half that, two produce enough well end July everyone covered.

And rate, expect many people even want J&amp;J, good. already see AZ unpopular many countries, even they're much desperate vaccine supply. north 95% factor obesity body fat percentage, considering 92% Americans metabolically unhealthy. thing though, we’ll never know holding 1 1.5+ years herd immunity “right.” know, focused isolating protecting vulnerable (elderly and/or high-risk) beginning vaccine ready, mild distancing restrictions rest us, it’s entirely possible could gradually achieved herd immunity months ago, newest variants even emerged. Good point fatigue.

I’ll counter “you know know,” meaning might think good amount energy, it’s much have. might know you’ve never there.

When Epsworth sleepiness scale score 6, sleep test showed getting awful sleep.

If interested it, either get WatchPAT (through Lofta/Amazon) ARES Watermark, done comfort bed, score RDI order diagnose UARS. RDI 5/hr generally diagnostic.

Doesn’t hurt check! Good luck :-) Fingers crossed happens soon. past 12 months rough us especially US UK r/UpliftingNews advocate tiered system first. realize makes sense (at least way they’re trying it). correct. state released number people estimates priority tier. time get “general population” ~10% population lol. 

Also, keep adding different groups people first tier haven’t even left stage yet. know never going super smooth process, it’d slow going, I’ve pretty disappointed. They’re still estimating could take well March move first tier :/. Joo can't handle real woman Carl Johnson! I’m impatiently waiting shots. I’m last group. Hoping summer I’ll first shot. good news starting get hard shout down. would absolutely love could spend Easter family. soon hospitalizations deaths plummet small number per day, masks gonna gone it’s going open season. guess vulnerable populations 1st dose mid-March, 2nd dose early April, see hospitalizations deaths crater April. it’s gen population open season vaccine appointments rules everywhere loosened significantly. It’s midnight east. Anybody want bet prediction changes breakfast? Agreed! vaccinating everyone Pfizer Moderna. 

There’s going certain number people unwilling get another vaccine. They’ll get J&amp;J call good enough. delaying 2nd dose would cut total infected people faster, reducing chances mutation well transmission new variant. future data supports already shown, really logical argument sticking current schedule. argument ""I'll feel better knowing both"", can't let thousands people die tens thousands go hospital make others feel good. yea, it'll full smug canadians hiding homes waiting vaccines (source: canadian). Yep it’s sad reality... primary care doc said wasn’t state...yet state mentions organ transplant weakened autoimmune ...(stuck Jpouch). least I’ve making lot music works busy keep occupied home... it’s frustrating hearing friends acting like life’s normal. Last time called clear backfired **spectacularly** them.

Yes vaccine game changer, states Federal government likely gun shy happened last summer everything seemed ok, hell broke loose late fall. seems like want hit critical mass vaccinations first starting loosen up. long term effects catching COVID? J&amp;J seems like weak bandaid. I’ll keep isolating wait can’t get Pfizer Moderna. well, look stupid would significantly less them, any. many current mutations came developing world? Man. trauma last year flooding back tears going that. Poignant pictures. swear people going 3 week old data. numbers dropping. Fast. obvious hospitals overrun, get back normal. cares variants hospitals going overrun? we're afraid yet emerge variants, stop covid? virus could mutate well. Shall wear masks, socially distance, close schools, stop mass gatherings common cold may day mutate dangerous version itself? Great, get line that? still needs properly studied. trials show that, I'll it.  never said transmission. herd immunity mean prevents least 50% (ideally 70%+) infections (the different types AZ vaccine significantly reduce transmission vaccine stop it

It not. Based trials reduces 27% asymptomatic infections 62% **symptomatic** infections. Asymptomatic infections make around 30% infections, means prevents roughly 51% infections. also know basically useless SA variant. Add margin error drops 50%. Pfizer, Moderna Novavax (Novavax needs booster SA variant though) much better chance hitting threshold they're much effective AstraZeneca. don’t get eye. Already house warming party lined must show proof vaccination summer. That’s random date picking considering it’s still almost 2 months away. Wonder reasoning supply issues, anyone actually wants it, go get July. we're done July; maybe August, count second dose. supposed different July October though? wish cases would drop faster, less cases higher chance summer somewhat ""normal"" I’m expert whatsoever, remember reading passing weeks ago studied along pregnancy that’s generally better giving early since fever (which common vaccines) isn’t good first trimester.

And I’m also guessing/speculating wanted wait pregnancies well past point miscarriages due chromosomal abnormalities commonly happen ensure consistently studying outcomes likely healthy, viable pregnancies make study complicated, drawn out, expensive, etc. (like investigate report adverse outcomes like miscarriage might common - unrelated vaccine - included first trimester subjects). it’s longer emergency stop treating like one Interesting. Thanks link. Wouldn’t surprised something similar. Northern CA case tho. part ""he walked back timeline"" comprehend?  J&amp;J vaccine marketing blitz reduced effectiveness. bad leaders healthcare vaccinated. would liked see one take Moderna/Pfizer. believe so? think much say dose get. available provider when. I'd prefer single dose. banking able get it. Look who’s laughing  hasn’t given indication would quite sure would unable suggest mechanism would.

There many many women world right choosing mitigate REAL risk covid poses pregnancy vaccinating consultation doctors.

So yeah - kinda know.  That's hell mental image, like it! Good news! loss taste smell permanent! hated speaking truth feel like that's optimistic time line. downer. realistic. Damn I’m sorry. Gyms open state masks. Restaurants open bars clubs till 4am. fatality rates states massive lock downs place. Hope y’all get back gym soon! might Los Angeles. Specific community organizations serve low income communities color special codes give residents easily sign new Cal State site (fed gov) Forum site (county gov). Something like 10% appointments set aside code won’t booked quickly higher income people. realized codes leaking totally ineligible people actually getting vaxxed seems like going crack down. genocide negligence. contribution telling people shine UV arse take chloroquine, work. talk about, it.  Remember presidential debate Trump said vaccine would ready winter moderator questioned saying experts believe summer earliest?

That really funny. like schools predictably obfuscated infections cause since it’s rare kids symptomatic Thats even true. Fauci calling pass Democrats stimulus package. many people delusional summer. 

It’s going summer 2019. saying impact fertility/pregnancy, definitely hast around long enough properly study it. Oof. Phrasing... every vaccine still allows *some* transmission, past experience predicts significant reduction transmission. however, much data yet, still wait sure. all, herd immunity proyected set-nov vaccinations rate  **Feb. 23, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Regardless, quote excerpted Reuters indicates that's exactly Fauci meant: 

""“There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.”

Fauci explicitly states there's reason walking around mask, diminishes utility wearing mask four times: ""might make people feel little better"", ""might even block droplet"", ""but providing perfect protection people think is"", ""often unintended consequences"". 

But oh no, Trump haters yourself, ""no reason"" four diminutives mention efficacy means Fauci fact extolling necessity efficacy wearing masks. mean, obviously. sorry father's condition, hope comes this. However, term used virus needlessly inflammatory and, noticed, caused kerfuffle below. reason, I'm taking comment -- please avoid future.

Best wishes! true it’s longer true.

come play game i'll test ya lol It’s still clear read statement. 

Honestly, I’ll wear mask I’m sick cold go out. countries courtesy think makes lot sense, countries much better US. that’ll choice.

In terms mandates, cases get low, masks mandates go away. Fauci devil. follows numbers. Numbers go low enough, mask mandates go away.

What “false projections” saying? outlook always bad because, like you, sense duty. went tough dutiful country whiny lazy. comments indicate also, would taken lot longer arrive community air travel common. Yeah unilaterally overrule president obsessed winning reeelection cost American lives thought remarkable early way would overcome this, vaccine. remember reading people still going cruises tickets non refundable. time knew little virus spread deadly was. obvious people going act stupidly Covid. Spread basic lack interest greater good. I’m mad lost year mid 20s this. ... really January many fuzz AZ... need start sorting old news Reddit... European, tell Europe country countries same.  far, studies suggest one dose one mRNA vaccines effective J&amp;J shot. 

Have upvote. yet peer reviewed, they're referencing pre-print paper, yet peer-reviewed. notice paywall prior posting, accessed article signs paywall. Long covid likely body staying inflammatory state infection passes (auto antibodies maybe?). cause different symptoms, mean diagnosis likely real time research goes it. mean, yeah, got me. Silly referring US data responding article written American, American publication, whose *first sentence* discusses US data rest article. dozen people know it, youngest one (our 19 year old neighbor) one long term symptoms.

Decided graduate I’m gonna finish prerequisites nursing school program graduated different degree. 

Hoping give another chance experience something got taste of. Plenty FDA regulations. determines vaccine cannot legally marketed for. Same... got covid part small outbreak work. 

None us “long haulers”. 

I hate discrediting people claiming suffering, 30% seems way high real. USA definitely one highest reported deaths. trust rest world accurately report Covid deaths would disagree. Even half people wore masks medical facilities alone far better majority world. doubt great, definitely believe second highest. variants seem like desperation attempt virus honestly. think it’s losing knows situation here, actually. better worse, Americans real fond told really dealt lockdowns well. lot folks, end appears near authority type step say ""Yeah, we're going see papers allow X, Z"" going fly. average joe tolerate it, small businesses tolerate big businesses open record business middle sure hell tolerate it.

It's possible airlines cruise industry (If comes back anytime soon) go route while, movie theaters restaurants retail never go along it.  defend Trump early discussions covax involved vaccines purchased Covax. original plan global rollout countries receiving initial allotment enough vaccine 3% population cover medical workers, 20% cover vulnerable members population. bureaucratic political games involved would nightmare. link want check out. right, fire directly. But, political appointees could.

In addition, Fauci recommend full lockdown publicly. However, sure make recommendation president told shut up? difference make real world? even wildest number long covid true (1/3) that's still mostly sampling people hospilized large glaring issue one talking about: USA aloneost experts say likely double official case count means long covid number even lower. transmissible! /s Actually lately seems like there’s lot logic lot less fear mongering. Probably due vaccines positive news it’s bad recently I’ve seen 1 2 ICU survivors every fatality. High probability system(s) damaged mental trauma. 

~ 5-10 major hospitalizations (inclusive ICU) per fatality. research UK suggested ~ third noticable issues months on.

What know rate complications out-of-hospital pneumonia patients, often termed ""moderate COVID."" beds scarce extend ""everyone tolerable O2."" unbelievably stupid people still believe Sweden country lock down, lol really hope reward shit that’s happened past year absolutely amazing summer. Last summer state 100-300 cases entire state per day, summer spots basically covid free. year it’ll undoubtedly better, I’m looking forward bringing friends haven’t seen summerhouse toast surviving mess According CDC it’s estimated 4.6x people Covid reported. would bring number estimated 130 million infected.

That still means 2x many people could still get infected, don’t get wrong would mean even deaths, it’s definitely 10% population infected first jab. still EUA preventing severe illness, preventing spread. see there...

(Begrudgingly clicks 'upvote') Can't wait shot January 2023! Verge really medical site, Independent problems.

That explain result happen. household/friends/family fully vaccinated, what’s first thing you’ll do? 

(Assume thing you’d like won’t closed due restrictions). You’re monster long covid isn’t diagnosis. It’s million different things lumped one label. 

30 percent suffer long-covid? 

30 percent people also suffering anxiety due pandemic. 

Many symptoms long-covid also symptoms anxiety.

How many people actually mistaking anxiety long covid? Obviously 30 percent, are. problem long-covid doesn’t actually mean anything it’s big umbrella. extremely hard study. You’re trying compare tons factors hard measure. example peoples mobility states. weather affect things? demographics state effect things. local measures effect things. None easy compare even track. Hot damn. don’t drugs pem. That's us breaking point forced closures distancing requirements.

I'm another year I'm alone, I'm vaccinated reason to, risk low point. Restricting exports putting America first. first started thought there's way America we're gonna successfully get people stay home quarantine. surprised many people stayed home started. Things started get hairy around mid-May states reopened individually mask mandates private businesses became popular. keep wearing mask bit longer, 

Into 2022 ""just bit longer"" though. 

I'm really starting wonder ultimate goal masks permanent everyday requirement expectation. Sound crazy? Look TSA air travel things accept totally normal completely inconceivable 9/11 happened. case repeatedly shown TSA almost nothing increase safety. saying, nuance topic? dare you, everything black white around here. 28,000,000 cali variant variants...and we’re still opening closing. Pretty sure ship sailed covid majority. Take precautions? Absolutely. Wake every morning thinking UK, cali, Brazil etc variants? Lol nah Europe largest economic market world. also one wealthiest regions planet. also home significant drug vaccine research manufacturing industry. reason drug companies would intentionally put continent back queue. 

I think said done, find differences EU approached vaccine purchases managed suppliers, resulted deliveries front queue. Asbestos children! Canada already solved using precision syringes extract much needed one dose more. Unless they're suggesting pooling would step beyond that. Oh, stand corrected, holy shit, let's go. think projections little optimistic, realize numbers changed much short period time. reported 85% effective ""severe"". know report publicly?

If still understand, imaginative.  UK highest flu vaccine take-up every among elderly world, subset population likely tested flu (and risk it) Depression anxiety causes autoantibodies lupus-like symptoms? Yeah, no. Thrombosis? Yeah, no. 

Locked ages? study done US. locked ages. 

Should tell people suffer post viral syndrome viruses need see therapist? ""Oh, got ebola prolonged health issues? depressed need chipper up."" Fact matter people attribute long COVID anxiety depression really misinformed SARS-CoV-2 body immunological standpoint. narrowing specific set autoantibodies lead long COVID symptoms arise direct result infection, even mild cases. 45% Georgia teachers say want vaccine.

There's four groups:

1. People really want vaccine trying skip line right (screw you).

2. People want vaccine patiently waiting line.

3. People get vaccine easy rush.

4. People get vaccine (screw you).

Each one probably 1/4. Nope it’s way technically correct. technically correct statement isn’t sufficient information draw conclusion Phase 3 trials 65s. factually incorrect say it’s 8% effective people like Macron say it’s quasi-ineffective isn’t data show either way. agree, wife person teaching still eligible. NYC actually one place hospitals actually overflowing (like Lombardy), sent nursing home residents back liberate beds. It’s feeling control, matter small. said dependent numerous factors, including many people choose get vaccinated. Realistically probably be, enough people vaccinate, maybe reality (one want, certainly possible). 

He's laying possible scenario. still said likely next Winter pretty much normal. never said better. want point always rogue behavior crisis. agree you, long don’t delay vaccination wait vaccine, potentially longer time. it’s time get vaxxed, get vaxxed. Thing - know vaccine better. different trials different endpoints, different populations, different methods. they're compared study, one know. I.e, people like hate AZ-vaccine, trial tested every participant regularly. Pfizer Moderna didn't, potentially missing lots cases. Scottish data yesterday, points direction AZ equal, better, Pfizer keeping old people hospital. J&amp;J included South African variants, Pfizer Moderna - could keep going things different, makes vaccines impossible compare. best vaccine get first approved vaccine get, surroundings.  live NCY wife ones paid rent floor apartment complex now. everyone job working floor governor put eviction thing one evicted moment. owe thousands pay covid ends evicted. sad part probably wont funds pay able rent another apartment hit credit. 

So assume daddy government come wipe credit pay bill them. inevitable rug pull ok mind government allow us vaccine yet take away mandate retailers let people maskless? way knowing checking vaccine.

Masks mandated least everyone allowed vaccine. Yea, they’re crappy subreddit posting 22k flu hospitalizations becoming 200 proof COVID flu CDC reclassifying people COVID, reasons. partner unvaccinated one girl’s son different girl’s BF. 3 unvaccinated people involved total. son rarely goes house though, homeschooled.  saw Federal Backbone Lollapalooza area taken putting name vaccine available name clinic VAMS people try register wrong location second shot. Welding people houses worse threat sheriff. It’s even that. Look Israel damn vaccine stops spread itself. People hesitant wrong nobody wants come flat say ANYTHING let’s face idea going really don’t know coming this. 

I gotten nobody sick killed mean NOBODY. haven’t dentist year haven’t cut hair even year haven’t eaten single damn time single time eaten outside home. year.

I’ll dammed anyone going guilt trip insane efforts. I’m vaccinated part. Period. people hard time letting go. hundreds cases day hardly deaths summer it’s safe shit again. Period.  sure getting downvoted. right still need get around 200 million people fully vaccinated West Coast state, Pfizer delivered yesterday. Moderna expected tomorrow. partner uncomfortable attending thanks input!  expect states open vaccination age groups sometime April. 

That said may still difficult get appointment. expect end May early June easy adult get appointment. 

In terms everyone wants getting both, would guess July, though cases may low levels restrictions lifted. man didn’t think were. point ‘Europe’ personally. people wash hands stay home sick. definitely social stigma going work going sick. Yes, although self-inflicted states. wanted optimize could. There's reason week shipment factory arms. 

If Pfizer gets new temps approved make even easier assume issue shipping staging centers ultra-cold storage re-packed distribution. able ship direct immunization sites (or same-day turn staging pallet smaller packs) speed things up.

Would curious difference time shipment time injection Moderna vs. Pfizer today given temp differences. not, minimum hope states get bit quicker logistically volumes continue ramp distribution sites widen. It’s respiratory, incredibly low infectious dose. omg thank raisins!!1! Hell yeah! Saw news morning. I'm ready take puppy lakefront. temps perfect too. Keep going Chicago :) Time governor's call national guard help could part it, lot Florida tourist area. live Palm beach county, get tourism nothing like keys orlando area. People hiding homes. see nearly perfect mask use grocery stores, gas stations etc also hear lots stories big house parties bars enforce anything. securing lot vaccines quickly mattered politics Canada would swimming vaccines.

EU actually secure quite good agreements compared world. Companies refused deliver promised doses, can't delay much longer though since agreements pretty strict. European countries one best situation despite delays - compare example Ukraine participate program, beg vaccines.

(It's awful nationalism anyway, whole world vaccinated, rates everywhere patents bought opened India others could produce mRNA vaccines masse. no, companies worth absolutely **nothing** compared whole **cost prolonging covid** around world make profit. :( ) least prospect every restriction ending june. shit... Even transplant dangerous first place 100% work. RIP proposing nationalized health insurance, I'm board. know N95 ? time people still know differences masks ? came fact didn’t let people reason. could literally fly US UK whenever wanted almost year. one island another island. stricter, doesn’t mean location sole reason worked. stricter worked. 105 year old got covid vaccine ate raisins survived getting covid. thank raisins! J&amp;J defined moderate illness differently Pfizer, meaning J&amp;J, “moderate” akin colloquial “mild”. 100% effective severe illness, different time points. press release compared efficacy 28 days. Pull 49 days differences negligible. it’s one shot. yes, don’t know people unexcited this. love shit NYT. Also seasonal illnesses might compete hosts, coronaviruses rhino viruses dominant now, flu doesn’t enough hosts propagate people don’t get cold flu time, usually immunity weeks illness. Also makes common cold causing viruses easily spread symptoms. Coughing, runny nose, sneezing puts lot virus infect others, flu doesn’t necessarily symptoms, causes host much discomfort bed rest away others, person cold go business spreading virus. would bet significant amount real money Fauci, 80-year-old fully vaccinated man, feels 100% safe around grandchildren. he's telling public feel anything different, he's deceptive. Legally U.K. contract doesn’t impact EU contract. Practically does. 
I’d fully agree stance issue one EU AZ, way AZ could resolve issue would take U.K. supply that’s UK contract comes play.  Ok, begin here. understand worry don’t know, you’ve really consuming hard anti-vaccine propaganda. (You post NNN proves that). “A huge amount people sick days”

Yes, immune system responding something looks like. Fever, chills, sore arm, inflammation: That’s sick, that’s exactly would expect strong immune response look like, exactly vaccine proven work well disease spreads like contagious flu. That’s feature, bug.

“People even died within days”

Yes, have. We’ve vaccinating mostly old people, you’re falling powerful logical fallacy: Post hoc ergo propter hoc. simply waved hand 10 million people’s arm, would expect 14k deaths next two months. That’s nothing unusual. would also expect 4K heart attack, 9K new cancer diagnosis, 4K strokes. powerful logical hole humans bad understanding anti vaccine propagandists use, hope you’re smart enough recognize people use you.

“We usually spend 10 years”

Not particularly. NovaVax NanoFlu vaccine hit it’s primary endpoint phase 3 trial 5 months prior COVID. reading we’re comparing time couldn’t adequately measure human immune response without waiting people get sick. Unless you’re using live vaccine immune compromised individual, single long-term side effect shows 42-days post dosing vaccines, there’s compelling reason think show up. Think like testing now-a-days: PCR test run hours used take weeks 20 years ago, similarly, make pseudovirus days react assay good idea works even start trials.

“I’m fine risk COVID”

Which brings back Powerball quote: “fine risk COVID” you’re saying you’re fine giving COVID another lottery ticket find workable mutation get around vaccines. want New Normal? everyone know needs vaccinated quickly possible COVID left quarter get back crowds. So, phase one lasted June since like Sweden even better cases? 

I kept hounding comparison kept saying ""if compare"" done comparison topic actually discussing - european countries. ever live 120 I'll credit random shit mess people saying I'm buying 30% number. think high too. think fool's errand try predict future inside crisis. course everything future looks like crisis. be, though. he's party President. aide straight admitted covering mistakes Biden became President. That’s sad read. hope person gets help. Okay makes sense actually could thing happen Coronavirus? viruses eradicated others not? tell state plan already made dramatically ramp vaccine delivery. We’re waiting supply. believe others similarly ready we’ve notice . Chicago hit lowest positivity rate (3.4%) since started testing, city announced plans reopen playgrounds swimming pools first time since last March. (Granted, nobody enforced playground closures last summer fall, still...)

The tide turning. better job getting doses general  ""yeah ***what if***"" crowd searching things worry about. think experience broken lot already fragile, neurotic people. like growing great depression created lot hoarders, bet see swaths people stick masking distancing well simply gives comfort.  May seen good explanation taken long. gathering data something sure common law vs civil law much English law vs Belgium law ...don't check donor organs disease infections?!? God that's terrible. earth measles pass one person another?  table got values from. That's works Let us get Johnson Johnson Novavax vaccines approved think business helping American continents. Hang there. Pfizer trial children likely finish summer, expand age range 12, believe.

I think also makes sense try get 600M Pfizer+Moderna knows many people going choose forgo J+J higher efficacy rate? What's hilarious/ironic analogy War Worlds, Earth's microscopic organisms pathogens killed aliens saved humanity. real life, microscopic pathogen what's currently wrecking havoc humanity.

That plot line original novel pretty much every adaptation story btw, 2005 film adaptation.  problem. ready go think I'm sorry, guy. hope picks quicker dad's sake (and yours). mean...what talking fauci says might wearing masks 2022, maybe see relatives you’re vaccinated, that. talking fauci overly cautious even past mass vaccination

Also issue vaccinated need wear masks everyone else too, say open it. They’re definitely still important sense, agree. mean feel comfortable enough know hang recommendations deciding handle personal life. mission prevent spread misinformation. Calling people hypochondriacs without evidence misinformation.  Depends fast states administer goo European. one pre-existing conditions smoker.

What means practice millions people eligible, many may stretch fake eligibility, way, way people eligibility group available vaccines months come. People eligibility group getting scheduled vaccinations April May result. You’ll probably recover time. article deigns mention “a small minority” persistent loss. doesn’t give actual numbers. understanding things work 

Far greater understanding you. scientist recognize someone making political, scientific remarks. Fauci said masks A) considerable amount true: they're effective, unintended consequences although pinpoint greatest one: false sense security among vulnerable, B) political agenda. Absolutely heartbreaking. got flu 2019 still phlegmmy cough morning/when exercising AM. respiratory viruses nothing sneezed at. got Covid back April tests SCARCE. Even good testing experts say have, what, 6-10 times cases? suspect NY’s cases time frame even severely undercounted. Definitely!   completely fine. **Send lot**? extend European lock downs see Europeans die? keep wearing masks fun bro everyone else stop export vaccine products EU Talk doctor getting vaccine, take medical advice people internet sny circumstances besides telling actually talk real doctor Covid ""over"" Dr. Fauci says so. Sure, New York one densely populated areas world one people use massively public transport. can't really use value representative ""what R0 covid"". like, I'm pretty sure R0 flu also much higher New York many places. 

Of course R0 varies conditions (if would idea NPIs?). still use numbers average external conditions compare different diseases (which whole point thread). post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

They'll nearly year set US production time approved.   exports banned 20% EU citizens gets least one dose. transmissible, otherwise wiped older variants parts UK quickly did. exactly people think masks help stupid.  Even proven good idea, anyone thinks West wear masks every winter like Japan optimistic idiot. should, won't. Fauci also caught camera standing room full people pulling mask cameras turned off. lady walking behind dangling one ear. Frankly, Fauci lost almost credibility saw that. doesn’t wear mask believe says everyone else to? sure population density sanitation part   helped

They work well England three lol proved AZ intentionally hindering efforts produce vaccine would case. would AZs motives restrict supply purpose? point even long term effect avoiding hospital collapse. locked hard now, would starting ease basically moment mass vaccination would possible due large amount vaccines arriving Yeah, FDA EMA classifying too. Actually Health Canada last 3 classify such. worry due corruption Africa go health care workers. Best Reasonable Effort Best Effort contract. going talk arresting people, least get details correct. Yeah apartment complex include buildings. Smell still important. Perhaps US ordered first AZ already anticipated approval? I'm sure that's case US buy pre buy without assurances delivery. respect approach. least aren’t one crazies attacking anyone doesn’t submit. point Spain (I think), guesstimated old died respiratory issues, pretty much due covid. Astrazeneca vaccines US manufactured US. US banned exports vaccines, hence factories can't supply EU rest world. Frankly, done same. Perhaps variants even infectious first place believed? were, vaccines outweighed it? AZ would last choice could pick one take. know know contract said. assured fact vaccine would help. make effort get vaccine? scared mutation would covered vaccine would likely worst scenario, consider outcome. Tending see worst aspect something literally definition pessimistic. Yeah. They’re normally pretty quiet moment though. I’m wearing mask. may true. vaccine also assessed based performance **moderate disease**. vaccines evaluated based effectiveness preventing **symptomatic disease (which includes mild)**. means J&amp;J actually performs lot worse think. stats would likely lot lower actually evaluated based effectiveness symptomatic Covid, like vaccines. incredible. believe everything they're told matter ridiculous is. need vaccinate vulnerable first. rest us go living damn lives already. Agreed completely; think restrictions gone anyways, I'm surely minority that.

To answer question, see reasons masks worn everyone vaccinated. caveat see sick showing symptoms (sick general; covid), masks could useful ""polite"" thing do, surely mandated. poverty.

High population density, close proximity livestock, widespread poverty. Yep that's doctors diagnose someone ask fine! Wow. That's also true. Smartest 1% Americans pretty much keep 99% country crumbling. damn 99% try make crumble. They're making 'promised 4M' they've reclassified dose 1/6 vial used 1/5 Feb.  roommates made quarantine considering good situation would move out. must getting tax break.

In opinion, they've ""holding out"" Canada asking tax break. I'm disgusted could spit.  would try gently convince them, hope come conclusion. using compassion reason, would hope change minds. However, family pretty level headed aside stepdad, mom works CNA nursing facility, already received vaccine. would also try ease fears one might vaccine, try use factual sources so. bullshit gets posted literally every week. stop?  😂 goodness. Also, keep mind flu, it’s mostly elderly people need hospitalized

That's great point. I'm sure difference ""cold"" ""the flu"", assume I've ""the flu"" past, never tested it. Presumably, many people same, flu past year, get tested it, hospitalized. college shit even though medical advisor expects students vaccinated then. ridiculous. got email last week Full lockdown industry targeted measures would hurt business PM. Case closed.  y’all really want vaccine? Y’all ours. folks demand mNRA vaccine. Well confirmed weeks ago production issues solved. guess not... ""more infectious"" variants somehow led massive drop cases never went doctor...and trying use prove long term chronic health condition? would even know? Lol 🤣

But sure qualified know long covid totally thing right? bet covid denier too. still using language one. flu. advisory committee made assorted group scientists highly regarded experts specialties, actively involved research various universities institutions primary employment. bunch nine-to-fivers sitting around FDA building working spreadsheets instead reviewing trial data. 4 weeks people thoroughly review every piece data generated means slow person commenting others saying one following COVID restrictions. Cant ways  wasn’t. German paper question didn’t report like all. I’d suggest go look making false/misinformed claims

You correct didn’t imply won’t work. article question outright said it. claimed efficacy 8% 65s despite data back up. 

This regulators issuing licence due insufficient evidence completely different matter. Yes California sounds like nothing changes tenant lives nose throat expose nose throat infected air. infectious 9 10 people exposed infected air would contract it. could 0% best reasonable efforts still met, purely situational. evidence AZ meet best reasonable effort standards assume otherwise call people arrested wrong. general question all:

Once everybody wants vaccinated vaccinated, guys think still wear masks? 

In opinion, think restrictions need go point. People make dangerous decisions every day, cannot hold everybody's hand. Seasonality matters. it’s flu season, virus transmission naturally dies down. flu season northern hemisphere, south. Large scale air travel creates continuous supply flu place place seasonal conditions become less favorable viral transmission. 

Almost like flu migrates south summer. air travel winter, flu come back. Don’t quote China said originally don’t trust tests best way know CT think method false positives/negatives Yeah stay place large country vs 12x12 apartment, thing agree except Spring. Things going get worse.

Also concerts back summer, like not. spread aerosols love God please open merchant mariners Florida next too. weed takes quite awhile get system already regular smoker really matter Redditors think even friends notifying health issues? friends literally last people know lol.  Coronavirus speads aerosols. solid evidence Jenna Ellis infact crop dusted infected Rudy Giuliani leading Coronavirus advantages funding pharmaceutical industry 1. know lots people buy wipes home usage.
2. home, take 70% rubbing alcohol put spray bottle. works sanitize hard surfaces hand sanitizer. Well, damn son. Kicking pandemic it’s down. love see it. what's end goal plan? eliminated worldwide, make way whenever stop sealing borders, plan permanently seal Europe rest world? Two Questions:

1. teenagers access COVID-19 vaccine Arizona?

2. might possibly able get vaccine without parents' knowledge (once again, Arizona)? want able live life again, parents anti-vaccine.  shocked reaching level herd immunity state chocked full science denying idiots.  

I live Kansas City adopted mask mandates early last weekend husband stop gas station 20 minutes south like Covid never happened. masks, even employees. signs doors. I'm told like lot smaller towns around here. Makes hard believe anyone says numbers plummeting due increased adherence safety guidelines. would say another factor put US disadvantage though compared developed countries terms fighting pandemic, inequality US terms access health care, lack worker protections, lack social safety net. US alone among developed world universal healthcare, many afraid going ER due crippling medical bills. Workers less powerful US harder time demanding safety precautions, may less able take time work exposed COVID-19.

Oddly enough US ability treat severe COVID19 comparable even better western countries. system certainly puts people major financial disadvantage, actually good job saving peoples lives.

Lack worker protections safety net hamper ability lockdown hard fast contain things, however. may difficult western countries achieve success asian countries, US able achieve similar success places like Canada least. I’d take one right Weird! Id find “meaningful” told covid antibodies never thought covid lol. wonder prevent people donating blood place covid test? second shot symptoms like worst hangover life, ended abruptly started. Felt starting 12 hours shot, went feeling like complete crap 100% normal within 20 minutes 20 hours that. UK signed contract AZ three months earlier incompetent EU, invested per capita production turn got priority vaccine.

That's propaganda lol, go check leaked contract - UK EU signed contract around days. AZ legal basis give priority UK, like said, export EU slow incompetent put price vaccines speed signing contracts cost lives. disgusting.

Again, leaked contract shows EU slow all, recall correctly EU signed first UK, June. need check party feed new propaganda, that's also relied heavily Sanofi producing working vaccine far failed do. Pathetic think country size France can't produce working vaccine.

Because mRNA vaccine, easy task. learn think expensive hard make, many pharmaceuticals make it? think UK making mRNA vaccines? need technology, plants, know how. many vaccines France produced let alone exported 🤣 ?!

121 million delivered summer, mRNA vaccines, ready variants - come baby :D Lets use window effective vaccines Northern hemisphere spring/summer *to stamp out*.

(or could listen yacht wash needers ice-cream feeders, make article come true) favorite version song Can't believe movie theaters even still exist. Hopefully live theater music follow. also advantage single dose vaccine. great people like needles, unlikely make second appointment, worried side effects second dose. also lot easier distribute since strict cold storage requirements schedule second appointments. much Pfizer paying you? see some. say complete vindication pros independent larger group. Certainly faster action taken needed. poor countries, people significant health problems already dead. rich countries they're kept going pills. Everyone's fat too. yo yo effects thus far vaccine go it. totally different. 

Herd immunity never never goal. goal make virus manageable. Lowering impact hospitals always goal. 

250k 2.5 million extremely generous range. That’s like guessing age somewhere 10 100 years old. word goto general population current qualified groups? case Europe, too.
America definitely level above, Europe also suffering obesity crisis. someone living Japan, last trip Europe eye-opening. Germany see ""Walmart Fat"" people, adults came across overweight/obese. Swedish Government desperate find ”evidence” unbased strategy — actually worked. Ridiculous compare w Norway Finland think little sort prioritization age 55. open everyone point. Vaccines reduce transmission updated easily every year new mutations. Vaccines also significantly lower ""long covid"" (whatever really means). society, collectively agree death inevitable something accept. Tens thousands die every year respiratory diseases - locked every winter, would prevent majority deaths, would silly damaging majority. applies Covid - disease forever locking every year solution great, sounds miserable me. 20M doses 1 shot vaccine ~10% remainder people need vaccinate. 

And j&amp;j protects ~100% hospitalization death.

Rejecting vaccine would straight malpractice. Given countries EU seems supplying developed nations, would suspect rest world would actually care.

You would hear lot whining Australia Canada though. No, that's fair. lie, greatly looking forward seeing pandemic behind us. considering full dose vaccination still weeks apart, Canada hoping 6,000,000 vaccines total (which thanks moderna seems unlikely) April 1st

Conjecture. contractually obligated hit number. currently track hit 3 million fully vaccinated best April, forgive doubting April game over, anyone April receiving vaccine looking 8 weeks total receive second shot given appropriate two weeks following see maximum benefit.

You free doubts.

But entire thesis ignores fact reported 1 shot strong second shot. data coming Israel. admit familiar BC's vaccine rollout comes argument vaccines yet targeted spread rather limiting death. BC Rollout Plan timeline

Do like plan not?

I'm hellbent cause current reports, factors, Data match it.


The media solely focusing vaccination Canada overall. report nuanced data compile one big report. taking path cause... Well, media. Calling simple minded vultures would understatement.

They paint picture wanna paint everyone internet bases judgement Canadas fight Covid that. short, ignorance bliss. Unfortunately simple. COVID likely around years come vaccine get today need effective long term, also effective new variants continue emerge years. can't get R0 ""vanilla"" COVID 1 declare victory. also need ensure stays 1 future variants mRNA vaccines much effective that. J&amp;J vaccine alone already effective enough drop R0 South Africa strain 1 future vaccine resistant strains sure follow. Sweden voluntary lockdowns. government mandated. actually constitution couldnt. amend constitution order order one. iirc verge passing said amendment soon. World needs less people It’s important get many Americans vaccinated soon possible 20 million doses one shot vaccine huge game changer. 

All talk one better ridiculous. Anecdotally, conservative columnist local newspaper went exactly this. first thing wrote got hospital endorsement state's mask mandate. Perhaps plausible worldwide, certainly plausible Europe - sealed borders took right measures internally. Whether would politically possible different matter, though scenario outlined article started take shape things would move fast. We'll see seasonal; remember Texas got blasted Summer. hsir loss part pretty common. understand concern, choice wait see. point wear mask months extra safe I'm fine that. Things change time pandemic nothing set stone, think suggesting happen, hear concern. better country He's wrong us coming fall.

I won't. Doubt mom surrounded literal dummies.

There shortage nurses don’t understand science well, unfortunately. Wherever probably better job managing past year did.

We didn't. Germany 6% population vaccinated far, despite basically paid Pfizer/BionTech vaccine. 

This we're from, fun Sundays evenings, [in summer 

We last year, looking like year wont happen either. wife video, I'm sure I've danced ladies years. think people willing to, vaccination programs ramping up. way going keep mask requirements up, vaccination rates high hospitalisation rates dropped significantly. lol whoops said, US death/cases much lower confirm poor socialist healthcare is.

What moronic take. always 99% time suggesting virus fucking sentient lmaooooo cannot wait got unsubscribe button mods eventually archive place. watched enough forensic files know 30k need. guy using platform spew negativity instead using encourage vaccinations everyone chance get vaccine wants one.... spread minimal.  

I probably done mask.

However judge others continue wear permanently. gets downvoted it’s stupid thing say. here. I'm happy homebody alone 95% time. 5% unbearable full year this. offered people live places without easy access ultrafeeezers stuff. dismissing way much get actual overview situation. narrowing get number give fraction answer. answer countries count entirely different seem lie about. 

I dont see worth raw unchanged data. Exactly. fear really misplaced. 

You much concerned usa doesnt help vaccinate rest world. also, far, simplest police. Imagine hypothetical world risk groups purely went age. could basically strip away 90% complexity managing process. People could register damn google form want folks site could look id make sure they're OK. That’s great hear! Congrats cousin! looking mapping country covid vaccinations. Chile amazing! Good them. Literally millions people's arms let's complain nothing happening. One wondrous scientific logistical achievements history we're going whine press release.

Peak Reddit right there. country honest although states organized like let younger. change next weeks start opening people pre-existing conditions younger need multiples first thing got states go bar celebrate coworkers. literally cried happy. fair that's like 2 weeks away. Yup- nj resident here- I’ll summer get one Masks won’t enforced meaningful way lights go off. It’s personal risk you’re taking going theatres some, it’s worth it. scheduling bit flexible.  bit. Deaths per day lower first peak. Granted better treating, considering shit testing ability time, who’s say wasn’t similar number cases back then, too? Probably May Oh Ned. make laugh. think China can’t mount attack Europe sea mountain. That’s cute. paternalistic dim view Africans, cracking up. 

Anyways, enjoy evening/well morning. can't believe downvoted saying this... actual number much, much higher 48%. People changing minds day take vaccine, knowing safe effective. Friday 26th soon Oh yeah, bet fucking ass summer gonna one gigantic fucking rager. museums open New York easily spend two hours one. It’s perfectly safe. also far easiest project quantities verify. Going profession extremely messy difficult verify. didn’t happen anyone United States. That's smart realize everyone getting vaccinated including people already got sick. calculations wrong. Could explain reasoning behind like others said, he’s worked administrations. half NFL players far know none anything long lasting. Myles Garrett take plays couple weeks recovered played full game playoffs. Um no, literally said may masking 2022, absurd fear mongering bullshit. current trajectory may 300 million vaccinated August. FUCK would wearing mask 2022? Yeah, it’s New Jersey imagine it’s going reason walking around mask,”

is ""splicing fragment sentence"". 

""No reason"" strong language. Like said, piss off. Fauci anti-Trump hero want be. we'll distribution networks already set ready go. We'll learned works then. Roll new varient vaccines fast seems sensible plan protect lives fast possible, long EU reliable enough supply coming future, assume do, despite various issues. Plus 2-3 week delay arms immunity  ask county in? parents Bergen also 90 years old can’t get appointment anything Separate. Totally different virus it'll awhile get combined. 

Also, practical standpoint, need vaccine. Imagine going hunting hunting two different types prey. need Sniper Rifle (COVID) kill sleeping bear, shotgun (FLU) kill birds. Well, let know polio goes. Haaaaaa mean, Dr doubt asking relevant questions Dr would ask folks know determine lasting symptoms.. exactly said read headline.  anyone else dreading possibility getting J&amp;J vaccine lower efficacy compared moderna Pfizer? mean it’s better nothing get one vaccine, won’t able get another kind long you’re stuck less immunity. I’m kinda bummed hearing they’ll ready soon thought I’d see disappointed comments here. Change mind?? Like Asian country. Vietnam love big families someone states saw things getting bad, I’m fortunate Vietnam. know joke I'll honest, months ago still thinking tiktok ""too young"" weird dance videos actually really fun app. I've learned lot cool stuff there. bet Aril May money shot! can’t produce stupid amount it’s legally approved business standpoint. nuts bolts allow unvaccinated guests congregate nursing home? residents okay, virus could spread guests. think wise lift restrictions majority population even eligible vaccine. lol...I guess happen happen anyone else. amazing benefits sounds like. leave job. remember early last year every new death still hit new case worrying. encouraged state thousand new cases day. really lose concept meanings, people behind numbers. 

But tonight, watching this, cried again.

Thank sharing. Ex-Trump officials still blaming China. Pathetic. true. It’s luck know . father every possible list 90 years old, half paralyzed, heart condition. Can’t get appointment shit. able get one though bc live different county. Mer young guy health problems mega center got one idea how. Take whatever offered you. Even J/J AZ 60-70% efficacy HUGE improvement. vaccines far shown almost 100% efficacy preventing severe covid, hospitalization, death. take whatever get. Maybe next year picky. I'll take them. almost everything post ridiculously top stupid? fucking us? Nooooooooooooo covid suck much jeez much two-pronged situation going right now. Georgia, cases, hospitalizations, deaths dropping dramatically. opened 4 mass vaccination sites expect get huge shipments vaccines soon. big question mark things go March-May. suprise past year. too. know 20 30 people 1/3 people supposed long lasting effects know any, BS meter pegged. supposed believe anything site upvote shit like this. Oh wow. I’m 29 can’t wait get vaccinated. Yep, get you. Complete disaster roll out. I’m stuck wondering even logistics project managers, cause feels like throwing darts fucking board. Truthfully though inefficiency “states rights” trumping (mind pun) federal mandates would made non starter fauci even tried make sort federal mandate  Totally! trying account percentage overlaps infected vaccinated (say, 0.26\*13 = 3% ish). 

But right something consider future numbers Chill, bottle booze evening.

The secret happy life scientist cares people listening scientific advice. idiots consistently ignoring happen one particular party fault, idiots politicising basic facts. I've never seen anything mind-boggling stupid *certain* US politicians turning mask-wearing pandemic huge partisan issue. mean think Biden administration claim flat lie honestly. Trump administration bungled every aspect pandemic except vaccination. Biden administration claiming otherwise standard political points scoring. Natural immunity plus vaccines hopefully bulldoze variants I’m college anymore sympathize you. It’s honestly pretty insane think large portion country essentially normal certain states still super locked down. It’s crazy think different people’s experiences are.

It sucks college allowed anything. Hang :/ Praise Scientific Method! Sorry, right. head US 340 million, actually 320 million. Also great point reduced transmission, adds exponential factor this, best possible way.

I'm 100% May estimate. understand people perpetually pessimistic summer estimates returning normalcy, mathematically looks direction. Pollution?

Clean air act.  

I think there’s quite bit environmental regulation United States.  

Compare polluted average American city average Chinese city.   

America serious pollution past dealt reasonably... Lol, reporter wrote going HARD 8% figure twitter. course. negotiated work.

Either US government blocks shipments countries (which makes Biden look bad). J&amp;J willingly.

J&amp;J scandals moment, aren’t going cross president weeks first term.

A democrat controlled government make lots subtle changes make J&amp;J’s life much easier. know well. surprising, healthcare infrastructure tends located affluent areas getting access vaccine appointments relies luck/chance getting appointments online phone. Large cities need open walk-in appointments areas reach vulnerable population groups (in particular elderly folks don’t family sit around calling places checking internet appointments). I'm walking contradiction, might cause pain suffering stupid choices, want EVER bring anyone else cause pain suffering. I'm scared coronavirus scared addiction, may one day kill me. Regardless, mean neither real neither scary. Also live alone keep myself, try best problems interfere love family, like wear mask public try interfere health strangers. sure getting downvoted. 130M addressed thru vaccines supplied end March. 100M estimated already infected then. That's pretty much herd immunity right there,

There's big hole saying here, vaccinations overlapping prior infections. withholding vaccines people naturally immune disease. that's 130 + 100, significantly less that. 

That said I'm trying rain parade, numbers look great anyway. could well near herd immunity memorial day. saying April thought they’d lot early J&amp;J vaccines.  stepped back timeline J&amp;J said would take longer get significant quantities end June fullfill 100 million.

But J&amp;j says get 20 million us March maybe it’s changed again. year. Masks stay matter whos vaccinated 30% people aren’t taking shit serious herd immunity  man well ahead you. He's talking early summer already, June best.

Might well bring dice ask them. You’re literally spouting nonsense J&amp;J actually vaccine I'm interested in. I'm fully board mRNA vaccines personally since new are. I'd feel much comfortable taking since traditional style vaccine. feel masks stay least next twenty years that's good thing I'm Canada... know 🥺😫 edgy  R*dditors send thoughts prayers. Aka masks forever keep shifting goal posts  Johnson one shot it’s 20m peeps pandemic need post-mortem went RIGHT. understand much compressed timeline insane funding pandemic increasing exposure control groups time think learn approvals sped up. please explain would mean hospitalizations deaths? yet group 1b still can’t find appointments many areas. want flair getting Americans politicized respect scientists. turned purchasing vaccines needed, lied hospitals dates they’d get vaccines quantities, didn’t plan distribution get elderly healthcare workers, allowed many loopholes help people priority priority. definitely bungled vaccine distribution. don’t really see say good. Old news. changed mind yet pegs early summer. Yep. I'm experiencing it, horse shit. life least temporarily ruined. awaiting vaccination. Scheduled weeks ago Friday, received message delays shortages wont scheduled another month. Everyone work awaits... bad. I've eat 2 times last year times got weirdness minute. splitting hairs. never said locked precisely western countries did. reasonable definition consider Deagu quarantine, school closures, various targeted restrictions part lockdown, even nationally milder western restrictions. literally rolled military police enforce Deagu quarantine, far dramatic anything done west. presumably would done city experienced similar outbreak. Nah, people respect scientists China, whereas scientists get death threats US. That's difference. Chinese people scared death COVID take seriously. Americans thinks hoax politicized it. difficult compare mRNA vaccines JnJ. trials performed different times, different locations, different virus variants. seems likely Moderna BioNTech vaccines effective, differences may large think. Seriously, everyone needs look inflammation symptoms see much line people long covid describe, particularly ""brain fog"" quite possibly common reported long covid symptom. There's ton data pediatric sequelae yet seem imaging abnormalities hospitalized kids clear quickly group could possibly say disease burden COVID anywhere near comparable influenza still much know. Honestly adults immunized high rate, level community transmission low enough kids likely largely protected. also fairly likely time adults vaccinated, safety trials children complete anyway begin vax them. doubt time, will, manpower altering statistics retroactively like that. I'd say gatherings biggest impact. I'm tired hearing things ""might"" happen. wake happen. Vaccinations done end july.   People quick pile Florida lack lockdown. you’re young immunocompromised, care? J&amp;J enough. go 5km home months, along tons restrictions, count full lockdown know does. J&amp;J single dose? bunch companies 2004-2005 said ""no point"" continuing research SARS. basically already.

Guess would great 2021? SARS research. says something different literally every day. Next week June. Got back late May last year daily headaches, breaking hives, brain fog, chronic fatigue. originally wasn’t even bad. Luckily magnesium helping headaches luck hives yet. Hopefully multiple allergy medications I’ve start helping soon 🤞🏻

I hate people say isn’t real. never issues covid it’s absolutely miserable. That’s asking, point.

A flu patient heart attack 2 weeks later counts heart attack.

A covid patient heart attack 2 weeks later counts covid. I’m Missouri it’s here. know 3 people got vaccinated nurses already covid. cautious always sign good prudence, especially public health emergency. prudent got fucked first place. weird even 100% safe go, zero desire go sit crowded movie theater anymore? Daily life better...but 3x increased risk death average...   stop reposting endless variants story. yeah difficult one. necessarily work well vaccine. would introduce much extra time process would counterproductive. Everyone vaccinated... 30% people refuse based latest polls, vaccines available kids. Looks like British evacuating Dunkirk temporary Take care home first help rest necessarily. Although seem done well regard.

But never argued otherwise. I'm arguing original argument - bizarrely somehow CFR proof universal healthcare inferior. be. depends are, really. I'm Atlantic Canada, 2.4 million people (6% Canada) less 5K cases 100 deaths whole pandemic. handful cases restrictions pretty much May December common sense ones like masking paying attention socialize with. people know BC. 

Point is, can't say daily life different it'd US... except it'd probably warmer. led argument US preferable, would agreed without question since sincerely tired snow. 

Anyway, sorry misunderstood - initial comment cited declining rates US reason prefer countries, sure knew rates declining almost exactly rate. sooo hard understand.....there still ton virus right now, virus control rapid (2 3 months would guess) go ahead live life. Vaccinated people running around without protective measures still ton virus taking unnecessary risk find mutated virus beat vaccines.....it like trying make sure can't go back normal can't inconvenienced couple months so. math 60m ppl? Cali LOWER first peak. Y'all wringer, that's bullshit know quoting movie world gonna give big ol' yawn USA gets vaccination done still waiting vaccine. 

It might even nice yawn, honest. Fwiw, Butler downplaying bout covid bad. again, downplaying injuries illnesses big part pro athlete culture. 

It strange says ""scary"" also hit hard. negative side effects vaccines? I’m talking non covid seeming side effects like hair loss, dry mouth, itchy butt, anything? consent real id's tied genetic code. lot easier that. casual contact one original cases. think it’s Bill Gates alt-account something, yo. point simply one possibly leverage pharmaceutical company try compel produce sterile injectible product faster 30 days. might able tweak distribution bit.

OWS successful though - US enough doses cover population soon. “could” lot things. slightly younger essential workers those, plus dealing gross rude public. know multiple people got sick work.

And blunt, weren’t thanked hero’s keeping society running, month, went back treated like shit still told last year they’d fast tracked vaccine.

My state literally changed guidelines today revoke fast tracking essential workers. They’re going purely age writing essential workers next phase. Quite frankly, another way society show think keep duping low wage workers.

And let’s get confused, official real reasoning behind it’s easier states end try figure real essential worker. policy made facilitate administration process, picked yesterday figured 30 much risk 20 year old. Johnson johnson paid billions lawsuits? I’m good Great news US! 20 million doses March highly significant number. European, optimist saying benefit us too, however I’m worried doses going US supply increased much. vaccine partially developed Netherlands made Netherlands filled US.  could fix Texas power grid throwing money it? think will?

Ahahahahahaha!!!!!! cute. models predict herd immunity April.

It's evident conspiracy rambling 'control' capable reasonable discussion topic. sincerely hope well everything opens quickly us. fair asthma even counted co morbidity many states. I’m hard time 4-5 pounds since January 1st progress progress.  LoNg CoViD rArE This. Freedom oriented? Oh, please. 75 million people would given Colin Kaepernick death penalty could. That's great news, 60% America get it, they'll lots left rest world vaccinations happening, *by far* highest risk ones vaccinated. That’s important, case counts aren’t numbers - also matters getting sick. old at-risk protected, we’re much better shape. Same. wonder develope extreme agoraphobia social anxiety. forgot around one person time point lol I'll say again: time pandemic, could literally walk bar, restaurant, cafe order want Korea. uncle, owns small business there, never closed once. Neither friends also businesses. I've contact family since January last year, people voluntarily withdrawal public activities, everyone so, ever required to. Suggesting lockdown place, earlier post, simply accurate. 

In instances, municipalities closed specific businesses outbreak (starbucks, church etc), city nationwide measure implemented. really. They’re using technology didn’t work coronavirus. tried SARS MERS, made infection worse cos overwhelmed immune system. look second phase trail, got 51% effective rate figure 95% CI set data range -166% 91%. means effective rate somewhere -166% 91%. fuck effective rate NEGATIVE? means getting worse getting nothing. made people prone infection. no, it’s worse nothing. using logic critical thinking. People dont respond well that. call trump fat orange idiot take votes. Moderna Pfizer share recipe everyone? Chill. Pfizer also bringing help online could boost coming from.

Kalamzoo MI - addl lines

Groton CT - addl lipoduction

McPherson KS - fill finish (new plant)



A week ago Pfizer producing 5mn, 7mn, yes extrapolate yes possible exceed goals. see. Couple months US think might good shape... Get many guests vaccinated asap lol Done sterile hood risks contamination pooling insignificant.  entirety post ""cultural differences exist""

America place command authority works well. Newsom tried recall effort would even along.

People far defiant here....we can't change that...but demonize it? Like, get it, defiance bad situation, generally pretty good card keep freedoms getting removed. Yeah, work, apparently flu. Covid still spreads like wildfire, soo... exactly remember numbers, think bit Sweden's number, means places like Netherlands. They've done really well.. You’re right, aren’t convince get appointment oncologist checkup discussion vaccine? Thanka What’s point pessimistic, least make attempt? ""Evidence""

First, address finding 2 cases India documented infections 8 figures means likely number infections 9 figures.

Second, two cases - documented one case ""sure"" due reinfection (despite pcr tests sometimes indicating false negatives) one admit sure reinfection.

This paper worth time took type out. biggest problem measles disease alone (though actually pretty nasty itself), immune amnesia causes. Basically causes immune system forget defend illnesses. opens people secondary infections illnesses. *seriously* fuck shit making significantly less immune viruses. people die measles directly die measles, die something get measles opened cracks immunity. Again, what? It’s season, it’s amount light exposure. northern hemisphere, amount timing sunlight gradually increases winter solstice Dec 21 summer solstice. I’m saying necessarily case ~ crazy ~ think amount timing UV radiation receive effect virus? Amount light exposure “something physical”  would get US bad side. don’t want that. Arrested exactly? producing much vaccine can, vaccine yields highly volatile contracts specifically written flexible manner allow delays like this. understand disappointed bottom line AZ providing vaccine cost save millions lives round world. CDC's new chart, see total partial vaccination rates among adults nearing 20% already (currently 17%). Interesting update, since much higher total rate Americans 13%! also likely contact tracing South Korea Japan Australia New Zealand worked much better elsewhere. find lot marginal contacts basically one could super spreader really far cry next month. next owner corporate real estate investors capital withstand short term loss. First March April, April May, May June. Soon, it'll June July. eliminate COVID like made Polio non-issue (They've got similar basic reproductive rates). also eliminated closest relative SARS-CoV-2, SARS already. Eliminating SARS2 technical challenge point. way eliminate COVID many people reject vaccines.

Covid spreads air, simply breathing. makes elimination like elimating flu, spreads way - impossible. can't get rid something like that, even knows stay way long.

The lists side effects gave immediate ones. Unusually severe, normal side effects immediately after. longer term stuff concerns me, mentioned know yet. Sure, mrna vaccines problematic, they're same.

And no, things year. we're required immunity passports advocate for, that's going lead increase surveillance, people able essentially see part medical record. seems bad, head route pretty scary future. Aside that, chance qualifications really screwed up, opportunities available future looking pretty bleak, generation going picking economic damage likely struggle getting jobs scale what's happened, I've lost lot opportunities meet people, I'm also *traumatised* what's done someone said safety placed lot people danger. That's going go away get vaccinated. That's going hurt long time, that's me, one person. many others gone worse, going keep affecting too. 

And vaccinating everyone kill hundreds millions. Please, ridiculous. predictions start year though covid way worse actually far out, that's even them. People already exposed, remember? immunity increased well exposure, plays big part know PCR positive test increases chance death next two weeks 3000%.

As last statement, really true. According CDC, risk death per age group follows:

0-19: 0.003%

(From September 2020, likely lower fatality rates new diseases tend decrease time due exposure disease general population) 

So information already obvious disease majority population significant chance killing them, also obvious concern really protecting people aged 70+ stage best done vaccinating them. even symptomatic case disease. positive PCR test different kettle fish. First all, running high cycles, recommended limit lot false positives detected. Secondly, even test detect something, simply viral matter residing nose. could dead, could live enough actually infect you. real positives always mean disease either. Judging this, positive pcr test mean got huge chance dying. Sorry long winded explanation, wanted point out. Someone age greater chance death choking food. scary little still know COVID

This true spring, summer, anymore. know lot now, things as:

- Covid threat majority population, danger goes significantly elderly people people average around 3 pre existing health conditions

- know effective treatments now, invermectin, example, zinc vitamins

- know lack vitamins, particular vitamin D, put people around 80% higher risk severe case

- know putting people ventilators prematurely kill could've otherwise survived, mistake made lot last spring


Of course, know things help us prevent hospitalizations deaths directly, deal happen. they're also things gotten lot media attention despite simple yet effective. Covid scary unknown anymore.

And time goes receive information risks vaccine, course I'll willing change view. I'm vowing never take it, I'm simply concerned quick development (as many others) feel that's fair reason discriminate others based health decisions. people receive vaccine, hope everything goes well. does, stance change willing take vaccine. please, something simple really reason usher something like immunity passport, personal health decisions known business owners share others, pressure people things want consent to? could lead paths society want go down, takes away freedom choose one best things modern society leads people open diverse opinions, important understand world many different perspectives. article noted know enough design surveillance strategy could discover targeted control Another curious fact outside Wuhan, China, home first big outbreak, infected individuals weren’t immediately causing exponential local outbreaks, says Endo, one earliest quantify key questions remain. “We ideas factors involved, still don’t know main driver superspreading,” says Endo.

Even mRNA vaccines’ famed “95 percent efficacy” really measure well vaccines prevented symptomatic cases. **Flint didn’t expect one people slipped cracks.**  hand high immunity probably favor resistant mutations, like antibiotic resistant bacteria. got vaccine mean can't still catch different strain. Much like flu vaccine. like covid going go away. Well guess soon people renting cars live in. really don’t understand everyone reluctant reimagine society humanitarian way serves everyone people means buy property leverage property, leaving affordable options low wage earners. factor ever price want, current circumstances people can’t pay, leaving city, landlords figure something else out. 
Also way owning single apartment works, paying maintenance fee, building maintained people units. fact friends apartments pay less money monthly fees mortgage space friends pay rent, extra money pay goes profit landlord. Landlords aren’t necessary. would agreed full 12 months ago last year shaken belief people country. People willingly handed much without hesitation understanding difficult would reclaim gone. Confusing username way haha That's car's climate control bringing outside air (and lots it) smoker windows open. Switch onto air recycle odours around. Justice science, despite use blinds scales. I've long maintained needs evidence-based kind worries rhetoric leaning towards people think ""fair"" they're going stick man. numbers show vaccinated people sufficiently protected circulating variants cases continue decrease masks probably go. see another spike cases large unprotected populations like elderly prepared mask again, maybe certain areas activities, reevaluate. This. Like, REALLY lock individual clean rooms 14 days, even going grocery store? kind avoid others week check see could still smell okay left? ""And POLITICO reported last week, non-redacted version contract shows EU also waived right to sue AstraZeneca event delivery delays.""

This seems like punch line. EU basically can't anything. believe source addresses issue undetected cases, shared it.

Unless saying 80-160% people infected already. antivaxxers making measles issue again! Yay! I've got flu atm dunno they've got stats lol I've week 😂 sincerely doubt it. According Swedish vaccine coordinator, it’s country decide send vaccine doses countries, least case Sweden, won’t happen adults wants vaccinated, there’s surplus doses allocated country. Neither Ursula von der Leyen Macron give away countries vaccine doses. mean varies wealth lol Czech here. Stay closed towards us. dare open. regions west (around Karlsbad Boehmerwald) completely fucked. Lots younger patients dying. British variant hit like speeding freight train. ""There things, even vaccinated, going able society,"" Fauci said Monday White House COVID-19 press briefing. ""For example, indoor dining, theaters, places people congregate. That's safety society.""

Seriously, messaging vaccine anti-vax heaven.  I'm refuting that, making consideration part data interpretation.

You implied sale wipes shot due home users. whole story. Home users wiping whole home wipes every 90 minutes.

Separately, never mind fact I've able buy two half-liter bottles ≥70% iso locally since last March, can't expect businesses mentioned walk around misting whole building lysol spray, bleach mix, alcohol around customers equipment (and never mind food service locations). dependable, simple utility wipes, kept front cleaning solutions whole pandemic. rinsing, dilution, laundering rags, buckets, overspray, nothing -- give every register, work station, short-straw employee bottle walk around with.

I'm work, even previous years, Fortune 500 retailers, someone would get sent go buy wipes grocery store. Heck, sell office supply stores.

There *real* issue many wipes work Coronaviruses, require surfaces stay wet several minutes, plain happening. litter toxicity bad, paper towel use concentrate packets business traditionally use. isn't.

Fomites, aka surface infections, responsible many covid cases.

People buying harsh cleaning products likely harm good. get hospitalized get screened multiple diseases serious complication. Everyone doesn’t access vaccine. Maybe do, won’t able get one months. im reporting friend contact local reporter ask know anything supposed vaccine surplus story also see wanted try track code came meant for. suspect something similar happened I'm aware serious attempts make vaccines mandatory USA. course specific companies may make required term employment, etc, cannot imagine requirement federal state government vaccinated ever palatable US.

In social setting, mostly mind business. I'll opine broad strokes societal impact, would never attempt compel someone's personal decision. even tell social contacts I'm vaccinated. mind anyone else wants keep wearing mask, I'll pissed gets forced others everyone wants vaccine gets one Come Key West, shocking lack adherence measures. I'm Miami lot Jackson Health/Sylvester Cancer Center, completely different. grab takeout feels much safer here. picking takeout Duval last month husband said uncomfortable people unmasked refusing distance wanted food ready would curbside. We're take normal help favorite places stay afloat. 

Everyone masked everywhere there, see maybe 20% adherence streets. Many, all, bars completely packed. places right here, they're exception. Masks walk in, capacity limits. Drove indoor restaurant night tables packed tight wondered people could push chairs back get up, maybe 6-8 inches back back. 

Visitors constantly saying something effect - rules Key West, that's come. there's - Florida mask state! 
I think masks holy grail, coupled social distancing hand washing, helps. Executive bonuses ridiculously inflated. doubt exec making millions dollars bonuses personally made much profit himself. Argentina? youre fully vaccinated theyre mostly vaccinated, risk small negligible. Im also assuming roommates young/low risk.

I think end trip there's high chance remaining roommate one dose least too. 

I flew PDX LAX fall issues. PDX breeze, per usual. LAX ghostown too, probably still April. say, fun trip! I'm random redditor :) still wear certain time shouldn’t mandated  point it’s perfectly valid say R number covid range slightly 6, does. fixed value, using broad terms context makes sense comment seems pedantic. Especially context 50% transmissible b117 variant, wasn’t around March last year figures from. no...that factually false. Getting Covid greater risks vaccine, much effective keeping getting Covid again. immune response someone previously infected covers proteins virus, spike protein. less 500 documented cases reinfection entire world. 99.999% effective rate. Far better 94% rate vaccine gives you. Look man, really understand this. probably constitutional enforce regulations ultimately help. Courts slow process want beat COVID now, next year. central point need people cooperate rules work. disagree that? Nothing capabilities

Didn't OWS play huge role least setting Moderna's production, supply chain distribution? giant like Pfizer J&amp;J. 



....the covid sub go here. mean fitness subs I'm on? makeup ones? scary human-to-human transmissible. ""Flint vaccinated COVID-19 already, assumed he’d immune.""

95% immunity lol. look however want paid damages asked for. plenty internet look yourself, clear googling scrolling halfway page isn’t research, take ten whole minutes least anything. environmental impact wipes masks. Clip ear strings throwing trash Within next year two kids West either vaccinated exposed (if haven’t already). We’re Zoom school tiny class sizes forever. Even poorer countries late vaccination allow children exposed since low risk. 50 years, today’s kids middle aged adults, hardly zero protection COVID, even new variants circulate every year. Well he’s human, I. see people standing walking around video mask off. far I’m aware, situation you’re indoors, least within 6 feet someone isn’t part household, cause wear mask. However, rule obviously doesn’t apply Fauci; saying it’s obviously necessary wear mask times public, following leading immunologist. I’m following actions, speak louder words. 

There many photos/videos Republicans Congress/senate aren’t wearing masks float around Reddit people saying “see! everyone’s dying! It’s damn republicans wearing masks setting bad example!” Even one gal made sit plexiglass box statement wouldn’t wear mask. aren’t holding Fauci standard hold republicans? anyone understands dangers around people without mask Fauci, right? flu mutated escape vaccines?

It's no-win argument. Ultimately, endgame COVID going determine safe you.

If friend hospital COVID, every right freaked people seem dismissing seriousness virus. hand, friend's situation, young healthy hospital COVID, rare someone maimed car accident. vulnerable option get vaccinated, burden hospitalization/death COVID headed towards people's personal choices (whether get vaccinated not) choices people around choose respect virus mitigation..  provides immunity boost almost good others without unknown long term effects mRNA vaccine. I'm doctor, wide subject epidemiologists virologists seem able speak solid hours. reckon short answer question.

BTW already happens ""coronavirus"", common cold coronavirus, keeps coming back.

My understanding sars-cov2 know yet evolve, specialists vocal hoping become milder seasonal like flu, even simple cold. still contraversial, know mutate. Aus guess could possibly happen, balancing  I’ve seen America (presumably non Americans) despite fact everyone know (spread across entire country) says community good wearing masks  Honestly I'd rather everyone safe possible. means waiting effective vaccine. taking one that's 66% vs 95%. gladly stand line come back booster dose get mRNA vaccine that's 94%+ effective preventing infection, period, preventing *severe* disease still leaving fairly high chance get mild COVID end long haul symptoms.  cause lower cases (in way people going getting tested)? Sorry that's stupid question genuinely asking.  think there's going lot people want come world awhile.

Instead catering world people completely, ""you stay home virtual school/work, rest us move on"" option? many avenues remote stuff now, easily permanent want stay virtual. Also, mean ""move on"" open season vaccines immediately, though appreciate soft opening things now. president done thing. sun came morning, guess praise Biden  “...strong support existence negative interactions influenza noninfluenza viruses positive interactions among noninfluenza viruses. mathematical simulations mimic 2-pathogen dynamics, show transient immune-mediated interference cause relatively ubiquitous common cold-like virus diminish peak activity seasonal virus, supporting potential role innate immunity driving asynchronous circulation influenza rhinovirus. “

Or.....you could wait vaccine that's effective, instead risking life long term health make everyone else happy. Society focusing virus also narrow view. 

I also never said stop caring right now, getting point. people 65 received shot. Per every data source 95% deaths. long expect people go along this, never getting absolute 0. endemic.

In state Minnesota, 90k confirmed cases kids 20 (probably 2-3x including non confirmed), 2 deaths 6433... 49 total population block 40 (60% population block).  high risk group, might want add comments social media posts share opinion vaccine get. interest community gets vaccinated soon possible highly effective vaccines available. Backlog.. they’re processing death certificates holiday surge Keep , taking period. Oh god, wear piece cloth face go outside. Truely worst thing world /s

Come summer, masks with. Besides, much worse things worry about. article basically says ""its effective care well go get anyway"". Hard pass. know way many people died corona virus getting less effective vaccine"". People constantly say ""but prevents death"" ""but there's 99.9% chance die corona anyway!"". 

Well aware. seen life changing effects post corona virus know two young people died heart attacks covid. One stroke. 

Zero chance going get less effective vaccine. serious taken seriously. 

Its basically wearing mask wearing mask. Absolutely fucking stupid wear mask get effective vaccine. well, that's crux it. delay without data. however, data UK, Isreal, people allergic reaction can't get 2nd dose. data continues show fine, fine. necessarily. Somebody could said ""hey code gets vaccine"", sent friends, necessarily realized unique intended certain races only. 

There ways could gotten without pure malice. Yes. isn’t contradiction, comments true (the broader problem something necessary free easily accessible) MATH+ protocol pdf saying live virus dead day 8 people. earlier that, day 8.

This means, day 8, virus least way out, steroids taken quell hyper-inflammatory syndrome already started.

Meanwhile, explained Dr Paul Marik one Dr video, viral debris continues large numbers, continues trigger positive PCR tests (which triggered viral debris) 30 days more.

This PCR tests positive presence live virus, well viral debris 30 days longer many patients.

This also antivirals like Remdesivir demonstrated non-effective, esp. later inflammatory stage disease, Dr Paul Marik takes pains explain videos. criticizes continuing practice many hospitals giving Remdesivir post-day-8 period (though patient immuno-compromised, MAY make sense give Remdesivir antiviral, since live viral persistence beyond 100 days observed cases - exclusively immuno-compromised patients seems far). also reversed, recommends giving Remdesivir covid19 patients.


During day 1-8, thus give steroids, give anti-oxidative support (Vitamin C, NAC, melatonin, statins).

When day 8 rolls around, start steroids reasonable degree confidence safe (since bulk virus stage over, virus way - soon adaptive immunity cleanup finish last virus). addition (day 1-8 and) post-day-8 period, refresher doses ivermectin tilt playing field virus.

This study shows median time live viral clearance 7 days (from first symptoms ie day 7), 12 days viable/culturable live virus found (that mean zero live virus, live virus may immune-privileged sites like brain, testes etc. - live virus going away).

Here advice finding yes, people paid living wage health care general--especially vaccines, help people much help you--should available without figuring much pay it. way, really late now.

It late think, given intimate relationship slavery Jim Crow.

Ruby Bridges 66 years old. Virtually every black person South older explicitly deprived access equal education. Given relationship education income, big deal.

There million similar examples, ongoing discrimination. Mistreatment black people end 150 years ago. Nope. Especially article points part reason “optics.” farce. probably wildest 4th July american history. Everyone much pent energy emotion set loose.

I know want another one last year. city sounded like warzone every night week.. Yeah, weird message simple as, ""racism bad"" difficult grasp many politicians. Pre-covid would buy 10 containers wipes week. January last year became harder find locally due flu cases. everyone home able use washable cloths conserve wipes, made limited stock. 

Last week local store huge display able stock back up. much easier use wipes classroom bring rags back forth wash, spray use paper towels 50 times day. Bad things happened around world peak pandemic. Spain example, many nursing homes workers simply took left old people fend catastrophic results. Many fuckups occurred different parts, among worst I've read, institutional responsibility answer. understand getting numbers overlap. unknown, right? could way off. would multiply estimate percent infected 13? Considering got hit another snowstorm, probably contributes it. next coming weeks, see bigger drop think places want covid patient. Results: prevalence OD signiﬁcantly higher mild form (85.9%) compared moderate-to-critical forms (4.5–6.9%; P = 0.001). 1916 patients OD, 1363 completed evaluations (71.1%). total 328 patients (24.1%) didnot subjectively recover olfaction 60 days theonset dysfunction. mean duration self-reported OD 21.6 +/- 17.9 days.

There's lot variables contribute it, that's bottom line situation they're dealing with. line reasoning, argue ageist vaccinate 65 year old 45 year old? codes weren’t specifically one race another. people living poorer zip codes LA. 30% people Bel Air already vaccinated compared 8 9% population poorer neighborhoods LA, that’s problem. trying remedy that. people downvoting likely people going hard time accepting wealthier nations need climate change poorer nations. Eating cake too. People also talk continuing wear masks grocery store like that's huge risk getting flu. people going catch family, friends, coworkers, unless social distancing four months every year think really matters healthy person occasionally wear mask around strangers. may right. may delay 2nd dose PR worries. You’re right don’t know sure vaccine better, data appears show Pfizer vaccine better: 72% J&amp;J 95% Pfizer based virus circulating United States trials. Also think Pfizer offers “good protection” South African variant, detected state. 

I would get J&amp;J second vaccine got two doses one MRNA vaccines. Moderna’s Pfizer’s vaccines appear effective: vaccines roughly 95% effective preventing moderate serious illness; Johnson &amp; Johnson’s rate 72% U.S. trial, 57% South Africa, highly contagious variant COVID-19 led spike yet know exactly level neutralization required protection COVID-19 disease infection, experience vaccines tells us likely Pfizer vaccine offers relatively good protection new variant,"" Scott Weaver, director Institute Human Infections Immunity University Texas Medical Branch author study, told CNN.  much media amplification often long-term symptom. Every time see bozo twitter say, ""the mortality rate .00001"" something comment living rest life w/o proper taste/smell potential too. See /r/COVID19Positive lots threads people suffering w/ this.....and phantom smells/tastes.  would freak out. Losing two senses almost scariest thing. live NJ feel like cases dropping quickly areas throughout country. said NY East Coast states. concerned? restrictions finally eased odds cases go back again? I'm sick want know numbers going staying down. plenty permanent virtual school options, might worth exploring those. know get leaflet whatever side effects vaccine are? Yeah, we're getting that. point *don't know*. regardless articles saying possible risk, loads risks, actually know we're dealing yet. It'll take time learn. remaining people get vaccinated, covid spread, natural immunity quickly reached - without forcing coercing people injecting something comfortable with. far base risk calculations. Driving car bigger risk life coronavirus J&amp;J vaccine. mean slightly bigger risk, mean even husband drive still higher risk dying car accident dying vaccine.  disagree - take look Czechia. failed basically everything :). company making vaccine trust all, hopefully wait tad longer get different vaccine, Aren’t uptake rates increasing among healthcare workers see others get vaccine ill effects? Plenty people don’t want first, don’t think want last, either. Ugh. open Facebook morning find article says, “can stop wearing mask you’re vaccinated? Absolutely not.” Barf. Make stop. cant escape 
🦍 🦍 💎🤲 🚀 🌚 lot people knowing wtf onset pandemic, us thinking surface spread bigger deal air transmission.

The big problem Cuomo NY initial fuckup imo, attempt cover up. Sure, COVID symptoms last months months people shitty health situation.

Also case 100% COVID, living together, positive twice, negative twice, still sick COVID symptoms. 

PCR tests shit. hard understand risk complication hospitalization exponentially greater higher age groups? can't young people sacrifice waiting month two let people much higher chance getting seriously ill first get vaccinated first? Seriously understand comment getting upvoted.  think every college be. Students getting vaccinated late spring/early summer. Absolutely reason person. would explain french healthcare workers got hid hard vaccine! OK, fine! (fingers crossed!)

thanks! Anyone know going Virginia? According worldometer deaths high last three days, despite cases peaking back January. want go back person school. scared getting sick people say antisocial. virus could kill rest familie dont want New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan.

Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine ordered nursing homes take stable COVID patients, proceeded mother nursing home. Joe Biden made assistant secretary Department Health Human Services. said early soap water sufficient soap destroys capsid. change?

No. Neither laziness / addiction convenience Americans.

1 tablespoon bleach 1 cup water make solution kills SARS virus minute.  See eg don’t see data that. Cars leading cause death among children still large cause death among adults.... Yes! I’m sure ongoing release data update timeframe. vaccine available everyone, restrictions end immediately regardless we're herd immunity. option protect choose to, that's anymore. be. fucking gross. feel there's very, easy explanation he's widely ridiculed accepted well around parts. rather higher risk dealing covid long term effects drive 60 miles? 

I know two young people died post covid heart attacks one stroke. edit: fucking worth debate. Don’t forget live/work smoker come back inside smelling awful making everything inside smell awful. No, infinite number teachers. states, far wealthy don’t necessarily earn much manager grocery store. would get necessarily richer anyone else. teachers state make $50k year. 

If need schools open, deserve priority. 

So grocery store workers older and/or high risk. specifically compared teacher 50s comorbidities 22-year-old behind cash register grocery store.    think anyone knows yet. point AZ vaccine bad one get it, valid reasons people might hesitate called dumb selfish concern. Yeah, that's pretty fucked mentality

Also even really correct, huge waitlist (at least Canada) people become teachers, nobody hiring teachers. got 22 year old good worker whatever Canadian equivalent Kroger he's going **lot** harder replace someone actually job. 100% deduced little risk catching surface contact (the chemicals oils skin break virus quickly) infection comes directly breathing aerosolized droplets respiratory fluid infected people  

That's lot places carpet bombing everything 
ludicrous amounts disinfectant early stages pandemic kind stopped think mRNA vaccines stronger vaccines comparing efficacy, however continent, fact globe, need (safe efficient) vaccines get. pray hope companies able partly offset huge decrease supply. EU like failed state, it’s working  business?  No, profits people. Resource allocation.

There limited number highly desirable places live, people want live physically possible. settle this? Even magically evened everyone's bank accounts number, people desire different things. people want live NYC, want live Burbs, live beach.

Imagine 100 people fighting 50 beach front property spots, that's ever be.

1) Random lottery. Fair, inexacting. someone **really** loves ocean misses out, someone put bunch lotteries happened win even bother enjoy beach

2) Decree authority. Someone power decides gets live where. Hopefully benevolent dictator omniscient abilities determine ""best"" outcome. Trump decides friends win?

3) Cram housing wherever dilute whatever have. everyone lives 200sqf apartments hates it. There's noise everywhere living beach even fun anymore, space privacy.

3) Violence. Whomever vicious, wins. Obvious downsides.

5) Market forces. Allow people bid things really want, people want willing give (freeing extra resources everyone else)

The world today built market forces resolve resource allocation problems. dismiss unhumanitarian, might consider taking walk history see approaches played (they tried). lipids also produced EU (Germany 2 factories, example - Evonik) Pfizer could also deliver usa Man, lot people want last forever Maybe bad made like actual analysis deaths knee jerk internet outrage really support horrifying narrative I'm seeing. getting pushed real hard though. WT actual F? moron. wear seatbelt drive ? paying attention last year? Multiple people re-infected. know happens continues spread? mutates. Even better, could potentially mutate something protected vaccine. So, part problem going forward. getting vaccinated could reason continues ripping population, unvaccinated ass spreads mutated virus rest us.

So, welcome trying protect getting shot, us. I'm glad risk you, instead risk millions died continue die it. Uhm, obvious stupidity, lack domain knowledge. stuff trivial understand expert field. CDC somehow made Vaccine tracker even less usable Mobile... numbers squished together, still cant see state state data... agree completely. live state that’s fairly strict movie theaters open restrictions since last June, exception weeks around Christmas spike. haven’t heard anything outbreaks coming them, suggesting stay closed half year really serves benefit, especially people vaccinated. ""The EU really help companies set-up costs research, unlike US UK""

Sorry, read past sentence wrong. Pfizer J&amp;J developed EU.  based on? kids getting it? Kids natural immunity response acts already vaccinated, contagious. vaccinated, kid visit not, happen kid gets it, almost hospitalization/death outcome chance vaccinated.

I see much logic precautions.  Holy shit guy on. theaters barely surviving wants closed *until fucking fall*

What happens get Fall reasons open.

this messaging abysmal. realize hospitals testing people covid, influenza A, influenza B, disease time scary think *if* variant evolves, it'll quickly become dominant variant. prioritize people likely die catch first (so, elderly, people heart conditions, obese, etc.). drastically reduces death count reduces strain hospitals, since people also likely need medial attention.

Then, prioritize likely spread people can't receive vaccine (teachers, etc.), followed people likely spread around in-general (retail workers, etc.).

That's generally way reduce deaths most, cost slightly prolonged pandemic (if goal end pandemic ASAP, would vaccinating young adults, since tend spread most). see, hope guys get soon closer locations. It’s literally simple acknowledging Covid contagious  societal value, teachers educated certified, easily replaced 22-year-old behind checkout counter Kroger (who unlikely hospitalized) 92-year old living Social Security circling drain.



Can talk gross attitude is? I've seen similar things expressed sub real life. 

This pandemic really exposed fucked morality people have. those, lunch break 😫 mental health clinic blowin' up, seems like hitting everybody :l think broke Sounds like good time get checked weakened immune system 12% NY got vaccine already, eligible population least double that, getting significant numbers example, I'm eligible. "" end June 82 per cent adults received least one dose. 60 per cent fully vaccinated stage, Mr Martin said "" It’s teachers. It’s people ages 50+ also teacher, firefighter, sworn law enforcement officer.

My 55 year old bus driver neighbor constantly exposed sick people every day, she’s still screwed, glad see age factor distribution equation level. makes sense isn’t even close enough supply get vaccinated herd immunity. mean, yeah? never going back 2019 normal even vaccines, point making them? need quarantine already vaccinated. normal tier. green. Endless restrictions CA! Woo!! true, check data.  controlled trials, existent humans 100% likely non-existent humans spread covid. 

So yeah  apartment, built early 1920s, built ventilation. design radiators big units, keep windows open winter time. keep smallest radiator adjust temperature opening closing windows. always fresh air winter.  AZ vaccine isn’t effective SA like variants it’s modified it’s really day late dollar short. dont need US. Chicago reopened outdoor playgrounds first time since March today, even worst places making progress. 4 . Profit makes sense. main point vaccine reduce fatality rate reduced transmission rate.  start. Google ""Macron Sanofi EU Vaccine Purchase"", put paywalls. wasn’t hiding symptoms. didn’t know. sure getting downvotes. comment sounds pretty reasonable me. I'm optimistic current trends, never know might happen weeks say. can't wait ditch masks, I'm bit leary. rate it'll couple months US talking antivax people get even though supply high Exactly happens EU bans export Pfizer vaccine, can't get lipids needed they're manufactured UK? Claps. Well said! Okay, here's Dr. Fauci actually said: ""Asked CNN's Dana Bash ""State Union"" whether thinks Americans still need wear masks next year, Fauci replied: ""You know, think possible that's case and, again, really depends mean normality.""

Dr. Fauci scientist, god, know future exact certainly pretend like does. people love misquoting make statement fit agenda. people might still wearing masks masks mandated. might mandated wintertime times high outbreaks, NZ similar adapt like Asian countries.

Let's stop spreading misinformation Asian countries masks: Except times public health crises--like original SARS-- Asian countries mask mandates. Even winter, going see people wearing masks Asian countries. felt fucking high reading this. Dining bad society? What?

And like, even mean? many, many places restaurants open. *can* go, regardless not. Tuesdays always bit higher yeah, lame. Preventing death always primary goal vaccine development. Reducing transmission still secondary. fatality rate seniors know significantly higher. Exactly. one rather easy digest people desperate news improvements gets headlines. J&amp;J vaccines cultured Netherlands, Leiden Janssen. Biontech/pfizer also exported thebUS Europe. wonder people reading would’ve died car crash got mugged weren’t lockdown. makes u think angry bitter mother died nursing home dying day. We’ll see. end March it’s fully states hands unless 3 vaccine makers lying Congress today. hand sanitizer ceo's get richer Texas  basing societal value? see gross is?

Teachers educated richer groceries get vaccine poor uneducated grocers? say decline infections could justify continued use hand sanitiser masks following coronavirus pandemic

Let's look happens Asia recent flu season. wear masks sick, also pollution, pollen, reasons.

Japan seem helping much.

Something else consider New Zealand mask social distancing requirements since September, recent one Auckland. So, must seen huge increase flu? Nope.

I would post graph would blank graph. Empty. search else do? stopped world travel, tested travellers quarantined them. There's interesting history 9/11 attacks delayed flu arrival flu season delayed air traffic stopped  Sept. 11 attacks, finding suggests ban air travel could buy valuable time event pandemic, study's authors say. 
Researchers U.S. studied influenza seasons nine regions U.S. 1996 2005. 
Study  author John Brownstein Children's Hospital Boston colleagues looked flu spreads cities regions calculated rate spread year. 
In years 9/11, flu deaths U.S. tended peak around Feb. 17, researchers reported journal PLoS Medicine. 
In flu season attacks, peak date delayed 13 days, March 2. France, flight restrictions, delay 2001-02 season.

These viral infections come Asia. well known among influenza 60 years global travel patterns influenza virus  mystery,"" study co-author Colin Russell, epidemiologist  specializing pathogen evolution University Cambridge  England said teleconference today. Russell said  colleagues found year since 2002 new strains influenza  (H3N2), infectious variety seasonal flu, originated ""the  east Southeast Asian circulation network,"" spans Malaysia western Indonesia Korea Japan. virus showed Europe North America six nine months later—and continued  South America.

 Here's presentation Colin Russell, starts talking flu around need new flu vaccine every year flu strains die locally everyone infected get fresh strain every year Asia. Quebec actually halted flu vaccine program due low amount evidence influenza comes Asia limit spreading controlling world travel, testing quarantines. Masks social isolation stop spread influenza seen Asia every year. Masks social isolation also necessary stopping flu evidenced New Zealand's lack masks since September. Sorry that’s Joe’s nap time Lots countries waiting period vaccination blood donation it’s worth checking local guidance. So, throw caution wind? NY, transportation (MTA taxi workers) grocery store workers already getting shots. think they've access since around first week February. Restaurant workers also already list people get shots. aren’t getting vaccine even though can. need know. Viruses mutate replicate. spread replicate. measles virus hasn’t mutated doesn’t spread anymore mass vaccinations pretty much eliminated it. reason new variants Covid people giving chance spread replicate. wouldn’t surprised weeks/months new variant comes resistant vaccine. already unclear rates dropping fast everywhere - little vaccination effect yet, herd immunity unless undetected asymptomatic mild cases much prevalent.

There's lot built-in immunity (but even places well managed seeing drop).

I mean, novel virus exploded Spring/Fall widely susceptible population. end, respiratory virus spread best fall/early winter taper late winter Spring. may well end respiratory illness season along endemic within population (less spreading like wildfire, spreading like illnesses). Confusing actually posted sub wanted share awful headline is. UK Cases SOAR! currently 154 case counts dropping. Really really awful headline still important story. Something like, ""While cases continue drop, UK variant accounting higher number cases"" would much better. remaining issue point people who, fault own, unable take vaccine, either approved (e.g. young) medically unable (I'm sure applies expect some).

I feel bad them, think point join ranks people severe peanut allergies like - they're going manage exposure risk.  depends state think. CDC recommend people underlying conditions phase 1C, they're defining cancer; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); heart conditions, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies; immunocompromised state solid organ transplant; obesity severe obesity; sickle cell disease; smoking; type 2 diabetes mellitus; pregnancy.

Source God no. get vaccine first place you’re worried this? Also flying 100% fine. delta can. just... effing joke. 
I'm British Citizen lived France since 8, I'm 28. I've since April 2018 (this stint).

This say EU handling pandemic: 
""A disjointed bunch power-tripping politicians can't make valid decisions within countries, let-alone Europe wide"".

France locked right now. evening curfew weekend curfew coming (so like lockdown, we're allowed work office social life, yes President said that... lol). 


Meanwhile Spain Italy opening cause economies dying. 
Germany, Denmark Belgium closed cause Covid smashed them. 
Portugal Portugal things, allowing Brazilians others EU frontdoor lol thanks. 
Bulgaria letting eastern europeans backdoor (Ukrainians allowed go Bulgaria, 14 days go anywhere EU). 


It's joke. 


Then get vaccines.  
The EU help investing vaccine research - UK US did. 
The EU moaned Pfizer AZ giving enough doses - well acted like entitled bitches then. 
The EU smearing AZ efficacy side effects big time. proven work, screaming doses shitting AZ meeting capacity (the UK invested heavily AZ labs/production sites, EU Belgium, site struggling).

All all, EU gets 1/5 handling pandemic, imagine next couple decades going hell Italians/Spanish/Portuguese Greeks try rebuild destroyed economies like. side, French Germans, along Dutch Scandinavians, probably end-up footing big part bill countries, increased taxes like. 


All all, pandemic shown EU current form, cannot handle crisis, take responsibility actions. schools classrooms without windows? horrible.  Phases vary state - state in? Dunno really save deaths, they'd die another year see temporary shift. may however see marginal increase life expectancy. mine gone start March. think recovered fully July August would say 100% now. highly recommend smell training. specific techniques google this. take long time nerve cells wire back brain training make recovery much likely. see still understood saying still misunderstanding even brought health issues. biggest problem think many discussing ""numbers"" comes human life forget human life. all. Amazon makes mistake consistently calculating productivity expectations employees. forget dealing humans. I'm seeking remind of. look people's lost years, regardless amount, numeric away, recollecting people family, loved ones, friends stripped person's presence. amount loss incalculable intangible arguing whether average 16 years lost life overstated ignores reality even one year, one year substantial significant value person died knew them. 

I also explained prognosis long one might live certain condition often fraught error. That's precisely doctors tend give long somebody left unless certain surpass expectations longevity. Although, like said, calculating average years life left preexisting secondary conditions average life span may overstating number years left, time, real way calculate many years less average life expectancy given condition often range even then, always outliers outlive expectations. animals carry viruses, even completely eliminated humans, would come back again. James Madison also thought slavery fine dandy. Republic 250 years evolve since founding actually amended couple dozen times since dude wrote it, That's exactly CDC says.

It's 10 days first symptom 24 hours fever without use fever reducing medication symtoms covid19 improving (except loss taste smell). need meet 3 criteria.

So someone coughs hard time breathing that's improving even though 10 days first symptom, still True, think I’m suffering cabin fever :) Im same.. we’re bridal shower couple weeks. postpone last year events got cancelled. I’m excited bridal shower know people going judge us even though majority already fully vaccinated:( like everyone going fully vaccinated, I’ve explain friends haven’t been. don’t come understand shouldn’t feel bad “In lab, California strain also revealed resistant neutralizing antibodies generated response COVID-19 vaccines well previous coronavirus infection.”


[nope. straight article. small % resistance equal evading. parents vacation New Mexico planned June. figure things pretty much normal then, aside still masking public places. They’ll also shots vaccine - dad already mom hoping get March. Kind opposite. I'm pretty weak guy, especially mentally. Going gym getting exercise helps keep depression bay. getting better physical shape helps deal Covid (and basically illnesses). seemed work, since shrugged Covid without symptom December (and contract gym).

It risk willing take mental health, took it. Duh. Talk mirror minute, look side.

What else would infectious? Actual spitting contests rare, talking comes close that. What? Winter solstice marks shortest day year, seasonality something amount timing sunlight get don’t see absurd I’ll probably wear one crowded spaces I’m feeling ill like Japanese do. Frankly best thing could come employers dicks need take sick day two. even people wanting wear masks (we get they're annoying). want even see people. One comment even called sexual fetish likened seeing people masks nonconsenual kink. Totally agree. Hospitalizations way starting see deaths fall too. mean next year's flu vaccine? Something like “It’s quite possible could conceivably able return semblance normalcy aspects life early-mid part 2022, perhaps.”  agree wholeheartedly that, said true: that's going change couple months barring something truly extraordinary happening. 

In view, solution reduces continued collateral damage given framework use. next year, extra susceptible flu?  actually think stop mutations? can't. normal common viruses mutate, nothing that. supposed do, eliminate covid? that's completely unrealistic.

Yes. eliminate COVID like made Polio non-issue (They've got similar basic reproductive rates). also eliminated closest relative SARS-CoV-2, SARS already. Eliminating SARS2 technical challenge point. way eliminate COVID many people reject saw nothing links side effects, miss could point right direction?

It's reactions usually mild moderate intensity resolve within days. common adverse reactions reported vaccination clinical studies included:  injection site (92.0%)  (70.0%)  (64.7%)  pain (51.5%)  pain (46.4%)  (45.4%)  (23.0%)  swelling tenderness vaccination arm (19.8%)  (15.5%)  site swelling (14.7%)  site redness reactions usually mild moderate intensity resolve within days. common adverse reactions reported vaccination clinical studies included:  injection site (84.1%)  (62.9%)  (55.1%)  pain (38.3%)  (31.9%)  pain (23.6%)  (14.2%)  site swelling (10.5%)  site redness (9.5%)  (1.1%)  (0.5%)  (0.3%)

There's one outlier rare included lists (As percent outrageously risk Pfizer 4.7 cases/million doses administered, 19 following Moderna vaccine, reporting rate 2.5 cases/million doses administered.

That compared 21 cases/million doses administered antibiotics oh know recommendations torn life shreds sign getting back, I'm feeling particularly inclined blindly believe whatever small group recommend government saying, I'm honest.

To honest, yea, lockdowns suck, must young: would take 1.5 years stupid lockdown 7 years Great Recession several times over. life get back normal COVID non-issue, fastest way make non-issue vaccinate many people possible fast possible: There's solution vaccination killing tens hundreds vaccines actually administered public before, types tested. saying specific covid vaccines, them. 

We've put mRNA cancer treatments vaccines thousands trial patients past 25 years. Sure, general public, worrisome long-term side effects, followups would visible, especially thousands dosed coming year giving mixed messages, disagreement different people lots conflicting evidence

They're humans working incomplete knowledge changing recommendations learn, hope too. scary little still know COVID, know PCR positive test increases chance death next two weeks 3000%. mostly talking peeing.

In past year, I've come ways open public doors without directly touching them.

What kind disgusting person flushes public toilet hands? They're supposed flushed feet!  scans rite aid stores lists appointments available currently dominant variant California, cases, hospitalizations, deaths dropping rate rest country. 

It sound like something worried me. Don’t! Holy fuck dude. would fit right Children Corn Well thankfully cases spring coming. yeah, past months rough. I’m sure decent amount wear masks public doesn’t mask protect others, you? scattered people wear it’s gonna help?

I probably get lot pushback here, personal experience unrelated COVID, strongly believe masks protect wearer common respiratory illnesses. started wearing disposable medical procedure masks daily public transit five years ago, amount times catch respiratory illnesses went 5+ year year. Also, asthma, catching common cold, used frequently get secondary infections required steroids sometimes even antibiotics, gotten single secondary infection since started wearing masks train. guess immune system lungs real shitty lol. know anecdote rigorous, controlled scientific study statistically significant N, fully believe personal experience weird coincidence procedure masks least somewhat protective least respiratory illnesses like common cold flu.

I plan keep wearing procedure masks (or maybe upgrade KN95's) public transit going forward, find uncomfortable, getting sick every couple months completely sucked much bigger inconvenience wearing mask train. like pre-COVID, plan limit mask wearing public transit extremely crowded, enclosed spaces; vaccinated state mask mandates removed, definitely plan wear masks work around friends stores anything unless I'm sick can't stay home. Wearing masks 100% time permanently years end would torture. need Chem concert happen september badly Right - evaluating different countries/states/cities much made government imposed measures little made behavioral choices people making. Semblance normality* studies gone 3 months. data long. could last three months day 30 years. know. someone state that, yeah understand sucks. hard say best option is. Age easy verify counts lot. time, essential workers highly exposed, get too, especially help open things everyone else (For example teachers, especially elementary level).

Regardless, big messaging problem sure. Pulling rug never good idea. said start 55+ next nobody would mind. got plans eat indoors, double date cousin. nurse hospital NYC got vaccine shots afraid covid person know. willing go eat indoors says lot 65's contract signed 28th august European Commission made 336 million euro ($396 million) downpayment British drug maker AstraZeneca AZN.L secure least 300 million doses potential COVID-19 vaccine, spokesman said Thursday. renter signed contract agreeing pay rent. landlord signed contract agreeing kick long (the renter) upheld end said contract.

Two consenting adults entered contract. can't pay car note owner car may repossess it. get free car lost job? really ""natural"" response artificially teach immune system something via shot... Yep gotta go everywhere. Turn stadiums vaccine sites, schools pharmacies, shit get people hawk streets like open air drug market

I almost taste return normalcy. I’m actually excited buy new slacks shirts whenever go back office. one minor clarification: common cold actually bunch different strains viruses common type viruses cause cold rhinoviruses. 200+ strains common cold rhinoviruses, coronaviruses/influenza viruses, rest several different types. catch common cold likely infected multiple strains given time. This, quick mutation viruses, main reasons catch multiple colds seemingly back-to-back. Haha know allllll thinking nod agree Yeah based current rates, Georgia still 1a Mars colony. mean hit hard first wave, though, bringing less severe economic impact overall. yeah, Europe kinda impossible go zero covid approach yet travel countries, completely sealing borders feasible interconnected countries are.

It's really interesting driving factor infection rates country seems situation neighbouring countries - what's happening eastern Europe right now, I'm worried could spread Western Europe cause new wave things reverse soon. I'm wondering seated, whether required wear mask.

Restaurants allowing indoor seating maintaining lower occupancy distanced seating, allows take mask. did.

Answer comment.  Coronavirus doesn’t mutate rate flu (it accumulates mutations half rate.)
 
As fewer people transmit it, opportunities mutation go even further. 
 
 think it’s unlikely need yearly booster shots due mutation. Possibly several years intervals also depending long immunity lasts. Sadly smoothbrains spread myth also believe flu numbers low ""the gubernment"" reporting flu cases covid cases order inflate numbers school transitioned online person masks. It’s almost month nothing serious occurred. kids tested positive, I’m pretty sure got somewhere else. It’s possible school safely cases across US. formal contract - much earlier MoU payments kick process. thing LA times homepage sells fear. Doubt it. US tons neighboring states completely different restrictions. it’s around ~8 months, yet cases still plummeting. 

Doesn’t sound like reason worry me.  mention metrics get semi-open ridiculous point. Newsom going change hospitalizations &amp; deaths keep decreasing even spread among younger, healthy folk. moment people started blaming virus' spread, instead virus itself, inevitable. Maybe we'll get normal sometime future like around 3055 would elderly renter do? would fucked job closed due COVID, would social security fall on. landlord get keep making money? different? unfortunate thing conspiracy nuts take info like instead acknowledging, ""oh, mask usage lockdowns helped also reduce flu cases year"" jump straight ""interesting Covid made flu magically disappear, proof doctors government lying conspiring us"" Gubment set goal 2 million march 15 (NL).
Weve hit 50k today upscaling begun. april, aiming 120k/day reach full vaccination August. Men underrepresented vaccines general. state 2/3 women 1/3 men getting vaccinated think general consensus least you’re eligible, it’s absolutely fine take it. risk people vaccinated states rollout accelerating taking vaccine someone else isn’t much issue even month ago. yet cases keep dropping like rock.  UK agreement AZ back May forked £80m domestic production facilities. hear you, partner camp thought. love going shows, love travel stop things permanently. get vaccinated point, plan resume normal activities much comfortable rates died lot more. 

I well aware could die tomorrow, unfortunately life slapped upside head twice now. I'm also go crowded bar covid still rampant knowing health history (I'm prone respiratory illness blood clot incident, two things feel majorly seen covid). I'm also exposed enough working teacher. get home need decompress feel mind reset. need give time. Hope answers question. not. I'm traditionalist Catholic personally confirm lot medicine-suspicious people groups. seems like kind gesture , however nearly impossible prove vaccination actually caused death. like America, vast majority Vaccination injuries deaths go unreported. available vaccines reserved within minutes seems extremely efficient me. 

Though soon enough vaccine appointment open walk ins. supply increasing quick. explain projections speculation.

I used work manufacturing side pharmaceuticals injectables. Typically many manufacturing lines qualify validate lines new formulations. 

Also, typically departments areas perform optimization manufacturing process. studies increase batch size etc. 

With something high priority like covid teams probably pushed pretty hard everything meet demand.

You act like kids, parents, younger workers already forced make kind choices. might one stupidest fucking things I’ve ever read feel best metaphor would help people understand importance circulation.

Open window(when gets warmer ) People owning property don’t live make money on, makes less accessible others own. Throwing money rent year year means people can’t afford buy. It’s broken system non essential middle men (women) including landlord. Landlords always able evict tenants non-payment rent. That's fundamental concept private property. government wants commandeer property imminent domain compensate it. 

There's myriad circumstances outside control tenant could cause unable pay rent. That's life. unfortunate circumstances proper justification theft happening. Flood destroyed car? Oh well steal car someone decide afford loss car. Right? UK You’ve going gym without mask since June cuz super big tough guy right? new buildings referencing utterly fractional terms units they're irrelevant broader context housing construction affordability.

I really enjoy setting reminders stage, entertaining look back old predictions see panned out. 90% vaccination rate ain’t happening. Closer 70-75% happen enough. USA pushing normal end May. Mask gone end July everyone says ""but flu kills many people"" response ""and evidence shows totally avoidable"" Yeah distinction getting government (eg work Walmart) getting reckless (seriously people flying Vegas solely low ticket prices). evil landlords sell property back billionaires testing richer countries also using testing cycles show minimal amounts virus counting COVID death.

Practically every cancer patient, heart disease etc. death counted COVID despite primary reason. It’s probably due travel bans seasonal effects. Walgreens never even asked identification status (also Illinois). qualified company wrote letter well nobody ever asked. really believe qualify, put group. try’s way hard accommodate non white community turn ends racist

Or maybe half deaths early disease [Black Hispanic. even measure skin color whatever, getting areas people dying risk. 

Notice article saying going white communities affluent communitie. everyone wants everyone else get less effective vaccine. cares health safety worry about. 

No, everyone wants everyone get effective vaccine available soon possible. Relying waiting best vaccine available almost certainly add much risk taking J&amp;J get J&amp;J astra vaccine need wait years go back normal life. 

There significant chance lives 100% same. know nearly everything long term effectiveness could wait get effective vaccine. safe possible. really brainer.

His brother CNN opposed Trump, portrayed hero rather criminal really is. really publicized lot more. Yup think he’s wondering fda sitting trial data several weeks now. haven’t seen reports saying data provided J&amp;J insufficient yet they’ll sitting 4 weeks making recommendation. enough idiots refuse vaccine may never hit herd immunity. know, never really understood 3rd amendment needed Bill Rights. it’s becoming crystal clear. Even though 3rd amendment specifically reference government requiring quartering soldiers private property, government eviction ban essentially same. think vaccines exported Belgian factory US started vaccinate people. think anymore? got HfM kid picked daycare. absolutely wrecked me. kid didn’t seemed bothered screwed least 2 months. Company Extorts Impoverished Nations Withholds Lifesaving Vaccine...fixed title. still pass people.

I'm vaccines, give people false sense security. point

It good third choice vaccine someone younger far less risk - vaccine wit comorbidities higher risk due age Unsure virus mean ""it""? catch measules areosols [two hours infected person left room -- happen Covid-19 mainly spreads droplets aerosols. Preventative care!?! What’s that!? Countries planet could care less. Cancer screenings types medical screenings missed year. AZ submit vaccine EMA (i.e. get approval used EU) until... January?

The EU wanted play safe go approved vaccines rather going first available. Although disagree decision can't really say whole thing worth not.

But also UK blocked exports EU.

What irks whole thing lack solidarity. Germany also pushed EU block exports like saints either. won't. one wants permanent lockdown. states anyway. New York opening theaters March 5. New Jersey announced less restrictions, like increasing building capacities 25% 50% allowing people sporting events. that's 13% vaccinated local community college friend mine goes sent email recently saying upcoming semesters online Summer 2022, exceptions. Also extra $250 ""virtual convenience fee"" added onto tuition costs. absolute load bullshit. necessarily. Let's say infected person encounters three people vaccinated. three people would become exposed body would need illicit response. However, let's suppose three people become infectious exposure. three vaccinated people encounter three people each, vaccinated others not. nine people exposed virus all. nine people encounter 27 people expose them, turns 81 people, etc. 

The process obviously nuanced this, see going. point, amount protected people prevent virus chance infect anyone else. main principle around herd immunity. 

Knowing vaccine *and* knowing everyone else around helping protect actually getting infected going feel pretty good. _Low risk_ children lower risk.

Vaccinated people see other, greatly reduced risk infection. purpose waiting people vaccinated virus able spread well vaccinated environment, essentially disappear.

If group friends/family vaccinated, almost concern mingling, experts said. risk mingling unvaccinated people. We’ve seen reported months.

Our timeline vaccines receive EUA schedule, well estimates rollout. Biden stated targeting 100M 100 days since December. knew children weren’t eligible.

It bit waiting game, good idea goal line. hang there. see things start improve next couple months.  Yeah, weird thing early february 2020, took covid seriously reported cases France ... oh well, we'll see.

fingers crossed! agree. scientifically factually correct result data. result supposed give asked? result. supposed lie? lie give result scientifically correct result? liable lied. whole thread seems like pre typed conversations? Flu different animal reservoirs. That's hear things like ""bird flu"", ""swine flu"". circulate animal populations eventually jump humans. This... bought guys weeks ago. mean pass it, though?

I'm doctor agree \_\_o00o\_\_ inform people they're getting (even logistically, follow-up appointment). sign mystery vaccine appointment that's really ""passing"" J&amp;J - means sign yet. everyone go anyway.

Personally, I'd take J&amp;J would prefer mRNA vaccine. I'm hoping enough people spooked mRNA/only want one shot prefer J&amp;J balance out. I'm happy J&amp;J available, though, I'm generally optimistic numbers. actually bothered think they’re telling think, you’d know everything ever thought actually wrong.

Precision: Phase 2 clinical data available, phase 3 data yet. need wait phase 3 total confirmation. I'll edit that, thanks noticing. remember seeing NY's serology studies last summer. NYC zip codes 50% positive rate. 30% slightly less. Maybe let's make mask wearing flu season socially accepted thing. COVID settles down. Plus natural immune response fade.

I'll two weeks second dose Moderna. case, dont open vaccinations general public? literally tons vaccines laying around Right. want everyone else get j&amp;j safer. can’t say r/Coronavirus, you’ll labeled solely responsible pandemic continuing! winter free flu jab offered 50's England, well 65's. Odd article mention this, talk percentage 65's got flu jab. antigen easier handle? plan do.... call around see places giving out. You’re welcome! Apparently there’s also chrome extension automatic refreshes:) add - way supply chain set up, doses aren’t usually manufactured one place. plant EU may manufacture actual vaccine plant somewhere else fills packages final product. steps critical producing vaccine. Playgrounds beaches don’t pay taxes. did, they’d reopened long ago. 

It’s good people reopened park themselves. Unfortunately, there’s still bunch fenced locked, along basketball rims stuff like that. It’s ridiculous that’s still going on. actual number though, it? meaningless number confidence interval thousands percent, number accurate - sense full value range scientifically accurate journalists report full value range report single figure. 

E.g. journalist ask scientist efficacy Drug say 37% 95% confidence level 30% 48% next day story newspapers ""Drug 37% efficient"". true though, numbers newspapers give efficacies drugs. Drug 37% efficient. know single number efficiency Drug is. know range, every experimental result measured every science time. 

So, factually true AZ vaccine 65s 6% confidence range -1405% 94%. And, use way reporting number range newspapers always use, headline ""it's 6% efficient"" never report confidence interval

So, answer gave true. months time scientist gave figure dragged front parliamentary committee explain lots old people still died getting vaccine (it's going happen, lets imagine twisted reality turned way) guy gave result going able say ""I told scientificaly factual truth. 6% 95% interval -1405% 94%. result experiment that's result gave you. result data arrives"" Mers barely endemic cases. Vastly higher IFR kids. think 10-15 percent. live country good nutrition healthcare.

AFAIK, there's one measles death US last 15 years (a severely immunocompromised woman), despite thousands cases. CDC early 60s (just vaccination available), 3 4 million people US caught disease every year 400-500 deaths. higher earlier generations poor countries, malnutrition lack access basic healthcare major issues.

It's certainly something want population, league covid. mean tell me, self isolation home ment flu virus passed around community?


Almost if..... Lockdowns work? President Biden would proud accomplishment! Oh yes will. coincidence contradiction enough sway people religion. already whole year, people super judgmental it. Hopefully pandemic wake call important getting vaccinated tho. Keep mind 50% Americans ages 6 months older get flu vaccine. I’m hoping fallout pandemic change way Americans think vaccines number increase. find people saying stuff privileged way. They’re happily married engaged may kids pets keep company. live nice houses. Try living alone one-bedroom apartment also work from, do. cutesy stuff definitely place privilege. I’m tired living work everything else virtually small space. I’m tired privileged friends like “Just positive!!!!” Easy say everything. There’s enough funding test students frequently school district US. really understand I'm saying? graph normal behavior respiratory illness throughout year. illness winter, less summer, lockdowns nothing it. attempt cover up.

I purchases need make near future order prepare hopefully move near future parents behavior intimidating always chicken out. I’m afraid they’ll freak get something mail don’t approve of. Keep mind nearly 2.5 million people died covid. flu ""start scratch"" terms spreading, large amount people die flu died covid. \*Greed. misremembered. non Covid patients. put Covid patients them. Either way, plenty beds available outside nursing homes. ... South Africa still suspending rollout AstraZeneca citing ineffectiveness among elderly? joke, essentially yes. fact, may left room [two hours ago could still get infected. people flu even measles, going around. asymptomatic, mild delayed symptoms. assume spread more. work vaccines treatment drugs.

Shutdowns going work Everyone safer everyone vaccinated. 

Even slightly less effective vaccine much better vaccine all.

That's beside point that: nearly everyone luxury working home; nearly everyone area reliable electricity refrigeration; could potentially get booster shots; less effective vaccines used significantly reduce mortality well eradicate certain diseases. could go on.   actually think stop mutations? can't. normal common viruses mutate, nothing that. supposed do, eliminate covid? that's completely unrealistic.

I saw nothing links side effects, miss could point right direction? saw adverse reactions reported site, mention actually common.

Mrna vaccines actually administered public before, types tested. saying specific covid vaccines, them. public health experts, expecting here? They've giving mixed messages, disagreement different people lots conflicting evidence, yet group who've supported insisted 'settled science' despite this. oh know recommendations torn life shreds sign getting back, I'm feeling particularly inclined blindly believe whatever small group recommend government saying, I'm honest. clearly didn’t go intentionally distorting. local Walmart Home Depot like Black Friday everyday nearly 100 days. paint isle literally empty. couldn’t even buy paint brush. local paint shop? Oh shut down, dangerous. It’s nonsense, science history won’t judge us kindly it. No, that's something conclude phase 3 trials. tested different populations, different viral variants. can't compare them.

The important thing prevent 100% deaths, almost severe disease.  think governors waiting Biden stimulus bill they’re gonna tighten restrictions day it’s passed? 

I live NJ feel like that’s likely Murphy’s plan. low hanging fruits gone Okay mazepin. think would test lungs too... agree, part.

I say part think biggest difference influenza rarely contagious symptom onset. So, given people's sensitivity sick moment, people flu leaving homes like typically might fear could spreading covid.

I think primary driver behind staggering decrease influenza cases. nothing housing. Retail rent schedules completely separate. 

Take someone works industry: you’re wrong. important question is: care random person twitter thinks? 


There's 7 billion people planet. given moment, one probably tweeting something make mad. go looking them, ignore them. Nope Oh ok, see. referring specifically claim Hasidic Jews “tend” antivax.

They tend antivax general pop, among Hasidic Jews it’s small minority. goal made already vaccinating close 1 million per day upward trend. doubt since made. scary part organ apparently also infected surgeon handling it. makes think maybe doctor contaminated both? medical advice, doctor, doctor. medical questions, please speak qualified licensed medical provider area.

Necessary sense? institution recommends undertake high-risk activity confirmed exposure, quarantine symptoms (consistent [CDC still get test days 5-7 exposure sure, 95% efficacy 100% efficacy. That's say need not; that's CDC guidelines institution's recommendations are.

As practical matter, makes feel better want doubly cautious, there's need specifically *avoid* tests getting vaccine. course don't. Otherwise might feel bad something, ya know, like empathy. maybe know. would make distinction ""fair"" ""efficient"". fact extremely efficient gets vaccines everyone's arms quickly, fair orderly. Early on, emphasis fairness, efficient meant vaccine doses held reserve people needed/deserved harder reach seek out. Making system efficient fair huge challenge. wait-list idea good, trivial - lots different vaccination sites appointments times days week, coming system makes possible match people waiting list places times work without resulting appointments going unclaimed missed probably possible, would take lot planning effort resources think never really put this, probably matter months longer bottlenecked vaccine manufacturing anyway.

Fwiw, based british friends telling me, sounds UK done pretty orderly job gradual lower age windows contacting people appointments mail, less centralized system makes harder identify eligible populations, also expanded eligibility groups super wide extremely early, I'm sure well would worked here. theast time anybody got paid vaccaintion injury ? vacancy rate include uninhabitable structures plots land sat speculative real estate investment?

There's lot NYC storefronts empty, buildings unused, speculation waiting perfect high-paying customer buyer. right, think really (political) reason forthcoming amazingly miraculous mRNA vaccines want piss hundreds millions Americans vaccine eligible right now. 30% natural immunity. u got asymptomatic hiding deep ur lungs Hi, general consensus whether immune compromised individual immunized cvd vaccine?
I would guessed brainer, get vaccine. However doctor actually recommending it, stating undetermined risk involved.  tests would still helpful person probably spreading covid anymore since burrowed lungs. good hear. heard that. Hopefully ends widespread pretty much 100% vaccine recipients. think guy point though, went get tested way indicate he'd vaccinated already. still case April 15th, I'll start worry. think newer strains virulent yeah havent seen anything says 5 6 state country? Nah, you’re dumb, tweet incredibly dumb. Even worst case scenario (variants hit US fairly hard spring, vaccine rollout slower expected), there’s way summer isn’t much normal life now. New moms getting vaccinated though. Pregnant women get vaccinated. I'm pop scheduled first dose. chance newborn could get antibodies incredible benefit, I'm satisfied reading experts current limited science say. speculate could potential overcome vaccine. 

And yet, says article mutation less antibody resistance South African Variant, Fauci already said vaccines able handle. nowhere article mentions though provides context, plays fear.

It's new virus, lot know, seems like media messaging always play maximum amount danger face uncertainty. Hypothesis evidence variant defeat vaccines? ""I anticipate time going effect vaccination"" studies showing significantly reduced chance transmission vaccine? ""You could still spread virus fully vaccinated, continue social distancing"".

The messaging virus getting weasel-ish point dishonesty.  J&amp;J covered data baby powder linked cancer, iirc.  ? we’ve ~4k cases almost daily last couple weeks. (somewhere around number. don’t know exact number) around 2000ish last couple days Yes, thank you. know healthy people generally lax guidelines outright defiant. Actually, virtually travel East Asia, origin new influenza strains  Attention. actual mandate, though? scientist article say that. Ok, and? suggestion scientist made hand sanitizer wearing masks crowded spaces flu season. Anything beyond simply making things said get outraged it.   FDA meets Friday  know. made choices lot decade-plus newspaper editor.

When leading expert subject gives line like that, would spectacularly bad journalism put headline. you? absolutely nothing misleading it.

There amount reasons concerned so-called Variants Concern. leading local scientist publish saying area already VOC spreading months. ""The devil already here"" conveys bit poetically, perfectly reasonably.  post replying ultra-conservative extreme religious groups, tend heavily anti-vax.

To completely incorrect. See comment. There’s like saying Americans tend antivax.

So thought trying say ultra conservative religious groups tend antivax people. bad. *riskIER

having child age 39 inherently risky UK pledged help nations develop capacity, seems like good idea ask help country pretty much half world's genetic testing? romans ever done us... wonder less restrictive public health measures like plexiglass windows regular cleaning subway cars helped, it’s feasible keep around even Covid’s gone. likelihood weekend early next week. 

The advisory meeting week likely take couple days formal EUA. bottleneck filling mechanism. bottleneck isn’t vials themselves, according person familiar, it’s manufacturing capacity fill vials. fill/finish process manufacturing must done aseptic conditions assure contamination, capacity premium.

You put vial place, add vaccine vial, cap vial, move place. 

The ""add vaccine vial"" step longest step procedure. Increasing amount doses single vial allow total doses approximately manufacturing 10 doses per vial. dose 0.5 mL. take long add 5 mL solution vial. Increasing 7.5 mL 15 doses per vial add small amount time process. anal swab..no joke get good you; need vaccines arms.

Of course, government sense, would distributing based age. we're not, we're still decently anyway, take fuckin’ Super Dutch Oven  Sure, live bubble next 10 years mitigate risk. humans wired meant live. high risk groups, stay home take precautions go out, everyone else start returning normal cases drop. estimate saying 26% people vaccinated also infected.

I think that's correct. example, children less likely either category. Medical workers likely categories, etc. ridiculous. far cautious friend caught months ago even left house groceries since last March. thinks got picking prescription meds CVS drive thru. Hope EU follows soon after. articles mention 8th March EU authorization, hope accurate. feel bad Canadians, EU people UK folks there. US states truly strict stuff, somewhat strict stuff that’s awful bad stricter states, lax stuff. places mentioned before? things like actual true restrictions interaction stuff like that, lot actually enforced. Luckily UK people get actual dates look forward to, even really damn stupid dates. hope there’s reversing it, least significant reversal. that's baseless conspiracy theory data laboratory tests flu show massive decrease positive tests year compared prior years.

[This season season  got thing Totally agree. can’t wait summer Hm...if flu would know? can't see anyone describe symptoms phone classed covid. I'm government paying back rent. prove unable due covid lock downs putting effort paying receiving pandemic unemployment. blowing extra $600/week get help. mess unemployment system made wrongfully denied, get help. equates less infrastructure needed transport storage. would heavily surprised amount vials bottleneck production. Considering Moderna vaccine stored -20 C obviously helps still -20 degree C extreme temperature like -70 C Pfizer needed equipment handling available without much problems. actually important data: 


Relatively small reduction antibody neutralization. would really expect reduce vaccine efficacy noticeable amount. 


50% prevalence California already. There's really much room drive cases growing.  people understand vaccine/herd immunity work? dumb thinking tweet wrong? since class race often linked rich communities happen mostly white.

Like said, class race US linked pretty safe bet say communities affluent. [Do think CDC fabricating data results roughly million laboratory tests Thanks Cool, long don’t demand others so. No. scientifically scientifically factually correct result data efficacy drug equal 65 years 6% 95% confidence range -1405% 94%.

That result experiment produced. fact.

The *interpretation* result means, made group whose job interpret results make decision, *""due small number study participants age group ≥65 years, statement efficacy safety elderly taken. vaccine therefore currently recommended STIKO people aged 18–64 years""*

So *the result* 6%, interpretation conclusion ignore (presumably) meaningless often actually diagnose flu? Maybe older people. roommate got sick, extremely mild stuffy nose, cough, fever. got tested negative. Two days later girlfriend got tested negative covid strep. one day later got little sick, like them. Nothing still. 

I’m nobody, I’m assuming that’s flu. brother separately got sick tested negative too. Maybe that’s also flu? large-scale developments Brooklyn Queens rentals, condo. Skyline Tower 9 DeKalb main exceptions think of. also specifically cited ""skyscraper condo buildings"", yeah, cited skyscraper condo buildings.

Also, pandemic, vacancy rate NYC routinely less 2%, natural since impossible consistent 100% occupancy. Shit left ""empty"" scale. Yeah administration tight-lipped masking go away, also live one stricter states would anticipate waiting see actually happens numbers spring making decisions. personal thought probably back normal, masks/no distancing soon early-mid summer masks possibly still thing little longer situations like crowded events. sure though. Obviously want gone ASAP, soon safe least. wipes disappeared U.S, (diluted bleach solution). I’m using home time, it’s basically effort spray bleach towel cloth wipe. beginning, didn’t wipes, would go grocery store wetted bleach towels plastic bag use wipe carts. Social distancing lockdown. Enough people wearing masks contain flu virus. Even people wearing masks, there’s still enough people wearing masks contain coronavirus, covid far contagious. 

Obviously it’s complex that, hear people real hard time nuance, let’s keep simple. Anecdote incoming: got second moderna Saturday morning. arm soreness general body soreness yesterday feel fine today. IT. First dose, even sore arm. everyone rough go. We'll get heard immunity one way another Different manufacturing processes. Moderna Pfizer could theoretically close swap manufacturing, AZ, JJ, etc different. imagine reading article making things think scientist might said get outraged don’t think damage done lockdown anything anyone would support prevent flu, bring question idea whether anything said hand sanitiser kept available shops transport hubs years come, argued “worth encouraging people wear masks” public transport busy environments winter months. J&amp;J EUA coming week right? Covid-19 also aerosolize, it’s less dangerous due smaller viral load compared droplets main vector?

I believe doesn't. rather hangs water droplets least order magnitude larger aerosols. heaviness reduces distance spread time hang around air. me, stores stocked full them, cans home already. Frankly, day day don’t even use them, use wiping grocery store carts wiping boxes I’m shopping. home use, spray cloth paper towel diluted bleach solution wipe handles, doorknobs, light switches, etc. 

I actually wonder there’s going big “bust” hygiene companies: hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, etc. B/c people hoarding much beginning pandemic couldn’t increase supply meet demand, yet they’ve increased supply dramatically, one wants anymore. Frankly, it’s reason heard companies U.S. didn’t want start making N95 masks, b/c initial costs quite high (the machines quite expensive), didn’t want pandemic pass recouped original costs (and, government didn’t back make sure could sell produced).  Daft Punk. Wait. Crap. Lots close interactions livestock interacting wildlife. really going post articles every reinfection? Isn’t we’re supposed wear masks? me, KISS become even geriatric 😭 Seriously. might end following mother’s lead couple months (she took Germany back States late December.) Mid February she’s already 2 dose vaccinated. high rate infection vaccinations, cabin Rockies looking mighty tempting 2021.. source J&amp;J production cut EU. drug-substance produced Netherlands go US fill finish. also fill finish facilities Europe (2), one South Africa another one India. doses come back EU according J&amp;J contract. news US, SA India planning steal doses, right? hope so, least. One gets relief funding, (in us) MUH STRAINS Fauci predicted least year fact don’t solid answer one main reasons they’re letting vaccinated people change behavior. argue healthcare workers? lives valuable, risk dying essential workers, hard replace half us stuck home quarantining healthcare system collapse worse everyone. almost every nation chosen vaccinate healthcare workers ahead older people higher risk death. FEAR! CONSUME! TERROR! BUY BUY BUY!

Put glasses see media really is. tested flu? lot people think flu reality bad cold. That’s wild dang Thinking long rot brain.

Would partner likely seek medical treatment instead hiding pain afraid catching COVID hospital? Would earlier treatment even made difference?

Who knows, dwelling much surefire way spiral. Serious question. Covid restrictions suppress flu, covid? makes different? started trending still tenths percentage people vaccinated (ie less 1%) long winter storm across half country.

While winter storm may causing cases lag due reduced testing vaccinations can't hurt, aremt things work here. Exactly. need commandeer pharmaceutical companies’ facilities resources. Merck’s vaccine junk. forced make Pfizer’s then. you’ve COVID don’t need vaccine. 28 million diagnosed cases plus asymptomatic mild symptom cases might 85 million total. 145 million recovered vaccinated. 115 million go. We’re ramping toward running arms mid April. that's completely crazy assume one year ""two weeks slow spread"" initial deal 200M+100M. EU really help companies set-up costs research, unlike US UK

Why EU help companies there's whole industry working EU? 50 plus years making, qualified labbor, tax incentives, whole network resources.

 UK US shows infrastructure place, EU companies infrastructure.

The difference EU exporting vaccines 30+ countries (Canada, Japan, Israel, UK lol) , USA UK export **ZERO** countries.

The production capacity Europe split 30, that's lol qualify vaccine 1b group? Like 65 16+ illnesses listed website Seeing general vibe I’ve got people EU AZ utter garbage, surprised people actually disappointed Scotland results preliminary one dose little said vaccines seems job! Don’t get wrong, I’d take AZ vaccine heartbeat think mRNA’s better candidates overall It’s almost like don’t think lockdown, also think throwing money people want lockdown would problem. give perspective position all. Yes, I'm sure that's every single one 7.3 billion people planet feel. much empathy aspect though guess. data shows could ""saved thousands lives"" year Covid banning gatherings, theaters, concerts, letting go in-person schooling travel, mandating masks.

Each person ask her/himself: regret supporting saved lives? no, make heartless, mean care lives? question forcing pharmaceutical companies produce one vaccines? Merck forced make Pfizer’s/modernas. it. interesting know uptake EU countries.

Also UK get given know vaccine getting chair sleeve rolled up. trump administration get vaccines ordered, yes. however handouts private sector agreements. one going hold vaccinating 3 years due bueraucratic red tape. process going fast-tracked regardless. That's non-accomplishment. that's thing well. said variant really spreading around since 2020, good news despite variant cases still going significantly steeply?

the media coverage around variants borderline irresponsible far providing full, accurate picture. desirable land, developers often allowed build huge overpriced monstrosities offer low cost suits. far natural supply demand. lot politics involved allowing certain developments inhibiting others, it’s huge circle jerk leaves anyone making 100k moving farther farther subway lines. logical case. masked (at least we’re supposed be), isolated others, washing hands community. think it, hell get flu pandemic? would mean following precautions. I’m attacking anyone makes sense. AZ didn’t get funding EU Wait second... though immune response killed you. immune suppressants. gives ? long expect immunity vaccine last? Knowing AZ now, probably minus 100 million doses stock US, lol. 

J&amp;J also build stock approval. magical stock now? either gross incompetence malice, really explanation. Yes. know? 

UK US export ban = good.

EU export ban = bad. Ah. silver lining. Everything one, guess. ""We failed hard, instead fixing problem, we're going put everyone level win."" - Trump level cry via international politics.

I understand push take like ""wartime efforts"" order transform existing factories would made different vaccines medical supplies retrofit production one COVID vaccines. Like turning car assembly line making wartime vehicles guns.

Yeah building entirely new factory would take way long telling places entire world COVID vaccines able made solely inside factories companies created them? I’m glad someone still knows works imagined 50 days ago.  venn diagram anti lockdown people supported politicians delayed relief incredible amount overlap.

That's demonized. Remember confirmed Covid deaths, positive Covid test. 

We seen multiple states issue adjustments death totals recently. 

There several hundreds thousands 'excess deaths' connected Covid 2020 2021. Covid deaths without test results. Deaths primary illnesses, Covid exacerbated condition secondary cause. combined number deaths Covid direct impact likely top One Million deaths pandemic subsides. Even true, blocking lipid export would also destructive country blocking cannot utilize lipids

Well yes, that's point really - restricting exports stupid suggestion damages What? EU take US funds produce vaccines?

No. countries paid Pzizer hundreds millions signed contracts vaccines. Pfizer based manufacturing orders Europe USA open beginning wanted do. EU banning exports point wholly different USA did. Scotland results show AZ better mRNA vaccine already unclear rates dropping fast everywhere - little vaccination effect yet

The holiday season over. generally meet people close quarters without masks outside home workplace.

That's Thanksgiving weeks New Years there's going wave. Maybe better question would invest better pharmaceutical production technology ten years ago instead waiting public health emergency. Yeah, especially school around friends kids, like normally would pre pandemic. think that's lot colds came exposure pretty much gotta nonexistent. takes effort put mask on, maybe try exercises. likelihood healthcare facilities overwhelmed probably close zero point, vaccines antibodies US probably close 40% population virus resistant. May number like 60%.

Restrictions need start lifting, clear weeks things like indoor dining minimal impact COVID cases. looking NYC vs NJ NY State former dining months latter 25%+ small difference rates. Yes, Germany Biontech, Germany, EU.
Same France Sanofi.

There ""EU"" vaccine initiative, issue. IIRC something virus attacks nerve ending responsible smell nose, could completely misremembering that. 

It especially frustrating first used cook living slowly developing food truck concept get back it. able smell taste scary fuck people wrap head around why. Yeah. I’m honestly really worried exact reason me? 2 weeks 2nd shot. Going go eat, maybe catch movie. start enjoying life again. 

Going plan vacation Florida parks August likely.

By June everyone 16+ wants vaccine going it. Even May maybe. Brexit extremely good call vaccine standpoint.

However:
- Brexit killed industries UK fishing
- Brexit led many small businesses failing can't figure export EU
- Brexit led issues Gibraltar Spain

I would say overall Brexit good call, vaccine situation yes, amazing. probably beneficial road Covid recovery, UK chip-in help Spain/Italy/Greece/France/etc. interesting sure. I’ve conversations people can’t understand would vaccinate people 65 older first. consider wasting shot. Well I’ll tell ya friend, 88% deaths virus occur 65 would stand reason vaccines would start no? We'll never know would right, since prediction based US taking zero preventative (unlikely) absence control measures spontaneous changes individual behavior, would expect peak mortality (daily deaths) occur approximately 3 months.  looks like EU population large vaccinated arguably better mRNA vaccines.

Hopefully, better protection high-efficacy vaccines compensate delays AZ vaccines, seems low efficacy E484K mutation invariably spread. end, shortfalls AZ supplies may prove blessing disguise. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* actually really difficult infected two respiratory viruses once. Since covid predominant virus many infected it, knocks lot vectors flu transmission.  fact sole supplier EU.

source may true I’ve honestly come across really sharp individuals Super back napkin math:

According IIHS 11.3 fatalities per 1 billion miles traveled, November Americans traveled 400 billion fewer miles last year according Federal Highway Administration it’s somewhere around 4,500 fewer fatalities averages held first 11 months last year. feeling paper pretty inconclusive. seems dealing extremely small sample size, problematic say least. right circulating months California's numbers plummeted post-holiday surge. 

I'm personally worried it. ""circling drain"" damn tell really feel week since got second vaccine, power level rising EU baaaaaaad looks like saw last Arctic blast NJ yesterday days news coverage likely gonna go back variants. Sorry, let clarify France invested Germany invested Biontech (less Americans though I'm mistaken)

The approach disjointed, EU investing, individual governments. EU paid doses customer, trying bully companies dictate terms prices.

I know France invested local top dog, Germany same.

Sorry clear. talking EU, individual countries. countries much less resources also lot less testing. conspiracy. saying America best LOOK ME, saying numerous articles much relative population actually tested many deaths actually attributed COVID countries numbers concluded probably lower expected. even happens America. “Extra” deaths. 

We 50x deaths South Korea. add “Preventable”. They'll eventually change mind, think, see effective one gotten vaccine grown third arm, something. That’s one way see expected shortfall, previously reported, comes big reduction supplies first quarter could hit EU’s ability meet target vaccinating 70% adults summer.

This wrong, nothing new. According [this 1st February, Germany receives 5.6M doses 40M Q1. Q2, expect 16.9M, 120M EU. new number even 10M higher expected far. nothing worry (yet). LA times post tons click bait stuff like that, get paywall. live LA follow numbers closely declining significantly. I'm starting hate LA times. Buy American. estimate including dramatic cut AZ announced today, much Danes rely J&amp;J (filled US) Curevac (efficacy known) Novavax? thought long time end June would realistic goal vaccination Europe, cuts announced today, think hard complete program end July optimistically beginning September pessimistically. could totally see this. favorite things don’t bring much happiness joy can’t smell taste like remember. 

I anticipate meal used crave, it’s let every single time.  get it. US vaccine export ban fine EU thing countries would reciprocate? case UK US? cultures consider leaving window open night source infection. Initial results Scotland suggested it’s better Pfizer Absolutely true. Great point thought process people like this, even bother people use talking points. 

They never given moment's thought public health covid, parrot phrases without even knowing they're saying. point there's amount talking reason change conspiracy theorist thinks world ends conversation. frustrating. Yes, never leave homes never get hurt. Gemius Why? Ok cut red tape quicken vaccination availability first place? Many opposing side said dangerous instead advised would take 3 years get approved. fact sole supplier EU.

Even true, blocking lipid export would also destructive country blocking cannot utilize lipids, would build mRNA producing facilities. take countries money first though, they?

What? EU take US funds produce vaccines? sure getting here. hope Georgia move past 1A April even seems like stretch now. grandparents mom able get vaccines Georgia major pain ass, drive like hour away another county get Statistically speaking, following heavy, chronic use hand sanitizer, likely, given point throughout day, sanitized hands. Also, possibly dry skin alcohol, lotion home. EU country lmao  agree teachers next, now. Im still debating whether better focus preexisting conditions essential workers compared strictly age. That's said.

All physical symptoms PTSD, none trauma.

I'll take stab ELI5 that's ok.

HCoV (the virus) enters body via breathing attaches soft tissue mouth, nose lungs. spread parts nose, mouth lungs also enter parts body.

This virus much ""destroy"" living cells invades much makes cell swell viral reproduction. soft tissue cells recover nerve cells, catastrophic.  

This nerve cell ""myelin sheath"", provides insulating layer forms around nerve. sheath provides nerve cell small layer protection small electrical signals nerve cells use function. sheath damaged, cells likely suffer two kinds problems, complete short circuit circuit all. 

Your brother likely lost either sense smell taste COVID-19 infection. time, circuit olfactory nerves (smell taste almost identical nerve cells). 

The nose mouth olfactory nerves connected olfactory tract goes frontal lobes olfactory cortex. cortex connections automatic motion system structures like amygdala. test after, remember amygdala involved forming emotional responses, particularly fear responses, memories (easy remember aint it).

Most cerebral cortex myelin sheath, gets infected swells bit, big deal.

If amygdala - essentially directly connected nose - infected damaged cause uncontrollable (seems random) ""basal ganglia"" responses. 

WTH ganglia? “basal ganglia” primarily automatic motor control, well motor learning, executive functions (breathing), emotional behaviours, plays important role behaviours habit formation.  thing babies squeeze hand palm touched, ganglia. thing babies learn always close hand palm touched, ganglia.

Normally, traumatic brain injury traumatic memory injury would come ""basal ganglia"" right amygdala.

The triggering injury memory normally results amygdala going full ""deer headlights"" mode.  High heart rate, elevated breathing otherwise unable move. instinctual behaviour humans still have. 

It much physical reaction. People say ""its heads"" understand much incidents physical nature. Scientists still really understand triggers. 

A person suffered trauma, treated anxiety medication cognitive behavioural therapy (relearn therapy).

A person suffered physical trauma systems treated anxiety medication growth stimulants (steroids, supplements, etc).

I much hope brother seeking receiving proper medical attention recover soon. It’s sad, I’m sorry daughter. Cultural rites passage important formative youth pandemic wrecked much many. Realistically much expect people tolerate #stayingathome? People's patience absolute thinnest restrictions lockdowns, that's simply realistic. bold move, Cotton. believe covid long lasting effects, also think lot confounding variables affecting general health days. We’ve socially distancing year material impact physical emotional health. gym, sports, working home, anxiety/depression accompanied isolation could contribute making people feel lousy. 

Again don’t doubt severe cases could impact someone long term, hear someone say might little short breath months, wonder much due stuck inside inactive almost 12 months. young healthy people Pictures made cry Sounds like Travelocity commercial Captain Obvious Great unsustainable. do? locking need get vaccine asap. shutdowns cards. take multivitamins every day I've always good front. weird something experienced now. low low. I'm serious vitamin booster lol. say anything good VA Hospital - good blood screenings. Every time go they're taking blood. isn’t true. summary interview US intelligence officer: guess whether believe  bit low Pfizer Moderna schedule, it’s unfortunately 200M March alone.

Pfizer said expect deliver 120M total end March, Moderna expects deliver 100M end March, 220m total them, meaning 110M Americans. 

But also, 3/4 week delay doses, **there likely many 110 Million receiving least one dose Pfizer/Moderna end March.**

Assuming vaccinating 2M people per day mid March, avg blended time doses 25 days, could closer 150M Americans vaccinated least one dose March 31.  

Add j&amp;J’s 20M could see many 160–170M least level vaccination end March. Dude think percentage people totally avoided hugs single digits. Maybe low doubles. Officially jumping line, that's harsh truth. information, NJ essentially honor system that's honest truth :shrug: Thanks; yeah idk guys think wanna get pregnant ASAP. told ""rushing"" wanting plan next 5 years get place appropriate child. figure get pregnant time, might adopt child age though biologically time. hit 40, maybe 5-10 year old. wish best luck going forward; may dreams come true!!! show NJ residence? live PA near Philly would take trip go  Nobody saying that. lockdown - didn’t - reality series stay home orders evidence shows significantly reduced spread. They’re throttling right avoid riots vaccination sites. 
“I’ve vaccinated! : sets mask fire : “

You’d riots. long rules apply everybody patience. “vaccinated elites” it’d chaos. Sigh...it's global conspiracy to... 
Uh... 
Make us stay home tank economy... 
Uh... Shops gyms open Virginia since June, death rate 50% lower. Nah Toots &amp; Maytals find difficult get excited promises future vaccine doses US vaccine supply delivered trickle last week. Even though specific delay due ice storms which'll eventually clear up, think betrays lack urgency part leadership. Surely someone transport run cold? least, surely US Army airdrop vaccines? Since leadership publicly exploring creative solutions deliver vaccines right now, think regarding vaccine drive enough urgency.

And given lack urgency, faith they'll able distribute large numbers vaccines promised. NJ Healthcare professionals considered 1a already eligible part received vaccines wanted. No. People still crapping fauchi trump demonstrably said dismissive stuff. Aug 4 birx warned surge would widespread rural brutal trump basically called loser sidelined her. actions someone acting responsibly national health crisis. Fuck want go live shows bad. “Iwasaki team set test idea two different ways. First, compared coronavirus spike protein syncytin-1 placenta, found ‘very, little overlap.’ Second, looked reactivity 3,000 different proteins humans antibodies formed result natural infection vaccination. syncytin-1, found none. ‘There scientific ground’ infertility idea, Iwasaki said. ‘It nonsense.’”

I 30 year old woman wants children within next two years. also want vaccine I’m Kindergarten teacher teaching person. 100% get vaccine despite scary infertility rumors may someone desperately wants kids, always full faith science Covid safety comes first right now. hope fears subside get data time, reassures others like myself. certainly happen shortly afterwards well.

The last thing want another spread lead bunch unnecessary deaths close finish line Claiming AZ hadn’t honoured contract also nonsense, designed distract EUs less swift roll out. 

It playing politics, poor. three fall weddings year postponed last year. can't imagine many brides going go ""oh, problem! Let's postpone another year"" restrictions come lol. I'm planning two fall trips already, cancelled earlier pandemic... unless new variant absolutely, objectively ravaging country... I'm going trips. thought Fauci said families could hug afterwards. mean, maybe means quick hug...that would disappointing. 

I think many people follow advice realistically. people vaccinated really matter.

I'd love see antivaxxers permanent second class citizens, couple months need largely cease exist (and it'll likely open forgery anyway).

By September literally nobody going care more. hear you, remember it’s numbers game. vaccinations, less community spread (hopefully). less community spread, higher odds vaccinated individual protected.

They’re throttling right now, need high proportion vaccinated population less prevalence. measures trending way, we’re hopefully close. Ya new york Asking real question. Highly divisive governments? Seems theme. finished vaccines recently first in-person session last weekend. good near others laughing. 1b also potential careers higher exposure though isn't?  


I'm VA I'm 1b early 30's career. 50 days today.

It's better set reasonable date postpone later. Murglgurgggrrggllll. Nowhere near me. know two people state Austria help NATO country, EU countries. Read named article. Probably want end. Ive seen lot comments past year people like socially distanced, sanitized, masked world isolation. Often people already lived solitary lives like everyone else. left Trump pandemic playbook response team.

Wasn't response team complete failure got lucky swine flu turned survivable Got it. dont know anyone died covid. Fauci never said matter bad faith interpretation words may infections? Don’t get hung deaths that’s detail wider picture. America insane number infections UK/Belgium far less playbook. would interesting see transmission rates dropped. Israel saw great success seems like. South east Asia pretty densely populated, there's half billion people living Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines Thailand.  Rich countries elderly people, well fat people people comorbidities. 70 year old obese people diabetes don’t exist significant numbers poor countries, they’d die 20 years earlier. covid fuck anyone, people like basically guarantee least become hospitalized get it. 

India example average age 26, whereas US average age 38. Yep make much sense literally data entire country. Lot give one damn shot everyone. 130 million americans vaccinated end march (if vaccines applied well)?

That's pretty great, honestly. 40% population already. ends happening, likely end april/start may, US vaccines everyone wants them.

This probably wildest 4th July american history. Everyone much pent energy emotion set loose.  love you. Common sense right here, come getcha common sense! herd immunity mean transmission, like measles, living reality. never get situation live normally transmission. vaccines' job stop people getting sick. 

The AZ vaccine significantly reduce transmission vaccine stop it. scenario realistic. accept transmission deaths every year. part life way since beginning human existence. worst already happened, worst still come? I’d go comment. “as bad” majority elderly people (the vulnerable) vaccinated? 

In terms overall cases, sure. cases literally won’t much harm many old people vaccinated. wonder restaurants going adapt COVID-recovered still can't smell/taste well UK already one highest death rates world current lockdown policy. Jury still out, lab results seems Pfizer vaccine produces [1/3rd anti-bodies SA compared original covid virus.

More trials need done figure much worse they'd real life, worrying Biontech Moderna enough they're already working [updating vaccines and/or adding booster respective vaccines. US already putting billions getting vaccine disadvantaged countries. Fauci say 2022? point comment? think that’s they’re trying do? Let's gooooo. Another point made given (as seemingly gleeful point out) States basically worst place world terms virus spread containment, also highest priority? don’t know live it’s rare anyone North America deficient vitamin especially winter. many cases Israeli evaluate against, Israeli Health Ministry said Pfizer vaccine six times less effective South Africa variant. cases people reinfected it. 

I don’t think Israel proves seem want prove. Way better it. protective virus previously infected. immune system far capable handling it. found number, long digging. USA spending 6℅ military budget Europe. Ofc resources ""return Europe"" spend US, think tendency overestimate cost. since mostly older people already retired, many Americans “out site mind” saying goes. 

I’ve unpleasantly surprised awful many know comprehending basic elementary school level science, able put one’s duty fellow citizens individual pleasantries, easily manipulated conspiracy media. Like little naive children duped Santa Claus ability critical think all. Lol chance catching Covid sitting 8 feet away someone else 0 talking least one wearing mask pretty slim none. Turns police useless except comes keeping lower class rising up. “15 cases going 0” one personal favorites. might agree weren’t significantly lower Covid death rate Japan. handled pandemic much like America except fact encouraged mask wearing early on. know growing body research indicates Magnet hospitals enjoy:

Increased RN retention lower nurse burnout
Decreased RN vacancy rate RN turnover rate
Increased RN satisfaction, eh? live anyone get vaccine. Lots healthy people 20s 30s getting it.

This true anywhere U.S. you? downvoted sub saying I'm worried catching corona long hauler cases, told stories people long term symptoms clearly ""anecdotal"" ""incredibly rare"". people now? veritable shot arm.

As someone who's already two BioNTech ""Pfizer"" shots, think news excellent.  triumph medical science.  Anti-vaxxx idiots GFTS. Yep, IIRC LA variant E484K mutation South African doctors saw caused reinfection antibody resistance. mean that’s way I’m getting might well fun. Also, things show clear pathologies. Others self-reported symptoms. mean real, also could due anxiety hypochondriacs caught this. Also, people may basically say amorphous problems multitude reasons. 

I believe people long term issues. Especially hospitalized. I'm positing reasons people may self reporting symptoms beyond actual covid injury. know Israel great test case Pfizer vaccine effectiveness. countries local studies Moderna vaccine real world, outside phase 3 study? curiosity since Pfizer vaccine seems get headlines. looking likely majority American adults vaccinated April. We're already close fifth. think we're going reach third around point Pfizer starts meeting goal- point middle March.

When cross majority initiating vaccine, maybe happens, think vaccine available anybody wants it. think indicate nearly everyone high risk priority group offered vaccine. think need explain would mean hospitalizations deaths. it'll mean restrictions going state state. already virtually abandoned them, others might go far wait herd immunity near zero local transmission. We're gonna see. almost like restrictions actually work! Crazy, right? “Political divisions”... let fix you... “trump boner” feels like we're getting pretty close game COVID. 28m confirmed cases (and assuming catch 1 3 cases, that's 90m ish actual cases), that's 26% immune, plus 13% population currently vaccinated least one dose (which seems like pretty close fully vaccinated), minus percentage overlaps infected vaccinated (say, 0.26\*13 = 3% ish). conservative, that's 36% currently immune. 

Assuming need vaccinate 70% population get permanent herd immunity, that's 238m people. 36% people currently immune, meaning 122m people, leaves 218 million left vaccinate. 

20m J&amp;J doses 20m additional people vaccinated, brings us 10% closer goal. even account increased Pfizer Moderna output Novavax. Huge step, great. It’s really close start opening everything back up. Everything. Keep wearing masks, every city America open things like go NBA games person soon. spring hits everything warms, people going tell year long quarantine restrictions go fuck anyway. link, select state. Collaborate listen! know others gotten error via NJ system well. know vaccination phases, jumping line. issues you, many older folks personally know struggling get vaccine NJ. wife person teacher officially eligible yet jumping line even though feel stupid prioritized. think flu project looked searches related directly ""flu"" flu symptoms. one looking searches activities outside home vs. searches stay-at-home activities predicted surges increase search outside activities. Record level public debt, soaring unemployment, collapsing academic performance children 👀. 

Nobody’s forcing go theatre, you’re welcome stay home, stop bitching rest us hospitals aren’t risk collapsing. might help reassure me; thanks.

Do know anywhere graph 7-day-average-doses time state? can't find page. simply possible unless economic activity stopped 6 can't lock ppl months time eliminate cases.

What’s realistic solution, mind? la one worst counties state? work hospital hit hardest Covid San Diego. systems hospitals magnet status. one work though. someone actually make doses shut hell many think produce? It’s talk far, like seeing stocks go thinking made money US 9th worldometers deaths per capita. would rank US's problems

\-highest levels obesity (aka mass preexisting conditions probably #1)

\-open travel (both international imported spread, interstate regional control). states 800 deaths per million secluded (Maine, Hawaii, Alaska, Utah, Oregon, Vermont) 

\-regional differences. super hard 1 sized policies spreads occur different rates different conditions. south suspect summer. north suspect winter. matter hot spot based nature disease spread people inside.

&amp;#x200B;

To defend US say first world (Europe/NA) gotten it. avoidance unless locked 6 months shut borders 2 years. Comparing US Europe, 2/3rds Europe 800 deaths per million including big major countries. Getting people go along everything 1.5+ years big ask Somewhat. think giant health issue surge skin cancer people diligently staying home much humanly possible finally emerge start soaking sun. single area country hospitals even near capacity now? 

Hospitalizations dropping like rock, continue vaccinations. That's valid point, may never know. Real world data pfizer vaccine seems suggest works even better expected too.

Even mid March becomes April 1st, that's another 50 million 1st doses June. really look like could early summer.  could. even participated vaccine trial hated saw around me. I’m proud initial response. sad country. I’m looking forward end Iowa we'll far 1000 infections current curve holds going nuts paranoid still adhering restrictions point believe it’s order prevent people thinking immune although question still research topic. saying vaccinations necessary everyone, I'm trying understand logic draw line eradication virus herd immunity. think either Westbrook Buckets seem wildly different. Jimmy awesome lately Westbrook sucks basic ways last years. brother's best friend died 35 it. Still feel real. saw last summer told shit I'm throwing big party look invite. Kills know I'll party there. forever, enough people vaccinated. likely months deaths / hospitalizations drop population adjust that, would 1.4-1.5 million adjusted population. send us living ones FUCKING MONEY JOE. saying isnt nice, comes kind symbolic still owes us $2,000 funded gain function research Wuhan lab there's familiar name one American scientists involved.

My initial comment partly incorrect. said 40M people received least 1 dose, 1st dose only. looks like roughly 23-25M people one dose, another 19M 2.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Early real world data Scotland published day two ago actually looking good keeping people hospital. Especially since Scotland laser focus care homes first, group looking would included oldest vulnerable. still spread virus others vaccinated. Masks people, yourself. tl;dr: Common Law Civil law

Also, Brits signed final deal day later EU's, buy much specific supply chains signed earlier agreement May. seems EU Commission's people less experienced knowledgable. Makes sense kind thing usually done national governments. agree, Id rather allow body fight naturally young healthy adult medical issues variant stuff overblown. Immunity original strains almost always carries UK variant, SA variant doesn’t seem prevalent contagious initially made be. 

The virus simply running ways spread. spread misinformation. speaking absolutes things yet know. “I don’t know it’s social distancing mask wearing that’s done [in reducing flu rates], think least conversations,” Prof Pagel added.
 
I think rather *solid* data hand proves wearing masks significantly brings flu even thinking imposing restrictive measures eternity.
 
Prof Pagel ""doesn't know"" brought flu already proposing miracle solutions.
 
I almost certain flu got basically suppressed covid likely almost completely unrelated everything else. data suggest April 2020... Don’t listen article. guarantee many parts US indoor concerts that. Like people know open south months?? baffles me. really though. 
18-24 year olds highest incidence rate, 0-13 year olds lowest. Overall almost everyone else bunched together middle. boggles mind. heard last year ""wait vaccine, wait vaccine"" people want get reasons. ffs. cautious also isn’t necesssrily good thing absolutely congestion anyone claiming confused (or worse), fairly common side effect flu even common cold.

For example 
de Haro-Licer, J., Roura-Moreno, J., Vizitiu, A., González-Fernández, A., &amp; González-Ares, J. A. (2013). Long term serious olfactory loss colds and/or flu. Acta Otorrinolaringologica (English Edition), 64(5), 331-338.

More common covid, lot serious covid cases around cases add up, still something known caused flu colds before.  think people saying wear mask feeling sick would help slow spread honestly masks need real sick time. businesses give little nothing way paid sick time. easy say stay home feel sick lot people option.  take number Covid? lists number studies put 2 3. So, let get straight, came article compares excess mortality Europe Sweden fits spread, point much better would done like Singapore? 

I quickly googling right restrictions found page: (phase 3 started December) 

and (phase 2 started June) 

Can outline measures Singapore took much harsh ones Sweden? Cause see small differences. fucking time Yea. This. FDA big hurdle, CDC also say. can't start shopping approvals done. [And here's Scott Adams, flu ""just asks questions"" flu ploy sell flu vaccines.

He /r/selfawarewolves level first speculation, SARS-COV-2 much infectious influenza, get logical conclusion. I've read possibilities. theories lay dormant 3 months pop back up, terrifying. theres also believe actual period immunity really low, based severity may short 3 months less. 

Either way, soon needle go arm going. I'm glad said work, think one key. number people (I also person) go sick go home silly. 

It even benefits, get 6 months full pay sickness year. fact work feel should, want let team down. Remote working makes easier now.

I also wonder lot deep cleaning offices helped.

I'm going pushing keeping masks organisation, public areas. sick rates (even Covid) went floor. boggles mind people dont question injection chemicals directly heart/blood. Im high risk, getting vaccine. happens new viruses pop up? people seriously going get vaccine every single virus moving forward? fully vaccinated *do* medical exemption wearing one! think half million people dying US kind bad thing, regardless whether that's ""every old person gets it"", maybe pandemic deserves taken seriously. free, then? Yep. pro mask used argue anti maskers one actually wanted masks long term need calm wear it. Well turns nut jobs believe wear 2022...No one gonna accept crap. vast majority vaccinated mask mandates need go. Perspectives local. I’m probably looking lens think happen Michigan. Yep. someone checks box says “yes one following conditions,” knowing lie, conscience. registration required proof diagnosis, would create logistical nightmare-millions people trying get note doctor time, arguments vaccine distribution site whether documentation genuine sufficient, even paperwork confusion.

Part hope lie condition insurance company learns it, people deal bureaucratic unpleasantness later. would physiology behind that? 

SARS-CoV-2 induces autoantibodies. Antiphospholipid antibodies list what's causing prolonged issues elevated infected individuals associated lupus-like symptoms thrombosis. said mostly anxiety hypochondriacs people suffering prolonged lockdowns wrongly attributing symptoms shortness breath covid sitting theri ass months.

It's hypochondria unless somehow explain rate higher COVID patients general population. study US. prolonged lockdowns unless call able go restaurant ""lockdown."" friend December (positive test &amp; symptoms), tested positive last week. sounds like believe second flare-up rather reinfection, think research say sure one way another point. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* may right. personally doubt I’m rooting it.  Three months duration study, timeframe data supports effectiveness. It’s definitively proven work three months, likely go far beyond that. going anymore vaccine approval make vaccination widely available end April? don’t want company let Asbestos baby powder handling vaccines. difficult ask veritable companies actually work this?

Of course want vaccine, course want sure works, likewise chances something, *anything* going wrong shown recorded. one hand, yes sooner get pandemic stop wear uncomfortable mouth coverings, sooner return normal-ish life. other, political climates, don’t know possible anymore. Throw three person kegger. Go it. saw someone post another sub day justified boyfriend hand mint saying “it’s okay use hand sanitizer time!” Like kiss? Thank much. coincidentally found stuff yesterday..I emailed Englewood bakery says appointments available. check holy name though. 

I called NJ list number said system since February 9! live whatever fairy tale want to. give facts give name calling. typical. lot evidence suggests stop spread. Basically hasn’t happened Fauci getting CNN saying “we know...” 
Down absolute zero? course not. That’s current goal.  It’s like you’re suggesting everybody shelter mask around family negligible chance get sick. own...
The context everybody room vaccinated anyway. ago broke leg April healed enough start driving move back parents' house. happens BANGER. April huge chunk country going vaccinated, healthcare workers/elderly/at risk people covered (unless purposely avoided getting vaccine). point care whether COVID media annoying people high school Twitter going back fucking life. us use daily basis clean, covid covid. still need them. get people suddenly learned cleaning covid. they’re added demand. vaccinated, please stop sweating stuff. Part Fauci never put position he's supposed defend postulate public policy press... would different employed US government giving opinion based solely expertise scientist, administration using surrogate policy choices rather people responsible said policy choices face it. wildly unfair Fauci (saying someone certainly biggest fan appreciate he's impossible situation). Pretty much every study said prevents contraction spread one powerful vaccine one shot, let alone two:   We’re never around unmasked work. [Dr. Jha feeling optimistic 78 days row 7-day moving avg number daily deaths COVID 2000 weekend, fell 2,000 first time nearly 3 months next week, it'll 1500 falling bit faster expecting Why?  Thread  predictions March 10, 1,000 daily deaths St. Patrick's Day, 750 could keep dropping Amazing Why? infections falling faster expected? Two reasons 1. Hospital capacity easing.  packed hospital means death rates rise Opposite also true crowding burden eases, doctors, nurses time patient Based data, proportion infected people dying weeks later falling good 2nd reason optimistic  entering point infections nursing homes fallen ton many got vaccinated January given NH residents highest risk death lower infection rates starting translate fewer deaths  nationally 70% since peak Deaths far 40% time, expect deaths fall faster cases hospitals getting less stressed vaccinations among high risk folks rising -- beginning effect  mark passing 500,000 Americans tools drive deaths We'll still lose thousands Americans variants still loom vaccinate quickly hold tight policy Horrible days sustained 2000-3000 daily deaths could behind us End

It's vaccines. race variants **we it!** think that's based 100% uptake sadly US also provide many vaccinate little extra saved up. bottom line know think it’s overall frustration. work home need wear mask go store anywhere I’m close people. understand people need wear mask 8+ hours day frustrated it. pre-pandemic wore mask flying catch colds easily didn’t like germy feeling enclosed space. Corner drown bath tub. Cuomo already killed majority people risk? No, need adjust thinking... virus likely forever. I'll guess 1.6 mill. surprised see 2.5 mill one day week guessing late week. Hope wrong though. sun get high enough UVB pass atmosphere yet. Therefore vitamin D. hope remember contracts others also behind on. people stop feeling need pre-emptively justify actions? going take get over?

“I went restaurant weekend, it’s ok outside”

“I group 3 friends come house, socially distanced agreed wear masks”

“We celebrated birthday weekend small group, agreed strict 14 day quarantine pre-hand” Someone posted (elsewhere without proof) vaccine lasts three months? impression weren’t sure long lasts three months conservative estimate. wrong?  literally last trial. Less effective, still effective. Fine UK variant, less SA variant, still 50% effective. vaccine South Africa going result. (and could easily wrong percentage here) limiting factor become willing arms rather vaccine supply, US want offload supply. wouldn’t offload second done vaccinating entire population. would gradual based trends forecasts UK's initial covid response adaptation influenza pandemic plan said, essentially, ""stopping spread flu impossible even try total elimination strategy?""

Anyway think we've learned *whole fucking lot* stopping spread flu. shame never able get people outside East Asia normalize wearing masks. boosting US even importing vaccines US EU, still delivering -30% EU? difference rates effectiveness due entirely mild asymptomatic cases? is, vaccine effective preventing hospitalizations fatalities, even moderately severe cases. hear wrong? could argue comparing essentially natural death, death caused mass violence made maximize scope catastrophe. incentive get vaccine deal another outbreak (and restrictions)next fall. Reducing spread much summer continuing mask wearing going help us that, since there’s going pretty substantial chunk people aren’t going vaccinated end summer. ... even 105 COVID death sentence.

People seem think every old person gets COVID died, far case. Depends who's reading this. open sooner. certain point it’s people vague underlying conditions spin job essential. Plus know people nurses save doses them. really preserved hospital capacity across board first months, subsequent surges hospitals certain areas (eg Houston) turn people away That's general consensus among sub though... Hearing things like ""masks another year"" we're supposed vaccinated summer hackles get raised bit. - 1,885

FIY careful comparing Belgium's number use different reporting criteria include suspect case. apple apple comparison. number always kids good keeping masks meant Moderna Pfizer mRNA technology others not. kids getting it, let's open schools! 

/s Someone make Dr. Fauci model Magic 8-Ball used one vaccine Ebola vaccine. Nice try want Hate wet blanket least third half population gonna anti-vax, embaraasing, gonna stretch timetable next year would guess. I’m actually. Part reason accommodations symptoms fibromyalgia practically identical Covid-19. main difference one co raviolis isn’t. way someone fibromyalgia know Covid get serious case wind hospitalized get lucky enough realize lost sense smell/taste. Please keep mind even lightest case virus serious lasting effects. someone already experiences symptoms daily basis anyway, many us sticking 2 dose routine. saying “China made lab” saying posible came lab interesting reasoning behind it, 
Like virus doesn’t transmit outdoors animals live outdoors. found odd honest, saying believe 100% find theories interesting.  Well that's happens give ""experts"" unlimited power, want let go. think Fauci wants go back page never paper? maybe numb either. mean, yeah. one reason advised introduce babies common allergens like peanut butter eggs early often. used recommended wait 2y/o. recommended 6m+.

Being around allergens gives child less chance developing allergy it. imagine this: since early data suggest pfizer moderna effective single dose, may actually possible delay everyone's 2nd dose extra month (maybe 2) double number people get first shot. would huge. Still get virus confined area another person. Thank - makes lot sense me! People acting like Canada wont virus beat till september later. 

Late May half Canadas population expected vaccinated. timeframe Canada beaten little pockets virus infections Canada overwhelming vaccination. infection sparse survive. enough hold Canada able withstand vaccinations+summer heat+Those infected resistance virus+extremely low active cases.

Yeah vaccination strategy great us. good thing need time around. able still beat compensating lack vaccines quick enough using methods hold virus till enough vaccine gets country Canadians arms late may.


Theres one way win here. Oh Lord, sincerely hope not. It’s hard enough wear work. I’m hoping masks soon.  guy breaks Earlier. I'm sure 30% 40% even get shot. see reason get vaccine. They’ve made clear I’ll still locked home social distancing mask 2030, there’s point getting vaccine won’t human contact anyway. Right. Mines since July 2020 guess never reopen then. Lets run businesses ground stay home forever. British mutation made R° level pretty much control Western Europe sharply increased cases raising again, new measures taken keep virus control. explain? don’t get connection Americans warn Fauci might shut up.

Once want shot their, talk masks distancing whatnot wants, nobody give damn. Well, family friends wear masks social distance bunch elderly relatives vaccinated. Sorry people life suck.

That said, people hold responsible people power could averted this. Blaming fellow citizens helps elites avoid taking responsibility convince otherwise, bother. want pedantic analogy, go right ahead. change fact cases dropping, we'll likely lifting restrictions summer, ending pandemic little efforts. burned out, stood around complained burned pissing while. oops, yeah, right. got country acronyms confused bit. friend ratted local news, feel comfortable defend yourself? exposed much air pollution would normally been? free right now? people US? I'd much rather high intensity lockdowns immediately response local outbreaks like australia NZ current slow burn freedom things worth outside everywhere go pandemic hotspot. Perhaps surprisingly, people color distrustful vaccine thus least likely vaccinated despite higher incidence COVID-19 communities. willing 53% 50% 48% 38% White Around 600k US citizens died cancer last year. Pandemics kill lot people. I’m fine memorial service year one month bit top. 

All us get current president cares previous president. There’s need make big spectacle things. focus every effort instead vaccine distribution save pity party pandemic with. we're using 87% available vaccines that's increasing every day said though? Correct. Pfizer formulation contain protein. mRNA, lipids salts.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine includes following ingredients: mRNA, lipids ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol), potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, again, proven vaccines stop transmission. Good helping far... situation good choices, think removing situation make choices commensurate risk wise decision.  That's 12.37 US dollars . saw interview Bret Weinstein Heather Heying (evolutionary biologists) saying trust Astrasenica J&amp;J made way made vaccines along Pfizer moderna new technology, seem competent trustworthy understand. I’m giving warning may similar state side effects put several days. That's say remote population areas need it. They're pretty much blowing away larger areas vaccination rates. Look small states, mostly rural. I'm nevada, basically two cities rural way gets. rural areas way ahead Las Vegas Reno percentage vaccinated. Okay? That’s neither I'd it, I'm especially moral person. Randy Quaid shape fly. Thanks useless clarification! makes difference she’s bedridden that's dumb fuck. 60 year olds need college aged grocery store workers. UK giving everyone one dose, second dose vast majority people figured much later 4 week recommendation. US opposite, even though leading infectious disease specialists (including Michael Osterholm) recommend UK doing. France would wise follow UK’s example, opinion. UK warning faster spreading B.1.1.7 variant, late. best doctors move affluent areas. surprise. Damn exciting  Good! great evening! that's what's gonna downfall. dare dewine want save lives. Google 'Levaquin tendon rupture' see outstanding 'family company' tens thousands unaware people (including me) antibiotic, crippling many life, Google 'Talcum powder asbestos' see many women got cervical cancer talc. 

Then tell gonna trust injecting vaccine you, child, parent, spouse, sibling.

Despite almost $320,000 hospital surgical costs, shitload pain, year twice week rehab, still can't walk properly stairs, downhill, uneven ground generic version Levaquin ruptured tendons connecting thighs knees legs within three days other, never able so.

If J&amp;J vaccine available, I'd get ready ventilator.

Luckily, go second dose Moderna week make choice. believe incompetent administration lifetimes admit fucked everything else up, managed handle vaccine distribution well Biden administration, including non politicians, dishonest hurt Trump? Wow, that's mental gymnastics. Same. I’m 1a got it. wife 1b still people 1a can’t get appointment. get J&amp;J vaccine get covid, contagious pass others? US detected it’s first case last January. could’ve closed border like countries did, failed even that. means immature bigot. packages, highly suggest ""quarantine closet"" even getting large construction trash bags place packages quarantine (turn bag inside pick package dog poop style).


Leave packages ""quarantine"" days. Covid dies pretty quickly cardboard &amp; plastic. Even better use black bags sunny balcony.


I high risk handwashing eczema terrible. mentally add days to.any ship time package quarantine. US government blocks shipments countries (which makes Biden look bad)

No, would make Biden look good. We'll share world done vaccinating people. Hell Johnson Johnson. can't get baby powder right. even refused chemical substances found baby powder. even... it’s LESS 1 case per 100k... realistic metro area. fact spell out, even now, disconcerting. 

The view everything said could garnered watching politicians CSPAN commentary. spin take. Reality biased. reality. I’m blaming fucking essential workers, jesus. drive-up orders groceries ways we’ve dealt it, it’s helped. takes lot risk parties involved. things countries implemented well, even stringent lockdowns, they’re idiots. That, fact CDC rejected PCR tests used South Korea favor making own, thus wasting weeks valuable time. started testing tracking early enough, COVID could well kept control.

All took simple things former administration picked hard road every single time. Contrary sub, people anything long lasting. sports tons positives. 2 actually long lasting issues. European country even close Taiwan Vietnam levels, countries less 1 COVID-19 death per million people!

In Europe lowest Iceland 85, second Norway 112. - Pfizer Inc expects deliver 13 million doses COVID-19 vaccine per week United States middle March, doubling shipments early February, top Pfizer executive said prepared testimony ahead Tuesday congressional hearing.  shipped around 40 million doses locations across United States far track deliver 120 million doses two-dose regimen end March, said John Young, Pfizer’s chief business officer.

That quite add up. Pfizer shipping \~7.8M doses week. shipped 50M end February, they'll need average 17M/week March hit 120M. Maybe there's expecting keep going up? Omg would wonderful I'm sure agree, provide source that? agree there's potential people refusing vaccines, right seems like overwhelming problem supply, hence work increase output distribution logistics.

For worth, think people see friends getting vaccine, office starts requiring it, airlines start requiring it, people end getting it. People might complain, tough – we're pandemic need save lives, time anti-vaxxers. YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I’ll wait can- 35% less effective-thanks thanks Seriously. also two friends fully vaccinated 2 weeks. Someone told it’s fair hang shouldn’t. What? I’m gonna go see people it’s safe! Ive literally seen posts peoples families talking family members dying days taking vaccine. friend Los Angeles places saying county reports supply shortages time. can’t rectify smaller places forsure probably won’t. Ask fucking Vietnam New Zealand. fine without crazy-ass doomsday conspiracy you’ve concocted.

You blithely ignoring actual things happen promote weird reality exist frighteningly paranoid.

These countries idea could prevent deaths permanent heart lung damage vaccine return normal life, guess what? numbers remained low able start vaccines widely available they’re already holding in-person school carrying without deaths.

This real world, dude. actually happened ignore that. dangerous. many family friends longer speak you. I've asked feel/any issues. said completely fine. never went doctor. people covid don't. like cold/flu illnesses. doctor ask anything. 

Covid serious. vast majority people isn't. Yes, get tested. Assume positive meantime. 

I would also give close contacts last days heads up. concern too, taking weeks/months get appointment state, even currently eligible (1A/1B). I'm phase 2 expecting April/May. vouch know young healthy people NJ given emails they're eligible. clusterfuck. US vaccine export ban. Aah sarcasm Yeah let’s reward places encouraged epidemic. get tested.  I've worked magnet hospitals. general suck. strict inflexible. Give non-magnet hospital day. Cedar Sinai. hospital amazing. feels like we're getting pretty close game COVID

Assuming vaccine-escape mutations. Star Wars fan here’s version information Ugh truth. I've got friend who's grandparents tested positive covid, one (his grandfather) died. However wife went huge rant Facebook die coronavirus pneumonia old age, mortified they're using husbands death kind agenda help make ""fake coronavirus look worse"" ""those power take away freedoms"". pandemic truly opened eyes much lunacy truly there.. Even suffering it, prefer place heads deep sand shouting everyone okay live fear. almost they're projecting kinda defense mechanism deep they're actually terrified pandemics scary worthy fear. I'd much rather live world covid19 exist fake conspiracy, world less scary. Dude, high going get positive response long mentioning lockdowns capacity ""end lockdowns now.""  tiktok really surprising. I'd imagine cesspool anything really get they'd place kids allowed Name one disease that's asymptomatic two weeks infectious could sweep

You're describing exactly polio world 100 years ago.

Sounds like still afraid virus. Yes. idea person said June. stupid thing say match Pfizer's statements like vaccines work....or something Yep rage middle east killed 3K us kill 500k neighbors it’s cool we're practicing freedom! fair, Japan kind super racist. I’m Central California. feels like fucking plan all. aunt MS immunosuppression medication date mid-April per plans here. I’ve sweating since last February go cancer center every 6 weeks; I’m scared death catching something. still plans people like me. lazy misrepresentation turned covid denier talking point Uh, don’t super young healthy population? Correlation != causation information completely useless without including data age many also underlying health conditions. Let's honest probably gonna take vaccines countries/regions that. increase like appears like that. safe Good point basically people can’t trusted honest. people pontificating personal responsibility usually committed personally irresponsible. Yes right NJs 1B includes first responders. Teachers, grocery store, food agriculture etc., also considered 1B cleared yet eligible.

The phasing outdated point, considered 1C (underlying conditions) eligible get vaccinated teachers still not. 70MM month. 60MM already done, 200MM go, 3 months adults go it. think they'll drop need appointments mid-April, struggling get anyone take June. don’t mind wearing one vaccine want others feel ease. don’t know I’ve vaccine. Plus, someone weakened immune system, don’t mind extra protection mask. course, ask year now. Covid would killed many, many millions short amount time (which would completely destroy health services kill many working front line too) zero lockdowns precautions taken.

Yeah part people seem trip on. arguments stay-at-home orders akin saying ""we give goals goalie net, need goalie"" That's AZ tests non symptomatic cases trials Pfizer doesn't. Meanwhile protection severe cases pretty much long everyone get mRNA eventually cool forget hold family friends refused wear masks socially distance responsible too. Maybe helps journalist may expressive. alas reference Atlanta too. BBC News - Covid US death toll: Imagining 500,000 lost lives look Let’s go. can’t wait see sub turn complete ghost town Yes are, results due later (May-June)

In principle agree. one thing I'd wait September, another May. 

I mean offered J&amp;J I'll take, get wrong. talking country-wide policy. That’s little early. See: Israel rates primary point lockdowns primarily stop healthcare systems buckling build health system capacity develop &amp; roll vaccines.

Well, think issue people contesting. people stay-at-home orders keep hospitals overloading. ""just save one life."" people seem mixing up. DeWine Ohio gives zero fucks front lines, it’s age him. feel like it’s glaring misstep take risk exposure consideration all. want safe. know whatever want want know it’s safe so. it? mean, asymptomatic Virus, vaccine response could worse actual sickness virus. lied severity virus. refused take measures would hurt stock market. downplayed virus got benefit reelection. lied timeline. rejected pandemic playbook written exactly cases. suppressed distribution N95 masks Americans via postal service. promoted lupus medication later found harmful. implied disease killing 4000 Americans day sort hoax. Yo - 5% people require hospitalization, think waltz good new? cost damage (and lost labor potential) tens millions short long term health consequences staggering. History look kindly upon antimaskers covidiots. concerts maybe something push back, within two months restrictions, including mask wearing gone. We’re point vulnerable population mostly vaccinated US. Continuing restrictions political one, scientific one point. reason get fired people like guy jump front laws. frankly bullshit know patently wrong anyways. “wrap mind” around fact 2019 2,800,000 Americans died? That’s much bigger number! Oh, sky falling! 

The opioid epidemic killed 500,000 Americans, yet neither Trump Biden particularly concerned- certainly willing spend trillions fighting it. 

Death natural part life, us die disease accidents. Scotland, average age COVID19 death males 83, male life expectancy normally 82.5. Yes, there’s 10-15% excess mortality, that’s lot. typical COVID19 death someone would otherwise died pneumonia heart disease 2021 2023... They’re due provide significantly 50 million 1st doses then, aren’t they? actions include personal protective measures everyday use (e.g., staying home ill, covering coughs sneezes, washing hands often) communitywide measures reserved pandemics aimed reducing opportunities exposure (e.g., coordinated closures dismissals child care facilities schools cancelling mass gatherings). 

It things pandemic, anything added epidemiology experts. hate BS is. Taxi drivers, grocery store workers, etc. get shot NY. since 2/15 cancer patients immune compromised get shot. Season over. game.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* NJ currently ""honor system"" asking everyone make sure actually elegible. he's kind, idiot commander chief live India. devastated 1918 flu much next census actually showed drop population.

This time around people got covid recovering easily.
This disease old obese young healthy impacting developed world.

However Japan must sort cross immunity everything open still high death figures spite old population Asthma lists - including CDC. you’re steroid (like prednisone) asthma, could enough qualify might explain what’s going on. Yes, one big spike feb. 17 since cases fell *slightly* slower last week still fell regardless.

There 9,845 cases feb. 18, 9,050 19th, 7,162 20th 6,094 21st.

That’s hardly evidence cases going back seriously... 4 days enough seriously predict trend based 7-day average increasing mere 3.5% especially considering that, again, cases still going mostly downward.

If keeps going like weeks, sure talk. I'm going disagree here. review write contracts essentially living.

Include definitive, otherwise would use broader vaguer language ""including, limited to:"" distinct difference 2 uses. Include explicit list exactly included. That's enough fully vaccinated 2.3M DAY, starting week. suspected. splicing fragment sentence imply something state. so, misrepresenting comments. Even egregious shameless unwillingness correct it. lot things possible. similar attributed lethargic encephalitis 1918 flu... think people say lethargic encephalitis probably separate enterovirus outbreak type illness much common enteroviruses influenza.

Lot conjecture we're going wait see happens. concerns though I'm pretty certain there's lots problems US could throw money two solve problems, won't. Isn’t j&amp;j trials 2nd booster shot? I’d cool getting one shot j&amp;j getting booster later rather potentially wait another months mRNA vaccine good point
that may even matter Pfizer Moderna deliver promised doses time. may enough let everyone choice April may. Ok, cool, exist. Wherever probably better job managing past year did. us dumbasses well aware rest world exists much better job did. Still putting fingers ears bc won’t care suffer it. Again, population 1) longer scared virus since evidence anything going increase hospitalizations deaths 2) getting defiant anti-lockdown day?

I mean think political cost come due Lockdowns? I'll tell right reinstating Lockdowns influence vote greatly, even agree public official things....Lockdown impact it'd one main reasons vote.

This sustainable way moving forward, can't surprising statement. question really wear mask vaccinated?   

Yes, several reasons varying degrees validity. Yup. undiagnosed diabetes. bunch health issues associated endemic fatness. million dollars started speaking quite fast People downvote want don’t go damn near 200,000 cases day month accident.  restrictions gone means ""pack 1000 people shoulder shoulder indoors concert"" we're gonna month. mean ""all businesses, gyms, restaurants, bars, etc. capacity limits curfew times dropped"" yeah, definitely start summer. decisions go driven course disease going, ""but want to."" I'm hopeful coming soon. Europe yet one producer vaccines track far, everytime someone posts Company X increased production amount Company going produce Company x care anymore going USA anyway. reason major companies decided expand EU factories export ban like US could sell promised US side extra cash. Alright dudes. it. Life going change fast. Like nba playoffs full crowds fast.

130M addressed thru vaccines supplied end March. 100M estimated already infected then. That's pretty much herd immunity right there, enough 60M (at least) addressed per month April onwards.

Just getting March supply arms April means herd immunity memorial day. People crying streets long weekend. I'd agree, given many doses mRNA vaccine US July aim also herd immunity, think makes sense leasy eventually vaccinate everyone mRNA. fear everyone gotten vaccine US sell/donate extra doses. improved logistics cold storage requirements J&amp;J make much better remote locations away large population centers. widespread basis, 70% effective vaccine still going substantial positive impact effective R numbers. yeah discounting rest world, well fact true herd immunity close even USA mid summer earliest - STILL SICK PEOPLE then.

So - even optimistic original statement made pure silliness. spend money throw weight around fix problem, america good it.

Good governance compliance face profit loss? Nah.  people spout bullshit conspiracy theories here's free one: kills people certain genetic markers crazy high rates could attempt eugenics... Preach mean, personally, international travel pipe dream best (like ""maybe 5 10 years travel internationally"" pipe dream), closed borders much issue me. Already answered insane shit different comment. $5,000. Put money mouth is. Two years, someone dies starvation due vaccinated, I’ll pay $5k, not, way round. say “exactly” say opposite said.

Countries locked hard strict border controls well Vietnam except countries Asia Pacific region, plus remote sparsely populated countries like Iceland Greenland. Therefore, theory explain data. 

But you’re attributing “opinion,” I’m going continue discussing you. love masks totally screws police-AI facial recognition surveillance state taking big mid sized cities days. seems like difficult question answer. seem pretty trusting everything guess hindsight's 20/20 probably change mind current situation 10 years well   Lol, antivax community there. Use judgement. always could visited prior vaccine. Get tested, quarantine negative result comes back, visit precaution. 

I hear many people say seen anyone year. understand that. places least good 8 9 months good weather could meet outdoors. get tested, quarantine, visit.

Go dinner. wear mask distant strangers. vulnerable persons vaccinated I’m done masks social distancing. Plain simple. person doesn’t take vaccine, it’s wear mask keep distance me. It’s year I’m done. Thank you. We're different sides coin. us serious long running depression, looking months months barely interrupted alone thoughts - lives also put risk lockdown. Although course understand necessary literally hand-picked single country

Au contraire, UK touted upthread example US poor. Belgium one. What's CFR? Drum roll... 2.91%. Another victory socialized medicine! UK healthcare awful. I've experienced US UK. treat dog UK.  previous evidence kids likely play smaller role spreading coronavirus, CDC researchers dug trends one Georgia school district. (CDC illustration via Courthouse News)(CN) — Teachers likely students drive spread Covid-19 schools, according new study researchers Centers Disease Control Prevention. Small group exercises put teachers students close contact may source transmission seven cases, researchers found. think government cares live die fool I'll take bet guarantee someone die starvation due unable vaccinated within two years. gullible think elected officials best intentions heart? think there's wmds Iraq still? think bailouts 2009 happen good? think Santa Claus real? Exactly, you’re trying theorize justify opinion, ignoring action (or inaction) countries like US. could’ve closed border like countries implementing strict brief lockdown. Instead 500,000 Americans dead, 35 died here. point behind vaccinating grocery store workers interact general public every day can’t job remotely. Even they’re risk themselves, still large vector potential transmission. OK, add everyone ""front lines"" much % wise adult population that? healthcare workers 1a states. look teachers, day care workers, factory workers, grocery store workers, sales people, waitstaff, cooks, flight attendants, bus drivers, clerks, cashiers, anyone still told go office, anyone works close proximity others... mention add anyone close proximity living situations like high density housing prisons. think add anyone able isolate working home currently get something like 75%+ population. ACTUALLY make sense prioritize factors? proposals I've seen variation certain profession thinking ""deserve"" go first, considering professions meet risk level also. couple factors UK's numbers comparable Florida, main one people believe due B117 variant. Florida anywhere US affected much UK was, numbers would tell different story, we'd even worse shape.

I understand argument. also frustrated indoors excited take mask go back normal. saying obese people expendable horrid. told you, ""Hey, wait another 2 months somewhat careful wear mask hang big groups, save 3 obese people's lives,"" would it? That's we're at. little bit time, we'll vaccinated done thing. time give up.

How elderly people? parents? Grandparents? People auto-immune diseases? Cancer? choose old vulnerable, choosing go pub, saying lives matter ability fun.

I can't tell sick stuck indoors am. It'll almost 2 years time I'm able see family. care keeping vulnerable family friends safe, care keeping *your* vulnerable friends family safe. hope care others seems do. Sorry bad title. TLDR; Pfizer Inc expects deliver 13 million doses COVID-19 vaccine per week United States middle March, doubling shipments early February, top Pfizer executive said prepared testimony ahead Tuesday congressional hearing. fuck? You’re insane. I’m leftist weirdo. Fuck Bill Trump. never believed WMD’s Iraq know Tuskegee experiments crime humanity. You’re fucking insane. ""It's also possible, though research increasingly suggests unlikely, vaccinated people could still transmit virus, even fall ill themselves. ""For reason, want make sure people continue wear masks despite fact they're vaccinated,"" Fauci scientists disagree you. Fauci disagrees you. think trust vs. Internet poster. article speaking Vaccine Alarmism fact harmful. good getting media attention. kind crazy think us inside houses almost entire year vaccine plan April that's entirely possible

Because people clearly can't use sound judgement, jealous, zero self control, vindictive. need punish everyone else. reason mandate masks social distancing shut places down.

But nobody authority ever told anyone can't visit friends relatives. Ever. risk assessment. Get tested, quarantine get results, visit proper precaution. Simple that. Nobody stopping anyone so. Nyc big west coast cities still like this. majority people wear mask even outside nobody within 10 feet them. agree, especially abundant vaccine supply coming right end college year. Colleges logistical capacity make sure large groups young people get vaccinated quickly, single-dose vaccine probably work lot better timeline.  DONT KNOW LMAO. vaccine passport required get food? mean don’t get vaccine government force starve?

How this. $5,000 bet never happens. absolutely insane, nearly feel guilty taking money crazy person, you’re awful. Absolutely, fixed rollouts even held til could figured out. colon removed colitis open heart surgery kid still can't get it. 3 days first shot, super sore first days okay now. Experiencing mild headaches chills Great news! 

I wonder side effects like since it’s one dose shot, compared Moderna/Pfizer, people say second shot pronounced effects Source pls? submission linking businessinsider.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

You also choose go without unless around someone vulnerable crowded enclosed space like airplane. You’re looking numbers wrong dude. 66% efficacy symptomatic disease, it’s preventing 66% symptomatic disease would occurred otherwise. vaccine, chances severe disease symptomatic (ignoring age stratification) around 10%. 66% efficacy symptomatic disease, reduction severe disease, EXTREMELY unlikely get severe Covid even less effective disease. hear wishing mRNA vaccines, J&amp;J vaccine still extremely effective preventing severe disease death. didnt claim caring lol. said doesnt get sick. Hey, that's awesome! Congrats! (we'll fever stuff, know mean!) would venture guess anything else may working pressing thousands deaths day. Holy shit, strawman. putting absolute metric ton words mouth.

Nowhere said go back normal right now. I'm literally agreeing you. I'm saying celebrate right now. I'm saying **things improving, likely continue improve, due vaccines.** I'm saying there's light end tunnel.

You seem think acknowledgement something good disregarding bad. We're still shit, longer. messaging ""vaccines matter new strains"" makes people give up, vaccines protect new strains, what's point? accomplishing exact opposite think does.

You gotta let people hope, it'll end hopeless. Right now? Things looking better while, mean over. People want pretend there's pandemic frustrate too, man. ones trying find hope it'll lifetimes? Leave alone.

Also, already point needing boosters. zero (0) evidence new variants, gotta stop calling strains, that's are, unaffected vaccines. means statement paying people feasible today’s economic climate, given trillions debt. payroll tax healthcare costs increased much, cannot afford increase salaries. Government jobs contend looming trillions debt helicopter money thrown around. It’s likely another decade stagflation like 70s overall increase salaries and/or benefits. ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Canada increased influenza testing substantially year found outbreaks, mostly Ontario. may lethal think Switzerland AZ even approved looking sell doses bought. ya know lot places test COVID also test flu plus stuff Santa Clara County California checking in.

Awesome compiled!  happen humans flu reunite unclear. Every skipped flu season adds pool people haven’t yet infected, including young children may never experienced viruses all—saplings fiery virus’s woody playground. Even among adults, immunity expected wane time: Without annual reminder, certain bodies might forget it’s like fight flu lower guard. “Susceptibility increasing population,” Bansal [a disease ecologist Georgetown University] says. People reduced immunity “are like fuel flu fire. fuel available, easier outbreak guy talking physical sensation needs quit  I'm confused. trial data supposed reliable? wasn't, pass peer review get approved? thought that's trials for. maybe think good plan would prime people AZ boost another. trials effect researchers think could actually confer superior immunity.

I agree. concerned seemed like governments going one declare pandemic ended ""everyone's vaccinated"" ""immune"" even though they're not. they're researching planning boost people's immunity getting vaccine reasonable level would help us achieve herd immunity end nightmare all, that's great. hope so. area CA, 65 year olds still trouble finding availability shots teachers supposed shots reserved can’t get anywhere mid March. Macron wants try harness power improve things, happen, simply negotiating/working group 28 countries, always winners losers within group, countries interested losing.

I mean unilaterally buying Sputnik vaccine part EU brazen move, care. shows much power EU really members.

I wonder latest ultimatum get members reopen borders gonna work not... pat other’s back, praise saying fantastic job done. really. sloppy executive order wording, bans exports vaccines US procured.  necessarily ban exports vaccines countries procured (purchased).  head Operation Warp Speed even know exactly EO would enforced.

What's relevant, US contracts Moderna likely Pfizer keeps exporting. know German company sending USA? saying covid flu thing? covid no-one testing flu? NYC apartments old school radiators best. windows always open winter, cool apartment one ever radiators apartments, cant control them. Thats going say. seems unlikely won’t get approval J&amp;J stating 20 million doses ready end March they’ve little iffy manufacturing aspect hopefully holds 20 million. Gotta hand Biden. He’s really gotten Pfizer Moderna get us WAY vaccine doses said could get us. 

In early January, Pfizer said would get amount contracted for. passed opportunity more. Pfizer would available starting JUNE. 

Biden done phenomenal job using defense production act get far vaccines ready go United States. Perhaps virus mutating time.. science supports fomite surfaces little concern, articles like published? confuse people make anxious could get infected. I'm saying absolutely can't get infected fomite, overwhelming majority data last year discounts this. Obviously Clorox public company seeks leverage messaging make money, think misguided. Waukesha, call 211 information, sign sheet vaccination week February 22, following public health entities begin testing vaccine registry communities:""

So beginning sounds Expo Center community vaccination site.

I called Department Health Human services((262) 896-8430), said tier 1a only, started 2 weeks ago. sign newsletter texting word WAUKESHA number 22828, part newsletter signup given link signup page qualify. Healthcare workers people 65 right now. Good luck! US Government. Stop trying ridiculously analyze simple statement. articles Moderna Pfizer vaccines use That’s interesting thank long fucking takes whilst still deadly thing we're dealing with? Obviously? 11.7 million right Hey bet asshole lose sensitivity though! Eat ghost peppers ""taste"" way out! I'd worried overdoing taste stuff.

Also, must suck :(  perfect test circle Ass dragging? vaccine approval lightning quick.

And rich folks absolutely affected pandemic harms consumers workers. start placing bets origin location next fear mongering strain media decides focus one? Mmm...I’m familiar US healthcare. healthcare quite good problem people don’t actually access it. 

Here’s quick example: grew maybe lower middle/middle class. ultimately became reasonably successful. recently cured cat kind cancer let kill grandmother, time didn’t bother treating weren’t wealthy. People accepted end. huge, huge disparity access kind technology US.

It’s like bragging foreigner America’s ability take space neglecting mention personally aren’t allowed get craft - gives wrong impression. everyone needs go space, everyone access healthcare. [I tweet much, 11 months ago, suggested National Day Unity celebrate getting pandemic remembering ones lost. Biggest nationwide BBQ Cali variant way less vaccine resistant SA, SA effect thus far. swear editors getting desperate guys tiger woods got car crash go fetch go go good boy goo focus that!!1!1!1!1 What's hilarious situation poor governance EU commission (not EU itself) cost here. Month late signing contracts put fraction money usa UK down. 

Had country creates dynamism positive would done better. 

As Macron dissing efficacy AZ vaccine.... Well turning effective UK preliminary data. think immune system atrophy? know vaccine keep immune system strong eating properly keep strong too, long fine. like muscle need keep working keep strong. Infact working immune system worse you. Around 1 million doses gone people 18 somehow? I'm definitely underlying conditions, surprising thought state opened underlying age yet. See reply above, post lazy Reuters hack reports 'sources'.

Look way EU governments trashed AZ efficacy results misled people... Macron - 'Quasi effective', Germany - '8% efficacy 65s'

A bit different real data coming out, no?

THERE EXPORT BAN - liar. fact, lying. spamming stuff days.

IT'S CONTRACT.

From [UK contract, Introduction Purchaser Central Government Body third party beneficiary certain rights granted favour Licence Agreement.

From [EU contract, 11 Intellectual Ownership. Commission acknowledges AstraZeneca pre-existing obligations upstream licensor \[...\] case report talks fact bronchoscopy (camera lungs) bronchial washings testing future. asshole birds pigs done terrible job wearing masks social distancing. Last couple visits Target, blowing hand sanitizer like 10c bottle. Overproduction much? Lol, I'm trying dictate shit - said wrong put things bag, right? That's OP did.

Pfizer making deals Latin American association? far I'm aware dealing country individually.

Also, USA UK waved liability, corrupt countries - basically risk management. far deal liability EU one (except AZ vaccine, bought cost).

This discussed last year, openly Europe. mention corruption fear fraud. basically avoid massive legal clog. That's why, case EU, also financial compensation anything happens. would not?  Yeah honestly restrictions basic hygiene issues clearly lot people follow (washing hands, covering mouth cough sneeze etc). really fucking gross think many people see norm annoyed theyre ""restricted"" lol... There’s room, interaction others. part parking lot reserved. injection, guy put post note windshield time made 15 minutes injection. directed line, nurse standing guy monitoring times. bunch lines, nurses/monitors. would walk make sure everyone ok, time passed, wave us by. never got car whole thing.

And it’s done groups cars. waved tent line 6 cars. nurse car, got injected time, moved place place time, etc. unbelievably well thought out, organized, executed. I'm waiting Clorox injectables cure 'rona.

/s, obviously. already prioritized groups. Lol that's happened Toronto. open wave 2 'bad feelings' wave 3. data btw, feelings. Yes agree would better. point, though, either neither free are. fact pay $20 month insurance 100% covers vaccines mean free. paying $20 month taxes come 100% covered vaccines. wait EU country leaders start shitting EU Commission EU presidency handling vaccination situation. I'm assuming Philippines strictest reopening plan country Nasal swabs show positive result virus present nasal passage, thus comment deep lungs. Im shocked testing Hydroxychloroquine vets.

Just fuckin shocked. Korea US completely different. can't cherry pick countries make argument look good. makes sense. idea 24 year old teacher get vaccine 64 year old never made sense me. 

Teachers truly risk, definitely deserve prioritization blanket group.  hilarious stupid people don’t get man, working person gets screwed circumstance need take responsibility themselves, rich person gets screwed sudden it’s time government take downsides. 


“There in-group law protect, bind. out-group law bind, protect.” Good ""The process boost capacity Spanish hospitals research centers sequence virus already underway,""

"" specialized training takes time. going implemented time \[across Spain\].""

I understood UK one locale, Cambridge, bring everything there, rather trying duplicate every region, seems massive waste dilution resources people follow them.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* No, never claimed was? said nobody authority ever told can't visit friends relatives, I'm demonstrating statement incorrect. Fauci says wear post vaccination; I'm going listen leading immunologist one. seriously worried?

No. Especially second shot, recommended, probably totally fine. realize eradicated would come from? Since flu numbers low year vaccine next fall likely accurate less mutation. keep thinking used vape mod could make pretty sick clouds could travel 20+ feet dissipating, imagine virus particles hitching ride cloud I’m pretty sure viruses know season is. don’t eyes, brains, nerves.

It something physical like environment, temperature, moisture, way humans behave, etc. Thank much, link exactly needed. figure? I'm curious heard/read. It’s something she’ll likely fine missed entire year holidays told *Miss year celebrate safely next year.*

Well next year vaccines out. excuse restrictions fall. Sure, money allocated already. Additional funding necessary this. huge amounts aid form tax cuts building restrictions property investors decades. Asking landlords take hit interest public health -- like businesses close doors -- completely reasonable. Ok, understand NATO aggression north america europa, makes think austria would involved it?

Austria kind support german afghanistan mission, UN mission. ISAF NATO lead UN authorized.

I guess without UN authorization would moved.

What consider ""western"" ""UN"".

The war terror iraq call UN authorized, small number countries joined effort. obvious link terror made could really join. Really glad I'm medical facility. Got first dose weeks ago I'm getting 2nd dose couple days. work, getting vaccine likely June. goes medical ethics. US strict laws regards bodily autonomy. can't withhold info goes someone's body. someone wants wait mRNA vaccine, choice.

Also one going track ""pass."" People simply sign-up vaccine keep staying cautious mRNA one available freely. No, US tracking flu normal. Sure Anecdotally, know couple stayed together one person covid others didn’t get it.  waiting game. really know long truly prevent infection.

But I'd imagine 2 dose vaccines fair better. conflating two different arguments straw man. 

This season took combo flu covid tests rule happening year.

In early 2020 lacked testing look someone determine Covid looks like flu cases late stage. see massive drop flu numbers last year one wanted take chance.
 
Below last years flu numbers New get flu every single year? US significantly wealthier England spends lot money per student England does. flu cases lumped corona? I'm saying everyone 70 died tomorrow flu season deaths next year would really low. there's way know deaths Covid year would flu deaths next year. Excellent perspective hospital worker, indeed new flu. understand conventional flu vanish. However, greatly reduced due extra precautions taking covid around. drop precautions, dealing again.

Globally looking several years reach herd immunity. studies putting high 7 years 70-85% coverage. quick fix remotely close eliminating global scale. think lower bound may high. average may something like 3 weeks infection death 1 week death reporting, lower bounds like 2 weeks 1 day. upper bounds unlimited, deaths backdated.

Although vary greatly location, data comes essentially Colorado deaths reported symptom onset day day death. average ~26 days infection (onset-5) release death statistic, would give average ~33 days vaccination decline death. ~100% deaths reported within 60 days infection.

Note values overlap added them. see difference testing turnaround deaths turnaround comparing graphs worldmeters: countries Europe differ much 30 days (implying fast test turnaround significant delay either death reporting death). worries. virus. plenty similarities viral influenza virus distinct SARS coronavirus.

I found helpful:  us disaster already. It’s much joke. Always love comments lol. Immediately assume everyone internet uneducated educated field comment about. Quite interesting read. 

To answer condescending question though, no, extensive background ""biomed"" education. *do* however aunt educated microbiology, talked extensively. said based *her* observations *her* history dealing microorganisms. trust believe her, everyone company. 

Besides, rocket science even someone like field. Anyone look see past infection rate extremely high, thereby creating immunity amongst *a lot* people.

Anyways... great rest day! Hey Doc...I vaccinated I'm feeling well...

There. also impacts texture food comes across too. months haven’t able eat salad without taste smell toppings, feels like eating ball slime.

I’ve seen articles indicating people extended loss feelings depression absolutely see that. can’t smell good things, instance - smell rain/an impending storm one favorites, nothing. also can’t smell anything bad - smoke, even personally smell. husband directly comment come home gym haha. read measles transmitted air 100 feet away. scheduled first shot PA, one step closer worry crap anymore feels good. Hang people, we're almost there! mean? 20 y/o sagittarian, trust her? could simply Pfizer Moderna better providing data, successful trials J&amp;J. Could also two working vaccines cases plummeting they're little cautious one. seems impractical best. would go that? We're target top 1918 flu outbreak ridiculous thought beginning are. Pandemics messy vaccination effort unprecedented, I’m thankful whatever good news point knowing situation could far worse places testing swabs flu COVID. There’s probably flu testing year ever before. Yeah, pandemic testament potently transmissible coronavirus ability population adhere public health measures. I’ve tested year. I’ve never it. much GOF research little zero transparency, particularly funded NIH conducted China Wuhan Institute Virology. P4 lab Wuhan (P4 exceedingly high biosafety level designation) first kind China, also first Asia. opened 2017, U.S. scientists expressed concerns that, considering China’s opaque administrative structure, one killer viruses “escaped” lab, could cause doomsday disaster. (GOF) research involves experimentation aims (and actually does) increase transmissibility and/or virulence pathogenic viruses. GOF research typically involves mutations confer altered functionality protein, molecule, organism virus. research (when safely conducted responsible scientists) allegedly intends improve understanding disease-causing agents, interaction human hosts, and/or even potential cause pandemics. concerns safety GOF studies voiced numerous scientists beginning. matter anyone justifies spins it, GOF studies manipulate pathogenic, deadly viruses increase transmissibility virulence. Within field virology, studies create ‘chimeric viruses’ defined new hybrid microorganism.  created joining nucleic acid fragments, two different microorganisms, least two fragments contains essential genes necessary replication.  type research proven historically unsafe. Serious questions arise whether GOF research development chimeric viruses necessary understanding viruses considering potential deadly contamination (pandemics) bioterrorism. 



Here's more: know, based published research articles and U.S. federal grants to EcoHealth Alliance funding WIV’s coronavirus research, WIV stored hundreds potentially dangerous SARS-like coronaviruses, performed GOF experiments on coronaviruses collaboration U.S. universities, were biosafety concerns with WIV’s BSL-4 laboratory.
But far, independent audit WIV’s laboratory records databases, little information exists WIV’s internal operations. WIV removed website information as the 2018 visit U.S. science diplomats, and closed access virus database and laboratory records of coronavirus experiments conducted WIV scientists. professional networks associated the Wuhan Institute Virology (WIV) and EcoHealth Alliance, U.S. non-profitthat has garnered millions dollars taxpayer-funded grants to collaborate with WIV on coronavirus research, have written that novel virus likely originated via natural selection in animal hosts, with its reservoir bats. This “zoonotic” origin hypothesis strengthened by claims that new coronavirus outbreak started a “wildlife” market Wuhan, the Huanan seafood market, potentially infected animals may sold. (However, least one-third first cluster infected patients, including earliest known case infection December 1, 2019, neither direct indirect contact Huanan seafood market’s human animal attendees.)
The zoonosis hypothesis currently prevailing hypothesis origin. However, zoonotic origin SARS-CoV-2 has yet definitively established, researchers pointed rests upon contradictory observations that require further investigation.

Approval drug given priority status generally takes 6 months submission. Look PDUFA (Prescription Drug User Fee Act) better idea normal timelines. They're fucking around this. Pfizer got advisory approval Friday, shots arms Monday Tuesday. Murphy reopened stadiums yesterday?

I think he's got secret plan crash state's economy election year. half dozen? eat eggs breakfast reinfections. I'm reading? [He's slowly changing think he's realized gig up. choked said ""Right virus control."" They’re dick. Many people don’t identify either “he” “she.” “They” includes everyone you’re unsure. It’s really better say “they.” Lots deaths preventable, choose tolerate deaths. Eg nosocomial infections kill 100k Americans every year — could eliminate obliging healthcare workers always use PPE, would rather tolerate deaths. Likewise could ban cars prevent road accidents, etc. reality eliminating preventable death never goal — it’s always balance freedom living risk death. Winning. /s Queue new variant!  doubt that. Freedom press would somewhat difficult show article damaged Astra Zeneca way. really claim lost sales considering vaccine currently sold profit even fulfil contracts already have. discussion involving word ""normal"" makes cringe different normal mean different people.

I'd consider things back normal hang indoors, unmasked vaccinated friends go restaurant together... others consider things back normal fly internationally without wearing mask go jam-packed, unmasked concert anywhere world. shown months ago infections happen families (which inevitable) workplaces. response targeted workplaces, instead public places people meet short amount time? industry simply government pocket. Many companies forbid employees reporting contacts tracing, discourage taking test, threaten let go ""cause quarantine"". going much unless real problem tackled, hygiene theater - also good business companies linked government officials selling masks.  That's major misunderstanding Chinese culture. American propagandas love demonizing China, fact trust government good track record brought 30 years fast development. Americans used trust government Roosevelt, now. got laid July, started contract gig zero benefits, save one: since healthcare one fields really hiring, get vaccine much earlier otherwise would have. (Can't specific nondisclosure) Yeah Same, scandals regarding products giving people cancer makes nervous them. manufacturing simple. license manufacture every lab make it. 1. July, 16. Otherwise fall.
2. really know. So, correct democrats distributing vaccines voters racist basis? (That claim responding to.) That’s alwas worked. immune systems build overtime every bacteria picks up, especially childhood. first shot rough. Knocked butt 3 days.  Italy high population older people. numbers higher.  now. amazon should.

America first. want believe badly.

But Biden Fauci saying re-iterating Christmas/into 2022 last days? overly cautious estimates? really hope they’re gratuitous estimates, cause hope next school year literally thing keeping going hanging less thread, seeing Christmas comment days talk spring/summer nearly in. It’s ideology behind statistic. 

The Holocaust affected .002 world’s population correct statistic, that’s f***ing point it. still one biggest evil atrocities history. 

The goal lot statistics cited dehumanize minimize scope catastrophe. Happy cake day, u/PoopUmbrella. May rain poop day. Distancing ? Lol. That’s given June 1. great vaccine ensemble2 may prove even better two doses. Win win. One dose great protection see 2 doses better. get it. would wait Produced loaded term. Components vaccine made over. J&amp;J particular cultured US packed Belgium. it’s “produced”? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ amcs list go see 3 movies week. buy free popcorn drink vouchers ebay $2 bring $1 boxes candy dollar tree. snack good triple header marathon   mexican: Thank you!!! Though I'll doubt happen lol cares ling stops hospitalization. mean what’s point vaccine then? depends want define normal. I, example, define threshold normal COVID gone, rather deaths hospitalizations look like.

If 60% adults least one shot May 1st, 90% 65 younger high risk groups point, think we'll normal summer.

Nobody cares there's 30,000 cases day 100 hospitalizations 10 deaths. That's sad truth, deaths fall number deaths due car crashes (about 100/day) there's little chance major rebound, even governors strongest lockdown proponents hesitate open everything fully. Italy large population older people .Countries put people ahead profits tended better controlling virus hey u/Hal-9000r 

Since don’t prevent getting spreading virus… Neither vaccines**. 13 months exposed virus 99% population still remain healthy. tell actually research indoctrinated leftwing media deception.

How explain this?

Vaccines waste time? friends family total shitbags this. ""I want wait guinea pigs go first want yet"", me: 25 million guinea pigs gone already get damn vaccine Hopefully stay closed Finally. We've waiting long. may ask around. know area mass-vax centers got pfizer shipments weeks straight hospitals got moderna. even can't request one, may able control one sign up. Pretending closed borders big deal cedes ground racists. gives they've always wanted, wrapped way people like accept it. Advocate emergency, temporary closure borders must, must always emphasize much sacrifice is.

Besides, thought intentions effect whether act racist. Closing borders racist, period, matter it. Context matter here. Black brown lives do. Yeah phrased weird - mean they'll gone another whole year, they'll still gone while. Hopefully long :) law getting reason. She’s also nurse. It’s unbelievable. nurse gets information internet. county medical form doctor sends county medical officer. really tight gets here. family practice help all.  Good luck mate, I'm sure crush it! They're horrible company tortured millions animals reason. would decline. Yep. 100% reduction sending hospital good enough. OCD know hard stand stuff like this. stand it, go bed night coat hands FAT layer Vaseline stick pair old socks. Sleep like promise look feel much much better morning. Vaccine passports regular businesses unrealistic.

Vaccine passports international school proof vaccination school/university totally different story, totally normal. Johnson Johnson. Central California. exactly. people splitting hairs many us low risk anyway, vaccine enough protect. lower efficacy prevalence variants times locations J&amp;J ran trials. know mRNA vaccines would performed circumstances. key thing J&amp;J 100% effective preventing hospitalizations deaths, despite variants. Extrapolating this, point might well absolutely anything differently even exactly 100% populace 50 states vaccinated right? *can* still infected right? Nope, NJ 16-64 qualifying pre-existing conditions conditions unclear they're self certifying anyway, ""honor system"" call Yeah fair amount discussion bit precise definition. seems ridiculous vaccinate people high-interaction jobs. Obviously age biggest mortality factor, past shouldn’t priority eliminating ability spread? dunno. Best luck. Nope. Give ASAP. Lets go going happen. going keep everything lockdowned everyone vaccinated.  mexican: answer gave huge boner. much panic porn. technically said didnt take context made seem unlikely likely We’re distorting anything pointing accurately aren’t using full quote misrepresent it. Funny trump lovers claim anyone else exact bullshit you’re actually doing.

He didn’t mean pretend clear full uncut quote. Sure, keep believing that. Reactionary lockdowns ineffective lockdowns; imagine NZ waited high death rates lockdown? would lockdown strictly 3+ months instead 3-6 weeks!

The UK chose wait things became disaster instead trying prevent one. ask doctor. they're likely screen things sign up, least show up. ask bunch screener questions haven’t sleep study generally good amount energy tired throughout day, seems main symptom UARS normal sleep apnea. admit though sleep study something I’m interested try point. Pretty sure I’m nutcase tho realize everyone passes vaccine, means risk societal level, right? extra 20 million potential infection vectors population months takes produce enough vaccine options cover them. either-or problem. There’s reason can’t get another vaccine point it’s widely available. reason couldn’t continue take precautions. would want unprotected greater length time?

I low risk category live covid-conscious life, would make great deal sense give people like slightly less effective vaccine waiting supplies become available. goal reach highest level protection possible population level shortest amount time. know people like compare two, going forward Covid new flu. Odds end needing yearly boosters it. continue mutate us long time. flu vaccine take increased significantly year? Maybe wearing masks won’t normalised country get much higher take ups flu vaccine, help lot. getting first covid vaccine shot (second one next week), got headache. Fairly normal, happened brother well. Except (and possibly everyone else) subsided within day two.

It's 2 weeks since first shot, I've getting daily headaches ever since. I'm claiming side effects vaccine last weeks, make much sense.

I'm asking whether possible vaccine acted sort trigger migraines (I'm 32) simply never surfaced? come sub daily dose good news morning coffee. I'm hopeful ill able return work everything goes back normal peer reviews? inspections facilities? Phase 3 trials? long-term testing data? Biologics License Application submitted? Committee approved application? Based science? 

They sit table “recommend” approved? Today, yes, OK.

Once vaccination available everyone city? Nope. “brave” might wander hideout yet, don’t jinx it. So, free. Well, wonder apply mRNA vaccine technique we’ve developed Covid flu might get future benefits effective flu vaccine. yeah, near term we’ll probably see jump, long term we’ll see less flu due vaccine tailored quickly effectively. true, Gin way cut awful bitterness quinine.

However today's tonic water much less it. order get anything resembling dosage drink many two-liter bottles.  environmental impact (I would assume) quite little compared masks, plus helps eliminate diseases would spreading time year. suppose initial comment madness totally clear. I'm absolutely fine now.

But April/May, vaccination slots open anyone wants one, I'm done.

If pockets vulnerable people still unable/unwilling get vaccine point, becomes problem manage, mine. Europe expect companies automatically act interests. EU done good job securing vaccines, rather blame government, guys blaming everyone else. reason governments US, UK, Israel, Chile, UAE, India etc... able secure lot vaccines quickly....and governments faltered. Judging number fucking idiots wearing gloves wearing mask nose, people learn anything. common sense common decency first place going magically appear. hoping pandemic would teach people better sick lost hope.  think many people wanting remain locked mass vaccinations, think that's Fauci anyones intent working current federal government. 

The political reality know need ensure there's still mass compliance vaccinations going. said people fully vaccinated need mask, we'd probably deep shit (although much less due vulnerable elderly vaccinated point) make educated guesses. said, virus randomly rapidly increasing fatality rate likely happen.

So based know, good educated guess shut matter government says it. eyes ears, know cases going hospitals seeing pressure removed.  reason care businesses state governments reference CDC guidance. Personally stopped caring said may. elderly dad's doctor told vaccinated April. county still two phases I'm eligible. insane slow going one worst hit states slowest state vaccinations live slowest county state.  I’ve waffled maybe wearing mask I’m sick over. Instead think I’m going actually take sick days, 100% getting flu vaccine every year. don’t know stomach wearing mask over. Certainly worst Nordic record terms deaths. mile. counting deaths measuring stick. makes e.g. moral sense close schools save, say 1000 lives nation 10 million. would wrong. reasonable balance. closing schools would save 50 000 probably right thing do. numbers discuss. pandemic management minimizing lives lost, believing moral disaster.

EDIT: clear, saying Sweden handled epidemic well way. less loss life better functioning societal functions. lot stuff clumsy. No. free wear mask whenever want. forcing children loony toons. Obviously 22,000 deaths good, according Worldometer Canada ranks 57th deaths per 1 million. Thats better Italy, USA, UK, Spain, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Netherlands, Germany, Greece Russia. 

I think I'd classify horrible. probably elsewhere US focused piece. Remember Super Bowl spike? Neither anyone else. 

It’ll fine. little bumps there, regardless happens. That’s endemic viruses work; we’ll dealing one forever, like ones. contracting flu one year increase immunity next year? They're going deliberately delay doses.

For example, employer already second doses pending. 

I give 4 weeks max get second dose (of Moderna vaccine). Please approve it. game changer. piece seems US focused, probably EU made news public yet. vaccines EU made somewhere EU. Whatever manufacturing improvements probably apply too. can’t read article, it’s behind paywall. say US importing vaccines Europe? thought Pfizer supplied US plant US.  know old ladies hoard plastic bags? That’s going generation disinfectants. I’m always going hand “just case.”

I’m going miss mask too. feel safe secure wearing it. exhaustion whole pandemic really hit today. days bother me, days think about. optimistic whole thing- experts saying masks next year etc really drive nuts. please open everything full old people get vaccine. longer afraid. We're losing valuable time lives virus. depends upon union stand is. stand everything subvert person. care anyone else, try help them? 1. waiting critical mass vaccinations. issue people want cautious wait even that. 

2. Yes, even pandemic there’s thing cautious.  Ya I'm agreement Yeah, got that! Unfortunately, really. flu plenty animal reservoirs, back soon serious prevention measures return. beat flu forever, we'd mask forever. 

That said, covid gets rid culture powering sick instead staying home work, certainly help. even everyone. wear one feeling weather. work home (if can't get sick time). American healthcare system fucked haven’t heard information lately, but, remember studies blood type susceptibility. Type resistant infection, type susceptible. Maybe enjoy natural resistance. 

Which say shouldn’t get vaccinated, course.. everyone needs vaccine.  joke us. That's thing that's certain. CT show late term infection would likely evident nasal passage time? guess caught due virus early incubation stage lungs. expert im looking potential fail reasons outside negligence  hope bureaucrats finally grow spine finally ban EU vaccine exports US, UK, Emirates, Saudi-Arabia, China many more. Giving small percentage supply could delay vaccination program week so, would help immensely Africa. I’m it! Hear! hear! mate! 37000 people. 76065. county partnered Tarrant county. setup zip code priority system, weren’t priority. way, family going New Mexico wedding late May-early June! better cancel again. think safe date.  I’m pessimistic. fact don’t see vaccines would protect us. 

When hear scared vaccine might work variant. can’t help ask “then this?” wonder going lock us make us wear masks every flu season. think bored home lot better going outside potentially increasing number infections/deaths Absence masks feature normalcy. covid, could travel world almost effortlessly. ability travel part ""normalcy"". probably get back 100%.

Maybe city, state, country pretty much free covid ever socially distance wear mask anywhere go day-to-day life. Maybe allowed travel (and back from) neighboring country.

But, really think year now, able travel freely prior covid? think localized outbreaks hotspots monitored? ...except brushing teeth 2 times day instead 3 doesn’t spread virus killed millions people hear you, people level immunity, harder disease spread

Not necessarily. vaccine shown effective moderate severe disease, transmission. Think it, 66% effective **moderate** disease, chances significantly less effective **mild asymptomatic** disease, all, also transmissible. AstraZeneca similar stats (it's 62% effective symptomatic disease) 27% effective asymptomatic transmission, means seen much terms stopping spread. mainly alleviates symptoms reduces hospitalizations deaths. That's it? Seems kinda low. assess drop risk? Would fine Moderna/Pfizer domestic production USA restricted export.

I mean, understand American government wants get virus USA control first. Totally understand that. things ""under control"" think able export doses neighbours at-risk vaccinated quickly. go back time, find examples users predicting normalcy November, January, March, get lauded.

You also find examples users predicting *against* normalcy November, January, March, get downvoted. totally get fun aspect this, mention least 1st dose vaccine probably saved life? least know doses coming from.... Difficulty breathing month afterwards...sounds like knew someone post viral reaction long covid went remission people do. actually know someone gonk realize 😂 guess makes sense getting vaccine tomorrow - bad anxiety. ok smoke marijuana night help get rest avoided? Everyone part stop talking duration pandemic stop killing grandma. /s saying you’re wrong, hasn’t debunked? vaccinate teachers gonna inperson Wearing mask go inside store minor inconvenience.

Lockdown minor inconvenience. comments despite article clearly explaining know it’s case England. It’s obvious worldwide many cases would considered flu thrown Covid category year.

Is evidence flu causes positive COVID test? saying people fabricating COVID numbers regardless test results show? Probably got bus honestly. Public transpo cesspool. You’re right, announced trial results Jan 29th, waited Feb 4th apply approval. Thank links! I’ve curious phenomenon haven’t time research myself. No, people realize that. 

The hardest thing convince take something better exists. ""Not death"" enough live 50% lung capacity rest life take better one. Taiwanese government deal worked directly BioNTect, Fosun sue BioNTech violation exclusive agent contract claim compensation hell. Yep - bullshit scientist said bullshit publish headline. Sameeee luckily state one successful vaccine roll outs country. Im supposed able get summer hopefully!  optimistic prediction point majority Americans (See edit below) would initiated vaccination end April. I'm beginning think that's reasonable prediction one high hopes, I'm beginning wonder might hit early April.

And still possible production distribution ramps then. sounds reasonable.  agree can't pretend exist. often wonder would've worked would've actively protected risk patients let everyone else resume daily life archieve herd immunity people risk fatal course disease. That’s science works case clickbait headline got blown proportion people read rest original article. stated figure people age 65 statistical significance. relevant paragraph article (translated Indeed: final judgement degree protection seniors Astra-Zeneca vaccine cannot yet made; research data still pending. problem: clinical studies pharmaceutical company, older people apparently relatively poorly represented. three studies data available far, 660 less six percent test persons 65 years older 11,600 participants. Statistically meaningful results effectiveness vaccine could therefore determined studies, noted British regulatory authority MHRA, nevertheless granted vaccine emergency approval. limited information available age group, even though nothing suggest protective effect. New Zealand full lockdown March/April last year. strictest time.   218 million left vaccinate.

I think meant 118 million. 122m+218m would greater US population, unless I’m reading said wrong. 

Around 120m full vaccinations would get us herd immunity *very* simplified model. model fails take account reduced transmissibility among populations (children) increased transmissibility among populations (middle-aged adults develop minor symptoms). also doesn’t account differing effectiveness vaccines.

But way vaccination going far, I’d say we’re going reach functional herd immunity within 90 million full vaccinations. Easily doable May. Seems little low must great insurance. wouldn’t taken year actually listened epidemiologists beginning. 3 months tops well executed lockdown followed effective contact tracing scheme, would back basically normal. week, likely administered weekend early next week. age least makes sense. know hospital work home people vaccinated. Age directly related risk factors, easy determine. overly cautious, bad messaging. No, *need* wear mask couple weeks getting jab. get sick, spread significant amount. ""experts"" want convince people vaccines unimportant, please, keep mask vaccine crap.

And goal ""well, appearances such"", adding date certain drops - example wear masks April 30 vaccines readily available want them. aren’t wrong even people downvote (it’s throwing bad news good news post). 

We hope long term effects minimal kids continue learn more, don’t much besides that. 

And make sure parents keep sick kids home. Parents awful before, hope one thing govt learns strengthening employer mandated sick family leave. business owner says can’t afford that.. basically saying want sick employees want schools host sick kids business run. 

My work gives 1 week year addition regular leave take care sick family members. got too, we’d 2 weeks sick leave kids. everyone fortunate that’s awful, that’s schools turn Petri dishes. Good you. Otherwise, really fuck point?  think so? that's thing, North higher skin cancer rates South, pandemic not, due people staying inside winter. Best 20 dollars EU spend much time thinking defense China. Take look map see many mountain ranges, deserts, seas countries China Europe. see cases deaths continue rise lockdown starts. normal progression virus gets taken lockdown.Infections also continue inside households infection cycles bit long lockdown effective breaking chain transmission see big drop caes month. many lockdowns half hearted took half measures almost pointless. That's lockdown working done right. Convenient excuse. I’m sure that’s was. Yeah shit are. criteria somewhat absurd, across board. next week, state (CO) open 60% adult population. 

Seriously, everyone point? 60% population actually risk? Oh, four things increase chance covid, last eligible group. disaster ask me. wear one vaccinated don’t get confused one assholes wouldn’t wear one all. 

It‘s probably smallest inconvenience image. 

Plus may catch regular cold flu either. require ultra cold temps insert

but things change.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pfizer vaccine doesn’t need ultra-cold storage all, company Hopefully we'll get tour end summer. Pfizer done recruiting for, iirc, 12-16 year olds, Moderna middle recruiting similar age bracket trial. Pfizer expects results months. They'll trial next age bracket, include 6 year olds, cover school age kids. Good news sure. [Johnson &amp; Johnson wrong President's Day Yeah it’s pretty silly actually want states countries others 99% open. Granted things looking better states still many restrictions place actually make life enjoyable imagine. valid comparison. said 1 3 adults give birth every year, someone said know anyone who's given birth despite knowing dozens adults, might point. Yeah different illness could much preventable.  Death rate also insane. personally know least 5 people died, cremation wait week high queue.

And STILL insane people claim real. probably valentines day voted down, 100% true. I'm drug addict dangerous stupid shit daily living worried [my life choices inadvertently affecting someone else].

You're walking contradiction know it. least honest it. estimates actually infected people around 120,000,000, there’s likely additional immunity population. (Uneducated napkin math:) Even 1/3 vaccine bucket protection, that’s another 40 million (non scientific speculation). puts number potentially 200,000,000. That’s looking towards 60% plus, creeping towards herd immunity territory. wonder World Bank willing pay it. contamination perspective.

how?

5 sterile needles filled ***before*** injecting 5 arms?

where opportunity reason really poor countries used pandemic

used what?

&amp;#x200B;

we time kinds called “pooling” — it’s new concept. Pharmacists years everything flu vaccine chemotherapy medications antibiotics. involves taking what’s leftover drug vial combining what’s left another vial create full dose.

&amp;#x200B;

if nothing sterile needle touches vial, ZERO opportunity contaminaton.  Congrats!! Unless you’re California. They’ll probably stay 2022 2023 :( half kidding blatant lie.

Africa nothing forgive China for. China never colonized plundered Africa took people slaves.  think way. think Fauci awesome job. However - read data us react. Yes, technically ""the way virus go away every american vaccinates"" definitely true. really need stay closed 100% gone? thought 'slowing curve' entire thing - goalposts keep getting pushed sounds depressing hell, country in? I'll travel internationally year somewhere let dystopian nightmare. know healthy young person got two shots still caught virus weeks after. catch get sick, grandma. Jfc dude, I'm out, really time this. ""you're right"" worth time effort. ✌🏻 Wooooaaaahhhh seems like fuckton vaccines Truth hurts sometimes need face nonetheless... That’s polite way putting it. Maybe millions Americans die every year various causes. still trust liberals plans. Agreed. saw comment like “hahahahahaha California, won’t” Let’s tell truth - Fauci others comparable public health positions make $400k/yr extra career stability time like this. Prolonging “dark winter” benefits people others, it’s easy say “hunker down” one 6 figure income stability. It’s honestly ridiculous doesn’t get pointed ever. 

COVID real, can’t go back normal months vaccines - when? People get COVID yes.

But data suggests go pandemic endemic foreseeable future. Making situation way desirable. Moderna made Cambridge, MA. Pfizer Michigan somewhere. Maybe read article. rate vaccination, rate cases. Loooool work J&amp;J think they'd playing games data. get go, upfront going take shortcuts, going release something safe effective. said, given option pfizer/moderna J&amp;J i'd hands pick pfizer/moderna. I'd take J&amp;J nothing sure, think data we're seeing shows vaccines superior, least used clinical trials. think J&amp;J probably potential better results studies showed booster. yep.

and folk Alberta want look numbers/projections figure availability.

nor want admit world wide distribution. Fauci can't give clear answer depends state far along vaccine roll priority list. states faster others. looking current daily vaccinations I'd say July everyone offered vaccine would anyone possibly turn tikTok Covid advice? Hola That’d pretttttty cool tbh also disingenuous ignore multiple Biden administration officials said Trump's rollout vaccine total mess real plan. Remember, Trump administration even bother ordering enough vaccines vaccinate whole country. 

To believe Trump administration would competently handle vaccine distribution failed handling anything else competently pure wishful thinking straight revisionist history bullshit. help never federal backbone someone health anxiety, that's first thing thought. guarantee bunch people got scared health mortality first time covid, basic anxiety symptoms

Heart palpitations? Diziness? Shortness breath? Brain fog? Brother welcome life past decade. I've every test sun, nothing physically wrong me. I'm sure lot genuinely physically effected covid long term I'm certain reasonably sized group placeboing fuck absolute denial think around 10% Americans infected. Latest estimates around Fuck. Yes. Well said. That's pretty much herd immunity right getting March supply arms April means herd immunity memorial day.

You can't say that. know herd immunity covid-sars2 is, Fauci estimates 70-85% could higher (e.g. measles around 90%). Obviously we're getting fairly quickly herd immunity hard magic number really means nothing many months worth data *after* full vaccination know actual herd immunity is, long lasts, degrees infection transmission within varying vaccines natural immunities amongst covid variants. yes, things change. article lowers bar ultra cold storage - requires special cold change management gonna see situation doses vaccines currently traceable vial suddenly allowed mixed stew intractability exposure multiple needles eek doses. poor countries, something &lt;&lt;1% IFR might blend background compared TB, malaria, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, dengue, etc., etc. People actually pay food drinks? Sure. wouldn’t suggest, compared likes super powers Europe, US held ensuring part population get sick properly cared able recover? cited sources know that. Shooting messengers satisfy confirmation bias? cite source proves vaccine makers claimed vaccine STOP transmission infection, please do. Thank you. America masks mandatory outdoors? mean that's nearly enough Australia, sayin... financial strain make people reluctant access healthcare though. lot people financially ruined bankrupted ER visit- around 66% bankruptcies caused medical reasons. deterrent seek medical help timely fashion- delay calling help late.

All wrote true, average US treated severe COVID patients surprisingly well considering unacceptable healthcare inequality. I'm struggling find study reported I'll update find it. First all,  B117 variant relatively new thing. November something.  pandemic going quite bit time bloody lockdown nearly 18 months. Bojo wants gyms shops open April. Yay. businesses went shit 18 months numbers Florida. Great success innit.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Thanks. Yeah someone else posted article last night course cant know sure sounds like exactly what's happening isn’t? That’s 90% restrictions actions taken about. UK talking “allowing” hug people may. hell call submission? fucking tragic. joke. probably moisture London? know live moist hell ive lived warmer/dryer climates dont get sick often. reference live Alaska live northernmost temperate rainforest North America get lot rain. sure average London. Never there. right. shows bit minimal effort mask wearing flu season could save even Talk Michael Osterholm Honestly, whole process made little emotional. unbelievably organized quick. much cooperation different groups roll out. nurses, police, national guard, don’t even know else. doesn’t take account developed vaccine made plans get done. 

Every detail thought executed. It’s pretty incredible. options, absolutely it’s good choice. However US getting good supply vaccines, able offer vaccines willing adults AZ widely available here. 

I say donate supply Europe. solves problem.... win win. appreciate thoughts. think answer view two budgets thing. I'd reducing budgets. says filed lawsuit allegding vaccination damage. Doesnt say Proven vaccine damage settlement. Lmao US needs catch one. rest developed world free healthcare Submit? Lol, height ridiculousness. jesus christ getting frustrating. i'm point hope speed even vaccinate everybody us like month fucking give us agreed read ""vaccine makers deliver X% less doses Q2"" news anymore eventually mutation produce extremely resilient variant strain it’s 2020 again.

Nobody simply wants accept anyone fully complied quarantine measures (california stay home place Jan half feb nobody following it. literally pointless measure). seeing normal coming place gradually. strictest states lifting restrictions pandemic retreat. good examples much money spent prevent deaths.  car tens billions safety related r&amp;d car $5k+ worth safety equipment including front airbags, side airbags, ABS brakes, traction control, crumple zones, pillar reinforcement, seat belts. may include collision avoidance systems, lane departure sensors, pre crash systems.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  thoughts: every adult wants vaccine chance get it, gradual easing restrictions one two month window (because vaccines require multiple doses vaccine takes several weeks become fully effective final shot).

After two month window over, almost restrictions go away.  Last time someone got paid out? Yes, fair [He's referring weeks receiving initial dose, Oxford jab appeared reduce person's risk hospital admission 94%. received Pfizer jab reduction risk 85% take guess, I'd say vaccine willingness highly correlated education levels. can't compare pure population density countries like though. Sweden big, people live specific cities, mostly south. Population-weighted density shows Sweden around density Netherlands Austria, reality, believe. Wish EU ordered Pfizer vaccins instead AZ. Unfortunately Poland it. Pfizer J&amp;J developed EU guess logic countries allowed get EU gets theirs? ignorance? personally I’ve looked numbers see virtually risk covid, fact I’ve already, would bother? Combat someone else, last thing need someone like attempting influence decisions give blame/credit specific policy decisions rhetoric. sure whether specific message policy helpful, compare developed countries. downplaying seriousness virus unhelpful. want give example something better developed countries did, can't think anything. That's pretty cynical way look it, cool. Enjoy privilege. live next playground Chicago, packed since June. can't stop laughing this. Thanks brightening morning, internet stranger 😀 Island nation, much different population distribution within country, different governmental structure makeup, different population demographics (more homogeneous lot countries), different culture... lot reasons lockdowns ""work"" one area unworkable impossible others. 

Somewhere around 55% Australian population lives 4 cities, 40% lives Sydney Melbourne. 33% New Zealand's population lives Auckland. That's completely different distribution of, say, United States. island part plays it, lot differences make Australia feasible (or possible) countries do. fact they've vaccinating people two months guidance place baffling. think greatly underestimating people fed home. know several fit described getting eff can, money spare not. going find way. 

Is going immediately snap back prepandemic levels? No. going rebound faster think? Yes. Sure, targeting HA site wouldn’t strategy flu, understanding could encode areas viral code mRNA elicits near effective immune response. Maybe it’d 95%, flu much lower R value ability digitally iterate eggs could net reduce flu transmission future. Yet, put Covid patients USS Comfort Javits center specifically st take overflow. think Warp Speed, covered fail We'll cool getting covid guess fine. 30 year old male here. hoard plastic bags..... see many people saying need end now, need clear metric get back normal. example, x percent vaccinated number cases means start opening up.  Ive left house twice past year urgent doctors Appts. order groceries sanatize mail. 

Its risky take less effective vaccine. I'd like go back real life eventually I'm going risk getting covid. Im high risk. I'm beyond words. know bad things happened around world peak pandemic among worst I've heard. scandal. people sacked, shamed prosecuted. actually really good questions there's usually stats section paper try review larger issues statistical significance sample size increases. Pfizer exporting vaccines UK US. confirmed. sort herd immunity would bring Covid deaths close zero? We'd probably need even more.  


But life return normal? vaccinate oldest at-risk Americans get number deaths hundred day falling. Heck, we're already 7-day average less 2000 we've vaccinated less 40 million. still useless curfew, gyms, sports, can't see friends work 100 different people everyday. Pathetic Utah. contracted third party company provide staffing, locations setup, supplies supply comes available shots go arms. coronavirus, fired. Lasted month me, 3 weeks gf, week brother. bad 5 months rare. university announced back in-person classes fall. happy thankful. First good news we've :) long term vs short term; short term bigger risk getting hit car, long term bigger risk getting exposed covid lungs/bodies still rapidly growing causing life long breathing complications, muscle pain, maybe even mental delays, would invisible late haven’t able smell since little I’ve fine, although fair it’s hard miss never had. want look eventually never felt like priority Nothing free know that. Hell post comment buy phone, pay monthly phone bill, pay electricity, pay wifi.  sure tours fake news since borders basically closed dual citizenship friends flew France Izrael get vaccine Moscow. Since former muscovites still friends, flats relatives Moscow easy spend 3 weeks Russia get shots.

Also second shot Sputnik half people know caused flu-like side effect, people describe like ""24 hours worst flu ever had"". First shot usually goes without side effects remember getting attacked going solo car trips, stops besides pay-at-pump gas, within 100 miles house...

Reason that, chance got car accident, could possibly expose police officer/paramedics COVID. really don’t think so, don’t know expect government point. little show “tougher” England many occasions. yes, always data collection evidence generation...

... say confidently friend group lost taste couple days. 

Can spot problem here? quote expert. journalism. well AA community rightfully scared especially US gov. done before. wonder what’s going south east asia flu originate every year? exposed, told get tested week later saturday, test came back negative tuesday. Wasnt around anyone else sinec exposure, wednesday morning got bad symptoms covid 4 days pretty rough.

Antibody test showed recently, yeah, dont trust tests unless active symptoms like... get tested DAY symptoms show up. I'd support people getting re-tested even get negative test mild symptoms days later assume vaccinated asked participate CDCs V-safe program. go link given provide cell number. text link every day week, weekly til month, every 2 weeks couple months. takes less minute answer questions. earlier surveys collecting data side effects such. later surveys asking questions I’ve gotten pregnant since vaccinated contracted coronavirus. haven’t either seems trying collect data. Who's talking imposing restrictive measures? read entire article Pagel don’t think damage done lockdown anything anyone would support prevent flu, bring question idea whether anything said hand sanitiser kept available shops transport hubs years come, argued “worth encouraging people wear masks” public transport busy environments winter months. 35 year old woman also does. 

Well I’ve stopped COVID may start again. irrational hatred toward landlords Reddit one favorite Reddit quirks guess month we’re appointments gonna high demand many getting them, we’re gonna get point “okay, drive CVS go get vaccine” we’ll good. I’m guessing vaccines open states mid-late April go there. covid-19 unique situation. think extrapolate data-point 1.
I'm even trying say likely, possible scenario. actually bothered reading article commenting, headline, know testing done analysing respiratory infections lab. can't confuse influenza virus Coronavirus. 

'Thousands swab samples processed analysed scientists Public Health England (PHE) weekly basis survey prevalence different respiratory diseases population.

But 685,243 samples reviewed PHE’s laboratories since first week January, single one tested positive influenza.' told wear two masks NYC... devil? journalism thanks - missed earlier. understanding - England seeing incredible results. ""The FDA given us positive feedback proposal, pursuing plan may allow 15 doses drawn vial,"" reads prepared testimony House Committee Energy Commerce. ""This allow us produce deliver doses quickly.” No. I'm sure drawing extensive biomed education saying things, right? Maybe mental weakness tied flippant disregard others? point COVID-19 death infection rate similar ""normal"" flu season. know metric ""Covid deaths close zero"", suppose depends close want get. vaccination susceptible (old folks people co-morbidities), see deaths people really unlucky (since vaccines flawless), refuse vaccination. 

It really fall cliff next two months. already unclear rates dropping fast everywhere - little vaccination effect yet, herd immunity unless undetected asymptomatic mild cases much prevalent. Maybe means it'll fall harder even sooner? scientifically factual correct result data inconclusive. End of.  It’s going balance though. follow purely logic, started diverting elsewhere soon finished nursing homes. Using purely “most needy recipient” approach would covid hell another 5 years.

It’ll probably mix, get country quasi stable deaths hospitalizations socially acceptable level things go back sort normal, start prioritizing elsewhere There’s certainly lag manufacturing completion, distribution states, vaccines arms. 200 million done May probably done since 254 million people get vaccinated would wager 75% would get vaccine. That’s 191 million would line get shot. I'm seeing R high COVID-19. keep finding reports say 2 - 2.5. rocket science it, cannot believe divisive point.

If sick, stay home, can’t stay home, minimize contact people much possible - distance mask.

It’s plain selfish.

People willing infect people aren’t willing wear mask know symptoms transmitted disease. almost masks social distancing... work? entirely possible lockdowns, even half-assed lockdowns like US (restaurants open half capacity, etc.) effective masking keeping seasonal flu bay. 

Japan South Korea [do seem higher flu US per capita, despite masking common behavior countries even Coronavirus. 

I'll freely admit though variables I'm equipped account for, like relative age differences population density. I'm pointing *possible* masks effective hope are. I'm still wearing mine. solution isolating older people would require government secure massive amounts subsidized housing, that’s we’d make possible isolate high risk people currently live people who, plan, would isolating.

It would expensive can’t implement instantly, would take months get set up. Yet published/reviewed lab analysis found California strain contagious, severe, moderately able escape vaccine, although less SA variant: anticipate time going effect vaccination,” Chiu said. Though magnitude effect varied sample sample less pronounced South Africa strain, “it still concerning,” said.

As always, findings evolve data becomes Marc Suchard, expert infectious disease tracking UCLA, said team’s findings would probably refined virus samples genetically sequenced data came light.

No need panic, accuse LA times prognosticating doom, burn effigies Fauci. run mill article variants. important concept- I’ll find report- past two years’ flu seasons relatively light terms mortality that... uh, died easy targets covid. possibility less susceptible people either Flu Covid fall certainly real- morbid reasoning is. Fear profitable It’s good cautious COVID, freaking getting something delivered going way far. Plus I’m pretty sure studies show Covid doesn’t spread much surfaces. Except people can't actually hold mountain biking situation. select lucky people get choice. people best get choose biking maybe 1/3 day instead entire day, still it. Using analogy. 

So really like would rather wear helmet that's less effective preventing concussion tomorrow, would like go without helmet months, taking chance serious head injury/death happen accident, getting far superior helmet wait. 

People work go school choice go back not, go they're told, lot people already there. take precautions own, like going shopping much all, going social gatherings, etc. still risk. even heard people literally never leaving house gathering non-residents getting it, probably someone delivered goods house (or germs something delivered, though that's less likely). understand argument they're making. like idea less effective vacccine either, situation they're saying makes sense. 

Especially since assume people offered something better later make everyone equal point. Even quite bit future. think crazy imagine would leave large portion population lesser protection, people taken care of, would make gaps improve everyone's immunity booster makes either one longer lasting. admit know facts subject particular, could wrong. That's makes sense you’re wiping ass nasty diarrhea dump, I’d expect common courtesy washing hands you’re spreading fecal matter everything touch afterwards. 

Plus, assuming public restroom, touch door handle get restroom, stall handle, stall lock, flush button/handle. 

Wash hands people. God wish

But forever. It'll end, since vaccinations ramping up, end near timeline COVID yours. sounds like may sense smell back do, close 100%.

What seems happening is, sense smell strong. smell basically everything, right face smell it. can't smell something cooking walk kitchen smell I'm directly pan. Careful things, especially alcohol.

You need follow dilution protocols. Cutting something already cut makes weak. I'm certain already people trying stretch 70% iso topping water. It’s also subreddit rules even mention explanation. fact, wouldn’t surprised comments get removed even hinting it. logic blaming ‘policy failures’ also myth reason. I'm frustrated can't even find single vaccine. infrastructure distribute failed miserably. I've checked local vaccination centers require appointments fill quickly almost impossible find opening. know anyone person successfully received first dose.  Look, know everyone impatient, calling rollout ""sluggish"" bit silly IMO. told last year would already administered 60 million doses vaccine 12 months novel virus first hit shores would told mind.  I've got plans dinner vaccinated parents Friday, plans visit state friend soon gets vaccinated, I've got plans local friends get ice cream walk bar next warm day have.

But I'm making plans international travel anything.  thousands thousands variants covid. viruses spread among millions people mutate. Some, like variant came mink farms, already believed extinct circulating among humans. surprising measures social distancing wearing masks reduce transmission diseases. world live in.

/s read monotone voice can. LOL good luck. could hope. That’s scientists said. want avoid catastrophe future, need take active role disease control countries. level cooperation respond CoViD-19 China, Italy, UK. news, there's new strain Ebola Africa. going ignore reaches US? mean, everyone staying home, would've actually stopped it. surprise, got support, infeasible (policy failure). Tubs easily recyclable. Wipes much. school pulls something like I’m transferring. Fuck that. sub brigaded anti-maskers like, mods don’t give hoot. (Watch, response be, ""If see posts like that, please report them."") read article? trade-off made, presenting false choice: keep things older people die. I'm saying I'm unwilling make bargain *again*, go path push politicians represent tailor policy people risk carry burden protecting time around... Especially since we've already demonstrated unevenness protocol put place already really care young working class. would bad policy again. stats posted refer US incorrect UK. realize UK focuses risk groups flu vaccine. I'm trouble even finding overall statistics. apparently different way think. 4 months accurate almost day. freaking hate wishful thinking handicapped us beginning. It’s published yet. Later week article indicated. suspect people still wearing them. Go it, darn face. Sure is, may take little longer(up months unfortunately), there's good chance get better, sure. ...who immense sympathy want support.

It's either/or. Well jabs annual...  stupid Fauci quotes far today that's good 70 million + 20 million J&amp;J next 5 weeks, 200 million easily done may want use Government forceably alter society whatever reason, would say use two words interchangeably warranted. case, Government driving force. 

If we're government see people complaining people things within law like going bars wearing masks allowed to. pretty much impossibly go ""ethical"" companies nowadays. feel like people verbal avoiding companies ethical reasons ones usually enabling companies one way another go ""popular"" company boycott current time.   repeating things over? already aware this. Don’t things scare us with? Plus natural immune response fade.

And that's moment realized idea talking someone explain need multiple vaccines? take one vaccine - Moderna’s, example - every vaccine manufacturer crank out? People take lack evidence pack possibility, that's science works. Plus 20 million doses (single shot) Johnson Johnson coming March.  Fellow rap fanatics, anyone else live Eminem concert life bucket list? really hope possible sooner people think. man pushing 50. got HFM literally catching nieces puke hands. I’m guessing got daycare husband got too. Never felt sick life. R0 flu like barely 1...

The R0 covid like what? 3? 4? new variants??? That’s happens take away profit motive Yeah. would love continued drop like rock people getting hopes “COVID disappear April!” that’s extremely wishful thinking. might part it, simple, soon area becomes desirable, bunch hawks swoop capitalize this. It’s bot renters fighting renters units. It’s huge corporations, developers etc make impossible actual people compete. doubt able get access vaccine earlier date due change federal leadership. you’ve demonstrated, people quick assume accuse

I'm waiting. (sorry) glad it’s somebody else gets it! Nobody else know sense smell gone long, it’s hard explain people also haven’t either. doesn’t make ton sense would happen either. think Pfizer EU deal big enough 300m

The initial orders 

- 400 million AZ

- 300 million GSK/Sanofi

- 400 million Janssen

- 100 million Biontech/Pfizer

Only GSK/Sanofi failure problems AZ became clear, EU order Biontech/Pfizer Curevac.

There enough vaccine orders compensate one failure, two top suppliers problems, vaccination schedule put disarray. 

The EU trusted AZ respect contract. EU put place auditors monitoring production procurement AZ facilities signing contract. think depends numbers say. 

If spreading fast, I'm going take precautions limit spread. spread slowed decreasing, feel need.

I idea get access vaccine condition world point. Bruh, contextual mistake early pandemic corrected million times since. Dude impeccable service record past republican democrat administratioms multiple pandemics, studied decade gain bank knowledge. 

But sure, windmill cancer ex-potus random radiologist answers

You guys would hilarious werent busy crying piece cloth face Denmark still forecasting June 18 last second jab, asuming 90% says yes shot. Last update plan friday feb 19 (where also said less AZ, Biontech) tribe already destined extinction lack genetic diversity small group. Holy shit they’ve really picked 2nd dose vaccinations. remember seeing 2m long ago. Calm everyone, Q3 get enough vaccines. That's around corner! J&amp;J vaccines made Europe, there's also new partnership USA idea making anything moment. basing on, exactly?

The fact sole supplier US blocked exports executive order, think face ramifications?

They take countries money first though, they? current data suggests still spread virus even vaccine.

So wrong facebook post? correct. Lori knows another summer without activities tourists devastating Chicago. already thin ice Chicagoans is. imagine Wrigley Field pretty full July 4th. agree, loved morning afternoon commutes even stuck traffic, it’s time jam music listen podcasts like said, it’s really weird transition work home First time life walk clinic doctor bother offering me. hope Curevac good get production up. would big EU. [Why Can’t Make Vaccine Doses often question administration can’t use mighty Defense Production Act — empowers government demand critical supplies anyone else — turbocharge production. law limits. . . .  like making shoes,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said interview ProPublica. “And reason use somewhat tongue-in-cheek analogy people say, ‘Ah, know do? get DPA build another factory week start making mRNA.’ Well, time new factory get geared make mRNA vaccine exactly according very, strict guidelines requirements FDA ... already hands 600 million doses Moderna Pfizer contracted for. would almost late.” everybody wants vaccinated vaccinated, guys think still wear masks? 

Hard [So transcript say identical quote different interview?

Or enjoy making shit up? [Except follows, big numbers scary narratives get clicks. index what? using evidence satisfactory? trouble looking citations Wikipedia? Sputnik V Sinovac gaining ground. Seriously? Reality masks undoubtedly would've reduced flu cases. logic pretty straightforward. think completely disappeared it, unreal.

Mask wearing thing did. US executive order bans vaccine exports. Oh wow! One kids - went change diaper blisters. got hands mouth overall fine thankfully catch it.

Got chicken pox 33 though. :| Thank god antivirals. I'll never make fun Valtrex commercials again, stuff saved ass. schools? offshoring teaching jobs mass.  Obviously capacity right now.

What basing on, exactly? Blocking exports vaccines countries ordered paid advance goes beyond 'political' backlash real ramifications manufacturers place bases future.

The US blocked exports executive order, think face ramifications? think EU, largest free market world, face greater ramifications? meant 100% world ate healthy. everyone eating broccoli daily, cost? happens 0% corn consumption? We'll oral direct acting antivirals coronaviruses soon. Sooooo testing one percent population good data yea?

Edit people didn’t read article: 

But 685,243 samples reviewed PHE’s laboratories since first week January, single one tested positive influenza.  Nearly half country! LA Times story California variant almost seems like parody pandemic coverage last two months. Like variant circulating since middle 2020, maybe might something LA county one severe outbreaks world November January? Wearing mask pretty minimal effort may true, us probably remember last Jan/Feb... really connection societal value vaccinations fucked part. 

I think problem per se saying xx group people contribute society yy group. go college mean better person someone deserve special legal treatment. It’s especially gross really reason smoke anymore. vape products deliver much nicotine entire cigarette one puff flavor choice. vaped years quitting oral tobacco shit objectively better every single way. Smoking actual cigarettes archaic disgusting. comment linking childrenshealthdefense.org automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* person needs two shots. Except limited amount JJ vaccine probably come out. really *really* hope world continues hygiene conscious  Think canaries *their* coal mine. true literally every virus? Yeah, sometimes get scary.  NY repeatedly said give us shots, upscale get arms. think lot states position. School based sporting events carrying normal here, professional/semi-professional also going (but can't attend games running). sporting activates adults allowed, two people indoors four people outdoors.

That said 100% sure ""normal person"" sports rules followed seeing bowling alleys, tennis courts everything around still open running. get both. pay Medicare. AFAIK, pay Medicaid. Possible, extremely unlikely, viral load would small Sure, mild you. That's great. know none friends family got you? people interact with? Sounds familiar... know get pick choose I've heard. None said true.   everyone I'm going around vaccinated. example, husband fully vaccinated. parents help care dad. protected, careful see, anyone. protected, I'm unvaccinated taking risks point. depends rules place. Since got vaccine indoor dining quite bit. Maybe good doctor go restaurant see “society” doesn’t care anymore. aware Macron got involved. Care explain? skimmed peoples money business I'd prison long time.

If government I'd re-elected. almost people want pandemic end...

And really, several weeks form new habits stick. 10 months leaving house, people might want leave house...   great! see 10 articles screaming third wave coming watch. Hmm USA UK export bans vaccines, know vaccine products would flow easily.  Yeah that's exactly thinking, puts perspective ridiculously contagious Rona looking comments ppl sick, meanwhile I've ill twice last year. times rly bad cough point throwing up. Second time sent home testing came back negative covid. I've wearing mask continuously (work retail to) I'm unlucky lol Except South Africa... scientists doctors _stopped_ using AZ's vaccine work all. SA variants globe... 500,000

That verified deaths. Total covid deaths likely bit that. every death happened hospital covid test. Asymptotic people died strokes home due clotting covid does. case numbers hot mess despite really good vaccination numbers hard hard lockdowns.

It kind proves lockdowns really work well certain point.  mean you’re kind proving point. Uruguay Chile exceptions, whereas many Latin American countries located bottom half list. said tend corrupt, data provided literally supports assertion. kind crazy. Like take covid seriously, seems like lot overreactions.

Like Yes covid likely around form. going totally go away. strains flu. neighbor auto work, I've legit never seen ever wear mask. live boats literally can't socially distance, he's parties next door 5 friends maskless. hard time cordial him, he's vaccinated worry much. [Nations received COVID-19 vaccines produced EU since Jan. 30 are: Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Panama, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom United  used feel guilty skipping work cold. felt like letting people coming in. Lessons learned past year indicate nope, nobody else needs catch colds. That’s great, vaccines together get us there. Pfizer, AZ, Moderna, J&amp;J, Sputnik, Novavax, Sinovac, etc.

You idea you’re talking about. Vector vaccines cheap, made anywhere. mRNA cutting edge, future going forward, suitable cover demand right now. superbly effective preventing disease. decades colonialism Europe graciously allow Africa vaccinated first Username absolutely check out. That's rest us. Welcome real world. born Diafragmatic hernia, Im phase 1B vaccine? Yup. 

Shame one party decided capitalize people's selfishness politicize whole thing. we'll never able actually get decent cultural acceptance mask wearing like see various Asian countries. even part country better mask wearing, distancing, going sick, etc... it'll still help lot. Restrictions/masks/distancing isn’t thing play here. Viral interference also plays pretty big part flu suppression. age. Easiest enforce, realistically equatable effective. Thank you, reasonable person. makes lot sense people might great getting back follow ups, people lower risk, people trust existing technology more, people prefer convenience aspect, without easy major hubs freezers needed store mRNA. 

And like it'll leave totally exposed COVID illness, quite effective. know what’s even sadder 86/90 year old man dying COVID? “...he six Jumas survived massacre ordered traders interested rubber chestnuts land, according detailed information Social-Environmental Institute every one hundreds ethnic groups Brazil. Hunted wild animals, around 60 indigenous peoples killed. last mass-extermination attempt suffered tribe, described chroniclers cannibals, perverse ferocious.”
People real disease  Ha, do, usually rainy day endeavor us. winters mild. I’m organization that’s still conducting virtual meetings members (who risk groups) feel comfortable waiting vaccines available. friend president says “it’s understandable!” we’ve gone waiting March waiting weather gets warmer get back person. PA going fairly slow vaccines unless things ramp up, imagine we’ll waiting again. 

I think it’s one wants come “understanding” “kind,” plus society seems hell bent “fair” “inclusive” everyone. seems like can’t go back someone always upset politicians inclined listen people don’t feel “included.” accommodating means can’t go back person. It’s time  Doesn’t Covid-19 also aerosolize, it’s less dangerous due smaller viral load compared droplets main vector? couple weeks ago. Never even suspected full week passed mild. realize it, quietly stayed home last couple days. one caught me. one must know happened, would cause gigantic issue. Oswald ends wald. I'd passed vaccine reading this... thanks adding fuel fire lol. saying landlords able evict tenants lockdown? able evict exactly causing go bankrupt. made exempt lawsuits year still everyone 16 need it. 

Then consideration anti-vaxxers combined bleed countries access vaccine - possibility vaccine resistant mutation coming out.

Even get 90% vaccination rates, need sustained measures slow spread well 2022. Hopefully things normal, plan taking mask grocery store eating long while.

For record, I'm fully vaccinated (both doses + waiting period passed) still avoid close people double mask high risk areas kylorrenmore.gif Even places didn’t close reduction cases due near halting international travel. seasonal flu follows pretty predictable path South East Asia, Austrailia/NZ, North America, Europe, finally spreading South America Africa.

Several links barely open, would expect flu bottled moment. US yet use data govt. may like to, I'm sharing forecast likely happen. sound like clear sociopathic tendencies. Flu probably mostly spreads presymptomaticly well. doubt happen. absolutely doubt that. look anatomy skull there’s way PCR test would get brain. That’s what’s there. words smell someone's fart could infected measles. says can’t question them? That’s lawsuits wild, Japan paying 400,000 family family member die vaccine Excellent point. well received here. NY NJ smaller wave winter compared initial spring 2020 surge, whereas country winter largest wave. high peak come from. Nonetheless they'll continue drop gets warmer people vaccinated. know species thought humans. makes sense thanks. seen 99% efficacy two dose regimen? started study, see results yet. Damn ok thanks. Assuming 26% people infected, estimate saying 26% people vaccinated also infected. 13% people vaccinated. 26% 13 around 3.

It’s perfect it’s estimate. Agreed. fear people get it, especially poorer countries around world (7.6b ppl need get basically), virus mutates we're again. Yep proving point even more, fact think it’s ok normal pay money us able question anything insane expensive healthcare world finally paying off! That’s good. Many flu hospitalizations deaths avoided year, would problematic past months. I’ve PCR test 8 times since June, pleasant certainly don’t “get used it,” rest assured lot easier you’re expecting. didn’t want essentially neurologically molested, easier that. It’s uncomfortable, means painful. almost obvious limits well capitalism organise resources! Unless short lockdown seal borders tightly shut vaccination went long way, achieve nothing. eastern european countries strict anti covid response firat wave. delayed inevitable. proven less effective. That's false narrative. know would better went got less effective vaccine *gasp* life health matter too. Shocking, know. think people stay away masks outside assume mask wearer much covid cautious are, mask wearer covid. fair assumption, imo. Even Canada thought planned getting everyone vaccinated end summer. France ""fragile"" people (that's medically defined category) I'd really like see data this. Anyone? I'm pointing article ""an end measure transmissibility."" 

I linked article learn concept R0. seem laboring impression infectious diseases comes transmissibility.

They're not. True, never take antibodies test/covid test. counter-point though, none 5 people hang symptoms, well one contact work, may additional 5 people. least numbers game, find hard believe 0/10 people could possibly given/gotten Covid asymptotic. Anti Gen test lot less invasive PCR test? concerned brain jabbed, lol. Could lead particularly bad flu season next winter? mean since people caught long time, immunity level population might wane. I'm speculating though. shit ridiculed. Different treatments, ventilators, even nursing home stuff, awful hindsight time could justified. screaming TV help everyone part good probably kick pants people needed. 

But man, writing book response response still ongoing. Horrible. trick never know safe. Assuming vaccines work promise to, promise 100% safety. there's 5% chance still get infected, make safe, unsafe? Wanna bet ""by late April basically open season""?

It lol think that's did? I'm curious came conclusion. Right. everyone wants everyone else get less effective vaccine. cares health safety worry about. 

If get J&amp;J astra vaccine need wait years go back normal life. 

Or could wait get effective vaccine. safe possible. really brainer. 

Do want protect elite want protect yourself. Soap needs minutes kill it, least lab liquid. data liquid, importantly, dried saliva.

So soap removing. Unfortunately, data well removes dried contaminated saliva hands various types food. Also, data expected amounts hands food. talked experts, guess would thorough slow hand scrubbing enough. No. seems actually less durable air form droplet nuclei corona viruses measured goldberg drum. 

Measles 3x infectious sars2 unclear derive superspread events may outliers. also messes immune system infectious much longer period sars2 milder symptoms. long low symptom shed probably measles spreads high R0. Sounds like people making shitty ass lockdowns potentially inspiring friends try same. sure seem bitter...? NPR released good one days ago:
 Same. fingers crossed! Don’t promote false narrative. vaccines work well case there’s always big component community obligation vaccination. US entire world massive border restrictions.
Influenza follows highly seasonal pattern.

Severe restrictions movement broke chain.

Sweden Norway schools open year essentially zero mask usage....influenza entirely disappeared too.

So masks schools closed. actually bothered reading article commenting, headline, know testing done analysing respiratory infections lab. can't confuse influenza virus Coronavirus. 

'Thousands swab samples processed analysed scientists Public Health England (PHE) weekly basis survey prevalence different respiratory diseases population.

But 685,243 samples reviewed PHE’s laboratories since first week January, single one tested positive influenza.' trust company knowingly sold talcum powder cause several cancers did, unfortunately public health messaging absolutely abyssmal. messaging cleaning surfaces early on, never corrected, still lot people believe protect COVID using lot hand sanitzer excessively wiping surfaces. 

It speaks larger problem messaging public health authorities never talk risk relatively risky things are, advise maximum precautions anything could threat. know impossible COVID spread surfaces, advise people focus away towards mitigating risk person-to-person transmission. don’t see denying Interesting Misinformation misinformation. speaking absolutes known mislead people. objective. anything like said. Nowhere comment mine mention social distancing hand washing mask wearing.  friend works JJ said would rolling day approved. said expected approved end week early next week! hope right! agreement EU AZ signed 26th august agreement UK AZ signed 28th august 2020

The UK moved quicker right? memory really short?

The USS comfort originally set treat non-coronavirus patients later changed treat coronavirus patients deemed would useful

 [USNS Comfort Approved Take COVID-19 Patients Crew Member Tests Positive – NBC New 

Also ship ended treating 182 coronavirus patients departing (sure lot something) FEMA field hospitals set treated least 1,100 patients time article

 [USS Comfort Leaves NYC, Coronavirus Patients Discharged would prefer j&amp;j. Like said. One shot drs office. Technology tested 100% effective hospital death. would MERS comparable? said ""the endemic coronaviruses"". MERS endemic coronavirus. dont belive ""if get covid"" long term effects. brothers, friends age months ago fine. Literally issues 

The whole ""You might get long term effects"" way pushing masses get vaccine, part that. risk, healthy Please let true please let true. think placing detriments COVID vs. response COVID opposition one another large reason still mess. 

It forces conversation “which one better”, rather “how better”. Great! Label whatever want. I’m tired arguing damn vaccine. merely passing french health offiials saying.

To really game trust. trust everyone social bubble continue barrier measures outsiders enough let guard down? 

If (no trust, willing social distance etc), willing vector transmission another person vaccinated puttin ghis life social bubble's lives risk? town, seems like people make bigger effort stay away see wearing mask outdoors. seems like think mask wearing outside must mean person Covid.   You’re missing OPs point Pfizer production *in* U.S. well. saying aren’t receiving doses produced elsewhere well, OPs point thought doses coming local production. Oh yes, vast border closures America. Imagine seeing world lens fairy tale lasers.  placebo effect proven strong. really believed gin-raisins would help, probably did, bit. I'm skeptic, help all. tweet reads Scott Adams never flu. get flu healthy young person absolutely understand could easily kill old frail people. Maybe?

Like many people, nasty bug December 2019 tested negative flu. never got tested antibodies anything."
