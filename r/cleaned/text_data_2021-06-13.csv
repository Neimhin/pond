0,2021-06-13," hell what's happening India Trump's fault? Here's answer brand new Monday morning figures boosting .4%. I've heard, weak evidence slightly worse Alpha variant, original. However, young and/or vaccinated, vastly mitigates symptoms. UK fatality rate dropped 1,200/day 10/day, seems staying low despite infection rates increasing. Hospitalisations gone up, people staying long. We've successfully protected older vulnerable population.   look deliveries bottom page:

""Vaccines | Coronavirus Dashboard | Government.nl"" seems like AstraZeneca definitely deliver enough comparing 12 weeks ago. enough second doses seems. Probably Dutch fond tested. around half population say willing get tested COVID-19 like symptoms according RIVM polls. 1. Data comes GGD. Self tests, rapid tests entrance proof, tests done institutions (like hospitals) tests done private streets/settings included.
2. People must symptoms (the list pretty broad) direct positive contact tested GGD.
3. People make appointment first.
4. Low demand testing compared peak due lower incidence symptomatic people (at peak average around 80,000 tests per day).
5. Overall willingness get tested people symptoms low here, around 50%.

The accessibility really problem. test streets place. Waiting times also problem, average takes day looking appointment getting result PCR test. testing capacity also problem, well beyond 100,000 tests per day testing street.

But indeed, comparing data always difficult countries. different way counting, cultures ways things. example people hospital ICU always seem much higher Belgium compared Netherlands reason taking account difference case load population. Wait 70% ot 85% group still (reduced) chance getting infected?  think lot people Brussels choosing get vaccinated. I’m 30 year old living Brussels. Last week current 30 year olds could subscribe waiting list last minute available doses (due people received actual vaccination invitation cancelling etc). days later got call already asking could drop by. went smoothly. Meanwhile, friends live Flanders lists weeks months.  oh true Yes, way Japan done vaccinating large part adult population year, unless uptake low.

The argument 65+ done maybe next year anti-olympics propaganda. Correct I'm wrong rapid step culture tests subsequent longer tests pretty definitive? docs diagnose step without now? kid always getting swabbed that. That's meant dumb. disrespectful way. Like layman. mathematically pretty normal. Adding together five 1-20 distributions get even 5-100 distribution. It'll like binomial distribution, enough die probably turn normal distribution.

As simple example, chance rolling 100 1/20^5 = 1 3 million. they'd give extra 6 months notice probably lost twice many people mistake though? care deaths cases. Despite rise, deaths UK still low wait bit longer will. I'm fine thank asking. UK 44.6% fully vacinated. US 43.6% fully vaccinated. UK 106.8 doses per 100 people, US 92.9 doses per 100 people.

The UK vaccinating age uptake 93%+ 50s. Yeaahhhh, I’ll still keeping mask knowing this... Germany Delta weeks, it’s growing nearly fast UK. fact, cases delta it’s percentage overall cases _shrinking_
Same Denmark. I‘m really gonna hold breath delta. see UK might specific them. problem. guy innocent, never said was, right court determine without risking extra 10 years prison. might innocent, next person might be. Sounds like got deserved, problem justice system behaved, effects next person.

We torture confessions people know guilty, wrong, sometimes wrong guilty. found police electrocuting genitals child rapist, I'd problem, child rapist deserves better, deserve better living society police electrocute peoples genitals. 

He go prison assaulting people scumbag, asking government prove trial. He's guilty, rightfully found guilty, state telling anyone admit guilt risk spending 10 years prison wrong, wrong matter accused did. bad enough warrant sentence got, never willing let easy.  government source told Sky News prime minister dash hopes Freedom Day come one week's time, 21 June, instead postponed 19 July.

""It one last heave,"" senior source quoted saying prime minister met senior cabinet ministers scientific advisers. ""It straight race vaccine virus."" Huh? mostly put through. Actually US shitty president might benefit rest world. Also, like, bad infections take half year completely recover from. 
Its pointless extrapolate forever nobody virus 18 months. can't change much else longer latch onto cells- cells. trying thread careful needle.

I've saying months, usually get downvoted people understand viruses well.

The danger virus mutating way lets completely evade vaccines basically non-starter, since way make unable infect humans time.

We absolutely hit park vaccines.  sad money gets way easy decision. Yeah costs flying economy. quite success too. complete nonsense. healthiest person know (triathalon athlete) suffering fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, rashes oxygen sats randomly dip 90% SIX MONTHS testing positive COVID. exactly that. taking account efficacy vaccines/natural infection? Yeah, allergies, chronic sinus issues chronic gastro-intestinal issues. day goes ever least one ""Covid symptom"".  Glad got figured thanks rambling lecture. Mutations flaw process, process part dynamic system. system without wouldn’t exist. fact DNA respond stressful stimulation increasing rate mutation. outdated mental model is. 

As term purpose vs effect - overly pedantic nonsense part. point effectively purpose, it’s directed.

Your watchmaker analogy-Despite doubling saying authoritative condescending manner doesn’t make accurate. 

Have good day ""lockdown""? lockdown? amount actually still restricted moment hardly anything. current regulations can't sensibly described ""lockdown"".

(Note OP: realise press misusing term, choice wording) guess vaccines distributed, recipient countries whether use not. AstraZeneca vaccine still widely used around world general guess safe use pose threat (or, least, less threat Coronavirus). two brands, can't really say. Yes government could done prevent importing cases. government regulation necessary public could trusted act responsibly realise activities irresponsible selfish even they're allowed. Yeah think unvaccinated 6 month olds America. cite source? I’ve heard never seen anyone actually post regulation.

I wonder that’s really shorthand one knows one wants test court (till now). Unfortunately incorrect. UK currently roughly 79% (1 dose) 57% (2 doses) adult population. US not. even close. yesterday UK somewhere neighborhood 80% adults fully vaccinated. 

No, US UK % fully vaccinated population, US slightly younger still adults fully vaccinated. Sagies want years social distancing masks. huge realization masks spring. Normally spring comes grass tree pollen month can’t go outside without delayed sneeze attack lasts roughly long I’m outside.

Wish could add /s I'm US, lockdown order there, I'd disobey it. I've complying (and stil comply, still here) covid measures. However, move finger protect people want protect first place. escape. Objectively, does. point percentage, stay vaccine 100% effective start, understand implying linking article. ""Four weeks""

Lol. Two two weeks. opinion, people took care would recover. want get Covid period, would different variant. pace think people willing take here. Hence age breakdown registration hard actually: multiply R proportion susceptible people. stop virus R=3.25 need 70% vaccination + infection rate. R=5.82 need 85%, hope R actually high. Pretty neat see potential self driving cars realized avoid spreading covid-19.

It take get used see cars driving without driver makes sense.

As cop VP racist crime bill joe isn't, would never point one particular person say sure lack reaction. point group 50 people without reactions say likely it. 4 10 June, average 882 new coronavirus infections detected per day, 40% previous week, according latest figures published Monday morning Sciensano public health institute.

An average 40,900 tests also carried daily, positivity rate 2.7%.

Hospitalisations coronavirus sit 702 people, 274 patients treated intensive care.

The average number hospital admissions per day due coronavirus 7 13 June fell 49.3, 31% decrease compared previous reporting period.

Between 4 10 June, average 8.6 people died per day result virus, bringing total 25,088 deaths since start pandemic Belgium.

The incidence, indicates average number new cases per day per 100,000 inhabitants, reached 143.6 14 days. reproduction rate virus still falling 0.76. 1, indicator means epidemic tending slow down.

Since start pandemic Belgium, 1,076,338 Covid-19 infections diagnosed.

The Brussels Times  Exponential growth two weeks. going talk politics. support measure mean support government.

I agree, however statement trust Government ""will hanging thread"" strongly implies people reacted negatively delay, supported recent polling.  Common sense went way ""the South rise again"" ""the war slavery"" became popular chants among almost half Americans, even northern states. people truly believe main people least likely ignore science take vaccine. US not. even close. yesterday UK somewhere neighborhood 80% adults **fully** vaccinated. US even remotely anywhere near number. We're low 50% right now. I'm hearing John Madden play play 'Fantastic Voyage' evolution. Pat!, look spiky guy is!! Hey that?  gotta careful pop ball!   hit's kick pretty darned good, look genetic drift left,....aaaand DOINK!  gonna hear Coach Darwin tomorrow practice!  Exactly. coworkers idiots. yet come work, unmasked (because work ask vaccine passports instead relies ""blind faith"" ""trust"" fully vaccinated sole people unmasked), say get ""it *really* tested"" ""vaccine lotteries"" ""vaccine discounts"" making *more* skeptical, *less*, like said. better familiarize bankruptcy papers guess 99% covid hospitalizations Indiana unvaccinated  great time 30% vaccinated... Supply issue UK. We'd love blow everyone else quite enough vaccine that. Reports Wales managed much faster vague inconsistent. England says able use second dose buffer quickly worry running due centralized UK wide supply. Wales says managed stockpile better. one actually seems able tell us what's going on. Thank sourcing facts logic behind lockdown people already don’t trust government doesn’t make sense. won’t take vaccine won’t listen lockdown measures. point nothing do... variants would come would wait infinite time variants keep coming third world countries vaccine patent waived Still Taiwan low numbers new cases deaths.

Only 185 new cases today 15 dead.

And total 12,921 cases 437 dead total.

Those low numbers compared country. going talk politics. support measure mean support government.

Like support lockdown lot mean think government done good job. How? 


The Vaccine response US's SERIOUS hit Covid. amount funding received (operation WARP speed) part this. 


If take everyone vaccine producers... vaccine ready yet.  


What reductionist. stands, US NET positive space vaccines, negative. annoyance stems tech, money resources make vaccines distributing them... think America baddy. without US would vaccine scarcity..... objectively. disputable fact. *some* people, like friend's brother. people, like decent amount *still unvaccinated* coworkers, stuff made *more* skeptical, *more* unlikely take vaccine. There's convincing people. 5 years distant memory Emergent qualities tend noticed good, bad. Successful mediocrity however still runs potential exponential feedback small gains unnoticed denial impossible. crazy? expect people wear chin diapers mouth nose? That's disgusting. allowed take test symptoms contact positive self-test.

But pretty much everywhere, no? report symptoms, test you, positive, test people contact with. I’m sorry hear that, hope recovers soon. odds favour age I’m sure fine.  say next im wondering is, new variant really cause problem, long BioNTech vaccine producer change formula? heard said someting like 6 weeks, im expecting something like 6 months concept, production finally shipping said valued customer. send hate mail. rather brutal month. Every day someone personally knew seemed infected, many cases hospitalised. best friend’s dad died hospital battling life 10 days. mom hospitalised too, recovered well. one shook most, however, person used greet morning dog walks, 30-something pilot, athletic fit, contracted virus passed away 3-4 days. couldn’t believe wife told happened.

Things much better now, least (Mumbai). don’t hear cases anymore. Vaccinations going decent pace, could quicker. ""already 2021"" gives exactly information. No, didn't. addressed debunked ""source"" was, admission, opinion piece.

There distinction EUA approved vaccine fully approved vaccine employment law standpoint. Federal law prevents government mandating non-fully approved vaccines prevent private employers so. tldr article millions people getting vaxxed expected hundreds thousands side effects would reported. matter look mass vaccination clearly lead unwanted side effects, controversial accept? “One last heave”…until next one. - 100% cut dry. case law exists. law exists. EEOC guidance exists. cut dry. 

The distinction made law EUA approved vaccine vs fully approved vaccine GOVERNMENT cannot mandate vaccine full approval. law prevent private employers so. Plus, going 100% moot point almost certainty Pfizer Moderna full FDA end year.

I appreciate moving goal posts though previously stated reasonable accommodations must given blanket statement trying harp approval status vaccine already addressed above. I'd seriously look passport route think that's works. I'm sure perhaps father may able claim citizenship her, sure able him. 

I claimed Portuguese citizenship parents although born US. Claiming citizenship someone claimed grandmother (your great-grandmother) stretch. likely, father would Irish citizen time birth, registered Irish Foreign Births Register. That's almost case EU country. 

I'm Irish citizenship expert, I'd reach local Irish embassy get info. like said, laws change time. follow question answered article unvaccinated are, answer disproportionately white boomers Ehh mostly bring upon myself. keto month awhile back almost diarrhea. would also call Bundeskanzlerin, even though that's title German. treating Irish word differently, Ireland mainly English speaking. Surprisingly unsurprising.... question,

What happens Covid continues mutate? inject new mRNA vaccine like yearly flu shots? Really interesting see this. OP Hungarians, reliability biasness paper?

This less line trial outcomes real world data, seems. two mRNA vaccines producing highest antibodies, adenovirus vaccines next, inactivated vaccines. Also shows UAE Bahrain requiring third booster shots people using Sinopharm six months ago.  delta strain coming honestly seems reasonable. guess see US vs UK terms hospitalization amongst unvaxxed.  really good points upvote. people might really hard time eradicating virus body (possibly hides immune privileged sites like ebola does?) causes inflammatory syndromes. massive boosting vaccine induced immunity might finally tip scale finally get rid virus unvaccinated. would advocate another 2 week lockdown US curb it. shit joke.

Yeah, that’s happening. whole country decided shut again, especially vaccine rates actually extremely good states... would probably riots protests ass.

Honestly, US better riding point. Everyone know got too. family friends, primarily last holiday season (November December). symptoms also started like cold (runny nose, etc), definitely easy confuse cold sinus infection “gotta covid” symptoms set (loss taste smell, burning nose, brain fog, etc) That's dice work. Rolling 5 20 sided dice rolling 1 100 sided dice. issue untested Supreme Court all. fact, case law goes heavily towards mandates enforceable.

In Jacobson v Massachusetts, SCOTUS upheld authority states enforce compulsory vaccine laws.

There also multiple cases (although none granted certiorari) supporting flu shot vaccine mandates employers supporting vaccine mandates industries schools. course subject compliance ADA Civil Rights Act 1964 - - protected law get ""reasonable accommodation"" simply wanting vaccine unless protected reason so. [Our World claims 1.3%. Fully vaxxed symptoms well. also time last year,.but smoke due fires.

Maybe pick rapid test. However, would never call Angela Merkel ""Prime Minister Germany"" even though essentially is. guess countries prestigious others get keep titles, others subservient ignorance general population. sputnik bad, regular russian people supposed do? ask born here, choice, government gave us opportunities well, i'm curious would situation. think vaccinated perfectly fine legitimate reason. mention mask wearing first thing dealt pandemic people misunderstood ADA meant, it’s happening vaccines. 

The ADA opt don’t like it, it’s opt people serious medical conditions. people try claim “ADA opt out” legitimately meet criteria, exceptions made. guarantee it. people instead lose jobs won’t feel bad decision get vaccine literally hundreds millions people gotten already deny legitimacy one study one clinic. headline George bush mission accomplished level message, however, absurd taken truth based one study. People would also gather crowds places worship pray away. Which, ironically opposite effect. Article nice American US truly horrible hellscape

Never change reddit Let’s play out. social meets, someone tells weird conspiracy theory wrong facts, would do? Would you

Employee 1: Anti-vaxxer medical issues. Refuses get vaccine. 

Employee 2: autoimmune disease bad reactions vaccines past. Refuses get vaccine.

Far spread occurs personal gatherings public transit. even read comments? talking obtaining FDA approval needed US.

The stupidity reddit seems derail constructive discussion. U.S. states COVID rising? (The article behind paywall idea they're talking U.S. states countries).

I live one least vaccinated states, we've gone peak 1,654 7-day average new cases 94 currently.  course, still lot people vaccinated despite near bottom relative U.S. states. still acceptable leave 15% math get 20% much easier. difference usually like one two dollars, one really cares enough whip calculator app. Yeah apparently India Korea producing  Phase 3 trials conducted UK accepted FDA approval.

There production capacity available. Making Novavax sooner would reduce volume previously approved vaccines.   Good. Like, course, good behave like expected to. must’ve missed part said “as long benefits outweigh risks kids.” It’s tricky it’s first thing said short post.

We certainly believe getting recipient vaccinated better recipient getting vaccinated, would unethical approve vaccine group. I’m sorry go though I’m sure leave deep scars time come, vaccine rollout slowed peak seeing rise uk I’d interested know slowed  knew tiny amounts that's works. starts small grows. bit research confirms it. 77 cases detected [15th time [900 people day arriving India, 6% testing That's 54 new cases day. big influx. 

I agree 9th April likely late keep Delta country. However, putting India red list could reduced number cases factor 10. 9-day doubling period, would given us extra 4 weeks. coincidence long lockdown extended for. would likely extend lockdown India added red list time Pakistan Bangladesh. downvoting completely correct. trials 30,000 people around 100 days. Taking average 1500 deaths per million since start pandemic (most developed countries 1000-2000 deaths per million), then, taking extremely crude average, would expect 320 deaths per million 100-day span. So, 15,000 placebo group, would expect around 4 deaths. trials, number even lower, expected number dying would lower.

If, vaccinated group get 0 deaths, placebo, get 3, conclude 100% protection death, bad statistics. 

That said, saying effective. Real world data larger sample size shown us 95% effective hospitalization. Every 60 seconds, minute passes Ahh it’ll fine Yeah that's I'm bit scared of. government paying get vaccinated lot antivaxxers think they're trying put chip even more...  ex friend rabid anti vaxxer said would rather die take Covid vaccine. people unmoored reality. nice!! didn’t come 4 years validation conspiracy theories fomenting distrust media expertise wouldn’t here

However, makes work others? patients meds medical conditions affect vaccine's ability protect? patients older affects vaccine protection? mild, symptoms, serious symptoms? would like know details. J&amp;J one traditional though. even trust Pfizer Moderna, J&amp;J solution them. course care, they're going continue rhetoric.

No way would see taking vaccine optional prevent infection “that’s nature.” Single-dose may optimal Delta, lot effective earlier variants UK least vulnerable groups already fully vaccinated (unless refused, course). People mid-40s getting 2nd doses moment, everyone older higher risk already 2.

I already checked municipal water usage, since thought might something much people watering yards sprinkers such. total bust, though. actually really counter intuitive - found residential water use actually *lower* areas wet ground! wanna say, “duh”? I’m confused whether delta gives fever not. article says there’s less fever told awhile ago fevers weren’t good indicator really, it’s easiest thing test.

It maybe also perceive ""good"" acceptable level country. Netherlands find less 1,000 cases good, ""signal level"" lowest since early September. Romania might different. Netherlands always quite high level cases entire pandemic, considered ""low"" here.

The vaccinations going quite well, administered doses yesterday day weekly average almost 240,000 vaccinations per day. Around 61% adults least partially vaccinated 32% fully vaccinated. vaccination willingness among population seems 85% 90%. vaccination grade among seniors also high.

So honestly know Romania's cases also test positivity low. partially vaccinated 28% adults fully vaccinated 26% adults. vaccinations hardly growing anymore, vaccination rate low trending downwards around 40,000 vaccinations per day. deaths also much higher Romania. ICU patients (could find data hospital patients/admissions) pretty similar. cases test positivity much, much higher Netherlands reason.

I know reason difference is. 1) could always data countries incomparable, 2) Romania much stricter measures level cases and/or 3) people Romania take much seriously. went supermarket today Netherlands well half people wear masks one really cared, mandatory public indoor buildings walking around.

This frustratingly close truth (bear me) feel like obtuseness intentional. _technology_ behind J&amp;J vaccine _potential_ used vaccinate certain cancers. frustrating close said reality tech's potential. judge's ruling:  Here's ruling itself, long difficult read: means vaccines protects worse symptoms, also makes less infectious. great opening up. think key raise efficacy unvaccinated. Better efficacy case (forcibly) mean vaccinated better facing Delta variant Alpha. Probably linked instead vulnerable population, cases run better virus also virulent, sending people hospital. worse hospitalization ratio unvaccinated makes numbers vaccinated people shine better, guess Obviously. Jewish space lasers making earth magnetic. thing UK adults want vaccine access it. they’re extending restrictions enough supply meet demand, everyone choose level risk. Also, cases going unvaccinated young adults socializing again, spreading Covid other.

The US enough vaccines everyone wants one, cases going sharply socially mobile young adults generally vaccinated. comparing two countries really valid, regardless raw statistics. west diseases mostly eradicated. result entire generation grown without horrors losing friends family seeing polio close. herd immunity collapses many diseases come back, tables turn slowly, lot damage would done, esp people need society protect herd immunity Fair enough.

Clickbait research suggests fully vaccinated reduces *infection* rate reduces symptom/death rate:

in words, 90% efficacy also means 90% less likely become sufficiently infected transmit someone else. Even vaccinated, virus tend reproduce body, fast enough overwhelm immune system, never even notice infected, likely testing show either.


.

That said, working COVID ward, really still wear PPE protection even vaccinated. Getting exposed 1,000 times typical exposure probably enough make anyone get sick, even already vaccinated. thing Reddit honestly, less emojis. 

I find Twitter really helpful. Nope heat reason humans strongly tend think “us vs them” 

Or, likely, Gottlieb realizes average American can't wrap head around science evolution dumbing masses, trying make sound like football game: ""the virus attempts field goal mutated spike get enough leverage pulmonary cells swings wide uprights."" can’t really prevent variants gaining ground outcompete else People getting vaccinated fear virus, they're getting vaccinated fear social consequences conforming:

""Driving force behind change heart able travel see family, researchers say""

This whole thing disgusting propaganda operation start finish yet another sad exercise human conformity. Common sense prevails. Sorry can't come work building filled medically compromised people want take steps protect people deadly pandemic.  need set boundaries place work. Well think obvious, look extreme measures Ontario taken it, saw massive growth, going hit hard areas wont' react fast enough.  another variant reduces effectiveness even 

But point. can't reduce effectiveness vaccine even without risking spike protein become ineffective.

No one knows exactly breaking point lies. saying virus getting diminishing returns point need afraid much.

He trying balance caution without endless negativity fear mongering. really blame Australian government alone (but fail many things vaccine rollout) think also [demand outbreak, one bothering get vaccine themselves, suddenly everyone clamouring it. Phase 2a wants ""wait Pfizer"" give AZ rest instead. doubt huge shortage AZ they're manufacturing Melbourne?  Great read got runny nose. joke fly later, think people going hit ""too soon"" reactions. read, every time virus replicates, good chance mutating. That's *within* single person.

Most mutations neutral virus continues replicate. worse-than-useless dead-ended even within current host. actually become transmissible/more deadly/evasive/elusive.

Those latter ones get designated variants interest/concern/high-consequence detected move person person (odds slim variant detected soon emerges).

The faster/easier/better variant spreads, likely detected.

The problem high-consquence variants; *elusive* variants current tests work well detect. If/when emerge, definition, since harder detect current tests, researchers realize exist, also happen transmissible and/or deadly, even greater problem. hung girl like 4 months beginning pandemic said thought COVID bs going stop wearing PPE cuz wasn’t getting sick. part nursing group handled COVID patients apparently. Noped away really quick. country vaccinated Israel. Nearly every country total case counts Delta rising significantly week. hard certain individual country, total prevalence low affect total COVID case counts. best multiply prevalence total case counts (covariants uses 2-week periods, unfortunately math us). get rising numbers. guess “Some get better, others worse” isn’t good click bait. sourcing this?

Some vaccines lost due [mechanical lost due [human OLYMPICS I'm panicking. See response OP. Delta hit US 2020, far right column (rather far left) would fast disease progressed.

Even 48% US vaccinated, R0 2+ times original means pretty much back square one becomes dominant variant, fewer deaths vulnerable already vaccinated.  would ""interesting"" lack better word, turns true. record, 15% adults one shot Japan vaccinating almost 1 million per day. nearing USAs max pace er capita within 2 weeks  Late 50s Well.

Millions children; everybody else eligible spreads twice fast Jan 2020 variant, understand things correctly. Twice many people infected per infectious period (e.g. per week whatever accepted time unit).

See response OP, assuming infectious period 7 days. laid sick covid? lost insurance job? extraordinary. feel like legal recourse. sorry. 60% transmissible effective infecting vaccinated people. going become dominant variant virtually everywhere. much better spreading to.  fact refusing get vaccinated almost certainly see another lockdown least places.

See response OP Delta variant 60% higher R0 previous variant 50% higher R0 original, would play completely naive population.

In words, Delta variant hit US Jan 2020, far-right column would fast spread. shtick old. I'm boat lol. Got symptoms week ago I'm feeling lot better I'm really wondering cold not.

Figuring affects population already partially vaccinated/naturally immune another kettle fish, course. wait updated vaccines then? article pretty clear impact vaccination efforts. would coming donations covax, donating additional vaccines order need vaccinating population think Dr episode basically this. possible we'll get situation talk it'll something see coming keeping eye case counts there. 

I think would pretty difficult lock agin US. I'm sure would go well time. 

Too many people choosing get vaccinated many uneducated people afraid 5g towers. Immunity vaccination absolutely towers natural immunity infection, I'm sure comfortable people thinking would stand way dangerous variants. thing gets lately people decide wear masks one else is, yet keep nose hanging out. even bother? I’m assuming aren’t smart, kind pity them. work tjs? 6 years quit im cash 401k. agree we're one better ones far grocery stores go fuuuck it!! first weekend since quitting feels good. decision make determines another person willing put body. also decision make create caste system free country people, every right want put something body, essentially become second class citizens lose personal freedoms due that. Pretty sure intended part rant. ??? doses? doses go bad? need hurry use them? sort condition, autoimmune disease something would compromise way, would fall upon personal responsibility ensure safety. hundreds thousands strangers could potentially interact every day. group referring susceptible essentially anything requires strong immune system, covid. So, using excuse sudden, pandemic one batted eyelash? wear mask public force vaccines people protect immune compromised flu anything else year half ago? No. heart scan? mean eventually virus mutate point able latch cells properly, indeed keep mutating. 

There guarantee that. Variants may emerge drift way variants may not. whole network, know two people got it. Everyone else ran gamut fairly cautious cautious (including places zero restrictions point). Didn’t UK variant cause month long leveling off? read somewhere 70% cases. Previous infection necessarily protect Delta+.  they’re 30 low risk wouldn’t even bother. protection J&amp;J really good hospitalization death prevention. That's point. virus spread mutate might know helping, like before.

Delta+ rough. Asymptomatic cases build spread continues. before, curve flattening probably make comeback Fall. antibody test done 2 weeks second pfizer shot. positive provide quantity. know air value test, would likes see fall range others. People want covid vaccine anti vaxxers Christ sakes. Anti vaxxers want kids get important mandatory vaccines able go school. Dude, wear mask. literally sleep one. Best grass season EVER! Except reliably lagging behind UK goes through. 

People hard time lagging indicators. UK pretty well vaccinated cases still going due Delta+. 

We panic aware. That's really low bar. probably *some* level effectiveness time continues drip lower lower come boosters, they're already doing. Claiming always effective less helpful. Fortunately live society adopted freedom one core ideologies, seeing rational government officials banning covid passports. radical liberal progressive states outright discarded whole idea. places New York, Portland California adopted strict authoritarian stance seeing even brought up. dumb. reach dumb. Agreed. Placating people best insurance policy. effectiveness vaccines **are reduced**, point one shot 33%. 

When another variant reduces effectiveness even breakthrough cases (which going up) lot people surprised mad. 

It's better idea give people straight, imo. people still even eligible vaccination. Standard procedure. Go drive kids car. Really? think I've following pandemic pretty closely completely passed runny nose could symptom COVID. I'm continuing defend people's rights prove whether vaccinated. case brought really merit people cannot get vaccinated due medical reasons. say... people take extra precautions protect themselves. someone's, perfectly healthy capable making reasonable choices, responsibility protect group public setting. want go case basis, hospitals nursing homes sure, common sense. ""you must vaccinated freedoms restricted"" nonsense needs stop. Hey mate March 2020 anymore. Well sucks. often headaches (just came 1.5 day length one) seasonal allergies include runny nose. sore throat… yet. 

Harder diagnose yuge two three symptoms norm happens Delta variant, possibly spreading even mask usage, unknowingly sore throat appears. feel like caveat vaccines still work focus thst people brush VOC off. 

People need know serious new variants without fearmongering also dismissive people pretend exist present higher risk. 

I'm fully vaccinated I'm still masking along son since still waiting approval 12s. 

The new variant Delta, Delta Plus (Delta+ / Delta K417N) lumped regular B.1.617.2 really AY.1 / B.1.617.2**.1**. 

Too much focus keeping people freaking escapse enough continued focus preventing variants gaining ground. 

The longer takes vaccinate world, opportunities exist worse variants keep cropping up. “Massaging” bullshit way say “lying”. 

This feels like watching train crash across world. terrible idea. Republicans likely anti-vaxxers remain unvaccinated Democrats.

Is anyone saying case?  fact, say exactly that? barely 50% American population vaccinated, amazing people think already over. Let's hope there's dangerous mutation Delta variant escape vaccines. America acting like ""Mission Accomplished"" 3 months ago asking trouble. real test seeing happens next winter.   like phrasing ""onset new symptoms"" basically feeling chronic that's worrisome  need learn induced demand. widen road 16 Lanes get 16 Lanes traffic Uptake high indeed. ""X going cause surge! wait bit.""

It's like broken record. Fairfax gang represent!!!!!!!  trend I've seen elsewhere outside CA. Businesses hot hard realizing ones mask requirements losing customers places without them. end business, goal business make money, places start dropping sooner later risk leaving customers table. here. months. I'm Ontario we're still locked pretty hard, want reminded rest western world opening :( lol it? Public trust Government hanging thread. public know Indian variant blame They're similar identical. 

Regardless, I'm sure point is. Mine simply people covid antibodies vaccinated. view good thing. study more. Especially comparing two seeing one fairs better others mutations. Maybe vaccine learn NI maybe won't. study monitor it. joke…. vaccinated, cares point, everyone wanted vaccine it, everyone else taking risk. Wish wasn’t behind paywall. :( don’t buy narrative covid cannot controlled controlled many countries. Reflecting difference Australia countries, learned early intervention eliminate cases totally, small numbers managed contact tracing. Overall spend lot less time restrictions lifestyle pretty “normal”, economy recovery pretty well. hardly unique, many countries didn’t need spend lot time restrictions either. virus still react lockdown measures relatively quickly compared vaccine rollout. Compared countries always need run restrictions reduce spread there’s end sight, ticking time bomb virus learns workaround defences. I'm sorry hear that! hearing loss tinnitus come fairly quickly vaccine? 

I hope specialist able help out. three months, tinnitus could well still go away lose hope. Also, hearing loss getting fitted hearing aid help reduce tinnitus good bit even go away. keep head hang there! trust ""research China"" because? V izz-A Happy hear it. guess got unlucky. messed first one go second one. 10 years parking lot fight insane cope lol Half country doesn’t full protection vaccine (didn’t get one doses). Also, people haven’t vaccinated serve incubators new variants emerge. Variants may well change evade vaccines.

The US basically stupid right now. Either vaccinate everyone keep measures place eliminate spread virus. Don’t vaccinate half people drop measures spread stopped.  shit tinnitus. Get second dose stop playing Hamlet ""Hank, man man, can't son going around kicking kids nuts."" decoy Air Force One

That interesting! I’ve definitely caught playing “real decoy” game. Usually helicopters. family always take guess since seem live regularly used part flight plan. Tell stop fucking moron  fair, lot government employees commute since Fairfax darn expensive.  don’t know numbers, it’s anecdotal anyway, ive known people getting tested last 2 weeks whole last year combined. 

I won’t say testing increased ton, places saw didn’t huge lines anything. there’s definitely demand tests now, especially summer upon us. many places requiring negative covid tests activities, camps, etc. westerners? westerners even trust governments though? nightmare. Company work authorize higher pay employees hourly managers stuck us new hires matter. country opening back said employees managers leaving higher paying retail warehouse jobs. company starts getting lower-level salary guys', like myself, asses wondering causing turnover. 

Working 55-plus hours week seems like forever keep restaraunt operating. can't even use vacation time can't take short staffing. company offering us take ""payout"" time instead taking time off, dude need time off. 

My days even days off, spend time phone putting fires worried forced come day store short handed operate standard. 

I wonder sometimes even legal giant company work tell available 24-7, even scheduled day off, restaraunt face consequences times days, I'm needed.

So much ""hero"" bonus got last year, employees getting treated like anything hero point. It’s frustrating, switch on-switch lockdown levels till population substantially vaccinated probably way go. UK using vaccine use India, single doses particularly effective see variant.

On positive side, severe symptomatic infection doses seems rare. know one old couple contracted variant (presumably) shots within two weeks shot. hospitalisation recovered well, except it’s month sense taste / smell back, they’ve lost quite bit weight due eating properly.

But thats neither there, think month even limited lockdown would certainly help. Get many vaccinated possible mean time. Wtf 6 correct number Let's wait kids get vaccinated rushing make things 100% normal. That's funny. nursing school, prof acknowledged people need time organization optimally learn taught certain self care tasks. Meanwhile time, nursing school basically rushes learn huge chunk shit short amount time resort studying test bank rationales. probably bad. certainly easy. straining mental health. alternative people resort necessarily make comfortable.

With said, things learn school exactly apply nurse. stuff learn school pass NCLEX. archaic method teaching. programs literally teach pass test, nurse.

Hospitals host programs rather going schools nursing schools pretty disorganized severe mess. spouse actually go get first one, actually. Apparently well oiled machine. Yep, it’s wild see! Logically know huge percentage folks grocery store vaccinated. Yet still wearing masks indoors. Trader Joe’s day I’d bet every adult store time able to, vaccination. saw one person without mask worked there. Sure distribute time? country still 2% fully vaccinated want vaccine here. variant requires modified vaccine every years would absolutely nightmare. need eye test? told us essential workers bullshit. wanted squeeze could us company could make money. everyone 12, cannot vaccinated. attempt anyway. lost ass true shortage, temporary shortage caused hoarders wannabe empire builders. data back up, highly suspect people cross reference hot selling items Amazon &amp; eBay sale traditional box stores, drive around regional box stores buying stuff like Barbie dolls listing Amazon $5-$10 paid Walmart. Barbie doll thing something saw YouTube video couple years ago, imagine laughs seeing obese 50 year old man filling huge SUV Barbie merch. that's people post-2008 economy. It’s politics anti vaxxers. new technology going revolutionize medicine, probably much CRISPR PCR have. I'm hoping there's going Nobel Prizes given this. Same, vax Since March. think seemed week two hiccup got dashboards up, went fast. Signing waiting say it’s turn. guess friends 1b (thanks covid 15!) contacted went. process easy centers, didn’t drive clear across state find vaccination. thought rollout seemed good compared areas, even slow first couple weeks. hard address. people proven capable enough trust people's lives.

I know mechanism (or suspect man inflammatory say) makes choose path really know vax keep safe help stop transmitting disease. Every piece actual evidence shows vaccines get us VITT adenovirus vaccines they're amazingly safe.

It's incredible greatest thing ever happened (effective vaccines within year crippling pandemic) turned something mistrust.

Everything sucks us mask wearing almost immediately stopped Midwest state. company trying force us come back open office full people masks people vocally opposed vaccine. I’m verge quit job don’t want one breakthrough case thanks idiots work spread husband , would probably need vent worse.  Congrats! I'm done mine.

Oxford study deals restrictions taken various governments zero economic data. UCLA link doesn’t link study homepage Yahoo link brief interview used write article. 

I linked article showed 7% Michigan’s economy tied auto manufacturing one showed tourism 10% Florida gdp. sole purpose links. GDP standard used original article. 

I’m bringing Disney Universal huge tourist attractions completely closed 4 months still full capacity. Cruises another huge draw they’ve dry-docked

Again, idea didn’t consider study isn’t linked. Show know considered Everyone know work got second dose. Even people still respecting social distancing wearing masks safe. everyone. everyone 12 choice protect present. know two hospital nurses called names said vaccines mandatory medical personnel.

They can't seem understand OK restaurant workers tie hair... also OK medical staff accept basic hygiene rules proven save lives vulnerable patients... Depends incentive is. already incentive get vaccinated, called getting sick, dying, spreading disease. Holy shit, twice??? times? basically hour drive. exactly epic adventure.  interesting. well there's emerging evidence suggesting people natural immunity need 1 2 vaccination doses get topped immunity. may able celebrate this. shoes i'd probably get second dose anyway though. least protected quite w/the double vaccination + previous covid infection. 

are aware whether got people infected? I'm okay vaccine arms race. I’m librarian. expect keep universal mask mandate vaccines available 2-12. obligated provide equal, safe access library everyone regardless age, library system decided need wait everyone choice protected vaccine (under 2s largely protected maternal vaccination). It’s hassle worker, I’m happy many families *super* grateful. see majority businesses making masks optional even people decide go maskless, people still need carry masks I’m sure venues like require fall. won’t approve unless really believe it’s better kid get it. move point approving vaccines WORSE person receiving they’re good general pop, that’s situation deadly disease hands force vaccinate, basically society breaking down.

I LOVE NOVA!  I'm wondering less-vaccinated rural areas threat more-vaccinated cities. I'm watching district fall. Cases lower summer. Maybe remain low. shall see.

I concerned hospitalizations thing considering. Kids lot life left live I'm seeing solid research long term effects Covid. Even acute infection remains less severe kids, would love see follow look signs long term organ damage etc. accepted risks flu illnesses rates occurs illnesses. I'd love see good studies compare covid illnesses long term effects too.  Bob Wachter, chair UCSF dept medicine: 16/ do? vaccinated person, watch Delta % region (currently ~6% U.S. &amp; rising) &amp; Covid cases community. you’re seeing cases &amp; Delta, I’d restore precautions (esp. high risk) – 17/ … indoor mask wearing (if you’ve stopped; BTW, haven’t) places w/ unvaxxed/unmasked folks. 
If you’re unvaxxed, get shots! may reassured low local case rate , don’t be: may due summer plus still-low Delta fraction. think putting self-protective mask working indoor gym cases spike area delta variant prevalence increases. I'm already required wear mask 10 hrs day clinical setting.   countries restricted supply. I'll optimistically waiting another month, potentially longer.  But, if, hypothetical here, one enough arrows blot sun? get data that's useful districts like wearing them.

Everybody knows India devestating second wave primarily driven Variant. 

So people hear Indian Variant make connection start getting alarmed maybe proactive. Part equation comes opportunities mutate, host, someone infected. way difference 88% effective 95% effective vaccine equate that. way reduced number potential hosts among vaccinated. Fewer hosts, smaller potential problematic mutations. starters claim, read multiple reputable news outlets. Okay got source Denmark? 44% world's they?  What's actually important UK one largest Indian populations frequently travel back forth. also block flights late, borders porous.   I'd say we'd similar honest. say many expect partially vaccinated then. basically virus continue act like virus infection millions hosts. Good know viruses still virus unprecedented time! Nothing going happen infant daughter. Thanks! I’ll week. end july 89% first doses 18+

72% fully vaccinated. Denmark world leader, starters. submitted global library way indicative actually sequenced worldwide. claim bullshit. I'm really speed new names, Delta Indian one, B.1172 British one? name? Beta? called scientific collaboration. really idea skeptical UK world leading sequencing. guys tried talking mental health specialist you? Make sure talk state mind.

Also could incorporate meditation sessions. kind meditation may need can't tell ppl anxiety react differently different types. may benefit greatly, others may make worse, speak MHS.. still get it. Vaccination makes lot less likely hospitalized Stores listen mask mandates social distancing enforce own, even extremely vocal Bay Area weather ""70s 80s....and rarely rains"" even monger that- April, sometimes March November."" think believe I'm suggesting force vaccines people protect immunocompromised people. I'm suggesting all.

I agree vaccination choice. vaccination checks UK; forcing people vaccine counterproductive.

I think we've ever forced people vaccine UK, though try encourage people.

Masks little different, though I'd love hear opinion mask-wearing. viral variants likely spotted U.K. anywhere else. Jan. 29, U.K. submitted 44%, around 190,000, genomes held global library""

So 44%, half world's total. Obviously sampling handful people enough make conclusions.

However, wish data researchers. know would reading paper! aware randomized sampling works? notion there‘s huge number cases that‘s escaping tad ridiculous. Also, REALLY doubt UK half worlds sequencing. fact, I‘m 100% sure aren’t. fiancée longer term symptoms since November, vaccine (AZ) weeks ago claims much better. wonder there's still light persistent infections lingering body. That's great. Hopefully see countries  projection Belgium then?   Well, sums pretty good tbh  Also helps UK half world's sequencing, lot known variants make virus UK. said Indian variant makes 90% cases UK now. countries Germany could much lower % cases variant, hence looks spreading slower. many aware life insurance companies even paying 'experimental', one proof America gone.

Source?  Yea, uptake also high belgium.

Mid low 90's depending age groups.  actually already knew EU countries better social health programs US. curious reasons well. Also thought German easier Spanish? Least sounds easier hear words. can't ever get tongue roll correct double R's. UK areas stuff largely spreading significantly lagging behind rest UK vaccination rates.  similar situation NJ? EEOC issued guidance fine mandate current covid vaccines. Finally Who's joking?

In seriousness, COVID 2020 awful many reasons. I'll god damned enjoy lockdown. broke monotony life. want things go ""back normal."" hope whole experience leads positive societal change. Extremely high uptake one factor. I'm countries, lot older people refused vaccine meaning younger ones could get earlier. already 87-88% 1st dose take! course consequences. leads people think vaccines bad thing CREATE vaccine resistant viruses.  Roughly third ignore anything says virus anyways 😁 happened edited titles rule? many people misunderstand this. virus reacting anything do. vaccine resistant strains become prevalent less fit variants get defeated. COULD result fit variant proliferating would competition, that's foregone conclusion. still good thing able wipe less fit variants. literally anti vaxx refuse vaccine? missing something? well grandma grandpa boomers, mom dad were, say Boomers biggest issue free world

yeah, boat sailed GWB. One thing always remember though, science never perfect, established ""facts"" disproven time.

There big difference ""highly unlikely"" ""impossible"". Scientists understand this, general public typically doesn't.

If variant way defeat vaccine way nobody saw coming, getting public go back pandemic mode point would less impossible. would also convince lot people understand science works science flawed. Unlike religion, science claim definitive answers, observations. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

We need utilitarianism now, BEST outcome MAJORITY would roll back nearly every mandate vaccination high enough virus ableto keep up, fortunately state this.

I'm sorry, I'm shits give them. one nearly surefire way get covid badly take it, either us protect anymore. Get N95 underwear ready!! Soft paywall.

Alternate concern think possibility 53 could infect unvaccinated patients. Also keep mind cases asymptomatic aren't. know long infected. Article lots data charts vaccine effectiveness UK.

Well takes least go semblance normality, sign up. would nice they'd talk someone CEO drug company. Like, dunno, actual vaccinologists guy invented mRNA technology.

Around 600k doses Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna currently delivered weekly. bit 16m doses required fully vaccinate adults, i.e. around 10m additional doses needed that.

Translation:

---

**51 percent everybody 18 years older received least one dose vaccine. one fourth [of adults] vaccinates two doses.**

\- vaccinations continuing follow recommendations exit pandemic. fact vaccinated half adults least one dose milestone reason rejoice, also come far way second doses fullt protection, says Johan Carlsson, director-general Swedish Health Agency.

Since start [of vaccinations] 26 December 2020, total 4.1 million people received least one dose vaccine, 2.2 million also received second dose. means 51 everybody 18 years received one dose 27 percent received second dose. shown data National vaccination registry.

To quickly reach greatest risk becoming seriously ill die, elderly prioritized. Among 65 years older 91 percent received least one dose 63 percent fully vaccinated. (Data 14 June)

The vaccine coverage lower among people born outside Sweden, latest statistics show proportion vaccinated group increased last weeks.

\- high vaccine coverage enough, also needs evenly distributed prevent local outbreaks places many unvaccinated, says Johan Carlssons, director-general Swedish health agency. mean, that's answer... Oh watch, will. wait Two Weeks™!!!! Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* didn’t see linked article, I’ve following, vaccine going first used globally applying use countries US, fine, we’ve got enough supply others. 15% world vaccinated yet, one manufactures quick. Again, can't change headline per rules. see studies Lo Jolla Immunology NEJM findings antibodies. beef headline, can't change that. goal discuss study. helps read headline. I-66 I-270 double decker freeways. sure percentage fairfax county actually grew went schools (which really good).

Rich people generally afford good education (private houses good public districts). People react react. people see results gives **hope**. things powerful that. even useless self reported spontaneous report received consumer reported reading seeing news concerned patient unspecified age, race, ethnic origin sex. patient's height, weight reported

So basically someone saw something news reports almost supporting information. mean rate holds it'd astounding, it'd literally kill less people flu given year.

Assuming everyone vaccinated course. Well thing one vaccines got approval going various strains covid-19 got running around Pfizer moderna AstraZeneca got EUA's FDA pre-spread variancle concerns

But seem like results aren’t second trial guess wrong. Maybe one shot given emergency approval two shots aren’t. I'm bit surprised results, Index part state media (not apparently sites, still influence) government really pushing Sinopharm Sputnik, I'd say results valid. That's reflect unique features individual’s immune system, strength actually look statistics trials, people didn’t side effects. little 50% didn’t experience side effects remember, still 94% protected receiving vaccine. So, don’t need worry don’t symptoms COVID-19 vaccinations. mean people react vaccine severely less protected, says Dr. Joanna Schaenman, expert infectious diseases immunology aging David Geffen School Medicine UCLA. symptoms illness undoubtedly part immune response, immune response counts protection, says. ""That preserved across age groups likely independent whether local systemic side effects not."" people taking shots anyway best send abroad. read article, good news hope FDA gives EUA (assuming data supports so). I'm sure people argue current vaccines sufficient, NovaVax uses different technology (it's protein subunit vaccine) offer additional way defense variants. EUA would enable us swiftly deploy stock needed, eases process allow us start including NovaVax trials determine efficacy mixing vaccines. started two dose trial months one dose trial. Yes, effects disease demonstrably worse side effects vaccines (AZ J&amp;J blood clotting issue aside)

I'll give example:

Covid:
- fever 2 weeks
- random body aches
- loss senses
- unable sleep properly duration illness
- shortness breath month even walking

Vaccines:
Dose 1:
- Pain injection site day
- minor body aches waking day dose, went away couple hours

Dose 2: 
- felt fever / chills day recieved dose, thermometer didnt register anything. Woke next day completely normal

Most family friends got covid got vaccines report thing. hate country sometimes :)  original comment pre-covid better every way. I'm simply saying wasn't. Work home would happened without pandemic. Would trade current life millions people alive again? Sure, that's reality. area, less docs (no one followed trend one followed evidence early shaved head/eyebrows) reading news (vaccine safely given lots people, making huge difference outcomes). Easier math heparin drip. really nothing new hanging around platform throughout pandemic. 

Vids involving politically charged subjects (vaccines big one unfortunately) always filled idiots spouting bunch nonsense. channels consistently brigaded.

YouTube's comment structure much ""friendly"" type comments. 

On Reddit, comments would instantly downvoted less disappear new sets eyes (unless posting anti-vax subreddit something). flu shot always free... live isn't? think insurance flu shot like $1-3 insurance always free... ironic. really want tell people refusing anything might possibly construed ‘liberal compliance’ regardless personal cost actual political affiliation measure grow well. assure people keen piling new vaccines top vaccines there's others vaccinate all, mutating hell covid.

A lot people take flu shot every year. covid shot every year (which likely *not* needed frequently everyone) big ask.

What earth think solution is? can’t imagine frustrating that’s got be! expected people get selfish, like whole toilet paper issue. expect things harm others go interest too. title extremely misleading. They're applying emergency use authorization. mention plan filing FDA approval. That’s interesting question. Considering EUAs intended scenarios fully approved options available, wonder Pfizer Moderna’s choice seek full approval impacts EUA system. Btw haven’t seen HBomberGuy great recent video covers Andrew Wakefield paper started lot vaccine autism hysteria. Included lot stuff I’d never heard of. ""mmh, yes... floor made floor"" necessary.

The effectiveness J&amp;J increases time like vaccines.

We seeing tons breakthrough infections people got J&amp;J.

If going make feel better, get one shot mRNA vaccines, made choose recommendation, would Pfizer. Moderna larger dose, probably need. 

Part trial information said something like ""participation trial cannot prevent getting another vaccine later"", even people got vaccine placebo. wait September? Pfizer Moderna quicker apply following phase 3 results... initial study, November 2020. seven months ago. 

Why two dose still running single dose finished? Lol! Thanks, needed today! Yeah plus people disease infects chances mutation occur. think one biggest issues people thinking possibility death considering detriment hospitals economy, chance mutation possible long term chronic problems caused disease. symptoms like salt pepper condiments, would determine exclusive cause corona virus sleeping AC night? still drive around spread virus. Surprised flu shots. town runs clinics ask insurance information it, don't, still get shot there's payment. I’ve never paid flu shot US. remember 15%. see 18% minimum lot restaurants set suggested tip 20%. see kind inflation. surprised standard 25% soon. buddy moved US Ethiopia anti vaxxers would absolutely infuriate man got pissed nothing. 

He knows people back home go get vaccinated comes sees people willingly refuse vaccinations easy get. assure people keen piling new vaccines top vaccines there's others vaccinate all, mutating hell covid.

It's catch 22 sift society there's nothing good left it. Someone's bitter.

Yes, privilege. UK trials tend demographically underpowered. FDA requirements Trials, it’s like weren’t enough vaccines US. Definitely. fact Victoria hitting 100% vaccine utilisation, even states sending us can’t get arms fast can, fantastic benefit. It’s shame took fear death motivate this, I’d prefer two week lockdown means reach 90% vaccinated faster everyone else 

You see desperate O’Brien heavily leaned conspiracy
It’s amazing pathetic willing order get airtime all. know. Especially outside big cities, public transport option. That's getting at. getting approved US make easier to, e.g., manufacture doses export world? great vaccine work continuing, there's lot benefit *to US* adding another vaccine mix right now, although places still desperately need get. also trial access. even one free article month. Rectums. even pick target date going hold it? Terrible leadership would terrible, business' would able fire 'public health' violation. takes away worker rights  think good news. headaches runny noses, less respiratory distress better. Wait, India UK? India unexpected population density, figure UK looks bad. We'll vaccinate children. can’t somehow get without world deal pandemic causes big amounts deaths destroys everyone’s lives? important you’d rather keep living perpetual lockdown force everyone same? 
I doubt it, that’s comment sounded like me. Something I'd like point pertaining ignorance subject. say ""100% effective"" means 100% effective keeping hospital would normally severe medium reaction covid infection. mean 100% effective preventing spread covid symptoms. breakthrough case receiving shots Moderna 2 months 2nd shot. Still can't taste smell right. without vaccine, comorbidities, hospitalized dead point. Vaccines work good news overall.  Source? hope things less patchwork.

Lots people hoping varying reasons. Let's hope see news like this. J&amp;J two dose trial currently ongoing hasn’t reported results yet. Pfizer trial, 10 severe cases; breakdown 9/1. Again, way fewer would expect.

The statistics obviously great severe disease trials; however, know efficacy going efficacy symptomatic disease--so know quite high.

There really much now. Cases like 10% Pfizer ran trials, can't trials taking 10x long, kind is.  Hm, that’s good. people won’t bother covid testing mild symptoms. get symptoms skipping dusting vacuuming weeks. 🤷‍♀️ Yeah matter ""side effects"" are, considering I'm past middle aged chronic conditions side effects would better Covid. Yes areas rain falls wet. Areas drought not. lucky, things mentioned make people equally unproductive Pfizer's clinical trial study never said 100% effective severe disease. stated confidence interval included 100%. media said 100% protective severe disease. don’t go tell grandma? I’m sure she’ll glad get anti bodies catching COVID get trying say particularly helpful, related topic. Probably Novavax apply authorization? I’m sure Novavax waited till US trials completed applying use. think non us counties begging hits hardest.

Again, people able get excellent *individual* protection vaccines, even variants.

We going shut society protect refuse protect themselves.

With ~65% adults vaccinated, substantially cut number people likely hospitalized, mitigating overrun.

Finally, vaccine hesitancy tends clustered. many cities (including mine) 75-80% adults already vaccinated. Hospital capacity going threatened here. *might* need masks fall. stay-at-home orders even restaurant closures thing past. Guess I'll booking flight California. Thanks heads up! Good bot.

There’s VAERS serious methodological weaknesses discussed article.

There’s V-Safe somewhat similar VAERS asks patients self report data (including reassuring “I feel good” responses) pre-set time points. gives general idea side effects rather catching severe (a weakness VAERS).

There’s also vaccine safety data link, draws electronic medical records billing claims, compares rates outcomes vaccinated unvaccinated people. probably reliable, adds delay due time takes collecting data.  think US's big hope virus burns small populations quickly much staying power there, whereas densely populated cities populationbfully vaccinated. rural communities public transportation. Still, look figures severe disease, seems based 100% efficacy claim 4 people placebo group. low. breakout could actually put hospital variants. think elements spike protein. Tell something obvious. fair, China warn us lack mask mandate beginning would bite us. large numbers people keep refusing vaccinate. Eh least science background guy. surely good understanding going virus advisement/briefing.

OP responded elsewhere ThinkFull's Flex Engineering program. RemindMe! 4 weeks. went costco tried use insurance get flu shot. think copay $30, told shot $20 would easier pay $20 cash it. did. 

I bad insurance time though, $20 cheapest could find flu shot for. 2019 think. Nope protects they've tested see wearing mask optimally still works. kids I've seen know wear masks. kid know parents fault. sources statements? that’s call: painfully obvious, even look this? seems like could’ve looking something little mysterious. Someone clearly chose challenge today. unvaccinated chosen learn hard way rather easy way. much that. comment day award lol one knows curve long antibodies natural infection last looks like.
I think anyone really knows curve long antibodies vaccines going either.
How frequently vaccine need changed new variants also unknown.


These things curves probability vary person. Antibody tests statistically significant portion population help define curves lead recommendations, etc.


If already assuming going yearly shot this, start yearly shot now?


As waste money - creating things bulk gets cheaper economies scale. planning point view creating enough vaccine fully vaccinate everyone reasonable.
If everyone going get vaccine every year investing infrastructure able create much vaccine yearly good investment, waste money.


And infrastructure used mRNA vaccines explored even better investment.
That part reason technology transfer allow countries industrial capacity make vaccines done.


Ideally next possible pandemic causing virus send everyone details create mRNA vaccine it. vaccine plants around world make doses deploy necessary. sort health.. committee organization like thing could used organize response area.. region.. across world. /s


Once get everyone wants vaccine vaccine fine letting chips fall may people want take chances.
For people can't take vaccines. Sorry hear best do. Canadaian-American here

I'll curious see changes year. might support staff guess, certainly comparable pay support staff U.S. states COVID rising? 

Yes, they’re rising US states counties low vaccination rates. Additionally, *some communities* relatively low vax rates aren’t seeing cases “rise,” aren’t falling. 

From article, since you’re hitting paywall. States higher vaccination rates markedly fewer coronavirus cases, infections dropping places residents immunized rising many places people not, Washington Post analysis States lower vaccination also significantly higher hospitalization rates, Post found. Poorly vaccinated communities reporting catastrophic conditions. Instead, usually seeing new infections holding steady increasing without overwhelming local Vaccination always even within state, Post found connection vaccine shots coronavirus cases local level comparing 100 counties low vaccination rates (fewer 20 percent residents vaccinated) 700 high vaccination rates (at least 40 percent Counties high vaccination low coronavirus rates going down. counties people vaccinated, higher case rates, number cases experts worry unvaccinated people falling false sense security transmissible variants rapidly spread areas high concentration unvaccinated people abandoned masking social uptick infections numerous states offers preview summer surges could take hold “if unvaccinated continue behave though they’re vaccinated,” said Michael Saag, infectious-disease doctor University Alabama Birmingham. now, risk unevenly distributed, concentrated communities shots sparse, said. think continue wear mask limit unnecessary exposure. downvoted? still catch virus likely won’t even know viral load low chances spreading would rare.

EMA issued pharmacological approval vaccinating ages 12+ BNT/Pfizer. vaccines age groups follow trials hopefully conclude good results. 
The STIKO *recommend* blanket vaccination teens time due small trial size (no visibility rare side effects) low risk severe infection symptoms age group, recommends already at-risk teens. Teenagers 12+ get vaccinated (with BNT/Pfizer currently; get appointment) regardless recommendation.

Once data bigger trials rollout population, STIKO update recommendation. dumb article. Obviously. certain date cases happen tick threshold say ""Surprise! reopen right now""? look data around comment: 144million fully vaccinated Americans, 309million total doses - 2k deaths. Depending look it, 3x many fully vaccinated, almost 10x doses confirmed cases Covid-19 US, stands around 34million. 600,000 deaths. 300x likely die Covid vaccines. that's raw numbers account massive difference size two groups. truth likely close 3000x (doses vs cases).

It's really shame people manipulated kind thinking. misinformation campaigns real damage society. might virus poorly children Africa require lower amounts vaccination reach herd immunity.

This seems likely me. Multiple studies shown people less serious symptoms worse spreading virus go develop severe disease. Young children (under 10 - 12) generally develop severe disease. also small, weaker lungs (compared adults) closer ground.

Now, said, kids less likely get tested, less likely get treatment hospitals despite similar symptoms (can't find link rn) compared adults.

Kids get Covid, get sick, died. However, they're important vaccinate adults, yet (in opinion, free disagree, blame you). large majority adult population vaccinated, see huge drops transmission (see Israel, US, etc), disproportionately good spreaders vaccinated. fair, assume people never understood old science either. RNA definitely makes easier scare people though, sure. wait hear animal reservoirs explain metal sticks ground rains. RAIN MAKING GROUND MAGNETIC! live? I’ve also never paid flu shot life, surprised hear people paying  numbers like Dela variant, two-dose regiment, would protection vulnerable populations since vaccines would concentrated people first rather spread wider slice population.

EDIT: clarify, 90% old people could vary well help severe COVID 33% protection spread old less vulnerable people. said fucked shit Covid started point blocked without saying anything. add, trial, two days symptoms, nasal swab three days row go office get one collected professional. grew expected even encouraged get chickenpox kid. Nowadays there's vaccine prevents shingles painful.  Seattle ""sprawl"" generally active. restaurants, shopping centers, variety things do. 

So agree you, Fairfax charging 80% Seattle pretty significant fairly loose uninteresting suburban sprawl. “surge” classic cold symptoms including runny nose covid. also low grade fever two weeks fatigued month total. Novavax showing good effectiveness variants could change game, especially Delta variant starts become dominant. harmful mutation occur, already approving Novavax potential get us ahead it.

That efficacy variants higher mRNA matters. also may appealing vaccine holdouts US, wary mRNA J&amp;J issues, potentially providing boost vaccination rates.

In short, FDA may find merit one data given.  Shocking analysis! girls. ADHD also diagnosed girls. know seen reports vaccinated athletes getting infected. seems decent amount athletes anti-vax since particular put bodies read previous article get vaccinated get COVID-19. think every state increase vaccine uptake Fall, lot people fence, plainly don’t give crap they’re situation it’s mandatory work, get shot want see family Thanksgiving Christmas. think depends definition ""threat"". far know, vaccinated population generally safe variants.

However, grand scheme things, unmitigated spread threat gives virus chances evolve. important vaccinate quickly broadly. 

One could reason putting multiple outbreaks next highly vaccinated populations like US (pockets high low vaxxed rates) could increase selection pressure virus evolve variant infect vaccinated people readily.

The problem even worse Pfizer - PLACEBO group zero deaths. mean placebo 100% AstraZeneca vaccine, one person control group severe COVID-19, eight people hospitalized; Johnson &amp; Johnson, 34 people placebo group severe COVID-19, five people hospitalized. It’s true zero vaccinated people hospitalized either study vaccines took effect. numbers small, can’t draw reliable conclusion high efficacy may outcomes.

You see fragile numbers looking compiled severe disease. **In Pfizer trial, example, one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three placebo group—which meant single bout disease made difference calculated efficacy rate 66 percent one 100 percent.** 

For Novavax Oxford-AstraZeneca trials, zero people severe disease vaccinated group versus one control group, adding subtracting one would even dramatic. **The problem even greater deaths. efficacy analysis, two vaccine trials—for Moderna’s Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported COVID-19 deaths control groups.**  one lesson stupid people world taking pandemic global society impossible without vaccines McConnell polio. took precautions personally COVID. never said word anti-mask, anti-vax crap Republicans spewed out. took care let country burn. many vaccinated would died, vaccinated?

[By ignoring Many virologists maintain coronavirus likely jumped animal human setting outside lab. without direct proof natural spillover, scientists politicians called full investigation lab leak theory.

Proponents lab investigation say researchers Dr. Shi’s institute could collected — contracted — new coronavirus wild, bat cave. scientists may created it, accident design. Either way, virus could leaked laboratory, perhaps infecting worker.

China sought influence investigations virus’s origin, promoting unproven allegations.

Beijing agreed allow team World Health Organization experts visit China, limited access. W.H.O. team said report March lab leak extremely unlikely, conclusion seen hasty. Even head W.H.O., Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: “I believe assessment extensive enough.”

Last month, President Biden ordered intelligence agencies investigate origin question, including lab theory. Sunday, leaders world’s wealthiest large democracies, Group 7 summit, urged China part new investigation origins coronavirus. Mr. Biden told reporters leaders discussed access labs China.

“Transparency matters across board,” Mr. Biden said.

In less polarized times, Dr. Shi symbol China’s scientific progress, forefront research emerging viruses.

She led expeditions caves collect samples bats guano, learn viruses jump animals humans. 2019, among 109 scientists elected American Academy Microbiology contributions field.

A top Chinese virologist’s insistence coronavirus didn’t escape Wuhan lab difficult verify.
“She’s stellar scientist — extremely careful, rigorous work ethic,” said Dr. Robert C. Gallo, director Institute Human Virology University Maryland School Medicine.

The Wuhan Institute Virology employs nearly 300 people home one two Chinese labs given highest security designation, Biosafety Level 4. Dr. Shi leads institute’s work emerging infectious diseases, years, group collected 10,000 bat samples around China.

Under China’s centralized approach scientific research, institute answers Communist Party, wants scientists serve national goals. “Science borders, scientists motherland,” Xi Jinping, country’s leader, said speech scientists last year.

Dr. Shi herself, though, belong Communist Party, according official Chinese media reports, unusual state employees status. built career institute, starting research assistant 1990 working way ranks.

Dr. Shi, 57, obtained Ph.D. University Montpellier France 2000 started studying bats 2004 outbreak severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, killed 700 people around world. 2011, made breakthrough found bats cave southwestern China carried coronaviruses similar virus causes SARS.

“In work do, prevent outbreak illness, we’ve done meaningful,” told CCTV, China’s state broadcaster, 2017.

But notable findings since drawn heaviest scrutiny. recent years, Dr. Shi began experimenting bat coronaviruses genetically modifying see behave.

In 2017, colleagues Wuhan lab published paper experiment created new hybrid bat coronaviruses mixing matching parts several existing ones — including least one nearly transmissible humans — order study ability infect replicate human cells.

Proponents type research say helps society prepare future outbreaks. Critics say risks creating dangerous new pathogens may outweigh potential benefits.

The picture complicated new questions whether American government funding went Dr. Shi’s work supported controversial gain-of-function research. Wuhan institute received around $600,000 grant money United States government, American nonprofit called EcoHealth Alliance. National Institutes Health said approved funding nonprofit conduct gain-of-function research coronaviruses would made infectious lethal.

Dr. Shi, emailed response questions, argued experiments differed gain-of-function work set make virus dangerous, understand might jump across species.

“My lab never conducted cooperated conducting GOF experiments enhance virulence viruses,” said.

‘Speculation rooted utter distrust.’

Concerns centered experiments Dr. Shi conducted, also conditions them.

Some Dr. Shi’s experiments bat viruses done Biosafety Level 2 labs, security lower labs institute. raised questions whether dangerous pathogen could slipped out.

Ralph Baric, prominent University North Carolina expert coronaviruses signed open letter Science, said although natural origin virus likely, supported review level biosafety precautions taken studying bat coronaviruses Wuhan institute. Dr. Baric conducted N.I.H.-approved gain-of-function research lab University North Carolina using information viral genetic sequences provided Dr. Shi.

Dr. Shi said bat viruses China could studied BSL-2 labs evidence directly infected humans, view supported scientists.

She also rejected recent reports three researchers institute sought treatment hospital November 2019 flulike symptoms, first Covid-19 cases reported.

“The Wuhan Institute Virology come across cases,” wrote. “If possible, provide names three help us check?”

As samples lab held, Dr. Shi maintained closest bat virus lab, shared publicly, 96 percent identical SARS-CoV-2, virus causes Covid-19 — vast difference genomic standards. rejects speculation lab worked viruses secret.

Dr. Shi’s research group miners Yunnan Province suffered severe respiratory disease 2012 also drawn questions. miners worked cave Dr. Shi’s team later discovered bat virus close SARS-CoV-2. Dr. Shi said lab detect bat SARS-like coronaviruses miners’ samples would publish details scientific journal soon; critics say withheld information.

“This issue important come forward everything timely transparent manner,” said Alina Chan, postdoctoral research fellow Broad Institute M.I.T. Harvard also signed Science letter.

Many scientists officials say China share employees’ medical records lab’s logs experiments viral sequence database evaluate Dr. Shi’s claims.

Dr. Shi said institute open W.H.O. global scientific community.

“This longer question science,” said phone. “It speculation rooted utter distrust.”

‘I nothing fear.’

The pandemic moment Dr. Shi team long braced for. years, warned risks coronavirus outbreak, building stock knowledge pathogens.

In January last year, Dr. Shi team worked frantically, exhausted, also excited, said Wang Linfa, virologist Duke-National University Singapore Medical School Wuhan Dr. Shi time.

“All experiences, reagents bat samples freezer finally used significant way globally,” said Dr. Wang, Dr. Shi’s collaborator friend 17 years.

Dr. Shi published important early papers SARS-CoV-2 Covid-19, scientists around world relied on.

But soon, speculation Dr. Shi lab began swirl. Dr. Shi, known among friends blunt, baffled angry — sometimes let show.

In interview Science magazine last July, said Mr. Trump owed apology claiming virus came lab. social media, said people raised similar questions “shut stinky mouths.”

Dr. Shi said saw politicization question sapped enthusiasm investigating origins virus. instead focused Covid vaccines features new virus, time, said, calmed down.

“I’m sure nothing wrong,” wrote. “So nothing fear. keep seeing that, incredibly shallow. comes mouth jerks morons. Anyone thinks clever witticism either purposely stupid, genuinely stupid.

Only utter idiot knew zero biology would thought 'three weeks flatten curve' would magically get rid covid permanently. \*never\* point. Keeping supressed vaccine treatment available was. 
“How earth offer evidence something evidence?” said, voice rising anger brief, unscheduled conversation. “I don’t know world come this, constantly pouring filth innocent scientist,” wrote text message.

In rare interview email, denounced suspicions baseless, including allegations several colleagues may ill outbreak emerged.

The speculation boils one central question: Dr. Shi’s lab hold source new coronavirus pandemic erupted? Dr. Shi’s answer emphatic no.

But China’s refusal allow independent investigation lab, share data research, make difficult validate Dr. Shi’s claims fueled nagging suspicions pandemic could taken hold city hosts institute known work bat coronaviruses.

Those favor natural origins hypothesis, though, pointed Wuhan’s role major transportation hub well recent study showed pandemic hit, city’s markets selling many animal species capable harboring dangerous pathogens could jump humans.

The Chinese government given appearance holding Dr. Shi suspicion. Despite international scrutiny, seems able continue research give lectures China.

The stakes debate extend scientists study infectious diseases. scientists cited lab leak scenario pushing greater scrutiny “gain function” experiments that, broadly defined, intended make pathogens powerful better understand behavior risks.

Many scientists say want hunt virus’s origins transcend politics, borders individual scientific achievements.

“This nothing fault guilt,” said David Relman, microbiologist Stanford University co-author recent letter journal Science, signed 18 scientists, called transparent investigation viable scenarios, including lab leak. letter urged labs health agencies open records public.

“It’s bigger one scientist institute one country — anybody anywhere data sort needs put there,” Dr. Relman said.   Top Virologist China, Center Pandemic Storm, Speaks Out
The virologist, Shi Zhengli, said rare interview speculation lab Wuhan baseless. China’s habitual secrecy makes claims hard validate.


To growing chorus American politicians scientists, key whether world ever learn virus behind devastating Covid-19 pandemic escaped Chinese lab. Chinese government public, hero country’s success curbing epidemic victim malicious conspiracy theories.

Shi Zhengli, top Chinese virologist, center clashing narratives research coronaviruses state lab Wuhan, city pandemic first emerged.

The idea virus may escaped lab long widely dismissed scientists implausible shunned others connection former President Donald J. Trump. fresh scrutiny Biden administration calls greater candor prominent scientists brought theory back fore.

Scientists generally agree still direct evidence support lab leak theory. say hypothesis dismissed hastily, without thorough investigation, point range unsettling questions.

Some scientists say Dr. Shi conducted risky experiments bat coronaviruses labs safe enough. Others want clarity reports, citing American intelligence, suggesting early infections Covid-19 among several employees Wuhan Institute Virology.

Dr. Shi denied accusations, finds defending reputation lab and, extension, country. Reached cellphone last week, Dr. Shi said first preferred speak directly reporters, citing institute’s policies.

Funny works, it?   Yes, people ""vaccinated COVID"" added numbers want population immunity.

There couple wrinkles: hard-ish count ""vaccinated COVID"" numbers, particularly places hit early testing widespread (e.g., New York City, quite possibly 1.6M people infected April 2020). direction, number people thought caught COVID actually bad cold something, really immunity. US, plentiful vaccines, simple rule like ""vaccinate everyone"" would cut around uncertainty.

The wrinkle ""vaccinated COVID"" OK, great, terms immunity seems provide. study UK healthcare workers late 2020 showed protection got COVID infection ballpark single dose one man-made vaccines. It'll get us by, better. People documented COVID infections later receive dose one mRNA vaccines get very, good protection.

One thing variants may infectious. Let's look Delta. estimated R0 around 6. Delta becomes dominant strain, herd immunity guess goes 1-1/6, so, say, 85% population needs immunity. Weird. Full vaccination number counts. Thank thoughtful write up. 

I understand necessity laws; understand logic favor them. It’s better population keep wealth within country (as example German elder care; home personal care assistant likely also lives area work, likely spend money locally continue enrich community). also makes favorable elderly remain country, keeping money local disincentivizing moving lower COL area.

I don’t think I’d consider UK, despite language cultural similarities. health care system trending toward level US at, system goal. mention economical issues continue face fallout Brexit; don’t see things getting better generation. received J&amp;N get single MRNA dose top mix matching vaccines countries now? They've keeping much higher safety stock AZ due unpredictable deliveries. buffer compensate disappointing deliveries. You’re severely underestimating level protection community large particular likely hospitalized

The chances hospitals becoming overwhelmed Delta technically zero. There’s also non-zero chance meteor destroying us moment. 

Point point COVID take mutation evades vaccines chance overwhelming hospital systems. that’s Delta Reminds measles. effectively disturbingly large group idiots decided vaccines bad. periodic spiking specific areas. Oh dear, almost article dares suggest science matter personal opinion. Actually Canada receiving 7.5 million doses Moderna week. Plus 2 million Pfizer.

I'm booked second shot next Friday! anyone knows, variants spread infected travelers, variants emerge independently different locations? Like, maybe virus limited range potentially successful mutations, we’ll likely see mutations pop wherever virus active (and mutating). r/unexpected?

/s Good. That’s full vaccination I’m correct. talking single dose 11 hours I’ll still mine since many unvaccinated fools still walking around.

- Also still California resident link pls. familiar Reddit system side bar finding group. Thanks advance That’s really weird thought Spain would country wants return normal soon possible get money tourism season  high initial numbers, takes long time come down. 10k per day ~1k shows amazing trend. steady 20-40% decline per week.

And quite lot infections, amount deaths limited - likely due older people fully vaccinated now. feeling even traditional vaccine things would different. issue US cultural distrust science, education, government institutions pushed several decades. number laughably wrong. Per state’s Covid website; hit 60% total population state I’ll shut up. We’ve still got 5% go. trust driving wear seatbelt. strange thing gamble health. I'm stating emphatically wrong. amount data B117 extensive. caused waves Europe, Canada, US, many parts world. There's immense data reproductive rate spikes, higher hospitalization rates, goes. Spain. Thing theres mask fanatism something even open nightlife clubs yet still wearing maska everywhere. hate masks much worst restrictions (check post history know why).

 im unlucky one countries treats like holy grail. countriea dropped masks even reopening normal cafeterias yet almost ""normal life"" mode still muzzled everywhere.  Antivaxxers: 😧 Source?  discussion  impossible people internet disagree me, therefore must bots downvoting. Needless fear-mongering would incorrect there's extensive data B117. absolutely transmissible. beginning pandemic short masks wondered medical people didn’t big plastic helmets oxygen tubes connected looks like may happening thumbnail. don’t disagree we’re one safest places be. simply don’t want see progress last 6+ months flushed toilet. kids begged get trusted immune system. We're seeing first hand people often say history ""rhymes"" cyclical.

Humans exist certain number decades, great job passing along collective ""visceral experiences"" next generations. preserve decontextualized abstract descriptions form literature scientific records, stuff becomes subject mistrust lot future people experience development facts ideas cures themselves, experience conditions things became acutely desired welcomed.

So specific contextual case, older people knew damage wrought polio TB pass away, surviving descendents get direct exposure experiences, start question still get vaccines stuff. Combined new sources misinformation linking vaccines autism, Bill Gates, fertility, people grasp onto *those* convincing truth simply messages relatable various problems exist *today*, diseases vaccines meant for, around today (because vaccines work well).

It's almost like never fully cure problem preserve specimen every kind human suffering, ""zoo"" future idiots see learn appreciate prior generations did. Hopefully [this pans out. might mean single flu shot (or one plus booster) could good life strains. vaccines developed less year.

30 years. length time took develop 30 would say applies *all* variants, Delta. I've always gotten swap test, accurate? think stemmed previous leader nation championing it. doubled back around. make up, thing. Math! 
Lol, realize right, want keep posting wrong ass numbers, seem decent fellow. 
 
Math checks out. 99ish dead clones.   UK's data topic point last variant, see reason doubt validity data time around. shit Sherlock  69% state vaccinated, that’s damn good. We’re best state honestly. It’s time look superior rest states like already are. thanks clarifying probably either. really something watching goalposts move VaCcInEs 100% eFfEcTiVe 95%!!1  news: Water wet. problem. sure data funky lately. Either way I’ll keep reporting. didn’t make sense today everything went yesterday. Maybe data correction error Sunday sure. vaccinations boosters date simply submit application nursing school. submit full vaccination records jobs. know went school license already verified. Basically yes. people won’t / can’t younger groups US, covid variants going knock us back March 2020.

Honest question: UK getting knocked back? cases rise rise now. would happen US spiking UK (it looks like creeping winter numbers soon)? glance relevant links megacomment  Partly common. Wow water wet gets better time.

We know need boosters anything year so, now, we're getting tons reports long covid vaccinated individuals. stupid stupid does. I'm still waiting ""American variant"" show wreck world second time. feel like matter ""when"" rather ""if"". Well get vaccine, run serious risk positive...

If let us know want get shot, help out. understand vaccines good people. specific vaccine, one trust. guys keep trying get change mind going happen. 

If listened news last year, would've spent 2020 locked house terrified go fear going die. 

Instead spent hiking camping different parts state. trips met soo many people mindset myself. 

If scared stay home, get vaccine. question it. 

But continue look different venues information, MSM base decisions way. want trust ! want hopeful !

Why misleading ?  Nooooo waaaaaayyyyyyyy  Another reason, also mentioned reply guy replied to, could Romania quite bit bigger netherlands similar sized population.

Just quick google search Romania population density 84 people per km^2 Netherlands population density 508 people per km^2.

More people cramped together means easy virus spread.  is? Another anti vaxxer? Wow that’s real shame used full face mask provided airborne protection breathing eyes vaccinated. use well fitting KF94 N95. Effective masks alone seem prevent infection even better people wearing also source control different extents. Goggles fine extra protection, especially might direct splashes/spitting (close speaking) unless sealed, provide airborne eye protection. might reduce risk, probably day day situations. see people wearing face shields less effective masks really make sense unless there's access issue since better mask alone would effective. people dealing bodily fluid splashes unless sealed really make difference. overly cautious side seemed worked regret it, I'm glad vaccines now. nah newsom made clear days ago use executive powers push cal osha rule change up: Trying convince last third care people one exhausting things life, since done every fucking election cycle. 25m 80m end july. 420m everything rest year. 2 people died company December February Covid (1 ventilator month took him, 1 weekend suddenly). 3 close. 1 currently door assumed make it.

Majority facility still Trump boasting fuckasses think Covid load shit, vaccines (insert claim here), masks nothing. 

Cases rise statewide, citywide, company. 

The company keeps changing rules response incidents. Well sucks.  Isn’t anti-medical science whole? logic start demolishing hospitals since sick fend die can’t handle illnesses. Average population density probably big factor.

Netherlands around 17 million people living around 41k km^2 Romania around 19 million people living 238k km^2. **thousands** deaths reported? ask rabies immune systems work it. virus, right? even said article recently two weeks ago (yet) seeing statistical correlation vaccination rate covid rate dropping. great see data expect too! Lol, right? 1/20th best-case scenario (mNRA, old strains, 95% efficacy), compared unvaccinated people.  J&amp;J, mNRA strains, like 1/4th 1/3rd chance compared unvaccinated.

But, also far contageous flu, ramps percentages up, else equal, would circulating more. always wonder anti-vac folks, weren’t vaccinated kids?! think vaccines different something? seems like good enough point make taking vaccine. flu vaccine you?

and every vaccine ever medicine ever prescribed. 

I bet never even occurred ask long developed/tested.

almost like politicized youre total rube.
you took doctors word it.

weird start questioning development doctors suggest never past. point, deaths anti-vaxxers. They'll never worry vaccines ever again. genius. Yup. true. 33% Dark Triad say. 33% care like normal people do. empathy etc, 33% go either way. “swing” either way. society always focuses “swing” 33%. Also yes

* Also Another California resident I'm getting vaccine mean I'm crazy conspiracy guy. cost benefit developed countries paying vaccines insane. 1000 dollars per dose would still easily make sense. 67-year-old diabetic grandmother cancer refuses get vaccine still believes ""liberal hoax."" friends died virus. enough convince think anything ever will.  people vaccinated, since risk infection severe outcomes much lower. sneaky hell here. 

You trying conflate efficacy overall rates among unvaccinated, try make vaccines look even better (they great, need mislead people).  Anyway answer removed. tldr- feel I’m sorry cut ties. mean yes, yes.
In real note though, I’m happy. working Covid pt’s beginning four floor aren’t bi-pap continuously, heart happy. similar transmission rates though. suggesting COVID less dangerous is. Transmission rates part danger. don’t want take it? Need start order discussion. yep. that's iker casillas, longtime RM gk heart attack 37 training playing porto.

the cameroonian player, already noted, marc vivien foè, passed away 28 heart attack international match.

then there's antonio puerta, sevilla defender died 22 suffering collapse pitch multiple cardiac arrests due hereditary heart disease.

piermario morosini, died 25 cardiac arrest serie b (italian second division) match pescara livorno, weeks muamba's incident.

should also mention davide astori, fiorentina's captain, died sleep night match, 31 years old. Little insensitive. Spare thought a.) People allergic vaccine, would love take it. b.) People compromised immune systems vaccine help, nowhere near 80%+ coverage have. One coworkers ""FloGrown""(says right bumper sticker) whipped phone complex calculation 4x25 day, believe completely! think say efficacy higher variants compared mRNA. UK variant made bulk variants occurring trial, showed similar efficiency mRNA, near 90%. think data establishes statistically significant difference. hand saw UK trial reduced efficiency SA variant, like 60%. There’s sneaking anything. Severe cases required death. Overall death rate 0.5% covid unvaccinated. get point limbo death one needs severe. 

Since need A.B.C. kindergarten style, go. 

If gave 100 people Pfizer vaccine exposed infectious dose covid, 91% would become infected. leaves 9 vaccinated people infected. 

Now 100 unvaccinated people exposed infectious dose virus. infected. 

9 vs 100. 

The trial showed 9 people control, unvaccinated group severe covid. One person vaccinated group did. 

Of nine people left Pfizer group infected, 9x less likely develop severe covid, requirement death, unvaccinated. doesn’t account effect antibodies vaccine. lowers risk even more, we’re even accounting that. 

The 50% symptomatic efficacy bar opinion far high. lower efficacy vaccine give immune system head start virus would still tremendously lower severe cases death rates. exceedingly rare cases one die reinfection initially mild covid case. 

If you’re looking conspiracy/scandal, there’s money therapeutics vaccines, evidenced Merck abandoning IAVI collaborated pill vaccine based platform successfully used Ebola. immune response right natural infection could easiest distribute vaccine world. make vaccines several dollars per course could sell government course therapeutics $1400 each, paid front? Canada closer 40 million though... That’s funny, today reading they’re actually dropping across board. Hahah one favorites!  could easily fabricated liberal lamestream media, duh.  mean “despite”? you’ve never COVID whole point vaccine keep way. YES get it. YES safe. bother mentioning FDA all? point it’s performative anyways. I’m tired weird dance-and-jig Mask-Karens can’t mind damn business. Oh, ffs. media says there's thunderstorm outside, going go swimming tinfoil hat on? 

The difference see storm whereas lack equipment education see variants. make less real. mean UK’s rising numbers among unvaccinated?  read entire article behind paywall. Sorry flu airborne 😉 participated trial glad data looking good grass green fucking way. 

Too bad Biden sending everyone vaccines since February gotten around it. also tracking ground im-plant-ed microchips They're simple set up. Sucking air tube harder people realize. needs big enough suffocate. need valves keep breathing air exhaled. also need make sure helmet fits tightly enough incoming air leaking (or out) bottom helmet.

If know much pathogen might need additional precautions (like filters).

It's doable otherwise come conclusion regular masks sufficient they're much cheaper make tube based breathing system. advice anyone help me. understand vaccines important crucial getting back normal. I'm always flip flopping getting one reason. never go doctors, gotten sick ever really rarely goes away like day. last I've gotten shot chickenpox flu kid. I'm 31 now. would say I'm pretty healthy individual. one ease concerns get it? gotten sort vaccines shots anything thus far. now? Yup. Empathy strength. Lacking empathy weakness. 80% seems high, wonder uptake average flu season. assume much lower. drink bleach. cancer survivor well. didn’t drink kale shakes either get cured. got legit medicine oncologists. saved life. 

But second point, knowing long term covid effects scary it’s amazing dismissive anti vaxxers are. known risks kids seem pretty low. probably higher risk activities kids anyway engage exposed . Literally front page go life oblivious? Lol File shit Sherlock. recently found sister getting ""doesn't feel comfortable it"". moved state years ago talked much since one best friends I'm disappointed angry want ever talk again. uncle died Covid complications months ago, reaction? kind ignorance inexcusable imo live UT, one states lower vaccination rate rise infections. Before, masks still mandatory, significant number people would refuse wear mask wore like chin daiper. Businesses even bother enforcing rules, despite signage. soon mask mandate lifted, mask sight. Sure, still us holdouts put dirty looks, but, general, people eager discard masks. Personally, slim chance fully vaccinated person still transmit covid enough inconvenience minutes mask wearing every day. like firing gun air, unlikely someone get hit falling bullet, impossible consequences devastating. unvaccinated, US (and world) probably dealing remainder 2021. However, certain point, everyone ample time get vaccinated economy longer run deficit, may take leap faith let unvacvinated reap consequences choices. opening/closing restrictions businesses one thing. sick wearing mask fucking juvenile.   majority Japan disagrees - source wife Japanです chance long didn’t listen?  got covid, didn’t get sick. natural immunity took care it. don’t need vaccine. Yes. even similar numbers people around transmitting, still safer vaccinated around covid patients unvaccinated around flu patients. someone healthy discussion vaccine ?
I dont want take it. im demonitized work, private. 

And positive open minded people around not. haven’t gotten flu shot 10 years. never get sick. I’ll stick working eating healthy.  oh wait? Really? weird. Weird works Variants cause news says there’s variants right? owns media? You’re letting perfect enemy good. tens millions unvaccinated people country. risk variants well evades vaccines would disaster.   Anyone loves makeup skincare needs go Besfren. So, gonna another lockdown again? I’ve got backlog Netflix shows games need play. wouldn’t mind another year inside. Ashburn checking here! That's.. true. can't deny it. thrown  debate masks covid. Pick politics stuff throw window going talk besides screaming louder loudly. 

So mask? float country like Japan believe wear face masks sick, need work. (like little sniffles)
- wear masks? wear care coworkers people around them. japan culture revolves us/we me/i.

So lets hope America instance, mask wearing massive culture shock people. personal experience alot reasons get variations “ take chances “
- note word: 

Now lets get mask vs mask off. wearing mask affect lifestyle? work? Health? Talk? Etc?

In reality, minimal differences mask mask off.
Experience;
- volunteered hospital specifically transporting samples. MANDATORY wear mask completely eliminate contamination breath. talk doctors fine, janitors, even patients.

Now
- magically talking inaudible . extremely difficult breathe. uncomfortable 

These essentially two things see comes masks.

Here things remember. choice choice, override policies/rules everything.
- example, customer enter store mask take soon employees around. Offered man mask SEVEN times. literally snapped started attacking employees complaining choice, doesn’t believe etc. response following rules store given create safe environment.
- lets get closer look, man choice wear mask not. employees choice since maintain policy create health safety. man wear madk choice. shirts shoes service? walk store naked freedom choice yes? thinking entering area thst PUBLIC OWN

tldr

the choice make responsible actions take Respect fellow human. guys herd Indian ant, Bzxhrejoobeuriohana1five9-1867 thing 1,000 times spicier previous Indian ants combined.

Literally point? science intimidate something? confused? don’t see go back normal anything less triple masks (plus ear muffs) time soon. mean seriously, worth risk??????

No need masks people vaccinated. feel like youre poking fun recommendation wear 2 masks honestly dont get. virus airborne. simple concept 2 barriers prevent less particles getting 1. Masks social distancing *harm reduction*, cant eliminate issue completely take different steps eliminate much possible. Thats like making fun someone uses higher rated seatbelt one typically found cars. ""Haha look you, trying protect yourself, loser"" &lt;-- thats vibe comment Eh, true MDs know nurse children’s hospital works respiratory wing who’s huge anti-vaxxer telling everyone COVID cold obviously refused vaccine. She’s literally putting children danger. One word: India

To put context, 1918 flu pandemic said 50 million deaths. 12 million estimated India. want clarify Prime Minister UK. President. this? Republicans likely anti-vaxxers remain unvaccinated Democrats. Something interesting noticed...recently Florida Aldi stores signs saying something like ""per CDC guidelines masks required vaccinated individuals"". Well today signs gone back old sign ""masks required people"". Work Ontario RPN, got vaccine, much hesitancy get vaccine PSWs coustodians. That's HOV lanes for, silly billy.

Anyway, calculate maximum number drivers area possibly ever make enough lanes hold cars. whole planet one giant road live work cars. need commuting! Problem solved! - People self-test more, go official test.
- allowed take test symptoms contact positive self-test. I’ve nurse friends Vancouver talk anti-vax nurses work with.

We definitely - maybe extent states, there… amazing news!! thanks. remember reading somewhere experience symptoms vaccine means body done really good job recognising it.  symptoms either shot vaccine sore arm. Brazil B177 identified ages still grow... P.1 dominates 90% so.  

Now, Indian variant already circulating... We'll see manages grow. Came say exact thing. Making sound like viruses plan somehow actively trying outsmart us humans vaccines just… dumb. Thank you. That’s reassuring. 

As said, different municipalities handling things different pace based supply manpower. hope keep together. please ask went vaccine? sick it?  interesting P.1 variant picking steam live gradually faded overtaken B117. know pro-COVID vaccine people simultaneously anti-flu shot. paradoxical. don’t know foolproof way determine someone’s remorse genuine, isn’t point incarceration? US refuses openly discuss effects kids younger 12 there's vaccine option them. Mainstream US news pushes clear agenda kids 12 affected parents better get vaccinated. one seems find odd become taboo highlight concern age group yet eligible. I've heard nurses tripping get vaccinated realized doctors thing. FWIW “rich Potomac” across river Maryland. Potomac Falls, VA nice probably considered well-off overly so. 

(Read: cookie cutter suburbia) people proven capable enough trust people's lives.

This thing.. expectation likely nurses medically trained meaningful fashion. really aren't. average nurse takes incredibly small number anatomy physiologically classes. study disease medical science cursory level. surprise many nurses almost medically illiterate philosophical foundations nursing (IE: ""nursing process"") based actual modern medicine...  latest numbers, albeit days behind, show 23.6 million vaccinations far (mostly first doses), roughly 19–20% Japan's population. (Higher, include adult population.) Vaccination appointments adults supposed open week, although depends bit swift city's vaccination rollout is. Could Indian variant cause another lockdown? Hopefully doesn’t mutate due vaccine use itself.  That’s true keep going end time. already bunch knucklehead friends worried next lockdown “for reason.” love gottlieb really arguing anything, felt like possibility way react news articles studies. know haven’t posted update 4 days jump 10% even close current trajectory.

Also specific reason you’re acting like smart ass people ask questions? Yeah, it’s crazy. I’m also lucky. I’m still able work things enjoy help inhalers fuzzy socks. shaving weeks time release could saved tens hundreds thousands lives.

What could really saved tens thousands lives would america nationalistic AF hoarding vaccine massive quantities even use. That's feel *any* job requires interact public. matter restaurants, retail, call centers - name - worth stress. People suck. UK midst strategy. downplaying risks kids removing data spread schools (currently significant source spread UK) reporting. going well. Cases increased, hospitalizations increased, considering maintaining restrictive measures delaying ""freedom day."" 

With pandemic development, even since beginning, Americans think happen them...... work HIT provide vaccination records, get annual flu shot, annual tb tests. five years, I’ve worked hospital total 4 weeks. coworkers surprised even covid &amp; WFH, flu shot still required last fall. work hospital September 1 vaccination requirement. Well, go got 12% number look current one. source 12%, right? vaccine 100% effective mom immuno-compromised. I'm far alone. want idiots infect turn kill mom anyone else.  leaving 50% population unprotected.

A decent percentage unvaccinated immunity previous infection also. problem don’t know many people wide open whose immunity didn’t take myriad reasons. We’re going find 6 weeks doubling rate. mean eventually virus mutate point able latch cells properly, indeed keep mutating. mutation completely vaccine resistant extremely unlikely since vaccines create antibodies target spike protein, key part virus latches cells. mutation could show theory, live long can't latch onto humans replicate properly. person also suggested, US probably natural immunity, well using primarily mRNA could blunt variant here, hopefully. knew risks... die due Covid ... simple Darwinism. Absolutely sympathy them. Hope infect kill anyone else. words, stop relying case numbers people mild Delta may never get tested. Rely hospitalization numbers track direction pandemic going. escape.

The implicit meaning “escape” statements “escape way render vaccinated immunity useless.” misdemeanor battery, willful injury causing serious injury. Gouging someone's eyes misdemeanor battery. assault assault.

This step beyond assault. convicted willful injury causing serious injury, mainly gouged guys eyes. altercation punches thrown. trying cause serious, long term (if permanent) injury. colleague long covid. got first pfizer shot hopes same. I'm also Canada. Depending province in, depend call then, one type nurses (ON RPN, NS LPN) 2 year college course. RN done 4 years straight high school, 3 years previous credits.

Unlike hear states, nurses work getting covid vaccine keeping pretty solidly downlow, everyone else work with, pretty vocally pro-vax. YMMV, unfortunately exist.  Yeah hate evolution explained mutations purpose.

The reason humans strongly tend think “us vs them” i.e. adversarial conflict terms. Political programs often called “the war against…” use sport cultural replacement battle language follows suit. phenomenon found across cultures times it’s going away. Yea, trying cause serious, possible permanent injury guy. 

Gouging eyes? fuck? way past normal fight. rollercoaster. That’s good news.

Do source check out? Oooh, crazy liberal smarties, responsible stuff... thinking?! Yes Indian buffets back over. Also I've hankering Golden Corral. ""Strep"" Ricky Bobby intent harm combined fact tried offer sentence even come jail time refused. 

This minor scuffle. 10 years tried gouge dude's eye out. believe they’ve wronged anyone? like 20% now. Japan vaccinating million people per day. understood trade-off lower effectiveness earlier availability, realized close better option, we'd definitely chosen differently. trying add another datapoint. sounds like understood trade making. wondering others clearly understood well. millions still eligible US. US still near sequencing cases sufficient enough confidently compare whether theUS pacing slower UK terms rapid (or not) increase cases Delta. 

It help fully vaccinated people increased likelihood infected spreading Delta, still encouraged US get tested even exposed close contact covid positive person. understand right, rich countries like Canada distributing vaccines approved poorer quality developing countries? sure vaccines pose threat people poor countries? believe see lot old people worsen die taking shots correlate vaccine instead age patient looking pandemic. actually seem like sham legit curriculum unlike bootcamps fucker, dont predict future! reasonable. delta variant joke. want get shit, trust me. care young healthy are, fucking brutal. Yeah hate evolution explained mutations purpose.

No bird grow longer beak eat bug. 

The birds grew longer beaks COULD eat bug survived better.

The virus trying thread needle, there's specific mutation happens chance dangerous get vaccinated host millions mutation attempts get infected current version wear inside stores point, requiring, not. feel comfortable way, honestly masks pretty second nature now. beginning felt claustrophobic wearing them. likely people 12 end hospital die variant? Question: reason testing low? I’m looking number tests made, positivity rate 5%. 

Is people don’t go get tested criteria tests strict?

The reason ask saw Belgium’s 7 days average 40.9K/day (positivity rate 2.7%) Netherlands half 55% extra population wondering big difference testing. point naturally occurring artificially induced COVID fighting antibodies prevent future infection. Therefore, anyone natural immunity obviously need vaccine. I'm boat you! believe science vaccine (and thank brilliant scientists doctors every day) hard switch ""oh-god-their-mask-is-down-I'm-gonna-die"" reflex. I'm definitely much better hand washing hand, also I'm much aware anyone around showing anything vaguely resembling symptoms, think that's stay.

Work also permanently moving 3-day office work week end year, fully remote now, 5 days office occasional remote work asked nicely. I'm curious ears. tell Spanish Europe?  add, vaccines likely keep hospital even test positive/develop symptoms. isn’t true. Stop spreading misinformation  boat in, Pfizer Moderna hard get J&amp;J first offered us due BMI. took thinking 'better' shots available summer. widely available three weeks later, still kicking slightly, feel less safe J&amp;J, still, would rather gotten 2-shot. Nurses also support staff  That's interesting good know!

I hope personifying virus actively trying create mutations going scare people know. Evolution, mutation crucial factor, often called ""blind watchmaker"", building upon random stuff reproduces well. Hopefully isn’t ulcer. 

I chest pain years back honestly thought dying heart attack. Long story short, panic disorder. (I great deal stress anxiety time.) Tweaked anxiety meds talked therapist. I’d like say it’s fixed, still get panic attacks occasionally.  Weird, it’s almost like, science something. Well done part. lockdowns happen again, control. least safe. Last checked, getting Covid provide nearly much protection (antibody levels) vaccines 2 shots particular. masks vaccinated people. interesting see enforce mask wearing among 12 crowd makes big part audience. would quite bummer kids wear masks Disneyland everyone else goes without. anyone actually read article? (This reddit probably not)

Employers schools right require vaccination. Travel might restricted unvaccinated people. part living society offers ability enjoy success freedoms appear hold dear. still blocked anti-ad-block scripting; nevermind, site's trash fire. Thanks trying, though.  Texas removed restrictions months ago vaccination rates single digits even didn’t spike. spike unlikely near impossible vaccination rates   Discussion here, someone asked similar  changing Delta strain, bad idea. 

What part understand?  currently evidence necessary. sure red herring like asked defending J&amp;J shot Pfizer (which took.) 

If you’re making claim asymptomatic cases leads death, sounds reasonable completely ignore disease progression works. simply isn’t case. 

If one 91% protected symptoms disease know 0.5% unvaccinated Americans die infected virus regardless symptoms(600k/115m est. infections), 0.5% 9% closer 0% 1%, at-worst value. becomes significantly smaller factor deaths come severe cases asymptomatic individuals. factor antibody data recovered covid patients vaccinated, case becomes even stronger.

Companies could tell phase 1/2 wouldn’t make mark outright bailed (Merck x2). added archive link article previous reply. seems like important study, straight Lancet: study traced almost 20,000 positive cases Scotland since April, including 100 hospitalizations Alpha Delta. found higher risk hosptialization, delay first-dose vaccine effectiveness 4 weeks Delta, significant reduction effect full vaccine dose Delta (92%-79% Pfizer). already explained free life definition better one restricted life, always. Nobody said aspects better everyone, overall life better simply free. clear read original comment. surprised anyone arguing simple point, cause doesn’t value freedom anything else? health course.
I think simply misunderstood original comment.  UK enters chat even created Academy that. Considering infectious disease we’ve eradicated Smallpox, think always dominant strain. best won’t major concern. know chickenpox strain dominant?  Perfectly balanced, things be. People desperate take masks. Safe excuse works. believe science don’t trust liars lie. Pfizer vaccine less effective Delta variant, especially one new study Public Health England showed two doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 88% effective symptomatic disease Delta variant compared 93% effectiveness Alpha variant, variant first detected U.K. vaccine provided 33% protection one also cases severe illness death delta variant fully vaccinated 42 deaths recorded England within 28 days positive test involving Delta variant, 23 unvaccinated people, 12 among fully know studies vaccines Go on? understand. ....CA going give away trucks, maybe even get last holdouts. think people saying children ""strep"" without seeing doctor. Many ""cases"" probably strep. Umm get shit?  grandpa taken it, aunt lives taken it, they're house they've always lived Louisiana.

He old enough go war Korea, guess old enough live though Polio firsthand think pretty explicit said ""for poor countries""

yeah trying make point said... explicitly said ""in US""... made sense

what country from? idiot better brainwashed? assume people got hit hard vaccine probably going get hit hard real virus too. me, 2 day headache. things use example capitalism, chose vaccine? There's one else would rather controlling vaccine private experts field. would rather government?? I'm ignorant topic please inform would prefer it.  huh interesting. def intense moment / weeks anxiety, low none. going see psych. think case zoloft may bit much, I'm wondering xanax need cant break anxious circle thinking over. Vaccine ain't thing sketchy medication. trying argue you. catching vaccine?

And articles Delta strain danger. I'm specifically talking correct policy given Delta strain. Notice that, study linked to, ran simulations first dose efficacy low Delta simulation replications, median cumulative mortality per 100 000 standard dosing versus delayed second dose 226 v 179, 233 v 207, 235 v 236 90%, 80%, 70% first dose efficacy, respectively. **The delayed second dose strategy optimal vaccine efficacies 80%**

The break even point delayed dose 70%, according source. 

the efficacy first dose 33% Delta strain. proven point, thank you.  global news looking better better day least developed semi developed countries. Hopefully production ramp get start getting vaccines impoverished countries. 5m Pfizer/BioNTech doses expected Q3, compare 2.4m June 5.7m entirety Q2. Thus, deliveries expected decrease according prognosis.

On hand Moderna supposed increase deliveries significantly 3m expected Q3, compare 350k June 700k Q2. That’s true. I’m 36 years old I’ve never witness stuff like that. appreciate story that’s nuts.  Guardian's analysis dumb. FDAs decision hardly likely based social justice. important differences outcomes etc US ethnic group primarily *caused* ethnic difference social factors associated ethnicity ala racist medical treatment, healthcare access, mistrust based history, chronic disease associated inequality etc. Governments medical bodies zero interest kind information going public. Even minor differences would result thousands cancellations people would demand different vaccine, etc., would delay whole vaccination programme. 42.4% eligible people. 42.4% entire population. 

We'll see happens move forward. think areas US high enough immunity avoid significant spikes time delta variant becomes widespread enough. areas they'll likely take hit.  Interested one they're pulling headline claim from, mind. mention Corralation equal Causation. 2000 people died vaccinated, exclusively vaccinated. small number deaths result vaccines, people died car crash (for example) happened vaccinated included 2000 number.

Sorry, true everyone every metric. I, one, agree baseketball. happy gotten work home entirety last year. heart goes everyone lost job, lost loved one, lost anything valued pre-pandemic life. one saying they're happy pandemic happened applies everyone. user saying hey one metric life actually improved therefore (the original comment author replied to) incorrect say across board pre covid lives better every metric. Sounds like looking something upset over. Yes, damn good. came comments one. Thanks quick info! Hopefully drop dead immune response matures breadth cover time time doses short much maturation.  imagine point figure anyone dumb enough get vaccine opportunities deserves get. *Shocked Pikachu face* Interviewed prospective nanny yesterday. great person, going ask come meet girls, asked formality she’s vaccinated (our town like 70% rate among adults figured course caretaker), answer “I take vaccine.” Like holy shit wtf. authoritarian personality certain requirements must met, include existence ""other"" (us vs them) real perceived persecution. That’s round unvaccinated, tie down, give jab. NJ’s vaccine numbers went today I’m reporting cause data whack clearly. Best thing Learned, since finding water wet grass green weird. gave pharmacist insurance card said copay cash price. maybe got ripped Boris Johnson said ""confident"" delay would need longer four weeks.

""Just four weeks flatten curve"" find surprising, lose mind hear wet water found!  get link study data pulled from? wife felt like absolute shit 12 hours got second pfizer vaccine. Fever, extreme body pains, etc. lasted maybe 6 hours felt fine again. logical person would realize body immune response, anti-vaxxers logical people. No, understood point. ignored mine. stats actually back one point other. stats back other. essentially saying ""well says B lying B says lying,"" Except documented proof happened, know lying. can't say ""people make arguments bad faith using statistics, therefore nobody use statistics.""

Almost like simply time accept virus' existence get back life normally lol. widespread vaccine then. clarify it’s touch comment read major, non controversial political sub, also upvotes. OP since downvoted oblivion comment. True, time we’ve careful perpetuate information absolute truth. People tend distinguish proper studies speculative stuff. Even though latter may eventually turn true, many times not. read headline. meantime, people think it’s scientific fact could let guard wear masks / get vaccinated prior infection.

It difficult make everyone think rationally, especially lockdown fatigue set in. People cling every ray hope. So, said, I’m cautiously optimistic this, would like people continue exercise amount caution earlier till studied further. hmm hear 3rd wave news I've hoping for. get info? would love see statistics able find anything except studies mentioned article.
 example, ""Britain’s Office National Statistics reported numbers last month took doctors surprise. Among children younger 11 confirmed positive tests, 13 percent least one symptom five weeks infection."" Right now, link referencing one things find. would love see info larger sample sizes less reliance self report without follow up.

Your numbers literally agree said. Yeah there's anti vaxxers among republicans, 29% still lot among dems. US adult wants vaccinated be.

ALSO, Cleveland Clinics employees study. promise required wear mask work likely take precautions. never got COVID, based study unvaccinated people never got COVID don’t need vaccine several know never got it.

Had repost auto mod fucking stupid. Fwiw seemingly worldwide mandate applied Australia much anywhere - masks they'd hand door. matter 300+ days since last case community, multinationals too.

But expect continue follow US, regardless what's going anywhere else world. Yes according CDC ran 17k tests yesterday 174 positive. That's positivity rate 1%. understand death rate high, hand, severely undercounting positivity rate higher well. 

The number positive cases, positivity rate, number deaths line up, I'm sure why. Lockdowns made Australia New Zealand places back normal life.

Because actually acted took seriously.

The English lockdown eat help out, go work, travel, fly anywhere want types lockdown work. lockdowns. Pfizer Moderna, patient vaccinated January Feb. 4th wave. over. mean data represtative sample, reputable prestigious center excellence?

Agreed, scientific research purposes, studies done reinforce findings, I'm sorry, legitimate study worthy consideration approach. Bruh grandma got cold December Toronto lockdown. Still trying figure possible since lives alone. nice 2 day scare family. really offer Johnson Johnson vaccine unvaccinated athletes arrive (that vaccine common among pro athletes US interferes less training schedules) since many athletes coming countries offering vaccines yet. examples 25% tips lol NO! rains time cold.  snowing. burning. 

Don't move here. That’s half people found delta variant particular hospital. That’s half every fully vaxxed Individual exposed delta variant.

Apparently, delta variant lot harder detect ones aren’t entirely sure much really permeated Canada. It’s definitely rise tho. Whatever dude. Sorry you’re mad can’t accept you’re wrong. piece shit truedope is. Focus Canada first moron, give away.


If brain read questioning why. prime minister can't force regulatory agency approve vaccine candidates. better donate unused vaccine completely different Canadians vaccinated (mRNA &amp; AZ) else expire Canada throw out. No, it’s cool. lied. That’s people do. lie Internet forums assuming folks won’t check work.

It’s lazy stupid. It’s low effort. long you’re entertained think you’re good job, guess it’s cool. sad. Damn. yet, give week people show signs. Lmao pregnant doctors office would covid questionnaire appointment. “Do shortness breath” uh yeah???? Literally every symptom matched pregnancy symptoms  jealous people able avoid seasonal allergies masks. would need freaking goggles age well one said - data prestigious clinic! Regardless, definitely something be, minimum, part dialgoue. Medical education (in US least) ability ruin perfectly fine well adjusted person. It’s fairly inhumane.  Incredible ! 3 4 kids got school. One college. 2 high school, got athletics program. Masks required school athletics take certain circumstances. believe spring athletics program got lax. Lots kids got it. Btw three got sick (this spring). poor.

If middle income higher, empirically Florida great place be. That's one fastest growing states country. need segregate attributes shitty governance.

Florida state income tax, great air quality, warm environment, good power infrastructure (those CA TX understand matters), fresh local produce year-round, 2nd cheapest state universities country, lower cost living comparably developed states. Sad place, riddled crime poverty AZ - 12 weeks shots.

And others supply, either. born there! makes proud! GO FAIRFAX!!!! Supposedly India I’ll take private keys. Send over.  Finally, someone said it. know Delta?  one [nurses? ]( ) Says preliminary findings one clinic. I've tinnitus three months now, following second vaccine.

Vaccine rates low masks rarely worn. city suburb tourists care, still come. happen know vaccine? Trust another aus state go lockdwon two months go without quarantine take “Covid-tested” flight, meaning everyone board takes:
-PCR test within three (?) days departure
-Rapid test airport
-Rapid test arrival
-rapid test return flight (this serves US entry test well)

All PCR test sponsored airline/airport, simply arrive early you’re tested. chose Delta process smooth, get airports ~4 hrs early. Delta flies ATL JFK, American United hubs.

Amalfi quiet, sad. It’s wonderful time visit wish luck. Maybe vaccination enough enter. number one thing make spin vaccines massive quantities future pandemics even faster next time. vaccines released US Europe entering worst wave, shaving weeks time release could saved tens hundreds thousands lives.

Focusing coronaviruses particular good angle, since they’ve struck three times recent decades: SARS, MERS, SARS-Cov2. Also, need maintain manufacturing baseline new virus tech. mRNA adenovirus platforms easily modified, e.g. bunch yearly flu vaccines based mRNA, easy pivot manufacturing mass quantities vaccines next pandemic wherever comes from.

And still need think balancing risk regulatory approach. we’ve proven efficacy, really make sense require two months safety data know letting disease run brings certainty deaths? Yeah I'm sure people STILL complaining. cases start spike lot gladly eat hat, think pandemic's mostly bag US. 

I'll wear mask asked to, otherwise completely ending restrictions unless there's reason bring back. think agree hoping happen! wonder different states count unemployment benefits stringintly.... wait ones cut $300 fed support unemployment beenefits. hunh been, get tested.

Thanks, Sodexo /s What's happening UK happen US soon That's Rt value 6 would mean, average infected person transmitting 6 others.

The original strain virus took mitigations like masks, etc. measured around Rt value 3 (by studying outbreaks cruise ships time). measures far delta infectious alpha already infectious original strain. reason delta Rt = 6 mitigations. vaccinated, wearing masks, socially distanced, etc. significantly drive Rt though. Uh... Typo? said ""the vaccine infecting"" got rid smallpox, happen covid people actually they're supposed to. Bring Mexico plz k thx Delta ripping unvaccinated people, young old. variant impacts young. seeing young people get hit young people around world unvaccinated vs. older people (especially countries like UK prioritized older folks vaccines first).

If vaccinated, vulnerable period.  I've never seen can't imagine purpose.

I seen aluminum keys. light anodized color. definitely magnetic! know UK travellers, need evidence two jabs enter Greece.

You right pretty cringe. Yeah, stuff like take pandemics seriously. Vaccines masks mean easily get low levels virus. outlined low level virus is. Australia barely vaccinated 20% population achieved this. There’s actually many regions globe (not countries regions within countries) effectively eliminated spread, states dropped mask mandates settings expect business keep unilaterally. Many people longer carrying masks stores mask mandates start lose foot traffic. Whoever still hasn’t gotten jab didnt want one begin with

That's straight lie. People 12 cannot get vaccine still. Rio de Janeiro citizen, confirm said.

This event fucked up. mean dont know youre expecting happen lol joke point valid? I’m confused must read much Reddits. That's works practice though. innocent person could easily faced choice, agree 2 years probation face 10 years prison. They'd equally stupid risk trial. create incentives strong people agree plea, we've thrown ""innocent proven guilty"" window.

This guy guilty, piece crap, deserved 2 years probation, deserved anyway, refusing take plea. People punished brining case trial, even they're guilty. someone guilty, prosecution prove it, threaten confessing. prosecution needs someone guilty, accidentally lock innocent people.  effects adults getting vaccine slightly change lives children. want argue that, please bring evidence.

Nah, I'm saying fire extinguishers getting fire extinguishers others. case vaccine, already fire extinguishers, costs lot money get fire extinguishers others also huge spending problem. feel like different everywhere. doctors office going immediately test covid went cold/sinus infection/ear infection last week. told already gone day fever started tested negative. despite fully vaxxed. go lot doctors appointments (yay underlying health issues), get covid screening questions asked every one. still take temperature door. still get covid test medical procedure last month too, despite vaxxed. 

I'm NC, like bluest part NC doctors part major hospital systems, could also difference. 

Community testing centers somewhat shut here, still around. sub 1% positivity rate county though months mostly due high number tests (its closer 4% surrounding counties testing less).

Haha, thanks. copied dashboard, holds pretty good amount information toontje analysis. week truly fantastic comes vaccinations Netherlands.

This might peak week. Vaccinations trends tend follow deliveries. probably stay around current rate bit lower coming weeks. mRNA vaccines used (1 - 1.15 million per week). Janssen vaccines used well voluntarily (assume enough demand, lot people want fully vaccinated ASAP). quite second doses AstraZeneca, means still quite bit AZ vaccinations coming weeks.

It great summer, hopefully delta variant create massive problems stays low level bit longer. let's hope well prepared new COVID-19 winter season high vaccination grade decisive quick actions taken needed curb new waves (probably happen, haha, one hope). think CDC consider vaccine passports?

We might able get booster end year whether necessary not. believe read Moderna AZ/Oxford saying may ready fall.  Definitely fourth wave incoming. Get vaccinated weather storm, people. Gonna get real ugly real soon.  tell experience, cop shows fucked government is. There's 150 different viruses cause common cold, including least 4 different coronaviruses, likely ever 1 vaccine.  10% low, guess low vaccination rate reached herd immunity threshold alpha. Delta make worse. guess missed word tourism article…

Just someone something living doesn’t mean correct. link UCLA study doesn’t link anything centers home page. idea considered. get behind too. sure forgot something important. I’m Japan. Unfortunately vaccine rollout horrendous. 

Granted picking pace. 12% population received single Upgrade mass testing tracing capacity !!! Downvote system merits. Nonsensical babble disappears. Excellent work Fairfax County VA! 👍🏼 loved Europe didn’t expect tip could leave euros would moon.  seemed reasonable.  Felt like clean “thank you” “if don’t person starve” Also county! Thank getting vaccine! fiance got second dose yesterday! near anyone else. C'est swag Proof coverup? lot talk UK variant becoming dominant strain February too. ""Dominant strain"" mean ""resurgent strain"". It'll one infecting people time, still infecting nearly many December strain. imagine we'll see bump new cases still anything hospital systems can't handle. keep pushing vaccination message. lot room debate point, agree ever spot mandate w/o exception, would EUA pandemic healthcare settings, HAIs constant risk patients. county! I'm happy hear this. fiance covid back November vaccinated. There’s ton bootcamps around. great experience Tech Elevator, tons interview prep, resume stuff well obviously insanely intense academic part. national remote cohort, you’re USA. Nearly classmates gotten great jobs - never still vouch program clearly works good experience.  live anyone else, get you? comments fellow Americans say mind tipping 20%. feel bad even give little less. ingrained. However, paying infrastructure universal healthcare much. one care effects anti-vaxxers absolutely sounds rough! Well, least able get now! Lots people last name also common first name without total jerks.  Look could better, could also worse. someone Trump president would automatically meant less deaths. 
 

1- forget Cuomo's decision send covid patients back nursing homes early pandemic hiding number dead nursing home patients. 
2- DeBlasio selling ventilators/PPE stockpiled Bloomberg. 
3- Pelosi telling Chinese New Year reverlers go celebrate. 

Could worse, could better. US deaths/million similar middle pack EU countries: UK, Italy, Belgium, UK, Spain, France, Portugal.

What prepare better next pandemic: 

1- Localize PPE production countries 
2- Incentivize business sick leave 
3- Encourage wearing masks winter 
4- Update vaccine manufacturing facilities

Those many things likely need do. Lol, it’s lie, stats cite back statement up. lie. half unvaccinated respondents Republicans (49% versus 29% Democrats), opposed 31% vaccinated respondents identified Republicans 59% also discrepancies unvaccinated respondents said would “definitely not” get vaccine plan “wait see”: “definitely not” group overwhelmingly white (70% respondents), Republican (67%) concentrated 30-49 age group Republicans politicized virus response. Q contingent anti-mask, anti-vax, anti-shutdown. 

This sides thing. Yes, get back. I've unfriended least 3 friends facebook last year. Coincidentally, brainwashed Albertans. deep end. Full Trump supporting, covid denying, Q folk. 

People ability think critically.  educated so, self-interested so. shitty equity equality world, blame people hating status quo difficulty finding truth... status quo sure seem side average person. why? can't true literally admitted patient hospital area newly tested positive COVID. area though? admitted there. Still seeing COVID far in-between still good here. die, GPUs? ever get sense smell back?  People aren’t another lockdown. Also, necessary vaccines. I’ve known people got didn’t really leave house didn’t see anyone. got one day idea how. Oh mean cold hungry thinking flautas :( guess none friends countries opted elimination instead mitigation? Compare states like half-measures extended restrictions needlessly lost lives. watched people enjoyed normalcy, cases 8 straight months local transmission, people Government hard work eliminate local transmission establish quarantine entering country. excuses far greater resources disposal too.

Civil liberties economy excuses firm measures like lockdowns yet hindsight, would small price pay long term dividends.

From Lancet suggests countries opt rapid action eliminate SARS-CoV-2—with strong support inhabitants—also better protect economies minimise restrictions civil liberties compared strive mitigation. Looking ahead, mass COVID-19 vaccination key returning usual life, relying solely COVID-19 vaccines control pandemic risky due uneven roll-out uptake, time-limited immunity, emergence new SARS-CoV-2 variants. History shows vaccination alone neither single-handedly rapidly control virus combination public health measures needed containment.

&amp;#x200B;

This [a epidemiologist follow UK starting see wave new cases due Delta quickly growing need remember evolution virus likely end here. one biggest dangers letting transmission continue high levels. Even result level deaths before, result long COVID &amp; virus mutation.  allowing virus mutations continue high rates virus replicates, alongside vaccination recipe disaster - favourable condition selection towards escape. enough surveil virus adaptation- \*must\* prevent it.  doubt delta change shape pandemic UK, possibly across globe, given level fitness. really negligent govt allow country, &amp; little prevent spread.

I hate lockdowns would hate even wait new generation vaccines. Fool shame you, fool twice shame me. wrong relevant 🤣 flauted

Do mean ""flouted""? 35% Ontario. 15% 5-6 days ago. pace variant moves unprecedented. much faster B117. seriously concerning. think could move fast. need lunch buffet back Indian restaurant street I’ll happy Me, who’s fully vaccinated sore throat followed runny nose past days/week, sitting like: 👁👄👁 Keep going, COVID also turned life around (even didnt experience myself) gotta keep head high. 👍 Pizza!? that's call  Oh, gets better! densely populated areas Brazil Equator entering winter pretty soon...  Amazing!!!  Yep, 538 interesting data showed economic downturn America even prior government response.   ever springfield, pho saigon oi better 99% restaurants eden center, also cheaper. 

thanh son tofu #1 quick takeaway snack foods dessert, tofu soybean milk though. shop far busiest entire eden center. They're bored Gosh, still VaRiAnTssSs arguments? Get fuck it. going happen. thing Florida going beaches. Besides Florida sucks talking American Christianity though. Nothing pope bible. got monoclonal antibodies second infection. wait 90 days infusion get vaccine. I’m eligible June 30th. July 9th appt first shot. 

The reason it’s late (I got first vaccine 3/10/21; got sick 3/25) originally making people wait 90 days infection (my first 11/30/20) originally supposed wait 3/1/21 first vaccine; week scheduled get first shot lifted requirement. 

And one coming first shot (again!) it’s long since one. 

It’s confusing months, say least It’s proportional response. Infections total UK deaths today 8, deaths lag infections doesn’t seem happening yet. wait see approach nobody quite sure happen. Lol really thought would never, ever come back. wrong disagree CDCs policy, enforcing it. teeth would effective. Lmao offense, eligible RN?  Since G7 leaders including Biden seen barbecue, masks, social distancing, safely say measures longer required. Honestly tell you. know 70+ got Pfizer, iirc offering Pfizer sub 40s. 100millin ordered. Numbers slowed vaccinations. well correlated.

If faith restrictions keep infection rates increasing incrementally, increase restrictions stop increasing entirely, even causing decrease? general tests COVID can't tell strain infecting person, positive not. know strain is, sequence viral genome, small number patients viruses sequenced. Florida lenient shortest restrictions economy great. Noticed yesterday. Hilarious, true! send someone back time stop thing? don’t want live dystopian permie-pandemic world  said 870mil doses article G7 UK president said 1 billion quotation...

So 435mil fully vacc people 2022? happen others? Almost like reality left leaning bias something. Crazy.  Yep, nyc, could walk pharmacy, hospital, clinic, etc get covid vaccine without wait all.  see lot of, “if it’s great vaccine would need bribe people?” idiots.  Yeah man, considered it. mentioned explicitly. know living, living. think bringing anything already looked at. Yep - Eden Center, anyone? Man love place… excerpt article: “That backed data. According report, since start February 7 June, 33,206 Delta cases England: 19,573 unvaccinated individuals, 1,785 among fully vaccinated people 7,559 among received one jab, vaccination status remainder unclear.
In total, 383 people England admitted hospital Delta variant period – 223 tested positive Covid turning A&amp;E – 42 two doses jab, 86 one dose 251 unvaccinated.
Of 42 deaths recorded England within 28 days positive test involving Delta variant, 23 unvaccinated people, 12 among fully vaccinated seven among people one dose.”

Basically, efficacy rates hold studies (about 88-90%)in completely avoiding delta-covid. 

Also, 12 deaths way low sample size draw conclusions vaccines effectiveness death vs delta variant. clinical studies much better source controlled factors (ie ages, comorbidities among 12
vaccinated deaths)?

I think Pfizer like 2 weeks maybe symptomatic they're going get tested like get vaccinated go back periodically test like think would done little bit relaxed that. SIL works hospital Montreal. said hospital works, many nurses taking vaccine.

Hospital admin. told staffs either take vaccine submit negative COVID test result 3x per week.

I guess see resolve.

Hospital wife works (SE PA - suburb Philly), mandated staffs take vaccine. literally makes sense. virus going ahead us isn't. thing fight ""the best we've got"" time win. Think many variants concern already encountered. basic mathematical equation several variables. may able get 100% efficacious vaccine ever, vaccinate many people can. Even slightly lesser efficacy. ""Slowing down"" put it, absolutely last thing afford. race virus spreading. Anti-vaxxers seem incapable weighing vaccination vs infection. it’s free perfect, willing risk infection. Profession doesn’t seem change that. Perpetual lockdown? Right go see friends family, restaurants open, shops open, pubs open people watching footy 

We’re LOCKDOWN ffs Yes, graphs quite clear.

Understandable comes concerns regarding infection vectors, gives wrong idea title. judge literally said exact opposite. I'm saying agree mindset also live pretty different lifestyle people want get back regular life. Yeah thats pushing real estate prices places like Fairfax Loudon Co decades. People make good money decide live DC / Arlington more.

*You mean get single family home 1/8 acre land $699k? decent schools? Sign f up.*

That's wild thing Fairfax Co. There's little county warrants expensiveness... proximity places *even expensive*. accurate. spent first five years making $20-21/hrs (in 3 different states) started travelling.

NYC nurses start like ~50 private hospitals. issue, teacher, really burnt out. However teachers NYC suburbs making 6 figures years. would super hard quit now, sucks, stressful. We're fairly sure got Nov, Dec 2019 flying back Japan Poland via Israel Germany. get tested february even thought ""ohhhhh that's worst flu lives"". 

Getting tested realised Montreal would mean hanging people thought actively wrong? Needless exposure vs beer apartment :)

Training since then, even basic bike rides embarrassingly bad. Max VO2 measurements 3 years back gym opens want go compare.

However got pfizer double difference noticeable. bought new bike! That’s fair, say people would get sick people would die Yep sounds right Arlington. Wow.

Who would guessed? picked data. anxiety meds now? Im curious. deaths UK single digits month now.

Daily new cases increased last couple weeks, nothing compared earlier surge. mainly unvaccinated young people. said Taiwan reduced CT value (cycle threshold) 30. value usually 37-40 countries. means harder test positive Taiwan. 

Is true? that?  Imagine December. definitely seasonality this. Decent results, sequencing breakdown shows vaccine 100% effective factoring non-VOC/VOI cases (ie landscape mRNA vaccines evaluated under, b117, P1 et al took hold) 

Has favorable reactogenity, ""traditional"" addition help general wrt global immunization might attract folks options previously held newer tech vaccines (both viral vector mRNA relatively speaking new vaccine tech)  think cases reporting problem, know fact co-workers got vaccinated (we went together) one third never reported vaccination human resource department, due email mishaps issues. hospital can't access vaccination status without self-reporting. unit 100% vaccinated, reported number much lower, local news completely ignored fact reported rates ≠ real rates. thing Fairfax whole county even include major urban areas uniformly super expensive. sprawl sprawl sprawl DC white people decided live. Kinda like Bethesda Loudon County whatever. 

Super lucky grow there, course, man expensive place live relative actually county. going ""no masks required"" extra steps. 

Cal OSHA newest part save face get overruled executive order Newsom last mask order, something power do. Clearly wants businesses able operate maskless wish. NK likely turn SK offer solely spite point excuse mostly seems hospitals able require vaccine fully FDA approved, i.e. emergency use authorization. (Note: agree think BS.)

So far know EEOC said ok employers require, think case. thread doesnt make feel exactly Great.. know present ""in tiny amounts"" February? Community transmission UK confirmed early March, almost certainly simply ""tiny amounts"".

I guess technically correct, however, Canada actually **73%** eligible (age 12+) first dose 64% total population. 

Also, provinces moving second doses increasing almost 1% everyday (and still accelerating). Unless kid ages 2-11, pre-existing condition leads believe still significant risk post-vaccine, and/or work job like healthcare requires close contact infected people, likely nothing worry about. nature lockdown restrictions affects others (middle aged families least everyone else more, general rule thumb). current ones still affect quite bit, I'd say. I'd rather able go meetups walk store eat inside restaurant. Netflix documentary called social dilemma talks this. listen episode Sam's podcast Eric guest. Twitter back forth too, afterwards.

It's Twitter stuff refer. told vaccine resistant friend would happen surprised. I’m still pretty bitter upsetting conversation. discourage people getting vaccine, ""100% effective"" means severe cases vaccine group trial. Even 30,000 participants trial (I think 2/3s vaccine group?), 14 total COVID cases vaccine group. 

If trial size larger, like millions doses given real-world vaccine deployment, likely would people getting severe cases dying fully vaccinated. chances miniscule vaccine, trial powerful enough detect it. “100% efficacy clinical trial” simply means “in clinical trial, didn’t see anyone affected”. doesn’t mean can’t happen - means didn’t happen anyone trial strongly implies event rare. thing countries need FDA approval requirement buying vaccines. home country skeptical towards vaccines like Chinese vaccine FDA approval. downvoted? lol What’s happening Colorado though? know idea even started, lot teachers wife works concern. tested variants live trial Pfizer/Moderna not. UK trial NVAX showed 96.4% efficacy original Wuhan strain larger trial showed 100% efficacy original strain, likely 98%+ zone comparing apples apples two 95 94% respectively. 

This study also shows incredible protection age comorbidity groups strains cross strain protection means alter formula broad protection time (until newer breakthrough variants come start happening). animal testing flu vax covid vaccine shown produce high C19 flu strain antibodies result NVAX big booster winner global scale go forward (although mixing two likely go sort safety trial may take added time).

[What Expect getting Covid-19 Vaccination effects typically expected far days getting jabbed. 

Outliers exist exception rather rule. please normalize current restrictions. ""hardly anything"" somehow still prevents getting know people new city every group activity hobby cancelled. enjoy explaining simple implied concepts reason, too.

Did know truly make apple pie scratch, first create universe?  No, get vaccinated vaccine acquired immunity often stronger/longer lasting disease acquired immunity. Especially given excellent immune response results major covid vaccines. catch covid second time. It’s like myth chicken pox getting done kid - despite people say certainly catch Yea, matter much. tells numbers UK. impacts pandemic dwarf potential impact random coincidence. Let's take deaths look those. 2020, right 1% US population died. lot higher usual, we'll use 1% per year this. CDC estimated 35% US population infected covid point pandemic. We'll use worst case scenario people suggested - ""anyone dies within 30 days testing positive counted covid death matter died of"" - accurate helps us establish ceiling potential impact.

So, 332 million people times 35% infected times 1% per year divided 12 get people dying within month equals 97 thousand people. That's WORST CASE many people could coincidentally die within month covid wrongly counted covid death. recorded 600,000 deaths US. absolute worst case recording errors, we've still half million people die covid. wonder generally become non-infectious despite staying positive, might ""flare ups"" become contagious again, like viruses.

This necessarily bad sounds could medical management prevent ""flare ups."" multiple studies Spain UK showing mixing matching safe. speculation (with studies conducted) mixing matching may actually better gives immune system two separate 'looks' covid. analogy one scientist used like getting front view side view mugshot. vaccine uses synthetic spike protein mixed substance stimulate immune system attack proteins. 

The mRNA vaccines instruct cells make spike protein. immune system attacks proteins. 

Basically, vaccine offloads hard work making spike protein giant bioreactors instead instructing body make them. think it’s important note efficacy better understood “efficacy trial” rather “efficacy vaccine”. sufficiently large sample size distinction becomes less meaningful dominant strains, can’t understand much efficacy vaccine original strain it’s replaced contagious variants. 

But answer question yes, researchers intentionally exposing people different variants see well avoid infection best really see compare unvaccinated people wild. brilliant scientist hypothesis happening? can’t come anything! (But seriously, add long growing list data confirm vaccines working, good news always welcome).   nah we're roaring 20s, people know partying hard comes covid covid vaccines, seems norm extrapolate forever (stated kind certainty normally think based actually knowing) despite us knowing nothing really long-term (we make reasonable guesses, simply *know* yet). think based high levels emotion efforts persuasion anything.

I've seen autopsied lungs definitely never going bounce back - even really ""lungs"" anymore. rest it, wish people would couch ""probably"" ""evidence similar things suggest"" etc. terms. still protects. Good know. Hmmmm yes floor made floor   Quick! Someone comment ""It's almost *vaccines work*""

It's gotta every thread! wants say time? no, get brand new Delta infection every week Still better comparing people plague rats. line thinking leads one place Ask 500k+ Americans died last year, many thousands long term symptoms, natural immune systems worked. Nevermind  think vaccine market here. side-effects allegedly far mild mRNA vaccines. hard work producing proteins offloaded insect cells bioreactor instead body.

It’s also traditional vaccine, many people skeptical mRNA vaccines go one. could account strange phenomenon? fully vaccinated, good. masking social distancing all, completely throwing caution wind? new variants rise, hard someone like catch it. Yep skipped zero vax/population daily percentage, thanks catching edit. Either way, significant daily frequency purely coincidental deaths within days vaccination. SHOCKED people rejecting it.

Propaganda helluva drug. vaccinated people still would better people vaccinated lower case rates. 

Remember efficacy comparison vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. 90% efficacy, 10 unvaccinated people would get symptomatic COVID, instead 1 vaccinated person would.  something like J&amp;J delta variant, could closer 2:1 (3:1 even old strain). 

So even vaccinated people care local case rates. So, follow someone high school social media giant anti-vaccine, anti-mask proponent wild window world me. sells shirts right say ""immune system: ON, masks: OFF"" really entertaining vaccinated person!

I tried post general ideas more, automod keeps removing it. Canada used example good response covid 19. fact alone mix match vaccines Canada makes question wtf smoking feel kind misled headline. hoping legit good news looked like long covid temporary thing, large.

At time known case get feeling different groups people lumped ""long covid"" people definitely going ""miracle recovery"" point (e.g., someone badly scarred lungs), might.  bad Sam Harris able set straight again.

I understand? logic correct, think numbers off. 10,000 deaths per day, 1 million vaccinations per day, means 1 every 330 people vaccinated every day, expect 10,000 / 330 = 30 deaths exactly 3 days shot, 210 within week vaccination. right. Despite overwhelming evidence contrary. millions people died India, Brazil, Spain, Italy, etc. showed incredible commitment altering results US Election. Get vaccinated nonissue.

No matter whether tested positive not, vaccine helps protect health--helps protect getting sick COVID-19 future. people get ill getting covid, others not. virus spread quickly, we've seen people US around world become sick cases, died. 

This vaccine 1) helps reduce chances becoming severely ill. fully vaccinated person get symptoms COVID, likely mild compared unvaccinated person. Right now, majority people hospitalized COVID symptoms vaccinated.

I'm wondering questions coronavirus vaccine--are questions folks could answer?

If live USA, Covid-19 vaccines vaccines available people ages 12 older. recommended folks get vaccinated decrease likelihood getting sick COVID-19, especially decreasing likelihood folks get sick go hospital treatment. Reinfection extremely rare point. Cleveland Medical study came showed none 1400 employees infected still remained unvaccinated reinfection period study. arguments heard vaccination post covid infection people antibodies infection alone. asked every vaccination FDA approved. COVID19 vaccine na Emergency Authorization means fully approved. want forced take vaccine college. Annoying, like human beings are. 😁

But seriously, older ones fine. get occasional group teenagers loud messing things up, is. Annoying AF whatever. ones freaking service desk stupid crap, mess floor, leaving destruction wake. retail life. Delta variant scary enough. 4/5 symptomatic cases involving fevers, higher viral loads pre-Delta variants, slower decline viral loads, 12% patients become severely critically ill within 3-4 days symptom onset. considered significantly transmissible strains going around welland linked different symptoms--diarrhea, micro blood clots bad enough tissue dies develops gangrene, resulting amputations fingers toes, also hearing loss, swelling around neck, severe tonsillitis...plenty reasons patients requiring hospitalization places tearing population. breathing issues. 

Currently 10% cases US B.1.617.2 (Delta). Doubling every two weeks. Meanwhile places like Alabama Mississippi sub 50% even one dose vaccine. Overall US vaccination rates people age 12 right 50%. math pretty easy. 50% population vaccinated, new variant 40% infective (estimates vary--R0 5-8, compared OG strain 2.4-2.6)) hospitalizations increased, could easily right back were.

The FDA good reasons accepting trials conducted countries, specifically, demographics. UK demographics comparable US demographics (there far fewer people Latino decent UK, almost Native Americans, etc), therefore, approving vaccine use US based UK trials means would giving vaccine groups people based little testing group. since efficacy, side effects, adverse reactions vary different ethnic groups cases, that's potentially big problem.

So either FDA says, ""We approve vaccine, white people"", would big problem too. weren’t good. Didn’t change anything. Talk put YouTube... Even results seem trivial logical, scientists assume conclusions without evidence.

***On 17 March 2012, Muamba suffered cardiac arrest collapsed first half FA Cup quarter-final match Bolton Tottenham Hotspur White Hart Lane. receiving lengthy attention pitch medical personnel – including Bolton club doctor Jonathan Tobin Tottenham club doctor Shabaaz Mughal well consultant cardiologist Tottenham fan Andrew Deaner, game persuaded stewards allow onto pitch*** – Muamba taken specialist coronary care unit London Chest Hospital.\[20\] Bolton manager Owen Coyle club captain Kevin Davies accompanied Muamba ambulance.\[21\] match abandoned referee Howard Webb, Bolton's next game, Aston Villa, due played three days later, postponed club's request.\[22\] Aston Villa raised objection. vaccines consist multiple doses much larger interval doses covid-19 vaccines. interval 6 months uncommon.

However, trials tested 6 month interval instead 1 month interval, would've greatly increased duration trial therefore delayed rollout. tested interval simply selected ""good enough"", surprise longer intervals work least well. timetable written sand apparently. Overly cautious opinion. don’t live enjoy. rate Canada going at, assuming moderate ramp (which said supply comes, Moderna), Canada done mid July. words looking somewhat like convergent evolution [Human Coronavirus may well cause 1890 '[Russian pandemic introduced.

We've folks. Embarrassing That's exactly it. Getting anxiety fact people getting vaccinated going change fact.

I volunteer women's shelter even apathetic less compassionate people think pointless, waste time, etc. best community member even many give shit.

You within control. gave arguments man, stop scared let people live......we can't function level constant fear. hell yeah tomorrow wear masks anymore!!!! yipeeeeeeeee Using umbrella prevents getting wet rain? dont like argument two reasons:

1. zero chance vaccines cause autism. Posing hypothetical ridiculous itself.

2. answer actually people, probably including myself, question doesnt ask think does. ask would rather autistic child dead child, answer obvious. hypothetical pose, willfully inflicting disorder child live rest lives. alternative child dying disease, course horrible, horrifying common recently human history. One something chose, something happened tragically. easier accept something tragic happening child willingfully giving disability would life. want downplay anyone's legitimate experience symptoms associated long-haul Covid. However, think extremely highly likely many people mistaking side effects long-term isolation called ""long-haul Covid."" depression, fatigue, etc... things I've experiencing pandemic long, never it. roof. vaccinate ground? take precautions strict car seat, booster seats, seat belt safe driving laws protection. I’m going act like nothing wrong take precautions daughter virus either. I'm talking rear end here, fact US urban populations high rates vaccination, since places airports, might provide barrier less vaccinated smaller towns. vaccines still effective delta variant, slightly less so. Another one acquaintances posted social media AROUND vaccinated people makes dizzy. mean, sounds lot like plain ole anxiety. Someone recommended psychologist, think needs, said mean way I’m sure she’s even turned idea. Ah, makes complete sense. wasn’t aware father would needed claim born! Thanks info. 

I aware large sum cash requirement, mentally figured half mill banked plus whatever house cost, probably 1-1.25m total.

It’s first time hearing private health insurance requirement, though. could well end deal breaker; *entire* reason I’d consider moving overseas would offset cost healthcare. Maybe private healthcare cheaper EU countries otherwise subsidized healthcare.

I know haven’t made accusation; I’ll state anyway. intentions burden anyone retirement. Moving country Ireland (mostly that’s I’d feel “at home”), mind would mutually beneficial, I’d overall net positive impact paying ongoing property taxes, spending locally ongoing needs (food, clothing, assorted other) taxes associated thereof. reckoned true expense +1 person health care system (facilities already built, doctors trained, medicine produced mass scale) would smaller would contribute services would drain schools, unemployment, etc. 

In end would come math equation whether it’s financially beneficial; that’s criteria would use.

It’s local populace/their elected officials whether injecting 1-2m otherwise wouldn’t local economy would greater benefit +1 healthcare roster ~20 years. Maybe it’s worth it, maybe it’s not, it’s completely right fair ones decide that. gave good laugh, thank you! I'm scientist. Give scientific articles, news source admits opinion show news. Rain boots full magnetic 5G trackers. thanks George Soros! says J&amp;J vaccine pulled cured cancer

Whoopsie! antivax crowd would use ""proof"" vaccine ineffective grind heels deeper. totally affected OCD, even vaccinated can't break habits I've developed like sanitizing washing hands touching anything that's household. mean almost ~4 million covid deaths countless millions hospitalizations worldwide haven’t convinced vaccine magnitudes safer contracting covid? 

Yes. particular person I'm talking skeptical.

Yes again. found less hospital overload European countries nothing specific deaths critical patients put respiratory machines think lot poor education medicine, works, know part safe. amazed find anti vaxxers talked didn’t understand vaccines worked couldn’t read study save lives. easy someone post picture really scary sounding chemical name post shady anecdote that’s takes. shit Sherlock. Next up, waters wet. People need certainty reopening plan. set trigger based cases, deaths, R. Picking date bad call since reduces confidence future date met WHAaaaaaaaat??? words describe complete utter lack shock headline. 

In news, it’s going darker colder night sun sets……….. /r/NoShitSherlock move, new grads make close 40, much higher experienced... texas suburb, high cost living, know lot nurses make 100k. Yes, wearing mask gives extra protection getting vaccine. look yourself.

I get saying looking #1 cause problems. think point can't make people give fuck others make want get vaccinated. part ourselves, community, country, &amp; world.  I'm sure understand reasoning here.

Well, Pfizer/Moderna would certainly understand reasoning here, assuming accurate. cant access them..can share here? Saying based 14 cases seems preliminary. suppose UK trial data much better this?

No, UK trial saw 6 cases vaccine group. that's happens effective vaccines, lot cases among vaccinated.

But others mentioned, none trials big enough long enough determine efficacy severe outcomes degree certainty, always take 100% figure massive grain salt. Pfizer's interim readout November, basis EUA, 8 cases vaccine group technically showed 66.7% efficacy severe disease (1 vaccine group vs 3 placebo). numbers severe disease small almost meaningless; 1 case difference 66.7% 100%.

The vaccines still exceptionally effective (likely high 90s) preventing severe outcomes, never going 100% pretty unfortunate ""100% effective hospitalizations death"" got parroted around much based trial data never designed make real conclusions that.   Part wants say them, “why can’t admit don’t understand vaccines work sound scary feel invasive. buy false conspiratorial narrative won’t admit plain scared?” promises Statistics. People die car accidents time stop driving cars, tell story friends daughter got injured driving too. much threat Delta variant spreading Texas pose rest country? sad reality crowd people internet trying claim article propaganda. crazy, right? Like vaccines actually *work* something Headline working – charts show England delaying reducing Covid deaths data shows parts country remain unprotected

Here’s main still vaccine rollout successful, two-thirds population England still protected vaccines symptomatic infection Delta variant. soon know I’m sorry weren’t able time grandparents it’s awesome get talk SO’s grandmother. Yeah think part relationship gave much better perspective things. “things much better back day” sentiment drives nuts. Obviously contend lot medical issues don’t see anymore, also social inequality issues would disgust us see. appreciate comment! TAKE CARE UR SELF LOOLOLOLO 1head  lot them, goes way beyond that, philosophy 'ideology'. core conspiratorial thinking, \*everything\* connected, since 'big government big pharma' working decades turn us slaves, vaccines nothing more, cog giant 'enslavement' project. Ergo, refusing vaccine, stylize heroes, fighting freedom human race. 

The level cognitive distortion truly staggering. Yikes, know that. Ugh. almost like...science able generate antibodies necessarily mean protected getting sick. That's vaccine trials three phases instead two. “1-dose strategy” doesn’t assert otherwise — places it’s policy, it’s almost exclusively enacted due limited vaccine availability.

And given lack availability, wrong strategy something like Delta variant.

Ok, lets math illustrate this:

Lets say without vaccination, 100 people would gotten symptomatic COVID.

* 1 dose 33% efficacy: instead 100 people getting it, 67 people get it. (67% times 100)
* 2 doses 90% efficacy half people vaccinated: instead 100 people getting it, 55 people get it. (10% X 50 +50)
* words, two doses half people results lot fewer cases compared one dose twice people.

And top that, two doses would concentrated vulnerable groups, reductions severe cases would even dramatically favor two doses cases numbers would suggest.

EDIT: formatting USA must delightful country live in. Right vaccine works fine variants, really good reason believe going change substantially. grandmother lost two year old daughter measles. rarely talked pain evident did. Anti vaxxers infuriating ridiculously sheltered.  Das Big Boot Brother watching. Yes, ~half vaccine hesitancy US. agree.

But still near herd immunity threshold, can't Fall children vaccinated. see 85% rate continues. immunity previous infection, 85% *might* get close herd immunity. irresponsible asshats like Bret Weinstein, dangling 'professor biology status' promote 'anecdotal pseudoarguments'. latest podcast, genuinely started saying ""I've talked many people, lot real bad vaccine"". Dang, that's call 'scientific evidence"" (not).   Polio vaccine one things matter much read talk don’t think I’ll ever comprehend fear prior vaccine relief after. know great grandfathers brother polio died later complications. said receiving polio vaccine like blanket fear taken carried life. mean “duhhhhhhh” Strep simething sneeze at...can kill ya like others Wow sky still blue 85% adult population. appears immediate necessity booster time Japan’s cases plus vaccinations ramping up. think it. know anyone else, whenever I've bad illness-induced headache, runny nose, sore throat, last thing wanted go noisy party wee hours morning. wrong people?  Yeah that's never comment things I've read article now. many times headline implied something literally opposite article saying, even trustworthy sources. Fox news short list trust. 

Just get fucking vaccine, absolute waffle. Idk far know state $1-3 $20. I've asked cvs riteaid I've never heard anyone say $40. I'm sorry hear friend. know incredibly frustrating is.

I almost cut ties close friend mine pandemic. get one conversation without talking Covid liberal hoax.

He's finally come around, think took combination people dying social circle, covid sticking around despite Biden becoming president, finally recognizing conspiracies constantly moving goal posts. people access way much information qualified process. see people zero background medicine science, exclaim ""yeah, read bunch clinical studies concluded bogus entire medical-industrial complex scam. Ergo vaccines scam too"".

Sure....they read studies. question understand? Probably little. That's fine anyone that's fully vaccinated can't give virus anyone even unvaccinated people... whole node picture. node turn getting vaccinated can't get anyone sick. matter. matter location. matters people got sick fully vaccinated. “Every minute Africa, 60 seconds pass” would even know? vaccines around long.  Theres way anyone anywhere could ever predicted ever less that. get infected first time once. friends anti vaxxer. quickly became identity. get long COVID, spared too? I've got friend caught back December could get vaccine, still trying get back 100%. literally 1 million 18 without major preexisting health condition (requiring multiple hospitalizations last 12 months) die contracting COVID. honestly concerned that, ditch retirement plan play lottery would show similar complete ignorance statistics. Clickbait title. Bananas silver lining pandemic: hospitals purged workers probably even wash hands nobody looking. They'll die... not-cancer they're getting? Great Scott. well also lots tax payers money live Canada miss Vermont family much. Hopefully open travel fully vaccinated we'll get see sooner later. Ikr, hope finds peace. FDA every health authority planet reviewed safety efficacy data coronavirus vaccines trying make vaccine available citizens. countries vaccine ones can't afford it, sadly, supply issues, people vaccine right now.

Meanwhile, folks like Robert Malone double downing debunked experimental options COVID-19 prevention ivermectin  first half, gonna lie. bring good point, delaying second dose perfectly executed vaccination strategy UK did. Think many lives could saved elsewhere getting clear majority people partially protected start top list. 

Despite *constant* Trudeau bashing ""lol Canada/cries Canadian"" posts rampant couple months ago, say crushed thing understatement. Canada set new standard well COVID vaccination drive done. AstraZeneca’s effectiveness 60% two doses

That's still 60% 0%, shows real problem. Mutations coming faster vaccines do.  want prove intelligence four-year-old straining grasp topics beyond understanding—and efforts understand, fail, begin make shit spout whenever deem appropriate. Yep. It’s really gross grow literally showed math. ""opinion"". god's sakes...

I think getting trolled. Trump. Don’t get twisted. Everything say false Pay wall, no, seem right.

Finally—one less idiot world. Invite tell friends.  see happening UK? vulnerable vaccinated. entire states around 30% vaccination. people sub get posts incorporate knowledge glean common sense? maybe third post I've seen, even follow subreddit, see popular page.

What fucking dumbass made connection yet vaccine works?

And 6000 like this?? Fair! totally true racial sexual discrepancies data absolutely tell different story people color, females. mean offend, demographic - white male - much over-diagnosed.

Still, much better science today lot issues overdiagnosing common 90s / early 2000's white males. Compare clinical trials Pfizer J&amp;J. reason expect someone else google readily available information. 

Pfizer ZERO deaths vaccine placebo group. J&amp;J deaths placebo (6 recall) zero vaccinated group. Statistically J&amp;J far higher confidence value death prevention even Pfizer. Pfizer’s death prevention confidence supported extremely good symptom avoidance likely sterilizing immunity, significantly reduces spread well. enough lockdown many businesses going seriously struggle. last lifting much individual, survival various sectors. see big revelation mask wearing infection correlation? critical get vaccinated right away recovery, could help future.

They covid January recovered afraid mRNA vaccines.

I think scared mRNA (but might truthful), family anyway. think need got mild version covid. yeah dry ground makes magnetic!!!! already did. hoping get answer sooner  It’s full blown “no shit” moment. impossible use logic/reason convince someone use either arrive opinion. fertility concerns largely unfounded, concerns COVID-19 causing fertility issues not. 

Seems truly worried future fertility, they'd everything possible avoid getting COVID-19. woman visiting area Florida yesterday told ""people dropping dead"" right getting vaccine ""all place."" really dumb people country there's really excuse it. asked heard declined say. want get sick highly vaccine? make sense? 10% generous, I've tipped zero waiter actual asshole. Dude busy hitting girl instead actually getting could pay bill (I literally sat 30 minutes done eating). sushi Chef quite literally get manager get bill paid for. headline... ??
Did perhaps misread part?
""One additional person confirmed fully vaccinated two doses vaccine contracting illness, total 11, Friday.""

They thought 10 vaccinated people originally, another person confirmed fully vaccinated, bringing 11. 11 past 2-week window immunity still building up.

I even searched quote article quote. I'm bad care antoivaxers choose die? 1) rates transmission similar

2) taking covid vaccination account, flu vaccination. Why?

I mean still go pub, cinema, restaurants, play sports, go sport events, like end world. People witnessed constant death infectious disease. would sweep nations (diphtheria, smallpox, measles, whooping cough, polio, etc etc). many vaccines many diseases practically non-existent, leading idiots believe need vaccines.

 coronavirus rules remain place England another four weeks planned 21 June unlocking, government sources told BBC. Senior ministers signed decision delay lifting legal restrictions social contact.  could mean capacity limits sports, pubs cinemas remain, nightclubs would stay closed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson due confirm delay news conference later - 18:00 BST. extension put Commons vote month could trigger sizeable Conservative backbench rebellion. England due move stage four government's roadmap lockdown 21 June, venues events would allowed operate without capacity limits cap guests weddings would lifted.  would also meant end current rules limit gatherings home six people two households. many scientists called reopening delayed enable people vaccinated receive second doses, amid rising cases Delta variant, first identified India. delay would also allow work done whether vaccines breaking, simply weakening, link infections hospitalisations. 4 weeks get lot people vaccinated. Nope. source market Ehome 3. family staff hospital lived there. market outbreak, infecting wife went market there. fully vaccinated lived far away, contact traced. infected husband, staff hospital. also fully vaccinated. hospital, infected 53 colleagues, vaccinated. 1 53 infected wife, microbiology staff another hospital also fully vaccinated. wife infected 3 colleagues guard hospital, 4 vaccinated. currently unknown guard hospital staffs infected unvaccinated patients, certainly infected fully vaccinated people.

For countries pursue mitigation vaccination like US, silent spread considered non-issue American government populace, Vietnam follows Zero Covid strategy, silent spread dangerous setting like hospitals among largely unvaccinated population (meaning ill unvaccinated patients likely going get sick die) unacceptable scenario stomped immediately. Frankly put, kind silent spread encourages virus mutate something vaccine-resistent due massive selective pressure vaccinated still infected people. individual scale, sure, vaccinated basically get get jail free card unless really unlucky. However, society-wide scale, allowing silent spread among vaccinated people grand scale billions people almost definitely going kill lot people without access vaccines unable get vaccinated, first people die unvaccinated patients, family members, neighbors people got vaccinated. man, course not. one things [doctors misdiagnosed underlying issues really taken care simple prescription Adderall.  big part problem recently anti vaxxers able free ride herd immunity created rest us vaccinated families.

Capitalism reason Pfizer vaccine, could without capitalism. theory, name crying loud remember reading back, remember where, perceived chance getting caught committing crime bigger impact crime rate level punishment. Basically punishment stealing $100 fine get caught every time people steal. punishment death probably get caught people steal much want.

I think similar thing here. Catching covid much worse side effects vaccine. catching covid, minds, unlikely vaccine side effects almost guaranteed. understand catching covid actually likely happen given enough time. Three weeks flatten curve..

18 months later ....... happened collectively parents? family super liberal surprised still wanted fly AZ family reunion last year. straight told going I'm still hurt tried cajole go. completely blind sided that's normally are?!

We vaccinated &amp; planning reunion October. I'm wondering point I'll bring ""boomers lost damn mins last year y'all think leaded gasoline?"" 🤪 (They normally talk generation lol, wanna serve back them)   Yeahhh even close experiences conversations Greece, incredibly wide net want cast. worst thing happen medical staffs getting infected, stayed asymptomatic, transmitted infection unknowingly unvaccinated patients.

Fortunately data favorable notion asymptomatic transmission low risk. number one risk factor long covid already suffering anxiety depression you’re probably something.

Talking ass, rather die? gun head taking shot, I'm taking vax shot. (reporting: took vax without gun head) sure even generally predict likelihood without first seeing results trial data. application pfizer roughly expected somewhere Sept-Nov timeframe gives B1.617.2 (delta) plenty time take root sprout unvaccinated populations, easily exacerbated maskless kids returning school right around time frame. Given favorable trial data, I'd bet this, advisory committees, would vote favor EUA simply grounds benefits outweigh risks, also reminder EUA mean guidelines recommendations can't used shape vaccination campaigns (i.e. appropriate kids states/regions large percentage unvaccinated populations, higher prevalence community spread, high percentage B1.617.2, etc.) ""Correlation equal causation"" -Them Delta increasing US, drastically slower rate UK. it’s case many European countries regards delta comparing similar timelines. anything, UK outlier whole situation. Placebo effect real. might really help them, even mind. Mexico receive 1.3M J&amp;J Vaccines tomorrow, donated Papá Biden himself, thank gringos, cool! 3 year old well going wear mask public gets vaccine (hopefully within next 4 months).

But keep mind, case rates state *very* low younger kids really much risk, generally speaking. fully vaccinated 12+ 55% heavily populated counties, keep mind huge portion population caught covid last 6 months natural form immunity likely we're looking 70+% immunization rate.

In words, understand hesitancy, generally speaking we're pretty safe moment. Things might change future right now, we're good place. checked EOB fall. insurance paid Walgreens $41 cost me.

Cal-OSHA suck peepee. Even Californians still pro-lockdown think they’re going far this. Paywall. 1) Vaccines

Yes, seem get lucky. also certain regions waiting time 4 days (Urk) regions wait almost 3 weeks. that's great question ask future. 

And seem research, instead listens antimask side. Wow surprise. shouldnt need articles u know, idiots  hope u rely dot coms actual research

Says guy research reddit_.com_ r/nottheonion Holy shit, anyone see fuckin plot twist coming? hope right, variant impact younger people higher rates. agree vulnerable populations well covered, demographic vulnerable populations shifts vaccine uptake shift ahead it, things could go south fast. Pun intended, since majority states vaccination rates low south. Sometimes someone says something really stupid. People need ignore them.

People ignoring stupid stuff like we're 90% vaccinated now. frustrating. Yeah, Cal/OSHA sync regulators looking best...  might get things fixed end month. Sometimes works. couple friends solidly getting back April, got second doses. It’s almost vaccinations work! Indeed. joke anti vax. better person I. cut ties two lifelong friends I've known since middle school. lived Trump country, believe conspiracy theories, literally called ""liberal"" believe science vaccines. disheartening argue explain vaccines work, Trump lost election legitimately, no, vaccine Bill Gates liberal cabal globalist injection track people. deleted Facebook, changed phone numbers avoid spam, moved life. trying explain basic fundamentals immunology science exhausting. response would whack job Doctor 3rd world country calling COVID hoax would show peer review studies vaccine efficacy. stuck mindset whole thing hoax orange god almighty said so, refused believe anything else. I'm done dealing stupid. Implying theyre putin trolls takes away individual responsibility countries nutjobs produce. anti vaxers existed long widespread foreign propaganda efforts. That's symptomatic, study hospitalization/severe symptoms.

Ultimately vaccines 90s protecting worst. means severe cases vaccine group trial

In Novavax's words, cases ""moderate severe disease"" vaccine group. 10 moderate 4 severe, placebo. Nitpicking, know, adding points convo here.

And wish we'd stop saying ""100% effective"" laypeople interpret wrong; ""there 100% reduction cases placebo vaccine groups"" think Delta non issue vaccinated people US.

Even reason J&amp;J isnt strong mRNA - 6% vaccinations J&amp;J. also believe J&amp;J trials booster shot, although know little J&amp;J wanted mRNA followed closer  mean like chance didn’t familiar numbers pulling poop straight bunghole? Israel vaccinated roughly 59% total population. US 52.5%. need vaccinate everyone virtually get rid virus. Stop fearmongering. Surely things would much better much faster everyone would get mother fornicating shot, won't. Stop peeing pants it. We're still moving forward full steam ahead. they're massively overrepresented Reddit. surprise Oh, I’m going anywhere without one while. primary concern vaccination rate isn’t be. Dropping mandate we’re little higher risks outbreak unvaccinated populations. I’ve got kids can’t get vaccine yet virulent variants detected state last thing want see large outbreak 12 age group. maintain significant asymptomatic spread continue mutate, likely eventually end situation variants unaffected vaccine, like flu. Staggering! AZ good Delta vs Pfizer

It's 92% effective hospitalization/severe symptoms Delta variant, 60% symptomatic/minor symptoms, ie cough/headache. may feel ill, get hospitalized, fine me.  Yeah that’s true, sane person doesn’t go near deli meats think you’re paying visit shot. went doctor’s office would free. cvs I’m sure Costco charges. might want look that. schedule nurse quickly trying argue non-vaxxer

😂 Didn’t UK take gamble spacing second shot? 

I’m sure clean data saw something vaccines like 35% effective first shot back 90% second delta variant (that infection… didn’t see anything hospital/death). 

I haven’t looked specific communities UK seems nowhere brink now? Hospitalizations 90% Jan think? See Hmmmmm? Vermonter, I'm extremely excited this. 

It's probably worth noting, despite low vaccine hesitation, getting 77% 80% vaccinated took 20 days. state popped vaccination clinics places like farmer's markets, beaches, mobile home parks, struggled find people interested vaccine. 

I'm bringing might demonstrate difficulty areas may hitting final goal (whatever number is). Based experienced Vermont, 80% likely reach many states. stop Source? wonder would think B though, since vaccines essentially speed process, getting us place sooner fewer deaths. won’t find trustworthy authority say vaccine make develop magnetic field.

Well, duh...  think good chunk people think ""I'll fine catch covid, take vaccine real risk"".

I might believe vaccine-hesitant people know careful catching COVID. Everyone know yet get vaccine, whatever reason, living life like COVID catch.  stops infection **period** instances, serious infection. vaccines do, holy fuck. almost like complicated... knew Putin’s trolls would try spread story. new issues, things FDA aware factored EUA?

Between vaccines (particularly rates high risk folks) natural immunity math doesn’t work terms scenario creating hospital spike anywhere close fall/winter.

Well obvious. many small brained folks world selfish refuse take it. wonder studies level education received folks… live long enough!  lot places Chicago adding 20% check automatically. Basically making socially uncomfortable leave less even service shit. Go figure… Ok. Thank you. I’ve trying understand differences US UK. article written “the media”: says Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine 92% effective variant two doses, Pfizer-BioNTech shot offers 96% protection two doses. research found one dose 17% less effective protecting people Delta variant compared Alpha variant, much smaller difference means UK race time get jabs arms next four weeks.
The government believes achieve reducing gap doses 12 weeks eight people age 40. Everyone age 40 dose mid-May offered second July 19, 18s offered first shot date.

Also, decision made UK government, “the media” Bingo  really referring ""cultural factors"". referring stuff like (from ""Differences drug metabolism"" section studies found one-third Asian Americans one-third African Americans genetic alteration decreases metabolic rate IID6 isoenzyme, leading greater risk side effects toxicity.

You're essentially advocating take steps NEVER taken previously order assure people forcefully compelled get vaccine. travel restrictions get hep b vaccine? Mmr? No? restrictions work cases? No? Ok than. free travel work vaccinated virus kills 5-15% children adults infects, world would unable vaccinated virus kills less .2% people infects? Yes less 1/5th 1%. Rediculous.

In case I'm prone believe FDA also strongly pressured industry ""leaders"" like Pfizer. friend otherwise smart, get vaccine due fear side effects. friend got vaccine shortly after, like within 4-7 weeks, got covid. figured opened bottle red wine tasted like went bad. took bite heavily garlicked pasta made go said wine taste anything. added garlic pepper... still nothing cardboard taste wine tasted like vinegar(or like went bad, idk) him. 

So friend's friend caught vaccination reason get it. least that's one excuses. 

I told imagine buddy's symptoms would without vaccine. reacted poorly vaccinated, probably would hospital. Nothing else could causing much excess mortality. it’s worse shit.... see coming said vaccinated person aren’t tiny sample sizes. mathematically significant. don’t acknowledge doesn’t change that. 

A fact table validates 95% CI. 

How much vaccine protect symptomatic cases? 66.1%. 

How much vaccine protect severe disease? 85%. 

Is severe cases required deaths occur? Yes. 

What percentage people die infection? 0.5%. 

Calculating shows J&amp;J vaccine 99.25% effective probable death infection. Even crazy high estimate 33% covid cases become severe, puts 99.7%. 

The 6/0 deaths validate data. 

This completely ignoring antibody/B-T Cell data shows response virus. UK live challenge trials see little antibodies needed protection.

You’re alleging there’s crazy “entire world” mathematical conspiracy vaccines don’t work scientific mathematical communities ignoring this. link documentation please? want tell friends wrong Please give citation state efficacy number referring to.

Even opened nightclubs tomorrow probably wouldn’t go next year even Irish mate, stop presuming know nation feels. 21 days, looks like 👍🏻  think matters much want shift first doses second doses. 

For example, conservative estimate Germany able fully vaccinate 70% adults end July. reach number calculating giving X million jabs time divide X 2, get X/2 million people fully vaccinated. politicians cannot entirely influence many first doses given man second doses, real numbers end July might be: 63% fully vaccinated, 77% least one dose. 

But fact governments assume 70% adults actually take jab within near future, remaining 30% hesitant, unavailable, facing medical obstacles. (Those figures will, course, vary country country.) Based assumption, time get 70% big gap fully vaccinated people people received first jab. look less like 63%/77% hypothetical example, like 67%/73%. think many governments rather confident 70% threshhold end July, unpredictable nature factors mentioned might also governments might choose conservative estimates. likely transmitting it.

You're right, option JJ/AZ covid, getting JJ/AZ would no-brainer.

And truth this: way life dying. Slowly, surely, dying. they're afraid.

What afraid of? Well - let's take look old pal, projection.

Ever notice vehemently helping marginalized populations sort white working class voters are? reality situation incredibly, uncomfortably close marginalized populations are. Poorly educated. Low earnings. they're scared becoming bottom-rung society - immensely proud (in eyes) bottom rung society.

That's they're things like increasing minimum wage. make $13.50 hour working Home Depot, think increased minimum wage $15 rising tide lifts boats. Instead, look sudden people lower rung society level you. sudden -you're- bottom rung society - even people see better than.

And scares hell them. think they're better that, mind, difference would government artificially propping guy flipping burgers - clearly better valuable them, sudden government propped attempt ""marginalize"" you.

That's fear, marginalization. bottom rung society - guys like Trump modern American party play like fiddle. would rather clearly better someone view beneath them, significantly better now.

The lab picture level that. safety equipment expensive need special training use correctly. Nah, UmbrellaGate. Wrong! take increase hospitalizations approach fall/winter peaks hospital systems held fine.

And really impressed vaccine rollout town center!  Oh fuck. article: Covid also acting differently now. like bad cold younger population people don’t realise hasn’t come across government information. 
‘This means people might think they’ve got sort seasonal cold still go parties might spread around six people think fuelling lot problem.’ 
... 
‘The number one symptom headache, followed runny nose, sore throat fever. old classic symptoms. don’t see loss smell top ten more, variant seems working slightly differently.’

So covid always cold symptoms, seems like one way less symptoms associated covid, way ones confused cold meaning bigger share symptomatic infected may keep heading out, infecting people.  point Pass verify it. business that, failure pass. employer, hospital right set qualifications employment within law.

Allergy symptoms. Agree, tbh read article bother, tremendous doing. That's much. Eh, tourism significantly Cape, entirely buy that. also extreme showing visitors states like Texas last year, Cape rarely sees visitors from. MA, though, low levels covid cases last summer, seemed attract people across country.

I'm serious amount Texas license plates crazy. type tourist us normally interact definitely struggled traffic.  are, short-term solution permanent solution. Lockdowns sustained long, good buying time.

Yes. course trends change, Lawyer Craig Twitter pointed Delta variant US spreading far slower rate UK comparing timelines. According him, US went 2-3 weeks behind UK 5-6 weeks behind terms % cases Delta variant. would pump breaks little delta fears lol.  breakthrough case symptoms. first symptom actually loss voice, next morning woke fever, runny nose, sore throat. Later day headaches, body aches, chills. wasnt sure Covid 4th day lost sense smell got tested came back positive Covid. Symptoms lasted 10-11 days. Pfizer vaccine, fully vaccinated (2nd shot) month definitely breakthrough case. never told strain though. find quite concerning something like even necessary. happened people common sense?  Older generations tend think way. dad's like too. Yep. people calling k-shaped recovery get “itchiest fucking eyeballs ever” least I’ll covid allergies Good know we’re liked put world last 4 years They're summarizing yahoo news article study Oxford UCLA. muppets even read article? US? also RN even challenging job like ICU fucking hate it. figured another job could go get close salary think could handle going back school. happy making change. Probably like 2600 (so 20X stated number) That's relatively cases many deaths. Ontario getting many deaths 2000+ cases day second wave (most people were't vaccinated time). testing severe cases? vaccination uptake Fairfax County probably much, much, much higher US average. I'd wager that's one educated counties country. Easier said done. 5 years restaurant management belt, approximately zero successful interviews outside industry.  leaves Antarctica deepest south? Wow! asshole. Glad society next ten years. Somehow doubt doom expect happen come fruition.

Sorry dude end days Covid America.  I’m pretty much convinced cdc didn’t roll passport system country lacks infrastructure nationlized healthcare system, vaccine records managed county county state state basis. created nationwide vaccine passport system would require nationwide health records network, thanks us healthcare ~~system~~ *industry* DOESNT exist would take long ass time develop article wasn’t making opinion statement gdp. Here’s another article indicating 7% gdp. don’t original source used article. doesn’t breakdown manufacturing type list manufacturing 19% gdp. percentage auto manufacturing? 

Do something shows figure different 7% state gdp. I’m vaccinated. I’m living life. wouldn’t touch Florida 10 ft pole. pandemic continuing steady burn potential super spreader events always present. nice someone actually likes us ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  Yeah specifically addressed article...

Oh wait, did! packed stadiums? Events happening? Remember super bowl was(n’t) super spreader event? 

There’s shred news overlap unvaccinated attendees &amp; Covid cases. it’s mostly “haha fuck Florida Bitcoin” article. could written literally current future event. you’re worried get vaccine. stay inside. risk it. It’s choice.  one hope Apple keeps Covid related changes place. Apple stores normally get much foot traffic literally smell press bodies them. emptier, airy stores much nicer pre pandemic sweaty masses store. no, pretty substantial step back. substantial remains seen. CDC ACIP meeting June 18th, mostly discuss myocarditis issue also agenda item:

""Overview data inform recommendations additional doses COVID-19
vaccines""

There might updates meeting - least better sense regulators looking boosters.

Agenda: Yep. uncle died covid. 44 years old. People funeral telling dad grandmother definitely died something else “they marked covid” 🙄 explicitly encouraged change jobs fields? job emergency fund cover enough household expenses without worrying eviction hunger job hunting/retraining? guys restructured budget low possible lately allow working less?

Work stress sucks, hope finds techniques make manageable better job/career. Kids 12 still can't get vaccinated, yet. removed indoor mask mandates.

From Reddit comment summed well:
  There’s difference schools mandating attendance schools encouraging attendance. Sounds like you’re conflating 2.

Having temperature 99.8, alone, isn’t indicator illness. you’ve learned anything past year, it’s combination present symptoms.

It’s literally schools job follow ensure child’s absence warranted. 

Sick kids absolutely go school parents can’t afford send event mildly ill. nothing “tyrannical” school policies. Sick kids stay home time, always always will. Hope so, got Irish mates wanting finally travel here.

Been building pretty huge rare belgian beer supply year+ able get here... Every time hear personal freedom argument want throw someone roof jump myself. Personal freedoms aren’t thing called right infringes rights, freedom, safety another without consent.

Fauci also says small gatherings family definitely safe attendance eligible vaccine it, Thanksgiving Christmas likely won’t superspreader events year. Shocking  numbers people Covid, get vaccine, got delta? far soon that? delta variant (now dominant strain UK), 2 doses twice protective 1. fact, almost 3 times protective. 

Again, two-doses, get total protection one dose twice many people, protection would concentrated high-risk populations. Anything involve forcibly saying ""oh poor unvaxed people"" get words zapped soooo...

Nobody knows yet long term effects. I’m sure thought nothing going happen too.

Stop giving false promises. seems virus causes devastating pandemic, vaccine said virus mandatory job places person public place. Including retail/grocery, transportation, education, similar services. Even construction crews infecting eachother. doctors scared may get sick never recover. waiting research come out. Also, referred Johns Hopkins PACT (post acute covid team) team treats long haulers like me. However, backlogged 2-3 months im wait August first appointment. Im hoping team JH able give guidance vaccine, well long haul recovery. go along this, conversation said Vaccine killing people, mentioned 10's millions people got vaccine less 2000 died correlation comment was, ""that's 2000 many!"" replied, ""and 100'000's thousands died Covid?""

Final thing him, ""I'm getting it, that's final."" 

Fact's matter, way feel refuse think situation. mean they’re taking 5G towers vaccines happening, putting more, there’s less?
 
That’s thing would make sense 5G conspiracy theorist. hair loss dizziness. get little dry mouth, like I'd drink cold water still thirsty makes sense. Popsicles lifesaver dealing that, lol So…as fully vaccinated person, anticipate able travel vacation in-country (the US) fall without fear closures restrictions reimplemented?

Not worried health anymore, worried state local governments may go nuts Delta variant starts spreading wildly among unvaccinated reimplement closures mask mandates.  Dude!! parents got it. me.
60+. could visit center directly get shots.

Yeah. People using bots book slots. government little prevent this. It’s snarky point unproven comment JnJ Astra seem similar issue w blood clotting younger women. u notice hair loss dizziness ? mention blood clots occurring rarer frequency similar medications like BIRTH CONTROL. think mostly anti-establishment. want ""the government"" telling do, knee-jerk reject government would like do.

Some people scared change new things, people think get vaccinated time meet physician pastor somebody non-governmental authority also person's best interest heart.

I expect actual anti-vax group small, bigger issue people scared new things. maybe I'm optimist. links woulda thunk? No, way covid. Maybe moon exaggeration, seemed pleasant grateful American would rightly insulted received. people think shutins who's lives validated. considering getting vaccinated see helps?

Although still experiencing significant symptoms, understand hesitant feel little better. far understood Austrian media, wasn’t vaccinated players tested time.. imo rare things like happen. Especially maybe play middle field run lot time. mean, lot people's heads simple ""I'm healthy now, take vaccine I'm going feel like shit 3 days? sounds stupid"" Israel sitting [60% nowhere near herd immunity threshold.  also added benefit killing young/middle aged women like Astra JnJ vaccines

Had point proven already assumption theoretically possible vaccine similar side effects AZ/J&amp;J. Thats good hear it'll take 100 days. 

But know new strain mRNA trigger auto immune reaction? also help traditional vaccine, skeptics scared new science. Combine conspiracy theories recipe distrust Without solving capitalism, there's little that. it? Unfortunately, lot unvaxed people probably kids already technically natural selection. Maybe included bit headline.

I would wonder Covid picked on, since also cause heart problems (in fact, pretty much side effects vaccines seem usually-smaller versions Covid cause). said “see ya later don’t live reality.” Followed many “I can’t, can’t even, can’t.” views covid vaccines emotion feelings. someone basing existence two things devoid actual facts reasoning them. Time move on. It’s funny always would tell I’m smart many topics, covid vaccines need “do research.” Shit infuriating. ignorance hurts. Right? newly grown third arm super useful! (/s, Reddit all). ""most"" hanging part older brother. ""Vaccinated people still give disease what's fucking point?"" I'm sure we've seen single confirmed case anyone fully vaccinated transmitted virus. probably happened twice earth somewhere, know confirmed. see logic it? Better stay current phase bit longer that's scientists recommending. like we're lockdown. Duh  know plenty 70+ anti vaxxers. something formed binary dichotomy. left vs right thing, old vs young thing, cultural thing. people skeptical nature regardless information show them. I've learned anything last years, _huge_ portion population way immature I'd previously thought.

You say again. Growing thought adults better average kids, since, all, ""grew up"" boy huge error, pandemic threw gas large portion population getting immature quietly really magnified that. written esteemed colleuges Duh. hilarious anti-Vax morons literally scratch stupid fat heads this. set ""not before"" date people ask question every day months. give certainty people know things going change certain period time. news, people getting wet walk outside rain, stay inside stay dry. love headline confirms exactly knew along vaccine programs rolled out. I'm going assume attempting troll even vaccinated? don’t believe maybe source wrong..  Yeah, shit get sense little hesitancy people mid seventies older.  Yep spouse able get second doses 7 1/2 weeks following first dose bumped eligibility family/friends/colleagues got first doses April/May already scheduled 6-8ish weeks rather 12-16 week wait anticipating got first shots. I’d say even county level state level. high low vaccine counties within high low vaccine states. long entire county mostly vaccinated fine regardless what’s going rest state.  still don’t know long term effects organ damage virus. Whereas know “long term” effects vaccine, vaccine doesn’t live inside instructs body defend Covid. thought tested negative antibodies. Duh, cures cancer death, ya silly goose. 3 weeks flatten curve!!! now?!

[Delta Variant India cases create gangrene Mask requirements workplace dropped tomorrow. Cal-OSHA may drop rule end month. you’re unable deduce lower hospitalizations fewer deaths due vaccination also means fewer life-threatening, critically ill covid cases

Surely guys seeing pattern here? long planning keeping charade up? even semblance ""fucked"". Dear lord people, educate yourselves. all. live California, I'm pro vaccine little sympathy anyone gotten vaccine yet. one saying can't wear mask. Hell, times might still well future. 

But California 2nd lowest transmission rate country right now, dropping mask mandate fine. think risk, wear mask.  think relevant. 

Both covid flu exponential death rate age, 10x worse covid.

Flu vaccination mostly decreases severity, 30% effective infection.

I fail understand transmission rate it? Right US there's little transmission happening.

A lot people wonder many people say long covid really too. Especially since folks never tested positive COVID. 

This mystery take quite uncover, think. Canada given 30M doses date (population 37.5M). saying that's going go 1/3 week? immediate explanation comes mind 'behavior', that's necessarily case. depends. Population density 'may' easy go-to speaking infectious disease, looking things like 'people per square mile' may obscure important facts. People living spacious apartments larger cities may look 'crowded' poorer people living cramped quarters country may actually crowded far. also economic factors related social class large effects. feel badly children, without access, immunocompromised people can't get vaccine. reject due propaganda sheer ignorance much. effort putting social pressure vaccinated makes angry.

However, US [annual mortality 2019 870 per 100,000 people, meaning given 6 month long window expect 435 per 100,000 people die random causes. vaccine distribution ramped period, assume vaccination rates uniform would expect average person vaccinated 3 months CDC survey period, expect 217 deaths per 100,000 vaccinated people due things unrelated vaccine. number similar actual deaths, 170 per 100,000, suggesting nearly reported “vaccine deaths” unrelated vaccine.

- Another California resident  95% people age 80 fully vaccinated. Given age group will, irrespective vaccination, vulnerable respiratory illness, inevitable significant proportion people die COVID fully vaccinated. Ultimately fully vaccinated 90 year old probably greater chance death unvaccinated 50 year old. One ways prevent infection antibodies body fluids render viral particles enter inert anything.

Another way cellular immunity kills infected cells would ever even show molecular test set expanding infection. It’s always easy forget many people actually live Canada massive geographically. Hell?

NEW! last regularly scheduled vaccination update post. Thank following updates vaccination trends. pleasure all. One issue delta variant vaccines appear effective variants several weeks second dose. single dose vaccine 33% effective Delta Covid, according Public Health England. Several weeks second dose, figure rises 60% AstraZeneca 88% Pfizer.

Your protection rises time? ping^g^^g^^^g^^^^g worries alot social functions gov start requiring proof ofvaccination. Unvaccinated work dont mask anymore. didnt do. Deff dont want get sick tho. made seize week it. Texas opened months ago way worst vaccination numbers fine.

Do data go fear?  initial 3 weeks buy time expand NHS capacity, assumption would eventually catch it.  republican governor really safe go without mask places? I'm fully vaccinated, healthy, I'm worried still able catch Covid pass grandparents, fully vaccinated too, still high risk die Covid breakthrough case. keep looking information safety wearing masks, keep getting articles papers say keep wearing mask, enforce idea safety community, protect me. I'd like enjoy upcoming vacation Disneyland, participate bowling league week, without itchy, stuffy mask, I'm still scared Covid, especially new variant. anti Vax? looking data day misleading given headline... current death rate delta variant data .1% compared 1% higher typically experienced Covid... 

To me, looking data would lead believe, much less people dying, really vulnerable fully vaccinated, somewhat vulnerable half vaccinated, unvaccinated, lower risk groups. looking headline, makes sound like vaccines working, instead, basically means makes likely 70 year old fully vaccinated die Covid, healthy 20 year old vaccines... positive result. Uhhh nope! No, fact factually imagine I'll feel like 6 years, I'm new enough still fully enchanted shit hit fan.
