Of vaccinated contracted COVID-19, 317 patients required hospital care. average age 74.

The article talks many unhappy medical establishment - eg slower give treatment compared white people. Vaccines way, opposite - offered free, large numbers want it.

The article also talks many vaccines initially set locations inconvenient black people. may issue earlier on, less issue (not say completely fixed). Unless actually main issue? unvaccinated put one insurance pool. want pay higher premiums guys. Short that, insurance companies cover COVID-19 treatments willingly unvaccinated people (exemption people medically cannot take vaccine otherwise ineligible). Conceiving, carrying term, giving birth.

(Efficacy calculated nowhere sample unvaccinated people comparison, either vaccinated getting ill unvaccinated getting ill raises number) fine Interesting.

This despite UK 80% population vaccinated (50% fully vaccinated 2 doses). mostly circulating unvaccinated young community, still great level spread fully vaccinated people.
Our cases dramatically rising estimated R rate currently 2.
Hospitalisations going up.
This low levels, think rate increasing, vaccines win spread spiralled far control.
I believe saw figure said 100 800 people hospitalised actually fully vaccinated. However vast majority people go hospital die still vaccinated.
Our vaccine program done soon, believe is, sufficient suppression virus stop spread without major restrictions needed. point being, even vaccine program successful US UK, definitely enough stop delta variant basically complete. people go entire adult lives without getting shot kind? even possible? Actually top Hungary Malta, using non EMA approved vaccines. top EU countries, lead (surprisingly) Belgium, followed Germany, many countries level (basically depending announce results order change).

At lower end, Bulgaria behind Eastern European countries also behind campaign (Romania, Poland, chart OWID numbers yesterday strongly disagree, friend. I‚Äôm sorry.

Ah, today learned. Thanks info. Plus another 3 4 million uncounted India another 4 5 million countries count poorly, simply lie. Geez, 11. think 6 taken made arm feel weaker.

It easily painful vaccine I've ever gotten. identical twin got vaccine time (administered different nurse) said barely felt it. pain tolerance same. think mine hit bad spot something. Shit. I'm called out. figured since I'm mostly trapped home except 0, 1 2 4 hours shifts per week dollar tree, enough people would got reason to.

Thing is, island country says vaccines approved count 'fully vaccinated', since state mixing vaccine brands allowed person considered unvaccinated quarantine 5 days.

I'm sure common mixing vaccines countries. think US. Apparently, least Canada, heard someone say UK second shot whatever available. 

I'd consider fully vaccinated even different doses length time specified shots -- example, UK trying vaccinate lot people one shot first moving second shots, shots spread recommended -- apparently, countries might not.

I know anxiety I'd much rather go wait line hundreds people get vaccinated delay. care gives fucking shot. needs one place go puts ""the list"" tells go time.

Instead people getting shot know pregnant person friend friend knows doctor. Disgusting.

The whole thing really broken bizarre know people furious. So, R0 4.8 (Delta variant) 240% higher R0 2 (the original variant).

Actually 240% *as high as* original. 140% *higher* original.  UK makes seem like keep getting worst strains covid, due better sequenceing Yeah sort realised posted too‚Ä¶

I think that‚Äôll ‚Äúit depends‚Äù answer terms variant, breakthrough intensity vaccine used. 

There‚Äôs research indicating mRNA vaccines induce stronger immune response compared inactivated virus vaccines (as you‚Äôd expect), you‚Äôd anticipate mRNA vaccines better resist aspects virus including long Covid symptoms.

But think long Covid general take years properly characterise. (1 √ó 1.5 √ó 1.6) - 1 = 1.4

So delta 140% contagious original virus.  1st person: ""MF first."" would say that's pretty safe bet. remember last summer wife's mother hospitalized heart problems. also dementia, completely unbalanced hospital away anything familiar. telling different things different doctors remembering was.

Pissed much neither wife siblings allowed visit stay due covid rules. allowed call, every time called begged come home.

I. e.: similar wave, similar vaccination rates. hope delta wave might delayed enough drag autumn, would needed another lockdown anyway, matter much. ""earlier Delta countries"" (like UK, US, Portugal) hit summer bring restrictions summer, might also another round restrictions autumn another wave, would hard sell. wanna around dick starts coughing bit misleading - EU accept vaccines approved EMA default, individual countries may choose recognise vaccines

This better situation - EU countries didnt care vaccine status entering (PGR test + quarantine cases needed) Yep, I‚Äôve sniffly since March. I‚Äôm also prone headaches summer months trigger getting overheated. 75% 12+ people 65% Canada's population i.e. Canada's overall 12+ population 65*(100/75)=86.66%.


So Canada's 12 population 13.33% total population 35% encompasses Canadians ages vaccinated. Canadians 12. like 15%. math off. One would think inactive virus would highest efficacy rate UK surge cases right now, mainly driven unvaccinated majority 30s bracket (which tends socialize more) Delta variant seems increased resistant vaccine, particulary people partly vaccinated (one dose) much risk catching Delta variant catching Alpha variant (which previous dominant variant UK).

How compare countries without reduced covid precautions. NZ/AU Sweden significant flu? African countries? states like Texas Florida? sure common mixing vaccines countries.

I'm pretty sure mostly got AstraZeneca first get mixed doses. Moderna Pfizer seems safer AstraZeneca enough two, AstraZeneca used much anymore... math correct, I‚Äôm certain is, also means every first person Germany vaccinated twice. already know one fully vaccinated person Florida got new variant. covid last year too. says even vaccinated considerably worse first time.  this. stuff leaks labs, would known stuff. Pfizer gang AKA Every vaccine administered second person, once. perhaps happened emerge Kent I‚Äôd say hell coincidence.

If emerged elsewhere, would extremely likely Alpha would've started dominate first elsewhere. ""elsewhere"" need impressive sequencing capacity notice there's new variant making cases.

We see happening though. UK clearly first country Alpha blew up, well ahead countries.

So possible small, self-contained outbreak another country one person brought virus Kent, likely variant simply emerging Kent.

thank help American vaccine hesitancy meant stopped vaxxing fast used to. Americans anti-vax would way people vaxxed.

Their rollout actually pretty badass dumb people getting vaccine.

Numbers hard, look correct ones doofus. guess also okay high insuline prices critical drugs expensive yes? thanks! Unexpected IASIP, always appreciated. congrats east china! Don‚Äôt give idea‚Ä¶ Ya close number overall vaccines per capita, though first dose per capita seems lot useful terms quickly mitigating spread. that‚Äôs choice Canada made starting second doses. sort ""fleeting contact"" transmission dangerous unvaccinated result re-examination public health measures place wherever transmission occurring variant. 3 grandparents shots moved up. parents well. me, gf, friends.

It suck live boonies though still behind great.

The worst part Ford actually managed pandemic put better lockdown place needed probably could opening are.

Soon enough supposed elect clown expect circus. virus vaccine. 

Get fucking vaccinated, dude. prove? still higher percentage population vaccinated. JnJ also uses stabilized spike protein. AZ not.

JnJ would likely relatively similar mRNA vaccine efficacy two doses. 

AZ suffers lower efficacy due lack stabilized spike protein. 

Curevac (the new mRNA vaccine) may issue use modified mRNA bases like Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech. Clearly research went using modified mRNA bases valid. likely mRNA destroyed modified able create enough spike proteins. 

Most vaccines use inactivated virus particles. Novavax uses stabilized spike protein, delivers directly (it made lab; use cells generate it). there. It‚Äôs almost USA met family Father‚Äôs Day huge discussion sister doesn‚Äôt want get vaccine ‚Äúa real vaccine takes 3 years‚Äù. Great way kill party. PHE British government. entity study indicating AZ takes longer work Pfizer Indian variant, Pfizer higher effectiveness hospitalisations. ""Surge"" perhaps bit melodramatic, exponential growth state shows herd immunity achieved numbers could continue rise point ""surge"" may appropriate term.

Missouri specifically seen near doubling cases week. That's pretty quick rise. especially concerning Missouri pretty middle road comes vaccination rates; deep south way worse. 

Given number vaccinated (and immune prior infection), unlikely cause issues hospitals (except low vaccination regions) still disappointing see given availability safe, highly effective, free vaccines. Yes since mid 2019 believe in-laws way less stringent covid protocols (pre-vaccine) wife I. wife live area took seriously. in-laws, due age much higher risk, live state didn‚Äôt take seriously. Despite well educated (PhDs both) fact surrounded folks taking less seriously seemed make take less seriously think taking seriously. flew reason, went restaurants wife barely taking walks. wore masks such, constantly maintained taking seriously. tell could come visit us.

It‚Äôs insane people you‚Äôre surrounded alter opinion actions. City schools gone back in-person classes closed starting Monday sprawling capital climbs higher tier coronavirus risk, education authorities said City officials loosened restrictions gatherings schools, hotels, stores restaurants two weeks ago... That‚Äôs exactly I‚Äôm afraid of. Wife went got shots Romania since uptake low, shots available without appointments. waited here, would probably another 2-3 weeks first one. least we're done. I'd expect difference delivery anything. Pfizer Moderna similar design similar efficacy. Maybe less effective vaccines get degraded way cell produce spike protein less efficiently. UK, outbreak mostly younger people (20-29) vaccinated: Aww sweety, numbers hard like big leverage, US particularly defenseless corporations. Pharma extort ""your country"", **your** politicians (esp. GOP) everything power enable companies (and hospital industry) extort fellow citizens. companies take money, do. one thing politicians lobbied bribed, GOP mostly pursues policies ideology spite, worse.

If someone takes steak throws dog, dog devour it. blame dog, guy threw steak. So: blame companies taking much money think get away with; blame politicians enable first place. good go.

My condolences sympathy families lost loved ones unable vaccinated health reasons, far rest jackoffs concerned, kick rocks flip flops. It‚Äôs crazy, choosing death fragile ego. Infuriating can‚Äôt pay people take vaccine America countries begging it. Hopefully things pick soon country. bright side hopefully country better safety measures wait vaccine. half America covid doesn‚Äôt exist isn‚Äôt threat can‚Äôt even get people wear masks. hardly act generosity give away vaccines expire. proof vaccines work.  See response ^^^. wrong. data yet, time data generated late.  

As immunologist, tell reasoning behind vaccination even Covid already:

**Vaccine**: vaccine designed generate anti-Spike protein antibodies, known neutralize virus effectively...

**Infected**: one like gambling, since immune system saw whole virus, antibodies random component generation, entirely possible infected person made tons antibodies useless target lipid envelope, region. antibodies pretty much useless, virus enter cells wreck havoc... @doggoddog government, plans use AstraZeneca vaccine inoculations, sought reach people faster stretching gap 16 weeks, beyond 12 weeks maximum approved European Medicines Agency.

A 16-week interval tested human trials. wasn‚Äôt original premise. tried sound big saying you‚Äôre medical community would heard something. you‚Äôre saying trust reproductive issues vaccines simply bombshell claims coming OB community. (1) enough time passed really see effects reproduction. (2) FDA granted drugs level unscientific inquiry you‚Äôre giving vaccine, we‚Äôd dead. thing show real side effects vaccine longitudinal studies. might nothing might something, studies completed, don‚Äôt know. suggest otherwise level ignorance frankly dangerous  still longest undefended border world. Even today, state, easily drive Canada without going customs immigration. people obviously don‚Äôt work business rely tourist dollars. Easy say don‚Äôt want tourists livelihoods don‚Äôt depend it. like 6 weeks since rolling 7 day average dropped 2 million. provide source that? different variants confusing  America Quarter Pounder Cheese don‚Äôt want money. Visit Mexico, welcome you. would travesty everyone accurately report numbers Florida, considering go much trouble meticulously accurately report infections deaths state. would never use smoke mirrors like disqualifying huge chunks infected population along total number deaths due demographic technicalities. Plus, reporting locked well need report weekly totals, unlike rest country.

It‚Äôs propaganda, it‚Äôs people you‚Äôre surrounded. moved pandemic really hit, ironically Vermont, couldn‚Äôt happier.

Moving arm around gently reported help, warm showers. That‚Äôs logical given know virus vaccines.

Fully vaccinated Americans visiting Canada pose danger Canadians unvaccinated partially vaccinated Canadian. fact, Americans safer around said Canadians.

Nobody saying unvaccinated partially vaccinated Americans allowed Canada. seems like Canadian policy makers stuck knew virus year ago. Yes, live around 1 covid case pr million ppl pr day, they're majority delta variant, waiting weeks potentially better one seems ok used hate shots younger. changed got bit dog get rabies shots. 4 one day, including one deep bite ankle. needing dozen shots course 2 3 months, could care less needle. I'm actually little weird now. time get blood drawn vaccination, look forward it. interesting! yeah, trials I‚Äôm thinking related treating inflammation, smaller scale.  Imagine afraid needles dying... MSP airport. walked up, took information got vaccine right front Starbucks. It‚Äôs literally damn easy people. Sorry - it. shot bad (even though huge needle phobia), couple days arm sore hard lift objects. Thanks! reading article watching video... dipshit deserves everything coming simply jackass. I'm sure continue act like nothing wrong everyone else change way they're living. lazy starting now. neighbor mine got yesterday Walgreens offered spot. wouldn‚Äôt thought appointments obstacle, apparently walk-in availability helps. 17% population Canada fully vaccinated. new Delta variant deadly protected one dose vaccine. basically ""fairly safe"" population. many thousands OK die order open borders early.   

Canada needs people fully vaccinated (not 17%) order protect people Delta variant.  Fully opening borders kill many people Canada.  Maybe solution opens fully vaccinated travellers still protects 83% population still get Delta variant get sick die.    

And pretty bad border closed. doesn‚Äôt make sense. fully vaccinated American walking around Canadian street actually less dangerous Canadians, unvaccinated partially vaccinated Canadian walking street. Approved?
It's simple.
Keep watching twist. *nervous chuckling* present time, WHO‚Äôs position national authorities conveyance operators introduce requirements proof COVID-19 vaccination international travel condition departure entry, given still critical unknowns regarding efficacy vaccination reducing transmission. addition, considering limited availability vaccines, preferential vaccination travellers could result inadequate supplies vaccines priority populations considered high risk severe COVID-19 disease. also recommends people vaccinated exempt complying travel risk-reduction measures.

They say treated like unvacinated ones... family members who's bodies covered ink said crap line.... 100 hours ink yer afraid tiny needle?
My tats hurt worse jab SMH. Well wrong, deal it. Nice vasovagal reflex control, triggering fear reaction.  I'm someone gets fainty needles well unfortunately lot experience needles. Making sure well hydrated beforehand also helpful. get ice pack chest back skull also helps. majority 40 year olds heart attacks overweight. eliminate obesity completely...

This comment worth making. side? everyone follows news knows. state, well highly reputable insurance company, separately online records vaccination.

I‚Äôll log web sites front Canadian immigration officers show vaccination records. think satisfied?

Or think cooked couple fake web sites try deceive them? Would spend money Canada help keep favorite Canadian restaurants stay afloat? Spirit probably going worst variant. always look away jab. I've never understood people literally watch go arm too. It‚Äôs great husband really worry them. 18 cars going get 6 strokes? one car. Guess makes sense stricter islands. canaries balearics might tighter rules well im part 32% les gooo want spread misinfo, yeah cousin told Q thing apparently whatever. Idk lost 20points IQ even reading it. may feel way. that‚Äôs understandable. science support it. Unless could get vaccine medical reasons age, got sick died.  sympathy anyone choice get vaccinated (for medical reasons, kids etc).  feel thing jab, unlike papercut yesterday hurt... scale 1 10... 1,000,000!!!!

For reference blood test needle year covid hit needle certainly stuck lot longer feel lot more! I'm sure happen 2 weeks! /s Agreed, it‚Äôs people saying ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù well. friends take vaccine due possible long-term effects... think phobia privalent needles. :/ fear mongering mean live college town... Everywhere go customers employees wear masks cause everyone smarter seems cause vaccinated following science random friend saying they're gonna die virus GOT VACCINATED FOR... get vaccine still gonna wear mask forever? point vaccine then? 

Also read main part you. Sicknesses gone even though people maskless... maybe 1-2 sick day that's probably outer town... one gym getting sick. child‚Äôs mind voted destroy country second guessing would also fear prick thinnest needle i‚Äôve ever seen. makes sense‚Ä¶

‡≤†_‡≤† that, mostly agree. Although think one thing needs happen US government continue make deals integration Delta variant mRNA vaccine ""boosters"" come out, probably hurt continue keep masks around high-risk areas. correct. failure system support them.

That's ridiculous. vaccination centers place sorts hours. There's much ""the system"" do, end day person must willing lift finger help stay healthy. even aware take things like lightly. Yes question is, make difference? I‚Äôm plagued anxiety now, scared getting loved one sick.

I minimal memory evacuating wildfire, extremely orderly got everything together, thankfully.

I've also suddenly attacked apparently punched back defend myself, remember person black eye later. remember fight itself. jarring. took ton tranquilizers, don‚Äôt remember thing UK Variant South African Variant Indian Variant Delta Variant Future Variant

What variants common? vaccines able handle every single one them. Lab data *and* real-world data prove it. variant completely evade vaccines, ‚Äúconcern‚Äù really way keep people fearful. least US, third population intends never get vaccinated matter what. types articles don‚Äôt motivate them, purpose serve give us fully vaccinated folks extremely high anxiety it‚Äôs really warranted. things true, kinda. complicated, like anything covid.

The people get breakthrough infections representative general population. likely immune system issues, *very* old, major risk factors.

A healthy 19 year old kid got vaccinated extremely, vanishingly unlikely breakthrough infection.

People vaccinated less likely report sniffles get tested, people breakthrough infections serious ones. BS. live FL. Throughout whole thing I‚Äôve regularly visited many areas (Ft Lauderdale, Tampa, Fort Myers, Orlando, Jacksonville, Universal Disney) everywhere folks followed prevailing wisdom. Sure scofflaws, anywhere else. mean applied tension? hot weather recently poor guys mega rain! Hope brightens blast.  Maybe maybe reason low covid numbers, citizens government took pandemic seriously, masked up, tested, contact traced without whining it. Antibodies whole immunity, T-cells play huge role. 

The cool thing T-cell immunity work like antibodies - evaded T-cells mean better avoiding mine all. 

Antibodies work way described - evades antibodies, likely evade too.

The mRNA vaccines great inducing kinds immunity. shot effects? already mass transit hospitals. nervously babble every time need get shot get blood drawn. try upfront let know fear I'm talkative looking going on. nurse gave two covid shots mentioned seeing fear needles lot younger people. there's reciprocity.  Even number true, vaccinated people minor symptoms going get tested, denominator. 

All available science shows vaccines significantly, significantly curtail death.  super young, early 30s pericarditis two months post covid. days feel fine, days can't stairs apartment without chest pain short breath obvious antivax subreddit would start.

Also, asv.org/education town hall zoom meetings purpose. Undercounting US, China, Brazil, India others easily bring figure 5 million. hate needles always have, never liked getting jab doctor told one I‚Äôve listened, COVID. say covid jab didn‚Äôt even feel go in, know wife feels üò¢ im needle phobic 
It's entire generation family drop dead hearts condtions  
so im death phobic definition **this is** scientific study. sample size irrelevant way know would pull medical records see heart scans time covid hit. believed there. compares risk original strain youth risk myocarditis.

Probably same. seeing myocarditis change virus, increased surveillance. saw myocarditis beginning pandemic athletes. life. 4-5 years ago visited psychologist specialised anxiety disorders. 
I far perfect cool getting better every time. followed really easy steps helped lot. work it, pay off. 
First: Tell people worries. Tell them, afraid might faint. Get shot lying down. 
You notice, might joke take seriously grateful told didn‚Äôt smash ground. 
Doing this, took first step loose fear fear. faint might‚Ä¶ embarrassment surprises. 
Step Two: told people advance, stop fleeing mentally. Concentrate surroundings. 
Like, sitting waiting room. people waiting you. get shot, well prepared. shot necessary because‚Ä¶ on. Talk like would calm convince child like shot. clear you, die. 
Third: avoid situations. flee talk self out. like 10-15 situations past years, Training like said‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm absolutely better. tell people might faint, afterwards seem thing exaggerated. proud I‚Äôm proud well. trust body gain confidence. while, fled move situation. getting less less. 

This worked wish best. guess way really study heart scans large number people getting vaccine see myocardites *is* somewhat common population result range infections/excessive exercise long period time/other conditions, scan 1st 2nd dose see if

a) cause myocardites, amount 

b) makes preexisting myocardites *worse*.

I can't see way figuring out. 

It's study design looking peoples' vitamin levels covid opposed after. side effects thalidomide discovered four years marketed. another day half. usually much better second day. take places - places without humans. Remindme! 14 days rate mutations low, high enough likely occur multiple times infection. well, that's interesting. got pregnant week husband received second dose moderna. first month trying conceive. i'm 33, he's 32, we're exactly young, bit shocked happened first try! wonder something it. half? remind phobia needles?!! put mine forever. straight told tho ‚ÄúI‚Äôm terrified, I‚Äôm gonna look it, give quick countdown damn thing‚Äù bless hearts did. need restrict spread coronavirus mutations take root.

The way long term get people vaccinated. Frankly, I'm getting little tired people romanticizing ordeal.  every infected person potentially creating new variants? No, sorry, we‚Äôve decided COVID needle phobia, looked away getting jab That's half reason got one shredder. They're [giving free vaccinations CTA rapid transit Chicago. sounds pretty convenient. get it! subreddit really shows whats people breaks heart see people get divided wars people vaccinated arent. someone cant get young, social/family/friends pressure think vaccines healthy usually tested atleast 3 years used like widely etc reason die people make fun here. really shows toxic heartless many people here. Look upvotes people keeps saying ""they die anyway"" etc. 


They would also probably look someone crazy say deserved like dont need help like decided someone like that. like life hasnt bad problematic family friends unlucky life. would think people would understanding days since going tough times safely suggest vaccines turn stupid fight. 


""Oh people died wars? shouldnt fought luuul haha. easy dont die haha!""

Either AZ deleted exactly sure things changed EU negotiate without AZ really understanding implications. I‚Äôd say mild needle phobia. treaded Covid vaccine like every vaccine get, look away it‚Äôs seconds.

I also got J&amp;J didn‚Äôt go back suspect would tough.  hate, like absolutely hate getting shots IV‚Äôs put in. Pfizer Covid vaccine barely super quick barely feel it. anxiety 100x worse getting actual shot tummy, upper butt. could get used receiving them, husband still deed. However, gestational diabetes check blood sugar 4x day; gotten used part own. hate needles scared scared dying covid got shots. lol jesus. ""not eating crusts could cause 10% starvation deaths."" Yeah, pretty good. feeling lots got vaccine secret vocal getting vaccinated others. even that. vaccines offer protective rather sterilizing immunity, could still infected fully immunized. probably feel quite OK even infected subject test, run risk getting stranded airport despite vaccination status. mean vacation would ruined forced quarantine hotel 10 days expense? inbound flight start vacation? test positive gate right takeoff, vacation ends even begins, leaving pocket.

I think point enough countries trash requirement fully vaccinated travellers submit suitably recent PCR test result entry. There'll enough people getting plans upended denied entry last minute tested positive despite fully vaccinated.

Imagine something similar flu. amount disruption would make international travel totally unworkable unpleasantly high chance plans derailed despite fully vaccinated got infected enough viral load registered positive test. ???? Taiwanese government contract 10 million doses directly AZ, another 5 million AZ COVAX 5 million Moderna.

They also attempted negotiate 5 million doses BNT, supporting Gou TSMC's attempt secure another 10 million doses BNT.

The issue buy enough vaccines, delivery issues shortages. mean kinda I‚Äôm little worried Ive trouble understanding things since month COVID none doctors taken seriously highly doubt Covid made lab, much less escaped one. happens Resident Evil. Yes know. We‚Äôve also known it‚Äôs awhile Pickachu face we're blaming farts virus? blame dog. much believable. Nice Exactly little fellas due field day stupidsville. Pathetic.

[How U.S. Vaccine Program Progressing nah it. Trudeau wants play politics win next election It‚Äôs weird screaming ‚ÄúSCIENCE‚Äù factual argument people factually false, nearly lol.

I‚Äôve never forgotten one. didn‚Äôt get joke then, don‚Äôt get now, I‚Äôm pretty sure unusually stupid, even them.

But hand I‚Äôll always nail pub trivia questions incident, I‚Äôve got going me. We've spoken little bit subreddit rising cases UK, emergence delta variant...

BTW, I‚Äôm high school math teacher, BS Mathematics. We‚Äôve traded natural life longer life *Cries Australian* What's difference really? They're irrational fears. give needle phobia pass? resistant variant comes unvaccinated could spreading everyone again. That‚Äôs point. Even edit RNA one time test deploy still huge. friend lives alone waited get went home state case side effects.

I another friend lazy got couple weeks ago reason except got around it.

I another friends hesitant waiting reason need (I‚Äôve argued lot they‚Äôre listening.)

I made deal another friend husband go vegan month exchange girlfriend getting vax.

People weird. hate needles thanks multiple ingrown toenail procedures kid. nearly passed blood draw last year. blacked following vaccination. Covid vaccinated. Yes, people lower pain tolerance. believe you. OP, think [this seem placebo arm booster trials. looked distance held breath whole time.

It felt like pinch colder lasting longer.

I hate feeling I'd still take second dose soon get one Interesting logic could case. wonder there's way knowing. Type 1 Diabetics like üòë also condition found young adults prior covid, rarely looked for, becomes trickier say every case vaccine related. Covid also caused disorder young adults athletes twelve year old gets nose bleeds stress waiting needle. rockstar Covid one knows importance. kind believe end everybody finished two sinopharm/vac shots take third shot BioNtech complete ritual. 

I even suspect plan along. get people vaccinated home-grown vaccines first, approve BioNtech vaccines summer, apply 3rd booster shots improve efficacy. Everything considered, China formally reopen border right Winter Olympics. Needle phobia here.

Then someone disreacted games. Manitoba Canada ship dozens patients province ICUs capacity, recent month. 

95% current ICU patients unvaccinated 5% vaccinated long enough build immunity yet. man. future inevitably get worse pandemics, wildfires, pollen, reasons environment become increasingly hostile human health. choice whether want protect not. Also, needs study done cases young people naturally contracted covid 19. One would imagine case rate much, much higher, meaning vaccine far better option. loved episode! People seem asking ""how's possible happened fast taken us long treat \[insert disease\]?"" honestly answer funding, attention, collaboration.

For while, environment absolutely electric; everyone laser-focused anything possible help COVID situation, panned we've gotten gems like this. downside lot weak, ineffective treatments gotten scientific attention (i.e. tocilizumab, extraordinarily expensive work) taken extra time gold come out.

This could definitely useful inflammatory disease - [Here's recent preprint group although exactly OP-101 dendrimer targeting platform same.

Yeah I'll fully protected second half August I'll still keep carefully mask. put life hold 1.5 years catch near end.

Little surprises though, blatant base restrictions overloading hospitals minimize cases (read: economy ). Insanity. hope never another pandemic like lifetimes. suspect asymptomatic cases Covid vaccine caused inflammation, subsequently associated vaccine. One favourite festivals UK. Fingers crossed no/hardly covid cases back this. twist! s/ We‚Äôre back staying home children young vaccinated.  New variant cases twice likely require hospitalization. believe that‚Äôs recommendation, entirely sure reasoning That's calculate effectiveness though, percentage decrease people unvaccinated covid people vaccinated covid seemed kinda person administered it. first shot, dude basically shoved needle far could go. yet every public service announcement newscast shows big fucking needle. bother like needles, can't helpful. thought would actually improve immunity, reality (probably) decomposes finds ribosome.

Etc second read Pfizer *vaccine*. briefly confusing little scary! I‚Äôve always TERRIFIED shots! sadly started semester late college scared get hepatitis vaccine (I eventually did) 

Luckily, husband hold hand cried, lol. kept telling ‚Äúyou protect love‚Äù again! Never truer word spoken. Closure extended another month Yup guess would ODD developmental disorder. source this? wonderful information sure anything Canada there's story two fully vaccinated parents went Hawaii vacation. unvaccinated kid died covid, vacation, hawaii.

:D Modern life surreal absurd general part questioning? Don‚Äôt disrespect ‚ÄòKarp. Seriously, countdown bad. always ask count vaccines able handle every single one them.

But they've mutating resistant strains. Even MRNAs effective Delta variant UK variant Covid classic. They're around [75% effective Delta, according BioNtech's (90-95% UK variant Covid classic). lot breakthrough cases variant (and often become infectious)[1][2]. 

1.  ridiculous. needle phobia drove hour way sticks dummies using allotted supply. Needle phobia generous really is. Pure ignorance. take places outside. Parks, outdoor zoos, walks, etc. Covid transmit outside transmit outside well. long super crowded area, fine. There's need keep kids stuck home outdoor areas available you. Yeah dude playing plague inc game uses DNA points everyone starts expelling intestines mouths. scary? Infuriating can‚Äôt pay people take vaccine America countries begging it.

Fear powerful motivator. problem fearing wrong thing, likely due unscientific stories. claim wasn't... was. 30%? can't serious. know America we're talking 30% believe that?? horrendous think about. Prednisone, I'm tapering. hit 20mg.

Methotrexate Humira  take, don‚Äôt mind asking? take prednisone cellcept &amp; doctors recommended get vaccine, said might work those. harm getting it, getting 2 shots reason. i‚Äôm definitely looking get antibody test soon see actually worked Get vaccinated. Different additives tubes different tests, sometimes samples going multiple labs, samples going different areas within lab. adds up. hold 3.5-7.5 ml too, sometimes multiple vacutainers place lab, though typically run tests one specimen. strange requirement‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt affect me, seems bit arbitrary.  ok feel way. hide it. let run life. checked, 53% least one shot 45% fully vaccinated. never encounter people real life countries you?

It shows. honestly makes sense ease considering tested rigorous compared vaccines.

I'm quite ""afraid"" needles obsess aside whole covid thing, (obviously) like sting much make tense especially needle hits skin. I'm fine long take others me. yeah, arm pain cleared faster time me, brutal first time needle phobia got shot anyway, honestly helpful *know* going hurt know feelings irrational getting worse. I'm fucking terrified injections can't turn off. hard get one without husband usually can't bring let give flu shot doctor's office even though would convenient. Thank taking time write out. know problem due lack leadership worth - sorry going that, people deserve suffer like one since preventable. 

My main confusion numbers remain constantly high Vs India relation assumed would level immunity among population massive infections. 

In India nearly mentality understand, population went wild caused massive spread began stop newly infected rates plummeted however Brazil seeing that. appears newly infected numbers holding steady long time. 

So confused two nations seeing different results type response. must missing something obvious. Nothing wrong tensing up.  got got vaccine like grown-up. here.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Maybe clinics Ativan available? live Broward, still use mask go buy anything store, bad comments, course, sure areas Florida get numbskulls. Another test, different kind may make feel better it, harm anything.

I'll second replies. unlikely he'd infectious then, ever. year listening worst/dumbest takes people , really would enjoy people's deaths. know lot people think makes bad, however really care anymore. That's good, surprising. Florida always pretty loose restrictions vaccination rates high. Yeah long 2nd dose hit for. 1st sore arm. would make sense, really need safety immunogenicity data, efficacy. weird part doc assuming fear sibling. I'm expert that's oddly hilarious. (But probably annoying sister) lot people that. first shot exercising day after. soreness gone time. second shot, developed 102 fever night, broke couple days later. second shot kicked ass. saw 17 somewhere too, corrected repeating it, 6 12 years. plan 18 years, pandemic happened.  Yup. also interesting way showing natural selection works. Thanks, feel like almost everyone know back 100% 48 hours shot sure. surprising based we're seeing places like tarantula metaphor perfect. deathly afraid spiders. Can‚Äôt even watch tv. üò® What's news young'uns? delta variant getting sick? What's news young'uns? delta variant getting sick?  need ashamed. weird phobias. don‚Äôt know anyone isn‚Äôt phobic something whether it‚Äôs snakes, spiders, heights, etc. Imagine level brainwashing, rinsed repeated defensive posture different opinion immediately shot down. Imagine that. Example easy control human being. don‚Äôt needle phobia medicine phobia. Took every fiber go vaccine appointment. close cancelling end sick worried covid. symptoms either shot achy arm laid it. Sure.  funeral pyres India, numerous start cutting trees public parks fuel them? think 60% efficacy roughly 60% population needs vaccinated achieve herd immunity, everyone China need vaccinated order effective. know already got virus antibodies vaccine waste time. like antibiotics. Viruses tend mutate infect people atypical weakened immune systems. 

Vaccinating people even partially keeps virus away people. I'm gonna wait till people get covid covid vaccine suspect reason beyond wanting true? Seems like pure conjecture here. I'm sure people giving others snicker comment, idea Floridians mocking people wearing mask business bullshit. also live rural part South Florida, single person even come close mocking anybody else almost every single person wearing mask. mandate lifted course, masks hit miss. I'm vaccinated wear mask since mandate ended, even heard seen single person give anybody else shit wearing mask. fucks sake. can't nice things? Get vaccinated people keep seeing headlines.  Ok 200 ‚Äúnaturally occurring‚Äù cases vs 300 cases post vaccination would suggest least increase due vaccine. depends Florida, county voted dark red, red, purple, blue, dark blue. I'm dark red land, I'm waiting see happens next. week back visited small local pet store, sign door masks allowed. Go figure. No, sort opposite. Florida‚Äôs leaders trying get people ignore pandemic. Yes give sooner? heads up, want ping someone comment type name like u/hijodebluedemon

How frequently sort entirely ineffective immune response happen viruses? understand difference precise, controlled response spike protein get current vaccines variable response get natural infection. me, though, seems like leap say completely ineffective immune response would occur enough frequency say natural immunity would significant less effective say J+J vaccine? We‚Äôve seen people naturally infected reinfected rate much less 30%, would make natural immunity better J+J preventing infection. 

What immunologist? curious, got degree microbiology always thought would interesting field Except might facility utilize doses. million doses loaves bakery bread sold day-old store. fact Publix exists demographics support building them. nature coast 150 mile stretch (west side Gainesville Tallahassee) Publix. Walmarts, vaccinations (provided customers get stick it). border closure specific US, non-citizen travel globally. There's need take things personally. include tourists people two homes? Convenient. could major issue. nature coast, sizeable numbers people avoiding vaccination. also hospitals speak (nearest hour ride Gainesville). People thinking clearly danger. idea common! I‚Äôm terrified needles feel validated. 

Still got vaccine.  BS. Stop nonsense spreading false narratives. ‚ÄúWide variety reasons?‚Äù Get internet [This NPR mentions typical incidence myocarditis young people. Kids asshole even Singapore government thinks enough probably enough. hits easily rip flesh considered barbaric Amnesty says could considered akin torture. 2-3 days normal thanks info. Mine booked 8 weeks GP (no choice behalf - issue dates provided, 17:00 Friday provides opportunity WFH see parents).  Yes centralized database similar centralized criminal record database. American travel Canada Canadian border officials pull criminal record. 

The US government creating centralized vaccine database, Canadian officials way COVID vaccination status. Apparently talks one two individual states partial system place, that's never going good.  40 choose AZ, places overly cautious.

Anecdotally, mass vac centres offering AZ want (my 19yo sister AZ mass vac centre), get called GP &amp; U40 they'll specify they're giving Pfizer/Moderna (I presume counter anti-vaxx stuff - lot people seen parents rough days AZ, whereas Pfizer generally fewer side effects afaik).  COVID killed dad hundreds thousands people‚Äôs families. maybe empathetic fact life doesn‚Äôt go ‚Äúback normal‚Äù easily lot us. Ron Desantis problem, fact several. order keep state going bankrupt, trying pretend worst over. Florida constitutional requirement deficit spending. Since Florida income tax, state revenue derived sales tax. Florida went lockdown (early 2020) sales tax revenue tanked (partly unprepared food, take home prepare, zero tax rate). dining establishments (only qualify fine dining) stopped generating sales tax. Governor find way keep sales tax flowing, let pandemic come roaring back. Thus far he's behaving like ... *pandemic, pandemic ?* ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è That's probably jab Trump, yet actually sped process preordered hundreds millions vaccines, allowing companies scale production early on. OP talking hospitalization death rates, total infections. numbers vaccinated people getting deathly ill virus statistically miniscule. think operate assumption scarcity. Yea. Pfizer much expensive get bring in. individual level, one would offered choice them, one 95+% efficacy rate asymptomatic covid one (on low end) 51% asymptomatic covid, especially former 100% covid death latter around 98%, people would choose former people believe shit fucking dumb white hillbillies thinking vaccine gonna give Bill Gates microchips Oh didn‚Äôt know that. father got vaccine last week option biontech. got mine april got shot last week two people front fainted fear I‚Äôm guessing. extreme phobia... end anxiety attack pass completely I'm waiting.

Managed get first shot, staff centre great warned could go either way.. could fine, could end floor.

I'm mildly allergic Pfizer side effects awful üò± except first one me. think technician hated me. colleague phobia, allow needle near last 34 years.
He got jab anyway last week, cause. Sadly first dose traumatic. technician terrible job ended hurting bleeding excessively. second one even bleed even feel it. really rare get someone can't properly though. Sinovac vaccine appointments already started thursday. choosen. Actually yes. Usually virus became milder infective kill host quickly. Dead host useful virus. different ways prevent fainting fear! learned ways focused thoroughly stopped fainting needles. Also best thing look. Nervously talking person even letting know fear works, talking makes fear seem much smaller. tensing legs feel fainting sensation stops it. Phobias rational fears, that's phobias.

It's like telling depressed person happy. looks like linked r/CovidVaccinated, focuses anecdotal experiences COVID-19 vaccines. Please aware self-selection bias impact information presented. Individuals negative side effects likely seek communities find support, whereas less likely individuals neutral positive experience.

If looking information vaccines, please check [COVID-19 Vaccine bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There's lot fewer people tested overall.

A lot workplaces colleges, etc. used require regular testing longer vaccinated, fewer ""worried well"" getting tested thanks vaccine too.

The flipside picking fewer asymptomatic mild cases before. Imagine knowing phobia is. Blood tests issue. faint, without fail. cant it. 

The covid jab though? Honestly even know needle gone in. quick. First actually physically knew needle started aching bit next day. Macho-ism. read Cole Beasley‚Äôs tweets see people think vaccine. don‚Äôt believe matters, they‚Äôre better vaccine, rights can‚Äôt force something.  remember beginning people refusing wear masks quarantine folks suggested Covid made people want travel congregate much way certain fungus parasites make hosts try get eaten.  wonder correct all. Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted. It‚Äôs 25g needle. It‚Äôs like equivalent mosquito bite.   Weird. CVS  likely demographic adjustments take account. 12 double vaccinated people died, double vaccinated people majority statistically likely comorbidities make vaccines less effective.

The Astrazeneca vaccine also difficult collect data seems take lot longer reach full effects, meaning protection two weeks second dose may accurate measure efficacy, although still useful public health planning perspective. I'm ""fine"" dentist's novicaine shots terrified regular ones. kid, get baby teeth pulled braces, realize getting shot. thought orthodontist's thumb tool holding pressed really hard gum.

All could see yellow black thing hand looked kind like handle screwdriver. imagined laser end (couldn't bear think truth, guess), named ""banana pen"" head. maybe next time think banana pen numb used pain dentist's thumb holding shit steady, still seems satisfactory today even though obviously know really is.  know first thing lot people two products market compare them, sure numbers way better favor Pfizer, really matter porpoise vaccine reduce deaths, vaccine reduce dramatically deaths hospitalizations? 

My point is, kinda pointless comparing vaccines scenarios like ‚Äúthis one good one not‚Äù important part vaccines reduce deaths, I‚Äôve said, that. 

That leads question, would choose one another, ‚Äúfoolish‚Äù choose one another one? First lot people can‚Äôt choose two. remember vaccinations started, Pfizer covid vaccines country (even USA vaccinated millions day), significant number vaccines consider ‚Äúinferior‚Äù ultimately help reduce deaths. 

Second all, yes, helps reduce chances dying covid, would take vaccines equally, equally help end epidemic. body ready! (If necessary.) Goddamn  Don‚Äôt look direction. got vaccinated twice didn‚Äôt see needle. would want look needle? Honestly much much much better expecting. Really truly barely felt thing. thought told already done. Pretty cool side effect get die kill others. super groovy that. Cruel too. understand hesitancy. absolutely horrendous needle phobia. went drive-thru injection site shot painless brush like nothing, Even impressing myself! told nurse chuckled best one I've yet. 5 minutes later completely black apparently ""mini seizure"" jammed foot gas. Luckily car park, still.

Second time went better. Still absolutely dreaded worth long run. Regarding Delta Variant: pose large threat possibly even force us go quarantine again?  \*intentionally unvaccinated people think people opting vaccine donate someone needy country. opt ever getting done conspiracy theories. Unless pay wasting everyone's time taxes. nurse trying distract me, distraction messed process... already hate small talk, small talk German ten times worse. Nope hell think that? Like people got invite get yearly flushot gp, first shot.ill get second shot end month take 14 days safe. 
In mean time im working store 6 people allowed masks. Next saterday 30 40 people inside without masks. 
Seeing still 8times infections last year seems really weird me. Waste time reading fear factor news. don‚Äôt stay home. losing mask going packed indoor public events might best idea right now. Time tell. said, 2 hospital result. hospital workers mild moderate symptoms bed rest.  earth getting figures 1/4 cases leading long covid? I've heard 10%, tbh, seems far high itself. idiot cousin California says immunity, yet didn‚Äôt get tested got sick self diagnosed getting Covid. I‚Äôm going argue stupid‚Ä¶ I'm guessing someone either wanted funding seen research work? Thank spending time putting together complete, well cited post lot people giving shots nursing students likely giving first real shots ever. surprising aren‚Äôt good that‚Äôs among adults! Thanks. 

The question I‚Äôm curious is, 300 doctors got it, many others unknowingly transmit to? GA. think time eat one time stock freezers arrives here. Moderna shots, I'm taking chances one. thought problem vaccine live something? True, I'd rather get ass kicked. I'd rather doctor waterboard burn arm cigarette vaccinate me.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

It‚Äôs like killing chicken scare monkey Live sword, die sword headline bit misleading. Today everyone born 2003 book appointment. technically everyone can, like opened line everyone one day like Germany. went year year. Thanks data points. That's indeed big difference. That's looking for. vaccinated people got Delta variant get major symptoms it? really weeks would definitely wait Pfizer Moderna. UK data (which best currently have) shows Pfizer 88% efficacy Delta AZ (which similar J&amp;J overall) 60%. agree saying, would spread vaccinated population current vaccines still effective Delta variant? say kind stuff :( want get vaccinated get yet. Like kids 12, even severe asthma.  Exactly. Friend mine severe phobia. panic attack thinking making appointment. One time nurse take multiple chart warnings seriously actually got punched face followed friend trying escape window. even rational thought, non violent, fight flight said get hell German system seems bit chaotic confusing. friend lives northern Germany tried book appointments vax center, impossible, called doctor. secretary said, oh yes, vaccines - maybe get 3 Friday come then. went huge line, thought would never get vaccine. someone came asked vaccine wanted. Turns didn‚Äôt 3 doses 3 types vaccines enough hundreds people even asked people call friends family. 

Here NL almost vaccines given GGD - government health agency, ok website see time place options. might wait 2 3 weeks get 3 options online, call options. 

The vaccination site large conference center. Probably 25 check counters 25 lines vaccination, 3-4 open went. absolutely lines crowds anywhere one busy weeks vaccination. 10 minutes (I cheated bit 15 minutes wait) think backwards. testing vaccines long time. barely understand new virus. We're going enough vaccine 65% population (2 doses) end month/early July. get arms quickly possible would help us get ahead variant. may need late night weekend vaccine clinics. it. time end nightmare all! Yeah, think UK data shows efficacy one dose AZ Delta pretty abysmal - around 30%.

But even 60% great. point, honestly seems irresponsible keep pushing narrative J&amp;J ""just good"". clearly isn't. see arguments both. Germany children doesn‚Äôt really matter nations like Israel lot children (about 30%). 

But end still 30% population virus spread mutate - theoretically. watery, thin, pH neutral

Do translate less pain? got Johnson Johnson yesterday morning. Started fever evening hell since. long take stop fever. can't take another night like that. Unvaccinated choice - I'm you.

I still sympathy unvaccinated circumstance - allergies, lower priority deemed authorities, stuff control. - Astra Zeneca doesn‚Äôt work South African variant. Sinovac doesn‚Äôt seem work well anything. Delta recently infected 4087 killed 25 fully vaccinated people UK. See Table 4. Like young kids can't get vaccine possible repercussions besides death small chance that? Ugh, remember that. imagine poor police officer walking that? Thanks Username check out. I‚Äôm great needles either, think I‚Äôm quite phobic close, get sweaty, clammy hands, shaky etc. docs administering lovely feeling all, little didn‚Äôt even give cotton ball plaster anything. Made difference compassionate staff, honestly rare moment needle part big deal. Hope encourages people get get us lockdown nonsense. wholeheartedly agree! Funny, dude administered first shot extremely fast seemingly careless: sat down, inserted needle without hesitation asked go, within 15s. second time took much longer felt like got stabbed Swiss knife Floridians definitely going inject COVID alligators. That, they'll try inject virus stash drugs. even both. coke. one reason state/federal goals focused adult population. doubt part reaching goals means waiting child approved vaccines. good organization.

Cries German. scares read stuff like that. people need everyday still trouble, chance overcoming it.  belonophobia \* Belgium surprising? bad reputation? last phase production Pfizer (main supplier vaccines atm Europe)? ""Oh, hu-Manatee!""  guess us folks Florida screwed huh? me, except ashamed, would be? joke nurse confirmed majority nervous people young men, quite funny really, nothing wrong that. got 3 pack jammie dodgers knew I'd feel queasy tested mixing astra mRNA either standard protocol Germany. know quite people got astra+Biontech.

Exclusive | Coronavirus: Hong Kong study finds ‚Äòsubstantial‚Äô antibody-level difference BioNTech, Sinovac jab recipients 
Amount antibodies directly reflect individual‚Äôs level protection, researcher notes increasing evidence higher levels generally correspond greater immunity infection 
Objective study estimate incidence natural infections time level population immunity due infections vaccinations

A major Hong Kong study found ‚Äúsubstantially higher‚Äù levels antibodies people vaccinated Covid-19 BioNTech jabs, compared received Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine. 
The presence antibodies sign vaccine working protect individual coronavirus. 
But study‚Äôs findings raised questions government plan shorten quarantine period vaccinated travellers arriving Hong Kong. 
Lead researcher Professor Benjamin Cowling, epidemiologist University Hong Kong (HKU), told Post results also suggested received Sinovac vaccine might need booster shot.

The government-commissioned study conducted HKU‚Äôs school public health involved tracking antibody responses 1,000 people received either vaccine. Supported Health Medical Research Fund, objective study estimate incidence natural infections time level population immunity due infections vaccinations. 
The details findings would published first academic journals, Cowling said. 
‚ÄúWe see substantially higher antibody responses people received BioNTech vaccine, consistent higher levels clinical protection reported large phase-three clinical trial vaccine, compared phase-three clinical trial Sinovac vaccine,‚Äù said.

The German-made BioNTech vaccine reported 95 per cent efficacy rate, mark Sinovac 50.7 per cent.  
Hong Kong administered 3 million doses vaccines residents since late February, comprising 1.7 million BioNTech jabs 1.3 million Sinovac shots. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor top officials received mainland-made vaccine arrived city February. 

Cowling said preliminary findings 100 participants study line efficacy rates published pharmaceutical firms.  
Antibodies proteins generated human body‚Äôs immune system identify neutralise foreign objects coronavirus. presence could indicate prior infection, vaccine working.  
The amount antibodies directly reflect individual‚Äôs level protection, Cowling said increasing evidence higher levels generally corresponded greater immunity infection.  
He explained higher amount antibodies usually took longer dissipate subside, meaning period protection provided vaccine could longer. 

But even antibodies longer detectable, people might still able mount robust defence virus attacked them. 
Cowling said 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, example, elderly people showed signs protection, perhaps exposed similar virus strain young.  
A recent study Chinese University 111 individuals received either Sinovac BioNTech jabs found able generate antibodies Covid-19.  
Lam said administration looking using antibody screening, finger prick blood test, shorten current 14-day hotel quarantine overseas arrivals. 

Government scientific advisers recommended cutting quarantine period seven days vaccinated travellers arriving medium-risk countries if, upon arrival, test positive Covid-19 antibodies negative virus itself.  
Officials also considering separate quarantine waiver fully vaccinated business travellers non-high-risk places Hong Kong‚Äôs Covid-19 situation eased, health experts suggested travellers also clear antibody test.  
Cowling said supported ‚Äúinclusion antibody testing shorten quarantine‚Äù. 
He added: ‚ÄúI think justified offer exemption quarantine fully vaccinated people positive test antibodies negative test virus, low risk infection group.‚Äù 

But noted findings showed could issues rolling antibody tests travellers cases, testing might fail pick small amounts antibodies generated Sinovac vaccine.  
The study results come time city‚Äôs health authorities expected look procuring vaccine supplies provide booster shots improve protection virus. 
Both vaccines available Hong Kong require two jabs.  
Since Sinovac recipients lower level antibodies, Cowling believed study showed need third dose vaccine lengthen protection period people.  
Further research needed determine exact timing effectiveness booster shots, said.  I‚Äôm still waiting Florida overrun Covid statement bear out. article mention it, last read long time ago suggested three doses vaccine would required? still true.  Hungarian biologist invented mRNA vaccine started work approach 1970s.  have! fact learned term Reddit.

Plus, told fainter got shot private area. think it‚Äôs combination needle crowd fact hospital building. really long horrible experience hospital kid. aaaaaaaaaaaall that. contrary, they‚Äôre working full time people require hospitalization due covid, means viral load they‚Äôre exposed way higher normal rate general public test.

Why ""EU"" exports now? happened brexity argument ""companies produce vaccines states (or unions)""?

The mere fact Italy happens EU neither there. European countries sovereign - unlike British ones.

‚ÄúThe reciprocal treatment claimed China also ridiculous,‚Äù Wang said. ‚ÄúHow Chinese citizens live France received Western vaccinations feel it? going prohibited returning China?‚Äù

Wang said believes major EU country, France responsible citizens approving Chinese vaccines, given reports low efficacy lack transparency surrounding data used clinical trials. It‚Äôs also necessary means contain China, regime pushing vaccine diplomacy seeking global dominance taking opportunity pandemic, Wang said.

Erkin Azat, Kazakh journalist living France, praised EU‚Äôs decision approve Chinese vaccines. However, told RFA he‚Äôs concerned EU‚Äôs collective policies eventually breached vaccine diplomacy regime Beijing EU countries participated regime‚Äôs ‚ÄúBelt Road Initiative‚Äù infrastructure plan receiving large loans China, approved Chinese vaccines. [2]

Current regulations require Chinese nationals provide ‚Äúcompelling reasons‚Äù enter France quarantine seven days arriving, granted entry.

The official website Chinese Embassy France issued announcement June 14 remind Chinese citizens new French regulations. staff member Chinese Embassy France told Radio Free Asia (RFA) Beijing implement ‚Äúreciprocal sanctions,‚Äù is, French people enter China, China won‚Äôt recognize vaccination non-Chinese vaccines.

Mainland Chinese media reported regime‚Äôs retaliatory measures France June 15, adding travelers France required quarantined upon arrival 28 days, much longer France requires Chinese nationals. reports claimed China-made vaccines weren‚Äôt accepted France EU political reasons, even abeen approved World Health Organization (WHO). reports said regime‚Äôs retaliation would ‚Äúteaching France lesson.‚Äù

France-based current affairs commentator Wang Longmeng told RFA believes China‚Äôs retaliation intended stir nationalist sentiments among Chinese. pointed that, one representatives regime‚Äôs ‚Äúwolf diplomacy,‚Äù Chinese ambassador France, Lu Shaye, frequently criticized Western countries calls investigation origins COVID-19. criticism also posted Chinese Embassy‚Äôs official website.

The Chinese Embassy France continually posting comments social media attempt sway public opinion West. blocked EU backing

The EU permitted - saying EU infringe upon national sovereignty - forcing Italy stand vaccines exported Italian factories population died covid rates similar suffered incompetent British?

The UK blocked exports implementing measures equivalent quantitative restrictions - EU never blocked anything (merely permitting Italy freedom check news!

Only British propaganda press suggested EU blocked - part war Europe - proving enemy status That‚Äôs super interesting. [1]

When European Union starts ‚ÄúEU Digital COVID Certificate‚Äù program July 1, Chinese regime‚Äôs embassy France says retaliate bloc‚Äôs decision exclude Chinese-made vaccines system implementing tighter regulations French travelers seeking enter China.

All EU member countries, well Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, included program, streamline information COVID-19 health status travelers, test results, recovery status, vaccination status, help move efficiently around bloc‚Äôs member countries, differing entry requirements.

Chinese-made vaccines aren‚Äôt included program, haven‚Äôt approved use European Medicines Agency (EMA). However, EU member states, Greece, Cyprus, Hungary, Serbia, individually accepted Chinese vaccines. Russian-made vaccines also aren‚Äôt recognized program.

The creation digital certificates approved EU Parliament June 9. certification includes QR code issued individual EU nations. EU countries required recognize certificates issued EU countries.

In line EU‚Äôs decision, France implemented new entry regulations COVID-19 June 9. People vaccinated longer need provide ‚Äúcompelling reasons‚Äù enter France, need quarantined. Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines approved France.

In addition, France divides world three epidemic zones: green, orange, red. China listed orange area. True. Brazilian numbers really great! Especially, considering current (federal?) president.

I'm sure Pfizer/Moderna shown high efficacy rates, Oxford vaccine Covaxin( indigenously developed India) working well prior variants. ones dying (fully partially vaccinated) old sick anymore. Even fully vaccinated ex chief medical association, either old sick, succumbed covid year. Strawman. fact remains, admit,

1) UK exported vaccines,

2) EU blocked exports.

Both undeniable true. HALF GERMAN POPULATION RECEIVED LEAST ONE DOSE VACCINE     Nope, blocked EU backing. EU even admitted it! check news! EU block bion/Pfizer vaccines realised relied ingredients exported UK make vaccines, AZ UK different. Unlike people here.

The EU blocked exports, UK didn't. Sorry, facts.  exported vaccines Australia cover ones blocked EU.

Unless believe UK time machine, spoofing - since UK exported Australia starting February 2020 (so obviously arrangements made January/early February 2020 Italian ban march confuse UK AZ, EU Biontech. Companies countries (or political organisations) same.

It‚Äôs hard sympathy willingly don‚Äôt vaccinate, sympathy can‚Äôt don‚Äôt access.   airline  Distancing masking ""very small"" changes, cause major disruptions industry least major cultural shift since non-verbal facial cues incredibly important American culture.

Zero states keeping mandate, why? can't assume it'll get worse like are, operate information given, right many scientists said see kind rapid spread seen fall.

There always reason keep around making policy thing clearly happening. vaccinated one entire department? don‚Äôt disagree you, it‚Äôs apples apples like that. instance, covid 2% chance causing issue, vaccine 1% chance, can‚Äôt say ‚Äúwell vaccine lower it‚Äôs less risk‚Äù. 100% chance getting vaccine, &lt; 100% chance getting covid. think tactic based effectiveness difference first &amp; second doses. 1st gives 50% effectiveness 2nd, default, less effective. giving 2 people single shot 50%+ creates greater reduction spread single person 2 shots 90%.

I suspect probably that, kinda makes sense little mind. Around 70-80%. good two, better nothing. Fully vaccinated Canadian citizens tho, big caveat. think that‚Äôs anxiety general lol Ya lol definitely factored mine well, thing, sat looked straight

But honestly didn‚Äôt feel anything, surprised said already done representative huge parts US.  live incredibly easy get vaccine local CVS Walgreens.  many places US easy get vaccinated nearby. helps anyone fence reason, feel either shots /at all/. always look away genuinely notice done nurse putting bandaid arm. this!

Yup, everyone agreed. tasted ok. like farts all! anyone know Moderna vaccine approved 12-15 year olds?  know. (Representational Picture)

Seriously? comes shit? EU bought vaccines together, distributed evenly population. since still less vaccine around infrastructure logistics countries could easily handle, little difference speed vaccines get used, numbers unsurprisingly similar. Possibly. There‚Äôs enough information know people dying. Sometimes older person sick vaccine work minority chosen get vaccinated, haven‚Äôt got round it.

Old people sadly tend die without COVID, way AIDS patients die disease would harmless healthy person.

What know that, despite faster spread greater risk hospitalisation due new variant, fewer people dying before. reason vaccines. Anything beyond needs analysis meaningful. yet biggest province Canada unfortunately still going restrictions come fall LOL. It‚Äôs going never end What‚Äôs got de needles thou?

Is really safe hanging drinking beers people bar (outside) example? want most, I'm bit anxious tbh. saying countries, like Germany, separate statistics saying many people fully vaccinated, many people received first shot.

Because way statistics compiled, J&amp;J vaccine used negligible numbers Germany, people received J&amp;J vaccine might show columns: column fully vaccinated, one received first shot. skews numbers ever slightly (in completely negligible manner).

---------

The *other*, entirely separate issue /u/lollylan mentioned, fact Germany, people recovered Covid within past 6 months vaccinated (with AZ Biontech) once, twice, effect same: shot basically works like second shot people, original Covid infection representing first jab. practice also something might possibly skew numbers, much, apply many people. fine 24 hours. Yeah, nothing far. good vaccine though. Yes, country would wise address problem pandemic after. still need select people way going risk makes sense select people randomly. Samething happening US recognizing AZ vaccinated people Mods, apologies breaks rules amateur research. think worthwhile discussion issue rarely discussed and, knowledge, never quantified before.

For record, I'm amateur, work one top economic institutions country. also think worth listening perspectives disabled like might early insights. 

The consequences policymakers aware economic impacts long covid could catastrophic, including leading decade stagflation.

They serious enough take several weeks write post, despite quite severely limited mental stamina due illness. skip firsts?! odd approach. Hi all,

as someone covid (and still lot antibodies), vaccine take? choose Pfizer, Sputnik, Sinopharm, AstraZ. 

I'm slightly afraid side effects, esp. read people already covid bit 'harsher' response. 

If 'were' shoes, would do? recovered covid November 2020, 14 days fever (\~38c pretty much time) home (nothing serious, lungs-serious). Actually currently Europe vaccinating quicker US (i.e. Europe catching up). Production took time ramp up, seems Europe region really exporting start. gather place would like travel to? Google. what? Auto makers make money selling cars, make go work, etc. deserve get money providing vital product. going become worry case. thinking problems travel big mistake making. possibly part start clogging hospitals, causing worse variants emerge :(. guess true can't fix stupid. 20% number skyrocket next weeks like 1st dose past two months Canada 66% 16% received second shot. (total 82%)
Germany 50.6% 30.4% received secon shot. (total 81%)

Canada started slower, April caught Germany.

Germany slowing either. messaging vaccines work? Yes. major depression since 15 years. Also social phobia, sleep apnea, panic attacks, anxieties, high blood pressure, tinnitus, immune system mess, kinds skin issues healing months infections, acne, fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrom, guess else...

I didnt go doctor anymore since 3 years though anymore, wanted tried hard push pandemic started since then... couldnt go anymore.

For depression never went psychiatrist anymore 4 years dont contact anymore them, felt bad going anymore didnt lead anything years. went 3 years every months sitting crying, couldnt talk anything really.

So dont recent attestation depression. would need find new doctor first kinda ""beg"" one, dont energy that. Canada following (as call them) UK protocols‚Äî- give everyone first shot give second. Relative Canada first Pfizer shot March, second scheduled end July. rescheduled beginning July, able call second last week. Key points

Around 12 35% covid patients still symptoms fatigue month infection. condition known long covid. 4 7 million Americans likely contracted already.

Long covid severely disable people point entirely housebound bedbound. get worse people try exercise beyond capacity.

Most long covid patients longer work full time work all. 1.7 4.9% labour force could forced work part time 0.55% 1.6% could forced stop working altogether.

This could negative shock labour market larger global financial crisis (GFC). GFC caused around 3.1% workforce work part time 1.6% leave work force. took decade labour market recover GFC.

Unlike GFC, permanent decrease labour supply. would turn shrink potential size economy lead inflation. economy may never recover gains unless effective treatment found long covid.

No one yet quantified economic impact, masked many major economic events happening now. labour market shortfalls covid exposed industries provide evidence long covid already impact.

Because unforeseen event, could force central banks unexpectedly slam brakes early, abruptly slowing economy. might avoided governments provide support persons already unemployed temporarily jobs long covid patients get better.

We pretty much made smart decisions tho, governments pretty much top making sure vaccination centers running early.

Even covid certificate app quite amazing. hear german guys covid cert, really lucky. Seems like lot words say 50%  Ok cool, thanks explanation. I'm trying get story straight. opinion medical professionals refusing vaccine? I'm sure numbers changed, remember interview Fauci said half org vaccinated. I'll look newer numbers, absolutely sure safe?

I've already vaxxed, convince me, find interesting everyone skeptical vaccine gets branded idiot, may may accurate.  common cold Covid (did seriously compare Covid common cold, WTF?).

Survivership bias. 99% cases delta vacinatino environment hostile enough less infectious variants survive.   Let's make sure sad, lonely death protect dying. I'm wondering myself. sitting saying take vaxx FDA approved/hasn't tested/etc, yet data says it'll kill two years? trust science, trust science? easy getting vaccinated Europe.

Eh, say Belgium.

We right track like 75% vaccinate end month. (first shots)

I'm 31 got mine yesterday.

They mid 20's next week too...  Seems interesting promising! I‚Äôm expert assume natural spices seem help worth try. It‚Äôs thing U.K. unless lose record forget first time, give whatever.

So would compare COVID Spanish Flu? IFR CFR? Thanks lot, good day.

But kids without risk factors current experience covid like cold (disclaimer: **not** case adults, know please get vaccinated, like did). severity could change new variants like Delta read anything like that.

So vaccinating children makes sense society whole every adult vaccinated, necessarily children themselves. need, people take extra doses another vaccine countries recognise ones people given.

Sure, protect death hospitalisation mRNA vaccines higher chance preventing catching COVID *at all*. they're extorting people health systems USA developing world. India large country many states.

And that, could happen supply suddenly larger second doses due time schedule. So...will shorten interval happens?   know countries count differently. 

Yup, Spain excess deaths officially reported covid deaths, Germany way around. means reality gap two even let's talk winter/spring. Covid numbers, deaths. death anything masks?

**Some vaccine experts second thoughts rushing inoculate kids**

By¬†Melissa Healy | Staff Writer¬†

June 18, 2021 3 PT

From earliest days pandemic, doctors public health officials seen widespread vaccination effective way stop COVID-19 tracks. growing contingent medical experts questioning whether conventional wisdom ought apply children.

Their doubts borne conspiracy beliefs, couched carefully calibrated language risk benefit. they‚Äôre expected get public airing next week advisors Centers Disease Control Prevention ponder spate post-vaccine heart problems adolescents young adults.
No one arguing COVID-19 immunizations kids stop altogether. Rather, debate erupted need inoculate healthy children soon possible according two-dose regimen authorized Food Drug Administration.

The vaccines made Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna administered safely millions adults vetted several thousand adolescents. neither subjected exhaustive testing diverse pediatric populations, typically required vaccine intended universal use kids.

The FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine emergency use adolescents young 12 May 10. weeks followed, safety monitoring systems managed FDA CDC detected dozens cases possible side effect newly vaccinated teens: inflammation heart muscle known myocarditis.

The cases typically developed older adolescents, boys, three four days got second dose. Virtually considered mild, presenting chest pain tightness resolved treatment over-the-counter medications. None patients appear died suffered serious cardiac malfunction, though it‚Äôs early know whether suffer long-term effects.

As June 10, government‚Äôs vaccine monitoring systems detected 226 cases myocarditis related condition called pericarditis vaccination people younger 30. Normally, fewer 100 cases would expected age group, said Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director CDC‚Äôs Immunization Safety Office.

More investigation needed determine whether vaccine caused heart problems timing merely coincidence, said.

Dr. Paul Offit, pediatrician vaccine specialist Children‚Äôs Hospital Philadelphia, said reports give CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee Immunization Practices opportunity ‚Äúgive people clinic relative risk‚Äù ‚Äî COVID-19 vaccine made Johnson &amp; Johnson linked rare blood-clotting disorder younger women still deemed safe use.

Offit said doubts myocarditis cases upend long-standing certainty kids vaccinated quickly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd give child second,‚Äù said.

Others aren‚Äôt sure. possibility children getting vaccine ‚Äî especially second dose ‚Äî could put hearts risk amplified calls debate parents, schools others embrace conviction healthy children need get vaccinated.

It‚Äôs prospect surprise side effect prompted sudden surge vaccine caution.

As pandemic appears winding across United States limited toll children tallied, it‚Äôs longer clear immunizing children bring outbreak faster close, said Dr. Martin Makary, public health expert Johns Hopkins University.
Makary urging colleagues ‚Äúthink twice‚Äù recommending universal COVID-19 vaccination healthy kids. Given data hand, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs compelling case right now,‚Äù wrote month MedPage, website widely read physicians.

In interview, Makary said concerns might allayed thorough examination safety data.
‚ÄúBut one thinking like this,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve converted pro-vaccine vaccine fanaticism.‚Äù

Given general decline new infections hospitalizations, there‚Äôs time thorough FDA vetting vaccines children adolescents, Makary said. Even takes months, could wind protecting children harm.
The emerging debate threatens divide community that‚Äôs largely united pandemic.

From moment first COVID-19 vaccine started going Americans‚Äô arms, one certainty seemed almost beyond questioning: soon enough doses available, nation‚Äôs children would roll sleeves.

There strong arguments position too.

Although it‚Äôs clear COVID-19 largely spared children severe illness, CDC says 456 American kids died disease, though considered conservative estimate.

At least 20,000 ‚Äî many 100,000 ‚Äî kids hospitalized COVID-19. Indeed, CDC reports even adult hospitalizations declined March April, rate adolescents admitted ticked upward. Nearly one-third treated intensive care units, undercutting argument severe illness rarely happens age group.

COVID-19‚Äôs toll children also lingers well beyond bout infection. mid-May, least 4,018 U.S. developed condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome children, MISC, frequently appears four six weeks child cleared infection typically requires hospitalization.

Myocarditis common sick children, roughly 1% die.

If COVID-19 disease seen children, statistics would galvanize medical professionals public health officials find way protect them, New York pediatrician Dr. Risa Hoshino wrote MedPage commentary sparked part Makary‚Äôs views.

By definition, COVID-19 emergency nation‚Äôs children FDA‚Äôs emergency use authorization ‚Äúappropriate pathway‚Äù getting vaccines young Americans, added.

At Children‚Äôs Hospital Los Angeles, pediatric cardiologist Dr. Jodie Votava-Smith seen wreckage COVID-19 firsthand, doubts value vaccinating kids.
In last month, helped treat patient developed myocarditis dose vaccine, said. child‚Äôs symptoms mild readily treated ibuprofen.

Votava-Smith said assessment vaccines‚Äô value profoundly shaped dozens children treated CHLA serious heart muscle inflammation result COVID-19. children severely ill face potentially enduring health effects. disease cause misery, said, vaccine.
The mother two children 5 7, Votava-Smith said ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait‚Äù get vaccinated. ‚ÄúThey know they‚Äôll getting shot it‚Äôs turn,‚Äù said.

Dr. H. Cody Meissner, Tufts University pediatrician advises FDA vaccines, said it‚Äôs mistake evaluate COVID-19 vaccines children way cleared emergency use adults.

‚ÄúThe risk calculation vaccinating adult pretty easy,‚Äù said. many 4,000 adults day dying COVID-19, ‚Äúeven little risk vaccine, people would accept that.‚Äù
But children, said, ‚Äúthe calculus bit different.‚Äù Although seem contract coronavirus pretty readily, they‚Äôre far less likely adults get sick die. even instances post-vaccination myocarditis rare, still change risk-benefit analysis.

‚ÄúThe data sufficient say benefit COVID-19 vaccines outweighs risk children adolescents,‚Äù Meissner said. ‚ÄúWe may get there. we‚Äôre now.‚Äù

I happy take J&amp;J instead. covidactnow.org, state, already counties infection rates higher ever recorded counties. One would think Florida would hit 'herd immunity' thing. Typically long waiting list, 1-2 weeks future. write 2 doctors once, well, luck.

I tried every day online portal 10 days got appointment week. I‚Äôm *very* pro-vaccine, numbers nearly meaningless reflect poorly mathematical literacy society.

To illustrate why: could correctly say 950 fatalities among unvaccinated MN since early March. That‚Äôs death rate 0.03%. mortality rate actually 20x higher that. It‚Äôs 3 month period, many people infected.

But isn‚Äôt relevant. mortality rate covid much higher that. issue analysis isn‚Äôt taking account people get sick given 3 month window time.

I‚Äôll also note 0.03% determined assuming everyone fully vaccinated today also fully vaccinated early March. bad assumption, tried carefully, calculated percentage would get even smaller. Isn‚Äòt main reason China let Taiwan anything independent state, cannot sell state directly? usually say half first person half second person. Sorry call BS - maybe random users, certain political individuals screaming even delivery schedules set.

If knew /r/CanadaCoronavirus months ago, there's reason would known too. US managed vaccinate faster Alpha variant spread, also due lucky Alpha variant arriving later Europe. cause case rises Michigan, though. Europe third wave caused Alpha variant though. Ok beginning belgium federal government, divided flemish one, wallonia, french community, bruxelles federale gov. got divided lot protest flemish side federal gov completely french. bc negotiations flemish give something return autonomy, seats proportionally money Yeah, basically EU countries within 5% total doses, though variation much priorize getting 2nd doses out. wife really bad experience 6. rolling veins training nurse try draw blood. training nurse really hard time trying get vein ended collapsing vein wife's arm. 6 year old, that's traumatic enough experience cause lifelong fear.

And Pok√©mon bandages, extremely sensitive skin lot bandages straight pull skin try remove them, even try use rubbing alcohol. find kids bandages generally cause issue, love Pok√©mon chose get those. bag got covid shots, pulled one wife cute silly gesture distract needle.

I really explain though. People fears people allowed interests enjoy things. find much immature somebody look somebody else enjoying something somebody fun things like. fun like judge others like. Yeah, unnamed doctor says, great source. Sounds much like typical anti-vaxx propaganda (and record, I'm fully vaccinated Sputnik V without issue, except one day elevated temperature 2nd dose). Aggregate community risk. Perhaps care someone can‚Äôt vaccinated. Perhaps care human incubators spinning genetic roulette table get vaccine resistant strain kill thousands more.

People rights well good starts mucking people‚Äôs life.  article posted say 30% vaccinated people get variant die. saying small number *had* died England, 30% vaccinated. There‚Äôs very, big difference. form coronavirus anywhere near 30% death rate, let alone vaccinated people.

Definitely hoping that's case none plasmids become persistent. considered setting outside ATMs too? first US much sequencing, least much UK. That‚Äôs UK knew new infections delta variant. could even dominant variant US. Remindme! 14 days Im done vaccination since mid febuary, didnt benefits far. Bit im glad im done. part media disinformation campaign China. 

Western media loves mentioning China, projecting exceptionalism crucifying communist country.

Especially since China (any many countries region) handled COVID far better west . take look there, thanks. dont car though, move around 2-5km per feet around live. work? doesnt say anything vaccination search specific doctor. it?

Just checked samedi. Zero doctor platform around 5km radius live. state spring uptick well (Illinois) caused us delay reopening month, fairly decent vaccine uptake blunted getting bad. Completely untrue. one gives shit one way other.

Just wear mask either unvaccinated feeling sick. whatever makes feel comfortable sit around judging others. You‚Äôre aware UK didn‚Äôt even start vaccinating 30s *two weeks* ago, right? people about, pubs, gathering. course Delta spread there. We‚Äôre already miles ahead vaccinating 12-30s. parts world people may get first dose you‚Äôre concerned long term effects Covid? Whether mild disease severe, morbidities horrible. immune system would permit that. got second dose 3 weeks ago. 
I got Astra first second Pfizer.
And basically opened since daily infected around 200 country. Delta variant isolated county live.

Mask helps still many still use vaccination. thought also wearing mask since helps body used ""maybe"" ""small amounts virus maybe floating around"" community opening.

Its summer damn warm. wear glasses sometimes gets foggy warm use mask. circumstances still wear mask drop totally?  Complete suppression realistic restrictions lifted countries international travel starts increasing. Even Israel probably going see uptick cases near future international visitors start arriving pre-pandemic pace. Germans vaccinated? odd ones even ones?

Not saying statement western bias isn‚Äôt incorrect, case comes Pro-China newspaper. Western PA. worn mask least month. people (80%?) stopped.  leader told jump cliff obeying orders. mostly injection pain. Pinning virgin muscle hurts. Putting foreign oil active medical ingredients hurts. Remember vaccine literally shooting fancy oil directly muscle tissue people down-voting comment?! 
This reality let‚Äôs face it‚Ä¶ long-term effects vaccines? seems partially reluctant (got first jab Pfizer last Saturday) makes full blown conspiracist. guess Danish soccer player got cardiac arrest double vaccinated met side-effects.
I‚Äôve zero side effects first jab, except heart rate going 60 rest 130 bed second third day. I‚Äôm around 40 perfect shape. around COVID infected without catching myself. 
My take is: know nothing yet. best shot (pun intended!) get least one jab wait‚Ä¶ reason period jabs prolonged one week week Sweden. Friend got vaccinated one week wait 6 weeks, 7 weeks week after.

Edit: got Pfizer, Moderna. I'd like learn going really, make valid point. Geographically Russia part located Asia.  tell India Yes, said choice, take sinovac. choice, take Pfizer.

For example, friend's elderly father preexisting conditions living HK. well educated spends retirement watching lot Chinese state media television.

He convinced get sinovac vaccine ""Western one changes DNA something different.""

I told friend tell take Pfizer. same?

If choice, one clearly better other. think makes sound people vaccinated?

At least that's first impression Florida AKA God's waiting room. covid 19 delta!  frustrating live one non-reopened places entire US. Oregon reopen get 70% vaccinated we‚Äôre 68.5% right now, daily rate slowing more. difference safety 68.5 70 nonexistent. Feels like it‚Äôs never going fully here. Yeah old turn radio up, hear unusual noise car, trick  People carry umbrellas lower accident rate non umbrella carriers. insurance companies send umbrellas costumers? Depends Israel allows travellers countries low vaccination levels (i.e. countries also suppressed Covid). 

Certainly case simply banning people high prevalence countries, least insist vaccination test. Ignore pretend happening probably. Well AZ + Pfizer changes nothing planning going anyway. However glad see event organizers including approved vaccinations too. make little sense allow one dose J&amp;J attendees two dose AZ attendees. reason give corona infection rather harmless kids without risk factors studies vaccine sideeffedts kids rather underpowered.

And yet sister still believes vaccine bad. Sounds plausible since official numbers 86% effective first shot 94% second (Moderna/Pfizer). Geographically, much so.  problem Johnson vaccine apply vaccines people already 'rona can't REALLY tell many people completely vaccinated easily.  compare Golf Ford witch case AZ. already know mRNA best compare AZ vaccines? 100% second persons vaccinated!

Meaning greater share Black Latino population got approved one vaccines month ago obviously 12 still can't vaccinated. hurts like 1% expect, tbh (coming someone needle phobia) That's person said ""fictional fantasy"". Lol think would happen *really* well needles. Like, go grey keel I'm sitting down. (My favorite experienced phlebotomist saying ""I've never seen anyone go quite grey!"")

For shots, let RN giving ahead time this, made sure sitting comfortable chair, looking away, making small talk. Afterwards sat ~5 mins, RN checking fine went general monitoring section. 2nd one even easier.

Obviously everyone's different I'm far worst terms reactions, least problem-free could be.

Also, good consider many shots/needles would getting get vaccine, get serious case Covid, go ICU.

Well, risk dying, *just* infecting loved ones. watch needle go skin. watch others get sorts procedures. reaction like 15-30 seconds later. seems comment contains 1 links hard tap mobile users.

While media attention focused Covid variants, real problem return typical winter colds/flus. Due Flu barely spreading last winter, creating effective flu vaccine may difficult season. immune systems may also little vulnerable diseases winter since many country colds/the flu relatively speaking.

I might date vaccination statuses there, maybe mostly two dose now. think also used vaccine lost ground delta Israel US used. delta R=4, vaccine 60% effective, well, gonna spread fine fully vaccinated population. well unvaccinated one, much less carnage, it'll grow.

Need talk doc soon. 100% Sure would nice get data J&amp;J need booster thing really takes off‚Ä¶ Forgive i‚Äôm misunderstanding, isn‚Äôt virus mutates becomes contagious also make less deadly? point virus mutating means trying survive reach hosts. However said, usually means deadliness factor, will, decrease deadly, would kill people quickly spread people usually quarantined hospital usually either die recover. Again, misunderstanding please enlighten better understanding. equivalent someone asks directions point random direction want deal it? assuming everyone well enough able stay home unwell. everyone financial position, however much would like be. Right? barely registered sensory level. always going happen big developed nations like EU. Look combined industrial output scientific knowledge Germany, France, Benelux Northern Italy. That's 3/4 blue banana right there. EU wanting British output way around never understand. they'd taken effective approach start, think they'd ahead behind.
The main difference EU lot people, percentage always going slower, development production lagged I'll never know. Yes aware realize less 20% Canadians fully vaccinated even fewer waited two weeks second dose. Also, UK way natural immunity since hit much worse virus less susceptible population. virus could start spreading quickly enough Canadians fully vaccinated. good news Canadian officials cautious reopening border kids school right now.

Is safe assume it‚Äôll fine travel still allowed? Obviously know one predict future, I‚Äôd like opinions book anything. less year, knew Covid long term issues. believe thought process shortsighted dangerous. I'm going take bet.

I looked CDC data hospitalizations, admittances, % ER visits COVID related. show resurgence peaking April steady decline that. yeah, probably still clearing backlogs death certificates.

My State dump 100 death certificates going back several months, since broken reported deaths recent, 30 days old. UK schedule 2nd shot getting first Given good chunk population believes Covid plot Trump, sounds like good idea. Doesn‚Äôt change numbers vaccine doses delivered next six weeks.

You‚Äôre projecting harder IMAX, homie. always fussy nap? asking you?  must troll mate. simply asking question. thread must full trolls get themselves. bet people commenting live mums basement eating fucking slaw. porkers supposed discussion anyone hesitant vax?

What information present? whatever. Even EU admits blocked exports refusing grant AZ licence export. Italy didn't, EU did. facts. AZ said so, Australia said so, even EU said so.

Australia said Italy, Italy said Italy, BBC every major news organisation said Italy. difficulties understanding English aside, EU merely confirmed stand way Italian decision.

The EU directive confirms member states make decisions (as confirmed Osborne Clarke British law firm).

You one living hateful fantasy land detached reality (aka Brexit Britain soaking Brexity lies). 
However least hope refuse acknowledge British genocides EU behave like British. Big true would great everyone got vaccinated gonna happen? Probably not. need consider measures like requiring masking stores again, sending everyone N95s at-home tests. Nobody wants shutdowns doubt happen simpler measures do.  don‚Äôt think Britain (or anyone) seeing endgame yet. 

Delta variant cases continue rise read 73 deaths delta variant, half vaccinated people least 14 days second jab (in fact large percentage half 21+ days since second jab). 

No data offered terms health factors deaths, vaccine programme still results percentage deaths seems like it‚Äôs long way over. 

And Britain one highly vaccinated countries. Delta variant outbreaks major risk nations without advanced vaccination programme. 

And there‚Äôll next variant ‚Ä¶ also probably going difficult achieve high enough uptake vaccines, given UK seems reluctant vaccinate children covid. least 3 vaccinated people Florida okay. There‚Äôs way get unvaccinated wear masks unless they‚Äôre required everyone. cases start climbing may happen. need get new one mostly fall refresh. It‚Äôs much harder get Covid you‚Äôve fully vaccinated even harder transmit it, stop fear mongering  read somewhere 200+ % percent contagious original variant. Obviously vaccinated country going restrictions extent though. repercussions Florida‚Äôs policies obscured this. threw open doors Covid tourists ignore spread tourists. I'd bet large sum money reporting anomalies. Consistently across us states across countries, deaths reliably rise fall 3 weeks lagged cases - sort breaking states huge winter surge. There's good reason believe cases could fall, positive rate could fall, hospitalizations could fall, deaths could fail fall.

This issue US whole right now, known many states reporting backlogged deaths reported occurred. state KY certainly issue, deaths rates mirror cases spring, reported chunks rate swinging wildly even cases steadily declined. Wait strokes? smack around cane? Portugal masks numbers early Germany friends still struggling aghast ... finishing crunching CDC numbers rural counties corner state. Ignoring ages 0-11 (which presumably vaccinated), percentage **NO** vaccination jabs Gilchrist 70.0%, Levy 59.9%, Dixie 67.3%.

There words properly describe *can't happen me* attitude here.

CDC county-by-county vaccination numbers available nationwide via page map  3-4 million India alone seems bit excessive. One million entirely possible, hand. think taking individualism entirely new level. I'd even argue needs name beyond individualism extreme is. Lets open provinces well. Again: immune system would permit that. isn‚Äôt untested hypothesis. Viruses introduce foreign DNA cells DNA producing proteins, cell destroyed.

I recommend watch online immunology course. You‚Äôll understand understanding antidote fear. lot people can't get vaccinated well medical reasons. there's that. partner also afraid needles. vasovagal syncope response (blood pressure drop fainting). caught hit ground supported head looked like tiny, short seizure vomited little after. required take ambulance E.R. recovered within half hour, really wiped rest day following day.

Having almost die Covid last year made push past phobia.  ever get feeling like every atom body vibrating like highest setting hitatchi magic wand? feel like case ""you know get it."" long Covid, pain fatigue associated different anything I've felt before. normally loathe needles say, COVID shot fast relatively painless, like, wait minute, it? time registered bit pain, already over. first shot, felt literally nothing second shot fast little pinch. nothing compared heavy arm shoulder pain got days though. :P  same. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna I'm old kinda sucks knowing soon lol.  Lollll exact same, felt small sting exepting feel bit done. Luckly blood band aid good lmoa also forgot watch lol car home feel bit weird feel inmy arm alrighy Depending grade think 1 2 weeks. extended year   think meant people vaccinated choice. know care deniers anti-vaxxers much.  Germans: ""You Americans use archaic measurement systems, switch metric.""

Also Germans: ""We choose describe ratios metaphorical sequence counting one time, instead percentages, metric system fractions.""  Im downplaying phobia, phobias own. Im telling experience try supportive. Previously fit &amp; active individuals suddenly struggling basic things like shower go food shopping, sometimes winding bedridden recover exertion. Dismissing everyday common fatigue dishonest needs end.

You described depression perfectly. many hypothesizes entertained comment reads like crusade. east African country, like African peers left relatively unscathed first wave.

Not really true. There's monitoring. True. irony telling people vaccinate kids unneccessary, youngest son probably vaccinated alongside him. Sucks first persons  pile crap. I've waiting list months Bayern got lucky (first vaccination Monday), I'm someone priority group 3. know others waiting priority group 3. remember afraid needles child. got rationalizing little sting last brief seconds I've experienced pain life several times harsher little sting. random cut finger cooking lot painful days little needle arm.

However, take lot sequencing get rough estimate dominant variants country. Even sequencing 100 samples tell certain variant extremely dominant, barely present somewhere between.

The Alpha variant first discovered UK likely emerged there. Since Alpha transmissible variants competing with, eventually countries Alpha introduced saw compete existing variants. know Alpha became dominant UK well became dominant elsewhere. strongly suggests present UK first. detected early, thanks abundant sequencing, change matter.
