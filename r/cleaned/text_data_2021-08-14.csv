‚ÄúThe 20 percent Icelanders didn‚Äôt get vaccinated haven‚Äôt already COVID ones catching Delta, exception breakthrough cases vaccinated people. (Children 16, aren‚Äôt yet eligible vaccination, make unvaccinated group.) couple thousand people tested positive recent weeks, spike cases far exceeding worst weekly case-rates 2020.

But hospitalizations surged degree cases latest Icelandic surge. That‚Äôs older Icelanders, group, highly vaccinated.

Australia uses Polish mRNA doses younger population, AZ risky option, return donates AZ countries still vaccinating older age groups? know difficult understand especially someone comes relatively small island nation. I'll try explain bit maybe see something like would never fly here.

The US founded group people fleeing religious persecution, also brave enough cross ocean without really knowing expect side chance help coming time soon things went sideways. fueled identity rugged individualism government mistrust (back government persecuting). Combine vast geography, country stretches across continent, seacoast mountains vast plains grass, huge rivers lakes.

And there's also local culture, New England founded Puritans, work ethic important religious observance, eventually replaced mills factories fairly quickly country's life time became densely populated, people also moved west land opened Great Lakes region share many cultural ties Northeast. 

Contrast South remained largely rural Civil War, one's position society, politeness, chivalry religion important aspects there. Eventually became industrialized well happened end 19th century beginning 20th. cities approaching density North century.

And finally West, settlement along coast happened fairly early, far less populated area east Mississippi. Spanish missions Native settlements largely vast expanse open land settlements several days' ride apart across interior. discovery gold, literally drew thousands individuals went west seek fortune. also became area criminals seeking escape law Civil War went sparsely populated. Law order non-existent places, gun, robbed worse, wind dead. southern end desert northern end vast prairie nothing drought resistant prairie grass grew huge buffalo herds wandered about, one time called Great American Desert. really late 19th century linked rest country transcontinental railroad, even took 20th century vast wheat corn fields today existed public works allowed irrigation farmland.

So see really homogeneous group people heterogeneous one, even counting immigrants come since country founded. share commonalities also vast differences. people Northeast always seem rush eyes Southerner work ethic, conversely view taking long anything ideal politeness West mavericks willing blaze trail. Sure mixing urban areas share common rural areas vice versa largely region unto like separate country history people came shaping see today. get people agree anything barring outside threat like foreign adversary attack nearly impossible. undercurrent individualism mistrust government unites us ways, also causes fracturing seams. people view acceptable abomination must destroyed others.

It's never question money here, always question political something like contact tracing broad scale. may regional cooperation beyond gets hard get anything like done nationally. Alabama, threw 10,000+ doses. know people took kids get vaccinated months years ahead schedule school systems open requiring masks Delta prevalent.

 tests filtration leakage spreadsheet too. particle size something mad tiny like 0.064um last thing read corona many months ago corona small particles 0.4um. sure accurate corona particle thing though. 

So tests shows 99.7% filtration example, that‚Äôs particles magnitudes smaller corona allegedly, logically, much bigger particles corona filtered even greater percentage. simple math people... 90% less likely infected + 70% less likely transmit infected = total 97% less likely catch transmit virus unvaccinated person, 99.7% less chance catch transmit vaccinated person. That‚Äôs pretty fair logical plan imho. However worry would wouldn‚Äôt stop overall kind approach.

The title article anti vax fearmongering worst. Asymptomatic transmission incredibly difficult metric measure cant ascertain viral load spreads. Cdc done generalized studies allude idea fully vaccinated people still risk factor yes idea herd immunity impossible growing concern.

However high transmissibility delta expect slow much No, never said word ""faith"" sense blind. Experts require ""faith"" order findings believed, science, anyone verify someone else's information. know speed science works. false equivalence, yes, saying you, right now, participating bad faith. lying.

Nothing else matters point, fully open restrictions, cases still falling. even news anymore UK yet media outlets missing drama losing clicks.  get sick fake parent-watches-child-drink-alcohol reactions? think chance unvaccinated person getting infected delta right now? odds, asking unmasked unvaccinated, unmasked issue. skew poor, skew toward minorities. I'm pretty shocked American ""left"" consider racist, tbh. really medical ineligible, diagnosis doctor. Pretty straightforward. That's racist. actually, enough people pretend is.

""But UnVaxxed must keep masks stay distanced Vaxxed other."" ""This way veryone know UnVaxxed dangerous around""

Yeah. GREAT idea. /s inaccurate. numbers applied alpha variant Right assume Delta 2x-6x transmissible ancestral version. odds outdoor transmission vaccinated people considered low even multiplied number 6 still end small number. knowledgeable people tell worth worrying unless special high-risk environment (i.e. outdoor concert people closely packed shouting)

We know actual rate outdoor transmission is, best guess less 1/20th risk indoor transmission, though obviously huge number variables play. You‚Äôd amazed many healthy fully vaccinated people 30s Seattle area live absolutely terrified COVID.

It say, ""U.S. Healthcare system close exhausting resources."" Breaking indicates longer function, fact still functioning, can't handle number patients.

What's even worse article touch impact hospitals can't accept patients.

Patients need hospitalized can't admitted, **WILL DIE, some, most, ALL.** Every person needs hospital can't admitted **WILL DIE**.

That person can't admitted hospital go home family forced care them, watch die.  Since family trapped home sick person, almost impossible keep everyone house also getting sick.

Now everyone house sick, passing viral load back forth other, since hospitals accept patients patients die recover means explosion cases vast majority people need hospital hospital, means death rate Delta variant skyrocket.  end entire families dying.

Once hospitals hit capacity, death rate covid jump 10-20x. Well, 2-6 weeks, there‚Äôs protection first dose J&amp;J vaccine course.

They everything possible hospitals get ti point. 

Flat out.

The whole point NPI‚Äôs stop hospitals getting point. Living virus means balancing hospital capacity restriction.

Can‚Äôt ignore virus south wont do. Depends facility, require unit Bipaps.

Basically, trying short circuit brain questioning illogical beliefs without telling illogical being. hardest part conversation like allow become emotional. right, thank country fire put heads sand.  2 relevant recent studies, first one specifically reduced gray matter:
[Brain imaging COVID-19 UK Biobank deficits people recovered COVID-19: Well collecting semen dead unethical. However, brains could harvested sold sparingly used. ACA *does* restrictions employers do.

The ACA specifically permits employers higher tier (with limit) tobacco-related wellness program. It‚Äôs called ‚Äútobacco rating.‚Äù 

I haven‚Äôt studied closely, I‚Äôm seeing suggests employers use four factors‚Äîgeographic location, age, family size, tobacco use. Real estate Chicago even expensive cost living pretty average big city. Yep, off-the-wall friends, it‚Äôs story Texas. Something bill gates wanting depopulate. 

The reason accidental wandered conversation talking much power elite right now. talking bezos musk. Somehow bill gates still relevant conversation, guys building space programs. 

Anyways, counter argument arguing point. It‚Äôs stop conspiracy playing along game. bill gates created covid depopulate, would vaccine? that‚Äôs goal, overcrowded hospitals? Either way, aren‚Äôt playing plan ignoring it? Point is, life isn‚Äôt perfect, make decision. can‚Äôt keep cognitive dissonance up. That‚Äôs also bill gates would want. Can't great I'm taking attention away wife kids. worry though. last reply. sense big dick energy emanating last word every exchange have. yours. Stay healthy, cutie. I‚Äôll buy new liver dark web. Nobody wants stupid breed important remember vaccine efficacy rates infection two different things. rate infection population (vaccinated people) low enough called ""rare"", even efficacy group waning.

Regarding study, observed measured effectiveness numbers variable course study, particular, seen go back (Moderna June July), defying simple ‚Äúit‚Äôs getting worse‚Äù narrative. yet see explanation this, caused people question source variability whether confounding factor unaccounted study. related note, confidence intervals ~50% range numbers (Moderna June, Pfizer July) rather large (as much 12-85% cases).

I‚Äôm also perplexed study didn‚Äôt match age. would seem got shot earlier year likely older.

Personally, I‚Äôm inclined believe efficacy indeed waning, I‚Äôm yet onboard 50% number.  quite possible (source English idk) vaccinated people hospitalized otherwise compromised health wise. entirely shocking  fully vaccinated since end April. started feeling sick Friday got test safe. results came back positive Covid morning. first felt like head cold sinus infection. good news couple days feeling sick, woke morning feeling better. low energy dry cough. safe there! Literally none true, also ventilator always ICU. would treatment already infected notice sick enough need it. need people take vaccines need treatments like this. both, right? Oh boy. pains even read. Little kids oxygen supply. /r/nottheonion sure kind floor is, contracts called 6 pts MAX med-surg unit...admins always try push 7 8, THIRTY? cant right Making online verification system wouldn‚Äôt impossible task. would easier shutting everything trying organize things like expanded unemployment stimulus packages.

Some states already working it, place already mandated vaccines entry. 

Besides, we‚Äôll eventually need anyways. I‚Äôm sure things like international travel start head way.

I think Delta changing minds people mindset though. pays keep extra nurses doctors standby time?

It‚Äôs beds. It‚Äôs people run them. 

Where come from?

My wife outpatient internist. almost got called inpatient work early one surges. also means one fewer doctor managing outpatient care, too. Sam Elliot. Imagine mustache voice. ‚ÄúCowboy up. Get vaccine.‚Äù Maybe kind depends bad things hospitals. Also there's talk insurance may stop covering treatment unvaccinated patients. Best luck trying use updated yet fake card stock vaccination status insurance lawyers. White Republicans, mostly. minority communities way under-vaccinated isn‚Äôt getting hate big problem. sympathize history ignored best experimented upon worst healthcare system time isn‚Äôt Tuskegee 2.0, evidence everyone see. outside crazy events like don‚Äôt want hundreds surplus beds sitting there, fallow. 

It‚Äôs no-win: keep thousands beds standby probably never need decades. Don‚Äôt strapped actually need lifetime. 

Supply chains extraordinarily hard get right even non-pandemic times. Come on. article doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúit‚Äôs unrelated‚Äù. health officials said early determine whether Obama‚Äôs guests staff parties without mask mandates contributed spike Covid-19 cases. 

They haven‚Äôt drawn definite connection, haven‚Äôt ruled either. Even it‚Äôs making vaccinated people deathly ill, shown vaccinated people spread Delta variety. can‚Äôt say sure didn‚Äôt happen case. hard read


visceral. 

this details mom painting room etc.

I'd guess practicality nothing it. Weed legal everywhere. It‚Äôs easier ya drinking. never ethical ""let rip"" point overwhelming large portion hospitals. also think past time vaccinate younger vulnerable children.

The people vaccinated, fewer restrictions needed avoid carnage. fuck lambda variant  I‚Äôm Cincinnati areas seem picking I‚Äôm north city seeing lot anything yet  Unless GOP controls Senate(or whatever branch needed) filabust kill budget decision hold accountable. Either way, state public funds went somewhere already, like thier friend's business. 

Now feds demand recompense next state budget, money come somewhere, coming elected official's pocket coming friend's business, money went. comes education budget, reducing education, another social program, GOP likes. Defunding things. repayment done tax money available, get decide goes something thier friends like helping others, themselves.

It's possibly huge win GOP make feds pay. Dem administration bleeds funding dem agenda items better spent; state funds end someone's pocket helps state leader's personal relationships; next budget allow cut program like, thier base vote dem regardless. fed GOP may able block move accountability right place, don't, forcing repayment spun Dem administration attacking hard earned Florida tax dollars, meant Floridians, like they're stealing Florida! injecting cure COVID still fine right? Whites? never stopped? did. Universal doesn‚Äôt require masks indoors would say still pretty solid seeing. went weekend school started I‚Äôd say pretty busy especially fireworks fact busy 2019 lol. 

I say Disney doesn‚Äôt fast passes going lines long keep moving well. universal wasn‚Äôt quite busy pay skip nice purchase lost damn mind lady, never said afraid vaccines masks, I've played reindeer games already, I'm sick it. covid already, what's point mask vaccine dance anymore? Covid shut world, fear mongering bureaucrats did. People went "" health care RIGHT EVERYONE"" ""deny healthcare everyone think right!"" Real fast. Safety trials(Phase 1) done. It‚Äôs phase 2/3 efficacy. Great point ‚Äî agree you. Thanks!  vaccine alone enough keep spread delta contained. 

Totally agreed. think there‚Äôs important correlation: states high vaccination likely impose mask mandates make sense.   said ton nurses retired became travel nurses pay better.  think there's something said case counting sequencing experiences vaccines performing variants. want rush back ""what can't see can't hurt you"" mentality get world population vaccinated data experience. problem seeing numbers, that's journalism problem data collection problem. kneecap science policy high numbers scary. whole sub wants COVID end world. *anthony_adams_rubbing_hands.jpg* Save young. cdc link interesting, thanks sharing. definitely think figure makes sense considering level vaccinations 65s now. Younger people (as 40) ones least amount immunity. you‚Äôve got thinking!!  FDA blood hands drag feet Oct. render decision make right now.  Yes. Extremely high. honored stat like even true survived icu admission you‚Äôre still Essentially tortured ripped from
Your life months time take years ever recover. Luckily date time told this. related pay

Lets real here, pay definitely part it. burnout real problem, feeling massively unappreciated system dealing absurd amount shit helping. It'll speed burnout. Keep doubling ignorant comments. 

Blocking now. know time. speaking generally would reduce anxiety vaccinated  eases rollout supply chains ensures vulnerable get shots first (elderly, certain workers, etc).

I agree time tables much faster (not 4 month lead like last time). dispute opinion worst 2nd worst President's time were. However, goes show much worse. point really though, cause us turn one another time, people different us. Oh wow fundi stuff 

I‚Äôm gay bay mentality foreign Taliban ""Half crew reject fixing holes, claiming disbelief existence water plugging holes prevent breathing."" hell think running muscles? kind whacko stuff reading? specifically put large muscle disperse blood quickly, still going blood regardless. Damn, Texas must really bad living within 50 miles Detroit upgrade. I‚Äôd like throw white people mix too

Do chop first straight blender?  12 trial data first manufacturer (Pfizer) isn‚Äôt due another month. approved FDA (or equivalent countries) probably October.

Of course kids allowed vaccinated vaccine available. Starting risk groups.

The question young go vaccinating healthy children. depends three things: a) trials show b) risks schools show fall c) whether available doses better used adults elsewhere planet. 

That last point isn‚Äôt merely ethical one (ie use dose protect someone 10% risk dying another country use prevent 0.01% risk dying child?), it‚Äôs also likely way avoid new variants emerging.  include instant nurses infrastructure? that's needed. 

Oh, also people freaking getting vaccines. idea Ontario refused this. make sense all... small vocal. Yesterday watched gathering trying speak Rally Afghanistan poor taste put lightly. Afghan rally 9-10x numbers easily.

Vaccination rates pretty high. numbers hand, something shy 82%. (Though much higher around Vancouver, much lower inland)

Edit: Stopped lazy. 73.58% *total* population (Not eligible) least one shot. reference, Ontario 71.63% Quebec 73.30% Jesus Christ. Prioritize people need help fuck.  gets pay teachers state budget prob hammered lack tourist money shutdown? think would ok that.  Yeah read about, protesting mask mandates cancer center. basically always mask mandate always mask mandate. 

It‚Äôs like protesting sky blue. guess J&amp;J recipients end getting mRNA booster. Glad read comment. I‚Äôm also still high school (senior) I‚Äôm glad hear kids care pandemic too. live conservative area vast majority don‚Äôt want wear mask idea many vaccinated. thing is, county whole liberal, maybe decent chunk school vaccinated. don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm vaccinated wearing mask school. 
The one thing I‚Äôm concerned potential comments harassment may receive. I‚Äôll keeping low profile year. Good luck though!  Napkin math? Hard pass Yeah people live paycheck paycheck. That's true. People WWII generation knew scourge smallpox polio witnessed eyes great benefit vaccination was.

Alas, also partisan broadcast &amp; social media devoted misinforming, vilifying expertise, stoking anger benefit financial elites. 

The way pandemic silver lining causes many question consumption partisan misinformation, respect scientists medical experts. handful deathbed ""come Jesus"" moments aside, see trends direction. Partisan media [sowed hatred decades, take least long social problem solved, mostly one funeral time. Yeah, I've told healthcare providers wear N95 equivalent masks. offer better protection high risk people, wherever might buy sources supply chains get theirs, I'm taking anything away them.

What mean enacted mask mandate? see anywhere. difference old religions, even though they‚Äôre similar. I‚Äôm ex-JW don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs like all, even encouraged everyone get vaccinated. Here's problem thesis, probably see covid patients unvaccinated breakthrough cases using logic firmly put ""get vaccinated"" camp. more, breakthrough cases they've seen likely mild cases, whereas unvaccinated cases much severe. suggesting mere speculation align data vaccines breakthrough cases. I‚Äôm stories happened free agency

Anyone saying understand free agency means.

Edit: anyone happens read - perspective church means ""you choose anything want, cannot choose consequences"".  Good thing getting third booster shot. poor man's version free speech.

Apparently 100ks central South Americans come Florida ‚Äújab‚Äù two. vaccines aren‚Äôt great job stopping transmission.

In places genuinely high vaccination rates (65%+), yes, are. Next nowhere US kinds vaccination rates, especially anywhere South. Reddit.. best place get attacked rabid idiots! Block move on, lol... 

I pretty sure majority us Pfizer going ""mild"" breakthrough Delta cases. I've advising high risk people _very_ careful better understood dealt with. breakthrough cases usually mild scale COVID, folks complex health situations put risk still risk, vaccinated not.

I thankful professional PPE readily available again. least risk good, easily available options protect themselves. think reason many Mormons identify republicans like many people U.S., see morality, Republican Politics, religion inextricably tied together. things seen Fox/OAN/News Max/Facebook say masks evil vaccines dangerous--then like republican base--they're same. religious tenet, culture.

Now, many Mormons see things way all--but large minority rather majority. many liberal Mormons see liberal politics much inline core value loving neighbor. folks tend try keep politics religion generally pro separation church state. 

Like group, everyone place--but majority--I'd chalk media diet many bleeds perceptions faith.

It rare find anyone agrees 100% religion large ideological group associate with. People may claim do, actions say otherwise.

There many recent official statements followed exactness downplayed members depending political leaning was.

For example: Conservative members official statement prop 8 California often pushed people take anti gay marriage stance. people quiet lot buts excepts later official statement supporting equal LGBTQ+ rights housing, employment, social services, etc.

When Trump running, statements actions sometimes followed official statements. never mentioned name, timing highly unusual. 2015 Trump Cruz called policing Muslim neighborhoods restricting immigration based religion immediately afterward [out comes official statement warning erosion liberty supporting freedom Trump begins touting separation children parents border official [statements condemning practice calling path citizenship came well **plenty** clearly support positions align easily conservatism.

Catholics same. Support pope--but American Conferences Bishops ignored request consider denying communion pro choice politicians.

People people.

So, local ward (congregation) leadership dealing letter Covid? They're waiting clarification making changes (going back masks social distancing) meetings.... ??

TLDR: culture religious tenet. Endemic means virus always present community. I‚Äôm sure word endemic used lately describe situation longer huge surges things control. Endemic necessarily want, we‚Äôd much rather reduce community spread extremely low levels like Measles, Polio, others.

Endemic COVID-19 would probably mean seasonal mask wearing going forward.  Yea I‚Äôm done I‚Äôm

Abdominal fat 2 things covid: displaces lungs making difficult breathe, known active endocrine system, worsening ""cytokine storm"" happens COVID-19.

It‚Äôs really excuse parties refuse vaccines.   First result googled. isn‚Äôt rocket science. It‚Äôs well known political leanings major reason COVID vaccine hesitancy. braindead idiots every state. Fortunately live part state much higher vaccination rates higher percentages educated/not brain dead people. mean, CA barely 51% vaccinated, red Arizona I‚Äôm happy least 46% moment. I‚Äôm glad AZ slowly flipping blue. also tied genetics bad luck, unfortunately. several friends severe liver diseases developed children required transplants; definitely knocking back whiskey elementary school. vaccine malicious stupidity, guess would steadfastly refuse take it. True, first asshole say something fear driven response socially responsible. one went inside use bathroom? Joe Rogan talks nearly every podcast, post Covid. Dude convinced vitamins taking care answer young, probably need vaccine. Same. live Bay Area, even gym (which personally find uncomfortable place wear one), never less 50% people wearing them. people around never stopped wearing them. mandates again, easy transition. save it, fairly recent tho. try googling it. hate getting replies like break posts multiple points respond to, end taking things context, precisely did. reread original post, things arguing things even saying. pretty clearly said pro vaccine mandate healthcare workers. brought knowledge base say ones making medical decisions. 

As pandering comment, I've repeated several times point think divisive language making antivax movement stronger. comment goal trying increase vaccinations, actually probably reduce them. pandering polarized redditors fake internet points. main thing I‚Äôve noticed suddenly everyone scientist politician different way pandemic. It‚Äôs normal differences different opinions pandemic really showcased would taken government longer come system vaccine distributors could use took make vaccine. Non American here, see lot Texas Mississippi, things going states high vax rates? meant states pockets relatively high vaccination. places worst right average far average vaccination.

Nobody charge response ever deal rolling pandemic lasting 18 months, incomplete response vaccines. It‚Äôs going take public health measures better vaccine. It‚Äôs going need help psychologists, marketing/messaging experts, politicians navigate way this.

Meh, nothing new. We've food decades. throw tons food day, meanwhile people places literally starving death. vaccines - we're throwing away. main problem downplaying that.

Wait, isn‚Äôt stupidity pre-existing condition? live right Mormon church anti-mask city parking lot empty Sundays people started getting vaccinated. seemed take seriously.  think so. not. One exit classrooms. Bruh, isn‚Äôt slap fight twitter good bad fictional female character designed. literally difference taking precautions safety &amp; others vs. fucking anything &amp; dumbass. 


You know? I‚Äôm Louisiana, I‚Äôm familiar trust experts comes safety. Like take hurricane Katrina: literally cannot imagine world people would legit argue hurricane wasn‚Äôt real &amp; media pockets big gov take rights away something. Like fucking ridiculous train thought is. Except today's climate teachers would probably get death threats probably get harmed striking especially covid related reasons Florida. Mormons voice reason now?

I'm glad they're telling flock wear masks get vaccinated, let's get carried away... know they'll chanting 'Make Afghanistan Great Again' figure people actually enjoyed isolation similar situations, home life hellish thanks COVID can't escape it.  They'll quickly vaccinate see much cost remain unvaccinated.  protests? need join insurances already charge smoking. magic temporary contagious virus would allowed thrive masks obsolete Although glad finally going get vaccinated, reason dealing Delta people refused vaccine initially, virus chance mutate. yes.   Right, say ‚Äúthis problem exists XYZ‚Äù actually goes well beyond that, needs corrected. doesn‚Äôt help us myopic view issue perpetuating. People able infected RSV once, understand. entire family got January 2019 never horrendously sick life, next Hep actually close dying. wouldn‚Äôt wish RSV anyone certainly risking getting again! I'll wait peer review Nope, income. mean, feel like could enforce missionaries, right? already many restrictions missionaries (significantly regular members), this?

To fair, controversial thing (stupidly is), enforcing easy things members often raised whole lives.

I never served mission. brothers in-laws I've learned sounds like various mission districts differ (and perhaps most) would expect, dependent largely current mission president district. suppose mask-wearing could vary district district reason alone.

That's one thought anyway. Mormon missions, culture around them, even effects missionaries afterwards (not always good, mind you) really intriguing find really interesting topic. still cracks people act like FDA able give full approval yet means anything typical red tape. FDA emergency use approval. FDA put name saying think vaccine much safer getting covid willing sign emergency use authorization something almost never happens. isnt havent reviewed data yet, isnt saw reason concern, actually opposite saying ""Based seen, use shit, hurry! Run! Go!! figure formalities later get people ASAP!!"" scare everyone getting anything. turning TBM vs QBM ha, St. Lucie County seems insane Lol hospitalized diseases preventable That's Jehovah's witnesses Mormons Thank you! stop testing RSV. less cases. üôÑ children distracted sitting home stuff there. Havent looked average cost data. would shocked 15k. Remdesivir treatment alone 10k. Got source? Mildly curious now.    ""Capitalism keep killing workers economy improves."" Wtf even trying claim that? tax evasion. political influence. sexual assault. too. would probably leave house like month. There's nothing that's better could experience home.  I'm Inland Empire district began August 2nd. kiddos staff wearing masks I'm hoping keep serious outbreaks happening. We'll wait see though.  St.Louis live summer, putting scrubber like devices every single room schools air isnt stagnant. promotes air circulation without opening windows.

It really help open windows humidity St Louis averages 70% daily. heat gets us humidity cut knife sometimes. I'll say this, (canadian) government totally screwed terms stocking PPE protecting long term care homes. mean, really really really screwed thousands people died need die. 

That said, maybe that's going nuts vaccine hoarding. [We've got 20M currently stored] we're buying 40M moderna, 70% nation already two shots. 

So drowning vaccines soon, even if/after give people boosters.  probably can't anything right perspective. ""Donating money victims natural disasters? Probably PR stunt"" That's true largely covered 2nd paragraph. pisses end know spent year half staying homes much possible wearing masks everytime go anywhere, double masking even vaccinated, got first dose 3rd day eligible. still catch get slowly suffocate home someone tried hard could catch gets medical care. sit right me.  

If unable vaccinated kids get school, I'm required law send them, unmasked indoors eat lunch. There's treatment either, used staff fed up. little, late. done year change ago. great they're now, sure, know plenty members point made mind, said back then. anyone else find funny zoom woman right looks like coughing lol  least Saints team south won‚Äôt contribute much. City requirement proof vaccine negative covid test attend anything indoors  can't even imagine. analogy beyond dumb rock! think actual consequence. Here's think: base wants something, GOPers promised that, base votes them, something actually bad, GOPers blame Democrats. That's always working well GOPers autopilot. blew deficit national debt, blamed Democrats. tanked economy, blamed Democrats. difference ""something"" shrinking base. would make difference though. GOPers banking deaths local economy tanking enough sway voters highly possible they're right.   whole antivaxxers white Evangelicals way overblown

the data shows typical antivax either black Hispanic soon there's news, will! actually 50% fully vaccinated, ~60% received one dose. sites report numbers (including [this necessarily. remember lot, mechanically apply according rules memorized.

One thing lacking vaccination rate comments etc vaccination rate per age group. thought Sweden would worse Florida due lower full vaccination rate looked actual age groups Sweden vs Florida stark differences.

In Sweden 60 older 90% least one dose, 86% 2 doses. 50-59 86% 77%. Much higher Floridas rates. Swedens vaccination way behind many EU countries. Denmark like 10%-points ahead.

The Florida age group rates good. Yes news station Alabama reference Eastern Shore Mobile area.

Tell whole story allowed anymore? I'm Ontario people 70%-80% vaccinated, daily data suggest vaccines 95% effective preventing hospitalizations. (86.5% efficacy cases, 99% effective ICU) real issue here, hospitals literally already 2x capacity. ICU patients need 1:1 nursing care, especially sickly covid patients, 2:1.

Vaccinated unvaccinated (who need get vaccinated) also need break numbers like ‚Äú75% fully vaxxed‚Äù better understand true lay land.

Where live keep hearing similar total average stats - it‚Äôs 90+, 80+, 70+ 65+ like 88-96%

Do suggestive work around? Increased training pay? Perhaps bringing experienced retired nurses specifically handle (or most) hands training? 

Just trying come solution bring attention obvious crisis making - lack available medical care.  Yes, should. blood clot risk issue take mRNA vaccine. Plus, much protects catching COVID.

These valid reasons point. take word it. Speak doctor go concerns specific health risks. almost guarantee vaccine best course action.

Probably not. good physical shape eating well, getting good sleep taking care overall clear ways make sure immune system strong capable fighting virus though
. make immune anything many cases improve outcomes. read statistic 78% icu admissions Texas covid obese people. Alberta, 80% icu admissions 2 comorbities.

In 
view, rise Delta variant changes risk-benefit analysis authorizing vaccines children. FDA strongly consider authorizing vaccines children ages 5-11 years based

This need double conversion persuasion here.  Put potato chips, expect cover costs associated medical care issues arising obesity. That's also opinion American Academy Pediatrics. consider data sufficient 5-11 year olds want FDA expedite approval. But, again, don‚Äôt want people covid untreated. infect even people would treated. personally think vaccine mandated, don‚Äôt agree unvaccinated covid go untreated. That‚Äôs true recipe disaster. I'm waiting foxtrot uniform charlie kilo variant come point are. area might be, US, consider urban areas largely POC poverty, number drastically changes. Didn‚Äôt used say something like covid problem winter it‚Äôs normally cold flu season?

Oh god must feel good though throw face like that. Two words.

Lock. Down. Please ruin call dog using context.  50% fired yet?  OK, much room ICU have? According site, 409 licensed beds entire hospital. entire hospital ICU, many covid cases think we‚Äôre talking about? That's fair point. hope FDA approval given many get vaccinated (although already hear many screaming soon). protect still refuse, we're saying sacrifice ones done right thing. unvaccinated populations rate serious symptoms 20 percent. Yeah, way responsibly mandate vaccinated people allowed bars stadiums etc awhile they‚Äôll get frustrated enough get Nope, anti-vaxxers did. Hope aren‚Äôt one said impoverished loonies minor group. replying to. disagree resources factor; disagree ""loonies"" minor group. untreated LIKELY pass virus kids. you‚Äôre worried kids, advocating treating unvaccinated covid. punishment behavior impacts everyone.

No, not. Punishment behaviour would applied everyone displaying behaviour equally, e.g. blanket fine anyone vaccinated. millions people lucky enough catch mild case? People need hospitalisation COVID already suffering mistake; want punish risky behaviour they're ones want single out.  pathetic AZ probably superior, apart risk 1 6million dieing vaccine free income nothing it. separate car accident 10% chance getting Covid isn‚Äôt acceptable. injury may kill me, getting Covid might. cited article, not.  use antibiotics vaccines. Antibiotics work virus. Look, don‚Äôt know from, I‚Äôm guess it‚Äôs coastal metro/suburb. literally lived rural area within last year. Think people around time, would acceptable open vaccinated? (I‚Äôm assuming said back city home would literally social network anymore)

It‚Äôs exact opposite rural Texas. want fit here, either get shot don‚Äôt tell anybody don‚Äôt get one. It‚Äôs odd self-reinforcing culture based largely political belief. Exactly point. increased risk, pay insurance, shouldn‚Äôt made entirely pay medical expenses/ allowed use insurance.   that‚Äôs true, what‚Äôs solution? get vaccines people want limited access? There's recent [pre-print found effectiveness transmission 71% among household contacts. telling come without statistical information tell us agree/disagree facts actually happening ground. thousands people ventilators Florida overwhelming majority unvaccinated. 

Period.  think looking already don‚Äôt liver transplants alcoholics, FYI. makes feel better day event last Saturday fully masked people heavily vaxxed group got neg covid test back morning. I'm high risk feel confident fully vaxxed plus mask protected speaks volumes CDC isn‚Äôt tracking them, even though used to.

There [an article AstraZeneca lead scientist says reporting severe cases. pretty sketchy considering know variants might develop much information early possible better next years. Yeah point army deployed fired live ammunition crowd anti-vax rally dared pop up, I'd oppose ""this could set precedent later get used actually decent people,"" level. also dosent apply homes either. people masking homes unless active covid. BS.  I‚Äôve wondering things would trend way, intersection refusal science, lack universal health care covid.

What goes around, comes around. sneaks behind bite.  Doubtful. ACA limits insurances use deny (or charge higher rates for) coverage, don‚Äôt think FDA approved vaccines list. probably (with medically-based exceptions only). We‚Äôd need Congress amend law allow it, isn‚Äôt going happen right now. data Israel, UK, they‚Äôd found earlier vaxxed transmit wouldn‚Äôt ended mask mandate needed curb surge.

Oh, knew data far told vaxxed transition maskless. watching Isreali news forum, cases knew among vaccinated. everyone else scicence already aware dropped pfizer effectness 88 64 34%..and dropping. Fauci tone people need stop silly, subjects mocked, take mask already, like WTF, even 1 5 chance catching covid statistically stupid-mode take mask.  diabetics? others, like smokers? Insurance companies love this. sad part is, don‚Äôt even realize it.  what? offered nothing concrete, would quibble call 'minor' loonies 'most'?

Punishing people vaccine affect mostly poor people, largely people color. Maybe hospital allowed 10% Covid capacity? Excluding hospital acquired covid. turn away covid patients and/or triage like vaccinated vs unvaccinated. don‚Äôt blame you. what‚Äôs best health mental health. Interestingly enough moved oklahoma austin 90s time, entirely correct. 90s turning point Austin, expensivish back then, expensive oklahoma far, person clearly idea they're talking far prices areas. They're correct people moving Oklahoma cheaper, cheap cheap. places mentioned already expensive, mostly housing crunch historically low wage issue literally everywhere. Oklahoma houses 90k 5 years ago easily go 500k now. Ant-vaxxers wrong idiots, US denies free medical care everyone, already. way get ‚Äúfree‚Äù medical care get medicaid medicare, pay insurance companies wayyyyyy much money (and isn‚Äôt free). 

There practical way this, can‚Äôt deny care everyone made bad decision - going deny care motorcyclist without helmet? motorcyclist general? Plus, sick people don‚Äôt get care proposal going walk around infect others. don‚Äôt want that. ethical argument modest proposal. forget defund schools double hurricane shelters Everyone already pay, silly post    risk going far off-topic, end game knows anti-mask orders get knocked courts. Next year elections, argument 'he fought like hell protect y'all's freedoms, court system prevented it.' Similar arguments made areas like immigration.

Our administration Texas unbelievably predictable. considerable anti-vax/anti-mask population Texas pandered political gains. certainly minority... vote religiously. sad :(. Back use able visit baby room. chemtrails real there‚Äôs need vaccines :) hey 4 year old. got link masks like? Hopefully USA this.

Look, either get vaccine help don‚Äôt make go longer. 

There people can‚Äôt legitimately get it, rest intellectually lazy people thinking smarter Facui watching YouTube. texas right there!


....oh wait.  Friend, seems data used video Alpha variant, according poster below. think get meaningful data, want looking Delta, would mean typically relying data July forward year.

Here's Mayo Clinic study mentioned month, think might find useful able comment vaccine efficacy two strains: data video presents incorrect, think moving forward we'll start see reduced efficacy Delta, strain dominant now. personally found information helpful update risk calculus. Agreed! proposal - load crop duster planes Moderna fly rural areas aerosolize living shit air. comment non-sequitur.  definitely married-with-children, non-party type vaccinated people getting sick Florida Texas. depends conduct yourself, associate with, defensive are, etc. different circumstances behaviors, leads us higher risk profiles. None means statistics average risk wrong. 100% yes. Fucking yes! bills people they‚Äôve displaced- fucking stupid. Get vaccinated fucks!   Yup.

Even massive economic boost hosting ton US military.

But demand troops deploy yet due inaction inability people right thing?

No sir.

No troops dispatched mask mandate possibly even shuttering bars tamp spread. tactic manipulate new cycle, forming image strong man. image end goal reelection, even presidential dreams. Death citizens, economic drag, long term social impact, costs he's willing pay, betting narrative trumps outcome. I'm already deep student debt getting BA trying get fully certified school teacher. unfortunately never able go back school anything due even though I'd love to. News came Chile, monitored further, paints different picture. wonder what's going here. 49.3% AstraZeneca   
28.8% Sinovac  
17.9% Pfizer    
4.1% Janssen designates new names, they've updated every week two since they've started.

CDC like month late tagging Delta variant concern although huge India UK, yet huge here. also kept Epsilon (the one California) variant concern much longer obviously relevant states even though get far globally.

It's always interesting seeing systems work like that. True can't jack...but pretty please approach work obviously case. Strange thing concerned Microsoft Considering kids can‚Äôt get vaccine yet, lot people. Hope feel better soon it‚Äôs mild simptoms. Take Tylenol relax keep eye breathing. Anxiety worst moment, never Covid anxiety driven simptoms back May last year didn‚Äôt start feeling better got tested u try get tested. you‚Äôre talking Baptist South, currently 24 covid patients 0 ICU beds available according [New York you‚Äôre talking different ‚Äúlargest hospital‚Äù Montgomery, apologize. Yes, ok. get soon though fully vaccinated. study done Oxford said could wait 45 weeks doses would still effective. shouldn‚Äôt wait long though currently PARTIALLY effective, needs fully effective needs go get second dose. side effects bad. helps fight covid, make immune it.  One things like other: examples listed directly affect individual making decisions. Covid contagious hell catching directly impact even kill someone else, including healthcare provider. 

That's line me. don‚Äôt know place US requires appointments now. everything looks fine! Treating unvaccinated going reduce spread much. already spent days, weeks, passing virus others they're taking hospital resources could go towards saving others. choice unvaccinated adult refused vaccination vaccinated adult car accident, latter given priority service. mean...yeah, kind of, especially since addiction widely recognized disease. 

A lot adult smokers started kids sometimes lack good decision making strategies, alcoholism seems run families, either addictive tendencies familial/cultural attitudes towards alcohol. 

My point is/was insurance companies (or whatever organization charge overseeing healthcare) would take kind moral hair splitting license start denying coverage kinds preventable diseases. 

If got skin cancer, would want coverage denied use sunscreen kid (or prove used sunscreen adult) lived higher elevations closer equator? 

A whole lot diseases traced back poor life choices, insurance generally treat/pay those. 

Please misunderstand defending antivaxxers antimaskers. 

They infuriating actively harming country, think denying medical care (because refusing pay generally works thing, since shit ton poor people delay utilize health care system due fear massive bills) best stategy combat pandemic. won‚Äôt listen their:

What makes anyone think approach work all? think situation what's happening community. surge RSV mask mandates allowed bomb waiting go 20 numbers rise added 65 schools list covid infections. academy pediatrics supporting shot 5-12 far trials look good think risk/reward clear. Chronic illness concerns generation, death bad outcome covid someone sufferers chronic illness would wish kiddo anyone else's, potential ravage entire generation terrifies many reasons. Let‚Äôs add obese people list pay more.  want, everyone healthcare. that‚Äôs is. 

No, I‚Äôm upset time, people vote keep things way are, people say ‚Äúwhy pay you, never get sick‚Äù, ones would suffer punitive system keep place. 

So yes, jack premiums want stay unvaccinated. situation reversed, think would hesitate ? 

I also don‚Äôt care get downvoted. It‚Äôs high time people punished choosing. Monetarily, designed, would absolute bare minimum recourse. killing themselves, killing everything could safe, killing economy. drunk drivers running people ‚Äúhave right drink want!‚Äù would guilding ‚Äúslippery slope‚Äù comments? people reject, there's probably also lot people who'd want get know how. think parents concerned covid deaths per se, long-term covid symptoms, specifically neurological damage like ""brain fog"". kind memory impairment decrease ability concentrate would devastating school-age kids. would literally alter life trajectory terms college opportunities career &amp; future income prospects.  mean paper already pay universal costs. Plus every country better healthcare results us Netherlands got 'prikbussen', busses fully equipped vaccinate, drive low vaccination area's offer walk-in-vaccinations, without need make appointment. Particularly helpful illiterate people, others difficulty understanding forms filled out.

In DC call, people come bring vaccination house, could good well. need really stop thinking perspective only. us easy, go online, read rules, make appointment, go, done. lot people actually fairly difficult. US states 85% literacy rate. I'm sure capable coming logical conclusions? Short someone telling explicitly leads B is. would assume that. vaccine protects best getting I'll need go hospital worse. hard tell single case basis, chances vaccine protected worse off. man named Hannah Arendt

I double-take.

anyway, thanks idea Exactly. really believe vaccination status taken consideration triage. busy pushing goal posts can't undestand effectiveness tranmission 71% vaccinated contacts. 
By mean: people sharing house ""sick"", vaccinated? can't follow basic mask wearing protocols anti-basic hygiene

That's pretty poor assumption. us vaccinated required wear masks. Makes sense. Add vaccine still effective preventing serious re-infection natural immunity. Also less 2% fully vaccinated today vertigo. covid. pretty much check box every symptom. variant going around would test negative? Probably stupid question symptoms. start getting it. privileged, first world mentality reject vaccine post locked due off-topic discussion per Rule 8 r/Coronavirus. Please remember keep discussion focused COVID-19 - off-topic political discussions better suited subs. Thank understanding. COVID endemic pandemic, that‚Äôs adopt mentality. It‚Äôs spreading like wildfire right now, need mitigate tools available. won‚Äôt forever.  Ah admit least equal danger covid, yet presumably absurd overreaction? you? one it?  bad idea jobs WFH can't imagine enough base left gain re-election anyways. 

Imagine world politicians care people dying percentage points polls. know, realistic flying unicorns. don‚Äôt necessarily feel bad disseminators misinformation get sick agree point. 

* drunks develop pancreatitis liver failure?

This rush punitive measures frustration fear nothing effective healthcare policy. It‚Äôs hot AF lol Yea another reply cleared too. correct. Overall US much higher population, states much closer population vaccine coverage probably better comparisons. Still, Iceland done great job diminishing that. seems like still threshold needs met slow spread. Currently attackers‚Äô side seems focused destroying *themselves*, give bit hope outcome one last one. right 92.9% 16 older received least one shot 86.3% fully vaccinated. means 71.5% total population fully vaccinated 77.1% partially vaccinated. Iceland also vaccinated children older 12 underlying conditions going vaccinate rest starting week. received J&amp;J also going receive booster shot week either Pfizer Moderna. 
 
In current wave around 2630 gotten infected. 66.77% fully vaccinated, 2.24% partially vaccinated 30.99% unvaccinated. course keep mind due many people vaccinated unusual majority infected. 
 
In total 76 people hospitalized currently 31 hospitalized. total ICU currently 6. hospitalized 71% vaccinated 29% unvaccinated. 67% currently ICU vaccinated 33% unvaccinated. 
 
There detail find here, official governmental website:  
 
See also information hospitalized since September 23rd. (although english):  S√£o Paulo state Brazil 44 million people. Florida 21 million people.     
S√£o Paulo 8.785 hospitalized Florida 15.540. 

90% adults S√£o Paulo got first dose, 36% adults got second dose (because 3 months interval) Cool speculation, bro, data whatsoever back frankly alarmist supposition. 

And need define ‚Äútruly lot.‚Äù Supposing current mRNA vaccines 99% effective serious illness (somewhat less efficacious infection kind), 1% 170 million people still high number people, statistically small number. Make sense? Sucks you‚Äôre 1%, 1% tiny minority. 

Additionally, need pay attention doctors nurses observing 96%(ish) hospitalized COVID patients unvaxed, vaxed tend older (70+ average) milder cases. 

In words, listen data calm down. See, rather financially punish vaccinated, think moved back line comes time get healthcare. I'm fucking sick death unvaccinated twats taking valuable medical resources people. matter sick get, need stay fuck home.

ETA: Except kids. fault all. Adults know better.  Look want advocate model understand, recognize would make healthcare even unaffordable even people already US. dispute claims, lets see something. open mind. trying muddy water, f off.  Lol acting like play team something. wanted people fault charged crazy rates insurance.

The solution charge people more, de-profitize healthcare industry. United States highest per capita healthcare costs worst health outcomes entire developed world, even adjusting lifestyle differences. American healthcare industry's primary function wealth extraction rather patient care. people making poor choices vaccination. life friend pay health insurance premiums, pay nearly 200% excise tax, America, State received millions (maybe billions) settlement money. 

If smoker needs treated, already paid.

A couple years ago, former Washington State Governor Christine Gregoire made case raising excise tax tobacco products reduce consumption, also reduces State revenues. So, 8 million people State Washington, 12% smoke, let's say half pack day excise tax $5/pack, 875 million per year. numbers may little off. highly unlikely monies used treatment, were, they've already paid, some.

It's specious argument.

Now, choosing get vaccine could drastically reduce need hospitalization also personal choice people responsible for.

To clear, advocating defending use tobacco products. compare last week‚Äôs vaccine numbers? absolutely set sub data set includes persons. sad unavoidable. LOL seriously. fuck get from?  pretty fucking stupid believe democrats want communism believe covid fake so... Leave Republicans claim party fiscal responsibility use trillions dollars health care services want vaccinated wear mask. Thats mandatory anyways live (Ontario, Canada). keep forgetting lot places still offer online learning mandatory masks school. Sadly happening lots local state subreddits. ""US"" healthcare system healthcare system ""some states""? I'm seeing hospitals NE collapsing. endorsement system, lets put woodies back pants. point regional obvious reasons. Also looks like waited vast majority people vaccinated loosen restrictions: [""Iceland lifted domestic COVID-19 restrictions June 26, 2021 majority population Lol whole thread political post honey. ""The overall vaccine effectiveness transmission 88.5%."" /r/COVID19/comments/oma9yf/vaccination_with_bnt162b2_reduces_transmission_of/ Acronyms vary hospital hospital. worked 4 different hospitals; one hospital CCU critical care cardiac patients another term used step-down unit (between ICU regular acuity beds). particular case CCU take ventilated patients (some step-downs not), could patients requiring titration vasoactive drips nurse patient ratio 1:3. 

It‚Äôs confusing, know. facility telling unit higher level care (yet beds available), would wager CCU similar step-down unit. Hope helps. There‚Äôs recent news story mother encouraging daughter violate dress code school masks aren‚Äôt enforced, school presume declare dress code? unemployed neighbor Facebook calling garbage, plot control everyone.

However, open idea guaranteed income supplement. Yeah, bit frustrating reading here. Also people panic vaccine get Moderna/Pfizer suddenly skewed different month preliminary/rought data. numbers varied next month again. It‚Äôs problem, it‚Äôs really fixable one. There‚Äôs pandemic raging around us lasting seemingly forever selfish assholes. Masks crucial. Keeping young babies public spaces people refuse wear masks crucial. seems pretty obvious they‚Äôll develop differently, alternative risking health safety. lack leadership Texas amazing. guess Gov happy lights still unlike 6 mos ago. EXCEPT turns people llamas(just kidding). almost certainly unvaccinated least they‚Äôre quarantining exposed. Iowa they‚Äôre banning mask requirements, contact tracing quarantining exposed. get mean America blame parents kid gets hit car front house hahaha consuming enough zinc vitamin /s wish could upvote 10 times. staffing needed would horribly expensive normal year like half staff would sitting idle collecting paycheck literally nothing there's even enough patients 1:1 staff patient ratio. lose people boredom. kidding. diminish severity COVID itself, pandemic really illustrated poor capacity many local medical systems are.

In home state (Oregon), there's deep concerns [1,000 projected hospitalized patients could overwhelm state's medical system. state 4.22 million people.

I'm sure there's intricacies hospital administration appreciate, seems crazy shock 0.02% population could bring system knees Worthless everyone except make it? Yes, still unvaccinated people, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs fueling surge. said, King County deeply liberal, rest state isn‚Äôt nearly much get Seattle deeper red gets. Mind boggling, it? bill actually major concession, currently school district offers *any* virtual learning loose significant funding. 

This bill would change schools offer virtual options, caps virtual learning 10% school district's student population loose money. nice them! hospital. I'm completely convinced, contagious say Delta is, usual cloth masks people wear protecting Delta. Wondering there's data this.   Hospital collapse faster guess. Lose hope regards what? personal health? Finances/job? Lockdown masks? 

It go away long time, probably never, neither 1918 pandemic, became seasonal like lots flu like diseases. Right experts seem believe things get much worse today, least West. Thing open becomes less deadly practice due vaccinations natural immunity. might outbreaks local problems, family vaccinated really would try stop worrying. fuck all. look closely, she‚Äôs wearing mesh mask. hate state‚Ä¶  old daughter? gist lot federal government taken programs historically state domain. I‚Äôm talking way back beginning country. also things like civil rights, federal government couldn‚Äôt anything twisted around constitution find power step require equal rights. alot FDR policies etc. 

TLDR: Desantis de facto setting precedent give state power federal government simply abdicating responsibility. lmao. 1 2 adults chronic health condition. 1 4 two more. i‚Äôd venture guess people think way aren‚Äôt healthy think Giving little year half in?

Giving Delta variant 8 months first identified?

Even without significant deaths, effects Long Covid necessitate persistence finding solution throwing hands air saying *oh well, can't stop it*. sort defeatist loser attitude guy espousing? 1st world healthcare ever truly overwhelmed since 2020? None. Mostly see reply. amuse me. f√ºr diesen Vollidioten NJ definitely slowing down. state reporting drops transmission rate week two, number new cases begun decelerating. guarantee continue case schools coming back cold weather starting months, also guarantee going get really bad either. variants actually evading immune system, making way existing vaccinations function, moot.   Im Kansas well it‚Äôs amazing populated areas see masking smaller towns one wearing mask. Yeah think that's mean. Vaccination work (broadly. works fine individually) vaccine compliance high enough Link us ‚Äúplenty evidence‚Äù   agree. I‚Äôm anxious get son vaccinated, board ‚Äúapproval now!!!‚Äù mindset seeing much of. approved it‚Äôs proven safe. don‚Äôt WANT approved then. think schools postponed opening, though. roll d20 instead d4 still get 1 mean d20 nothing you?

Covid, like dice, super random. Vaccines reduce severity least 90% still roll 1. People vaccinated, wearing masks around others, wash hands regularly, still spread asymptomatically, however unlikely may be.

The guy plane knew COVID, put people's lives danger KNOWINGLY. case absolutely charged found guilty. well know fact black communities served? subreddit talks time. assumptions somehow racist unless explicitly mentioned narrative? Feels hopeless two feelings get together second read ""to 73.9%"", scary moment.   Yeah. us healthy strong immune system going kill us all! s/ anecdote means nothing. would venture people don‚Äôt positive tests, people exists all. We'll dead long varient z comes.  Mmmm. Since I'm going harvest old fashion way gelding probably best approach. Maybe keep smart ones find smart ones harvesting like bulls dont need lot them. funerals. damn rube armies Again, motorcyclists overwhelm healthcare system point others lack care need. would consequence banning/severely limiting travel nurses? say that? You‚Äôre really missing point here. explain;

Let‚Äôs assume Covid kills 1% people, stated originally.

Let‚Äôs also assume admitted hospital perhaps 5% chance dying (1 20 people dying admitted seems *very* high, let‚Äôs go it). 

Now let‚Äôs assume right every single death caused error (10%) caused inexperienced nurse (also obviously overestimate).

Even use overly generous numbers, means go hospital 0.5% chance dying hands inexperienced nurse - half stated Covid risk 1%. 

To match 1% Covid fatality rate claimed, one every ten hospital admissions would end death. course nonsense. 

Do see? Reread initial sentence, it‚Äôs ludicrous.

Put another way, you‚Äôre hospital 10% chance you‚Äôre going die medical mistake. however *already dead* lying hospital morgue, 10% chance mistake killed you.

You‚Äôre mixing denominators, quite dramatically. They‚Äôre blocking virtual learning too? kidding? would literally pack house move. studies showing Covid reduced gray matter brain? Shirt shoe policies anti-hippy mandates. anti-mask mandates thing ‚Äúanti-liberal‚Äù mention staffing needed. Yes, read. describe isn‚Äôt medicine works. 

We fortunate US generally never consider notion rationed care. best parallel make organ transplantation, need exist ‚Äúrationing‚Äù number available organs smaller number transplant candidates. 

Under criteria aware ‚Äúcause need transplant‚Äù come play, except effects suitability transplant, life expectancy, medical need, survival benefit, etc. Someone requiring liver transplant prior alcohol abuse ‚Äúlower score‚Äù someone requiring one due genetic disorder simply origin illness (again, origin may play role *other* factors score, origin *itself* scored.)

So guarantee almost absolute certainty circumstances would vaccination status determine care decisions way describe. anything probably *better* effect 12 weeks, there's enough studies yet. small study older people indicated immune response much better 12 3/4 weeks.

Nothing worry all. even 20, 30, 52, would get one? Remember vaccine does, prompts body make antibodies, good regardless interval. Maybe could reach parents 400 kids died Covid see they're living happy, normal lives? maybe thousand currently hospitalized Covid right now? ones vents perhaps? kids living happy normal life mask precautions parent gives shit kids taking.

Since vaccinations fully prevent getting virus (moreso lessen severity), drawing correlation Iceland experiencing may expect states get higher rates vaccinated people. solution ration care unvaccinated IMO. know, gotta hand finding way monetize that.

Whoever brainwashed tell worst flu season cause hospitals turn patients away Conditions outside hospitals unsafe, too. Antivaxxers filling them, antivaxxers protesting them. 

Cedars-Sinai LA targeted protesters harassed punched breast cancer patient hospital.

Cancer patients going wear masks, it‚Äôs Covid. either work make higher begin rationing care unvaccinated. asked data, cherry picked interpretation it. ‚ÄúVirtually zero‚Äù zero, lives still stake here, spite wishful thinking. action protect people getting fucking vaccine. dumbasses refuse do. can't people admit wrong? move forward right direction? bringing country &amp; world down. hope anti vaxxers get sick covid end hospital, insurance company refuse pay part bills. I'm actually kind surprised more. want people die, many people ICUs. thought would more. getting better treating covid? snake oil salesman said crap? (Looks Dr Oz)  Literally everything said true. size population really relevant. think state 92% 16s vaccinated. This. I‚Äôm dealing same. Think back - get worse around time wave started pick live started checking Reddit frequently? I'd blame Alabama one. moved Mexico US years ago. citizen one thing realized is: Americans selfish idiots. 

I see states microcosms. Southeast states worst, far believe article describes pretty well, it‚Äôs cost saving employers. bigger employers ‚Äúself-insured‚Äù, meaning pay bills use health insurance companies ‚Äúadministrators‚Äù plan. 67% workforce US covered self funded plans per 2020 data. googled excess mortality Japan read couple studies examining data Jan-July 2020 April/Oct 2020 apparently significant excess mortality periods.

But Japan special. crowded cities people super mindful others respect rules. term you‚Äôre looking at-will employment (rather right-to-work), case employment 50 states plus D.C. Multiple Sclerosis Exactly underestimate stupidity anti-vaxxers. Tillamook tiny town 2 hour drive big airport (PDX)! Also, means Portland, Eugene, Salem denied patients PNW spiking like crazy, too. reinstated mask mandates activated National Guard. Normally, Idaho sending patients OR, WA. not, turns power thing first place   county hospital, no, greedy profit-motivated executives. system runs shoestring. Exactly this. understand think killing base good long-term strategy. Oh well, quicker die overall better humanity. Florida here, bad. people need can't get damn hospital bed! Yes be, want freedom take comes good bad.
Yes choice, consequences free. you‚Äôve started feeling bit bit year? don‚Äôt think comes goes like that. say last couple weeks mental health taken total dive media focus Corona again. I‚Äôve start getting back working trying eat better. 

I doctor say stress another covid wave sent depression working via better eating workouts out. mileage vary unrelated.  Excellent points. came conclusion based available data. *shocked Pikachu face*

Who saw coming? wonder way court rule? Well exactly happens flu.

Not sure agree it, sure else do, cannot lockdowns 5 years. situation one year better. People wanted already got vaccine. thing vaccinate children, stop COVID-19, spread easily now. Perhaps reward people getting covid unvaccinated, give parents 1000 dollars sending child school sick? first time Republican ever launched campaign give people unemployment reason? Sounds legit. may condemning children grow without parent. kids didn‚Äôt choose parent get vaccinated. could hit poor neighborhoods particularly hard. get caught lose job insurance. 2 2 infuriates me.  vaccinated healthy safe. OOF! Sincere thanks clarifying. probably respectfully disagree believe happened Provincetown outlier sensationalized media. Andrew Sullivan, usually disagree says better here. Ehhh Massachusetts we‚Äôre really middle pandemic, we‚Äôre end pandemic. people vaccinated we‚Äôre like 1-2 deaths day. one really care covid anymore here.

Everyone party vaccinated. What‚Äôs issue? gives shit  study done last Summer, every person age 18 died Covid serious co-morbidity.

Source that?  Hmmm. recall, treatment ideas detrimental not. Either way, read sources. remain unimpressed. Politifact article end state Maddow's claim false. However, several paragraphs health officials thought could more, gave examples. 

I read second one also. tweet stating get shots dazzle either. think president constantly encouraging people. Standing enthusiastically behind science vaccines. Giving incentives. Getting shot publicly. Unifying country. Which, mean said safe couple times true. enthusiastically tell people amazing science really are. point, one now, needs drilled people's head due misinformation.

 watch video linked? know really long. repeatedly says get COVID vaccine. safe. effective. free. think said least 4 times. encouraged one questions go reputable source like GP. encouraged schedule appointments. thanks ones got vaccine. explains saves lives. giving incentives. 

This governor though. I'm stating Trump (who history spouting unverified facts vaccines) handled differently could well better place now. Smokers pay states. No, (Germany) get hospital 30‚Ç¨ bill that's it. 10‚Ç¨/day pay yourself, everything else covered insurance.

I think point trying make, mandatory, socialized health insurance everyone US.

That hospitals etc overwhelmed number people ICUs due Covid probably everywhere. AKC registered purebred shitgibbons. Sign up. Probably hurts way. Everyone gets cookie except them. Wish US would less mulling acting. I'm pointing R0, commenter using modeling basis calculation, relevant looking spread communities susceptibility 100%. That's basic assumption model. try calculate new virus (or strains) modeling based approaches eliminate factors like policy (lockdowns), masking, mobility, population density, vaccination / prior infection. R0 believed estimate ""core ability"" virus spread nothing factors. supposed idealized number.

All said, true R0 hard estimate need build model, always get close ""intrinsic property"" intended. example, guy farm Idaho infected first animals, R0 lower. guy NYC infected first, R0 higher.

The Rt (the *effective* R considering factors like vaccination, lockdowns, etc.) [close influence factors. standard copy-paste response bringing old slippery slope fallacy claim lead exclusion smoke, maintain obesity, etc. 

However, what's missing understanding trivially easy get vaccinated compared to, example, quitting smoking losing weight. remedy easier. 30 minutes total nearest pharmacy coupled feeling great grand total day two. done. cannot get human able rationalize emotional argument first connecting emotionally. Use empathy, ‚ÄúI hear you, get you‚Äù statements, find shared connection. begin question, finally, present alternative thoughts many unbiased references. unvaccinated kids start back school (in person) nine days. *McMullen‚Äôs aunt said family want disclose whether McMullen vaccinated.* Got news you. healthcare system. Catholic Church supports vaccination. fact basically said anyone working Vatican better vaccinated they'd lose sounds fake

Edit- I‚Äôd also like add I‚Äôve back 7 days feel fine possible delta 3 weeks trip knows Where? kids vaccinated polio, 8 6.

Like, left dog car summer someone wanted step adult, get dog car take away me, gonna argue favor adult? ""city Omaha breaks record high covid cases new baby penguin arrives zoo""

Wow like anyone write headline tracking messed every direction, least little.

Plenty fully vaccinated people gotten reminders get second shot months later. Yes. Thank you.

Of course, can't forget recent phase huge swaths commenters saying ""Fuck kids, get sick/can stay home"" arguments vaccinated people wear masks anymore. 

And well, know delta, asymptomatic vaccinated people spread suddenly kids actually filling pediatric ICU. Oops. 

And also know handful people behind huge disinformation campaign regards covid. ""idiots"" essentially victims huge, coordinated propaganda machine. listened president, theoretically best interest heart. 

It hard pill swallow people president, supposedly best interest citizens heart, absolutely not. 

I young relatives kind, generally good people. They're succeeding college would call idiots. However, even face multiple relatives contacting covid, still refuse get shot ""because causes infertility."" 

Spoiler alert: doesn't. get idea? propaganda machine. 

 really hard charitable face apparent ignorance, sometimes try remember lot people victims massive international well coordinated disinformation campaign. 

TLDR: Even smart people fall dumb shit sometimes. Right. third. ICU holds 30 people, 10 people covid cases. reminder go get tetanus booster, least. (Last one 11 years ago.)   unvaccinated paying college, rent, healthcare, mortgage, healthcare, 401k, bills. yes, suppose pay bills come due! unless don‚Äôt take precautions gladly sign waiver support beliefs, include personal responsibility, fiscal conservatism, freedoms liberties.

No, maybe triage situation, factor.  Yes. Next question Awful advice. Listen doctors. Im DC  bunch ""Q celebrities"" turned actors past. thinking closer mark want be.  Really interesting. wonder simply certain type trained immune response. Also, vaccinated people would likely cautious people. I‚Äôm curious percent vaxxed people EXPOSED delta sick/seriously sick   oversimplified.

For one thing, UK Delta likely ""burn through"" entire population. general see daily case counts collapse, necessarily mean whole country 90% exposure similar. ""In every age, every place, deeds men remain same"" friend, born SK moved US baby, Korea teaching English adult. went doctor symptoms weird headaches blurry vision, 4 hours tests day, diagnosed brain tumor lasered week later. whole ordeal cost nothing. Jesus fucking Christ, mental proposition  meant dying going bankrupt can't afford health care big improvement? nothing romanticize about?

I wonder many dying day can't afford excessive cost meds, treatments went bankrupt procedure.  People really bad, long last? uncle covid pneumonia week goes ups downs ultimately feeling rough. O2 94-95 never really dropped claims difficulty breathing. bit hypochondriac stresses take claims seriously also cautioning try remain calm. Doctor gave zpack pneumonia taking otc fever hasnt fever like 2 days. sure point go hospital. 18 months? past 57 months? November 2016 mask really came off. Tate Reeves looks smart is. cares. let go yell street. don‚Äôt care they‚Äôre mad, people dying. government leaders need something healthcare system collapses. clearly asking people pretty please get vaccinated isn‚Äôt working. something works!  live Florida. Pretty sure DeSantis Trump speak regularly Trump tells say do. Conservatives super hypocritical this.  love local control except agree them.  confirm that! Yup obese smokers pay medical bills. weak argument leads never ending slippery slope one ends covered. uncertain, cancel appointment. Don‚Äôt know located, one areas crazy transmission, perhaps extensions put hold bit. data May. Now, many millions doses overwhelmingly safe vaccinations later, I'd argue study irrelevant people reevaluated positions since then. anyone get tinnitus first covid shot second? got jnj one shot developed tinnitus two weeks later. tinnitus volume decreased drastically months.

Anyone know studies this? article really bad. go actual non peer reviewed study get numbers. PhD appears hesitant educational levels, far hesitant factor. Also, median age resonant 50. really skew particular data set. van river. either dumb dumbs pay next year's premium. guess could raise non-vaccinateds' premiums (who doctor's note), like smokers. vaccinated person gets Covid, mild, make even stronger re-infections? obesity least partially uncontrollable. Vaccine refusal not.  Also Kentucky, heard friend mine talking people workplace coming Covid positive, masks anybody, light hearted atmosphere around. 

If people want die say let them, selfish choice inflicted want get sick. 55.8 percent bucks. Compare 48 percent. 7.8 percent big enough deal end situation? different yelling fire crowded theater. statement caused injury death. stepdad‚Äôs father passed away morning covid. father covid earlier year wasn‚Äôt vaccinated. thought covid hoax despite it. vehemently anti-mask. listened Facebook posts conspiracy theories rather trusting medical professionals. Misinformation killed him. 

Get vaccinated. It‚Äôs worth lifetime grief. Low trust government media. people get news Facebook. Poor quality education doesn‚Äôt emphasize critical thinking. Poor health infrastructure poor training medical professionals, many stay current recent advances medicine, vaccine skepticism uncommon among general practitioners doctors. Exactly. everyone couple weeks worth food supplies hand, even rich countries. get delivered. Well, people pickup delivery. people get product pickup points. people keep vehicles fueled maintained. There's huge population people need portion population quarantine. get Covid getting vaccine, you‚Äôll *much less* likely get vaccinated, probably feel like cold. get Covid without vaccinated, health history mentioned, it‚Äôs got pretty good chance leaving permanently disabled. 

And let clear, *will* catch it. idea could contain like 70% vaccination rate could one 30% rides that? window. It‚Äôs going away. Get shot smaller chance illness probably mild, catch full blown real thing hope best. understand fully choices. getting vaccinated *and* catching isn‚Äôt one anymore. Yes. irresponsible expect push cost selfish decisions rest society. Different development significantly different vaccine response?  Holding people accountable first step,
They obviously smart enough help help them?  looking state-wide vaccination levels. densely populated areas high vaccination levels live alone? accounting risks people around bringing covid you? Especially since know even vaccinated people mild symptoms potential spread covid. 

I find people tend blind spot accessing risks within family unit. know someone took social distance seriously wfh, ended getting covid wife still working office. Yesterday Zoom meeting support group. area blessed high.vaccination rate.

A guy joined told isolated felt. Why? feeling increasing tone ""shaming"" people who've vaccinated. He, hand putting off, w usual rationalizations. (He personal color)

Oh joy üò° wish did! Unfortunately think problem accelerating hospitals forced close due lack funds lack staffing, leads even fewer available clinical sites. part much talk getting ahead virus possibility healthcare collapse, think lot people focused problems right front problems see. Hospital staffing big issue people worried paychecks job...until end hospital late worry it.

I think could easily said climate crisis refugee crises, too. American culture tends focus immediate visible exclusion anything long-term distant, making giant culture change happen rapidly next impossible (this exclusive America, since we're talking American healthcare relevant). People pay token amount attention climate change might recycle, give eating beef drinking bottled water that's immediately convenient cheap, people dying floods fires would probably prioritize it. hospitals, could fund hospitals outside donations elective surgeries staff adequately emergencies additional training, people would rather tax dollars went roads schools see every day. 

I wish quick-turnaround solution would fix issues, there's pretty drastic cultural *and* resulting systemic change obstacles pretty insurmountable. whole country went work move mountain could get done pretty quickly, small town shovels still going mountain end year. Yeah I'm disagreeing you, hypothesizing seen now. pose interesting study, there's cross reactivity vaccinations diseases, exists. think would huge benefit public health could find answers may change treat diseases going forward.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* NY may 'only' 60% fully vaccinated rate, mid-June hit 70% partial vax adults (there fireworks show celebrating lol), partial vaccination still counts lot terms overall public health.

Florida consistently lagging behind (the state patchy lot extremely red demographics never get vaccinated) recent surge people realized might actually die vaccinations really tick overall. they'll start see benefits weeks, still 'too little late' many ways current surge. Rt high early July, I'm pretty sure vax rate 30's &amp; 40's, obviously stark contrast place like NY vaccination rates 50's, 60's &amp; 70's two weeks prior preparation oncoming Rt increase.

*-However, look occurred last year--south north movement epidemic what's occurring UK/Israel high levels infection despite higher level vaccination, region going escape infection surge.*

I agree this, think point escape it, we're it. August likely terms ""worst"" delta. really make sense delta hit place like NY decreasing Rt month see worst still yet come. correct going ongoing patchy slog different variables weather behavior patterns definitive end sight, waves also follow patterns. Rt went 1 June 21st guaranteed NY going see uptick cases, long Rt continues fall, even cases still rise little every week, goes 1 similarly guaranteed see wave drop.

I hope I'm wrong cold weather forced indoors cause terrible surge, actually incredible clear vaccination really showing key terms public health measures. increasing cases keep expecting see huge increase hospitalizations healthcare systems overwhelmed, that's happening. cases *lower* right now, still bigger increase hospitalizations. would thought halfway 2021 things would look bad surge beginning year? started several discussions son‚Äôs pediatrician lack socializing due covid said ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt worry, don‚Äôt need concerned he‚Äôs closer 3‚Äù (he 6 months time). I‚Äôm really starting think may need worry‚Ä¶ made decision pull daycare (before even went first day) don‚Äôt send him. easy decisions, days. key word ‚Äúwill‚Äù we‚Äôre quite yet - evidenced strain healthcare delta‚Äôs caused. 

It‚Äôll likely endemic, lot people are, rightfully, tired throwing towel saying ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs going away, I‚Äôll move on.‚Äù However large parts US policy hasn‚Äôt worked well. Brave yourselves. Winter literally coming Wait jj doesnt get boosters? comment freaking confusing Unexpected LOGH reference think we'll continue see regional outbreaks time time. continue worse states bad vaccination rates bad compliance mitigation measures. national lockdown. state announced decisions different days based choices. states never even locked down...but know think anybody recommends full lockdown Covid-19 extinct. We're balancing communal health social needs. people balancing former heavily. get rid governor? There's oodles pissed people one asshole surgery? covered, in-network surgery? emergency?

The annual out-of-pocket maximum $7,350 ACA. I'm curious ended $10k bill surgery. That's regulatory maximum, average maximum much lower.

What issue urgent, urgent care facility offered treatment for?

You see sorts claims time Reddit, rarely details. roommate tested positive covid, immediately left staying elsewhere recovers. tested negative. 100% safe return? googling finding concrete answers. delta killing vaccinated much people think example better leader worst president time second worst president time? Bold move, Cotton.  also idea still vaccinating polio. mom strict making sure got every vaccine kid (she even gave old vaccination pamphlet). Clearly something slipped cracks there. clearly support single payer. way go insane US it. also portrayed far wonderful reality. much like public education, chronically underfunded. Thats did. 2,000 cases month ago, versus 20 deaths (7-day running averages) now. That's 1% CFR bit low surprising. yeah- maybe vaxxes available populations

my risk assessment parent 4 year old lot different parent 14 year old lot different 30 year old without kids keep mind CFR IFR    That‚Äôs there's also errors databases uploading records too. I'm vaccinated local county tiny honestly sucks record keeping, took months record show up.

All someone make fake one say something database reflecting yet, time someone enough research find bs, anti vaxxers already intubated bed already taken.  said covid death rate 0.02% flu higher mortality rate. 

bad math good reason dump predicting drop cases northern states get winter everyone goes inside? will, fact, expand benefits everyone wants quit. Get vaccine, decline provide proof, set.   think southern states refused stop stopping kids vaccinated shut down? think southern states said mandated mask mandate shut down? think states openly said never shut suddenly change heart ""national leadership"" says should?

oh think suddenly declare constitution invalid? remember trump issue national shut either Humble question: supply abundant, demand 3rd shot strong (assuming doses cannot shipped countries expire), downside person vaccinated March getting third shot September? broken segments eligibility again? know, effective treatment exsited, really needed preventive policies. absence treatments need preventive solutions.   Enh. I‚Äôve medical ethics conferences, I‚Äôm still favor boot. Honestly point, there‚Äôs much gerrymandering don‚Äôt enough living base keep voted in.

Don‚Äôt get wrong, don‚Äôt want anyone fucking die, comes enough people die fucks removed political landscape there‚Äôs something pull least‚Ä¶

God fucking timeline depressing. ""Initial reports confirm water entering boat several different holes. help resolve urgent issue, state government opted drill holes boat give water means escape."" source that? guess OP's doctor part hospital network. received vaccine another part network, backend, signed something saying much.

My state require ID, insurance, etc 
 Huh? think missing point. Vaccines 100% never touted 100% efficacy. doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt work. 

Also, population vaccinated, higher proportion vaccinated breakthrough cases. take extreme example - 100% population vaccinated , 100% cases vaccinated. doesn‚Äôt mean vaccines don‚Äôt work. Read article misleading title graph. everything line normal. everything line minus covid collateral damage Improvement difficult US literally worst healthcare system developed world. low bar. like finding there's wealthy country public education system. crazy that's still situation.

But way many liberals talk single payer make sound like solution everything. rainbows unicorns. No, much like public education. glad it, there's lot problems. show tweets, tell they‚Äôre smarter doctors anyway, get real feisty security flash piece. wish could US. Hospitals completely full due anti-vaxxers. It‚Äôs reasonable response us. actually started decade ago, wealthy, like Mercer, Bannon, others realized could rile ‚Äúforgot about‚Äù rust belt, Midwest south. educated, easy get enraged angry playing ‚Äúthinking skills‚Äù letting believe smarter given credit for. 

The ironic part wealthy, like Bannon Trump, good making demographic feel like empathize one them, even though wealthy group intentionally manipulating them. use multiple platforms spread conspiracy ties, mistrust ‚Äútruth bombs‚Äù. 

When people economically mentally depressed, angry, feel helpless, fuel feelings use rage anger advantage. 

The end game divide distract masses, control everything behind curtain. people busy fighting Trump late 2019, didn‚Äôt even notice near-crisis overnight Repo market. 

When everyone busy watching circus, distracted latest social unrest, outrage, clickbait headline, always pay attention pulling strings behind curtain. There‚Äôs lot stuff ‚Äúhave‚Äù outside house choose to. Groceries delivered wife know way around kitchen. Amazon Walmart.com (as much I‚Äôm fan supporting Walmart) pretty much handle anything else might need/want. 

But there‚Äôs stuff go for, stack N95s‚Ä¶ lot tests screen decent accuracy variants. PCR test looks specific RNA sequence, usually three run. make one sequence found Delta, get pretty accurate screen Delta. course can't scale screening VOC's, couple significant mutations. Excuse ignorance different variants identified? test sample forwarded extra testing determine variant? I‚Äôm presuming that‚Äôs I‚Äôve real knowledge things. makes premeditated murder I'm worried myself, living Ohio. already masking culture plus low obesity helps lot. physician. I'm place cases ramping up. past 2 days I've admitted 4 COVID+ kids hospital. None COVID primary reason admission. me, spike much worse last winter, said, we're starting ramp past 2-3 weeks. sickest kid I've seen COVID obese 17 year old (roughly 400lbs) required BIPAP, okay. seen kids 10 require much whiff oxygen unless severe developmental delays compromising neurologic status. scared COVID kids would flu- granted, get flu shot every year though effectiveness hit miss. seen Delta variant make kids sicker. actually wonder causes less MIS-C last December, admitting three kids MIS-C per week, seen one since February. autoimmune history family, complication would fear COVID trigger Type 1 Diabetes; anecdotally we've seen LOT that. One week December admitted 18 new onset Type 1s 15 kind viral trigger. I've taken care 20 kids active cancers who've incidentally tested positive COVID, none required oxygen, convalescent plasma, steroids, remdesivir. 


Vaccine trials kids obviously awesome want thorough kids. one able say rushed trials. need careful littles, especially COVID poses lot direct risk them. feel frustratingly slow, trust FDA needs do. try rush EUA kids 12. world's resources diverted towards this, telling *no* country approved kids 12- that's indicative fact US inefficiencies causing issue. general, lot medications approved kids, frustrating, that's is. 


I've seen couple kids 2 months get COVID. never even actually get fever. However, *do* get fever, stay hospital infant 60 days, full workup monitor 36 hours make sure sepsis, even fever likely due COVID. Every hospitalized neonate I've seen COVID super well appearing went home 36 hour rule period. yes hospitalized primarily COVID safety reasons, they're getting sick it. 


No one seems care opinion sub though. Everyone wants downvote insist bad kids small pox measles. cardio home. nice treadmill big-screen TV right front it. agreed beta fitness pilot free exchange feedback, runs another three weeks I'm going new gym that. way expensive fancy afford free beta, free USED water aerobics closed indoor pool covid. cardio mask sucks, I'd rather home without mask treadmill.

Strength training could home much handweights exercise bands, I'm middle-aged woman power lifter need much equipment. like going Planet Fitness machines. Masks suck less strength training (but still kinda suck). people aren‚Äôt need even limit virus acceptable much US. vaccine yet serious illness deaths overrun hospitals.

It‚Äôs realistic assume minimal approach accepting risk work unless people get board vaccines.

It‚Äôs going happen. ""I grave concerns vaccine""

Would take Ben Franklin?

""Poke me"" 

'Murica   think understand gravity happened tbh. Listen reports ground. going door door, bloodshed starts soon. 


My LOL mocking previous one.....

You want talk reasonable? virus wiping Taliban even half innocents STILL BETTER facing. reasonable repression women deal alongside indoctrination fighting age males grew US occupation. WONT reasonable force use. 

If virus allowed get back control way shape form, would great them. think we'll see surge cases much smaller increase hospitalization Sweden never closed schools kids fine.  One-time vaccination generate much cellular immunity repeated natural infection we've every years human coronaviruses.

But COVID also simply severe disease - see something like 1/20,000 mortality 5-years-olds COVID, whereas first infection human coronaviruses kids mild measured (from internet says, anyway). probably need virologist put ""why"" one. measles deadlier chickenpox?  ""We rights also patients medical freedom!"" asking concerns Anthrax vaccine though, Covid vaccine? Discussing specifics one little - asking questions Covid-releated forum. Damn, every time read hurts heart. Hospitals for-profit businesses first foremost.  ran things differently they'd go business. never do. See Spanish Flu.. Heck, even help whole lot covid, better air filtration schools appears [well worth cost] increased test scores alone. pull church emails Feb-Mar 2020 encouraging safe practices, following local public health guidelines regarding masks, cancelling person meetings March 12th. pull examples similar guidelines since. Yep say tbh, others. mask info mistake saying others fact also protect think pharmacies allow you. got Moderna vaccine dose 1&amp;2, authorization allows 3rd dose vaccine.

At least, pick Moderna first 2 doses give option schedule Pfizer Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* pretty clearly said pro vaccine mandate healthcare workers.

Where say brought knowledge base say ones making medical decisions.

You say that, disingenuous. said full medical knowledge, compared doctor, excuse decision get vaccine. simply true, infection control integral part nurse's think divisive language making antivax movement stronger.

Because mollycoddling pandering anti-vaxxers worked well comment goal trying increase vaccinations, actually probably reduce them.

Or, realize comments little impact vaccination rates actions matter far more. case, ultimatum force get vaccinated pandering polarized redditors fake internet points.

Nah, I'm calling spade spade. really interested pandering antivaxxers sucking resources point. pretty sure Memphis main FedEx hub. Major transportation hub FedEx Memphis True, insurance companies typically bear cost, Medicare does. making virus got out. 90% people part San Diego live back wearing masks indoors. It‚Äôs 50-60% outside.  one main arguments anti-vax. Body immune system healthy body/immune system need 'supplemented' (or duper crazies might even say poisoned) vaccines. Dummies get rolling dice. Ok C19 like fart masks like underpants  Okay proving Moderna sure better Pfizer? know downvoted right. Even highly vaccinated states percentage required true herd immunity variant, community different levels. 

Until everyone vaccinated vaccinated problems variants unvaccinated propagate virus variants arise actually variant enough evolve different enough protein envelope start scratch. I‚Äôll want to. qualms figure? don‚Äôt really go anywhere don‚Äôt want to. mask required easily stay home go somewhere doesn‚Äôt require one.

It‚Äôs fairly simple. CDC implements sort indoor mask mandates businesses schools simply don‚Äôt go. business elects impose mask mandate whether CDC one simply don‚Äôt go.

So it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm ignoring rules, imposing boycott. damages businesses economy? Fuck em. nurse medical reason to, yes, getting vaccine, especially FDA approval goes through. Dr. Told unlikely could get exemption. He's 1 shot ""Yes. Yes. Go head. Tell us Cubans"".  consult doctor risk vaccine, one best him. That's best person asking. thought established early pandemic? new hospital wing takes long time. can't overnight.

Wasn't case last year [the Army Corps Engineers turned hotels ICU still clearly remember listening Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite giving detailed report achieved. March 2020 seemed like would non-issue.

I get need staff, that's longer ""no ICU beds left"" issue.

Side science death deserve attention nowadays. Depressing. wear seatbelt either take it. Let ask this. fair 2.7 million immuno-compromised people forcibly excluded public life others choose get vaccinated?

Because even though I'm vaccinated, I'm also immuno-compromised even vaccine there's still good risk catching catch it, it'll likely kill me. fair people like shut society choose get vaccinated get whatever want? 04/08/2021 fully vaccinated Pfizer. 

I attended second larger event last Saturday friends birthday celebration tested positive COVID-19 result. symptoms incredibly mild (low grade fever/chills, mild body aches, slight congestion). Today lost sense taste smell well. 

If you‚Äôre vaccinated, tested positive, lost sense taste/smell, long take come back? wish insurance companies would refuse cover unvaccinated people get diagnosed covid  Even well-vaccinated areas, infected visitors passing virus vaccinated people.

Yeah, hardly worth mentioning. really wish media would stop harping irrelevant factor. 96-99% infections UNvaccinated people. ^ reporting 28 29 27 deaths per day?? highest flu death rate last ten years 61,000 2017-2028. entire United States. years much less that. 

Texas covid-19 deaths surpassed annual US death rate flu last ten years. fairness covid deaths since epidemic began, true comparison. theorized awhile cases, viruses trigger adult onset type 1 diabetes autoimmune issues. immune systems react body tissues, cells produce signals tell killer cells essentially 'calm down, go inert' attack tissues. possible virus present allows signal ignored overwhelmed. infection, ton signals produced tell killer T-cells 'there's problem here, job'. much latter signal present immune system identifying wrong threat lead autoimmune issues.

We still typically say certainty specific patient acquired type 1 diabetes virus unless clear infection came right issue, factors play like genetic predisposition (I mutation CTLA4 immune system less capable making 'calm down' signal.) Right statistics adult onset T1D COVID concerning. keep mind week day. around 25k/week worst winter surge. Seems people think I‚Äôm talking myself.

I tried explain : surge lack vaccination. agree. watch 24 news ""Murds"" channel.

UGH! I'm tired propaganda &amp; misinformation. Bruh know illegal. know CNN reported million unauthorized boosters estimated given US, advice unless doctor advises it. mean people 55 plus 20, 30 40 years -so 75, 85, 95 years old.  work hospital couple know good reasons vaccinated. others Facebook groups. actual scientific reason, conspiracies. sad need go. people getting third dose? Using site internet connectivity lying asked? Even mobile sites connected. getting new driver's license now, never used married name?  Agree.. I'm surprised all. feel like new parents neglectful general always purpose.

It's forced work longer hours parents absent keep expenses. also internet addictions social media, watching streaming etc.

He'd least know covid, instead bamboo ballots China whatever. Yeah, that's true.

Btw, know, parents (who 71 72) got Pfizer vaccine back March April. Since efficacy wanted bit them, still protected severe infection Delta variant? (They definitely get third booster shot becomes available.)   signed CVS website asked taken previous vaccination. simply signed first Pfizer shot. Bro someone crashes car report insurance, rates go like crazy. telling me, people, choose huge risk factors, getting measly price increase? 

I say measly, money, free solution problem  Irony: ""ritual"" ""spiritual"" consequences getting caught making distributing also pretty non-trivial. early spring dude California got caught making feds charged impersonating government entity something along lines, carries potential lengthy prison sentence. feds charge people ton evidence confident charges stick I'd terrified treated someone told ""don't take vaccine microchips"" whatever fb excuse they've seen posted. It'd make question anything say they're wanting treat medical issue. Again, fully understand reasons people want possibly miss couple days. alternative possibly getting sick missing weeks months worse. That's part understand--by measure, ""lesser two evils"" getting vaxxed. parents need free daycare /s  Well Couldn‚Äôt unvaccinated immigrants? big change past Ca 2 months - masks getting leaving public transport. risk involved hospitalizations low,  American 'nurses' I've come across fall anti-vax category Aus work aged care sector. I've put quotes around tend consider someone 12 month course qualified enough considered real nurse. glorified care attendant. Issue is, vast majority near 1000 death come people 65+ aged care. crazy fuckers. overwhelming majority mutations meaningful consequences, even harmful virus. What‚Äôs more, tiny fraction virus particles within infected person cause infections. Almost mutations accumulate within host lost infection resolved. Also, time infections short, natural selection little opportunity pick ‚Äúbest‚Äù mutants infect new hosts.


That's something relieving. Since last year heard virus change much mutates, let's hope pain ass vaccines.   could case almost people hospital right now...if taken vaccine! bad. idea old news. :) Paywall ‚Ä¶ Probably join FLDS wives ultra priesthood blessings.

I‚Äôm also exmo. literally figure authority media, politics religion assholes turn backs they're told something already believe. proves people following logic, facts truth need anything keep admitting they're wrong. guess entitled opinion. Personally see two things equivalent all. Killing children spear gun orders magnitude crazy, suspicion intentionally daft. Virtually every ‚Äúmajor‚Äù world religion advised adherents get vaccinated, guess Mormonism major. 

Interestingly, reading Christian Science Monitor earlier today (Christian Science, *not* Scientology). used pick print edition stumbled upon years ago legitimately solid paper: fact-checked, intelligent, open minded, fairly liberal, well designed. 

But online edition today virtually Covid news opinion pieces‚Ä¶ column plague affected women economically‚Äîfair enough. 

Nothing vaccines, either against, curious considering state world right now. know traditionally shun medicine favour prayer. recommend seeing optometrist, dentist, scant practitioners. wondering anyone knows official position Covid vaccines.  Yep. They've convinced intelligent, compassionate, trusting science bad thing makes ""weak"". Propaganda one helluva drug.  Anyone buys fake card idiot. app includes driver's license vaccination status (that verified Louisiana Dept Health). I'm going right now, get impression app primarily way businesses going check vaccinated. CDC cards ain't gonna cut anymore.

ok. ugly.

it helps reason can't find many debates evolutionary biologists creationists, climate scientists deniers. two sides can't come agreement debate rules, debate.

Real epidemiologists, climate scientists, evolutionary biologists want facts debate *facts*. is, peer-reviewed, coming studies used scientific method made substantial effort remove bias. Anti-vaxxers, creationists, climate change deniers kind data, really want allow anecdotes, personal stories, unscientific unverified studies follow standard methodology. agree debate excludes kind evidence have, scientists agree debate admits consider bullshit methodological grounds. always reccomend people check http://projectn95.org. They‚Äôre non-profit that‚Äôs covered major news outlets sources legitimate PPE including N95s KN95s. I‚Äôve placed many orders highly recommend them. Good, even think it, medical field. thanks old news, thats mandate masks vaccinated vehicle they're carried goes FedEx hub Tennessee first, cards would head New Orleans. shipping logistics Don‚Äôt see downside here. 

Seems like people you‚Äôd rather nurses. One family members (who vaccinated) benefited antibody treatment recently. really bad case, helped bounce back avoid hospitalization aside infusion. 

Its unfortunate many selfish people exist, work greatly appreciated many others! God‚Äôs one true prophet saying

Just trying parse statement outsider. means head Mormon Church considered par historic figures known prophets? amazing people willing lose job, family, even life want get FREE, EFFECTIVE shot frees much trouble stress. like enjoy living crap life. work public school, self fund, insurance committee member union. everything keep costs down, including charging smokers unless go go 6-week smoking cessation class. toyed around mandatory health classes people high BMI, etc. would different. take mandatory blood test, would simply require vaccine proof, get shot pay higher year. 
If insurance company going charge us high risk people, going everything discourage high risk behavior. turn, discount fees take actions. schisms church - teach sunday school - instance succession crisis Joseph Smith killed (you LDS Church Community Christ), next disavowed polygamy, ended LDS church Fundamentalist LDS churches.

One could argue black members allowed priesthood drove membership fundamentalist branches.

I'm interested speculation would take, point we're talking semantics. bottom line he's going anywhere. Money. they‚Äôve never heard cytokine storm

Unfortunately one common anti vax sentiments read vaccine causes cytokine storm. lot things accuse vaccine either least common actual Covid 19 (including blood clots). Neither believing sure China Jan 2020. people say they‚Äôre cool dying it‚Äôs turn. Spite toxic character flaw it‚Äôs literally killing them.

There zero quota. zero discussions among leaders xyz ward needs gain additional tithing funds. 

Also former missionary also zero quota baptize. wrong throwing around falsehoods. hope doctors nurses get paid well enough moonlight Uber drivers. Unfortunately, pretty much ""most everybody gets COVID, go back normal accept every often people get COVID.""

High vaccination rates mean many people get exposed asymptomatic never even know it, pretty much equivalent getting (once pandemic outbreak transmission big concern.) 

COVID significantly dangerous flu *to vaccinated people people before.* enormously dangerous immunologically naive. year so, enough population either exposed gotten sick return normal life.

This would happened *already* Delta come along insanely high transmission rate. US it‚Äôs registry. don‚Äôt agree. believe shouldn‚Äôt able work certain settings.

Masks/distancing halt international travel annihilated flu. may take years climb back normal flu seasons. 
The flu ‚Äútravels‚Äù North South hemispheres, always multiplying it‚Äôs winter, constantly mutating. safety measures preventing local transmission lack travel preventing strain migration flu fizzled big time. Im 37 fully vaccinated, wear mask. Suck covid. wish anti-vaxxers would take advice know bs. Sunday Times excellent journalism this.

It's lengthy article inescapable conclusion absolutely cannot trust Chinese Communist Party. Taiwanese known decades unfortunately raised alarm, one listened.

The inescapable conclusion fringe theory Lab Leak (although never seen fringe!) likely explanation virus exists.

The US intelligence report due end month expect conclusion support Lab Leak theory. Depends state. Midwest, Sturgis bike rally closed South Dakota (and attracts hundreds thousands states around), state fairs canceled like last year (Minnesota Iowa biggest, MN gets 2+ million IA gets 1+ million visitors), happening *before* school starts. many members anti-mask/anti-vax

Every Mormon know got vaccinated day 1 available. Maybe Mormons east coast liberal Utah?  [Virginia great resource breaks cases, hospitalizations, deaths vaccination recently could restrict data date range, reason functionality gone now. 

[Fortunately, posted week ago, still working, vax vs. not-vaxed data July 1 July 30th, Virginia, 97.69% cases fully vaccinated individuals, 96.05% hospitalizations fully vaccinated individuals, 94.75% deaths fully vaccinated individuals. So, vaccine perfect, vast majority getting COVID right unvaccinated. Breakthrough infections rare (303 fully vaccinated vs 12784 fully vaccinated). I've rubbing oregano paste. wrong? answer entirely correct public health standpoint. Sure. Kinda like missionary ever baptism quota. day supermarket saw three Buddhist monks.

Doesn‚Äôt look like Missouri following pattern tho - seems stuck smoker overweight ""comorbidity."" literal definition term *more one disease*, *more one risk factor*. Risk factors like smoking may may play *any* role personal experience get COVID, pretty random.

Having said that, heard studies suggest smokers, people proximity wildfires unhealthy people slightly higher risk getting sick get COVID, literally everyone combination risk factors may may factor all. yes, previous poster said, virus wants.

Noone ever saw Zodiacs face. Seems like beef commenter, definition word ""pandemic"". mormon guy checking in:

our leaders saying since **very beginning**. first ones get vaccinated...they've telling us vaccines miracles God...they've asking us mask stay socially distanced. Meanwhile parents outside protesting mask mandate act like jerks. uncivil it? Yeah, NY, Saratoga County highest 66% people fully vaccinated, lowest county 35%. much different Florida 69%-22%. biggest difference Gov Hochul imposes restrictions mask/vaccine mandates winter DeSantis has. question didn‚Äôt push sooner. change messaging scared little needle bad many people wont wear masks, act like Pandemic going on. Iceland exists. There's data. Also 62 76 much smaller difference 82 42 probably statistically significant. Pfizer worse every month numbers biggest drop July Delta took almost totally. Delta increased month recent months. think there's little chance data incorrect. learned earlier day another comment, thought would share :) N95 designed smaller particles pm2.5 it? think pm2.5 2.5Œºm N95's filter 0.3Œºm particles greater. would make great pm2.5 least. interesting article shows us numbers much official stats actual stats differ. I'm sorry we're go kind stuff. I'm switching jobs get away people, I'm distancing family members malignantly narcissistic danger everyone.

You're right thing. ever question yourself, remember virus opportunist. needs seconds breaths, destroys everything path rhyme reason. people spares wake become delusional, seeing brush harm kind proof they're smart virus dangerous.

Anti vaccine anti mask bullshit killing people. preventing transmission, denying virus access people care about. winning.   yeah failure 5th wave, clearly.  Cool. response looking for. Thank you. changed mind. covid last November vaccine (not sure kind) last March. started coming covid symptoms 4 days ago. took 2 tests showed I'm negative, today lost taste smell. Anyone something similar happen? Beautiful Wtf even mean?  Yes, people, especially young children exposed it.

Furthermore, think bad, get flu shot year. We're likely rough winter wife RN clinic large hospital, said one doctors leaving due requiring vaccination. sure plan is, since big hospitals requiring it. KN95 masks may fit children better. I've worn would say prefer KN95 errands day day use. going way higher. employer requiring proof vaccination compliance wellness program. wellness compliance = premium subsidy. That's mighty steep increase. Easily +$500 month least full family covered policy. That‚Äôs fine. patience long gone comes anti-vaxers...I pity left anyone willingly keeping us situation whole society sake ‚Äúindividual rights‚Äù. I‚Äôve done everything right 16 months still can‚Äôt get back normal people‚Äôs actions. I‚Äôm tired frustrated. cutting privileges mandates vaccine passports takes get us this, I‚Äôm it. Implement yesterday. Agreed. get approval kids get vaccinated, everyone school sharing air, we‚Äôre still Mr. Covid‚Äôs wild ride can‚Äôt gun. I‚Äôm same. coworker, infection prevention nurse, said health care system very, close also requiring vaccine staff. Here‚Äôs why: exposure nurse potentially exposed patient COVID. patient quarantine get tested, delayed discharge nursing home several days. patient didn‚Äôt actually get COVID imagine repercussions did? Lawsuits, refusals pay medical bills, Dept Health reviews, etc. truth U.S. health care business, unvaccinated nurses financial risk. think we‚Äôll see hospitals require immunization staff soon‚Ä¶ really hope we‚Äôll able get moderna booster went Pfizer  That's definitely reason  Good Absolutely. 

If reject vaccines, masks, science, doctors recommendations, CDC warnings.... go hospital get COVID-19. 

Have courage convictions. See way through.  ""Your child wait another child die""
What fucking way put it, honor Ireland still requires it. totally would still wear hadn't. religious want go bad place murder.  one seems care.

So yeah. Florida. don‚Äôt stop hand hygiene! non-expert theory: RSV usually continually circulates populations, bad kids catch early (under 2) first time. Everyone exposed annually (or more?) gets asymptomatic case, keeps immunity.

Masks, distancing, especially virtual school meant circulation nearly halted last year, spreading like wildfire immunity waned like never before. Makes sense. Refusing get vaccinated intentional health risk, similar tobacco usage. helpful tip realize there! Thanks! enough data support right now. Keep mind, there's fair bit noise data. Here's month-by-month breakdown study:

March: Moderna = 91%; Pfizer = 89%
April: Moderna = 91%; Pfizer = 88%
May: Moderna = 93%; Pfizer = 83%
June: Moderna = 62%; Pfizer = 82%
July: Moderna = 76%; Pfizer = 42%

As see, Moderna dropped 62% June popped back 76%. Obviously that's actual efficacy changing, noise data. quite possible (even likely) Pfizer's low July numbers thing. said, barely disguising glee.  Sorry. agree approach discourse. Thanks replies taking time. Nothing w ever convince right  believe 110% it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe illegals‚Äù. Nothing w change mind.  places, maybe.  case curves many states, though still rising, appear slowing down.  hospitalizations deaths peak two three weeks peak case generation.

Just clear, delta emerged country low vaccine availability time - India. may seem like small difference, it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm absolving responsibility - part lead massive wave traveling religious festivals. literally excuse time. Yeah, think peak taking days arrive. Maybe end end month. CDC 91% chance carry transmit. 9% people show could carry spread though. people chance hereditary heart conditions. questions come person live boat, think forced vaccinated, I'm trying find people educated topic say. Blows mind working field health care choose reject science meant protect health others. mean think really depends were. Philly hospital well 100 covids patients last winter. late spring early summer 10 even zero times. think 13-15 right Gotta say I'm actually annoyed nurses getting vaccinated go college-based program many science electives nursing school. Sorry anything doctors coworker. get nursing degree pass boards taken many science classes know vaccines work. Many vaccines like hepatitis B often influenza mandatory able work healthcare. I'm really getting tired lemmings jumping cliff. vaccinated people.don't need hospitals *rolls eyes* We‚Äôre one now. It‚Äôs mostly Cold War, Capitol attacked earlier year. sure say that, CDC site says 119K. agreeing poster. 60-80% great benefit 100%. run marathons guarantee fine get covid.  Sort second. One theory saw it‚Äôs direct cause somebody developing diabetes never would it, things move prediabetes-to-diabetes track along decades faster shortages everywhere though, don‚Äôt go hot zone make bank. You‚Äôre assuming feel anything all. problem people like Reddit can‚Äôt separate ad hominems people asking honest questions discourse. everything emotional Yeesh. Theres lot misinformation cross signals there. People scared, stupid. way pandemic gone blame people questions. Like myself. let die point fuck body choice extremely basic thing correct for, abundantly clear obesity major risk factor poor outcomes Covid.  Totally. B*den says wants donate 110 million like, China going way forward 2 bi. ask me, IMO US vax management fucked up. Liz Cheney right there....when one side insane...   25 percent vaccinated well. So, numbers actually great. great analogy. Oh ffs! Insurance companies might well. money little blow back. think Novavax receive approval vaccine?  someone spear gunning children brain point blank make good person. ridiculous dichotomy.  way get situation force people get vaccinated. hope would never reach point people would want get shot get back normal it‚Äôs clear solid chunk US brain dead are... forgot that. might really explain anti vax stance. Sounds like orange mentor  Idk wants people die know wants potus polling near top. ""We right also medical patients freedom."" covid. got vaccinated. got covid again.im glad chose vaccination. Jesus Christ bad strain   read ""Will ever end?"" C3PO's voice Karens: they're charging people stood oppression? expression woman left quite something. US situation complex. much supply little demand, one would imagine selling gifting doses countries desperately want would thing, like example Taiwan US important strategic relationship with. that's something going happening, people getting unauthorized booster shots would better use doses discarding them. 

It's moral question legal one tbh. young, healthy, already vaccinated perfectly good J&amp;J? consider think there's chance depriving someone another country shot(who needs lot you, already pretty much invulnerable severe covid). older comorbidities, seems unlikely doses state go anywhere else, maybe fair enough get boost. Sweet, might well go back paying preexisting conditions.

Like real, makes sense fat people pay fore insurance long term effects known yet. Thalimide safe, even promoted pregnant women. Took years babies born missing limbs deformities stop giving pregnant women. impossible know side effects yet vaccine thats still running clinical trials. Clinical trials exist reason. assess safety, efficacy longterm effects medication. I've vaccine understand hesitation people long term side effects known yet. Deaths per capita better measure bad things suck. adore want WH Floridians perfect opportunity year. suggest look upon last year consider really wise keep man control power Florida. somebody jail worthless imbecile people feel strongly medical freedom keep hospitals invariable get Covid take bed someone better reason getting vaccinated. think climate courtesy mother nature make end get lot sooner point, nations (with exception couple) high risk. 
Leaders many countries failed citizens, initial outbreak, Delta discovered. 
""High risk"" what's next? ""Ludicrous risk""? get sick shots vaccine mean immune system good?

I 48 hours fever weakness first Sputnik three weeks ago, identical side effects second dose now. highly insulting people Berlin. That's we're talking about. OP's original article references ""sticks"", ""surcharges"" ""jumps"" illegal. Carrots/incentives use punishment anti-vaxxers higher rates simply possible ACA HIPAA.   That‚Äôs cultists heads didn‚Äôt. said ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt expect many **positive tests**.‚Äù It‚Äôs much dog whistle politics base primed believe test results cannot trusted they‚Äôre inflated. hear you, frustration heard millions others, please don‚Äôt let world turn someone essentially says 6.1 million human beings reside state Missouri ravaged plague wiped face earth.

There good people live there, got vaccinated soon could, kids yet eligible vaccines live there.

This world enough pessimism, u/jodys_fetus much :) 2 nasal swabs. One self-administered fast return test site. Another one done clinic nurse.  Kids vaccinated. even single payer happen. centralized federally run medical records. also made realize family members covid-deceased persons may also swing away R leadership essentially leading slaughter. kidding? base **loves** he‚Äôs doing. They‚Äôre fully convinced cannot believe lying eyes. want rat wife's friend kind teacher. keeps using fake vaccine card everywhere That's unvaccinated though it?  argue everyone refused vaccine right? Please quote that. 

You‚Äôre setting strawman arguments declaring victory win argument yourself. pretty big dice throw. Children definitely showed resistance first round virus. Delta definitely changed that. 

As whether children region better behaved? entirely possible. Generally speaking there's good arguments made functional society overall. 

Based behaviors adults country, expect children exactly conformist sticking rules. 

My personal experience growing may different others, remember kids pretty much whatever pleased soon someone watching them, sometimes even then.

How match experiences growing up? looking paperwork. They‚Äôre calling shot given. IMHO sooner later good way 80% cases vaxxed people. Worst outbreak yet far. They're working intended fortunately stopping disease pretty clear mostly vaccinated population sustain epidemic new variants like COVID emerge. chief Epi stated 93% vaccination among age 15 brought herd immunity clear vaccinated people pretty easily get infected spread it. 6th vaccinated country that's pretty awful. use several different vaccines there. He's going claim completely right whenever controlled. base beyond repair. Dumber could ever imagine. guys US quite intense spread too, sound insensitive fair number 70s would succumb covid got it, already got it, around affect statistics anymore... sure big impact would overall numbers though. didn‚Äôt think people believed healthy get sick read obituaries deceased person believed healthy get sick. I'm sorry loss.... like aunt, I'm also sorry future loss. 

Stay strong, lonely year alright. Crimes humanity Exponential growth that. vaccine rates different enough explain orders magnitude differences hospitalization rates. vaccinated parts country significant delta surge later, surprised. political interest appear it. Anything try make Biden look bad. asshat. sick  Florida stuck stupid season. Florida isn‚Äôt island though. It‚Äôs giant wiener US explains many dickheads thought got weak summer..? C‚Äômon Ron. Catching releasing covid positive illegal immigrants certainly *helping* pandemic. world *legal* travel severely restricted due pandemic makes absolutely sense ignore effects illegal travel. Again, goal increase vaccination rates try spread accurate information. Calling people idiots/scum saying worse legit crazy murderers going accomplish goal. Trying empathize address issues lead vaccine hesitancy correct approach.

If goal instead feel morally superior, trade righteous indignation internet points let stop you. understand making problem worse. Realize might vaccine hesitant person reading thread might fence getting vaccine, read post get pushed away insulted rhetoric. Case growth exponential, quadratic. Sure model change growth try extrapolate, idea reproductive rate changing. case Florida, instance, certainly flattening testing capacity. think done vaccines were/are hard come Europe. second Pfizer dose Thursday around noontime. felt good rest day.

I'm hoping feel better tomorrow! Hmm... think know Washington state well outside Seattle then.

Those parts high transmission rates fill beds statewide. deal Oregon.  Taking swing woman using metal water bottle weapon. Also brave enough wear mask Target.

What specimen. Worked ITU. Flu vaccinators came ward vaccinate staff. 2 members staff ended anaphylaxis requiring beds medical attention ITU. impression was, pretty certain reported publicly time one first get people ventilators fat look second derivative case growth ‚Ä¶ acceleration fits parabolic pattern predict it‚Äôs go negative (which means deceleration decline) San Francisco less likely elect idiots school board governor. mandatory vaccines staff, masks, monitoring program. 87% population 12 years old least one vaccine dose.

We far eager shut airlines bars. Schools financial resources afford put plexiglass dividers desks. maintain adequate airflow. Many children cooperative 6ft marching distances. Specific classrooms specific school buildings switch distance learning soon tests positive. Decent civil parents call school warn child may exposed. Bay area Florida same. 

SF county leveling 300 cases per day. schools generating 100 200 cases per day year still fiasco could still ""level"".  AFAIK, study showed Moderna effective 2 months 2nd dose vs 1 month 2nd shot. likely localized swelling due injection. Louisiana north? 

Kansas north? 

Regardless totally Alberta sidekick lately suuuuuure ugh

(am canadian)  better comparison may Khmer Rouge Cambodia. Sharing anecdotes doesn‚Äôt make ‚Äúobjectively right.‚Äù 

It whole point ""not everyone refuses take vaccine they're right."" yeah, objectively right. Conservatives major part problem. That‚Äôs indisputable.

Cool, never said otherwise. *only* problem. Work reading comprehension. guy Portland I'll chime here.

Go get fucked Lauren. everyone forced get vaccine? Please discuss. comment made dyslexic Good! Enjoy unemployment. vaccinated people end ventilator anyway. correct! Honestly, I'm surprised admitted *was* surge. We‚Äôre disagreement perspective. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt care country unvaccinated from, do. accept that.

They also said expect shit hit fan sick creeps north school starting week half so. surprised, people don‚Äôt know mask avoid vaccines like plague. 

Also, older lady know says watch savings accounts, government gonna take them. Lmao, true story. See gotta deal here?! That‚Äôs anecdote lol. Sharing anecdotes doesn‚Äôt make ‚Äúobjectively right.‚Äù would like saying Austin rainiest city nation measured rain house past three days. someone points I‚Äôm wrong rain statement, say ‚Äúyo nuanced! get rain South Austin home, too!‚Äù Conservatives *the* major part problem.

*Sigh* Horror show truth time: reason got vaccine quickly adults large countries running trials (the US especially) let disease rip population degree one expected. infections = faster data read outs good confidence intervals.

Sadly, looks like true kids. thought Seattle highest vaccination rate country? Sheer*

There seems link many vaccines generally make immune system stronger specifically targetting coronovirus spike protein, immune system generally higher alert pick certain proteins common viruses.

They theorise might reason kids less susceptible... kids vaccinations relatively recently compared adults.

Unfortunately means kids ""general"" anti vaxxers risk Covid. Time make national ad campaign boost male Covid vaccine uptake. better graphics got COVID last week. Tomorrow 11-day mark per CDC recommendations. Even CDC resources Harvard website, certain important people life refuse see show two negative COVID tests, even shared resources indicated continue test positive months COVID contagious. Anything else share fears founded?

Everyone story vaccinated, major symptoms remaining except lack smell taste. fever days. that's completely foreign northeast. There's bunch people wearing masks stores there's bunch people wear masks basically ignore go business. might help stores around customer service personnel wearing masks still.   ones swayed probably hardcore antivaxxers, lazy/ambivalent ones prioritized getting shots. vehemently opposed people convinced.

Splitting areas counties might better representation individual's general risk exposure unvaccinated people.

Covid 100 years, need test fly another country again. cousin paralyzed flu shot. Guess what? still got vaccinated COVID. understands rare GBS that, especially condition, getting COVID would death sentence him. refused medical science came vaccine. 

Why medical science treat they're ill?

We make choices. make bed.

We can't, shouldn't, save someone want saved. Perhaps making headlines far there's story had. Every vaccine breakthrough infections. new all. believe last check number people died getting vaccine damn near zero, whereas 625,000 Americans alone died covid reported, estimate 50% higher actual numbers deaths reported. ???
I Mormon relatives sometimes go church them. Everyone congregation 200+ wears masks majority vaccinated. conservative part US well. literally idea you‚Äôre talking about. Please stop pulling shit ass. one wants talk it, freedom religion absolutely abused shitty people. Everything agenda days feel like - keeping us safe keeping hospitals overwhelmed. say one tweets cases per 100k people comparing us unvaccinated extremely limited vaccinated countries pretty bad idea - continues perpetuate skepticism vaccine.

You‚Äôre 18 willingly unvaccinated? Lowest priority.

Get vaccinated, put fucking mask public inside places, go to. That's takes flatten curve.  understand word immunosuppressed? *this* brings LDS church hilarious thing ever. I'm hard time wrapping head around idea medical professionals trust medicine. I‚Äôm also teacher, it‚Äôs confusing arms people get snow days. live somewhere doesn‚Äôt snow, everyone fine without extra random days off. get it‚Äôs fun kids go play snow, don‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs big deal. Can‚Äôt play school? ""As Thursday, 73 confirmed pediatric Covid-19 patients hospitalized zone, highest ever seen treated once."" 
North TX 73 beds kids? 73!? also mandate people get vaccinated I'm sure point is. That's exactly CDC FDA prioritizing right now. Idk Mormons essential oils / mlms. felt terrible bride groom. Scary part everyone positive, except 3 fully vaccinated. Pretty wild. sincerely wish best luck  I‚Äôm afraid head collisions, don‚Äôt drive wrong way freeway.  Depends era missionaries. In/before 90s missionaries basically read script made super robotic. Meh. can‚Äôt choose family health history. however choose healthy lifestyle choices.  I've one two surgeries need. Sadly second going delayed. mean, life threatening, still posses off. apex, top, cases start decline again. Yeah sounds right Outside edge cases proven false nearly every study looked it.

Generally healthy activities exercise good diets shown strong correlations lower chance worst outcomes get COVID-19. 

However healthy activities provide benefit terms chance developing infection exposed likely person transmit disease others.

Everyone get vaccinated let's start spreading bullshit name encouraging vaccination. Lol someone's triggered something even exist. give back money rebates make much money. boss says Mississippi armpit United States. used live there. Well, one saw coming. governor really require mask mandate citizens. realize literally killing voting base. Im wedding next month (postponed full year already paid pre covid). worst fear despite knowing 95% attendees vaccinated children attending. vendors let us postpone cancelled would thousands upon thousands dollars. Ugh hadn‚Äôt looked state‚Äôs (Washington) data dashboard since vaccine rollout 8 months ago. things changed. Previously 65-79 80+ age groups lion‚Äôs share deaths cumulatively, seems 50-64 higher percentage (14%) hospitalizations seem much spread among age groups, listed below:

0-19 - 2%
20-34 - 10%
35-49 - 17%
50-64 - 27%
65-79 - 28%
80+ - 16% can't fix stupid, Covid might. anti-vax Reddits, say stories fake. partner works ICU Covid patient mother 4. One special needs. likely leave orphans. day asked late take vaccine. cannot stand people ignoring shit goes every day believe official name logical fallacy ""Shut Up, That's Why"". Indoor. :( buffet. Ugh. know. Thanks waiting virus mutated help us achieve herd immunity. /S show sub time time said worked? üò∂  beliefs similar (religious conviction) Attended all-vaxxed outdoor wedding last week roughly 150 people, uploaded vaccine cards venue. far, 8 breakthrough cases week since, including myself. 

However, symptoms prolonged cold. cases asymptomatic mildly flu-like. one hospitalized severely ill. 

Vaccines work. unvaccinated pulling us pandemic backwards, ones suffer. rest us get sick there, recover. take improved vaccines evolving mutations virus live on. unvaccinated fixing stupid themselves, they're making suck rest us. Yup. I've getting emails calls see want critical care locums covid hot spots recently. Cafe Du Monde makes great beignets, would quickly become comfort food I‚Äôd increase risk factors covid short amount time.  Please get vaccinated wear mask. What‚Äôs deal Eric topol lately? He‚Äôs starting sound like Eric Feigl Ding tone wondering, indoor outdoor event?  high school bizarrely inconsistent COVID rules. students teachers mask halls, perfectly fine take classrooms spent 95% time sitting three feet away other. 

While different grades different bell times keep intermingling halls, staggered bells rang 11:00, everyone intermingling single 9:45 bell fine, reason.

And don‚Äôt forget maskless barbecues staff students alike behind school, long it‚Äôs outside, guidelines required whatsoever! üôÉ

And you‚Äôre wondering vaccine efficacy falling, reason Delta. [It‚Äôs fucking can't that's illegal ACA. offer modest discounts vaccinated wellness program. That's it. ACA simply built pandemic millions want vaccine He's clearly history buff either. He's fucking stupid.  Ya God forbid us want increased protection protect immunosuppressed people around us. much smarter pretend everyone 100% healthy like removed mask mandate. turned fucking great tbh fellow rn, good riddance u absolute stains profession Go ahead fire teachers hate kids cooks wash hands taking dump, too. same.  It‚Äôs explicitly stated, watched FEMA mobilizations military medical personnel closely many friends military physicians, date one military doctor nurse sent state didn‚Äôt first enact mask mandate.

It‚Äôs smart move. getting federal help exceeded capacity care people without NPI‚Äôs military deployment buys week denial, it‚Äôs like sending firefighters arsonist actively throwing Molotov cocktails structure. typically CDC guidelines. quite said vaccinated people need wear masks anywhere.

Annoying changing now. almost exmormon...yeah. wtf happened people knew Idk funny lol'd, thank ;D housemate's profile picture Facebook. know people might ""I'm vaccinated"" profile pic? Well, says ""I immune system- reject experimental jab"".

He also insists Covid 99.99998% survival rate. matter many times show actual figures, reply ""FAKE NEWS"". People dying hospitals? ""Fake news. pneumonia hospitals say Covid get money billionaires funding fake scamdemic"".  reaction insane. 

Y'all prayed fasted miracle donuts US still pace 70% 12+ 1 dose vaccine 8/17. 60% total population 8/18 like island death. Depends application site. Depends.... depends........../ Mormon sister vaccine first. said prayed next day statement came church decided get vaccinated. Problem is, thinks Covid right waiting test results come back.

Absolutely. **The faux outrage made cause reason fall deathly sick even die.** fence getting vaccinated - Please speak doctor first if/when she/he tells go ahead, please schedule appointment get vaccinated. places might even offer walk-in appointment. Please wear mask indoors. Please think consequences family, child/children loved one‚Äôs something bad happens you. Also, keep mind long term Covid health issues.

Or could cut country bugs bunny style let float ocean want keep appearance someone that's holier everyone else nothing substantiate it. confronted sloth hypocrisy.  asymptomatic infections thing anymore? AAP data (sourced CDC) shows marginal increases terms total percent cases among pediatric cases vs. ever before. would extremely easy explain away based increased adult vaccinations, assuming vaccinations effective. 

Where getting data pediatrics affected year ago? would love data could share family friends. Beshear holding live twice-weekly press conferences again. He's giving info, Dr Stack giving info, they're multiple medical personnel giving info, begging people get shot throwing numbers.

You hear despair everyone's voice. They're convincing anyone new; us who've shot wanted it, masking make choice know exactly why. even made snide comment hopes people waiting FDA approval find sooner excuse. Great - thank you. live part government advice early never really mentioned carried on! Getting Covid isn‚Äôt end world you‚Äôre vaccinated btw. It‚Äôs equivalent HIV diagnosis anything like that. test positive otherwise diagnosed, inform close contacts isolate period local jurisdiction asks to. That‚Äôs it. Move life that. fact study based information facebook makes hesitant So, get mutation mutation action, that's could get super deadly variant one sees coming? 


Wouldn't function time though, meaning, get worse variant point virus keeps circulating, anti vaxx morons. 'forcing' hospitals anything? Hospitals turn away anyone vaccinated. tutored lot nursing students. couldn‚Äôt 8th grade math. charity that's trustworthy donate to? Like ""give vax get vax"" kinda thing?  article states towards end data shows boosters needed 2 years Israel showing us Delta, current crop vaccines provides 6 months worth meaningful protection. Worrying. Lambda getting beat Delta months now. nice day. Nope, surfaces tend able get enough viral particles need (in airway).

You'd snorting surfaces. wife stomach carcinoids (slow-growing cancerous tumors). one ""let's keep eye it"" conditions requires scoped exam every 6months make sure status changed.

She due last scan May 2020 Baltimore. Surprise, happen. year later still can't get appointment, hoping finally get scheduled month Delta derailed us again.

At point hope condition worsened obviously extremely low priority compared patients, assuming we'd willing walk around Baltimore hospital right now, we're not. Like said, go see you‚Äôll know you‚Äôre full shit. zero guidance previous administration never chance start race. Dr. Lexus?   great precedent something I've supporting long time. annual fitness test determines much higher premiums be. Yep. already late now. far far far late vaccine approved. letting illegals they‚Äôre bringing won‚Äôt take vaccine might ‚Äúget reaction.‚Äù

Kind sounds like mom, actually wears mask. trusts experts level atleast.  I'm sure hospitals verifying cards, vaccinated Walmart pharmacy, reports vaccination status. local hospital network shows chart online vaccinated, told them. I'm sure every state. ""secret vaccine adverse reactions nurses, doctors, health care public health professionals see.""

They see those. saw secret adverse vaccine reaction otherwise invisible, quit too.

Scary stuff.   It‚Äôs sad takes get people improve odds staying alive. enough me.  referencing Berlin airdrop threads glad see lol  sure getting believe vaccines? reservations fast tracked, FDA emergency approved vaccine limited research done long term effects. fully vaxxed since april got delta covid end july. sucked. hope you‚Äôre feeling okay! percentage new hospitalizations vaccinated people? I‚Äôve seeing reports ICU‚Äôs overflowing I‚Äôm wondering it‚Äôs mostly unvaccinated Glad could take moment get karma shitting Mormonism! Go along let rational people speak instead ostracizing religion stereotypes Goodbye trash. unlikely get pre-delta vaccinated, symptomatic did, nearly impossible infect others. chucklefucks won‚Äôt get vaccinated mutates delta, contagious get infected even vaccinated‚Äîand spread others. benefit it‚Äôs unlikely serious case you‚Äôre vaccinated. 

But continues, we‚Äôre rolling dice till mutation comes along plows right everyone. someone chooses take vaccine make anti vaxxer.   mobile? updated ""Vaccines WORK"" link halfway showing correctly now.  Actually did. drawing based encounter killed cabbie teens saw it.

Cops drove right looking black man. Read wiki even. really bet do, really do. even read comment? screwed big time failing properly manage PPE stockpile protect vulnerable.

Vaccines one area, however, knocked park. Originally, saying we'd able everyone fully vaccinated end 2021, schedule accelerated fall 2021. reality even better: everyone 12 eligible two months now. Vaccines help stop spread Delta--vaccinated individuals still less likely catch COVID--but noticeable effect overall transmission, vaccination rates high given community. talk diseases like measles polio eliminated, that's high vaccination rates were. Especially disease contagious measles, overall transmission would stopped say 40% people gotten vaccinated. 7 brothers sisters still Mormon church. unvaxxed, mention kids grandkids add fast 11 children. 

Glad progressive ward. But, doesn‚Äôt mean isn‚Äôt true.  case, erect wall??? problem exist XYZ. numbers game, group people getting shots hurts us all. majority conservatives. sure else slice one, chief. seems likely time virologists say likely super deadly undefeatable variant emerge, low chances. professional health biology maybe years shall see deadlier version COVID-19 time updated vaccines that. mean airdrop supplies survive Thank you, kind redditor! don‚Äôt get everyone‚Äôs saying this, think it‚Äôs it‚Äôs what‚Äôs popular Reddit make fun of. family Utah plus I‚Äôve seen lot Mormon related social media things visit family often-the mask contempt vaccine contempt NONEXISTENT.

why healthcare field don‚Äôt believe vaccines? That's like here, first. I'm Los Angeles, maybe experience skewed left - completely blindsided vaccination rates slowed crawl. answer that's good question I'd also like know answer to. U.S. 50% population vaccinated, 3 different somewhat effective vaccines, almost perfect environment create super variant.  

**Imagine** get variant combination epsilon, lambda, delta mutations mean would basically render vaccines moot, Ro 15-18, viral load 10x Delta, incubation period 14-18 days. 

**The imaginary virus** would spread ridiculously easy, anything short N95 mask would useless. vaccines effective all. People would infected 2-3 weeks knowing infected, means contact tracing would window, normal precautions would almost useless. people finally get sick, viral load high would hit like freight train, Spanish flu tons reports people feeling fine 10 minutes later dead. 

**With imaginary variant**, time people got sick vast majority exposed population would also infected, day first case surfacing, would massive wave people descending hospitals.  

The big danger hospitals full, means people need hospitalized hospitalized, need hospitalized hospitalized, **WILL DIE. death rate climb 10-20%**.  

The people can't admitted hospital capacity issues stuck home, caregivers high stress, lowers effectiveness immune system, constant exposure virus, means caregivers also get sick, likely also die, room sick, entire families lost.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, hey everyone seems favor opening schools getting ~plague~ economy high gear. Ya, fantastic, let's create super clusters contagious people can't vaccinated send back everyone's houses.

Of course anti-vax sentiment, matter anyhow. matter time super-variant Lambda, immune system evasion mutations pops start anyhow. ooh, heard people dying home NYC! 
From April last last two weeks, city's fire officials said 2,192  
New York City residents died homes, compared 453  
same time period last  shortage -- I'm really trying cruel -- unvaccinated nurses work mobile COVID units, i.e. tents? unvaccinated taking care unvaccinated? nurses may hospital next week: patients, nurses. got brain worms, girl. wife‚Äôs aunt cancer, she‚Äôs ACTIVELY treatment immunocompromised. got vaccine, neither husband two kids (both 12 older) get vaccinated. Studies shown immune response vaccine blunted due chemo it‚Äôs like waiting train wreck happen. It‚Äôs sad cancer also, really take personally won‚Äôt get vaccinated protect her. welcome gave professionals lead running shoes. Virtually every mormon know extremely anti vaccine. say that's different leadership, church followers? don‚Äôt know make nurses country refusing vaccines TYVM! Anti-vaxxers anti-maskers. I've wondered whether people healthy immune system likely bad bout, cytokine reaction top. That's 1918; people dying young healthy people. all. Taiwan South Korea, instead idiotic pretending masks work, ramped mask production early 2020. wonder hell managed create counterfeit versions cards printed common card stock security features whatsoever? best keep everyone updated. yes, I‚Äôm hoping vacs keep up. live small house (1250 sq ft) can‚Äôt really distance one another. I'm cold piece garbage, others risk people's lives so-called civil liberties not? add top that, risking people's lives tools manage pandemic.

Regarding would say loved one option -- loved one opinion felt civil liberties infringed upon private institution requiring wear mask get vaccination, continue put people's lives danger, including kids, would first try educate benefits, walk several examples analogies; would point research; would point billions vaccinated people; would ask kids. still remained ignorant, believed *make-believe* civil liberty wear mask get vaccination would otherwise put others risk, would disown them. Enough enough. chance right thing, continue drain society.

Put COVID aside, person knowingly putting peoples lives risk, like playing Russian roulette people know participating game, people okay that? that's exactly people continue do.

Now -- alternative -- would palatable put unvaccinated nurses mobile tents unvaccinated patients. never agreed lol, it‚Äôs leadership‚Äôs fault members don‚Äôt listen Oh man, would love see ultra right Mormon sect break off. might actually try church again. Yeah, really simple. It‚Äôs accident conservative states hit hard delta. enjoy attempt making obvious nuanced though. Cases going ever state. climbing quickly highly vaccinated states, matter 9f time. vaccine alone enough keep spread delta contained. $500 more. funny Mormon church (slowly surely) changes official stance match modern scientific social concepts.

Not sure leadership genuinely wants change progressive views PR keep new recruits coming/retaining existing members.

It's easy retcon whatever want core religion, write works business?  Lambda apparently around months far able compete Delta. Zip codes would probably accurate.  zip code live 90%+ eligible people vaccinated month now.  Hi, greetings everyone. 
 
Today vaccinated COVID vaccinated Pfizer vaccine. along way time application vaccine (at center application) agglomeration impossible avoid, queue time application, one another person without masks, etc. 
 
So question is: eventually got infected COVID today, day vaccine application, would lose effectiveness? even eventually develop symptoms? 
 
Thanks.   Oh man. It‚Äôs true. good friend fooled around girl mission, clothes stuff, (HUGE no) confessed sins mission president like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre clearly suffering guilt. Let go don‚Äôt again.‚Äù different friend mission president tried order local bishop do, didn‚Äôt like led saw fit congregation. mission president called favor church headquarters bishop released (fired). Sad varies much.  problem existed *because* XYZ, would reason everyone believes it. It‚Äôs there‚Äôs play, there‚Äôs literally reason simplify ignoring people aren‚Äôt getting shot lack ability determine good science. major issue major implications, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre brushing cavalierly. Anyone thinks political issue must internet decade Trump took office they‚Äôd know building crowd pushes vaccines causing autism. Possibly, attending church every week probably makes easier skip tithing payments. supply vaccination records well boosters stuff getting college. get different. Yes, remember US countries vaccines originally available elderly nursing home residents. Unless elderly person immediate reaction vaccinated, unlikely vaccination cause death. Thanks sharing experience. 

Do think might breaking point lot people make leave Church? could imagine argument announcement flawed due individual fallibility leaders, actually would indicate believe devout leadership.

I know someone would turn left disagreement. like suddenly reject principles religion ""turn off"" rest beliefs.

What wild timeline in. guys start school August? TIL. countries issues PPE beginning, nothing unique Canada.  Safer grocery shopping vaccine/negative test required  churches push masks vaccinations? examples members ""in open revolt"" this? Smokers already lot health care plans. Personally, I‚Äôm thinking Montana. Seriously, fucking hate living dead end Louisiana. health people observed statistically significant increase type 1 diabetes(formerly known Juvenile Diabetes young Covid patients‚Ä¶ postulated possible trigger. Exactly. sure. think aim 80%. private health insurance premiums changes time. Americans don‚Äôt Obamacare. I'm guessing Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida? Doubling every 2 weeks signature uncontrolled spread, believe. saw lot last year. misleading also can‚Äôt take current health medical history account. health plans must cover treatment pre-existing conditions day coverage starts.

the two separate concepts.

Pre-existing conditions inherently covered, like law, includes exceptions new categories restrictions added.

This one times *interpretation* ""They also can‚Äôt take current health medical history account""

-is wholly inaccurate.

That's layman's terms ya.

The nuance law allows exceptions smokers, definition explain smokers exception

and would certainly cover this. spend 600 fake vaccine card, can‚Äôt fix uneducated without education  I‚Äôm exmo say Mormon religion culty organized religion. Yeah get brainwashed, half family exmo there‚Äôs zero animosity. It‚Äôs choice. instances parents disown children that‚Äôs rare cultural doctrinal decision. perceived embarrassment it‚Äôs rule. 

Foot note: I‚Äôm dismissing LDS church‚Äôs many cruel things transpired, it‚Äôs def cult organized religion according definitions.  I'd imagine CDC cards okay case, state similar app, probably download it. Y‚Äôall keep saying 7 day average keeps rising   Facts statistics side argument. absolute disgrace Southeast Asia many thousands small farms near jungles, bats, wildlife. farms often contain mix poultry swine close proximity hot, humid climate. amount bush meat consumed even aren‚Äôt ‚Äúwet markets‚Äù. things combination recipe cross species viral mutation.

There surprise many people (mostly left outside conservative zeitgeist) assumed natural evolution rather lab leak. (Not yet proof came lab even considering story.) Wow eye opening me. Wife supposed wedding party wedding next month. brides family anti-vax. I‚Äôm immunocompromised chemo got 3rd Pfizer dose today. oncologist advised play safe go, especially reading this, it‚Äôs worth it. don‚Äôt know immune system would don‚Äôt want make careless risk like that. Thanks insight hope wife feels better soon (and don‚Äôt get symptoms). would love hear back end getting symptoms though! both. intelligent person would knowledge, they'd read it.  I'm one nurses working shift reading aloud private healthcare antivacc group saying get fired get benefits, would hurt stuck hospital they'd eat cost unemployment, apply federal emergency rent funds. wrapped saying writer knew everyone group would okay following hard times demand hard solutions refused ""to thrown pitri dish"". I‚Äôm ex Mormon years talking friends family still Mormon interesting. They‚Äôre baffled church would say this. 

I wanna shake hope they‚Äôll wake either getting vaccine leaving church. they‚Äôll neither ‚Äúmuh freedom‚Äù shit. breakthrough delta pretty bad cough days. dry cough. coughing like every 30 seconds I've several conversations doctor, good friend who's epidemiology research nurse.


*IF* think ever over, vaccine needs prevent vaccinated infectious... great deal less now. Otherwise, everyone going COVID time, we'll need regular boosters prevent getting sick it. vaccine fine think problems manufacturing consistency supply issues led several missed deadlines. help two doses complicates things more. us nurses idiots. I'm immunocompromised booster today. happy able get Delta ramping kids going back school. understand frustration. Fuck lol. pay 10k+ year can‚Äôt figure simple vaccination measure. Kick rocks. Masks feasible college population. might wear class. They‚Äôre gonna wear one go parties bars. Exactly. get house except buy groceries essentials, always wear mask, got first jab second 21st. cannot guarantee everyone make part willing one responsible mutating shit. vaccines proven work. nothing major happened ppl taken them. can‚Äôt bothered get two second jab save lives, shouldn‚Äôt damn field.

case closed.

oh, vaccine fda approved, they‚Äôll make another fucking excuse.

my cousin nurse. decided play follow leader coworkers got covid. lied father getting vaccinated. anything, pandemic people reacted sucked optimistic outlook left made hate people. AstraZeneca vaccinees many countries offered mRNA vaccine second dose, turning even better combination two doses mRNA. brother never get sick. Ever. Like literally 20 years sickness healthy. knocked ass 10 days could barely walk stairs thanks COVID (thankfully recovered fine).

Viruses care. Right? way worried blood clots Covid cause ones vaccine potentially cause. 
Case point, 35 year old healthy friend multiple blood clots, ended lungs. dunno survived. Thankfully, did. horrible recovery, though. 

They never think long Covid, either! That‚Äôs biggest worry, seeing many people know long term effects organ damage. Hey! Something speak directly! Yay (I think)!

Here problem: wins- vaccine/testing mandates, staffing needs? nurses Shenandoah valley (even hospitals) mostly PRN (they got associate's also getting high school degree). highly trained healthcare professionals. ones know usually young, married, job supplemental husband's income. usually work 10 years, become stay-at-home mom. Shenandoah Valley still stuck 1950's.

So question is: better- nurses (because perpetual nursing shortage) unvaccinated nurses? live DC, say nurses. severe nursing shortage, choices. live Luray, say unvaccinated nurses. least someone there, manning phone, taking blood pressure, etc. better alternative.

Those us valley curious plays out. wins? drive vaccinations? need nurses? outcome question still uncertain. Fun times.  nurse working said this? One thing working ER would see people severe adverse reactions vaccines. Another worked vaccination center whatever reason lot people adverse reactions.

Doubt second scenario. 

For first scenario, people mild reactions vaccines would need go ER. severe reactions would need go ER. remember seeing study plexiglass / screen resulted infection impeded air circulation. situation, would wear good mask (KN95 etc.) possible / get portable HEPA air purifier circulate filter air cubicle. system packed people come stroke, heart attack, life-threatening conditions, unable deal it,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúWe unable transfer patients hospital Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Missouri. beds anywhere.‚Äù weren‚Äôt ready, again. frustrating going backwards. read 1918 flu pandemic, realize humans always dumb. show blatant stupidity instantly worldwide. covid covid. Big difference. partner exhibits exact opposite recovering covid. nice actually. first variant came thought ""oh lucky Africa, they're young hit hard""

Then delta came along  There's evolutionary pressure virus mutate make severe among young people anyone else. Variants become dominant spread easily, deadly. seen US right now? Thanks! really bad tbh. like cold go away. constantly runny nose, sneezing time slight headache. Thankfully feeling better now. got tested would've put summer cold cards temporary - need show status phone, microchips scanned. /s

*But seriously: phones via apps next thing. Wow. 70% would HUGE improvement Florida. I'd guess see 5-10% masked  Problem national database   Florida also big surge last winter? accounts MIL moved across country near us baby last year Covid. thought around us would help break away wilder beliefs, sadly didn‚Äôt. last year relationship MIL daughter (my wife) worsened point wife wishes mom never moved here, doesn‚Äôt want relationship mother point.

For it‚Äôs worth, let unvaccinated family member see baby again, regret didn‚Äôt keep MIL away (though didn‚Äôt much choice). I‚Äôve seen relationships several friends parents similarly destroyed Covid. It‚Äôs sad, grandparents don‚Äôt love grandchildren enough get vaccine protect them, don‚Äôt deserve around them. matter time infect baby Covid (not ‚Äúif‚Äù ‚Äúwhen‚Äù). disagree. model real world - despite common misconception male genitalia (like mine, example) either long flaccid short spikey. 

Maybe weird?  aren‚Äôt anti-vaccine protestors ffs. They‚Äôre proud boys looking fight.  Patriots!!!!!!!! happening Sarasota area, granted bit south Tampa, generally lumped together.  Link federal suspected vaccine fraud call 800-447-8477

Depending state, also local reporting methods - states centralize management state level, others county, parish, etc. wondering bad symptoms? hope yall okay True Um...the color coding? really stupid graph. I'm south Tampa, harassed wearing mask last weekend. ... different. would hang together better Florida also big surge last winter.  Thank take. I'll admit negative experiences nurses mostly social media corroborates argument. seem nurses want patted back nurse, seems kind odd me. So, prior covid little faith due would post. 

I see noticeable, significant, amount slip cracks. I'd guess nursing programs bar, passing NCLEX (86% people first time) may say much critical thinking? really know, reason many nurses (not all, even majority, many) anti vax. too. think would gotten otherwise. Spain setup people outside system.

I think lot people get vaccinated it‚Äôs freely available without appointments lots paperwork. think especially refugees migrants without papers won‚Äôt get vaccinated while. Misleading title little bit, guy quoted Astra Zeneca lead scientist. 

 advice would mean X thousand people per day quarantining mild symptoms feel need get positive test. They're walking around supermarket 2 extra weeks, infecting everybody come across. Right, even breakthrough cases doesn‚Äôt always mean hospitalization right? Wouldn‚Äôt hospitalizations much lower high vaccination areas? feel though, wish best Poor mans fight rich mans war.

Those fought didn‚Äôt slaves. Slave owners exempt service. kind implies get longer floppier dick covid. floppiness fades time could selling point. resigned teaching 25 years loving political reasons‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs part wonders school law written explicit often times stated implication teacher act protect child ‚Äúin loco parentis‚Äù. know state always threatens fire teachers get new ones easy task might easy right now‚Ä¶ wonder within realm teachers mass protest shut school system completely name protecting students stupid parents want die? don‚Äôt understand logic American politicians acting like happening except want somehow keep rich happy? necessary many us die so? basically fly season vaccinated ICU season anti vaxxers. Good hear least care dying.  Well, last weekend accosted wearing mask market. that's fun aspect day day life Florida. ""(compared original probabilities)"" means exactly that. No, invention Gatling gun, new types rounds, artillery used way was, trench warfare. foreshadowing WW1 would fought.

Plus lot European observers watched war took back Europe them. read preprint fairly early pandemic. really surprise find found true. I'm content wait based medical advice.

COVID province currently almost non-existent. better vaccination masking rates, we're still seeing rapid rise cases. Last saw (before left) doubling every 2 weeks so. We've running 150%+ capacity year I'm another surge. Sooo... imply Long Covid would make penis bigger, get again? Hmmm... still do. *You acquired new fetish!* End game political. Hoping Trump appointments say whatever republican governor want republican governor gets. somehow make sure democrat can't type thing later.  get natural immunity virus body effectively fights off. dead continually test positive it. Yeah, I‚Äôm willing give benefit doubt laces hit first, didn‚Äôt know hell do. excuse Honestly, least they're consistent. going get vaccinated trust doctors, get help doctors get covid. Nursing school applications skyrocketed COVID. large enough statistically significant results. Especially large effect size. pun intended. keep scanning find real discussion, I‚Äôve seen jokes! Ugh.

Side note: woman here, former partner ED issues despite 30. worked around absolutely best sex life guy. hope resolves soon. mean rich  What‚Äôs wrong believing God?? Let people believe religion want‚Ä¶ Yes, vaccines less testing. Must San Francisco Worked retail hospitality. I‚Äôll never see people absolutely hate them.  Doesn‚Äôt change fact m4a brand pseudo universal healthcare intends lower compensation doctors. Specifically primary care doctors. result reductions supply primary care doctors.

It‚Äôs time investment internal medicine, peds, family medicine dermatology, Derm Medicare rates far higher primary care.

Good luck next pandemic specialists one man hospitals. US Florida least contact tracing app? bottleneck nursing school educational level, student level. thousands nursing students finished prereqs cannot get accepted many nursing instructors many clinical sites. 

Because nursing student huge burden hospitals major stressor nurses, hospitals breaking point last year stopped accepting students. nurses brink quitting stress, make take someone constantly asking questions, needs constant supervision, can't legally anything reflect license supervisor..and anything incredibly slow requires demonstration. 

So plenty people trying get nursing school, schools acceptance rate 30-50 800 1000 applicants, that's many students could reliably place clinicals *before* COVID. can't get license get set number clinical hours prove perform certain safety standard.

So plenty incentives become nurse already, there's way ram people would mean would lose resource healthcare system losing fastest needs most: experienced nurses. district last year (fully person). I'm assuming year masks choice, one lowest vaccination rates state (even staff, admin, teachers), Delta, they'll continue again, staff coverage non-existent due ever increasing sub shortage we'll possibly close building.  sounds reasonable logical. could‚Äôve lot worse too. mean, got plague back basically dead. Covid bad ‚Äúthe big one‚Äù imo  actually medical oxygen shortage: Hey, honestly really sorry suffering long covid. maybe happening you, likely fault.

And true comment section little rude. people, including children, dying group folks believe bunch misinformation vaccines refuse take going 18th straight month disease that's likely continue mutate suffer long covid. maybe that's little bit seeing here. Isn‚Äôt state begging military hospital ship? Insane. agree public healthcare system, expect would help much pandemic. moved US NZ, single payer system. still massively underfunded, horrible waitlists, major nursing shortage, severe lack ICU beds terrible mental health provision. 

Basically much different US except also go bankrupt awful healthcare pay exorbitant monthly insurance fees fear losing healthcare lose job. still big improvement, also overly romanticised liberal Americans. multiple cafeterias work. I've allowed go one throughout covid different buildings stay segregated contact tracing purposes. Meanwhile, people flying world, including places new variants popping up. Next level thinking right here. Eh, nothing wrong going drinks dinner vaccinated (note doesn‚Äôt mean think Desantis good, like emphasize ‚Äúnormal‚Äù activities safe vaccinated people believe encourages vaccinations). 

The main talking point live (Gulf Coast) ‚Äúthe vaccinated causing virus surge shedding spike proteins. Everyone hospital vaccinated.‚Äù course don‚Äôt know spike protein is, pressed, cannot name allegedly vaccinated people dying. It‚Äôs actually really sad local news posts articles community members died, top comments usually like ‚Äúbet vaccinated‚Äù ‚Äúthe vaccinated dying too, aren‚Äôt reporting that?‚Äù 

It bizarre tinfoil hat stuff. don‚Äôt know getting information. Sometimes hear bullshit illegals often vaccine ‚Äúkilling‚Äù people. Username relevant  pay structure wasn‚Äôt adjusted Medicare rates Congresswoman Jayapal made clear feature doctors choice accept bare bones reimbursement Medicare.

Medicare currently structured pays pretty well procedures, great nuanced primary care consultation.

Even Medicare pays far practice needs operate even accounting modest efficiency gains via streamlined billing, recently found Washington state government set reimbursement 160% Medicare rates get enough doctors sign states single payer program.

It‚Äôs doctors greedy, primary care doctors really don‚Äôt make great net hourly wage factored in, Medicare rates alone don‚Äôt pay bills.

I absolutely 100% favor universal healthcare, exploitive monopsony m4a way it‚Äôs currently written. aren‚Äôt. media less problem apparent failure country educate people think critically. people little understanding percentages fractions work. makes difficult explain data them. Also, people seem believe ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù believing conspiracy theories. problem every state manages public health differently, state level, county, others different combinations those. Healthcare explicit federal responsibility Feds centralized vaccine database (VAMS), states use it. Verification depends location. electronic records vast majority (the card personal record), variety different systems problem. Yes, that‚Äôs point. study trying say measures effect, shouldn‚Äôt ignore them. 50,000 people age 12 zip code (suburb Los Angeles). 
 
We're 74% vaccinated. Michaeljacksonpopcorngif Since it‚Äôs good since delta took concrete data hospitalizations vaccinated vs unvaccinated? democratic attack ads full shots refrigerated trucks, children‚Äôs funerals people ventilators. Like shots nightmare true. Muh freedoms? article:

Paul Hunter, professor University East Anglia expert infectious diseases, told committee: ‚ÄúThe concept herd immunity unachievable know infection spread unvaccinated populations latest data suggesting two doses probably 50 per cent protective infection.

‚ÄúWe need move away reporting infections actually reporting number people ill. Otherwise going frightening high numbers don‚Äôt translate disease burden.‚Äù like nurse anesthesiologists

Nurse anesthetists*. Anesthesiologist term reserved physicians went medical school residency training anesthesiology. militant lobbying group AANA officially changed name nurse anesthesiologist obvious attempt blur lines physician advanced nurse.  People think risk Pfizer's early data showing drop 6 percentage points effectiveness every 2 months. 

Up 2 months 96%, 4 months 90%, 4 months 84%, study ends there.

All Delta variant though knows 0 ways.  willing go another hospital, make bank nurse right now. right though salaries might change stay put.  really. people naturally immune HIV (very exist) certainly people naturally immune Covid. 

And mess they'll studies done find they're able it. though medical community busy trying deal ongoing pandemic examine things suspicion, prediction prior freedom day, complete reopening. that, whatever weirdness makes Covid surge. isn‚Äôt entirely understood.  brave. ""Even left Florida

It might bad \*you\* are, nothing moronic family member. places cure indeed arguably worse disease.  Glad see idea getting love.

It's idiots buying dealers paying $60+ Vaxx mask up, bitxhes *Made entire career* 

FTFY people Delta side sure Gee, can't imagine might be. like places Delta rages led people lie, deny, defy experts, turning marginalized scapegoats, remove protections set want quick-and-easy wins without consequences. Can't that.  California 13k daily cases... $50 bucks charity choice provide proof consequences.   complaining abortion, again? rights different right wear mask? Yep. live, there's lot talk kids safe Covid spend time fresh air sunshine, eat balanced diet, get least form regular exercise, take certain vitamins. things, worse cold. also believe diffusing certain essential oils prevents Covid kill viruses. breathing mist containing oils kill virus organisms get airways lungs. misspelled lying. üôÑ think chance losing next election Florida filled morons looking like he's REALLY fucking falling willing suck pride fix issue.

Hopefully next year vote dumbass out.   first sign belongs /r/DontDeadOpenInside want someone understand medicine caring people medical issues, good riddance.

This tragedy 3 acts tragedies do. 

1) deaths almost completely preventable point - vaccine greatly increases chances staying hospital dying

2) Masking distancing dramatically helps. 

3) hospitals, 18 months in, part core being, still way shape form ready pandemic. handful beds ready surge, nearly enough personnel, treat personnel routinely like shit, generally awful places work. see numbers like 33% beds COVID (and that's super super high). ready COVID. people, improvements advances ICUS means # beds ridiculously small, ratio 2 1 possible 4 1 most.

People still come in, often multiple family members, feeling like shit worried covid‚Äîespecially they‚Äôre unvaccinated. amazing quickly unvaccinated lose bravado get sniffles! Obesity prevalent everywhere US, Florida relatively low rate compared rest country. Florida ranks 44th. mentioned couple articles posed today - salon article ends think one. 

A doctor vaccinated got basically said tracked him, reading like ‚Äúoh felt like bad flu couple days better‚Äù people like firemen practice arson spare time. lot people want vaccinated. Additionally, risk variants may cause travel restrictions restrictions large gatherings kept around. 10 years old anxious her. one family vaccinated yet. People May understand smaller
Hospitals don‚Äôt capabilities larger. may blood bank transfuse plasma (a blood product) suck covid patients. may respiratory therapy pulmonary hygiene therapy. may patients normal medications, although family bring home medications, may IV forms meds Intubated patients. 

These hospitals designed stabilize ship. don‚Äôt beds prevent pressure ulcers developing. don‚Äôt enough pumps run sedation, pressors, antibiotics simultaneously. small hospitals don‚Äôt house dialysis. isn‚Äôt criticism hospitals. specific purpose asked far much now. wrong. 


As actual person admitting kids hospital past year, *majority* sick COVID. But, live state test every patient COVID admission weekly that, maybe experience different pediatricians practicing states less testing, idk. 


I've taken care dozens kids COVID, count two hands number times I've needed give Decadron/remdesivir, kids moderate severe COVID. they've done fine. genuinely say flu 2019-2020 MUCH worse COVID been, terms kids got really sick it. 


With said, kids absolutely running walking get vaccines soon can, I'm 100% masks schools. public health thing direct danger kids thing. Zip codes little misleading even Post Office really use 5 digit zip. They've gone use 5+4 digit zip that's printed bottom every envelope (or used be, might even anymore letter sorting still 5+4). 5+4 probably closer UK uses everyone really knows real push adoption. though. Even high vaccination rates, enough unvaccinated people put pressure Healthcare system.

One thing hospitals getting close capacity Seattle area due non covid issues recent increase covid cases. even small uptick unvaccinated covid cases enough go limit. I'm assuming money somewhere, i'm sure start dig that. make sense, surely new mexico something bed? USAmerican, know this.

Just like political system. right thing. Enough enough. Bulgaria among top. vaccines available widespread availability yet 18% vaccinated. argument really make sense.

The quicker burns population, chances another variant emerge.

Especially something replicates quickly delta. hard understand there's 5 factors affect rates? friend used always draw dicks like highschool, always assumed hell curve penis.

Maybe I'll lose weight shitty deal? I'm wondering too. know next nothing works Biden close everything regardless governors doing? uh. real bad. graph implying black dicks bigger? 

 black people getting they're getting vaccinated? quicker burns population quicker people develop natural immunity variant. combined vaccination rates stall ability spread effectively within certain population(s).

Alexa, play ""Learn Swim""  things yes (like cancer treatment plastic surgery) things (think emergency care time essence). example, rich person gets car wreck Denver requires trauma activation going airlifted to, say Calgary. Someone suffering stroke heart attack likely make preferred hospital (insert country name here) wanting go abroad doctor.

And something goes wrong overseas (infection, mistakes, sub-par facilities resulting poorer care, etc.), world hurt. Sure, ultra rich worth 8 digits + far likely (or able establish) connections finest doctors facilities, relatively well quite wealthy could go abroad (think software engineers making 150k + year, lawyer, etc.) may recourse. Good luck finding doctor state side fix botched surgery done someone abroad insurance company would pay expensive corrective procedure(s).

Yes, know accredited hospitals abroad modern facilities staff qualified, even things go wrong. 

**(TLDR) point is** certain emergency situations practical. Medical care abroad actually risks, always facilities staff (some really top knotch), many doctors insurance companies want touch corrective surgeries 10' pole something went wrong, risky, especially people making good money (working professionals high paying careers) filthy stinking rich (like celebrity / CEO large multinational levels rich) would able get things fixed easier without destroying whatever nest egg insurance cover 6-7 figure amount pocket correct it.

Obviously, something doesn‚Äôt seem right, talk doctor.   tricky. Lots people immediately surgery end ICU ICU watch right surgery.

I've heard folks issue trying go olfactory retraining, like getting small vial orange scent sniffing looking actual orange every day. actually arguing opposite, vaccines seem much (or least much people expected hoped) reduce transmission. seem good effect reducing severe symptoms death, course important.

Good getting jab! child got sick covid, would record send daily recording every parent teacher complained masks school. people ridiculous shamed hate stereotype anti vaxers already enough risk factors Ed National leadership prob knows lockdown won‚Äôt work 40% America either riot outright ignore it. magahats take streets protest day one. This. way makes sense. states aren‚Äôt capacity. story somewhere. tried vaccination, work. hospitals overwhelmed. trying anything else? lock downs seemed help last year least  bigger worry vaccinated ""open business"" states surges. 

When NY, NJ, etc big surges shutdown, least car accidents, violent crime, also reduced shutdown. Still, dangerous others hospitals full, normal accident rates + Covid overcapacity + burnouts, there's increased concern injury etc. requires hospitalization.

Batson defines tragedy as: ""A narrative form literature tragic protagonist, possesses greatness spirit, commits undertaking great magnitude within given situation and, result, comes spiritual suffering usually followed perception death possibly 'redemption.' ""

Batson's definition following elements:
a narrative form literature

- protagonist possess greatness spirit [Batson mean protagonist necessarily admirable does, rather hero elevated human potential.]

- protagonist commits undertaking great magnitude

- protagonist comes spiritual suffering {Keep mind ""spiritual"" need ""holy"" here.]

- suffering usually followed perception death

- possibly, suffering results redemption

Thank indulging Sunday morning literature class. get A‚Äôs, extra credit vaccines. true last year actually national lock down? remember state level decisions back general I'm idea people forced pay full price already paying insurance. idea keeps cropping diabetes, obesity, smoking, alcoholism etc view kicking weak down.

If someone delusional enough vaccinated yet think even would still motivate them. would end lot kids made homeless parents went bankrupt surviving covid.

I would prefer treat publicly state policy vaccinated people ill covid get treated first get taken life support left die unvaccinated vaccinated person saved oxygen supply using.

Health systems US world hitting capacity needing go triage mode, people chose get vaccinated left die others stupidity. God supposed protect them, hospital? Go church take them.  may happen serious. reassured now.

Thank you! seeing covid still fuck i'd say that's load crap  
this entire scheme overrated hey say Thanks gay little comment, there's going San Fransisco.

(Episode farts, I'm assuming people get reference). deflecting back me? one simplistic Western world view, reason planet exists least developed countries.

Outside Africa, probably find handful countries single-digit vaccination rates (talking first shots), probably exceptional cases failed states.

Even Africa, half countries begun vaccinating earnest, even 15, 20, percent first shots. Yes supply problem, vaccine all. forget unique demographics. many African countries, achieving vaccination rates high single digits would mean oldest vulnerable protected. No, don‚Äôt buy media hype. 96-99+% serious cases currently among unvaccinated. surge unvaccinated, booster vaccinated won‚Äôt help. vaccine clear remaining virus assume

Really? use treat people sick covid ""clear out"" virus? think that's right I'm doc 9% men consult physicians. Yup, keep seeing local people saying need stop talking vaccine work eating healthy exercising vaccine needed lol, idea talking about. 75% rebates also illegal 75% rate increases would never approved. employers wellness plans give incentives total 30%. again? national leadership?

Thank dumb question here, covid (variant) go every greek alphabet? waiting 24 finally ends? like gonna 24 variants?

 get use greek alphabet ignorant. He's stupid either. chose play psychopath. people unvaccinated impoverished people education access

Citation adults (18-29 years old), Republicans, rural residents, uninsured still report lower rates vaccine uptake demographic groups. larger share Hispanic adults (16%) Black adults (11%) White adults (8%) say want ‚Äúwait see‚Äù getting vaccinated, least one fifth uninsured adults, White Evangelical Christians, rural residents, 18-29 year-olds say ‚Äúdefinitely not‚Äù get doubt income plays role, disingenuous say ""most"" impoverished undereducated. Seriously? We‚Äôre allowing blogs now? write opinion blog, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs science. clearly care facts ignore important factors prevent severe disease hospitalizations.

But stat (more 9 10) COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, deaths occurred among people unvaccinated yet fully vaccinated, states reporting breakthrough whole story *choosing* remain unvaccinated **unnecessarily selfishly** straining healthcare system. people making *unsafe* vaccine genuinely medically contraindicated for. think whole story reported conservative networks? Mine total population Denver much closer. According ER doctor neighbor plenty capacity hospital alone including ECMO beds. H√Ä N·ªòI ‚Äî Vi·ªát Nam recorded 9,580 new COVID-19 infections Sunday, reduction 136 cases compared previous day. 
 
It also announced 336 people died coronavirus complications. 
 
The total number infections stands 275,044, amount fatalities, 5,774. 
 
Of latest transmissions, six imported, rest discovered either community already locked areas quarantine zones. 
 
HCM City - Vi·ªát Nam's current largest COVID-19 hotspot - recorded 4,516 cases, followed neighbouring provinces B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng (2,358), ƒê·ªìng Nai (546), Long (514), ƒê·ªìng Th√°p (271).  
 
The capital city H√† N·ªôi reported 39 new infections. 
 
The Ministry Health said 5,519 people given all-clear, bringing total number fully recovered patients 102,504. 
 
Among patients treated, 589 cared ICU, 18 using machines help breathe. 
 
Vi·ªát Nam far administered 14,434,017 doses COVID-19 vaccines. total 1,355,677 people received shots. ‚Äî VNS used surprised anymore. Sadly, South Eastern Oregon mostly rural farming communities populated kind conservatives Southern States. travel cities infect others racist things. know first hand attacked anti-Asian racist white people three times March 2020 due ignorant politician making remarks China-Flu.

If going avoid masks vaccine, hope loads prayer chains ready go virus inevitably - seek unprotected, vulnerable, ""easy"" targets. Haha it‚Äôs like guys wait give anti vaxxers chance. point! It‚Äôs almost like caving talking points. Remember universally antivaxxers looked upon Covid? God damn larger minority population lead believe misinformation doesn‚Äôt mean things stay normal. shit fucked it‚Äôs 35% populations fault. 2% can‚Äôt medically take vaccine reason. Bucks 63 percent 12+ aug 2, can't imagine jumped 67 percent population today. Post link though. WTF!!! isn‚Äôt problem. Supply isn‚Äôt issue US countries boosters discussion. Further, I‚Äôm totally favor boosters medical community concluded protect vulnerable. 

My point boosters aren‚Äôt critical weapon Delta current surges. currently pandemic unvaccinated. may spilling victimize vaccinated, extra-immunizing isn‚Äôt key.  mind smelling done anything, bigger fish fry. Well hope improves eventually!  going cause lot ""brain drain"" southern states, they'll force talent sorely need. can't argue lack access based seeing billboards posted. 

I think people unvaccinated political view it. look MSM appears way sensationalize things.

Here's chart income/vaccination status Treatment shouldn‚Äôt denied reason. That‚Äôs point. hospital shouldn‚Äôt say you‚Äôre obese don‚Äôt get treated people aren‚Äôt obese treated first. hospital shouldn‚Äôt say going charge insurance make pay 100% cost obese. 

If insurance companies want offer discount vaccinated way non smokers fine. Denying care refusing bill insurance wrong. world. US.  Yeah, I'm taking chances whatever protect newborn. pandemic amazing argument universal health care. forget people wear parkas ~~50~~ **70** degree weather flock inside ""winter"".

FTFY. swear 85¬∞-95¬∞ 60-90% humidity, folks put jackets. Buddy, talk doctor. personally significant history blood clots, addition issues. Getting vaccine no-brained me, possible risk vaccine SIGNIFICANTLY less risks faced getting Covid. Moderna experimenting using 50mcg third dose, vs 100mcg first two. Pfizer using 30mcg three. TIL America whole world. comes several times daily! We've REAL serious getting covid. Ignorant voters. point, look many laws smoking. Can't smoke indoors nearly anywhere. can't even smoke outdoors places. say good. Covid already killed 650k, 2 years. can't even get damn mask mandates. many ""second hand covid deaths"" people refusing get vaccinated wear mask? great point penalty refuse get vaccinated wear mask, put lives/livelihood others jeopardy. That's different hurting due poor health risky behavior. work hospital 50% employees vaccinated despite aggressive pro vaccine campaign hospital. literally walk downstairs get vaccination time, choose believe Facebook conspiracy theories instead evidence around them. loonies minor group people. transplant brain dead state....New Orleans Louisiana. highest rate per capita. chronic medical condition need 2 procedures specialist said closed due covid. anybody hear attack car accident etc sol. non vaxxers non mask wearer's crushing hospital system bringing usa yet call patriots. I've using stats full population vs 12+ 18+, comparing 12+ 18+ total population stats. Good. way start. Sorry cancer covered insurance seem ""pre existing condition"" pay $200,000 month live sick. true. would achievable Delta. Yeah, comment hit nail head people downvote idea they‚Äôre talking about. irritates people complain anti-VAX much really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. Anyways, hope good rest day Relevant context: recently reported COVID death Iceland May. here, rock!  interested ‚Äúowning‚Äù anyone, isn‚Äôt that. It‚Äôs prioritizing critical care people right thing society whole people not. Sorry hospitalizations willfully unvaccinated adults well sympathy gets tad bit dry.  Yes. arguing logistics growth, arguing exponential growth without knowledge R0 value incubation period discovered much later comment. even know baseline value number people infected March 1st, gross underestimate calculations.

I put together example exponential growth was, interpreted completely wrong thought making prediction. wasn't. trying tell everyone else exponential growth, logistical growth, people panicking far necessary time.

The assumption made entirely wrong former President would something stop it, never happened. fact quite opposite happened instead. please, carry on. agree, also means smart people pushed away/out Tennessee (and similar places), unfortunately.  Auf wiedersehen!  FL. know cards look like, I'm wondering different cards. stickers shot. would relevant. coronaviruses including Covid-19 recombine, it‚Äôs viruses vaccinated improve chances needing medical intervention. hope starts getting better soon. Seems like typically takes 7-10 days run course ‚Äòmild‚Äô cases ( mild sense symptoms don‚Äôt need active intervention). Hopefully he‚Äôs backend this. Hope gets better. normal vaccines issue though.

If going vaccinate entire population time people stop getting sick dying things vaccinate them.

At start vaccination push people went hospital blood clots shortly getting vaccinated (a couple days) monitored data came number people getting blood clots vaccination number people would expect going hospital blood clots.

There issue, media &amp; internet panic like people buying toilet paper good reason. Yes‚Ä¶   said nothing faith. made yourself.

Sometimes, ***people majority right***. Like, virologists, epidemiologists, infectious disease doctors. one times. There's scientific consensus talking about. 

It's dismiss you. walk walk talking about, Nature handle you. america, think much option, insurance provider see much bilk for, pretty sure 'donations' certain neo liberal senators congressmen able fully bill unvaccinated. 

now question is, morally wrong bill unvaccinated hospital bill global pandemic much cheaper alternative (free) solution available, answer complicated. 

In sense heinous act selfishness decline vaccine majority global south wholly unprepared would gladly take american vaccines. also good argument 'freedom' b/c likely payer medical bill unvaccinated person it'll US tax payer (i.e. rest us) goes collection like bills never get paid. Speaks volumes country shifted blame success solely individuals people actually bought myth. country invests much tech begging opportunities like study use it. Agreed. However, smokers, obese, even rock climbers pay higher health insurance premiums non-vaccinated should, too. goodest. extent, question immunity defined. 

If define ‚Äúthe virus longer spread among humans‚Äù, course impossible. might possible contained early 2020, reasonable path anymore. 

If define ‚Äúthe population enough immunity virus spreads, much reduced severities, comparable either flu common cold‚Äù, that‚Äôs certainly possible - either vaccination infections. 

But yes, even kept every human locked 90 days vaccinated everyone (both impossible), many animal reservoirs: bats cats seagulls ferrets minks‚Ä¶ 

Humans successfully eradicated one virus using vaccines - smallpox. spent billions decades fighting polio, it‚Äôs much contained used be, would easily become big issue soon stop vaccination program. COVID plenty characteristics make far less likely eradicated. Obesity unique problem every single completely unrelated health issue automatically blamed obesity, treatment denied delayed result.

An actual conversation (at time, obese): Hey doc, think broke ankle.  (now former, fired them): fat.  *know* trying run help lose weight *at suggestion* tripped ankle hurt much walk ever since.  Doc Well, lose weight I'm sure it'll get better. 

Obviously, kind advice totally useless, found another doctor, got better advice, lost 100 lbs. attempt run diet, exercise, controls weight. Running probably least efficient way lose weight. days strict calorie control couple daily walks really need. 67% initiated chester, 67% initiated Bucks, 67% Montco. Thats total population. Pretty good stats. sure fear-mongering strugglin' statistics. sure. argument could easily logically applied obese people, people something people consider outside social norms etc. kind situations insurance companies think ***constant basis*** order deny coverage.

Takei's statements example wrong today's public discourse: they're knee-jerk, emotionally charged reactions little actual thought stirred entire crowd people repeat over. Sorry, allow anecdotal posts including posts results polls. welcome post link comment Daily Discussion thread, stickied sub's front page.

They reject medical science beg it. always free patient, understanding insured, insurance pay it. Otherwise, government pays it.

So matter you, matters doctor pharmacist gives shot. Antivaxxers deprioritzed beds, covid beds. non-covid patient turned away hospital there‚Äôs antivaxxer bed.  It‚Äôs ridiculous anti vaxx people even exist. Like bruh get fucking vaccinated resume back called ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. mention, lot people‚Äôs personal hygiene hand washing definitely gotten better great sense preventing certain illness spreading germs. get vaccinated stop nonsense.

Yea exactly, mention would hard insurance companies accurately determine isn‚Äôt vaccinated bc don‚Äôt want isn‚Äôt vaccinated bc legitimately can‚Äôt bc medical conditions don‚Äôt want set precedent disabled people jum√≥ even hoops already get basic medical care. Ah yes, ""get vaccinated die"" really coax unvaccinated get vaccine definitely wont stoke conspiracy theories. sure, continue froathing mouth blood, freaks Bro that's saying, basically someone saying ""jesus christ!"" get scared, typing ""jfc"", even ""god damnit"". common phrase that's become bit mainstay language, necessarily indicate belief christianity. data catching covid second time you‚Äôve caught fully vaccinated (Pfizer) That's fringe position completely step overwhelming scientific consensus. one piece evidence support statement, [here's 2015 which, noting 100 genetic loci alleles impact BMI already discovered, found several them.

In words, obese 100% prove someone lazy slob. unvaccinated does, definition, 100% prove trust evidence, therefore, opinion, deprioritized evidence-based treatments. Are, they? Sorry, I'm going another family member told Dr. Told them. actually said CCU, maybe meant coronary care??? medical professional, appreciate share knowledge me, frustrated unvaccinated, maskless, still worried her. drive rural part state yesterday billboards urging people get vaccinated and/or advertising vaccine clinics events every miles, I‚Äôd argue lack access big problem you‚Äôre claiming.

The sheer volume misinformation coupled people easily swayed larger problem. vaccine surveillance report efficacy delta symptomatic disease 79%.


Using numbers r0 delta 7, need vaccination coverage 113% herd immunity

(1-(1/7))/0.79 I‚Äôm reading we‚Äôre fucked they‚Äôre gonna anyway everything political everybody sucks. don‚Äôt care you‚Äôre anti-VAX not. people trash opinion attitude Reposting late last night case studies advice get.

I got COVID last week. Tomorrow 11-day mark per CDC recommendations. Even CDC resources Harvard website, certain important people life refuse see show two negative COVID tests, even shared resources indicated continue test positive months COVID contagious. Anything else share fears founded?

Everyone story vaccinated, major symptoms remaining except lack smell taste. fever days. someone 70% less likely drive drunk spread drunk driving, that's car I'm getting into

I think I'd walk. Creating system like would leave open future impose others ""civic duty"". Leaving definition whatever politician office. packed right think mean complete breakdown system triage Thanks killing mood facts honestly answer this. read one response think ""yep, right."". read next one, opposite view, seems right also. 

I honestly think hard decide matter without knowing people getting vaccine. Right now, everyone opinion why, really know.

Damn, antibodies kid would get getting vax would amazing.... that's bummer. Yeah. hard I‚Äôve always loved emergency medicine. I‚Äôm completely burned time. CDC deserves huge amount blame here. legal precedent ‚Äúlock down‚Äù US national level public health emergency.

Obesity genetic component makes harder people control others.

That much unlikely vaccines. genetic component anti-vaxxer. people making bad choices. Sorry hear. denied end? overwhelmed State Leadership angry Karens.  Yes effective legal mechanism transfer property state federal government

I forgot US runs inefficient system generous less effective vaccine now

After looking data, China's Sinovac proven quite effective saving lives, cases certain areas dropped 0 couple days ago. also safest vaccine choices using proven vaccine technologies used decades. also safe administer children early age 2 without heart inflammation blood clotting seek access resources third world countries future

How? gonna invade lands take away resources? Nope, dumbest move lose everything it. China treats neighbouring countries well foreign investments especially Belt-and-Road initiative(how many High-Speed Rails there?). good diplomatic relations China sides benefit it.

I recommend stop reading Anti-China western biased contents seemed idea what's going Asia whole. doesn‚Äôt work 100% it‚Äôs even worth doing. fatality rate 1%, it‚Äôs worth caring about. ag investigate massive planned manslaughter occurring pandemic? horrendous. read sarcasm genuinely touched, thank warming shriveled little heart brightening day. 

Also sarcasm. cover greek alphabet, means pandemic last forever (several years)  I‚Äôve handful people try deny virus exists vaccine problem. I‚Äôm point literally laugh them. go ‚ÄúIf don‚Äôt believe science, ya come emergency department?‚Äù  Im toasted point that‚Äôs needed walk away. [That's faces behind startling statistic pandemic‚Äôs toll: Although COVID-19 continues kill predominantly white, older Floridians, **when becomes lethal age 60 it‚Äôs disproportionately killing minorities**, Palm Beach Post analysis state medical examiner records two-thirds 60 older dying COVID throughout Florida white, reverse true younger: two-thirds Black Beach County, pattern even pronounced ‚Äî 70 78 deaths 60 people color. Among 42 14 people younger 40 died Palm Beach County. Nine Latino. Usually flu vaccines mandated job requirement. Covid shots can‚Äôt yet (although needs happen don‚Äôt want go premiums route) Insurance companies always pay least amount to, law contract. laws contracts also permit raise rates whenever whatever want, too, well. 

Sure, continue cover unvaccinated (and drinkers smokers obese, etc), persons pay high premiums choices. Sure, unvaccinated city older people lower income minorities. don‚Äôt trust doctors government, means get vaccination site.  Almost non medical insurance, aren‚Äôt able pay care get sick. don‚Äôt anything give. really don‚Äôt know going accomplish. It‚Äôs vaccinated flooding hospitals ICUs, genius‚Ä¶ truly understand leaders best kill people live state. Abbot, DeSantis incident Tennessee. counterintuitive. Yet, next election, people vote them. Mind boggling. walked away job. worked covid unit. staff beyond breaking point. Moral abysmal. angry depressed. 

Yes, care. many us equipped handle mentally physically ruining us. bought tickets outdoor concert October 

We need fly September family party 

Need kids vaccinated worry less yes ,it's gotten worse.... Yup independent living residents come go campus please gather others apartments socialization everyone sees families openly. staff tested weekly (vaxxed) twice weekly (unvaxxed)

We one staff positive transfer nursing resident, one independent resident introduced assisted living resident visited.

Our staff vax rate around 70% sadly. There‚Äôs talk mandating staffing hard enough right now. Nobody‚Äôs looking jobs people quit we‚Äôd understaffed. Oh, that's true either way. No, that's viruses work unlikely. America's healthcare system brutal nightmare long covid arrived,

For some, sure. U.S. top level health care comparable country. 11% nation uninsured time. can't go regular health care, emergency get treated. present ER U.S. must treat healthy enough safely discharge. bill hand end ridiculous uninsured.   Yep. Still unethical punish disproportionately impoverished people it. first shot, period came 5 days early. that, everything normal second shot seem effect all. One explanation current RSV outbreak. Like many respiratory infections held check last year masks, distancing, etc. Coming back vengeance. 100x deadlier young children COVID. lot kids diseases. residents get covid start though? care home. brought staff. vaccination rate staff facility. Also 6 months vaccines effectiveness really starts wane. Hopefully boosters offered soon seniors. There's skipping. 

If variant *interest* gets letter. someone medically ineligible... 100% choice. imagine stress trying prove US insurance company get vaccinated, go bankrupt hospital stay? fight every turn avoid eating profits. worst part, horrible precedents set follow. CDC rescinded mask mandate vaccinated back May US basically allowed go back normal July even missing vaccination goal 70%. mean, amateur, hobby youth players probably covered insurance, though. 

Pretty sure playing casual game friends fucked knee, insurance would pay fix it. actual number fall category quite small. people claim need exception fear utilize misinformation personal non-medical opinion support it. Iceland's small population depends tourism running planes passengers help pay air cargo. closed borders delta appeared world, maybe they'd alright right now. 

Overall, another political media article. Media outlets poor job spreading facts. Everything thinly veiled pressuring unvaccinated people angle ""epidemic unvaccinated"" quote. lost herd immunity battle, people. Masking people doing! Why? Fact is, mRNA vaccine targeted alpha's spike proteins. Delta different invades body matter vaccination status. Wear mask prevent getting infected, newer vaccine comes handles changed spike proteins. Also, meantime, know vaccine may prevent hospitalized since antibodies help infected, turn, help hospital bed counts. People asymptomatic masking real killers there. Social distance everyone put mask on. don‚Äôt think second, could transform into‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúThey (people smoke cigarettes), weren‚Äôt smart enough help stop smoking, help lung cancer‚Äù almost 0 obesity occupied Europe early 1940s 10 years ago man Texas got 45 years jail knowingly spreading HIV.

HIV/AIDS past 40 years killed 700,000 people US. COVID killed 600,000 single year.  Iceland nice statistics web Well Americans, no. Yes, believe possible people 40-45% range getting vaccinated due reasons politics. pandemic, wealth inequality roof anyway, good chunk country lost jobs. source/study/research shows vaccine affect transmissibility virus?  
I know there's still risk transmission want know (having numbers). Obviously I'm excluding people medically ineligible vaccinated. Stop obtuse.

Anti-vaxxers get vaccine preventable disease people unique definitionally meet two criteria: problem 100% due bad choices, they, definition, believe medical science.

So yeah, I'm pretty deprioritizing people evidence-based care. unlimited medical resources.  Globally? way end 2023. US? Maybe mid 2022 people get stuff together. prevalent ‚ÄúLive Free ~~and~~ Die‚Äù attitude, think it‚Äôs mitigated least, one least, religious states country. last time anti-mask rally couple people showed up. 

We‚Äôre 60% fully vaccinated last saw. Easily top 10 vaccinated states pretty close New England states. Masking 30-40% based I‚Äôm seeing stores. sure relation others. room improvement, certainly better shape majority states. sir absolutely correct that. think conquer it, certainly cannot.

We anywhere go management, mitigation, learning. Thinking know eradicate it, already see end, heady arrogance pure simple.  suspect happened long pandemic - least US mainstream. Information another product consume everyone favorite brands.  This! It‚Äôs hard there‚Äôs many different conditions cause vaccine intolerance lot hard diagnose can‚Äôt necessarily go official diagnosis, even could, people aren‚Äôt carrying medical records around. Doctors usually ones giving patients advice based known reaction vaccines require doctors note excludes people without good access healthcare can‚Äôt afford primary care appointment slip paper even it‚Äôs like people would remember carry slip paper around everywhere went case ended ER. autoimmune disease vaccine knocked ass 3 months, caused pretty bad flare up, knew would probably happen going doctor still thought worth it, another person different doctor different life circumstances disease might come different conclusion it‚Äôs complicated. medical system already makes hard chronically ill people access emergency services could see making even harder :( worked covid unit personally witnessed vaccine regret asking get currently admitted covid. 

It's one many reasons walked out. can't mentally handle anymore. Username checks literally think saying dumb shit city council meeting crime get convicted purjury. Truth clearly left building you.  Unless anaphylaxis vaccines absolutely excuse get it. live virus. everyone know 1 person anaphylaxis hes med student relying everyone part graduate save lives. city live, huge number unvaccinated older people black brown. Many distrust doctors government. Many don‚Äôt means get vaccination site.  

You guys seem want paint picture Trump supporting Republicans getting vaccine, that‚Äôs data showing city. Denying medical care unvaccinated disproportionately affect POC. Deductibles rates talking here, though. post saying unvaccinated pay entire hospital bills, entirely different issue.

Also, determining fault car accidents persnickety animal. 

For example, pretty gnarly car accident freeway. sudden backup around curve. able make safe complete stop, dipshit behind locked brakes, swerved control hit hard enough push bumper trunk, trunk backseat, car car front car car front it. 

Under typical liability/fault rules, would considered fault hitting guy front me, except talking cops accident, guy front explicitly said come complete stop. told cop information, uncertain terms, looked rear view mirror right time, would determined partially fault/liable damages could ticketed. 

I would honestly hate experiencing level hair splitting health insurance got cancer accidentally injured tripping random thing like dumbass, I've done. I'll try get confirmation screenshots friend access GISAID. Mine still approved, hope I'll get shots soon. already texted him.  Eh, lot states make ""affordable"" part ways- Texas, example, fairly high property taxes. lose better public education, lot ammendities used go away southern states.

You get storm New England, example, response fairly quick states plan budget them. states respond much quicker federal government red tape anticipated get federal help.That, we've seen past years, case south.

I've numerous family attempt move south returned north. holdouts Florida exceptions one actively trying afford move back Jersey still. Yes   Curious vaccinated? love am, new policy unvaccinated even allowed hospitals. alcoholics, drug users obese pay higher medical fees? yes, yes don‚Äôt understand anti-vax nurses‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt go school get degree studied medical science?? reason feel comfortable politics beliefs utter rejection political idea actually gets voted top invokes discussion. Suuuuure, auto-immune disorder excludes getting vaccinated ""choice,"" ""personal belief,"" something ""control,"" legitimate medical advice professional. People like *definitely* forced sign waivers discriminated against, pesky ""beliefs"" put everyone ELSE risk! *DARE* selfish; dangerous actions mean offered hospital bed emergency! /s

Shame you. Yeah, anti-vaxxers eschew assholes, *plenty* people would fucking *love* get vaccinated, medical situations make thing impossible. 

But hey, least feel good yourselves, completely forgetting ignoring like society regularly anyways. health going well, easy say, ""Well, everyone THIS!"" (I.e. well, fat, exercise!) body attacked immune system, sure, let's shame top wholly ignorant medical conditions. show 'em. Obviously I'm excluding people medically ineligible vaccinated. vaccines unique sense 1) are, unambiguously, 100% choice, unlike obesity, addiction, comparable conditions, 2) also 100% prove unvaxxed person believe medical science.

So I'm pretty ok deprioritizing anti-vaxxers, honestly. think slippery slope, see issue meets criteria. think make parents pull kids school. a) dumb future generation limiting education b) push others enrol kids private schools. guarantee peivate school owners governora connected means cash kickbacks governors.  100 employees unknown profession healthcare system 24,947 employees large number

Yes, early vaccine release many people wanted wait proved effective get first offered.

What looking media sensationalization political issues. 

And change data axios article get people take vaccine, yes. I'm also pretty sure would kicked desperately needed beds would available.  Covid seems making lot workers say ""enough""  disagree many reasons, main one person suffers negative side effects Covid-19 vaccines required foot hospital bills. You‚Äôre seeing people come myocarditis vaccine applauded free they‚Äôre tens thousands dollars debt emergency room trips appointments specialists. can‚Äôt make somebody vaccinate using force potential economic threat tell they‚Äôre come really expensive side effects. think given people legitimately can't get vaccine get pass. Delta happened. :( Get fucked Abbott. happened? well. peak everybody gets infected, peak people change behavior reduce infections.

I bet good number people already changed (I have), news, many will. put things perspective:

Since pandemic began, total 141 kids aged 0-4 died Covid US. 93 aged 5-11 died. study done last Summer, every person age 18 died Covid serious co-morbidity. I'm pro-vaccine come, vaccine completely without adverse events. risk calculus small children completely different adults would wait FDA seen enough data comfortable approving &lt;12 year olds. yard signs people read ‚Äúthe wrestler mayor idiot‚Äù. Great times. It‚Äôs fine want principle police legitimate solution problem non-COVID patients turned away significant number COVID patients made deliberate decision get vaccinated? one intentionally seeking COVID patients couldn‚Äôt afford time get shot know several million refuse. Therefore, like others said, triage standpoint, makes sense separate normal patients COVID patients. Wow sorry hear that, hopefully feels better soon (and don‚Äôt get symptoms hopefully). doubt 96-99% really accurate considering CDC uses YTD numbers going back January 1st. would say almost severe cases January April among unvaccinated people since almost everyone unvaccinated. numbers skew statistics don‚Äôt paint accurate picture what‚Äôs going now, truly lot vaccinated people getting really sick. Yes! truly deeply frustrating me. Actually ‚ÄúFrustrating‚Äù isn‚Äôt even universe feeling. Masks work! Let‚Äôs wear them! Let‚Äôs get sick get keep going work school living! 

I thought lived pretty good area Michigan, children‚Äôs school decided ‚Äúrecommend‚Äù masks. Thanks reminder. 
Hospitals US failing üßê (entire states) Yeah, deltas R0 score 7, it‚Äôs going require 85-90% least. Yeah obviously regulated point can't make medical decisions. obviously going happen time affect conversation we're now, ever happens all. Refusing stuff people justifiable. Actions consequences.  state emergency effective immediately include public health order.

""We hole boat we've ordered buckets."" hoping would change (dot) org link. turns sub forbids petitions.

Pity getting covid antivaxxers sent covid exists all? huge majority people country believe covid real. point exhaust Greek alphabet, they‚Äôll start naming Atlantic basin hurricanes.  unironically... seriously, moral objection this. problem would impractical implement force people reveal exactly ate. short answer?
yes. No, much despise them, still want reasonable access healthcare. Yes! last ones get beds crowed hospitals, unlike others ill choice. CRINGE PLEASE LEAVE  Depends effective vaccine long protection lasts. pretty concerning studies Israel Minnesota showing Pfizer drops &lt;50% preventing cases ~6 months. good news still extremely effective serious outcome. 

I think waning immunity + incredible contagiousness delta means we'll never get rid it, end game vaccinate many possible prevent large majority hospitalizations death. Unvaccinated receive medical care imo. selfish choice puts everyone else danger, difference big enough warrant care. Offering care exposes everyone else hospital covid, cases vulnerable patients there.

You also risk variants evolving spreads amongst unvaccinated.  Nothing guaranteed go surge patterns occurred last year seem holding true far. Also, countries fraction size US comparison isn‚Äôt really relevant. 

Personally, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs likely areas US going surge like southern states point. fix problem regulating them. excuse anti-vaxxers ways. Republicans lower income folks seems risk it, one, also like give hard earned money science deniers I'd cancel reason, too. likelihood he'll overcome? Yes! 2 members staff ended 

Out many? idea whether hospital terrifyingly unlucky what, that's representative anything..

I vaccinated large flu vaccination center: ~ couple hundred people went within hour. Noone went shock. vaccinated even larger Covid vaccination center served probably Noone went shock. Anaphylactic shock would quick impossible hide.. So, know happened staff anaphylactic shock common reaction either flu covid vaccines...

Here data American Academy Pediatrics: estimate &lt;2 per 1M vaccinations (i think statistics includes adults too)  Perhaps better approach would fine pay refuse vaccine. already asinilar situation tax returns uninsured. perhaps tax consequences refuse vaccine without medical expemption. Tell sorority houses Still threatening family. news reports need report backdated deaths week two like ""xx,xxx new deaths previously omitted reporting finally added correct previously incorrect florida death numbers. reporting method caused undercount use today's death tally xx,xxx likely need correction well"" liability protections

Uh oh. Let triaging begin! YES. overhauling Medicare introducing M4A üòÉ. Jesus. Charlie V. Goldberg variant would probably actually give people Autism make need glasses added bonus. one required pay hospital bill. insurance companies shift people next?

The whole concept insurance precisely costs ""shifted"" onto people. contract people sign says: one us gets sick, chip in. insurance company middleman takes cut exchange facilitating transaction. Insurance companies able form separate ""cohorts"" people set different insurance rates each. idea makes uncomfortable, perhaps one start regulations prohibit companies setting different rates basis protected categories like race congenital conditions.

But absolutely, think completely fair charge higher rates people make unhealthy life choices. (Just unsafe drivers face higher car insurance rates.) present case, make unvaccinated pay cover medical bills cohort (so vaccinated people see premiums increase fault own). got third Moderna. Rite Aid nearby offering. side effects bad second dose last vax Jan Think bad antivaxers made discourse country years, vaccination. imagine [further cognitive effects linger us years, long wards empty.  Yep. Every single thread people like ""unvaccinated people pay extra!"" something like that, people saying ""okay, fat people, smokers, drinkers, etc."" that's healthcare work developed country, helping people, retribution.  difference though putting others danger choosing get vaccinated. think abortion killing children. think birth control killing children. still slope here. actually necessity Private health insurance. private company can't take debt unlike public health insurance. Good point there, factor including children.

I would think threshold upper 80% transmission rate tapers considerably. Whether 50% 75% there's still enough people getting infected keep circulating...but point, rate vaccination must slow virus down, right?  check ty ‚ÄúHey Lois! I‚Äôm danger society!

OTOH, knowingly choosing ignore science good self society choosing take vaccine whole different level irresponsibility. able catch die something supposed vaccinated against?

Because virus continues mutate change, viruses like do. true vaccines helpful Delta variant earlier variants virus, still quite helpful. Unvaccinated people still much higher risk getting infected, also getting severely ill. 

The people remain unvaccinated, people get infected faster -- every additional infected person means additional opportunity mutation like Delta appear. 

Delta significantly infectious earlier forms coronavirus. advanced, dangerous version virus circulating time vaccines developed. vaccines tailored three version virus circulating time, protective earlier versions. vaccines protect us quite well Delta earlier variants. said: vaccine still protects people, somewhat less protective before. 

The longer allow virus circulate unchecked half population unvaccinated, faster mutate create even dangerous versions itself. Every new mutation could make vaccines less less effective. literally race virus mutating vs. people getting vaccinated. 71.5% person quoted refers entire population (including kids ineligible), equivalent figure States 50% fully vaccinated.

/s Refusal vaccine even bigger problem masks. least Delta. always damn blacks fault cleetus? thems good blacks! Well obviously depends doing.. easy thing estimate. let's see start US case numbers: 400 per million infected day. 50% vaccinated go estimated 50% reduction infection, would 533/1000000 risk day unvaccinated (because vaccinated would 267/1000000 make overall risk correct).

Now, way know many unvaccinated wearing masks, massive differences states, undertesting, 50% estimate necessarily right, rough guess.

Over time, everyone unvaccinated infected, vaccine effectiveness calculations calculated instantaneous risks (a 50% efficiency estimate necessarily mean 50% vaccinated eventually infected). CDC guideline sometime

That CDC guideline month no?

In June, 4 days advised masks worn all, CDC announced you‚Äôre vaccinated don‚Äôt need wear mask.

This remains correct. cannot happen full FDA approval. soon occurs, vaccine makers allowed modify events new variants dictate, much like currently see flu shot.

Another key process getting approval kids. two things place see pretty quick rollouts annual seasonal boosters, help lot. people take shot.

If current numbers refusals continue, going last many years local epidemics worldwide endemic. top that, still something like 80% global populace simply access all. get vaccine wanted to, add chance new variants emerging.

Because high vaccination rates. Implying NE waiting beast surge taking overall (positive) impact vaccination consideration. 

Yes, individual instances breakthrough cases (moving forward especially current surge) look course pandemic, measuring impact virus' course cousin got covid even fully vaccinated, need look patterns absolute numbers. Vaccinated people may still able spread delta much unvaccinated, odds getting infected *in first* place still significantly lower, well duration infected *much* shorter...thus vaccination still massive impact total public health outcomes.

I live NYC actually need look ""nuance"" know going 'hump' rather scary surge (like Florida Texas) high vaccination rates. Therefore impact delta (while still ideal) still far less severe overwhelming healthcare systems. Believe me, throughout entire ordeal know horrific pre-vaccine surges looks like, aint it. 

The Rt 1 *yet*, quickly headed next two weeks, means we're seeing North Eastern places like NY right basically 'worst' far Delta concerned (it's essentially endemic us.) mean still issues moving forward years covid, hot spots always prevalent flu season mesh it... unless another variant rears head KO's delta, country whole also verge become endemic. Places like Florida Missouri's Rt falling 1 week, means they're going mess September even end August. get needles arms fast. Someone complaining dollars tax pay slip. 50 lose mind.

(Honestly, gut says would particularly good poor POC anything everything...they're building tent outside hospital San Antonio using parking garage Mississippi. really perfectly equal odds poor POC poor white person get parking garage bed? even get bed? mean I'm sure they're best but...) 

There seem several ways proceed encouraging vaccination / implementation NPIs:

1) nothing different today (full disclosure - honestly believe US end bit null discussion)

I think strong data averaging problem surveys going make hard universal answer. 

I believe argument Chicago (and lot metros), access likely #1 issue. think likely solved money sensitive community engagement. Hopefully, local governments aware working that. seems like challenging solvable one.

I think large parts country, particularly rurally, access much issue political / ideological (I get want believe either told point blank multiple times). least rural perspective, hospitals, clinics, hometown hospital would send someone come give shot house needed vax levels still low. incentives get shots lot disincentives (e.g., socially group identity). think fix without involving money even know works. honestly, us engage frustrated seems lack reasonable path forward. 

I mean think deeply held identify, imagine perceived completely turning back everyone community identity. would hard. Overwhelming hospital system seems helping boost rates (which may either never access issue changed incentives important do, sure) really hope that's best answer leading lot needless suffering.

2) Local mandates - seems like best way enforce could uniquely tailored situation. think cities like Chicago could really interesting creative things right funding. work lot states state laws restricting mask vaccine mandates.

 3) State mandates - would tougher broader, would allow coverage rural populations, states smaller rural populations, could path push vaccinations. Likely Illinois could also good way. feasible South

4) Federal mandates - potential limited application enforcement, e.g., military. military vaccination mandate would likely lot good South number military bases would line previous rulings. likely feasible path forward federal government.

5) Private company mandates - reason, seem differed here, likely mandates broadly implemented. think couple forms could take Mississippi  offering coronavirus booster people 60 already U.S. decision made cases far still indicate people remain highly protected COVID-19, including delta variant, receiving two-dose Pfizer Moderna regimen one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson U.S. health officials made clear Sunday preparing possibility time boosters may come sooner concern vaccine may start wane effectiveness,‚Äù Collins said. ‚ÄúAnd delta nasty one us try deal with. combination two means may need boosters, maybe beginning first health care providers, well people nursing homes, gradually moving forward‚Äù others, older said delta variant started hitting U.S. hard July, ‚Äúnext couple weeks‚Äù case data help U.S. make President Stephen Hoge said seeing ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infections emerge among vaccinated within six months surprising, even symptoms far life-threatening. ‚ÄúI think suggests going need booster vaccines get winter,‚Äù week, Food Drug Administration said p eople weakened immune systemscan get extra dose Pfizer Moderna vaccines better protect delta variant continues turns data come in, see need give additional dose people nursing homes, actually, people elderly, absolutely prepared quickly,‚Äù said Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden‚Äôs chief medical U.S. currently seeing average 129,000 new infections day ‚Äî 700% increase beginning July ‚Äî number could jump next couple weeks 200,000, level seen since among pandemic‚Äôs worst days January February, Collins Fauci stressed best way stem virus unvaccinated get 60% U.S. population gotten least one dose nearly 51% fully vaccinated, according Centers Disease Control Preventio n.

Freedom free, people want exercise rights, also responsible consequences. 19% still really fucking high

I think anyone seriously believes real number, best interesting Twitter thread (by expert) proposal better experiment look this.

I certainly agree general point, nobody say there's ""no risk"" vaccinated, believe that--at point--the vaccinated able make informed choices much risk tolerate, including going lollapalooza (though personally would still avoid event like that).

The thing keep mind that, likelihood, *all* going end many breakthrough covid infections lifetime. Antibodies always wane (and basically want fade--our blood can't unlimited protein it), memory b cells stop us getting sick altogether, keep us hospital.

Some ... less effective ... partially ... somewhat reduce effectiveness vaccines, make moot. think we're currently similar case right covid booster shots? two doses right seem good enough, booster certainly hurt. However, they're extremely reluctant even allow people get one.

I two doses Moderna several months back. Now, get wrong, absolutely want take dose someone still trying get initial vaccination. state right throwing thousands doses. 

Again, want take vaccine someone still needs initial dose. doses literally thrown trash. Earlier year, county kept wait list critical groups, could called extra doses available end day. say, 30 healthy, 65+ prioritized, could get dose extra left over. 

We absolutely booster shots. absolutely know they're 100% necessary, certainly hurt. CDC encouraging counties offer extra doses wanting booster.

But instead, they're playing paternalistic BS start pandemic. want people interpret ""you get booster"" ""you need booster."" They're also afraid people interpreting vaccine effective. instead, throw away thousands doses could least minor good booster shots. r/wtf Good.

Mandates access places number one. don‚Äôt see shutting everything everyone would come simply barring unvaccinated going places. Plenty evidence shows covid vaccinated significantly worse cold. Furthermore, people going forced quarantine (with consequent loss work) cold. this, people definitely consider catching covid might affect them, take appropriate steps (according needs) mitigate risk.

In contrast, evidence confidence vaccine eroded telling people consider breakthrough infection might affect them, even put hospital. Likewise, there's evidence urging people rationally assess risks lead sort loss country.

Finally, although can't prove it, anecdotal evidence suggests adding thumbs poorly reasoned, deflective response nothing win case. fun look at. shut things down, people hospital right going ignore rules.

Which greater risk?

- vaccine

- contracting covid understood science, know observations change data quantity gets better. They're supposed to. That's point. bothered understand political messaging intersects science, ""confusion"" around COVID exist mind. 

Everyone knows still contract spread virus even vaccinated. vaccines never advertised magic shield. That's work -- ***they're supposed keep getting seriously ill***.

See, good Internet trolls address salient points made previous posts. I've asked several questions ignored continue pretending uninformed. great Internet trolls pick better things ""ask"" better questions about.

When affects others, be.

These people literally killing others--both eating hospital capacity spreading deadly disease--with selfishness arrogance.

If government right force us stay home see families holidays (also fundamental rights), able either mandate vaccine ration care rest us suffer again. true, **are** knowingly putting others risk getting vaccinated, wearing masks, washing hands. cases people knowingly spreading disease. case man getting plane, landed, got plane, turned around said, ""Ha! covid! too!"" believe arrested right there. They've predicting total collapse since March 2020. Somehow happen. sudden surge patients nothing system. idiots problem. Many countries experienced similar surge. Italy, France etc. none ""collapsed"". going collapse either. want criticize system, fine, fair enough. nothing surge patients due pandemic. True; pre-April probably lack delta variant, (when every country seeing uptick deaths) good fortune probably thanks vaccines. can‚Äôt nothing. don‚Äôt hate them,  zero regard someone put others danger. forms pressure applied. asked children clean rooms won‚Äôt. room must still cleaned. That‚Äôs article says well Would curious know if/when taste/smell comes back since you‚Äôre vaccinated. want downplay concerns, think also important remember things happen people without presence covid, everything (or even things) going circle back it. covid exist telling things, would probably say get stress test done / monitor mental health. symptoms almost word word mirror time life experiencing mild panic attacks.

I've periods life work stressful, negative life event occurred (I'm sure dad ICU health problems stressful life event), mention world chaotic every news headline extreme - definitely backlash peoples overall wellbeing. Dude, can't take mild criticism Reddit maybe stay internet. merely giving info AHA are. allow logic taught Texas Florida anymore.... Funny, cab driver Memphis told thing, years ago. smart young people leave, view. Unfortunately, can‚Äôt approve it. need establish safety clear-cut, objective data. 

Rushing process would undermine entire vaccination effort. implement widescale way verify vaccination status? Nurses sayign God nonsense come outstanding  assume flown? can't imagine patient needing ICU care would sent 15 hour roadtrip, whatever would be.

If so, must adding incredible strain logistics chain medical systems, well. story comes every 6 months. Wake actually amounts something. I'm arguing all. point moot, pay play system family always place line, likely front! see sources repeatedly office outside office told people get vaccines. many countries got things right spring 2020. talked treatments not. Ya sarcasm inferred end neither haha

Edit: shrivelled little heart sounds sarcastic. take back lol updated versions articles.... god busses come rural areas, people would likely yell them/assault area. overreaction based school board meetings already. Got first shot days ago. Taking shots better risk/reward IMO idea 2 set?  Soon anti-vaxxers mum please remove semen freezer, preparing save humanity. fascinating‚Äîthank sharing it!

Everyone doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated point despite overwhelming research favor vaccine suck too. goes double crazy healthcare providers aren‚Äôt it. 

My co-workers got done year half shitake, half nurses therapists working last year gone. 

You don‚Äôt want vaccine wear masks? Fine, unless you‚Äôre kiddo can‚Äôt get absolutely anaphylactic vaccine, don‚Äôt say boo you‚Äôre ECMO family crying zoom die. agree you. first reaction question hell yeah! willingly putting others risk serious disease. reading comment realize open huge worms. opens precedent fault injuries/diseases. *could* well lead people getting needed care things fault, could perceived such. sad wish could do. Though, believe **forced** vaccinations answer either. could propaganda keep perpetuating fear machine speaking miracles, rnt churches taking patients? /s Common sense common :( Interesting. Hope works.

I also feel like heard something year ago disappeared. ü§î thing is, whole world can't vaccinated. much vaccine resistance time need 90% people vaccinated control spread. Delta infectious vaccines work levels skepticism. think ideas sound strictly orthodox viewpoint. end, something extreme hope stopping endless variant cycle. Vaccines greatly reduce death variants, ultimately assist spread next variant, mutated variants enjoy natural selection conditions create outdated vaccines. Death DeSantis? like death dumb getting vaccinated. enough vaccines everyone, time people start taking personal responsibility. Anybody still hoarding toilet paper? Reality still whenever decide accept it. Hope helps. Mmm, horse tartar saw attempted coup try prevent getting inaugurated....... seem want die covid.... hate anyone tries stop them.... Silver lining: pandemic was/is great filter nursing profession, weed lot undesirables/politically compromised better future it. I'm discussion like that, [right  Vaccines still seem working well touted Exactly. click bait journalism.  Excess death count is. deaths due Covid weren‚Äôt counted Covid. guessing actually anything back with.

Very informative convo. Emperors get new groove! Desantis temper tantrum coming 3...2...1.. experience? Mine different.  too, would rather didn't. close Orlando? Yes. Try Googling ""Pfizer trial third dose"" find it. 1. fact happy healthcare pay play says way douchiness mine. 
2. Triage always around. dictate receive care. puts people line receive it. Adults unvaxxed go back line. 

Interesting vehemently arguing this. faith immune system faith healthcare system created vaccine, would turn healthcare system needed it? mean really, agreeing me. family catches COVID, stay home. always vocal inordinately powerful minority immensely stupid selfish people, political power back up. we've allowed hold society back time time again. Look Rt values even regions low non existent vaccination? R0 isn‚Äôt even relevant Delta population entirely susceptible infection. basic assumptions calculation based wrong. Hmmm.. seen 70 degree weather, i'll take word it. know kid got yelled wearing jacket temps haha.  vaccination help 6 weeks. Masks distancing would help reduce new infections immediately new hospitalizations two weeks. 

The reality they've setup fail Governor, plain simple. getting worse gets better. preface think he's murderous steaming pile shit, *is* pro-vaccine talks often vaccinated himself. however, goes *shaming* chose get vaccinated. still sucks. Iceland took around April 2021 really ramp vaccinations, think vaccines reason 1 covid death 2021. I'm sure helped lot though clearly Oh yeah makes sense. I‚Äôm still trying wrap head around affected, least vaccinated regions also truculently opposed mitigation initiatives. mean, guess simultaneously get don‚Äôt get it. Whats better source CNN? know. Maybe solution. things bad hospitals can't treat patients, need change tactics. think government Bill Gates want depopulate earth cause climate change shit like lol. live rural area midwest seems like everyone falling conspiracies. mass hysteria Instructions unclear. got vaccination arm. makes sense want vaxxed. 100%, either approve vaccine keep kids school til ""We've tried nothing we're ideas"" /r/BrandNewSentence Completely agree here. Maintain hospital usual elective surgeries like. unvaccinated go sort lottery system beds allocated them. rest put home hospice style care. Obviously doesn‚Äôt count people legitimate reasons get vaccinated. severe symptoms even vaccinated imagine bad things would immune system prepared virus.

It‚Äôs like asking, ‚ÄúI rolled car still serious injuries even though wore seatbelt. seatbelt even worth it?‚Äù commonly mentioned fact people crowd indoors summer Florida major contributing factor. saying American healthcare ""brutal nightmare majority population""? far know majority US population medical insurance. everyone good insurance sure call brutal nightmare. Absolutely does. parents unwilling get vaccine things dangerous children Delta variant, negligent parents. could bring thing home kids time. fact, going family. dad pleaded anti-VAX brother sister-in-law reconsider get vaccine sake four-year-old niece, brother incensed dad would even suggest it. fact, also pulling preschool also don‚Äôt want wear mask üôÑIt‚Äôs heartbreaking think grew brother love death, wife part cult fueled Newsmax ‚Äúindividualism.‚ÄùI seriously don‚Äôt think ever get back, it‚Äôs devastating. know many families also going conflict. shouldn‚Äôt likely, jurisdiction least cases matching profile.  now, able give away. passed FDA standards testing (actual) experimental phase one year -- no, beta. covid-19 vaccine held exact standards every vaccine produced America. going go additional phase made ""better"", it. 85-96% efficacy good *ever* get.

It took fiance 8 months get full sense smell back. virus way 'experimental' human body highly protective safe vaccine is. 

NYC hump right rather scary surge going straight (like Florida) coincidence, vaccine working. I‚Äôm sorry don‚Äôt seem understand I‚Äôm saying. You‚Äôre emotionally responsive unvaccinated. am, don‚Äôt hate unvaccinated think responsible hospital bill. 

What you‚Äôre understanding mentality, unvaccinated ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù this‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs wrong, won‚Äôt end covid unvaccinated people foot bill. Others impacted, including vaccinated. seems case. Finally, reasonable take. ""I suppose perspective, one given one choose seek out.""

Well choose use anecdotal evidence wacko internet rando shape perspective. 

It sound like we're agreement though. seem like healthy bunch. get sick Covid, stay fuck away hospital :) ""Israeli American researchers discovered nanobody cocktail could neutralize coronavirus, including Delta mutation.""   Even then, skewed upwards massively uneven distribution income -- turn hold candle uneven distribution wealth. healthcare world sustain sudden surge patients. Look happened Europe. called pandemic reason. idiocy population different story. British Columbia stated ""coupling "" cases, ICU Deaths. Meaning longer counting cases decide health restrictions enforce monitoring deaths ICU rates. get past covid. need daily case count eternity, death rate jumps icu beds fill choice informed act data  us children 12? I'm worried anymore, wife oldest kid (22). concerned getting giving 11 year old especially go store essentials almost nobody wearing mask think vaccine magic bullet pandemic over, stupidly anti mask beginning. age, vaccination status, assuming major auto-immune issues, nearly 100%. honestly believe you. mean following guidelines adhering local regulations appropriate? did. Yeah dunno south. going whole hog risk. Happened India too. disaster was.  Long term definitely is. Short term, obese getting covid also bad combo. Magic 8 ball says: Ask later. Important note shut schools sometimes contain flu (and sometimes simply many teachers get sick). covid deadlier spreading easily, expect happen often going forward. Same. need gym work (I lack motivation home workouts). cannot risk sedentary months waiting surge pass. go gym wear mask. gotten tested regularly never positive I‚Äôll keep I‚Äôm doing. think see run away growth cases like see south states northeast woman children, us too. lot people deal absolutes haven‚Äôt reached conclusion.  vaccinate under-12s surge inevitable simply delayed mitigated. large hospital surge certainly avoidable high (95% like UK, perhaps) percentage over-40s over-50s vaccinated.  governor wears mesh mask ü§îü§îü§î dead people. work extremely well still severe disease protection cells might undeterred variants. think one thing trials couldn‚Äôt pick number people who, lack better phrase, can‚Äôt helped vaccines. infirm, immunocompromised, condition. number people likely still decent risk even vaccinated. agree things, then, think people punished one get sick. Since 2/3 unvaccinated people open vaccines, business travel bans would incentivize compliance

""hey, can't come unless proof vaccinations""

""I got around yet, workin alot. Know get one wait long? expensive? ""

""Sure, go (vaccination clinic) today get one free waiting""

""Oh awesome, I'll then, thanks! ""

90% conversations would go like that.  covid season

This thing. enforce without also enforcing vaccine passport? lmao. Woman 15 year old, 6 year old 3 year old. 

CAN CONFIRM hospital longer existing, federal govt shutting down, massive lawsuits, National Guard called (although, amusingly, don‚Äôt actually / aren‚Äôt allowed anything).   Massive amounts state ed funding comes Feds. guess whatever Feds pay now, they'll deduct whatever give Florida next year. think people reached conclusion already. need effective treatment reasonable preventative policies.  refusing hospital services unvaccinated point. They‚Äôve chance. Totally don‚Äôt blame quitting. Sucks vaccinated people urgent health needs getting fucked over, that‚Äôs fault. Japanese Breakfast üî• completely missed point. everyone vaxxed, cases among vaxxed ppl. mean think means. Objectively vaccination key. Keep spelling mistake Whats vaccination / anti-vax culture like there? seems pretty low minority anti-vaxxers here, still know few. goto universal too? heard Disney better masks universal.

Also crowds general? Ive checking apps wait times seem bad  Disappointing. I‚Äôm glad Biden didn‚Äôt go.   wish. BC removed Mandatoty Masks, depending setting, people really taking advantage that. I'd say less 25% people morning commute wear one train.

Unsurprisingly worst outbreak Canada growing fast--not one area anymore either. There‚Äôs growing consensus among health experts: Covid-19 may never go away. We‚Äôll likely always coronavirus there, infecting people and, hopefully rare cases, getting seriously ill. realistic goal defang virus ‚Äî make less deadly ‚Äî eliminate entirely. 
This surrender virus. long time, we‚Äôve lived seasonal flu, family viruses kills tens thousands Americans year. take steps mitigate risks flu (including getting vaccinated every year), we‚Äôve never willing shut society close in-person schooling fully eradicate it. Americans accepted level risk continue living normally. 
The likely true Covid-19. highly transmissible delta variant appears cemented possibility, showing coronavirus continue spread even states countries higher vaccination rates. close 80k.

I read detail that. ""bear week"" (or whatever properly called) p-town. I'm absolutely shocked breakthrough infection. Exactly. Turning away unvaccinated Covid patients like turning away people jumped predator pen zoo take selfie. people bear much blame easily avoidable mistake absolute rock bottom health care system's priority list. completely irresponsible wrong state ""vaccine offer protection contracting"". who's cherry picking?

The hospitalization rate fully vaccinated people slightly less 1 hospitalization per 100,000 people almost deaths reported among people fully vaccinated. 

This we're talking about, death. Almost deaths. Get it?

And deaths among unhealthy.

Just like said. Enjoy rest day. budget saving state, making feds pay? state funds pay diverted elsewhere. kind ""opportunity"" expect Republicans exploit without remorse. someone trapped toddler since pandemic began, understand this. get load kid trusted friend month towards end last year. probably would started drinking heavily myself.

We believe prophets apostles get together come messages like inspired God. (Not everything leadership says would considered ""gospel"" fallible people like anyone us. I.e. books previous apostles church written, considered 100% rule gospel since approved *all* current leadership. would like good advice/reading gospel).

That said, announcement approved all. would considered inspired God. claim trust prophets, follow actually trust prophets apostles. Basically little faith. 

I also consider important guidances. I.e. members supposed try best like Christ right? swearing crude jokes etc would considered following taught. guess difference would be: swearing every others life danger. improve overtime. getting vaccination wearing mask actively putting people's life's danger.

--

That said 100% surprised pushback people. brings leave church proving tares (parable wheat tares). 

There's pretty large problem comes culture areas high amount LDS members. church becomes status symbol religious practice. general ""holier thou"" vibe run rampant areas (Kaysville Utah I'm looking you). obviously contrary church, gospel, scriptures teach. Christ taught us love everyone. Help others goodness hearts like Pharisees donating lots money show everyone much money awesome are. 

It's necessarily unique LDS church church's fault. Things slowly start become tradition greed takes ahold people. begin teaching kids friends thing x really thing x taught condoned church. I.e local leader (like bishop similar) telling people let kids stay night friend's house. eventually became really common among Mormon families.

The church stepped game recently trying combat it. Lots members know tend right leaning like things like immigration helping refugees even though Christ specifically taught us help everyone even like them. (You fed clothed me... Parable simaritan, etc). church amended parts [general specific. [webpage dedicated now. 

Good addition handbook: ""Church members offer time, talents, friendship welcome immigrants refugees members communities."" yep, exploded husband....thank god live north us..... would like point born east side. asshole urgh. totally administrations fault deciding vaccination record use ridiculous ancient tech possible. freakin 2021, using hand written piece paper important medical record carry next years. American find disgusting. nowhere near people experienced there. think 'thinking medication harmful' 'shooting children spear gun' similar terms crazy level? maybe stop vitriol try spreading good information. wrong things before, sometimes confidently incorrect. Calling people psychos comparing violent murderers gonna convince anyone get vaccinated. thing illegal clicking ‚ÄúI certify true‚Äù button  heard serial passage? genetics research capable eliminating possibility deliberate genetic engineering. virologists leave heavy lifting nature, artificially pressure viruses contagious.

I'm glad hear truly minor case. Stay safe! worry it. count days starting day 4 day 12. develop symptoms document those, came on, quarantine home. count days every single time go something required work, go hospital checkup. Really? way force sitting governor resign Florida? mean, happens if, hypothetically, Florida governor something really outrageous, even borderline criminal? Say something like NY's Cuomo happened. Florida voters choice wait next election?  US insurance refunds isn‚Äôt spent overhead healthcare. think required law‚Ä¶.because doesn‚Äôt seem like something company would voluntarily. 

So excess premiums would float back insured. No. Every time new variant comes everyone fear monger set restrictions. Enough enough. Time move  Interesting article. mutation figures mind boggling Exactly. Go half hour north south Salt Lake surrounded completely different types people.

HYPOCRISY I‚Äôm assuming way based know US employers pay employees, things worded employers talk new hire. Niiice. fuck would choose florida poster child ideals????? Even long covid, long trump... florida sketchy meth addict state u/maxinux61, broh? entirely predictable outcome occured  difference vaccines. Mandates happening continue increase FDA gives Pfizer FDA approval told 20 yo I'd living Florida 40's I'd never believe it. I've always despised state. People often say Key West isnt Florida, vibe rest FL sure. There's expression state, *The south get Northern gets, north get Southern gets.*

No offense taken, realize live! got breakthrough Covid Pfizer. careful! people forget many rural people rarely leave 50 square mile area. working people busy schedules cant leave duties easily. also listen type media truly know. imagine bad newspapers local tv options news. Okay, seems like reputable source, Center Infectious Disease Research Policy University Minnesota. Citing data Congress's General Accounting Office.

They're saying 85% troops received anthrax vaccine reported adverse side effects. service member received vaccine. friend claims completely disabled adverse side effect vaccine. understand cause concern would like hear doctors respond vaccine injury claims these, right? Type ""readify.me/"" front http.... It‚Äôs also treating one urgent needs (unvaccinated) one mild flu like symptoms (vaccinated). everyone unvaccinated dead man walking can‚Äôt assume they‚Äôre going denied care triage. short, based way article worded (poorly) either one us might right, without clarifying info, there‚Äôs way positive right.

This basically going respond. point need make assumption. chose go monthly low end sufficient motivator view I'm still satisfied. Last summer's wave peaked around time worse wave hit winter. crazy think peak weeks gone next fall. crazy think virus take holidays totally ignoring happened last year. understand wanting live fear caring get covid. Though find ironic term many use ones spouting truly frightening conspiracies‚Ä¶

What DON‚ÄôT understand beginning, people willingly exposed (and others) knowing hospitals overcrowded, got sick fucking went anyway. bad enough. vaccine‚Ä¶ people choosing get it. What‚Äôs thought process here? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad go hospital‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like I‚Äôd DIE!‚Äù

Makes wonder secretly believe healthcare American right? schools schools   No, absolutely false, ashamed posting nonsense. hospitals overcrowded, cases, hospitilizations deaths higher places US.

You're obviously looking total cases throughout past 2 years, ridiculous, since hospitals overcrowded now, bad policies now. Right, stop vaccinating future might variant doesn‚Äôt work against. Might well die delta case. (or least many) American Catholics believe birth control, gay marriage, women priests, abortion rights, everything separates liberal Protestants Catholic doctrine, still support Catholic brand. (Of course, American ex-Catholics single sect besides Catholic.) Polls show American Catholics liberal Protestants American Catholic Church one powerful Conservative political forces. Thought masks, immunizations, passports full force NYC ? Same! got attacked another thread saying Pfizer sucks. does, husband currently breakthrough Covid. Pfizer vaccinated friend family got virus too. Pro-disease Customs Border Protection officers Memphis, Tennessee, seized thousands fake Covid-19 vaccination cards far night"" officers seizing shipments Shenzhen, China, headed New Orleans, Louisiana, containing dozens blank counterfeit vaccination cards, CBP said a¬†press release¬†Friday. Died covid... overdosed FREEEEEDOM \*USA USA USA\* Ok, buh bye then. I‚Äôm sorry, sounds like BS. lasts quarantines start happening realize work home quarantine cause shits office can't come boss logistically get shit house may Covid. 

So suddenly whole office work home fuck working better way. Since charge pre-existing conditions/choices like one, employer insurance also charge conditions people responsible for, cancer, things related personal choices? It‚Äôs hilarious complaining free agency it‚Äôs first time Mormon prophet communicated sort expectations. That‚Äôs nonsense. Two weeks pause will
Absolutely nothing cut spread Covid Suppose 5 people lobby identical problems. four spaces hospital three insurance( sufficient funds) person wait? find hard believe would handled dart board dice. 

I sure much experience hospitals do. actually something licensed nurse decides? Reception billing usually screened ever talked nurse. 

They make sign financial liability paperwork. someone trying get admitted insanity. refused sign anything grounds right mind know would still agree anything signed recovery. recall impasse lasted really long time. Reception never gave in. doctor eventually bypassed them. listening hours knew better escort home without seeing doctor. one doctor, nurse, reception doubt crazy time. 

So correct technically get without signing admission paperwork. vast majority people (normal cooperative sane people) would walked away later said refused hospital care refused sign financial liability.   personally don‚Äôt think necessary, especially often. 

I think good chance boosters least people (elderly, at-risk categories), maybe anyone wants one, going fall. 

After think covid become endemic, people rely least somewhat cellular immunity (T cells memory B cells pump antibodies needed). 

The big question yearly boosters recommended going forward alluded along flu shots. vaccine companies working combo ones. know moderna wants flu, covid, rsv vaccine, said would targeted elderly population. Tough guess stuff far out. think there‚Äôs decent chance, may emphasized less less time goes on. Lots variables. shouldn‚Äôt within 100 yards patient. That‚Äôs win. Pre-existing condition life choice mutually exclusive. ACA makes exception smokers, means charging could've problem insurers, despite smoking choice.   health writer:

""This lack science education looks like: unhinged, invective-hurling Southerners. They're angry medical experts favor face masks schools. Tennessee ugly backwater uneducated. 1925 held 'Scopes Monkey Trial' block teaching evolution."" happened height pandemic last year. didn‚Äôt really problem getting ER. hospital basically two separate lines, one Covid patients another trauma, heart attack, etc. didn‚Äôt get moved room 24hrs. sure why. hospital dedicated Covid floor trauma floor. 

Why bad genuinely want know admitted hospitals back grounds? I‚Äôve seen ppl get sick two days others weeks. something wrong looking science behind causing this? something wrong asking truthful information?  Whats sad people find whole situation ""extremely EPIC""   I'm sorry. really big thing without. hope time, bet better us. Yeah too, things horrendous. fingers crossed you! begins. Exactly... personally care another person vaccinated aside mutation issue (which big issue, past certain point vaccinated population, care).

But people refusing vaccine ones refusing masks social distancing practices LYING vaccination status driving spread. They're filling hospitals. feel remotely safe taking kids public... let alone send school? trust ""community"" shattered. Last year could confident even children fell ill, could receive medical care. That's looking less likely (or least less expedient) hour.

And still I'll send six year old small Montessori school mental health, too, breaking point. think could feel cynical felt last year. feels insurmountable. Update FL: 20.8% positivity disinformation pandemic ( issues ) needs addressed countered new tactics. telling people isn‚Äôt true work. dangerous. pharmacist tell certainty many many parents come lie children's age. come claim insurance, tell may underage.

Same applies boosters.

It's difficult us get us lot trouble, unfortunately nothing it. Ah that‚Äôs good. Yes, took 6 weeks 12 birthday Extremely high. Even vaccination he'd something like 99% chance survival (without knowing specific situation, based age alone) though substantial threat needing hospitalization (5-10% risk based CDC estimates). vaccinated, odds much better. Like, 99.9% chance survival maybe 1 2% chance needing hospitalization. think that's going long tail. People able get needed preventive care chronic illnesses elective surgeries going get postponed cancelled, like last year. 

When first heard elective surgeries getting cancelled last year, like ""Cool, people wait boob jobs whatever pandemic,"" ""elective"" means ""If surgery right now, die today."" However, lot cardiovascular stuff, excisions tumors spinal surgeries prevent permanent damage paralysis fall ""elective,"" know, die today surgery immediately, right?

So I'm pretty sure we're going see advanced cardiovascular shit cancer diagnosed and/or treated later stages time over, we'll dealing fall years. Vaccine + Mask Compliance (even us fully vaccinated) effective way mitigate surge

Good luck, hope get relief soon  vaccine 100%, we‚Äôve known along, also less regarding delta variant. isn‚Äôt feasible everyone stay homes forever wait pass.

Additionally, many healthy people cannot get vaccine yet time, including children pregnant women. 

Obviously healthy talking preventative steps suggested CDC lower chance contracting COVID, still won‚Äôt keep anyone completely safe. 

Here‚Äôs summarized data actual source: neutralization levels vaccinated sera lower Delta variant compared original Data indicate Delta 40-60% transmissible Alpha almost twice transmissible original Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2. study, conducted U.K., reported 88% efficacy Delta 2 doses mRNA vaccine, 30.7% efficacy 1 469 identified cases COVID-19, 346 74% breakthrough infections occurred people fully vaccinated 2 doses Pfizer Moderna, 1 dose J&amp;J vaccine. Genomic analysis revealed Delta responsible 90% 133 sequenced breakthrough infections. information prompted CDC recommend use masks indoor public spaces, regardless vaccination status, areas COVID-19 transmission high

[Here‚Äôs source, where‚Äôs idea?  SF trending down? That‚Äôs bigger news me. first hit delta? that‚Äôs case, sounds promising communities good precautions high vaccination rates. headline they've told 2 years.  soon vaccines FDA approved, people rude awakening. feel going norm insurance companies that. areas, schools (private public), corporate public sector mandate vaccines too.

COVID care (and long term issues) huge money sink extremely easy FREE fix.

Get vaccinated people. sounds like you‚Äôre comfortable trip. agree local state mandates best way address issue. There's reason can't example quarentine residents florida travel states without vaccine countries.

 way isolate antivaxers would nice, part deal want people community feel unsafe. hospitalized people indeed unvaccinated, much *spread* driven breakthrough cases vaccinated. Vaccine efficacy infection ~65% Delta, catch breakthrough case infectious unvaccinated person.  vast majority hospitalised unvaccinated

Saved click. Orrrrrr pay people stay home. creates lots unnecessary pollution?  Whips lamas ass ‚ÄúThe situation Mississippi hospitals dire it‚Äôs ever been.

5-10 days?! There's really levels ""pandemic breakdown""/response fatigue, huh. I've definitely spiraled bit whew. someone reposted \^^ Honest, good-faith answer write:

At time, macro sense getting Covid bit concerning getting cold. spreads lot easier, you‚Äôre infected you‚Äôre around someone that‚Äôs vulnerable, chances they‚Äôre gonna get it, get pretty bad, clearly. Covid puts someone hospital person tends remain lot longer flu diseases. We‚Äôre talking two week stays, iirc get hospitalized flu it‚Äôs 3-5 days average. see lot 80% icu capacity, true hospitals reach point winter, Covid effectively doubles number actual beds needed- ordinarily count beds turned around.

Secondly, personal level, couple things don‚Äôt like. biggest one loss taste smell- usual symptom colds, it‚Äôs common one Covid, even otherwise mild, head cold like disease. people report quick recovery front. report changes sense smell work. seems longest lingering symptom Covid usually presents- you‚Äôre symptoms lasting six weeks longer, it‚Äôs probably lost taste. isn‚Äôt world ender- people long term otherwise completely fine, lot enjoy life based taste smell. It‚Äôd shame lose it. 

I‚Äôm reassured next front based know, questions still there: long Covid. still don‚Äôt know likely happen vaccination. 

So short, that‚Äôs it‚Äôs concerning cold. whether it‚Äôll concerning flu five years, remains seen. woman child turning two soon. YES. feel bad it? Sure. like rough fucking tear half.

Obviously there‚Äôs still lot things put people ICU. thinking autocentric. Narcissists excessively vain, normally looks bits percieved superiority, autocentrics believe matter.

Basically, people rungs nutjobs believe reality exists solely exist, death result reality collapsing. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck THAT!!! go CDC estimates 4.2 infections every detected case (this estimate May), 45% infected. hospitals overwhelmed problem *everyone* needs kind treatment. think covid reason anyone might ever need hospital bed? county doesn‚Äôt coffers cover extra costs Covid. Additional funds come charity, state, federal government. Sheila Jackson Lee called Gov. Abbott federal government step (in article). 

In-person school starts nine days. needs cancelled conducted online. Abbott refuses cancel in-person school, Delta outbreak among children worst outbreak seen far, possibly historic.

I live County number people claiming going move Indiana, never mind boggling. point go, ""don't let door hit ass way out."" Delta terrifies me. killing people indiscriminately. Healthy, unhealthy, young amd old, etc. thought next variant scares even more. hope one kill vaccinated easily delta kills. Yep, exactly. Yep. Facebook group people returned missionaries. us either already vaxxed accept move on. keep trying rationalize somehow it‚Äôs sad hilarious bit frustration stupid people are.

This one reasons got irritated people quick praise internal lockdowns. Needing lockdown internally sign abject failure praised heavily, especially travel restrictions much easier long-term period. Dude. Mishandling church funds number 2 way get excommunicated. smart move follow rules association church matters you. 

An aside: members may asked/choose donate 'fast offering' fund, donations may collected door door young men. However, money donated fund connected tithing. Aside balancing congregation congregation, administered local level provide help members within local congregation. implication church needed tithing money, wards weren‚Äôt paying online well resorting going door door make sure coffers stay filled.

It true outside bishoprics collecting per church policy since always. soliciting tithing donations door door, either.

Anything else directed general level church. completely actual directives - guidelines - given general area authorities leadership trainings communications regarding procedure covid.  quit become ""travel"" nurse travels hospitals near nearly doubled hourly. So, I'm okay. Also- live state high vaccination rate hopefully anything like Florida TN right now. Fingers crossed. 203 people self-reported positive tests. exactly gold star data hide, animals? Yeah, I'm wondering employers increase prices pay, dangling carrot like suggested option. Raising prices would incentive makes negative change finances, opposed making envious. nothing unethical all. Make sure least 3 months J&amp;J shot though - trials gave absurdly good results pretty comparable, that's long waited. Shame educated working-age adults died treatable disease due unable get regular health screenings cancer treatments necessary surgeries last year... know. everyone family Mormon except son. older never miss day church members going decades gotten vaccinated take Covid serious. ones members occasionally go strong libertarian philosophy.They act like good Mormons actually actually participate church much. least thats observations observing extended family. Good them! Takes burden parents trying decide kids. went school durango. damn texans.    thing is, Delta variant amazingly contagious everyone getting exposed. vaccines working - promised they're 85-95% effective, are, 5-15% *everybody* still huge number infected people.

We wanted end Covid going away, looking like ends (most) everybody getting vaccinated, Covid going years, people dying. Healthcare cannot private good. demand inelastic. majority anti-vax crowd, $50 probably already lot alternative medicine really worked, would called medicine. That‚Äôs valid point really hadn‚Äôt considered particular issue you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs similar

1.) Sedatives, like diphenhydramine benzos, cause paradoxical reaction. Instead feeling calmer, may become hyperactive agitated.

2.) Liver metabolism different. linearly faster slower. Depending age group, altogether different since certain receptors transporters undeveloped. drugs, like aspirin, completely avoided kids. 

3.) volume distribution much higher kids. means dose adjustment weight certain drugs straightforward weight adjustment. can't shrink dose proportionally weight call day. 

In nutshell, trying treat pediatrics without proper specialization like walking minefield. probably certain things medical intuition, there's lot killer things could step unfamiliar population. I‚Äôll honest every travel nurse know ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù mode mentally prepare job. Go in, thing, get paid shit ton, they‚Äôre enjoying lives since work 3 4 days week. know couple Florida Texas you‚Äôd think they‚Äôre extended vacation Insta pages always going matter time official system implemented.

It abstract. Emphasis mine.

TLDR vaccine targets Sars-cov2 spike protein. mutations Lambda, unlike Delta, protein. Yes. One hypotheses children catching Covid less children stronger innate immune systems. ""general purpose"" part immune system targets anything looks like virus bacteria opposed immune system learning fight particular pathogen based particular protein sequences. 

However, Delta, doses virus spewed high even kids' stronger innate immune systems tend overwhelmed, kids easily infected too.

Between adults, I'm sure natural biological variations strength innate immune system. Taiwan counts anyone whose ever tested positive later dies Covid-19 death, even death natural related Covod-19.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Right. know he‚Äôs fear mongering type constant haranguing vaccine limitations isn‚Äôt helping surprised much bluster.   It‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm sorry don‚Äôt understand that; also problem. attitude excuse party actively reckless lives 18 months. isn‚Äôt complicated. Netherland's flag wearing, though probably unintentional. France vertical stripes. 

Interestingly, Netherland's vaccination rate equal US. Recently past peak 5th wave quickly reporting half many cases bad still deal winter, look happened last year question isn‚Äôt experience. life-long best friend longer speak went bananas letting home around unvaccinated children (too young) refuses get vaccine. nurse somehow makes even worse. even tried accommodating offer porch visits despite fact deep inside wanted scream her. strict policy unvaccinated friends family inside home made furious thought exception, like conspiracy theory way thinking ultimately important kids' health. 

This shit absolutely dividing people. never forget people cared little children (and children young get vaxxed vulnerable people community) nut get shot wear damn mask while. Makes sense fine dandy vaccine day Biden sworn in. TBH, would want give hard earned money business banned masks. People refusing safe, free, effective vaccine ones causing ICUs overrun South.   don‚Äôt think response intended post. Refusing vaccines directly endangers others. ""My right swing fist ends nose begins."" know, probably bit over-dramatic. weird fair number people could work medical profession, see effects this, co-workers doctors, come decision ""nope, I'm gonna pass vaccine"". [I prefer building Good. working medicine.  Idk pinky promises sure seemed real 7.  Eastern PA (so far) isn‚Äôt bad all. One hospital system Philly area 3 ICU COVId patients- That‚Äôs 5 hospitals.

Not saying can‚Äôt change, it‚Äôs bad point. incentivize people get vaccinated. protecting vulnerable people community can't inspire person get vaxxed, maybe allowed see movie eat restaurant will.

Also, unvaccinated would stay fuck home, would stop catching spreading often.

I think unreasonable society say: want participate society, need willing work others protect society. rather thing that's cool, entitled benefit society without contributing it.

People want rights rewards none responsibilities. Sorry, that's works. work hospital? take care Covid patients? Doesn‚Äôt seem vaccinated people ICUs. unvaxed ones. Regular hospitalizations vaxxed, reports I‚Äôve read, they‚Äôre hanging short term. Yeah there's nothing really official looking card all. Hell pharmacy went vaccine even bother updating address apparently last time went Rite Aid college printed childhood address it. Even though know legit, still looks sketchy af personally. call bullshit, school starts next week. Guess we'll see already did.  Yeah that's border state Florida tough time. Hey Hey everyone, anyone help understand what‚Äôs happening Israel surge cases reinstating certain restrictions? anti-vax acquaintances social media field day it. live Australia mantra ‚Äúget vaccinated get perpetual lockdowns‚Äù agree with. surface level least, contradicts that. good sources check this? Thank wanna know young person dying covid vaxxed, already high risk vaxxed people dying breakthrough cases. think really important number look at.  wonder lives somewhere 90%+ population fat diabetic. shocked TN part. shocked TN wasn‚Äôt intended final destination, though. think getting crazy state every day. upside aren‚Äôt Florida.  would need open primaries, rank voting, get rid electoral college. I'd diabetes 1 happening create probe COVID, COVID-19 damaging organs create Diabetes 1? Bye, Felicia read article didn‚Äôt come conclusion did.  

‚ÄúThey modify premiums offer potentially tax-free incentives worth much 30% cost coverage part workplace wellness programs. ‚Ä¶. Government guidance released May suggests long providing proof vaccination voluntary employer isn‚Äôt giving shots, significant incentives jabs fair game.‚Äù

So it‚Äôs quite charging vaccine, allowed significantly incentivize good health practices like getting vaccine. point current BC Alberta outbreaks comparable. BC's surge cannot way beyond rest country Alberta's numbers day two behind BC's. statistical fact. Yeah read that. That's criminal behavior, hope get severely punished. *for now...* read email concerned parent daughters school yesterday, mentioned *PhD* viral immunology, masks *100%* effective‚Äîthey felt mask mandate unnecessary would ‚Äútraumatize‚Äú kid (I feel like long stay hospital would tad traumatizing, know, tomato tomauto).

Yeah, we‚Äôre at. descending madness very, quickly It‚Äôs small history, facts, important. Stating truth delta came doesn‚Äôt change fact need vaccines. Given mass idiocy South (not mention antivaxxers areas well), wouldn‚Äôt surprised next one came US. doesn‚Äôt change fact one not. Must chilly 80 degrees is. Honestly, they're super nice people. amazing neighbors general. bought conspiracy.  Im north SD County/South OC- never stopped wearing mask- cant trust people around wearing masks actually vaccinated. many trumplicans anti vaxxers runing around without masks claiming vaccinated. agree. Also, I'm one made comparison. pointing ridiculous. Small world. UAB? real issue isnt chosen get vaccine, issue without one significantly likely get sick spread others including coworkers sick patients. take nurse one gives covid came asthma attack. 

We need nurses lose people allow willingly put others danger logical reason. Essentially underestimated prevalence ignorance stupidity country. Vaccines expiry dates, point 20M stored would hopefully either used given countries. I'd guess 40M order hoarding, way ensure Canada continued supply increasingly likely scenario booster vaccination necessary.


I give Canada much credit though. Yeah, there's high vaccination rate here, lots vaccine supply. also virtually restrictions much country now, rapidly increasing Delta variant cases. Instead really preparing could happen Delta variant (hospitals overrun again, restrictions again), there's likely Federal election looming - looking like rush campaign recent success try win majority explain managed fall yet another bad situation. Time tell suppose.  aged well  patient covid icu unit. smokers would contribute less average living less. means less taxes/insurance premiums. thought occurred weeks ago. definitely possibility. I'm 100% sure likely is. know enough viruses work feel comfortable guessing feasible set mutations consists of. super virus catch on, would 3 things: evade vaccines, transmissible current dominant strain deadly. seems like lot things would happen. But, one hand, 7 8 billion people passing covid back forth, many also see animals daily basis, many immune disorders. literally never better incubator variants. state vaccinated MIGHT actually recording info somewhere else. Louisiana, state actually central vaccination repository (existed COVID), COVID vaccinations happen Louisiana get entered database. There's also Louisiana Wallet digital drivers license app includes person's COVID vaccination status dates. gets pulled state's database, something shady person update themselves.

(I'm generally one worried things like this, right know, care.) Ok let‚Äôs speed along then.

Oh shit, 70% world vaccinated! guy. Ugh, every day sinks new low Covid evolves fast. father O2 went 94% 83%. taken hospital around 88%. hour later (the time see him) 83%. That‚Äôs bit unfair. think everyone think about, learn vaccine. 

I don‚Äôt understand hesitation past that, though. weight feels protective, shitty stress/binge eating habit. know what's causing there's little it. Common side effect. disappear week two. identification require adolescents? Could bring 11 year old drive vaccine site bluff she‚Äôs 12? Every season Covid season Florida Doctors cannot ethically legally refuse treat patient immediate danger dying. That‚Äôs you‚Äôve brainwashed Hollywood, *obviously*. course will. Catching recovering Covid gives immunity well. reach herd immunity one way another, society decided stupid painful way. cannot imagine intubating child. no. mean, I‚Äôm objectively right given know people left refuse get shot don‚Äôt understand science support particular political party, I‚Äôm sure think I‚Äôm wrong. problem examining multiple sides issue? know hope do, nothing little expect same. Keep owning lbrulZ. It'll work day now. people take actions. Sadly Americans rather deny it‚Äôs take actions.  Ever heard hippocratic oath? hear ya that's medical profession works. Unfortunately It'll collapse start picking choosing. would nationalized. contribute young take old. one counted mathematically, philosophically look lifetime contributing using. 

That‚Äôs much natural ‚Äúthis year met maximum pocket take care problem I‚Äôve putting expensive. I‚Äôm going learn whole fucking Greek alphabet aren‚Äôt I. I'm US.  Seriously look cases LA, FL, TX, GA, SC, NC, VA, MD PA. look super similar, time shifted.  end May max immunity occur 2nd vaccination shot? seems 2 weeks minimum, around 6 months start see drop.

When max? 3 weeks out? 3 months out?  Imagine peak 19 hospitalizations total‚Ä¶

Amazing vaccines NPI‚Äôs do. ‚Ä¶ seems like know what‚Äôs going here. 18 month season? Big brain. Well 2 months ago people would saying that's UAE used crappy Chinese vaccines, whereas sitting pretty superior western made mRNA shots would totally protect us. looks like delta give shit we're gonna need booster shot matter kind vaccines gotten. interesting accepting previous infections Florida Man: Hold beer. Depending situation, requiring people vaccinated certain activities makes sense public health thing. example requiring health care providers vaccinated makes sense me.

The question becomes activities. Requiring people vaccinated attend indoors convention probably makes sense ... requiring people vaccinated enter outdoors park would probably make sense. Holy crap. doomed. that, getting fake card cheap. fake vaccine card cost $60 $150. spend kind money get real card FREE costs 2 tiny jabs arm. Desantis wants big pharm treat COVID rather use common sense prevent it. He‚Äôs promoting Regeneron writing laws preventing CDC recommended mask mandates.  Old people stubborn. years ingrained biases dug deepest recesses minds. Like saying goes ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt teach old dog new tricks‚Äù. knew going get bad, declared June stopped reporting?

Strange.

And didn‚Äôt contract 3,000 extra nurses like last year?

So wants people die.

And it‚Äôs Florida‚Äôs ‚Äúseason‚Äù isn‚Äôt best put play NPI‚Äôs season minimize impact? everyone south virginia starts august virginia northward starts september Iceland data?  Brainwashing. real thing. posted above, sorry posting documentary shows exactly even simple ER trauma nurse middle city hospital. 

You'd 1) large, concentrated population likely easy access vaccine. 

2) large number people going say, 3 4 hospitals, 10, 20 people millions vaccinated going head specific hospitals. 

3) even city, hospitals may well best specific region. Oklahoma City, example, may best bet entire 100 mile region. So, people need special care (Say, lung issues, need specialist, ect)

3) realize risk factors side effect (Diabetes, over/under weight, kind age related issue,) May well concentrated certain areas, says, say, Areas poor, densely populated, history pollution, high crime, ect) usually don't, think year. Georgia might better letting local school boards handle letting State agency. Remember Georgia famous letting current Governor State official charge election saw become Governor. 

My local school board elected require masks ( resident Georgia county ) suck. get clone town? towns? Everywhere? Go Well least Doug Jones (barely) beat pedophile 2017, that's something least! We‚Äôre see reckoning. vaccinated, have, say 10% risk, vaccinated too, 10% chance getting it, risk getting 1%!!

Your vaccination helps me, vaccination helps you.

For example, I'm going movies, theater admitted vaccinated people, would go. Why? Lifetime isn‚Äôt relevant insurance company/nationalized healthcare they‚Äôll pay less taxes die earlier. watch underestimate power brainwashing Americans understand dollar signs 3 things counted simple due human behavior. Nice try failed. Also FYI treat smokers differently comes insurance maybe least. 

Covid shot literally 15 minute thing.  said Florida place people ""move follow dreams""

Didn't know dying covid anyone's dream. agree stopping getting bad Florida? look numbers almost doubling every week. Eventually get they're generally nothing. Philly vaccination rate Broward county. mask mandate city help some. look started going south. charts look shifted time. ever considered accummulating money may best life goals? positivity rate Florida 19.3%, PA 6%. much better moment. Thank Goodness. Hoping stays way.  obvious choice would mask mandate and/or encouraging vaccinations know it‚Äôs ‚Äúcovid season‚Äù. get first shot. Free booster! Woot! article showing vaccines work extremely old. provide definition ""effective"" article showing vaccines effective? provide reference, would like use information convince people get vaccine. doesn't. simple Areas high transmission, coincide exactly areas low vaccinations.

Please explain immigration causing this. We've notable increase upper respiratory infections COVID pediatric population. Much higher July/August 2018 2019 (and 2020 count). hate religions ones America collecting tithing. collecting Fast Offerings, completely different funds hear lot Sharia Law coming America. Fox News right. busy people day age anything. People working 2 jobs taking care kids rarely time stay well informed what's going outside things immediately important them. okay polygamy, forced immigration. said Okay told could never marry good partner pay move foreign country two years, subsist ramen. I've given many friendship cause badgering friends family join church. I've given self every way, church callings, abstaining alcohol parties, cleaning church, even paying 10% income non-charitable causes, addition little actually feeding hungry. accepted believing without evidence virtue, long source leadership church, feelings differed, prayed enough, training body fight particular virus draw line. Glad still shreds sanity there. HQ scientology think average following  correct I‚Äôm wrong, haven‚Äôt lot people taken vaccine monoclonal antibodies point? almost like one thing add bad situation... lol go trying convince you. asked got numbers showed ya. Nothing that. I‚Äôm market- pay 20-30k less front facing roles. aren‚Äôt desired. point don‚Äôt believe cancel culture. I‚Äôm suspended license role that‚Äôs front facing people.

We closed northern border contain things. Nearly every nation has. uncontrolled traffic border, coming hot spots world problematic. Certainly people agree things true. confirm, although barely remember. insurance company deny claims force pay 100% medical bills Boston Herald staff injecting plutonium eyeballs, yet. Back 1871, recorded Journal Discourses, LDS prophet Brigham Young taught one major difference Mormonism popular christianity (particularly time) LDS church would clash contradict scientific fact. went say faith seeks truth, whatever form, whatever source. Truth truth.

Somewhere along way, message unlearned either tradition, misunderstanding doctrinal teaching.

The reason Mormons may vaccinate, wear masks reason christians faiths choose to: religious extremism ignorance. Yes lds missionaries get tons vaccines depending go. Many people see latest information vaccinated getting sick continuing spread even get sick (Israel), lose confidence current strategy. 

It seems clear masking vaccinations stop pandemic. (The delta variant originated India, swept vaccinated nations without consideration vaccination numbers nations) people see realize covid unstoppable part lives. Thankfully, particularly deadly, even particularly transmissible. 

It looks like moving direction common cold, means living fast-spreading low-mortality virus well future. good outcome, start talking continue within context. Stop clinging hope vaccine stop tracks. Look Israel. Think adjusting strategy. won‚Äôt pass free babysitting work, unless help it.  talk endgame critically important need live ability travel freely wear masks. need point life isn‚Äôt run covid anymore.

If choose wear mask never get plane again, that‚Äôs great works you. society whole needs game plan chaos. I've never said anything global warming. put words mouth. also moved goalpost eradication harm reduction. Vietnam China apparently excelled this. Good them.

NO SHIT due unvaccinated people. anyone bothering verify vaccination status coming in? Nope. people stickers travel restrictions, pushing vaccine status cards, problem looking way. goes show little actually care risk.

I agree second part. Millions people would disagree first part course longer around argue you.

It's definitely true people received full round current vaccinations much lower risk severe symptoms death, great reason get vaccinated. Unfortunately, 15% global population vaccinated far, course vaccinations limited lifespan fortunate enough get them. sounds like you‚Äôve literally never stepped foot inside LDS church.

That hospital employs 4000 people typically nurses make 30% hospital staff. That‚Äôs 1200 nurses. less 20 protesters nurses.

Just saying‚Ä¶. haven‚Äôt heard research-based answer, think one theory since rates RSV low 2020-2021 winter, available uninflected people, able transmit higher normal rates. Is/was wiping groceries necessary? got habit kinda part routine now. need?  Interesting article, little short. 

I like revisit professionals previously spoke note changes time tend find BBC's coverage US much better coverage UK.

The interesting thing Idara said perception pandemic changed moved acute care job vaccine clinics, shows much one person's individual circumstances change way view happening tough ""front line"". fat people.

Pandemic game simulations create coolest headlines Colbert County elementary school said Friday would send students home 10 days. district said school‚Äôs COVID policy required closure ‚Äúwhen one school‚Äôs population reaches 18% isolated positive COVID cases.‚Äù

Why 18%?  Yes hear time Good. Weed out. I'm disagreeing you, article complete BS opinion? Hopefully stays pretty minor al super protected post recovery! welcome. :)  Thank taking precaution. I've learned anything sub r/IdiotsInCars, everyone fear you. could local regulations people lose shit hear illegal immigration party rely getting majority vote win Thank getting vaccinated! May ask made decide go ahead now?  world many countries single digit vaccination % range, giving boosters absence good evidence provide strong benefit pretty questionable.  right. Hence difference time calculations. HIV notoriously non-transmissible (maybe 1 every 200 sexual encounters, estimates). suggest SARS-COV-2 around 60 years ago; instead suggest takes maybe 50-60 passages truly establish new host. 60 years HIV; 200 days SARS-COV-2. There's probably lag church leadership setting policies actual enforcement, feel that's hard problem solve see saying. Healthcare workers want vaccines first released PPE precautions worked nearly year, data asses risk newly released vaccines. 

The recent vaccination mandates make even less sense given CDC's recent explicit statements vaccinated people still catch spread COVID, blood clot risks documented, taken care patients adverse reactions vaccines. They're totally crazy, think rate risk catching severe case COVID higher. new variants reduced mask wear vaccinated people significantly increase risk catching COVID outside work. mean, already? delta variant breaks vaccination significantly higher rate, lambda variant currently wrecking parts South America seems make current vaccines useless. lambda variant already here, dominant delta infectious. [Maybe honestly? think China overtake largest piece Vax donation till year's end. 2 billions jabs load help countries need, mitigate virus, boosting immunization. That‚Äôs happens cult. drink poisoned koolaid die. #noregrets  No‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs see whether variant spreads escapes vaccines significantly Don‚Äôt think better safe sorry, like isreal? mean shit already giving immuno people. Doesn‚Äôt kind invalidate position? Buh bye, business healthcare pro covid. lie, clearly Delta variant path got F geography knows viable path. IDK man couple studies showing people exercise regularly much 60-80% less likely need intensive treatment hospitalized don't.

Yes lot random, healthy, eating well, sleeping well getting exercise give edge one unlucky bad reaction virus. special undergarments

Love Mormons 
They organized 
And plenty, plenty good paying jobs Utah.

Also really good quality swingers Clubs parties That's what's called antidotal evidence used make substantial point. Interestingly enough, DeSantis's opponent last election shortly lost election razor-thin margin. quite ""in bed dead girl"", rather bed two meth-addled men, one literal heart attack police arrived. high-quality options Florida voters have. Forgive lacking knowledge history, even mean? you? can‚Äôt tell interested would reading amazing church. Sorry, forgot wouldn‚Äôt matter since I‚Äôm big ole lesbian allowed. 


Do think it‚Äôs odd, since church clearly since *DAY ONE*, ‚Äúnews‚Äù? weird turn comments social media posts this, everyone board? TBM family others know well anti mask anti vaccine church already stance? vast majority Utah Mormons never followed directives, continued large gatherings throughout pandemic? shits giggles, church forefront anything? 

Trust tell don‚Äôt need respond, quite literally don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm eating popcorn watching cult implode. 

Read CES Letter. Look church‚Äôs financial holdings, really tithing. Let shelf break. got downvotes truth Unfortunately there's recall process Florida.

Hopefully, wake call voters Florida, voters start pushing sort recall process. Simply waiting around next election replace lousy governor working out. That's good old hypocrisy action. people go church listen Jesus commands love people would listen living prophets tell mask get vaccinated? ""THE FACT ALMOST MUTATIONS¬†arising within single infection never make wider world confers major evolutionary handicap virus. However, compensated total number infections large.""

And matters people person refuses wear mask, get vaccine, isolate supposed to. What‚Äôs risk sitting desk work? facts:
   - It‚Äôs huge cubicle plexiglass extending 8 feet high
   - desk u-shaped sides ‚Äúu‚Äù 5 feet
   - live ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù transmission area

I guess I‚Äôm asking person-to-person, easily Delta recirculates air. Precisely, apply certain knowledge, agree there. (the nurses article above) using intelligence comes knowledge understanding vaccines. Perhaps it‚Äôs lack knowledge intelligence then? 

That said, personally work amazing intelligent nurses/humans ever privilege knowing proud know vaccinated too. Sever exhaustion, horrible cough, bit convenes. Strangely fever bit breath.  text suggests Wisconsin 3 cases 2 deaths, Taiwan's death rate high compared Four Asian Tigers. mean...my mom denied liver transplant alcoholic died it. yeah, already see aspects this. It‚Äôs little bit different there‚Äôs tons different underlying causes certain things like diabetes obesity. unless someone medically can‚Äôt get vaccine, anti vaxxer idiots currently causing problem purely stupidity. would also argue alcoholism, addiction, obesity, etc require longer term treatment healthy choices overcome, simple needle stick literally takes 2 seconds. many insurance companies employers offer incentives losing weight quitting smoking. Maybe people consequences like higher insurance premiums denial lung transplants wouldn‚Äôt making stupid choices. desperately needed...but desperately needed worth putting patients, co workers, coworkers families etc risk. Sure close nurse, nurse would lead people dying ending hospital...especially health care workers, causing us even desperate health care workers. hiding truth get re-elected. They're trials 50 mcg 100 mcg boosters (original vaccine dose 100 mcg). Antibody titer data shows even 50 mcg providing 43x boost delta-neutralizing antibodies vs. 6-8 months ""full vaccination"", we'll wait trials complete get real-world data.  make mandatory, require vaccination records.

Fully vaccinated, middle breakthrough case Covid right now. able smell taste sucks. morning coffee hot bitter. Life meaningless. Hard underlying data. Heh. Grifters edition?

It‚Äôs grift want compensated fairly 11 years brutal secondary education go become doctor?

Strange position.

There‚Äôs one careerfield employed federal government, Air Traffic Controllers.

Those guys, unlike doctors, allowed unionize.

They net per hour primary care doctors.

They get vacation days, holidays, even special version retirement better federal employee.

None offered doctors would defacto employees federal government else offer services strict laws making illegal accept something Medicare encounter accept Medicare.

Furthermore M4A treats doctors given speciality same. doctor throughout, want primary care doctor, gets given encounter doctor gives 5 minutes sends way. there‚Äôs ability set ‚Äútop up‚Äù payments bridge gap.

It‚Äôs grift exploit physician labor way.  No, absolutely raise individual's rates rock climb. can't charge anyone behavior except smoking. *insurer* company sticks we're talking illegal. can't drop raise rates. Hey man, random person internet hoping stop drinking. probably know it. appreciate they‚Äôre trying it‚Ä¶but could maybe drop age 10? understand 5yo 12yo different size development, 10 12yo aren‚Äôt. bad news regarding drinking water bode well survival? start get sick days, still able spread prior that, there's selective pressure variant spread less.

This Plague, Inc. vaxxed? No, reason Provincetown outbreak well documented fact happened gay community learned lot AIDS epidemic take contact tracing seriously. done cooperated health officials even notified Lol, not. vaccine cancer. ED covid took cialis daily. Still ED covid cialis still works. embarrassed juice up.
Take 1mg every day helps low testosterone effects.  always amazed shitty people's risk assessment skills past months. get jab fraction fraction percentage hospitalized. statistically likely struck lightning.

People need get vaccine let go covid anxiety. Math proof feeling? well two get her. chances are, got someone else since probably vaccinated either. 

ppl need take shit seriously. become exact national crisis shut last year avoid. ""Two weeks flatten curve"" avoid overwhelming healthcare system. again? national leadership? Stadium Stampede III I've never seen anybody miss point hard entire life. Alright fine pedantic. 

Let's restart people keep taking snippets arguments arguing things agree with. 

FACT: young and/or fit greatly reduces likelihood severe covid death

FACT: young and/or fit totally eliminate risk severe covid death 

Can agree least? Yes, example, northern Italian health care system, rated among best world, overwhelmed early 2020. 2020

The UK neither lot countries. part kinda freaking out. make sense let voting base die. another plan we're seeing? talking friend yesterday claimed same.

It seems always thing people say ‚Äòflu‚Äô, wasn‚Äôt - heavy cold illness.

I‚Äôve flu life, horrendous - viral illness came within 10% bad felt. think that‚Äôs likely happening here, people never flu, catching COVID, comparing next worse viral illness. NH   Doctor, cant operate, man money. 


Quick, get man line credit stat. yes no. 

First paragraph nose. second one, short term it‚Äôs possible long term, viruses tend mutate towards higher transmissibility lower mortality, Bc makes better virus performance gene transfer. dead vector cannot spread. 

The article says much. question bad/how long get there. *&lt; 6 months old northeast you? get car accident

or mass shooting hurricane lands

they find much need worry peak 8000 currently 700, I'd say capacity more. Mississippian here:

I disagree governor put context taking stance...

""If vaccinated screwed....""

He believes delta version outbreak unvaccinated. 

He clearly smart. Yeah that‚Äôs true. it‚Äôs still better. lived korea bettet too. ""I'll take chances"" literally hear weekly unvaccinated. Source?  Andrew Pollard, led Oxford vaccine team, said clear Delta variant still infect people vaccinated, made herd immunity impossible reach, even Britain‚Äôs high uptake. really publicized more. could make biggest dent reducing number unvaccinated. Hell, witnessed madness live in-person. 

""My dad died hospital, died issues, Covid.""

""Nobody make wear mask. I've never even gotten sick before! ...well, have, *but*...""

""It's even bad! Except really fighting it. asthma, don't.""

Meanwhile idea coworkers underlying condition, yknow, big woop. Yes seriously needed hire best PR people available them. experts field would top it. much America behaving like asses almost day one, incredible see need immediately. Cities CT started rolling mask mandates. think larger cities cities surrounding implementing soon. governor want roll statewide mandate yet, table.

I also never stopped masking told 90+ year old mother law gets one week taken stores shopping. that, need stay home shopping things look little better.

Getting real tired anti-vax anti-mask crowd making life crap everybody. guys literally insane lmao remind tv Avenue 5. It‚Äôs set space scene people become convinced they‚Äôre actually space go airlock die.  guess variant ""outcalssed"" Delta. said, though, claim about.

The best thing avoid killed infection get infection first place. issue people saying parts health also important, people saying others stop getting vaccinated eat better stuff like that. There's amount eating healthy exercising prevent bad experience COVID, straight-up stupid get rid easy precautionary measures (like vaccination) focus diet. FDA already authorized boosters immunocompromised people tho? live Quebec. actually give surgical masks students every days make sure everyone adequate mask. spent whole school year person without class quarantined once. Masks work. ITT: ‚ÄúiT aLreADy BrOkEn‚Äù without concept means REALLY break. We‚Äôre rough time. hate north let south easy. paying now. know one woman who‚Äôs cycle little heavier became normal following month. 

I personally noticeable changes cycle neither women know exception one above. different vaccines too. 

I‚Äôve seen many posts changes. prepared could happen appears go back normal quickly. sad. Great point Well‚Ä¶. Ugh. Update one wants hear. Wife still exhausted weird cough, day 4. Today woke ‚Äúsinus infection like symptoms‚Äù. Super stuffy extreme light headache. fever. Scary think 3 shots may enough. good things head towards peak painful wave- Lambda variant, alerted potentially vaccine resistant, massive decline cases worldwide month. Trump ever held accountable lies? Morality political parties opposite sides spectrums.  don‚Äôt believe lying morally wrong would hold governor accountable? Thanks giggle! reddit though. real world think like this. Yes! P r e c h  want public school system fail donors use vouchers subsidize children's private school tuitions. 

If teachers poor kids die process, what's them? add: actually get flu shot twice- September early January/February. Generally seems last around 6 months, flu season mostly winter. you‚Äôre like wondered still got bad flus spring summer, help head since flu travels easily. game changing tbh. 70% full vaccinations?  Studies process flu/covid yearly boosters. people need realize US flu season speak 2020/21...because mask, distancing hand washing. Simple things helped limit spread flu covid. peoples refusal vaccinate, are. going away far various reasons. Even beat back country, always somewhere world covid alive thriving. can't shutdown international travel forever. think best keep low rumble background everyday life. I'm surprised law make illegal release cause death right now. daughter two weeks away 12th birthday. lied birthdate get shot. vaccines easily available. school vaccine event, took opportunity. 
 
Insurance rejected claim due mismatched birthday, pharmacist called, confessed, scolded us making paperwork him..... confirm would turned away told truth, regrets. Okay. I've looked news articles Israel right now, thousands new cases again, hundred severe cases fully vaccinated.

What freak going there? even cases vaccination? Good them. Personal freedom becoming harder find, especially today‚Äôs fucked world. hope nurses find stable jobs elsewhere. understand coming from, desire blame individuals call stupid also strong me. said, society large root cause issues driving pandemic, ease misinformation propagated massively contributed this. Furthermore, look sectors society highest rates infection (along lowest vaccination rates), clear socioeconomic relations. think culpable there? I‚Äôm saying natural immunity something that‚Äôs good it‚Äôs something pursue vaccination. pursue natural immunity lead mass death.

I‚Äôm simply saying natural immunity makes increasingly difficult variant spread. people level immunity population harder spread. doesn‚Äôt bode well long term survival dominant strains past sidelined Delta variant. 

Delta isn‚Äôt going dominant strain forever. tell don‚Äôt know talking about,

I‚Äôd like explain delta variant spread effectively population high level immunity natural infection vaccination  actually correct answer. Anti COVID vaccine protest? Oh my. Stay indoors everyone! soon wave peaks, he'll declare victory idiot supporters cheer like nothing ever happened. waited long, consult physician chances breakthroughs reduced heavily increasing rate vaccinations given population. vaccine 100% reason rarely see breakthroughs vaccines (the flu vaccine notwithstanding) many people taken vaccines. find Republicans care people dying work. I've internet since 90's... hell boingboing? lol richest nation human history


Not per capita No, think so? spend almost every waking hour here... care me? son RSV. close needing oxygen worst day. get room, hall. bananas. Probably, yes. know dengue, 80% cases asymptomatic. real problem blasting Lady Gaga Dua Lipa. Try St. Vincent, Leslie Feist, Soccer Mommy, Japanese Breakfast instead. /s +1 _Could_ fail 5-10 days? sounds like it‚Äôs already there?!? Non expert think depends symptom. vaccine clear remaining virus assume. vaccine can‚Äôt reverse lung scarring covid that. reverse brain damage like loss grey matter covid done that.   literally git links subreddits/mega threads videos globe different countries showing people dying bed, garden, corpses streets etc...

BUT hospitals KILLED THEM!!!

These people completely disconnected. mean‚Ä¶ NH bit outlier NE. Pretty sure close to, lowest vax rates region masks less prevalent, thanks ‚ÄúLive Free Die‚Äù crew.  earlier trying convince [no big  Morgues? I'm pretty sure every country world risked overloading healthcare system COVID.  f therei enough reasons take damn shot.  I‚Äôll clarify. chucklefucks anti-vax assholes clogging hospitals saved people didn‚Äôt trust prevent getting sick. want tent outside hospital filled Facebook meme scholars that‚Äôs treats them. 

Where Delta originated footnote, even that‚Äôs offensive others. I‚Äôm sorry, honest. half country willingly anti-vaccine, see future mutation. don‚Äôt think countries unable get vaccinated chucklefucks. 

I‚Äôm ranting assholes can, won‚Äôt, run doctors save them. came analogy covid seems work vaccine good idea.

So man gun says, ""you one hundred people going room. minutes, I'm going walk shoot 2 people random. Oh, good measure, I'm going pistol whip 10-15 others."" another person walks hall pass (the vaccine). would walk room take hall pass? 19% still really fucking high. think study time needed. Fatigue 2 months getting covid isn‚Äôt end world headache goes away time.

The real question 6 months year many still issues?

The loss smell also concerning hints brain impacts. I‚Äôd want know common one specifically is. I‚Äôm scared covid makes tired 2 months. scared impacts brain permanently scars lungs.

I really think society needs chill out, wear masks winter, work home can, allow spring studies come start lollapalooza telling everyone there‚Äôs risk vaccinated. wondering actual new evidence since pretty major thing information better, especially title specifically stating ""NEW studies,"" reading article study widely reported trending *3 months ago.* First all, isn‚Äôt. Derm 4 years post-graduate training IM, peds, family 3. Second all, Derm procedures specialty compensation higher. National leadership second time around, support states pushing vaccinations masks. I'm surprised pushing state leadership since become political thing now. Washington saying blame us, blame state. harder make political thing (most states one party) handled state.  wave pandemic ""but kid playing street front house hit car!  happen? ""

Everybody could vaccinated already.  feel bad immune suppressed people going get hit fault own. Type Google, Moderna posted phase 1 results months ago. dominant strains past sidelined Delta variant. present, variant proven devastating delta. something that's going ""fade away"" without rapid vaccination rates.

Also, idea mass transmissibility increasing immunity simply foolish. leads long-term symptoms comorbidities. tell know talking about, good day you. check stat is? number people currently hospital? Every dose exactly same, give multiple times. true vaccines. covid group POOL!!! Yeah, states like NJ NY necessarily create issues poor management (Cuomo's issues aside, resources much limited Desantis's hospitals states basically fucked anyone reacted). high death rates hit hard early, massive amounts Covid circulating lockdowns even. 

Florida high death rates currently give fuck Desantis(+ lawmakers) made hard local governments intervene anymore. different issue. country polarized, people taking side deadly virus. sad that? kind it. good getting vaccinated but. It‚Äôs need shut entirely right now. 4-6ish weeks immunity. I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll see one shoters get sick go hospital add fuel don‚Äôt bother vaccines fire. educated speculation:

Maybe moderna better, dosage actual mRNA much higher create adequate immune response people need higher dosage. I'm thinking elderly obese among groups, demographics would vary proportions regionally create different variations data depending outbreaks occurring geographically. waited long, added veins. did, that's / here. limit mutations because, random, mutations good bad virus, many bad kill virus mutation line's chance survival. 

SARS mutated existence. help worldwide public health efforts thwart spread.    *Nehehehehehehehehehehehe....* 
Peter Griffin, politician IRL. absolutely clueless going outside discriminating thoughts Sigh I'm done sub outside thread. got vaccine I'm trying live normalish life now. never really went festivals stuff prepandemic things like schools libraries open least gives sense normality hate thought much. cdc found approach wrong since US proper data make science based guidance. data Israel, UK, they‚Äôd found earlier vaxxed transmit wouldn‚Äôt ended mask mandate needed curb surge. reason see uptick Flu winter. People huddle indoors start breathing one another. south, it‚Äôs ‚Äúwinter‚Äù meaning it‚Äôs hot AF outside we‚Äôre indoors. 

Now, months, it‚Äôll cool we‚Äôll going outside disease less likely spread. Then, folks north seeking refuge indoors. Who's exploitation here? super close getting point. That's CNN &amp; BBC saying China - system break Delta . case count hundred-ish.  Wow basic primer mRNA might help.  replicate stay body all. cannot alter DNA. ""timer"" function. another case people manipulated things fully understand. Given circumstances, blame all. clearly better live place sanity science celebrated. Lol, dont believe Covid social distanced üòÇ limited vaccinated only. That's still great since something like 2% population get hospitalized general. Vaccinated not. Didn‚Äôt reveal racism, assuming talking exclusively black people?

Ouchie. viruses replicate people infected, whether that's breakthrough not. like that, get sick. also need replicate make viruses spread. real question need ask many breakthrough infections versus number people vaccinated. 

For unvaccinated people, that's 100%, every infection technically breakthrough immune system. vaccinated, much tougher immune system infallible behavior risky, even toughest immune system fail. can't expect go room full people infected covid hours without precautions catch it, eventually enough virus get body overwhelms immune system. implied assertion unvaccinated sufficiently well off, 401K (or finances). 

In rural FL county live in, 12+ least one jab percentage 37%. 63% age-related ability vaccinated done so. county 18.1% uninsured rate poverty rate 17.9%. roughly double national average. county alone, numbers similar three neighboring counties, rural.

People vaccination cost nothing, potentially save money, resisting jab. single possible chance would end without consequences everyone. Potato faced moon. looks like frat reject boofed many Ole Miss halftimes away Brett,squee, Chad, mascot  area live Illinois, alot people retire said taxes high. started come back live adult children. coming back Texas, Florida, Arizona, Carolina's. wearing mask, social distancing many vaccinated, count state technically counted home state. starting get sick go hospitals, local population vaccinated okay now, influxes older unvaccinated going start drive hospitalizations northern states Yes, unless compelling medical reason get vaccinated. Less 1/4 answered way, considering many types phds, makes sense quarter would uninformed unwilling research fields experts in. group answered way people highschool less education.  isn‚Äôt painful many people think ride out. didn‚Äôt say fun way go out, reduced oxygen doesn‚Äôt necessarily cause pain. It‚Äôs fucked I‚Äôm getting downvoted that‚Äôs literally paramedic said. sure shit better turn away anti vaxers first, beds fill up. people unvaccinated poor disabled, advocating discrimination owning republicans. nurses doctors make recommendations things, random people likely adequate standard living people looking breakthrough rates time delta prevalent, probably meaningful current experience.

However, suspect people problem statistic can't apply personal experience. Breakthrough infection rates highly situational, vary based things like person's underlying health, response vaccine, individual behavior, context live. dabears4hss shows, many reach erroneous conclusion statistic wrong simply match experience. statistic wrong, strongly correlated many people's reality. Unfortunately, given data that's available, really better stat report. Ahhh thanks comment. Yeah tried 5 months. It‚Äôs good way track changes sense I‚Äôm unconvinced would improve nerve damage. But, seems help people. I‚Äôve seen people using steroids anecdotal success. think it‚Äôs time time (hopefully) I‚Äôm (Ontario, Canada) ‚Äúwaterline‚Äù ICUs overwhelmed 350. Three hundred fifty population 14.5 million. earth population 14.5 million can‚Äôt take extra 350 people icu? don‚Äôt get it.

Covid really poked holes, hasn‚Äôt it. Covid actually protection Covid people got vaccines.

Isn't totally wrong? Sure, knew that. arguing predictions overblown covid big deal. predictions logistic growth accurate. predictions based monthly doubling rate hilariously poor. read comments need explanation FDA screwed authorizing vaccine kids back school. months study going fundamentally alter safety, going render vaccine pointless since kids catch delta time approved, short lock down. *checks google*

*total fully vaccinated 71.5% population*

28.5% population unvaccinated they're experiencing surge cases.

I wonder could be... parent two young children. feel you. smart buying N95's. vaccines masks work, direct impact reducing hospitalizations. That's hard understand, it?

Also, actual links studies peruse posts, something would aware truly care facts.  fucking god Governor wants go hell doesn‚Äôt want wait line  guarantee people ""mentally disabled"" getting vaccine. people intellectual disability particular rely lot face face interactions often comorbidities make high risk. 

they also mostly facebook reading covid 19 conspiracy theories, hanging families, going day programs people developmental disabilities, etc (and cases working), meaning generally recipients disinformation network convincing people get vaccinated. probably read article then. Republicans happy stoke anti-masking, anti-vaccine, anti-lockdown sentiment.

Because keeps national conversation ""maskers vs anti-maskers"" ""Maybe global pandemic shows individually paying healthcare???"" could simply increase insurance rates.

This something already taking place people smoke (well smoke get offered lower rates germany- outcome identical) I'm pediatric home health nurse. contemplating transitioning hospital getting BSN Covid hit. Now, make twice current salary staffing agency go near it. I'm vaccinated I'm low vaccination area low vaccination state Covid Kim banned schools making kids mask I'm afraid niece history lung problems tracheostomy 3.5 make parents idiots realize daughter one people keep dismissing dying preexisting conditions.  Obesity 100% controllable. last thing I‚Äôm willing attribute anti-vaxxers. Thanks sharing study, I'll read! assumption they'd Dems first already districts? see slippery slope argument lot relation republicans part already bottom trying pull everyone else whatever top slacken tighten rope one bit. moral high ground effective people respect half country not. That's true. teach Louisiana. New Orleans specifically. really strict teacher masks. insane. Lol even know students really looked like never let even remotely move mask noses anything. strict. teachers not. really depends. made point someone decided report Reddit like I‚Äôm risk self harm. I‚Äôm sure hit nonsense. Yeah, I've said far. hospital icu bed shortage nationally.

If kept pretending covid real, downplaying it, catch covid. Yes.

People know died covid, people actively trying stop us containing it. people live words receive medical care. according ""it's flu""  Remember Italy last year? That‚Äôs us now. 

A full hospital means room kinds patients (heart attacks, auto accidents). Doctors Italy forced decide covid patients got care not. fail acknowledge treating ""freeloaders"" entire purpose insurance otherwise collectively mitigating risk. people get back put in. Others pay get back nothing. That's design, freeloading. literally point. rationing care. doctors choose two people organ wait-list choose one likely survive, part complying follow-on care. similar, choose two patients get ICU bed, maybe choose one refused vaccine pandemic. course that's ration card, I'm saying turn away empty hospitals, wrong people comply turned away beds full people haven't, maybe STILL get vaccinated future variants. vaccinated grandparents everything ‚Äúright‚Äù terms taking precautions last year. live Alabama. go ER recently (a stroke fall) beds full. get in, they‚Äôre okay moment, really opened eyes bad things are. also made even angry people don‚Äôt take seriously. family friends got vaxxed soon could, wore masks indoors, etc somehow idiots don‚Äôt even care COVID seem steering wrong direction us. want deny anyone care, spouting sort provably false medical health information needs prison time you. felony lead people deaths way.  pretty much exclusively picturing white Mississippi town folk typing comment, yeah, totally racist, durrrrrr.

Asshat. ...is x-ray tech aware living? amount radiation he'll exposed reduced years, sure, still putting something hell lot worse body vaccine, mRNA not. mention throws consistency thing right window... Thank whoever reported Reddit like I‚Äôm going harm post. I‚Äôm stating logical conclusions someone feels need behave childishly. Politics. Hospitals required accept transports. may chose fall ratio staff. struggled transfer patients within Texas. transferred one Houston Utah. also know another transfer southeast Texas Colorado. beds.  computer algorithm says bed, doesn‚Äôt mean actually staffed. may try transfer patient available bed, get denied don‚Äôt respiratory therapist. There‚Äôs much ‚Äúbed‚Äù transfer patients. read linked study see end study reluctant change mind reluctant get vaccinated. ppl voting, change said. please get vaccinated well get lives back. One step closer Omega Variant Nothingtoseehere.gif Yes. stop though? 

Smokers? Drug users? stopped illness decade ago they‚Äôve smoked taken drugs since? long cut off? people extreme sports risky behaviour? 

Who decides every second counts? get information needed make decision? happens doctor makes ‚Äúwrong‚Äù decision it‚Äôs found person lied cigarette six months ago secret shouldn‚Äôt treated person someone else died? Like smallpox blankets, logos team colors. thanks. Keep jerseys, stay hell away. racism low expectations. Black people cant doctor, can‚Äôt get time get vaccine, etc. always excuse? Maybe attribute free competency individuals? point, turning vaccine choice one must commit to. Well, it‚Äôs asked America, yes. vaccinated, yes also. Facebook Fox News allowed exist?

Spreading lies bigotry conspiracies consequences? Sadly, said parts sub, pediatric ICU exactly 1:1 co-relation normal ICU due size staffing differences like hospitals kick adult give resources children.   fully vaccinated guy sick shit, yes awful, cannot fix stupid point anyone USA 18 vaccinated actively courting date Delta variant. Hell, buying flowers martini inviting right in. 

I would rather 40 year old antivax moron die hospice ward ICU bed turned someone civic duty got vaccinated. fault vs fault deductible paying car insurance, health insurance rich privileged person would say shit like this. Poor people often lack things like transportation internet even know there's free vaccine

Mental disability thing, tends make difficult educate free vaccines get them.

So basically, fine discriminating impoverished people poor shaming. attitude helpful nurses claim concerned about, actually unhelpful. don‚Äôt believe democracy, idiots need keep mouths shut.

The whole narrative health system ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù ICU beds full.

This misleading, less 10% capacity hospitals ICU. doesn‚Äôt make money like surgeries therapy, therefore build less it. Thanks, I'll try listen time, 40 minutes long :-) wish ASR published transcripts could keyword search through!

BTW Kentucky study odds reinfection, infection, think really relates directly 90% ability prevent infection, especially discussing odds/risk ratios people already natural immunity previously infected. he's using claim 90% efficacy, that's different saying covid naive person 90% efficacy, many reasons.  look main page website OP. neo-liberal, pro-austerity, Reagan fetishizing nightmare. fault vs fault deductible paying car insurance, health insurance want wear helmet?

IIRC, Florida, choose helmet carry insurance. cannot ride helmet insurance. ""...refuse social distance, acknowledge dangers covid-19,"" winner!

No, happiness here. hate two pandemics going time: covid-19 Plague Dumb. alright alright alright, we‚Äôve gotten laffs ED graphics BoingBoing.net  article, discussion board owned Liberty Fund inc, heavily biased.

It dangerous myths. Case Covid actually protection Covid people got vaccines.

This untrue. Survivors Covid level immunity, yes. 90 days 6 months. 

And natural immunity protect variants. WTF? forget went year vaccine, go ahead deem long haulers antivax? children can‚Äôt vaccinated yet? Fuck ‚Äòem, they‚Äôre antivax? Nuts. Logic ruins everything.  40% Americans obese. really want go punishment road medical bills? One Medicare 4 plz  said RSV previously? kids 4 (31 last week nationwide) getting hospitalized Covid according CDC. Time fuse Pfizer Moderna  Exactly. Elected officials yelling get vaccinated nothing. I‚Äôm already vaccinated. toddler doesn‚Äôt vaccine available yet. need another solution! SHIT. that's smart Americans figure  Humans also vastly overestimate ability manage mitigate nature. Next year states going using horse paste eye newt gingrich tea fight mystery contagion... photographed card immediately first shot I'd copy case someone steals car. (Florida businesses allowed ask, time ever use mine go Krispy Kreme free doughnut).

It's also wish national vaccine passport/proof system like NHS does. children can‚Äôt get vaccine, neither many immunocompromised people. unvaccinated driving pandemic, vaccinated still add fuel fire going back normal (we still spread virus). No, go end queue able vaccinated chose to. ""I assume talking place universal healthcare, like Canada""

The flair literally says USA breadstick King County surrounding counties. Correct. still leading category vaccine reluctancy, however. groups large majority reluctant vaccinated. got shivers imagined people sharing types stories years now. least back then, vaccine bit understandable. People need stop think generational impact actions families. parts state much lower vaccination rates.  kind paying attention.

the data regarding hospitalizations Israel (one thoroughly vaccinated countries world) would seem dispute fact. vaccines barely six months old information still emerging day day. 

the current data shows immunity waning quite quickly, concerning populations make *vast* majority hospitalizations deaths: elderly, obese, immunocompromised, otherwise chronically ill. people every reason operate assumption protection offered vaccination decreases quickly necessarily hold variants. obviously variation individuals enjoying robust immunity others. Start refusing idiots admission treatment ( unvaccinated) choice decision. Stop catering them. booster current version vaccine now. booster spefically developed delta variant. still going trials. America's healthcare system brutal nightmare long covid arrived, pandemic simply made harder ignore Can't say thought one, I'm betraying trust like :/ Dude, already pay everything, might well pay crap well. saw patient received bill 3m icu 3 months covid. Healthcare system USA broken run lobbiest. let get richer Nah, don‚Äôt need hypothetical slippery slope arguments. Let face consequences stances. isn‚Äôt 4D chess.

The Venn diagram antivaxxers selfish voters universal healthcare circle. Let enjoy desired outcomes. can't help think family also gotten anon threats? sad / infuriating - dark ages II flicker... Makes sense since Turkey combination Europe, Asia, Africa absolutely thing. Obesity contagious, matter personal health. Smoking, somewhat closer analogue, already results higher premiums. make anti-vaxxers pay too. functional shareholder health insurance companies. sick person hand...get fucked loser ... Omega, Nu, Gamma.

Badong. Covid badong.  Yep. I‚Äôm guilty thought well. remember it‚Äôll embolden insurance companies deny coverage heart issues someone 6lbs overweight something stupid evil like that. Yes yes yes ventilators?

/s disagree assertion people refuse vaccine don‚Äôt political views it.

I argue lack access less prevalent volumes misinformation there.

There literally campaigns everywhere begging people get vaccine, hours starting 6am going late night. One day we‚Äôll one name like coke cola can. like pokemon catch all, kill you. CVS wrote pen. Others Texas got sticker. would watch sizing/aspect ratio (fake ones kinda look like larger margin sides, weird card size well) maybe date card. reference, card back bottoms left 09/03/20 got shot March 2021. international maybe date DD/MM/YYYY. it‚Äôs date existent US standards (read MM/DD/YY) that‚Äôs red flag. 

Try PCP print records Florida SHOTS website. healthcare providers access (just like immtrac TX). would request due hipaa maybe hard convince show type proof without defaulting ‚Äúbut here‚Äôs official card.‚Äù changed? aware updates plan. Yes! Bill them. Don‚Äôt cover insurance end?

Delta variant entered chat‚Ä¶ literally happened little niece last night, basketball hoop fell face, requiring stitches. Unfortunately, ER turning away everyone Houston, resort urgent care facility morning.

To make matters worse, party boat nearby city flipped day, forcing Houston hospitals turn away even people, thanks party-goers refused accept we're living fucking pandemic. :| Nobody denying treatment. We‚Äôre talking access healthcare way desire vote for. extreme cost them. pay today? pays? 90 CEOs leading U.S. companies urged President Joe Biden accelerate donation vaccines Vietnam battles serious Covid-19 outbreak yet. 
In letter sent U.S. President, CEOs companies like Adidas, Coach, Gap, Hanesbrands, Nike, VF Amour emphasized Vietnam important economic supply chain partner U.S. 
 
According Vietnam Textile Apparel Association (Vitas), corporate honchos stressed U.S. best placed provide support needed keep supply chain going.

Vietnam ""is second largest supplier apparel, footwear, travel goods U.S. market. Further, Vietnam become major supplier crucial inputs America‚Äôs small important footwear manufacturing industry,"" letter says, adding 3 million U.S. workers connected - value chains - many millions Vietnam. 
 
""The health industry directly dependent health Vietnam‚Äôs industry."" 
 
The CEOs asked President Biden accelerate donation vaccines materials help keep Vietnam strong footing quickly recover, noting crisis employees Vietnam also crisis. 
 
On August 10, representatives Vitas Vietnam Leather, Footwear Handbag Association (Lefaso) meeting CEOs procure vaccines resume production. 
 
Vitas also hoped ""health"" supply chain Vietnam U.S. discussed upcoming trip Vice President Kamala Harris Vietnam later month, solutions protect supply chain implemented September. 
 
Last month, American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association (AAFA) requested U.S. Vietnamese governments speed distribution vaccines major suppliers Adidas, Gap, brands. 
 
The U.S. far given 5 million doses Moderna vaccines Vietnam glocal vaccine mechanism Covax. 
 
Vietnam far received 19 million doses Covid -19 vaccine deal VNVC, global vaccine access mechanism Covax, support countries. includes 11.5 million doses AstraZeneca vaccine, 12,000 doses Sputnik V, 746,000 doses Pfizer, 5 million doses Moderna, 1.5 million doses Sinopharm vaccine. 
 
Around 12.5 million country‚Äôs 96 million people got least one shot Covid-19 vaccine. 1.3 million people fully vaccinated two shots. felt similarly 32. Odds favor, big partier anymore‚Ä¶ still long life ahead pandemic ends.

In fact, traveled worked abroad much 2019 told girlfriend December ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going stay home 2020.‚Äù guess universe agreed. majority unvaccinated Republican. Charging would mild taste healthcare want. Might even change stop though?

Well, asking personal opinion would say stops get pandemic control hospitals longer danger overwhelmed. punishing people poor. OH ty bc variant country skipped str8 lambda assumed dangerous shit got real worse. He‚Äôs stupid - that‚Äôs scariest part. 

I don‚Äôt understand Republicans seeing majority people dying right party. Don‚Äôt want constituents live vote them? It‚Äôll interesting. 30-40% population (still 100m+ people) actively defying orders. much, much worse year since everything‚Äôs open people dead set proving point. really sick, would higher priority reproduction

There lots reports early menstruation vaccination, CDC review v-safe data see increased risk miscarriage vaccination - see preprint here: immune system - reproductive system signalling probably like ""if already pregnant, month good time it."" also stand cardiac care unit  start denying entry hospitals. white rural bumpkins aren‚Äôt underserved much make voluntary choice seek healthcare get vaccinated.  you, thanks support!  Ignoring irrational violent idiots, I'd moving family state going enough hospital beds.  kind reminds normal progression happens communism practice. 

It sounds great utopian theory practice communist regimes always end purges consider undesirables struggle sessions humiliate non-compliers force assimilation. Maybe not, many millennials moving southern states search affordable housing lower cost living i.e Austin, Nashville, Charlotte, etc Man said communities underserved turning vaccine...who else supposed be? I‚Äôm racist reading lines drew?  YOLO rated E Everyone. Also less forget demographics least NY show majority unvaccinated minorities poor‚Ä¶. Awesome!!!

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm sure work people I've worked declined flu vaccine much less covid extremely skeptical this, proof somewhere feel free share. like smart enough score 0% multiple choice test. Smokers pay bills (if pay higher insurance premiums).

The could done vaccines. regulated insurance premiums - shouldn‚Äôt situation people denied care.

I think lot antivaxxers would reconsider second tangible consequence like $10/mo premium increase. matter time now.

I really hope pointing EUA reason require vaccine stay consistent months now. That‚Äôs really country works. take care alcoholics liver disease, take care morbidly obese people complications like diabetes, we‚Äôll still stitch weren‚Äôt wearing seatbelt. things tax already over-worked health care system, don‚Äôt use healthcare punish people.

Seems like blog. sources? Err read article ? pretty much said public also says vaccine best option people going forward. also said makes aren‚Äôt needed vaccinated , CDC guideline sometime. 

He‚Äôs dick actually earlier get people take vaccine, bit least isn‚Äôt antivaxxer training operating room specialist requires 10 weeks Basic Combat Training 19 weeks Advanced Individual Training, includes on-the-job Individual Training: 19 weeks Fort Sam Houston, TX

I mean‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs better nothing‚Ä¶
But ICU absolutely fucked need rely bunch people 19 weeks medical training haven‚Äôt actually practiced recently Ugh. Sometimes ethical person really hard stick guns. Like, oppose death penalty. also think maybe administered Adolf Hitlers world? Sure. But‚Ä¶I know inconsistent thing believe know consistency fodder disagree I‚Äôm writing single-ruled paper dude, isn‚Äôt space lines except you‚Äôve apparently made it.

I don‚Äôt look racial issue, I‚Äôm sure do. Furthermore, comment makes assumption communities color - include many ethnicities besides ‚Äúblack‚Äù - experience economic injustice, ie ‚Äúbeing underserved‚Äù. true, Republican Party wouldn‚Äôt army impoverished misinformed White folk keep electing office. Many racial inequities prevalent society could actually addressed race-blind economic justice, many people cannot see forest trees, exactly corporate elite class intended. might consider wising up, present still seem caught influence. Important remember though least vaccinated race Black Americans. liberal think Black Lives Matter, whole idea gets much complicated  shortcut ‚ÄúSeattle area‚Äù say King County international subreddit, people little idea you‚Äôre talking about. numbers provided King County public health.      think virus infects kills indiscriminately ""help"" think there's way reasonable discussion. LOLs situation like this.

That's majority medical bills come from, lazy unhealthy.  much time reading polisci econ textbooks. Enough hypothetical slippery slope scare tactics. prize martyrdom, let people don‚Äôt want universal system don‚Äôt want take vaccine enjoy reality positions. Except people making arguments bad faith going matter what, trying pander makes everything worse. important make sure position logically consistent others hold, pandering ""how bad faith actors misuse this"" leads bad policy still taken advantage bad faith actors  never? always like bring universal healthcare typically doesn‚Äôt allow treatment denied.

Many support idea charging even denying treatment drug users, obese, smokers.

I even someone supporting free market capitalism, wanting forbid insurance companies denying coverage anyone pre-existing condition.  thinking well. differentiate two? Short forcing literally every single person answer questionnaire, sounds like logistical nightmare. doctors could write excuses medically can‚Äôt get vaxxed, would probably quickly turn business like doctors write oxy medical marijuana prescriptions.  Gross oversimplification. Definitely access issues legitimate hesitancy particularly historical perspective it‚Äôs universal. 
Counterpoint - took education access, medical professionals essentially universal vaccine coverage biggest proponents vaccines (because literally work place vaccines theoretically ‚Äúeducated‚Äù them) significant rates vaccine refusal although likely strongly dependent region, particularly US. example Houston Methodist fired hundred workers this. nurse hesitancy seems common problem seems little concerted effort dismiss:
Survey American Academy Family Practitioners hesitancy (at least initially): Kaiser survey found higher nurse hesitancy general population American Nurses foundation survey found 2/3 nurses wouldn‚Äôt take vaccine voluntarily (granted last fall obviously got still reads giant flashing red highly suspect hesitancy much higher rural Texas, based insane comments nurses can‚Äôt provide empirical evidence that. Perhaps would easier targeted mandates healthcare workers like Houston Methodist end day, important thing ensuring it‚Äôs safe take vulnerable family members doctor/hospital without risk picking Covid healthcare professional way happen insurance premiums. went date girl recently said wasn‚Äôt vaccinated (at end date) asked said covid death rate 0.02% flu higher mortality rate. told even true there‚Äôs collateral damage morbidity matters mortality. can‚Äôt get people it‚Äôs staggering. No, wrong. weighed risks made choice thought best kid. IMO, good choice; nothing magic happens 12th birthday. there's nothing ""every man themselves"" it. Every extra vaccinated person helps slow spread, plenty vaccines available anyone wants them. UK, smokers pay ¬£10 20 cig, pay plenty tax. There‚Äôs lot tax alcohol too, least contributing, arguably far non smoker rarely drinks alcohol.

Regarding sports injuries. assume reduction healthcare costs bought people fit health playing sports mitigates one injuries small percentage suffer highly infrequently, take holistic view.

Regarding weight related issues, that‚Äôs much tricky. Personally, see / mental health/self harm issues extent lot cases. Also, unlike smoking drinking alcohol, can‚Äôt go without food problem eating literally still survive, makes much harder control. It‚Äôs like drink alcohol (I know alcoholics reach stage stopping dangerous hope realise it‚Äôs thing as, ultimately, live without it) smoke cigarettes live. 

Anitvaxxers might come mental illness group too, supposed, way, way I‚Äôm referring overweight. That's works. Even there's volumes pf misinformation, mean people automatically accept it, negative view vaccines. 


Did read article? Poor people need transportation, time work, childcare, etc.    hope too. hope kiddo stays healthy happy! Remember...

You can't spell moron without Ron.  Marvel Heroes won‚Äôt it. need country music stars, Republican politicians, likes Jeff Foxworthy Larry Cable Guy promote vaccines masks.   Fwiw, extreme sports much cheaper risk factor old guy heart condition. really best treat unvaccinated status like smoking insurance companies charge higher rates. Figuring conditions qualify preexisting make vaccination untenable tractable problem doctors figure out, reason dismiss idea altogether.

The US' private insurance system many disadvantages. Let's actually make use one disadvsntages. Can‚Äôt find info delta specific booster developed. Link?  looking like global pandemic wont end 2023? Im startung lose hope saw 1918 pandemic similar covid ended 3 years Conservatives think anywhere pure capitalist society hellscape.

Bayern fan, burn jerseys everyone's safety lol  They‚Äôre asking sign account information asked for‚Ä¶. vast, vast majority ICU cases covid patients. covid wards tend quite small (we 4 beds covid ward local hospital, largest busiest ER metro area) even large healthcare systems, overcrowding happen quickly-- overnight, even. understanding people know work hospitals covid wards completely segregated rest ICU, maintain separate % capacity statistics ICU broadly. 4 covid patients coming could take ward 0% 100% capacity overnight.

summer ""trauma season."" ICU's tend overburdened accident victims time year. winter numbers flip ICU's traditionally fill flu pneumonia patients. Building codes pu55ies! really quite easy. families escaped Cuba, exactly bastion amazing. fearful anything communism, social programs America (pushed primarily democrats) scare them. Add republican bullshit talking points makes sense. Hang there. Sending love Michigan. Requiring pay medical bills way denying care. asked COVID treated different illness condition. insurer covers it, required pay deductible well whatever costs cover. insurer cover certain care, performed. Vaccination status part whatever equation determined. insurance company doesn‚Äôt cover ventilators unvaccinated adults medical conditions would prevent vaccination, insurance company absolutely pay it. doesn‚Äôt mean person cannot put ventilator, mean would pay pocket.  you‚Äôre favor universal health care, want give private health insurance companies power, think universal health care ever exist?? don‚Äôt think could hit Zulu variant Charlie Goldberg 2nd 3rd gen like tropical storm names? Cubans come communist state there's reason leave. easy convince democrats = socialism basically = communism.   It‚Äôs babe swear, it‚Äôs COVID.  magical example exist counteract post replying to?

There‚Äôs going lot brain drain based entities (companies, governments, schools) handled pandemic. May immediate, it‚Äôs coming patients based risk one small step away preexisting condition bullshit we've trying hard fight many years. 

Isn't charging people based risk like entire job actuary? I'm pretty sure insurance companies already that. That's February May, looking alpha delta. vaccine 90-94% alpha infection means 97-98% spreading alpha? Honestly thought higher. sure did. far, none family beyond stepdad recognizing died. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúGod called home‚Äù.  see every single day.

At point, accept sizable contingent country willingly want wrong believe Dr. Facebook actual information. Covid Season! Hahahahaha OMG Good question. Maybe expert answer that? comparable vaccination rate US experiencing surge issues? 

What misleading title R Delta among vaccinated people probably NOWHERE near 7. one person required pay hospital
Bills. single payer system.  Let also make fat people, smokers, drinkers, pregnant woman, kids fall brake arms, drug addicts, etc... pay medicals bills decision.

Edit: sorry saw tag USA people mentioned might actually pay medical bills. money too! Lol stupid hell. It‚Äôs common knowledge vaccinated folks spread virus equally non vaccinated. issue lies charge handling massive fuckup good news. Hey man, I‚Äôm you! said. little absolutely ZERO sympathy point. going post comments. couldn‚Äôt care less republicans would spin it. give unvaxxed sticker ID note insurance they‚Äôre vaxxed turn away hospitals like hospitals illnesses people have. respectfully disagree. It‚Äôs four months since general US population access vaccine. Delta already contagious is, even everybody vaccinated Day 1, would already late. Experts warning Lambda, already here, developed least vaccine resistance. It‚Äôs personal opinion really want eradicate shit we‚Äôre going hard closing borders(both Delta Lambda wouldn‚Äôt right this), possibly mandate vax(assuming still provides least benefit coming/future strains), enforce insane fucking lockdown many people country happy with. one two late game isn‚Äôt going cut it. 'some people skinny, once' - guy lol

ok bud simple. calculation estimated numbers. example:

---

*Patient one:*

10% likely survive hospital care.

30% likely survive hospital care.

**Average lives saved hospitalization:** 0.2

*Patient two:*

60% likely survive hospital care

100% likely survive hospital care.

**Average lives saved hospitalization:** 0.4

----
You would better treating patient two!  True it‚Äôs sad. recent study Texas claimed 70% seroprevalence current surge. UK 95% adults publish number under-18s. well! Eh, varies widely. lot transplant programs *do* accept alcoholics dried abstained alcohol set period time. 

Regardless, post denying care, paying care. wonder polio survivor imparts immunity. family survived still. That's American left racist.

oh, hiv/hep c.....yup stop paying high cost life saving drugs...

shoot, type 1 diabetics non-compliant get ketoacidosis end icu...yup, coverage you.....

ah, long list....so non-starter...not even sure even brought up....all dividing country worst GOP

&amp;#x200B;

fyi, anything look timeline delta surge time cdc recommended MASK vaccinated...well guess what, yeah, still get covid yes viral load likely less unvax mean can't spread it......hindsight always 20/20...so instead looking stupid CDC says mask areas high covid cases....

&amp;#x200B;

yes, protected, still man-up, mask up, wash up..if protected, need consider getting vaccinated... Moderna least expanded number kids study. let gather data quicker. Screenshots GISAID. dunno find unscientific GISAID?  mean stop paying bills people eat healthy obese...most reddit screwed.  Obese people necessarily. There's multitude reasons someone might overweight, ""being stupid"". Rest examples ya.

But time, (going along said too) think right stupid things lol. want partake dangerous sport üëç, assuming take reasonable safety measures can. There's difference dangerous things, dangerous things responsibly lol.

Literally logic idiots driving car, since statistically driving dangerous. (hopefully) many safety measure (seat belt, driving safe etc.) head spins one. Yeah. should.

I would also question recent promotion monoclonal antibody treatment. money invested treatments? Otherwise, promote something likely costly, hard obtain (especially full hospitals), something risks allergic reactions. he's opposed requiring proven, inexpensive preventative measure, even perfect, wearing masks schools. checked r/covidlonghaulers? Might direct place go question! problem prioritizing organ donors transplants?

We already that, people think fine.

Prioritizing vaccinated people care, enough capacity everyone, analogous totally defensible position, even disagree it. blame her. I'm working exit plan south myself. It‚Äôs vaccinated flooding hospitals ICUs. Biden much convince un-convincible get vaccinated. blame disaster lies squarely mostly Republican anti-vaxx movement.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs fire season.‚Äù saying US zero impact global politics got bridge sell you. received screenshots:

We‚Äôre past point hope anti-vaxxers make right choice own. need either carrots sticks both. want dying suffering stop. deal unintended consequences later. Hey now...what one question?

....Also Baylor Fort Worth covid patients vaccinated. children. Adults only. per nurse know.....

Crazy people...we cut kids. struggle requirement. insurance companies, bottom line. think legitimate reason always one's physician.

I could see instances person legitimate excuse, documented physician, insurance company denies want fork payments ICU stay. seems.most get vaccinated get covid regret it. think piling extra burden necessary. worse, families. happened blaming immigrants? things currently threatening overrun healthcare system.

When middle deadly pandemic, prioritizing people bare minimum absolutely makes sense. Great question. Interested seeing data. good amount family, included, got covid last summer. us vaccinated.  mean ... don‚Äôt. long don‚Äôt single payer system, paying based risk carry like anything else. immunocompromised going likely expensive insure ought pay higher premiums. going subsidize folks .... that‚Äôs universal health care extra steps middle men leeching it. Highly unvaxxed American counties roughly Iceland's population anywhere 10-30x amount Covid deaths. Yeah, way change peoples‚Äô mind *definitely* personally attacking them. classic Free Rider quandary economic theory. class ppl who're taking advantage market failures. Health care UNLIMITED. can't show hospital expect treated, tsunami covid cases shown, finite amount medical staff. Sure could hire extra 30%~40%, would double national health care costs. don‚Äôt agree unvaccinated covid go untreated.

I want unvaccinated covid go untreated. However, we're at/getting point simply enough medical care go around. think right vaccinated breakthrough infections go untreated unvaccinated used beds got sick first.

The longer goes on, feel like I'm getting punished following rules. Luckily gotten it, that's main plus, change much miss stuff longer do. speak doctor. he‚Äôs best equipped maneuver around risks. covid many pre existing conditions death sentence. vaccines not. know people covid, one died one sick since october one issues. people know vaccine reactions fever fatigue 2nd shot. wish best speak actual doctor. saw it! ultimately essentially semantics.

Continuing recent 1% week pace, 72% adults one shot. next week, hit 70% 12+ one dose. agree cases ppl impoverished disabled unvaccinated folks vaccine dangling stick refused grab it. it‚Äôs fair gotten vaccinated. Hmm. Interesting. downside obvious someone variants named gotten lot attention. Lambda 11th letter; possible easily read previously named variants order alphabet. easy quickly figure many named variants currently. Lauren Boebert acting profile somewhere? swear saw list w Q celebs true. unvaxxed, younger, healthy ~99% avoid hospitalization severe illness, however fully vaxxed contracted covid significant symptoms feeling pretty ill mean got benefit vaccine?  article updated August 10th 2021, unfortunately, clear information new/updated. I'll see find something up-to-date. like kind suggestion mostly serious. going happen, ever going happen, look inside probably already knew that. like people say ""Congress impose term limits (on themselves)"", ""We abolish IRS""; applause line. making analogous argument particularly useful. 

But sake anything else do, I'll indulge it. Organ donors...do know prioritize organ donors? someone gets list first, match, certain area. comparable. suggesting medical professionals disregard Hippocratic oath took prioritize care people vaccine cards them. 

I love anti-vaxxers holdouts either. way. never way it'll never way contrary manner medical professionals conduct themselves. realistically hit people hurts - paychecks. Higher insurance premiums unvaccinated right around corner. employer require vaccination, health plan goes expensive risk pool. People cave. wish would complete picture: ""we unable deal it""

so saying let people die? 

Because hospitals overwhelmed unvaccinated covid patients, right?

Could considered manslaughter part unvaccinated? Irresponsible behavior leading death another person...Why not?! typical boogeyman approach governing. Swear people sound bad anti-vaxxers point. tests get yet determine I'm suffering long COVID? may exposed work last year (was never given opportunity tested), feeling bit lately. America's healthcare system brutal nightmare long covid arrived,

Like said, some. hospital stats. count family practice visits specialist visits. shame uninsured people U.S., fairly good medical system behind cracks. Get everyone covered U.S. healthcare system looks much better.  think colder states going look like covid season flu/cold season hit time two months also middle school season also hundreds school districts mask requirements. hospitals children‚Äôs hospitals completely overflowing

Look Florida, Louisiana, Texas, etc. horror assume state next, pressure leaders act accordingly. appreciate extreme cases fabric society threatening pandemic. sorry. denying medical care car accident victims unvaxed covid patients kid can‚Äôt go fucking school unmasked/unvaxed kids unvaxed numbskull parents year. point reap fucking sew. say *Staffed beds, beds word, ""recommend"" contributing factor got us second wave. watching news report talking people get fewer discounts anti-vax (esp regards covid) primarily hurt poorer communities &amp; communities color.

Not ""not paying that"", simply get certain discounts. example, smoke - think already helps health life insurance? - pay little more. Similar engage least somewhat avoidable health issues.

It touch issues due addiction: tobacco, drugs, food, whatever, implied. also supply supporting evidence say hypothesis, could actually seen applied smoking etc. huge piece would liked least something like ""a 2018 study ...""; perhaps missed it. see happening though incredibly far-fetched issues reaching disadvantaged communities probably related, evidence currently supplied.

The question people rabidly pursuing, proselyting, dangerous behavior. includes limited anti-vax covid. anything refusing believe actually spreading info? I'm guessing real Gordian knot. still wish could something help healthcare professionals deal repercussions people ardent taking things seriously, happens afterwards.

 PICUs getting full, ineligible vaccination children dying covid. however getting care need overall. Lack staff RSV really complicating things.

None argument everyone ""hiding homes"" (or whatever latest bad faith anti-lockdown screed is). everyone, including vaccinated people, absolutely concerned covid infection might affect them. Nah, I'll keep unvaccinated bad reason getting bad right that's getting bad. everyone vaccinated health care system getting overloaded like is.

That's say agree run, that's separate issue. really bearing experiencing entirely preventable. confuse two, strong advocate public health care private health care. zoidberg.gif wanted bicep think needs veins!

I've got two kids elementary school, wife teaches School. harassed School Board caved allowed ""opt out"" masks. Well guess what, barely 10% opted out, many kids legitimate medical exemptions anyway, filled opt form case mistake made medical exemption one, easier. antimaskers small minority opinion this. live really conservative area too, still small number people.

Fortunately Governor put K-12 mask mandate place right School year started.   I'm struggling emotions towards them. agree, they're still neighbors. I've said posted things anger recently, want people die. scared death kids, happens there's emergency one available help? think that's crux it. Life unfair guess. injustice really bugs me. 

I think lot people are, understandably, expressing anger, pain, outrage, mention fear (and mental health, collectively, great right now)... feels completely control--but way people still choose stubborn. tried pleading begging article article ""I regret getting vaccinated"" damn, heavy. Starting?  one companies develop manufacture vaccine mean entire company.

Please rephrase statement. vaccine expired Alabama thrown instead could given less poorer countries need. 

Ignoring atrocious sentence structure, would really like understand two things: 

1. effective legal mechanism transfer property state federal government, federal government state department, finally third word nation less 6 months. myriad laws state level govern state property disposed prevent fraud difficult work orderly fashion. 

2. US Europe manufacturing capacity china India wrt pharmaceuticals decades. comparing export amount nations invalid metric case. million doses exported US Europe much significant million doses exported china (whom manufacturers much higher rate courtesy western investment outsourcing last decades). 

I know young person look cases like think simple give E, reality trying give something owned B C E expires. Logistics often downfall many good-will far fairest vaccine distribution, discriminate smaller countries.

I implore read history book. China things without ulterior motive. Go ahead take look actions west Africa last 20 years will, hopefully, understand. China generous less effective vaccine seek access resources third world countries future.

I'm frustrated antivaxers antimaskers anybody, worms really want open. 

Other big ones people usually say ""Yeah, fuck em!"" paying cancer treatment smokers, treating liver disease drinkers paying weight related problems heavy people. 

But end? paying sports injuries (American football players TBIs, example) people something known cause injuries? paying prenatal care accidental pregnancies people using birth control? paying emergency care people at-fault accidents? 

Hell, people family asthma we're currently blanketed smoke forest fire. They're taking precautions (staying indoors, wearing n95s P100s go outside), really go outside work run errands ended hospital asthma complications, would fault illness covered?

If give health care system cookie, they're going want glass milk. I‚Äôm sure missed get em vaccinate.  honestly makes sense triage standpoint anyways vaccinated person significantly likely survive. Vaccination gave extra 2 inches remove ""unvaccinated bad, blame everything"" lens filter time time. cannot solely look world/nation filter times. Nurses deserve much bigger pay. Prior covid stretched super thin. Prior covid issue/issue making. covid glaringly bad. 

We never treating hospital industry like food service industry. Nurses waiters, patients beds tables. administrators restaurant manager duty spends time office floor. Guess what- busy night every night many waiters short. weeds every night. help sight. Night night. Far many tables (patients) per server (nurse). Oh getting additional money though.

Hospitals realized (prior covid) serve many customers previously, pay less staff. Increase bottom line.  level care never acceptable patients' side, employee side amount nurse patient ratio. even higher demand nurses, losing droves put it. What's plan replace them? post about. 

So ask remove unvaccinated/covid lens moment - look something happening right eyes. obvious failure making nothing done address it. bit...Real world data shows almost 99% severe covid cases unvaccinated. Downplaying vaccine helping matters all. ‚ÄúWe right also medical patients freedom‚Äù. LOL. Health insurance, specialty care, transportation logistics... want in-network hospital, available ICU bed ventilator, willing accept patient (New Mexico full/near capacity), within range available transport personnel? makes sense American hospital administration sort way.  don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs point here, bud. really don‚Äôt know COVID doesn‚Äôt point, basically every symptom planet, go google symptoms things I‚Äôm always comes COVID somehow.

There long-term implications folks‚Ä¶we‚Äôre yet. large number unvaxxed US make good environment covid, new variants.

People forget exercise extreme (triathletes iron man types) actually bad health.  Yes, catching covid trying prevent, DYING HOSPITALIZED. infrastructure breaking community needs HELP. makes significantly less likely die hospitalized. 

Don't take mom's advice. Take doctor's advice. offense, lot nurses are... questionably qualified subscribe beliefs either unproven highly contested. mean they're bad people. bad nurses.

Possibly alleviated entirely third jab. People draw conclusions small datasets small countries like Isra√´l way quickly.

Saw Isra√´li doctor claim 95% hospitilizations vaccinated weeks ago. Turned utter bullocks. Seriously, give weeks/months. blame J&amp;J less US CDC. data I've seen virus tends come England, Israel, South Africa. US bothering collect release data. personal theory playing politics try encourage antivaxxers get vaccinated hiding anything bad vaccines. suspect policy makers working assumption people reasonable. However, we've seen past year so, there's enough irrational, unreasonable downright mean spirited people sensible policies going ignored. beyond scope CDC solve. 

More likely, we're watching another stage collapse happen right front us large segments country disregard science medicine. you‚Äôre still going him?

Thank clarification, indeed read wrong. Still lot high previously thought. NJ checking in. mask mandates schools, weeks ago people voluntarily started masks supermarkets like. different culture, people aren‚Äôt railing masks vaccines near level here. might make one cycle little off, effect temporary.

It makes proud really stupid shit. Campbell‚Äôs tomato soup  takes time virus get foothold enough exponential increase start. southern states lax countermeasures people indoors unmasked more. north starting see surge. think won‚Äôt drastic southern states still happen. disagree. make active choice trust vaccine, obviously trust medical science. Let skip vaccine, sign 'medical treatment waivers' allows hospitals treat them. Problem solved.  What's leading resistance there? US mostly political. aware that. Would highly appreciate link yo it. (i'm OP btw.). What's important vaccination still highly effective preventing hospitalisation, serious disease deaths. This. Canadians shat mention multiple posts. Got stuck asian country due family issues. french Chinese embassies vaccinating citizens here. Canada bought buying shit ton need, maybe help Canadians stuck abroad.  said foolish harmful. means kids longer-term anti-vaxxers doubly screwed.

And could also explain certain adults affected others + older generation hit hard. No. one pay pocket hospital bills. Period. Looooooooooooool think comparison works here.
Antivaxxers deny COVID-19 exists cannot get hospitalized it.

If pay themselves. Yeah numbers game. form higher premiums, maybe significantly higher premiums time being. willingly severely increasing odds serious medical event, rates reflect that. long conservatives keep forcing us stupid health care system, let lie bed making.  crazy though bunch people got didn't. whole family get either. Actually provider shot allowed bill insurance administration dose, dose itself. That‚Äôs probably want insurance info. Doesnt everyone pay hospital bills? certainly im vax‚Äôd newest data shows vaccinated people 70% less likely unvaccinated transmit virus. Vaccinated people 90% less likely become infected.

Either way moot point; doctors nurses would never this. satisfying would be, there's many people bad family situations circumstances might prevent someone. Part reason emotionally exhausting much empathy suffering even people awful things themselves.   wonder much people sneakily getting booster shots skewing vaccination numbers. imagine least little. Someone CNN estimated million people gotten covid boosters without recommended, I've seen means lied first shot. could million less vaccinated think. vaccine primes immune system fight virus magic cape invincibility.

The severity illness almost certainly massively reduced vaccinated instead hospitals getting overwhelmed lots people could saved ending dying vaccinated population get overwhelmed.

The vaccine saving lot lives.

The vaccine cause blood clots. 

A people go hospital blood clots receiving vaccine numbers inline number people would statistically expect going hospital blood clots.

Covid hand cause massive problems, cause lots blood clots, attacks heart, brain, testicles kidneys causes lots strokes, heart attacks kidney failures.    here. media still going Provincetown without proper context? can't believe irresponsible is.

The outbreak Bear Week, basically week long gay sex orgy. Men share bodily fluids several anonymous men time, course people going hire viral loads. representative normal life.

For unfamiliar, goes record, totally it. hate many articles point zero context.  cool news.

Sadly, means kids longer-term anti-vaxxers doubly screwed.   Providers allowed seek payment insurance administration shot want to, actual dose. Even though don‚Äôt get charged insurance does. every place think large pharmacy chains making attempts collect fee can. 

It‚Äôs understanding don‚Äôt insurance still give shot turn around try get administration fee federal government. Wasn‚Äôt similar study TDaP booster back? paid bimonthly headline would read ""$25 per pay"" Thanks laugh.     Except schools. mask mandate schools kids young vaccinated. No, article poorly worded doesn‚Äôt say anything paycheck frequency. however mention monthly insurance premium people spread 2 paychecks receive every month. Good know.. thanks.  Basically. Add list.

Anyone take seriously affect least require immediate family member die take seriously. 
Even then, many say something like ‚ÄúWho question god‚Äôs will? works mysterious ways.‚Äù real doctors busy trying save lives waste time debating people know anything compared real doctors.

And decision spoon fed watching debate. Read, everything need know make informed decision Texas hospital overwhelmed COVID-19 cases man shot six times waited week surgery

An American story one headline. Side effects Pfizer 2nd dose effect‚Ä¶..had chills 5-8am constantly on/off throughout day, fatigued AF day sleeping drinking Propel water

Gonna try get food now, hopefully it‚Äôs good tomorrow  vaccinated pre-existing medical condition. It‚Äôs life choice. Similar charge choose smoke. Again, that‚Äôs premiums, necessarily paycheck. people get paid twice monthly monthly premium spread two paychecks. They‚Äôre 2 different things. Yes, they'll forced triage, part triaging wasting time/resources unsaveable. Treating vaccinated person probably recover unvaccinated one much less likely to, line triage.

Where think need go step farther (but know can't) kicking unvaccinated bed someone vaccinated needs it. vaccinated died medical care favor someone even try need it.  think ‚Äúendgame‚Äù lot people means living virus‚Äîthe way live cold flu. obsessing case counts, hospitalization stats, deaths. futzing asymptomatic positive tests, constantly worrying spread. going crowded concert, working person people, without fear getting case maybe office shutting down. Offices, stores, movie theaters don‚Äôt shut cold flu case. think that‚Äôs people, included, mean endgame. yet delta wave, may spring/summer 2022. agree that‚Äôs hard see, since mask mandates back lot places, there‚Äôs still looming threat things cancelled. I‚Äôm trying live life normal possible, it‚Äôs hard. right here. Well, vegetables least, photo might imply.

You might healthy enough genetically thats roll dice.

You probably reduce likelihood needing medical intervention healthy enough let body job, smoking staying healthy weight range. multiple reasons lost 60lbs last year. sure it'll help covid I'm happy results. learned nothing? That's unfortunate Austin supposed progressive. I'm Projected move Florida next summer. Looks like I'll stuck clears feels like never... :-/ Good luck move though think saying even hit Delta peak yet, especially schools starting.  No, seem way far (and I'm relieved it). I'm talking lack mask-wearing going despite already known Delta wave coming, breakthrough cases reported. Sure, vax/test requirements, masking would've reduced risk packed crowds.  i've fan his, hope he's right time feeling, could feeling, whole lot better feel today. People act like mystery? Lol  üëã bye bye Yeah, Scott Gottlieb predicts last wave gives hope talked about, studied. Vaccine antibodies better blocking multiple variants virus, one body produced fight specific infection may specialized fight one variant. 
 
Also, mild case covid, immune system weaker, randomly, immune system might ""remember"" much covid finishes fighting off, leaving weaker resistance. vaccines, however, amount given everybody, get even immune response, strong resistance almost people get it. 
 
So yes, recovering mild covid could make fully immune rest life, might not, like getting vaccine might not. difference vaccine much better long term protection, involve contracting deadly illness could kill first. 
 
Here's article talks this, links studies .  think may related, sound like describing family. said then... Last line second hike unvaccinated employees' monthly insurance premiums. Right, forgot that. factors though? That‚Äôs big deal  possibility J&amp;J booster shot since viral vectors become ineffective doses?   i'll curious see indoor stadiums restrictions outdoor   literally stated article linked could handling error another corona virus. Nope, many differences adult children bodies, hence pediatricians.

I thought thing children, simple.  People ACTUALLY think this? Really??? references cite vax vax transmission? know it‚Äôs spreading unvaccinated people cases breakthrough illness, haven‚Äôt seen lot risks spread vaccinated populations. 

Before someone responds viral load information, it‚Äôs I‚Äôm asking. immunity. Getting covid mean can't get again. Look golfer going last round US Open May getting pulled positive test. recovered, tested negative, next big tournament, went Japan Olympics. Olympics tested positive AGAIN. much natural immunity. 3 months apart. evidence claim? Also Italy 2019. let‚Äôs hope CA votes recall. challenger already said he‚Äôll basically run florida/Texas playbook. syncs SIL, retired supervisor senior rn, said. First defend staff, also first acknowledge strengths weaknesses. occasionally, take one peg got full themselves.  Awesome scientific community comes widely accepted consensus, debate normally over. fact anyone asking debate problem itself. Yes! made poor decision.

I think made right choice get terminated, although one wonder would keep working put patients risk without ultimatum.

Regardless, poor decision, exceedingly reckless cavalier one. Nurses interact many immunocompromised patients, cannot get vaccinated. imagine patients contract COVID sure believe medicine, trained like doctors full medical knowledge.

Please infantilize nurses. Vaccines means infection control require MD level medical gap people misinformed.

At stage, people intentionally seeking misinformation reinforce prior views vaccines. Let's sugar coat stupid/crazy/whatever makes divide worse.

Frankly, I'm tired still pander people. collective patience vaccinated wearing thin. USA falling apart Brazil 25% fully vaccinated. number proper calculation VE. Even then, level high uptake countries like Spain, Portugal, Ireland Nordics.  Well, far week I‚Äôve heard governors Texas, Florida, Louisiana put calls hundreds thousands additional nurses medical staff, I‚Äôve probably missed some. exactly think they‚Äôre going find additional workers, hospitals country slammed 4th wave covid? reserves medical workers don‚Äôt exist. survive wave without much damage, remind people vaccination would prevented this, get vaccinated, profit?. seriously, last nationwide wave unless unvaxxed areas still dick around another winter  would agree. keep mind. directly blaming them. 100% blaming unauthorized immigrants either.

There even issues Texas early people around DFW would drive poor areas get shots there, instead people living areas.

In case, view numbers dashboards.

Beyond race, mostly people age 30 point. lot everywhere, ton people 30 think risk level low matter. Apparently empathy. No, owe apology, wrong assume say, make ass me. One never assume another's intentions are. fucking way wave bad winter. Unless it
Mutates. Honestly yeah. opening restrictions limited vaxxed people. Anyone least still required wear mask least. 
Once vaxx available ages probably lose things fully vaxxed people well. 
One silver lining rna vaccines comparatively easy produce future pandemics able make another vaccine. Excuse me, I‚Äôve read 100 Facebook posts week say otherwise. 

‚ÄúDo ur reeesurch‚Äù

/s obviously Yeah, looked last week, people late teens 20's also low vaccination rates last checked, probably pretty active. Many colleges employers requiring help, eventually K-12 Schools need well. require vaccinations. full FDA approval, excuse over, really good excuses point. knew thing wondered going stated. want know isn‚Äôt mentioned? Thanks link. good watch. People positions like live bubbles, honestly wouldn‚Äôt say have. 

In *ton* realms life, people really interact people already like them. prediction likely mine come true honestly know Rt NY 1 yet, quickly headed next two weeks, means we're seeing North Eastern places like NY right basically 'worst' far Delta concerned (it's essentially endemic us.)

Sure, greater vaccinated % makes difference. But, even NY, still less 60% populace vaccinated (vs FL 50%). way slice it, that's ton vulnerable people Delta showing us vaccinated, going find eventually. 

And I'm saying NYC going see April 2020 even Winter 2020 levels strain healthcare system (because vaccines). However, look occurred last year--south north movement epidemic what's occurring UK/Israel high levels infection despite higher level vaccination, region going escape infection surge. Epidemiologists admitted basically clueless virus ebbs flows geographically--akin people clue Black Plague spread Middle Ages. Perfectly healthy people sitting asses won‚Äôt get vaccinated. unemployment good thing now?

America nobody forced use toilet; choice. Yeah Im worried breakthrough cases. Im worried asshole anti-vaxxers virus eventually circumvent vaccine, bring us back square one causing endless cycle waiting new vaccine, people refuse get that, virus infecting enough people circumvent new one. Forcing us live eternity might well get mask surgically attached face. like care I‚Äôm flying US Germany week family memorial service. vaccinated also getting COVID PCR test prior flight, desire bring Delta COVID Germany. surprised Germany isn‚Äôt requiring negative test even vaccinated people. (The USA requiring it.). said - difficult getting COVID test scheduled USA. easy schedule test Germany return trip. 
FYI Germany requires medical masks, fabric masks. makes sense, well this, stock medical masks depriving hospitals them. Noone wants genes, qnuts brain damage may help understand them, though advise it.

Anti-vaxxers actually hypocritical bunch. They'll get vaccinated things kill them, others. twisted form choose story real life (and still somewhat does) UK, plenty developed nations. absolutely biased comment, countries actually managed keep pandemic check. Indonesia struggling islands. Oof, geezus christ...  Covid, recovered. caught second time months later one got him?

Sorry loss one could say rising exponentially? ly someone could warned people would happen Cherry picked? seriously questioning effectiveness vaccine? questioning NPI? Good health? Alright bro, got me. We're focked, lol. news referenced week ago sub.

Sorry, asking preventing asymptomatic *infection* (this could measured PCR good data might come places require weekly tests students/employees/etc -- I've seen studies measuring asymp infection). think thought asking likely asymptomatic person *spread*?

Oh see saying herd immunity. think though vaccines natural infection run hosts...assuming provide enough protection reinfection strain new one develop another surge. Exactly let's let republican party slowly kill betterment mankind.  every unvaccinated COVID patient treat, nurses get 10% bill checks. personally believe insurance companies pay covid related medical bills. I'm reminded insurance companies pay illnesses related obesity, smoking, even drug use. accept one things.  regular mask properly fitted right materials. Otherwise poorly fitted N95 performs better mask. N95s tend tighter fitted better anyways average due presence headbands help create tighter seal.  already this, though. want kidney transplant, better organ donor bottom list. agree more. also people getting boosters approval.

We know work. There's lots study data them

It's us take care ourselves. obesity diabetes (same thing, really) largely due 70's-era government nutrition advice turned downright dangerous average person. lifetime eating diet high sugar based cheap, ultra-refined carbs eventually make people obese hyperglycemic outright diabetic. seeing happen real time.

Hes vaccinated brings solace dont want panic go hospital necessary. high covid area hospital beds pretty much full COVID exist.


And did, can't stopped masks.


And could, that's big deal.


And is, that's fault. &lt;- here!

And did, deserved it. Everyone danger hospitals capacity treat people. vaccine protect us others reasons someone might need visit hospital. feel like make every effort, point vaccine shrug. 'Secured' delivered. Vaccine board advised AZ suitable 60s. get sign waiver instill much confidence.

I got TDaP booster.  Insurance companies really reason cover anything want cover they're company government service provided taxes. reason insurance companies insidious concept healthcare system. 'company' says wants rate lifestyle choice onus find different company *'pretend free market endless choices'* shop better service. free market libertarian capitalist would say free market create company fits want there's reason company agree practice closing niche market one exist. That's also ignoring Americans can't afford health insurance connected workplace. rarely choice get make coverage get company want pay it. 
Having said ever got M4A (which happen lifetime years ago) proposal could also open door government exceptions coverage based lifestyle habits, fought tooth nail taxpayers paying services. Obese people required pay diabetes amputations, pregnant women required pay pregnancy choice, cancer treatment paying outright even single thing lifestyle could connected type cancer have, etc. allowed HYPOTHETICAL, MAGICAL FUTURE universal healthcare covered taxes like normal nation reason require people pay fire departments pocket fireplaces home even already pay taxes fire departments. pay system taxes get benefit government services. Unfortunately, I've found often people rarely see loopholes logic would hurt future hypotheticals. I'm firmly pro covid vaccination, got vaccinated soon literally possible, I'm also firmly idea insurance companies power us currently hypothetical universal healthcare system limit government's ability, extreme, punishing people lifestyle choices. case patients purposely choosing ignore medical advice, interventions, means improving situation, still receiving expensive medical care.

It‚Äôs certainly grey area, currently almost nothing hold people financially accountable healthcare choices behaviors.

We shouldn‚Äôt deny medical care, that‚Äôs different argument putting fiscal onus greater costs avoidable, preventable, purposely-exacerbated conditions. unvaccinated largely category already. We‚Äôre talking primarily poor uneducated people minorities. choose case sure, whatever.  nothing wrong ""mindset""...

Did read OP's title? says ""ominous South"". 

You unable stay point regardless ""engineering degree""... three. born raised Atlanta. 

So... point simply full shit like rest idiot fucks ""the south"". (&lt;- rhetorical, case get that). baffled selfishness mindsets here, even falling ill. It‚Äôs me, me, me, family, family, family, nothing thinking people community. ‚Äúwaiting see vaccine affected people.‚Äù douche canoes. They‚Äôre happy use hospital resources hits them. attacked post, can't comprehend basic information several people telling you, still blatantly bad faith it. 

What plan? ideas, say everything? 

I'm going call troll one time: see, come guns blazing, asking stupid questions (and ignoring answers), people assume much you. whole point trolling yo ***trick people*** giving damn say -- give advertise bullshitting.  Hell yeah! us done part still mask worry risk kids ignorant selfish fucks. Yup, smell training essential oils. shoot sell them, done.  case patients purposely choosing ignore medical advice, interventions, means improving situation, still receiving expensive medical care. 

It‚Äôs certainly grey area, currently almost nothing hold people financially accountable choices behaviors.

We shouldn‚Äôt deny medical care, that‚Äôs different argument putting fiscal onus greater costs avoidable, preventable, purposely-exacerbated conditions. Hygiene hypothesis flawed. immune system isn‚Äôt muscle - it‚Äôs use lose it. best way able combat almost infection eat right, exercise, get good sleep. That‚Äôs it. paper published noted far, appear covid recombinant. 

So article correct, that‚Äôd bad news theory us all. Must cancer surgical deaths too. sit hospitals. Ffs...  Shit, you‚Äôre right. attacked woman water bottle  Yes pass IQ test legit medical reason vaccinated (GB, MS, etc.) begs inevitable question idiot overheard ... ""So catch 100% staying home taking spot hospital, right?""

I wonder person integrity stand principles life line. Several colored arm bands (presumably differentiate since history hurting one another) metal water bottles swinging. pay it
That said, I‚Äôm letting hospital opted vaccine think vaccinated people angry, it‚Äôs understandable anger. everyone gotten shots, did, *could be* 2019 countries availability wasn‚Äôt obstacle. enough people didn‚Äôt they‚Äôre filling hospitals again, we‚Äôre stuck mitigation stuff supposed buy time vaccine ready.

It‚Äôs high school group projects again. people work ones riding backs. course there‚Äôs anger. 

But still shouldn‚Äôt let insurance companies open door.  count differently no, doesn‚Äôt start conception.  Dr Griffin discusses clinical update, need listen that, he's using multiple sources compare two groups, relies heavily cdc data again, listen clinical update Week Virology week, understand process, found -  still something like 40k yearly second hand smoking deaths year US. people choosing unvaccinated thrown directly trash show hospital seeking medical care. Bill standard price trash disposal.  tried smell training? I've heard lot good things it. Would interesting see courts side with. imagine legality largely irrelevant someone sues wins. one thinks profoundly stupid lab dedicated studying infectious diseases smack middle densely populated area? labs incredibly remote areas, preferably underground. thing estimated 3 million people died there. vaccine US people rather die get vaccinated. Doesn‚Äôt seem like much slope. Getting vaccinated illness expected cover costs illness pretty logical standard. long standard exemptions made, what‚Äôs issue? Don‚Äôt like it? See insurance pays get crash influence burn house smoking bed despite saying don‚Äôt smoke. Yeah, takes sometimes. Glad you‚Äôre feeling better otherwise!  Thats ton people got infected state fair. Brought isolated folks together people Covid boom. could always try med school service example USUHS. No, aren‚Äôt sitting asses, drastic shortage primary care doctors m4a makes worse planned pay decrease. 

Your step dad quick surge IM roots great (a primary care speciality), specialities can‚Äôt shift role. high viral load vaccinated people mean covid replicates vaccinated people, right?  Fromunda cheese eh No, shouldn't. help idiots, even they're idiots. 

If going road, give heads time people vax make big , public deal costs put get vaxxed deadline. think we‚Äôre shutting there‚Äôs real way prevent hospitalizations, that‚Äôs vaccines. really shut everything, people jobs, go back stimulus/extra unemployment hoopla there‚Äôs much easier cheaper way get hospitalizations down? waiting ""i hate dick anyways, right dick function even less previously. actually ive always wanted. still wont wear mask."" coming soon youtube showing dude getting grocery store.     Good explanation. I'd like add APRNs also doctorates. believe nurse anesthesiologists moving towards programs doctoral.

And there's additional wrinkle non-nursing, nurse adjacent professionals like physician's assistants.   That's feeling 100%. blows mind people schedule vacations Florida summer. place avoided late May end hurricane season. went local farmers market OK people signs turning OK Portland Portland post apocalyptic mess (with crazy pics cartoons). first thought joking no, serious. barely mobile old people likely never left state lives getting kinds love.

You tell people crazy story like long blame Democrats claim love Trump. believe anything. got link that? believe want read it. I've got two small unvaccinated kids suspect policy makers working assumption people reasonable.  

Well that's terrible idea   don‚Äôt think ‚Äúmaking virus‚Äù, probably accidental spillover infected bat analyzed. think hospitals scared liability issues. one wants open lawsuits freely admitting conditions hospitals unsafe. I‚Äôve seen rural EMS struggling even transport patients. tied wall transfers take 2 Liz hours one way. 

It‚Äôs obvious people charge idea healthcare system works. evidence true, push yhe front, absolutely catch idiots. 100% go get vaxxed secret, friends, that's good enough us Parents also vote, tho see. Seems rather vague say Seattle area going touch points, last one: think specialists sitting around asses? Nah dude, they‚Äôre treating patients too.

Source: interventional cardiologists stepfather daily covid rounds Arizona last June July. would better spelled correctly, maybe better donno starting look like covid thins herd shit DNA actively, also helps ensure slower re-growth idiots. Maybe bad. pay insurance. aren‚Äôt denied care given lower priority it. First study covid reducing IQ, study erectile dysfunction. 

I guess I'm gonna fucked lots good reasons this, stated others. 

I think announce COVID vaccine longer free adults starting future-but-near date. Perceived value scarcity affect consumers make decisions. I‚Äôd love see study would play unvaccinated. killed trying get anti masker mask up.

Christ waste life, that's fucking sad Got covid week ago. I'm feeling better now, loss smell long-term? taste almost back, sense smell weak Reddit hard time this. prevailing opinion began masking altruistic act protect everyone affirm sanctity lives. vaccinating became act love protect vulnerable. vaxed passport return 2019, became inalienable right so. calls leaving unvaccinated die streets, laughing unvaccinated people die, mocking deaths. makes wonder good intentions beginning weren‚Äôt empty platitudes meant manipulate people serving selfish agenda. Yes, I‚Äôm vaccinated, I‚Äôm suddenly ready feed unvaccinated wolves. Even though they‚Äôre foolish stubborn, they‚Äôre still neighbors.  governor, (Louisiana) otherwise good job COVID response, asked Friday reconciled fact less regarding closures even though surge way worse. basically said mandated masks. One doctors spoke basically said masks sufficient. shocked bc bad right here. bad. Idk push school back temporarily. 

Please feel free join emailing Pzfizer, Moderna, FDA, president, HHS. many people community protecting kids 12 masking vaccinating. Schools opening, hospitals filling up. need EUA children 12!!! Additional reminder: triage denying medical care FAQ. 

R E cared cautious, would get vaccinated. excuses. 

I still think troll game bit weak, tho  thing basically happened SA variant. Deadly variant spread well came along time contagious variant rising. always thought could focus one person 
 wing nut protests investigate would find lie  
that lives. thought going happen maybe 
 wouldnt mouths open. resources  
would detectives scoping people out. What's scary amount tourism still taking place FL throughout this, whether, fall, winter, Spring usually busier tourism seasons. So, tons people spreading around go FL. Anyone 18+ dying disease USA choice, exception tiny, tiny number fully vaccinated people breakthrough infections fatal (&lt;1600 last check CDC website, vast majority people 65 pre-existing conditions). Okay okay, next question, unhealthy intoxicated body uninhabitable covid? It‚Äôs think ‚Äúresearch‚Äù better research actual doctors. 

It‚Äôs negate findings WHO, CDC, actual infectious disease doctors, epidemiologists. 

it‚Äôs think know studies involving thousands participants vaccine. 

It‚Äôs think vaccine given millions people , eventually billions, bad you. Everyone I've known who's covid said that's far away worst part. 

They've gotten back fairly quickly I've heard folks lose months months. would SUCK. would reported doctor. Sometimes comments unacceptable/rude/uncalled for. problem booster shot vaccinated persons arm one less unvaccinated. CDC doesn‚Äôt want rush vaccinated people drying vaccine supplies.    Anecdotal mine came little bit early. I‚Äôm usually quite regular. However, it‚Äôs impossible say due vaccine factors. Lol, like watching old black &amp; white movie doctor trying cure lung cancer patient, they're smoking inside hospital. patently untrue. remember exactly heavily downvoted, deleted, comment replied said, basically paraphrased quote. looking wrong study. pilot looking whether virus physically present tissue penis patients previously contracted COVID also severe ED. (The samples patients coming prostheses similar treatment) fact patients tested levels involved suggest warrants study.

The one used graph 100 participants: 25 COVID positive 75 negative. (Which still small but, result size, statistically solid)

There two studies referenced article well, showing results. That's makes news residents understand value vaccine. say they‚Äôre annoyed mean they‚Äôre thinking they‚Äôre already safe mingle. Protonmail course it‚Äôs good thing. work medical field don‚Äôt see value vaccinated patients, they‚Äôre exactly highly skilled intelligent individuals they? They‚Äôre part problem, solution. 

If can‚Äôt trusted something simple getting vaccinated pandemic, can‚Äôt assess relative risks involved, earth trusted correctly administer right dose medicine dress wound properly? brilliant way weed job. 

I suspect nurses like picture, mistakes poor care drop. funny sort way, they‚Äôre great thing patients removing patient care. ludicrous risk comes plaid risk. first person know get covid obese roommate worked essential worker. described bad flu mentioned persisting issues. I'd say mine mild problems (though diminishing time) ever since.

However, athletic friends said flu overweight aunt died it. kind amazing differences experience. They're next Arizona. reminds graphic smoking warning label used packs showing limp cigarette warning: Cigarettes Cause Impotence! thought smart would maybe one bigger deterrents men stop smoking. Look, I‚Äôm fully vaxxed, trying provide good information, absolutely exhausted bad faith arguments I‚Äôm going bed. chance haven‚Äôt already completely made mind read otherwise goodbye good Yeah, anti-vax campaign started ago ""autism advocacy"" groups headed doctor whose study retracted providing false info, pockets anti-vax religious organizations, minorities medically abused large scales (like Tuskegee syphilis studies), fear-mongering. people feel formerly abused groups.

Ironically, vaccines good we've forgotten horrors diseases like polio, diptheria, deadly common causes death pre-vaccines. diseases start making rounds herd immunity breached many anti-vaxxers see people get scared pro-vaccine again. they're stubborn. I'm flashing back years ago measles outbreak Disneyland unvaccinated kids.  50% decease much bigger decrease making be. that...the CDC telling people vaccinated longer wear mask checks it. unvaccinated people ripped mask became free all. mandates vaccinations, employer checking vaccine cards, nothing. 

My employer day said vaccinated people wear masks, everyone threw away mask like Covid lifted restrictions. problem method finding breakthrough rate - studies see tend take vaccines figure many breakthroughs happened. issue vaccines around lot longer breakthrough cases it‚Äôs really skewed number.

Still, vaccines work prevent serious illness. I‚Äôm denying value. Insurance? live? shot free US. insurance involved getting shot like! know Australia donated 2.5M AZ Indonesia 500K Fiji Papua well. getting vaccine reduce symptoms ?"
