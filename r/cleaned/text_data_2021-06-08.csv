0,2021-06-08," put great show. Rock on! ought form public exchange vaccine data. anyone still listening guy? 

But get vaccinated consider removing testing req vax? Seems huge waste resources now. also dont know long term effects virus. better immune hope doesnt cause damage later. know American’s don’t take Covid seriously? Many do. Canadians like characterize America hard right trump group, truth America much bigger diverse that. Canadians like define North Americans aren’t States. truth opportunity, land, better weather, diversity United States. Strange seems, find Canadians patriotic liberal Americans. disguise “ha ha ha hur hur aren’t stupid Americans!” guess Canadians instill patriotism country bit negativity US, otherwise many Canadians would move south. short, many, many Americans care deeply reducing spread Covid.  We're going know yet. Immunity vaccine wane people vaccinated still risk. still ruled booster specific reason. people assume can't transmit virus they've vaccinated little naive best little disingenuous worst.   I'm sure figure dosing. Scalping bad pre pandemic concerts, spread everything! It’s day made Reddit account, like IRL birthday, give cake apologize them?  Risk infection reduced 90%. Even get infected unlikely spread virus *anyone* due reduced viral load. CDC says mask, distancing vaccinated people. quarantine travel known exposure. vaccine works. Hey asshole, good bad people everywhere grow fuck up.  defense Foo Fighters isn’t unlimited supply talented black music steal claim own.

Also Rolling Stones haven’t good created anything interest past 25 years so...  don’t get vaccinated? protected. don’t get Housing prices everywhere man. I’m Northeast corner (kingdom!) several Amish families moved here, purchasing old farms really thriving. Brings much needed relief economy. NYC turds stay fuck away please. parents vaccinated dude, call Dayton rural. Check reading comprehension try clap back. Lol remember coronavirus causes Covid disease product human activity. say that, humans putting animals together tight spaces would otherwise connected, probably wouldn’t dealing coronavirus. 

I get idea returning natural state, live different world. Everything eat cultivated engineered. paleo want, stuff fine tuned centuries centuries cultivation humans. think it’s worthwhile rethink “natural” actually means.  likely allowed WeChat access location, Suikang Code applet could use WeChat get geodata. maybe park incorrectly registered Liwan district recorded Liwan district scanned code enter. Alpha, British one. Even Little Rock Arkansas roof. Pandemics aren’t really normal. Seriously… I’d pull kids virtual school first thing tomorrow rush get jab. 
Damn hope somehow makes time new school year. 
Doubtful, I’ll keep hope something changes. find concerning UK almost identical 2 dose vax percentage US, cases rising like another wave coming, dropping like rocks. Like everything past year, we'll wait see something really gotta worry about, odd anomaly.

Shoulda said 'fully vaxed' believe UK one dose vaccinations. Makes wonder bigger percentage people one dose might influencing variable.  Legit Desantis idiot. places could require vaccine passports Florida get away it. People would shun sue oblivion. It’s unnecessary law served fuck cruise industry. kid less 2 years old got entire cousins family sick. stupid virus going end already...  took blood-clotting vaccine, lmao. 4 per million people Pfizer 5 per million AstraZeneca. much higher chance getting blood clot sitting around campfire.  fount ... something. Luckily stupidity replicate fast CoVid can… pandemic refugees caused housing prices fucking skyrocket

Is place country case? Even sunbelt fucked. need expert figure one out. many dumb people. vaccines, want get them.

I think anyone beg someone get vaccine. Facebook? Ew. spite risks, would still prefer live virus vaccine since would provide natural immune response. would argue unknown risks taking vaccine attempts induce immune response unnatural way.

The vaccines 1976 Swine Flu rushed production. Sound familiar?    It’s pure disinformation trying marr vaccines goal.

Well thank heavens bullshitters Reddit like who've spent years internet bullshitting tell us ""truth"" protect us ""deceitful lies"" actual experts spent years research study opinions hold actual value. fun see Vermont news much good way last years. Bernie ran, think country probably thought us cold maybe part Canada. we're known cold, actually part US name sentiment, filled craaaaazy socialists, CRUSHING COVID!

Pearl Harbour reason America entered, public support war like 40% SEC filing dated July 23, 2020. various news sources, deal surely finalize time. However, according sources, Fosun-BNT deal done least May, 2021.

As “ongoing” discussion, think BNT means supplying Taiwan via Fosun, Taiwan refuses due political considerations. can't convince people. shit show? can't even tell anymore. rhetoric surrounding virus frustrating deal with. feel like Reddit two extremes: pro-restrictions anti-restrictions, much room nuanced positions. Christ

Sounds like needs shitcanned blacklisted ever working medical field again.  | India almost one vaccinated

Honestly, that's thought initially well. look vaccine data, lot healthcare frontline workers vaccinated time second wave got control. Given India's sheer size, say that's bad.

Looking now, given variant contagious India gotten relaxed beating first wave, India doomed start. large population density, nearly impossible contain spread virus. extended 30 days based new scientific data. wave arms decide they'll change expiration date.

The Serum Institute India extended *3 months*. Why? data allowed it. checked stability sterility made sound recommendation. 2019. Best vacation ever!!!! Much less likely get severe covid much likely tell never asked 2nd shots moving pretty quick Canada. Civilization = denying basic humanity?  Maybe driving 17 hours plus safe. deregulating stupid stuff idk see mandating limits drive time good everyone. thank scientists vaccines Desantis loser That’s put space suit negative tests kinda assume some_where_else troll actually doesn’t want form lockdown/restrictions. statement “This taking virus seriously looks like” definitely scare mongering. 

A form rhetoric intended make people think taking virus seriously suckers game, need lose humanity order “take coronavirus seriously”. he’s troll, stop commenting like would clearly opposite effect intended. lol I'm sure person thinks majority people around always right one who's fool dropped this: /s why? I'm sure they're better financially countries. economy wide open since time last year, exception short lockdowns. also get tourists Australia.  little bit both. 120 miles, closer 70. assume math using 60 mph average speed? going hit 60 Tennessee mountain roads longer seconds.

The CDC done enough damage credibility  last year; least get right salvage bit. Astrazeneca one tested various timings, apparently one reasons UK went 12 weeks instead 3-4 (along getting people part-protected early on, instead half many fully protected) - thought better results group got half-dose second time, turned timing dosage. Italy still require test prior flight land even vaxxed realize rest world well? Deaths, overwhelmed hospitals, unemployment, lockdowns, mutations, long hauler, etc. NZ barely deal that. Israel US well, they're close herd immunity. NZ started vaccinating people. always going people decide ""common sense"" cursory knowledge means ""expert."" sucks, people actually curious world. 

Never hurts info how, when, massk work don't. could find, ton research before, conclusive. feel like without reason widespread usage probably something studied.  course, want people die. CDC website states stopped tracking breakthrough cases May 1st also recommend vaccinated people get tested close contact positive person. 

In contrast, go Singapore MOH website covid 19 click local situation/updates provide synopsis person tested positive even give dates someone vaccinated, covid symptoms, age, etc. Chi-Loong Chan runs local Singapore community website visualizing Singapore data MOH. Singapore government, despite using Pfizer Moderna vaccines, forthcoming transparent fully vaccinated folks transmitting others. 11 yo would actually prefer get lower dose. children younger I’m relieved smaller dose feel confident giving it. time it’s approved time study complete... think dates different one another. called Indian variant it. scientific articles papers start using delta variant follow source information. 

If keep pumping data concerning delta variant yet keep renaming Indian variant, creates confusion. following source, nothing political lmao. everything political people wonder they're going play one song starts quiet gets loud. Good. researchers found wearing mask talking reduced particles directly mask average 93%, bottom 91%, sides 85% top 47%, although substantial variability individuals. got similar results team used simulations model overall reduction particles due wearing mask, allowing leakage around edges. calculated overall efficiency masks 70% talking 90% air escape limit overall efficiency surgical masks reducing expiratory particle emissions, masks nonetheless provide substantial reduction,” Cappa said. “Our results confirm mask wearing provides significant reduction probability disease transmission via expiratory particles, especially infected susceptible individuals wear masks.” complete lack understanding protects. Zombie bites isn’t one them. got ""reactive"" result included antibody blood test donated vaccination. ""negative"" time. 

For whatever worth. actually take HIPAA training hearing always make kind smolder. Besides obvious ""Vegans eating 10lbs red meat week"", look demographics vegan see? Surprisingly rich turning vegan (surprised me!) often less affulent, **young** demographics vegetarianism veganism common.

I'd like see study account age wealth comparisons.  even read comments. OP said countries need more. “table 4” actually thought. would make sense. writer article presented ""they've tested fraction cases, therefore likely higher"" make grand statements ass zero evidence back up. sure maybe takes awhile sequence time get statistic it’s already changed. Since it’s infectious maybe assuming it’s growing faster rate. part ""both fully vaccinated tested negitive multiple times fight her"" understand? Nice confirmed guess, although plague rats still struggling basic concepts like ""oxygen molecules smaller virus"" Manager: Wow social distance?

People keep saying various countries *never* close true. Well, happened Republicans decided edgelord viable political stance. satisfying. seems like many people anti-vax spout stupidity face consequences. It’s nice see justice without idiot die.

Also: pharmacist house arrest mom dad’s place?  Yep. spike shown graph likely result thanksgiving/christmas/new years. see trending along administered vaccine doses closely. We'll see lower case numbers continues trend. eggs used production either mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) adenovirus vector vaccines (Johnson Johnson, Astrazeneca).

It’s also seasonal. look curve live NJ, it’s almost exactly spring last spring. low rates summer 2020 cold weather came back fall. It’s little lower now, I’m sure vaccines effect, don’t think we’re really going see full effect fall. Heh, know invade kill cells every organ persons body, cause sorts neurological issues. odds us finding even long term issues roll forward significant. 

As opposed shot vaccine technology studied something like decade now, well understood, shown long term impacts. refusing allow dying people leave see families, barred entry.

This past year shown lot different societies. nothing important everyone's lives stay healthy prevent others getting sick, litterally point living protect stay helthy mean that's fair.

Flu fighters CDC currently recommends single, valid vaccination series (i.e., either two-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series single dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) administered.

Yes, coronavirus different, reasoning using norovirus completely wrong. take joke. Aside occasional lockdown, Covid something Australians watch TV.

Australia's response excellent.

Given pfizer seeking approval vaccinating children using much smaller doses, means 32% population could vaccinated amount vaccine substance would take vaccinate 7.53% used adults. might mean Africa needs 24.47% less vaccine substance reach herd immunity.


The math:

Something like 12% 6 months 5 year old, 19% 5 12.

30 mg RNA (or micrograms?) used adults, 10 mg children aged 5-12, 3 mg 6 months-5 years.

Most vaccines (and vaccines used western countries) specifically target spike protein virus. spike protein also used bind specific part cells order allow virus enter.

If spike protein mutates enough completely slip vaccine-induced antibodies, highly likely also longer able bind receptors well, making virus less infectious (or even all) cause particular variant spread. virus limited much mutate. wealthy countries ""done"", things become bottlenecks; like infrastructure willingness vaccinated. urgency felt things fast drop, whether wealthy countries actually pay maintain pace... knows? get antibodies first dose vaccine, first dose 33% effective delta. far enough along make difference needed.

It's definitely going much different looking wave others, vulnerable infection large part going less vulnerable severe disease (either young one dose vaccine), rising hospital occupancy areas ahead wave signaling reason caution. ignore science like 1 pediatric flu death season less Covid deaths period. 

Past seasons offer little comparison since mask, distancing even flu vaccines less common. Hey I'm medical research (but medical advice!, etc.): contagious variants probably spell bad news children. virus opportunities mutate (say, large number unvaccinated individuals), could become infectious worse/different symptoms previous variants.

Praying gtfo company soon, try request remote opportunity? vote future countrymate! things true. half Republicans, 61 percent independents 88 percent Democrats vaccinated yet barely 50 percent population vaccinated? sounds like people might lying sample representative overall picture. longer time doses effective. Get first dose whatever ASAP high degree protective immunity.

Two doses Pfizer studied more, there's reason think J&amp;J Pfizer booster later would worse.    question They. knowledge, Ohio, admit covid need oxygen way. There's reason sitting hospital breathe.   ended happening? Good thing nobody would ever elect shape policy,  First all, keep saying ""it"" like there's one shot. three approved *emergency use.*

Second all, *you're factually incorrect* evidenced know I'm condoning death such, people learn getting switch. kind people, kids stick finger hand lit stove burner even though said hot first. president really got sense slapped him. assuming he's chinese? he's uninformed peasant like true, liberal people think.

Delta variants assholes, that's that's why. NY not. Waiting Bill Gates turned nanobots yet.


/sarcasm   Vermonters, bet referendum join Canada, referendum would pass. No, lethal enough make big difference. Yeah did, lot people? need system verification works everyone got it. Point data would prove people fully vaccinated UK make significant percentage infected covid. surge still minor compared previous, affecting still unvaccinated. 
Also, regarding Seychelles…significantly lower efficacy vaccine given time already oncoming surge…more importantly, 2/3rds tested positive zero mild symptoms terms hospitalized 80% people vaccinated, majority also health conditions. even lower reliability vaccines STILL JOB. Sit down. Surely unlikely matter much - would need variant wave hit one states matter electorally (NH - MI - WI - PA - NC - GA - NV - AZ) also Black Democrat voters vaccinated - questionable access issues lack trust medical profession (see people thread posting low vaccination rates Detroit). would also need consequential normal demographic change (i.e. old people dying replaced Gen-Z), Republican vote suppression, issue partially swing suburban Hispanic voters Republicans (i.e. rising crime). think know would refusing vaccinate. loud distinct minority. hospitalizations rising areas low vaccination rates.

people died killed. Taiwan fumbling? 

Daily case around 500\~ish death count around 20-30 population 23 million pretty bad according east-asia standards. 

Yes, agree number ain't bad. 1) number going even though almost month; 2)Taiwan going people vaccinated anytime soon. 

The comparison Singapore fair , Singapore almost 10 times infections fewer deaths Taiwan, means Singapore probably done much better job mass testing.  backed b what? total lack experience field?

Those non-vaccinated heard rest country reopening thought applied well. Shit hit fan jackholes decide travel states start another localized pandemic. Indeed, second half article delves more. Chicago, fairly well vaccinated (45% total population, including yet eligible) difficulty vaccinating African American community rates rest city (30% fully vaccinated, including yet eligible, whereas 53% total white population fully vaccinated), absolutely red/blue issue arena, issue hesitancy and/or access different reasons. Yeah they've places. Wish would live. Might get people get shot. Yeah, vaccines one thing could blow trumpet real. turn everything culture war. bit bummer, encouraging probably going get point summer. Keep mind polling typically shows ~60% American adults dead set getting vaccinated, meaning basically every new 18+ gets shot someone previously least somewhat skeptical getting shot. science says COVID threat vaccinated folks. 

Well that's true. 

It's still threat, lot less one. 95% efficacy means 1/20th threat compared unvaccinated. J&amp;J variants, like 1/4th threat. That’s works. Higher transmissibility, higher herd immunity threshold.

The formula herd immunity 1-1/R_0. R_0 Delta variant 60% higher Alpha variant.  Well oregon there's million dollar drawing end month.

Let scientists analyze figure out. Assuming narrative false proper analysis shows mind already made up. scientific approach all. knew worked trying argue it... point Trump seems factor depressing vaccinations.

Sure, long ignore vaccination rates based demographics would show demographics opposed Trump also tend least vaccinated despite disproportionately higher effort specifically get vaccinated. Like, sure. literally elect people spend tax dollars behalf? Meaning energy spend tax money building roads, weapons? choice either, that's elected officials us. Lol, amusing comment. Reminds P.1 one fear crap I’d see around you.

The mRNA vaccines, least Pfizer, found 88% effective Delta variant. UK already study this. 

And ya two doses needed. always been, way. UK found one dose 51% effective B.1.1.7. begin with. comment US. Guess much supply they’ve giving second doses months regular intervals? US. 

Almost Delta variant cases UK among unvaccinated younger people (who still don’t even access vaccine) one dose. 

Again, amusing comment. hope every ignorant, covid denying, male gets COVID, spend weeks hospital, survive shit sex life. wasn’t, it’s speculation. Canada slow reopening, hence said joke like tax money helps people 3 June data show 12,383 cases Delta variant, 464 went present emergency care 126 people admitted hospital. 126 people, 83 unvaccinated, 28 received one dose **just three received doses vaccine.**

3/126 = ~2.3% hospitalised doses,  
28/126 = ~22% hospitalised single dose 
83/126 = ~66% unvaccinated (mostly 30) 
12/126 = way compare similar unvaccinated control group. course difficult real world rather controlled, blind trials, still lot better looking percentage vaccinated people get sick. 

That said, clear vaccines really, really great. Everyone get vaccinated, get vaccinated. Fair point. said ""committed donate."" might bit biased, faith they'll follow through. isn't. There's sort options provided purpose 

Buddy even best search algorithms world somebody following along covid information know there's information sexual health matter they're looking.

Next list infrastructure. problem takes long time vaccines delivered, administered actually aneffected. takes months, time spread may already gone down.

Also, countries *haven't* affected ones greatest risk, ones lowest natural immunity. Biden, though take credit.

Yes. government taking credit government action things work. Everyone knows money comes taxpayers. government good smart things money government gets credit. far people want transfer permanent work home option. haven’t made easy option though.

Ok big difference 2.5% risk. covid risk children similar flu important keep perspective Dense. …but people died getting it, right? incredibly unlikely new variant makes big enough difference justify lockdowns even there's way government could convince people start over. pandemic socially US. gym 100% unmasked liberal city shopping centers also 50%  That's fair. data means people trials. way see main reason vaccinating 6 year old greater good reaching immunity, therefore willing wait data.

Pussies Well probably yes, happened lot countries pandemic crises.

Check france's new cases november 7 Yes, taking virus seriously looks like. putting safety community ahead individual wants looks like.

This civilization looks like. you’re already familiar, look RCCX theory. data points

Such what? always like data. specifically would convince though? Full licensure? Actual approval? Supposedly single vaccine fully licensed, vaccines approved EUA. even sure &lt;12's handled licensed adults EUA comes kids. 

The 2 things make think worth theoretical risks are:

1) dose mRNA body gets finite body runs it, disappears. Meaning *theoretically* long term effects. Covid-19 infection SARS-CoV-2 virus limits, often said lingering virus may cause ""long Covid"" occur.

2) WOmen pregnant received vaccine now, various stages. babies born protection transferred mothers. vaccinated, next closest thing. immediate side effects young children(newborns), would alerted now.

Ok, care black people business motivating people get vaccinated, making excuses don't. 4% adults US immunocompromised/immunosuppressed.

Oh yea?!? Well India third variant!!!! then!?! two cents: 


I got ticket. I'm excited. I've seen band times, superfan, going cathartic. said, bit nervous, risk-averse since March last year (my last indoor show MSG, incidentally, masks, vaccines...well, one mask, woman next me, drank night, really on). attitude is, I'm gonna get plane July...go wedding August...see indoor concerts August/Sept/October/Nov, etc, different? people, sure, actually near 90+% them. masks, sanitizer, I'm vaccinated, I'm protected Brothers (Allman) concert last year. public transport since night I'll take subway train friday get acquaintance's car get bachelor party...so things opening (I FIRST meal outside home (other hospital food) done since...babysteps...and admittedly big step day, feel comfortable, I'll sell ticket eat (bought cheap one).  


Also, think 16 vax test rule stupid, especially father's day show...how many dads bringing kids this... expected along. I’m sure people surprised. see countries this? Russia’s death toll least 100K one listed now. US too, likely programs conducted CDC last decades, call bad actors? Let's ban travel forever  double vaccinated easily verified Vams - otherwise known CDC log CDC shows vaccine certificate status.... Montreal come. Bringing USDollars too. kinda like going places care health own. Refreshing. 

CANT wait. point facts explain black community behave way, entirely fault. government needs more. bad actors, programs supported U.S. government. sad situation her, can't lock society incredibly slim portion population physically get vaccinated. alternative solution protect them. listening interview doctor C-SPAN today said:

""We know strong benefit natural immunity think probably lasts least year. We’ve virus around little year we’re sure long that’s going last.""

However, still advocates getting vaccine even natural 00:01:28)

As far know current COVID-19 vaccines original strain virus, show body spike protein. Whereas natural infection body sees entire virus.

I'm entirely opposed vaccines. going take one would prefer take one mimics close possible natural infection, would live attenuated vaccine.

One concerns current COVID-19 vaccines injected muscle, place body sees virus first natural infection. natural infection body sees virus respiratory system first, maybe intestines virus swallowed food drink. respiratory system intestines part mucosal system different immune response rest body, I've heard. even get vaccine might still get infected mucosal system spread virus. That's reason health authorities saying still wear mask vaccinated.

So ideal vaccine opinion would live attenuated nasal spray form, perhaps oral pill infect intestines. Codagenix vaccine nasal spray. vaccine already exists flu - FluMist Quadrivalent AstraZeneca. recall studies, efficacy plateaued 28 days, efficacy measured 28 days. explains real world efficacy could slightly higher (i.e. measuring 35 days would give higher efficacy).  Exactly right. Covid us 10 years impacting don’t get vaccinated. Additional lockdowns moot point. Get vaccinated live life. not.  shame lol. Happy admit that. There's reason even offered people anymore. Happy real risk {Herd immunity} different area, community.

Right. We're going reach different times different states multiple reasons:

Not really comparable situations though. one, COVID vastly less deadly disease. two, travel much slower back then, meant took longer spread different areas around Europe burn way out. long story short, vaccine still effective Similar page: Colorado though, 20%, seems sequenced everything Grand Junction instead random.

As society, think we're going make decisions based 1 100,000 outcomes. kids, particularly preexisting comorbidities like childhood onset obesity/diabetes, die Covid. long rare outcome, considerations take precedence. I'm Florida, every drug store pretty much vaccine point. None coworkers vaccinated, none husband's coworkers vaccinated none plan get vaccinated.

I doubt vaccination numbers go much higher Florida they're already at. feel bad people immunosuppressed people kid's can't get vaccinated point. super rural community, less likely get anyways, but, know people gotten vaccine. Literally NONE relatives gotten it. I've got like two Facebook friends have. 

I would say easily 90% people know Florida strongly opposed vaccine, but, I'm particularly politicized pocket. 

I feel bad immunosuppressed young kids, but, around here, everybody else made choice. figured implied, since Ohio. dig bit beyond article strain reduces vaccine efficacy. absolutely need doses mRNA vaccines...no coasting partial immunity bc declines markedly this. know vaccines perform yet.

And apparently hitting schools hard UK. (Do go summer break soon???)

I'm concerned 12s US. think they'll vaccine access school starts. 

The way thing mutates we'll due next strain 'what now' September, earlier. remember correctly, believe going divorce. Ffs people, get vaccinated make sure first one ticket scanned 50+ people bought person. Yes, StubHub refund ticket fake/already sold/whatever, that's little consolation sitting outside show planning go weeks months.  point, unvaccinated adults taking chances choice. Society much protect people stupidity. Oh goodie people definitely higher concentration inconsiderate annoying.

As well higher concentration infectious deadly. Pandemic really altered German mindsets recall living decade ago. Germans keen privacy, point cash much bigger way life credit cards America. like anonymity. Best thing exactly you’ve throughout 2020, best ability.

You’ve got this! I’m dam happy hear vaccines available guys there. UK US basically percentage population fully vaccinated right ( 41.1% UK vs 41.6% US). Two weeks ago, US slightly ahead (39% vs 34%), UK somewhat ahead first doses entire year.

I dont think differences immunizations strategy delayed second dose could driving this, since numbers, two countries really similar spot right now.

I think likely possibilities are:

1) Immunizimg older population first leaving youth unprotected lead higher spread seen k UK vs US.

Or

2) Astra Zeneca vaccine significantly less effective Moderna / Pfizer Delta variant. dont know direct evidence this, since half UK vaccines far AZ, would explain data. would also rather bad news going forward, countries around world still pinning hopes om cheaper vaccine.

Or

c) US International travel restrictions luck meant delta variant taken hold easily. looks like % fully vaxxed % one dose similar US UK. differences think 1) closer proximity UK countries variants problem 2) use AstraZeneca vs Moderna/Pfizer. happen anti-Vaxers start dying. don’t think anything would convince get it. Though read people died hospital still believing COVID... Mild side effects. Kids bounce. Mine headache feel great day. it.

My husband felt nothing.

I significant side effects fine end. South still 50% vaccinated. surprised Florida goes much higher 55% so, pretty firmly divided party line point. South barely cracked 40% people one vaccine. wide open vaccine availability Florida month now. rest getting vaccine. Thank you. America really need people like you. I’m fully vaccinated. permitted get vaccine booster?  Two months? Six Months? 

I mean they’re going throw away. harm getting another shot?  Especially different type. date? Finally person multiple risk factors, right hospitalized without guaranteed exposure unvaccinated staff? Many patients extra high risk! choose hospital half unvaccinated staff one fully vaccinated staff, sick child, would choose? [You forgot 2008 Yes honestly, RC making magnet worst sorts people. type people would probably even go cruise choosing support RC’s vaccine blind stance. people definitely higher concentration inconsiderate annoying. I'm denying diseases spread quickly boats, I'm saying fact half population immune slow rate.

If 100% Diamond passengers caught Covid instead 19%, argument. stats 1-dose J&amp;J variant drop vaccine efficacy doses Pfizer vaccine shown 88% effective Delta variant, two doses AstraZeneca shot shown 60% effective strain, according NIH data. agree. fucking stupid vaccinated traveling Europe need test get back country... live L.A. cases absolutely stop going Christmas. surge started couple weeks Thanksgiving continued January early February. days January hit 20k cases per day, cases tracked back people getting together Christmas. See California's cases came Los Angeles County, 25% state's population much higher density rest state. There’s lot anti vaccine disinformation targeted black people, even coming ostensibly black sources. see Instagram time. nothing past medical malpractice inane conspiracy Covid. Yep. Covid basically US. Anyone chosen get vaccinated responsible point onus protection them.

It is! frankly, expecting answer since every time visit family North-western Massachusetts somebody tells me. serious answers making day! 


The difference that, Massachusetts, squirrel falls big sap boiling pot pick toss offending creature woods. worry, pick Vermont too. make sure wipe tossing back woods. able work remotely exploded housing market people realize live around major metropolitan areas.  UK Canada very, similar vaccination rates (although Canada improving bit faster). Keep him! guess read comment. Isn’t Canada close? side effects have? Ive got similar story, sure want unblind I'm also worried double vaccine dose (my turn coming tomorrow). I'm pretty sure get placebo, yeah placebo effect  There’s massive spectrum. experienced ICU nurse one valuable members care team. people like end spectrum Yes I’ve literally people tell last days masks don’t anything. claim Fauci’s emails confirm ‘fact’.  Vtdiggers Facebook comment sections begs differ Ha. take quick trip North Carolina: tons shots one wants them. show shot clinic someone stick needle arm, problem. Delta variant much infectious others, population areas spreading often lower uptake vaccine live together multigenerational housing (think came from), plenty 8/10 one dose 2nd recently. 

Hospital admissions deaths, although lagging infections, seem rising much slowly. next weeks we'll find problem concerned (I'm hoping much).   Delta variant also shown evade natural immunity petri dish (but real world data yet). Wayyyy many naturally infected Americans skipping vaccine thinking immunity good enough. seems higher hospitalization rate UK, particularly younger folk less likely vaccinated. it’s even transmissible already highly transmissible Alpha/UK variant, doubling every 8 days. It’s 60% cases there, home Alpha, now. That’s insane. low vaccine availability many countries low vaccine uptake US, there’s reason believe last variant concern we’ll see.

I kind wish we’d waited last stimulus check could’ve tied vaccination. period time? sounds like hell lot vaccine short interval.   nightmare last night variant could beat vaccines far would go lockdown again, possible even likely? Well we've approved using Pfizer-BNT second dose got first dose AZ, made possibility last week based results UK study. I'm phase 2b participant. talked today (they called question daybook) asked delay. said know comment made. since likely tomorrow sign another vaccine, mentioned need tell decide get stay blinded study. still use information within study. still stuck USA visa can't visit home country despite fully vaccinated able enter US way back able publish scary articles anymore!   yeah, kind thing happening rural places demand dried within US, time get countries quickly possible. J&amp;J presents interesting opportunity single-dose, could work really well countries remote populations. I'm going get downvoted this, get wrong appreciate nurses job do. know doctors personally, usually say nurses brightest tools shed, usually look them. also know nurses myself, agree assessment somewhat. Sorry, wasn’t sure could say Asshole here.  around 60% people fully vaccinated immunity prior infection. Delta arrived would close enough since (and infectious) higher herd immunity threshold required (maybe 75%). Please explain like I’m five, without insults. It’s understanding cycle sensitivity 40’s reduced back normal ranges somewhere teens. Oh no! anyway...  Yup that's me. got second curevac placebo vaccination April figured would race turn vaccine approval. turn vaccine of(most likely) tomorrow thinking waiting approval, really think will. many people working healthcare vaccines? I'm healthcare struggle understand that. Genuinely curious know be. feels like setup joke… think know why.. nurses. Think that. one year pandemic, need new study understand thst face masks stops virus spreading?
That's Italy face masks still mandatory even outdoors.

But also understand topic quite hard countries understand. Indeed! social distancing public removed many events unable run person, half hearted. 

Personally, parent life still different. still can’t attend kids’ school events, set foot inside child’s nursery, go indoor toddler group, go coffee morning, send kids scouts attend church. could run won’t 2m distancing removed. disastrous it’s far way normality. (Not 1st world).

It actually steady decline count global amount cases (and ignore indian upspike Modi bs) due biggest covid culprit US successfully rolling vaccines. populated countries northern hemisphere, reduce cases brings total overall. 80% adults 80% population. Furthermore, variants delta variant raise threshold herd immunity raise R-number. Additionally, antibodies mean immune; first vaccine dose may get antibodies, may few, still get sick. goes among get re-infected, get infected fully vaccinated. cases, illness usually less severe. People downvoting doesn’t mean you’re wrong. living Asia years ago, multiple people met try talk dumping money US real estate. idea takes maintain US-style stick-built house, like roof leak *really will* take house down. It’s one things seems like good idea paper could go horribly wrong real life. don’t think listened me. UK seeing surge US even Europe, strikes odd think Canada mixing vaccines.  Same, American. typical life involves cross border commute meet family?

Border UK regions? That's allowed vast majority cases. Outside UK? That's going apply widespread birthday party home?

I try limit year, regular enough occourance worry about. Oh, way whenever want, guidance well ventilated.

Frankly can't think single thing done past weeks restrictions involved, great holiday, saw family, work usual. Plus even countries vaccinated good proportions populations; wearing mask crowded spaces bad idea regardless. much *porque los dos?* situation. active cases really start drop meaningless levels, extra protection make sense. see ... good one! LMAO I’m middle nowhere rural North Carolina. bought house $200k 2018 could sell $300k easy right now. Someone building spec houses around bigger mine pricing $400k. Why?  Don’t really know. Antibodies wont necessarily stop infection especially new variant. 
But also crucially UK large swathes population without antibodies interact together. 
Can spread amongst 30s next little data shows cloth surgical masks terribly effective general public typical use.

Many countries would love get call asking take lot vaccines. could also done parallel would take time all.

Most countries also supply restrained actually distribution restrained handle extra amount vaccines. Yea it’s fucking stupid considering UK Us leading countries vaccinations.

In likelihood, already pretty good idea rates long COVID, we're suddenly going find catastrophic new side effect years road. Building this, number TYPE person died coronavirus never known It’s certain covid-19 treatments trigger herpesvirus immunocompromised patients. 

A vaccine isn’t treatment covid-19. opposite concern, risk Delta causing issues relatively minor, ever variant broke vaccines completely severely, know late Science^TM slow. experts would urge calm regardless circumstances. example, time got data vaccines worked well Delta, already found US. 2017. house worth close 50k paid there's way could afford move. neighbors house sold 20 minutes. Basically every vaccine side effect history appeared within two months. Given tens thousands people trials (and two billion subsequent shots approval), would shocking new side effect suddenly appeared year later.  explained nurse reddit. believes although nurses smart understand science get licensed, continuing education really significant. initial schooling, prone outside influences conspiracy theories, etc. makes sense, think. Sketchy, know. people weren’t wearing masks begin with. people problem along  Also much older population states, age demonstrably correlated likelihood getting vaccinated. Okay? care much? Nobody see saying sure lab leak believe probably needs investigated. believe was, guys believe wasn't. opinions mean nothing thoroughly investigated scientific consensus reached. unvax people take personal responsibility get vaccinated wear damn mask. They’re ones never changed life style sacrificed anything last year. I’m done. part got vax soon could. Tell wear mask maybe consequences actions  Agree. resources money helped enormously. technology advancements mRNA vaccine too. done fast decade ago.

Some folks can't get vaccines various *legitimate* health reasons. rely herd immunity *from vaccinations others*. Everyone else faces way risk COVID mRNA vaccines. saying is, rest us look forward another surge lockdowns new super variant? Great. Thanks lot. Sure, risk adults, mean heartless I'm wearing mask someone refuses take precautions. think children great risk overall (their risk worth masking social distancing. That's small is, IMO.) think would try re-implement mask mandates (or realistically, ""suggest them"") tiny percentage children people refuse wear get vaccinated anyway.

For at-risk adults (if included argument) can't take vaccine different issue. fact going millions unvaccinated adults actively trying *not* socially distance put risk whether like not. also there, think mask mandate solution.

My whole point think masks answer point makes think suggested unless essentially new virus spreading without type immunity it.  Rochester, NY ridiculous. many 'investors' and/or wealthier, big-city folks buying everything. lot people realized could get money Rochester rather cities like NYC. plus, able work remotely thus move... Many locals cash competitive home buyers.

1) protection existing infection still quite good, incentive get vaccine since also make feel like crap day two, come (very small) risks.

Minnesota launched incentive program couple weeks ago, offering people initiated vaccination end May end June number prizes, including amusement passes VISA gift cards. Since program launched, ~5,200 people claimed prize new vaccination rate state continues absolutely crater. 

In seven days prior Memorial Day, state averaged 7,400 first doses per day 16+ population (0.17% total 16+ pop). Since Memorial Day 4,300 (0.09%). 

There's essentially way state gets 70% 16+ population shot July 1st, frankly little-to-no chance gets August 1st based trends numbers coming state, things considered seems middle road nationally comes vaccination trends. 

I think we're effectively done vaccination campaign except extremely targeted community outreach, small bump &lt;12 eligibility fall, small bump mandates vaccines receive full approval. sip sunshine great. totally disagree heady topper.  Wow, state sounds amazing! I'm Wisconsin, completely different. really good cheese, craft beer, scenic views... Maybe different all... Why? Orlando. mask mandate's gone vaccines available since April 5th, yet half people every store I've gone still wearing masks. 80% adults mean 60% whole population, around 27 million people UK without antibodies. 121k active cases despite 27 million unprotected people.

Since nearly unprotected people young and/or clinically vulnerable, 148 critical cases much different to, say, situation last year. Fit? Sure. Transmissible? He's arguing appropriate experiments done since, well, since first AMA. asked specifically.

And considering goal ""flatten curve"", ""eradicate COVID"", I'd say still acceptable outcome. crisis. Yes has. doses.  Yes has. guaranteed continue getting worse we're seeing US vaccination rates flattening 52%, restrictions easing, virulent strains propagating.

Smart too, virus knows borders. want mutation brewery chugging away non-stop. think community outreach still continue point think don’t think much convincing remaining unvaccinated. Nothing embarrassed dude. new virus whatever say help many people out, it’s control pandemic together ! Hope gets better thank sharing. can't really separate two things meaningful level.

But yes, COVID-19 seem many potential male sexuality related concerns. there. live one. We're fully reopening Friday. OP made 2 subjective claims ""Strong. Yet compassionate"" one objective claim, ""No war"", indicators ""good"" administration.

They seem suggest Biden runs ""good"" administration given much time office great measure. Bush invaded Afghanistan first year office.

So reasonable ask ""No wars"" administration we're talking about.

Trump? may started wars kept several wars going?

Obama? Bush? Clinton? Bush Sr? Regan? Carter? started wars.

How far back going consider one good? There’s reason careful, always been. Wash hands, cover mouth elbow sneeze cough, don’t put hands mouth face — good practice daily life.

Cautious, overly careful, could mean wearing masks times vaccination, avoiding public spaces (ie: grocery delivery takeout rather going inside stores).

What you’re describing, unsafe potentially hazardous behavior. Spraying Lysol doesn’t lower chance contracting covid, never point pandemic. isn’t healthy overuse misuse disinfectants. Changing clothes, wiping everything, bathing constantly come home — also, likely decrease chances contacting disease, even managed exposed.

My point is, don’t think anyone judging one another things like mask wearing avoiding crowds. people comfortable right mask that’s fine, even though they’re vaccinated. doesn’t hurt anyone. Lysol, obsessive procedures, aren’t healthy physically mentally.

Sounds like getting back life, you’re anything extreme leaving getting haircut. Seems like tough situation in. find official CDC guidance, studies, anything like show them? Hormones, parasites, gut biome control behaviors far many would like admit. Biden administration buying… ass. It’s me. I’m buying it. you’re American. American people buying 500,000,000 doses.  It’s like asshole dug Gatesian fortune dump charitable COVID vaccines. shit article.

Okay went 4-5 years back felt like 'hello fellow kids' meme. local rock club going since end May cool, much style, actual enjoying distancing measures finally enough room proper seating. poll recently company majority said would prefer mixed working office/home. would assume people would want flexibility like instead full return.

But again, returning 0 days weekly office assurances least getting booster shot Pfizer/Moderna/AZ/Sputnik. got Sinopharm vaccine efficacy shady say least. Exactly. move benefits US reducing chances American contract Covid-19 future. 

The novel coronavirus mutate come back try best extinguish least significantly limit it. Nice one! It’s times like proud American…. *opens history book\* considering large portion fatalities (77%) elderly, 16% ruled unrelated, probably underlying factor age/immunocompromised patients play.

Something else worth noting reported cases hospitalizations deaths. Imagine unreported cases asymptomatic COVID people never get sick enough know it. would tell us vaccine hand risk reduction.

I'm medical professional guess breakthrough death rate would suggest people may much luck either way. considering denomination would death rate breakthrough cases, reported, likely much less that.

And know 130 million vaccinated people got COVID, ~500 deaths among pool statistically low number. early remember either sperm count actual testicles fucked covid infection get 3 COVID vaccines penis pleasethankyou comment violation brain cells. don’t want unvaccinated pediatric nurse taking care kids can’t vaccinated yet.

South America especially they’re getting wrecked. winter now. ...which enough 3% world's population. need 10-14 billion doses vaccinate world, effort countries like US Germany impeding since pandemics outset efforts protect pharma IP. 

What happened US' supposed support TRIP waiver would allow scale global production? anti-vax misinformation, particular talking point laughable. Nope, Facebook. I'm talking interviews actual nurses topic story, one interviewed CNN. I'd honestly make alt account post embarrassing keep up. important people hear I'm glad shared it. Yeah, cousin said house next door sold hour. I’m kind shocked parents’ house area took seven months sell 18 months ago. Wild.  Last week doses Biontech vaccine delivered EU vaccines delivered week (sans Sinovac). Things speeding up! J&amp;J broke record too, 2nd best week far AZ's deliveries. ~80% hospitalized vaccine all, suggests even single jab provides decent protection serious symptoms. 60% population jab far better position time round. could difference average health accepting vaccines rejecting them. Canada actually, also limits terms hate similar speech. Though think laws exact US. Thanks letting know. didn’t know that. Every Chinese know proud national vaccine. people even know shot got? relatives said got vaccine, I’d feel lot better knowing go AZ choices.. Florida. already told kids’ school optional mask wearing virtual options. going put us scary position sending back. Florida reporting numbers, making guesses bad community infection level is. Add low vaccination rate I’m pretty nervous. get vaccines kid?

The kind ""foreign"" things blood stream kind ""foreign"" things would blood stream Corona vaccine. Demand still high. numbers would already way higher vaccine available. optimistic months 80% vaccinated. one city. They're testing lot cities province. province 100 million people. North already taken care of.

Since beginning May, Canada getting Pfizer US instead Belgium. Today, announced even Moderna going come US.

Technically, donations (which big deal) important thing Canada receiving vaccines much bigger quantities thanks US manufacturing. 100%

And come visit, guess - SPEND MONEY! Especially unique American foodstuffs can't get Canada - certain flavors pop cereal available north border. mention, recently, IDEA stadium/ballpark mustard was, LOVED it! something that's sold Canada.  mean letting foreigners in. Barely impossible anyone, including Chinese nationals, go back. Cognitive dissonance GQP feature bug. bet great YouTube video found Facebook wanna show us, huh? It’s hard outsiders understand scale humanity infrastructure support growth there. even considered city reach population 4 million people.  parents irrationally nervous certain activities weirdly comfortable others. realized mostly tracking social anxiety. dad might afraid widening social circle idea crowded places (gyms, hair salons) actually getting sick.  saying Biden good administration US ever we're lauding started war first 6 months office? will. Canada here, think we’re good now, thanks. like point political dynamic regard Pfizer point Pfizer [which would distributed Fushun] approved would likely condition upon reciprocity recognition Chinese vaccines, ie, Chinese would allow ppl Pfizer come Europe/US/the western world, general, would allow Chinese Sinopharm/Sinovac/CanSino go. 


I know politics shit, probably play out. holding Pfizer recognition region would place risk, would probably take local shot first. think lot vaccination centers give second doses right now. least case NRW. Likely places, too. think, U.K., U.S. given caring people stupid get shots.

Actually that's definitely case UK. Uptake 99-100% vulnerable groups. 40s ticking towards 90% mark well. There's likely shade hesitancy among youngest groups, polling suggests great amount more. Unlike countries similar points vaccination campaign, still many people willing step part. Today was, believe, biggest day vaccine registration date younger age groups become eligible sign up. been, particular, great effort contact hesitant among vulnerable groups facilitate getting shot. areas lower rates uptake became hotspots, extra effort taken bring vaccines people areas persuade make use them. feel like anyone given on. 

That's reason taken much longer countries get younger ages. We're vaccinating half three quarters adults willing--we're getting damn near *everyone*.

So faith going okay another couple months, millions vaccines belt. have, stage, giant pool unvaccinated younger people children virus rip unhindered.

But that's things like vaccine passports seem like useful idea UK. places hesitancy greater, absolutely! seems really increased uptake Israel, example. country that's going like 85-90% eligible population willing get it, seem like vaccine passport going much use. say someone fairly supportive idea became clear really need it. issue right supply, demand. One good things Trump administration start new military actions. Well said. I’m Chinese too. Chinese AMERICAN.  believe mean ""slappening."" IQ test kids lengthy section conspiracy theory/Facebook “research” bullshit. 

I *hope* people believed shit infertile.   Nope... uk too! need get anti-vax echo chamber. ideas nonsense.  hear ya, us part past year frankly fucking sick tired BS unvaxed crowd.

They've plenty opportunities point. longer care covid spreads amongst them. ""Personal responsibility"" yo.

That said, still wear mask stores trust fuckers. 50% **some people** wanting get vaccinated 60% **some racial/gender people** following **some people** above, means nearly 30% **racial/gender** people wearing masks right vaxed.  making assumption (and borderline ad hominem attack) instead actually addressing said.

For record, vaccines incredibly wonderful. I'm vaccinated. Everybody know vaccinated. vaccines helped city basically get herd immunity already great take mask situations.

You wrong assumptions me. stop it, please. going go cry it? Exactly zero started administration. non american, understand USA pay, though. always understood vaccine production problem world wide, money pay it. China sold [with small % donated] 250 million rest world combined numbers likely one these:
in forest
eating creemees
sledding downhill
in corn field
tapping maples
drinking great beer

biking uphill
building snow forts
...is spend days Think differently would handled message made clear outset. death rate statistically significant 2 deaths. lucky deaths greatly changes percentage. would disability though. Also, ada allows discrimination person can't reasonably safely job. 

For example, business reasonably deny blind person job truck driver. everyone vaccinated , take years vaccinate everyone globally. misunderstood. 

The 95% symptomatic COVID. addressed that. 

What good evidence (enough actually put number it) ADDITIONAL protection severe cases deaths, chance getting symptomatic COVID. like fanta's love mixing things. lab leak theory posits wide range scenarios. theory pushed target China deflect responsibility. lab leak certainly possible, actual implications likely mundane. virus spreading early October, possible origin Wuhan wet markets. Chinese health officials noticed surge pneumonia flu-like cases early, bringing samples closest virus lab Wuhan province studying virus. possible leak Chinese government want known trust government super important Chinese State. November, China started reporting virus outbreak. December threat understood resources mobilized contain it. January national governments began act. took 4-5 months earliest known case outbreak reach critical epidemic spread justify lockdowns.

Any investigation origin virus good thing. ignoring conspiratorial often racially motivated thinking unproductive. scant evidence absurd claims like virus engineered bio-warfare example. concern stems parents.

We know certainty yet still spread covid others vaccinated happen breakthrough case. entire subset population (children) cannot get vaccinated yet, still much potentially inherent risk kids vaccinated parent(s) contract Covid somewhere society bring back home.  DC likely Since winter one strictest lockdowns vaccine strategy? sounds cool. fire earth power one person cool. would make laws extremely idiotic, can't even give vaccines places USA still use them. Mr. President, Mr. President, can’t BBQ July 4th friends family? flavor ice cream eating 4th? men vaccine deniers Covid hoaxers already small wee wees. won’t change mind. part remaining 48% US probably already Covid past year immunity it. Given little people abided restrictions areas, I'd bet least half 48% already it. company didn’t require it, big educational push incentivized it. (Not healthcare). 85% vaccination rate, seemed work. However think healthcare may need required safety patients. remember, started Delayed Security Security, choose

and got get lockdown entire areas land physically preventing residents leaving buildings without iron grip, iron grip look kindly critical expression.

Your position seems freedom possible chosen security. second quote demonstrate suggesting countries ""iron grip"" critical free expression successfully execute lockdowns.

I'm arguing China led authoritarian regime. I'm arguing lockdowns China happen enforced heavy handedly.

Instead I'm demonstrating Freedom Security absolutes. There's spectrum. Countries people enjoy lot Freedom also able put place measures ensured quite lot security. nothing choice. China lives end spectrum argument refuting mine.

So again, second quote nonsense. Retraction? Never. Every successive move double alternative facts excuse. Know adversary. whatever want, odds incredibly low anything bad happening really factor rational risk assessment parents. naw, realize point unvaxed generally unwilling vaccine harmless, coworkers likely refusing political reasoning and/or medicinal misinformation.

Dont concerned it, fact, would personally reccomend getting jab yourself, immunity great everyone involved.  Sounds like say conspiracy theorist exausted means get vaccinated.......like trying sell honey nut cheerios saying it'll help nut Sith speak absolutes. CVS Walgreens pharmacists chimed verifying ""guardian"" bringing kids vaccination covid.

There even articles talking older teenagers helping youngers get vaccine places like Texas getting vaxed relatively high rates too. 5mil population 2-3mil citizens  Oops, thank you.... fault. Sorry that....

Economically, Canadians cannot live without USA big brother. Imagine working HOSPITAL shocked need vaccinated enough moron lose job it. Idiots. Correct, wouldn’t want give BioNTech “shaft” would we? Hmmmm? Yes LPN til switched imaging instead continuing onto BSN confusing that, pretty surprised associate's degree would get amount science background &amp; good hear true I’m comfortable saying best sure know amazing things want don’t give ramblings morons. would love go concert, willing wear mask long. willing group people packed place people might vaxxed. Sighs, maybe next year. pretty obvious guy's previous comments promoted, Iraqi wmd's still ""on table"".  I'm assuming US (which, far know, hate speech laws place). 

In Western Europe though, Freedom speech limited hate speech, person definitely prosecuted (even happen always).  100% agree. greatly concerned misinformation, honestly want everything prevent care falling victim it.  Well didn’t really see super critical lots acts 70s still huge shows. Neil young, Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, dead company, Rolling Stones, who, roger waters, eagles, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel… 

But yeah focused comparing quality level. Look local case levels determine relative risk. Cases plummeting across country, even vaccinated around 95% less likely get infected January. Add vaccination something like 99.xx% less likely. ask level risk willing take. I'm guessing relevant enough needed NPR article. Vaccinations slowed reason country secured enough doses citizens. Misinformation crux pandemic recovery, else we'd never seem mask hesitancy. He’s embarrassment name. interesting. want projection population 2021.

Given we're nearly halfway 2021, would probably make sense account extra take 1.2% annual population growth rate last 10 years (even though expect lower 2020 atypical). would put closer 127,526,192 130 million.

Yep, 127.5M definitely closer 130M 126M — thanks confirming that.

NOTE: I'm saying I'm opposed this, least give credit credit due. American taxpayer actually funding this, say thank you. sure say -- connecting vaccines work viral mutations work, perhaps. Yes, current vaccine mostly effective, even Delta, assurance effective future mutations—it almost certainly be. odds long shots getting effective vs future mutations. fact Pfizer vs Delta shows lower effectiveness point: subsequent mutations lower lower responsively current vaccines longer considered effective. Evolutionarily, generalized vaccination actually \*favor\* rise mutations less non-responsive vaccines able spread full population, unvaccinated, boosted unvaccinated taking fewer precautions. trying alarmist—this works. current vaccines work well enough put risk highly contagious COVID infection carries high fatality rate behind us good? Well would great, would mean very, lucky.  Well, Germany uses similar approach, least mass vaccination centres. book ""appointment pairs"" first second dose web site, usually 6 weeks apart Biontech Moderna 12 weeks AstraZeneca. there's way get single appointment one dose, always book 2 appointments.

But keep second dose storage. second dose probably delivered manufacturer days second appointment. terrorists destroy Biontech Moderna vaccine plant, luck wait bit (or maybe lot) longer second dose.

I haven’t looked model seems reasonable good model might lowball predicted growth new variants.

So guess model says 6%, experts think it’s underestimate model isn’t great nowcasting variants make certain proportion cases.

Yeah, get one end pretty handily. since towns super small, outside Burlington people used driving place groceries, hardware, clothing, whatever.  IIRC - Methodist employs 20k people. 178 people refuse less 1% seems really good me.

Like job, employees really weigh rest field. degree doesn’t mean good doing, medical degree doesn’t mean know everything health. still keep date current research events. Something something .... obvious

 frustrating public health agencies won’t give preliminary approval purpose. It’s use decades human use, animals critics frequently claim, anti-parasitic, side effects profile well charactized, minor short term.

 Given fact top experts field say effectiveness logical reason public health agencies won’t least give emergency use authorization doctors care.

 interview conference lead organizer Dr. Tina Peers:

How Treat Long Covid | Conference Important.  safest effective vaccines believe live virus vaccines activate natural immune response.

There two problems here. First, drawing distinction difference. reaction mRNA vaccine produces ""natural"" reaction induced live virus. Second, ardently arguing favor particular vaccine regimen, fervor backed faith feelings, actual expertise. Simply put, qualified sort opinion this, unless completed least undergraduate education immunology, preferably even that. 

You would wise rely knowledge, judgement, expertise medical community. need badly. can’t wait members family finally vaccinated. people resistant updating knowledge, based observation, others. j&amp;j one shot make approval faster? would much assume j&amp;j operates similarly one shot AZ. info might done differently Oxford make first shot efficacious? guess death rates still low many African countries compared parts Americas Europe. fearmongered^ True, one cares local politicians elections. Sadly. fine state doing

Then care comparison? Honestly (please downvote messenger) know lives change. Healthcare settings still focing masks, tempature checks, screenings regardless patient type, reason vistit even type facility. matter vaccine not, even every single person faculty has. given indication things end. 

I feeling told day would change many would way inclined so.

This feeling. objectively People trying force us shame getting vaccine, still much about.

In Fall USA goes back full open schools. includes state international students mass colleges, full dorms, etc. schools plan distancing, etc. States like Texas restricted ant state funded entity, includes schools colleges, even requiring masks.

August September likely going largest surges see since vax started. Without vax age group, risk huge step backwards country, especially state 70%, sadly looks like many states literally even past 50% point.

If friends family age group, best help get vaccinated.

On bright side, get past September without major issues, basically done..No event near future likely dangerous again.  less better odds know feel this. doesn’t hurt data ready next one too…sooner later we’ll get something new w/o vaccine masks probably work respiratory infections. pandemic started  doctors wanting use African test bed possible vaccines.

“Or someone tests positive covid” test? Pcr? Again, it’s cute don’t debate efficacy pcr test reply, even though linked rudimentary video explaining pcr tests, even child could fathom. 

If entire premise testing covid positive (the pcr test) flawed, everything else comes skewed data. 

I acquaintance believed covid never got tested. life person lived quite unheathy, supposed disregard context covids severity? No, that’s scientific. virus comes kills people eat McDonald’s everyday, no, I’m going take virus seriously don’t eat McDonald’s everyday, allow affected take health seriously.

Sorry that’s statistics work kiddo. degree evidence support claim? comment overall explaining basic science you, understand you’ll know covid really serious.

Going vegan automatically always cause weight loss, absolutely causal relationship. Exactly. Last checked 49th 50 states vaccinations. Mississippi good news though know two-dose mRNA vaccine like Pfizer Moderna — get doses — appear effective Delta variant also poses greater risk young people, aren’t getting vaccinated quickly age groups.

Here's hoping... happy cake day way April, 47 members National Association Attorneys General sent CEOs Twitter, Shopify eBay letter requesting take immediate action bad actors spreading COVID-19 misinformation using sites sell fake vaccine cards. letter read, ""The false deceptive marketing sales fake COVID vaccine cards threatens health communities, slows progress getting residents protected virus, violation laws many states.""

No, that. single instance text “table 4” can’t figure find search function interested teaching you. Agreed. lockdown sceptical side especially can't see even consider personal risk virus small (although granted good portion population quite large!), risk serious adverse effects vaccine least *a thousand times smaller*. exact kind reasoning used argue focused protection, seem fallen trap poor relative risk assessment. head in, loudly complain fearmongering virus ones fearmongering vaccines!

Now, could argue Bayes' Theorem multiply exposure risk risk death/serious disease get actual risk level time covid, (for younger people) would justify risk/benefit balance. understand dealing pandemic without vaccine would require large number people get *at point* - words, passing 'recovered' compartment Kermack-McKendrick model somehow, infection vaccination. better latter former.

Ditto Tucker. vaccinated, family vaccinated, yet goes TV every night rants evils vaccine.  People recovered virus’ predecessor, SARS-1 still immunity today, something like 15 years later. reason believe immunity would fade quickly SARS-2?

You can’t compare coronavirus flu, caused rhinovirus. Rhinoviruses fast-evolving viruses. Coronavirus complex, built “self correcting” replication feature. virus replicates, second mechanism kicks “proofreads” code try correct errors. makes coronaviruses much stable less prone replicative mutations. Though mutations happen, quickly.

It’s likely immunity fading day. case, lot people would likely see point taking vaccine, also would confer lasting immunity. like people never bothered taking yearly flu shots. UK areas concentrated outbreak delta variant. It’s common cause cases. UK delayed second doses number people give people least one shot. pushing vaccination hard.

It’s crazy people believe country produces 20% global GDP second highest population wouldn’t tackling problem quickly. It’s like people want China drag feet fits narrative. learned months ago. sure news. vaccinated would still mask. nearly robust data reinfections versus vaccinated. rooting 4 u vermont &lt;3 vaccination rate get better, could vulnerable another outbreak. Shoulda arrested 3rd. Whatever takes Thanks. data find don’t even strong opinion UK delta variant. could beginning new wave, result targeted sequencing, imported cases abroad knows else (I saying hypotheses likely true, I’m listing first ones came mind).

In fact still probably early research groups reached firm conclusions. confident research published soon. Apparently not. comment explaining would gap, even politics play got removed. AutoMod blood. taiwan one peacful tourist places earth. Send idiot back belongs dont need that, Well can't use FDA still approved blocked J&amp;J doses.

The report 5 days late that. I’m sure plays huge part. I’m going sit say J&amp;J useless, everyone Ohio that’s eligible also eligible Pfizer Moderna. became eligible, able choose because, like people, didn’t become eligible supply increased. chose Pfizer. It’s much effective vaccine. 

Take get, choice? That’s different story. [international travel &amp; often already require vaccinations.

The slight difference ""new"" vaccine yet full FDA approval. Full FDA approval right around corner, though, different vaccination requirements commonly found society. Texas absolutely fine 100% open, nothing cry Lol first comment literally starting blame game US surplus, Africa need. There's solution somewhere... Nah bro, sides equally blame problems.
 
I intelligent. appreciate post. feel like I'll get vaccinated later, reading vaccine reactions recovered individuals intense makes want least wait. I'll read links gave me. That's exactly live. Many county officials told residents enforcing state mandates within counties' limits residents visitors counties consider Covid prevention measures strictly voluntary. people regularly wore masks ones chose took seriously. ones got vaccinated soon could. people never wore masks unless absolutely get ones never get vaccinated, ones refused anything protect vulnerable people said ""let sickly scared stay home, live lives freedom"". made choice opt pandemic management year ago. time let go let live consequences choice. Either vaccines work choose get protected, they're not. can't keep wringing hands fretting actions people care. unvaccinated won’t listen ever place child motor vehicle? They're literally 4 times likely die car accident COVID.

Everyone's risk tolerance completely ridiculous comes one disease. Man fuck cancer. Much love family.

You’ve nailed it. Sap’s pretty much similar climates. comes skill people boiling blending. you’re picky, find particular shack like buy stuff. like Parker’s Mason, NH, may it’s grew with.

If hard time accepting problem, theirs. subreddit assured ""masks vaccinated"" guidance would cause people get vaccinated, would remove incentive anti-mask anti-vaxx people even acknowledge COVID exists. always mean freedom, someone else's.

""I undeniable right gun want"" often believed people think ""Of course cop shot black guy, might gun!"" think able license existing Covid vaccine new ""natural"" brand made up, could get people take it? 

What would look like? Masks (cloth surgical) never meant solution long term exposure, quick interactions mixed social distancing vaccination drive.

In everything I've observed, seems under-appreciated point.

This study good, one hand, observes real-life behavior (as opposed stuff like mannequins compressed air blowers). means account human error.

But hand, observes behavior results limited time interval (a minute half talking test, 30 seconds coughing test).

What happens human error factor expand 4 8 hours continuous mask-wearing?

Also: mask efficiency blocking droplets emitted talking 70%, much time continuous exposure pass protective effect masking obviated? droplets blocked breathing (which measured % effective study, know smaller less forwardly propelled respiratory droplets less effectively blocked masks)?

How real-world risk compensation play this? people choose spend dangerously long intervals continuous close contact assumed protective effect masks 5 minutes 5 hours? think maybe correct distinction associate's degree bachelor science (BSN) studies. imagine associate's degree focus much science aspect healthcare, BSNs lumped RN title since take registry exam. Excellent. nursing college remove licenses too. think variance syrups one state actually larger difference averages different state.

I mad one happens irrelevant ideal timeline measures Yesterday.  American. can't govt make mandatory get vaccination? suspect people stiffly opposing vaccines flexible future.. know anecdotal hell, friends mine, LA I'm friends family 3yo 5yo become ill COVID last summer. \*sick\* five days: 104-105 fevers continuously, cognitively affected, bad coughs. termed mild symptoms doctors parents instructed go hospital. year ago one kids still lingering fatigue, ""just himself,"" etc. Looks pale wan dark circles. symptoms still diagnosed way doctors assume reported. think important keep information points mind well media reporting kids, hell—even adults! NYC friend COVID early ""mild symptoms"" (she very, sick) still breath talks stands still able get half calories per hour workouts pre-covid. symptoms reported way, either. 


My point awful lot things want happen kids hiding stats indicate kids vulnerable COVID. feelings purposefully choose get vaccine even though you’re able to, sympathy whatever happens contract COVID-19. 🤷🏻‍♀️ First thing said approved vaccine. dick pill guys stopping pandemic  Gal, thanks! 9 months pregnant planning mini road trip hit fav VT breweries drink mobile again. cannot wait. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article like vaccination rates skyrocketed got worse area. 80,000 cases. Medical reasons getting vaccine different category.  know people can’t get vaccinated they’re allergic preservatives used. 

But cannot get vaccinated suffer consequences regardless.  like someone short theme park ride, it’s health safety issue. threat hospitals run. probably wont happen. probably zero threat. disagree want. Got first moderna shot 2 weeks ago, looks like get 2nd sooner rather later. travel since lifted 14 day quarantine. hospitalizations deaths going significantly too? going realize largely vaccinated population, number cases really matter.

For rest world's sake, hope UK set terrible precedent. Case numbers *will* go restrictions lifted. expect this. key *it matter.* Welp, sucks US 2nd shot, that’s case. actually tend send home here, hospital gets reimbursed three days taking care covid patient. Sorry, mom lifelong nurse handles peoples outpatient care discharge options, trying act like know know anecdotal. want need be(Covid spreads hospitals like wildfire compared places).

I'm hoping right though, bad NYC I'm sure sent people home actually probably needed care, would getting point time. Delta variant spreading around(Think dumb fooks unvaxxed maskless now) concerning. welcome! hope info helps out. bottom line though benefit wearing mask someone already vaccinated virtually nonexistent. Yes, extra protection, probably unnecessary protection. 

I wear helmet driving car, indeed make marginally safer, really mitigating risk vs. inconvenience caused.  would question easy actually many trained dogs plus handlers actually available type work. Sure that's fair. I'm NYC case numbers less 200 day. feel perfectly comfortable going without mask point India... variant seems hit children higher rate.  sure agree prevention fatigue. lived 2020, majority people diligent wearing masks whole time, despite *single* local case 300 days.

Anyone else position? Yes. Follow science

you irrationally cautious it’s hurting people never said single mutation, takes lot mutations time. Point trying make people still smart, get vaccinated It’s almost money resources secure better life. mean took global pandemic figure out. country epidemic victimhood. FML… I’m going get 3rd shot safe. sign up? Gah! entire point!!!! :(

Should make decisions based actions others? No, I’ve said much couple times now.

Should make decisions based upon reality situation - ie case counts? *YES.*

It doesn’t matter *why* case counts high (unvax’d people), matters act accordance fact indeed high. Germany promised 10 doses end June far got less 2 M. Ship over. doesn’t. Good way get banned kind false statement. Everyone right mind stating lab leak much table, obviously nothing proven one way other

Why insulting basically call conspiracy theory? level as, say, Covid invented Bill Gates That's crazy, wear masks time work already? guess stuff lot extra paperwork geez dumb reason right? Canadians? country origin matter fully vaccinated people? Yes has. Well shit apeshit anti-vaxxers gone avoiding it. Evidence? realize already requiring masks everyone mass transit, hospitals, schools, prisons, even vaccinated? 

So you’re saying pointless isn’t going happen already happening. question cases rebound, delta variants, much line gets adjusted, include grocery stores stores example.  Propaganda Facebook made people completely crazy. They're causing percentage people infected become hospitalized double? states drop measurable goals reopen anyway? Pretty simple really. Get vaccinated risk potential serious injury death.

Wife NP. Patients dying Covid 19, last breaths saying ""I Covid...""

Viruses care Democrat, Republican Libertarian... looking another host - destroy. Many countries Africa also problems [expiring vaccine multifaceted issue availability causing situation things like general poor condition health infrastructure vaccine hesitancy. solution needs include aspects. can't done places, doses distributed elsewhere time.  unconstitutional?

Area man passionate defender images Constitution be.

I guess easy imagine section Constitution orders private businesses on-campus safety procedures, least long never read Constitution. never happened pathogen ever.

Well doubt that. licensing selling it. isn’t service, company locally producing vaccine making profit. virus continues spread, no?

Anyone who’s reddit able access case numbers local them. big kid make decisions self. case numbers bad enough warrant wearing mask still, wear mask still. you’re lucky enough place they’ve become significantly reduced - great! Go live life maskless knowing don’t worry much.

I don’t problem people taking available factual information making decisions based upon said information. moment process turns making decisions emotionally based people (or not) longer support decision-making.

That’s sort whole point - nobody forcing wear mask anymore, doesn’t make less effective tool combating spread disease. scientific basis mask usage support people areas high circulation virus, vaccinated not, mandated not. see someone become indignant people taking one mitigation measure(s) (vaccines) person forgone another (masks) led feel really voicing frustration clearly. doesn’t impact directly moment, I’m still going try caution person way addressing frustration drive divide people perceive disagreement, exacerbating problem, making angrier prone lashing frustration, et cetera. Oh, doubt would unpopular, that's indicative stupidity short-sightedness predominant American culture. something proud used point tough pill swallow things lives outweigh lives aggregate

Perhaps, driving slightly slower way would essentially unnoticeable difference one's travel time rational conception case.  got sauce not-so-hot hot take? Wish would look J&amp;J Pfizer/Moderna. really bad. ever hangover get vaccine. temporary gives peace mind need worry reinfection. US, get annual well-woman, pap, etc NP great. Pretty sure Texas right work state, people leg stand get fired.  Considering found Italian blood samples given October 2019 expressing Sars-CoV-2 antibodies, theory bunch workers Wuhan research facility introduced global public November 2019 seems rather ridiculous. I'll add, could easily regional/social graph effects. Imagine hundred people, 80 immune 20 not. 10 20 vaccinated good buddies. one 10 gets it, get it.

Now imagine 100 people, 80 immune, 20 not. 20 perfectly mixed up. They're mostly friends other, fact, even good friends another non-immune person. One gets sick, burns out. One gets sick, burns out.


When formulaic version herd immunity assume second. since vaccination random, based values beliefs (which families friends tend share); always actually something closer first case. easily say London cases blowing up, let's say Kent massive breakout. Maybe 95% vaccinated London, 60% Kent.

I'm guessing efficacy vaccine matters lot too. 80% vaccinated 100% immune, maybe they're even 70% immune. youth, even discussing, they're much part social graph. even they're less efficient transmitters imagine they're still better transmitters vaccinated adult.  probably already dominant. Luckily Pfizer makes fix well. is...not true though. Many hospital environments may still forcing things like masks, healthcare settings Ridic Ok. this..... 8.1 cases per 100,000. 4 cases per 100,000. UK numbers really low. spike seems scary. means even think control, isn't. 

I guess see month two past weeks blip, start another wave. time tell. Colorado, they're giving away million dollars every Friday 5 weeks. Anyone who's vaccinated automatically entered.

Still, vaccine numbers continue drop. certainly violation human rights health care worker intentionally put patients risk refusing vaccinations. really exist centralized medical records, rather doctor maintains patient records.

The physician lobby groups fought physicians issue certificate vaccinations supposedly much work, lobbied become *the* pillar German vaccination campaign ""they know patients best"". result stupidity. mean, people asked go core values pretty minuscule incentives. Don’t get wrong, anti-vax values completely stupid, it’s people believe. Aside handful lazys, unvaccinated people getting vaccinated unless physically strap down.  Considering easily train dogs sniff people covid, airports this? seems practical effective me. mother immuno compromised almost died Covid. doctor make sure friend much protection possible.

Apologies barking without knowing info believe mentioning already faces problems, without covid it’s “just get vaccinated”

If everyone else could get vaccinated get cases low kids spend summers normally.  nurses definitely educated areas, say vaccine? concerns heard? Many  made think LOTS health care providers get vaccinated. 

Personally, believe terminated, least allowed deal patients. Hence, one make point asking person who's providing services they've jabbed.  fairness think reasonable strategy based knew efficacy single dose previous dominant (alpha) variant, [which around 

The new dominant (delta) variant takes massive efficacy hit single dose, comparison. imagine course changed situation changed. 

On hand, linked article suggests single dose still lowers hospitalisations 70%. know absolute numbers deaths hospitalisations would worse given second doses still completely unvaccinated people. stupid we're daddy Sorry hear that. cousin tried convince heart inflammation, blood clots side effects. would suggest let talk doctor cautious information web. C’mon, you’re selling state short. Vermont cold place non-Canadian maple syrup comes from! hospital setting literally seeing people definition vulnerable. know without shadow doubt virus contagious 36 hour window symptom onset many many cases. isn’t complicated people making be. We’ve year. I’m guessing it’s joke regarding variants named greek letters. Gut science. authoritarian shithole lol reference, Manitoba's vaccination rate first doses among eligible people 12 older currently 69.2%, slightly Canada's average 71.6%. sums accommodate Canadians returning home/visit family rather international tourists.

Until country gets double dosed, it'll slow rollout. vast majority vaccine side effects/adverse effects present within weeks. Especially way MRNA vaccines work, delayed effect four years would basically impossible. Well, maybe herd get thinned less ignorance. overarching issue media literacy. need learn dissect propaganda - get habit taking ego bait.

Good luck. vaccines? Lots. almost like conditions change... Here's model: mutation increases virus's reproduction rate organism. Viral load increases. Transmission increases. amount virus organism fight larger, disease severe.

I know that's case, see reason *couldn't* case. course. don’t dispute increase 1-7 important, saying 700% increase feels different paints different picture person reading article looking numbers. care New York Times, supposed provide information facts non biased way, making decidedly biased decision reporting way. Again, I’m arguing data, saying shouldn’t reported on, isn’t important relevant, I’m expressing frustration misleading statements kind. sent lot home crisis really border safe discharge. didn’t capacity cases stretched thin, got hands care home. 

With hospitals back normal admit borderline people. mom 5 kids can’t convalesce home kids won’t give break. Admitting three days means recover week vs month. older man reasonable 02 sat lost 30 pounds last two weeks. Technically none people met criteria crisis. benefit admission Haha yeah friend immunosuppressed would agree 100% irresponsible doc recommend 3rd dose. Apparently doc take antibody test cell test prior recommending third dose also, came back nearly undetectable levels, suggested third dose. sounds like taking pretty reasonable approach things considered. lack vaccine. people dont want it. let get sick then? ideas get antivax family change minds?

It EXACTLY works. compared control group unvaccinated people. numbers cited comparison unvaccinated. two, even breakthrough cases chances getting severely ill basically zero.

Well no, breakthrough cases similar greater death rates normal cases. confounding factors though, great data serious deaths breakthrough cases. way off, fair. I'm Vermonter, born raised.

Yep, entire Asia Africa go Chinese Russians. hell pneumonia flu shots mandatory? know US, aren't. anyone say otherwise?  previous poster's point many ""fully vaccinated Canadians"" seeking enter Canada (probably them, least first) Canadians living United States, CDC cards. government's announced policy refers Canadian citizens, residents Canada, can't depend availability Canadian health records.

Regardless relative number vaccinated v unvaccinated cases, .02% people fully vaccinated died. sample size 267 small small irrelevant. punch line imho still true: odds dying fully vaccinated low. may be, think it’s likely it’s combination two factors.

Firstly close links India, many seed cases. Cases rising places, it’s spreading fast. 

Secondly, 30s unvaccinated. 95+ coverage elderly vulnerable. younger people socialise spread still high. 

The USA (am assuming there?) number fully partially vaccinated, spread age, transmission lower.  Yep... Africa South Asia well. vaccinations right now. Every bit support count them... No, you’re not. 

If you’re fully vaccinated, take test arrival self isolate waiting negative results. it’s back, free return normal.   fuck would u call out. China reopened mean people hang stores open since last May. Good. Vaxx neighbors North South first. 

That help across many levels - tourism, economics, business, etc. Im guessing point towards combating social side this, wearing masks becoming normalized again.

Not vaccine strategy Kids twelve eligible vaccines. minors ages 12-18, parental consent required states. kids eligible &amp; willing get vaccine may blocked anti-vaxx parent(s). risk kids hospitalized Covid low zero. actually seems little annoying get info covid vaccine infosheet MSDH publishes since directly reported. figure many 18+ fully vaccinated, look 18+ population (2,276,754) get 39% adults fully vaccinated, similar ""at least one dose"" number get 43% adults 18+. Since infosheet pdf even that's little bit hassle. Interestingly either typo true error say J&amp;J shot goes one dose fully vaccinated buckets (which would double count them). There's huge number J&amp;J shots tremendous difference I'm filled confidence reporting.

Contrast with, example, MD, percent (current 71+%) first item shown dashboard.

Anyways, cdc vaccine tracker website pretty good similar numbers MS got (I'm guessing different population estimate), even looking one dose 18+ only, MS still deadass last. AL close second last! anti-vaxxers Republicans, (thwarting Biden goal) incentive get vaccine?  liked going Vermont. like banned going Vermont Covid lived area less Covid Vermont. know cases, data hospitalizations regard vaccines. tiny fraction people hospital double dosed, well within bounds previously expected. Vaccines remain best way this. 

That said, hospitalizations among unvaccinated become high enough people protected two doses, still cause problems even they're mainly young people likely survive. Tying huge numbers resources like hospital beds ambulances never good thing! prevent huge hospital wave delay two weeks last step reopening (as one rather reliable data wranglers UK covid subreddit suggested may case) seems worth it. worries, agreement points nonetheless (in context intended, Canadians traveling US)   fair, manufactured it.

Greenland likely wont reason new variant, India’s churning right now.  different symptoms really different enough, yeah. r/killthosewhodisagree propaganda thinking vaccines medically safe Well since first doses pretty close finished shipments double total received Moderna doses, hopefully means everyone got Moderna first shot get second next month so. reading it, believe context boils ""if group cannot verify know 100% present vaccinated, easier safer everyone mask up."" rooted practicality science safe inoculated, understand. situations allow full getting individuals vaccination status. 

Basically doubt, easier mask verify vax status groups 10+ people. Science ""belief"" mix

Science says know came from. science also says likely come nature.

Throwing belief creates dangerous misinformation narratives pandemic officially me! start 2020 track finally become airline pilot decade hard work training. make summer would (regional airlines hiring like crazy). COVID happened watched helplessly taken fingertips. Mentally broken prepared another 2008-like situation impossible get hired anywhere industry.  


I received job offer! Thanks amazing vaccines set back year. I'm glad side! muscle pain, headache, fatigue starting hour second injection lasting 4-6 hours. side effects first injection.

Most stories I've read people getting vaccine side effects (from approved vaccine) say they're getting starting next day. Side effects day probably placebo effect.

You get unblinded. got real vaccine, think stay study. 

If got placebo, recommend drop get approved vaccine, point crazy willingly stay vulnerable COVID.

I think anyone knows happens got actual Curevac vaccine get BioNTech Moderna one later. guess nothing lucky really unpleasant side effects not. 

If get approved vaccine, need tell study doctor, remove study ... obviously longer useful data point. Canadian confirmed protecting inhale I'm near someone without mask? assume seal necessary case? realize vaccine stop getting covid, right? vaccine *no means* cure.

You're asking repercussions may future something data accumulated long. anyone answer accurately without speculating essentially creating circle jerk ""what if"" scenarios?

I agree mrna vaccine clever generally solid design, mean going remain way.

In addition that, emergency use certainly *does not* contain rigor FDA approval (which FDA approved vaccines yet). accelerate access treatments increase chance missed opportunities research, delay critical data even cause damage/harm receiver. learned med school studying meta-static breast cancer treatment 90s.

I think FDA made right decision considering EUAs, another complication redirection funding. example, covid seen *600* EUAs (That absolutely wild) ended pulling funds resources away PPE causing shortages possibly deaths nationwide due access issues. also set precedence future EUAs granted times pandemic absolutely harmful. Ex: Hydroxycloroquine EUA seen safe way prevent covid 19. Fast forward today FDA since rescinded EUA new emerging health data comes pursuit FDA approval part EUA process.

One problem highlight confidence body. FDA *huge* political pressure blast EUAs approvals vaccines. concerning 1. seeming come one two parties 2. creates unnecessary pressure jeopardize integrity treatment production treatment. public health perspective (me psychiatrist) create doubt general public government may best interest mind one reasons black community high vaccine hesitancy rate. Congress actually worsens problem guilt shame others getting vaccinated opposed purely scientific empathetic approach.

TLDR - end day, scientific rigor important comes health data. FDA approval process perfect, significantly different better EUA - simply thing. speculate want chemical composition effects known (which interesting fun discussion), remember treatments initially start way dramatically different end due new data long term scientific rigor.  I'm Houston people absolutely still wearing masks everywhere. aren't, good people starting get vaccinated going maskless big deal soon. I've done takeout eaten since last March super excited people start get vaccinated. already am, hurt wait vaccination rates go up. virus mutates, becomes less lethal, spreads faster. always case(Spanish flu thought mutate hellscape WW1 ditches, making transmissible lethal time) time does. That's scientists freaking variants, lethality less. many people getting infected, run higher chance mutate something deadlier. reason AZ work South African variant?

Has changed? kept AZ SA variant two-dose regimen ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine show protection mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due B.1.351 variant.

Much cheaper. Ha ha thought could get away Taiwan thats United States.  proving point? draconian shutdowns “Rules thee me” Whitmer tanked Michigan economy  point, want Covid, get vaccinated. simple. &lt;plane let's unload prisoner. Huh. sure onboard left Taiwan? hospital Delta variant unvaccinated 20 per cent received one dose.

20% hospitalizations received dose vaccine is… great. first doses first strategy really working Delta Dunn-Walters, chair British Society Immunology’s Covid-19 task force, advised Sage, told FT: “We thus appear race giving two vaccine doses everyone versus spread Delta variant.”  smoke weed every day never issue wearing masks. wearing thicker K-N95 too. Clearly know ""Freedom"" about... /s speculation less surveillance testing done. current people virus likely symptomatic therefore likely hospitalized. know also delta variant could factor well whole point particular comment thread though doctors saying you’re *NOT* done you’ve vaccinated.

Here’s original way limiting spread vaccinated wear masks around not, doctors say.

Nowhere say unvaccinated people skip mask shift burden entirely *are* vaccinated, simply says mask wearing still adds greater degree protection, even individual already vaccinated. It’s pretty simple concept. you. problem is, unfortunately, UK’s “first doses first” strategy reliance AstraZeneca. single dose 33% effective strain, two doses AZ 60% effective. (Pfizer 88% effective two doses.). also hurts rollout strictly age ranges, leaving young adults basically community protection.

When UK decided lengthen dosage interval, many people concerned exactly situation might emerge, it’s disheartening foreseeable still occurred. UK shortened second dose window 8 weeks, definitely help, vaccination effort race time currently losing. Okay, I’m going write one time I’m done. I’m sure game you’re clearly understanding this. 

They ordered bake cakes. commission ruled **against** ordered make cakes without discrimination. fact. 

The courts rule **in favour** bakery. favour ruling would “the baker allowed discriminate gays due religious reasons bake cakes”

The Supreme Court instead **overruled commission unbiased**. ruling bakery right. 

Regardless facts, hope agree discrimination gays wrong. 

Anyway, good day. ""ugly American""

If nothing else, wear mask. suppose... like headcanon better. Maybe I'm masochist.  Shameless plug next door neighbors, Purinton Maple Syrup. I've tried lot syrup day, best. neighbors drink cup day put coffee. Vermont. joke ;P  It’s really hard properly fit n95 child. It’s hard enough adults make masks.

Just another way children left pandemic response There's like 200 million tax payers US talking 500 million doses @ ~15$ per pop. suck math. found another anti-masker. blocked downvoted. someone told March “just get vaccinated” would probably point aren’t eligible Hearts minds. smart move. Sorry, ""I got mine-fuck-you"" come play talking virus still much fuck us due tourism travel. 


Try look beyond once. beds 

Litterally, them... Yeah, label ""loaning"" doses Canada Mexico political cover make feel palatable US citizens. bad thing, though. wise policy, administration needs use creative labeling keep headlines it. Good. kind foreign aid get behind fully support. yeah... gut biome big one too. matter liability, point companies freedom employ vaccinated. likely. see countries stepping plate let alone extra doses lying around.  Trump pro vaccine talk getting it, sad many supporters won’t get saying ""a lab leak much table"" pangs bad faith ""just asking questions"" type discourse.  Chuck Australia, completely fucked vaccine rollout barely started. massive lockdown campaign last year. 


In lockdown right cause we're like 1% population. I'm sorry say want people die but, natural selection. Thats best way it! People sub short-sighted. Kids even vaccinated immunocompromised good position. I'm pretty pissed Biden admin/CDC prematurely telling vaccinated take masks knew damn well floodgates would open. messaging start 70% first doses threshold us remove masks. would put social pressure vaxxed unvaxxed. Kinda surprised got downvoted much. google though, Moderna done good vitro research topic, concluded booster likely needed based decrease effectiveness time goes on. 
Pfizer Fauci stated similar things. google ""booster"" names find articles it. 

Moderna also showed use booster help restore immunity Beta variant (South African) still best evading immune response. 

I guess science say inevitable, points towards strong possibility. happen. know wishful fantasy ideal world Pfizer would donate them.  Conversely, also shown spreading immunization breed fertile ground strands may mutate variant existing vaccines longer effective. Pfizer vaccine effective variants still...if uncontrolled spread continues may end variant brings us back squre 1.

Edit: comment mess get point. Love it.    Nice I'm looking right I'm seeing saying. Delta one concerning variants right news articles I'm finding says fully vaccinated still well protected. Here's one I'm hesitant post news source, I've found 88% pfizer thrown many doses Pfizer vaccine shown 88% effective Delta variant, two doses AstraZeneca shot shown 60% effective strain, according NIH data.  Wouldn’t want give short end stick. avoiding war metric successful country? realize less covid around world directly good Americans, right? Antibody testing poor method identifying first appearance virus. high risk cross-reactivity. Ah, America! remember this. missed you.  DC state still part US. Better idea  That’s kinda murica works days. meaningless sample size 2 deaths. again, lucky 2 deaths either way difference twice high looking like 100% protective. Nobody saying Biden personally purchased 500MM doses. that's interpret article, that's you. even like guy, that's absurd claim. It’s huge help stop possible variants. we’re vaxxed lots places aren’t, good variant pops vax doesn’t stop. We’ve already seen quickly spreads. need vax globally quick possible. Good ensures current vax isn’t waste. doubt get point hospitals maxed capacity transfer across state lines.

I think statewide hospital systems collapse definitely think regional ones anti-vaxx areas yet again. many places last winter/summer statewide hospital collapses (Arizona notable example, shipping people state New Mexico California) also many regional collapses. former prevented vaccines, latter think keep happening. Like hospitals Idaho panhandle slammed people sent Spokane even far Portland/Seattle sending Boise would take long. 

I could definitely see people Cheyenne WY carted Denver area, people Sioux Falls Fargo taken Minneapolis, Detroiters taken Chicago. could new seasonal thing hospitals anticipate forced treat anti-vaxxers.  Us gov sends money aid tons nations, it’s expected Thank generous $1.47 sacrifice. Truly paragon humanity. China investing heavily infrastructure Africa, basically done Breakthrough case data highly misleading. I'll give example:

Lets say one people vaccine stop getting COVID. Lets say end getting COVID 5 months now.

Well, 5 months would counting me, erroneously, someone protected vaccine since gotten sick yet. 

Now, regarding ages....that's basically without vaccine well. Older immunocompromised people much higher death rates entire pandemic.  sneaking suspicion doses paid back ""loan"" end COVAX directly donated somewhere. ""loans"" ""forgiven"" entirely. US never admin without war. lifetime, least.   saw somewhere else thread quote $14/dose. sure valid. Freedom thee! Especially black, brown, gay, woman, poor, well connected, trust scientific method.  amounts used. Aluminum pretty biologically inert. It’s third common element earth’s crust, oxygen silicon. don’t use metabolic process tolerate well clear quickly. dose TdaP vaccine less 0.39mg aluminum. Less 40mg/kg/d shown nontoxic, even infant well threshold.

But seems enough set pattern recognition receptors trigger immune response. Someone's got pay.

If countries money, they'd already vaccines. Exactly. Reading comments thread annoying me. nurse wants get vaccine not, that's issue. Especially since many already covid. think probably risks getting vaccine already covid antibodies. They've earned right choose get not. interesting read... many details laid give credence Biden Administration's pressure China full disclosure lab conditions Wuhan. paper's author necessarily blaming China bio-engineering lethal contagious strain, rather saying may well byproduct vitro studies coronaviruses. course speculative, puts onus China's public health authorities prove lab conditions safe proper protocols followed. refusal fully cooperate &amp; open labs scrutiny scientific community can't rule escape theory out. either/or. now. still handled pretty much everything virus million times better western idiocracy.  it’s going cost money I’d rather spend billions protecting world billions bombing it.

well, unfortunately either/or scenario; paying regardless whether want to. kidding? Dumb people fuck like rabbits. Heaven forbid someone loving relationship. think merely ""The Boy Cries Wolf Syndrome"" warnings keep issued never pan out, folks stop believing warnings.

I think press responsibility report news sensationalize news either.

Things problem maybe better way look it, like heads variant concern, know problem yet, becomes problem let know.

Or maybe talking butt.

Edited correct grammar. lab work artificial way, also carefully constructed remove variables order measure something specifically. replicate drinking coffee together exactly, one deduce coffee drinking situation fundamental things revealed lab test still effect. Even though wearing motorcycle helmet still die receive traumatic brain injury crash. Still wear helmet.

See works? C'mon people, *really* want mouth-breathers getting vaxx reproducing they've spent year crying survival fittest? Let's think through.  good data much helps even get sick

this sounds like classic moving goal posts dont like happening.  Good point. Stats tricky. can’t tell likely twice-vaccinated people catch it, OTOH death rate still representative.  At-will employment state. Unvaccinated federally protected class. also recklessly endangering patient safety.

Hopefully terminated cause shortly. Got first half... gonna lie. I’m single good ladies Ha! see  article lacks information whether signficant number already-vaccinated going hospital Indian variant.

I think, U.K., U.S. given caring people stupid get shots.

If charge, I'd make people get shots, punish allowing go anywhere job without shot. there's political what's necessary good society. brother (RN)’s girlfriend (also RN) refuses get thinks it’s going impact fertility. Apparently hasn’t read impact Covid fertility. least brother it. Nah I’m guy much time hands making inappropriate jokes ask...  Sounds like natural selection. die remove gene pool. Could first wave firings. Folks health care interact quite vulnerable people either can't get vaccine due allergies, immune supressed, vaccine far fully protective. health care worker, preventing spread vulnerable populations extra important. it’s “just get vaccinated”

It is, everyone eligible.

The way wait April, 12's wait May, 12's unfortunately waiting game still.

For everyone else, ""just get vaccinated"" applies look abortion issue...

make law ensure woman right body, allow unvaccinated mask wearing too? Crazy shit. Life really find way, mind-numbingly gullible people refuse take vaccine D-list celebrity approve end able procreate. Self interest. world better America. Except probably Trump US president would done thing. may correct also assuming alot. Could woman, could they're celibate, could dick blown freak accident Mentos Coke.  heard lots Californians moving Idaho maybe state begin shift politically way Colorado, New Mexico Arizona did. Several provinces given go-ahead interchange mRNA vaccines. Also, many got AZ first dose going getting mRNA second dose. getting Pfizer second dose (got AZ April) would happy either Moderna Pfizer. Pool people second doses even greater got first dose. personally know people unaffected contracting covid. colleague expecting baby 8 months. Another friend recovered covid horny before. shares links group guys still college. one infer hes fine.

But note this. said never wish anyone would suffer it. fucking vaccine atleast available, would taken it. questions asked.

You guys US privileged enough get vaccine. Thus understand anger. vaccine. may easily spill next year vaccinated lab leak theory might true, might be. know, really care. 

What *do* care companies like Facebook removing references lab leak theory ""misinformation,"" go back later change minds. can't trust social media companies absolute arbiters ""truth"" ""misinformation,"" get things wrong. virus always seek unguarded person. new variants easier catch. 96% new infections unvaccinated. virus could mutate again, longer find home. That's vaccination does, denies entry, denies mutation. Sorry see downvotes. great, lol'd. true... China also widely uses Sputnik V locally manufactured AZ.

There also enother vax called, Sputnik V Lite. used Chinese frontline workers get immunity going.

There may vaccines use well. good data much helps even get sick.

We lot data, enough say helps 95%. huh? ppl kids age 12.. makes harder lmfao went exact thing. Wife bought house April 2020, August 2020 shit hit hard, ED all. went lot things similar said, since I've never mental breakdown anxiety attacks were, definitely battle me. I've never contracted COVID, locked long definitely affected us  crazy varied symptoms people. worst experienced 2 days flu like symptoms, lost sense smell taste 2 days well. it. Everything else fine, thankfully.

Sorry hear rough time had, embarrassing think story sounds, worth leaving others see possibly happen catch thing! like rich brother hooks up! Go cry Wearing mask doesn’t protect COVID. protects spreading people. think embarrassed all. like chose get sick. you? point even? I'm saying I'm done masks, adults area vaccinated. Keep wearing fuckin thing stay home long like, joining  Ah, mistake much 500 million Pfizer vaccines cost?  Wechat Alipay abusing power get data, big bad CCP brother watching you. two big companies(Tencent Alibaba) like 10 times evil counterpart Facebook Amazon. post letting fully vaccinated Canadians abroad back Canada without requiring quarantine two weeks, letting Canadians US. nothing people wearing masks staying home? Exactly think claimed says?

God, can’t wait prove wrong. followed footsteps Corona beer. difference covid problem solution implemented within around 2 years problems take decades solve... weird statement isn’t simple people kids say “just get vaccinated”"
