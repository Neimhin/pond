The main issue life outside work crushed significantly. want able go things freely like used to. vaccines already proving cut transmission among vaccinated people presumably unvaccinated well, look what's going Israel.

As vaccinated people start mixing rest society transmission rates start going staying down, bye-bye, long COVID. can’t ‘come back’ it’s always 3 months California going look ‘very close normal’ ‘minimal restrictions’ lol. hell fucking arrested, extreme prejudice? Best tell, apples oranges comparison.

[City Melbourne 170k 5M number metro population. LA metro population 13M. 

Note: I'm arguing poster's point, pointing comparison really accurate. one Brazil similar South African one, educated guess says vaccines similarly effective.

It would take *several* mutations like SA BR variants virus escape immunity completely. know virus, right things soon, we're one that's going history like dinosaurs. Mutations make virus go weaker, seen lately seems mutants agressif. mean, would good give eventually I'd hope citizens country want get first CDC’s website listed variant, Jan 28. Dunno that’s relevant it’s credibility thought I’d make known. No. You’re logic well thought out. can’t ways. lot Americans really understand amount extensive government work support went mitigating COVID successfully countries. many people act like bunch businesses decided voluntarily close COVID disappeared. making excuses DeSantis--even Disney set way better example mitigating COVID state government--but government willing put work in. 

At least DeSantis never got caught breaking rules, like governors could name. Jesus comes back That’s true, executive branch actively hindering outright sabotaging anyone actually tried stop spread covid. also Brazil.

The ones California none pretty either.
We need get done ASAP adults year head start plan plan all. Seems way. people get vaccinated though you’re going give incentives. didn’t work way. Spiking cases lead spiking deaths. told China handles Lockdown well?.... /s Buy Air queen Soomlab. available online official store US. Safer counterfeiting China    section deal external border control, internal travel restrictions aka go see friend 50mi away. personally think = lockdown. 

A school closure lockdown, lockdown restricting movement inside area. lockdown people still visiting parties. think anywhere US anything looking like lockdown even free world standards months.  well, told says. said show writing never seen said shown illustration. Right also effective longer term strategy kids effectively missed year learning classroom setting...that big goddam deal.

We need get FDA get shit together actually get vaccines proper approval kids get them. normal snail pace government simply working this, pressure government that? way misunderstand badly try to. I'm going arhue anymore can't argument good faith. know vaccines 95% getting COVID dying. don’t prevent COVID. Plus didn’t 2nd dose long enough. won’t get Uber sick won’t die. means vaccine even first minor dose pretty much worked. Non story.  It’s life. Hospitalizations almost four percent.

This week? No, today. almost four percent one day. I've said times, least 100 nations tough lockdowns.

Pointing five low cases proof worked ... novel, say least. Wait, where’s tear gas? Riot police? Pepper spray? Obviously cases = deaths. believe anything definitive scientific proof. Yeah, looks like Biden lead soon. Well, no, what's point setting ""goal"" we're easily going exceed number?

A good leader would get solid info many vaccines possible (say, 185 million) set reasonable slightly-ambitious stretch goal (say, 200 million.)  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Surprisingly havent seen idiotic posts while.  study looks patients hospitalized pneumonia caused covid. I'm sure data compares patients pneumonia causes, would expect pneumonia would typically cause lung damage medium term. CDC projected 90,000 deaths next four weeks, would around last week February. No, I've wearing since day one. I'm tired them. Others *in sub* tired them. People wear correctly. People wear *crocheted masks* ffs.

Why still mandatory choice people. People get crazy... why? Stop baby take damn thing already. Jeez majority older people get vaccinated, it’s time go back normal. would they? done local level.

I actually thought saw badly states fucked up. Look percentages vaccinated per state vs vaccines distributed state. people dying could qualify vaccine reason vaccine sit unused warehouse. 

Every state different surely federal government come best plan states also flexibility differences per state. seriously doubt vaccines confer significant immunity across main variants means ""we're fucked""? make sense.

And truly mutates something need develop against: [New vaccines 'highly adaptable' tweaked COVID-19 variants, experts we've got covered, too. \*looks back 'civilization' throughout history\*

&amp;#x200B;

That's accurate statement may think. though maybe figurative literal sense. I’m Australian tomorrow I’ll going back school, won’t required wear masks unless can’t stay physically distanced, school less back normal, country specially state locked 111 days, roughly 60 missed school days able protect young old lives, get lives back normal whilst rest world scrambles enough beds people die in. School important, protecting people Covid important. Idk that. policies referring to? Agreed. back normal means exactly 2019, yeah, we'll never back normal. means Covid vaccines required get passport, probably decades least. 

Personally, 'back normal' we're able lift local restrictions mask mandates. Hopefully, western nations able start summer, definitely take years poorer countries get enough people vaccinated. Yeah blocked prevent people. crazy. like people take abortion clinics hostage. dont believe freedom. scream freedom inhibit others worst way. actually arrested. Protestors stand outside abortion clinics day long long don’t block door. applies here.  Northern Southern California need tracked separately. customers pay would one option 

Again, sold **at cost**.

I agree documentation caused delays, something going find raiding factory, provide evidence screwed production, I’m satisfied. 

Sure, jury still one, AZ may forced go public one since far EU proven willing lie try cover assess comes AZ agreement. far EU shown mess screwing procurement, lashing threatening trade wars UK, Canada Australia, mention breaching GFA, someone came senses. built business scratch starting 1998 it’s gone....stimulus wrong name.  Latinos European ancestry (mostly Spaniard). majority mix Spaniard Native. think vaccine work something blame. Thank taking time respond!!! South African variant Already Europe.

This week 1 case detected Spain.

No evidence yet, seems little worried resistance. Great high quality post. love hearing people speak position actual knowledge.

Going disagree ""things people can't change"" part though. understood dynamics transmission, able risk assessment every situation in. still wore mask required, never really worried never anywhere would really need one. meant could focus energy much better people walking around vague fear virus going get walking park.

With respect work environments, though, absolutely right. hard conclude reason CDC de-emphasized environmental exposure factors decided early way many people could safely work...and want message there.

It's frustrated also. much wasted effort, misplaced guilt tripping, COVID spreading people properly implementing protocols sustainable, effective, first place. That's nearly half country.... WaPo garbage COVID stuff, basically owned Amazon, benefited greatly people stuck home year

unless new variants cause massive, massive problems, second half 2021 nothing like 2020 would understand protesting better stimulus checks pro-virus people blocking vaccination sites unbelievable. fuck hard wearing damn mask? Covid preventable though? means number childhood deaths deaths matter 0 unacceptable tragedy sign isn’t working. literally can't find 20 million doses vaccine one actually tracking them. He's 10 days clean giant mess brewing weeks now. 

There needed clear plan place months ago, vaccines approved. knew ones went phase 3 testing- plan tailored vaccine went phase 3.

Also, FEMA sites may make huge difference, especially able get 100 running Thread anyway want. California 65+ people die per capita Florida. pretty simple math. You’re right. ~100% probably overselling bit. data gets rolled we’ll better idea. Regardless, like said, we’re way getting control. you’re trying create children you’ve got look extra 6 hours day, grow take responsibility, take kids hiking camping you’re worried bubble children instead sending school putting risk death, although suppose that’d win nice life insurance payout daycare 24 hours day instead normal 6 school gives you. could expensive? need table, cleaver, steady hand.

It's bad. rna vaccines seem work also new variants, means totally defenseless.

I'll defenetly take shot biontech vaccine EU's contracts watertight. 

No they're not. There's plenty discussion around nowhere near clear they've claimed, even embarassed / breached releasing unredacted version contract. Clauses 5.1 5.4 look good EU all, conduct around Northern Ireland shocking.

Either way, blocking exports make shortfalls vaccine nationalism EU ashamed - production issues happen. Fact left things late, overnegotiated price shockingly far behind lack planning. There's reason number EU ministers popping ballsed up. Try reading actual cdc opinion piece secondary news sources it. might learn something . went population Manaus.Then went again. people allowed travel 5km away home

How enforced? Got news ya bud... Hawaii still connected mainland US...

Australia island edge world.

Why think Kiribati Nauru Tuvalu low numbers? welded inside full experience anally probed. explains latest expansion production companies quite well. Pfizer BioNTech executive would want produce tenfold regardless impacts margin. income vaccination campaign plus experience manufacturing handling vaccine scale could breakthrough 21st century medicine.  low fever, chills mainly sore muscles, think Covid (they passed three tests quarantine developed symptoms 2 days released). Luckily since coughing infect single person, even husband. people taken many months get flight home it’s $3k per person 14 days inside hotel room - treat prisoners better  Yeah, that... bored minor sacrifice bored means people luxury stay home work safely people get needlessly infected.

It's simple that. conspiratorial ""covid lie"" anti public health friends blame this. go hold task selfish idiots?

I'm sure could find time whining men dating apps. argument U.K.‘s vaccines bottled Belgium 0 impact EU’s supplies. vaccines already created, last process bottling individual vials done Belgium. vaccine already created U.K., obviously bottling EU 0 impact EU’s supply. 

Some best scientists working systems bureaucracy stifles science. It’s surprises it’s US U.K. major economies well creating vaccines &amp; rolling out. EU bureaucratic, slow lacks forward thinking. Scientists also don’t get levels funding European countries would Anglosphere. 

And regarding funding? majority funding allocated governments Vaccine Taskforce April May 2020. EU didn’t fund vaccine per se, placed early order. It’s tit tat. U.K. govt hand provided funding develop vaccine addition orders. saying country:""Only grave cures ignorance."" biggest difference UK Aus probably population density. UK 275 people per square km, compared Australia's **3**. 91 times density quite difference. queues local meth dealers? Melbourne population 5 million people surface area 10,000km2. Greater Manchester population 3 million people surface area 1,000km2. that's 60% population Melbourne crammed 10% space.  Australia also implemented use 'hotspots' 'bubbles' limit travel particular places community covid spread allowing travel safer areas. seems like would somewhat address point border cities. example QLD closed border NSW extended 'bubble', called it, way NSW like Byron. order allow people live NSW work Brisbane Gold Coast live life normal. opened NSW ""fully"" allowed everyone except ""hotspots"" like greater Sydney. Mate, coof even know coof. Imagine virus vile, HEINOUS tested know it.

You'd absolutely daft think point dramatization safety  there's spate reinfections, scientific media news media would it. fact we're hearing suggests happening. 

Perhaps seroprevalence survey flawed. thing covid actually quite hard catch - unless spend time sharing enclosed air infected, case you’re high risk. guy three housemates there’s decent chance (containable!) outbreak unless caught infection early. PA one best performing states comes number vaccinations, may vaccines week (since receive weekly basis) time he's trying register. Butter toast. Spread vegemite lightly. Add thin slices avocado.

He's famous brought lump coal debate climate change waved around head yelling people scared it.
His government like 3 good things covid fight trying claim lead fight. 

The best summation Covid response I've seen newspaper cartoon two state leaders front seats car trying navigate ""pandemic road map"" two cronies back seats screaming ""ARE YET?""  Also forget rural gets outside Perth. Even tourism hotspots hundreds kilometers away hospitals also vulnerable indigenous populations. lockdown comes regional travel limitations virus spreading outside Perth would rough regional hospitals. BBB struggles relevant Texas smaller Australian states. Tasmania, Victoria Australian Capital territory smaller. Especially since seen play states. obvious need panic buy. good. least agree chanting AUS AUS weird af? course, vaccine development complete waste time could simply travel back time exterminate bats China That's EU narrative, reality EU cocked contract say claimed does. future shortfalls, even Pfizer, allowed export doses unless case certain exemptions (92 total). news week. IMO, virus end goes population.

This believe, believe collective governments telling us. Yeah mostly bullshit. call ""Scotty Marketing"" nothing. protective gear hotel guards wear?A simple mask may enough new variants.They supplied full PPE gear. Right, forgot full lockdown, automatically prevented allowing freight travel well. bad governments would ability whatsoever grant permits exempting freight travel border closures.

Second mutation virus lead rapid reinfection, natives province literally described ""Overnight things exploded"" (Source: (unfortunally cant provide source part natives talking seen around fb friend mom soo take grain salt) virus started reinfect people arealdy it.
Third possible waining herd immunity unconfirmed.

The federal goverment sending Oxygen state including massive cylinder warship heading towards Manaus (Source: ). also airlifting multiple patients hospitals across country help state.

2 UK variants SA variant. Hoping lockdown squashes it. covid? thought could last month's people. Shhhhh, there’s billions stake here. mRNA everyone’s figuring do. Yeah, you’re generalizing. Australia NZ spread, everything virtually open even without vaccines. That's mutations work 

Please lecture subject understand. Yes, mutations happen constantly, detrimental virus spread. mutations benefit virus do. Working around vaccine (as working around antibiotics) comes price virus, vaccine free environment cost outweigh benefits mutation spread.

However mutation happening partially vaccinated country may make variant successful enjoys large number hosts exclusivity normal strand cannot compete. Thus allowing spread.

A partially vaccinated population puts pressure virus favor mutations circumvent said vaccine. Novavax hasn’t even finished enrollment US trial (which required FDA even consider it). aren’t going approved anytime soon. Yup, Moderna designed vaccine January 13th. genetic sequence released 2 days prior. Samples vaccine produced sent initial trials month first US death.

mRNA game changing Heh, real talk, pandemic finally ends, I'd like important person (like Dr. Fauci, high-level politician) announcing ""Ladies gentlemen... got 'em."" Bahrain then?

Working office sucked. extra hours sleep nice. commute sucks. disliked socializing coworkers added bonus WFH. no, anti-social introvert like people think reason people express dislike office, plenty friends actually like around like socialize with, bam also WFH makes easier time flexiblity.

The issue WFH pandemic work, can't fun things WFH nature would make easier. can't go friends, show, restaurant log out. work, sleep, work, sleep. 

I'm certain normal times WFH would incredible nice, hope firms companies continue make WFH option want it. good news. I'm worried variants current vaccines demonstrate competent efficacy ones spreading. Important thing IMHO keep vaccination rates rates new infections- sustained- think we're really way home base. Well, crap Open schools March close June summer break? seems like waste time Er.. yes.. Europe says Hi! Ah yes, facts lies. wonder going get banned misinformation now. theorized since April, paying attention, first evidence Covid damaged testes found. jumping shark; even new news.  Exactly. They’re tools arsenal. 

Not sure BAM Regeneron sitting unused. Texas, we’re giving fast send us. Primary care physicians sending patients local EDs everywhere get infusion. We’ve tighten treatment criteria we’ve many people want infusion. would judge situation almost solely whether goes back work booster not. beginning pandemic considered borderline unethical see kinds patients person. 28 days test leads COVID-19 death certificate. Thank you. promise, college much fun really get it. blast. Enjoy it, really goes fast Deaths dropping, look worldometer stats. last 2 days significant.  There's reason doubt they'll make March targets. mandate someone job.

We mandate construction workers wear hard hats, safety goggles, steel toed boots. too? mean, it’s body. copy paste image? Right? would think would coming support masks ventilation would make keeping businesses open feasible. case vaccine still get covid serious?

“- said DSHS spokesman Chris Van Deusen. ""In fact, directed ensure vaccinating people hardest hit areas populations, cannot exclusion literally everyone else”. - last paragraph article

This ridiculous thing say. Limited available vaccine means tasked *prioritizing* gets vaccine first. Prioritization means vaccinating people *before* vaccinating others. means yes, prioritizing people vulnerable zip codes come (temporary) exclusion everyone else. Australian brought covid town rural America. fair, mass gathering direct response health order separate willful stupidity.

Europe received single shipment USA UK? Right? there's any, please share us help us clear confusion! That’s awesome, go vacation /s care respect others 

These opposing positions. hurrrrr.... hope downgrade efficacy much He'll say fake, believe it, would contradict beliefs, that's much president long causes viral pneumonia? long term effects caused pneumonia Covid, others too? everyone gets Covid suffer long term damage? title easily interpreted like that. Vaccine roll-out supposedly starts week hopefully light end tunnel approaching. 

Anecdotally, that's people saying. personally, know without exception every single Covid case ICU work fight worst cases suffering obesity. We'll see epidemiological data starts rolling Dec/Jan, even impossible really tell since generally test variant. could gotten infected much earlier developed symptoms long incubation period. New research suggests average incubation period 7.7 days, 10% people incubation period longer 14 days. 2 parents virus.

You sure want rephrase sentence? end crisis sight thought little bit both? filter incoming air, better nothing. Great! LOL stupid, stupid response feel least educators related staff (bus driver, custodial) need fully vaccinated 1st. would harder deal school closings (after return school)

Why Canadians generally eager adhere media narratives? Read damn article Strawmen? saying authoritarian regimes bad track records respect human rights violations?

Or yet another redditor know fallacy actually means? got nasal swab instead nasopharyngeal swab. Nasal swabs considered slightly less accurate, nasopharyngeal swabs 100% either, routine precautions develop symptoms worsening symptoms get tested People personal lives, hobbies self improvement exist s/ ""That nothing.""

""The whole point protesting force change make people uncomfortable.""

Hot take, know. downvoted like hell eye developed country, totally right. USA, UK, Israel hoarding vaccine even neighboring Europe.

We instead hope China, India, Russia vaccines well least get vaccines. think wfh become common. think it'll become norm replace office workspaces places letting employees work home especially since win win situation. employee gets escape morning traffic rush employer save rental get smaller cheaper office rent.

Clearly cannot calculate risk. nation brainwashed seem think happened parts US, UK, norm. isn't. I've seen similar people HK, understandable since CCP control. 

As nation appear lost humanity critical thinking reasoning skills. sadly likely exposed already prevalent society there. work quarantine security guard known covid cases, pre-test probability becomes much higher. always someone else vaccinate you. ego Se + 1D Te Testing changed inaccurate nasal swabs using year longer done right, possible, tweak vaccine then?  people rot prison. fucking disgrace anti vaxxers are. Absolutely disgusting people insane. waited long antivirals took long diagnose me...I think getting early makes big difference! well, best luck you, careful!

No thank you. Echo chamber wailing..they need freedom :)  pfizer/moderna already provide excellent efficiency 95% groundbreaking. third shot could possibly bump slightly like gonns bump 100% efficiency considering 95% another shot really worth gain potential extra 2-4% efficiency though? thst point really provide much real world benefit better sticking 2 doses. 

J&amp;J testing 2 doses results due yet time hence went released 1 dose results since efficiency still good enough terms ending pandemic. Hard say 2 doses provide significant improvement efficiency since different vaccine also pfizer/moderna. think similar vaccine AZ 2 doses 60-70% efficient. mean going may 2 doses provide much benefit maybe.

What cheeses many Republicans probably Congress right now, okay first-strike policy protestors like. people lick balls Well thank God cause I’ll never vaccinate myself.  Barring kind catastrophic development, I'd say likely things 90% back normal school starts late summer/early fall.

Some states may still hold relaxing mask mandates indoor, public areas, especially we're back indoor concerts sports.

International travel anyone's guess, especially looking travel highly vaccinated country mostly unvaccinated country. fuck still tolerating self-genocidal syndrome???

It's mind-virus vaccine either yet developed yet reach herd immunity.

So full vaccine immunity response, 473 cases resulted 2 deaths 38 current hospitalisations 7 days amounts 0.4% 8.0%. compared group 0-13 days first dose, non-existent low immunity vaccine, 4.3% 11.9%, infection rate 1.05% vs 0.07%. not. saying high income jobs demand people's time general. Definitely high income jobs may not, middle income jobs may expect ridiculous hours. saying job great work life balance one contributing reasons middle income. particular case making middle income expecting lot sounds like. sucks! knew corona would biden office Lockdowns work one complies state/country actually lock point. also work government provide citizens well enough citizens *able* comply!

Your right don’t kids doesn’t mean didn’t grow 5 siblings. went school dedicate life working big Pharma. 

Again completely wrong. Children low risk sense get Covid don’t need hospitalized. Covid children young adults asymptomatic meaning 100% contract Covid give others Covid displaying absolutely ZERO symptoms Adult Covid would have. hate tell absolutely ZERO scientific evidence states teachers vaccinated schools magically become safe. 

Like said covid keeps creating multiple variants. Meaning child go school help develop Covid variant isn’t protected current vaccine. means one day kid come home completely fine little know gave entire family Covid protected current vaccine. cause happen promise 2020 everything shut develop new vaccine. 

Moving “goal posts” called adaptive learning. means learn new info virus need adjust goals keep people safe avoid repeat 2020 sure that? Germany done 2.3m doses *in total* including 1st 2nd. 7 day average 96k per day. Oh, agree.

AZ meant 3 weeks well trial data they’re giving 2nd dose 12 weeks later reasons those? seen nothing indicating this... get emboldened punch harder :) disagree. what?

I mean it’s really matter opinion. factually, objectively incorrect. That’s good hear then. Hopefully go well distribution won’t shitfest like current vaccine. likely masks worn winter years come fight new mutations. Note, Japan updated number PCR tests performed since January 28th, tends suggest number tests may lower average (which usually around 50,000 60,000 per day). Many us pro-vaccine side tolerate ridiculous criteria restrictions. could poor political maneuver decide pick criteria.

BioNTech that's generous this. read mask recommendations? commenting without reading article? lost any, I've asked confirm. feel like trying squirrel way this.

Do agree Australian I've lost freedoms, freedoms lost? Pfizer, moderna etc done phase 3 data, took 6 months, India well ""misunderstand"" anything. clearly stated ""This I’ve saying week. Minority students bearing brunt classrooms, session"".

Perhaps worded something incorrectly, way phrased it, got across wrong message. New Zealand, anyone actually following news see stupid island excuse US restricted non-essentially international travel much, more, countries went lockdown. Yeah media big fucking joke Australia. pretty much America 2.0 comes that.

I even surprised Liberals win larger margin last time perceived amazing job controllng virus (when literally state governments heavy lifting). ask 6 nurses living dorm taking practicals (not sure word English) say much normal considering less people want go hospitals. guess different different regions country. guys much smarter better everybody. Wow much good. point lockdowns show graph Finland, assumed related. Seems Everyone lost some. lockdown bad indeed.

I pub since December. mean meet friend's place tho. able enforce internal borders effectively state COVID outbreak. Ah yes way mocked people wear masks refused coordinate federal vaccination plan great responses year, bigger question much talk population think thats contributing factor. 

Compare Sweden two dense countries Europe, Netherlands 

However dense living sure, specially live multiple generations. 2 hours delay funny. stay risk infected one anti-vaxers. go away add travel time 2 hours. moved Victoria 5 years ago got email transperth today saying mask use mandatory there. Got say I'm impressed fast responded like  US essentially borders closed like New Zealand Finland. What's difference again?

Let know island excuse becomes valid reason US failure containing outbreak compared countries. Bigger Texas? cattle station that's bigger Texas. shut I'll subdivide two stations bigger Texas. Yea 50 60 years old. get shingles that. huffpost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* legal cures ***criminal*** stupidity. Every politician given vaccine. everyone understand that? 31 year old AOC(and care politics, age/health) getting vaxxed almost month ago. instead trashing leaders allowing happen, blaming 70 year old heart disease frantically trying navigate online sites find opening QUALIFY FOR. Going countries, good. states nearly, probably ideal. cities??? Please. drive hour renew license, would assume need select vax location within mile house I'm presented options STATE areas???

Do anyone think maybe instead articles put blame old people trying get vaccined, write articles politicians allowing happen? deal people one side defending leadership(lack of)at top 2020, 2021. Hold people charge responsible!! downvoted truth. real uk death toll estimated 140k btw. last year death recorded positive covid test died hospital. changed within 28days covid test.  magic - people close proximity others outside household significant amount time without PPE, virus spread.

Different societies structured differently thus require different measures separate people.

There certain amount feedback system, people change behaviour hear news. Covid also appears somewhat seasonal, course people distributed geographically. Thus see waves, would dynamic systems.

Remember, virus care ideology - give opportunities spread, spread. Unrestricted spread, e.g. Manaus, likely result largescale death disability. antivaxers claiming refuse vaccinated grounds personal freedom. shut vaccination centres people freedom choice ?  Meanwhile America. Empowerment look idiot Skip vaccinate willing. would love get vaccine now. Heck give 3 shots sure.  Super normal. People scared shitless without reason be. 

Here Quebec, even allowed let kids play others! Ok agree lost freedoms then, no? Back June large purchases ventilators occurred spring lot deaths due ventilator shortages. Yes, think that's key. Despite taken measurements outcome different, countries otherwise similar population, density, elderly care, age etc. 

And countries taken different measurements also similar almost results. think makes believe Sweden would taken exact steps Denmark UK did, might still 11.000 deaths seems factors yet discovered. Mountain Dew lol “essential” travel like cross-border trade commuting still allowed.

Right, borders were/are closed travel restricted. 

Learn difference ""closed"" ""restricted"" come back. supposed get there?

**IMPACTS...Travel could difficult impossible.** 
hazardous conditions could impact morning evening 
commute. Gusty winds could bring tree branches.

Even second dose comes, everyone slightly protected better half people completely protected.

Plus vaccines increasing production increases.

The benefit far far outweighs tiny risk. Ive suspended twice Facebook commenting lockdowns, privileged people literally beg closing everything attack people try explain go work, say kind nasty shit name ""the better good""

I'm sick bullshit, thanks god every day less less people believe useless lockdowns destruction society. I'm saying try help developing countries. saying need take care countries first. Kind like plane ask put oxygen mask helping others.  Albuquerque church make 'MSM', saw one. Indian (?) one see before.  nice fact! Imagine giving pass country largest military world could mobilize assist domestic border security. 

Even didn’t border security system, could done plenty stay home measures mandates prevent half million deaths. surprising South Africa Novavax. important thing mild. largely stays major concern really part Medical students  Okay antibodies neutralizing virus, surround it, latching onto ""receptor binding domains"" (RBD) forming bonds clumps antibodies neutralize it. formation done, led antibodies unable latch onto RBD thus unable clump together stop virus latching onto ACE2 receptors.  


All vaccines attack spike, good strategy get wrong, would predicted happening haha. However, need neutralize spike well spike. suspect next vaccine. different NSP (nuclear shuttle proteins) could another strategy attack aiding war.  


This gives good overview preventing spike currently predicted type affects us. Essentially, unable stop see big issues.  


This blog found last night also interesting pieces author speaks about. No. people saying others responsible advocating world. 

Name governor. one them. keeping 2023 cases Ukraine. good absolutely scorn flying risking infection vaccine starting take effect enough people likely end resistant strains. That's like someone jumping lifeboat un-hitching sinking ship anyone else gets despite 9 open seats knowing row. I'm going give ""attaboy"" knowing ship going lifeboats happen located.

Nobody deserves pat back prioritizing survival others. vaccines ridiculously effective data prove it. get line. afford fly, afford hunker weeks. Ah thanks. Also supports case states base restrictions hospitalizations  lot people recovered covid still trouble breathing might affected long run 9 million doses original cut supply. start Despite overall decrease hospitalizations, may hotspots need rapid ramp-up capacity. Local facilities preferable airlifts cities states. ask help seeing first country Canada looked partner with. want end vaccines third world country Gucci belt you. preliminary data Israel shows working. UK say data (on infection rate) UK two weeks. take time see reflected hospitalisation even longer reflection deaths. might see true drops deaths month more. Well, started decided without consulting European people needed federalism another layer political bloat top political bloat already have. Thanks elaborating that! California locked hospitals getting overwhelmed. total hospitalization cases decline. contribute regaining sense smell taste triggered depression anxiety.”

Relax, fine. corona kill you, won’t 50. get sick recover back 100%. 

Chill out. Stop spreading fear. Lift lockdown, cure lot depression bunch people lost taste smell. Part hatred different ethnicities country, country united ever continues steadily develop.

&amp;#x200B;

No one would believe bald-faced lie. 100% embarrassing yourself. know Tibetans, Inner Mongolians, Uighurs, Hong Kongers Taiwanese oppressed massive scale, like fundamentally distrust Han Chinese (maybe heard Tibet uprising, Hong Kong protests etc.). ruled fear oppression choice matter - vote know would vote independence China, given one controlled ruthless crackdowns. alone enough demonstrate intellectual dishonesty. tensions high \[in US\] there's deep rooted division within nation.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose difference US China regard Han Chinese position complete dominance minorities, politicians population general, China would reveal divided standard living U.S really changed much meantime average person. Infrastructure shit higher education medicare affordable top 10% society \[...\]

&amp;#x200B;

I would point solely focused negative comparisons America, countries appropriate point comparison, i.e. Germany, Canada, South Korea. America deep seated economic problems never provided level welfare developed democracies. readily admit America's failings can't say all, even most, capitalist / democratic countries, hardly counts favour socialist wars borders/sovereignty risk violated. killing, invasion, interference country's internal affairs.

&amp;#x200B;

You need stop giving softballs, one easy knock park starting make feel like professional. China justifiable reason seize Tibet, Xinjiang Inner Mongolia early days CCP, borders risk wanted power, resources control (the annexation Tibet flatly contradicts points). Equally, point time China place trying invade Taiwan, poses military threat culturally, politically geographically distinct country almost century (although frequently threaten this). 

&amp;#x200B;

China may confined exercises military power borders (and neighboring territories) early days CCP military power project interests distance (New Zealand also occupy nearest neighbours reason). early days expansion - Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet - enough territory problems look without fighting far flung wars. China also ridiculous habit disputing territory almost neighbours, especially Indo-Pacific Ocean, territorial claims absurd rejected flatly Hague Court. hard see China creates conflict neighbours pushing unnecessary unfounded territorial claims (hiding behind idea border disputes justify crimes). hardly meaningful defense since China aggressor almost 100% cases.  see China's system performing worse. you? 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, do. China would become rich almost whatever form governance chose. China lift bootstraps, engineer way poverty, system governance surpass countries thereby produce unrivaled results. Foreign countries invested China massively changed country (the true Japan WW2), China took money failed deliver end bargain. Instead democratising opening (economically politically) CCP abused millions upon millions people try keep tight control power burned trust former partners allies (which Huawei's 5G infrastructure shut foreign countries, trade war, countries trying relocate supply chains elsewhere, long list companies trying source cotton Xinjiang, knows else future). China's system self-defeating sustained constant abuse oppression people CCP moral legitimacy would reform force people.  exactly West focus narrative ""(market)freedom, (sham)democracy, (individual)rights"", produce atrocity propagandas

&amp;#x200B;

We talked misinformation conspiracy theories earlier, people believing little evidence understanding issues involved. provided wealth evidence atrocities going Xinjiang waved away vague, generalised appeals trust anything coming West (even though many critics also come China), despite real proof multitude sources cited wrong evidence lacking. invite see conspiracy theorist - believe abuse going Xinjiang even though visited Xinjiang confirm weight evidence firmly position, generalised distrust West based propoganda conspiracy theories Western interference credit without hard evidence (which like invert calling narrative, propoganda Western conspiracy theory). arguing evidence good reasons justify position fool, anyone answer question, care ideologies. simply look results. CCP, despites shortcomings, served core interest Chinese people incredibly well: sovereignty, stability, peacefulness, prosperity, order. 

&amp;#x200B;

You care ideologies, clearly do. also refuse accept serious criticism China, choose overlook / deny atrocities China (Tiananmen, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, South China Sea) ignore evidence contradicts position. human cost happened journalists, academics, artists, religious practicioners, free thinkers, lawyers, political rivals / dissidents, ordinary people ethnic minorities across China terrible ashamed wasting time unconvincingly trying pretend happening therefore matter.  noone ever safe. eventually new flu. Therefore, cannot keep life pause forever we're shipping 4M doses EU pre-production stockpile way!

That's myth btw. produced UK, fill finished EU, fill finish process bottlenecking EU supply. good enough 65 year old age groups. Sputnik V vaccine probably first approved EU. exactly? I'm German Spanish, hope government would open too. 

If could choose vaccine would take Pfizer Moderna, since I'm priority group (I'm professor, seems we'll quite near back queue here) prospect probably offered AZ 70% efficacy late 2021 early 2022.

If chance instead get Chinese Russian vaccine months (after EU institutions check approve them) able live somewhat normal summer, would no-brainer. care countries? like personally designed Putin make suddenly recite Mao's red book heart. data far seems point efficacy, good mRNA vaccines, least comparable AZ. get vaccinated earlier diversifying sources, count in, screw Western superiority complex. Define communism sense taste seemed little first realized sense smell totally gone two really connected. 

It’s like way lose sense smell taste cold. That’s usually congestion sinuses blocked. loss smell taste COVID actually caused virus attacking certain part brain. That’s might might come back. understand. go work groceries that’s it. time see friends happen scheduled work them. kids extra curriculars since March returned school (we’ve blessed option return stay remote). feel pain much. point see benefits arguments. Regardless, can’t wait everyone wants get. benefit free exchange idea obvious fields like academia, science, philosophy, i.e. controlled environments rational people. negative also obvious. Information spread publicly real, widespread consequences society taken lightly. Misinformation, conspiracy theories, disinformation evolve huge costs individuals societies alike. one could course hope “bad” information get debunked “good” ones, remember cost way effort resources combat fake news coming them, many times damage already done way truth surfaces. me, answer definitely clear cut think healthy compromise way go.

&amp;#x200B;

This indeed problem faced countries around world, recently become challenge open, democratic societies particular. seem minority society attracted to, susceptible conspiracy theories, extreme ideologies etc., worse, elements appear steadfastly committed convinced kinds ideas (i.e. little firm evidence become supremely confident know truth dangers 5G, vaccines, motivations political financial elite, way race relations handled etc. etc,). response Western countries trying formulate new demands would put outlets facilitate aggressively publish conspiracy theories, misinformation etc. (Facebook, Twitter forth). 

&amp;#x200B;

Broadly speaking believe efforts misguided, like Chinese measures discussing, early days process solutions offered may improve time. case, cannot reasonably imply deliberate spreading conspiracy theories / misinformation, medical professional trying alert colleagues possible healthcare emergency comparable analogous (in accordance argument rational people professional environment anyone would expect do). know meant make association measures place result flagged problem measures place represent unhealthy rather healthy compromise, hope come appreciate. broadest context, suppose would reckon whether great firewall good idea principle. Would choose live (to never really know outside world, whether information consuming real not, living bubble according governments designs U.S example, twitter FB accounts get banned time “spreading misinformation”. Trump, literally represents voices almost half Americans, effectively shut modern communication platforms. Anyone blind would realize censorship alive well U.S mainstream media. Oh mention whistleblowers like Snowden, Assange, Chelsea Manning, etc gets persecuted revealing mass surveillance war crimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Straight back fudged comparisons US, every China defender's favourite form hollow succor. case agree much absolutely deplore censorship right American politics (in particular, frequent painting right far right, certain, extreme elements far left something amenable decent, moderate society), excuse justification China's censorship - scale incomparable US, already well know. Two rights make wrong, condemn countries here, one other, fall letting hook whataboutisms.

&amp;#x200B;

I would contend whistleblowing fairly complex distinct example kind problem. hard draw line issue (what acceptable, not, exceptions mitigating factors?), scale Snowden Assange's whistleblowing even difficult, though wish countries business could see whistleblowing often public good (as case Snowden), provide protections right conditions.   I'd ask straightforward question, think open, democratic closed autocratic governments political systems tend produce better results (or likely achieve better society)""

&amp;#x200B;

After reading response point things weigh heavily assessment points made below. First, *you appear focussed primarily economic indicators*, appreciate important well, also interested system produces better society, i.e. social, legal political environment would choose live in, likely produce decisions continue make case future etc. feel like unusual interpretation talking people defend China recent decades Chinese civil society hollowed attacks religious practicioners, rival politicians, journalists, human rights advocates, lawyers, free thinkers, artists, influencers, foreigners, minorities etc. etc. (social, cultural, intellectual artistic gains lagged behind economic gains recent decades). Second, *you frequently point fact China become lot richer cite sign Chinese government done something right*, broadly speaking result foreign financial investment (Western money business know pouring into, invested relatively under-developed country lot room grow absorb capital). investment made basis China's promises open economy accession WTO, still honoured. China would done well economically whether capitalist, socialist, democratic autocratic case, see would argument favour socialism (or evidence good Chinese governance). Equally, China's autocratic tendencies risk sabotaging business deals world large (Australia, India, America, UK), along technology theft precipitated trade war America guiding countries try move manufacturing away China (in words, China enriched promised less autocratic, lapsing back autocracy risks selling short failing achieve potential. Admittedly Xi Jinping already gotten wanted relationship, however illicitly, likely snowball China momentum, really anything recommend authoritarianism standard living China risen incredible pace past 20-30 years. Infrastructure well-built, economy 2nd largest world, 

&amp;#x200B;

I already answered above, infrastructure well built Japan well. clear correlation countries infrastructure built quality infrastructure (the recent better typically). country China's position, capitalist socialist, would enjoyed good infrastructure - see Japan, Dubai education

&amp;#x200B;

Chinese people China achieving high levels education, although would prudent point achieving well-rounded education (in politics, art, religion, foreign affairs, history etc. government pulled 600 million people extreme poverty \[...\] medicare affordable cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

I acknowledge points, good things, although observed poverty eliminated advanced countries, capitalist socialist, China shown real ambition anything pay lip service socialism recent decades (inequality continues grow, wealth redistribution exists degree would expect truly socialist communist country). Trying argue sign China socialist communist country like trying argue America owns moon planted first flag it. big statistical analysis data ""catching covid"" especially people caught covid understand transmisibility dangerous certain activities are???

For example think short range public transport within city safe unless overcrowded (shouldnt people home officing). reasoning everybody masks, well ventilated space doors open every 2 minutes stop, mostly half full, crowded, people spend 15-20 minutes average there, move within vehicle concerned somebody infected. many people actually get sick went tram followed save guidelines.

In humble controversial opinion, people caught covid either A) didnt follow safe guidelines like masking, distancing, hygiene etc. basically fault preventable B) caught covid coworker belongs group, partially preventable, would good sealing respirator day long C) caught housemate belongs group.

Basically would like know many people caught covid due following safe guidelines, caught absolutely silently (like touching infected surface, breathing aerosol either travelled far source air hours infected someone long source left

TL;DR people caught covid, ratio ""douches didnt respect safety measures"" vs. ""people didnt anything wrong still somehow caugh covid""??? opinion pandemic getting hand 80-90% douches prevent catching it... many diseases cause problems developing countries (like tuberculosis, malaria, ebola, etc.) effect day-to-day life developed countries.

Problems solved easily infrastructure relatively cheap. really something okay letting continue happen? So, got mother, despite wearing surgical masks.

I think new information. Plenty studies/real world examples show Covid spreads inside despite mask wearing social distancing. 

Being inside others deadly. Stay away other. Yeah good see UK something well. Britain risk even knew vaccine worked, enabling production start way earlier normal much difficult supply bottlenecks. Australian living Melbourne lockdowns least restrictions worked. sucked worked. good. happens best us :) Hope nice day! Good know. considering drinking bit got vaccine. PTSD people touching alcohol helps relax enough get situations. Didn’t buy Chinese vaccines.

We going trial one data never ended getting it. No.  Excuse deaths lag 3-4 weeks.  vaccine effective 6 weeks. That's first thing said agree on. Dude live la lol, know weather. It'll stay chilly foruch longer stretches florida. Also lived florida 20 years think know I'm talking about. \-The delays Europe due incompetence EU politicians could signed deal vaccines Europe May 2020 delayed August haggle already dirt cheap vaccine.

They experiencing manufacturing difficulties would gone three months ago. (which britain went three months ago)

\-So EU decided throw toys pram block exports vaccines deprive Australia countries vaccines would receive produced EU.

 ∴ EU fault faffing

I dont think joke people (may well be) dying due actions EU funny.  Israel, spring. UK/US, summer. EU/Canada, fall. one person?  We’re tizzy one? Wow.. Lets it.. EU orders vaccines 3 months late, gets vaccines 3 months late. Simple. seems country country issue. is, article written cases country believe there's aerosol transmission. need N95 could transmitted aerosol -- smaller droplets sneezes. believe transmission droplets, surgical mask that's needed.  Israel injecting around 2% population every day. certainly possible America Australians definitely proud themselves. Yay! I'm Surrey/South London anything past Finchley gives nosebleed. vaccine administration ramps (22 years old) think get vaccinated Summer. we're 40 million doses month (which low end think, could get 50+ million per month even) February/March/April/May, that's 160 million doses addition 30 million we've already administered. think could get group. availability quite broad I'd imagine, think they'll super strict age. OP, vaccines dish particular day, offer people use rather wasting them. Congrats!!! Oh man wish US! nice, point? suggesting vaccines go ""natives"" first ""white"" people can't poor can't bad healthcare?

No, that's I'm saying. People like talk past effect present, right now. factors made pandemic worse native people minority groups america, besides poverty. obvious problem modern day poverty caused history racism, racism causing issues well

And record, i'm anti poor white people. Poverty sucks even without experiencing racism. That's think enact policies help people, healthcare feel good racism.

Nothing racism makes feel good.  Chicago Phase 4 much state Illinois too! one step away completely restored! 2,428 cases today. Let's go!! he’s CEO company, I’m surprised wasn’t one first vaccinate himself. many people vaccine hesitant, would think would want show believes vaccine taking it. Citation needed. EU succeeded convincing citizens, blame America Brits everything going wrong lives.

European here. one ground buying it. know EU fucked lying save hide. Euroskeptic sentiments skyrocketing. western vaccines course. go ahead, vaccine Chinese vaccine. fact US Executive Order place bans export vaccine vaccine related products, get facts straight. UK defacto ban place reserved doses entire order filled.

The link shared mass production AstraZeneca vaccine. Similar deals also signed American companies. India China.

Signing contract first doses ban. There's export ban uk flu vaccine though. us executive order exactly eu signed. export, must first meet us orders. thinking defense act used ppe, assume anyway. guess original estimates november case numbers exploded. Kinda makes phase 3 trials lot faster... ton medical professionals civilian licenses military. think they'd train infantrymen that's envisioning. 

They could also used crowd control, logistics non-medical functions.  Peace! I'll shoes month  unfortunate much overlap parties support disbanding EU parties alt right nutcases.

I see people accepting alt right nutcase thing rid EU. Yes completed 3 millions pilot project remember reasoning reopening? “it’s time” thing? I’ve received two fines jay walking lost license 63km 60 road. Cameras everywhere sole purpose generating revenue local councils governments.

The excessive fining culture Australia nothing safety everything money. Nope, manufactured UK sent AZ plant bottled. LOL, accuracy splitting hairs. 

Its super interesting biologists virologists know different perspective you. wonder why? little nervous click article happy read much less symptoms time. can't dumb. Brazil never actual lockdown, surely lockdown now. believe that's one things Biden administration looking doing. Moderna actually asked FDA approve five additional doses vaccine vials. would increase available doses 50%. Lol rSino. Thank china spreading pandemic. Im sitting good old Germany fucked everything people going waiting month get vaccine.

I research site suggested continue vaccine people fast, I'll able get one November 2023. smfh. Lol rarely gets high 60 ever LA bucket vindaloo? China build 200 bed hospital 5 days! that? elderly people vulnerable though. plenty working aged adults immunocompromised, either illness, medication both. can't work able quarantine life cannot risk going anywhere choice take risk going work every single day. 
Lots retired people also life outside sitting house day every day likely far money spend college kids do. Take me. Quarantining months end fun. I've house almost day, every single day since last March I'm one vulnerable working age adults. free drive safely knowing dickheads r getting fines Early state updates suggest today going really low day new cases us, compared recent months  alone said they'd able provide 200m doses end May, two months earlier initially expected.

They’ve started counting vial 6 doses instead 5. aren’t actually getting anything faster originally planned. hundred miles south California. Right next island Alaska. count kn95 medical grade masks, allowed. R/woooosh  Maybe two dozen locally acquired cases January across whole Australia.

How's country doing? Also, active land borders high travel stop Vietnam Thailand swiftly handling COVID! Probably vaccinations, herd immunity, increased awareness, possibility mutating less-dangerous disease probably serious issue every year. call stupid American you’re Canadian. joke. gone BONKERS here. Everyone made mad dash shops - like within 10 minutes announcement standing room only. Good way increase spread, sure. Not. Yet. happy shithouse quarentine system?

When army air force fully equiped deal biological warfare move tens thousands moment notice reason cannot get australians home isolate isolated areas comparing us countries handled virus worse us? let's compare countries like taiwan resort travel exit bans allowed people quarantine home. economy way better too, want talk economy versus lives saved, well prioritising tennis stars stranded australians already choosing economy aussie lives unless count they're australia?  quokkas... they're people ! .613 seconds per case, actually What’s name podcast? Naah mate, care end goal.. like able actually freedom.  arguing let people die fly overseas see someone dying funeral? long know gives fuck aye? 

A slight inconvenience gives fuck anyone else. You’re exactly right. I’ve working year “essential worker”. ... guess do? Deliver food people! somehow minimum wage job essential Mrs. Teacher making 80,000+ year?!?! call bs! don’t work union, that’s difference. Unions banned public employment. Never government workers able hold tax payers hostage. Meanwhile, also exploiting parents (their paycheck payers) slobs. I’m fed up. Thats true, far aware, still single strand vaccine? mean. mRNA used protein one. aware (maybe mistaken), arent strands different proteins. community minded approach freedom opposed individual freedoms.

We still supposed wear masks Victoria Australia's worst outbreak, part life normal again. Sacrifice worth risk sometimes mate chased away vaccines screaming Bill Gates going put chip you! like 40 prisoners Gitmo, considering vaccinating million people day really think going make huge difference? People less inclined big meet ups am, wear masks public transport shopping, looked area least (Sydney, Northern beaches) locked 2 weeks christmas/new year period sucked balls necessary greater good, kids meet go fishing surfing mates worth books.  point case lung damage specific covid, pneumonia, making headline bit clickbait. would depend state. I'm NSW. current recommendation (not rule) mask public transport, confined areas like classrooms can't separate, required hospital/medical settings. go pubs like, got leave contact details qr check in. Got email saying restrictions easing read yet.

All means case, number people exposed 3-4 day infectious identified minimised. lock down. ??
Hospitalizations jumped cliff almost every state mention bc lot people Florida - comment mentioned traffic NE factor higher rates.  read Hunter Thompson's voice alive today! Hahhahhahahha. really think anything done 'extreme measures'? Really?

Extreme measures would rounding anyone tested positive putting detention. would extreme. 

Being paid stay home, almost nothing. Reading accounts overseas horrifying, it. Especially reading effect kids. glad kids free normal childhood. Yes are. Like said. leave reenter, harder (need exemption leave quarantine return.) impossible, difficult.  Same. took daughter see Frozen musical middle Sydney today. Theatre packed full kids parents, everyone great time, lots laughter. went restaurant beforehand. “inconvenience” wear mask theatre also registering contact details restaurant also upon entering theatre.

Kids go school tomorrow, they’re happy interact teachers friends like normal. can’t go campus, it’s small price pay keep community safe. 

It’s draconian country freedoms threatened /s. country shut citizens require travel exemption leave far better case numbers do. think corona lead increase rolling around wether roller skates, skateboards bicycles God thankyou, whole argument ""but stop travelling"" tiresome... place stop travel people willing. tiny island 500 people, people travel work, food trucks run night day state state.. minimum movement necessary reasons. That’s (collectively) take shit seriously. require citizens travel exemptions taking higher number citizens back overseas. that's reality. calling liar? prove so. I’m sorry going this. completely right. People repeat rhetoric, doesn’t matter many facts rationales even personal stories have, keep repeating dogma. feels like country state collective psychosis. gaslighting given parents right pretty extreme. “Your kid isn’t suicidal loneliness hopelessness, bad parent! didn’t go family walks!” 

My best friend teacher 4 kids - 3 school age. One mental breakdown months ago 2 psych meds (she’s 12), 1 kid disabilities completely failed IEP ignored, 1 far behind academically needs IEP. says kids need school course go back too, coworkers failing her. I’be always complacent public school supporter lost faith year. essential workers stepped up, teachers left society down. Full stop. easy.. I'll give example: Sweden-Finland border, half nurses Swedish side commute Finland. Sweden's epidemic started growing last year. do? Close hospital, epidemic bad? Arrest nurses Sweden (although law that), tell kids parent picking daycare?

I'm saying done, I'm saying easy. Spoken like someone T_D.

Because pointed people like healthcare? Start dealing reality, weird narratives.  That's happens woke media, politicians, academics spent past half decade scaring black people thinking vaccines still used experiment sterilize them. People comments talking obese. Wrong arent allowed leave without government permission

And arent allowed enter without paying thousands spending 2 weeks hotel quarentine really. pretty normal here. People social distance get tested slightest symptoms outbreak (which usually virus escaped hotel quantine) area goes mini lock contact tracing done virus brought control. pretty good following rules, know greater good all. really can't unless get approved travel exemption, reuniting partner ailing parents children considered compelling reason enough granted approval leave. Watching crowds tennis exhibitions soon Australian open amazing. Really, really jealous countries priorities point populace enjoy fruits labor.   Fml France we've taken useless measures, kids protesting go back uni, mask less folks wandering streets slowly going towards 25k cases day people cant understand virus gone yet. Fuck, need move nz au Apparently caught neigh-bour, antivirals canter-acting virus he’s stable condition.  Protesting what? California stricter lockdowns state absolute disaster. 

Maybe ""lockdowns work"" extreme obvious lock downs alone solution. 2.5 million.

I honestly pity little bit WE'RE FUCKING still carrier still spread won’t get affected ie won’t fall sick. least 80% redditors literal children, mentally ill, addicted something. Realizing key staying sane cesspit. allowed 30 people house. 

Masks expected used public transport shops - although it’s enforced. Everyone though. least live.

You don’t need mask Eg pub. everytime enter somewhere scan say you’ve paid millions hospitals providing money saving thousands lives yeah probably deserve shot. Spoken like someone T_D. read anecdote added? course overjoyed system. drove someone dying ER away place hospital nearby terrible, would probably let die send bill, would never able afford ambulance bill top insured. drove two hospitals area considerations. first world healthcare hard find first world country, although exists. without vaccines easily transported administered. kidding, quick! anyone seen Seriously, put hold commuting borders people stop dying boatload.

I honestly wonder people WW2 complained turning lights night mitigate bombing raids. peoples willingness herded like also scary What? People travel interstate Australia constantly, majority cases come international travelers, AFAIK.

 Stop trying make excuses total failure US government policy. Instead excusing Trump administration state leaders (because exactly doing) maybe get furious. Yeah, go it, person wondering countries done it. harder settings others.  Lol. Australians test like crazy stop sounding jealous That's nice, point? suggesting vaccines go ""natives"" first ""white"" people can't poor can't bad healthcare?

If would read article would realize sovereign tribe Alaska distributing vaccines young healthy tribe members, regardless risk, anyone works profit businesses. None anything generational poverty historical crap people use justify feel good racism.

Meanwhile teachers Alaska high risk professions left cold. Please see [our answers frequently asked questions [questions regarding COVID-19 comments containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Is true? Looking numbers, UK US done soon vulnerable population   would increase mutation rate? RNA cannot recombine like DNA can. Interested anyone insight here. Um, check post history guess? sure prove I’m troll. middle-aged guy trying warn people hold line. it’s over. That’s all. boss COVID minimizer maybe feeds me? Idk  doubletake, thought said Rabbit. might need glasses Got it, taking things like fake news approach. Bold stance take, reminiscent former presidents view world. Working vaccination centre, I’m pleased queue good! takes time, time have

It doesn't, London time critical issues this. could court within day 2 two million per week eventually? That's even gonna put dent shortages shared UK

Yes massively failed task. lot done now. AZ received 330 million Euros 8 months produce 120 million vaccines best reasonable effort.

Yup, 3 euro per dose. Cheap chips.  EU get any, probably best say thank much. what's ""agenda""? Please tell.  standard wealth country always measured GDP. ""Economists politicians across globe use Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ultimate yardstick **measuring** ranking countries' **wealth"".**  Sorry hurts feelings.   Vaccines helpful people actually them. Maybe hot take, dare say, vaccine available anyone wants one, don’t get say “we can’t stop virus even though vaccines, may well give up.”

Particularly timeline expect actually enough vaccines anyone wants one get one. Impossible. US getting 10M vaccine doses week next 3 months. There’s supply constraint unfortunately. This. medical professional state whether showering works. Trust professionals. That's semantics. effective export ban matter call it. Everybody needs vaccines now, 6 months. We'll surplus vaccines give away 6 9 months time. Waw! huge cultural difference old people! vaccination 80+ got 98% acceptance rate. old people remember times vaccines polio TB everywhere. they're pro vaccine.

Do old people get annual flu jabs?  Many teachers ignoring safety measures though wanting sit asses home longer get paid same. job therefore pay be. adjusted pay teachers home would want go back work sooner. AZ panel virologists advising 12 weeks issue, information contrary?  Okay, [I guess India 6th wealthy countries like Canada Australia. People like twist anything fit agenda.  would much rather sit someone doesn’t give two shits masks sit shut-in get angry wearing 2 masks.

The shut-ins way miserable antimaskers. think it’s them, others (they say care others selfish way). Go r/collapse see point (or don’t go, sub garbage doomerism). Sheesh. Open today. Closed tomorrow. Completely agree reassure them. locked 2-3 months fully rather half Country ""Essential"" workers.

Hindsight that. Half population feel ""lockdown"" severe reality people like think joke. keep spreading misinformation. Stop that. *keep* posting shit last days matter many times people point you’re wrong. feel like people sub enjoy feeling bad feeding shit themselves. Yeah we've told UK's sovereignity important EU glorious organisation immediately proven otherwise first month leaving. even 30 days we're already seeing objective benefits come risk independent.

I understand issue larger that, makes doomsaying side look bit absurd. PCR tests extremely sensitive, would pick virus particles nose even enough infect you. fact people still testing positive vaccinated surprising. mean vaccine working.

Why PCR tests unreliable enough state well vaccines work, reliable enough lock people prevent e.g. flying? Yeah, believe rich countries done, help poorer countries, yeah. Source?   There’s also group 6, 65s conditions like diabetes. local hospital started vaccinating groups 5 6 last Friday. quote there. explain it. vaccine production facility Netherlands made contract manufacture AZ vaccines. production facility actual vaccine, bottling done Germany. plants also used EU order.

But still believe me? UK article explains Dutch plant production, German plant bottling. Dutch plant Firstly, production vaccine fluid happens three sites: Oxford Biomedica Oxfordshire, Cobra Biologics Staffordshire Halix factory Netherlands. know could make clear anymore.  TBF, state censorship thing. Thanks that's amazing. aren’t. US getting 1.5M doses vaccine day out. It’s impossible US give 3M doses. It’s supply constraint out, longer distribution administration problem. EU pissed, UK would receive 0 doses (exactly none produced UK, made germany/switzerland/elsewhere).

Guess EU pissed. Meanwhile France, today, total 24 people, 90 years age, offered dose covid-19vaccine. 

17 declined offer citing worries long term effects said vaccine. No, 50% increased transmissibility makes surge likely. know they’ve actually published contract completely dispelled, right? Pause thing end speed determine life go back normal?
Yeah no, whoever official needs shut fuck Yes definitely. reason Novavax able reduce number people trial confident early data, statistical significance proved right.

Novavax approved Canada soon, make priority it’s much effective vaccine Oxford/AZ get sooner They’re diverted, technically. We’re getting week like 20% 2 weeks, countries getting smaller reductions reductions all. 

So it’s basically amounts to. 

But contract quarterly there’s breach possible end March. sucks every day passes 1 infection becomes 2 becomes 3 becomes 5, etc. 6-12 weeks per Dr. Osterholm. Yeah stick isn’t bottleneck is. It’s logistics plus observation period vaccinate everyone else. roadmap exactly going work spelt yet, seems like teachers, police next line.

Then guess case working age groups. Yeah, strain really gone completely control UK, It’s detected world point. AstraZeneca oversold massively.

The vaccine due approval December. problems AZ trials US delayed request approval EU, AZ would supply hundreds millions doses US, UK, EU others vaccines paid months ago. would shortfall like? 90%? know Michael Osterholm is? COVID advisor Biden administration. He’s crank. Let lauder disappointment! LOL speak grandparents that's exactly say.

Actually say opposite. actually thank staying home saving lives they're assholes. Mostly talk hard me. realistically community transmission plummet big chunk phase 2 get shots. July 4th. Didn’t Canada low bid vaccines Fucking Pats fans... government mandated child abuse? That's totally insane. Wow that’s pretty cool! Lol guys silly  Doubt  Interesting! Everywhere went businesses always signs said masks required. I’ve definitely noticed lack signs masks lately though. &amp; definitely know mean! I’m good faith gets, dude. That's saliva comes from... numbers great sure, we're adopting ""delay second dose people get first dose faster"" strategy international medical opinion seems opposed to. I'd like positive right think need see plays calling indisputable success. Yeah I'm sure that's real reassuring 100k dead Government's incompetence 🙄 reason look far behind rest government decided care home seriously risk older folk first. Think we've pretty much finished care homes rest UK much less that.

Don't know better approach pointing out! course don’t want to. either indicates already dominant close dominant simply transmissible early reports said, transmissible people thought therefore become dominant.

either way US two half months, basically blows giant hole Osterholm's theory worst pandemic yet come fine. I'm bothered.

Retrospective data collection looking patterns common effects one fastest ways Ph.D days. true geniuses pushing forward idea. ""slightly less genius"" going back information already have, trying find missed, make science better. Prime Minister incompetent around 3 months front rollout. hope we'll able divert vaccine Europe point spring actually it. least want government telling everyone else roll vaccine quickly effectively, point going quite smoothly I'm sure pointers works would welcome.  would give anything pandemic over. I’m depressed wish things different. 

But doesn’t change reality. feel alone nobody even tolerate conversation it. Thanks. Hoping Easter. can’t keep July 4th  Honestly I've felt torn, still passionate remainer, yet pretty clear EU bad guys, outside it. Generally speaking doses allocated fairly population among 4 nations  Pfizer vaccine approved, small amount due start end Feb. vaccines AZ Novavax. actually dense?

What 2020 done - exposed unfathomable depths ignorance lot people there. I'm Ontario we've basically cut cases half within month due stricter measures tweak made vaccine go entire approval process again? propose new rule sub, allow submission whose title starts ""fears...""

You surely find one person fearing improbable spectacular scenario planet make headline it. Aye, smart making comment. I’ll leave tho. First closing borders would win anyone Europe. Second order work we're talking *literally* no-one nothing in, maybe slightly possible talking continents instead countries. ""Limited number countries"" lmao like majority countries planet. Third every single country/continent open borders would completely vaccinated imaginary perfectly sealed borders everyone else too. lastly even fantasy bubble would still pandemic going outside bubble humans would dying. Another person thinks viruses decay like radiation. don’t. 
Viruses evolve become infectious, spread more, become lethal, will. 
If increased ACE2 binding affinity means increased infectiousness increased morbidity, evolve become virulent. Actual title: Coronavirus: new clinical trials raise fears virus learning resist vaccines also used shit holes ground, piss river drank thought illness demonic nature. Although must admit crazy people still believe magic miracles invisible all-knowing (past/present/and future) somehow still think free scenario.

We used stone people saying ""right"" thing believing ""wrong"" thing refusing go along mass delusions.

Just shitty things happened past mean species continue them. Schools reopen, nephews school district opened since lockdowns ended May, kids seem happy didnt massive surge cases many predicted would happen. Without holding person classes kids losing quality education social growth needed early years life. also unrealistic shut airports everywhere. Also, covid everywhere air travel less threat community transmission mother law's nursing home outbreak covid start last week, three days staff residents due get vaccine. far everyone affected okay, fingers crossed stays way. school stuff poster today. Hmm... Thumbnail guy wearing mask fucking nose. God damn idiots everywhere mom works 4 year olds, 60s, ton pre-existing conditions. seen daughter literally year. sooooo close getting vaccine can't fucking wait. pharma sucks. pandemic wanted go anti-trust law express intention ""making pfizer executive cry"". still do, i'd take vaccine tho Hmm I’ve seen exact opposite. Massive layoffs furloughs anyone who’s ICU nurse. People Australia still need wear masks. They've continued rolling lockdowns cases pop up.

That's even remotely close situation here. last lockdown affected thousand people one tiny corner Sydney week Christmas New Year's Day southern part locked region 9 days January northern part. stuck south went Christmas vacation. that? South Australia one three days prior it'd months state one note.

Most rest country? Freely open disease free months. finished period compulsory masks public areas weeks NSW really big imposition anyway.

TL;DR - country's back normal many months rest country mostly normal greatly inconvenienced time either. Full sporting arenas no-one catching Covid-19 (because community anymore - actually we've 2 weeks detected cases anywhere country).

New Zealand's even better they've fully open domestically long stretches months time. They'll deal current situation quickly.

Anyway, multiple vaccines less year population's vaccinated next one, we'll reassess situation. may majorly inconvenienced couple years end even that. r/unexpectedmulaney I've ambulance couple times. never choose, always asked hospital wanted go to. dates numbers come play. Funding production 11th hour smallest price possible gets EU AZ. Funding well odds (so there's spare money manufacturing expansion) 5 months vaccine approved gets UK is. 

As already agreed, funding production funding R&amp;D, better funding neither (or funding late minimally can't help time).

Again, sources please look many articles mid/late last year panning UK ""wasting"" much money vaccines, EU's self promoted pride ""getting good price"" (which quite obviously means less money companies use scaling up). Let’s give shot, tried everything else🤦🏼 confuse ending pandemic ending disease.

Bringing cases fewer outbreaks help long COVID, that's vaccines for. Yes will. already bringing long covid kids discussions despite little evidence this. negative. I’m math. original poster said done Q3 I’m pointing hundreds days takes us Q3. not. One version virus bit better resisting vaccines, still numbers presented good vaccine needed stop virus. learned resist vaccine version started places vaccinated. Stop scaremongering clicks. get ya man. Here’s need know. Every. pandemic. Ends. Whether that’s vaccines. Herd immunity anything end. Humanity’s natural state existing without pandemic raging. take mankind’s years existing it’s thousands. amount spent outbreak probably like 60-70. don’t quote exact figures I’m fully confident it’s somewhere around I’m fairly sure. 

Now acknowledge question, variants alarming yes. probably continue avoid large gatherings check news like, week. Anymore found negatively correlates mental health. generally informed. vaccines still respond new variants, although lesser extent, still good extent. now, cases still seeing healthy decline. vaccines pacing quite well showing promise spring summer. 

This sub dangerous full pseudo scientist want covid last years years years. That’s advise staying away. Huh. Wonder happened smallpox polio? guess disappeared, like miracle. moderate vast majority business owners. great idea. Nurses often flu stickers badges, C-19 sticker patients informed. Neigh. Yeah throughout career too. read mismanaged AIDS horribly mean, lot asians flat noses wear masks, hmmmmmmmmmmmm Chinese lockdown necessarily best route either. China terrible human rights record stats can't trusted. Also, neighbours never locked low death rates, something could attributed cross immunity metabolic health CDC assessment masks.

Updated January 27, 2021 Easily dumbest suggestion I've read respect vaccine. don’t think assuming it. likely, giving extra space respect relative comfort level.

If you’re minority wearing mask, indicates you’re less comfortable risk getting infected want following social distancing protocols, give much space can. Compared others, could worn masks wanted to. give people extra space aren’t bothering simple precaution wearing mask? Thank kind words :) Hope nice weekend!! thought vaccine effect transmission Dramatic scenes Tonghua: Due corona outbreak, around 400,000 residents small Chinese town locked apartments houses almost overnight. Doors partially welded shut. lack food medicine.

1. family drove colorado

2. went hiking. Hiking outdoor low risk activity

They idea got likely hiking. I'd like clarification someone comment downvoted. I’d prefer Pfizer Moderna got offered J&amp;J tomorrow would take heartbeat. I'm going assume US, countries, social distancing exclusive COVID much controlled. Countries performed much better US recognized people asked forego socialization 4+ months maintained value social pods bubbles, really pushed US. 

I think idea ""pandemic buddy"" would caught Americans would rather massive parties leave house year, there's room nuanced management. Like what's say originate US tbh. genetic sequencing bad likely several homegrown variants already here. Bout time South American country registered 9,176,975 cases since pandemic began, official death toll risen 223,945, according ministry data, world’s third worst outbreak outside United States India second-deadliest.

But, yes. probably reach full herd immunity summer. think changing goalpost bit.
At moment, new vaccines changes amount dozes, goverment says able vaccinate every risk person (no matter age) mid June. every person sort sickness start July. 
The government already said see us able go back pretty normal life. point, ""it flu"" people start correct locking much go well. Also need cut back carbon emissions, think traffic many roles could done elsewhere.  Floridian, agree Desantis this. 

Lockdowns also work also willing shut airports. much easy catch flight place fewer restrictions, get COVID there, bring back anyway expect things look close normal California then, minimal restrictions. super important always find multiple sources something. Like you, iv seen lot ""welded homes"" videos, also wider angle ones show another entrance checkpoint.

I say Aussie philosophically opposes Chinese government every way, would never advocate behalf.

Misinformation needs pointed stopped though.  pls explain mean? first inclination reading panic, worried less ... paper, lockdown. Let's real though, tons people ignored June. easily get indoor haircut. friends SF SD getting regular haircuts since June. make appointment barber take care it. highly reputable company like get 70-80% people decide normality back. gradual process happen approach number cases drop well hospitalizations deaths We’re already seeing drop U.S, however, Fauci said that’s even cause vaccines yet. good news.

Christ even horses safe... paying attention. They've looking variants consequence since beginning. matter _more_ infectious. Brazil maybe dangerous. Mutations also impact vaccine effectiveness.

Yeah friends teachers Chicago everything city us horse shit. I’m happy strong union, would even worse. Evil hippie  Fauci best track record honesty transparency. like 12 months tomorrow Pandemic.

Well longer 12 months go date issues global health emergency yeah 31st. It’s quite stretch say “both lives put risk”. probably wearing masks, nurses likely wearing N95s. Even happen infected asymptomatic presymptomatic, contagion mostly contained masks offered protection yours. Us healthcare workers seeing patients safely whole ordeal without vaccine. 

Every visit hospital “putting life risk” standard it. could catch antibiotic resistant staph infection sitting exam table. blood drawn. 

But risk highly unlikely medical professionals tend take proper precautions prevent them. makes sense? Vaccine protects virus still doesn’t stop transmitting get it. vaccine? 92 people 26 outbreaks really many. supposed make people scared schools reopening something? really reassuring ! get lot hate r/Chicago. don’t hear hate offline conversations though. that. That's never answer. reason think gone permanently. Wait til mutated variety gains traction, pessimistict I'm home day everyday researching everything that's occurring discovering reasons behind events transpired way did.

And I've seen continent developing different version mutated variant, vaccine currently developed provide immunization earlier less mutated strain.

And cases rise people getting either one vaccines shortly passing away we're left ""currently investigating""

I'll leave y'all this, raise PH certain foods drinks, dunno top head... look  post full criticism doubt emotional terminology. 
The reason scientists doubts coronaviruses highly able mutate evade immunity, either natural vaccine induced. 
Part reason west done badly knee-jerk reaction possible negative news. 
Optimism great, it’s way ignoring possibilities don’t like. Chicago enters Phase Four, following regulations place:  

* Indoor dining indoor events remain limited lesser 25% capacity 25 people per space 
* industries limited lesser 40% capacity 50 people 
*  Bar seating allowed indoor table size increase 6 people 
*  Non-essential business curfew repealed
* Bars restaurants able extend operating hours midnight, alcohol service 11pm

Of course easily avoidable vaccinating dominant strain, yeah, wanted relay info got guys.  get time using curbside pickup wdym???? hear that? contrary everything I've heard. Lol post history tho one ironic issues. kids hurt come urban districts. people seem fervent keeping schools closed: 20-somethings without kids sitting behind keyboards day political groups.

Even severity contagius much deadly numbers. Faster scalability. Nice cherry picking.

Jesus christ, *thank you*. scroll wayyy far see this. food varieties. Look facts.

DeSantis sued release reports CoVID19.

DeSantis attacked data scientist reporting FL data.

DeSantis alluded people testing positive never tested, ton people counted deaths died car accidents (both proved false).

DeSantis revamped positivity rate multiple negative tests count negatives first positive count positives.

DeSantis mis-construes daily deaths making seem like happened past, well know worst daily deaths coming roost now.

The guy fudges everything. strategy let disease spread people die going die? You’re making mistake thinking they’re news agencies. They’re advocacy groups now. Especially stuff like Vox New York Times. They’re news. wear seatbelts cars, drive rules safety features car.

We teach kids swim, get trouble get trouble water.

We smoke detectors, circuit breakers safety features.

All things described dangerous life threatening risk management strategies reduce risk.

You strategy deal covid ""send kids schools there's evidence kills kids"".

It killed kid best strategy get covid restrict movement, social distance public, wear mask public, sanitise hands.

Getting kids wear masks sanitise hands social distance impossible, therefore best strategy event outbreak stay fuck home remote learning.  district Wisconsin mom teaches sends emails every new positive case staff parents. It’s hard continual posts Reddit rave amazing wfh one go back office ever It’s like don’t want pandemic end, don’t like talking people.

I honestly think people minority. Let offer little reality check someone who's fortunate enough work home since March, also following fairly strict restrictions avoid catching COVID, meaning limit outdoor dog walks, grocery stores, essential errands absolutely needed. I've done zero restaurants/takeout/fast food since March.

I love working home, think great, would love continue pandemic control/over. get spend time dog, choose 2 hours commuting day 40 minutes commuting day $15/day parking pass, eating home certainly less expensive. would make better able social work day over. would love get back meeting friends/family happy hour heading NBA game, getting together extended family birthday/holiday celebrations. Since March, I've seen dad person, seen brother person, seen friends family person. sucks can't wait change. miss going movie theater, body misses access gym, would like able go events (concerts, etc).

As work, times miss office. I've worked hospital &amp; research institution 17 years, many connections there. nice attend weekly research conference person visit on-campus cafeterias chance encounters old friends colleagues may cross paths virtually. 

Ideally, would like work home option office, say reservable desk space. important meeting would like person want attend research conference person? Reserve desk/kiosk day. importantly, want avoid returning daily grind commuting cubicle meetings/nothing important in-person I'm there. Yes, occasional water cooler conversation nice, expense 2 hours day public transit. 

tl;dr: us like working home miss pre-pandemic freedoms/aren't hermits, think there's happy medium going back office commuting mimicking quarantine WFH bubble pandemic control.  known many doses J&amp;J ready time approval? Applebee’s

You're right, also TGI Fridays. Would go anywhere way we’re acting? Republicans: self-proclaimed party small government giving small businesses leverage. exactly virologist Pasteur institute warned about. particular people infected HIV depressed cell responses, leaving lingering slow burning asymptomatic cases neutralising antibodies keep viral titres low provide constant pressure virus evade antibodies. 
This would explain Brazil South Africa seen novel variants arise. Lolz takes like day sequence assemble viral genome lol, small genomes.

Seeing pattern here: 

As 1/15/2021 covid deaths: 

🇺🇸: 400k

🇨🇳: 4,635 🤔 

🇻🇪: 1,090 🤔

🇨🇺: 160 🤔

🇻🇳: 35 🤔

🇱🇦: 0 🤔

🇰🇵: 0 🤔 So, 1 5 listed currently 'working'. 4?  it’s anything Miracle Whip, they’re lying Minnesotan. would need approved FDA CDC, yes, would need fully fledged trials would less vaccine.

At point vaccines still effective new variants including South African ones. J&amp;J Novavax claim vaccines nearly 100% effective preventing hospitalization death South African strain. looking likely seasonal climate affect covid. Florida warm humid might excellent conditions preventing covid spread thus affect comparisons states. LOL school districts upfront numbers... theres testing. 

How upfront numbers any? Thank gold you! people wear masks loose. people bend metal part surgical masks shape nose. alone really helps keep up. Cases also dropped lot Michigan nationwide (mainly peaked significantly earlier). mean definitely probably contributed, obesity one influential comorbidities covid.  warp speed plan included important part, injecting vaccine people? good millions vaccines dump states tell please? one time federal government could shown us actually something right, right vaccine. really hope Biden's administration better previous administration doing. It’s kind hard tell face, lot kids fat heads, sure maybe he’s obese doesn’t look like super morbidly obese. Regardless, point he’s big doubt weight cause death people pointing assholes. publish details Sinopharm vaccine?

Sinovac efficacy seems mixed bag ranging 50% 90%. true test elderly? Like Manaus?  husband got shingles 30 Canada. swears antivirals prescribed. flu kill children.

""Just flu"" stupid flu contagious would big fuckin deal.  Yes making fun dead children pinnacle civility Israel using Pfizer Moderna vaccines. new ones, e.g. J&amp;J. J&amp;J eliminates severe cases really protect getting mildly symptomatically infected. article eliminating **severe cases**, reducing number cases eliminating transmission vaccinated people start mixing rest society transmission rates start going staying down, bye-bye, long COVID.

It depends vaccine. everyone gets Pfizer, Moderna Novavax would help stop spread making majority population immune. everyone gets J&amp;J would onlyb help reduce number hospitalizations, stop spread prevent people getting long hauler. way early vaccines. Jeez. get COVID without irresponsible. virtue signaling quite counterproductive.  Well vaccines seem 100% (or near it) decreases hospitalization. reality is, nobody dying it, people likely care restrictions anymore regardless restrictions place still get second shot even delayed little bit longer 21/28 days. 

You contact clinic explain need reschedule second shot. Hopefully find proper Med &amp; dose too! 

Also, steps getting diagnosed &amp; expensive “expensive hell” lolol point society tolerate level risk everything do. opinion people really lost perspective level risk acceptable, pointing level hypocrisy people willing hold 600 kids point moral outrage, accept everything else list normal part life. Kids engaging riskier behavior covid, relatively lower risk covid compared things used excuse keep kids school. hurt you? 50 million lot considering \~1 month. point uncivil. Mean spirited maybe, that's sane thing. hurt you? Indeed. getting cells build target proteins, mRNA vaccine *look* like virus, also sort *acts* like it. can't help think word 'Eskie' going removed common usage soon. California, Kaiser vaccinating non Kaiser elderly right now. understand need vaccinate elderly, continue keep saying don’t enough Kaiser members? *plenty* evidence, specific Covid. Covid vaccine fails confer general, system-wide reduction severity line reduction specific severity infection rate we've already observed, breaks rules vaccination know them. Put another way: evidence suggest vaccine another illness cuts spread reduces severity line we've seen Covid vaccine, nonetheless fails mitigate long-term organ impairment? Closed borders mostly non-essential travel. affect vaccine deliveries. EU borders open vaccines. makes feel better 14 pretty shit year lots people, even pre-pandemic. I’m hoping things get back normal appreciate fuck have. literally people arguing CDC private organization therefore covid protocols interest people like Bill Gates. really understand people made far life. Anyone looking data could that’s abundantly clear  Hopefully true even 89%   test neuropsychologist. expensive hell worth weight gold. took weeks get appointment too. I'm adderall xr 15mg. biggest issue impulsive thinking. mind slows enough think things. also energy day get everything agenda completed. still lazy days even get shit done.

And actually stuff day, I'm tired night longer stay til midnjght. never slept better life wake ready take shit on. Wow. Thanks superb write up. helpful! It’s fixed. true. may liked bamboozled bit score ;) Wtf wrong people?! prevent 4000 childhood deaths keeping kids away cars another 1000 keeping kids away water. prevent deaths? I've told school already fact, I've submitted form everything ugh

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* every pandemic (or disease general) always pharmaceutical interventions (drugs, vaccines) non-pharmaceutical ones (masks, lockdowns, travel bans, social distancing, curfews, etc). governments Europe US able use non pharmaceutical interventions effectively various reasons - example police chiefs US elected local voters impossible Governor President boss around get enforce lockdown effectively. We're also Japan local people compliant enough voluntarily pandemic *too* bad there. 

But we're absolutely destroying COVID pharmaceutical industry. Europe US best vaccines from. Regeneron from. COVID treatments perfected local hospitals. makes proud - ability scientists wreck disease despite barely cooperation local citizens. thanks mRNA vaccines we'll able nip future vaccine bud, amazing invention since Penicillin discovered. Yes, losses short term long term we've forever eliminated pandemics concept - thanks US European scientists. thinking small local, I'm thinking big global. Wtf dont even know parents exposed. unlikely sick 16 days ago didnt show symptoms 2 weeks. directly exposed parents probably either. worry telling school everything else list. part community. Hold standard others will. Update That's 600 kids die. it'd better 600,000 died it'd matter, right? statistically significant? Mass casualties puts things perspective guess?

There's 9200 child deaths every year makes 600 6.5% deaths COVID. disease everyone says kids affected by.

These likely preventable deaths too, kids (and teachers, school staff families) put risk politicizing masks, dissention general recommended public hygiene protocols, complete lack government leadership, funding schools open properly. Americans incessant urge splice every conceivable dataset race, publish results absence known cause context, leaving public draw own, often nefarious, conclusions. habit recipe disunity, bitterness, resentment. gives illusion victimisation whether actually exists not; manufactures purpose intent. 

What measured COVID19 death rate differences IOS Android users? blondes redheads? Irish Americans German Americans? cases would likely see difference. meaningful beyond vagaries happenstance something stochastic clumpy disease propagation? 

Of course people list litany putative causes. innocuous (eg Hispanics bigger family gatherings); others divisive (eg prejudiced doctors make less effort help them). nobody estimates proportion variance explained cause. Maybe innocuous causes explain 99% variance? absence estimates causal effects, public left grasp whatever personal axe grind. left less happy less united citizenry. sake click-bait journalism. Considering Trump fucked around entire pandemic, i'd say we're well now. it’s longer novel people’s immune systems likely low transmission summer.   Hang - end sight (vaccines)! contact 16 days there's something like .03% chance caught shown symptoms yet. Well 99% infected individuals show symptoms within 12.5 days. people ate probably caught covid later week ten days sick. would EU skip Biontech/Pfizer? far, best vaccine EU biggest order 600 million doses. Biontech enter partnership produce even more, would rather skip vaccines. area, 73% deaths come Long Term Care Homes assisted living make way less 1% population. targeted vaccination program huge decrease deaths soon.  


From PHO: 

* 2 weeks first dose vaccine effectiveness 92.6% Pfizer 92.1% Moderna
  * Short term protection achieved rapidly high
  * Easy\_Beg. Note: numbers general population. Older people would probably little lower efficacy 

So two weeks 1st dose see rapid decrease LTCH residents getting covid-19. couple weeks see drastic decrease deaths. LTCH residents generally hospitalized see much change numbers large groups elders vaccinated.  Yeah heard everyone would vaccinated January according last guy president. people keep repeating bullshit lost jobs economy crashing?

Because literally saw tons people lose jobs March states shut down? Thank you! required receive flu shot employer file paperwork get flu shot someone outside employer (my employer flu shot clinics make easier us get flu shots keep track got flu shot). confident FDA fully approves COVID19 vaccine, employer COVID19 vaccine. Thanks, sorry hear. Isolation tough. bright side, vaccines coming handle bit longer, even weigh like that. comments section filled arguing schools open, kids? don’t, stake game need stop. aaand get misinformation folks. 

Apart apartment lockdown, actually prevent significant spread virus, rest said bullshit.

- Pregnancy nothing it. dumb asshole trying arrange large gathering told specifically could not. Right middle outbreak.
- Never heard it
- never heard it
- article zero credibility
- didnt lie *going pizza place*, lied delivery driver said pizza place turned spread much larger area contact tracers mapped.
- ""OMG NEW STRAIN""? cant even begin state fucking dumb comment is. new *variant* potential spread significantly faster (and UK Ireland. growth numbers terrifying). 

""On assumption know best""...

Do know many cases community past 12 days? - Fucking NONE.  vast majority (like 99%) people will, symptoms all, show symptoms 14 days. Either parents asymptomatic cases, perhaps likely, didn’t catch it. Ahhh that’s thing United States? totally get perspective - main frustration lack information available. vaccine rollout happening, hoping much effort put quantifying risks. common brain damage? mechanism? common MIS-C? long term danger developing complication young person infected?

I jazzed vaccines coming out. improve situation greatly. think people assuming vaccines solve problem entirely, that's hopeful assumption. thing moving faster goalposts censorship good quality posts containing truth around here. That’s implying, yes.  Trust broken US Canada far nothing done repair relationship.

Nothing needs done. forget leaders to. get choose reliant trading partner is. case, US would stopped trading china years ago. block place letting others choose get vaccine? Percent Californians 65+ years age 14.8% vs 20.9% Florida. Considering 95%+ deaths occurring 65+ age category, Florida slightly better.

It's much government that's issue. 

Most Australian's taking precautionary action federal government advising. initial outbreak would worse, people federal government said.

Fact is, Australian's looked told would needed done keep everyone safe, said ""shit's fucked, fair cop"" it.

Melbourne literally 3 months lockdown get 0 cases, police everywhere issuing fines enforce it. Australian, confirm major dickhead. Possible Election later year I'm sad say probably get whole media saying great thanks Murdoch hard get out.  I'm happy inperfect response, isolated airbases used quarentine possibly worst affected country earth even consider helping anyone else dumbfounds me.

I'm UK btw. fucking world think cashier's flying round trip every day work? 

Where world people flying round trip every single day job? (other flight attendants/crew) ""commuting"" travel days/weeks day trip blue moon. Serve Man want healthy sperms lockdown coming mask mandate. case comes security guard working hotel new arrivals quarantined. this, community transmission 10 months - mandatory masks period would burn people build complacency they'd feel point it, means would harder enforce actually needed.  European countries, many described (One U.K's closest neighbors even greater non-compliance rate vs U.S comes government). way harder control borders among European countries.

Similar case U.S terms geographical problem. Even states went full lock mode, would plenty others right doorsteps.

The Australian method would work countries, actually possible implement. getting everyone proximity page monumental challenge. hard compare two, least without acknowledging differences nuance currently exists. also part reason I’m confused. WA myself, currently hiding AC.  vodka bottle, planned open got vaccine, mainly pun value. Good news. Australia urbanized UK. Look up. US new case every 0.5-0.6 seconds average. I've lockdown year, got nothing angry  Correct. mean Clive Palmer did. federal government eventually came said Clive Palmer drop case realized public opinion sat. know someone's still getting vaccine right? binning turned down. probably went someone could get much benefit it.  Sorry what? Calling investigate origins covid blaming insulting China.
You've clue...... played XCom games, storyline reason siding alien invaders? interesting me. becoming infectious lead becoming deadly well

When say this, mean deadly per person, deadly entire population? Ummm. Coming someone lives Queensland spend way time indoors summer winter.  wife's family invited us new years got mad go. Well fuck elderly mom going 20+ meetup [Yeah, well, prove anything zero evidence claims. So? Despite low population density due size Australia it’s fairly urban country population living within major capital cities. give shit put effort. lot comes good effort states. hospital donor - special treatment means new wing care others, say isnt worth it?


I think that's bad arguement. Firstly healthcare properly funded one reliant rich people building hospital wings. guess reality US fine guess argument work, reinforces bad things there.

Second, argument basically saying ok prevent vulnerable person getting vaccine potentially dying rich person use money save people (if compelled to). argument end though? people Titanic right prioritise rich people life boats good money poor people? subject sobering statistics:

48 US states (49 including DC) cases Australia. Wyoming, state fewer 600,000 people, nearly twice many cases Australia 25 million. Hawaii weeks away 49th state overtake Australia. 

39 US states deaths per million people Australia deaths per 25 million. wearing mask extreme full lockdown isnt? real, shout dudes waiting cosplay Mad Max bandanas within hour press conference. here. (middle east) Well, old people probably will, that's best hope for. Yes, suppose disclaimer IMO whatever consider ""livable wage"" tripled quadrupled. Give ""fuck you"" levels money. still less year cost shutting single day. vaccination campaigns seem exception rather norm.

The UK vaccinates fair every year flu jab. Here’s data Public Health England extrapolated number GP registered patients recorded vaccinated 2018 2019 season 14,351,245

[Seasonal influenza vaccine uptake GP patients: winter season 2018 extrapolated number GP registered patients recorded vaccinated 2019 2020 season 14,566,163 (Table 1).

[Seasonal influenza vaccine uptake GP patients: winter season 2019   Hot weather stops spread COVID? Less people indoors?? Nah. Unless recent outbreak. I’m Queensland it’s pretty much back normal now. Although outbreak weeks ago three day lockdown followed ten days compulsory mask wearing. 

We tend lock states cities pretty quickly though outbreak must hotel quarantine enter. Beautiful ! US version chart? apply US well (which would assume rolling vaccination least well UK is). we're getting days, middle-east... I'm worried. want legit, I'm hoping better nothing! Oi oi oi! answered above, socal florida similar climates all. Uh media large history broken healthcare system Wow that’s crazy. I’m guessing see something Charlie Hebdo Macron trying get old ass wife vaccinated. maybe she’s going bad reaction bc filler injections. seriously really something. friends Lyon always laughing us Trump. Looks like macron new trump  Yea, speed fk up. Run 24/7 sites people willing queue cars wait. Enough w articles get people attacking getting what...just go go go go go don’t think buffets cafeteria style restaurants die people want another roaring 20s pandemic ends. 10 months without single case community.
Hopefully got top quickly enough prevent much longer lockdown. gets pretty cold CA. Even la chilly winter. Combination good government measures, BCG vaccine, doctors willing try unorthodox measures. shut site 2 hours. appointments missed. Oh dear. First, let address scientist comment, since scientist. best scientists world, come guarantee scientific success particular endeavour. comment bit naive.
Secondly. realise argument vaccine produced Belgium, say UK doesnt get vaccines EU. contradict yourself.
Thirdly, UK funding vaccine undertaken Covid19 outbreak. development vaccines yet achieved success. public funding provided EU built upon work already undertaken UK, true say UK funded want nothing.
I agree, it, sure hell ability stop export. Lets hope come this. shut site 2 hours. appointments missed. Australia highly urbanised population home world's third-busiest air route two largest cities.

It huge geographic advantage sure, ""a miracle virus like could survive there""? agree all. interconnected country extremely wealthy mobile population. Hopefully you’ll go went Brisbane weeks ago. hotel quarantine cleaner test positive UK strain three day lockdown. person ended catching partner. Ten extra days masks we’re back normal. 

I trust serious WA taken COVID hopefully able get past quickly! Western Australia bigger Europe. Luckily uninhabited. Countries want avoid massive cost virus getting loose pay workers $$$$$ live quarantine hotels. Work two months, isolate 19 days, two negative tests go 18 days break come back start cycle again. would leave hotel grounds work time. that's $$$$$. Beats millions lost caused outbreaks. WA: hold beer stupid. Anti-vaccination stupid. actively protest vaccination malicious. actively try impede vaccination vulnerable citizens *evil*. Particularly since bunch confirmed locations infectious case went petrol stations! Everyone better sanitizing pumps (they're not). light unto nations indeed! needed hope, great! Thats misinformation. adf offer help logistics, never guards. Dan andrews took culpability regardless complete humility. world first turned could uk level disaster 0 cases continuously. One best politicians aus. parents moved home due health issues. We're hispanic except husband. kids remote learning, husband working home, parents retired, job taking care dad. think parents caught covid doctor's appointment. spread quickly household.

Me dad went ICU day. nurse told husband likely would die keep hope would make through. weeks. dad unfortunately died Christmas. covid, overweight health issues. I'm still oxygen, use walker, heart issues lungs scarred. husband told afraid mom also going admitted hospital. current circumstances don’t see employee/ potential employee leg stand decided fight vaccine requirement. You’re forced work particular company, put list requirement don’t like piss off.  parts US late stop first wave, New York, Boston, Detroit, Pacific Coast. could saved much US internal border controls, Australia still NZ also used second wave Auckland. 

There argument US Constitution prevented this, fact Supreme Court precedent 1900 declare state border closures unconstitutional room states least try close borders. NZ's lockdown actually ruled illegal NZ courts, govt anyway passed retroactive law making legal, future. 

The failure 49 50 US governors even attempt manage borders shows lack political courage. closing border even mean banning entry, requiring 2 week managed quarantine anyone entering state. Hong Kong Taiwan manage quarantines electronic monitoring, NZ Aus use hotels.

In US UK window could eliminated virus. summer numbers low US states, lower Victoria outbreak. true UK. lockdown then, instead opening could eliminated virus prevented massive autumn/winter wave. 

But whole thing politicised US impossible. again, incompetent politicians politicising pandemic failing provide economic support needed lengthy elimination lockdown, culture willing go along doomed US lesser extent UK. Onion snag = totalitarian government 5 days contract tracing without spread still go buy food, visit doctor exercise, stop sooking wear mask. r/agedlikemilk   Let's see happens ill-advised (by me, anyway) Australia Open gets underway. Can't think better way spread fresh outbreak across entire country. Good luck that.  least. Lives stake here. different environment could done manslaughter. Melbourne sydney much bigger population wise per gdp every uk city bar london. valid point england much packed australia. However city melbourne dense humans area england defeated here. cases reaching high hundreds Jobkeeper Monthly payments since the.pandemic started. Yeah would be, you’re absolutely sure long term effects rare? Yeah fuckng awful especially Victoria. Idgaf people saying must crazy privileged gone bullshit lockdown totally ok it.

We trapped. hate it. I'd love travelling right could.

Life also wont normal masks completely idiots get little virtue signaling high horses. Back March/April case numbers growing control measures implemented Australia heading winter. summer heat advantage virus Northern Hemisphere squandered it. imagine achieved single digit daily cases? Would rather happy 100s even 1000s dying daily? last time heard ventilators? would. Life acts strange ways. Anyway fear same. Quaranteeing like hell, hopefully vaccine rollout speed ramp soon.

Boy was... lot also month cases December too? Well defiant attitude works ways. French better work week, better working conditions, lower inequality, less general apathy towards government politics versus Australia.

Governments scared people France. Australia, governments get away lot apathy. Sometimes good thing, sometimes opposite.  yeah pretty much, consultants another big one. basically anyone might meetings Melb could day trip via plane

Fuck  know barber shops still take walk ins. course looks closed outside think countries going give lives citizens service outdated Cold War conceit?! That's point.

This virus deadly enough taken seriously. Hey hey hey, stfu. let American public know they'll throw masks go bar celebrate. basketball is, even close killed second command Iran early 2020 nearly got us war Iran. shit middle east except cause disaster like pulling without warning letting allies kurds get slaughtered. piece shit through... plan malice. Things like office workers visiting HQ meeting? makes sense, type travel hold least Europe, simply can't imagine nurses, teachers, cashiers flying every day shift. Maybe I'm wrong, Australia really amazing place. Yeah, even though there’s new variants virus, wonderful Governor decided lift regional SAH order, definitely wasn’t political move didn’t sole GOP supervisor LA County praising it! 

/s (in case) Luckily last year essentially business normal like June onwards. Music festivals, sporting events, nightclubs etc. know well lockdowns worked us past happy comply order prevent spreading. 

We get freedom, oppose spreading live half ass life things fucked. Tasmania SA quarantine outbreak government agreed pay workers full time wage even working full time bonus generally pretty boring also probably important job State. people nerve co-opt ""my body, choice' slogan.

While forcibly denying people choice get vaccinated. Thanks revealing thinking. believe merely calling someone ""terrorist"" gives right shoot sight. Real Americans believe that, course idea think. Well president US often regarded leader free world maybe. talking about? come back Australia, get tested go 2 week quarantine. one case caused 85%of state go intimate lockdown quick response stop spread. bit panic looks UK strain I’m sure think point I’m going choose believe him.

Could get burned? Absolutly. It’s weird position think legit. spent billion dollars putting refugees prison. bet could build staff pretty good facility amount money. many idiots live world... OK, care lives, endanger lives health people, unacceptable. allergy penicillin vaccine try take? even vaccine people penicillin allergies. set state state generally.

But honestly places, know pandemic all.

Some people aware generally, lot employers bit smarter employees taking time sick. often sign places well. everything totally open, life basically normal. big true imo, think /u/normalcoolguy Lol really? Pretty sure scott morison gave state leaders power act way. That’s fucking great leadership WA big state population concentrated Perth.

2 million living Perth metro area density 320/km² (830/mi²).

It's particularly dense 80% state population one city. population concentrated though Perth South West. Fwiw health experts said Dr. Fauci right take 85 even 90 percent herd immunity completely stop coronavirus transmission, Dr. Lipsitch said, “we still defang virus sooner added: “We don’t zero transmission order decent society. lots diseases, like flu, transmitting time, don’t shut society that. vaccinate almost people risk severe outcomes, would become milder disease.”

Link article: all! look maps, see major population centers near state borders Australia - driving work Melbourne Canberra every simply work. exceptions, course, I'm sure Victorians needed work Albury something, number feasible give special permits.

In US, case. Look Kansas City, example. number people crossing state border much higher Australia, number roads crossing border impossible check points everywhere. guess could organize closure along river instead state border something, easy (and that's I'm saying, totally impossible).

Explore map find ton places like - Chicago Louisville suburbs extending Indiana, Portland Washington, St. Louis Illinois.. Aussie citizens - intelligence shitty leadership manipulative media.

Hold line!!! 💎👨‍🎓💎👨‍🎓💎👨‍🎓💎👨‍🎓💎👨‍🎓💎👨‍🎓💎👨‍🎓 Lol... That's funny cue lockdown orders again. Indeed are. I’ve taken many selfies too.  shame tough making sure people working quarantine hotels second job could easily fixed paying full time wage regardless hours, States stared second time happened. Actually adding would get 18 million. means would take less 100 days point hit goal 18+ vaccinated summer. Go lie mate 20 imported cases Europe, 5 community cases. probably different days day trips pretty common work

it top 3 4 busiest air routes world pre-COVID  95% world handle virus worse us, Taiwan faired better they’ve suffered before, plans place followed them, strictly. let’s talk US, Germany, Japan, Italy, France, UK, number world powers suffered great losses, Australia faired decently discounting odd claim “draconian measures” majority population happy measures taken, hence landslide victory qld state elections, Anastasias border policy massively popular Queenslanders.

Yes, tennis debacle atrocious, afl, think comes balance, haven’t worked perfectly yet. We’re still better position much world show coming months. say case elsewhere. discussing public reaction specific lockdown relates circumstances Western Australia, live article about.

I'm sorry personally faced challenges strict lockdowns pandemic, comment way attack judgement peoples circumstances.

A person discuss particular subject, without somehow critique whatever related subjects they're discussing. good points there. agree remain ignorant downright nutters - private citizens public life. However believe - grateful fact - types yet reached critical mass degree countries. countries unfortunately holding back rest world eradicating this. see part /u/TazJayC said places this, like this. jumping gun bit. also feel like rich fucks also spend time riskier activities putting poor workers risk, least maybe spares people unfortunately come contact safety net sucks. 

I agree though- probably could’ve done fair equitable way truly someone else running vaccine program it’s going almost two months it’s kind like welp jab whoever around jabbed. huge controversy close state border U.S.

It big deal Australia.

It also lot harder control border closures, another matter. Moral story is, governments can't want, ignoring voters bases.

Even Trump office, see Biden suddenly hold summit state governors close borders, enforce hard lockdowns etc.

What see change posture promotes mask wearing, self isolating. might see mandates around masks stuff U.S federal government workers buildings. nothing like Australia has. reason people accept readily Aussies do. say one Australia disagrees government. Australians make big deal, still vote premiers leaders implement strict measures. pay shit basically? That’s I’m hoping. Well ease contract specified best effort rather guaranteed deliveries opposite here!
when see slightly higher temp people, means fever.

more people need understand 98.6° one size fits all. lockdowns better persist I’m done going outside anymore. hell business owners suffered great losses. don’t think anyone ever say that. What’s going happen governments let restrictions people start feeling safe things pandemic. That’s normalcy happen, one wave magic wand say “it’s normal now” yeah 20s days pretty mild?  mandatory quarantine system incoming arrivals?

better question mandatory quarantine *March* 2020. becomes fucktonne less effective longer delay it. think study released early 3 day delay lockdowns 3 week extra time needs spent get stamp   Boy that's happening state (Oregon). county health department clue getting vaccine day get them. anything gotten worse half rules gone window. there’s one thing believe pandemic US, one main enablers human stupidity. sounds stupid say haven’t thought - hospital same. one unit covid except people got Dec/early Jan vaccine still sick. Nearly staff vaccinated it’s weeks since I’ve known anyone covid.  point think media / politicians / health experts finally crack admit normalcy come risk inoculated magic “zero covid / 90% threshold” thing reached? R-value calculated FHM Sweden around 0.9 moment. R-value site says 0.3 based deaths. would probably gotten accurate number took reported deaths last week instead deaths occuring last week, since number complete.

I think numbers taken grain salt uncertainty exist data sources countries Canada vaccine manufacturing infrastructure unfortunately  Yea older get realize time way massively changing public opinion event. interesting watching R's go thought ""pro war"" party ""anti war"" party Trump, D's opposed mid-east wars right Trump started pulling troops out. man D's ever hate GW!

Even left-leaning Reddit people fawn (like whenever video throwing first pitch 9/11 shown). scroll comments glowing praise GW always find older confused person comments saying something like ""wait, like GWB now?"" lol. always cracks little.

It interesting future generations think Obama, Trump etc. think time way smoothing rough edges them.

I guess people take conspiracy theories seriously sub. clear saying microchip vaccin (and chip could independent type vaccin lol). process put chip market slight variants (or revision) seems analogous one vaccine (need tested various conditions/populations, long term effects (micro-chips last forever), interfacing chips vs reactions hosts etc ...)

Thanks unsubstantiated claim, us live reality give respect deserves. understand temptation. micro-managing federal level going make things worse. many cooks kitchen.

States already created plans vetted feds. They're executing them. key re-plan, key demand accountability. 

The thing feds might *consider* passing laws demanding accountability states. laws could involve shaming states even individual hospitals perform poorly (color-coded maps rankings based efficiency giving vaccines), financial incentives penalties, etc. Correct I'm wrong thing mutating since last February? urgency now? kind you! I'm sure appreciate it!

No? robust immune response. 85% protection severe disease 100% protection hospitalization deaths. quite something. Yea sure. I'm wild Trump US remarkably well compared wealthy countries vaccine rollout.

ETA: also nonsense. assuming businesses would laid workers there's evidence say true. would restaurant continue pay employee who's working? makes sense. would furlough that's exactly happened. Australia great government response unemployment rate went up. New Zealand incredible response saw unemployment rate increase. lying saying unemployment rate would increase government provided assistance. Israel finished vaccinating oldest part population weeks ago 

Not really, we've started giving second doses 3 weeks ago, administered last two weeks (nearly half last week). two weeks ago 2.6% Israeli population got second dose. there's deaths lag behind hospitalization lag behind new cases means need wait drop manifest got second dose recently.

Another large factor lot variance demographics, demographics % elderly vaccination extremely low, often demographics largest COVID spread unwillingness follow restriction. differences sometimes massive, secular cities like Ranana Kiryat Mozkin 50% 1st dose 30% second, Jerusalem 20% 10%, Beitar Elit 8% 3.5% (the numbers bad first appear later cities much younger demographic still significant).

This manifests different results, graph change number cases 10 vaccinated cities, 10 least vaccinated.

So lag, lot spread general fact choosing vaccinate first also tending responsible people creates situation.

We seeing hospitalizations drop coming weeks. I'd surprised huge drop two weeks today. early wave states northeast worse Florida now. treatment regimens explain disparity, does? anything Florida worse risk factors (high elderly population, large non-white population, high population density) especially finding likely won’t get good vaccine... got first dose can’t get second   looking near Hazleton, PA. rural area.

Give people little bit credit. think ""it's months"" bit short-sighted ""that's history says.""

But hey, hope right! long high % age group get vaccinated. Take look number deaths flu season lowest deaths per capita state, whatever causes fewer flu deaths likely causing fewer covid deaths. Right Miami 70 degrees, Boston 13 degrees, they're completely different climates. think reason take gun violence serious reason take covid deaths serious. 

Is same. Americans would never accepted it. would called dictator.

Some absolutely. lost jobs direct result shutdown businesses want pay employees working. said true, told wrong even though New Zealand Australia point true. Lockdowns lack government assistance led loss jobs. first dose 2/3 effective also millions infections created base level natural immunity. CDC estimate true caseload history 8x positive tested cases accurate UK, 45% UK citizens already virus. 45% + ~13% vaccinated least 58%. certainly enough broach pseudo-herd immunity light ongoing restrictions. It’s enough true herd immunity, present R value, including restrictions immunity, 2.4, 58% would enough crush spread. without lockdowns death rate would identical lower? PMing you! 5-10%? Try 25+%.  outrage me. doesn’t mean people don’t covid infection aren’t symptomatic don’t get tested. still good people havnt vaccinated still risk. draconian measures allow us normal life keep economy going, have't see tennis Adelaide?

Fighting virus keeping zero low actually helps economy, much better misery see many places around world. No, missed parts created lab looking increase strength time vs something would typically peter out. uptake area really good. Numbers released Monday good. assume LTCH residents would get most. Older people, general, would higher probability get vaccinated younger (you hear many anti-vaxx elders). often complications would prevent vaccinated. people literally care. could millions kids dead still deny it. Sad.  literally see fucking link UK government website use two methodologies counting deaths, yes 28 days test fucking COVID-19 death certificate.

Also important virus interacting previously infected resistant individuals, thus selecting immune evading mutants.

Ideal would vaccinating low disease spread background. likely see various vaccine evading mutants coming months.  schools mandated flu vaccine bet would get number zero without mask/distance.  couldn’t think better island trapped :) Stfu dude! vaccine rollout good, got act together short weeks. happened coincide new administration. That's update 100million 100 days 150million 100 days. verge hitting 1mil average came missing big cultural point here.

Agreed, believe point agree written lower case actually article, criticism article(and many cnn articles days) upper case context written. agree disagree that, hope fix system get vulnerable folks vaccines asap. Perhaps time states consider moving quarantine isolated areas, keeping people hotels middle big cities becoming dangerous, especially new variants. Sarcasm?   mean last guy promised much winning we'd sick winning. someone understate things sort refreshing opinion.  Ah, lies BS posting. That's answer, stuff gets deleted misinformation false. saying would do. I'm saying people deserve starve death working, miss bs.

That must said makes sense pay anyone working. saying businesses literally got assistance. 

They get assistance spoken to. said true people lost jobs due shutdowns literally happened.

And correct, literally happened. Please stop lying. lost jobs remotely enough government assistance. agree that. assistance would've kept people employed. I'm arguing that. I'm arguing shutdowns effect.

No aren't. trying make sound like government assistance work can't work. goal amazing impersonation. 

You completely removed context additional government assistance first response cowardly attempt support objectively incorrect position. 

I explained additional financial assistance would cascading effect keeping businesses solvent employees paid. ignored that, too. 

Your response actual proof assistance mentioned resulted fewer closed businesses logical fallacy ""These two countries good government responses people still lost jobs!"". 

Many businesses lock doors tell employees stay home COVID. Then, ***because lack government assistance***, businesses longer enough money continue paying employees. lack regulations laws safety net set businesses employees people power time decided remotely enough. 

If assistance actually provided many businesses could able keep many employees books even unable directly paying them. Fewer layoffs, fewer firings, extensive LOAs, furloughs, sabbaticals, whatever want call it. They'd still employees.    would seriously lose shit there!    else suggest ? Herd immunity 0.71% british got full vaccin ? know that's motivation here. seem motivated caring people. 

I think want others agree support ideas matter what. favorite sites clearly fact-checking scientific misinformation covid vaccine maybe writing easily digestible fashion? father hesitant take vaccine he's watching America's Frontline Doctors youtube, etc. I'd love debunk stuff give reassurance. Anything definitively showing they're bunch crooks welcome too!  entirely stupid. AMLO promoting “covid isn’t bad” type news. picture this...AMLO says news covid cool. person Facebook instantly parrots fallacy straight Mexico. that, anyone listens speaks Spanish, info head keeps going. 

This makes plausible theory.  Maybe so, going change makeup country constitution change like talking about. War fighting thing unified country, even probably less unified people imagine. I’m sure it’s due one factor, seems likely vaccines least part it. reason thinking 92% senior citizens Pfizer trial. much trial data released lately I’m probably getting confused.

How far could travel 100 years ago? accessible it? Compare now? I'm sorry mob downvoted you, right limited studies areas little community spread lack mass testing idiotic. wouldn’t Level 1 trauma hospital area 1700 docs 7500 staff, connected Childrens another 2000 employees. basically small town. water towers even, enough generators run small city, many services.  fail see wrote California one highest death rates. arguing someone else. Also Florida higher population density almost 50%.   say cases going    Spanish Flu Med student here, think may vaccines mixed up. U.S., people given inactivated form virus, produce antibodies against. inactivated virus made dead viral particles chance reverted back live harmful virus.

In developing countries, oral polio vaccines might given due cheap cost ability create immunity community, since spread quite easily fecal-oral route. vaccine contains weaker version live virus small chance reverting wildtype form, potentially causing polio someone vaccinated.

With regards influenza vaccine, various forms well (attenuated vs. killed), main purpose protect certain strains flu. Scientists predict every year strains believe prevalent flu season, 100% correct time. flu shot meant make flu less severe, medications used purpose (i.e. Tamiflu). Thank god PA back track, 2 days data dumps days weeks previous, one day cases, little scary, back dropping downward. detected cases though symptoms, I'd argue likely thousands infections little symptoms infecting families communities. way confirm mass testing though. goal lockdowns turn curve. curve go virus can´t find vectors replicate. happened even Sweden.

The goal better stat deaths cases per inhabitant justifies costs lockdowns country western world achieved that. UK France went lockdown yo-yo categorically better Sweden. Dropped 150ish today Illinois. make wonder, philosophical sense, covid Nature's tripwire start slowing humanities spread.

I'm fear think else lies wait.  get much hopeful able offer vaccine every adult US. president little something like vaccine administration 50 states. 

While agree might outcome, be. Lots things handled states, federal government one handling this. Think covid like war, let state send army disorganized. Hi, I’m new sub, looking insight. Copied another sub:

I received first dosage moderna vaccine exactly two weeks ago. experienced usual side effects, chills first night, arm swelling injection site next day generally hurting like someone took baseball bat it. fine like 3 days. Three days ago, lymph nodes around neck hurting like hell, point hurts swallow, hear crackling ears (both ears hurt well). Also head hurting non stop too. Two nights ago feeling extremely nauseous top that. can’t seem figure continued side effects vaccine. reason I’m doubtful would delayed reaction since it’s 2 weeks already. anyone gotten either vaccines yet, experienced anything similar?

I gave call doctors office yesterday receptionist said don’t sound like covid symptoms may coming something. Unfortunately I’m waiting new insurance kick in, don’t want go pay pocket unless absolutely necessary. 

Currently head hurting, I’m feeling really cold, throat neck feel tight sore, almost like someone choking me. Don’t know make this. Daily new Covid cases United States dropped peak 260k/d 160k/d. tests reports lag infection start days couple dates, likely already 60%. United Kingdom seen even bigger drop. 

Very little change due vaccination program take bit longer meaningfully show data, get credit “ending” pandemic. saying vaccine isn’t great certainly eager get shots, much factor decline cases. 

In reality, pandemic end Dec 2020 burned groups spread pandemic most, also disproportionately likely get infected since two things related. would they? done local level.

Nobody ""dumped it"" anybody. sent pre-planning surveys, demanded every state formulate plan vetted, put tons guidance, protocols, considerations etc. (check CDC's website.) fault states fucked job (executing clearly laid playbook.)

As far making employees put effort vaccinations? That's states hospitals. worry unless parents develop symptoms, people exposed get infected. Infection rates non-household members normally 5%, household members probably 10%-30%. look Table 3 That’s said are...,,how say.... idiots Three weeks minimum. limited data suggests 6 weeks may actually better. problem wait *six weeks* second shot.  read too. yes it’s hopeful. many conflicting articles. last one read (front page Apple news) dismal.

And like similar type vaccines J&amp;J soon determine second shot greatly increase efficiency. study running merely determine much. 

Remember J&amp;J storage issues vaccines. Many thousands doses Moderna Pfizer thrown issues affected J&amp;J vaccine.

I’m lucky enough gotten myself, partner, sisters parents second vaccine two weeks ago live Open State. Friday night went favorite restaurant first time (we’d highly careful whole pandemic).

First minutes felt really weird, got drink me, conversation turned juicy family gossip... hour went forgotten worried COVID weird all. great night, went Ice Cream afterward.

Normal decades life doesn’t stop default year. minutes, things turn normal routine quickly! Yep me. Ehh, nothing new. would thing chance.   need Hold! It'll go back up! Ignore downvotes. mom (a doctor) believes vaccines (the mrna ones, least) sterilizing immunity. Also, article released today said spread covid already reduced due vaccines, OBVIOUSLY suggests vaccines prevent infection symptoms spread.

Wont open article without subscription Yeah, start getting climate factors population density, makes less clean comparison. saying California highest death rates country categorically false.   Finally actual r/UnexpectedMulaney !! Herd immunity achieved around 70% immunity hopefully we'll still see good results. sister Pfizer shot side effect sore arm shot 2  said talking FDA potentially apply EUA using British results. US enough anyway. coronaviruses circulate population continuously Good get vaccine EU get. Totally fair. No. That's works nyc. People go website take whatever location pops up. got mine black neighborhood. I'm jewish. absolute zero say got shot. article race baiting. straight racist saying bad vaccine, it' USA already enough supplies guaranteed Pfizer Moderna vaccinate everyone.

J&amp;J people get virus still don’t get sick except minority doesn’t seem life threatening. it’s enough make people immune it’s bad rest. 

Is 95% better? Yes. 66% enough stop virus society? Probably yes take transmission well 1.  Tldr dox yourself. EU joke   Honestly he's wrong. hard guarantee 3 day turn around. travel another country work pay $200(we'll work end) insure results time people UK even adhere lockdown. I’ve seen many images videos using highest death tolls still see many people around. Even people WITHOUT MASK SUPERMARKT WTF imagine virus qill you. probably 2 weeks + even severe. occurs ever heard phrase spoken. English wack, yo! overall fatality 1-2% sure. that's age ranges. fatality rate age range starting worry could last Xmas much much higher. going go visit guy 20s thinking, ""I see could last Xmas""

If we're talking someone 70s plus, fatality rate closer 8% 14% 80. even Covid kill them, could ruin health lead earlier death severely reduced quality life. 

Just could spend one Christmas together? Selfish. Vaccines nearly here. Many 70s - 80s many countries already within 1 month Xmas. worst case could waited one month belated Xmas massively safer scenario them. care homes reporting zero fatalities residents vaccine, one month Xmas.

There logical statistical excuse go visit elderly relative last Xmas. go: I'm also really monarchist also really republican: think current constitution/status quo works well. REALLY scream ""white power"" me? even know I'm white not? reddit avatar meme lol.

Goes show who's one that's really basing everything race here. dunno agree post cultural mask wearing can't possibly explain 350x reduction fatalities. island nation matter virus island.

One possible explanation Tokyo somehow super vigilant early successfully contained traced every case eliminated them. consider happening huge, densely populated city kind impossible me.

But agree another explanation difference fatalities reported. example found 95% people died covid serious health conditions like diabetes, heart disease etc. Japan reported covid deaths exclusively virus, i.e. people died ""from"" virus rather ""with"" virus? would reduce number fatalities 95%.

An even simpler explanation countries simply report numbers publicly countries look better. feel pretty sure China example. would honest it? Agree completely this. live less 2 hours 6 different states live 7th. eligible them, I'm sorry would willing drive one state it. national strategy absolutely would helped this, blame CDC this, primarily, also way country works general helpful situation. little cold late August that's it. Basically lots sneezing runny nose two days.

My daughter daycare precautions bringing home old things. We've really healthy. mean like drug uses spike protein enter cells?
Interesting thought idea. Ah yep you’re right there, fkin insane there’s always one state COVID whole time. Feels like donut streak often plenty think wrong Yeah, think choice two somewhat unfathomable situations.

I think reasonably ask young people simply avoid seeing parents. ever done, ever? Similarly, nursing homes completely protected? presumably staffed people 65. issue state getting doses based population, it’s really enough. nyc example Washington heights (a heavily minority neighborhood) there’s vaccine distribution center. lot people coming Jersey westchester getting shots local community, might free time keep refreshing pages etc get position line, left out. lines almost white people, don’t even pay tax city that’s funding centers probably ok working home anyway. yeah people going mad.

IMO target select areas there’s bad outbreaks first, like LA county, production continues increase. We'd love to... doses. Thousands first vaccination appointments postponed recent announcement delays AZ Moderna. Ok, [let’s add US discover deaths per million level Sweden US Denmark considerably that. Good news. article without paywall would great. got strep, thank goodness antibiotics since miserable. cold December. Got tested covid negative cold. also chronic disease. millions. test group data based around 600k vaccinated. 317 became infected week deemed ‘immune’ 16 hospitalised. data good. would say somewhat premature call triumph. Hope wrong. keep mind, even vaccinated still proof 12k variants. Reinfection rare would strain different spike protein.

Please stop fearmongering rest us, it’s difficult find optimism nowadays. follows Guardian’s Law - ‘whatever is, it’s due capitalism racism’ Nah, they’ll back. I’d gladly eat one pandemic over. still understand thing works hey.  Screw you, want drunk vaccine getting arm!

I want vaccine sober! fairness, really matter long shots going arms. important, national unified strategy absolutely implemented. 25 year old pre-existing condition, eligible half states. Totally understand people this. worth considering people feel compelled closely monitor report symptoms likely ones significant side effects (nobody going posting ""My arm's bit sore"" every hour long get bored quit) likely bit anxious health, cause symptoms cause notice things notice care watching them. Man need learn government areas. Greater Sydney population density 430 sq km. contains lot national parkland, rural areas, etc. City Sydney population density 1,170 sq km.

Man, need learn world...

1170/km2 that's density Amish town. think time best convincer people people feel like it’s safe long term, around long term eyes see doesn’t do. 

I also think two kinds people wanting it, idiots listening social media, genuinely concerned. There’s arguably much money involved fo folks comfortable. question that. mean kinda right, long ignore last 12 months. yes, i've bacterial infection since start pandemic (starting december last decemeber). that's probably mean though. :p lockdowns delayed seeing specialist antibiotics urgent care work, led reoccurring issue year.

my understanding one actually transmitted surface surface/by direct contact (like someone touches nose/ear, surface, touch surface, touch nose/ear, I'm infected), masks good that.

tomorrow see second specialist determine need something called mastoidectomy, finally get taken care of. Well, pro-choice, probably anti-choice. 16 many million vaccinated? rate hospitalization non vaccinated people? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Even measles vaccines, disease constant presence - would ebb flow struggled find new hosts.  cases sure unavoidable multi-generational household something even could quarantine house. yes, 20 30 somethings choice lock quit job avoid seeing parents think they'd choose latter.

The obvious example nursing homes residents literally can't leave meanwhile 40% fatalities occurred there. happened initially can't imagine nursing homes completely protected, yet fatalities continued there.  Tell South Australia Northern Territory next. Threaten dart guns loaded vaccine. Like said yesterday, normalcy return people believe safe. Even government opens everything people don’t believe they’re safe won’t go out. Like what’s happening Florida. Everything open, tourism numbers big still. Hope feel better soon! Wow. lack basic knowledge Indian health care system vaccinations India. wait years gain knowledge report back here. Peace Yep. Especially fact school starts tomorrow instead one extra week holiday. Still hope COVID raging like previously though.  set goal, don’t like it. seems like one butthurt sitting keyboard ready take fight never intended here. say India nothing, said nowhere close compared countries given healthcare structure positive mindset people vaccines. Whether positive mindset changed soon Covaxin given approval along Covishield something need think about. 

I never seen much opposition general public India much seen since approval said vaccine. notice think come reddit bubble come check ground reality. see governments pushing vaccinations rural healthcare workers matter. remember correctly dry runs approval. go statistics infrastructure ready vaccinate 1M people day. yet touch mark. leave believe whatever mainstream media feeding us days still stay hopeful overcome challenges dealing politics here. Peace fellow Indian :)  Light Treason? free walk around without getting shot

TIL everyone America walks around gun shooting people.

You dont freedoms, less. security though clearly value freedom. said things would reasonable. actual statements different. one point said humans would stop shaking hands forever. kept saying different number herd immunity (60%, 70%, 80%, etc) think way try convince people take vaccine. Every time positive development vaccine tells us bad news.

I get trying encourage people keep lockdown measures even vaccinations happening, ""that guy"" gives pessimistic skeptical possibility situation. Nah talking maybe vaccine. body exposed mounts immune responses thousands things day Like h1n1. Dumb ass disease evolved oblivion. idiot. surely young people interact older people? Like, typical adult's parents? children 20 30s see parents? quarantine too? Enjoy making stand freedom ICU? due coronavirus alone. &lt;- Source Coronavirus happen die? really told that.  One health minister advised, order immune system working optimally, advisable stop drinking vaccine.  said basically standard advice vaccine taken.  developers vaccine themselves, said fine continue drinking moderation.

As usual, reports sensationalized western media. think make good point here. Right it’s protecting actions. vaccine available it’s people mitigating risk themselves. don’t want vaccine, that’s you! Kennedy ""salesman commission"" set goal manned exploration moon?

Setting goals something good leaders do. Hear, hear. boring president office actually job, rags scurrying stories angles grab attention. anti maskers dumb though.

I know that. certainly troubled relationship current scientific knowledge.  least we've beaten Covid lmao.  16 317 infected hospitalised; that’s 5% hospitalisation rate among infected. Seems still somewhat high me. point vaccines prevent serious illness. vaccinated people catching infection time passes hospitalisation rate curbed difficult going forward IMO.

Awesome news living under! understanding. people's average ""perceived"" chance catching virus hovered around 24% perceived chance dying fallen around 19% 16%.

The actual risks literally like 1/1000 that. Denmark Sweden still outcome. EU member states proactive lockdowns US EU still came similar outcomes.  goals work internally company.

No, goals types work. Goals nothing companies, though companies often apply goals.

For example, Kennedy aimed moon space race. Humans moon stretch goal implemented government succeeded.

Big projects (especially wartime projects types) goals attached them. Environmental improvements goals attached them. hyper-common stuff political leader can’t make 15 million extra doses appear

That's targeting 8% industry predicts example. That's reasonable stretch goal - yes, society *can* make 15 million extra doses appear. like made 185 million pushes next goal.

He's conservatively predicting output. That's *goal*. PR.

I'd like see leader choose (informed) point make *goal* motivates us pandemic little bit sooner. I'd like see leader tap American spirit willpower achieve something leaves rest world awe. throw conservative stats trail projected trajectories distribution weeks months.  media needs call like is. think full shit mate can?  months ago got sick unexpectly (headache, nausea, fatigue) went doctor, got exact test. asked doctor stick way nose said rapid. 

HOWEVER, months prior, dad got REALLY sick (throwing up, get bed) doctors real covid test him, maybe save worse off? sure doesn’t complex. It’s literally system standard years.

Plenty schools properly ventilated, trying pretend like know CDC.

The CDC isn’t saying open every school, it’s saying open schools able opened.

And again, live socially distanced lifestyle wife one ICU physicians area, almost guarantee precautions get nowhere near mine.

If you’re forced work dangerous situations go get Envo mask. It’s $80, front $2.50 filter, it’s comfortable makes good co-workers same. technically treason given state national emergency.

Actually, not.

If were, BLM supporters could tried treason well. Yes, sadly. 'rona death certificate cause, probable cause. also see year's total deaths 5 year rolling average Office National Statistics (ONS) sceptic! I'd like get rid death penalty. think we're under-convicting treason it. Correction: think forgiving. 

But seriously, everything economy, keeping businesses open offering less support countries businesses close. Whilst virus rampant Spring government still avoiding saying ‘you work home’. best ‘if possible would nice would work home’. 

It wasn’t long ago FHM finally realised ‘yeah, can’t really social distance restaurants try can’ attitude wasn’t working. don’t get started buffets restaurants, something infection vector best times.  saying lockdowns impossible somehow can't possibly keep people separate. impossible them? entire population subset population.

We celebrated holidays in-laws family via zoom older folks happy home delivered groceries. Yeah kind sucks fine forever. Exactly. know someone dying cancer cannot ever see family again. citizens cannot enter citizen cannot leave.

And spaces limited enter tens thousands citizens stuck abroad unable get space come home.

And let's forget closed state borders, harshest lockdowns world places like Melbourne 

Oh economy? Tell people employed airlines, hotels, tourism related industries decimated. 

Its Australians completely brainwashed, somehow truth overlooked myth success. Actually can't.

If allow one group block doors streets (BLM) must, *by law*, allow another group so. government can't treat people differently based content speech. That's unconstitutional.

You made bed, unfortunately, get lie it. RDIF said could supply 100M Sputnik vaccine EU Q2. vaccine already use many parts world, probably lot data available soon. could see EMA granting approval around March data good. likely black unfortunately. LOL....most people get recovery fine, post pure fear mongering, enjoy rest life trapped inside degenerate shut China, Cuba, Venezuela known accurate data hahahahahahaha go daddy no? He's got lot feed you. Analyzing anecdotes real data useless. look Israeli data. affect llamas? Nah, we're good thanks. Life basically completely normal except little hiccups there. single person know would way.  claiming leftist states lies? 

This thread r/shitliberalssay material reasonable person would suggest protesters charged attempted murder.

Using logic, protest oil pipelines nuclear energy affecting life-sustaining technology arrested terrorism attempted murder. BLM protesters targeting police pull away preventing crime result massive increases homicide, BLM protesters tried actual murder. managed evolve enough infect literally every living thing planet. Plants, animals even bacteria. They’re worse roaches. Brazil delayed Bolsonaro's government sabotaging health system, public university research institutes like Butantã. But, ANVISAS's (our federal agency regulates medicine, food stuff) emergencial approval already vaccinated 2 million people month.  
If Bolsonaro Brazil could started way earlier maybe develop vaccine. Vaccine manufacturing powerhouse normally doesn’t make big noise regular.Pandemic shown capability whole world. Since Biden banned Twitter? That's thing. Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine rolling review since 1 December could file conditional market authorization next week week after, Pfizer ramps deliveries 15 February onward. problem production constraints sure Russia China entirely free given large number doses already exporting deploying domestic use. it’s fun talk echo chamber people :( agree. care who's getting vaccine 'jumping lines' long they're used. people getting it, better us. ""When people like riot ok, people like protest terrorism executed.""

Cool take, bro. tolerant. facility said rapid tests.a strange. Weird Someone know similar experience got shot. felt like shit day afterwards following day we're fine again. hopefully fine tomorrow. Might tske day work whenever get offered vaccine Bravo Australia New Zealand!

When make next pandemic movie cast south pacificers hero parts.

I know country wild card won’t listen anyone. Especially science. mean, half states still slight uptick per cent total deaths year, life's gone normal.

I'm sure 2, 3 years lockdown better option that. literally gave oxford vaccine

You gave anything. manufacterer behest UK EU investments.

Hell EU gave 300M R&amp;D Oxford. need centralized electronic register Interesting, thanks sharing, didn’t know Vitamin could help prevent infection. read articles contradicting information. guess doesn’t hurt make sure sufficient Vitamin levels. fucking fun talk babe. enjoying conversation clearly meant caliber IQ Lol lockdown, Australia went 739 cases per day 5th August 84 cases per day 31st August. August winter month Australia. Unless next candidates EU's list fail

So, memory have:

Pfizer: Approved

Moderna: Approved

AZ:Approved

Sanofi: Likely failed*, production switching pfizer.

J+J: Looking good far, rumoured UK authorisation mid-late Feb, EMA likely March.

Curevac: Can't recall new news vaccine, gone quiet?

Novavax: Recently concluded stage 3 trials, results look good production may start soon, however another one EU late sign for. UK approval expected March, EU possibly April.

Valneva: Yet another EU late sign for, mass production started UK already, stage 3 trials yet start, UK authorisation may Summer, that's certainly current urgent timeframe.


It's worth noting several EU signed late big questions contracts deliveries priorities, clearly bit weakness...

It looks like EU focus ramping production AZ, Pfizer prepare J+J, would amazed if; 1: Germany want start trials Russian/Chinese drugs, 2: EU comission let go way, Hungary one thing, one pillar nations EU? sure. 3: EU industries throw weight protest backdoor funds going Russia/China. $: EU populations reject drugs risk increasing anti-vax movements.


*Within timeframe Damn. hoping cure general air nihilistic cynicism. honestly know. policy makers never really seemed touch facts even Fauci seems playing kind game dangling carrot front everyone never gets closer.

And part worries people like Fauci loving limelight much say anything brings situation end they'll stop famous. become attention-whore culture.

I feel pretty sure hospitalizations fatalities going drop precipitously next weeks. Hopefully need see zero cases zero illnesses something change minds. Somehow mental health economic impacts lockdowns seem forgotten policy makers.  'Old risk diseases viruses, 11' Yes, certainly *are* done. FDA wouldn’t allow use product company couldn’t accurately prove clinical trials fact working. 

The likely issue it’s variant aren’t aware yet. We’re focused right administering vaccine aren’t taking time keep testing people mass numbers even see there. It’s likely number variants haven’t even reported simply aren’t looking extent need be. sure, stay hole Congratulations. Australia one step closer ""back normal"".

Thanks India, hope country follow suit. I’m giving credit credit due still agree you. mum got shot early January extremely sore arm day really bad similar side effects I've vaccines. worst I've heard personally someone know felt like shit day afterwards we're fine that. mean I'd rather feel shit day catch covid wailing..perfect ecochamber candidate.. Cool story bro. 

I’m done here. agree, get hopes up. Goalposts move again. 3x size texas likely pandemic end year (In first world countries least?) probably going ok. Stay touch doctor. recover immune least months good. Good luck! got rapid test, long term one. Basically get results quicker might accurate. You’re supposed give special medical treatment wealthy donors. inherently implies treatment held back others. It’s unethical. Even he's setting ""goals"" utterly pathetic fall short projected dosage levels. - that's ""goal"". summer without annoying day day restrictions question.

I'm pro-open up, see it. Goalposts moved many times, age groups understand relative risk.

Lockdown governors *slightly* ease restrictions summer.

They'll come back late fall. Another bleak winter despite 'near miracle' haul vaccines.

Rinse repeat.

This way live. lockdowns, death rate would probably same.

That straight lie know it. sure test changed policy changed, yeah... think started taking swabs nose going much back spring. CDC experts.

Teachers spending time outside classrooms them, tell getting sick.

Better yet tell haven’t exposure outside classrooms.

Myself wife zero contact outside work, two school runs far less five minutes, handful instore grocery pick ups.

No shared spaces, get togethers, region travel. heard stuff like I've lunch buffets pandemic fast last week. People need stop freaking out. Imagine pretending island nation nothing stopping Covid. U.S. half million people *arrested* trying illegally cross borders year. Imagine many get through. imagine thinking could stop Covid level leadership given one difference.

Also imagine applauding human rights violations ""decent clearly deepthroating now. get gurl. way in. daddy bless soon  ""monitoring"". initial line decided going give power actually stop shipments. 

Where think trouble Northern Ireland arose from? literally going breach Good Friday Agreement allowing export vaccines Republic NI blocked. Damn, youre misguided, man. Perhaps shoulf actually read article check data Israel. Reading headlines form opinion birds. Proof New Zealand isn’t special unique. length extent shutdown unprecedented history, even though, yes, brief, local examples similar things.

Are old enough remember 2009? It’s absurd claim it’s even remotely similar.  imagine specific populations - health care workers long term care residents, rate slowing. also strongly suspect apparent drop cases actually illusion caused shifting focus testing vaccinating, least U.S. flat ignorant wrong. think see 65 population (and maybe ""pre exisisting condition"" population) sort cordoned off, really way safely separate them.

Some 65 year olds still work. people diabetes. 56 year olds married 66 year olds. families live multi generational homes 3 4 members work. grandparents raise grandchildren go school.

Testing every staff member nursing home great idea feasible, that's drop bucket.

Edit. idea celebrating holidays events older relatives seems face impossible. Dude. one getting complex ventilation systems installed schools right now. We're barely able survive moment. Every teachers union america school system wants better ventilation systems, possible right now. sit try pretend schools well ventilated safe. They're aren't. Forgive dick all, live every day lost multiple co-workers.  really trying make rich vs poor thing?

I make 40,000/year Someone harrassed becausr mask, got beating it. much easier stop Covid systematically snuff peoples' human far vaccines prevented hispitlisations IIRC even J&amp;J loeer efficiency. yes highly unlikely get severe covid although course theres always small chance small chance. terms variants none make vaccines totally useless simply result slightly reduced efficiency. still protected new variants problem lol? way, don’t know many people exposed virus. could 600k could 320. However 17 320 known confirmed numbers. 5% could good news good news point. point. obviously want vaccines work much possible. 😂😂😂😂😂 post piece reason ppl tryed post non mainstream information numerous realities virus early warnings airborn transmission ppl constantly months behind accepting what's really going cry goalposts moving. blindly trusting major news outlets actually inform controlled ppl nothing agendas. Welcome club. Greetings Austria. Isn’t per capita deaths pretty similar US UK? first dose figure impressive, number people fully vaccinated two doses remains low, less several EU countries. wonder UK taking delay strategy tad far risking much. wonder would be? 

Could significant amount population ineligible fly, hurts profits? obviously conflicting interests, opinions mean shit. anybody listening them? exponential! currently linear averaging extra 15k per day. also saw huge drop last weekend due weather supply wobbles balancing out. Keep mind Matt Hancock mind-bogglingly stupid government position Boris Johnson's main criteria government jobs ""stupid enough support hard Brexit"" - skills qualifications necessary. far that. Fx. isolating capital region rest country critical point. shut time, didn’t open early sensible measures since then. UK delivering second doses appears. know part strategy, curious works out. solid data Israel (which using advised approach) soon. criticism OP I’m tired every single link requiring registration. guess I’m year following virus. I'm professional chef passionate cooking eating, HUGE part makes anxious COVID! Whatever ""long term side effects"" vaccine infinitely less whatever ""long term side effects"" get COVID. 

The vaccine less effective single shot traditional vaccine formulation. mRNA vaccines modern miracles like sniper rifles train immune system best protein build antibodies against. Think two months (two doses) Navy Seal training. JnJ vaccine two week general army bootcamp teaches immune system shoot gun general enemy. 

Stop spreading misinformation FUD. give fuck cruise ships do. industry die care.

I'm mainly concerned event industry trying require mass gatherings. concerts ""come back"" mask *and* vaccine requirements, might well come back all.  think we’ll still hit target general population immunization September, reason US/UK fully vaccinated surplus start going rest world. Yeah, needs job social life? Australia basically penal colony again. main issue people basically acting like vaccine isn’t much simultaneously really urging people get it. you’re gonna encourage people get it, make sure know form distancing masking completely useless they’ve gotten second dose that. Restrictions need start seriously easing vulnerable vaccinated COVID doesn’t pose significant threat anyone else. parents dont let use google? Wtf Would mind linking me? haven’t seen would love to! Distance learning remotely comparable real thing. impact schools closing far greater H1N1. genuinely can’t believe someone could argue contrary good faith. Afaik J&amp;J r&amp;d make 1 shot vaccine, 2 shot like Moderna using ICU plane Germany. see picture here: http://onobello.com/germany-activates-flying-icu-plane-to-fly-covid19-patients-from-italy/ haven’t seen reports hundreds thousands severe reactions. getting from? We’ve given 10s millions vaccines. need average shy 400k day get target now. looks like we're going smash seen overly ambitious target! Morning everyone. Last day January! think- weather gets warmer here, numbers gonna go down, people gonna vaccinated, new vaccines get approved- We’ve got this, okay? We’re gonna make we’re gonna best summer lives. Lmao mate live Perth. It’s first outbreak since shit hit fan. We’ve enjoyed quite normal reality till single case got lock downs going last 5 days. weeks months. bell end. neighborhood right outside NYC, kids playing together masks since began. Yes, would judgment. Plus ignoring Fe means good bedside manner positive customer/patient experience ignored like...actively suppressed. Even vaccines well known prevent disease serious disease prevent infection, like pertussis, rotavirus, influenza, etc., still *reduce* transmission. prevent altogether, reduce - pertussis outbreaks, example, generally traced, instead carried long chain vaccinated people showing surprise locations around country. discovered immortality Australia? hope position help guys soon, death hospitalization average UK still high though, almost 10x Canadas. Anti vaxers incompetent leadership responsible majority deaths. blood hands. Yes 20s 2009. Also said another comment: schools didn’t offer online option like schools 2020 did. US school closed COVID-19, they’ve remained open via distance learning someone explain going UAE? They're almost 30% vaccinated, cases rise quite severely (at least according googling ""covid stats UAE"").

I want come naysayer, definitely want vaccine ASAP, looking worried might issue... Americans, would like youse gave 3 million vaccinations single day. Yes, think post-mortem pandemic, response educational right seen woeful. many kids essentially lost year year half schooling. Hancock? Kate Bingham chaired vaccine taskforce. really suck vaccination front :(  slow bit. Restrictions pulled back population vaccinated, we'll really hit goal everyone wants vaccine offered one. point would ideal lift restrictions.

I understand frustration, wanting earlier, would make sense page then. guarantee people want students socially distance fall. public schools means hybrid best. arey lodu bhai humko toh jaat ka mtlb caste pata hai tu bata de oversmart think businesses implement them.

Cruise Ships seem like best example. Especially going places behind vaccination. 

Don't want wait Caribbean vaccinated start cruising again. I’m referring extratrial data   Sadly surprise me. live Houston, and, thankfully, small places go to, everyone masked up, far. also didn’t remote learning. school US “closed” 2020. They’ve remained open via distance learning. Potato, potaato  understand effectiveness calculated. sure agree good way people understand exactly calculated. control vaccinated groups stay home, says absolutely nothing effective vaccine is.

No, mutations aren’t ‘fake news’ really headline shared public vaccines still prevent severe illness known mutations thus far. jar 1000 jellybeans one green jellybean, disingenuous center story jellybeans around colour green.

I believe war pandemics won, treatments like antivirus others taken one infected. powerfull vaccines itself, vaccines take long take, loose power future virus mutations.

so ""big one"" 8-4 (LOL - WTF) - 

shorter hours EVERY BUSINESS 

there's 12 stations.

they're even ***scheduling*** past 24-48 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

WM alone prob 3 weeks appointments it. holding back many doses delaying second shot. 3 weeks Pfizer, 4-6 weeks Moderna 9-12 weeks AstraZeneca. 

Currently 66% delivered doses vaccinated Mecklenburg-Vorpommern 94%. don’t think analogy well-made.

Lack diversity problem. Genetic, social, cultural, economic.

Where single system imposed above, wider ecology suffers. someone living U.S. jealous guys’ coronavirus response. seems reasonable now, significant pressure make requirements lax soon cases drop vaccinations. likely they'll stop delaying there's less urgency cases deaths declining therefore they're less panicked. Also there's doses coming. kinda weirding 0\_0 There's always going percentage, expect old people full sensible, terms motivation imagine series beatings UK taken last couple years, something like this, frankly amazing verging spectacular, think level enthusiasm part going push vaccination acceptance, takeup lot.

I'm pretty relaxed things nature, country did.. hmm. 10K yesterday.. could long year.. might slow motion popcorn moment next 3 months, unless pull fingers out, know that's possible without supplies. edited post..Obviously countries large population it’s possible 30 times more..I clear..Rest ten countries already many cases especially Europe may missing 10 times..

In end majority countries 25% infected like India.. one going lock US unless get murder-variant coronavirus starts slaughtering children.

I'd guess music festival attendees generally last group get vaccinated, likely vaccinated audience festivals, it'll close. Maybe argue everyone else vaccinated, would still fine. idk Always trying.. however would great. fair, rules vary widely State (thank goodness) Hancock supposedly signature away okaying outsourcing vaccine production Merk US. article believed changed course towards AZ. wonder could (legally) safely go holiday UK US considering they’ll two vaxxed countries? September? wonder travel corridor would open back up. r/iamverysmart  person responded described literally impossible. confuses people *still* pretend ever option.  Doubt. It’s waste time arguing people. going argue even 1 kid dying covid many amount risk acceptable. blame mods letting people insane positions platform. could delays regardless strategy use? like 12 weeks OK 13 weeks end world. current rate, likely they'll start second doses earlier planned anyway.  funny. can’t tell you’re trying snarky not. charged vaccine?
No. charged out-of-pocket costs, receive bill provider vaccination site. applies people private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, uninsured. say that? lot covid deniers Canada. Grandfather Nurgle smiles little plaguelings. may fan CFA reasons, I'll admit, genuinely good move made smile. Cant imagine why?  Especially melinda gates calling black people get first.  want give blacks first.


Second. hate these. black neighborhood,  poor neighborhoods. Sure.

But HCQ still doesn’t work CoVID. Please check list probably find 50 countries true. sir don’t clue. think worst part burning nose afterwards. Didn’t last long still sucked Canadian here, would option. fear removal restrictions tied specific percentage population vaccinated. blame restrictions continuing placed vaccinating, rather fact politicians arbitrarily decided continue restrictions they're even necessary. read more.They ready give “vaccines” pay money ask (time line May delayed).

We talking manufacturing cheaply here.. Or, perhaps accurately, vaccine trials didn’t test asymptomatic infection test &amp; placebo groups. Good point! going limb I’m gonna say people traveling get vaccine believe science aren’t interstate travel go fucking Dave N Busters. Chill, it’s gonna okay.  ...Washington State called assigned 11 employees expertise labor deployment, operations, research development work full time vaccine distribution home state, company said, adding number employees could change.

&amp;#x200B;

what's wrong vax centers common Starbucks chicken sandwiches? would think people say children future would want actually protect children virus idea long term. kind future child going develop COPD people forced exposed Covid over? would guess GP's change bookings challenging vaccinations, ie. specialised care homes etc. already pre-booked organised might kept original time table simplicities sake.

Also vaccination centres end day surpluses may done 2nd jabs workers call-ins rather risk binning vials. huge chunk people already ""over it"" even care slight bit 1-4k people dying every day  must 20 younger say naively, ignorantly Fucking embarassing lol reason shutdown unprecedented virus also unprecedented modern history difficult contain. viruses quarantine everyone symptomatic fine, work this. containment keeps failing, shutdowns get put response. ""The difference stupidity genius genius limits.""

Einstein think may miscommunication here. I’m unsure actually disagreeing anything said? agree variants end world, given actual research impact variants practical outcomes thanks J&amp;J Novavax trials, don’t really need speculate based vitro research. risky much vaccine itself, unexpected delays always happen. Remember EU threatening block exports suddenly British redditors seemed incredibly concerned that? answer probably unexpected you. I'm Nottingham, even North. Chick Fila &amp; need charge lines Covid vaccine sites.  Makes wonder know something don’t.... Sounds great. could first country free healthcare. require high temperature . India can't provide that. read article? mine 2 days Christmas, planned 2nd dose 13th Jan, got notified cancelled date given. faster gets moving faster go buy sandwich. Finally see ask people experience help pols. Wow, England seems ahead far! plans accelerate numbers regions? UK refusing give away vaccines EU EU preventing supplies intended British people reaching UK.

The perspective EU matter facilities UK always meant produce EU well. one suggesting UK get less ordered facilities, though. *only* implication involving UK far regard AZ vaccines EU facilities. BionTech touched long fulfill obligations EU. *not* that, wonder anyone could argue UK (or anyone else) treated preferentially. countries world? Watch get downvoted crazed hopium addicts. I’m concerned B117. It’s race time get people vaccinated. Dutch factory.  why???!? please? sun demands sacrifices  risk there's always chance delays. couple days ago find lots panicked Brits saying ""omg EU block exports nan receive second dose we're screwed"". see people saying next year “why people going out???? Don’t know we’re still pandemic????” Covax actually something, last saw still struggling actually get doses poor countries get crazier? mentioned “or free” meant uninsured would free.

Edit: note Wa. simply true. look official numbers UK (3.7 million), USA (26 million), France (3 million), Sweden (570k) etc. 30 times numbers would total population. Licence cost low.AZ said going make profit initially.

Why Pfizer &amp; Moderna manufactured anywhere outside centres?  I’ve heard live country.  elect people say government work people go way make sure government work. 

Republicans sabotaging country. pay BBB enough money remove advice? don’t think go back normal 2022 new strains. Honestly I’m convinced life way virus mutates. media “experts” believed, may asked distance Christmas US huge pharmaceutical industry ability make vaccines scale along huge amount global influence money. ramp big time wouldn’t surprised see 3m day soon. Last year 3m flu doses day wait realize already 25k troops fighting CoVID19 deployment orders tens thousands others fighting military hospitals across country. Here's country country breakdown figures: never went medical school. understand.

Mark words bidens federal response going train wreck. First , fbi background check take months. issued ids. affirmative action training. federal vaccine priority list different state list. vaccine go federal locals get any.

Then take two weeks set federal clinic.


Get rid regulations, Give notification vaccine 48 hours safe efficient distribution Operation cost nothing, run 24/7, give vaccine everyone waste drop.

Wtf feels like elected countries cornering market coronavirus vaccines, leaving poorer regions potential breeding grounds variants, like one found South Africa, could make vaccines less effective. Idk one chief good [archive link anyone trouble accessing article you’re much smarter everyone else. 

Got it, nice one. What's wrong personal freedom? I've lived mostly normally since June last year. Since 3 days lockdown. person freedom going great none colleagues/friends/family dead either I'd say that's bonus. put mask people, scan QR code go places use sanitizer. life normal. even got watch sport live weekend stadium. People distancing pretty well whole time, well least seen. ~2.5 months (in isolation!) ~2 weeks borderline inhumane though. Even mining dollars table people generally won’t 1 month on/1 month off. state screenings never delayed significant amount time. pandemic this, government hospitals did. Still, WA response proves point. 1 case, 5 day lockdown.

US: 5000 Cases ""everything's fine"" dumb fucks still landing planes throughout lame little lockdown.

They practically last one restrict borders.

Island sweet fuck it. Hawaii alone worse New Zealand.

That's far fucking anyone island possibly get. literally centre damn-near entire half planet that's entirely water. 

You cross island list. time maybe think housing multiple quarantined travellers downtown core capital cities. continue happen again, tempt mother nature's wrath know Sydney Melbourne air traffic route second busiest entire world?? 

That’s route year essentially zero, otherwise often required 2 weeks quarantine. Yes, quarantine hotel workers infected least 3 times now, wearing PPE. also mystery 5 guests one quarantine hotel infected another guest seemingly contact with. Hm, swap 50 million Pfizer/Moderna 50 million JJ. It’s good deal! That’s 25 million people us, 50 million million people you. 

Low efficacy, know... know, gotta talk people ok getting “mild” covid. don’t mention “mild” covid cases become long haulers. People get little suspicious bring up. 

We deal? 😀 made 13 days last streak mate. SA outbreak first weeks December NSW towards end December. could completely wrong, since virus flu cold, even know yet much threat mutations pose. could major pain ass long time. Agreed.. Police anything due politics think pandemic 1890 coronavirus still us mostly causes common cold occassionly something dangerous elder immocomromised. Kill lot people first, know long took turn mild.

I'm glad live era vaccines spare many disease hopefully long term effects, many spared old hard way watching disease decimate families &amp; community maybe come back worse Spanish flu. First killed old,bthe fragile. Next year took young healty  yet suggest perhaps implement strategies worked Australia elsewhere, people think you’re insane extremist.

We’re special, could absolutely work here. nation spoiled children, goes doubly police would enforce restrictions. literally thousands invisible border crossings Europe though, logistics policing every country lane farm track crosses border Ireland would tie entire police force. u/sharkinwolvesclothin says economically socially border areas hugely interconnected, towns cities across continent border literally middle town

Looking Google maps, along entire 2000km border WA rest Oz there's maybe 5 6 crossings remote unpopulated desert. comparable situation Australia NZ spread, everything virtually open even without I’ve thinking well. live Massachusetts everyone following rules. example people outside alone walk wearing masks. Yet high numbers cases. seems really way control least try best. that’s problem Florida, wearing mask simply selfish individual. say, Australians polled overwhelmingly trust government. last part post sums up.

Australians love whinge, think politicians paid much. However comes taking action, Australians incredibly apathetic. many Australians would willing even publicly protest, lest take arms government protest measures implemented. However said, Americans (and honestly many people many western countries) would take strong action.

I know lot Aussies thought measures stupid, social distancing signs everywhere dumb, check places pointless, pissed travel interstate times, thought officials overreacting sending hotspots lockdowns. literally was, fleeting thoughts. seconds whinging followed acceptance getting things. 

That say U.S states western countries people similar views Aussies. cases, locations surrounded states, countries locations not, making situation difficult.  True. Sydney dense city 430 p/sm, 50% entire UK. Meanwhile London 5,700. Howard Springs half hour drive Darwin quarantine workers (backpackers) live Darwin. outdoor set-up (and fact don’t clean rooms days they’re vacated) means transmission guests workers would difficult. find people say late find evidence never seem know kind investigations actually work. I've never seen argument backed kind real insight. always prima facia assumption. Thanks, really asking. health, ever one administrators give you, probably take. Unless doctor advises otherwise Right. Good point. forgot allowed test them, restrict movement minimise exposure points. 

It's like Australia, country extremely reliant freight, able manage seemingly intractable problems. They’re allowed Victoria  bet lot didn’t bother taking precautions spread around like wildfire first place. Probably taken dose someone followed rules people already got vaccinated need again? understand stuff works still connected mainland US...

Going look map...BRB.  Almost like normal Australia. thing missing big events like concerts overseas travel. you’re seeing right people telling people get low efficacy shot ok getting covid we’ve told last year get covid. 

If it’s ok get “mild covid”, ok 65 healthy get mild covid last year already low risk hospitalization.

I haven’t seen evidence low efficacy vaccines protect people mild infections becoming long haulers.

It’s better get covid all... always case. Jfc... hvac systems aren’t going crap kids still feet apart piled room dozens. doesn’t matter good HVAC systems are.

Are dense? Keeping door open would one efficient ways ventilate classroom.

Lol school “HEPA filters” sure hell isnt going one many aged public schools around US.

All say frame reference pervue attending expensive private school. Go fuck send kid want public schools aren’t equipped handle covid. That's good point. test I'm referring to. related travel all. None states made ok intentionally run people over. like immunity try drive around still hit someone.

But regardless California definitely one states. Phoenix refers band phoenix, location. I’ve already gotten first dose vaccine may exposed, get COVID test? accurate?  Well would people work make problems vanish. Rooms magically cleans selves due maids. Lawsuits go away team lawyers counter sue drag case cost super would ever get back give up. pushes button duet soda appears. 

Paris hilton said child shfe though everyone lived like family, survrnts survents homes. Paris intelligent enough realize true now... Kinda forgetting 90 percent Australians live percent land don’t “excuse” don’t need one never claimed US good job. You’d know weren’t trying spam irrelevant island place. 

A things worked Japan’s favor: 

1. Already prone wearing masks 
2. culture ready listen authorities older family members
3. island 
4. Didn’t dumb ass leading 

Now, please let us know places like UK who’ve lockdowns contact tracing everything much higher death rate per million US that’s takes. nice go 3 day lockdown people go fucking insane screaming it’s going end economy. Australia urbanised population world. 

90% Australians live within 100 kms coast. 

71% Australians live major cities (major city = population 100 000).

Australia huge land mass - huddle close coast cities. post age well complex system given rise new type pandemic travel – dubbed “vaccine tourism” – people cross state even country lines get earlier access. resources vehicles delivering doses vaccine tied local community, state, city terms allocation,” said Dr Kyle Ferguson, postdoctoral fellow division medical ethics New York University Grossman School Medicine. Cities states generally receive batches vaccine federal government based adult population area plan distribution strategy accordingly. that, lot things. underestimate effect privatization healthcare swathes dead Americans. They're freight drivers, they're going back forth lot. They're going get tested regularly.

Surreal...had check twice Onion precisely happened India. govt explicitly say anything slowly restaurants, bars, movie theatres opened everything became normal. point we'll full capacity theatres tomorrow. guess Eastern Europe arhaic state run centralised medical system. kind system allows us implement fast vaccine rollout.

Absolutely ridiculous it’s handled here. test them. easy. work software development freight logistics company every single one drivers tested every single time cross state border, let alone international one. Yep. late though. I'm Labor supporter unforgivable make exact mistake sent Victoria South Australia lockdown. lived WA would want resignations. vaccine work, people immunity means less opportunities virus replicate mutate, contagious deadly varieties mutate less contagious deadly well. Pests came go past without vaccines  Forcing mask mandate 0 community transmission would extreme.

The current mask mandate lockdown extreme opinion, strong reactions purpose shutting spread.

I know definition ‘extreme’ vary person person, stand spectrum. Evil idiots think original idea Miami well. like April like May.   Japan vs USA, ya dum dum.

What's excuse there?

~1/3 population, denser, they're still far, far, far behind measurable stat.

What's going be? 

""YOU CAN'T COMPARE USA JAPAN JAPAN HIGHER IQ!!!11"" looking wholly Australian perspective. think big deal, politically wasn't.

Now try Europe U.S. Many borders neighbouring states. Vastly different approaches tackling virus spread, implementing controls, general compliance mandates issued.

Name Australian state strict lockdown protocols place. imagine didn't. Pretend moment Victoria full ""freedom loving"" know alls would never let government impose strict restrictions them. imagine borders much widely travelled, population clusters everywhere. part situation similar wealthy regions like U.S and/or Europe. However even worse that.

One last thing - Australias covid response COULD implemented places would worked well. giving reasons measures would work. giving explanation would implemented. think politician could ever get 50 states agree strict lockdowns, even did, would never convince people follow level compliance government order Australia has. Definitely conservative troll. dare say alot soon many conservatives state government!  theory around schools teachers simply don’t want wear mask day. daughter private school that’s remained open entire time hasn’t single case teacher getting covid breakout class. vaccination campaigns seem exception rather norm.

Of course, maybe misunderstood meant above? again, New Zealand tiny ass country 5 million can't compare densely-populated places like Japan metropolis like Tokyo 6 times population New Zealand. **More people use Tokyo Metro System daily basis live New Zealand**. 

Do understand this? Let's next compare Lichtenstein India shall we. 

I know New Zealand news much guys trying keep relevant posting shit pathetic. question regulation, though. mRNA actually software development biological machine. Unfortunately, biological machine vastly complex nuanced man-made CPU, much fundamental understanding still subject empirical experience heuristical generalizations. 

Focusing one lipid carrier one kind injection apparently already good step, apparently much depends *where* mRNA gets translated. 

But currently see get point new mRNA code approved within weeks, would necessary unlock *real* potential technique. Regulation, tests, production need adjusted goal, think.  Whoa jeez slow down, countries still vaccine freezer  $5x10^3 5x10^3 No, isolated means away towns, Nortern Territory already this, also Queensland plans using mining camps, facilities already everything needed rotate staff regular basis. Apparently disused camps repurposed. mining camps even airports need translate sick person hospital. basically big one. Americans trust federal government anywhere near much Australians do. Also 'liberty' held much higher regard US, point seems completely nonsensical outsiders (Eg US gun laws). 

I'd say broad support current covid restrictions Australia, include measures unable leave country unless granted permit, hotel quarantines meaning great difficulty returning country, state border closures banning travel states, lockdowns - sometimes *very* stringent rules (for days South Australia allowed even take dog walk!).

If one measures mandated US government decent chance armed insurrection breaking out! us we'll take whatever get. wil time, ever, walk doctor's office choose menu multiple choices. Masks lockdown main factor Victoria couple months ago. 700 cases day 0 cases whole month. Cook Forty Humans Eh? think fine ever received due overdue library book. Er, might want check that. approved EMA Friday use adults.  calling South African Virus Brazillian Virus? No, EU actually buy enough vaccines.

Other regions world get major vaccine boost, though. already lift restrictions last week. Even though deaths still 3k week nationally. 

I think numbers way lower open democrat run state. Many NY National Guard NY Guard partly supply. Canada contracts companies companies failed make good contracts diverted shipments US instead able fulfill contracts entirely due issues. nothing points whats point time span great 2nd booster likely 3rd booster. ItsCYA time long term shit gone far lmfao. Literally every time someone gets long lasting symptoms actually affect QOL gets put news Nope, EU criminally late usual. read article linked? never experienced blizzard you?

I have.

the governor closed everything.

EVERYTHING.

no schools, businesses,

outside 10 minutes get frostbite.

hospitals can't deal that.

police/fire can't get around think return normalcy occur starting Mid-March social aspect pandemic end memorial day weekend. think one-year mark bullshit make lot people go ""fuck it"", late-May, think hospitalizations low enough people following guidelines. Hancock said summer today. Daniel Griffin twiv podcast claiming good syringes extract upto 13 doses every 10 dose vial 10 dose moderna vial. government everything power increase availability syringes. US could easily vaccinate 200 million people early May. requires competence sectors. Yeah guy like ""we 1.6 inauguration day"" neglected mention unreported vaccines MLK day 19th actually vaccinated 1.6 million 20th. 

The ""Biden effect"", any, felt later stage. Isn’t almost 1% country? 
Credit it’s due. lol eu pissed right people sub stopped making sense vaccines arrived, want acknowledge logistics geopolitical facts effort global vaccination.

Most people sub trapped mindset first world vaccine nacionalism, like think would 100% free virus letting borders go open rest world population vaccinated, poor countries not. I'm pretty confident things scheduled September 2021 later US. tickets outdoor concert July seems quite bubble right now. vaccinated least weeks earlier city allows tens thousands people congregate it, probably go donning KF94 mask. 

It seems like USA sufficient supply vaccinate everybody wants mid summer. remaining thing still really proven much ramp administering shots. think it. virus variants wrinkle, get vaccinated can't see treating differently flu regardless that. 💉 💪

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Almost 1% total population definitely 1% adult population concern meanwhile rest Europe getting much vaccinations..  have. problem companies diverting shipments US particular (both Moderna Pfizer) vaccines ordered still waiting final approval.

The US UK lot weight throw around get contracts actually enforced. Also important mention case death rates far worse Canada's, arguably get vaccines first anyway situation much worse there. It’s “No one rich everyone rich.” selfish Brits licensed vaccine free?

Is selfish Brits insisted vaccine sold cost price? Ass mouth best accuracy?  heard seek genre film media. 

(I’m trying make light depresssing pandemic). Talking western vaccines course. go ahead, vaccine Chinese vaccine. 

It’s fact US Executive Order place bans export vaccine vaccine related products, get facts straight.
As UK defacto ban place reserved doses entire order filled.

Have seen fast ""variants"" traveling? worse original. forbid anyone read article.

You joking, right? AZ increase capacity 9M doses per quarter, a) weeks ago b) scale even that?

We two months left quarter. increase would mean 1M doses per week, start new capacity *now*. could *that*, could setup another 1M per week mid-February forth. Finished April???  Heh. Canada won’t 2 million doses vaccines total then. 

I mean unless talking Jesus coming save day. Freedom security too! gonna infect nor'easter? cats? feel like people played X-Com know well! Sharpshooter 95% shot, miss, squad destroyed next turn. I'm saying Biden office virtually impact pace increase rolling average. kept increasing fast before. Hopefully administration something sleeve increase pace even further. need distribute least 2.5mn doses per day far hitting numbers.   Canada, wtf. We're embarrassment. hypothetical scenario: AZ-UK contract stipulates delivery 20M doses Q1, factories make 30M. Then, according pov EU, AZ deliver 10M doses EU. happen (after UK orders parallel), difficult assess, people sides literally dying.

In scenario, think people (including Brits) would agree 10k surplus doses diverted EU. there’s much point contemplating moment *isn’t* surplus probably won’t quite time. British general public would never forgive government donated much-needed vaccines rich developed institution like EU still strict lockdown averaging 1000 deaths day. assume UK receive 20M doses BionTech, got 18M applied first dose. Germany got 10M doses applied 5 first dose, keeping rest storage.Now production drops massively weeks. BionTech produce 15M doses. go UK second dose factor? think so, completely ridiculous argument, either. 

No, scenario, course wouldn’t say UK get doses. again, wholly unrealistic scenario British government wouldn’t carry giving first doses Pfizer vaccine without steady incoming supply second doses. takes weeks brew vaccines, pharmaceutical companies would know quite way advance whether meet demand time, warn recipients not. Pretty much Australia close back normal since early 2020. saying.  Whether stupid thinking that, still terrible messaging want people take vaccine. government screaming rooftops vaccine ticket getting live life again. Shutting things done nothing stop virus, killed thousands small businesses put people jeopardy losing livelihoods. 

The majority sub finally starting get that. oomers finally becoming minority. 7% people don’t seroconvert properly covid according studies UK, keep mind  Entirely possible. median age 28. I'm sure counting deaths population young huge surprise may wide spread far fewer deaths. Fortunately, seems like frequent occurrence would seen lot reports now.  definitely. Pfizer alone said they'd able provide 200m doses end May, two months earlier initially expected. Moderna manage too, that's 400m doses end May. Add J&amp;J mix, basically got enough doses vaccinate entire adult population June. I'm guessing close contact includes touching noses, no? Suspiciously specific. easy conflate ""closed down"" ""locked down"". places closed, lockdown, closed-down.  I'm twenties Depends ask. left-leaning circles hang in, newsom maniac opening fast caving big business Rolling average *912k* tells 1.6 million 20th outlier. number doses immediately went 1.3 21st. Plenty old enough realize fucking torture facility immoral shit hundreds milions still vaccinate 

The Oxford vaccine sold cost developing countries **in perpetuity**. Meanwhile developed countries already vaccinated populations. fet wrong totally understand mentality. corruption destructive society, undermines faith system creates bad actors. whole bunch people hopping flight get shot (then flying back, thing month later) trust system going make bad situation worse. sense taste same? Whenever get sick cold lose sense smell sense taste always either goes gets really dull. Nobody surprised happened. Vaccines 100% effective.

I'm going assume he'll end asymptomatic vaccine worked bugs observer gloved hand window frame.

I would expect better training touching things unnecessarily. plant exported UK British one issues ...  would probably trigger people Europe rise overthrow EU. course store things health status, record political affiliations.

None relevant vaccination database.

It *might* make sense separate ""where been"" database people tested positive, contact tracing purposes. people got vaccine long vaccinated group placebo control group come demographic bearing efficacy. follow this:

When Covid gone? Probably never.

When wear masks? Probably summer, except CA.

When deaths hit 0 per day? Probably never, covid going become endemic like flu common cold. People still die these, mostly already old sick. Newsom insanely strict w restrictions 

That said think he’s smart guy might lift earlier conditions allow feel like jerk knowing is, Captain Sir fun title combo guy.

Best luck him, though :/ Even full effect, still might get sick. mean, virus roll natural 20, virus also gets roll million times, people focus ones get sick. figured order 100 million vaccines - needs production months - going possible deliver... last week, 8 weeks away delivery?

Unless expecting producing 10 million vaccines per week EU plants fulfill order time? sound plausible, specially claimed delivering 2 million vaccines per week UK. best case scenario let's say hopping less optimized plant half capacity UK - know can't fulfill it?

It's odd no?  germany going file claim

Big fucking deal. Better authorize Sputnik shit, Germany love Russians. vaccinated chance goes naught, especially cases down. one wants lighten now, tbh it’ll effectively “safe” everyone shot. Also, what’s permanent disability? Zero evidence that. fair, people attending coming place share equally positive cases. There's certainly tradeoff. There's likely optimal mortality rate means maximum transmissibility minimum human effort avoid infection. Honestly, covid-19 hitting sweet spot pretty well UK US export vaccines. EU does. would selfish UK US, would plenty vaccine. would California different? Cali longer bottom doses administered relative supply. scaling capacity rapidly. thedailybeast.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

What draconian measures used contain outbreak Shanghai Beijing? Care yo can't keep saying lock hard enough. argument weak results tighter restrictions.

Why not? Compare Florida's numbers Australia's then. Care explain difference means living year trying alternative locking down.

New Zealand lockdown 2.5 months 2020. vastly freedoms compared US 2020. goes Finland, Singapore, Australia views based bad science.

What views based 2019 pandemic guideline recommend clearly said differently abundance data suggesting correlation lockdown stringency suppression virus.

Go on, show data. keep touting Florida example, realize numbers still really high, right? Florida's cases/deaths per capita actually good.

Meanwhile, tell Florida's recovery going compared China's even NZ measures taken protect old susceptible closing society whole insane.

Why? clearly prevents loss life. think sane thing sacrifice freedoms short period far long term gain. 

I think insane refuse wear masks. think insane one cannot keep gatherings small group couple months. think insane want host large parties middle pandemic. think insane people, applicable, cannot adapt work study I'm talking countries already lockdown year really suffering it.

Yeah, co-ordinated nationwide lockdown 1-2 months like successful countries rather haphazard lockdowns lacking co-ordination actually already stopping it. lift restrictions harm good.

Like Sweden? still restrictions via social distancing WFH recommendations. Many countries also via mask mandates.

They prevent people working, opposition cut world

So US. Go research non-essential land travel in/out US banned. Go research international air travel restricted US residents select countries. US visa office closed, actually understand difficult international traveler enter US?

Seriously, want tell effectively construe US cutting world barred travel hotspots early buy death stats.

You shouldn't. Excess deaths shows COVID deaths underreported globally. That's actual data - have? got developed covid receiving first vaccine 99% sure already covid, also colleague received first dose vaccine weeks developed covid time. It’s completely protective one dose benefits course. There's good chance simply preventing symptoms, vaccine makes people significantly less contagious. addition probably reduces viral load people carry virus. 

But we've spent last year promoting idea asymptomatic carriers contagious symptomatic carriers. hard backpedal that. I’m Zürich can’t even register get vaccinated yet. Whereas freaking neighbors rented full-on bus could go gambling 40 favorite friends. 

Didn't see single mask. smh Yeah, significant number staff infected. think could safely opened? Sweden bad! /s *laughs Panic Buying Perth* possible hospital staff still getting infected rate, showing symptoms? trying play devils advocate sterilizing immunity. cold summer. wanna say anyone who's worried reports couple days feeling unwell Covid vaccine. virus early November, felt like absolute shit full two weeks.

Blame Americans. They're always things like Australia New Zealand. Australians quite bit cynical government's would say Australia shining example countries less money higher population density

I think lessons learnt data collected everywhere, especially victories had. said, always incorrect suggest ""just X country did"". simple answer complex topics say highly urbanised, even Sidney population density compared French village. can't find capital smaller population density Canberra (444/km2).

Partially Australian cities geographically large, mainly Australian cities measured differently rest world. Local Government Areas central Sydney population densities 3,000/km^2 8,000+/km^(2), region much closer analogue global cities' population densities typically measured.

For comparison, figure probably saw Sydney (~420/km^(2)) metropolitan area. Paris's metropolitan area population density around 650/km^(2).

Fair enough. honestly tragic happening. think European countries really done better seeing initially happened Italy. yeah, even first spike U.K, crazy. that's literally case (mostly) everywhere

As someone living southern US, I'm gonna disagree... Lmao smartphone microscope? Ahaha. sense smell subjective, there's way sure everyone 100% recovered it. breathing city air dumbs sense smell.

Their primary end point based post 14 days second shot ENSEMBLE 1 based post 28 days first shot. 

This adds 6 weeks given started later, would expect results late March April.   think knowing facts transmission shot would go long way effectiveness antibodies reduced, likely lot, spike virus' key unlock cell, mutated point escaping antibodies entirely, would also lose ability enter cell, like key deformed fit lock. limit much antibodies lose effectiveness mutated virus longer concern. probably happened lot, see viruses mutated extinction.

The last variant shown effect antibody performance ""mink mutation,"" reduced antibody effectiveness 15%, scientists said problem vaccines. Even vaccines lose effectiveness, slower bring case numbers down, still effective preventing hospitalization deaths.  Probably Finland population that’s like 30% Greater London’s. It’s lot easier prevent transmission vaccine 5 million people living area size Finland.

I agree, neither **everyone** **ONLY**. Big part discussion combination different measures. Sweden found way done much better seem believe. think contribution helpful showing that.

Mask maintained. wearing mask, must also wearing eye protection.

If cannot maintain 1.5m, mask, eye protection, gloves gown required.

I'm unsure specifically guards required, earlier month quarantined nurse 14 days discovered moved within 1.5m patient without gown, despite wearing every item. Normally moved closer, woman hard hearing.

But concerning breach found. They'll going footage, may well requirements variants. Australian, thank god we’re sensible kind top hyperbolic paranoia. Masks prevent catching it. Masks spreading virus. people STILL believe typed? 22 received second dose vaccine yesterday.

הנה דוגמה למקרה הגיוני בו קיים שימוש במילית ל' לפני המושא: ""הוא מסר את הכדור לחברו"".
הפועל ""לימד"" אינו מתאים למשפט הנ''ל, מפני שהמשמעות של ""לימוד שיעור"" היא ללמד לקח. לעומת זאת, ""העברת שיעור"" פירושה להקנות למישהו ידע חדש או יכולת חדשה, כמו שהתכוונת להגיד מלכתחילה. 
לפיכך, ניתן לאמר: ""הוא העביר לילד את השיעור"". (לחילופין, ניתן להשמיט את המילה ""שיעור"" ולנסח את המשפט: ""הוא לימד את הילד את החומר"", ולמרות השימוש בשני מושאים ישירים, המשפט נשמע תקין). 
כנראה שאתה צודק וקיים חוק כזה (ותמיד יש יוצאי דופן).

Don’t get wrong, think good means less 2nd doses get later, wonder unfair people still getting therefore don’t hanging them. Production ramping up, NHS getting better getting vaccinations done.

As long supply problems, expect vaccinations keep getting faster (of course, still lot day-to-day variation). Assuming question posing believe mask mandate.

I'm gonna need source one. Brit, agree you. grandparents (aged 80s) amongst first get Pfizer vaccine mid December. Boris announced early January second doses would delayed grandparents’ appointments went ahead planned 7th January. Apparently, hospital cancelled second doses booked following week. guess small pocket people got second doses Pfizer early on. delays pretty much fixed now. Oxford vaccine made 12 countries across world supply increase producers get used technology. 

It really hard maths. Oxford vaccine much cheaper, easier distribute similar efficacy, countries go that. producing cost teaming biggest vaccine manufacturer world, clear Oxford vaccine produced nba forbid superstars getting vaccine

Zero COVID garbage strategy done far future pandemic restrictions become distant memory. question Vaccines : conspiracy theory, inner musings housework.

I’m Uk based. We’ve done terribly. 100k deaths etc. Something strikes strange though - government really tightened approach lockdown.

First time round months followed, (they) always taking getting economy going. Opening tap etc.

This time around - might talk schools March 8th much else.

It seems it’s either 100k milestone vaccines arrival suddenly got taking seriously.

Which got thinking.

The AZ vaccine (I believe) ready trials September, delay lacking volunteers. first lockdown effective.

Is / case government / scientists / Illuminati (joke) new real way vaccine way achieve invest heavily it, make sure enough victims, sorry volunteers fully run trials?

If taken NZ approach, would vaccine progress possible?

Or simplifying things doesn’t work like that? I'm sure related, say money, put jail pay, trust gather money people, one thing cults great taking resources lower members. 

Say money, least hurts gives money state fight corona, repeat offence, get put prison. 

The police literally said anything ""to avoid violence"", they're pussies.   Thanks!  trial underway India, interim results next month give option drive hundreds miles get vaccine today! Ill it! taken prisoners all? I'm always amazed redditors seem simple answers extremely complex situations. Like guess follow foreign policy dictated website. Stupid question. Wuhan virus considered offensive South African, Brazilian, U.K. variant not? got hate going see parents even though knew risks wanted come anyway can’t logic people cries Canada.. good british variant seems differetn beast really hard contain measures work original variant. compiled theese numbers Denmark.

**B117 numbers Denmark**

In Denmark positive tests sequenced, combined high test rate (almost 2% population per day) low positivity rate (&lt;1%) numbers Denmark perhaps accurate there.

The lockdown bringing infections R(0) = 0,7 beneath British variant growing week 3 make 13% cases. medio Februar British variant dominating driving numbers. seems B117 growing around 60% per week even current lockdown..

**Current lockdown measures** (from medio December):

* schools closed.
* People able to, work home.
* shops open food related health related.
* Restaurants: take away only.
* Mask mandated public transportation indoor public spaces.
* gatherings 5 people.

**Additional info:**

Numbers still smal uncertainty high'ish.

Data (in Danish): necessarily recall, definitely loss support next mayoral election.  right choice necessary lockdowns close main places narcissists want go like bars restaurants without giving shit spreading virus selfish choices much harm.

Moving on? sub facts? see why, take care take care others. literally say every airplane get on. mean...his “goal” literally “don’t fuck previous administration already doing” time team say “omg left zero plan”. Funny works. Infection Fatality Rate 0.6% would mean around 1.8 million people died Covid India, official number 154k, I'm sure likely undercount damn, anyone India knows number possible?

Somebody please take one team... know I’m saying.  issue things says/suggests it/they even consider moment, government supposed say tax payers voters comes implementing/executing ""suggestions"" ""demands"".

Sure makes logical sense, consider pausing vaccinations less risk groups ""to help vulnerable people worldwide"" logic address happens, even one people ""less risk groups"" gets sick, much less dies country put people ahead citizens.

The keep saying things like this, totally ignore realities UK called ""rich"" nations face, would result sending citizens tax payers money resources people neither. 

To wants/demands lose/lose scenario UK ""rich"" countires, winners would citizens/nations fortunate enough receiving end deal.

In end, vaccinations need made available pretty much everyone, probably way try get control. way big ask, comes asking UK nations potentially kill citizens help/save/protect others.

I pretty much end feeling like every time makes announcement like this. guess may feel choice, still pisses every time see/read/hear one kind statements made WHO.

A nation pretty much required take care own, looking help/take care others, able stay power, unless nation democratic representative type gov't. 

Mask up, social distance, limit/reduce chance exposed potentially get infected.

Generational poverty caused US forcing natives migrate across country land familiar natural resources... yeah there's way impacts public health! Except healthcare system US **completely** tied much money Let’s put perspective. can’t expect everything totally normal pandemic. Australia whole lot better world right now. people wining inconvenience vs deaths + massive economic hit comes many deaths nobody goes travels spends money anyways Oh yeah February 2020 virus already United States people lived life like normal good times find happy approach. Happy agree. instead country 9/11 every day Treason specific legal definition. treason.  may socio economical thing. Lower income households people living roof. one work home. go Florida. We’ve open year. weather gorgeous right now. talking NZ? whole country shut down? would say extreme measures worked get handle things. God tier level comment putting danger would one thing, every person isn’t vaccinated another chance virus mutate spread. Don’t skip vaccine. Thats possible majority countries.

If China Shanghai Beijing, excuse goes numbers similar states lockdowns really makes question efficacy lockdowns.

Lockdowns going effective properly enforced states co-ordinate properly. point lockdown going allow travel states enforced one without kind screening.

Also, might want look NYC's even Florida's numbers achieved numbers. Lockdowns work, long term suppression relies people following measures along active isolating contact course states affected equally, evidence says lockdown?

Extra deaths? Look aforementioned countries.

Mental health issues? Tell citizens countries deal much looser restrictions without threat pandemic.

Job loss? countries also recovering seems obivous harm good.

26k dead Florida alone.

Australia bigger population 909 people dead. vacationers would outside, though, infected, they’d taking back would counted state. Lockdowns work fine rapid response, cohesively upheld, short term, targeted. Since US none still international intranational travel going mostly unrestricted, never going work well could have. Good. vaccinated, you:

* get infected SARS-CoV-2.
* spread SARS-CoV-2.
* protected SARS-CoV-2 creating COVID-19 (provided vaccine effective you). think you’re conflating Novavax OX/AZ J&amp;J. 

Novavax DNA vector vaccine, it’s protein subunit vaccine (so also different Moderna &amp; Pfizer). Novavax vaccine gives nano particle studded array spike proteins mounted outside &amp; enhanced immune boosting adjuvant.

Novavax looks higher efficacy viral vector vaccines, closer mRNA vaccines. hate say it, top bottom chart pretty damning. California almost 10% People commute Australia daily basis. Lots people commute across country (and US, state) borders. easy come system. Australians allowed return allowed leave. harder pre Covid. moving goalposts? Politicians, scientists? I'm pretty sure public health experts pretty firm limiting deaths priority number 1, ""end"" pandemic long tail won’t. anything it’s good probably means went deep swabbed aggressively. test people hospital. pressed, want change forced settle mediocrity.

Because given options anything actually good.  ever taught? Perhaps taught someplace authoritarian vibe students conditioned since youth obey, lolled read “students much compliant”. used teach high school, weirdly compliant teens experience. Incredibly imaginative rule breaking would accurate description opinion. 

But back CDCs opinion piece schools, go read it, read studies based recommendation reopening schools upon ask show students indeed “safe”, found justification saying students safer school people least trying follow safety protocols, vs community settings people decided ignore virus used mask wearing there. It’s clean city, point it’s illegal spit public. comparison, NYC filthy garbage dump.

Tokyo less cases japans instrinsic factors, like island nation. coordinated response also probably helped. would unconstitutional US.

Japan virtually zero obesity America unhealthy fat. hand, smoke drink lot Japan.

There’s probably lot reasons Tokyo fared much better NYC, can’t attribute one thing. downvotes literally spewing lies lol, think many aussies replying OP ""uh thats bullshit"", go outside stop getting propaganda fed facebook. think big difference planned changes positive changes one’s life vs unplanned changes negative changes (the latter describe changes forced upon society whole due pandemic). fact able choose take new job new place leaves better many, lost jobs and/or stable living situations, sometimes once, due circumstances surrounding pandemic. think true Australia. Obviously Melbourne lockdown torturously long, three lockdowns stated time shorter. Sometimes, supermarkets never closed here. think 45%, sounds high, true government complained even people symtoms unwilling test cannot work. one 6-8 people get tested (if also add asymptomatic). Herd immunity myth. take look Sweden. blind guy stick, potential weapon. Would ban too? Wheelchairs take much space, let's ban too. Luckily, there's law people like used full force anyone starts fight disabled person. probably feel really good grab old lady fingers like crab pushes out.

We've seen Canada every store got slammed disability act. got court, rest realized can't win.

And no, people die like flies that. guns really crazy Full cracked new resort extreme measures.

what hell think they/we did? alternate reality fucking live in? we're still allowed go shops. work across border, shitshow year. work month, home next month. get trapped one side weeks time.

I'm talking across border either, I'm Sydney work Mackay. even waste time.  yes, totally can't reunited them, right. It’s we’re complaint. massive fines possible jail time average Covid restrictions offender. someone makes less 70K, I’d imagine fines would really hurt. 

If compliant nation, one would rort ATO work cash hand 🤷🏼‍♀️  Exactly. life (in Sydney) completely pre Covid. small lockdown start (March?) wear mask shops three weeks. That's it. I'm maskless, kids go school hang friends, see family friends regularly, get medical issue dealt easily, friends nurses doctors dealing big numbers sick people. I'm happy response.  Mass vaccinations time effect yet. small percent population got vaccine, cannot driving factor. Yes, point article, congratulations: people want better healthcare system general, pressed, actually want change theirs. like it. Good job. old you?? what? bottleneck right prioritize highly specific group groups people. soon average person get vaccine average pharmacy next month. Mark words: look hospital numbers case counts crater one month Walgreens CVS start giving vaccines average people. Men’s Rights Activists? Yes torture facility US government decided could use lock people indefinitely cause immeasurable psychological harm to, held accountable since mainland Yep. OP going around posting every anti school article find.

There's broad consensus schools open. Here’s good thread actual expert know severe. Possibly not.

The data people seem symptomatic it. case fatality seems higher (even that's sure) explained face.

As say: science research slow process, days, weeks, rather years answers. Psychologists literally save lives cases, it’s one professions masks detrimental well.

I would argue need vaccines much medical professions. Japan may reporting deaths, misattributing causes, number problems. also used claim homeless population. New York summer testing state lowest infection rate among tested. New York's rate June 5th September 26th never went 1.5%, never going 1% August 4th September 26th. New York summer working phased reopenings allowing certain things open.

But weather got cold, combined COVID fatigue, well certain ""type"" person buying COVID ""reasons,"" New York amazing again. We're dire situation, we're even close summer levels. I'd say New York worked, problem getting people actually behave arbitrarily decide ""I'm going hang friends care anymore."" That's hard part. Yep, amazed used everywhere. Even Victoria things got hand stabilised life nearly back normal without people dying. sure Taiwan rellies NZ way worse us although well see things go Perth next couple weeks AUS! AUS! AUS! things open people assume ok go assume careful. people usually wrong. pay it, others don't. State Goverments, Scotty way would shit creek right Someone’s bit upset Australia hasent fucked pandemic up, killerjerick right peaceful Help here,we 1,2,3? Different types, whose say vaccines help strains? 

And, let's say discovered,does mean producing different vaccine? I'm patiently waiting turn,and things changing day day.

Very confusing, ya eli5 ,thank you. I’m RN covid unit I’ve seen 3 people last week come issues vaccine Constant fear next draconian lockdown? lot fewer lockdowns Europe US. fear here.

The Australian government deserve criticism border policy could better. better policy many countries currently have.

It's funny people overseas comment like Australia. clearly little understanding actually like here. muhh variants 😱😱 (aka ones literal months, yes UK, yes SA) kind national organisation could sort out. would lead it? Here’s fantastic Twitter thread expert field answering  call yearly flu vaccines ""booster vaccines"", feel terminology wrong here.

Let's call yearly corona vaccine instead. SA/BR variant combines UK variant add deletions receptor binding domain spike protein keeps important mutations maintain higher virulence, reinfection, antibody neutralization, etc. would need completely new vaccine current ones focus spike changes would allow vaccine work. 

I doubt it’ll happen, it’s huge risk. would literally shit myself. vaccines undergo rigorous Phase 1 Phase 3 trials determine truly safe efficacious? voted comment true. australians want admit better way handling whole situation new zealand, taiwan iceland singapore demonstrated without resorting travel exit bans. unfortunately, side effect ban resulted stoking xenophobic attitude Australians. even fellow overseas Australians spared, viewed selfish unaustralian daring want live anywhere else australia. minds, feel grateful shut ever question things run. Lol, mild climate? Florida never even real lockdown business say work. Light 'em up! surprised people arent even considering new variants. Usually variants something worry least two reduce vaccine effectiveness. Transmission virus widespread allowing variants like SA variant form. addition, vaccines dont prevent infection, imagine resumed normal life two months later(due increased transmission caused resuming normal life) variant made vaccines completely useless formed? Considering dangerous Covid is, happening totally unrealistic. NT already that, Qld looking that.  should, won't.

Which sad, saw shortcuts case Boeing 737Max killed hundreds. also harsh restrictions Thanksgiving. saw small uptick holidays  Don’t think employers authoritah mandate employees take vaccine. personally would rather quit. Worse how? US, cases going vaccines going arms Dude stop posting old misleading articles schools. [The consensus Give up. fair vaccine still work, regardless scoops eyeballs understanding claims transmission coming phase III trials, since basis vaccine approval, would require much data. understand widespread vaccinations occurring, transmission data gathered. OP study one first address this.

So really speculation part, following conventional wisdom far experience still know someone vaccinated develop asymptomatic infection transmit virus. Although phase 3 clinical trials designed determine whether vaccinated individuals protected disease, also important understand whether vaccinated individuals less likely transmit virus. likely ensured.

Prior june 2017 full time parent 4 years casual job kids school/daycare saving study. relationship functioning adult.

My ex (and mother kids) asked move back guy left broke her, said no.

What followed 2 month long stalking harassment campaign ex targeting gf. stopping got restraining order.

My ex's response retaining order take kids school next morning dropped make false report sexual abuse 3 year old, me.

It investigated DCP family Court. Thrown times ex warned never bring again. spread rumor socially instead.

Those knew me, cut contact ex. people dont know believe her. ones targeted me. 

I living fear since repeatedly attacked, stalked harassed public.

Except lock down.

It's one time get peace. Since lock downs almost cars outside apartment anyone watching place stand out. crowds public places blend move freely get affidavits witnessed get food/medication (diagnosed PTSD result ex's tantrum).

My heart goes anyone negatively affected lock downs virus. isolating since 2017 horrible thing get used to. one hell incentive program. Ending hospital attempted social outing really adjusts comfortable with, quickly. advantage able actually see go out. made easier rationalize.

I can't even imagine must like go normal life, locked existence something lot people personally seen existence of. I'm saying real, must hard seen someone close hurt virus locked same. reconcile suffering something hearing news outlets testing non existent faith.  unemployment overdoses mean really thing waiting year start it. They're going find anything.  23th fractured it? that’s case wtf point buying enough doses vaccinate 200 million people. keep seeing said makes sense. Especially consider current timetable claims we’ll maybe 100 million doses J&amp;J time almost 400 million doses mRNA vaccine. fear lockdowns. Many millions Australians never leave shores. desire leave comment dismissed. body, choice. people say thing, thing. Wtf love covid That's said though it. Since risk death completely negligible non existent young healthy people, case idea. 
It happen million years course least purposely misstate intent. Well virtual sessions difficult many patients likely get asked come back work sooner later. makes sense got it. Bragging isn’t great, maybe meant talk hype isn’t scary people? lot people still seem worried shot it’s effects (not tho I’m ready) Haha, last year pandemic US Europe idea sorting things out, think world much hope. yeah much enjoying living virus free bubble thanks. finished month long road trip pretty awesome! Oh, forgeted, US left WHO.

Schools need keep home schooling. don’t believe kids follow rules. Around live none young people wear mask they’re about.

We missing something virus. Something isn’t quite right. Look France, lockdown effect contagion keeps going up?

People didn’t travel ending variants, etc. opinion, think Covid inside us whole time something activated it. DISCLAIMER, personal belief. Everyone denies vaccination heavily fined forced dig graves deceased. Absolutely. made promise going anything different yet. people sub claiming well back normal like May full shit. Like think we’ll basically back normal late summer masks gonna us 2021 people need accept instead deluding themselves. think we’ll see restrictions lifted sooner masks gonna around least places currently require them. Oh ya, worries.

I boat OP super paranoid careful would get mad mask people.

With new thing wasn’t safe vaccinated, push first couple minutes it’s like, boom, it’s normal again.

Just like way thing weird shit took getting used to, thing way out.

We adaptable species, happens quick.  unamerican. Well friend, we’re seeing cases drop already it’s even February. vaccines ramping considerably. Also, never disregard history pattern established like that. history points certain way Multiple times I’d pay attention friend.  1day drops increases don’t tell much rolling averages look pretty good Generally life, usually long term measured years decades. vary person person. We? Them? murder anyone. Hopefully murder anyone. living people I'm talking certainly murdered. what, bring back blood debt? Debt carried families across generations? Fuck that.

You deal public health crisis today talking crap occurred hundreds years ago relevance rational vaccine distribution today. Otherwise, maybe Bob's grandchildren get vaccine grandchildren Bob killed grand parents drinking driving. dont want vaccine, dont force views people. Isnt getting vaccine optional? choose refuse it? Right? US?

Oh, forgeted, US left WHO.

And US  full punishing international organization officers' history. tell rubber bullet guns loaded inoculation capsules.

Damn polite virus! Good them. United States. rules would never tolerated here. Oh my! Now, that’s drastic. way figure much due vaccine, much due WHO's new testing protocols designed reduce false positives? would guessed deaths ICU admissions would change parallel one another. explanation (that older, vulnerable patients less likely ICU admitted prognosis) makes sense. Still interesting shift think problems. Cool post! Imagine frustrating find of
your closest friends (pre-covid) people. Terrible Received test results CVS following:

Component Results:

Component: BioReference COVID-19 Nasopharynx

Your Value: Positive 2019-nCoV

Standard Range: Detected

Can anyone help interpret results? I'm confused ""Positive"" mention, also ""Not Detected"" means negative.

So damn virus not? actually pretty strong reasons believe it’s seasonal. understand frustration believe there's suggestion wrongdoing ""dumb"" security guard. applauded reporting symptoms getting tested.  60% deaths people 75

81% 65

Calculated here:  flu always there, cases summer.  Don’t cha know 6 feet away you’ve “been careful” virus recognize won’t infect principle. /s. virus don’t give duck that. constructs put place help slow spread.

Ever wonder part distribution problem worrying shit like this? isn’t Atlas Shrugged. really know I'm getting downvoted, otherwise. guys downvoting facts?😂 Agreed. get-go McGowan tough premier around covid, certainly reflects case numbers Countries like UK, france, Columbia strictest lockdowns world still worst outcomes.  make simple dummies.. Covid stay. Makes sense, that’s bunch scientists speculating. 

Now I’m concerned see lies longer able hide truth. 

Stock exchange pretending nothing happening nearly 1 million people unemployed US every week. year unemployed you’re considered work force interpreted positive ‘recovery’ reality small businesses pretty much done stimulus checks won’t jumpstart anything, especially people never able catch again. fact needed three proof started late ended early. later start, longer take. Look Melbourne's, succeeded took 4 months. high death rate waited, also really ""proper"" lockdowns times. Hoarding taking need. anywhere close. could wrong Im one them, maybe they're protesting believe could detriment other's health. Hence, want others get hurt.

Obviously, agree reasoning vaccine, thought might coming from. Uhh yes are, increasing number doses 1 still vaccinating people faster. Vulnerable I'm healthy 27 year old. practically hope getting one sadly. gotta wait see. Bureocracy squabbling EU force multiple countries cancel vaccine orders re-order centralised vaccine programme? 

Probably show ""unity strenght"" EU Brexit, good old dick measuring contest. 

But, serious note, Hungary, example, got Russian Chinese vaccines, outside EU centralized program. Germany also seems eye-balling vaccines. P/B, also effective vaccine. UK must hope SA variant doesn’t hasn’t already hit ground much, appears AZ vaccine significantly less effective. P/B Modena also capable adapting vaccine mutations. Look. drink hell lot  Airplane rules EU actually ordered 600 mil doses total. Currently they're getting vaccines first 300 mil doses. latest 300 mil shipped Q2-2021. national guard military defense, pandemic defense. Useful pinch needed. I've always gotten impression doctor's schedules end getting blown overscheduling also elderly patients take lot time.

A lot people really going doctors routine care right now, especially elderly, much they've gotten efficient inefficiencies staying home. takes full year schooling become credentialed teacher. can’t walk street start teaching. problems occurred months ago, time doses produced due problems less produced. Anyone buying vaccines would aware large degree uncertainty surrounding vaccine production. problems said sorted production resume intended rate. lower rate production previously, countries get doses later best case scenario predicted. 

They overestimate could produce. ability produce 3 billion doses - anyone else - across world slower expected start due manufacturing issues change that. experience producers get producing vaccine, quicker vaccine produced. large overlap evangelical Christianity anti vaccine opinions. protesting administration vaccine. Dominant doesn’t necessarily mean surge.  That's quite breach  Personally Boris Johnson, I'd distribute vaccines intended Europe commonwealth realms, overseas territories, crown dependencies. work next one AZ factories. seemed making months approval even trial results. they’ve building stocks long time. vaccine worked/ approved would bin. 

The gamble paid though! Nice almost 10% US gotten shot get first automatically booked second. really optional, nhs aggressive people missing booked appointments. There's way 100% prevent getting covid part society interact human beings, includes lot people work really hard taking precautions protecting others. would say people take least basic precautions America. Even anti-maskers wear masks business requires part.

There's really point trying figure many people blame individually. place stigma people get it, make people future either avoid testing keep secret get positive test, they'll likely around others infected potentially spread it.

I agree person replied said rhetoric comes people wanting believe control whether get sick not, even best, can't control everything virus does. that's okay. make anyone weak anything make people fearful. best. 

And yeah, also stigmatizing like make people feel like can't *anything* otherwise might get sick people blame judge like this, also bad society. Oh canada, say sorry bothering too? Luv ya joke...? Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine currently sold cost price, UK contributed Covax scheme EU states combined.

Getting really fed UK hate. country expected give away much-needed vaccines **rich, developed** nations, UK bad guy propping EU 1,000 Brits die every day Covid? absolutely fucking is. fucking HOW? really. *sounds* good, really help much anything. Especially since NG sitting ready anyway, active duty process getting vaccinated. really hope people see investing NHS worth it. I'd happily pay taxes know stronger NHS hes right since beginning AZ stated UK placed order three months EU did, hardly hoarding. fulfilling contract.

Just supply issues continent affect *your* order, unfortunate, mean point another country's order say ""give us we're sticking hard border Ireland"".

Absolute insanity. Headline brought smile face. Feeling super optimistic point (I know..still long way go though). Except risk mutations, can’t see way point don’t see drop death rate soon US. Could logistics distribution plan better? course... point, I’m going complain. Maybe result lack seriousness virus (insert whatever political statement wish here), likely well 1/3, possibly higher, level immunity virus (through past infections vaccination). rate US, virus starting hit dead-ends search new hosts. guess mandates place fall, people stop complying/enforcing late spring. Ask dr believe it’s recommended wait 60-90 days Bureocracy squabbling jurisdiction.

Why EU force multiple countries cancel vaccine orders re-order centralised vaccine programme? Yep. anything M40 North. Hospital ICU too. want feel positive hopeful!! tbh want strung portland dead fan tripping acid administer vaccine


Just way type already questioning effectiveness plan. Man hope so, first article say sensitive PCR, actually says used people known exposure, mildly symptomatic. basically conformational test. used entrance superbowl/superbowl party example. want go away, can't cavelier go it. Anti maskers small numbers annoyance, generally strike balance personal freedom collective good expect political leadership same.
Our health authorities said need 90% compliance health directions control spread virus we've achieved comfortably. knowing idiot, everyone die May.   I’m talking vitamin D.

Not heat. US already hitting 1.2 Million vaccinations per day 3 million day something easily handle. I've seen fair amount countries getting Russia vaccine. believe saw Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico. apart the...literal guarantees contracts signed? focusing giving first dose first waiting longer recommend second.

Also, thanks part NHS. makes easy track contact people elegible vaccine. Another perk public health system 957k 7 day average first doses. 368k 7 day average second doses. 1.325m overall. smart comeback thought Balanced interesting article. Let's face can't blame Brits looking post-Brexit. think advantages EU working together still outweigh disadvantages, EU leaders need held account problems continue.  Welcome Manchester United, Anthony Martial! It’s 2040 Bulgaria inter-county supply chain would partially use domestic one. Belgium neither Netherlands Germany ...

I understand passion put bullshit arguments. Since discussion started UK saying initial doses manufactures Netherlands Germany, bullshit arguments inter-country supply chains exactly that, bullshit arguments. Well lets see, German politics joke right now.   tf talking about? reports since January 5th lot could do. facilities manufacture mRNA vaccines Canada US EU applying pressure keep citizens. lockdown done outside company? missed that. largely incorrect, standard policy UK first second dose 12 weeks apart. thousand people doses 3 weeks apart (a tiny trickle continue -- pre-booked appointments policy change, think?) vast majority close 12 weeks apart. Melbourne whole Vic locked down?

For second point, arguments governments made mess things opening last summer playing catch &amp; making go along ever since real plan end goal

I'd contest 'hard yards' point though, Ireland we've made massive sacrifices form lockdown since last March (with exception July - September things somewhat relaxed). 5km thing police fining people 5km home (even people going solitary walk wilderness) pretty much everything closed foreseeable future  grandmother law one already. believe got lucky fairly quiet area. She’s old heart condition. jabbed family friends date 2nd vaccine. Looking last ten posts pushing anti-EU agenda.

Thank you! feel specifically vulnerable underlying lung condition never properly identified. keeping myself, keep distance like mad man, still help elderly neighbor shopping stuff. help other. Stay safe. Ignoring science don’t? 

Can provide example? 

I’m saying there’s data support idea mutations evolve bypass *all protective immunity*...... provide said data? 

Science isn’t opinion pieces NY Times 2 minute quotes Dr. Fauci - it’s methodology involves proper sampling theory, rigorous data analysis, hypothesis testing, etc. It’s long drawn process find many people don’t time for. I’m actually *opposite* you’re suggesting - I’m saying science citing facts needs met proper data backs say - data suggest anything mutations blowing past protective immunity. know. pretty accurate article May 1 2020.
 enormous amount people already antibodies hasn’t stopped elderly dying alarming rate. Better vaccinate at-risk. brutal violation basic human rights.

Using logic, use brutal methods to, say, reduce crime (because saves thousands lives!) still ok that? Pretty sure meant last April Yesterday rolling average 1.35 million believe sincerely hope works out. excellent reality check whether blanket vaccine coverage good publicized, commented on, whether variants pose larger problem outwardly recognized. death 40 robs someone another 40 years death 80 statistical years. Also quality life, I'd rather extra year 40 5 extra years 80. fixed several countries still get less promised months now? seems like massively overestimated ability produce. Pfizer hand, deliver much originally promised. infection rate 30k ish day. vaccination 20x better. Eat COVID! flew American back August LAX DFW social distancing, plane full. think industry standard point airlines confident air filtration systems. buy work well someone sitting right next you, that's cite.

And thinking paid half year ago?

Once somebody write book AstraZeneca debacle. say could 62% efficacy 12 weeks would 3 weeks, it’s properly trialled well established, self-admitted pattern deliberately misinforming American people. He's propagandist infectious disease expert. majority American people morons fucking LOOOVE censorship, propaganda, giving civil liberties. Things going get worse. Maybe poster flying work choice airline I'm massive remain supporter, still prefer UK member EU not, however... really worked favour terms vaccinations it. EU shit bed here.  Oh one expert that's saying new variants?

 countless others find worrying subject sub days, people selective blind announcements? Remember phrase around May/June?

The pandemic isn’t we’re tired it, it’s everybody stops getting sick.

Lately sub obsessed proclaiming must able *X* activity *Y* date, (or else!), yet there’s little discussion ground situation must look like allow returns normalcy. need do? Stop asking want, start asking need. pandemic could month everybody got vaccinated today. People need seriously come governments harass slow vaccine distribution. Jail officials throw vaccines away rather use people outside correct phase. 

If want normalcy return, let’s make happen. Focus getting vaccines out. We've tried first worldwide lockdown human history year, bunch 'near miracle vaccines'.

If that's enough stop it, we'll face consequences.

Open up. anti-brexit feel kinda nice seeing EU back stupid export controls considering putting it. really.

Okay. Well they’re fucking miserable people around lol. absolute biggest entitled idiots planet. meltdown wear mask grocery stores, you’re oversized glorified toddler.

I can’t wait restrictions wear masks couple months, it’s really big deal. ain’t first you’re last people know fly across country see loved ones Súper bowl Sunday? AZ vaccines coming UK EU. 

If EU wants start vaccine war, obviously power that. situation caused clearly shows would nothing gain so. agree even know possible.

Right now.

There's downside likely rising death rates. one-in-humanity worldwide lockdown plus 'near miracle' vaccines stop it, we're 'sunk cost' territory.

Open up. know needed travel super unhelpful comment mean it’s little pedantic...

They wanted $2,000 checks last bill got $600 checks, $1400 fills gap. downvoted latching one expert disregarding countless others say hardest part winter. Funny Fauci fanboys trying censor truth. point stats ALWAYS ignore member state funding include DIRECT EU funding order distort actually going on. parlour trick preferred biased ""journalists"".

No, German investment largely research. article talking building production investment supply chains, something eu responsible for. 

Feel free share similar data, figure research investment. Maybe quote enough, would suggest reading article context. appreciate insight, thanks phase 2 access probably starts april appointments absolute shitshow awhile that. lowest risk groups could likely see getting shot anytime Easter July 4th basically EU without EU agree. live process already begun can’t say blame them. Whilst I'm proud UK really hope point divert vaccine rest Europe rest world. think anything wrong vaccine procurement certainly steal Europe, I'd like think could good neighbors EU help soon we're able. 

Vaccinate old, people risk anyone else that's frontline. start help Europe whilst slowing vaccination rate bit. I'll happily wait longer it'll keep people alive.

Would useful haha.  writing like poorly coded bot? proven success vaccines reduce severe covid. probably effect preventing lesser infections, definitely full protection Moderna Pfizer vaccines effective preventing infections far vaccines go. they're 100% department. data come transmission soon, likely good news. 

we also know much time elapsed individuals getting jabbed getting infected. second doses Moderna Pfizer take little week take full effect. even longer first dose. AstraZeneca received 300 million euros, 200 million already received, 6 months sort things deliver 120 million vaccines, initial goal. 31 million (40 today) doses. discovered disappearance 59 million vaccines week ago. 6 months 300 million euros for, gonna announce week approval missed initial goal 89 million one was, according CEO, Commission legal argument that, put in-front Belgium judge make case, date, failed do. 

I think clause explicitly states AZ cannot obliged third party contract circumstance. contractually allowed put UK front EU. did, breach contract.

It clause 13.1 - e AZ-EU represents, warrants covenants Commission Participating Member States obligation, contractual otherwise, Person third party respect Initial Europe Doses conflicts inconsistent material respect terms Agreement would impede complete fulfillment obligations Agreement;

But I'm legal expert, prefer stick Soriot, breach contract contract would merely require ""the best possible effort"" honor agreements. According him, hard obligation. addition, ***he suggested United Kingdom priority deliveries London signed contract AstraZeneca ahead EU.***   contract also shows AstraZeneca's two UK sites expected make vaccines EU. ***The pharmaceutical company say contract United Kingdom given priority***, Soriot suggested. London states vaccines manufactured United Kingdom intended British.

So seems like AZ CEO *lied* specific argument. I’m sorry hear , careful it’s tough become addicted sauce. Emphasis p ASAP. Many stores Florida never truly required them. Big corporate places like walmart many definitely anymore.

Around here, like never pandemic sucks hard not, cut number vials 20% reflect vial worth 6 doses. Yeah, writing style seriously raising doubts person. dunno, that's good reason science.

In fact, ""do science"". Sorry direct source. talking CBC Radio Friday. possible right later fulfillment believe Moderna specifically said manufacturing issues slowed production, allocated Canada going US instead. pubs already packed nearly every weekend? know UK contract says EU contract limited third party obligations AstraZeneca.   forget put don’t there? that’s pretty sadistic. Amazing. Go Novavax get point. Good. started says article. vaccinated treated pneumonia Covid using Madden weather feature /s me. hope I'm 75 children, teenagers, young adults think need put lives hold indefinitely eke years. education important remote education replacement person learning? Even Germany Super Bowl party typically 10 people.

There many NFL highly regarded Germany, I'm expecting another surge. That's fair point. 

But also extremely irresponsible EU put eggs AZ basket, especially something crucial vaccine they've seemingly promised millions across Europe. 

*And*, Ursula von der Leyen apparently took responsibility project - given physician background, surely would experience difficulty surrounding vaccine manufacturing act accordingly?

I can't comment AZ's actions directly think there's motive - would be? like there's profit had.

Anyway, hope situation resolves quickly European citizens start receiving vaccines soon. ultimately that's about. cry everything I’m fine it. quotes EU official.

You busy spreading tendentious nonsense health experts like CDC Chicago Department Health good enough, standard advocating for? Contract says get first dibs mate think people stop listening.  priority group 4 	All 70 years age clinically extremely vulnerable individuals (not including pregnant women 16 years age)

You see groups list included medical conditions sure compares flu vaccine. here. Cant wait walk pub buy beer bar. worry booking table, ordering app wearing mask fifty trips toilet there. Germany alone put least 2 billion risk money , seem exclude member state money. always stats include direct EU funding distort. shit different day.

I literally put Germany post aware that. virulent strain COVID circulating US time numerous super spreader events (rallies) held almost daily basis bunch people gathered (against medical advice) Thanksgiving. 

That (this?) Winter wave makes lot sense backdrop. 

I wonder accelerates projections B.1.1.7 become dominant strain US late Feb/early March? love current guidance vaccine dosing schedule well. completely devoid scientific backing, even changed due practicalities.

Get second dose day 21/28 (brand dependent). 4 days earlier OK recommended. get earlier, do, that's OK. go 6 weeks first dose, that's OK, go longer. do, that's OK. mix dose brands, do, that's OK too. Check pubs Tampa next Sunday. Well they're starting wrong foot already dumb, let’s move on. quotes EU official. vaccinating 60 million people. top 9 categories massive impact hospitalisation. Also, you’d get less depression antimaskers 

lol remember people like outside anti-maskers? That’s good point. Ok code job Army medic. one.  implying letting pandemic go waste? Money rules everything around me. Florida could saved lives placed sort restrictions (for example mask mandate). Florida California’s death rate (1019-1034 per million), 4139-4505 less people would died Florida. California Florida’s death rate (1227 per million), 7600-8200 people would died California. put range today’s California’s number hasn’t fully come yet worldometers, used 650 deaths California today high range. Subpar? offers 90% efficacy mild disease 100% effective severe disease whilst much cheaper buy store.
. set goal well taken office, least they’re settling that. 

He’s upped goal [150 million vaccines first 100 

I suspect upped approach 2 million day. excellent hopefully phase 5 far behind US countries like Isreal UK. think take longer EU, considering slowly vaccinations going there. Norway, exact vaccines. Learn source info 

It makes life easier, harder sources caricatures correct. Direct EU vaccine funding small part total spent 27 member governments. 

The EU pre-financed vaccine AZ defaulting contractual obligations. 

That's short long it.

It's clear since December AZ dodge company never selected partner talking whole world, Western countries I'm pretty good. Would like get sure overall I've fine pandemic. executive broad emergency powers could brought bear political support population (and like say, congress could also pass legislation political will). 

You're right never happen, though, that's part reason US absolutely fucked epidemic probably every future one like it. adverse idea temporary restrictions prevent mass death disease. numbers ignored, important know still good enough. might kill it, keeps bay able produce new better vaccines. even better treatment people get really sick. science stopped today, would worries, start fighting back even getting KO moment attack. They’re probably sarcastic. People trying rain everyone’s parade lately, every single time positive news get shared.  Sweet ad hominim dude! Check research. action research showing elsewhere world. also work nursing home. story *knock wood* second Moderna doses less week away! GLOBALLY Lockdowns prevent economic damage, neither virus blazing control. Stop electing morons please. There's also fact none security imposed 9/11 went away fears terrorism subsided United States. there's chance, all, could foot door flu testing flights five years now, want give precedent. adults raise children. Without adults, parents, would take care children? publications even try sensationalize literally everything. moment brought *the good chemicals* (TM)  ignoring J&amp;J potentially Novavax (I think AZ ever approved US honestly). Yeah lot. anyone gets someone got school counted. teacher got gave another teacher, bar full people everyone counted outbreak originated school. specifically say 20 kids though could kids got parents hypothetical bar. article says that's smart thing 6 month timeframe reinfection risk negligible. remember incorrectly US 200 million doses delivered end March, getting 150,000,000 end April would still disaster. RIP influenza. next. long there's uncontrollable spread virus anywhere can't closely monitored matter time mutation renders vaccines useless goes world tour.

Agreed. one safe everyone safe. ""Has anyone... anyone seen the—""

*distant hoof noises* And? I'm sure do. blame you. I'm Korean cousins, aunt uncle America feel way. JJ promising 100-million vaccines United States June back normal summer. 

We three vaccine providers able ship enough vaccinate entire population June. He's right. thing all. EU put order X amount AZ vaccine doses condition doses manufactured Belgium. paid doses though contract specifically stipulates doses going EU. 

India didn’t order pay AZ vaccines. made deal AZ (and I’m guessing cooperation low income countries) manufacturing hub developing world &amp; return get X amount vaccines domestic markets too. 

So basically EU paid sum put order couple hundred million doses. India hand didn’t pay anything offered service supply India also developing countries. 

So you’re wrong sense India benevolence “didn’t distribute free vaccines”. agreement specifically states vaccine given India supply internal market &amp; wider developed world. isn’t exactly selfless act India’s part - again, it’s U.K. taxpayer funded vaccine Oxford University. Oxford university negotiated vaccine sold cost price they’re ones receiving credit here. recently. shut hydroxychlor-equine. novavax one. smart people twitter said would even better candidate tweak regularly Oh that's great idea! severity damage reduced large margin well. people seem misunderstanding ""mild symptom lasting damage"" simply occurred body overreacted, attacked place cause visible symptom. vaccine, immune system far less likely go crazy attack body. trying shame others woke BS.

Yes, famously woke radical *The Economist* magazine. Looking like 25 percent drop new cases since last saturday, projecting remaining states may report. Eat bag dicks way Things gotten better mentally since around Jan 20th. That's interesting. 5 drugs? treat? What? makes feel better went eat playoff last weekend 12 days first dose tested negative. You’ll probably okay. Yeah man got um. cracked code. 🙄 first world. True, BioNTech still contributed lot ending pandemic. It’s almost year, still want argue masks you’re obviously going change mind. learn adapt produce things greater good without profit hurdle. Maybe started giving age groups risk contracting virus - people going work - we’d start get rid virus agree you’re right. it’s annoying listening “mask trust science” medical community like 40% vaccine refusal rate. 

All science says vaccines safe effective.  want vaccine badly parents wont let Yes, think page . opinion even people vaccinated act like pandemic still wear mask wise SARS far less virulent. makes angry, wait see amount Healthcare workers refusing vaccine ""don't want Guinea pig"" US clear start would like that. allow people make deals companies say ""oh well fucked need reroute doses already paid for"" like EU here. Getting first dose Wednesday! course silly stupid delivery driver see got wrong job chip, dumb, ill go back


Your argument completely went door imply people forcibly.... *given* new jobs ???

What giving job nonsense 

You realize incredibly touch reality sound know virtue signaling, tbh, way I've able convince people know IRL super open experience... Posting vaccine selfie, talking side-effects experienced, happily answering anyone's questions, etc.. Resilience children reliant support adults guiding trauma. actually traumatized long term lock-downs likely also lived adults stress stretched thin, leaving less able provide kind emotional support kids need. I’m saying kids, since many lot needs met. plenty suffer long-term trauma society basically abandoning year more. Apologies, meant UK US funded much Pfizer manufacturing ramp production chains (long prior evidence would get trials). entirely correct Germany paid initial research creation vaccine itself. Here's rough, back envelope math:

We 93 million Americans natural immunity COVID-19. works 28% population.

Source: also administered 30 million vaccine doses far, 2 shot vaccine. We're also administering 1.3 million doses day now, number expected increase. 100 million doses Pfizer another 100 million doses Moderna ordered now, easy see we'll able administer doses June (when we're due receive more), let's say 100 million fully vaccinated Americans due Pfizer Moderna June 1st.

On top Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. company released data yesterday, based timelines Pfizer Moderna vaccines approved, mean we're able start putting doses arms around late February. doses 1 shots, gives notable advantage currently approved vaccines. Additionally, US set receive 100 million doses J&amp;J vaccine June.

So 100 million 1 shot vaccines combined 100 million Pfizer/Moderna vaccinated Americans comes 200 million fully vaccinated Americans June 1st. comes 60% population.

Let's also say need 75% immunity COVID-19 reaching herd immunity. Well 75% 330 million works 248 million. assume 120 million Americans herd immunity COVID-19 June 1st, assumption consider reasonable, assume proportion Americans vaccinated correlates proportion total Americans vaccinated, means 40% 120 million herd immunity without vaccination. actually works 48 million Americans, exactly we'd need herd immunity.

This even factoring AZ/Oxford Novavax vaccines, likely approved June. Even factor bit margin error (admittedly rough) calculations, pretty fair say we'll great shot reaching 75% immunity July 1st.

The one obvious flaw math account current lack vaccine children. say 1) Fauci expects vaccine children approved summer, 2) good amount children have, continue to, acquired natural immunity virus. Mandatory testing would make air travel inaccessible except wealthy. 

Testing expensive. airline tickets. Many people can't afford risk getting false positive cancel trip. 

It's even worse problem return trip: majority travelers would huge problem forced spend extra two weeks destination returning home (hotel costs, issues employers, issues family members / pets back home, etc.). baseline sera dilution 1:100 still well that. decrease decrease big deal still neutralization levels. ton factors contribute getting sick besides pay health care plan nothing genetics. 

Can cite study examines Covid death rates white black officers concludes genetics primary cause? Fear literally thing worked. doesn’t know. Cases plummeting US soon elderly teachers mainly vaccinated scaredy cats nothing else hide behind. trials almost entirely US I’m guessing majority people general population gonna get J&amp;J’s vaccine, since it’s one dose easiest distribute. 

Pfizer Moderna probably reserved at-risk groups healthcare workers much larger chance dying getting severe complications this. Biden's one hundred million doses one hundred days seen absolute worst case scenario vaccine interest increase time, vaccine manufacturing can't ramped up, new vaccines approved. Even happens, we'd still probably cross 100,000,000 doses administered sometime March. way takes end April there's unforeseen disaster. lot things would go wrong us *not* get 100,000,000 vaccines administered Biden's first hundred days. big fan articles written acting like variants haven’t months. Slaoui pays association certain US president, deserves lot credit. OP, take credit best way saw explain it.

There 330 million people United States.

[In 7700 people died every day average.

That means (7,700/330,000,000) \* 100% = 0.002333333% people United States die every day. normally: COVID, average-year death causes.

Assume vaccinating million people every day -- would low end now.

0.002333333% 1,000,000 23. say: took 1,000,000 people complete random United States every day, 23 expected die. Let's say 1,000,000 people U.S. eat yogurt breakfast. 23 die day eating yogurt -- spooky, right?

Not exactly. Yogurt's killing them. may well died anyway. (This perfect statistical thing, though. percentage 23 car crashes, murders, suicides, etc. percentage could be, say, heart attack stroke make look like yogurt killed them.)

All means that, million (low estimate) get vaccine everyday, nonzero number may well die. expected, overreported: news report every single person gets vaccine, substantially likely report someone dies right injection. Again, perfect: hope overreaching say deaths blue. nonzero percentage are, come hours vaccine there's bound suspicion. there's good chance would died anyway. Expand four days after, family member does, good may die. Also consider whether deaths exaggerated given age range current vaccine recipients.

Nothing's impossible, given vaccine given millions upon millions, we'd probably know actively causing deaths. Medical professionals smarter seen anything worry about. silly worry. Hope helps OP! Lockdowns always recommended solution. And, we've always war Eastasia. article cases UK, US. We’re irrelevant here. Well even Belgium got contract supply EU look faltered. India might invented AstraZeneca vaccine considering 1.3 billion population, country obligations distribute free vacines still so. That's got count something. Fair enough. uk gov it’s little late anyway. I’m trying get home avoid financial burden despite measures coming effect potentially US point. Whether agree doesn’t change fact might deal them. lol Biden trying help airlines right now. Even lax controls place they're 30% pre-pandemic volume people trust flying. Mandatory testing would go long way towards restoring trust. California, April 2021: Hospitalizations 0 martial law declared. GameStop Megacorp police hired arrest anyone leaves house unless essential business.

j/k, realistic hope April would indoor dining open everywhere; probably still limited capacity, reservations hard come pandemic lot people mentally. Mask mandates likely still place indoors. It’s hard say, even NYC supposedly getting indoor restaurants back 2/14 (just announced yesterday), think optimistic! course Vancine producers make money decades due new vaccine every year new strain. reality live showing work months paying hotel months simply inconvenience people? ""reality""? Announcing closure bit earlier mean people travel, means people still need travel home time arrange that. means less crowding airports. think thousands people trying change flight time effect crowded airport is? know someone reaction first dose also think biggest reason many say June (which think possible, likely) deaths hospitalizations disproportionately stratified age, 40% deaths 1% population (nursing homes) something like 80% deaths/similar hospitalizations take place 16% population (those 65+). entire population could easily vaccinated next two months. 

Furthermore, restrictions place solely purpose overwhelming hospitals. deaths hospitalizations low level, there's really legitimate argument keep things shut down. Regardless think ""long covid"" frankly pretty rare getting infected covid seriousness bad young, danger long covid valid argument staying form lock down. 

Lastly, sub follows Youyang Gu's model herd immunity pretty closely here: dude best running model covid infections accurately modeling vaccination rollout. Take look page get better idea.

There likely covid cases entirety 2021. matter levels low virtually deaths like they'll getting supplies anytime soon really matter. FTFY: back fire. said used control unvaccinated people  It’s shocking successive LIB ans CPC governments didn’t see serious threat national security public health. collective failure government we’ll paying price long time come

Lol case lucky ones?? feel little better lately, probably also due light, warmth, get together family outside soon maybe. still hopeful end fall/beginning winter Rapid testing costs low $15. Even false positives negatives still provides passengers sense security. infilled planes cost lot money too...

Meanwhile airlines fraction capacity people don’t want fly people might positive. 

Other less developed countries already this. USA, though, make excuses. Similar N95 masks (people won’t able wear correctly) on.

People need find solutions rather negative. Rapid testing isn’t rich people. lockdowns work, cases per capita NY CA states eschew lockdowns like Florida? That's premise article. I'm arguing REAL lockdown China, specifically around Wuhan. UK's 'lockdown' strangled virus, sure lowered bit cases resume.......and sometimes escalate, like CA NY. Yeah that's common sense approach, we've year's worth data support Florida's decision

You realize even whole US Florida's numbers, US would still one worst hit countries, right? delusion Florida good numbers? also ignores reality states affected equally - ones like NY CA much harder hit lockdowns reason.

The common sense approach would take stringent measures quickly far shorter period time employing social nets ensure people looked lockdown. results (both terms economic recovery COVID cases/deaths) countries like China New Zealand point common sense approach. 6 kids die school busses year, ok? 6 threshold care 6 kids important?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Stop trying justify death. facts back rumor know live here. hadn’t locked hospitals would overrun - like South Dakota. New Yorkers, hospital collapse unacceptable us. august. Almost school districts front numbers. Thats state didn’t need mandate it. lockdowns SEEMED worked China mean would worked US, Italy, Spain, France, UK, India, etc.

No idea mean 'seemed'. Lockdowns clearly worked places. Go take look daily case count UK dates lockdown marked. Cases fell three lockdowns. proper lockdown see effect. This.

It’s hard understand many people don’t want airport fly hours people may may positive. people spend whole flight munching pretzel taking tiny sips avoid wearing mask flight. 

It’s activities you’re around people....uncontrolled spread good economy people avoid certain activities. 

This would build confidence. less developed countries rapid tests awhile now. USA...where cdc got around mandating masks public transport local, state, bus, train, airline patchwork rules (and weak enforcement).   basically I’m seeing shutdowns aren’t effective people need make money? want kiddos stay remote learning vaccines readily available. else done? know U.S, Canada, deaths age 14 flu 2019 covid deaths age range. So, one article mean much. US never locked down. Half ass count. US also gets F human rights abroad Ugh, nerve pain. really something else. Nah poor cases rise people getting either one vaccines shortly passing away we're left ""currently investigating."" I'll leave y'all this, raise PH certain foods drinks, dunno top head... look 

Completely unsourced content. one wants spread alarm, person (minimally) provide data support supposition. Also, realise vaccine made scientists Oxford University? Oxford literally ranks best university world. I’d highly doubt they’d produce “subpar” vaccine. lockdowns draconian possible nation, even Germany.

China major economy grew 2021. also far less cases/deaths even Florida. no, metrics set forth DeSantis, lockdowns actually work.

Also, beyond isolated reports people locked Wuhan, even reports happening major cities like Beijing Shanghai? certainly support former, draconian measures taken cities? New Zealand, Australia even Finland? Everything said true. There’s probably ton overlap people go outside planned parenthoods harass everyone goes can’t say I’m surprised Generally, expect medical professionals actually understand reality medical science.

Kinda like expect bus driver know drive.

If wanna go life feeling superior ignorance, that's prerogative. medical professionals they're making people's health well-being responsibility, luxury caring understand medicine actually functions. Wait till kids tell dies. wonder change perspective. Never heard flu killing obese kids, get grip bud.  Profit? They’re massive private pharmaceutical companies handled whole process research manufacturing. 

The Oxford AstraZeneva vaccine collaboration, Oxford University basically brain (they research developed vaccine) AstraZeneca executor sense make vaccine massive scale manufacturing sites logistical work acquiring raw materials etc. 

Oxford University beginning looking partner pharmaceutical company insisted vaccine wasn’t going sold profit since wanted help world end pandemic &amp; advance science, line rich CEO’s pockets. AstraZeneca agreed immense exposure would get suppose. parents nurses. abject repulsion needles going skin would one, too. still scary consider people believe science desire care others, administrators willing hire staff believe science. Yes, since ACA less US. I'm sure specifics, think lowest end pay less 10 euro per month. average middle-class acquaintance group 120 per month. 

Most regular care covered 100%, go see regular doctor pay cent, even deductible reached. bill I've ever pay deductible back surgery - €170. 

Even without insurance, costs miniscule compared US. first six months here, health insurance pay 100% prescription medications. pharmacist would always apologize exorbitant cost. idea still paying slightly LESS *with* prescription coverage US $380/month premium.

I issue months ago required visit GP, referrals urology gynecology, tests, scans, small surgery, overnight stay. know paid it? Nothing. €120/month premium covered all.

My mom UTI last month paid $300 test. spends 30% monthly income health insurance. Put antivaxxers back line chance want mine exactly reason SARS easy eliminate, unlike SARS-Cov2. entire section travel restrictions, nothing lockdowns topic post, travel restrictions minor element of. 


Of course travel restrictions going delay viral spread, virus sneaks new country/state/town cases take exponentially. Lockdowns prevent take keeping R value 1 thus prevent cases deaths. backfire people eventually give nothing improves. really bothers Americans satisfied healthcare, see clearly. wondering *why*? people live 3-mile radius apartment entire nation. Sickness, stress, diseases impact sperm quality well. sure news. Even alcohol smoking affect sperm quality see anyone worrying that. Florida A-grade data quality graded B.

Facts only, please. vague claims. wish fuckin GOP could distribute vaccine efficiently could fuckin virus itself. 600 kids enough. Imagine pain parents, nurses have. even know, adequate testing all? 

They full shit anyone half brain knows this. Oh lawsuits. nearly alarming headline makes be. comments experts (which appear end linked page):

""It well-known fact acute state stress like viral infections lead decline fertility parameters like sperm counts/quality well decline environment nurtures sperm. case COVID-19 infection, treatments (steroids, antivirals, etc.) also compromise fertility parameters. Plus, sheer mental stress comes diagnosis also contribute decline fertility parameters.""

""Thus, data intriguing, several flaws study impact data’s value. Therefore, data interpreted extreme caution time appropriate control group studied."" think everyone getting better vaccines. prioritize creation distribution best do? everyone? seriously hate talk less likely, still pretty good. long covid? spreading someone can’t get vaccinated? Objectively Sorry, 'a friend friend says actually data wrong' cut anymore. get that, regardless speak doctor. Cramps post-menopausal women cause concern. want say ""hey yeah could happen"" OP ignores uterine cancer. ........ fucking useless article.
Who thought second vaccine would make virus spread? Hell maybe even spring point this? sitting thread catastrophizing you? Go eff yourself, covid. Sincerely, vaccinated healthcare worker. Time start opening things back normal couple months don’t think so. aggressive swab sometimes bleeding isn’t uncommon. Everyone lied fed wolves. 

Good luck would even add this. articles assume J&amp;J Novavax vaccines would efficacy Pfizer Moderna. simply true. 

J&amp;J Novavax Vector vaccines. Oxford/Astra Zeneca. Moderna Pfizer mRNA vaccines. period time mRNA trials, Oxford vaccine overall efficacy around 62% 70% so. fact J&amp;J Novavax similar efficacies expected. immune system doesn’t create response viral RNA, also creates immune response adeno virus used vector. 

I think lowered efficacy everything vaccine type less variant. antibody titers mRNA vaccines seems substantially robust viral vector ones. 

Additionally, Moderna Pfizer done vitro tests variants shown substantial neutralizing activity them. I'll forward request Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. know happened regardless.

Look South Dakota, people freaking couple months ago.

The governor budge. lockdowns.

Covid peaked, done lockdown point November, exact non-lockdown-related fall would used people like show that: ""LoCkDoWnS wOrK"" Probably nothing.

Most people notice lungs get shredded. people long term symptoms noticed breath minimum. 

90+ percent long haulers lot sniffle. completely lost sense smell taste pretty sick several days least. number people asymptomatic devastating long term effects minimal. Manslaughter.  Yah wear mask. Probably weather/allergies honesty.

Some us chronic sinus issues would never leave house 😂😂 calling anti-vaxxers?

They're pro-COVID. people lost homes, careers, loved ones. Let's pretend everyone's covid struggle equal. Covid us forever, Smallpox strains Polio ever completely eradicated Earth. Pandemic's forever. You’re winning prizes postponing either! I'm 14 well say, Sometimes take step back leap forward. That's AMAZING. nursing homes absolutely destroyed covid. I'm sure death toll now, "" (city name))Soldiers Home"" death toll 100 May 2020. Please change title to: Kids playing hockey. Here’s wear two masks would never suggest lockdown. don’t really work. need discourage people parties indoors, especially ones lots yelling drinking. 

I’m anti-lockdown, don’t freak virus wipe everything down, bug don’t go inside others houses fine indoors. somewhat concerned new variants. 

Given fact amount days person getting infected symptoms long, fact new variants better attach ACE2 receptors, it’s impossible think there’s evolutionary pressure become less fatal. infect many others severely harming killing host, easily transfer animals humans. favorite Dick Pound ""the Olympians need get vaccine first!"" Yeah, buddy. 600 kids died covid population 72 million. Lets keep things perspective. would NEVER considered China done gleefully released images footage world.

Now we're China. certain level anxiety life normal

but there's point people abnormal levels anxiety even ""normal"" situations

this called anxiety disorder. Generalized Anxiety Disorder, exact. article talking about. Check state laws. may need permission. Maybe also don’t know enough vaccine rule could rare reaction. got downvoted sharing friend’s experience reacted vaccine rash whole arm black blue vaccine week half out. It’s going 3 weeks arm better; one knows caused everyone like idk guess it’s vaccine. don’t know enough rule isn’t.  Proper lockdowns work every time. UK three every one caused cases fall, even barely-locked one autumn schools workplaces still completely open. 

If lockdown working really locked all. mean worse lockdown schools workplaces still open, wth doing? No, clearly troll political motives I'm sick people. Can't even debate anyone complete absolute BAD FAITH. Humanity screwed something politically motivated disinformation ""spin"".  So, Pfizer Moderna done same? mRNA vaccines Moderna Pfizer theoretically easiest tweak since basically plug play mRNA sequence protein wish target. Especially minor change. absolute bottom heart...Fuck people. That’s needs said. believe China, Feb-April lockdowns, everything closed leave house. THAT'S lockdown. Anything less enough move needle - See CA NY.  Let's finish this. Dont feed troll.

Check /u/overshootdieoff’s post history. corona fearmongering. Literally nothing else.  told since vaccine isn’t sterilizing vaccine exactly 0 impact infection. 

Hell, told, quote, I’m “just making guesses” saying person who’s asymptomatically infectious day two less contagious someone who’s asymptomatically infectious two weeks. Hungary also ordered  1 million russian 2,5 million chinese vaccine (well actually twice much since 2 dose vaccines easier say like ) soon well too! (as long dont care proper documentation...) entire administration fuck “urging patience”
They urging bullshit 3 months, anything speed one thing end it, Germany vaccinated barley 3% it’s travesty Feel like I've seen variants article posted 20 times past week Meh. talking welfare population think posturing involved. feel exact way. It’s indescribable anxiety. hope get relief soon! Privacy laws non-compliance reasons. definitely bar hopping St Patrick’s day, part reducing infections, spread variants, opportunity mutations, hopefully things get better us year progresses. Happened husband. 28 years old, shingles forehead. Doctor said ‘you’ll fine.’ Two days later, shingles eye. Scary stuff. lot time hospitals. dare concerned something they're going put body. Burn heathens! median age California lower Florida. Given age strongest correlation mortality, perhaps effect, too. I'm saying Florida better; pointed out, could implemented sensible mask policies, least firmly certain areas. main point contention seem like there's strong case make 'shutdown' approach. Improvements, sure, data not, me, suggest heavy shutdown would worth it. Even grocery stores UK open.

Grocery stores essential services never closed countries lockdowns, what's point?  virus spread least long one symptomatic. Therefore, die symptomatic phase disease, serves evolutionary detriment. yes, absolutely selection pressure acting mortality. don’t get. Like, get it’s hard everyone isolated loved ones. vaccines way. can’t skip ONE Christmas together sake protecting health?  Doubt it, that's feasible. go 6 month+ trial every time mutates, never get anything done, time trial end, new mutation found.  Running low stock really risky approach. right approach. single shot provides significant protection, theoretical reason second shot would less effective given 2 months first one instead 1 month. fact, reason believe opposite given knowledge immune response vaccines. 

The 28 day second-shot window believed sweet spot efficacy. consciously selected maximize speed trials (if waited 3 months second dose, that's two months finishing trials else equal - potentially *per stage*). 

In fact, 28 days really floor... previous vaccine studies multi-shot regimens show significant decline efficacy boosts given early. 

Within reason, theoretical reason believe getting second dose 2 3 months first materially change efficacy boost second dose. hogging doses warehouses rather getting people's arms *does* - former difference 70% efficacy 95% efficacy couple months; latter difference 0% 70% efficacy time period plus extra month. really depends particular locale. many hotzones SoCal infection still running rampant, much prevalence multi-generational households sharing house apartment. There's really safe way kids teachers go back class kind widespread uncontrolled spread. rural suburban districts totally doable schools willing distance kids regular testing. 

Regular weekly testing goes long way stomping cases infect whole class. Many college campuses require weekly testing positivity rate fairly low. example, UCLA campus-wide testing students, faculty &amp; staff positivity minuscule now... like 0.5%, compared Los Angeles County hovering around 12%. Tell Manaus. I'm health worker, definitely going go get vaccine I'm offered (fingers crossed might get first one next week), colleague that's pregnant able get it. also one severe allergy bit hesitant take reports bad reactions people like her. reasons understand accept. I'll take mine hope enough take cover since can't. 
People spouting vaccines causing autism rearrange DNA? Hell no. problem co-ordination states. International travel US barred countries US shut land border. anything virus already US people freely travel states varying restrictions though. listed bunch things even discussed. 

First off: rapid tests expensive. per unit cost rapid test $18 wholesale prices. consider expensive doubt would flying.

Second: mandatory quarantine proposed part testing. testing part whether people allowed board flight. test positive flying. happy you! It’ll little easier keep going. mean agree - it’s something think about. partially think try drag long. Vaccinate quickly possible open. diseases play wonder end Super Flu resistant bacteria. Right, especially long COVID care free anyway. wrote it, thought insurances likely pathway. life, disability insurance particular. hope someone answer I'm curious: virus become seasonal remain us forever? eventually become similar seasonal flu vaccines now? gross dishonest

Right, what's uneasy China Australia did? Add New Zealand Finland list. COVID-19 spreads long host dies (often even develop symptoms), evolutionary pressure become less deadly. presence people disagree != astroturfing. looking echo chamber confirm already held opinions, perhaps look elsewhere. US 50M people 75 years represent 80% Covid deaths. We'll probably see deaths decrease hundred per day late February. Okay thanks. Sorry badly want everyone unhappy healthcare yours, indeed satisfied theirs. Apparently not. Thank god adults back charge. I’m flying till I’m fully vaccinated. I’m actually big consumer household ample expendable income. math 2020 spent least 7K less 2019. 

People forget it’s things shut down. Consumer confidence drives discretionary spending. family pretty much bubbled in-laws continue part kids life. 

No get plane take frivolous trips. may issue May June right enough people want vaccinated. Vaccination appointments near book minutes Okay mean pedantic (actually do), exponential growth specific meaning. mean ""grows really fast."" good [vaccine administration fast accelerating, means exponential growth. sure hope not. pretty redundant wasting precious time. get extra 2-3 hours per day please happily WFH forever can. yes, would nice go museum again, movie, festival anywhere. 23th? sucks could worse. Could 24nd reports people locked homes outside Wuhan? Beijing Shanghai work US? group B leave home vaccinated? point yes, winter. keep catching shooting blanks, wear mask. would virus want become lethal? kills host, dies along host. Viruses' primary evolutionary incentive maximize infectiousness. Morbidity merely byproduct goal, virus also incentivized mitigate byproduct. Sure, EU definitely plays part vaccination struggles, Denmark vaccinated 3x Netherlands. Iceland 4x, Germany 2x.

I think statistical advantage reduces number infections (which reduces number opportunities virus replicate therefore mutate) outweighs theoretical risk social distancing. virus can’t mutate spread people never meet. COVID influenza virus.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* know lot people view California’s lockdown one stricter ones, feel like really isn’t.

Thinking travel alone- California really doesn’t restrictions. counties imposed quarantine upon arrival, say won’t enforcing it. Comparing states make test entering couple days (and actually check quarantine), don’t see people consider California one stricter states regards locking act incomplete data. One theory saw maybe people get mild asymptomatic reinfection notice, transmit someone never it. disappointing part i’m surprised people anymore. heartbreaking  Unless proof UK funded BioNTech production capacity point talking further. made assertion can't back simply true. Paying doses funding production capacity. Australia we’ve pretty much since day one. I’m surprised it’s taken year countries listen experts &amp; realise actually works (we’ve hit 25 days without single CV case country; thanks &amp; simple measures prevent spread). Astroturf? Please seek help. Problem think ""victory"" open doors others sites.  isn’t protest. endangerment. Lock up. bad entire planet won’t receive vaccines mutates.... wiping chance current vaccines working.   end game folks pay well? get this? hoping failure vaccine? know peoples whose entire families fortunate enough get it, others 0 able get it. think makes sense one breadwinners house vaccinated able take care things bring income rest household, still maintaining social distancing mask wearing about. It’s perfect it’s thought. Also, maybe could explain thought dumb instead saying so. Pfizer Moderna vaccines 50% effective new strains bode well third world stuck less effective vaccines. like Biden's gonna go ""Hold jack got 150 million 10 days left, stop vaccinating right said 150 million"" all, it’s “champing” bit. Horses champ.  il sit wait pfizer moderna. fuck J&amp;J Again, please stop lying. true. 

If government covered portion employee pay, many countries still are, businesses would lay people off. Furthermore, people would money continue spending closer pre-COVID would give businesses increased revenue, meaning they'd less likely lay people off. 

The businesses laid people enough money. 

If, ""low"" paid retail/restaurant workers, government paid 50% - 75% wages, businesses would lay people would gone business. 

Instead laying people using last business's savings pay rent/lease/mortgage utilities, government could paused bills and/or covered payments. 

Damn near every country world enacted types assistance. 

And gosh golly go figure [that actually worked Lol guy keeps lying well run AZ trial is. Thats pretended MHRA encouraged wrong dosing clinical trial!

They didn't. sources admitted MISTAKE.

This trying flip story one caught repeating AZ's PR spiels trying change topic away obvious propaganda. Slow roll there, partner. ""The striking aspect many molecular pathways impacted virus,"" says Andrew Emili, another study's senior investigators, director BU's CNSB, specializes proteomics deep sequencing molecular interactions. ""The virus wholesale remodeling lung cells—it's amazing degree virus commandeers cells infects."" Yeah would goal already responded link, apply. think dropping tear gas place full seniors line get vaccine would good idea anyways quoting experts. quoting AZ's side story. literally article's headline alone pretending AZ's side actual legal expert opinions sides instead obvious troll article linked opinion law professor who, guardian post confirms, says unclear. Either way, there's clear present argument need use UK plants first shipments. still makes older subreddit There's immunity... now. mutates hits everyone again, vaccines eventually anything virus grows spreads.

I completely believe thing came lab, occur naturally wet market. far strong finding ways survive, grow, mutant resist. Eventually vaccine able stop it. believe western vaccines backlog can't fill request, really choice. would've anyway That's giving up, that's realizing life works. like 17 something? people saying COVID gives people heart issues. 

Well way think. Yes vaccinate country entire world prevent mutations. government month probably: 
See turns guys didn’t need 2k uh mean 1400, anyways get back work! #we’reinthistogether Yes it’s extreme, think lot treated extremely poorly. GF med student go clinic won’t give PPE, haven’t notified she’s contact COVID-positive patients, even test positive COVID you’ll get points docked showing clinic...I would rather healthcare workers strike get needlessly killed administrators want save buck

Extreme circumstances call extreme measures. KTV girls essential understanding China. go white people again...
Give shot whatever race want. don’t care. stop nonsensical bitching ramp manufacturing distribution meet demand, we’ll well way conquering it, everyone gets vaccinated pretty safe. We’re getting folks. Ideally sooner get there.  quoting experts. quoting AZ's side story. literally article's headline alone pretending AZ's side correct.

Here actual legal expert opinions sides instead obvious troll  bring weight ""reason"" covid killed kid. Children's weights like adults, daughter overweight borderline obese nine ten hit huge growth spurt. diet change, grew half foot taller 13.
It's really sad look picture think answers someone died instead going... could child, niece, nephew, etc. want ""blame"" something yet stories trying scream ""for heaven's sake virus awful!""
Instead listening cover ears ignore.
Yes kids die flu every year. doctors beg us flu shots help. flu.. almost half million Americans, obese old, dead needs remind us susceptibility new virus help us keep guards up. Terrorists politics sub, completely disagree, many polices bad-to-evil.

With respect pandemic, *only* thing truly right heavily funding research/vaccines. Bill Gates praised aspect response whole times. Get gas lock shit up. phenomenal news, congratulations! wish news would stop doom gloom, “worse yet come” stuff :/ Moderna Pfizer hit production capacity past weeks totaling 9m (combined) per week. sure going get 14m let alone 17.5m+ would get 2.5m+ per day without significant change production. Actually know yet, officially. plenty people waiting shot. Stop jerking around maybe we’ll get 80% mark. said first think seasonal. larger factor people immunity gone. saw graphic bubble thing &amp; really easy bubble really bubble depends behaviours everyone else bubble, too. 5 people bubble even 1 adhering precautions, bubble basically popped right there. probably see lot people roommate situations one may essential worker &amp; exposed others, exposure risk carry bubble.  rights important letting 400k die it? July/August/September sending troops why?  Im sure mutations evere fully evade vaccines. mRNA vaccines specifically target spike protein, it'd take virus seriously shift way infects body evade vaccines. Possible? Yes, seems unlikely. Time tell suppose. find nottthing duh Ugh I’m sorry hear that. I’m experience lists total BS. don’t know anyone signed list received call turn. What’s zip code / City maybe help find something them. bewildering amusing. much ""tweaking"" done vaccine put retesting ensure safety? Interesting! Good know. definitely fun, high anxiety pushes continue risk it. bit envious brain able let take risk without ruining time

Luckily rest life. bit longer get vaccinated Pennsylvania. I've signed numerous lists checked local pharmacies daily 2 weeks far, thing we've heard back appointment offered March arent predictions straight math, like 2016 election I'm NC. Went pickup order. free table place. space tables. thing governor implemented masks stores (many people follow still quite don't) 10pm curfew.
Yeah going back ""normal"" Agreed.

RemindMe! 4 weeks Well one 600 kids died covid 15x many deaths. two, lot people pretty fucking outraged gun deaths too. Ignorant comment ""mostly peaceful protests,"" probably. line hallmark emotional manipulation still extremely low risk children. think people forced starve death appearances? LIKE SHOT 💉 easy tell, mass vaccination impact lot spreading virus thus making mutations less likely outraged gun violence listening?!? thank kindly promptly proving point. say latest fall it’s highly plausible it’s line hallmark emotional manipulation still extremely low risk children. 

Speed limit 5mph unless want people die. Tell thousands parents lost children car accidents think otherwise. enough doses? part 3rd world spend hundreds millions set AZ manufacturing. India, China did, African Union could theory. people lost jobs direct result shutdown result government providing assistance. true. restaurants told shut down, lot fired furloughed waiters need them. nothing government providing assistance. Get mental health treatment tho  read garbage subreddit? early wave states ZERO idea treat COVID. really fair compare later states treatment regimens known better. northeast flying blind, course going deaths.

The later states WAY fewer excuses. FL disaster summer. Yeah, I'd like many people understand virus happen *virus*. like calculator chooses what's mathematically statistically best. virus turn less deadly? Yes. keep spreading? mass vaccination, no. Almost 500k Americans total people still care 
One child many child different today?

I flew 9-11 can't really recall people less professional. less layers BS could go security even flying day. obscure post gets seventeen votes get 19 thread gets deleted. Sure. member troll farm Booooo go, experts? haha ah get meant now. Use moderation opposed using without moderation lol. True One year late actually learn anything. Cheers DeSantis shown work nearly well committing genocide constituents. Healthcare workers striking would incredibly, incredibly dangerous. lot problems situation terms patient lives would worst time strike. UK, Brazil South Africa. Dang, can't bear  news, wastes time Nice tourism tour pandemic, hope enjoyed it. moderate vast majority business owners.

In specific sectors. small business record year. surely seem less severe. claim viruses eventually evolve less deadly misinformation disingenuous. Sars-CoV2 evolves 100 years now? Surely. variant appears next month? granted to. 

Virus mutate out. Herd immunity achieves that. Virus replicates, copies different original, not. Sars-CoV2 also features copy control genome even RNA, limits mutations *literally* no-one nothing 

\*Looks Australia NZ\*

That's *literally* true.

Frankly think countries time makes sense given manufacturing limitations. vaccine putting pressure virus mutate it, lot spread country large number vaccinated people create risk resistant strand emerge spread. make sure significant get lasik good go. Doubtful, likely never.

The virus already mutating resisting vaccines. going end us.  harsh may sound takes pandemic cause people depression really toughen up. quite alarming, never expecting high. Agree Besides vaccines big factor, forget spreading disease holidays month behind us. see mentioned article. reliable source claim? That’s incorrect. put updated statement today. Maybe? reason believe decision unique school much different compared families I’ve talked to. two hours synchronous (live zoom) make time asynchronous lessons (online software assignments). next county over, 1st grader online zoom 4th grader. conversation teacher justification didn’t believe parents would work kids. know district gave parameters individual schools freedom chose meet parameters. 

Most energy goes getting 6 year old son 4 hours zoom assignments time it’s over, little patience strength anything else. hard time 2 hour zoom lecture 38, empathize him. poor guy really struggling. are. completely unsurprising lie quote part refer financial assistance get. 

The jobs lost lockdown, jobs lost government provide financial assistance. 

Please stop lying, pathetic cowardly.  It’s actually not. children public school every child wears mask 100 % time spent eating. Kids good wearing masks alternative. 5 year old wears mask 6 hours day. you’re kid can’t keep mask get learn laptop instead.  It’s impressive able little month, especially considering slow first weeks were. things continue current daily average might able reach 25% March Yeah could build system track charge transmit survive long term human... could buy yacht. Blocking traffic? Arrest asses, what’s argue?  honestly don’t know  Better overperform underdeliver. trump's ""this gone easter"" procolomation work out? Cries Third World   “Digital tracking!!!”

*proceeds use smartphone post social media* 

These people just...I cannot. Bored guess. could science-based fact simple definition go science? know people fed protesting
 guys definitely went line. benefit from, preventing people vaccinate? keeping people life saving vaccine. want one one thing. endangering lives someone got turned away today could die. 

They need shot arrested charged attempted homicide. Maskless normal? I'd say Autumn latest although think genuinely possible could like say sometime summer. blatantly go science. There’s plenty experts lied political reasons this. It’s treason then. Well fuck I’d hope  Calm never said going take wonderinh side effects might experience. Valid question way.. body, choice!! That's accurate. Per COVID Act Now, FL higher positivity rate lower ICU capacity NY/NJ. case rate slightly lower, based positivity rate, testing many people. 

Per CDC website, per capita deaths right approximately (FL raw numbers higher). FL also higher raw new case count, lower per capita (although based positivity rate, NY/NJ testing per capita too).

So no, FL better northeast, despite great weather outdoor activities virus spreads less. Someone spur on. quite complicated time consuming set factory. matter finding building that's it. takes months set factory. quickest scenario really getting pharmaceutical companies start manufacturing pfizer/moderna vaccines starting happen like Sanofi making pfizer vaccines think summer IIRC. Presumably already facilities place much terms setting up. 

Now terms get pharmaceutical companies Australia/South Korea etc manufacture pfizer/moderna. Well one every pharmaceutical company facilities develop mRNA vaccines secondly also whether companies would even happy develop vaccines. 

I also imagine location plays factor. Ideally want factory serve multiple countries cost effective reasons. Australia atleast located quite far away rest world base location also far certain countries etc. waking dealing wih reality.

Not another sarastic butthole internet. Ayah think real headline states: 50 million doses 95 percent efficacy distributed, 30 million 95 percent efficacy administered. Coming soon, tens millions 60 percent efficacy. I’m outraged, posted article. wanted gain visibility. seem dismissing “nonsense thing” fodder-drama random social justice warrior. 

I troll. I’m focused different part article. seem offended race headline. Particularly “white.” get that. isn’t that. program breaking - happening result. hope took photos protestors prosecute negligent endangerment national health crisis. It’s sham investigation. There’s blind prejudice - history China allowing outside investigations. depends vaccine long... safe. going hardly able get contracted shot promises everyone now. milk 5 shot vials 6. opened one regions could contract vaccines region really global stomp virus. would bet could get government funding pay bunch building countries would low cost. Pretty fucked up, considering worse may potentially get soon.... reality Americans never going truly lock month two. Relying lockdowns long term never going viable solution it’s one thing, it’s other. JFC However. need now. setting tragic, longer plays out. Stay safe.  guards administrative personnel get infected fly back mainland thus keeping Covid ball play. Brilliant. Wouldn’t amount previously infected also major contributor slow? really need shut airports down, mandate testing negative tests along strict enforcement masks ppe. Like everything US done never done properly. Airports stayed open people literally die covid planes. ""lockdowns"" happen gyms declared necessary. Zero financial assistance whatsoever average person business allow lockdown effective.

We've tried nothing we're ideas. people say ""lockdowns work"" I'd argue never first place.  ""Staying home loving partner,"" lot easier deal ""forcefully separated months possibly years"" ""single opportunities meet people outside dating apps, terrible covid."" that's want believe, could ask, simple facts definitions stated experts considered misinformation lies? think anecdote nice hear it’s less likely spinned. story could totally made totally true. Either way provides little light stark news injured walked bar?  outraged politicians charge? That's get. can't tell trolling really believe typical cnn crap. black, asian, middle eastern, indian, also got vax location NY? white people latino involved? Please way end less!

I one appreciate excavation buried lead neatly laid out. Gives time snark. You’re looking correlation = causation. It’s public attitude, business closures. People California / northeast likely take precautions general, inside outside businesses. point, don’t take precautions seriously, hang houses apartments. Texas Florida lot people. state (MA, USA), numbers gone UP. 

People assume whatever want even getting vaccinated, vaccine exists. insane. remind people 2 doses takes time vaccine starts working. worse, vaccine generally available April. 2 months away. Yet today, 3,5000 new cases!

I know water supply, whatever multiplying stupid, growing exponentially. Poor journalism, they’re guilty it. Happens don’t experts reporting. wants them? You? like answer best.  going take doctors scientists years understand going lunatics brains unfortunately actual survival rate even lower that, even possible people ages die. Thank contributions please refrain claiming credential without verified. interested, send message via mod mail get set up. frontliners tax paying citizens? get jab last line. “The end game stop death, stop hospitals going crisis - vaccines, even including South African variant, seem substantially,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, infectious disease expert Johns Hopkins Center Health Security

Vaccines tweaked necessary future. we're dealing now, eliminate hospitalizations deaths, majority severe disease. heard went haywire NN households even running water. travel haul water. middle pandemic! put vaccines taken cold, back cold environment keep chilled? ruin vaccine? US zero lockdowns, anywhere. literally entire pandemic wanted could fly basically anywhere back maybe ""had"" ""quarantine"" meant... Uh... Nothing National Guards actually managed state level, several engaged distributing vaccine. 

Centralizing distribution vaccine uneven supply multiple varieties, couple strict refrigeration requirements, across large country off-shore states territories would difficult accomplish centrally without significant planning pre-existing infrastructure. ‘last mile’ problem would really rear ugly head here. 

Also, there’s significant reason believe citizens would respond negatively proposition ‘the US Government giving everyone vaccine.’ 

Decentralized distribution seems like best choice problem. clearly never flew 2001 Looks like AstraZeneca provide undiluted vaccine diluted bottled locally. medical help one services. care others, ventilator Science mic-drop. believe made first vaccines 9 months?

Just bit longer, keep masking properly, keep isolating, let almost there. Could making bet time would take, worth either financially terms logistics. Florida's numbers trusted. Huge controversies around data provided possibility manipulation political purposes. De Santis snake agenda clearly making bad faith arguments. Indeed, anything reported? gains necessary visibility enact positive overall change. kid past went school influenza season, understand necessary risk. 

My question, philosophically speaking, draw line? many ultimately preventable deaths many?

Edit: apparently it’s ~150. Right, let antimasker infect everybody else.  Wonder toured jewelry stores buy stuff. Vitamin D3 .. need click point - Saudi Arabia linked reopening country receiving supply vaccines ramping vaccination program. doses delayed due EU export ban supply issues Pfizer AZD, they've pushed back reopening two whole months since they're going behind vaccination program.  Current Believed Genre Universe Sol: Sim City. 
Evidence: Headlines look like made developers parody headlines. People downvoted me, humorous side. OK that?   reason vaccination center set community start with: begin address heartbreaking disparity NY minority group’s susceptibility Covid-19. optimistic, think Americans become healthier.  DeSantis cooking state books since beginning like Cumo nursing home deaths? article *don't* want healthcare change.

Again, bother much? Who’s “we” doesn’t care OK that?  “facts” getting deleted temp-banned moderators here, misinformation lies. Same. changed me. I'm really struggling reality BEST CASE keep months. can't anymore. know also played much larger factor? Coronavirus. still nearly impossible anyone know get it. didn’t think Fox News showcasing covid reports way takes virus seriously. Yea, you’re objecting keeps shifting. I’m one debate sake - flaw mine drives loved ones bananas, please accept apologies engaging further. 

I mainly took issue initial flippant categorization post disingenuous race baiting nonsense. I’m glad agree issue shouldn’t casually noted dismissed; issue, it’s complexities, indeed, merit thoughtful regard. Cheers. Man nice feds actually sensible things. course will. start pumping vaccines substantially lower number deaths. Especially risk populations. Yeah, last. Able name 5 policy failures? deaths simply measured number people died 28 days within infection. means death values (which lockdowns based of) unreliable overinflated. Exactly come back to? I’m getting mad press pulling stops crush one thing placing hopes getting lives back! feel unsettled lol. Thanks! Let's look Australia New Zealand... still cases despite middle nowhere checking people coming in. 

That's mutations work, happen randomly, happen time there's nothing stop happening. Every single person infected another couple rolls dice regarding existence new possibly really bad mutation. thing monitor situation closely stop spreading. mean came forcibly inject vaccine? Also let's brand em know crazy got taken care still need vaccinate. #fucktheirights Anti maskers same. dont want wear mask freedom harass anyone wearing mask. 

You free want do. “24nd” broke brain    Probably covid lands certain men hospital. Greedy stupid solution fight becomes endemic. live covid long doesn’t cripple society. never fully eradicated. still regularly deal Spanish flu.

The phenomenon humans eradicating disease rare practically myth. think we’ve literally eradicated like two.  say anything f up. scary part studied let loose wild gain function mutations behaves follow path viruses/SARS pointing Chinese made. thoughts seen worst we've turned corner. Covid may linger anything like experienced last 6-9 months. We're likely get majority population vaccinated summer / June things go right back its' sender.  Another fucking year mental health would completely destroyed   ways. Don’t misleading write real virus dangers prove little rhetorical sentence correct. amazon workers may die, sacrifice I’m willing make.

Believe think amazon workers condemned death. vaccinated? get proper PPE vaccinations see issue...but seems like teachers treated like...teachers generally getting shafted terms PPE vaccinations. Also, state? qualification process micro chip long first revision. modify portion need qualify certify silicon entire set tests. suppose could save time well mild change vaccin. people life stake sure take shortcut Somehow county live hasn’t gotten memo receiving distributing vaccines kind efficient manner. skipped 17 nursing homes Phase 1, moved phase 2, told nursing homes they’d “wait turn” needed provide transportation residents get vaccinated, instead someone coming facility vaccinate residents. Took several people couple newspaper reporters even get looked it’s resolved yet! name single company besides Amazon?

There two reasons many companies invest nationwide infrastructure could support distribution vaccine scale needed quickly end global pandemic. 

1.	Pandemics don’t happen often
2.	This infrastructure incredibly expensive understand long part vaccine development testing trials. much tweaking done new phase 3 trial needed? might true Texas, I’m sorry hear that. case Wi. kids went back hybrid reporting positives quarantined. ive seen similar reporting schools well. lived FL college. summer everyone goes inside air conditioning hot (plus rain). reason entire sunbelt outbreak then. There's reason Miami built retractable domed stadium baseball.

Here's comp chart pulled. look cases deaths across time: COVID Act Now: point is, FL objectively better plenty metrics, worse (% positivity, ICU capacity, raw case counts deaths).  That’s goals work internally company. political leader can’t make 15 million extra doses appear. timeline ramp manufacturing huge. haven’t publicly heard they’ve found way doesn’t mean aren’t working manufacturing issues.

Biden restore confidence federal government. Specifically we’ll meet exceed targets set. Like 100 million set seemed ambitious told everyone ground get 1 million day. (even took office help) pushes next goal. he’ll get 150 doesn’t mean they’ll stop they’ll still try stretch aren’t going announce stretch goal line public. New Mexico closed grocery stores months gay? Oh yeah deny service them. wearing mask? Nope. serve them. world considered sensible decision. view clearly true, even obviously insensitive.

Forgive person.

That’s big brain shit. Huh? Honestly heard thought reliable source, fact check it. Can't find anything either. Fuck. Feels weird side aisle sudden. Sorry

(I told Czech republic halting vaccinations nerve damage non trivial amount cases, guess BS, bad)  Get competent, national private sector companies involved. buy vaccines government skin game. every completed vaccination, get rewarded handsomely fee.  said were? It’s coming. mRNA vaccine breakthrough affect every vaccination given. pack multiple types mRNA strands lipid carrier particles used Pfizer Moderna. Theoretically limit number different protein targets could engineer single carrier packet. breakthrough go one greatest scientific achievements time. holy grail vaccine science universal flu vaccine absolutely possible mRNA technology. One shot could produce every target protein studding surfaces every pathogenic virus, cancer, bacteria, etc. big deal.

This replicated countries. 

If go Singapore, done everywhere.

Like think cleaning door knobs stop 6 feet enough distancing. may sound arbitrary count? mean could see pandemic like fund much possible? sore arm &amp; mild fever next Morning, 4pm felt like million bucks. 

I know it’s little unsettling knowing gonna feel good keep mind gets one step closer able kiss homies again. appreciate devils advocate ironically would kinda help us accelerates herd immunity. also, travel probably advanced you’d think Spanish flu. we’ve 3 big ones blips history like one be. point still stands tall. facts question? great news. two Sisters children MD's. got first vacination jab. stay safe. 12? kids don’t need daycare. 

Statistically drive campground likely kill them.  claim AZ kind unfounded. Multiple countries using widely there’s really reason think U.S. trial resemble others.  

AZ enough buyers unclear particular urgency rush US given supply constraints. got approval Europe Philippines week probably Brazil next week.  Despite Americans believe markets plenty big lots published like deriding UK trial seems US trial probably read end February. still early enough get doses March probably still enormous demand then.  

AZ reason rush given they’ve got EMA approval still likely make market U.S.. use protesting racial justice. It’s easy someone demand bars, restaurants, events shut never left home Covid anyways teachers may die, sacrifice willing make. Taxes cut tariffs up. We're still Iraq Warp Speed way slow. wasnt Pfizer Moderna hard work we'd trouble. Trump even tried take credit vaccine. called hoax longest time. stuff serves hinder team. last person tried sell essential oils (even lost popularity) nurse, RN. said made total scientific sense suggested might even ""help cancer."" 

Don't know supposed mean care. original comment arguing lockdowns worse locking disagreed. Whether able eradicate - favour lockdowns. Australia's initial aim March locked flatten curve, eradicate. course understand differences us landlocked Europe Italy Spain used lockdowns great effect. Whatever country, lockdowns work, support them, that's replying opinion. entirely possible likely we'll get variants reduce efficiency vaccines. think South african/brazil variante reduces efficiency saw phase 3 trials J&amp;J Novavax. reduced efficiency better efficiency really major deal. also always adjust vaccines. already flu every year. Moderna said they're already working potential booster shot. basically needed may need get vaccinated later line. that's majdeal since we'd already level protection booster shot simply boost immunity.

To sum up. worry get vaccine potentially may need booster shots line. Although probably often flu since covid mutate much flu change things significantly. They're better terms [recent deaths per basically every northeast state large early outbreak (MA, NY, PA, CT, NJ, RI). 


If good weather excuse, Florida's outbreak summer even greater weather worse outbreak now? can't possibly understand could disagree statement Florida better northeast literally less people dying per capita Florida northeast states early outbreaks.


Even deaths per capita (which they're they're objectively lower) that's despite lockdowns all... wonderful news. Fingers crossed well.  government would covering pay, everyone amoral jerk will, possible, continue help employees able silly things like buy food. need capitalistic argument think people work deserve starve death, business keeps employees happy healthy despite able work, employees even happier healthier able work again, tell people great boss increase business public opinion. 

I'm saying would do. I'm saying people deserve starve death working, miss bs. I'm saying businesses literally got assistance. said true people lost jobs due shutdowns literally happened. watched restaurants furlough people, hospitals furlough people, etc. job do. without financial assistance provided would gone MORE. position.

Despite series lock-downs UK deaths per million United States had. collectivist national culture made difference. It’s good crop puns. hope thread isn’t muzzled. Dude really lived life like that. Thinking ignore problems going disappear science. problem technology behind vaccines. problem actually producing enough vaccine modified sequence quickly enough (and right now, vaccination infrastructure administer multiple shots per year entire world population). see, easy understanding current vaccine even original spike D614G mutation discovered last April increased transmissibility essentially 100% sequenced variants worldwide since summer (already new ones). Plumbers don’t understand fluid dynamics, accept fact results fluid dynamics affect trade.

That's story. comment governor breakdown? Literally none even children. Lol. Gotta love Reddit opinions parenting 20 year old video gamers vaccine wasn’t “Latinos.” senior citizens neighborhood, predominantly Latino. neighborhood chosen hardest hit NYC, according article, idea provide relief community. process rollout flawed, main focus article.

I experienced whites feeling oppressed races south time growing up. time wake hell certain shit.  oh no! WA positive case, breaking run 9 months free local transmission. Thought rock band. Oh yes shove vaccine right arm that's like baby. checked whether Djibouti real place not. Gold star. Unless parents age 65 
The parents likely whether this. Plus parents going work chance exposure children Close news quit hyperventilating, careful, get vaccine soon can. Vaccines way out. Almost there! :) FYI, looking MSA population figures also useful: Yes, getting facts places like New York Post. Sorry, retired virologist, worked field 50 years. take scientific research results ten minutes Internet medicine. No, unfortunately, anyone bubble with. Lived life incorrectly now, is.

Thanks asking though, hope little one enjoy ducks! Mass vaccination lockdowns?

For long pubs closed?

Whats point? No, wouldn’t. don’t efficacy trials approving every year’s flu vaccine, rna vaccines even interchangeable Yes, covid probably around forever. However, immunity built population (from vaccines natural infection) much less concern now. become one mostly mild diseases people get time time, like flu cold. yeah, ""half assed"" lock work, like bucket crack bottom hold water.

A real strictly enforced lock works extremely well, that's China avoided catastrophe even though every excuse real bad pandemic (it's started, huge dense population, poor access medical resources per capita basis). Right. that’s context article. headline meant trigger anxiety get click. That’s it. 
I firmly don’t think many people give shit international travel right even year. Amazing. end sight 😭😭 fact people already made mind origins virus without proof due blind prejudice. investigation outcome confirms view, say knew along use evidence. investigation outcome refutes view, say happened late, investigation compromised cannot used reliable evidence.  Nah, we've hoping common sense offend anyone's freedoms political status. Hopefully rollout improves, would nice finally able live life seems likely covid cause long term health concerns even healthy young people relevant rate.

It's quite simple Exactly.  Law order. year. us year. Half state governments still pretending real. \~200 person office usually sees THREE people day. taking seriously. patio bar next door hand usually chock full evenings weekends. That's article saying pay people medical studies time, donating sperm, donating blood plasma. Tell different. Infections UK like 50-60%. it’ll fine... ok thanks. AZ one licensed place museum tour after?  That’s including bit naturally derived immunity. It’s safe say around 5-10% population less risk catching it. probably drop percentage bit.

Proceed caution one They’ve guaranteed 100m end June. Either they’ll produce 90m 3 months it’ll slower trickle millions next 5 months. mayor strong words action back up. 'Murica. tell us do.  Wrong Please stop pretending anything US done actually shutdown. kids going vaccine tested them? remote village far away Land? orphanage slum City?  seems biggest unknown everyone received second booster 21-28 days. don’t know immunity past 28...  Meh, giving risk relatively small numbers issue prisoners ahead general low risk populace. Even GitMo decline heart surgery cases may people died COVID would scheduled surgery.

There may also patients low chances survival get heart surgeries likely would died anyway. every heart surgery necessarily saves life, particularly overtreatment issues system. Good you! people know category. think released data practically knew would yield good results stage 3?  never got herd immunity level. old study wrong. also scientific evidence virus continue mutate become resistant 1 year here.

Just scientific evidence show vaccine protect 12 months. yet able collect data confirm deny theories.

There less scientific evidence everything surrounds pandemic is. 

It's like masks necessary evidence, is.

They always late everything, evidence. Imagine misguided protesting vaccination site people keep repeating bullshit lost jobs economy crashing? economy crash government done ***every government world*** provided pittance financial assistance. Direct payments, covering employee pay, pausing rent/mortgage/bills. 

You give businesses $1T keep paying employees, give money employees survive employer unable pay them. 

We would lost fewer businesses fewer jobs this. would lose fewer next months started now. Australia make amends China source Chinese vaccine. Seems like brainer - bring politics public health issue really don't... virons ""compete"" (that's analogy - they're objects) infect cells. vaccine slows stops 99.9% virons, 0.1% mutations fight vaccine competition infect cells. mutations ""selected for"". 

The vaccine make mutated viron stronger resilient kills competition. That's concern anyway. 72 year old mum gets tomorrow immunocompromised sister got first jab yesterday. relief incredible vaccine kicks almost everyone. especially feared duration pandemic. extremely concerned impact children especially sure. Looks like unofficial trial participant. School controlled environment. son 6. School distancing, masks, shields, hand sanitizer, open windows common spaces. risk controls. Sometimes learn live something one strategy. Kids deserve us try keep safe school. deserve chance show follow rules. 

My family travel social gatherings avoid indoor space (except necessary food/medical). make school priority, something disposable. lockdowns work every time. UK three

Isn't fact needed three evidence actually work? Particularly since still one worst per capita death rates world?  Considering 2 doses current vaccines, 30m shots given now. J&amp;J one dose, likely going 500m needed US vaccinate 300m people. 470m shots go, getting average 2m shots day put 235 days now, that's September 22nd. June moon shot.  お前はもう死んでいる。 Maybe massively delayed (months). 

I’m younger particularly high risk. read 14 days results really good one shot. this. WFH issue problem sucks now, restrictions - needed even much suck - WFH indirectly suffers result.

in normal times, WFH would amazing. sleep, commute, someone hates socializing coworkers i'd love that, better time flexibility able go see hang friends, ie people actually like socialize with. I’m totally single walked door apartment hour ago returning back visiting everyone back north I’m from. 

This article killed juji hahha last quote sums everything well. Still...I need people, man.  quickly googled find anything. saw interview, person interviewed clear plan. Sorry can’t back  question anyone die vaccinated? able get second shot? even slightly delayed? oh shoot, got me. asians wear masks. therefore allowed times difficulties masks. execution? places around built ""outdoor"" spaces indoor-like airflow. Tents 3 sides down, sort thing. places potential super-spreaders, figure. Those, ones pack people close without sort dividers. story flying around several outlets. It’s one doctor advocating position. mean masks distancing until. think that’s case places like US UK you’re attached reality.  
These news companies want clicks. “Here’s normal won’t happen” stories get clicks. It’s yellow journalism. 
However it’s definition. carefree international travel year next - course not.  doesn’t translate masks required everywhere aren’t case world.  return indoor theater performances, least professional ones, ultimately Actors’ Equity (the big union actors stage managers), metrics focused *completely* cases. 

Their guidelines authorizing indoor performances cut-and-dry:

“There must sustained decrease new COVID-19 cases minimum 14 days local community rate less 5 per 100,000 population positive test rate new tests done COVID-19 less 5% least one week prior start work session.”

So.... go. don’t know guidelines loosened emergence multiple vaccines. But, you’re hoping live indoor theater come back form, least know conditions prevail. 

I could say *whole* lot more, I’m musician depends live theater significant chunks income... I’m going hold tongue. Bet get great 5G signal strength well. joking brilliant stuff. first shot scheduled one mRNA. However, likely won’t able make second appointment. 

How effective general one shot? Interesting! many good papers read coming months depends number vaccine refusers. Also situation animals. Committing 2nd Manslaughter? “Manslaughter Second Degree occurs person continues reckless act aware committing, consciously disregard potentially fatal risks involved others. risk must type reasonable person would ignore.” source-  US openly talk government, protest, citizens individual rights. true China.

I'm nervous, contacted school really want return class (no response yet school I'm able go work). got tested today results 2 3 days. trying see others think? Exactly. people complain can't go restaurants, bars, gyms. That's lockdown. That's first world problem.

No. One. Cares. It’s sub stupid brainless reality TV show! likely though. health experts expecting endemic advocating zero covid policy. advice to:

1) compartmentalize much can. Try consistent schedule work school work hour housework hour there. know difficult 1 year old, cry regardless focusing on. focus class work certain chunk time housework another time, focus task hand get flow. don’t plan reactive change gears fires come up. 

2) meal prep, meal prep, meal prep! Take one two afternoons week make meals week. save time money won’t spend much time meal prepping cooking. Plus spouse take meal work buy lunch day. time effective, cost effective, always healthy option available. 

3) read *I teach rich*. talks idea spending extravagantly things enjoy mercilessly cutting costs things hate. advice money, time well. like people, work day, get work, eat dinner, watch tv hours. know it, it’s late night go sleep. wake up, hit snooze wait long possible getting up. go work. cycle repeats always seems like running late can’t get ahead. really focus trying mindfully establish schedule. Limit passive activities like watching netflix try active things like exercising reading book kid. Even something like meal tv huge difference. would recommend outlining schedule sticking it. Set timer going watch tv example. important spouse works long hours. Odds getting much emotional psychological reward work, try something value work. 

4) look local resources access taken advantage of. best example would public library. know covid probably impacted resources offer, clubs groups could join take kid to. Even clubs meeting now, still check books forms media use kid enjoy. Many libraries digital content access home. 

5) focus things list, exercise, sleeping (I know it’s tough kids), reading, hobbies, etc. things known stress reducers. Try block time day week focus things. find helpful fill entire schedule, leave buffer time kid needs attention supposed working research, flexibility need do. 

6) take deep breath stay calm. Covid last forever eventually graduate options. know sucks now, eventually get better. try best position (mentally, emotionally, physically, etc) over. Shit happen matter happens. life. thing control react life throws you. hope get Oxford vaccine too? propose interstate bans? realize literal cities amd city metro areas cross state lines right? Walking nearest grocery store could interstate travel areas, even crossing road. Going work states common places country. 

Not mention enforcement. Even block major highways crossing state lines tons smaller roads intersecting them. Enforcing impossible.    know COVID's IFR less 1% right? 

And risk death year (from causes) *much* higher COVID IFR every age group.

Schools venues properly enforce cleanliness. That’s happens you’re paying someone 2 dollars hour care.  Lots people exposed coronavirus still don’t catch - 16 days likely fine. I'm willing wait extra day two would take put prisoners one top tiers behind first responders/healthcare/elderly general populace 😂 finally agreed epidemiologists reasonable 30 amplification cycles PCR testing.

3. 2 fails, herd immunity unfortunate hard way eventually Hmmm cool. idea Manaus, large city, could 76% seropositivity October plain unlikely anything imagine. sketchy hell, 52% June equally so. degree seropositivity vary somewhat many factors, there's little possibility one city Brazil would order magnitude higher hard hit one Europe got much earlier, indeed elsewhere Brazil. Clearly never anywhere near herd immunity.  Yep rational centrist arm covid discussion. enjoy it. shoot them....with vaccine? yup, hospitalizations significantly lower easier give effective treatment still need hospitalized anecdote work hotel sales hotels across US week alone received 3 inquiries large traveling theatre companies looking rooms Q3 Q4 year.

When history humanity ever case? Always interesting liberal politicians voters truly believe ""world cooperation"" real thing reality, everyone takes care should. Shame canadian politicians ignorant naive.  Agreed. Furthermore, able give booster shot using vector, unlike RNA subunits. That's I'm skeptical usefulness vector vaccines long-run. exactly think Americans would react feds kidnapping people streets? freedom. basically vs. us. it, means it. evidence support yet. Right know vaccines prevent becoming symptomatic, reduce symptom severity initial infections.

We know vaccines prevent asymptomatic carrier. antibodies cannot pass blood-brain barrier, know immunity conferred vaccine would protect potential infection brain. 

It unreasonable think vaccine help. However, evidence collected far would also allow vaccines far less effective preventing ""asymptomatic"" infections lead long covid. know else would help? Another quick lock virus you’re vaccinating isn’t relevant vaccine approval process realize I'm facetious COVID orders magnitude severe normal viruses see every year, EVERY respiratory virus ""damages lung within mere hours."" cough evidence. lung heals. believe screeching, understood saying. US basically situation. one crossing Canadian border there's data whatsoever suggest anyone illegally crossing border Mexico bringing virus them. 

We could shut international travel earlier longer, chose to. Australia still need wear going anywhere close back normal years

Citation needed. California's COVID death rates much lower Florida

I never would guess hysterical shrieking California worst country. (Never data cited.) Good you.. sure?  posted comment came back see blow up. Yeah, said basically I'm saying fear mongering. Yes, virus spread mutate assuming worst case scenario every turn idiotic. Take flu/influenza mutates time go reporting, ""new variant loose possible one wipe humanity planet.""

Azar said Tuesday Trump administration planning release strategic reserve doses holding back booster shots, governors said since learned reserve already released week."" satisfied health insurance literally thing happy healthcare.

lmao? Fine. they're unhappy healthcare like it. 

Why bother you? clearly does. clearly think something political. reality people fine that. bother you? Covid always here. spreading (and severity) vaccines. Oh sure, lost grandparent multiple great grandparents flu years.

Unfortunately society decided flu nothing, it’s deaths somehow acceptable likelihood new covid strain resistant vaccine emerges? happens prevent large amounts cases? Yet generalizations.. sigh.  Finally south 100,000. Yay!! I’ve studying leftist theory ten years, yes. know shit. where? Certainly US. Daily numbers look better every day hard know Biden's administration anything that, doubt it, ten days much time. big difference I've seen seem interested getting working right figuring issues. Personally trust politicians much I'm pessimistic person like expect everything perfect now, improvement welcomed. China doesn’t kidnap people covid. people breaking lockdown. would see house arrest fined. 

Americans putting “freedoms” others. It’s selfish fuck. Let rippin’ tearin’ begin   reason. EU already confirmed Canada won’t block deliveries Pfizer Moderna. whole thing geared towards AZ UK. Austrália producing AZ doses wouldn’t concerned.

Just another sensationalist article get clicks. Everything say true. Exactly, best thing one best other, work way? argument health vs health. 

The economy directly tied health population. Money allows people live healthier (heavily proven statistically). current spending protected people falling gaps, unlimited fiscal power. fact probably even year's worth level.

I believe risk insignificant enough allow people decide themselves. government responsible keep hospitals open capacity, reason completely back shutdowns. 

However responsible actions may result getting sick, free decide. wish take precautions also free so.

Ultimately, point worth it. 

Once again, suggest better plan. I'm definitely anchored opinion. seen states vaccine roll plans vaccinate people 50-75 mid March. group vaccinated, mortality rate plummet. LA police subcontract security D.C. Capitol police? issue kids, kids may spread COVID adults household. community spread low mitigation measures place, there's good excuse keeping kids on-site school. correct. problem logic people South Africa first strain getting reinfected newer one although suspicion cases would quite mild. data tell more.

I think decently big deal catastrophic. Might push back reopening extent slow stuff reopening. think completely stop we're much better position before. Moderna also showed pretty large loss antibodies South Africa strain although Pfizer showed relatively little. people natural antibodies loss 5/6 South Africa strain still would enough many get sick fact many still getting sick least know exactly many think it’s possible. goal 2B 2021 150M month Max, 8 months, means they’ll hundred million May. hopefully go India, Canada, Australia Philippines UK US already significant amounts then. What? doesn't. Overestimation initial infection rate one four possibilities investigates. What’s point? think dying even higher rates, or? Novavax vector protein subunit. AstraZeneca vector. numbers original strain Novavax right level Pfizer Moderna use basic spike protein design implemented differently. long short would expect results Novavax Pfizer differ dramatically. adenovirus vector Novavax vaccine. It’s minor anymore. We’re looking second boring sit home summer. It’s minor, major part people’s lives.  anthropomorphizing something isn’t even alive? “incentives” evolution. None. _blind_ watchmaker. Oh ok, thanks clearing up. Really can’t wait start rolling really put dent thing. include J&amp;J currently relative unknown compared Moderna Pfizer. I'm suggesting work- contrary likely sure increase chance hitting numbers need relatively normal summer- A: Approved B: Distributed C: Shots put arms I'm putting eggs basket. Pandemics complicated frustrating exactly 'know' mental health I'd rather mange expectations things certain likely. know I'm going get alot downvotes I'm curious many people continue wear masks past April u think could go another summer wearing masks need get vaccinated like pronto, amigo. 

I read ""surfer dude"" voice. Despite risk mitigations kids still die rates. eliminate cleaning products risk kids die them? ban cars, people die them. ban pools, kids drown?

We enforce seatbelt wearing put kids cars. teach kids swim, lifeguards. lock away products might dangerous. sending kids school masks good enough? risk mitigation good enough comes covid ok everywhere else. Biden president 10 days now. seen anything changing state rollout vaccine? tell people goddam game, dismiss - times - inflammatory.

Well, say take Advil wake hell need go back normal fucking badly. I’m even sure I’ll person this. Nurses hovering nearthe 50% mark vaccination rate, doctors 90%+. Wrestling another close contact sport. whistling Dixie wouldnt replied...

We need get vaccinated like pronto, amigo. 

Thats message. Thats it. that's one reasons Hawaii one successful states managing COVID. I'm sorry. stories awful read. ☹️ Unfortunately take greyhound past December. Good luck getting wear mask Despite things listed reduce risk, kids still die rates. ok deaths, covid bridge far need abandon educating kids? makes risk mitigation good enough comes covid, ok everything else? 

No one seems able answer questions keep listing ways try lower risk continue participate things. keep kids away things too?

Of course. joyrides, use properly secured rear-facing car seat long possible.

Don't go home gun.

Have kids take swimming lessons learn CPR.

All poisons cleaners definitely kept reach children. fuck about?

Get smoke detectors. Check make sure stove oven every night. smoke inside leave food unattended stove. maybe everyone already real version is..??? show work everyday. I’m finance. strike? teachers better finance people doctors nurses food service workers gig workers grocery workers?  vaccines actually much easier make treatments viruses... That's kind long short it. treatment also bring society back normal government going inclined fund much extremely likely new covid strain emerge \*resistant\* vaccine small degree. 


It extremely unlikely one emerge sufficiently resistant make vaccine moot entirely. Really hope FDA approves trial complete. Would great get tens millions doses March April. hospitalized questioned everyone could. one six workers asked accepted vaccine. primary dr refused it, well.

It's scary. bet fourth one summer, precaution upcoming Sierra Leone super strain, work too, fifth next winter protect NHS tough flu season, sixth potential new variant found remote village Cambodia... ugh. CDC lists age groups 15-24 added groups rounded down. Newer research suggests 10% people develop symptoms 14 days 1% 20 days, however probably less infectious people develop symptoms earlier. pepper spray worthy. fuck vaccine rollout Yup. surprised get 5 mil day options, sites folks eligible vac. patient taking immune-suppressive medications vaccine protect them. Well should. 

Don't take kids joyrides like car. necessary car travel. Use well-secured carseats seatbelts. speed. Avoid highways can.

Don't leave kids alone tub. live near water pool, get swimming lessons early possible. Know drowning kid looks like. Learn CPR. Yup. 150M monthly full capacity. pull ramp 150M/month May that’ll incredible.

Thought wouldn’t expect approved March. Pfizer applied approval Health Canada October, didn’t get approval mid-December. Nowhere ever argued kids get covid affected all. Kids relatively low risk covid. seem spread less according CDC observed around world significantly mild symptoms demographics. Holding strawman favors. 

All data readily available online. quick google search confirm everything typed thats much effort know say. 

Most deaths listed things caused peoples actions. Someone crashing car lead someones death almost always case someone 16 dies car accident. risky behavior people take never independent themselves. 

All diseases listed much worse outcomes kids covid does. 80.2% protection 28 days one dose according F*#$k people. immediately thrown prison violating rights others. time b.s. Covid virus concocted (insert favorite bad guy/girl/group/nation here) sterilize (insert favorite guy/girl/group/nation here) . pls improve idea feed Q. Lets see happens. Ecuador got vaccines week two ago, 8k vaccine doses 17 million people. idea they'll get more. Thanks, champ! stupid theory. AMLO barely influence Mexico, he's walking joke. New mutarions always emerging, far looks like 2 3 12,000 variants affected antibody performance. effectiveness antibodies reduced, likely lot, spike virus' key unlock cell, mutated point escaping antibodies entirely, would also lose ability enter cell, like key deformed fit lock. limit much antibodies lose effectiveness mutated virus longer concern. probably happened lot, see viruses mutated extinction. It’s domestic terrorism, is. treated such. D'oh! nothing comment, hit nerve? Well sure tell Vietnamese government done great job. Virus pops lock fast hard.

Slowed beginning EVERYWHERE go, outside tourist related businesses busy fuck. Reddit. here? definitely influence Latinos LA

I'm sorry dude. AMLO barely influence Mexico proper think influence 2nd even 3rd generation Chicano's LA?

Thanks laugh. Thanks helps bit. I'm happy husband, think meant reply person two me! :) reading? responding poster talking province. American much world outside America covid serious. province 5 million people 1,000 deaths recorded since started counting. even said 500 cases per day 5 10 deaths 110 causes norm. Obesity bad you, period. 

It puts constant strain body, even young. terrorism plain simple. terrorists dark skin shout religious phrases blowing building.

They denying access vaccine people genuinely want afraid it. Right vaccinating people risk getting sick stage. Particularly nurses doctors. 

So consequences actions lives. doctors nurses also people treat especially many get sick forced stay home.

First weekly parades held this. I'm really sorry hear that. Solidarity family. forget WhatsApp, terrifying forwards sent there.  he's kid. overweight kid lot different someone abused body decades. Cool, bro! arrested? Geraghty, JetBlue’s CEO, said domestic testing moment difficult secure timely manner would likely required proposed regulations

Best case scenario: regulations written allow rapid, less accurate tests. Government either funds tests adequately allows airlines passengers fund them. US tests per day expand 40% needed cover air travelers.

Worst case scenario: regulations require slow less available PCR tests. regulations (rightly) killed lobbying public pressure. Incorrect information. child-free still want country fall behind education already are. inequality go even more, since pretty much 100% private schools running. It’s worth mentioning it’s almost impossible compare US Australian cities official statistics US system city, urban metro areas real counterparts Australia, instead vague “greater capital city statistical areas”. closest US metro area definitions, still rather arbitrary skew statistics like population density including swathes unoccupied land national park.

(And FYI, “City Melbourne” arbitrary 14 sq mi (37 sq km) local council area, city proper, it’s useful comparison either locally internationally). optimal way ensure pandemic least amount damage going forward prioritize risk.  Hockey definitely clean sport. Eyes here, buddy WTF! people want vaccine let get it, want choice. can't people accept different choices. understand,I 5 year old blood clots this. implying use drugs alcohol coping mechanisms. moderate amounts use self medicate. don’t normally drink, don’t start. drink lot, drink less. Reddit. always civilized. poster New York America. ICU beds danger country. should’ve closed decade ago. Disgusting still open. Pfizer pay $2.3 billion fraudulent marketing. Portugal closed schools week ago. Fingers crossed weekend finally new cases showing signs peaking.

Closing schools stops transmission within schools, also means parents stay home look kids, sends message 'things normal' even ignorant take notice. Girlfriend fiancé lives another country able see eachother year.

It’s internet people talking *reassigning* essential workers like cashiers delivery drivers Cooks 

we HR department transfer us different Department also needs employees 

Like sound like never job life Finally giving virus dirt nap deserves. What's absurd gitmo still open we've held people almost 20 years without trial.   reading. None comments [in make clear US. apologize understanding that, see anything would conveyed information. Yep question Israel cases/deaths dropping like rock?

Sure, deaths delayed indicator, IIUC, Israel finished vaccinating oldest part population weeks ago, cut deaths significantly FFS, anyone even try read article? Pop-up city, gtfo noise. bet organised Facebook. guy flawless predictions. Neither his. gg 2 million doses per day low ball. We’d probably looking upwards 2.5+ end February. agree... why? shitty way think. given already life? That's constructive comment unfortunately. Given California’s surge due transmissible variant, actually is. open schools large percentage population vaccinated too. ask teachers seems ridiculous add fact want vaccinate them. Really seeing colors nation past years. Fortunately science know national borders, wins indeed testament global scientific collaboration. I'm certainly glad richest countries (including Australia) threw money research.

I'm absolutely thrilled pounds cure way. However total inability contain mitigate/prevent disease, regardless excuse, **a huge failure**. Frankly choice no-brainer:

A) quick science-driven response brings life close normal months. Unemployment kept control paying workers $1200 every 2 weeks. affected manageable healthcare costs. Vaccine roll 2-4 months behind countries, free citizens. Country deaths per capita, limited impact economy

B) Country completely uncoordinated response, many (even leadership positions) deny severity disease. Cases skyrocket, putting hospitals capacity necessitating mass graves.Depending live, either spend whole year lockdown mass unemployment, restrictions burdening many record increase medical debt. Fortunately country front line vaccines, literally distribution plan late January, leaving many doses left unused. Novel strains start popping contagious might less responsive said vaccine

One would choose B veil nationalism. Fortunately US country developed vaccine, world robust response without us.

At least agree Germany better response US. 83 deaths per million effective/first mRNA vaccine. Nope never thought laid nice chart Twitter State Ohio signed 20-30 elderly neighbors relatives last week. It’s never taken 15 mins find location vaccine available within next 24 hours. I’ve sent Public Health Department Kroger’s CVS. think LTC workers get paid shit NBA players? requires degree self control.

You need 1% ltc staff fail outbreaks everywhere no, paying people locking down. California great example this. /s say muh lockdowns harmful consequences Thanks update. I'm amazed still remembered reply. not? can't make time even within week? Make sure get second soon can. forget it. news: glue makes things stick things Really depends situation context. times either useful. fuckers put prison agree other. Fuck disgusting. New Zealand barely country. isolated island country one lives zero world presence set rules. statement true individual infection. Covid's high infection rate somewhat counters low base rate. 26 million cases large melding pot possibility. tried things. fact matter point there's little could do. Establishing ramping manufacturing takes many many months. Europeans trying ramp Pfizer manufacturing additional plants produce vaccine. it'll July (Sanofi) till start sending vaccines EU (5.5 months).

For better worse, US mostly locked Trump administration 6-10 months ago, considering otherwise screwed COVID response surprisingly pretty good compared virtually anywhere else. mention lockdowns California reactionary. ""lock down"" cases get high, open back go back down. course going look say, ""wtf? locked down. many cases?"" Well, virus also spread half assed lockdowns. think won’t able travel internationally many years? aggressively protecting people COVID-19, made possible kids go back school safely. Well done. handled it. ended conversation stopped replying. mean love Nate hard math lol people don’t want them? Who’s still afraid virus? Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna opening factory somewhere like Australia/Japan/ South Korea production capacity distribution reasons? Sorry loooooooong delay replying - kept meaning forgetting ... think increasingly getting ready retire saying much used work full time job right stopped (and practice well beyond 8am-5pm medical job) well thinking necessarily able bring 100% forever deny manoeuvring going well workplace people going well (new arrival despite qualifications lot places wanting work trouble worth combined person hired sort beef dad reasons I've never really able fathom).

So, combination factors part decision making process determining leave workload hassle general exceeded trouble worth. Yes, could definitely frame jumping pushed regardless, going stay much longer either way went went end I'd say decision would +/- months matter what. mean, purposes here, pretty quickly realize American cities MUCH larger Australian ones.

LA's metro population half entire country Australia.

The whole state Victoria (same size Minnesota) less half LA's metro population.

Now, major reason Australia far better US COVID? know. definitely know US cities much densely populated much higher populated Australia statement (not yours) Melbourne populated LA nonsense. quite tenses!  Lookout! mine yesterday, arm pain noticeably sore first dose, bit sleepy today, apart nothing. One co-workers worked 12 hour shift second dose, problems. Another said tired it. girlfriend low grade fever, swelling lymph nodes, bit swelling injection site second dose (only arm pain first dose). That’s really weird definition. people work date see families go around without masks it’s normal. That’s people care want know happen. International travel isn’t normal life anyway never was.  must vaccinate quickly possible. approved vaccine get arms. problem isn’t protesting, it’s blocking access vaccines fellow citizens pandemic. Obviously.   info comparison? know Moderna uses cationic lipid nanoparticle (LNP). limitation size only?  really tragic anyone dies pandemic, they're young doubly sad. Yes. T'was I. welcome! example shoveling money vaccine manufacturing, striking deals early producers making sure produce US US market.

The US (and UK) spent 7 times per capita supporting vaccine manufacturing EU. part reason US (and UK) vaccination campaign going well crashing burning EU.

For size, US vaccination campaign going extremely well. I've heard it. understand safety concerns, people around acting like virtual school best thing since sliced bread. 

It's weird. Lockdowns absolutely effective actually enforced.  Yes, trust epidemiologists. exactly doing. bull! Vaccines slowing spread virus!

Not enough people received vaccines plausible.

Changing number cycles test previously lead TONS false positives reducing numbers number cycles dropped conmen.  ruled antibody dependent enhancement? literally saw tons people lose jobs March states shut down? economy crash government done ***every government world*** provided pittance financial assistance. Direct payments, covering employee pay, pausing rent/mortgage/bills. Wait til child 107 degree fever worse think differently. person Latin American origin. libel laws used anti-vaxxers? People living lives, awful.

Everyone planet lot people subreddit even outside pandemic: never socialize rarely see sun.  C'mon man... seriously? nose shape Oh think maybe stated confusingly- single week since basically pandemic without case now. note cases also dropped dramatically community area. lots things likely working together. information comes person likely similar position hospital. would plan centrally control distribution multiple vaccine candidates across US look like, would expect cost? 90 grandparents trying hard get vaccine can't find anything March. people want still can't get Maybe public land blocking traffic leading stadium? Given exponential risk obesity, also likely 9 year old gained weight since picture taken, especially considering limited opportunity get exercise past year. Yep. it’s 72% efficacy US, variants widespread yet. r/thatshowthingswork covid started, decided I'd never work office again. many pluses...no 1-2 hour commute way, get 5am get work. one steals lunch put fridge. spend fortune clothes dry cleaning. worry problems plumbing make water brown one fixes it. deal annoying co-workers come office bug hours personal problems. $6 cups coffee Starbucks that's thing look forward working window-less office day hear people flushing toilets every five minutes office next restroom. going work dark leaving dark. take walk around block lunch without worrying boss see me. freezing death sweating can't regulate building hvac system. finding people sex training room hall. missing things got stuck traffic boozer caused accident freeway backed miles. wasting money gas buy tires frequently driving. forgetting lunch, pay $10 soggy sandwich.

wfh means control lot things. work i'm going work home. try find things instead gravitating towards work i'm bored. life slowed lot, there's lot pluses. i'm trying soak over, crap fun, part 'life' come back again. article disingenuous race baiting nonsense. ""Vaccine appointments initially offered people age 65 older live New York state.""

If 65+, qualify vaccine, live NY, availability directs center opening supposed do? take appointment state directed too? state wants everyone go vaccine sites neighborhood race, SET SYSTEM WAY!!!! Latin America. Pretty crazy elect narcissistic tyrant doesn’t give damn people leads. Elections consequences. Biden couple weeks moving faster anyone could expect... especially considering aforementioned tyrant left steaming pile crap.  Depends state. least restrictive areas already normal. However people I'd say sometime May-August. It’ll mixed bag. company, value importance person conversations highlighted. see us walking $ signs requiring tests makes see less us walking around. hope ELI5'd thought enough fellow Americans understand situation better.

Wish we'd get serious right obnoxious wrongs. Hmm, work employee health department still least 5 new cases week around immunization rate around 3k employees... say since February? haven’t week employee got covid since like October. 

Additional info: Policy place work says covid pos employees need cleared employee health department return work, see every single case. 

The vaccine working—the drastic decrease hospital/clinic employees quite honestly staggering. Even 3 weeks ago seemed like talking 15 per day, it’s like 3 4.

Reason talk many many times give call screen symptoms see they’re safe come in. getting pretty difficult many cases top tasks done. Quite honestly many times covid + people came in... could screen (though ex-coworker lazy piece shit something that) times covid + person came even told to. even he’s outside window, he’s asymptomatic, matters. way way fewer people going hospital, vaccines working post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Like, covid getting bad around world Italy, dude literally tries divert ATTENTION pressure him, China!

It’s like dude, yeah finding origin important time that, like handle current shitstorm covid worry pressing matters, no, kept calling immediate investigations origin worst time.

See: Boeing 737Max 25000 people flying every day (i.e. commuting) different set people flying different days? implications closing state borders massively different. Yes, dealy virus less likely spread since people cautious it. Well parents got sister got it. think got cause strep throat ears fucking hurt. Like pisses . ok, let mind body rest. bit skeptical attitude, “rare”. don’t happen it’s common seems media. incentives make fearful headlines. don’t blame them. it’s important think criticaly context. ok 0 confirmed cases mean 0 actual cases, means 0 detected cases. period someone gets tested infective dangerous period. hey, too!

when people bring they’re worried it’s new, think got new vaccine child, may well again. I'm hopeful get worse. I'm hopeful vaccinations happen quick enough JnJ out. thing I'm worried hit like 10% vaccinated something everyone goes ""good vaccines out, over"" causes one last wave over. I'm holding hope people finish marathon strong. 100,000 people died covid US SINGLE MONTH, January. think variants something this. Spanish flu killed 65,000 October. Covid nearly doubled that, surpass great influenza raw death numbers US. get 65s vaccinated, 3-5% going die. 1 1,000 already died US. idea media much fearmongering.

I think causes lot unnecessarry anxiety many people lead health issues long term. seen 3rd wave Spain? I'm sure. I'm export (farming) definitely like (hated) tariffs happening, kind eat crow end think deals negotiated lot better started with, especially China. Young healthy. problem. person may like runny nose called symptomatic. assume person like coughing everywhere feverish?

Thanks Phoenixmusician, fun, fun, fun. women vaccinated men. guess that's institutional sexism, look forward multiple media outlets talking bad is.  honestly wonder people WW2 complained turning lights night mitigate bombing raids.

They absolutely did, yes. experience first two years World War II, included massive losses incurred shipping ""First Happy Time"" confirmed ships sailing convoy — without escort – far safer ships sailing alone. British recommended merchant ships avoid obvious standard routings wherever possible; navigational markers, lighthouses, aids enemy removed, strict coastal blackout enforced. addition, available air sea forces perform daylight patrols restrict U-boats' several months, none recommendations followed. Coastal shipping continued sail along marked routes burn normal navigation lights. Boardwalk communities ashore 'requested' 'consider' turning illuminations 18 December 1941, cities; want offend tourism, recreation business sectors. 12 January 1942, Admiral Andrews warned ""three four U-boats"" commence operations coastal shipping (in fact, three), refused institute convoy system grounds would provide U-boats targets. population one billion India seems secrets fighting covid extremely scary even people don't. There's many people take situation granted realize much worse could be. TOILETPAPER NZ 5.101 million people according Statsnz

US - #23 Alabama Louisiana 

EU - #26 Ireland Norway lockdown Perth COVID, 25,000 people every day flying Melbourne Sydney, go guess one complained back then. bet needed done now, 30% U population would leave lights towns Idaho would leave streetlights night prove point . Permits workers needing travel across border work. done Australia. done elsewhere. Without chiming opinion this, I'll note possible vaccinate guards prisoners.  60% efficacy preventing disease, 100% preventing hospitalization worse (if I'm mistaken) Yeah definitely sort restriction that. I'm American Yep. hit number virus crashes “under weight” running people infect. far lower level population immunity could swing difference measures totally ineffective exact measures devastatingly effective. There’s science article, I’m sceptical much would gloom article. 

I think play eventually, wary. gives people ‘false hope’ vaccines thing need do. exemptions border towns Australia. People worked Albury-Wodonga applied permit travel work side state border, couldn’t travel beyond small bubble. May slightly complicated international borders, it’s possible.  fun facts, thanks! relevant thread NZ please?  denial, thought fine. started dreams sudden fever kicks start gasping air. They're stress dreams catch covid. even realize stressed... Mr Plinkett said, ""You may noticed, brain did"" Shit, feel like retracting comment.. completely right!! also points us Aussies well, bunch selfish nut jobs.  Well yeah, someone else supposed respond. think I'm going call response like weirdo?

Unless auto correct garbage 150 flu cases vaccinated? know 3 people died flu, including two children, one vaccinated.  Aussie, Aussie Aussie Oi Oi Oi

Thankyou Yes, us happy bit help community. soon we'll jab international holidays back table. There's place I'd rather live. Kiwi here. wrong. Uttar Pradesh seems well, especially given population density. switched Ivermectin/Doxycyline/Zinc treatment prevention. Started giving people professions contact lot people treating entire households one person house came Covid. Furiously pretending closing Australian state borders exactly like closing US state borders probably useless thing one could do. true, help US improve crappy policies, contribute ending epidemic there.  wish award give. Yeah, it’s going happen, that’s world works. also, it’s like wealthy donors hospital board members healthy 35-year-olds. older demographic begin they’re cutting line matter weeks rather months. arrested? It’s got illegal block someone getting access medical services? America, even liberal states, weird decide clamp protestors use kid gloves deal them. Stopping people get access vaccine results actual harm. Arrest them. Prosecute them. ban protesting witching 50 feet medical facility. Nope. listened experts ones agree with. experts right. Compare results California Florida. Florida better results right bat even take account Florida higher percentage older people California. Honestly thought early response way proportion risk. get locking first understood happening original plan ""flatten curve"" moderate pace spread health system could deal it.

This somehow morphed endless lockdowns stressing every time cases increased even though literally plan initially. wear mask literally killing people.

The fatalities concentrated people age 65+ health conditions surprised people keep dying. Like think think 3 4 months fatalities group people people would extra careful. apparently steady supply people know facts. think fault media, portray virus something super deadly everyone simply isn't.

Meanwhile lock people little risk, relatively young healthy, name protecting people already locked extent, people nursing homes elderly.

I hope year two done people look back realize response completely control. country’s dense, cities Stockholm Copenhagen population.  USA UK hoarding vaccine production done vaccines produced Europe, indeed better find new allies fight pandemic.  Still highly unlikely yes. 

Even J&amp;J's one dose vaccine lower overall efficacy prevented 85% severe cases post 28 days shot (plus 100% post 49 days) 100% hospitalizations 28 days post shot even places new variants prevalent.  

The J&amp;J vaccine target spike protein good indication Moderna Pfizer's vaccine still work well severe disease. That’s makes difficult - agree principle. Teachers signed work kids. deal kids sent school flu colds everything between, help kids everything set front them. But, it’s like teacher step away replaced person street needs job willing face risk disease. Think bad teachers you’ve (and us few) - disparate effect life. situation. see snuck r/Sweden spread usual anti-Danish propaganda instead. usual leaving parts make Sweden look worse:

- peak around Christmas Denmark still less 5% positive tests. Sweden went 20%, safe conclude reality number new cases nowhere close looks here. Denmark 1% positive tests Sweden still 10%.

No, that’s get chlamydia.  called doomer start 2020, come doom. People aren’t getting vaccinated sufficient rates make dent anything superfun see virus mutates resist mRNA vaccines. Man need learn government areas. Greater Sydney population density 430 sq km. contains lot national parkland, rural areas, etc. City Sydney population density 1,170 sq km. Actually true. headline inaccurate.

There evidence suggest new variants UK SA evolving avoid vaccines. merely mutations prior vaccine available areas beneficial virus’ ability resist. 

Theoretically speaking, 100% population vaccinated virus mutates overcome vaccine’s ability prevent infection, make argument it’s evolving resistance. see bacteria time. evidence that’s what’s occurring. mutations happened vaccine rollout. purchases breathe you?? think swedish response efficient balanced, kind cherry-picking single-variable argumentation isnt useful.

Whereas countries authoritarian leaders focused power networks, maintaining status quo, making money, leads totally different outcome. write paper it. side effects?

For me, shots pretty mild (Pfizer, 38 y/o male asthma).

It’s terrible marketing time really need many people vaccinated possible. Absolutely. Probably around 30-35% without vaccines. People whine everywhere.I guess first time many decades mass vaccination adults happening India.People pretty happy vaccinate kids &amp; babies without fuss comes self think side effects/rumours cases outright arrogant. much text avoid answering question. addition funding channeled EU vaccine development production pre-financing, breakdown funding made available directly EU national governments? 

The EU initiated Covax project, US, Russia China join international cooperation order pursue geopolitical interests. UK took big role Covax primarily due large share AstraZeneca distributed via Covax. normal procedure.

Don't quote comments without context. subreddit quoted me, faced tremendous storm British jingoism.  right, pedantic reason. Completely understandable, sorry assuming. still find bad compare Sweden Norway Finland, hours Helsinki Oslo feels like I'm driving around North Sweden considering something like 80% population lives 1/3 southern part Sweden, big difference density. thank taking time answer , looks like i'll take whatever available , stay safe! virus doesn’t care government’s rules are. often people don’t, either.

All virus needs get enough copies infected person “a” eyes, nose, mouth, lungs not-yet-infected person “b” thing Ebola scary (60-75% mortality), it’s fast, airborne. don’t know reservoir host (many think it’s bat) tends pop people outskirts jungle.  kills gorillas congregational apes possibly worse humans everyone knows scavenge meat dead gorillas anymore.  number outbreaks 80s people finding # dead apes butchering them.  

When pop tends burn human reaction (we get really scared really quick). It’ll hit village start killing people. people shun area (and threaten people come it). People learned it’s caretakers get sick people learned caring sick family members pretty much dangerous thing do.  people left food die others receive good treatment outbreak professionally managed point.  saying goes done treating family Ebola carefully take bodies burn hut (or something like that, happens don’t want someone died Ebola).  

Ebola terrible works propagation. People scared keeps isolated.  

The book “Spillover”. huge section interesting. Whats rationale behind claims?


Is fastest rollout world still good enough you? would like ask wait week two India scales infra casting judgement efforts.


We went 0 RTPCR testing 1.3-1.5 million tests day couple months.


Our vaccinations started two weeks back vaccinated 4 million healthcare workers already along gifting 30 million doses neighbours, SEA, Africa latin American countries. Read Trump/Morrison prisoner debacle early Trump administration. medical expert, doctor, etc.

I wouldn’t. dumb title. insinuates there's variant novel Texas. Enough enough. good life can’t enjoy everything life offer? probably believe Legend true story.  honestly say, buffet style restaurants never coming back. Even somehow do, I’ll never step foot again. Playgrounds schools shut many parts country almost year. ridiculous. I'm liberally minded take virus seriously, children able learn develop. sorts buffets employee serves everyone likely popular. irony buffets extremely good spreading stomach bugs maybe less respiratory viruses. posting news 2 weeks ago? There's argument made ranking flu vaccination programs going forward. Masking social distancing alone eliminate flu associated minor costs see argument made there. 


I think care 150 kids though, like covid restrictions. hope Australian Open decision undo everything. ? vaccine lockdown ? ? comes it’s case Israel ? comes cases dropping Germany despite close vaccination (2-3%) ? Ok can’t deny morbidly hilarious would months quarantine get permanent lung heart scars forced go church months stating doesn’t work 60’s, pressed stated ‘I data, scientific team look numbers’..... hours EMA approved adults age 18.

Utter recklessness, considering AZ non profit lifesaving developing world enraged me. know shouldn’t knee jerk reactions, god vaccines shit on, fact picked non profit crap flung makes blood boil (especially fuel give anti vaxxers) Macron lick toad! 

 [Quasi effective comment YAYAUS❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ still wearing mask everyday work tho  like kind alcohol free beer? approved vaccines matter much supply. Look us EU, 3 approved vaccines almost doses Moderna AZ deliver 25% initially planned February/March. streak longer Taiwan New Zealand too, that's crazy We're scared tackle get help worsens. Drink plenty water, tea, stay warm. mom also 300 lbs range close 50. test positive 9 days ago got chills, body aches, fever, trouble breathing, etc. better gets tired sometimes they're better. positive know we're you! lack testing something? people wear masks wash hands. senate decide fate. know people still dying causes right? fact due lack hospital beds, people likely die even without COVID. 

However interestingly, least countries, normal everyday flu spreading like usually due lockdowns social distancing etc. that’s amazing side effect.  Small, smooth brains well we’re it. way people lost fucking minds shops arvo shown we’re pretty dense. Safe say voted Trump lol Hence WA best state. /s Drives crazy people think 2 meters fail safe. precuation that's it. people argue stay 2 meters apart others gym (maskless, ventilation) therefore gyms 'perfectly safe'.  He's also believed ride-share driver three get past pandemic stage disease.

What things era covid return not?

I personally think WFH prevalent places communal dining like buffets cafeteria style restaurants way out.

Hopefull mindful others get sick cold flu. got good healthcare well 🙌 temperature low morning got bed Google make sure dying hypothermia lol. Indeed, look numbers Israel. They've seeing real effects hospitalizations past days, they're 20% coverage second AFAIK, that's correct. delivery method validated, minor changes payload likely validated much shorter trial. Taiwan's Vice President epidemiologist Communist China cut tourism political bullshit.

Taiwan played good hand perfectly. Yeah idk is. hurts swallow. Like drinking water stuff like turn ears hurt. think rona parents sister got isolated rooms atm. siblings taking care us bringing us food water. got yesterday know today tomorrow. medication strep throat already though I'm taking case. No, spread reduced mean that, mom, researcher, informed opinion. Also, lack airports since international flights use 787, A350, larger planes, regional airports can't support. need fly major city, fly out, chances spread. don’t get news coming France Europe general hasn’t heard this. exactly Macron ? better state leadership Victoria (where 90% Australia's coronavirus deaths occurred), covid-19 would hardly issue all. 

It Trump level stupid, rejecting Australian Defence Force's help instead opting unvetted private security ultimately caused 800 odd deaths had. worst part state government would mistakes. people getting vaccine harming way? people moronic EU export ban. UK US ban exports vaccines, EU not. ok there? come across bit angry afraid.

Gotta say Australians worried 'trapped' island foreseeable future see abject misery countries going through.

And funny notion freedom I'll put fear anger. Living Vic experiencing lockdown fun, we're reaping sown: long Sunday arvos sitting outside enjoying sun cold one mates.

Again, hope ok. We're going awesome :) seems like state mishap fix problems instead learning states experiences months ago. Gave false positives HIV test.

The vaccine might still work. Absolutely! talking that. 

You asked state level quarantine used everywhere, responded explain. 

It tribal response took sides overall pandemic whatever. saying US great, saying US lockdown, explaining harder lock borders situations others. project comment try make every discussion weird tribal bullshit agree everything enemy don't. even say border closures good, said would harder implement! tested positive COVID Friday (1/29). Since beginning pandemic, catching COVID biggest fear. Heck, y'all look post history sub see mental health drained everything going on. soon felt brain mental health starting turn corner positive direction, turns test positive. 

It sucks. completely lost taste smell slight sore throat. Aside that, feel fine, guess? nasal congestion, upset stomach, muscle aches, bad headache. 

My biggest worry I'm going die. turned 23, I've losing weight since 1st (360 336 now!), I've never diagnosed diabetes, high BP, etc. smoke drink. definitely obese. know obese help. makes feel started dieting late.. 

I know rare people age group pass, man... can't get fear head. :( like, I'm living last days speak? nurse asked first day showing symptoms (Tuesday 1/26) told I'll able leave house ten days later (which puts Friday Saturday, believe?) That's thing that's giving hope right now. time, I've read posts ""Well, completely woods. still bad second round soon start feel better."" 

If made far, sorry post comes ""dooming"" ""Fearmongering."" Please believe me, support neither those. I'm scared. :( Yep, NSW contact tracing prepared. McGowan joke. truly staggering revelation. bigger news r/agedlikemilk Strep throat it’s illness, though Covid cause sore throat. think strep please go get antibiotics. Strep bacterial get serious without them.

Covid still isn’t infection there. seem okay without measures *THAT* extreme.

I fully support McGowan team, current mask mandate sound.

Forcing mask mandate community transmissions 0 would serve create pushback public, would less likely comply health guidelines case actual outbreak.

There fine line WA government walks, think they’ve really well keeping people safe, without going overboard.   South korea higher population density infected earlier. took less economic damage 1% death rate. Australian, confirm like living North Korea - best come anytime soon (in particular Americans reading this) Littt think that's big factor. Compared US, sure, compared western Europe think difference. People UK worried secret police either they've done terribly managing Covid. British largely support government restrictions, problem government far slow lax them.  Victorian lockdown exceptions freight I`ll fight way vaccine, to. That's leadership, that's passing buck. Sadly, cure stupidity month jail them, much stand way someone going vaccine get out, back year. Ok, that's true needs stop. working quarantine, needs job. need paid enough need second job. contact lots random people.

Same deal South Australian guy working pizza shop. Whole city lock there, too. production lines completely different can't simply switched out. countries longer lockdowns Australia, mostly good excellent compliance. 

The fact countries technically left lockdown month, yet operating leads believe false. virus might real Australia liberal hoax America. huge deal Australia, Australian government tried take WA state govt court border closures shit show last 4 years supposedly 'more advanced' corners human society, get enthusiasm people? 3 million dead Americans. 76 million dead people. going close petrol stations anyway, what's logic there? Refuel 'rona gets around? could already spreading making worse.... US state wide lockdown good response would gotten top months ago. still clearly ready solutions issue.

Maybe immunity. necessary. long existing vaccines efficacy new variants, buys us time rapidly generate updated vaccines.

There’s low probability new variants completely render vaccines useless. Even worst variant far, SA one, reduces symptomatic efficacy 50%. Public healthcare preclude existence private healthcare. free, universal coverage let people pay extra get care they’re satisfied performance public doctor.

The first, rise specific mutations isn’t greatest news. carefully monitor understand means. isn’t fake news maybe would say. 

The second news mutations implications bring *is* sensationalized media, media every speedbump course entire pandemic. think people little sick of. No, mutations aren’t ‘fake news’ really headline shared public *vaccines still prevent severe illness known mutations thus far*. jar 1000 jellybeans one green jellybean, disingenuous center story jellybeans around colour green.

Mutations may sneak past neutralizing antibodies doesn’t mean left protection-less. vaccines still give cells handbook fight virus off. Yes, probably get cough stay bed days. Yes, fewer *some* get really sick require hospital bed even fewer die - small enough %’s total hospitals able handle life resume knew BC (before covid).

Every respiratory virus mutates evades neutralizing antibodies, damage done isn’t enough shut society every season. asked last time school. told you.

Cares act money upgrading ventilation code calls 3 air exchanges hour.

Yeah, push fixed, else will?

You NYC teachers care union rubber rooms unfit teachers care classrooms. That’s you. decades push basics like ventilation. Thats probably dependent employer.
I turn computer end work day.
I dont work email teams phone. employer never told expect so. course make around average pay. make high income would guess would different. I’d gladly eat one today.

I refuse accept anything less exact old normal 2019, except maybe people wearing masks *while sick*. trials set test symptoms. 95% efficiency example preventing symptoms necessarily transmission. Although early data Israel suggest may stop transmission nothing conclusive yet. could he's asymptomatic tested positive.

But yh everyone going protected. Vaccines 100% effective there's always small chance think know word ""goal"" means.

A goal supposed least somewhat ambitious. ""goals"" been.  first flu shot, you’re supposed get two doses. Thereafter, it’s one. Tetanus shots whole series, need booster, it’s one. It’s entirely possible covid shot like that. Agreed! like oxygen mask plane depressurizes. first put mask help need... first ever covid test. I've heard uncomfortable shove swab deep nose. test like that. swabbed close edge nostril. 

Did test change? wrong? seems like it’s 5.6% fatality rate sounds way. that's important thing. Likely didnt think covid, especially zero cases area. many illnesses present similar symptoms. like it, mean stop people wanting vaccine.

Everyone choice, mean stop someone else making choices made. Westralia acting like country Wait, thought free market. number rebelled restrictions small percentage population. Plus, countries like US U.K. funded, researched, manufactured vaccine.  mean 20's 30's went weeks months without seeing parents. seen elderly in-laws months. Yeah kind sucks far impossible.

Nursing homes already procedures place flu outbreaks dangerous residents. test everyone comes contact residents every day and/or completely cover PPE? know dentists doctors working every dealing public getting sick.

My point one thing protect 100% population another protect 15%. awareness prevention campaigns protect groups women breast cancer. somehow can't thing Covid. Facts? That’s last century..  I'm kind curious cases even able escape quarantine. forced 14 day quarantine negative covid test would thought virtually impossible anyone covid leave quarantine join community? Yeah, agreement. shame people get vaccine could save them. Also, whole ""95% effectiveness"" focusing 5% - could wrong vaccines 100% death hospitalizations? months baby Eventually gets immune system . Eh, no. According link tests per million:

US: 935,053

DK: 2,325,180


US ranks 19 world. DK ranks 7. Opinions biasedness different meanings dictionary. That's initially said lets wait years royally fucked well like poor country. shall good conversation then. Waiting day buddy. Till stop asking questions government used agree status quo. Good life living someone else. becoming suspicious j&amp;j stock point lol.

Why think supporting J&amp;J? agree that, honestly, numbers good.

I'm saying can't simply turn plant made produce adenovirus vectors one produces mRNA vaccines. three initially suggested (Moderna, Pfeizer, Novavax) completely different J&amp;Js - AZ isn't.

AZ terribly effective either - 90% number random obervation one hope true, new trials confirm it, that's excellent.

J&amp;J ENSEMBLE 2 see two doses improve outcomes. not, honestly, countries better relying little possible, many might choice, time working them. AU NZ need stop bragging guys going using AZ/pfizer vaccines   almost like see happened Melbourne. Sydney. Adelaide. Brisbane. NZ. Curious thus case able escape quarantine. IIRC people spend 14 days hotel quarantine get negative test joining community think we're arguing thing. saying shame people die need 2nd Moderna shot often associated kind symptoms. typically dangerous people often need take day work.

If look phase III clinical trial results see percentage people kind side effects, booster dose trigger immune system create strong protective response creates side effects. getting downvoted true. point measures stop covid cases, keep hospital capacity open people dying. need happen elderly immunocompromised vaccinated. Pfizer Moderna vaccine trials successful beyond wildest dreams- 95 percent effective got covid single one got severely. young people personal choice, time virtually risk spreading old person causing serious illness. wealthy people getting aren’t deal getting sick enjoying lives. love wfh glad gave opportunity so. However also lonely want see friends family. want pandemic end . want stay home work hours mean desperate get normal things free time! Lmao thats us gitmo use china benchmark situation. know honest numbers use draconian policies incredibly harmful citizens. follow china human rights issue?

Just places tbat locked low feath rates, places didnt lockdown also low death rates. can't keep saying lock hard enough. argument weak results tighter restrictions. means living year trying alternative locking down. 2019 pandemic guideline recommend lockdowns. views based bad science. abundance data suggesting correlation lockdown stringency suppression virus. Yes measures taken protect old susceptible closing society whole insane.

I'm talking countries deal threat pandemic. I'm talking countries already lockdown year really suffering it. Coronavirus already stopping it. lift restrictions harm good. 

Australia cut world, nobody go back time do. Also, buy death stats. Deaths covid19 also counts (not always deaths covid 19), least country. tests return staggering amount false positives says 1.6 million vaccinations yesterday. numbers last days tend increase days guess numbers continually reported. California 24th cases per capita 34th deaths per capita... WA entered chat dont live northwest west coast be. WA entered chat Definitely good thing. Everybody probably wants go nearest bar get absolutely trollied over, much humanity probably spend next two weeks collective hangover.

If turned alcohol affect ironically ended another era Prohibition, expect fly. like r/agedlikeHydrogen-7 Wow amount downvotes, people detached happening? like read it?

[Yes, course America using vaccines produced Europe, made course allowing exports another matter lol, imagine way around... oh know, UK considered move EU ""hostility"", UK vaccine production hoarded themselves.  vaccinated mother? tax argument dangerous one make. Making argument pays taxes, goal, unintentionally argues inequity distribution. 

The case washington heights partially due website english primarily spanish speaking community. Again, charge? elected officials supposed handle. need held accountable things occur. called free market reason ,and mean start forcing employers anything called free market reason ,and mean start forcing employers anything think hospitalizations fall fastest metrics we're targeting vaccinations groups likely go hospital. happened Israel saw hospitalizations fall 60% vaccinating 30% population. 

Fatalities eventually drop well, think fall even concentrated at-risk group. take longer time lag illness death.

I really want see everyone's reactions hospitalizations fatalities fall 50-75% across country continue trend downwards.  didn’t age well I'm sorry let clarify. Indefinitely, adverb, great degree; immensely. think so. looks like rumoured 4m AZ vaccines went EU UK happen either. Literally small batch flown US. EU hadn’t even approved vaccine. rest produced US.

The EU succeeded convincing citizens, blame America Brits everything going wrong lives. Doesn’t feel different coming echo chamber see different opinions people? Judging website USA tests per capita Denmark pretty previously unreported lobbying efforts underscore even Trump administration spent billions helping drug makers develop Covid-19 vaccines, dismissed states’ concerns help would need roll out, actively undermined efforts press Congress get funding needed. usually get cold every year august December. Nothing year completely respect opinion. think situation clear 'correct' answer, everyone needs vaccine enough go around. awful situation human race whole. try find sects leaders, it'll nothing. person make public edict order change happen. possible understand much power single leader entire group (there committee)? Technically UQ vaccine worked fine, issues participants returning false positives HIV worried might undermined public confidence scrapped it.   Knowing situation is, can't people keep rotating stock home instead panic buying. accurate, assuming got moderna Pfizer neither vaccine contains virus  Well really short answer nobody knows effective one shot long term studied.

Not sure circumstances really try get 2nd shot even weeks months late. COVID causes [viral directly. result COVID. everything like click bait. blame them, seem mask wearing prolific rural Texas. much exurban Texas. understand vaccinating fast...

And cases probably sharper decline already, high % population this... stricter lockdowns anywhere world, early. Cases stayed 0 summer, rose winter regardless restrictions, still well controlled

You follow seasonality chart every single nation, isn’t debatable  pick undetected community spread testing sewage. heard couple weeks ago detection sewage area includes quarantine hotels, indicates hiding wider community.  can't really argue discuss people facts either matter made up.

People love idea TV villain mastermind behind everything. ridiculous nobody could pull conspiracies. Governments large organizations likely incompetent masterminds. literally gave oxford vaccine ip free AZ exchange produced cost world.

Frankly think expected much actually finished first round vaccinations. Three days ago pick materials school home.

As environmental engineer pay bit attention ventilation you.

If ventilation poor, get fixed, there’s reason unhealthy schools. Run quickly..they wailing waiting eagerly you... Yes. are. I'm nyc. We've open quite bit. absolutely fucked. Schools old. good ventilation. Especially winter. article horse shit disrespectful co-workers I've lost year. Newsflash: viruses spread like crazy schools. always did. Anyone argues otherwise straight delusional. doesn’t get hands dirty lol

Really though probably coated coal dust really fuck lungs Washington Post doom gloom they're owned Jeff Bezos (not Amazon) every media outlet doing. clicks are. New York Times better owned tech billionaire. age risks though. It’s like everything else. need wear masks, continue socially distance need, continue shop online pre pandemic things. fairly small group people. Yup. Codeshare agreements exist, wonder go those.  Canadian airlines accept passengers connecting MX Caribbean origin?  risk stating obvious I'd get medical attention even pay. church picnics then....
Though guess scientist probably present world Batman, skepticism expected. That’s true. data Israel suggested even first dose cuts transmission decent margin pump generic moment patent expires.

Generics chemically active substance, sometimes slightly different additives, overall real difference original product - often produced way.

An mRNA vaccine contains different active product (mRNA vs viral vector foreign genes shoved code), produced entirely different way, using completely different additives treated completely different ways.

That say - different active ingredient, different way making it, different way storing different way distributing it. *The goal may same*, production facilities need *completely different.* 

We need actual mRNA plants upscaling made. Ideally Moderna license (Many countries simply cannot distribute Pfeizer's) Shame Canada going one needy countries soon. got disease even realize time, months later suspecting it.

I 3 people among far acquintances went it, said like bad flu.

According State, 84% deaths 70 older, 95% deaths 60 older. look forward day excess vaccines nothing them, everyone wanted one got one. Okay sir. dignity intact leaving asses lick you. Keep another decade rotting here. School teacher here. CDC completely full shit one. they're playing politics. wife allergic penicillin got Moderna vaccine side effects decent sized red bump injection site. outbreaks occur single clusters, dealt country goes back covid free next cluster America ever used vaccines produced Europe? thought produced domestically. certainly allow exports that's another matter.  even better consider 75% population eligible receive i.e. adults. Canadian - jealous problem people medically can’t get vaccine.  what’s congressman who’s tested positive couple weeks getting second shot? yes know happened before, yes know posted asked then, too.

What statistical odds happening two different congressmen? That’s small cohort, odds astronomically high? 

Based responses got last time happened, I’ve read pandemic, possible explanations boil following.

- You’re fully protected 2-3 weeks 2nd shot. there’s 6-8 week window getting first shot still catch it. got infected then.

- prevents severe symptoms may fully neutralize replication. Therefore whole “it doesn’t prevent spread, sickness” thing.

- became infected variant. variant escapes antibodies existing vaccines less effective theory.

- test false positive test doesn’t actually it.

- 95% effective he’s 5% theory.

Have missed possibilities? Um also correct. 2009 swine flu infected billion/up half worlds pop Race absolutely zero vaccine rollout nyc. I'm resident. Here's process: go website, enter zip code, take whatever get. Whites get there's ""Latino areas"", Latinos get there's ""Black areas"", Asians get there's ""Bengali areas."" Race absolutely nothing get appointment. Frankly, arguing certain races ""stay neighborhoods"" profoundly racist Yeah big issue. won’t way verify lax requirements taken vaccine. government stated 

in article SBI research report.

So something GoI said

Nevertheless, lets wait till August 300 million target? 

We still 200 days go. 0.4 million day, reaching 2,3 million day stretch, imo. Yes, it’s proven cannot spread virus vaccinated (likely can’t, unproven right now), spread reduced significantly vulnerable populations fully vaccinated. three scenarios hit mask mandates go away European Union restricting exports. don’t care invest anything houses, banks, mines farms developing vaccine question. agree there, stupid country living dumb luck. article go much detail.


The site shut ""as precaution.""

Here's link you. - comment article didn’t read? people nerve co-opt ""my body, choice"" slogan. 

And forcibly deny people's choice take vaccine. would say this? US vaccine rollout amazing success far... ""broad spectrum"" antibody coronaviruses could help cure ""common cold"" well?  would additional, huge, win.   Yes, edited mistake. mean get but... there's global pandemic money literally consideration. could started building factories produce top 10 20 vaccine candidates back June. fact whole world waiting handful factories kind ridiculous. issues assessment. Correct I’m wrong, able prove reduced dose accident actually led true increase efficacy. Wasn’t small sample size confounding factors may led increased efficacy? don’t recall sorting officially. Sigh. Cashiers can't possibly work assignment within grocery store? There's nothing else grocery store work cashier position? Even cashier, there's shift could assigned hazard customers might lessened, less-busy time day, lane fewer customers pass per day (i.e. ""1-10 items"" lane). way adapt, way mitigate risk foreseeable way. pandemic availability employees vaccinated changes nothing equation. Full steam ahead, straight avoidable iceberg might lay path.

I'm saying employer needs work employee best try balance greater risk themselves, customers, employees employees chose get vaccinated did. That's it. rocket science. I'm saying flexibility within workplace strike balance freedom choice impacts, exercise it. adapt. less irresponsible everybody involved.

I've worked decades occasion reassigned different jobs, given different tasks usual routine, etc. happens. challenging sometimes kind adaptability part job.

Frankly, job last year turned upside-down pandemic insanely stressful. I'm committed completing requests employer made despite high level difficulty. Whether sustain it, know, I'm trying. employer also asked employees make certain contract-related sacrifices lay people off, others also agreed to. We're working problem.

Maybe I'm touch reality I'm fortunate still job, maybe willingness fellow employees give-and-take employer situation why. think unfair people freedom choose whether get vaccinated (which truly believe have), employer ability adapt workplace choice.

Some businesses less flexibility, especially smaller ones. understand that. that's point, accept it. roll got, give thought what's actually possible given workplace right. “infection” mean case numbers, “virtually same” Denmark test 5x per million Sweden US. difference clear comparing deaths. Nothing high pressure water hoses truncheons can't fix. son headed collage fall also optimistic relatively ""normal"" access vaccines. Good luck. australia embarrassing. feel bad guys live there. Get vaccines going lock 2 million people one guy.... start personally think perfectly ok question fatality numbers UK countries, point contention since beginning. conspiracy theorist whatever never understood could count fatalities certainty given vast majority people died multiple serious health conditions.

That said, think UK's method counting fatalities within 28 days positive test overinflates number? switched method previous one number fatalities actually decreased.

Even elderly people health conditions continue live many years get covid cuts life short arguably ""covid fatality"" even going die one two years later anyway.

Another way visualize whole thing ""excess morbidity"" deaths statistical Time get born again. don’t think US Brazil ever adequate contact tracing, lockdowns positive case quarantines. Sure it’s perfect analogy. Still doable bit retooling. trying convince one drug manufacturers facility’s vastly different three major competitors weeks retooling can’t produce competitors drug vaccine think going disagree lol. It’s pump generic moment patent expires. Sorry break j&amp;j special. NY LA times really driving fear home today huh?  person gets jab mask distance proceeds rapidly erode. careful one.

There might facilities used mRNA production, ones designed viral vectors one those.

Mind mRNA vaccines something used human now.

The better hope J&amp;J's two-dose trial shows potency.  People like answer but....yes. blacks latinos shown skepticism vaccine less likely get it. article dishonest trash. I'm nyc resident. choice get vaccine. go website lucky enough get appointment, take it. I'm jewish. got mine ""black neighborhood"". That's option had.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* kidding. infection still virtually same. France multiple lockdowns see done nothing delay. South Africa one strictest lockdowns cases Africa.

The problem lockdown strategy consider structure society local cultures geography.

For instance Chinas lockdowns would viewed extreme west worked. world would hard time pull off.
While Australia New Zealand geographically isolated, control anybody entered. 
Most world luxury. far, 0 vaccinated trial volunteers ended hospital, odds really good either. They're second tier vaccines. nearly good mRNA ones, multiple trials different countries, work well enough.

They're virtually 100 percent effective stopping moderate severe cases, preventing hospitalization/death. 

They're less effective preventing people catching/spreading virus, especially older people typically problems inactivated virus vaccines. life goes on... Lol yes. meant 'not cold'. may [latitude also determining transmission rate.  recent data Israel show people gotten vaccine much less likely spread virus? question avoid namazi? Still early, since mass inoculation phase start least two months. Better prepared like Germany build staff sites advance Trump 20 million unaccounted vaccines somewhere last mile distribution pipeline nonexistent. meant infection rate still fairly high. lockdown open lockdown point? 

It’s useless lockdown unless trying eliminate problem nobody came plan besides waiting vaccines case Europe worse position US terms vaccine procurement Frankly I've always lived fairly, um, reserved life, little ever allocated ""entertainment budget,"" earlier travel, friends place get together NORMALLY person. one hand, much loss go shows live music restaurants, since never much (though long enough I'm starting miss little did). other, actually EASIER get together distant friends, since everyone stuck online also coordinate travel. actually social calendar covid. 

As well, working home means stress commute tension coworkers. like watched, people shoulder, open office, that's constant. like noise concentrate, good luck open office. work circumstances improved well. 

I'm actually anti-social introvert friends, well-suited place way life covid. restrictions tilted playing field somewhat favour.  im confused example Johnson Johnson coming vaccine? Wouldn’t better spend time resources manufacturing working product researching development own? Assuming none variants blow US I’d say government mandated restrictions lifted September, possible exceptions masks international travel.

Some states keep masks longer due uncertainty happen next Winter next Spring, probably won’t mandatory anymore. likely won’t legitimate reason enforce anymore point. Yes masks distancing would still apply even fully vaccinated It’s fair assume vaccinated person exposed covid, would substantially reduced ability spread infection. infectious period, assuming they’re percentage people get symptomatic infections, would presumable shorter well. 

But, supporting data covid vaccines prove yet. soon, unlikely vaccinated people spread covid.

If friend got vaccinated week ago, may time full immunity develop yet. believe Pfizer two weeks second shot, sure Moderna. another classic trait. Avoiding questions questions. sure increased amount since chat leaks. oops mutation goes brrrr Conservative republicans care rest world. even point Australia is. EU never signed contract saying shipment initial doses vaccine currently approved Europe come either US UK. 

Ergo orders 'due' sent either place. Even EU commissioner acknowledged this

 sure remain convinced otherwise. seems like absurd game cannot won. know spreads, see here- thought gone kaput. But- *it comes back*. Shutter everything hit nuclear button response. Guess what? *will* likely come again. 

The lockdown eliminate it. came back. Guess might work time though, right? 

Again- seems like silly fools errand. exposed receiving vaccine 317 infected hospitalised; that’s 5% hospitalisation rate among infected.

They started vaccine campaign vaccinating elderly 1) much higher likelihood hospitalized COVID-19 2) less likely make good response vaccines. hospitalization rate people vaccinated start look better time goes on. takes weeks final shot vaccine fully effective. bunch hangovers.  don’t understand international travel still happening kind insane. controversial want life back. whole point comment quarantine years come, months dangerous society flu (due vaccines natural immunity). one takes extreme precautions avoid flu, one going take extreme precautions avoid covid point either. click bait  Ahh...there's third number popping again. Great. Totally deserves Israel gets Almost vaccine Made Germany, funded German tax money. would need pay andhbhakt? play King Hill theme car way Plus long term side effects could occur? know you, entirely trust company court knowingly pushing carcinogenic product decades market.

Perhaps scrutiny put aspect, overall less effectiveness vaccine. would refuse Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine honest. company shady. civil. Yeah agree, think would best look terms percentages.  Media gets paid viewership benefit society unfortunately. Yea WA Lockdown 2: Electric Boogaloo Wasn’t like even last year? Germany almost restrictions summer. large events got cancelled. Everything business usual still low number cases. lol. Looks like cell directing force towards reddit well. Here's one andh bhakt assuming belong opposition. Classic Trait bhakti. worry get 15rs tweet different reddit? many million vaccinated

That’s wrong way look it. vaccinated people didn’t come contact virus time frame.  **DAS UKRAINE** Look again. explain like I'm five would solve problem? cases underscore many variants could already circulating Brazil raise concerns among scientists co-existence two strains body could speed mutations new variants co-infections generate combinations generate new variants even quickly happening,” said study’s lead researcher Fernando Spilki, virologist Feevale University Rio Grande Sul would another evolutionary pathway virus,” Spilki variants bring risk greater transmissibility possible resistance vaccines currently developed. delivery UK, Israel US, course. Better ignoring reality. 🤷‍♀️ Oh ya, definitely. Gonna real disappointing kids show teachers there.

Good luck though.   600k amount vaccinated people exposed virus though. 600k number of...vaccinated people. don’t know many exposed stayed home. need control group comparison. school year wash. friend mine elected daughter remote learning whole school year back August, turned smart decision. say keep learning remote next August things fully normal.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ah ok. Seems weird look terms absolute number since high population states always going near top since receive vaccines. smaller states vaccinating population much quickly, less people. Federal response; novel idea! Advocating celebrating someone's death illness result ban.  believe shots Jan 20 inauguration can't stop travel EU, utterly impossible. Oh really mean “still same”? fail see single parameter DK better SE US. 

Lockdowns efficient making number new cases go down. Look dates implementation lockdown measures always see trend break downwars within weeks. lockdowns lifted cases tend eventually go again. Unless lockdown long tight practically eradicate virus. European countries except Finland Norway failed this.   poor Mississippi delta? Yeah unfortunately that's way.

It accepted because, need phone scanner app verify cards, nobody want enforce that. Building apps hard. (Apparently) app says 'no' customer money says 'yes', people probably stop using app.

You collapse card existing ID like driver's license, database say ""This ID number vaccinated"", scanner scan ID human match face ID.

But done, vaccine passport easy fake it'll get fucked up. I'm staying home another months.  Let put one straight: UK relies production capacity EU wants contracts fulfilled. EU depends production capacity UK wants contracts fulfilled. One side getting deliveries. side gets whole lot shit media ""obviously stupid read contract"". 

But that, one EU suggested deliver bought vaccines UK, long manufacturer also fulfilled obligations EU. they/you deal anti-maskers there?

They blessed science based leadership Trump-like hindrance, still, coming disgruntled US citizen Aussies,

/s :( never released. time morons right now, need set strict example. ""We need condom babe, Covid."" reading thread shows lacking critical thinking are. 

Citizens cannot leave, cannot enter without wait months, masks mandated cases, people say life normal yet blame people normal activities. 

And life certainly back normal worked decimated aviation, hotel, tourism industries. Much still closed, despite told, domestic tourism offset that. “When comes number vaccinations”.

I didn’t say terms percentages. Queensland New South Wales sound fancy comparison think silly too.

Good Tasmania original name.  I'm even trying... would curious schools colleges someone wanted post that. got beating Avoid topic political comments. Lol changed reply. I'm sure know better multiple scientific studies conducted. linked fucking lancet source, get solid that. disagree that, (somewhat) We’ve always safety measures pathogens.  Uk Company fails create enough vaccine = eu joke?? You’re smart one. hundred schools closed. Nowhere near majority, ones closed much shorter period time.

Again, old enough actually remember 2009? question why? surging? airborne now? people quit taking precautions? hyperlink broken parentheses link. think there's way fix remember how. I'm going past URL anyone wants follow That's around 1% population given dose within 24 hour period.  1.13% population eligible vaccine (Any adult). 99.4% survive health system cope symptomatic patients. everyone gets once, number climbs quite bit bye bye big chunk population.

Also nice link youtube video timestamp summer.. go end december see people wearing masks (when required to) malls, etc.  What? they're using RTPCR tests much could be, tons people tested positive simply quarantined home.

You're moving goalposts. I’ve noticed personally richer area less seem give fuck. Malibu wide open, little mask adherence. Beverly Hills too. oc Riverside literally protesting masks since day one.

In Denmark positive tests sequenced, combined high test rate (almost 2% population per day) low positivity rate (&lt;1%) numbers Denmark perhaps accurate there.

The lockdown bringing infections R(0) = 0,7 beneath British variant growing week 3 make 13% cases. medio Februar British variant dominating driving numbers. seems B117 growing around 60% per week even current lockdown..

**Current lockdown measures** (from medio December):

* schools closed.

* shops open food related health related.
* Restaurants: take away only.
* Mask mandated public transportation indoor public spaces.
* gatherings 5 people.

**Additional info:**

Danish R(0) numbers generation 4 days think UK uses something like 6 days.

Numbers still smal uncertainty high'ish.

Data (in Danish): ‘Next’ button way right, you’re cell phone, literally can’t see it,” US official export ban, UK also bans export AZ vaccine untill 100 mln doses produced them. That's pretty much hoarding. hope enough leftovers help Canada... feel really bad live NJ people r/newjersey think should’ve second lockdown Mid-October.

Personally, think it’s shown restrictions costly responses like FL appropriate path... due luck. compelling scientific data guiding FL decision leadership smarter better leaders states. fact decision seems mainly predicated FL tourist based economy, way state wants go issue it.

Once we’ve vaccinated there’s nothing meaningfully we’ll get manage best possible updating vaccine required. Unfortunately means people get sick die we’ll accept that. already accept around 10,000 flu deaths winter without second thought, we’ll accept Covid deaths well. Hopefully vaccines keep number relatively low either way annihilating entire society everything makes life worth living suppress insane. Redditors want socially distance rest lives (I suspect it’s made little difference lives) screech internet people wanting actually live again, they’re free so, they’ll overwhelming minority. Everyone wants vaccine able received one then, there’s logical reason shouldn’t go forward. I’m sure people find non-logical reasons shouldn’t, though, probably depend state. Florida? 100%.

If people wanted ditch masks distancing tomorrow, could. recommend it, would way enforce it, realistically. So, let's wait least vulnerable covered shots generally available. EU/Germany would perfectly within rights build BioNTech factory use without shame, gave technology others make factories like AZ vaccine.

As EU-AZ contract, legal debate read believe breach contract EU's case weak. EU would brought lawyers behind scenes rather press conferences claim strong. read interview AZ CEO, claims EU application late, went ahead even though EU knew difficult ""super stretch goal"". correspondence AZ EU - would interesting check that. Everything contract talks ""reasonable best efforts"" - clearly weak promise.

Also note making vaccines like manufacturing widgets. biological process difficult get correct improve yields. quite possible everything gone right, doses would delivered. Normally factories take many months build full capacity. late order EU helped here. Also note AZ failed deliver much larger fraction doses promised UK EU. problems getting factories working cases.

NORMALITY 🚀🌕 would Navalny, Russian Nationalist ties neo-Nazis, ever considered Nobel Peace Prize? know they'll vaccinate Brazil given Bolsonaro's denialism. difficult question answer. First all, vaccine prevent infection symptoms? latter, strategy already borked. Second, target group damn large. priorize fairly inside group ?

 contrary strategy benefit working even vaccine preventing infections providing us easily identifiable (and let's honest, easily manageable), reasonably small target. lost 1.5 years college experience. friendships damaged. I'm gonna still sleep well night knowing many others sacrificed things save lives. Friendships repaired. Lives can't. Cry it. Yes severe mental illness. I’d rather catch every cold flu live like forever. “overhyped” sense get death sentence case extremely small percentage people rate Israel won’t good guide us vaccines reduce figures locked populations events like this. Tbh talk normal, don’t want bullshit “new normal” outdoor gatherings required masks. 

Normal distancing, masks, full capacity indoors. Thanks goes on, revaluate politicians. much longer U.S? get people like give easily

False statement. get soon take it. However, wait vulnerable vaccinated moved vaccinating general public.  tested though? surprising study Germany showed spread among young children missed weren’t tested. deeply sad. absolutely scientific evidence variant evade vaccines. Somewhat reduced efficiency way different vaccines work. Anyone implying so, including news outlets, spreading misinformation scientific backing.

There also evidence actually ""new."" recently sequenced. Could everywhere months. current wave US could contain infections many variants.

The people talking summer fewer restrictions generally want continue, least subconciously. think find thought going back normal, even justified, terrifying. kind PTSD. Wow! Y'all lucky! can't get appointment anywhere within 2-3 hours major city I'm in. that's looking appointments anytime April. got word opened appointments website crashed everytime finished selecting time entering info. appointments gone, I'm stuck waiting release more. like weeks. Pharmacy websites same. incredibly frustrating. 

So parts US clearly together, process still massively inefficient.. Ok, say ""no one 100% safe everyone safe."" considerably accurate less inflammatory. I’m going back normal summer regardless anything. 
Y’all fun though 😘 Case point We're going herd immunity 2022 whether everyone gets vaccine not, whether anyone likes not. NJ? Yikes. close comfort. Doesn’t mean don’t care Covid (I care myself) young people losing much older comfortable people sit zooms enjoy family. don’t care younger generations all. Ok hypocrite considering invested life seconds ago lol. Stay locked 2022 idc already study public health think it’s stupid social distance deaths gone.

In Europe, people questioning whether vaccine real fake news got vaccinated. Pay 😍😍 think it’s case sorts rates you’d normally expect first months vaccination program. 

The outliers (Israel, US, UK example) extraordinary things speed up. UK US invested crazy amounts money risk unusual novel vaccines. could easily gone wrong £100s millions spent vaccines. turned well. 

Supply isn’t thing obviously, UK‘a success also due organisation NHS (and US’s despite complete lack federal organisation), approach supply side new clearly made big difference. Flu shots around 50% effective. J&amp;J perfectly fine. Ha. pesky northern Cornish, ever learn? Wait sources credibility matters. posting CDC links everywhere want speak track record? get ways know right? One would expect IFR lower India: population younger Western countries obesity rate lower. Oh, projecting now. Okay.  one safe everyone safe.
Makes sense. Brit group 4 vaccines don’t agree. strategy quite lot merit. plenty evidence 1 dose vaccine well 50% effective, maybe high 80-90%. it’s better double number getting protection get many people possible vaccinated. getting vaccine next fortnight I’ll able relax little bit first time months. Doesn’t seem fixed. Norway one million doses scheduled April, latest plan 800k October. Hopefully numbers improved. stop they're first &amp; foremost researchers institutions, academia encourages question prevailing models theories. always outlet voices, professional setting. think public (and news reporters) erred treating experts all-knowing, expressing one particular viewpoint. They're better pollsters predicting election. He’s caricature point. see 💎💉 Deus Ex again. know nothing life, dumbass. gonna waste time telling it. 

Hope happy consequences actions.  thats true slogan... Social distancing gathering friends family? Bit inconvenience people. you’re referring social distancing 2m apart strangers (which actually physical distancing), sure inconvenience lot people sitting home months, Reddit, telling everyone else kill grandma. actually ventured out, they'd see grandma grandpa restaurants.

We can’t assume infected 24/7/365 Makes real sense least. fast currently vaccinating people tell anything stage epidemic. Israel's blinding speed can't open yet. India's (semi-intentionally) little bit slow we're practically open already. Israel coming peak pandemic, India's going months now. What’s exit strategy? Probably vaccinate close entire population wide array 90% effective vaccines market. Once’s that’s done open countries similar vaccine standards live life. Yes may community transmission it’ll hard spread entire country vaccinated. Serbia administering equivalent 400k shots day. remember Serbia known queueing habits efficient healthcare.

Oh, that's interesting. Thank link.  zero evidence public schooling leads population collapse legitimate theory suggest might. I'm 2 months nothing.. smell taste. almost year too.  UK holding back second doses. example Germany could reach target 1,5 million weekly vaccinations get everyone vaccinated September 30 next week held back second dose. CureVac expected release data late March, ready July, according Spiegel last week. thread posted deleted earlier week believe many doubts original studies accuracy amazes people buy this... 🐑 know taco bell terrible standards.. love I've craving since lost taste covid 2 months ago. No. I’m High school student remote learning too. don’t know anything child I’m glad working you. However also young child isn’t nearly much pressure students. high schooler, workload massive hard stay top of. also zero social interaction sports extra curricular activities. It’s fun us it’s hard. I’m glad child well they’re 2nd grade. Remote learning obviously going much easier 10th grader 2nd grader. main vaccine using AstraZeneca one

That's actually true, least Scotland proportion pfizer - astrazeneca vaccines public knowledge [75% vaccines administered far (about halfway page) current limiting factor number vaccines. two vaccines, would rather give one person one two people. think save lives latter. give second doses eventually though, 12 weeks first.

And AZ vaccine, account supply, proven work, even increased efficacy longer delay. Iowa, bad. Good news tho! Anti vaxxers go nuts news.  live rural NV. drove 120 miles husband's first dose. trying arrange second dose town. We'd drive 120 miles though. That's rural life. Can't really grow exponentially, like everyone gets vaccinated goes vaccinate others.  yet we're going hammer variants vaccines. beautiful thing, it? info many done England Scotland? mean, really think sticking swab way nose way. doctor, ventured guess nose, it’s mouth also. Funny..If Oxford didn’t licence vaccine even vaccinate people? still make early build mass vaccine sites. built ready go ahead time make things go smoother supply vaccines support them. think setting staffing vaccines actually get could good thing. pretty easy sign sub. I'd love share experience Gage Park High School teaching kids *actually* defend hackers. hahahahahaha expert spoken! isolation Uusimaa quite ineffective, say least. also lifted like 2 weeks, deemed unnecessary. Finland also shut time European countries, opened time, locked downed nearly extent countries afterwards. Isnt mayor pretended side protests lied wanting defend police instead hired patrol house 24/7 people protested crazy policies government, imposters. thank politicians, thank scientists Actual data facts - place kind content today’s society. Let’s stick hand-waving generalizations obscure references fit agenda instead. agree you. seems like could real possibility. 

However, don’t think current political/cultural climate, society whole wait kids vaccinated opening schools. nothing that. stand solidarity teachers point, advocate protection. Oh no! Deja Vu, I've seen headlines million times. vaccine getting people tho, might finally last time pops fucking cares? Needles arms! Yes, exactly.

And UK rights first doses made wait initial doses.

If like it, start pushing government leave EU. Would put money Scouse. Manc push.  That’s 300 million infected Indians, thirty times official numbers. looks like approaching herd immunity hardest hit figures much higher many cities, strengthening epidemiological theory cities country may approaching herd immunity evident falling daily numbers new cases,” said official associated surveillance exercise. “Like previous two surveys, seropositivity found way higher particularly urban slums generally urban areas compared rural areas"". yet VAST majority, flu leaves damage. Also, respiratory damage one ever-growing array symptoms suffered COVID long haulers. Right. ""corner"" store 50 miles away places far west Texas. used it. Pretty much every time modern history novel pathogen started spreading we've taken urgent measures contain it. let SARS, Ebola, etc. go wild ""safety pathogens absurd notion"". problem covid difficult one contain probably since Spanish flu; current measures would utterly crushed SARS Ebola even enough keep this. I'd lot interested breakdown reasons refusal.

I manage staffing team across three sites uptake approximately 60%. reasons medically valid, reasons based personal belief. worth replying ignorant post, minutes free time.

The vilification woman returned several negative tests, person pizza restaurant, person shows true nature posters. went 34 places matter days? life 'normal', not, 3 negative tests 14 days quarantine, scanning QR code?

Again, perception many died, virus transmitted, wrong indeed. shocking media completely brainwashed society believe this. endless posts great economy completely overlooks decimated industries. come, recovery longer coming years. Meanwhile country directly responsible hundreds thousands dying starvation Fiji, Bali, locations Pacific. certainly hope increased foreign aid substantially offset that. 

Most world really fearful anxious. people working around restrictions, ignoring entirely make sense.

I'm well grounded reality, continued travel around much globe. spending lot time Australia, reponses surprise me, although disgust developed society could disintegrate way quickly. conditions AZ vaccine specifically non-profit production maximise access protect vaccine nationalism. vaccine came license able freely produced elsewhere cheaper sinopharm, sinovac sputnik. 

It's important remember uk government say too. Lots people saying university demanded that's simply true. Due funding, uk government direct say partnership. Lol wait till go college. Coming someone graduated college 3 years ago, College like 70% virtual learning pre Covid 30,000 student campus. computer life college. person homework turn physical quizzes, someone remind every day something it’s online. 

Hate tell e-learning High school prepared college person learning would have. misunderstood Fair enough. Thankfully dropped briefly, hours trading, quickly went 130 160 220. government loosen restrictions spring/summer too, last year even without vaccine. cannot degree nations already elders protected. experience Australian American Melboutne wild. friends colleagues generally known COVID serious shit stuff like visiting friends regional areas renting Air BnBs tired home. Basically staying different suburbs weekly.

My cousin straight give shit would hold parties weekends travel corners Metro area work.

Another co-worker going back forth Bunnings moved wanted paint house.

The kicker people manage trying get write blanket travel exemptions even though exclusively WFH.

Even news see people partying beaches they'd get labelled backpackers, even though borders closed evidence foreign.

Don't get wrong, well, experience response people crowing right thing dobbing people finding loophole possible right thing.

There way luck involved success anyone wants admit. Important work wish redditors read interact new science writing sub others. not, use bing I'm assuming group people they've tracked different stages vaccination. Hard know limited data explanations holds.  Oregon. no, ""want"" stay ""cooped forever"". want even less become infected something real potential severely compromise cognitive abilities can't work, concentrate reading, write. 

As far getting ""mad"" everyone else - that's all. normal possibility truly control. I'm sure people coming conclusion virus anywhere near point becoming something choose ""live with"". 

I would say relevant statement getting mad this: get mad authorities months people refusing take still necessary precautions start shutting things again. airborne since start. Wow. That's impressive. Thanks! guess misunderstood ""me, too"" movement about. get car warranty spammers call people appointments Also UK taking risky strategy delaying second doses

Everyone keeps saying this, risky. vast majority doses AZ tested longer period, proven efficacy even increases delay. that's even including public health reasons maximising first doses. AZ CEO says he's positive best option vaccine. 

And even single Pfizer vaccine sufficient efficacy. even overall efficacy decreased, impact individual would negligible. allowed subject matter experts work teachers far less red tape?

I’ve software engineer 30 years. volunteer little time local private school teach kids things public school teachers never know: *actually* defend hackers , keep data private, etc.

I’d consider teacher I’m going school two years get certificate, investment time worth it. events still planning full steam ahead, even heavily restricted areas. One comes mind Electric Zoo labor day weekend NYC. UK contract EU contract, right? First take care people help others. like donating charity enough money family . Normally vaccines provide better immune response longer gap. Tests AZ vaccine showed this, recommended JCVI, expert panel vaccinologists immunologists. significant long term side effects, especially effects affect children teens, would’ve definitely discovered now. long term side effect argument useless small handful cases actually long term effects, vast majority cases people old pre-existing conditions.

You obviously aren’t student parent. don’t know struggles parents students put entire pandemic. Also far I’m aware, children’s vaccine hasn’t even entered clinical trials yet. children’s vaccine may available another year, even come out, administer doses takes longer. cannot wait longer.

There scientific evidence proves kids low risk virus schools open safely adults teachers vaccinated.

Stop. Moving. The. Goalposts. There's still buffet-esque things open right now, like pizza places near still self serve salad bars open, whole foods hot bar salad bar open, maybe couple tweaks. surprised buffet style restaurants come back over.

Yeah completely agree, experts said tweaked adapted reason people far experts like keep saying virus mutate render useless.  Oh CHYYYYYYNAAAAAAAARRRR  One things Hancock got right. fair, Australian open happening city 2500km away one positive case today. beginners... best effort clause limited producing initial doses EU EU. 17 locations one case already, including convention centre five supermarkets.

Further point know acquired ppe. lot learnt variant he's got - impossible comes back even catch work stage. We'll know lot day two, hence breather. Hehe must live different countries called Australia take it.

The one thing heavily individuals control - social distancing - happening much. Luckily, federal state governments (primarily states) implemented strong measures prevent spread virus. luckily perhaps, general apathy towards defying authority Australia allowed measures implemented. 'all' population. talking subject 'herd immunity' discussed. Let's look point view virus, call 'Mr Ms V'. 

It begins V find new happy home, there's problem. V limited time abode. end time either landlord kicked comfy home falls pieces ie patient dies. Now, landlord kicks V change locks. V can't get anymore (unless change appearance article suggests). rental period V come upon unguarded house move into. Otherwise wither die cold, cruel world. 

When V hits town endless houses, locks, life good. landlords become aware V, however, takes poor virus longer longer find unlocked door. V's chances plummet, eventually poor thing almost certain die homeless. 

The development vaccine fits metaphor sense someone taken upon provide landlords locks case V drops by. usual epidemic pandemic develops. likelihood locks/vaccines totally ineffective. fact close utterly impossible. means percentage people infected length pandemic reduced certain factor depends effective vaccine is. 

Now, 'telling telling'. virus become studied virus ever exist. huge amount information, much information still dispute. upper levels governments completely *totally* dependent advise much greater number experts various fields, experts know almost entirely open public. public knowledge. can't hidden. capacity rulers given country comprehend matters varies, course, fairly intelligent, humble willing follow good advise mentally incapable uncaring except interests. example politician high mental capacity would Angela Merkel Germany, research scientist quantum chemistry 1989. crowd much thicker lower end ladder. 

The trick few, perhaps none, politicians world today capable forming anything beyond educated layperson's view problem. many, without naming names, incapable grasping even view subject. 'Intellectual' 'orange-assed baboon' points limitation; can't 'hide' things common knowledge amongst experts. may make statements meant frighten create false optimism (""it Easter""), that's do. facts there. that's left play emotions - really ""hiding"" anything. case guaranteed address issue government delivered expected modern developed nation. rotting mess continent made ordinary look extraordinary. Shout Daniel Andrews amazing response covid pandemic. working lungs. sends SWAT teams arrest publish data like. random police checkpoints, would check home address license. excuse traveling 5km home essential work receiving healthcare, essential workplaces issued government documents distributed workers allow travel. 

This primarily metro areas, rural areas course could live 5km nearest supermarket might need groceries. Rural areas impacted much covid looser restrictions. Daily death rates best way confirm lower number positive tests. Unfortunately data 10x noisier due small numbers, also lags another couple weeks behind test trend. Wait another weeks get better picture metric. 

Looking places peaked couple months ago, like Wisconsin Dakotas, also substantial decrease deaths. Fuck yeah, way go cobber! Bring Trans-Tasman covid-free travel bubble!

Sending thoughts pav cuzzy NZ. Ah, thanks clarifying. It'll come back transmission pick 5 days, gives good idea general infectiousness. That's really telling perspective regards overall willingness take collective responsibility. live soon mask mandate came effect literally overnight places like shopping centres went minority people wearing barely anyone so.

I’ll trying day. don’t know country live in, America, Pfizer Moderna happy make lot money selling excellent vaccine whoever wants it. take longer get shots out? Yes. lot people know difference Gucci Dollar Tree happily wait. 

The mRNA vaccines also adapted quickly variants. Vaccines like JJ 2021 stop gap also-ran every first world country. States done similar things Florida (Mississippi, Louisiana) also much worse COVID numbers, explain that?  probably focus vaccine programme Ny times daily  Lockdown started hour ago. ones arguing it. vaccinate vulnerable, open fully (NO restrictions all) - give rest doses developing countries? I'm good that.  going hypothetical thread 1 % population dies. Obviously won’t actually happen. area... Rejection adf directly related supporting hotel Again, NZ's population actually quite dense clustered handful cities. true Australia. US less urban either countries. course US manage federal level. individual states charge managing pandemic big. NZ would rank 25th population state.

Only US states already overwhelmed start pandemic. 40 states chance require anyone entering state quarantine two weeks, using phone electronic monitor make sure stayed put. could done 4 week NZ/Aus style lockdown (not half-assed ""lockdowns"" US states did) brought numbers elimination level easily states. Meanwhile thread ""lockdowns work"" Everything said spot on. International News, even made BBC, '***a*** guard tested positive'. would concerned bats getting infected, specially **Brazil**

Well, fuck. seems prescient Except told states open borders prematurely, joined Clive Palmer court case WA border closure, close borders international travellers late, besides those, there's zero evidence. believe you. know people obsessed shitty chain restaurants. also know people put selfish desires family even health. Sadly, much like addict, people *want* change behavior themselves. muscles mean healthy .... getting jacked protein shakes ton carbs, equal health. Yeah sounds like owns thing covid actually quite hard catch

[citation needed] US never closed land borders traffic Canada US US Mexico continued. one, Canada would starve death US food/produce, close border. 

Stop spreading fake news. Yep, much smarter better everyone else. That's is. actually looked authentic experience people lived lockdown Wuhan, would know food scarcely ever available requests help anything routinely denied. Yes, Chinese government half-ass locking people up, also care happens next. right, excess death would favor us. drop us 10 spots we're still bottom 15%. really matter much grand scheme things.

You think handled thing wrong without believeing economical reasons. Nice. Even small city 300,000 people total cases deaths Australia has. research Wikipedia, nice! like completely ignores fact 9 months straight without case calls McGowan joke.

Ignore ignorant fool. really hope ks right place ask , really need info

so im jordan , thankfully vaccination started elderly priority , propably need 4 5 months minimum get vaccinated (my prediction)

but dont choice picking vaccine take due shortage vaccines now, dont get pfizer , take chinese one (sinopharm) ?! 

no matter ask gets deleted , experience info needed Yeah guys almost cases, better 30% population getting it.

You can’t distance kids, that’s groupings, that’s masks, ventilation.

Kids transmit less per CDC, seeing idea ventilation works somehow doubt know CDC.

It’s gaslighting go facts.

My kids home, schools don’t require masks community spread chart reduction transmission isn’t nearly enough make safe, looking prestigious private school region requires masks, HEPA filters installed, ventilates much hospital. That’s still one less kid local public school, it’s win-win.

But really need learn bit spouting nonsense.

PS can’t refer recent studies provide none all, especially CDC disagrees ignorance. seem think ""barricaded homes"", closer ""be less fucking stupid please"".

So lockdown then? actual lockdown ""be less fucking stupid please""? big deal Australia close borders. ever happened before, 1918 stop spread influenza. questions whether illegal due constitution. 

People still vote premiers state leaders unlike US, leaders successfully saving thousands lives. think Australians make big deal though look Dan Andrew's went through. Despite fantastic job things considered. 

I really see said solid reason border closures work US. free get fined anything. Specifically, aged like ice +50°C summer Western Australia work Melbourne Canberra every simply work.

Have actually read contract? have. requirement use “best reasonable efforts” lawyer speak “we’ll try best can’t promise anything”.

The reality EU dropped ball one. Consistently late place orders consistently underspending per-capita comparison UK. time, wasn’t need regional identifier order differentiate emerging novel viruses threatening global pandemic. obsession calling “wuhan virus” driven ethnonationalism.  current naming variants emerge comes place legitimate etymological need. British factories used supply EU's orders soon contractual obligations Britain's initial order carried out.

Honestly, considering British vaccine distributed Anglo-Swedish firm cost, called ""selfish"" ""whores"" it, would much better distribute grateful recipients, organisation spent last four years laughing us reminding us alone left little club. sub full people assess risk social distancing much risk vulnerable vaccinated

I’m public health major, two friends die virus, worked covid disinfecting covid test lab... it’s safe say respect virus. states lift restrictions deaths gone. Sometimes mechanism causes higher infection rate also causes higher mortality rate. Increased viral load infected, example suggesting report field hospitals setup? Seems like news me. still infect people vaccinated. People like wrong planet.  Fucking finally something proud of! Happened NSW/Qld border well. least 50% deaths come 15% population, make huge dent number people dyeing quickly. opens hospital space everyone else lowering death rate even more. Haha, exactly.

Driving safer, likely require someone stay hotel/motel/airbnb friends/family. Unless live near border, somewhat understandable, provided enough vaccines spare. going limb I’m gonna say people traveling get vaccine believe science


This part problem. One ""believe science"" still uninformed. people need take evolutionary biology course actually *listen* experts say: need limit spread vaccines administered may render less effective possibly even altogether ineffective. virus mutating faster predicted rampant spread. lot people recovered getting reinfected genetic diversity virus continued increase exponentially.

To fair, parents got money. Feel free ask it.  Somebody should’ve taken one team. know I’m saying. 400,000 January 18th. fact, almost every single day (with exception 13th) fewer 1 million, many 300,000 600,000 range. 

The sudden jump attributed faster vaccinations possibly also over-reporting day (vaccines 19th 18th reported 20th). That’s amazing. kind news need moment. Numbers great putting people context like makes even sweeter. I’m pleased family! Depends definition “over”. Covid gone? don’t wear masks? deaths hit 0 per day? Anyone ETA reach 80% vaccinated US? Looking forward longer wear masks :D That’s really interesting. I’m suprised isn’t spoken more. I'm quite sure plan vaccinate every adult wants it. 

However, Australian stuck overseas cannot get home, question long term plan bringing citizens back. They've ten months work they've done *jack shit*. planes sit essentially rot, start laying experienced technicians, x-ray specialists, etc, getting exact people back happen, retraining process joke. much harder restart.

Morons. one hoarding. Every vaccine produced used. Pfizer Moderna supposed deliver 200m doses end March. think possible. dose response (ie virus exposed sicker get).

Not sure that. source this? Perhaps **might** (operative word here) help reduce, eliminate, risk getting severe lethal case, viral dose factor. bet also factors (general health, weight, immune system, risk factors, etc.) determine prognosis. suspect viral dose *may* play part less severe case *for people,* factor, much *factor weighted* respect factors varies person person can't easily quantified. people getting treatment like ivermectin population average age like 25 thereabouts. literally makes sense.

I said LOT, all. go million day next 30 days, bring total # people vaccinated around 60 million. That's still, again, lot.

I hope grow learn empathy, dude. need youre studying know I've read that, news broke 60% shortfall, specified would impact Q2 well even though AstraZeneca know much yet. *laughs beer, bbq guns* Gap. Watford Gap, Watford. think small part M25 North. Switzerland (where live) soft lockdowns numbers exploded. really seems depend lot factors.  aware lockdown Finland? happened? saw Canada implementing something similar, 72 hour hotel quarantine incoming travellers..... don’t wanna downplay disease you’ll like fine dude. age range chances survive probably still 99%.

Keep us updated symptoms though like! don’t overanalyze them, you’ll get this, I’m sure. Hope get better soon:) Less people indoors??

Unless cutting arms legs off, probably fewer people indoors less.  mean estimated least 150,000 people enter U.K illegally year. 

Technically possible search every single vehicle, patrol North sea, Atlantic, English channel fleet boats etc. 

But huge undertaking requires lot resources disruptions supply Australia ever faced. UK decent response instead taking seriously, would put rest Europe shame.

I agree you. U.K superior position relation many European neighbours. would stop well short suggesting U.K isolated easily secured geographically Australia though.

Also saying Australia's actions would achieve similar results countries - assuming countries implemented same. suggesting implementing measures much easier variety reasons Australia versus countries. remote island big one factor. Scumo bogan version Trump. know yet. Even cold big deal old person. know severe disease end endemic state everyone level immunity. Even interestingly, Finland also limited lockdowns compared European countries. closed restaurants schools last spring that's it. smell filters. Yep... exactly like that.

This shocked face. J&amp;J process testing two-dose regimen. ENSEMBLE 2 results released yet imagine it’s matter  enough make terrible choices... want everyone else make terrible choices. validate own... prove free... 'er something. 

I lay now. 

By way, live New Jersey, can't imagine anyone getting away it. Maybe literally worst state cases early per capita (yes, worse New York per 100k, *still* worst per 100k despite lower overall numbers rest 2020 'til now), Governor instituted mandatory masks early everyone it. May even June, remember going list wife thought states mandatory mask requirements public, true. like one two states did. said New York? Nope. Even NYC, ""guidance"". 

So NJ, even people I'd never think would follow rules wore damn mask blind-sided news coming summer elsewhere. think cause people aggressive even they're something disagree with, expect everyone else same. Nobody pass opportunity say, ""Hey, gotta wear it, gotta wear it,"" Target wherever. Parents telling parents tell kids put masks on. I've seen people get leave, never fight back ""muh freedumbs!""

The ONE time early forgot social distance line mother's day cards. walked cards realize line look cards stay distanced guy yelled goes, ""Hey man, social distancing, we're social distancing, get line!"" said realize sorry, cause right next line register. guy said sorry, appreciated understood. fuss. muss. protested, everyone else line would joined chorus telling STFU, get line, get store. 

So kind risk yelled public even people wear one lived state. times like I've appreciated living state filled many loud mouthed assholes. likely accurate far know saw comment someone one threads said let 4 year old play kids anytime last 10 months. normal US? seems extreme detrimental children's developmental health happiness, especially considering low risk children. No, not. johnson johnson they’re still testing.

The Biontech moderna vaccines good come. offer near perfect protection. likely won’t get better that. 
Plus I’ve read second shot time comes “severe” side effects. imagine third shot would amplify problem. bring link coal varnished thing first look nice clean. Everyone keeps saying lockdowns work measurement place stop spread coronavirus. 

Recently cases Sweden Denmark skyrocketed, fact cases deaths adjusted capita higher Denmark short period time. 

The actions taken different, end worked way, drastically slow spread virus. 

First listed different measurements I'm sure wikipedia source would better justice. 

Yes, Sweden 11.000 deaths, yes, Denmark, yes Norway, yes Denmark Norway combined. there. need reach convince vaccine safe good idea get. I've read 1 6 skipping vaccine enough keep nightmare going indefinitely (calculated based spread rate). France also social economic mess government always indulges population's unrealistic demands. True.
Austria 2 weeks November. Another 2 weeks added whenever lockdown end within week.
Exception december 8th 25th (for christmas shopping christmas).
7th feb next aim numbers really gone (8k 1.5k day, decline kinda stopped around 2k. Became slow since then) bu luck shopping yesterday. I'm good next 2 weeks. Alex Jones gonna love headline. try spin however want. We’ve 435,000 Covid-19 deaths US less year - equates 1.7% OFR way, “less 1%”. Something didn’t even exist year ago *third* leading cause death 2020. FFS talk scare-mongering headlines...

VIRUSES DONT LEARN

With crazy high rates cases USA, SA Brazil virus chance mutate.

Some mutations transmissible, may increased vaccine resistance.

The solution slow viruses transmission

1) Masks

2) Lockdowns

3) Distancing

4) Vaccinations

Once rates low enough contact tracing quarantine positive cases contain local outbreaks vaccinations time rollout take effect. Truck drivers Australia moving freight across state borders lockdowns tested every 7 days. far aware still frequently tested, every week now. keep away internet might resolve itself. interesting. look [Norway every person arriving overseas gone quarantine. Anyone plane someone covid locked room without windows 14 days.

His career bad blame game. 

For adult life, public servant. career really took getting fired high-paying public sector jobs (he former head Tourism Australia Tourism NZ) due corruption issues. master cultivating relationships high areas, falls 'up', down.

Australia's news media mostly pro LNP (the current Coalition government), many them, particularly News Corp (which also owns Fox News US) defend Morrison death. Media fawn him, releases streams announcements gladly lap for. well-known orchestrating Australian Federal Police raids trade unions media outlets badmouth him. 

News Corp extremely aggressive pushing climate change denial tear apart politician thinks taking action climate change. fact, truly owe power Australian people - attained power News Corp led smear campaign first political opponent LNP, constantly done everything keep power.

**So far, career corruption, creeping authoritarianism, dedicating nation's resources protecting fossil fuels. also supported media protection racket.**

**In 90s 2000s, LNP Coalition government introduced superannuation tax concessions, negative gearing franking credits (dividend imputations), whilst eroding media concentration laws. mechanics laws complicated, put simply, ensured older segments population got much richer expense younger generations. effectively created loyal voter base (it really vote buying). Due large size older populations, younger progressive voters destroyed polls gigantic tsunamis older generation votes (particularly Boomers).**

A picture emerges. pisses nations treasury buy votes older generations. probably wants establish fossil fuel dictatorship. Covid arrives.

The way handled pandemic absolute sham. way, would going way UK. Thankfully, state premiers (equivalent US governor), imposed harsh restrictions gave regular press conferences, thus bypassing him. Morrison interested Hillsong conference (his favorite prosperity gospel-preaching church) stopping pandemic. Morrison basically dragged kicking screaming action. real heroes state premiers. **Our secret sauce handled pandemic well lies states mostly ran show.** 

You may remember Melbourne particularly nasty outbreak leaked hotel quarantine. Victoria's premier copped lot flack weak quarantine practices also happens master deflecting blame there's 'everyone's guilty time everyone's guilty' atmosphere. Morrison attacked VIC premier, stood ground. outbreak VIC fully brought control, Morrison took credit Dan Andrew's (VIC premier) actions (like everyone state).

**So disturbing picture emerges. modus operandi fairly simple. Hide tough situation, blame anyone slips up, take credit situation resolved. Thank god Constitution gives state governments large amount autonomy.**

I love point people talk easy transport low efficacy vaccines. 

I’m individual need live “easy transport” vaccines.

I don’t want get covid all, “mild” case long haul symptoms still possible.

That’s completely rational position. 

Make excellent vaccines. I’m already low risk hospitalization. I’ll wait. Things like make understand death cults happen. Australian, personal freedoms lost?

Genuinely curious Yes, I'm certain one remote places planet played literally zero role spread. Certain aussie states really. We’ve time within expected time, closed one case, 5-10 Ditto. Must know this. Amazed, now, done kind satirical sci-fi movie. Remind UK inaugurated? work fine, right. anyone know clinical trials...

1) tested see 3rd shot Pfizer Moderna yielded significant improvement? limited supplies issue, hypothetically, would 3rd dose boost 94-95% projection 99.99% would redundant/superfluous?

2) Johnson &amp; Johnson test 2nd dose vaccine yield significant improvement?

From little I've heard news, understand Pfizer &amp; Moderna different vaccines (mRNA)...and always better, curious 2nd shot Johnson &amp; Johnson included trials, so, results.

TIA hire suitable people pay decent wage. See happens listen scientists Call crazy, maximum penalty 6 months prison speech violation literally opposite 'more freedom'. I'm sure US far behind trend thought policing though, seems getting quite popular late. QR code mandatory surveillance app?

And general, form punished homejail committing crime huge loss personal freedom. mitigation long running shitshow enjoying better tho. think take vaccine, you’re probably vaccine game rest year lot people need get vaccinated. 

I’d say people already risk hospitalization (diabetic, hypertensive, weight, etc) take JJ better isn’t available. 

The calculus looks different people high risk playing avoid long covid. know fair number people happy keep living slow small waiting excellent vaccines become plentiful. It. Is. An. Opinion. Piece.

* develop vaccine Spanish flu pandemic. currently many effective vaccines covid, way.
* Spanish flu much higher infection fatality ratio covid, unlike covid heavily impacted young, healthy people.
* Even though Spanish flu pandemic officially lasted two years, restrictions near widespread lasted much shorter time period current restrictions. people ask ""when pandemic end?"" mostly mean ""when life back normal"" rather ""when declare official end pandemic"". case Spanish flu, people life abnormal months, nearly abnormal life covid. local GP trickle these. small % first dose appointments shows GP wants use doses. people get phone call 4pm “if get 20 minutes second dose”.

Now runaway new coronavirus.  2 months solid governement response control efforts could perhaps prevented 2 years printing money dump economy well lot misery. opposite I’ll true though too. going people take vaccine, still get covid still die, rates we’re seeing now. could mean still news outbreaks still happening steadily 70%. think vague prediction policy threshold. like think us around Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire Leicestershire ones speak correctly. all, could even recognise us spoke? bears around much here.

2 different things. true. Trump would've elected, beating Tim Kaine. would given credit saving America crippling pandemic economic downturn. would also mean fanbase would likely crazier 4 years Clinton far emboldened commit authoritarian acts. universe zero covid right strategy lmao? Good luck lockdown next years lmao Dope comment bro. That’s unfortunately herd immunity works. Need every possible person get vaccine get ASAP. district uses zoom gotten lot better. 4 ppl zoom day spent 400 bucks upgrading router etc two us hardwired Sorry 😞 hear passing. there's 4 day festival go every February President's weekend. type event last thing would brought back. obviously cancelled year, guys think 2022? think good shot it. think end summer people vaccinated. Hardly major change; main one blood test valid 24 hours instead 48 hours kinda nuts. One week hear awful US terms supply / halted vaccines, OMG YAY WE'RE BEST.

Hoping latter. I'm sure would've done something similar deaths cases planet Sometimes question ever end nth British strategy based evidence, data proof legit thing.

They failed first wave, failed second wave, failed tracing infections, lockdown since early December tripled number infections deaths, instead reducing happens normal countries...

Lets see whats next new strategy. country gov ridiculous ,just sorry Brits. protection provided grocery store employees, food processing workers, essential employees work health care? Oh that's right, get wear mask job. Teachers exact thing. ppl trained administer shots literally couple weeks. saw one article saying nurses aids straight 6-month allied health certificate programs sent vaccination sites. brain surgery. dunno. ran woman hiking cat backpack said husband Air Force doctor said there’s way one effective vaccine Science! clearly vaccines nefarious plot. supposed believe?

PS: Yes, really ran person, really said this. believe husband Air Force doc. actual shots certainly delivered service members medical training. branches military active duty members medics, emts, nurses, doctors, etc. Here's little homework. Choose sect Chabad/Lubavitch (don't want explain right now) look leader is. find is, look net worth. find number, get answer make difference. emergency use approval approval mean Greta done peace Obama Didn’t guys election? remember seeing campaign posters visited early 2019 I’m pretty sure federal... ship millions doses month. Ten vials , 60 shots even missed.

It mistake.  Pfizer ceo, take first shot national TV. 

Remember victor Kim. believe much bought company? vaccine safe, im gojng give wife kid. Evidence actually shows closing schools one largest ways bring R value. Stop repeating nonsense ethics, also PR. start lifting restrictions vaccinated people hope rest country comes senses.

(Depending whether vaccines provide sterilising immunity, may need anyways. would arguably unconstitutional continue restricting people pose risk others.) Complaining people broke rules month two carried wait. Short-term sacrifice, that.

But guys, we're year in. can't blame people acting like humans. understand many people died permanent health problems exactly describing, right? people ""shamed"" victims here. They're punched at, punched down. know states Melbourne Avalon support literally plane planet. Isn’t likely Brazilian variant? Yeah think called air raid wardens OK sure. Feel free supply source “forbid” statement then, seeing link posted (from 2 days ago) says “encourage”. think little small flighty make difference context. fun throw though. actually hard tell apart effects vaccines season, real test next Autumn.

And yet summer fall put 'miracle vaccines' regardless. mans 100 years old, anything fuck age. Oh completely agree and, unfortunately, many people medical field don’t understand science. also think equating quick development release Pfizer Moderna vaccines untrustworthy, also misguided. Masks aren’t normal. wow, consider informed! Covid-19 bad, knew?! /s Yah considering teacher inner city Chicago. Come dude. yet fall put vaccines... silly nonsense. Read contract. AZ committed delivering x y. opted fulfill it, instead servicing clients UK.

Little lag. zoom meetings, couldn’t worse Maybe shielding rather holidaying Barbados might better approach. 
Yeah, suck hero worship. I’m also scandinavian, lived life Denmark also extended periods Norway Sweden spend quite time Finland. currently Sweden.

If cannot compare Sweden Norway Finland based population density, certainly cannot compare Sweden (22,9/km2) Denmark (135,1/km2) reason.

If it’s true 80% Sweden’s population lives southern third, density still 53/km2. Less half Denmark’s even European countries.

Sweden’s state epidemiologist repeatedly claimed Sweden comparable Netherlands Belgium neighbours. [map population density Europe clearly shows absurd claim. Swedes seem believe now.

That someone Sweden necessarily mean know stuff truthful. swedes fiercely defending strategy image. ok long start asking restrictions protect think vague prediction policy threshold

Exactly, formal policy, rule thumb. analysis, scientists, including Boston University US, discovered close 18 existing drugs approved US Food Drug Administration (FDA) could potentially repurposed combat Covid-19 soon person becomes infected.

That sounds promising. wonder ""close 18"" means? what's colloquially known 17? Since every vaccine - far publicly disclosed - using spike sequence (or spike inactivated virus) antigenic peptide, I'd expect roughly efficacy across regards mutants. second dose acting booster also increase efficacy towards mutants - increases level circulating antibodies. Since antibodies (but most) generated towards receptor binding domain (or RBD see mentioned) - higher circulating titer antibodies, chance antibodies bind side RBD, mutations concern arising in, giving efficacy protection becoming infected, getting ill, spreading.

The thing going us immune system slacker, sit go ""okay well saw particular spike protein - I'll make antibodies bind exactly spike protein perfectly"" - memory B cells actually mutate respond secondary challenges (infections) - meaning immune system essentially trying ""cover bases"" virus seen may mutate slightly antigen recognized important note anthropomorphized bit, please understand immune system ""aware"" goal ""in mind"" son's school district held person classes since August, virtual option. district 40,000 students. 15% virtual. Last week 73 reported cases among students, 30 among teachers staff. vast majority cases junior highs high schools. elementary kids spreading much. They're taking precautions trying keep kids enriched. wear mask blend follow rules tbh I’m super paranoid. Got covid november nothing sniffles, that’s knew overhyped stupid virus was.   Hungary relies them, holiday Barbados recently maybe that’s not. comes comments ppl claiming can't possibly another year choice viruses. 

In sense choice. People choose behavior engage in. Indefinite lockdowns virus like simply work US. 

Vaccination path out. mean /r/dankmemes? Thats I'm talking about. districts already programs speed type people provisional teaching certificates. Still enough ppl. “Sticking points two sides include vaccinations staff, testing, work-from-home accommodations health metrics schools reopen shut pandemic, union leaders said earlier week.

The union wants staff vaccinated required return work, weekly testing staff testing students neighborhoods highest infection rates. CTU also wants people able work home high risk severe coronavirus complications live someone is.

CPS agreed increased testing staff students work-from-home status high-risk employees, according union. district’s plan would allow 20 percent workers live high-risk relative work remotely.

The district also agreed prioritize vaccinations staff hardest-hit communities union said details offered. two sides also remain odds improving remote learning, forgoing simultaneous instruction disciplining Pre-K special education teachers defied district demands work person.”

CTU seems pretty reasonable demands honestly. Except last thing — idea what’s that.

We’ve treated teachers like garbage long, finally found breaking point? can’t imagine anyone wanting get field seeing readily parents politicians toss life away top shit pay. lockdown US. people vaccinated reason it. hope really hit targets US next months start sending vaccine Canada.

I know we’ve fucked things too, hearing guys vaccinated 15k people nationwide makes incredibly sad. 

After JJ news, think June entire country vaccinated point we’ve probably got enough produced monthly Canada left weeks. favorite part first began clean grocery items worried surfaces We're thrilled them. /EU like : wear mask safety, people angry wearing one mask. go like fuck you, ain’t wearing mask unless I’m high risk area.

Those people aren’t satisfied anything. Don’t give inch, take mile. probably cautious

We can't afford excess caution. need normalcy asap. UK part EU. We're talking EU. also remember are. Reddit Internet general tend overhype media stories variants. don’t know restrictions totally lifted summer guarantee end year things largely back normal. aren’t people make so. serious vaccines also mostly effective contribute spread deadly disease could prevented it, mentally ill psychopath. charged people organized fine person outside happen again. first time history rich man used high wealth power cut line.  Ok.

So saying felons, wife beaters, etc . sudden become moral ethical.  see become role models. Ok.  believe you. agree saying. That's kind point making. comment replied said getting vaccines arms worth risk letting people travel state. individual vaccinated, well may true, point out. society whole, risks outweigh marginal benefit. point.

Tell me, what? Way reinforce ranorn227’s comment definitely enough vaccine without full J&amp;J order. need maybe half, probably less. awesome think about. virus already R0 estimated 5.7, 50% virulence makes 11.4. average one person infect 11 people. It’s also airborne, aerosols travel AC, linger air, one survive surfaces month. don’t think people clean think are. really wanted prevent infection, still 5% chance infected eyes. There’s reason healthcare workers take many precautions it. Hell, found damn thing food frozen. really monstrosity.

I read change surfaces, least stores, Cupric Ion live 4 hrs. even use masks (just don’t eat it). Everyone really upgrade gear - I’m making filters furnace filters, shop towels, cloth mask tape around respirator. 

I read theory says even Pangolins Bats common ancestor, still would needed intermediary host. look genome, intermediary would minks, cats, dogs, domestic animal. wouldn’t crazy say Cats/Dogs could harbor virus well infects us say.  fucking imbecile, proof ridiculous claim yours? Yeah... origin think, slur Inuit people  would need also assume small percentage won’t develop antibodies similar ways, others may naturally waning immunity still others get vaccine even though infection likely get sick due antibodies. last group large. Many medical workers getting vaccine today virus. acknowledge reality. act like cultists guy left office do

Israeli ad hoc sturdies indicated 1st shot 33% effectiveness among elderly. course preliminary data, yes gives Ah, thanks! chance original article (English preferred, could google translate it)? saying lot cases coming ultra-religious cities/parts cities? 

A lot hospitalizations deaths. Cases even Ultraorthodox TFR 7, enormous families living small apartments. Add top general compliance get hesitant vaccinate follow social distancing 

This bit complicated. Ultraorthodox split different communities. larger one fine vaccinating, smaller ones anti vaxx mindset non compliant.

To lesser effect true Arab population, also comparatively non compliant (less big gatherings also less masks) anti vaxx, Arab towns 3% vaccinated.

You need realize Israel burning huge wave started vaccination campaign. British lesser effect SA mutations spreading throughout population, led increased hospitalization younger people. single point evidence happened anywhere??

I know Italy, leave dead people homes due either staffing issues worries disease spread. starving death ran food; died covid. barricaded keep telling geography made difference. Funny closing borders apparently obvious move, yet US UK never thought it. UK even island! Kind speaks level incompetence took badly. 

But evidence says poor governance messed culture doomed US least. all, closing borders enough NZ Australia. took massive lockdowns extremely high compliance rules achieve it. right could never worked US, geography. old lol need take closer look. Lockdown works. reason cannot control COVID opened holidays, starting merpmorial day, independent day, labor day, Thanksgiving, Christmas. Look COVID chart, daily number increased week holiday. Lmao close guantanamo dot com isolated capital*  Finally fucking good news 🙌  talking speculation long term effects then, I'm pretty sure read poster talking rubbish letting brits die? 
If anyone 'left die' vulnerables without access vaccine, favour vaccinating healthy, mostly asymptomatic, risk persons neighbouring countries. 

As said though change like would ever happen, attitude posts fine example why. grateful people like accept obvious risk jobs like feel sympathy got sick.  I’d wager don’t, here’s list. recommended release years British get nice less fortunate people It’s really wonderful  comes covid-19, Australia basically like 8 little countries populations ranging 250,000 8 million. According [research Lowy strict border controls, trust government effective contact tracing testing crucial ingredients success controlling covid-19. I'm sure mild climate hurt either. US cases dropping. Holiday surge hopefully whole thing done get vaccine. Can't wait 65+ risk start getting vaccine watch deaths drop like rock   saying vaccines useless advantages situations.

But US expecting 400 million doses Pfizer Moderna vaccines US citizen I'd pissed getting one work well company sold cancer causing baby powder. I'll believe promise 100 million June see actually happen. one thing company fall bit short projections, Pfizer Moderna extent, J&amp;J missed 90% more. 

Time tell whether J&amp;J really ramp things 100m June slow start, I've noticed couple experts news shows pushing message we'll enough vaccine even without J&amp;J. must joy around holidays /s  I've ""trapped"" Perth years I'm fine. reason go anywhere else. today like virus even exist. masks, people going out, people living normally. live best part best country world. mind stayed way forever. Congratulations AU!!!

You've earned mates.

when rest US learn? I'll drink that! except us Australians loved ones overseas wanting reunited with, sure guess others situation perfectly happy content things are. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* subreddit done it. I've read ridiculous thing life ever. They’re also island nations smaller populations. Really big continental islands, islands nonetheless. Huge advantage controlling movement countries. I've often said renamed rare sense. one makes nuts. skin temp low walk days would probably unfit work due hypothermia. Aint one fever gonna register high. Wooooow. actually didn’t catch that. first glance knew supposed “th” “rd”. Saw “th”, brain passed it, saw “nd” knew wasn’t right. Ok, completely insane. hope you’re joking that... common virus evolve becoming infectious, less severe, etc.

This common (slight) misconception. Viruses mutate become less severe, mutate become infectious. Sometimes becoming infectious means becoming less deadly, dead host spread virus. sometimes becoming infectious lead becoming deadly well

I'm trying alarmist this, though. like covid evolve 10% mortality evade vaccines except taiwan new zealand even iceland way ahead us handling covid better, resort extreme measures. Tried whatever crime makes ok us imprisoning them. 

If there’s nothing release them.

The United States declared independence Great Britain 1776 secure Americans unalienable rights. rights include, limited to, ""life, liberty, pursuit happiness.""

Thomas Jefferson, chief author Declaration Independence, using word ""unalienable,"" claimed two things human rights. First, rights given us government. even government respect them. Second, cannot cede rights government even consent. cannot taken away us, cannot give knew something deadly, you’d try help. hope. Yeah, honestly lot statistics suggest one major national lockdown month progressive stimulus could saved us much trouble road. point, could flipped state state basis address different geographical needs. missed window, already lost fight. US simply big control without draconian lockdown response would neither legal politically viable either side. way compliant countries are. good bad thing guess. Yeah it’s 0.8 many restrictions place. rate doesn’t validate getting rid mask mandates. Herd immunity goal getting rid masks like least offensive restriction place. Things like higher capacity limits, certain businesses reopened happen long public mask wearing over. Here's proper link: format links brackets reddit use `\` `(` well `)` :

  [original lancet give this:

[original lancet UK taking seriously though? mandatory quarantine system incoming arrivals? experts here, go r/COVID19 Oxford 90% efficacy second half dose. think due post holiday surge over.  yes, tennis, tennis stars able go australia ahead stranded australians keep getting flights rejected. tennis apparently matters australian lives. Yep. play rules neediest served first, jabs better. 

There’s many anti-vaxxers shrug shoulder anyone circumventing rules point. Uhhh, guys, think might something wrong. Still, USA, USA, USA! don’t think prioritization period. We’ve seen every time aed requirements vaccination slows process. send rural areas refrigeration hard everywhere give people option. I’m sure many people want one shot jump able take J&amp;J. Especially consider J&amp;J likely introduced tail end vaccination schedule Pfizer Moderna live word.  excited open bag chips indoor party clothed friends number fully reopened conditions?

With lockdowns, plus vaccinations, plus social distancing masks, there's perfectly reasonable explanation decreasing cases eye protection except can't afford travel another state borders shut time outbreak occurs. also, talking peaceful, qld minister begging jobkeeper payments extended due tourism industry decimated. ministers prime minister basically ef coming ideas take back stranded australians overseas expanding quarantine. sure, peaceful here. another outbreak occurs hell breaks loose shut downs border closures. they’ve massive influx vacationers. feel like half people know willing travel went Florida year live Oregon... Ask injected polio chicken pox vaccinations I'm 100 % sure problems that!

There difference vaccination vaccination - term people perceive view those. cannot group together one group. whole lower half country far tropical paradise.

The UK taken measures Australia have. we're subject, anyone else see people grocery stores without masks right New Year's? went store one day, saw like 1/3rd shoppers wearing them, vaccines means magically disappeared. Kind annoying, bit news makes hopeful. would answer question way saying affirmative I'm happy it. putting fucking words mouth condescending, touch... Troll.

Just would answer question way mean I'm happy. respondents. I've never met single person happy this. I'm real hard time believing real, normal, American understand this. get point point b except disingenous? Shhhh everyone, don’t tell people like we’re island paradise otherwise they’ll want come spread ignorance ooops mean....

Yes turing12, completely right. Oh woe, misery Aussies in. TRAPPED. Lo, suffering oh no. Please saaaaaaaaave us torturous land cursed walk. God fucking wish Australian actually looked (this publicly available information), would know every residential community/apartment/block designated community workers/volunteers handled groceries, prescriptions, necessities people allowed leave.

When central government wants get something done, half-ass it. Geographical advantage honestly think is. Northeast states tightly linked highways several densely populated cities. You’ve got NYC Philadelphia within stone’s throw other. Florida’s cities nowhere near packed, spread out, one breaks top 20 largest cities size. Maybe. even mild seem affect systems body flu. I’m sorry don’t believe feeling actually widespread. Like doubt people aren’t gonna socializing much bigger scale cases negligible older people vaccinated. mom basically complete lockdown due high risk vaccinated end february going back living life. People keep reading headlines public health officials recommend projecting view others get mad imo. Think fact people already socializing capacity cases deaths far worse. find hard believe people going opposed people socializing may. Question might know: concerned virus’s mutations potentially affecting vaccine effectiveness? ok lost two people knew week. permitting citizens return, even dying see dying family. allowing citizens leave. Hardly success. point we've already figured scientific, logistical, regulatory framework distributing variations vaccine every year. use similar principles covid, variant comes resists vaccines significant extent.

Right now, signs point existing vaccines working known residents. Hopefully case, need get covid shot every year I'm good stepping back line, too. ability work home order necessities delivery. visit doctors via cell phone pick prescriptions contact drive pharmacy. handle waiting days might take vaccinate group opportunities. Glad help contribute solution. :)  actually kidding right now? There’s entire section dedicated there’s enough evidence acknowledge it. Literally even CDC even confirmed it.

But yeah random reddit user named klocks knows better doctors scientists. Keep living fantasy world, peace. You’re missing forest trees. There’s history medical experimentation “black bodies” (lol dehumanizing phrase) countries. Yet vaccine acceptance similarly low. 

Even within America acceptance vaccines tied directly education income. weak proxy one talking vaccine acceptance among black people US admitting. It’s convenient US committed illegal experiments black people throughout history. It’s reality reason black people every western nation less likely get vaccinated. point is, don’t fight black anti-vaxx conspiracies assuaging fears Tuskegee experiment. Rather fight education vaccine does. deluded assholes need awakening. glad line.  really wonder people like get information.

It's bad enough process something like 5 day lockdown draconian, information wrong start with, like double fuck up. Came across article talks future generations cells can't replicate mRNA.

""While synthetic mRNA genetic material, cannot transmitted next generation. mRNA injection, molecule [guides protein production inside muscle reaches peak levels 24 48 hours last days.""

That makes feel better blast radius small, enough get immune system prepared fight spike proteins.

Let's hope many variants spike proteins! goal posts shift Pro-death protesting new. seriously know? old 2002? yet spread dropped. Estimated national R 0.8  avoid acknowledging people content healthcare. strange. Yeah dude anything wrong.

If anything, bit process rigour around staff working quarantine hotels order. Seems bit odd people floating around places work heading home community. deepest condolences family people got start taking seriously I'm wondering they're making analogy comparing microchip manufacturing vaccine manufacturing? There’s two cases I’ve seen people somewhat suspiciously couple days getting vaccine US. said it’s possible would died anyway even that’s case 2 22 million pretty good odds. Definitely better odds dying covid several orders magnitude. would definitely make problem worse fair, usually governments announce lockdown specific amount time ends going much longer that. mean, dude equates use vaccines resulting expected outcome notion vaccines work. Def. sush def. proof confabulation happening online. I'd trust girl high school, though. used hottie?  Sanitation, separation, masking weapons we've available far. vaccines another arrow quiver. virus longer find host, die out. Economic recovery occur overnight. president trying get 100 million doses 100 days. 230 million people still wait story told. Hope best...we less year pandemic, things looking up, bit. Stay safe can, last forever. Florida’s climate pretty comparable Southern California kind recovering one worst outbreaks date US despite one strictest lockdowns. 

Maybe don’t much control respiratory virus. controversial opinion, think point, people get vaccinated better regardless are. 

Of course people prioritized, honest straightforward people are. teacher get vaccine entire classroom full kids return school parents start working again? type-1 diabetic higher risk severe illness? hospital donor - special treatment means new wing care others, say isnt worth it?

The closer get herd immunity via vaccination, better. far enough everyone. live planet 3 billion people. raw numbers eye popping don’t put perspectives people used dealing with. 2 million sounds like lot. 3 billion it’s really. Classic tried gay? Solves problem zero cost illness! New Zealand Australia liberal governments strong civil rights laws managed China-style lockdowns eliminated virus. NZ also place anyone testing positive close contacts regardless test results, state-managed quarantine facilities. Little rant COVID death numbers. Really hope come conspiracy theorist.

New York City major covid hotspot beginning pandemic. Tokyo also major international city hit virus. Now, take New York's population density compare Tokyo's. find Tokyo's population density 2.5 times population density New York.

As May 1, 2020, New York reported 13,000 total deaths, Tokyo 97 total deaths. means ratio covid deaths residents New York would 1:669 people, Tokyo ratio 1:237,000.

I understand cultural difference, especially far handling pandemic goes. safe assume leaders eastern countries far pro-lockdown pro-restrictions U.S leadership.

But still, numbers seem *very* here. anyone calls ill-informed, let's act like New York rank among tougher mask mandates lockdown measures, especially late spring early summer last year. There's disconnect, really hard ignore. Again, trying come anything. I've peculiarly skeptical since day 1 needs brought light. long face? spoke soon  Nobody take joke ugly book ha ha. `Preliminary results show 60% residents one district Delhi antibodies the` antibody rate districts 50%.` 

And means 10 million people ever get COVID without testing out.

&amp;#x200B;

Still ""**NO TEST COVID**"" chance get Chinese vaccine, get Pfizer/Moderna one couple months road, safe take both? countries historic economic shrinkage well. There’s free lunch. Thank goodness! It’s aren’t never “locked down”. 

I’m big city gaining weight, decided go get gym membership. Thank god didn’t online got least 150 people masks. 

I told never mind left. Nice Ahh yeah. mean, there’s always older shows People Gitmo get vaccinated move group includes incarcerated, like people US prisons. we've denied American rights mean last. FOURTY people. Close damn base it. country rebelled lockdowns masks first? created problems terms handling pandemic start?   visited museums? Yes. UK much worse Sweden. Feel free post link wtf work well they’ve three times. 

Weren’t least two shown implemented r0 peaked? add 16m see still short 1.5m getting 2.5m per day.   Florida right middle US states metrics population adjusted basis. really empirical evidence he’s wrong states nuked economies worse covid numbers? could sleep night definitely gonna happen. We’re pace vaccinate enough people stop spread necessary wear masks may. Ridiculous claim. course work, people actually take seriously.

We say brushing teeth ""doesn't work"" kids well get cavities baby teeth. 

If nobody went anywhere anything, spread would stop, end story. understand feasible, say instead.  Agreed. Asking lectured immediately proceeding lecture, i'll same.

Most mutations neither detrimental beneficial spread purely circumstancial. mutations offer advantage facilitate spread (like infectious causing less symptoms) therefore obviously better change spreading widely, circumstance luck still play huge role.

Your argument relies variants competing other, necessary far know even probable. However scenario, correct, circumstances would make spread vaccine-resistant strand likely partially vaccinated environment. Unfortunately multiple infections much thing, although quick web search really yield information current Coronavirus mutations.

There ""pressure"" ""favoring"" comes mutations evolution, throw-stuff-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks process. Ha, fuck brexiters  Hell no, UK take care first! It’s even done vaccinating itself! Covid Zero go history right strategy. say microchip? InfectFest 2020. Visit family bring home surprise! someone prone anxiety, SA variant really freaked out. I'd never thought look actual case numbers. Everything seeing kept yelling contagious strain is, never occurred case numbers anything skyrocketing. 

I know sincerity always common reddit, seriously... Thank taking time comment this. googled graph made feel lot better. Good News! around Go back MGTOW whine there. Doh, read ""vaccines slowly spreading virus already"" Exactly. people gone full cult. repeat repeat repeat... teen, I’ve committed homeschooling like day job, severely depressed. cares right? must selfish parent wants kill teachers! No, teachers failing children claim love, claim “passion” for. Yet despite calls “follow silence” time... suddenly science doesn’t suit fancy. Kids largely don’t contract, pass, COVID.

Dear teachers,
Us parents always back unions speak raises, levies ballot, etc.
But guess what? You’re fracturing alliance teachers parents. government paid employee, us tax paying parents won’t stand much longer! warning... will. mom’s teacher, one good ones. see saying “one bad Apple spoils bunch” really apply here. Especially union politics involved. Get back work care iota kids! It’s year! They’re suffering irreversible damage! help understand something. get vaccine I’m safe COVID? still contract Covid without spreading it? spread get infected? exactly vaccine do? Covid hasn’t nearly much issue lot poorer countries general age group younger American kids overweight Even New Zealand would consider intense reaction single case. 3 cases South African variant escape quarantine facilities last week so, one woman going holiday around Northland visiting 38 locations symptomatic. even institute social distancing, let contact tracing handle it. guess WA experience cases slipping past quarantine scarier them. help understand something. get vaccine I’m safe COVID? still contract Covid without spreading it? spread get infected? exactly vaccine do? 2% Washington’s hospitalization cases Pediatric. 
And entire state 750 Covid patients hospital right now, I’m going call bullshit one. Vitamin doesn’t slow infection rate, severity infection. made whole week!! I’m happy y’all can’t wait widespread distribution. mean go 48 rolls toilet paper 5 days? Aaannnd take board US. Looks like we've got 2 3 second streak goin - Nope. reset. again.

Forgive frank, I’m stupid people. I’m sick it. year made lose respect many people - family, friends, coworkers, etc. consistently shocked willingness believe debunked conspiracy theories outright object certified science.

I’d pissed unable get vaccine bunch prideful uneducated morons prevented happening. It’s sad cannot clean air....Though light can. Please keep mind, even vaccinated still carrier!!

Very scary blinders seem going people safe! Bingo takes handful point mutations right places virus completely evade immune response. don’t need seriously change spike protein. that’s got said, go ahead obtuse. hope get better! blessed 🤠 good, right ? Utter idiots filling shops everywhere. Panic buying resumes full pace. 5 days. People shopping year. I’m curious see post Covid world. J&amp;J also tested new variants South Africa. We're different pandemic pfizer/moderna tested. deaths important others? Yeah first time modern medicine we've virus infects potentially billion. Given large enough petri dish, many mutations occur - real question whether new mRNA-based vaccines sense herd immunity counter reproduction rate enough curtail exponential growth.

The flu operates ecosystem equilibrated into. We'll see covid same. hope not. variants we’re finding confirmed actually functionally different wild type strain. spread faster and/or better job getting around pre-existing immune response. There's strong public health consensus collective conscience West Australians, really Australians. still contrarians crackpots, general mood sucks, necessary. knuckle down, work together, get side one piece.

Disgusting. still expected stay away non household members correct?

I got hopefully resume normal life... won’t necessarily end it, think summer rolls around much better place assuming vaccinate (and J&amp;J approved soon). don’t see restrictions going away fully like mask mandates public places, things look better deaths hospitalizations drop drastically next couple months Get 'em. Well duh Thank you. Might ended ban. right thing. I'm also frustrated fellow Americans.  also unlucky 60% first production batch failed. EU might get 30 million vaccinations instead planned 80 million purchased third billion euros first quarter year. Shit happens. could happened UK US didn't. that? reaction arm pain became swollen armpit, assume lymph nodes there. didn’t say anything lockdowns

As far masks could find studies fit point view. studies show masks offer protection infection 

Do mask nutters go far? Yes. Right type saw woman walking dog wearing mask. 

But I’m going 7/11 instance makes blood boil someone store without mask. Wear fucking mask. It’s fact masks offer protection. April may-june depending state. Victoria second long harsh lockdown July October. big would AstraZeneca's shortfall US EU approved vaccine December?

No different, since stipulation doses need provided Q1 2021. first, want discount people facing, awful various post-viral syndromes always forced deal lack adequate care. hope pandemic spur researchers figuring out. said, syndromes end, though may take long time, they're essentially rare outcomes people so-called mild disease. long haul symptoms highly correlated hospitalization, correlated age, vaccines, even J&amp;J, stop happening 100% time. vaccinate vulnerable, done spring, eliminate societal risks long term disability covid. fact constantly using phrases “emotionally invested” “narrative” downplaying vaccines suggests raising point good faith, troll underlying conditions take account? flu vaccine? guys drive 100s miles buy favorite soda pop, big fuckin Texas, makes sense. phase 1/2 frequent measures, sure everyday dream getting vaccine April UK basically boat fire rather put fire, they've hooked big engine get dock quicker. That's necessarily bad goal boats going lot extra damage. people wearing masks (except Police) I'm sure heard bbc news UK put order rest EU 3 months later ordering theirs? EU never signed contract saying shipment initial doses vaccine currently approved Europe come either US UK.

The EU/AstraZeneca contract specifically mentions 4 production sites, 2 EU 2 UK, vaccines supplied. Housing density multi generational homes. virus worst housing vertical. anecdotal, sister nurse primary care physician’s office. multiple patients die COVID-19. every person color works office refused vaccine. needs noted HR file, need sign release hospital/clinic responsible infection, move on. agree another poster said cannot make special accommodations forever. 100x worse antimaskers. least antimaskers want end madness, though proper time. Also, you’d get less depression antimaskers people like OP talked about. absolutely way 95% people 30, even remotely close doesnt much matter outside everyone drinking. packed together shouting face face placing bets races arguing back forth didnt win. source say anything like idea.

Yet complain intellectual honesty reading comprehension. know shit yet opinions insist right. Bellingham got second dose, 15 minutes. walked in, sat chair, got vaxed, sat observation area 15 minutes. also clearly ready double amount people they're time, half chairs waiting area used (and spaced appropriately) way cubicles actually Vax area people give shots. Probably waiting supply!  really. UK ordered first airtight contract.

EU ordered late wanted delivery first. EU trying steal UK doses. Serum antibodies, plus convenience major studies use multiples 1 week (7 days) reporting Anything that’s opening staying open. We’re point return speak. We’re opening restaurants 25% tomorrow. vibe Michigan weeks they’re told go back caves see many say fuck chance fines. sad :( story heard months ago examined tissues people back died kind symptoms, identified anything unusual?  Nobody force case ""Eh maybe I'll book second maybe won't"". 

Everyone gets scheduled second receive reminder possibly angry call surgery turning up. Missing appointments without good reason get unprioritised future appointments. Blowing appointments gets put back waiting lists. Natural selection... like Montenegro past summer. Stay strong! add up. Either ""brewing"" takes . months AZ learns late low yield, explaining late notice. takes days maybe weeks, AZ could fixed without much fuzz. Fixing *after* causing stirr make sense all. Also, production cycle short, lose much production once? ""I cant find fucking PS5.""

Abraham Lincoln take vaccines UK order, would breaking contract too?

I know keen pin blame solely AZ pretty clear European Commission's handling shambolic.  🥅➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️🥅 event possible breach contract compromising vaccine efforts EU, due possible stock leak, done.

But diffused quickly, suddenly production capacity AZ improving vaccines delivered all. Actually, Portugal highest death rate worldwide since British variant rapidly spreading travelers UK. Due AstraZeneca shortfall, vaccination almost ground halt now. headline bit misleading Yet another thing* I’m sorry, it’s definitely rough year pharmacy world, took personally shouldn’t have. definitely need staff get, could pay competitive wage would give us staff. “there pandemic” people, feel there’s going “there’s still pandemic” people well reach 70% vaccination. Ikr. countries first job protect lives citizens. US done vaccinating summer, supply sent countries. People like criticise us lot, give much thanks US involvement vaccines world...pfizer, moderna, novavax, j&amp;j would either exist manufacturing capacity without US. finally found upside Brexit, boys! cross burn somewhere? It'll take two weeks see effects.  I'm sure would saving lives allowed?

You've following EU's vaccine programme? Funny maybe 8 10 times always wanted live there. Besides Covid situation sucks it?  contracts per quarter though Pfizer/Moderna said fulfill them. Canada getting doses end quarter instead beginning/middle. Canada giving weekly number doses expected receive January March contract. contract 4M Pfizer doses Q1 2M Moderna doses Q1. 

I heard Moderna/Pfizer diverted doses Canada US. source that? far know Canada's Moderna doses come Spain Pfizer doses come Belgium. US doses come US. guy economics.  First time heard sound right. Something lost translation? right (still tested 12 weeks though). everyone know Pfizer jab. may well work long gap, big gamble  went nationalistic forbid hinted forbidding exports vaccines.

Not even little bit true. Totally thanks Trump BoJo that

UK giving away IP Oxford vaccine free AZ producing cost. yeah, maybe thank prime minister Maybe soap irritates injection site?! know like 10 ppl vaxxed one mentioned that! Chances one won’t hang around neck. said it’ll happen next 6-14 weeks. Fourteen weeks mid May. third wave bad May eyes going turn medical community quite bit vaccine coverage then. mention amount people Budapest protest think may misread. Though see continuing go people cannot grapple large amounts daily cases/hospitalizations/deaths year unless affects personally. people thinking world's first vaccine. vaccines hundreds years specifically protect illnesses functioning society without worrying getting sick other.

We take kids get vaccinations small pox measles bring home lock rooms make sure spread diseases around. vaccinated specifically go society.

The policy makers people like Fauci lost way name caution. perpetually take cautious stance everything never leave bedroom morning. Summer 2018 best know it’s pipe dream, Covid cases/hospitalizations/deaths start plummeting, would love see corresponding plummet humanity’s reliance social media. That's government incompetence. …. they've partially fixed issue low yield. 

The issue never capacity, facilitates always capable delivering full order, low yield. think article quite bit truth it. people really *like* social distancing perceived morally positive acts think they're taking therefore really want end.  People turn nobody force them.

Saying I'm thinking everyone pro vaccine reason miss second one. Redditors

There's first mistake, thinking Reddit way representative population. essentially calling copy UK approach. Osterholm, director Center Infectious Disease Research Policy University Minnesota, told “Meet Press” expects see new surge infections “in next six 14 weeks,” thanks spread new variants like one first discovered United Kingdom. Looking increase hospitalizations U.K. spread new variant, predicted another surge U.S. usher “something like seen yet country.” 

That slightly concerning American's. Yeah go back word supply vaccines EU. 🤷‍♀️ problem so-called ""noble lies"" backfire extremely easily. could cause people believe bullshit keep us locked lot longer needed, could also even reduce vaccine uptake.

Think someone margins pro anti-vaccine. Telling life change can't protect others taking makes lot less likely take vaccine.

The talking point bullshit honest us. come way show proof vaccination There's way vaccinate entire world. also mention there's leader like jair bolsonaro anti vaxxers previously said profit COVID-19 vaccine pandemic stated prices ranging $3 $4 per dose—the lowest price announced potential COVID-19 vaccine far. However, terms deal AstraZeneca disclosed Financial Times show limits AstraZeneca’s public “no profit” commitments, company given power declare pandemic soon July r/COVID19_support heard News asked wife go shop immediately get masks. Panic started time got 2 minutes lock Announced Dont worry, tories utmost sell bit bit. That's true all. total 70,000 Palestinians working Israel, beyond two populations pretty much contact whatsoever (with exception small Jewish community Hebron). less 1% Israeli population. numbers completely insignificant terms herd immunity. Yes, thank gods eventually did. Still enough round one let alone yearly booster shot though, EU 440M people.  Agreed. stand shit going entire year well Reading comments threads sub people crying US “hoarding” vaccines vaccinated 10% population maddening. 

They really think giving supply countries right now. world make sense? Unfortunately that’s true. exact mindset last time went lockdown, couldn’t get toilet paper entire week. don’t pre-empt ended losing fuck even possible Belgium we've managed vaccinate 250000 ppl 4 weeks  That’s what’s weird it. think he’s bit jack ass he’s still saying “normal” summer. Saying “months longer” accurate. It’s literally 5 months summer. can't wait drink pint sun mates again! never said would, I'm also saying Brits handing over. consider hoarding. questionable safe life's exported. british variant spreading europe, Portugal spain already seeing huge spikes. ICUs already capacity. rest Europe going follow sooner would hope. UK 10% vaccination, Portugal probably around 2-3%. would lot good there. worried effect spread europe, give Portugal specifically;) send Manaus. 
Again meaning say, one country needs more, countries need selflessly hand over, there's moral high ground here. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

HAHAHA good one. party currently power fought sort border didn’t border security system, could done plenty stay home measures mandates prevent half million deaths.

Unlikely. way works ability shut borders. People /cannot/ sit homes three years. going happen. Sweden, whole country could've vaccinated two weeks. guess one upsides brexit ATM, Newsom strict restrictions California restrictive people say is.

Canada can’t produce anything. closed vaccine plants long ago. mean average we're around 1.1 million first doses day? mental list co-workers ""Most likely get covid"" list. moved ""Most likely get covid twice"" list. people going learn. one safe everyone safe expecting next days reporting low, ton vaccination clinics closed PA due huge snowfall.

Trust us, don’t close reason. south places close less inch snow, getting 9-17inches NYC times I’ve guest speakers come classroom - brilliant, accomplished people fields pertaining I’m teaching - they’ve bored pants students left listless zoned out. garner absolutely nothing talked at. Forget neighborhoods populations- you’re good teacher, doesn’t matter much. pedagogy imparting knowledge. truthfully, you’re downvoted it’s insulting think that’s takes. classes you’re brushing would show that.  Please stay away alarm system. many times need security escort out? It’s fraction UN mandated do. well, sanction armies *dave chapelle’s voice Brazil, never. EU part western world allows vaccines exported. US UK don’t. vaccines Israel produced EU. Canada got fucked Trump/the US. doesn’t fucking matter Pneumatic injection. Exactly, suddenly capacity improving right? Well UK supposed 30m doses ready end 2020 instead got... 0.5m. Ye boi get vaccine. got mine yesterday I'm feeling smug af. Second dose can't come soon enough. Nothing lol, take shower anybody think writer article would give place line order let someone Africa get it? don't. Manufacturing uk started April amazingly stockpiling even results trails came back.

All UK produced vaccines bottled EU Wrexham plant came online. 

Also don’t forget UK funded vaccine. I'm sure would allowed.

To feels like we’re slowly winning. Yes, need get quickly. Hopefully things back normal fall 2022. I’m looking graduate school NL AZ agreed increase supply. I’m freaked out, I’m sounding alarm. lot people emotionally invested false, premature narrative things almost over. attitude lead directly suffering death people relax loosen soon. 

Glad right things staying course. too. apparently thought fatigue jetlag changing winter mid-summer climate. got lot praise authorities religiously used Covid-tracer app, scanning every single business visited time 200,000 Kiwis actually using daily basis. use app let contact tracers feel confident could contain spread. Luckily infected anyone. Although poor vaccine response mainly due low supply currently especially AZ cutting back EU supplies etc. Hopefully supplies tight Netherlands ramp vaccinations I'd rather thousands deaths day living police state nonstop lockdowns. dad got Coronavirus vaccine today doctor told shower next 4 days.
Why showering vaccinating? context unaware, 100 year old gentleman walking 100 lengths garden raise £1000 NHS charities. fundraiser went viral raised £30 million.

Stop commenting thing 10 times row  I'm listening IDSA podcast right saying 0 participants 15k vaccinated subjects 1 20k moderna pfizer respectively got severe covid
I get data doses, really going assume can't deduce kind protective effect severe covid single dose?

No, that's absurd. know 20% 90% protection severe covid one dose, nothing would go long way reducing mortality morbidity. test centres close now? Like drive ones? don’t know yet...? Sounds like spreading misinformation. deregulatory race bottom nations lose; corporations win. obvious corporations like cooperative European approach, take words rights wrongs it? 

By granting emergency approval ahead countries, UK managed get vaccine first developed produced EU. everybody first race? Maybe Germany could competed even faster since funded development, leave 26 countries?

The fact AstraZeneca massively oversold vaccine quite honest statements media certainly blamed EU. AstraZeneca delivering hundreds millions doses EU, US, UK countries now. 

Everybody wondering AstraZeneca apply approval EMA December. Now, company announced massive shortfalls production days ahead EMA's approval, reason becomes obvious. approval granted, ""best efforts"" clause longer relieves company obligation fulfill terms conditions supplying vaccines per contract. 

How big would AstraZeneca's shortfall US EU approved vaccine December? 5 years left one wasted year hell lot. lot elderly people afraid death want enjoy last years. Forcing stay inside see friends family extremely upsetting many them. 2 weeks flatten curve, eh? pandemic/vaccine response awful end sight lockdowns. many pints celebrate! Probably part, probably stadium gigs masks public transport kind thing mostly normal. remember took pain relievers day two vaccine. anything do? take I'm feeling well.

AstraZeneca said nothing order coming late. Yawn Canada actually order Europe/EU production, US UK went nationalistic forbid hinted forbidding exports vaccines. Therefore boat waiting production ramp up. Say thanks Trump BoJo that. Youre still fucking there, dumbass. Stop acting like know everything private corporations. US, federal vaccine program done (under Trump) public-private partnership, i.e. giving shittons money national pharmacy chains. 49 states signed that, vaccinating relatively slowly. West Virginia, normally conservative, Trump-y state, decided let state government deal it, within weeks shots arm every healthcare worker every care home resident. Combination factors likely.

Well, worst clearly now. risk invidivuals vaccinate Easter. I'd expect significant drop deaths now. Please explain someone 'mind bogglingly stupid' capable getting Masters Economics Cambridge? Let's also remember little thing called WWII happening around time well. That's related case pandemic, practicing medical professionals make frontline workers medical reserve corps already busy dealing pandemic. enough them, maybe, deploy isolated public health crises nationwide crisis, we've seen reality past year. military reserve 1 million members professional military kinds professions, draft books deal wide-scale war equivalent pandemic clearly needs given we've lost people last year 4 years WWII. need corps volunteers outside medical fields trained appropriately medical non-medical pandemic work.  Also amount excuses come ok UK US keep everything bad EU (hint, , still exporting), laughable. That’s led NHS, rather someone Tory party’s mate rush normalcy, virus takes upper hand again.

If want normalcy ASAP, least make sure virus gain new ground.

You might able afford excess caution, might either able afford health problems virus brings.

That’s point. Covid pushed us adapting efficient models getting things done. 

Of course could take away post I’m happy covid happened cuz kid’s picture day doesn’t take long someone critical thinking skills five year old would think that. Delivery point current hold is. unlikely ever hold virus. Vaccine production hold problems distribution system rules.  actually huge capacity putting shots arms enough doses. also take week effective. reports coming time. really change here.

What *is* nice change clearly efforts aimed trying actually help states organize distribution (e.g., federal Pfizer/Moderna exchange marketplace states weaker cold chains) ramping federal resources aid distribution required. 

Right appear starting supply constrained. Hopefully Moderna Pfizer able hit original promises terms timelines - so, need start shipping lot doses per day (2.5 million day, &lt;1 million day we're hitting right now).  go explains simple terms That's I've seen it. Plenty EU Redditors willing blame UK US, even articles reporting exact opposite they're telling everyone. Friday probably worst it, even got downvoted providing sources told wrong. Although seemed calm bit EU managed piss Ireland. There's point convincing people, they're practicing british nationalism defending AZ. someone defend fact AZ able deliver 60% contractually agreed doses beyond me, regardless EU Japan updated number PCR tests performed since January 28th, 

Based kn happened before, test numbers tend delayed 3~4 days, it? Or, makes people less likely understand sick thus likely go around spreading virus. Omg whole comment even worse first one, can’t 🤣🤣🤣 Americans citizens? idea, I'm Brit think much medical care costs. country? get AZ costs UK mandated profiteering license. thing different tone couple days we'll cross milestone first doses positive cases. UK nation testing among major European countries. It'll speed massively. UK extra 400m doses ordered need probably go commonwealth EU. vaccine types come line (especially single dose ones like J&amp;Js) go around Also vaccinations people underlying conditions - I'm one booked Wednesday. already last year. ""Sorry UK we're unable ship 30M doses promised, we're shipping 4M doses EU pre-production stockpile way!"".  wonder they're taking 9M doses from. EU citizen, I'm really sorry!

No, didn't. sent UK produced vaccine EU filled fitted. basically, put bottles. commission looked already, mentioned since accusation bullshit. That's still good could hopefully mean pressure taken plants hopefully one experiences delays rest simply given one dose. vaccinated

They vaccinated, fully vaccinated. 

There's good reason believe giving 1 dose twice many people save good deal lives. 

This political decision, governments scientific advisors recommended. guess then. :-( Late signing bad contract, late paying upfront money everyone else, late construction manufacturing plants leading ongoing problems rollout late authorising use. compounded making asses trying divert anger towards UK risking peace Ireland.

Mistake**s** It’s AZ vaccine. Pfizer supplying Canada plant Belgium USA doesn’t allow exports. Cool story bro Go vaccine contracts tab Lockdowns work, many countrys strict enough ones. eg UK schools long closed. people getting packed buses every day go work working packed factorys.

I dont care says, making bouncy castles, parfums, anti ageing creams window cleaners upholsterers critical workers economy! Big fuck mans Justin Trudeau team raw dogging us Canada.

That depends consider vulnerable, UK passed half way mark top 4 vulnerable groups (of 9), groups make 90% deaths Covid. taken month get 14% country 1 2 jabs. ~100m vaccinations done worldwide, would need ~1.5B cover vulnerable groups every country. 

If every country shared vulnerable would take 2 years top groups, including key workers. 65 without clinical vulnerabilities. unlikely schools would able open time let alone hospitality industies travel. going vaccine production slowed lockdowns


All them. Lockdowns destroyed economies leaving less money invest plants production, poorer countries entirely dependent rich countries able afford invest vaccine production cover every country, task likely cost several trillion, who's going pay rich countries expericing worst recessions since WW2? space laser would gotten Clinton prior that. reality big snowstorm people get out, many don't. 

If business opens, see they'll get 1/4 costumers, that. 

With vaccines, quorum it'll go bad. J+J Astrazeneca ones, last longer outside. Pfizer Moderna ones (specifically Pfizer) delicate spoil easily outside extreme cold.

If they're expecting TON cancellations vaccine, means they'll lose unused vaccines can't put back storage since opened. national guard Health care devolved, think NHS Scotland (et al) accelerate.

😂😂😂 political leaders fucked up. Rather weigh _all_ factors, gave absolute power experts narrow specialty.

Public health experts obviously going mostly care saving many lives possible. That's job. like economic experts going mostly care jobs economic growth, psychiatrists mostly going care mental health, artists going care keeping museums open, on.

It's role public policy weigh **all** competing concerns decide best possible course action. leaders abdicated mission acting valid goal maintaining longevity costs. 20 contries vaccinated people 11 EU countries. top 30, 20 EU. great, nearly bad everyone makes sound.  clear best effort clause means: AZ relieved contractual obligations fails develop vaccine vaccine fails get approval.

Since AZ vaccine approved, AZ supply EU like supply UK, ie. 100 million doses EU first quarter 2021. Failing that, breach contract.

All contracts vaccine yet developed contain best effort clause. standard practice. Swedish. you.

I guess depends live. around Kungsholmen see lot people face masks buses supermarkets. Mostly 60s though. Whether country wealthy based gdp per capita otherwise guess Liechtenstein poor country?

China middle income country. demonstrated.

 
Any attempt UK unilaterally assist Ireland using surplus vaccines would clearly blocked EU. sounds like states hoarding based *possibility* future shipment delays. sore arm, meet old friend. Thanks! Prob not, international travel shot years. That’s huuuge change.  one making fly them. social distancing law required it. Don;t like give business. airline can't keep social distancing make comfortable unless want go bankrupt. Actually, Kate Bingham tory party mate. also happens quite good getting shit done too. I'm optimistic happen. see restrictions lifted end June. Alternatively, see population whole ignoring whatever restrictions remain point.

It's likely rest world lagging behind summer different occasion countries. good old-fashioned, unrestricted, staycation looks order. Here's several articles schools low figures investment gone said invest higher year. *up to* 12 weeks -

 another redditor said would rather 100 people 60% 50 people 90% protection?

It makes sense. He's liar. EU spent €1.78bn “risk money”, cash handed pharmaceutical companies without guarantee return, compared €1.9bn UK

Given Germany alone put least 2 billion risk money , seem exclude member state money. always stats include direct EU funding distort. shit different day. know. hope I'm 75 people people reasonable enough think life. CTU resisting going back schools year potentially beyond that. least 4 months pushing stay classrooms. ok i'll play. 

the reports people reinfected variants getting infected two variants time always gonna sound scary, great driving clicks. 

but they're real data. we've seen stories people dying vaccines plastered place, individuals make less 100 millions millions people. course make front page. fear sells. 

anyway, let's take concerned variants reinfections word. lots highly respected experts talking it, all! let's even assume something really scary- let's say South African Brazilian variants make people 50 times susceptible reinfection. 

you know many people leaves strong, long-lasting protective immunity? still vast, vast majority people contracted covid. 

additionally, reinfections Coronaviruses tend less severe original infections. many experts believe COVID become next endemic coronavirus, variants we're detecting places like Brazil part process. 

there evidence complete immune escape need take deep breaths. That's covid absolutely needs become deadlier. speed National Observer Canada, sources recent much doubt World Health Organisation (referenced BBC article) British propaganda mouthpiece. Understood, I’ll check out! cause: western study=worthless mentality Saskatchewan, Canada. used 108.04% delivered doses. Yup, 100%.

we chance make domestic vaccine. trudeau even offered turned down.

look would work? factories EU ones problems setting production lines up. That's whole point.

I guess could block exports Pfizer vaccines really wanted escalate situation. stealing every single dose UK still taken delivery would barely make dent EU's shortfall, let alone let vaccinate whole Europe couple months. make thrice P.1 brazillian variant. There's list government website. largest number conditions tier six serious conditions seem remember tier four. There's quite list conditions virus target number organs cases. doses given? still trailed?  Captain Sir? man accolades thats normal, even happen time, even flu cold, norovirus 2 covid strains time + congressmen, nurses, etc.. people vaccinated, testing positive covid. big question is, vaccines actually prevent recipient catching covid, vaccine (hopefully) keep recipient getting sick catch it? case congressmen week example. medical spokespeople articles saying ""that's vaccine's supposed work - he's asymptomatic"" similar independently evolved P.1 Brazil escape. debatable. question degree effect live humans. Staff vaccinated part CTU's demands. 

CPS already approved teachers required ADA, statute would cover people would need accommodations due covid. CTU conceded point. 

The CTU demands way reasonable contrary public health recommendations. blatant ploy keep teachers schools long possible. actual demand list CTU came CTU teachers treated like garbage, highest paid least amount oversight worst performance country. it’s Reddit Biden president lmao Go UK! Keep up. 4x US rate. plus First Dose First means pace roughly 8x fast herd immunity. could teach person schools low risk. actually order Europe/EU production, US UK went nationalistic forbid hinted forbidding exports vaccines. issue vaccines production. That’s don’t help. fun propaganda. Aww that's adorable! vaccination centre work recorded we’ve done day yesterday. absolutely smashed day.

Everyone literally going fast safely could day. many patients coming everyday say things like, “don’t let hold up! lots people need me!”

It’s great everyone together! It’s also one things country that’s actually going better expected! Nothing stops going vacation within US today. visited Arizona Nevada December January. Nobody tried stop me, great time. Thank thoughtful response I'm truly sorry daughter left behind pandemic. understand good solutions.

Requiring teachers work without fully vaccinated adds unnecessary risk health safety educator time wait month safely. fully feel daughter family. time, perspective working specifically: choosing health daughter health teacher. Reminder - worst pandemic 100 years.

""If teachers going skip line get vaccine, go back work. moved goal posts adults children need vaccinated go back.""

Agree. Obviously district-by-district, believe teachers first in-line vaccine go back work - skip vaccine stay remote. Sounds like aligned, would wait teachers vaccines + 14 days.

With regards IDEA act. due respect, bringing January 2021 quite simply unreasonable. alone. 330 million Americans making sacrifices losing year lives, case last year lives, pandemic. Literally everyone reading everyone reading this, around world, made gigantic sacrifices. strongly support rights disabled - rights need put context COVID.

Finally, recommend read ""The Two Income Trap,"" Elizabeth Warren. sounds like found trap. shoes, would one parent staying home. fact, expect nearly families children pandemic. Please sacrifice money find way keep one parent home raise child difficult times, rather sacrificing teacher maintain two careers. know easy America - making statement American system (including healthcare) rather personal circumstance. That's family did. wife immuno-compromised teacher kids young enough social distancing unrealistic. clear since March one cares health. took year sacrificed salary health safety well fellow Americans. Re-entering profession question-mark seen regards lack care educators parents, administrators, general population.

I say love compassion, really appreciate sharing perspective. Thank you! get that. want vaccine, fine stop people getting it.  Whose joking? Another counterpoint people accuse US hoarding.

Either way, EU really screwed here. think it’s area many people showing receive jabs. places seem leftovers I’ve heard, surgeries carrying age brackets others giving second doses.  doesn’t. Super Bowl parties nowhere near celebrated big thanksgiving Christmas would variants, least according article. simply true. vaccine contracts contain best efforts clause case company fails develop vaccine. best effort applies AZ's obligation EU way applies obligations UK. That’s well good second dose? model correct California faces 0.9 R right B117 strain 50-70% transmissible, sure.

But right California’s R looks like 0.7 0.8 it’s possible strain 20-30% susceptible. would like see model assumptions comparison Reread thread please. Yup. That’s puzzling Biden *immediately* broke promise Senate said people would settle $1400 instead $2000 negotiating against... himself. AZ would complete EU contract first. distributed around EU per population. Sadly spare Oxford-AZ rest world. real answer logical principle. fact people using virus's origin blame China existence virus, people perceived contributing xenophobia racism Chinese people. similar wave xenophobia South Africans, Brazilians, British people far know. (No comment whether reasoning right wrong, that's argument). US Vaccine Rollout Schedule:

* Dec - March: 220 million doses (120 Pfizer 100 Moderna - 110 million Americans
* April - May: 80M Pfizer doses 
* April - June: 100 million doses Moderna Feb-June: 100 million J&amp;J doses - 100 million Americans  * End March (220M doses; 110M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J

  * USA 265 million Americans 16 years older 2018)
* include Oxford vaccine could seek approval next month so
* Novavax vaccine pending US phase 3 clinical trials could done end April approval May.
* Depending backend loaded J&amp;J vaccine rollout many Oxford vaccines get, US could give everyone 1st dose beginning May end June. assumes everyone eligible get (I hearing 80% willing), vaccination distribution reaches 3M per day supply issues.
* Week Jan. 25th distribute 8.6 million doses Pfizer Moderna. next week (Feb. 2nd) distribute 10.1 million doses Pfizer Moderna. 15% increase week week. went school impverished youth. one well students school forunate enough avoid worst poverty lunch would go around one friends collecting people's apples (they cane lunch lot people want eat them) fill backpack would something eat dinner/over weekend.

My high school boyfriend's mom heroin addict stepdad would shoot nails arm nail gun.

I graduated 2012 probably half classmates internet home. highly abusive home lives (as I). parents gave single fuck kids.

Sure work impoverished youth adult, grew it. like know like. must feel nice vaccines steal EU Punishment disobeying lockdown = lockdown.

Got love idiots.  Yup.

Im always incredibly proud NHS incredible work Well disagree points make, arguing pretty much waste time. living life naturally pay attention restrictions, guess stay home What’s latest general population access vaccines US? keep reading different things. mean open environment? Btw don’t measure efficiency masks comparing different cities, states countries mask usage. many variables. 

Let’s say covid go 7/11. less likely spread others everyone wearing masks? 

The answer you’re wearing mask less likely spread infection. know dozens studies like one. UK propaganda. Probably many anti-vaxxers UK. significant number nonetheless. No, didn't. Go ahead, confident, find said it. wont, reported EU said media.

And considering EU publicly lied contract (notice they've shut released it), I'm going blindly trust them.  logically follow AZ's advice 12 week's issue. Guess AZ produce us? UK.

Odd hill choose fight mate. don’t get people say this. Corporations ones benefit lockdowns, it’s small businesses suffer. keep thinking last time 2 year old cafe us. 1 yr old (obvs), completely delighted interacting everyone. Five different members staff came different times chat sociable smiley. little face ecstatic attention.

That sort pleasure social interaction even opportunity see people two parents (and grandmother childcare), really miss it.

I honestly would said pre covid I’m antisocial (I never fan extended social interaction) bloody hell id rather now; course. i've recently rediscovered love reading writing. there's definitely somewhat good side You’re two days behind, EU backtracked pretty severely. vaccines blocked UK’s supply fine. Ah british propaganda pieces. real Tuesday. Almost week ago. VdL re-announcing now. Worth threatening Northern Irish peace that? Probably worth it. takes time, time have, might work out. important all, enough. EU wants 10 million AZ deliveries per week. UK produce? Maybe two million per week eventually? That's even gonna put dent shortages shared UK. 

AstraZeneca massively failed task. lot done now. AZ received 330 million Euros 8 months produce 120 million vaccines best reasonable effort. made deal EU. Reality: 31 million vaccines. fact many places (including live), they'll lock everything 1-2 months, let bit, another lockdown couple months, almost year now. much man. life like worth living. statement without context time frames ultimately happened. That's sign quality journalism. sign hit piece. UK Medical experts vs rest world medical experts, vaccine manufacturers, Israeli vaccination &amp; infection data, etc. 

Haven't discussed everyone know, assume they'd side larger group medical experts. interview AZ CEO clear come EU production line improving slightly faster expected. Probably AZ let Von Der Leyen publicly declare win allow save face, would happened anyway. Sadly person :-) Government procured vaccines we're using right support NHS?  close friend almost exactly symptoms describe, first dose. completely fine day two. Slaoui predicted we'd 20,000,000 doses administered first week January, 50,000,000 end January, 100,000,000 end February. What's interesting predictions perfectly accurate speed distribution, surprised around 100,000,000 doses distributed end February, especially vaccines way.

This also accompanied precipitous drop new cases hospitalizations. Even there's debate whether that's due vaccines seasonal nature virus, still exciting see dropping so, fast, realize we're track overcome ridiculousness. past eleven days, million Americans gotten vaccine day. That's incredible, even could demand better. totally agree you! people hurting restrictions get stage hospitals overwhelmed cases go substantially reason current restrictions. Isn’t strain that’s whole time variant different original strain identified China? Definitely feeling see number get higher
 
""Now kind exponential growth"" agreed share data pfizer. crap seen before. Yes, probably true, defines ""normal "" completely different way us dream of. Yes, take long time last restrictions dissappear, last ones go away read news think ""hey, still restrictons?"" apply us. honest Biden's goals look underwhelming day. rolling average 1.3 million shots day, likely go soon. little pedantic, using titers measurements. Titers directly measure antibody concentration, rather they’re measurement much dilute serum still detectable binding given antigen epitope. IMO simplest way conceptualize lower antibody titers new variant existing antibodies less sticky variant, need stick equally well. It’s like existing anti-COVID IgG levels vaccinated convalescent patients suddenly decrease 2-6 fold exposure new variant. Rather existing antibodies don’t stick well.  It’s shocking successive governments major parties didn’t view threat national security public health. raises serious questions preparedness potential threats. Good thing New York never fudged I'm entirely sure downvoted, agree i'll rephrase: buy cheap ""Covid antibody"" test tell got antibodies blood. either Covid within least last six months, longer, know vaccine worked immune. feel like spending extra money even amount antibodies counted asking lab ""titre count"".

California's COVID death rates much lower Florida... 100 COVID deaths per 100K vs. 120 Florida. interests outside covid? No. completely wrong. else new across channel ... mutates. Yep See, agree lockdowns pretty weak (forget China, even support soft lockdown properly funding people services). would argue even so, summer lockdowns worked. fact, Florida's summer wave worse California's part DeSantis refused shut down. saw thing Arizona Texas, two states refused shut while. shut down, bent curve successfully. 

In contrast, believe October onwards, lockdowns entirely ineffective. look California exemplar here. tight restrictions, everyone know still socializing small groups. got chilly enough held indoors. Yes, Californian going superspreaders bars. enough community spread essential work socializing indoors, saw exponential spreading. closing businesses really make sense.

(This say nothing baffling closing outdoor dining seem evidence-based all. suspect attempt ""signaling"" Newsom miserable failure.)

Ultimately state's response depends citizens. responsive state policy, state limited do. see lot pop-up 3rd party sites tho, explain 25% hospitalization down? fair, person assuming it'll stay same. They're assuming 1.7 million shots/day, vs current rate 1.3 million/day. 95% efficacy means 5 100 ill protected.

That's right, actually. still protected serious symptoms, including hospitalization death. 100% effective preventing that.

It's 100% effective stopping getting it.  95% effective that. lead. trouble singling Sky media outlets selling fear. know many, several friends/family healthcare workers FL reporting this, they're DRASTICALLY underreporting always underreporting cases deaths FL. comparison NY, CA, etc. moot. data skewed, always argument ""lockdowns work!"" people saying DeSantis right, well yeah he's right... According data. way Trump propagated lies: use fake data never ""wrong"". I'm mystified comments here. Yes, ""goal posts"" moving we're getting data. colleagues told March 2020 expect back May, October, January 2021, June 30th 2021 probably extended November 2021 least.

Also posturing comments like ""if think I'm going put restrictions 'x' months crazy"", kind beyond me. Many folks adhering restrictions general none us following restrictions surprised triggered lack adherence, go off. 

My best guess ""normal"" masks distancing June 2022. I'll happy wrong, that's guess. opinion measures used past 10 months necessary? Nation wide lock downs? International travel bans? Masks? Etc.? US proving significantly efficient vaccines EU. US, would basically effective vaccines.

I American, recognize world gets thank US also county named Spotsylvania. start seeing counselor depression. want over. too. i’m glad he’s getting help! California Yep. also seem missed said stimulus start. Anytime hear opinion agree say ""brigading.""

I used make much fun Florida, look numbers, reconsider. Yeah actually tested negative feel fine, we'll see goes read *somewhere* today (although can't find moment) already positive affect.

Assuming true sure hear soon.

I hope true.   Exactly feel situation well. opinion bode well others here.

While respect optimistic narrative pushed comments sub understand hope crucial enduring global crisis, fail see downvoting and, extreme cases, disparaging different views contributes overall subject conversation.

Everyone entitled opinion, point threads ""Daily Discussion"".

I prefaced opinion stating I'm way launching attack anyone anything, I'm simply stating personal opinion contributing topic hand. 100% prevention hospitalization death.  Ugh year half ago scars prove it. went urgent car right away got put antivirals steriods within 4 days presenting. couldnt sleep week since started spine wrapped around sternum. say, Italy political issues quite newsworthy first shot alone mostly effective, though 100%. there’s good chance you’ll fine. Good luck GF! God I'm tired this. Lockdowns work. take time. Takes weeks get rid inter household spread, data lag top. aren’t.

Schools safer.

In theory better ventilated buildings, plus kids transmit less.

But requires masks distancing well.  They've *one* playoff game since 1957. named Brad Pitt amazing performance [Interview Vampire defend statistics without caring side spectrum president on. getting reinfected. Novavax said 1/3rd people Brazil trial got new strain antibodies old strain too. Reinfections new strains norm, rare.  better, safer ways want that. (Although expensive.) email one yet? Maybe two people emailing thing effective. Yep, live NY, think Florida cultural wasteland. want live there. governor believed something held nerve, Miami cities booming expense SF NY, pretty average death rate state. *When post-holiday surge ever come back war?* People like poster needs realize science updated time. Especially disease new one February 2020.  Flood new stories anti-mask Karens throwing tantrums mass transit incoming....  article near top sub right says every adult able get vaccine June. think also includes 16 17 year olds, since Pfizer vaccine approved them. 

Are still living complete isolation? so, could maybe try outdoor social /recreational activities meeting small groups friends. Cases going things opening pretty much everywhere US, legal activities safer month ago. Air travel essential purposes moment. traveling, assume may quarantine 14 days returning home. Also, airlines currently waiving change fees. I’m optimistic whatsoever unless start getting vaccines produced distributed. one many state limbo due reserving second doses. hope parents state isn’t stupid enough actually least get protection deserve. out.

While FL continues fudge numbers, attack data scientists, mis represent data, attack journalists, promote outlandish conspiracies, fight anyone try’s help public health mask mandates.

It’s one thing get hit fog war early on, it’s whole thing continue lie people full year pandemic. agree depends equivalent reporting standards coronavirus deaths. get accurate picture could compare excess deaths countries unexplained excess deaths likely reporting.  Free choice? According another article, also basically gave social distancing Christmas.

Three theories:

- attack rate first wave lot less estimated, case IFR first wave must also higher - many fewer asymptomatic cases thought.
- immunity wanes significantly within ~6/9 months waves
- new variant escaped immune response old.

Whichever is, really bad, could happen anywhere let guard, relax measures. I'm pretty sure they're least day behind, several. great news, think reflects 1 million vaccinations today. Tomorrow Mondays numbers today.  believe China, Feb-April lockdowns, everything closed leave house. THAT'S lockdown. Anything less enough move needle - See CA NY.

Nope, beyond isolated reports happening Wuhan, never happened Shanghai don’t understand brainwashed antivaxxers get trying stop others getting vaccinated. don’t want get vaccinated, that’s fine let others make choice.  Totally place post know what's fucked up?

Just lockdown got new phone contract specifically got 5g work middle big city.

Days later boom I'm suddenly working home permanently. live countryside. year later I'm yet see god damn 5G I'm paying extra month. anti-lockdown think beyond question hard, brutal, Chinese-style lockdowns work.

The problem is: can't long, can't America bunch pretty autonomous states, half-assed lockdowns seem work everywhere else they've tried cause bunch economic misery boot.

I live NY, suspect we'll look back places like Miami found good balance. (Mostly open, midnight curfew). I'm fine depression worse/as bad covid, think. time last year got back reading exercise, really improved outlook, although course changes moment really tough.  here. also miss able go favorite tavern eat, drink merry :( I'm sure it'll even still time return normalcy. privacy laws broken Australia? assume contact tracing done US?

Also, non-compliance speaks failure certain American citizens countries. going going especially vaccines gone many states. Grin bear it? guess know someone got shingles age. Even fucking spread one eyes.  Ironically, guy thumbnail wearing mask wrong way, happens speed spread. fact AMERICA that, would illegal power grab government. lockdown style may necessarily bad, government breaking laws lock populace can... make people feel bit uneasy, especially United States.

What laws would government ripping constitution attempting lock populace illegally LIKELY one  goal shoot blanks. Vaccines always prevent transmission. Many do, based similar viruses, reason believe one will, tested reduction presence symptoms, reduction transmission.

In words, know sure, reasonable believe would. reduction spread since rolled proof, evidence. TSA people McDonald's level employees except badge. everyone US stayed indoors ate pets two weeks, would now! real lockdown people food! say realize one going pat back re-socializing seniors at-risk ppl vaccinated. winning prizes resuming life.

after saying facts prepared live consequences.

Which stupid me. idea I'm going drop social distancing ""consequences"" realistically non-existent me. know people's risk tolerance suddenly ass now. Covid floating severity suddenly like flu five months manageable risk.

Stop intermingling want happen reality. Well, oversell it. huge error bands looking 95% confidence internal. control group, couple people ended dying small group ended hospitalized. 

It's definitely promising data needed determine precise protection hospitalization (and death). think 85-90% reduction hospitalization death reasonable assuming correlated severe symptoms. Definitely game-changer least terms truly turning ""just flu bro"". 99-100% protection probably unrealistic.

Regardless, numbers good enough general (18-49) population. Save Moderna Pfizer high risk groups. late. vulnerable already dead. Thats also reason death rate may slow too. one anymore die. barrier entry nursing high probably think is. hear bullshit 'its island' one time ...

People seem ignore US basically closed land borders restricted international travel small handful countries. Infection 25 million people already seems high. England, many 1 5 people, 12.4 million, estimated Covid-19 estimate substantially higher 2.4 million confirmed cases Public Health England, based reported tests alone

[As many 1 5 people England Covid-19 course that’s England alone, you’d add whole populations Wales (3.1m), Scotland (5.5m) NI (1.9m) infected get close 25m UK.

The caveat course one study. fold change normalizes results. instance, 6 fold decrease 100 16.67 would 83.3% decrease. But, 6 fold increase 16.67 100 83.3% increase...it's 500% increase. notice world death charts, deaths drop significantly two days week week suppose could staffing related, but, ideas? odd.   would’ve thought Ayah Moderate cases, mild ones.

The people getting long term symptoms sick, sick enough go hospital. long haulers got sick enough know sure Covid.

And J&amp;J definition moderate pretty severe - good vaccine prevented breathing issues cases. Living must bad... guess. reason EU pushed everyone work together avoid repeat flu pandemic years ago richest members pushed poorer countries away hoarded vaccines, leading lot death suffering...and went anyway. Gross.

LOL privileged nation entirety fucking EU calling scapegoat, man, really believe bullshit huh? entire country built slavery, pillage exploitation continue cause untold suffering. Enjoy alone. empire dust now, US give shit you, trade main partners EU shitter Russia China laughing way bank. get exactly wanted, very. last. detail. wow 2 whole countries world isolated rest world share borders countries.

Did miss part US closed land borders restricted international travel Australia still need wear masks.

As opposed country need wear masks? I’m sorry... must change. I'm talking standing 6 feet apart indoors, would mostly annoyance similar wearing masks. surprised starts encouraged winter people long. Meanwhile, Brazil, Pfizer offered 70 million doses health ministry refused them. protesting masks basis ""freedom"" see fit deny others choice? SMH.

Edit: Typo. Well that's extreme Rage inducing shit right there. Fucking morons. may so, yes, saying life won’t return normal least two years indeed fear mongering nonsense. Look deaths occurred states. northeast majority deaths initial wave done better started locking down. Florida didn’t get hit hard first wave bunch people die subsequent waves taking covid seriously politeness positive attitude summer Europeans Canadians lobbing insults Americans every single day? calling Americans plague rats, America biohazard, third world country Gucci belt, meth lab? I'm seeing ""terrifying dominance"" im looking data. UK variant media latching onto weeks ago. UK SA steep decline cases. knew coming like everyone else right? read news like everyone else? play devil’s advocate, I’d like see ages people accusing jumping queue. lot donors board members older people. 65+, may inflammatory reporting.

Still, even 65, using registration systems rest us peons use, “invite only” crap. you! even socially distance today! hotzone Los Angeles restaurants city getting ready SuperBowl Sunday. People going want do. facts prepared live consequences. realize one going pat back re-socializing seniors at-risk ppl vaccinated. winning prizes resuming life. isn’t context countries uneasy. 

It’s fact AMERICA that, would illegal power grab government. lockdown style may necessarily bad, government breaking laws lock populace can... make people feel bit uneasy, especially United States. 

The US isn’t like countries. Half country armed willing go war government certain, extreme things. government ripping constitution attempting lock populace illegally LIKELY one triggers. 

These facts make whole idea little... uneasy. think severe claim backed (yet) scientist. lot playing Boris said day said it.  Testing completely free city. Insurance no. Add possibility strain infecting farmed mink away go again.
People seem missing possibility zoonotic mutation . 
All travel stopped countries vaccinated ( know going happen)

There updates bird flu making it’s way Mongolia late last year.

There reports Indian Japan parts China wild birds chicken farms infected nothing more. hope disappeared underreported . Hang there, friend. Yeah pretty much. hope gets better ASAP! travelers commuters required wear masks nearly forms public transportation inside transportation hubs, according late Friday emergency order Centers Disease Control mandate, goes effect Tuesday applies everyone age 2, effectively reverses Trump administration’s policy leaving choice local leaders. follows executive order issued President Biden Jan. 21, required passengers wear face coverings interstate travel.

[Definintion difference CDC handling things now. face covering information written order. We’re back accepting Center Disease Control authority’s designed be. 

Now we’ll see signs subway requiring masks bus drivers say federal government requires masked. Missouri. I’m flying till I’m fully vaccinated. I’m actually big consumer household ample expendable income. math 2020 spent least 7K less 2019. 

People forget it’s things shut down. Consumer confidence drives discretionary spending. family pretty much bubbled in-laws continue part kids life. 

No get plane take frivolous trips. seriously doubt that's issue.

In opinion, exactly issue airlines trying avoid. going take long time passenger traffic recover anything makes expensive delay even further.

Personally, going anywhere now, farther grocery store intend large percentage population vaccinated.  still get shingles got chicken pox vaccine - it’s likely case mild expect number covid deaths comparable year (6-24 months) normal deaths population caught it. South Africa far that. 

My assumption they're panic mode keeping R&lt;1 distancing economic sacrifice. Bloomberg update: 30.5 million.
1 million vaccinations atleast saturday. Idk can’t determine people getting reinfected not. herd immunity least 70% chance finding someone covid say such. people going hospital go hospital first wave? New people? difficult figure fucking ask paying early mean little? pays expansion capacity, takes time, earlier pay, earlier company expand. 

Also, never point saying AZ screw supply EU (hard know overconfidence). I'm saying big lumps money make building things possible. Good management planning mean remarkably little cash flow. 

Lastly, talking Pfizer UK's rights contract honoured? agree UK help pay production expansion, entire original discussion. Came back better figures you. Humanity around ~200,00 years. Civilization think ~6000+ years. Pandemics tricky obviously data far back hard track research 100 years pandemic. less .2% humanity’s span far. Someone feel free correct hope helps things perspective. 

Pandemics last hundred years usually go year change. in, whole 12 months, little longer. March, whole year covid declared pandemic. Add months, end sometime summer part. mere estimate. shall see. I’m feeling good it. small town x4 people small Canadian city Blame people still give shit virus year. Yup. That’s said “more safely.” could still wear mask everything keep transmission possibility lower. makes sense least one person per household/family vaccinated able help keep things afloat. put safety ahead profitability right thing.

If 20% nurses opt out, suddenly losing fifth staff going good patient safety. 

Keep mind 20% population naturally infected, nurses may trusting natural immunity. Natural immunity produce high levels antibodies, would choose vaccination prevent reinfection. second infections likely mild due cell immunity, memory cells rapidly restart antibody production. Yeah that's common sense approach, we've year's worth data support Florida's decision isn’t much research yet specifically long Covid, copious info specifically post viral syndromes. I’ll see current research gone though Depends type vaccine tho  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

It’s foregone conclusion people living alone near support network completely unable cope this. It’s epidemiology study. They’re bad kind thing. might wanna research company developed vaccine, BioNTech ;) 
Spoiler: german! honest, I’d prefer went unbridled. silent part people wanted China-style Australian-style lockdown aren’t acknowledging attack people them. 

When say want style lockdown, also means want US government take power doesn’t implement things isn’t legally allowed implement. 

The people uneasy uneasy government this. lockdown people never acknowledge that. Instead, paint everyone disagrees sociopaths want watch people die. 

It’s gross dishonest thing can't say decrease due lockdown. Cases could dropping due fact winter almost over, like happens wit seasonal viruses.there places lockdown similar numbers germany Hey, it’s worst year life *so far*. There’s plenty bad years come young one! already trying get done ASAP? know still transmit disease vaccinated? Interesting tidbit nate silver need around 3 million day two doses delivered 80% population June Honestly, imo comes really spoiled people. 


And infuriating, access vaccines pandemic risk still high here, maybe another whole year. 


This taken heavy toll mental health ngl, immunossupressed dad lives 60yo mom, basically home 24/7 since early march 2020. real vaccines. think I'm making up?

You really ""vaccine"" stop tests fairly sure prevent asymptomatic cases vaccines. Smallpox Polio. go back get new vaccines every year. stop transmission symptoms. Oh, get lesser version Polio took one. 

This Covid shot. vaccine. like flu shot. may may help. stop transmission. People given up... nothing ""herd immunity"" working.

Thank dispelling bullshit claims undoing clickbait lying headline. Definitely light end tunnel

I feel like that's bad choice words talking nursing home we’re gonna need bigger boat want federal agents enforcing masks, weed, immigration, anything else. pointing federal law something trivial masks simply ignored states. 

At point, US issuing million jabs day vaccines coming online following weeks. writing wall. Covid19 sentenced die way death row now. Gestures like way gathering credit inevitable happens. symbolic nature. Cool. Thank taking time respond! moms school. worried really haven’t many cases upgrade entire hvac system schools. know lot districts don’t money that. Pandemic hitting way third world compared countries like USA, UK Germany, so, think priority first world spread virus faster since travel lot more. Say fear mongering garbage stupid attempt deny reality actually reason we're still year. Last heard, J&amp;J going 10 million doses available end March. testing carried back up?

I assume report carried Redfield?   certainly make bit difficult US criticize human rights violations without sounding bit hypocritical. Soo know who’s fault honestly, someone dumb, really give fuck anymore. probably already trust vaccine hate government much, give people want vaccine efficient way maybe rest us get sooner current system. SHORT JNJ Schools safer real authority actually boot non compliant students staff members. Plus, weird students much compliant general population comes rule following (because guess what, follow rules time).

This necessarily hostile people store likely political agenda wearing mask. 

The real issue comes fact students spreading asymptomatically alot school districts pressuring parents test keep school open. Virtual tends result less attendance, results less funding. hate break i'm italian. agree  One born every day. Nothing like good pun thread among chaps.  I’m case anyone thinks Cali liberal paradise... still assholes. least aren’t serving real government capacity. look Israel vaccinated country world  
something tells woods yet ""I greatest jobs ~~president~~ governor God ever created"" Anyone underselling J&amp;J vaccine wrong. solid vaccine that's another huge milestone fight covid. Yes 90% efficiency moderna/pfizer kind spoiled us. J&amp;J come November pfizer/moderna 66% efficiency we'd cheered joy effective is. Remember FDA threshold 50% efficiency approval annual flu shot 40-60% efficient. J&amp;J better annual flu shot depending year alot better. 

Also 85% efficient severe symptoms hospitlisations. words even develop symptoms It'll likely minor symptoms almost like flu It'll keep hospital. End day that's main aim be. mind much getting slightly ill want go hospital die. prevents that. one dose huge plus point logistically speaking speed things up(no calling people back 2nd doses) vaccine roll slow: sort age group, race, profession....Some vaccine literally expired find enough people fit desired characteristics rest us allowed fit desired characteristics. 

I'm healthy (not obese, smoking), old enough, desired race group, disadvantaged, Gosh, even health insurance! I'll lucky get vaccine end year. stage vaccine rollout, increase amount vaccines currently available? late so. Biden response significantly better transparent proactive.

Because government would covering pay, everyone amoral jerk will, possible, continue help employees able silly things like buy food. need capitalistic argument think people work deserve starve death, business keeps employees happy healthy despite able work, employees even happier healthier able work again, tell people great boss increase business public opinion.

Thats possible majority countries. Also, would compare China neighbours, like Japan, light lockdown policies. 

I'm saying florida good numbers, nothing ""good"" country. numbers similar states lockdowns really makes question efficacy lockdowns. add extra deaths, mental health issues, job loss comes lockdowns, seems obivous harm good. course states affected equally, evidence says lockdown?  Lol

Airborne autoimmune condition



Flu season catastrophic near future, article completely cuts talking international travel restrictions, day day ""go get drunk friends nightclub going sporting event"" kind restrictions. Look actual suppression listed. one hospital Israel 2 unvaccinated nurses tested positive (symptomatic) tested coworkers, found 7 workers week second dose positive, completely asymptomatic. still unclear whether transmit virus test found dead viral particles noses. Africa pretty well genome sequencing - limited resources. UK. idiotic. Anti vaxxers dumb enough is, prevent others getting it? anti choice  fine. They'll job cases, hospitalizations, deaths fall whether vaccinations reported.

It's pet peeve mine people think what's reported day actually reflects actually happened day. even day before.   young adult biggest hardship dealing living tiny apartment.

I basically inside tiny room equal jail cell area. room bed, gaming chair solid work desk good computer setup, manage. kitchen table, living room etc really can't handle much longer.

Young adults commonly apartments designed place sleep part. even paying attention things unfolded Wisconsin?  /r/boneappletea fuck? Blocking people want get vaccine insane.

We've seen drop cases hospital. one person intubated needs proning ICU righ now. I've swamped since last year much needed break co-workers. Working crazy busy environments little PPE, breaks, stress exhausting. also careful bring anything home cause young daughter elderly parents.

I hope trend keeps everyone get vaccine instead resistant getting like mask wearing. can, please go get vaccinated. happy you! aint capable hold debate

Sedentary lifestyles, portion size meals, etc. spent couple weeks holiday Morocco 15 years ago never experienced meals like that. Five courses course enough fill own. culturally, it’s really possible refuse served, eat point bursting. two weeks couldn’t even imagine whole life.

Interesting aside. Read study recently suggest genetic risk factor concerning one’s percentage Neanderthal DNA. study done people sequenced Neanderthal genome Max Planck Institute Germany. 

The study pointed link high percentages Neanderthal DNA Covid outcomes, based deaths UK residents Bangladesh. 

But here’s thing. Sub-Saharan Africans lower levels Neanderthal DNA everyone else (.3 percent vs 2 percent), East Asians Neanderthal DNA Europeans, North Africans Middle Easterners. Yet East Asians relatively low Covid deaths. don’t know, suggests nurture beats nature comes Covid. wives protesting vaccination sites buying something today saw guy come without mask, gave biggest shit eating grin walking fast telling “got one ‘the man’”. swear people’s egos distrust science seriously peaked throughout last 5 years I’m honestly numb now. real. resigned whole situation bought masks. thinking guess changed mind holding one better vaccines plan accepting J&amp;J means getting something (anything) sooner. think even worst case scenario it’ll mean LESS organ damage getting infected fully unvaccinated all.

Please stop spreading lies. say ""herpy derpy there's whole big area that's gray"", weighted map population area would basically disappear. Exactly. Nothing lies NYC. Yeah different last year?

I'm aware testing like mRNA vaccines, said, there's least concern work.  seen discussed, either. great get new adaption vaccine developed weeks. resets us back phase 1/2/3 trials, looking least six month lag times go process? 

That makes wonder study. Hopefully six months now, everybody USA wants vaccine gotten it. guess point would end essentially tested ""booster."" could tested elsewhere world, US FDA seems sort uninterested using data. (See AstraZeneca/Oxford trials, know issues, sufficient many places western world.) See thought leading form “distancing role humans now”.  could give shit flying Greece. long cool home I’m good. fact take shot send 80 year old Ethiopia. Totally fine it. suspect several areas already reached herd immunity (via combined infections vaccines) we’re talking vaccines only, It’ll American Samoa Northern Mariana Islands first Alaska Maybe. driving along PCH today loooooot people playing volleyball whatever without masks. almost certainly tell every state close normal. live CA well can’t optimistic locally yet. much “mask distance vaccine talk.” Even NYC Chicago pretty good then, almost guarantee that. that's said know shed virus not...this ""we hope"" version vaccine does.

I'm sure got meant. mean relevant people asked vaccines prevent transmission, reply ""we can't say stops it"" rarely, ever, emphasise massive reduction symptomatic cases almost certainly means viral shedding also reduced. something extremely easy layman understand. i.e. ""this vaccine X % effective preventing symptoms, therefore there's much virus shed people catch they're vaccinated"".

I guess reason might people might screech studies specifically analyse notion follow basic science logic. Less people coughing sweating = less transmission. Likely government sponsored tour guide two well. shut down? arrest interfering?  way, raptorxrx s-senpai🥺 I'm sure terrifying. also, case numbers South Africa falling like rock. So, yeah.

They conspicuously silent meaningful way. I’m crying California! Good you!!!  please cite sources data. 

2015 - 2019 US averaged 50K deaths attributed pneumonia per year.

In 2020 [there (325K total - 155K pneumonia + COVID). 

Those pneumonia deaths, COVID deaths. That's additional 120K. 

The media site spreading fear, spreading factual information people use protect anti-science people yourself. 

Setting outdoor triage areas renting refrigerated trucks store bodies something happens normal year. okay mr. big bang zebra man. got kick that. That’s wonderful. Delightful, I’m Trump worshiper man media really aggravating variants. Every story says “worrisome” highly dramatic; then, midway story paragraph says it’s likely big deal. Yeah. want protest, stand side streets holding signs, chanting whatever chant, even call names. care. Go it. second purposely prevent making choice get vaccine crossed line. can't imagine finally getting chance vaccine, probably waiting quite line, get turned around. Yes figured. Darn. Thanks! fault healthcare workers exhibited virtually sense urgency (as evidenced doses holidays, weekends, etc.)

Warp Speed part. States throw ocean, change Warp Speed, pharma companies, CDC &amp; FDA etc. accomplished. great job. I'm American fwiw

There infinite number ways define ""winning"" here. 

International travel silly one because, definition, inter-dependent condition. Everyone restrict travel places COVID control, even vaccine roll-out. one wants risk vaccine-resistant mutation.

But nonsubstantial-- think thing I've focused discussion someone define anything win preventing death suffering. *Maybe* impact unemployment median income 2nd/3rd considerations? Again, amazing US relative AU.

For worth, USA worst per-capita deaths-- we're 8th worst (1,313 per million). Australia 36 per million. 
We might adults vaccinated July, might October.

Is higher death/disability really worth ~4 months head start full vaccination? hell point winning vaccination lose death economic impact majority citizens. 

We leave here, need voice totally arbitrary callous contest Australia's superiority US COVID response least Melbourne, *were* literally barricading people inside homes. Victorian State Ombudsman [found human rights violation.

And that's one item top head list ""batshit crazy government overreach"" friends Aus. others:

\- Another pregnant woman harassed sitting park bench

\- Police talking smashing car windows people answer questions, though totally normal appropriate

\- General [police SA going panic one infected person lied going pizza place

\- SA police telling people can't go outside even walk dogs OMG NEW STRAIN

Again, top head. Americans get lot shit sub overly distrustful authority, I'd say Australia pretty good example dangers trustful authorities surrendering control daily life assumption know best.  month? Shit, live Florida, 65+ y/o phase one vaccinations. makes 25% state population include front-line healthcare providers risk due pre-existing conditions. rate things moving phase one, ass lucky get jab end summer using inferior J&amp;J vaccine.


A month... phht nature vaccine/virus arms race. 60% effectiveness existing vaccines show vs worst variants good enough slow down, booster shots better designed new variants. Booster vaccines require full three phase testing, probably short safety trial. stick enforcing existing non discrimination laws first? pretty clear actually care except cases suit bad faith arguments Yeah listened podcast true infection numbers probably 4x actually recorded roughly 100 million That's true. Good luck. shingles pregnant worst thing ever. Sure thing.

The execution half-assed, apparently limit spread. believe simply 'biased vaccine nationalism'. Especially EU that's faced critique vaccine nationalism', international media recent days. 

Your comments filled hateful often spectacularly misleading comments (I skimmed comment history *completely* made up, misrepresented misunderstood many things) towards Astrazeneca, UK. E.g variant identification,. clear noble pure intentions fostering international cooperations. 

The conditions AZ license specifically non-profit production widely distributed production maximise access protect vaccine nationalism. vaccine came license able freely produced elsewhere 

You pretty much regurgitating EU propoganda cases, much clearly falsifiable. I've read Belgian newspapers past days. kind creepy almost see disconnect reporting even Australian US coverage topic. UK terrible papers tabloids never expect kind thing reputable media Western Europe. 

I'll share quote recent Der Spiegel piece every manufacturer, even later losers, offered contract security early generous support setting production facilities, would possible vaccinate full speed. ...Rarely committee inquiry appropriate issue. Unfortunately, procurement process non-transparent extent failure became apparent almost impossible correct. .. blame assigned manufacturers. Justified dissatisfaction dismissed anti-European sentiment. Anyone complains denigrated vaccine nationalist - even want best Europe. EU apparently long since achieved herd immunity. Unfortunately, criticism

So moving passe projections vaccine nationalism', Let's talk wider picture second beyond Brussels; distribution vaccines managed World Health Organization (WHO); Gavi, Vaccines Alliance; Coalition Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), meant solve so-called vaccine nationalism, 

Uk started funding early: President Ursula von der Leyen recently repeatedly highlighted fact “Team Europe” (including member country contributions) largest contributor COVAX Facility. 

Source: fact largest donor United Kingdom, eclipsing EU 

I invite click tab 'Vaccines COVAX"" AMC donors 18 December €500 million provided EU, lion's share — €400 million — loan European Investment Bank (that part supports non existent vaccines like Sanofi) direct contribution (something common EU 'funding' vaccine development I'll let link speak itself, following. period 2016–2020, UK Gavi's largest donor 2016–2020, 

without US, UK would largest state donor well, well first one historical largest donors IMF pandemic relief CRRT EU 

The facts AZ vaccine widely distributed vaccine world, 1B doses produced distributed around globe **with goal profit, many cases cost**, licensed freely technology transfer agreements, somewhat akin open source software able made local places across global 

 150M+ ready distributed Q1 alone via covax. agreements funded predominantly UK co-operation India's SII charitable organizations express goal co-operation international vaccination 

Meanwhile pfizer/Biontech several days ago, 8 months AZ finally agreed donate ""up to"" 40 million doses covax. 

 ranting vaccine nationalism' dispariging equitable, fairly priced vaccine candidate trying act like moral high ground. European Union Institutions (EUI; including European Union EU European Investment Bank EIB) fifth-largest donor globally, total official development assistance (ODA) US$14.8 United Kingdom (UK) third-largest donor country absolute terms, spending US$19.4 billion (current prices) official development assistance (ODA) 2019 according preliminary data Organisation Economic Co-operation Development (OECD).

 Reinfections exceedingly rare, [like less 1 (maybe 1 10,000 range). rare cases happen, reinfections seem milder previous infections. 

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse spreading therefore follows even less effective vaccine still reduces symptoms might reduce transmission. 

Plus, [studies using show strong immunity exposed, sterilizing immunity multiple vaccine types. means monkeys unable spread virus vaccinated, virus take hold bodies.

Looks like [Pfizer's vaccine may also prevent addition preventing disease.

Immunity vaccine [comparable better immunity infection.

If virus able evade vaccine induced immunity, would likely also evade immunity generated infection, leading lot reinfections. We’re seeing lot reinfections.

Yeah cool story bro, vast vast majority country give shit wear mask go one week lockdown every then. price pay living global pandemic still enjoying much freedom rest planet. I've got clue talking regarding ""blaming people normal activities"". mean people socialising lockdown, that's normal activity. lockdowns ended (at least everywhere WA), people back normal things. sister engagement party last week 50 people showed without worrying infecting others.

I'm pointing dangerous smart idea take proactive steps get vaccinated live around many people ignoring guidelines.  vaccines end things. tweaked future, it. now, current vaccines accomplish goals known variants. think so. looks like rumoured 4m AZ vaccines went EU UK happen either.

It did, vaccine fill finished Belgium plant. actual vaccine shipped uk Belgium put bottles. shipped back.

The commission claimed otherwise, tried find evidence publicly making accusation, failed tried make people forget basically spent week spreading fake news. TLDR: could sharing personal information. 

I mean isn’t common sense you’re going share anything personal information it, at-least put sticker virtual marking it? 

The appropriate title “Becareful sharing personal information COVID-19 vaccine card”, fear mongering clickbait. Wait, what?  become pro opening? protest, got vaccination halted temporarily - individual want it, actions take away choice. 

One witnesses said protesters telling people line coronavirus real. tolerance dangerous misinformation spread. dozens names nomination list ... check link. ;) know. I'm sure Moderna Pfizer planning strategy right now. push hard without clear need, without sufficient reasoning, may backfire theyd end full trials. becomes clear update absolutely necessary, good argument expedited trials, them, sets excellent precedent. Yes it’s simple. real way would work children vaccinated too. Otherwise think going happen throw thousands children back one building? Children far dangerous contract spread Covid without displaying single symptom. Throwing kids back school creates risk new variant made puts us risk starting entire process again. 

Technically speaking right thing would mean rushing risking repeat 2020 again.  AZ massive delays production problems. Pfizer looking even exceeding promised deliveries. example EU would screwed Pfizer. That's weird, bc card sticker it,do much fill out.  saw someone thread yesterday ask vaccination rate become next reopening criteria.

oh vaccinations

oh yes Good luck that. enough teachers boom times, especially secondary math science. Well, necessarily pro-death, considering point every vulnerable person able get vaccine choose. It’s always sad vaccine people kept saying “wait get vaccine!” one they’ve switched “the vaccine won’t end things things going it’s extremely likely virus mutate render partially useful RIP” 

It seems doesn’t matter experts say, people say stuff like gets many upvotes. ""open now. Open all. Right now"" asshats scream out. 

No measures curtail pandemic. open hope virus gets bored killing many people country.  they’re delaying them. Pfizer vaccine start January getting second dose week. Instead I’m booked end March actually expect, among countries possible, one give helping hand first regarding vaccine developed country India, hope country follow suit.

India something like 60% world vaccine production, made deals big companies like AstraZeneca supply developing world. Nobody produce scale need, India far best ability try.   get fried chicken vaccine though? bla bla bla, whatever ... first ... everyone  called preparing worst. get laugh everytime ends big one. honeymoon Scotland postponed last year. chances safe July year? don’t grandparents care about. Take lol. Protesters must ones risk poor outcomes. 

Get out, continue vaccinations yes. ethical thing them. keep factories waiting EU could save life elsewhere right now. Good point. It’s easy compare numbers without accounting massively underprepared beginning. come on, know better It’s cringe critically think Except northeast beginning pandemic (and highest population density) better medical response treatments deal COVID minimize lethal outcomes.

Let government bear risk. mean material risk, mean right thing do. April 2024 stop. Past spring deaths going non existent especially considering pace herd immunity I’m going listen goalpost shifting even half second. Give up

And grandma got hospitalized w covid sweet sweet antibodies don’t worry I’m Yes lockdown. term used quite universally, describe social distancing measures. glad sub seems pretty dead rn first dose offers lot protection, read one article 80%. thinking it’s better double number people vaccinated 80% efficacy get everyone second dose. 

As one group 4 vaccinations appreciate this. It’ll come quicker stop feeling panicked entire time.  Tell young healthy people long haulers even dying. I'm sorry dont care people lol one safe everyone safe. What? \+1. previous poster, US CDC proven unreliable source information throughout pandemic. airborne transmission, wear masks, wear masks, distance, distance, 14 day quarantine, 10 days, 7 days, open schools, open them, etc. overly manipulated politics completely failed containing virus. Pick source please. Let's see, 535 members Congress. Pfizer/Moderna vaccines remain 95% effective scale, 26-27 members Congress would still risk catching COVID.

So one member catching COVID vaccines is, really, non-story here. Italy spring could go grocery shopping, technically go walk. think could also get take-away, 100% sure about. Good luck living guilt may kill someone's grandma. own

Stick summer talk relaxing regulations. lighten now, we'll kill permanently disable people fair Mrs first dose December booked 2nd dose 3rd week February - 8 weeks.

12 weeks looks like it’s max. NHS bloody amazing job. UK could vaccinate Ireland literal week Another thing r/Covidiots got angry Jack Harlow lyric : “Gonna globetrot know vaccine”, like responsible COVID cares fans’ health unlike rappers still get angry. happened took lyric literally shamed “going global tour vaccine discovered waiting people vaccinated” forgot implied waiting safe concerts. Correct - although 1 10 makes bit potentially personal using large numbers. Easier visualise. agree point. really do. guess point immune compromised opportunity go get shot. Even states away. would go, one anything help society whole could bar fucking low. 

In perfect world would followed South Koreas example, don’t care society whole here. It’s assholes. shoes would say fuck society whole 2.2k cases Illinois today. know it’s sunday, even lowest count since September  also get anti-vitals. It’s vaccines. need treatments impacted mutations. Come high horse Look list states hit hardest linked article: South Dakota. New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Mississippi. Pretty decent spread across liberal/conservative urban/rural areas.

This isn’t political doesn’t anything “certain parts country” - virus doesn’t care people think it. qualifications (second dose BionTech delivery schedule AZ) would subject fierce negotiations, assume. 

Just hypothetical scenario: AZ-UK contract stipulates delivery 20M doses Q1, factories make 30M. Then, according pov EU, AZ deliver 10M doses EU. *When* happen (after UK orders parallel), difficult assess, people sides literally dying.

Similarly, assume UK receive 20M doses BionTech, got 18M applied first dose. Germany got 10M doses applied 5 first dose, keeping rest storage.Now production drops massively weeks. BionTech produce 15M doses. go UK second dose factor? think so, completely ridiculous argument, either. edit say good news everyone! Lol protestors dark skin Cringe Trudeau con artist comes crap like this. evasive non transparent beginning respect vaccine shortages. Indoor dining opens 2 weeks 25% capacity.

Can't wait vote Newsom oil-lobbyist family. wouldn’t say he’s credible. 

Every week claims doom right around corner never comes. 

I fear might suffering mental issues this. He’s like poster subreddit, taking extreme pessimistic position everything. .. What? Look hate sound callous, 10 years almost one remotely care COVID deaths per capita anymore. People care Pfizer Moderna though, drugs vastly improve healthcare around world. COVID deaths? going forgotten like deaths 1918 pandemic. Australia New Zealand keep boasting pandemic response others shrug ignore them. people fuck seriously going try keep restrictions US years due people Africa, South America, etc. vaccinated yet? completely insane. Ohio, 3k cases reported today. know Sunday cases usually lower, Friday-Saturday cases little 4K. Long over, illusions end road yet, extremely heartening see lower case numbers. I’m hopeful trend, rather anomalous drop. Wow. whole one case. What’s bot condenses articles posts comment? need here, headlines alone often misleading people don’t tend read articles, especially they’re paywalled subscription based. vaccine hadn’t time take full effect either (one 1 dose) they’re asymptomatic, vaccine approved help achieve. isn’t cause alarm. thread far like either. day comment awful masks are. couple people replied mind masks voted it.

I'm somewhere local sub's (SF) sub's views covid. Jaat? said kaun jaat ho, born yesterday? Oh little child discovered internet long already talking two years. would quite detrimental people’s mental physical health isolate years in. flu long term effects too. want isolate go ahead people it’s A. Economically impossible B. worth isolation friends family. thank making point lol. why? get yelled every time say that. ramping obviously without considering per capita fastest one fastest. complain everything? Don’t need to. That’s simply works. It’s common sense, doesn’t need study verify they’ll effective - it’s ones showed effective first place. Less effective I’ll give you, that’s thing 0%.

Not replying further, don’t need talk seeking turn politics. think everyone struggling issues - single one vaccine companies hit supply target far? get they’re aggressive possible really feel under-promise over-deliver would better strategy. agree directly started name-calling? Italian, Muslim, jaat. Wow! much disagreement. haha Looks like UK Variant US prevalent Miami area according Face Nation morning. Could governor Florida basically banned mask mandates refused shut high risk non essential activities?

It sounds like huge risk affects way Florida. they’re vaccinating people letting community spread run rampant time, could increase risk creating vaccine-escaping mutation? Also, everyone wants it, wants first, that's slowing everything down. work nurses got first appointments, quickly opened job types. However, 6 weeks, less half employees vaccinated appointments still maxed out. People dragging feet reason. job based tiered rollout good intentioned, work. Teenagers tend immature silly things like bringing pencil class classwork. comes serious matters, I've found within decade teaching experience teenagers tend much better following rules (fire alarm pulled, lockdown, etc.) adults. 

And yes I'm well aware study completely biased, targeting upper class rural area self reporting. You’re forgetting certain age greater 10% chance death every year matter what. Taking risks makes sense. You’re also forgetting guarantee giving relative COVID first place.
My relative (who didn’t see) died within week Christmas didn’t see him. regret missing hugely. They’re lock lmaoo look Ok. Please cite study shows it. portion world without cold storage using Johnson Johnson vaccine. chance. everywhere even uses cards. place dad getting uses printed forms. said cards took much time fill hand they're way. news looking forward to. Surgeons wear gloves masks.

Doctors fought hard sanitary measures profession. See Semmelweis. appreciate thought response agree said. However I’m still afraid covid I’m still getting can’t return normal. can't go numbers bloomberg. NY runs first doses every week now. bloomberg never gets anywhere near 100% them. must counting second doses something. Dozens. guess want schools closed. point matter doses particular plant going to. Pfizer best producers make many vaccines possible. 2 billion 2021 aim make, mean able deliver customers time total orders currently ~ 1.2 billion.  Assuming someone got paid dont agree you. Classic delusional namazi. got paid amount every voter got paid nda landslide majority. literally going breach Good Friday Agreement allowing export vaccines Republic NI blocked.

No literally not. article 16 safeguards clause breach GFA , _could_ used breach it, follow automatically. event never case despite hysterical UK press political class want believe. No, let’s force everyone get it. People aren’t smart enough make choices themselves. spread misinformation. Realistically, *probably* impact long need quarantined. takes time conclusively say quarantine less.

Just like people still masking vaccine, even disease. Schools country shut H1N1. It’s virtually impossible stop spreading, even giant island middle Possibly, immune issues taking rushed mRNA vaccine risky could also cause health issues considered selfish people primarily focused getting back normal 3 4 months it. seems silly criticize people that. going last what, 15 months minimum? That’s insignificant portion person’s life. It’s understandable people anxious angry lockdowns now. DAMNIT, jinx it! Thats 20K people study month beleve! number hold start vaccinating millions, considering many people still got 'severe' disease. put immuocrompromised people trial? people 80+ generally get hospitalized this. way many questions left answer jumping joy here. please let vaccines end this? Please? want everyone know reason hesitancy you’ve vaccinated. None. vulnerable vaccinated, they’re available general public, there’s EXCUSE RESTRICTIONS LIFTED. Right now, people vaccines-do want want encourage wear mask whatever hell want. can’t vaccines another goalpost set us moved. spread misinformation. Israel finally admit abide Fourth Geneva Convention?? No, don’t take reason repeat every year lost Friday back following Wednesday. never lost taste Absolutely haha funny sissy. much get paid post here? Bit hopeful assuming it'll happy summer  People don’t like face truth case, Brexit allowed UK cut EU bureaucracy vaccinate 5x people would member state. Brexiteers must thrilled. interesting data y’all think music festivals slated fall? Think chance? Yes is. Wearing mask restrictions ability breath engage socially. restriction spread misinformation. Hope so.
My condolances you. fucking useless. look career track record, epitome failing upwards. anyone suggests raising taxes pay anything related public health gets run town. never understood either. message be, “Take vaccine life go back normal.” It’s simple that. surprisingly person West Baltimore City clearly read anything long term effects flu, also leave lasting respiratory damage.

Accepting part life reasonable thing do. Since holing social reasonable response quickly googled unaware

And that’s I’m trying do. Make people aware see discussion unfold. great points.

My GF microbiologist mentioned much this. IMO, would well road normalcy end year. new obstacles extend timeline people happy. Wait frenzy double-masking mandate made. bit premature given know AZ vaccine effective new strains extent. JAI HO Remember countries world song Yoko Animaniacs singing? Soon there'll variant every country said! /s Ok genius, let help out; lots hospitalizations stroke, pneumonia, flu, heart failure etc. also happen dead covid virus cells floating harmlessly system, would test positive. would inflate covid hospitalizations well covid deaths. 

Are aware US reported 35 flu cases 2nd week December? five year rolling average 7,700 cases week. flu patients test (false) positive, covid case, hospitalization, death per CDC mamdates counting deaths.

Also, many false positives 47 amplification cycles, change 30 cycles? (30 common tests infection viruses, nobody uses 40, know causes lot false positives). Yes, end day row vaccines EU AZ going change much. We'll 2-3 months behind UK/US, big deal grand scheme things. Many poor countries started yet, many wait 2022 get first doses, sucks them. Yup, think would rather pay man quick outpatient procedure instead woman actual surgery. simple: stop reporting.

India country millions starve even food gets exported. feel like need convince people tangible benefit getting vaccine immediately. need revise messaging ASAP away “even you’ve vaccine, still need socially distance wear masks foreseeable future” towards “you still take precautions public around high risk populations, vaccinated start resuming normal activities”.

I’ve even hard time convincing 67 year old MIL sign vaccine. biggest objections are: longterm effects aren’t aware of? And: “They say can’t start bible study even we’re vaccinated, what’s point even getting it?” spread misinformation. Europe says end year Fauci says virus die fall. Let remind US FAR worse Europe terms spreading virus. I'm seeing issues here.  0.0005283333 immune... vaccine 100% effective... vaccine is. something that's .05% effective good

You fundamentally misunderstood effectiveness vaccines calculated. 

600,000 people vaccinated. weren’t exposed virus afterwards. see effective vaccine was, need compare group group unvaccinated people see many cases would vaccine. 317/600,000 great control group 1500/600,000. it’s dog shit control group 320/600,000. watch couple live streams people Texas stream drag tracks car meets. Hardly anyone wearing mask all. I'm saying. see benefit letting immune system work vs taking vaccine numbers (they best). Remember too, way get numbers seeing many people get sick. Whats say 57% people Africa get sick vaccine happen make contact anyone vaccine. People taking measures like mask wearing social distancing now. vaccine could totally something like 20% effective. Reese's pieces Sorry, manners? Kaun jaat ho namazi? know. sucks. need get this. Same, can't find news it. Pfizer's vaccine requires comprehensive cold storage systems. countries capability Well implant chip administering vaccine otherwise I'm sure would use easily forged card like use expect goverment use sort database track got else would using card now. One more. Assuming religion. Classic Arnab da X Even 18th, understand 14 days needed full effect. hope vaccine least reduce quarantine time. mask distance like vaccine.  want get back life again. wisely.  Happy free indoors 


Thats right biritish people civilized. also isn’t. [This explains well. Cousin works NHS nurse. Hospital workers got Pfizer jab fell ill day two, completely fine afterwards. think lot vaccination horror stories overblown. Like... side effects completely normal allergies common vaccines general probably take it.

My dad got first jab two weeks ago sore arm day. Oh come man

“The J&amp;J vaccine known non-replicating viral vector vaccine, using common cold virus called adenovirus 26.

Scientists made vaccine taking small amount genetic material codes piece novel coronavirus integrating weakened version adenovirus 26. J&amp;J scientists altered adenovirus enter cells, cannot replicate make people sick.

AstraZeneca uses similar platform, adenovirus comes chimpanzee.”
So even though astra claim 90% didn’t hold it’s certainly better 60% getting j&amp;j. I’m becoming suspicious j&amp;j stock point lol. sold novavax last Friday dog fight except advocating fellow man now...

I find tweets people government stating numbers guess that's necessary. trying make point reaching numbers nations definitely good position in. settling number disheartening disappointing reach much much higher countries. Canada get US/EU programs..India cannot afford send vaccines developed countries. That's right. South Africa vaccines. read it. disagreeing. I'm saying going people take vaccine going get covid die. Many would lived took vaccine, that's point. still going tragedy family. hope right seen slew stories, PSAs lately masks required post-vaccine 95% effectiveness 100%. Also, teachers unions said go back in-person students vaccinated. could 2022-23 imagine. hope last gasp fear mongers. get vaccine, gave waited requisite amount time told Dr vaccine take hold, plan social distancing masking. “Democracy” .... 😂🤣 nice one !! Depends IBS... New York state roughly pop density yes. However new York state relies federal agencies provide vaccines. end day, fed government ensure states areas equal opportunity access vaccinations. Unless manage increase production EU Q2, vaccine little use Pfizer higher efficacy distribute basically enough doses EU Q3 together Moderna. Misinformation. 200 people maximum Budapest, one arrested reference US? US seems well certainly better continental Europe He's right state border closures. again, power. federal government join legal case Palmer brought WA government. 
Next. old man got yesterday too, relief. exact, canceled flights Mexico Caribbean...but Canadians still fly sunny destinations including Brazil Canada common sense anymore. impfdashboard.de

They delivered 95k Friday.

Germany nearly fast enough, faster 70k/week. shortage supply *isn’t* major problem right though. 

If states consistently using doses, would true.

But right 61% delivered doses administered, means additional 20million doses sitting shelves.

Also, makes way sense get system place working try spin additional supply available. second sentence final paragraph. pro-vax anti-mask anti-lockdown, point. Vaccines something known decades (if centuries) safe effective little negative effects, masks lockdowns actually negative effects new things. Plus, experiments test whether masks actually useful outdoor/uncontrolled enviornment (all mask experiments done lab/controlled environment, differs massively outdoors) aside Danish study, said masks don’t protect wearer (but didn’t say anything much masks stop spread). Fuck anti-vaxxers tho. that, fully agree. multiple scientific sources say proof either way mean safe blindly assume vaccine ever reach everyone. millions, maybe billions people never vaccinated never be. Even best possible circumstances probably vaccinate 50-75% world.

But world lots viruses new viruses emerge time. Addressing getting back lives never required 100% successful vaccine treatment unanimous global effort anything like that. reducing impact risk something everyone live with, adopting risk. Like perfectly normal millions people die every year flu, tuberculosis, malaria see global lockdowns. Anything north Bristol North.  feel grand scheme things, European countries likely reach herd immunity 6-16 weeks UK although annoying cost lives *that* long considering thought going multi-year pandemic  look liberal states like California New York fared... that's answer opinion = pushing agenda?

* Fact: Pfizer vaccine best vaccine available (along Moderna, one primarily American).
* Fact: Germany several countries wanted buy Pfizer doses early.
* Fact: EU seized negotiations stalled several months.
* Fact: deliveries delayed several months.
* Fact: Thousands people likely die delay, economy need locked several months longer.

Your turn. even think proven contagious? possibility well?  don’t think gets much credit one. Anybody believed “two weeks bend curve” wasn’t going tougher winter wasn’t paying attention. remember back April talk pretty much every pandemic 2 waves areas. waves US jump around regionally. HolUp Anyone else see first paragraph? going pub quick pint Friday/sat eve watching footie chatting (mostly bollocks) football tactics random guy bar rest game. Small things never knew missed  What? Birmingham!

Anything north Bristol North. Fact. I’m sorry get hysterical peace Northern Ireland. 

And isn’t uk press arms it, Irish President also fairly annoyed. They're also exporting vaccines.  DARPA. likely people aren’t contact covid environment measure effectiveness shot. That’s stopped SARS vaccine. I’m bowled every single person involved programme. It’s going well, high hopes summer. Software engineer here.

The problem government contracted Deloitte work, no-bid contract. Deloitte is, uh, well-regarded software industry. many private companies better-suited work like this. 

Hell, many modern insurance companies hospitals reasonably talented in-house software shops would vastly better-suited work. really pumping hyperbole helping case.

However, much nuanced that. daughter rare disorder severe intellectual disability. school system done almost nothing 11 months. still unable communicate wants needs us effectively even though making progress last March AAC. wife cannot work trying educate daughter virtually requires wife act one-on-one aid 16 hours per week.  


Under IDEA school system required law provide Free Appropriate Public Education. nothing last 11 months appropriate. Obviously, oblivious pandemic - done everything facilitate school her. growing body evidence school safe virus transmission schools generally lower broader community.  


Further, needs completely ignored local school board. stopped holding public forum March 2020 ignored many e-mails, video messages, even story published local newspaper - declined comment. Meanwhile, president teacher's union get's face time board every meeting board almost exclusively discussed concerns teachers. 


Our teachers first vaccination, getting priority people pre-existing conditions, 65, still refuse even go back work in-person teach vulnerable populations students: homeless, ESOL, disabled. administrator required in-person since July 1 - comparable 2-5 children classroom, work person others every day. teachers would take 2-5 students per classroom it. 


Kid's learning. Many facing mental health issues going unaddressed school psychologist seeing them. CPS referrals 34% prior year. Abusive parents beating children less, seeing getting kids help. teachers going skip line get vaccine, go back work. moved goal posts adults children need vaccinated go back.  Thanks interesting. seems like days either deathly afraid Covid conspiracy theorist... in-between.

I wondered hospitals regions incentive count higher covid deaths, maybe unintentional perverse incentive, like maybe hospitals get funding resources staff higher count, something like that.

Also statistically virus really dangerous elderly health conditions, 80-90% fatalities occurred group. think reported known? Polls show average person thinks chance getting virus dying virus 15-25%. young healthy people tiny fraction risk many things. Sorry can't accept logic goes every single country manufacturing vaccines like EU, India, China, Russia, etc. Nobody finished vaccinating entire population. Shit India gifting vaccines countries. US instituted fuck everyone else policy, yes creating excuses. American exceptionalism finest. I’m sure shocking. less 10 people wore masks crowd 10 2 wearing properly.

Aye couple local pubs normal menu burger via takeaway (just eat etc). Trying one every two weeks help keep open. I’m gonna sink first pilsner beer garden summer like it’s nothing one pointing finger country, problem AZ breaching contract, stated EU receive orders wherever contract compromise contract.

It says Europe production come strictly Europe.

Insanity saying weeks delivery deadline miss delivery 50 million vaccines, 80 million 100 million. know, seems like exactly interview one La Repubblica. interview released AZ-EU contract basically whole comment background.  idea. 

You have, however, already provided source saying case. many 5G chips Bill Gates activate /s r/britishsuccess Ball licker UK must hope SA variant doesn’t hasn’t already hit ground much, appears AZ vaccine significantly less effective.

Welllll AZ vaccine go dumpster. vaccine protect one strain useless makes strain dominant one. almost Come Montreal, Ill meet airport wanna try.... That’s gets attention. believe AZ vaccine actually proven effective longer delay rather 3 week second dose.

Did Ian McCubbin, manufacturing lead UK vaccination task force, say initial supply actually comes Netherlands Germany. Yes no? shouldn’t way  Can't hoard vaccines, EU master race  know what? That's fair

But theres still young people acting like they're invincible nothing bad happen THEM. point im trying make actions might kill someone else indirectly. 598,389 doses Jeremy? That's _*insane*_ Bingo! aren’t excuses it’s fucking truth. Sorry can’t accept that. That's get hacving Merkel buddies there. talk Von der Leyen bad everything promoted away EU commision.. fuck germany again. “degree” normality already majority states right now, within couple months. see summer rate normality minor restrictions there. Fingers crossed. Probably easy, already can’t move another part state snap finger worry dude, vaccine roll slow, enough 5G go around everyone! mine Saturday (final year physio student) - great main concern gov still saying 12 weeks 2nd jab, there's zero evidence effective spaced far apart (Pfizer trialed 3 weeks apart).

WHO BMC asking half 6 weeks know want many possible 1 jab resistance bring numbers down. 

All well good could potentially mean jabs might waste long term? should. 

Gotta admit, risking peace northern Ireland bit strange hill die though. disaster Sanofi fucked everything end

Which feel far away all. Almost 12% country vaccinated 6 weeks 2 vaccines. Pfizer &amp; AZ ramping 2 weeks. Moderna arriving (already approved) March Novavax J&amp;J approved March arriving numbers April.

Could see fit healthy 20 year olds vaccinated local university J&amp;J supply May-June time. Fridge temperature &amp; lowest effectiveness also lowest side effects single dose needed. Unis infrastructure set testing every student twice Christmas travel, need able vaccination. 

The end literally so, close! vulnerable dad yesterday morning called mum 5pm got one too, 15 minutes later. Well pleased. Hebrew articles say feels fine, mild symptoms. Notice narrative changed vaccines came out. media thrives fear mongering, instead pandemic going forever scary new variants havent 12k variants entire pandemic. I’ll hang grandma she’s vaccinated otherwise we’ll hang outdoors masks on. massive droves grandmas elderly people swarming every business? live near two senior apartments barely see elderly folks regular times. I’m following regulations need balance It’s unbelievable isn’t it. They’re bad antimaskers point. It’s ridiculous patience run extremely thin. live fantasy world. delay ordering vaccines late november order hundreds millions wrong vaccines (french, belgian) countries demand piece cake, instead known working german one.

YES EU'S FAULT. And? EU sending us vaccines nowhere close US vaccines per capita (and neither Canada) fuck excuses. US acting exactly like everyone expected it. get nonstop lockdown nonsense from? feel consequences failing people. keep waiting, killing economy people.  links show absolutely proof show speculation may proof. Also went got hair done salons shut saying ""getting roots done essential""--justifying saying ""I'm public eye"". Jeez arm would ache that. one ""national"" lockdown April, technically state lockdowns, started time. that, apart Victoria bit Sydney, one else lockdown longer days.  Okay so, article giving facts without telling entire truth. 

Every year 80 000 South Africans die TB, that's normal year health system running well can. last year though, there's LESS TB tests government prioritize testing Covid, knowledge, number 30%, could more, really far fetched posit large portion excess deaths people arent treated TB simple fact even know now. might result Covid pressurizing medical infrastructure, impossible create 1:1 relations vis vis Covid excess deaths country like South Africa. that's take account rule thumb every percent unemployment goes up, .01% population dies. South Africa thst would 56k excess deaths. 

This pop poo threat SA variant, work SA health. I've lost 3 patients week Covid. story much complicated deaths Covid cases. wealthy enough car get free one town! Yes, malpractice, Hogan cares money. He's scumbag fraud. everyone else got it, sure. didn't. Yes, China kidnaps Uighurs others. Police checkpoints random inspection part.

Time get healthy like athletes got developed myocarditis. post above... case/person visited lot locations... sounds like worst case timing people may exposed. new strains probably better careful act now. 'lower' efficacy vaccines still prevent long Covid (AZ JJ). 100% efficacious serious disease.

Pre-pandemic, experience, anti-vaccine folks split evenly far right far left. first hardcore experience parent anti-vax folks west coast left leaning parents. 

Today, I’m based Midwest despite politics pandemic, plenty liberal individuals, including patients practices hospitals work with, deferring plan completely skipping vaccination. everyone died recover die Ok.

here's thing.

***if*** Pfizer said 4 month delay.. we'd part way Phase 2 Trials now.

that's untenable

so run trials 4 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

but vast majority standard vaccines administered 2 month gap.

(to birth get Hep B - booster 1-2 months later.

at 2 months get ton vaccines boosters coming 4 months.

&amp;#x200B;

....is COVID vaccine different 4 weeks really necessary (despite fact data have)? Soooo...zero evidence assertion, assume? Please stop using students going without food reason open schools.

###**CDC Updates Contraindications COVID-19 Vaccination**

— Casts wider net allergic reactions vaccine components

The CDC logo close syringe drawing vial COVID-19 vaccine
Anyone history immediate allergic reaction severity component mRNA COVID-19 vaccines polysorbate vaccinated, CDC said updated interim guidance.

While previously agency released guidelines contraindication vaccination, broadened include history immediate allergic reaction previous dose component mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, including polyethylene glycol.

In addition, people developing severe allergic reactions anaphylaxis first dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine receive second dose.

All ingredients Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna vaccines listed CDC ""interim clinical considerations"" document posted agency's website (see Appendix B). Polysorbate vaccine ingredient included people sensitive may also react polyethylene glycol.

People allergy histories involving substances considered allergist/immunologist referral determine receive vaccine, agency said call clinicians.

""This guidance updated primarily starting days, people got first dose eligible receive second dose thought providers needed guidance,"" said CDC's Sarah Mbaeyi, MD, call. ""We continuously reevaluating guidelines make sure based best available information, providers information available people started coming second dose vaccines.""

CDC guidance defined ""immediate allergic reaction"" hypersensitivity-related signs symptoms urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress wheezing, anaphylaxis occur within four hours following exposure.

But important distinguish allergic reactions symptoms, vasovagal symptoms vaccine side effects. Mbaeyi noted 90% people anaphylaxis present skin findings, ""which helpful distinguishing allergic reactions reactions.""

She added immediate allergic reactions occur within 15-30 minutes vaccination, whereas vaccine side effects, fever, chills fatigue, occur median 1-3 days following vaccination.

Those immediate allergic reaction vaccine injectable therapy related COVID vaccine component polysorbate requires balance risks benefits vaccination. Mbaeyi said cases, vaccination may deferred individual may wish consult allergist-immunologist.

Risks may include risk exposure SARS-CoV-2, risk severe disease death, unknown risk anaphylaxis ability patient vaccinated appropriate medical care immediately available anaphylaxis.

However, before, history allergic reactions related vaccines, injectable therapies components mRNA vaccines -- food, pet dander, latex -- contraindication vaccination, Mbaeyi said.

Those precaution vaccination history anaphylaxis due cause observed 30 minutes following vaccination, persons observed 15 minutes afterwards.

Tom Shimabukuro, MD, also CDC, said cases anaphylaxis following COVID-19 vaccination received outsized media attention. ""These still rare events,"" said.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, good % know grandstanding never getting Covid shot haven’t careful already gotten Covid. One couple reinfected already (once March August). Snakes wild boar. Many doubted UK's competence pull off, less production. Many derided wheels would fall off. didn't. 

Additionally, imagine EU told EU countries similar thing... go plan! global pandemic, nothing certain. 'Brink collapse' bit overstatement. state (SC) miserable first things getting better. Now, biggest problem lack supply. ran doses mass vaccine site near us early Friday. govt signed contract 200 million doses existing companies obligations countries extra doses aren’t shipping summer. 

I’m hoping Johnson Johnson vaccine ramped way then, holding breath. South African variant state, without mask mandate might end well. county highest infection rate nation maybe we’re close herd immunity anyway, haha. Im board mindset well. theoretically everyone gets vaccine asymptomatic cases cares? ""If tree falls forest one around hear it, make sound?""

I say definitely concerned news stories like though people like ""oh see vaccine doesnt anything"" without looking like 3 seconds article. (UK) many vaccines order need. 

I assume pace carries on, we'll start send vaccines countries come summer.  got 5000 today Arizona considered good. Canadians low rates vaccination. supply restricted, far 2% population partially vaccinated, compared 5-10% US UK. guarantee supply ramp quickly spring either.  Covid outside lungs wimp lots UV, open windows houses plenty Vit really trimmed down... Summer natural enemy. believe it. US great too. wanted put context. I’m saying entirely overall rollout get it, we’ll probably see hundreds thousands. think Hawaii is? fair last summer absolutely magnificent. thing spoiled stop dying, lovely. people say rushed vaccines vaccines history long term side effects. would see side effects immediately. vaccines given hundreds thousands i'm good them. get saying known carcinogenic, choice vaccine get imma get pfizer fuck jnj Everyone might struggling, amount. even close.

Imagine kid living poverty right now. They're food insecure, internet access, stable home. School safe kids.

There small risk letting go back school substantial reward so. science based argument forcing continue suffer home. losing entire generation kids due school shutdowns taking consequences seriously enough. reason airports stayed open long March, even Italy collapsed. Airlines lot lobby power. Sweet shutdown EVERYTHING 2 months. mean everything. Oh toilet broke day 2? Sorry you’re getting plumber day 65. internet went day 5? Sorry one’s gonna able come fix 60 days. Oh power entire neighborhood including hospital went out? Tough shit. We’re thing 2 months.

That’s would take eradicate based spread. aren’t going get heterogenous western society countries Asia did. aren’t. NZ + AUS able full lockdowns cases low enough matter. Eradication isn’t going happen now. aren’t going get hundreds millions culturally diverse individuals play game length time across thousands miles. Forget it. Stop expecting people give entire lives can’t get 500+ million diverse people exact thing 2 months. sociologically going happen.  got vaccinated Dodgers Stadium January 20 feel though proprietary interest group morons.

I know arrested immediately. pictures, small group could immediately taken away scene without delaying vaccination. obvious point discrepancies - POC color nothing Target (for example) arrested group insane white people actively endangering health thousands people allowed run free would taken ten minutes put paddy wagon.

The people vaccinated currently 65 health personnel. lines long enough is. waited two hours start finish last week - long time want avoid using Porta-Potty :-).

This group morons wreaking havoc around Los Angeles. invaded health food store without masks. AZ produced SII India sold cost. Sold double more.

[South Africa pay $5.25 dose AstraZeneca vaccine India's Ultra-Orthodox Jews actually get vaccinated denounce see eventual death, God? article see mass gatherings Jewish people, always turn (Ultra) Orthodox Jews. doubt it. Amazon vested interest New Normal. many accounts have? American? way government set target expect beat. “We 20m deliveries, let’s say 15m stretch goal” mean one made ms word printed kinkos? yeah sure one going copy that. logic would dictate US prisoners restrained migrants vaccinated either. people deemed fit live book, guess. risk? It’s mostly AZ vaccines 8-12 weeks optimal time second dose. AZ CEO even said publicly. adults teachers vaccinated fall, there’s need anymore covid measures since that’s people concerned about. Kids extremely low risk covid isn’t much need social distancing remote learning thinks bigger risk leave half people without vaccination all. 2 grandparents 2 doses - would do? Sources Distance learning remotely comparable real thing

I disagree. what?

This argument stupid. we’re really arguing:

You: “We over-reacting coronavirus.”

Me: “Our response coronavirus appropriate.”

This bigger debate settled reddit. Time tell history judge what’s going on.

It’s pointless us continue arguing here. Nothing say going convince change mind, nothing say going convince either.

My OPINION history going look death toll judge didn’t nearly enough. They’re going look anti-science Q-Anon Barrington nut jobs ghastly disgust wonder bat shit crazy back then. That’s believe. time tell I’m wrong right.  Better ramp vaccinations Same. One literally selfless person know. Champions bunch different causes, spends tons time volunteering, donates large percentage income, politically involved.

Just... really bad risk assessment. *sigh* one spreading FUD. Lol, understand pandemic things typically take much longer tested. I'm talking approved emergency use, know could happen long term. FUD, literally data reference.

So stop arguing emotions start arguing back logical argument. mRNA vaccines modern miracles like sniper rifles train immune system best protein build antibodies against. Think two months navy Seal training. JnJ vaccine two week general army bootcamp teaches immune system shoot gun general enemy. 

This science, data, random individuals metaphor even provide explanation useful biological mechanisms consequences work 5th grade science book. 

My decision own. make decision. pretend motivated deep understanding issue. raised legitimate concern. say trust *any* vaccine, said trust *this* vaccine. Trust earned, lying consumers decades. deserve emergency authorization, give production capacity another company's effective vaccine improve efficacy own. US could couple weeks current projected growth. expect hit finish line time manufacturing issues ease. logic, support mask mandates then? could know this?  ...Why would early?? know people who've lost taste back March still recover, also know people lost already back. Covid effects unpredictable... Cause necessary. can't use Zoom everything.

/S

It's ridiculous really. can't visit dying relatives. fuck important people travel? Everybody struggling. Suck right. Vaccinate teachers staff open. Welp, reschedule second Moderna shot Thursday since we’re get blasted snowstorm here. Unfortunately work day Friday I’m sure get it. worried side effects knocking work really tough? mild side effects first shot. ... said responsible majority deaths, normal people can’t even get vaccine yet? even read posted? find actual science support opinions. there. less rant-y guy. Imagine vaccine this, there's real way detect short time period. kids failing even getting 1/100th education would getting person school. also missing social activities, sports, extracurricular activities. Mental health also huge issue students right now. teachers unions school boards don’t care. care keeping everything closed make full salary bare minimum blame students get bad grades mental health problems. It’s proven confirmed CDC schools safe.

Also, telling people “wait little longer” incredibly stupid. People telling us months nothing ever changes. Vaccines knock park, get handle situation best need get many people vaccinated shortest amount time. agree start opening certain things earlier, people fun life without going crazy.

But expect masks public requirement core essential activities / transport critical mass vaccine opportunity achieved. sort thing cops dealing with? That'd much bigger benefit society shooting random black people. understand germ theory? We've known works 130 years.

You get vaccinated, spread disease, infect people die. imagine biggest brains... *prevent* entirely, course. significant effect transmission, even vaccines provide sterilizing immunity. hate subscribe shit read article. miss quite articles refuse join little club. newest iPhone could actually deliver needed qr code. 

Source? actually read contract? contract states orders come specific place, could even come moon EU cared.

AZ deliver, nothing more, nothing else. That's what's contract. That's legal action followed get shit straight. Spanish flu likely mutated something less deadly H1N1 never gone away.

And that's one pandemic. never achieved herd immunity smallpox, polio, numerous diseases vaccines created. reduction vaccine hesitancy people seen coworkers parents fine past six weeks promising. Maybe time we're longer prioritize people access much fear-of-something-new (as opposed standard anti-vax) hesitancy left. went wrong? actually put faith government screw things Blood hands? Wtf talking about... anti-vaxxers one main causes death vaccine isn’t even available wider population yet? Sure, I’d agree pretty much leadership incompetent considering it’s “lock everyone like they’re animals” “let everyone free discourage precautions”.  article UK vaccines extremely effective preventing symptoms. means less viral load means less shedding virus particles, therefore almost certainly reduce transmission.

And even reduce transmission, fact near absolutely effective preventing hospitalisation still makes worth it. great hear. :) idea think that. school already announced it. Hey, heard Easter... So, what’s solution then? Wait African country passes around mutation breaks antibody response go back lockdown another 9 months spool new vaccine up? no. Enough masks. tried explain mom people upset lockdowns, media, etc weren’t spring summer. One main points variants got picked news recently right vaccines started. get infected surgery, they'll probably still hospital home recovering bed, ""killing people"" Speed please, mutations looking favorable. people take JNJ one rather wait. objectively correct. immunity personal immunity get things going again. data showing two COVID-19 vaccines far less effective South Africa places tested heightened fears coronavirus quickly finding ways elude world’s powerful tools contain it.  U.S. company Novavax reported week although vaccine nearly 90% effective clinical trials conducted Britain, figure fell 49% South Africa — nearly infections company analyzed South Africa involved B.1.351 variant emerged late last year spread United States least 30 countries.  &amp; Johnson announced Friday new shot 72% effective preventing moderate severe illness United States, compared 66% Latin America 57% South Africa.  tests suggested vaccines authorized U.S. — one Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna National Institutes Health — trigger smaller immune response South Africa variant. What...why? speculation true. Schools still closed kids vaccinated. absurd. dense? upfront exporting. Canada made deal Pfizer's European lab provide vaccine. Pfizer literally making vaccine Germany gotta get vaccinated ASAP, man..... would suggest research ACES. actually shown opposite, trauma (and less resourced families I’d call trauma) affects kids rest lives way adults aren’t. Yes death parent would greater impact/trauma kids parents 60 statistically never likely scenario. People still murder even though laws murder. guess laws work. /s old technology vaccines licensed widely production facilities. Man. don’t know legal. wish would state state basis shut international travel. really need get vaccinated, man. like NOW.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* know 16 - top local news station put article. local university sequencing monitoring changes. article mentions mutation looks like might replicate easier spread faster. information received fanfare. bothers deeply started beat fear drum mutations vaccinations rolled give people bit hope. strict adherence mask requirements bay area thing. visit SF time time everybody wears mask problem. areas like Sacramento, maybe 70/30 wear mask. Also, Sac sheriff publicly said would enforce mask/lockdown orders. OC famously ignored Newsom fought back lockdown orders. saw absolutely packed restaurants downtown San Diego August. UK fund production capability Pfizer ? US ? plant UK. Please give source info, calling bullshit. think UK along roll see sooner US Wow. first graph I’ve seen clearly shows immediate benefits vaccine. Fauci needs talking DAILY. vaccine eventually reduce COVID endemic, absolutely...it take little time. vaccines huge impact hospitalizations death almost immediately? Absolutely. Telling people vaccines won’t change anything 85% population vaccinated exact opposite helpful want people take vaccine ASAP. mentioned fact evidence vaccinated means can’t carrier,

This point atrociously handled. vaccines extremely effective preventing symptoms near totally effective preventing hospitalisation. mere fact prevent virus overwhelming body point becoming symptomatic clear indicator reduces viral load therefore also reduces amount virus shed. means less transmission almost certain, even absolutely removed. HELL YEAH. got Moderna vaccine today I'm teacher Illinois's 1b group. went place efficient, thanks focused, organized, polite National Guard troops staffing it. arm hurts, tired enough need nap, feel good ready dose 2 next month! pumped. Time lick doorknobs nothing happen! (For reason, dad thought serious this.) Don’t listen neigh-sayers Unless borders stay closed limited number countries. Double win Europe.

If first world vaccinated, infections still happen epidemic risk anymore. continually vaccinate every population earth. includes rural parts Africa Asia. going happen. According guy r/Iowa that's crunching numbers keep track trajectory literally everything dropping rate faster explain 

So think we're already seeing way around. Look Amoy Gardens. One dude ill diarrhea incorrectly installed water traps caused hundreds get infected. SARS issue *so* virulent could fairly easily identify sick patients number ill people left wake. Even 150 million extremely underwhelming though. US get 200 million doses end March. includes Moderna Pfizer, probably J&amp;J. seriously doubt that's issue. Completely different. Pre 9/11 private security hiring ppl McDonalds run X-ray machines. TSA professionalized course going stay level. point everyone vaccinated req unnecessary Youre getting votes right Thank fuck I'm US closest thing saw one city banned anyone live entering early March. city island one way out, checkpoint look ID turned anyone away citizen. Think Florida Keys thing, live got turned back Champing* yeah point fair enough. 


I think one good thing come world much vaccine production capacity next time even vaccine quicker. makes sense. Good work mods. Lmao mean “their companies”? Pfitzer US company last time checked. Bro, people satisfied *healthcare*. Again, bother you? Moderna literally published study said 81% effective first dosage. refusing believe actual facts? That's seriously exciting. Go humans. Totally agreed. Letting states know much vaccine receiving start. Mass vaccine appointments cancelled state less vaccine received state predicted. told three weeks ahead, least states accurately plan.  Tried what? thought all? fuck downvoted? Disgusting society live in... hit 10 doses administered per 100 people tomorrow. huge milestone encouragement roll-out ramping up.

Well, per 100, % population. % dose second shots increase time. think hit 25% population fast, crossing fingers. Yep. it’s ok keep working it. guess would May. really kicking shit thing right Nothing reading making vaccine, bear market, money ever could spend short term readjustment allowance Peace Corps. May disposable funds. huge preference whether that's 45 due crazy lung scarring heart issues 80. Willing give months influence 

But easier say, like said, even good time went risky shit right now, anxiety let me. much choice anyways scared testing. I’ve managed avoid far. factories require extremely finicky equipment takes many months produce, must staffed experienced experts. can’t build many want, hard limits logistics chain Yes, thus comment. isn’t worth time. think dealing language barrier. study complete March 2021 trial last 12 months.

The two-dose trial year. I’m really scared vaccination percentage gonna next annoying quota meet-it doesn’t fucking matter vulnerable paranoid vaccinated, let us go back normal can’t take shit. we’re point vaccines available everyone wants one, restrictions continue that’s unacceptable.  Yep, time it’s ‘identified’ odds it’s place already. Heard somewhere expect cases go US March. Quite frankly doubt 2021 end it. plans failing big time. Everyone wants thing there’s 0 coordination global scale.  know certain governors election soon could put pressure. CoughNewsomCough. You’ll probably able travel pretty freely / safely you’re vaccinated, traveling places heavily vaccinated. unvaccinated traveling countries highly vaccinated likely restrictions.

I imagine mandatory testing remain thing traveling to/from certain countries .

Also case spikes certain countries could rolling restrictions. vaccinated people asked still wear masks: might get sick still spread it. come. dad certainly annoyed times days he'd simply grateful say know cared much. Shit tell COVID ass last week got co-worker, got laid off, drive 2,000 miles quarantine home.  ""It's looking increase strength"" sure that. seeing natural course virus propagate evolve. 

I also think viruses weaken time (""peter out"") think R0 falling human activity (""seasonal""). theory true would love HIV flu become obscure. 

I hope I'm wrong easy see lot conversation broad generalizations. Also keep chin mRNA technology side quickly come booster shots address variants; I'm confident Moderna/Pfizer already it.  GAVI alliance specifically. Serum Institute India licensed manufacturer Oxford/AZ vaccine major signatory alliance. We’ve giving vaccines US month now.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* calculate 1,05% though? cannot see denominator 0-13 group spreading misinformation. guess feel strange agenda doesn’t work outside echo chamber? Happens :) know there’s period getting final shot vaccine becoming fully effective. wonder time contracted.

I’m subscribed, can’t read article. mention imagine purchasing vaccines manufacturers late probably help much short term. Seems best approve J&amp;J asap focus ramping production currently approved vaccines know CDC. paid attention CDC said every virus. spread schools. lot. Right politics economics seem reign supreme CDC compromised. logical reason virus *higher* R0 value (transmission rate) influenza would somehow spread schools. completely absurd. use N95 mask, nursing mask it, face shield that. appreciate link though. also add teach practice science living. even remotely ignorant regarding transmission highly infectious disease. understand pressure CDC ""save economy"" telling people safe there. Even remove steel toed boots. depends mean Nature.

Nature anything, conscious. not, instance, opposing force would try keep humans alive near extinction. We're always pushing planet's human carrying capacity, disaster always happens. 

It's like, skyscraper falls strong wind, gravity's tripwire? No. Gravity blind, makes everything fall. We've able push limit building height higher higher, there's penalty - Small buildings fall sympathetically I'm fear think else lies wait.

More animal-borne viruses long people eat meat. pollution-related problems long hydrocarbon fuels burned energy. Lead still problem places, water supplies, aviation gas, etc. People still fight religion. clear imperialism really ended, racism poverty hunger sure didn't, always people want make democracies back monarchies.

What scares can't coordinate well. solutions problems mostly knowable feasible, hard keep everyone page. seems like mind-viruses form almost instantly spread online way faster biological virus, form cysts protect treatment.

I think hardest problems facing now, next 100 years so, fields physics, medicine, chemistry, psychology. get people unite _before_ millions die? _Before_ tens millions lost? anal swabs... deploy tear gas pepper spray protesting racial inequality! That's people interpret ""you still wear mask vaccinated"" ""you wear mask forever"". honestly point can't understand difference. go back normal rate spread severe illness declines. happen people get vaccinated, instant. haha looks like someone burst already got nut ;) president willing expend enough political capital anything. guys going die. It’s shameful. Good luck, Commander. Ah, see! I'm assuming based community column. Would need someone knowledge Israel Hebrew confirm that. That's shitty move short notice also concerning. Afaik, company said production issues resolved and, instance, Germany track next week. also heard nothing shortfalls UK. Pfizer reallocate / shuffle deliveries customers? would deeply concerning. that's case, commission step new export control Powers ensure every customer gets proportional delivery. America worst covid outbreak world. fully understand exporting vaccine.



this good read Avoid topic political comments. 'you poor lazy, go get job' COVID response Avoid topic political comments. know (yet) long bodies product antibodies covid, effective diminished response would get another infection (i.e. 9 months past, antibodies reduced 50%).

It's likely we'll looking booster shots covid, much like influenza. Predictions made variant go around (which wrong, know), we'll probably look annual booster next years. Even reaching herd immunity (low 80s%), covid going disappear forever. Nope People vaccine still spread virus? Someone live got vaccinated last week still might wear mask around he's cougher never covers them. Wearing mask ""restriction"". compared alternative lockdowns, social distancing barely even ranks inconvenience. Also terrorists apparently: [Alleged 9/11 mastermind, Gitmo detainees start getting COVID   implies male parent impact, case. think anger towards previous US President taking crisis seriously still strong, lot people think responsible thing stay vigilant longterm. 

A lot people think even talking restrictions lifting sign want let guard down. Keep wailing echo chamber bursts..  Live ideals. governments change people don't? EU officially purchase Novavax yet? Last heard concluded exploratory talks sure meant actually signed contracts everything purchase it. may slight problem. mean J&amp;J, pfizer, modenra AZ think combined mean sizeable supply vaccines summer. Probably enough entire population cover atleast elderly/vulnerable decent amount rest population. hope EU approve J&amp;J quickly pfizer we're rather slow approval Great title burn, Dozens....  Australian politics work possible election? isn’t scheduled? need vaccines Polio many diseases.

Today polio vaccination day.Approx 9 million kids 5 years age got drops administered. world fundamental religious bigot. Since vaccines haven’t studied approved purposes reducing transmission, standard CDC guidelines quarantine exposure would apply.

Basically we’re assuming transmission unaffected vaccine safe side. One thing I’m pretty glad about, I’m weeks away really bunkering 2nd shot, I’m really glad never get covid test. Sounds super uncomfortable, can’t handle things going nose like that. race-baiting headlines annoying. numbers different mean anything nefarious going on. 

I'm also tired articles make excuses anti-vaxxers. black make anti-vax beliefs less ignorant.  Masks social distancing restrictions. Saying need keep restrictions ot avoid restrictions meaningless. Why?

Am missing something? don’t companies share fórmula boost manufacturing beat thing faster? don’t get Pharma company “make” Jan 20th. week passed. Delete this. actual fuck Apologies, realize text article referring to. whole article image? That's odd. True, also, point stupid enough several weeks food necessities put aside? understand truly can't afford buy anything extra, even cans week, everyone else REALLY prepared now. Either stop exports Europe orders start fulfilled.

Enough acting like cool/moderate union. Pharma fucking Europe put block weight them. sometimes soon, people stupid follow rules. get Pfizer Moderna? [Which one admit didn’t read anything headlines. Curevac provide data March. seems promising far. teamed ""Bayer"", German pharmaceutical company. please go back /r/conservative and/or /r/conspiracy belong That's.... That's odd side effect want isolate zero risk isolate forever. Really surprising, but, man, really nice. 

I actually lose hope actual contribution western (US, Europe) world vaccination distribution, hoard much. also pains China vaccines distributed approved wider (we Indonesia China's instead).

Now India making lot distributing lot also; India, China, Russia vaccine, real hope developed countries. Old enough married 9/11 happened. 

Old enough remember confused reporting day anger fear days after.

That sounds like America, right. nice sentiment overwhelming bulk carbon emissions personal transportation Isn’t 65+.

Hell, death rate group around 5%. would think means hospitalization rate much higher. 317/600,000 0.0005283333 immune... vaccine 100% effective... vaccine is. something that's .05% effective good... means 99.95% effective... top 16 people got sick 5 die die? That's tiny I'm calculating out... awesome, happened? seen saw Perth shutdown. thread lost lot impact, ,lol. kids really resilient remember period lives long fed around family fine.

Idk cooped anxiously afraid illness held forms social contact might leave kids mental issues growing up. Idk ""kids resilient"" narrative comes from, childhood trauma affects adulthood. enough Twisted Teas this. I'm lazy write full names.

[Popovich joined former NBA center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar help league’s efforts encourage players general public receive COVID-19 vaccine. mine yesterday (Sat), massively grateful - Cat 4 - extremely clinically vulnerable. Sinus infection Well. narrow view this. Mutations appear long many people get infected, need bit luck take years world vaccinated, mention 70-80% vaccination rate needed herd immunity. least vaccination means less go hospital. 
Perhaps learn change/prepare society easier time overcoming next pandemic.  Somebody tell Coronavirus alive, need protect one trillion Coronavirus lives versus one human. playbook? Avoid recall? Lynch asymptomatic. already knew that, frankly, asymptomatic case getting even better vaccines possibility. Headlines act like surprised, fearmongering probably right terms statistics. catch nobody knows **can** anybody know exact time given point mutation virus occurred. 'probability' mutation occurred whatever segment population vaccinated whatever country. This, however, probability, certainty. 

There way God's green Earth anyone tell 'when' something simple point mutation happened. may right even mutations occurred prior (recent spotty) vaccine provision. country, except perhaps Israel, achieved anywhere near coverage significant selective pressure direction vaccine resistance. 

What situation 'can tell' approximate time mutation ? done genomic studies bacteria eukaryotes. cases researcher looks whole genes, counts number point mutations hazards guess informed fact different genes mutate different rates. are, however, 'molecular clocks' time zones, 100% accurate. 2 difference - recent. 10 differences - time ago. 50 differences - heading deep time. doubt vaccinations affecting *cases*, could affecting *hospitalizations* especially *deaths* (since predominantly elderly prioritized vaccination). reason say 3 weeks thats data for.

Avoiding “hard border” “condition peace stability island following many tragedies”.

Who said it? recently tried create one? It’s bias. “misinformation” questioning effectiveness masks lockdowns banned. Infrastructure capacity 2.1M per week place since Jan 15, 3.5M doses delivered far. right capability, wrong reason.

Edit: wrong target. 3.5M per week Archived link: Virus evolve evolve. purpose direction. Sometimes becomes infectious, sometimes becomes less. speak absolutes. ill vaccines approved? wondering he's vaccinated? Many schools throughout country re-opened, lead big outbreaks. See, example, It’s estimated one-third Americans actually infected point since epidemiologists predict three undiagnosed cases every one diagnosed case. 26 MILLION cases means epidemiologists predict million Americans prior infections. means it’s slowing down; maybe evolving hopefully less dangerous pathogen (but that’s unlikely long term damage inconsequential evolutionary path). Dr Drosten Germany pretty chill. says always want hear, go overboard language.

You able speak German though rarely gives interview English.  little sister received second round vaccination Friday (she's nursing student, university vaccinated since go hospital). 

If wait 2 weeks good come visit inside house masks, right? confirmed can't transfer covid somebody yet vaccinated? true aren’t getting yet don’t want cut line. It’s turn yet.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 👀 $gme whole point rich. get cut line. doubt vaccines account cases decreasing quite yet, maybe hospitalizations due elderly prioritization. 😖😖 It’s shame became politicized early bringing notion simply asking question made “conspiracy theorist” belonging “that party.” past two decades rapid rise number labs engaged research, that’s mention unknown number secret / criminal labs run books. look probability everything perfect every day nothing get out, factor time, maybe it’s 1 year, maybe it’s 10 years, maybe it’s 100 years, eventually would human error would provide opportunity something get out. would need get lucky once. time, eventually, one million odd comes true. Unfortunately. ones get lot, people judge others know fairly mundane things, friends. Since ""know friends smart it."" friends well took lot precautions, can't apply logic strangers??? 

I'm getting really sick blatant hate strangers assuming worst them. Talk us vs mentality. people whine country divided...... maybe helping division? Ever mulled that? Still? schools driver spread locked down? Why? Vaccines knock likely fall  It’s unlikely haven’t done enough studies rule precautions recommended stay place Since he's 100 years old, vaccinated week+ ago ?

Or soon vaccination take effect. saying statements true cant refute must resort personal attack?  Lol subs shit Taking variables account, still believe transition toward normalcy **likely** second quarter United States, downside risks increased. early vaccine doses reach significant percentage high-risk elderly individuals end quarter one, combination protecting groups arrival spring northern hemisphere improve situation compared United States now. Depending vaccination progress summer (whether United States earlier later end herd immunity window), may smaller fall wave disease third fourth quarter potential transition toward normalcy months encouraging, many signs suggest next six eight weeks difficult. Case death numbers near all-time highs many locations, new variants may accelerate short-term transmission, vaccine rollout yet proceeded far enough protect much population. Strong public-health measures remain critical saving lives period.

I think carefully wording perception management purposes. However, shall see. opinion point actions taken drastically make happen. I’m already seeing people rural/suburban areas walking around maskless. people keep numbers high make transition even difficult justify.  see people giving fuck right tons ignoring lock downs local bar never closed despite strict restrictions 

People ignore accept death toll like every previous pandemic history

The evidence clear: schools major driver covid spread. need re-open damage children already have. burn white house Calling Dr Darwin. agree people expect one go anywhere covid isn’t thing? That’s impossible goal perhaps it’s something else. top notch idiot. earned sir captain. titles, perfectly appropriate use both.  FYI, allowed question anything that's labeled ""good news"" sub get downvoted hell. bleeds, leads. UK vaccination curve looks faster linear growth, maybe quadratic?

They decide go maximum recommended time delay second dose though, 12 weeks/3 months first vaccination. maximizes first dose availability.

I glimpsed number fully vaccinated people UK, equal Germany go shorter end recommended second dose timeline 3-4 weeks Agreed, interim, vaccines go vulnerable at-risk power circumvent protocol act right. 

But live real world know nefarious people be.

Frankly, long shots make arms, even don’t deserve initially, best distribute correctly, I’m happy. I’d rather happen destroyed anti-vaxxers (see:Wisconsin pharmacist). less is, spent months haggling price ""Spreadneck"" I'm gonna steal that.  Please point disinformation link research paper showing viruses always evolve become less virulent ‘reasons’. Ebola isn’t airborne sick isn’t constitutional right. Vaccine you’re fired. Simple. healthcare worker, it’s unacceptable put colleagues patients risk. too.  Yep HCQ debunking study even retracted wrong agreements disallowed releasing “Our independent peer reviewers informed us Surgisphere would transfer full dataset, client contracts, full ISO audit report servers analysis transfer would violate client agreements confidentiality requirements."" one roughly 20,000 people received doses clinical trial developed severe covid-19, suggesting vaccine powerful protection dangerous cases disease.

This important would think first glance. shows vanishingly unlikely get severe COVID-19 immunized. also, vaccine lowers viral load asymptomatics enough, also stop spread disease, thereby stopping pandemic.

I’m thinking vaccination, it’s easy focus much personal risk. epidemiology populations, lot lowered risk vaccines comes people around transmitting disease. effect nonlinear.  tested South African volunteers amongst African countries. Interesting. Based article, Fort Stockton I-10 even vaccines, would good spot vaccine hub bunch towns Big Bend. way Something something anywhere north Watford Assume US chart would quite different vaccination ordering different (e.g. US vaccinated least teachers simply teachers, UK purely healthcare age/CEV) anyway saying one better other, different impacts. 

My prediction US one would cases going lower sooner, deaths possibly not? messaging put confusing. Last week Fauci said unlikely vaccine causing drop cases. We're reaching dipping point we've seen before. would say 2023 sounds right. H1N1 like 2011? Heck. ceo Pfizer take vaccine.  told need know. 

If ceo Pfizer would gotten cases family rich friends.


The nba forbid superstars getting vaccine.  tell you. evidence shows schools major driver spread.

UK doctors seek review 12-week gap vaccine major British doctors’ group says U.K. government “urgently review” **decision give people second dose Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine 12 weeks first**, rather shorter gap recommended manufacturer World Health Organization. year this, I'm giving life anyone's grandma anymore. got live life free shit. care.

There's major snowstorm ongoing northeast get Tuesday night. lot vaccine sites shutting days this. Again, EXPERTS believe available data indicates certainty health issues eventually go away, absolutely zero justification assume so.

Covid kill people 50 people still health issues year+ later. spouting bullshit WANT believe hate lockdowns hate needless death suffering. 

(I took look history see deal was, entire Reddit persona seems anti-lockdown rants. I've seen enough.) Still prefer Van Diemen Land. UK production make dent EU demand. used worst affected per capita country minute. 
Essentially UK production would little good EU lot good UK wish one pacific island countries would take ""let run"" approach. long thought interesting countries ""success"" COVID come general region. (AU, NZ, Japan, Vietnam, China, Singapore) Despite different governments racial make up, rest world failed.

I strongly suspect immunity might existed travel sphere COVID thing. Probably similar infection similar source running unnoticed. Israel paid almost twice per dose.

Imagine living competitive market society. True. got one early due health history travel. change anything. Get vaccinated soon becomes available. Well “miracle” happen next 3 -5 months everything open summer. Delegated. Like everything else. Yes. COVID November still struggle fatigue minor symptoms sometimes. Overexertion seems trigger it. I’m 75% normal now. wonder would tables turned, EU really well, would help UK? Would Canada help US? 

I feel bad countries read UK making records, someone mentioned me, UK US need lot (so EU tho) can't wait 2030 saying ""let's make party lit Summer '21"" one safe everyone safe [The Sputnik vaccine could approved EMA personally cousin covid back early December still fatigue despite nearly 2 months. coworker mine covid fine around 2 weeks apart loss taste came back week later. Could long covid maybe personally cousin covid back early December still fatigue despite nearly 2 months. coworker mine covid fine around 2 weeks apart loss taste came back week later. Could long covid maybe Marines. Yeah. Someone though, turn claim though...  True, always get flux people asking similar things similar fears, plus venting people many options one sane places pro-science also shut critical thinking. 

If seeing thing often might sign spending much time here. Nothing personal, probably need take breather, too. That's wrong, vaccine blessing save hundreds thousands lives, poorer countries. Considering safety, efficacy (especially preventing serious cases worse), cooling requirements sheer volume produced, much better anyone could hoped 10 months ago. forget, best vaccine one get people's arms. 

That people individually might prefer vaccine even higher efficacy numbers trials (this probably talking about) make subpar way. father (72) got letter yesterday book appointments gets started couple weeks’ time. I’m starting feel little relief. became famous last summer raising vast amount money charity walking garden impressive know he's 100 years old.  Hurricane coming us fast..... B117 playing around. Get ready. know we’re tired exhausted, push little longer. 9 million vaccines more, looks like finding vaccines somehow missing.

Find them? never stopped making them. Even despite EU's silly tantrum working getting plants speed, allowed confirm 9m more. Although 9m Q1 delivery ready yet. like 50% vaccinated point? hate living Netherlands right now. Awful country. end shit sight. moved US, never thought would say this, wish back. wait, China wealthy country now? /s work nursing home got mine last week too. watched 15 minutes gone. really sore arm next day, think possible hot flashes. ive felt pretty great! parent keep children home everyone luxury.  main concern focus first dose Vs second. much data efficacy vaccine without second dose 3 weeks many people already second dose pushed back (with expectation 12 weeks first)... Hopefully govts plan delaying second focusing first dose get headlines pays off...

As otherwise August. Interesting headline. Top epidemiologist makes sound like high level position government AMA something like that. switch ""A top epidemiologist"" changes important position sounds. using ""domestic supply chain"" direct enough reference inter country supply chain.

 don't. baseless assertion. many vaccinations US day average? Yea. bout go up. Brexit really paying far. Americans particularly dumb, never said that. American individualistic culture, distrust government (which partly developed govt incompetent partly self-fulfilling prophecy). 

You're comparing US Europe claim outlier, that's right comparison make. better comparison would Canada, urban population rate, colder climate similar demographic structure. US death rate 2.5 times higher Canada's. (And that's say Canada even done well. also made stunning mistake letting arrivals self-quarantine, many people do.) Lowy Institutes recent rankings well countries performed pandemic, US ranked 94th 98. US outlier. 

And know difference US NZ well since American, born raised. whole family still lives US, many friends. see posts, read US news watched friends family reacted March lockdowns. video teacher friend US comparing experiences start April. US lockdowns joke, compliance ballpark NZ Google mobility data backed up. 15 minutes ‘approach tactics’ scientific method. I’m statistician.

This right move. Props family!  ( 64,000,000 / 598,389 ) / 7 = 15 weeks

So end April first jabs end May competed second jabs.

That's insane unless worked wrong?

Edit: end July second jab unless reduce wait pretty obvious south african strain escape immunity. Either naturally acquired vaccine induced  First dose still give high immunity Sometimes, able help others, need help first... Non links directly say it, reference inter country supply chain. getting triggered, random strangers taking pictures unannounced posting pictures online lynch mobs. thread: obsessed irrational inside thread: obsessed making ""vaccine good restrictions bad"" comments every day

Winner: Thread.

Vaccines, good, indeed. mean, good.

But hope don’t get screwed deliveries one too. I'm find article mentioned lockdowns, think point need vaccinate globe. true infectious disease general. measles Mexico Argentina, find way here. morally right thing do, right thing wealthy nations' citizens vaccinate globe. I'm hopeful done. Nah I’m sure developed countries attitude towards well ???

It's 3 weeks first second UK, definitely 3 months  acting bad faith, nobody stupid. gave link reuters article UK vaccination team said it, link posted rebuttal said same, yet continue non-sense. give up. good night. Unfortunately inevitable really think much done right now. thing happens pretty much every disease. “Hoarding” produced it! We’re going use it. job wealthy countries take care world! Many people struggle pay bills living luxury. I’m sorry upsets you, it’s true. dude, disingenuous approach tactics. 

I time debate flu bros. Nothing say, source quote, logic present acceptable you. losing proposition. 

I know game. ;)

Move along. Well know much policies, given China's track record human rights pretty obvious going consider wellbeing citizens. really think China things right?

You cherry pick two countries say lockdown did/didn't work, florida california. I'm saying florida's numbers good, I'm saying places much stricter lockdowns. Across board, many examples places strict lockdowns high excess mortality (Peru, Italy, Belgium, UK) also places light restrictions (Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, Estonia) moderate low excess mortality. believe excess mortality best metric rules influence bad testing, way deaths counted, co-morbidity, etc. good database. Also, pandadata measured relationship lockdown stringency excess mortality. views rational thinking, looking actual benefit doing, versus enormous cost. 

I consider one year short period. try stop spread couple months fine, going anywhere. says saving life measures? Suicides, drug overdose, domestic abuse, diagnosed cancers, child abuse, depression, loneliness skyrocketed pandemic. know multiple people affected issues. know people getting cancer treatment this. even know someone knows someone died covid19. top that, know high percentage people die Covid old underlying issues. loved ones could compromised virus. also loved ones seriously comprised measures. difference control virus, control measures though. 

Yeah actually support Sweden's approach. Made recommendations public, kept stores schools opens, advised masks offer protection. Meanwhile people still visiting family friends. took balanced approach start, taking account well society whole. Great achievement Australia Australian government , notice redditors carry like government (which conservative ) worst world. Everyone political preference one sided platform it’s ridiculous. Btw hate trump jail. suspicion hope right people already virus might get reinfected mostly pretty mild. course good possibility wrong... know next couple months. Amazon variant exactly everywhere. virus chops it’d licking excitement many people letting guard vaccinated. Hundreds millions mindset whole point vaccine getting back normal. They’ll gathering, maskless, vaccinated people. They’re already braying won’t shop stores requires masks, feel entitled exemption masking, social distancing, intense hand washing. clamoring go back offices zoom period. 

The Amazon variant waiting. sheer biodiversity Amazon greatest weapon. expect similar variant Congo. get worse passing year sheer number people getting infected.  illegal charge vaccine. Providers run insurance insurance info provided, someone doesn’t insurance (or doesn’t give info) still get vaccine free. insurance used, insurance company must cover vaccine isn’t allowed charge customer it. guess soon general public gets access vaccine. soon buddies family get vaccine, people start letting guards down. Bayer 55 billion dollar year company. criminal Merkel ask produce. another surge; That's accepted among experts since NERVTAG released data suggesting B117 70% infectious. 
 

However, betting spring surge bad Europe's (Ireland, England, Portugal) several reasons. 1. sizeable percentage population already become infected (~30%). number growing day. Right now, evidence suggests natural infection wild type provide immunity B117 (SA variant different story). 2. number people receiving vaccinations increasing day. B117 hit countries Europe, vaccination numbers low. Unlike Europe, vaccines play pivotal role controlling B117 here. 3. seasonal backstop provide us cushion. 

Despite protections, surge happen, think bad Europe's. think things true. vaccinated reduce compliance restrictions vaccines major impact keeping people hospital.

As death rate drops hospitals empty justification restrictions Boris wants ditch soon anyway. lot do. vocal group makes Reddit think otherwise. Thats ok, nobody asking (USA) reopen want.

Could take comment CoronavirusUS? thats POV have. 

&amp;#x200B;

## issue supply can't keep people get second dose. that’s like asking horse watch dog Multi fractured queries. sweden well vaccinations then? Things becoming efficient good. comment even say lockdowns net positive whatever, says businesses become efficient, good thing. 

Why that, outside thread, sub obsessed irrational fear-mongering, inside thread, people obsessed making ""vaccine good restrictions bad"" comments every day? wasn’t drawing conclusions, that’s doing. assume politics rule breaking etc means deflated numbers disregard default selection bias occurs people aren’t required get tested. Saying group doesn’t elect get tested higher positivity rate group choose get tested questionable conclusion. provide example surveillance testing confirms traditional expectation selection bias. also takes months retrofit production lines new type vaccine (this reason Pfizer AstraZeneca meeting production targets right now, took longer expected). Luckily, fewer months building anew. family decided postpone Christmas April-ish (or later depending). saw reason absolutely celebrate Christmas December 25th.

I'm skeptical interested understanding multiple mRNA vaccines simultaneously would different multiple vaccines types Lede.  actively cheering mediocrity best. right acting surrogate everyone political power country looking survey results coming conclusion somehow value clearly happy nothing needs change what's happening here. actively choosing ignore many Americans pollster express fear getting sick injured cost treatment (not reassuring point truly happy satisfactory need medical care), but.. it, 4%... Americans think american health care system problems? ignoring that. well Americans insurance think plans OK. 

It's like executives insurance companies, probably live telling selves clearly idiot masses love fleece us hang us dry. insulting. Like telling take abuse thank abuser it. mall protests, Garcetti claimed warnings over, arrests would happen. Yet day day, unmasked protesters gather mobs aggressively endanger lives innocent people going day. fuck arrests happening? Where's leak? police refusing follow orders? PD heads refusing give enforce orders? Somewhere else chain command? FUCKING SIMPLE.

I also understand friends healthcare ""allies"" like therapists - important work done online months - getting vaccinated ahead grocery store employees? appreciate friends tbh sickens charge continue nothing least appreciated, worst-paid, most-endangered people. Yes, want vaccine, too. deserve person bagging food. explain california? time travel future. need data scientists stop wasting time making predictive models start working time travel get accurate graphs. issue administration supply. states would take anywhere 50–100 weeks vaccinated adults given current supply even administered 100 percent shots. reason they’re 50 percent they’re holding second shots evidence they’re going get increased supply feds. NPCs sense idiots Temperature huge part though. Caribbean they've basically gone back regular life months there's real Covid spike. Yet UK we've taking much seriously (yes trust me) 10 times worse. depend exponent? constitutes over? Like don’t think people public indoor settings maskless something like 60+ percent population vaccinated. exception maybe restaurants that’s don’t want restaurants go really think it’s safe.  security guards rostered 'live shifts"", go visit 30 places whilst infected. fuck held prisoner decades? thought all?  think likely outcome given vaccine producers meeting deadlines trial data accurate March we’re gonna see drastic reductions cases/hospitalizations we’ll start see phased reductions restrictions even strict places. places require mask mandates likely least mid summer fall point given vaccine suppliers live promise basically large enough percent vaccinated herd immunity. fall well start see return concerts, weddings, Unmasked life. Schools 100 percent open capacity limits over. said contingent upon vaccine suppliers actually living claims I’m dubious given slow increase supply states been.  endangering lives, public health economies.  US full self entitled babies regard well others.  “protesters” suffering mass delusion suffered psychotic break reality, safe caring thing place psychiatric hospital days purpose mental health assessment see danger others  imagine put house arrest week 1 dude entire state got sick.

horrifically authoritarian expect plumbers believe toilets work. called plumber told better shitting corner ""squatting better sitting"" and"" toilets rated shit gets flushed gets magically transported facility Bill gates uses make voodoo dolls people"", probably hire again. kinda nurses vaccines lol Lovely. Less carbon polluters sky ruining planet. Witches ones read articles! ladies gents old fashioned witch hunt!! YEE-HAWW 

/s  ordinary year, U.S. administers flu vaccine 40% population.  modest expansion current logistical capabilities needed. Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna vaccines difficult cold storage requirements. Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine stored ordinary refrigerator. don’t think much, huh? Voted Trump, yea? think enraged Europe (in particular Macron...) went smear campaign AZ vaccine. irresponsible. US - 14 nanosecond streak! I’m calling bullshit this. reaching herd immunity goal lift major restrictions like large gatherings ending mask mandates. look state like NJ. great summer soon winter hit shit got ugly again. goal reach herd immunity vaccination complete return normalcy. It’s also nothing. things phased. Ah yes horrible whore company manufacturing life saving vaccine world cost orders magnitude cheaper currently approved equivalents EU. 


Perhaps improvements AZ making EU factories yields given results extra doses coming from. 


Seems bit cynical assume pinching someone elses supply. all, refused UK supply EU would anyone else? 30% deadly hasn’t proven. *possibility* came week two ago data apparently released day two.

But new data never came, possibility became “true”.

It’s weird. 

Like, new data? story die possibility become truth? Isn’t person person question? 

Seems like it’s combo they’re citizen, want go, country take them.

If there’s nowhere guess work out. Yeah wanted get splitting hairs don’t want acknowledge fucked. carry on. say doesn’t matter more. dad wife yesterday too! Within couple weeks whole family vaccinated (other me, I’ll end). It’s really good feeling. probably getting better yields. 

Or doors AZ planning export outside europe.  happy see this! really hope US also adapts AstraZeneca. shots means closer normal much faster. Bet shot essential person?   Yes, people end hospital slip falls car accidents trying get shot snow storm. Okay yeah you’re baiting lmfao literally said would drop distancing risk vulnerable vaccinated, stressed fact 10 times cited sources, come say “but everyone won’t vaccinated then!”. 

There’s literally way take argument say seriously, clogging thread, yeah I’m ending here. replying further. Take easy. Yes, exactly that. shut society try save tiny fraction risk. Good thing country moronic views far away. exactly media institutions control news cycle continue sow chaos division. eyeballs paid advertisers, eyeballs vote outrage driven narratives hence perpetual cycle.  think pandemic behind us lot research finding certain states like FL even TX able keep everything open without super high mortality rates like Tri-State region. may come housing density prevalence multi-generational households. maybe even composition &amp; indoor conditions blue-collar non-work-from-home labor force. getting vaccine actually harm people immunocompromised can’t get vaccine. It’s really choice also harms others evidence months ago. proof. moon! live large-ish town outside Glasgow, plans open mass vaccination centre nearby, local GP's giving vaccines well. fixed result issues means deliveries behind. UK would 30 million doses everything went right country's leadership expected everything go right naïve unaware complexities vaccine development. Missing $AZN whole reason UK vaccinating quickly. hope authorize soon US Mutations happening anyways. long key groups get numbers drop good. selected groups either easier show id age easier looking good like show I'd teacher healthcare. 65 health issue even radar well people could.lie tonsils proof. whole risk groups left hard. someone's parents vaccine now. 65 plus healthier younger people. No, understand, saying life go normal everyone except high risk (people underlying conditions elderly).

What I'm saying is, impossible separate two groups. Obesity, diabetes, old age amount huge swath population. Furthermore, interact healthy working population.

Doesn't best answer seem everyone lock long possible vaccines antibodies allow herd immunity? Yeah, domestic production vaccines is/was always going key.

Lesson learnt next time. second grader depressed losing mind zoom school. He's finally real school opened up. children school virtual failing rate 70 percent. kid anomaly. Meanwhile, Canada, can't even get vaccines delivered, much less administered. Jealous AF waiting see rest world turns zombies vaccine first. apart recent lockdown WA normal, could anything wanted could pre covid exceptions. lockdown happened got lax let people back state. also say need vaccines normal make aus normalcy? need vaccines normalcy anything state normalcy vaccines would unnecessary. keep it.

💯 Depends country. likely summer exception california. Right don’t much data vaccines’ ability stop transmission virus person person. It’s mostly try keep health services overwhelmed keeping people hospitals. advocating sinovac I've read Brazil test included high risk people hospital workers every mild symptom counted.

The test standardized vaccines. Pittsburgh ""yinz"" lot people still might vaccinated?? Damn youre public health major STILL give shit people

If perhaps I'm wrong lot people vaccinated March/April, fine. million day still isnt lot compared 350 mil country. children still vaccinated fall Thank you. work grocery stores hospitals keep society going teachers somehow protected class. I've never thankful live Florida. kids happy, learning, well adjusted we've zero cases transmission school follow CDC guidelines. Locking apartments contain outbreak hardly makes North Korea decision makers admit made mistakes held accountable. He's badass nothing never Nobody surprised happened. Vaccines 100% effective.

I'm going assume he'll end asymptomatic vaccine worked imagine living united states. yikes.  COVID-19 over.

Our focus GME now. Here’s recent link [twiv 713 - Daniel twiv podcasts virologists good never histrionic. anything may seem calm discuss virus. mum one Saturday ones. She’s 78, Pfizer one. well, aside little bit sore arm. sub full kind people let community spread get control, thank sacrifices. fair really hope able make lost time point. 7 day average total doses actually increasing consistently weeks now. Hopefully continues hit 2M rolling average end February. Though point we'll need supply. Me: stay inside continue social distance/mask summer

Y'all: WANT!! VIRUS ISNT SERIOUS!!! OPEN THINGS NOW!!

that genuinely yall look thing happened Brisbane earlier year. Worked treat. damn look ernesto's gut lol efficacy stopping severe disease, hospitalisations deaths same. That's job vaccines I’m literally public health major two friends die virus think maybe you’re thinking hard enough frfr mean covid restrictions past spring aren’t happening anyways distance Britain paid AstraZeneca set production facilities UK first refusal first 100 million vaccines produced sites. words didn’t screw procurement strategy Iowa could add Busch beer. Yields vaccine production vary wildly.

It's really surprising EU plants started late underperforming factor 3. EU stumped cash sooner like UK (UK plants gov funding February, EU start August) perhaps EU plants would productive UK ones would shortage.

I'm sure productivity EU plants improve time British ones, probably much Q1 vaccines, imagine EU still get total doses later.

I really appreciate sub incredible flow information allowed navigate insane situation giving knowledge protect myself.

I’m 2 weeks second shot, major vaccine players announced, cards table it’s time get shots arms.

WE LIKE SHOTS 💉 

FOR ME, I’m going delete Reddit believe time move mentally this, especially since family fully vaccinated. Absolutly respecting state, local federal laws, everyone, resuming legal activities spending quality time vaccinated people. look forward big time, especially watching social group grow grow get shots!

Thanks great support system, honestly hope get again!

NormalCoolGuy Out. 12 Week Lockdown Now. Evidence crime? Lmao what?   delusional think everyone doesn’t believe exact thing doesn’t care people case. critical thinking whatsoever. keep repeating thing making look like idiot. That's fucking good, people part took seriously, maybe number would lessened. can.  company still misses. feel like really rain much summer south England especially, fact usually far hot dry.   Lmao- I’m cackling idea Nah, shows everyone else who's calling delusional still doesnt understand serious virus probably never first place. Tragic I’m Dr, medical advice. get dog type cannot read. like shot  Evidence doesn’t show that. Lack evidence shows it- community spread bad it’s often actually tracked. live post national world! /s gonna still sleep well night knowing many others sacrificed things save lives.

What 2 million lives saved? leaves factory,  property Yes. Brisbane issue earlier year. One case new variant. 3 day lockdown. 400+ people contact traced &amp; isolated time. went back covid-free living like 2020. Get top fast. Get rid it. Go back normal life. Worked Brisbane hopefully work Perth. Good luck them. none y'all care people LMAO. jokes. Lol idea would go summer fall winter etc wanted make sure didn’t try impose trash us. Honestly whole convo start end showed severe lack critical thinking end Boooohooooo fucking part pandemic kill people love. Sorry I'm still taking seriously summer people like y'all want lighten things right despite hospitals still overwhelmed idea Osterholm target not, least he's given us warning, prescription: Speed Vaccination Rollout! That's UK since beginning month, US needs follow cue. federal government needs move heaven &amp; earth vaccinate many seniors at-risk ppl next 2 months. Maybe can't stave sickness, dramatically reduce deaths. state much higher death rate California? close efficacy trial data clean Pfeizer. Garbage people. lmao you’re delusional that’s response literally everyone ""tiny""

ok 2nd mass funeral happening Israel 1000's attendance Thousands gather Jerusalem funeral another prominent AstraZeneca got inform asap extra 9 millions doses coming from, otherwise Britain suspect coming factories. I’m safe two weeks get second shot. That’s incredible. 

Do think something British best world queuing? time shine? I'm saying thing, certainly follow seasonal patterns. look data. Summer saw huge decline deaths, winter months started increase again. clearly follows seasonal pattern, like flu does.

I say reason weak flu season. Edgard Hope Simpson talks competition among viruses, think sarscov2 dominant virus year real possibility.

Sure isolate entire ships 40 days obvious would impact spread. well past point virus everywhere. quarantine used stop spread. stopped spread ever point.

I really take everything mainstream media grain salt. see logic comes from. 

Perhaps reason people need leave homes sanity. need connection able go things, see friends, family, travel. part life people scared death rates, weight costs would rather live life   Portugal tiny number cases right November.

When time, time.

Virus gonna virus gonna do. Excerpt: time, four known cases United States. leaders, including president, gave assurances virus would soon snuffed wrong. 26 million confirmed cases 400,000 deaths nationwide. California, 3 million people tested positive 40,000 Times tracking numbers since pandemic’s earliest days. look back first anniversary outbreak shows spread across state unfolded four distinct chapters, leading massive winter swell state still recovering virus made first footholds San Francisco Bay Area, several cruise ships carrying infected passengers quarantined sea.

EVERYBODY mishandled cruise ship passengers plus folks returning California Asia. 

PLUS folks flying Europe Italan outbreaks.

AND blame state poor contact tracing early outbreaks.

In hindsight many missed opportunities get better handle COVID-19 early on. :( Hilarious given Melbourne really summer year due La Nina. We've heater weather rain ''Summer'' 1 day high 30s. ''Summer'' pretty much rest country's winter. scale even that?

This understand either. massive need product yet reasons capacity seems planed razor thin best. increase capacity well initial firm orders anyway ? Even want finance themselves, would single government world would said asked help. fact opened plant Wales completely unrelated initial supply coming EU. Probably start going back normal elderly/vulnerable vaccinated maybe around March/April. point deaths/hospitlisations gone considerably. summer majority vaccinated probably less 70000 vaccinated Norway because, despite money buy vaccines, decided would best rely EU bumming spare vaccines Sweden. Also dumb reasons like distribute vaccines never thought 356 regions left figure plan. know much extra get done crunch-time? sustainable, short-term get things sorted lot faster there's added pressure. 
 
I currently believe AZ fucked up. believe AZ malicious, likely series unfortunate circumstances combined overpromising wrote contract. 
 
So maybe right pushing employees work overtime get sorted, increasing productivity faster originally expected. 15 Uk fyi - doses coming EU plant, UK. They’re diverted anywhere else

People conspiratorial thread AZ scaling increasing capacity EU, like UK. People forget UK didn’t start high yields.

no doubt though they’re probably moving faster increasing capacity urgently Fellow Ohioan here, think mercifully starting see vaccines dampen things bit. 

I'm hopeful numbers going fall soon level end curfew, numbers tending exactly hope Fair play. I'm used seeing govt getting lambasted (sometimes reasonably so), came thread expecting same!  You’d think called sick may red flag... hopefully get top quickly. thing can't escape. part global ecosystem whether want not. includes impoverished people, wildlife populations cannot vaccinate already massively stressed climate change.

I hope wrong, see see billion animals die Australian wildfires, 90% sea stars melt 80% kelp forests vanish, think somehow going stay separate immune mass casualty that's going years.

Pathogens evolve thin overcrowded populations. writing wall. Supermarkets started alcohol deliveries weekend Uber. Fear drinkers! Lol, I'm sure mind working bunch dumb youngsters filled COVID. help big issue shortage doses? enough doses everyone sure set mass vaccination events. right states either limiting eligibility able fulfill appointments everyone eligible due LACK SUPPLY.

Solve supply worry distribution can't keep up. Everything I've seen doses sit shelves sure get them. I’ve sent one manufacturing companies website lol Thank you, actually loled took granted good here. Testing friends family back East Coast dark ages compared Twin Cities.  remember takes 2 doses. 0.5% doses need give. Wow I’m glad I’m losing year life kid’s picture days “efficient”. Huge life lesson, totally worth Things back 95% normal that, probably April. Basically everything except large indoor gatherings. countries involved. 

Thousand sources, yet able find one. Right??? mean, realz? Can’t imagine why? Teaching think is. Americans going get vaccine free cost? worried vaccines would huge mark ups like healthcare many people dont insurance house remortgage would go without. would imagine life basically back ""normal"" memorial day. things may still altered, like know see sold NBA arena season, think things normal Glad hear that. brand vaccine effective it? Chicago Public Schools. like anybody learning anything anyway. grandma one them!! happy. I'm sure would allowed.

I guess would distributed EU vaccination scheme equally everyone ordered AZ vaccine. Yeah think July 4th gonna first real holiday while, especially since it'll warm already outside thing. deffo wait long. Let's hope people keep getting vaccinated!  doesn’t mean means supply chain domestic, ie countries involved. thousands sources joke. cope dragons live South river? What’s new estimate things back normal ? People drive cars. Anyone taken plane didnt care thr consequences begin with. Yes, like UK production scaled up, happen EU next weeks. EU slower timeline supply lines established couple months later, wind higher yield UK Teachers, show up... ELSE. 

Lol. deal British government announced Monday, Wockhardt help supply country COVID-19 vaccine doses, using CP Pharmaceuticals label Wrexham, North Wales. company set aside single fill-finish line—where vaccines packaged final manufacturing stage deployment—to build U.K. shot supplies next 18 months, Wockhardt said release. “ I’m even kidding probably worrying thing I’ve ever read use ""the domestic supply chain"" means steps production happening UK batch. really hard understand? mistake? Signing contract, upfront money get even half delivered? 57% reduction infection risk pretty awful individual level. understand good macro level, that's lot vaccinated people going end getting infected. Remember 2020 people acted cute saying: ""We know ^(Covid acts like every virus) ^(and) previous infection gives immunity near-immunity"" costs money? Thats fair argument. ad algorithms get us worse place. 100%, saying badly. saying something important going knew stay way could actually achieve it. Handing military NHS best call far.

The UK government's vaccine program something anyone would call poor point. Read article again, testing done 400 people times 70 districts = 28000 people, done Survey 1 &amp; 2 That’s correct, it’s using EU factories fill finish

Just google 

astrazeneca fill finiah wockhardt

And find sources need Yes, actually fairly impressive compared many Western countries. Obviously bigger population = vaccinators = higher volume people vaccinated. voted him, “good job Joe” stuff thread little misplaced. 

He shall named atrocious, legacy Operation Warp Speed wins. I’m thankful that. 

Joe’s big challenges going managing issues may arise new variants, enforcing healthy behaviors get lid outbreak. weather gets warmer here

The c. 75% figure 24th Jan. lot vaccines administered last week, many AZ. 

Wouldn't surprised closer to, even below, 60% right now. deadlines set AZ, ones fucked figure out.

They plenty time say can't deliver. Yeah disagree per se. vaccinated healthcare workers healthy college students, example. 

But frankly know benefit much vaccine elderly person India literally country. recognize small sacrifice big benefit others. Plus contribute vaccine research, development, logistics homeboy.

Pre-existing condition: Tested positive Homo-Sapiens first paragraph article Britain’s initial doses COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed AstraZeneca Oxford University come Europe rather domestic supply chain, country’s Vaccine Taskforce said. get saying data CDC unreliable?

Hopefully things get faster depends vaccine supply keeping up. failures AZ ? 20% even 30% shortfall could considered reasonable. 60% 75% shortfall (depending whose numbers believe) reasonable, rather indication AZ plan enough capacity first place. Covid made lot businesses efficient. instance doctors visit. Prior covid would show Dr appointment time. would sign told seat whereby would read three year old copy People magazine start hating life. hour later they’d call see Dr. Dr appointment show agreed time , nurse takes vitals etc taken room three minutes later Dr sees me. Fantastic. weren’t always like this? 

Same goes child’s picture day. Prior covid showed time (for individual photos). waited. waited. waited. course dreadful. 

But year given time show up. showed scanned thingie phone child went straight photographer. whole
process took 15 minutes. two hours waiting around like jerk. 

Covid taught us lot things. least anti maskers wretched ghouls. let’s also forget efficient really want be. read dozens scientific papers transmission dynamics.

Of course, it’s also possible someone caught virus died perfectly reasonable activity fall 2019. don’t feel bad did, wasn’t fault Wouldn’t companies cut back vials then? US purchased doses, vials. like humble controversial opinion, people caught covid either A) didnt follow safe guidelines like masking, distancing, hygiene etc. basically fault preventable B) caught covid coworker belongs group, partially preventable, would good sealing respirator day long C) caught housemate belongs group.

I caught covid (fortunately mildly), either taking public transit work trip grocery store honestly I'm getting bit tired rhetoric. get impression comes place people wanting feel like control chances getting sick. There're 300 million people United States, even relatively low risk scenarios people going draw short straw. Sometimes shit happens worry moralizing something like catching virus going make hard eventually return level risk tolerance people mostly protected vaccination covid becomes endemic disease that's acute public health threat. Knowing delegate also good management. Yea kind makes sense. Ideally would everyone tested sake better statistics hand enough tests even everyone wanted one. Ha...infighting. Still better France we've done many total Best luck you!

It’ll months whole family there, low risk folks preteens among us. think that, around month, vaccinated folks go dinner movie. It’d healing. Thanks citation article provided 

“The vaccine manufactured two British firms - Oxford BioMedica Cobra Biologics - another company, Wockhardt, providing fill finish capability McCubbin said “a completely integrated UK supply chain”. Source? mean, that’s true, break lockdown rules? would plenty vaccine.

They wouldn't, got started late. Even **if** EU exported rumoured 4m vaccines UK, appear case, would still nowhere near requirements now. 4m vaccines fill 75m gap, especially turns 4m transfer may never happened.  I’ve disappointed Canada didn’t help making vaccine. didn’t even really help research, either.

It’s like red hen.  Unlike you, actually read source. gets filtered retransmitted press though. see scientific papers get twisted poorly reported time. Yes agree. zero=COVID people saying restrictions pretty much forever (since we'll never realistically eradicate covid) serious? say AZ *not* say would deliver 31M 80M ordered doses? EU media dreamed that? hilarious statement week! live, popular opinion masks unnecessary outdoors, even crowded events. mask wearing outdoors ""suggested enforced "". Meaning hardly anyone wears one.  First teachers volunteered duty got paid it.

Second I'm saying experience effective. went school average HOUSEHOLD income $17,000 per year, yet 95-100% four year college acceptance rate (depending year).

You can't fix students home life give opportunity escape it. That's school was. would today without school would kids graduated with. Doors opened 6 stayed open 7 pm. warm, quiet, safe, top internet/computers homework. breakfast lunch free every day. tight lunch ladies would give leftovers Friday would something eat weekend.

I think realizing devastating would suddenly vanish. I’ve heard multiple times every month since March. Yes plant one supplying EU also notice date article... issue vaccines production. That’s don’t help. fun propaganda. UK factories might shift production volumes continental EU though. Currently continental factories problems, means lower production volume. contract EU says, ship doses EU well UK based factories. decreasing delivery EU, without deceasing rest customers breach contract. EU seems plan stop exports vaccines, AS, well Biontech, contract plan again. might fuck britain especially hard, since strategy wait long possible second shot arriving supply. supply limited then, major trouble. I'm Texan laughed hard confused wife. Thanks laugh. Spanish flu 2-3 years it? correct, meant UK 3 month head-start. Depends where. husband taught 5 years California school finally enrolled credentialling program last year. Massive teaching shortage bare minimum qualifications means anyone teach. real requirements necessarily TB test legal things. good thing? No. good teachers pretty much anyone pulse get job teaching (we Oakland). said, lots ""subject matter experts"" taught school left realizing teaching 1% subject teaching 99% relationships students classroom management.  surgeries vaccination centers weekends normal work week? profile looks like you’re HK, say I’m glad I’m Australia right now.

You think media lying many people died? Prove fuck off.

You’re saying tourism aviation industries decimated? Yes, obviously, that’s global occurrence. Nothing society still going best can.

No idea you’re Fiji Bali, relevant. Australia provides $4bn per year foreign aid we’re fine.

I know you’re covid denier hope never host back country can’t spread lies disease. Well, I’m glad used app didn’t infect anyone. would personally super worried spreading virus country eliminated community spread causing lockdowns, though. I’m US opportunity travel someplace thing control wouldn’t take chances messing good thing lol reason vaccine producers tied production Countries, knew could happen.

Also helps UK signed everything got movement initial setup three months earlier. real proof it’s severe. numbers UK really small far come conclusion. scientific group admits confidence severe like 40-50 percent lots regional differences might explain  Also apparently reason sign joint PPE procurement contractual handcuffs EU tried put us around procurement, including vaccines. I'm Remainer reported Guardian. UK also made significant advance payment toward vaccines months anyone else, said. Lux Coelho something like rabbit light latin? Trump lots good ideas never intended follow with. AZ 'cause stir', EU did. Look everywhere, wont find single report AZ saying they'll delivery 60%, 40%, 25%, whatever random number media moved now.

And seem confused, issue fixed. improved, still work they're meeting expectations. expected, binary process, they'll get continual small improvements time. Sounds awful lot like Canada.  hoarding, 400million orders across 7 different vaccine candidates (as summer 2020) never guaranteed successful. ensured 50% candidates fail UK would still enough doses entire population also meant whichever vaccine approved first UK would able immediately crack on. 


Also 400million made once, AZ basically full production speed UK delivering around 2-3m doses week. concurrent vaccines available delivering similar weekly numbers quicker vaccinate whole country provide rest elsewhere (likely poorer commonwealth nations orders place) forego rest allocation diverted fulfill states orders.


It's number doses ordered quickly supply doses able reduce deaths level reopen economy Cases problem pandemic. vast majority going covid mild symptoms long term effects. need target groups risk first get quick response vaccination program. Vaccinating healthy working people first delay pandemic ultimately kill people. pessimistic /u/Pessimist2020 ? Yet UK production UK supply orders UK done. One things indisputable right current Government well investment procurement numerous vaccines. 

You rightfully complain woeful reaction pandemic first place hit miss messaging, specific part much better world. EU people practising nationalism protect floundering slow bureaucrats? 

""regardless EU doing"", also EU private company, literally represents constituents unlike contractually agree number first batches EU sure continue spouting rubbish.

Can elaborate this? nobody complaining Pfizer making profit also exporting vaccines Canada, Israel others. EU ask Israel doses?

There also seems lack criticism EU companies taken money delivered anything all. curious side effects, got vaccinated rabies summer kicked ass 3 separate times go that. Flu like symptoms, chills, joints aches, fever. sucked.

I got Pfizer first shot Friday night basically wouldn’t noticed anything arm sore. rabies shots way worse. Fuck trying force division vaccines middle pandemic. Scum. depends. Pittsburgh Ireland? Didn’t experts say holidays supposed hardest? know now. worth go back take look missed. not. live exurban corner mostly rural Texas county farther go city, fewer people wear masks. county many rural counties enforcing pandemic measures, strictly voluntary. Businesses individuals enforce property want they're required to, none enforced public property. way along. Ummm, UK 100% part Europe, mean EU? Lame Every months...

'The next months could hardest'

This pandemic hard since beginning amount stupidity exists internationally continues hard fuck. Where's source data? Superbowl would like word you. México sub 10,000 day month now, yeah, we're fucked terms actual hospitalization fatality numbers honestly think going LOT better month, like falling rapidly.

Cases take longer far cases illnesses especially among young healthy yet vaccinated. cases without illnesses really problem.

When policy makers start make rational decisions lockdowns? mean hell knows. Hopefully tide turn start see economic mental health side problem little clearly. feel way too. I'm used casting 6-foot radius around walking street little bit fear shoots inside see someone approaching without mask. going take effort un-train reactions remind everything okay. that's pandemic harder: one caring scientific advisers anymore like expecting nowhere pandemic situation better. weeks TWiV especially nice palette cleanser. still aren’t convinced UK variant particular much transmissible. Might little fitness, write cultural things. Remember UK pubs open like mid December. spread virus like crazy  Also worth noting percentage elderly white drastically higher percentage young people are. I'm disbelief. think POWs commit...crimes?

You actually learn what's issue here. They're fucking carjackers lol really can't bothered thought amusing first seconds glanced second link there, claim shows absolutely one wearing mask, shows least two people wearing masks cuts Sergels torg. Objectively false. would like leave grandma always used say: can't say something nice, shut F up.  IFR low India average age low. 5% people age 65 India, compared 13% United States, 22% country like Italy. Given majority deaths older demographics, causes different cross-country IFRs depending age distribution. based alone, we'd expect IFR roughly 2-3X lower India US 4-5X lower Italy. course, factors (like quality healthcare) play well. 

The places citing highest infection rates (urban slums) also low average age rates, even compared rest already-young Indian demographic. 

That said, there's also huge undercounting COVID-related deaths India. India done decent job testing given limited resources, reality still developing country. done ~140K tests per million people, whereas US (not known great testing except select states like New York) done nearly 1 million per million people. US anyone COVID-like symptoms dies get tested gives us confidence death figures, always true India, especially areas extreme poverty.

It unreasonable believe 30% India infected. United States similar estimated infection rate point, US whole much less crowded hygienic significant parts India. Pfizer everything fulfill EU order soon possible. Q2 deliver millions doses EU every day. J&amp;J manage deliver somewhat promised, everyone offered vaccine summer, even AZ delivering less half original confirmed deliveries. Moderna delivering much atm trying increase production too. Always life death, ppverty wealth time massive funding, capable team ample time? Luck nothing it. So, new continent part of? Seems like it’s combo they’re citizen, want go, country take them.

Yes, countries want them. didnt know company would end developing vaccine first, ordered them. good thing, quick acting reason havent fucked whole thing like EU Taking ill Illinois!

Where read details? I'd love read US city getting back feet. 🍪 exactly hoping see. doses become available, things like J &amp; J hit scene, bottleneck moves onto delivery end things. Hoping hospitals CVS/Walgreens going carry load realistic want move volume need to.  would like see plan get mRNA manufacturing capacity west something like 1Billion doses per month, government financing need be. Maybe within year two would possible right support.  Lmao tOrTurE Lock up! EU enacted export restictions vaccines. UK not. Last days [~1.2 That's fact everyone waiting vaccines lmao.   used respect Fauci. contradicts much, soon. Israel, would like if... wait minute EU exporting vaccine even though going hot (so far nothing blocked). EU would well think would changed. vaccine sold cost developing world perpetuity.

If anyone forced pay profit margin included, wealthy countries. yelling going managed fix issues plant Belgium. AstraZeneca vaccines UK *were* made EU.

The Halix plant Leiden, Netherlands. drug-substance Yes, would breach contract.

I'm pinning AZ unacceptable say short notice deliver - basically stripped EU margin look suppliers, approve vaccines, EU withdraw investment towards vaccine facilities.

It's extremely shady accept funding, compromise time investment EMA approval, 8 weeks delivery figured deliver 30 million vaccines 80-100 million.

If difference shock notified short notice, know say. 1, 2, 10 30 million... 70 million vaccines, 100 million order, delivered 8 week notice.

They noticed last week? Absolutely, Mrs papping she’ll bring home work. admit nice bottle wine Friday night celebrate getting jab Sat! big worry shoulders too. Keep safe.
Ironically we’re pretty confident Mrs last summer (as suggested GP) tested back then. effects perhaps I’m lucky!  🙄 Brisbane went lockdown went grocery store Saturday normal, fully stocked. surprised honest. [85% COVID patients reported often always wearing masks according  numbers horrible.
UK probably vaccinated people last 48 hours Canada last 2 months. Well know much policies

Yeah, maybe comment actually know COVID policies florida california.

Why would states allow travel without much restrictions? one reasons Finland better EU countries impose restriction air travel within board, many examples places strict lockdowns high excess mortality (Peru, Italy, Belgium, UK)

Peru impoverished country socioeconomic factors affect efficacy lockdowns.

Italy's two lockdowns jobs suppressing outbreak. obviously require maintenance via things like mask mandates strict enforcement social distancing guidelines.

UK took long impose lockdown, what's argument looked Sweden's latest numbers compared immediate neighbours?

You seem miss point lockdown though. *decisive* lockdown meant address outbreak that's surging. surge dealt with, goal re-open gradually maintaining aforementioned measures along contact tracing isolation/quarantines. Whoever said lockdown needed year? that's case, failure top down. would certainly blame previous administration - inability coordinate state lockdowns see reduced efficacy increased duration link literally shows high numbers excess mortality somehow conclude COVID deaths overcounted, link actual peer-reviewed study views rational thinking, looking actual benefit doing, versus enormous cost.

What's enormous cost facing countries like China Australia again? New Zealand? Finland? Singapore? try stop spread couple months fine, going anywhere.

Nope, managed hospitals frontline workers get overwhelmed. numbers reduced via measures contact tracing effective clusters detected early contained.

The effective way far decisive *federally co-ordinated* lockdown. happen drug overdose, domestic abuse, diagnosed cancers, child abuse, depression, loneliness skyrocketed pandemic.

Funny, see happening countries stricter lockdowns US? almost though necessary stimulus tide people lockdown know people getting cancer treatment this.

People get access treatments hospitals overwhelmed too. also loved ones seriously comprised measures. difference control virus, control measures though.

The failed measures Trump =/= properly implemented lockdown ineffective. mask mandates enforced social distancing guidelines ensure businesses opened safely =/= lockdowns working.

You seem shift failures poor leadership towards lockdowns. actually support Sweden's measures? Funny, share many similarities lockdowns. guess fine called one, people still visiting family friends.

Finland lockdown 2 months Feb April 2020. they've actually looser restrictions Sweden. goes New Zealand. goes many countries strict lockdowns. Meanwhile, unlike countries, Sweden impose much stricter measures last November.

The result? Stricter measures couple months exchange economy recovers quickly, exchange returning normalcy sooner exchange far fewer cases/deaths. think obvious choice I'll account well society whole.

Tell high number COVID deaths Sweden start. tell elderly care homes effectively forced lockdown via isolation September 2020. That's 'a whole' positing.

People come back death even long term sequelae. someone who's young, absolutely deal quick lockdown without issue. That's part whole picture seem ignoring.  That’s amazing. gotta hand them, they’ve put foot gas. wish US would force pharmaceutical companies make vaccine. pointless injecting people less effective vaccines Pfizer Moderna available. NHS amazing.

Also whole process production filling vials UK quite straightforward.  im shredded bro Strain mean variant. SARS-CoV-2 many variants getting several variants disease nothing new. 

The immune response body resist variants since variants virus N-protein structure recognized immune system. 

Even people got infected SARS 2002 sort immunity new virus.

Fact check. I'm sorry bro, want close people flown.... knowledge origin story? Right, tailgates outside. gone UK exports forbidden UK offering help? graphs scary af. can't seem win losing.

As every model I've looked at, one reinforces likelihood preventative measures like masks social distancing save lot lives vaccines next three months. best way know someone legal case:

Do fight court law, court public opinion press briefings. latter, know case. EU chose latter. lawyers give thumbs down, backed gone silent called reset. Gamble went 3 - 4 weeks first place shortest time frame could trial get potential results.

The vaccines maker suggest 12 weeks make worse potentially better. 

In mean time logically makes sense entire population get first dose soon possible gives boon done. remaining symptoms voice little human airlines pretty spotty safety measures now. Delta best i've heard course would trade 1 year life save hundreds thousands people. That's what's asked for.

What's asked _billions_ people _all_ trade 1 year life save hundred thousand people, totally different calculation. data spreads quickly never moved past ""could"" either. But, spreading faster also become ""fact"" people. know you, super bowl parties french kiss every touch down. Take doses? say EU wanted take doses? safe so? correct sir. think EU bigger leaver there. exports vaccines anymore whole europe vaccinated couple months. would leave scorched soil, one party tries breach contract soil already burning. bit creepy lol Apparently people think Súper Bowl drive cases up. like commercials play between. sounds amazing, thanks service mate! Super Bowl severely reduced capacity countless games throughout football season measures.

As parties, Super Bowl parties small gatherings all-out ragers. average Saturday fall almost certainly many tailgates.  It’s fine task force need multiple points view needs stay media. seems like he’s using extreme versions views get spotlight career. It’s working country Belgian far right used image Auschwitz campaign public health measures vaccinations.

Wow, think go lower... whole thread praising UK. mishandled pandemic criminal degree reason we've got high rate vaccination backing another deal.

People saying 'victory Brexit' missing fact underhanded tactics like we're getting shitty end trade deal. like? feel emotional this? 70s always exceptional health. Call came local GP surgery. Could worth mum contacting local one ask put shortlist cancellations leftovers? airline know still blocking middle seats Delta. Fuck off, direct hate somewhere actually justified piece shit. United Kingdom nothing badly EU fucked up. 2 100. rest single face mask.

It amazing swedes continuously twist argument. videos speak know many watch them. even trying divert attention people notice eventually. Emotional investment points people, certainly never you, right? it’s bs you’re rightly downvoted. EU made contract visible read doses stolen. also remember 20% adults get it. reason UK well positioned right funded many trails vaccine Companies. better order 1 Billion doses chance 100m viable. bad thing companies funded produce it.

If UK end stock it'll go Countries, ain't one hoarding Pandemic. *Could be.*

They also could be. Little secret, Reddit works backwards.  took international 12-hour flight social distancing all. flight attendant occasionally reminding fix mask. pretty much everyone considered vulnerable vaccinated, ? Likewise... stay strong. AZ less honest media.

In fact, original orders EU vaccine alliance 4 countries months earlier later continued EU27. referring UK deluded. Things going back normal people vaccinated. changed society permanently, may get back new normal next year two, certainly next 3 months. It’s funny, way headline, clarified isn’t something guaranteed happen, possibility don’t get ahead issue mass vaccination measures. currently project vaccines working right

Probably - peak cases first week year, meaningful amount vaccines distributed.

IMO (not expert though), dropping seasonality. common human coronaviruses (i.e., ones cause colds) peak winter early spring, seems Covid thing.

This good news, give us ample time vaccinate people spring summer, hopefully avoid another major wave fall. source saying summer? need balance bad news.  shouting at?! agree. need service corps primary care doctors, nurses, allied health personnel, mental health professionals, social workers, educators, logistics personnel, etc serve full time. Recruit free college/grad school tuition exchange 5 6 years service. stationed underserved low income communities normal times activated moment's notice deal shortages emergencies. Show country world tourism aviation industries well. That’s Australia issue, that’s world issue Would great found drugs fixed damaged lungs infection. would like get running still get breath climbing stairs 9 months later. Yes. Plus might fit little bit, transmission 30 history reactions previous vaccines. 
15 not. you, certainly.

But never intention trying interpret honestly. Please could quote bit think shows manufactured vaccines shipped UK? read twice see it. Way throw OR/ID/CA bus. KKK jokes now? Leave drugs kid. lets face it, entire fucking pandemic ""the hardest"" Alongside meat pies, confusing flags, genocide. got rather good those. see relevance comment. Parent comment replying concerned guards bringing covid back US. vaccine stop transmission, guard travel Cuba US going make bit difference. Oh, ok. Norway still really close EU. basically join parts want in. Understanding hand, proven bigger challenge. FYI replied agreeing removed quoted opposition argument contained language triggered automod. yeah, don’t get hoarding arguments since developing countries younger populations less risk anyway. Thank clarification good wishes, friend. plus side idiots (like Covid-19 deniers people think they'll survive anyway care get - remember ""Covid Parties"" thing?) able breed that's GOOD thing.

An overwhelming pity everyone else wears masks tries social distance keep safe, sometimes get infected idiots protect others right thing first place...

(Other people said WORSE.) B117 US since least early November (see latest paper that). much infectious wouldn’t starting see compete variants now? massive surges month two ago, 50 million traveled Thanksgiving, etc. Yet California it’s estimated late January 0.4 cases B117. that’s right surge Southern California. Somethings adding England don’t buy don’t get everyone pushing narrative. success operation include administration handle logistics, encourage communication, culture intent.

You buy car, driver one responsible fast well operates. news you, vaccines end working, almost normal people conclude ""well, guess can't beat thing"" start living life normally again, albeit slightly reduced average life expectancy.

You welcome stay home forever want to. absolutely done. 

In conceivable way would Northern Ireland, lots vaccines, take doses Ireland, few? 

Surely based argument, uk would want impose border checks ensure stock leak uk? won’t know fragile peace agreement is, sure, EU disregard say “oops never mind, don’t overreact lol”. Yeah right, literally First name Latin (Lucas Lux) last name Coelho (rabbit english). first person note Lux. 

And funny i'm downvoted saying people going commom sense instead science logic expect next months pandemic, lux Latin also refers Enlightment (reason). fucking research. numbers I've come real quick:

Population UK 18: 52.45 million

Doses required: 104.9 million

Minus 9 million first doses 0.5 million second doses: 95.4 million doses required.

At 600,000 doses day: 159 days vaccinate everyone.

That takes us 8th July. That's whole kerfuffle over. may mark words. Yep model dicey. People can't trusted self isolate, better nothing comprehensive enough IMO. world always expects United States come rescue. Exactly. us living places high risk and/or care pandemic community health need find ways get vaccines. Fortunately Britain, contract EU Astrazenica say anything sort. Certainly kind unambiguous way take lawyers months establish. Silly fools errand prevented hundreds people dying. 

Obviously cannot permanently eradicated, we’re - limiting transmission it’s discovered - *is* beating virus. I’m really proud way Australia handled it. decided would best rely EU

Its really surprising badly EU dropped ball. remember last year people thought UK would drop ball ended smart call go alone. pro side: able see one Impfzentren inside today. Everything well organized working like machine. surprised exhausting piecework vaccinations would be. want assure thousands us working ass make sure get vaccine too. soon possible. capacity. Impfzentrum worked today half capacity 1700 doses today.  reddit pulls usual fucking stunt downvoting maybe research. contractually obliged supply EU aren't. 
We fucked EU anyone says different moron. talk humanity yet US 440000 deaths.... Let’s see — hurricane metaphor, “worrying forecast”, “grim milestone”, within first two paragraphs, mention recognition “*may* deadlier” qualifier deep article...

Certainly seems like fine, even-keeled, serious piece journalism me. sister nurse primary care practice. White colleagues gladly accepted vaccine. Black Hispanic colleagues turned vaccine. people wear PPE day every day personally know patients died COVID-19. Imagine people don’t work healthcare do. took slower precise approach sake vulnerable.

We also did? Can't admit jimmie crankie fucking up? Uk medical experts vs everyone know? I’ll take experts, thanks. Let's distribute goods equally bad everyone.  America ever used vaccines produced Europe?

Yes, US got Biontech/Pfizer vaccines deliveries plant Belgium.

Exactly. don’t kids high school student know it’s like stuck remote learning months. Many people sub childless people privilege never take whole grade school online.   received second dose, checklist eligible. show card marked name list. concern legitimate - FUD (there data indicates long term effects theoretical reason believe vaccine would long term effects) belief JnJ ""give production capacity another company's effective vaccine"" shows absolute ignorance vaccine types. 

JnJ's vaccine adenovirus-based, different Novavax's protein subunit vaccine, different mRNA vaccines Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna. use fundamentally different production processes means interchangeable. Excluding widely available chemical precursors, major supply chain overlap across three families starts glass vials used store end vaccine. 

Anyone realize probably debate manufacture vaccines relative safety said vaccines.

You people obviously suffer high degree anxiety since writing this. Relax, fine. corona kill you, won’t 50. get sick recover back 100%. 

Chill out. Stop spreading fear. Lift lockdown, cure lot depression bunch people lost taste smell. Thankfully new Biontech plant Marburg (Germany) running. take P3 trials get approval get production widespread levels, would expect Novavax arrive UK couple months Curevac UK. 

According Oxford scientists takes 3 months get production good level, may apply Curevac Nope... covid wards hospitals empty. Covid care centres shut due lack patients. dead bodies street (or backyards). 

I’m denying there’s undercount deaths. it’s extent missed million deaths. Also sero surveys India peg IFR 0.07% 0.11% depending demographics. Facts least could throw us bone student debt forgiveness that's never gonna happen Imo connection eating exotic animals illegal wet markets. Lol good luck old farts try make social distance past spring opening lot vaccination centres. Got around 10 super centres things like football (soccer) stadiums. Also vaccinating 70+ group drive get around easier 80+ group lot also reside care homes. things easier quicker. pray right wanna travel lol basically election strategy. Roll vaccines right election look good. bad many things. give us moment.

It’s stereotype 100% true. 

We also know let old people front queues already, virtual queue (when stand platform remember got first), know say ‘thanks you’. (Our queueing weakness creates standoff).

People abuse queue system publicly shamed, much would dare. (I proud shaming millionaires USA, idea ‘oh well, that’ accepting.)

We designed this. gave Soldiers flu shots medic. could civilians. pull 68W 2 every BN. good thing......sweet I’m jumping back American pride train....choo-choo Germany problem   [They slow spread 1.1m first doses. hold pace first doses we're extremely good place article literally prioritization. in, rich young athletes getting vaccines grandma assisted living home. Emergency use authorization approval completely back normal 2022 country bigger problems missing festivals, bigger economic downturn great depression massive civil unrest. know what's UK contract exactly, fixed number doses.

Well public knows EU contract, release hiding behind it. Unlike UK claims ""security UK government put together coalition organisations manufacture AZ vaccine. vaccine would exist without large amount funding organisational help.

Just like BioNTech received funding EU, vaccine kicked USA, UK Isreal exist either - imagine EU claiming European supply UK get preferential contract EU, given amount effort, fact EU signed 3 months later UK, leaving little time manufacturing development? Also note vaccine sold cost, freely given others want manufacture (like India EU).

Well seems problem AZ that's signing contracts can't fulfilled, ain't it? Missing 70 million doses 100 million, 2 month notice? kidding me? 70 million doses enough immunize 90% German population, ""ups manage make 1 million doses :("".

It AZ said would sell cost, EU claimed that. EU buying BioNTech vaccines margin top cost, like every country.

It AZ said production capacity deliver 100 million doses March last week.

The EU demand vaccines would produced specific places, neither contract would compromise agreement - check contract pretty clear.

If time fulfill orders, maybe taken contract, right? Basically breached contract, compromised vaccination programme could invested vaccines like BioNTech even get approval China Russia vaccine instead wasting time AZ trial. fight since 6th grade, would hesitate throat punch one assholes jeopardized opportunity family member get vaccinated. Apologies, that’s fault misreading data!

I would assume getting second dose mainly healthcare workers - small percentage people don’t turn first doses instead wasting vaccines, they’re jabbed nearest bodies! Better chucking away. tested positive end December. could taste whole time lost sense smell actually started recover, still hasn’t come back. smell things times it’s weird... it’s like catch smell I’m paying attention. Like I’ll walk room say “Oh smells good here!” I’ll try figure smells like can’t. pick something sniff usually get nothing. Like spring breeze nothing. Even potent things like minced garlic. It’s weird. 

It’s cool way I’ve MUCH easier time keeping cats’ litter boxes clean (not nearly unpleasant around now) I’m also paranoid house stink won’t know it. Also there’s fact it’s neurological damage don’t know I’ll really ever recover that’s fun. real reason right wing govt wants roll right election look good. said doesn’t make sense. supposed wait observed 30 minutes get it? stores vaccinating. several stores district depot stores sending people vaccinate. nursing home, vaccinate anywhere 150-200 people day, numerous clinics run per day. time, running pharmacy short staffed high volume scripts techs pharmacists going vaccinate. also get compensated well jobs higher ups receive profits work. would say best despite circumstances. Thanks criticism though!! fair, current wave probably vaccinations greater effect spread countries. Vaccines prevent future waves.

It's fire retardant paint paint house rebuilt. people expect life get back normal? Like everything open virus gone? summer? media “experts” saying that? vaccine widely available everyone then. thanks. hospitalizations sites get fewer clicks. mean, hotel quarantine guard, would presume right thing caught contagious disease. 

We've seen things like enough times point feel like we're comfortable quick lockdown/ back normal life thing. 

I'm optimistic manage till everyone gets vaccinated. like 20 minutes, it’s rocket science. yet zoomers millennials first ones shame people complying makes sound woke CDC updated. 31.1m doses administered I'm optimistic people vaccinated others become comfortable getting vaccinated themselves. 
At first clinic roughly 238 250 people signed vaccinated. 12 declined, eight cited distrust vaccine reason (the 4 medical). scheduled second clinic one changed minds decided get vaccine. 
I think big part getting distrustful people vaccinated seeing people lives get fine. Fist pump. EU should, probably themselves, behalf billions people parts world lagging behind vaccination. Many countries world even sniffing vaccines. want new mutation fuck us... newest research shows closing schools second effective way decrease R value virus. Second largest. Period that's anyway needs know intelligent enough appreciate use it

Maybe tone racism bit. Yeah, two free saliva test sights within 40 miles me. Even home saliva tests easy operate. helpful. Netanyahu election coming trying make israel first country crush covid boost chances. time, relies orthodox community win. problem give fuck regulations screwing efforts. clamps them, could lose support. Hilarious predicament excess deaths? Try TWiV podcast Daniel Griffin. He’s good clinical updates. forget lost use legs due polio virus totally got walk later! 

(/s, case necessary) No. downvote disagree me. already said sceptic compare deaths 2020/21 5-year rolling average using ONS data. excess deaths would happened due obesity alone: coronavirus caused example obese likely die healthy weight.

No amount denial change excess deaths number compared 5 year rolling average. Coronavirus causing it. Yeah it’s deadly care “forever”. don’t hurry really gonna care anymore. I’m high risk catching anyways it’s really problem. yet, hopefully week submit application. think Australia imports? Digusting. think might oversimplifying it. 

The military inefficient many ways logistical powerhouse. go bar restaurant? people want go, they're open, that's choice. true, unless living underground bunker. 

If uncontrolled spread anywhere, mutations continue mount. RNA viruses like mutate rapidly. every mutation risk dangerous one. Perhaps even one current vaccines reduced zero effectiveness against, would world hurt. 

So even vaccinated, uncontrolled spread anywhere highly interconnected planet, risk you. There's case make it. benefit. goal prevent deaths, elderly make largest fraction deaths, they're much smaller fraction population young people. Vaccinate first. Third world countries shitload diseases. make ""pandemic""... believe full title Sir Tom Moore (Captain, RAC Rtd). European countries retired military officers referred rank retired (ex.

AZ vaccine cannot given elderly buggin dude. definitely sounds like want cooped forever. restrictions within calendar year Welcome month 11 2 weeks flatten curve. See March 15 1 year anniversary 2 weeks flatten curve. groups like tpn, folklife, nwe, boldhat,

wat looks possible, good luck!  love god US hasn’t even finished vaccinating population. aren’t hoarding shit. get everyone wants shot done stockpile sitting whine hoarding.  What’s going reaction four cares mask mandates finished??? Meanwhile germany sitting like 70.000 per WEEK.

God envy brits left EU last possible moment. stuck total incompetence likes Von der Leyen bad everything did, promoted offices less harm. AZ/Oxford vaccine made world happy share data country facilities. Serum Institute going take care bulk work. Jansen going use Aspen South Africa manufacturing Africa.

The mRNA vaccines manufacturing headache vaccines pipeline could licensed anyone. 

COVAX say track deliver 1.3 billion doses year 100 million (maybe more) Q1. 

The situation isn’t perfect also isn’t bad article makes out. posted similar thought yesterday’s daily discussion thread — fixating percentage people vaccinated, rather *results* vaccinations, ultimately lead gotten vaccinated held hostage haven’t.

Vaccines means end, *end* (dropping cases/hospitalizations/deaths sustainable point don’t cause strain health care systems) matters. percentage people vaccinated *only* matter tool reach end, *never* considered vacuum, used threat say “if 80% don’t get vaccines, you’re never getting life back”.

So, course, got hostile reply comment yesterday, someone saying “calling bullshit” me. Ah, Reddit — gotta love it. Brussels' response system wield purchasing power 37 countries — EU27 10 neighbors — buy masks ventilators. ... program yet deliver single item.

Wow... Yes, 4th August Seems like EU didn’t help. mean crayon leftovers. Must relief! know fuck talking about. US export ban US made vaccines Canada receiving EU made vaccines going talk Canada hoarding. pretend US hoarding ridiculous. openly ""take strain"" non US manufacturing. Ludicrous propaganda.  way people treating vaccine basically nothing insane. 99.99% effectiveness 7 days 2nd dose, people still act like behavior change all. ""we know vaccine prevents transmission"" talking point moronic parroted University lapdogs here. 

Vaccines prevent transmission, didn't, herd immunity exist. way run RCT transmission can't intentionally infect people. People vaccine free live normally.

I've taken seriously since start pandemic, fuck this. vaccine end. start treating like that.  hand crayons get shot. chance. it’s Vox. pay lip service causes comes actual sacrifice, that’s far. hope realize error ways choose better. keep seeing numbers area SLOW big city hard imagine ever get there! hope get shot summer. least 1st one lol. birthday is? situation Americans give fuck happens get relief $$. 

The vast majority Americans don’t know budget reconciliation don’t care.

In fact, matter what, republicans bill doesn’t include checks democrats get checks, republicans look worse. 

Desperate people want relief far want unity. areas lot people skew population density numbers yes Israel much smaller sure. Also people live really rural areas going easier time social distancing. UK vaccination program probably thing government done well pandemic. numbers continue way going, 15 million people top four vulnerable groups vaccinated week schedule. sensing fading limelight. man. too.  EU commission really slow secure contracts doses. result, didn’t ramp production faster. Meanwhile Germany 15 million January-March That’s follow guidelines clinical trials instead making shit delaying second shot 6 months. Yup. Canada. US told us fuck though. Nice best buddies eh? degree. I’m 37 relatively good health. covid March. Take dose bunch 40 healthy, give us “normal” go vaccinate Sri Lanka. argument here.

However you’re saying normal mythical percentage vaccinated sorry, gotta take care home first. think that's misconception. still pro-life advocate people freedom make choices. lot pro-lifers concerned with, however, choices threaten lives others. EU thank that. Let guess. Two weeks? Probably vaccines yet, least really. look Israel, they're experiencing drop similar despite way population vaccinated. avoid 2009 ACA trap Rs wasted year pretending negotiate Obama admitted even acceded demands, still vote yes.

Have make compromise demands publicly can't backtrack, get something passed quickly without them. don’t know long vaccinations protect virus. Samens likely virus become common virus strain foreseeable future vaccination regular occurrence. True deaths 40 statistically rare COVID. bigger threat young people would burden hospitals comes elderly people getting COVID. 

This also seems like odd time finally bring QALY argument. point elderly disproportionately affected COVID anti-lockdown argument, get called grandma murderer. valid argument vaccinating people? even three percent, it? FYI US export ban us made covid vaccines fact hoarding. Canada getting EU made vaccines. Bloomberg’s tracker last updated yesterday. 1.35 million per day rolling average last week. EU breached contract published unredacted version. contract contradicts several places. 

Be pissed AZ promising delivering. pissed EU screwing up, don’t say uk stealing doses. Yes, phone auto correct. Oops. 

Thanks though. XD [Covid-19: Pfizer vaccine efficacy 52% first dose 95% second dose, paper shows | Nope. We’re bad rest EU. New York far population dense Israel. applies big East coast cities. primarily?

but ALSO scripted vax 2-3-4 MONTH intervals.

**all babies**

that immunity anything.

Table 1. Recommended Child Adolescent Immunization Schedule ages 18 years younger, United States, I'd like see scientific/medical explanation infants (with ZERO protection) hang large gaps boosters adults cannot.

&amp;#x200B;

i fully appreciate desire stick way trials conducted.. lack baby vax vs adult vax explanation bugs me.

is scientific reason (besides trials) says can't like polio?

### Poliovirus vaccination (minimum age: 6 weeks)

#### Routine vaccination

* 4-dose series ages 2, 4, 6–18 months, 4–6 years; administer final dose age 4 years least 6 months previous dose.
* 4 doses IPV administered age 4 years combination vaccine containing IPV used. However, dose still recommended age 4 years ***at least 6 months previous dose.*** good biological warfare?? Cause war we’re definitely losing.  federal government legal ability implement end state border closures lockdowns.
Next. I'm arguing ideal, impossible. Someone said Australians can't leave re-enter. That's true.

I think might thinking NZ case. one hoarding anything.

It stuck people's arms fast manufactured.

It may surprise learn West actually manufacturing powerhouse days. Peace Corps suspended operations due pandemic. They're clearly set tackle one. I'm scientist anything, guy reads lot, whole ""it's looking increase strength time"" thing sounds like b.s. spouted attention. Virus particles sentient choose mutate. Mutations essentially random; mutations increase propagation stick, mutations decrease propagation die out. we're lucky, mutations tend make virus less lethal.

All said, *was* engineered make lethal, would fascinated mechanism behind that. keep going like. crazy conversations random people. miss socialising. idea would require multiple scientists ignore ethics training, coordinate government officials, one blab it. Vaccine trials routinely conducted 'hot spots', scientists administering trials ethically bound encourage participants behave safely. Sometimes research timelines slow effects public health measures (one remdesivir trials China halted due successful infection control), solution pick another study site wait longer.

The political calculus changed vaccines reach. public going willing accept lockdown measures definite end sight following vaccine distribution. economic effects also predictable situation know vaccination would work all, thus really end date.  biontech plant marburg, germany (capacity 750 million doses / year) got license produce vaccines three days ago start producing february, first doses delivered end february/early march (production quality control take time ramp fully) US perspective, really feel like end pandemic sight. media longer circus government report on, clinging covid news scaring everyone long possibly else there? numbers, however, make certain we’re close end. I’m concerned people eager overestimate likelihood negative outcomes emotional reasons.

The data new variants slim lot repeated fact still uncertain wide error bars.

The way beat variants vaccinate quickly drive prevalence down. US, least, that. observed R 0.8 three weeks pressuring number quickly 10m vaccination doses per week growing. Europe slower vaccination pace also lower starting prevalence, also puts good spot. 

It’s possible come projections fail win race, involves taking lot worst end estimates various numbers stringing together. similar vaccination rate health system work at. There’s subset waiting traditional vaccines (eg AstraZeneca) come trust more. 50s Americans asked close businesses remain house arrest vaccinations done

Did children kill couldn’t go school? main vaccine using Pfizer one, get higher protection across population used AZ UK USA manufacturer them, we're talking AZ EU contract.

If AZ claims can't move production country produced allow it, effectively export block.

If claim refuse move honor contract country, fault EU contract due conflict contracts, that's major fuck knew terms contracts, EU know UK USA signed.

Basically that's stands, either vaccines blocked AZ breaching contract, open lawsuits. straightforward clear tier system set there's confusion somehow enough vaccination enough vaccines. Either people realize toxic social media drop droves nothing change current mass internet addiction phenomenon get worse companies try invade privacy people? Excuse me.  Nice personal attack. Always blame Jews. see is.

Biden said 100 million doses 100 days. Thats promise.  see. see difficult conversation people like you. someone else's nuts throat much instead conversation even counter argument shame people basis religion caste. sad truth reason people divided country. Keep living dream. One day though...one day. bubble burst. That's history taught us that's inevitable. Aren’t people said okay run BLM protesters blocked traffic? Asking friend.. I'd argue they're saying thing matter what. ""My body, choice, body, also choice"" going go 2022 perhaps even further, think close world Wuhan style get rid pandemic month so. Possibly repeat reinfections. stay inside month issue know world normal-ish again. US sequences 0.3% COVID cases now. simply don’t know widespread B117 becoming, likely won’t, numbers skyrocketing despite lockdowns clue us in. wonder LA’s situation due B117 (or another unknown variant) taking root. 

No way know without sequencing. trial data 3 weeks though, there’s much evidence backing 12 week theory got covid still weaker respiratory function even though go hospital wish fast EU Countries :( Directly Department Arsehole. surprise all. friend told getting shit people wearing mask, think close Panhandle time.

I able register vaccine, fingers crossed I'll get mine Spring. Oh wow realize get sick nonessential leisure activities. Mmmm love mind works! Mutation. Brazil African Varieties looking pleasant. longer give virus time mutate vaccinated, opportunities mutate something blow past current vaccine, require world make another vaccine get rid one more, comes it.

The African Brazil ones find disconcerting.

We need get vaccine process streamlined...Drive thru, possible. *Healthcare.gov entered chat.* gave anything. manufacterer behest UK EU investments.  EU gave 300M R&amp;D Oxford.

No, UK government direct say partnered terms. week shared vetoed American company actually UK government, followed US one, EU investment production capacity EU doses. vast majority research grants, even within EU itself, came member states. Germany, example, gave 500 million euros BioNTech. Outbreaks outbreaks, 2 million people locked back up. Easter? weren’t infuriatingly disgusting would hilarious. mean yeah, people fed this. One thing sure: Germany needs lot vaccine currently getting. current progress extremely slow, would take years immunize enough people (still something like 80k doses per day, 80 million people). dramatic. Irish government EU reason isn’t hard border Ireland British government (and voters) tried years. First leaders. Tu gandu hai agar namazi tujhe gaali nhi lagti aur bhakt lagti hai.

From outside UK count it. degree paranoia borders possible new variants even borders open could shut days notice Mild diseases kill millions. word choice rhetoric. super intense makes perfect headlines. Great. maybe everyone shut mother fuck it. Based know vaccine immune response, likely *suboptimal* get 3 weeks. want maximize efficacy still want follow manufacturer recommendation, get 28 days. 

The 21-28 window selected Pfizer (and multi-dose vaccine candidates) get trials quickly possible, believe getting 6 7 weeks later reduce efficacy boost. I've wondering well think anything formally said. annual flu vaccines get changed every year think redo trials reapply approval year. vaccines around years fully licensed. 

These vaccines still new fully licensed given emergency approval think may need redo trials. Pure speculation though. guy loves intense language. 

This enjoy Dr. Fauci. tell risks without resorting fucking Stephen King it. Yeah figure they'll help stuff like setting sites, moving boxes whatever, directing traffic, taking people's info, etc. Despite name BMA trade union agenda. sound like extreme outlier. hope return normal soon, full confidence should. million weekly vaccinations get everyone vaccinated September 30

Over 3 Million needed that.  Weird life basically normal summer Would reasonable assume Sinopharm, inactivated virus, kind efficacy towards new strains world, even though targeting specific virus strain? Sorry hear knew Osterholm headline. way pessimistic vast majority experts, somehow gets media attention. already done days ago bad America selfish. Canada got zero vaccines America waiting months, thanks Donald Duck banning exports. Whataboutisms going cut here. one suggesting UK get less ordered facilities.

The UK plant cannot produce enough vaccines maintain UK’s vaccination rollout *and* make EU’s shortfall. anyone saying AZ vaccines diverted EU *is*, fact, suggesting UK get less ordered (or get much slowly, considering current case numbers, would likely result preventable death thousands British touched long fulfil obligations EU.

If “they” mean BioNTech, fair enough - long UK given enough notice (and enough vaccines) ensure already received first dose receive second. Bhai tu chutiya hai, samjha? Bhakt means devotee Hinduism, calling someone bhakt insulting hindus believe god? No, context matters. would pull head ass look computer screen, see search bar top.

Seems like huge percentage chefs/cooks smoke cigarettes. Didn’t really seem consideration pre-COVID. investigation year late now. problem. incriminates communist party China. Trial data yes, laboratory data available support delayed vaccination approach. Individuals 2-3 month delay second dose high (in cases higher) antibody response get 4 weeks later. combined lack theoretical reason delayed dose would problem, clear gets without running another full scale trial. 

Keep mind, *all* multi-dose vaccine candidates selected 21-28 day window second dose. run trials quickly possible - longer windows mean time results. picked thought optimal window second dose - lowest window thought result significantly *reduced* boost effect. traditional vaccine trials would defaulted 2 months generally window second dose vaccines - based data dosing soon initial dose lowers boost efficacy. Wealthy countries (like US, UK, etc.) developed paid vaccines. right get access first. everyone countries wants vaccine gets it, help vaccination poorer countries. 

We need wait every country world vaccinated return normal. many diseases cause problems developing countries (like tuberculosis, malaria, ebola, etc.) effect day-to-day life developed countries.  talking about? J&amp;J Isn’t released yet. Also, might become 2 shot regimen. Either way, Covid vaccine, you’re completely protected serious disease you’re going spread disease others. don’t symptoms, virus doesn’t spread inside body much, VACCINES DO, chance spread essentially zero. Yes, course. Everyone seems forgotten air planes arriving Belgium media filming vaccines lol tested positive COVID never lost taste smell. Definitely unpredictable. I’m getting real tired “covid shaming.”

As in, judging groups people eating restaurant OUTSIDE. see time social media. Equating meeting friends family murder. It’s almost year, cut people slack. someone old risk ones taking extra precautions locking up, young healthy people point. . running meaningless competition inside head.

Good life hang Sweden. also curions downvoted guess common. Good luck life!

No. dont Danes, worked Copenhagen 3 years, also worked Helsinki Oslo, Reykjavik - love Nordics like nationalsång. sure angry. EU publish contract AstraZeneca too. odds getting go concert in-country vacation year seem get slimmer slimmer every day it’s giving low grade depression. can’t another year like 2020. can’t. likely mutations genome scientists tested it. single stranded positive RNA virus mutates rate 1 10,000 20,000 per replication. express many changes function virus. lethal, neutral, advantageous. mutations around entire time. media hypes it’s got story run vaccination program taken effect. capitalise fact people never knew variants use connotation word ‘mutant’ scare public thinking it’s bigger deal actually is. mean globally? Jeez could late 2022 later. Unfortunately going poorer countries really start mass vaccinations. Right seems developed countries like Europe, US, Canada etc vaccinated population. pandemic countries. HAHAHAHA gave chuckle! You’re right! spreading vaccine 0.5% country help?

In emergency make sure safe first, can't help others die. 1st world can't help 3rd go bankrupt several years lockdowns. top countries earmarked hundreds millions vaccines poorer nations, vaccines exist yet wont unless indsutries work less restriction. true! dad got 3 types pneumonia contributed death.

Don’t tell ever 1 viral vector vaccine (which tech AstraZeneca’s) approved public use before. exactly “traditional” vaccine technology.

Personally, I’d much rather take gamble new tech vaccine gamble Covid infection. tend relatively trusting science millions people already received vaccine though. Haha “I went school with...”

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sources say however, also clear bottling only. I’m tired guilt-tripped wanting simply exist outside home respected pharma companies, think scale US industry many magnitudes higher. wish simple, though. guess learn year moves along strains emerge. even 3 months False dichotomy  got honest.This south African strain scares me.This priest original strain November apparently offered protection. Well damn, managed lockdown entire 5 million strong population Melbourne worked! whole city sealed (they called ""ring steel"") exempted people allowed out. city we're talking about, *countless* roads leading sprawls farmland. also enough police enforce 5km travel limit people within city, enough police enforce restrictions guests home, businesses, 8pm 6am curfew amongst things.

My point European countries simply put hard yards, spent money, come creative solutions, made hard decisions restrictions properly suppress virus clearly shows. mean point here, stopping international travel prevent spread. might prevent spread variants UK south africa stopped travel countries already here. really seems like attempt distraction failure vaccine rollout. one happy covid happened. Wtf? Rushing Judgement never good idea. true. Nobody gives flying fuck original plan was. first doses UK manufactured Netherlands bottled Germany. UK vaccine task force even said much. understand get posting non-sense. So, New Zealand never ended lockdown case rates went down? That's lot pints. D: Dam Internet though guy here. EVERYONE RUN HES GOING TYPE 2V1 RAIN SNOW HILL BONNER🤣 Great news. hope end terrible time us all, especially take extra special care like Von Der Leyen seems gotten board telling companies service gonna approved within next weeks

Sooner that, it'll probably announced tomorrow. Health Canada already said ""days away"" last Friday. Pretty sure access alcohol people missing (I think lockdown forced anyone go dry), going pubs, clubs bars.  Give Navalny. guy went much almost getting killed wants achieve. Would also possibly annoy Putin ""that man"" nobel anyone else covid recovered still experience severe fatigue? days easier, still feel tired time. also recovered, long take feel least 70-80% again? I'm month positive test/first symptoms. think summer things start feeling ""normal"" lingering minor restrictions monitoring.

But spring shaping noticeably less restricted year. let's hope current trend continues. Actually have. one far proving bad - least NY region. least yet. Every excuse squeeze vaccinations implemented. dont time new strains emerging. one safe everyone safe really hope get phase 5 march/april!! Yeah, clearly upset towards EU. massive breach contract AZ, already making amendments - 9 million vaccines more, looks like finding vaccines somehow missing.

AZ better get shit straight. Hmmm want say vast majority people “happy covid happened”. funny tho... would say thing you. expect talk treat like crazy... Maybe receive doses week? Things picking tomorrow. Let's start doom gloom reason. increase Q1. Thing is, wasn’t really. We’re spending 30bn month furlough scheme, we’ve lost hundreds millions economic output.

Life back normal summer? fellow New Englanders, look like this: that's like driving Manchester, NH Hartford, CT vaccines Concord, Nashua, *the entire state Massachusetts,* Providence, RI. original plan British doses produced supply chain set Oxford university AstraZeneca UK. vaccine manufactured behalf two biotech companies, Oxford BioMedica Cobra Therapeutics, filled finished Wockhart Wrexham.

“There [UK manufacturing] challenges,” said Ian McCubbin, task force’s manufacturing lead, press briefing Monday. “That’s little delay delivery doses.”

AstraZeneca said using continental bottling facility initially booked capacity “which wanted use rather waste”, problems British sites.

The company vaccines task force said expected UK-made supplies start flowing smoothly early new year. Mr McCubbin said least 80 million 100 million doses Oxford/AstraZeneca ordered UK government would made Britain. Non sequitur. Par course subreddit. People would downvote, brigade, mods would ban talking wearing masks March last year. misinformation amplified subreddit 'always optimism' crowd actual anti-vaxxers lunatics.  perspective that? RNA viruses known mutate? I’m impressed “biologists virologists”. True meet target set summer, that's meant UK US said start first doses would local vulnerable population only, whilst EU said would allow exports (thus supply chains countries rely it). I, Cambridge University exam moderator? know. Clearly possible. Maybe he's good sitting exams? crazy, Estonia we've 37 thousand doses total. It’s unfortunate that’s response. thought good discussion. 

I guess can’t beat em data logic, name call! Seems go people online nowadays .... sure hope delaying second dose 12 weeks backfire faster rich connected countries get faster everyone else dose. might equitable thing end better making everyone.

This meme point. Let go.  matter many vaccines Covid. us much good sitting shelf used. fact significant portion Americans refusing vaccine. probably drive far normal grocery runs flu shots Yeah got shit gotta figure dude that’s gotta say lmfao even read reply? even read comment even make sense compared that.

You asked wrong EU block vaccines fine UK USA (not either really blocked exports, required prioritisation). reason lies made requirements allowed manufacturers set supply chains deliver vaccines countries rest world. 

In case UK required dedicated supply provided 100 million doses. Therefore AZ set factories UK this. EU signed contract (3 months later) started set another supply chain EU deliver doses. company Pfizer already supply chain EU (and EU made demands) reason set separate supply chain deliver doses countries UK. EU decided wanted similar prioritisation last summer Pfizer could investigated supply chains meet needs UK others. issue EU deciding wants mistakes giving countries manufacturers time work around demands.

Now onto point suddenly raised. read AZ/EU contract specifies requirement AZ's best efforts meet schedule. intended done using supply chain within EU (and funded EU) hit problems (in part due short time EU signing contract expecting deliveries) AZ still made best efforts meet contract. requirement use factories UK (funded UK government) UK received 100 million would violate AZ/UK contract would therefore far expected ""best efforts""

If want reply, please reply first 3 paragraphs. added last one address points raised, however, intention replying interpretation may well done courts future. original point would never replied. Yes. evidence detainees involved crime, charge prosecute them. understand find objectionable concept. Oh no, care people common human decency. self righteous /s Fun fact, Texas home 4 species venomous snakes found US! mean sure? Everything *should* keep going, snowstorms they...can't. know even like military/CIA/NSA snow days, right? go minimum manning dig out, like everyone else. would different?

Snow days random thing society gives children school funsies. bother all? mean I’d honestly kind of... bothered I’m social distancing country another country unvaccinated Ok Ms. ""I care disabled people"" go bad self Israeli herd immunity reached Palestinians also vaccinated, populations mingle much. Regardless politics, pointless persuing herd immunity via robust vaccination program without sorting Palestine out. hope enough go around uptake trust vaccine strong Palestinian lands. really need mods take hike. Obstructive round net negative. Stop interfering. make mistake that, also went back realized projection late spring mine summer. said ""goalpost shifting"" literally added extra month

So still idiot. initial reason drive thru vaccines see pic? Aw man lets hope trends. using political theater travel shutdowns despite international travel responsible small fraction cases. He's total fuck up. working Germany. It’s one textbook example you’re Haha funny wording indeed It’s 10 months  That’s half originally set amount 🤨 want believe convenient Lol dude given someone medical training...  US light years ahead compared Canada disclosed contracts. already knew would delay. word delivered beyond Q1? deliveries still going cut? Fear useful. 

It body’s way defending itself.

But useful threat. im actually laughing insane level self-righteousness you’ve convinced posess  pick soon vaccines delivered. might since US EU protective manufacturing currently. Ok Umm spoiler alert government done multiple times already.

Great see pace rolled though regardless targets ""woke"" word know? Dumbass Ok quote said simply didn’t say classic case moral virtue signaling Look mirror, buddy 15min observation got vaxxed. Contracts disclosed public. Meanwhile, United States, notorious government transparency, publically disclosed contracts. Sorry care people LMAO paid start, told time unlikely get then. panned get them, commission tried steal instead. vaccine designed foreign university, distributed profit foreign company. Honestly, suspect wished they'd never didn’t commit EU, way. It’s commitment Europe: it’s best effort, said going make best effort. reason said Europe time wanted supplied less time UK, even though contract signed three months later. said, „Ok, we’re going best, we’re going try, cannot commit contractually three months behind UK“. knew super stretch goal know it’s big issue, pandemic. contract contractual commitment. It’s best effort. Basically, said we’re going try best, can’t guarantee we’re going succeed. fact, getting there, little bit delayed.* still want shrug social distancing measures NOW. completely changed said Vaccine approval dependent certain percentage placebo group getting infected, cases vaccine sense Superman. basic common decency. Sorry never heard  said end spring literally pace herd immunity three months lmfao critically think second I’d say July 4th point 99% things back normal. see things slowly open then. 

Even probably 5-10k cases covid per day 2022. guess people want catch Covid done it. uni that? why? thought students last line intents purposes, know. right direct, tangible evidence particular case. would extraordinarily unusual Moderna Pfizer vaccines materially negatively impacted slightly extended shot window. middle pandemic, would prudent wait data there. we're normal times. 

Science requires evidence, value science ability make predictions. keep mind evidence inherently ambiguous itself. Depending field, evidence often considered ""confirmed"" 95% 99% confidence levels. 1 20 (or 99) times get luck. 

The science made blueprint vaccines within two days Sars-CoV-2 genome sequenced predicts longer window harm immune response. seek verify (and make claim trust), would absolutely unexpected alternative effect. read ‘first pimp’ heart filled patriotic pride. Britain first pimp. know...i remember Trump suggested using military. Everybody stuck noses air it. right. make lick sense spread COVID UK would slowed low vaccination rate US.  thing happened Ireland. quite well handling things, opened xmas. Within 2 weeks UK strain came ripped place like wildfire. went 100 8,000 daily cases month. guess due proximity first feel it, countries may experiencing surge now. know that? know every single covid case ever people turned out?

Shut Haha makes sense. Freaked missed news screwed.  clue tbh. I'm still wondering they've able get extra 9m doses from. Either they're diverting small amount doses plants there's better yielding Belgium plant expected. Also says they're expanding Belgium plant capacity. Depending long takes may mean could increase amount Q1 again. people around prefer Fauci's delivery. there's large segment population hear things wrapped fear. Better get info guy like Limbaugh. affect*, please define word ""vaccine"". None infected eating outdoors Scared second haha. Thought missed news. Yet somehow UK vaccine task force said come domestic supply chain. either provide citation, stop sharing false it’s couple days back normal life. Get stuff done around house, spend time family, binge Netflix, back normal. terms places police may aggressively break crowds, one them. vaccine drives essential Depends say you’ve allergic reactions before, particular conditions. wasn’t even asked medical record, actually, obviously history reactions would spoken up. wrote time could leave observation area windshield, 15 min 30 min people different lines. Harm reduction core tenet public health. it’s seemingly forgotten beyond me. pull splinter eye pull log somebody else’s. 

Although say lives back summer totally take dose give somebody else. problem.  monkey Pandemics “end” stop really impact people’s lives much quicker. technically declared much later. spreading vaccine 0.5% country help?

We target vulnerable death worldwide instead rich countries. deaths come subset demographics (notably, age). target people, drastically reduce mortality short period time. emergency make sure safe first, can't help others die. 1st world can't help 3rd go bankrupt several years lockdowns. top countries earmarked hundreds millions vaccines poorer nations, vaccines exist yet wont unless indsutries work less restriction.

What vaccine production slowed lockdowns? see open bars restaurants help Jonson Johnson ramp production International travel responsible every case Canada. like spontaneously appeared every country world. They're trying prevent things spiraling control again. everything back normal good? testing etc... don’t pandemics normally last longer 1 year virus completely gone? can't wait. doctor said I'd probably waiting fall. seems like you’re taking personal criticism absolutely isn’t meant way. meant criticism towards entire approach. focused efforts beefing staff stores could use vaccinate instead few. always dislike profit shared America doesn’t often go job think that’s travesty. 

Keep good work, appreciate it. you?? sleep plenty considering I'm fuck all. much travel bubbles? Yh shady company thst selling vaccine cost duration pandemic whilst vaccines sold profit. yh let's go AZ ARREST virus completely gone summer? thought pandemics normally last 4 years? UK developed vaccine licensed (at cost) world. 

In hindsight, given rest world thinks we're pure evil case, made much profit could. US 1.3 million per day. Amazon massive help UK Covid testing program, helping deliver testing kits quickly. Im sure help areas called upon. think it’ll go next weeks? Right? refreshing thrown like Also live LA. moderate climates don’t reach anything even close northeast, Midwest etc much closer anything else ok dude? Maybe sleep little? Taking one dose wouldn’t big deal considering making millions doses. people forum don’t understand “happy free” summer absolutely nothing virus everything government restrictions.

I suspect regardless vaccine efficacy, people tired mindlessly complying summertime, people living freely matter what. worry I'm weak minded perseverance mental fortitude takes part solution I'll know one narcissists set aside wants helped perpetuate spread causing mutations deaths, I'm perfectly fine that. 

Just look history see suffering ppl endure world wars great depression comforts could ask everything fingertips delivered doors set aside wants couple years protect lives ppl suffered far worse relaxing home give comfy want filled life can't handle that..pathetic. Well June everyone endorsed massive protests yeah I'd say June everyone gave up. big gamble thankfully paid Germany's done bang job Thanks, find anything national lockdown, must missed coordinated local ones. also increases risk escape mutations. works, supply least stable, since definately go 6 weeks first second dosis. Therefore strategy lot riskier. benefits might outweight risk, like go-to solution. Especially now, hear production problems Biontech AstraZeneca weekly basis. Doubt worst holiday season. Bit rich coming haha. pro-EU agendas allowed here. mean Oxford/AZ vaccine UK invested setting domestic production lines early? ones surplus going given away poorer nations?

The vaccine produced cost multiple countries around world? given poorer countries.

The UK donated $700m COVAX billions GAVI?

Yep vaccine nationalisation right Oxford J&amp;J approved Canada end February. Canada receiving doses Q1 rush.

Honest question something trying find Novavax approved. think phase 3 clinical trial UK little small (15K) relative others (Moderna/Pfizer 40K participants)?

Do think Canada wait phase 3 clinical trial Mexico/US (30K) approving? even gotten documents Novavax. According long know phase 3 trials take Novavax US/Mexico trial end April approved May. expecting unless know something new (and please tell do).

Canada said expects 20M doses Q2 Pfizer Moderna. vaccines approved (Oxford/J&amp;J/Novavax) expect additional 20M doses them. timetables guarantees stated far know. contract states orders come specific place, 

Actually, EU/AstraZeneca contract specifically mentions 4 production sites, 2 EU 2 UK, vaccines supplied. went go pick KFC lunch, getting food, noticed booth full old ladies hanging there

Imagine risking life go eat inside KFC lol Wait vaccinated? turning something left v. right really political way. 

You're correct, West Virginia turned Walgreens/CVS deal, large, national retailers many locations WV like states. difference state government WV working network smaller chains independent pharmacies rather two big boys. absolutely nothing public-private v. state run vaccinations. Ah yeah EU shafted purchasing vaccines months places like UK US, places ordered time like UK Israel much better logic? illiterate? specifically stated offering opinion, merely presenting what_was_possible. POSSIBLE avoid scenario presented vaccinating guards. Full stop. FACT nothing personally FEEL it. Fucking duh, dude. able drive much motivated face higher risk infection place low mask wearing. make sense countries develop vaccines funds first ensure population taken care first? can't help others first help yourself."
