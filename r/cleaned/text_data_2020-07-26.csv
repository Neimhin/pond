It's almost like small segment society wants convenience modern science, technology, medicine things get tough. sudden grand worldwide CoNsPiRaCy theory secretly want go run luddites something. would ask people Rochester NYC area? White Plains downstate. trolling what? That's normal. Reports always slow weekend. Similar drops reported last Sunday, Sunday that, on. 

They'll ramp slightly Monday, back normal Tuesday. That's usually goes. reason two doses measles waning immunity, catching percentage seroconvert first time. outdoors though? Corona transmit outdoor setting. matter what' they're pushing. matters people take away.

Viral load much virus start with. much virus tested. ""get"" small viral load, terminology confusing. return, self-quarantine two weeks arrival.

That's problem. difficult people jobs self-quarantine two weeks. There's sick-pay insurance pandemic.

Also, job months, employer sack moment's notice impunity, likely happen.

It's people selfish went Spain, government gave warning. People mistake easy access information intelligence, knowledge wisdom. link awesome - corona Feb - anyone link going back 2 months current? conspiracy theory monger - it’s super interesting. Bingo. Deaths trail new infections least 1-2 weeks obvious reasons. recent changes masking cannot immediately result changes deaths. real would first see decline new cases. answer many peoples’ minds change - rhymes hero commenting trend non existent previous week. read comment above? Take advice chill out, stop aggressive nice. breath It’s causing miscarriages well... republicans arms killing -9 month old babies Hard tell we're really data rerouted administration, control president openly discusses fudging numbers look good.

After almost 5 months still enough testing, Trump telling team ""slow testing down."" That’s cost pills. That’s cost doctor prescribe them, nurse get them, record taken checking record make sure another nurse hasn’t already given any. He's religious, mental gymnastics thing! is? country 10 people another 1000 people, 10 get sick % 100% 1% respectively? Americans. know get Coronavirus know keep Coronavirus.

I liked better thought flying Puerto Rico allowed still. people coming safe states assume? tried reading article different language. masks work, whats problem? cup 240 mL. small container indeterminate size, often handle. glass merely material makes beverage container, usually handle. typical glass 200-600mL.

For Americans, cup approximately 1/8th size big gulp, 1/3 size morning coffee go. glass thing see antique shops, used made disposable cups oil souls sea creatures. That’s test less. killing economy  Well that’s problem. I’m saying issue isn’t unfairly paying coach lot, it’s unfairly letting players share profits Benson-Hedgecoxlycine  test start quarantine end. It’s definitely way that. daily cases can’t drop 2,000 3,000 day they’ve doing. Safer others is.  cover cool flow port fabric coffee filter, tape shut bung shut cotton ball shoved front keep flap closed safer others. Burden proof reasonable doubt.

Too much risk financially without uniquely strong case No, wine. 
Kombucha made tea.  Also teacher. Texas. We're fucked. little late bud. people try get sympathy change friends minds get covid really anything Sadneception. Yes, risk vaccines, that's think realistic believe effective covid-19 vaccine created within year. believe treatments get better, save lives. PTSD.

People today use phrase casually, anything. bad relationship months think PTSD? Lol.. no.

But got one thing right, know PTSD is. mean, 2016 debates pretty hilarious. Trump literally said clip giving verbal support Iraq war, available freely online, exist. Also nonsense S.K media government grew eye what's bullshit legit unlike western media. glass usually 8oz+, cup might 2-3oz. Florida reporting cases pneumonia instead. China never reported cases WHO. Whats fupa? insult banana republics like this.

 banana republics democratically elected president point tried gain fairer distribution resources US multinational corporations scream &amp; cry foul. followed United States overthrowing democracies giving power brutal dictator would allow multinational exploit countries resources pennies dollar.

The moral story calling US banana Republic insulting republics nothing horrible leaders yet everything ours. work college.

There's thing called Respondus Lockdown Browser. full screens makes sure cheating can't happen.

Additionally, there's proctor services like ProctorU require pan around whole room laptop cam/webcam see alone, check papers notes, allowed look off-screen watching proctor insta-fail you. know Spanish tests UCF couple years ago. Darwin. you’re risk shouldn’t go party. you’re hosting party don’t allow anyone risk. even talking this. different “A Texas man died drinking much, getting car driving road”. happens every day. don’t shut economy people. necessary resources pay X number people work extended period time

So Larry Kudlow know?  sub disease. France got shutting two months. far better shape. Now, states fire: Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arizona maybe Kentucky.

It's going tough. made World War II.

But tough. “Death panel” comments usually get deleted robomods. Odd post. neither need possibly quarantine enough money think many young people people suffers concert go. example boyfriend can't work 6 past months, go experiment done, knows able work years. many better take risk die dying working. Burn stake Oh it? I’d hope one multi-million dollar bills laugh existential dread. Looks size every picture articles. skinny obese. missing one appears thinner fatter? Yeah everyone shits flights honest seem relatively safe. Everyone masked, majority 6+ feet apart, planes sanitized flights, etc. However I’m sure there’s people plane secretly take masks Essential workers really ought issued pepper spray... concept data set 1 contains data a, b, c, data set 2 contains c, d, e, f. index two common fields fields combine enough identify people. set data okay release appear anonymous combined enough identify. tried find study thought remembered saw academic papers re-identification made feel better known thing people studying make sure doesn’t happen. Trump can’t make global shortages reagents swabs disappear golfing way can’t make virus disappear. Besides according Worldometer US ranked 21st 195 countries territories data tests per capita. exclude places fewer 10 million people, makes mass testing logistically much easier, ranked 3rd behind UK Russia. no, it’s definitely like “every country world” better testing us. countries like Mexico CFR 11% access testing limited.

I get sense we’re never allowed defend US sub, usually don’t, regardless Trump said slowing tests (which something controlled states federal government) running quite making progress running even more. hope meant 2020. cant take another 4 years this. True. guess Trump result tactic bullying via trade war remains power wants borders reopened Protest != Party. care that, you? mean let's real here? think outside resources would come from? stupid states two thirds country rest us going maskless crazies running rampant. intubate themselves. didn’t say Easter. administration wants economy healthy again. means people back work, even sick. yeah changes depending outside air temp. gets 80 degrees, air getting recirculated more. gets cold, humid. need hookups nut cup hand. think care anyone poor. Shhhh doesn’t fit narrative  Good news 0 deaths state today. Certainly would better. Hard say much, doubt would better. Seriously, breast ovarian cancer go COVID. shit hand, definitely good news hear sea shit haha.   Weeellllll. Maybe. general consensus scientific community is. virus living thing... well kind living, least made biological machinery living things. Humans example wont function well eventually die exposed extreme hot cold. biochemistry inside cells (also viruses) dependent temperature degree. Unfortunately science isnt advanced enough yet us fully understand innumerable interactions temperature, humidity, bodies immune cells, virus. Research animal models support influenza infectious relatively cold humid conditions. one knows true Covid 19 well.  inflammatory rhetoric. hope wrong. hope smart enough vote hope peaceful transfer office. Cool racism else message never heard. That’s thing, also immunity infection even thing virus. may able catch spread little recovery, months, you’re susceptible virus again. virus could behave differently next time too. made longer drawn out.. “yOuR bRaiN iSnT dOnE dEvELoPiNg” shut fuck bro, wanna talk least talk we’re talking about. ur Bumass teacher u ask look SitRep moment?

It shows USA zero cases zero deaths reported. also explains USA failed report data.  cannot imagine guilt believe exists. guilt hoax worse usual seasonal guilt people feel throughout normal lives #nonewguilt /s Yes please tell USA do, totally same. 

 point..... People Reddit always mix worse/worst... drives nuts. Reagan ended faairness doctrines Rupert Murdoch realized morons like propoganda leggy blondes point wasn’t decrease time ran body bags Jorts mullets. Hope get better friend trying do? predicted, comments here. LOL. Whoever biggest guns bullets get enjoy sports booze bar. Yes, makes sense. ""Reasonable"" nice? Yeah conservative relatives neighbors they're nice. politics come up. They're racist before, wear masks ""it's safety, control submission"" despite fact guys charge lost family members got really sick. They're totally okay federal officers fighting peaceful protests directly contradict first amendment core value conservatives, leaving states matters states. told think science sham, totally understand point science test almost yourself. 

They're brainwashed. Whether they're dumb debate. type donating common here, hear coming. US leave WHO? did, theres reason give data organization part Burning people together decrease burning time takes amount time fire go amount fuel.

Plus, ovens fit one anyway. mean.. (Meaning everyone really) probably trust data anyway. I'm Upstate area right now, pretty bad. people good signs remind them, people act like virus affect business usual. would think negative providing current statistics pandemic would do?

I'll let figure one out. WHO? o.O today really TIL! people elected widely known 😔 ..... ssshh dont upset reddit Yeah could bit cautious getting little ripped comments. try part staying clean, using good habits. appreciate feedback take advice. going motions case things continue escalate pretty evident news (massive increase cases death), maybe habits could new norm needed. Thanks taking time respond coherent thought post. Texas put restrictions place eventually runs hosts infect. wont stay high indefinately. hate admit like seeing joker floor pain sometimes feel like 80s stereotype dad who's like, ""This country going straight shitter!"" think we're actually seeing something like that.

America's dysfunction started getting notable 9/11, seems like we're genuine decline. I'm worried future supposed look like this. rage energy right wing going focused Trump? I've heard people say they're expecting return normalcy can't imagine that. They'll rally around continuation extremist politics make Tea Party look like Teletubbies reunion. That's thing though... Politics literally costing texans lives  lived Texas years never could grasp Mexican Republican demographic. fuck would support group absolutely despises you. always assumed whole conservative Catholic shit. Idk. Joe Exotic lose guy? There's good amount ok trump withdrawing good bad? understand many people Florida think hoax big deal refuse anything different worst case numbers right now. feel like they'd seen damage first hand perhaps know someone it. Actually right conducting investigation China (and allow it) asshole? big scam think. chinese health organisation agree country influential overall case numbers USA, they’re significant number countries reported 1 days. Including Spain, France, potentially Denmark/Norway.  look data value there. agree that’s it’s ridiculous us couldn’t come this. seeing 1.4k upvotes false information really bad imo Lol idea. I'm expert. read various news. happen entire building. happened part lab highest security. That's ""Bat Lady"" works. That's kept deadliest viruses. intelligence report speculated there's incident lab caused shutdown. That's evidence Trump alluding to.

One news media also noted one staff member's photo got deleted lab's site. Patient zero? way know without independent investigation. Someone spread virus seafood market.

BTW, timing athletes getting sick Wuhan Military Games match timing lab incident better. Games started Oct 18 athletes would Wuhan earlier. One French athlete told French press March/April. said doctor thought got infected around Oct 6, given incubation period. Starts ends rump Yup. Covid fosters Us vs mentality that’s fine them. that, legitimately believe argue greatest American president time. 


Of time. primary cause? grift. Let re-phrase. pains _anyone_ still wildly misinformed COVID-19. _especially_ pains many redditors following /r/coronavirus still misinformed. trying help anybody, especially cannot help wanted write headline encompasses America's main problems right now, could worse one.  No, anti-masker it. police involved must anti-mask, falsely arrested driver.

To visualize this, consider someone peeing leg. wearing pants leg get wet provide protection. wearing pants, leg get wet Thank you! Really? I’ve much beach time heat stroke day. Spending lot time biking walking parks too. Making use extra two hours since longer commute. Well increase miscarriages/stillbirths could lead less babies born preterm, right? I’m pharmacist infuriates Thanks pointing out, TLDR wrong, text correct. I've fixed it. Daughter distracting part.

Yes 1 imported asymptomatic carrier 43 domestic asymptomatic carriers, seems downward trend. Worth noting like day before, 14 new confirmed cases Laoning province (where Dalian is) yesterday asymptomatic carriers turning symptomatic.

The two Jilin Dalian. Tested Jilin found asymptomatic carriers, turned symptomatic yesterday.

As much test doing, well let put way:

Yesterday Dalian tested 1.25 million people. Anyone outside USA dude Apparently get audacity elect black man POTUS. don’t care. 

It’s simple that. 

They. Do. Not. Care. Trump  irrelevant. comment said everything bigger post discussing deaths Texas. Deaths bigger, even account population (which silly to). cases Texas last week we'll see. conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers, anti-mask dunces might understand world annual means.  


Seriously. get it. Nope, country physically morphed China. heard news? Thanks killing whats left family, asshole Voldemoron would 2016 Republican *primary* election used ranked ballots pairwise counting. GOP already rigged *general* election favor whoever Republican candidate be. wealthy insiders also infiltrated Democratic party, Biden instead Warren Sanders. learn done, please learn **better vote-counting methods** (or visit r/EndFPTP ask questions don’t know start). Thanks lot insightful comment. Time leave FB. won’t regret it.  ever lived US? know you’re talking about? Even besides obvious fuck ups, Europe's great either opening way soon.

It's bad leaders, also people many countries (not named Germany) unwilling submit liberty-infringing measures accept economic pain constitutes greatest emergency since WW2.

Europe's second wave massive, even Japan may find hard escape one.

Temporary submission (smart!) authoritarian rule collective goal basically requirement pull off. details support it. cops involved crazy anti-mask people too. There's thing called exponential growth went like normal we'll talking millions millions deaths covid alone also issues healthcare system collapse worldwide. coronavirus novel virus well known documented like flu. Also flu's death range likely rarely reaches higher estimate regular basis I'd reckon usually lower-mid range it. one knows true scope yearly influenza collapse hospitals like covid many countries. causes deaths ur mentioning preventable contagious. scary part people support trump even whats happening people trying warn everyone government bringing marshal law police state dictatorship... want that, want republicans ones top democrats. sure studies fake, link real studies official death toll still 149K, last updated yesterday. one see google least. Tik tok  WHY? ankle bracelet job fine, without added medical risks engineering complexity implant ongoing privacy implications monitoring longer considered necessary. covered article couple months ago family parents infected able avoid spreading kids. doctor instructed open windows house 15 min three times day a/c. doctor seemed grave seriousness transmission Covid airborne people even started discussing possibility media. run ""businessman"" ten tailed business ventures.  BS, lot people flee SK north end returning can't handle hypercapitalist hyperconsumer culture SK. point California's outbreak, liberals point Texas, Florida, Arizona outbreaks.

I love reading thought comes people understand situation CA.

Northern CA southern CA different, southern CA (and valley) large Republican districts. Look cases deaths located see very, stark difference.

Not saying northern CA cases deaths, either. fuck read? wearing piece fucking cloth make pervert criminal? tasks me. tasks shall him. No, highest powers education ran corrupt assholes think ones afford school pay it. saying Hitler stupid ignorant? Nobody expects spanish flu GAVE PROPAGANDA NUMBER!! duuuude Space Mountain!!!!!

/s link evidence? also 2nd biggest population second largest area, take much longer catch per capita despite fact thousands dying.  57 new confirmed domestic cases, 30 asymptomatic carriers found days before, immediately included cases tally start showing symptom. 43 carriers reported today, expected 20-30 people group showing symptoms plus 10-20 people tested positive become confirm cases tomorrow. trouble Hong Kong relies much goods coming mainland. resumed 14 day quarantine people entering Hong Kong, relaxed little. still apply truck drivers like guy. Where's evidence nonsensical bullshit Tube neck killed everyone stand numbers might fudged White House now. go first public gets see it. Can't. real world rich. can't get access it, costs much money. internet world left. happen next 100 years. Memes like seem catch without necessity educational background behind it.  Yes does. 

You can’t argue idiot, embarrass book flight Spain May started Italy opted it. we’re thinking booking October. think we’ll wait bit see it’s playing out. coming statistics came existing cases 90 pct people isolated getting symptoms getting tested 53% isolate test positive result.

Vic since time also mandated masks.  credit, least they’re wearing masks Finally global good news craziness. disease roll dice. Young healthy people 20s get sick regular flu end ventilators and/or ecmo limb ischemia bad lose arms legs, renal failure, brain damage, etc (assuming survive). COVID seems risk profile higher seasonal flu, especially considering flu vaccine mitigate effects flu, deaths extremely severe cases rare at-risk. think finding safest activities make tolerable live way relatively long-term. need long haul, huge difference going bile ride friend going packed bar something. Look things let feel like pose minimal risk others. Netherlands Germany (and probably places) following strategy months perfect seems like better solution swinging extremes total lockdown acting like everything normal. 

Although new scary risk calculations, actually already live lives way: every time get car risk dying accident, every time drink increase risk dying cancer. us accept risks, draw line drinking driving together that's kind reckless irresponsibility that's much likely kill you, people too. 

We're learning new set risk calculations need build good judgement compassion try new difficult thing together. Good done far. hope gets easier find safe enjoyable ways see people.

Edit: Also depends hugely are. lucky enough town city handful cases per 100,000 people, different story somewhere major active outbreak. Public health departments help people make good decisions making sure date accurate information available. imagine porto potties would worse fecal matter sitting hours. course problem getting small unit virtually ventilation shortly someone else virus. have, since protesters final word yet planning it. interesting see does.

What interesting article well, mention *start* measures were. I'm sure oversight.

Because end January/beginning February 1919.

So means ""partial"" lockdown lasted 6 weeks things reopening March. Spanish Flu.

[This describes like study it, ... look bigger picture realise people going daily lives, implementing protective measures. Highest power everything ran corrupt assholes. There, fixed you. 😔 Sigh. Darwinism action. t-shirt says “facts liberal conspiracy” still sometimes get dirty looks. What? There’s lie...  According Joe Bash: (09:21)

It working Italy right now, single-payer lack humanity humanity never changes. watch em YouTube. Something British accent engaging. fat families one little dramatic tho. Mostly old sick people, first. 

But icu full ? Younger healthier people die too. Perfectly avoidable death. live valley south Salerno (the city mentioned article) pretty difficult getting people respect masks inside bars (closer American cafes American bars). Getting espresso takes minute most, one thinks mask important getting one since take drink anyway.

Hairdressers don’t know much about, barber shops also difficult people since don’t want hair masks.

This town/province fairly old people, health issues. Unfortunately, southern Italians relaxed/unworried whole respect need masks. 


This I’ve noticed, hard fast case study. Anything goes positive outlook vaccine automatically gets downvoted. People rely info rose colored glasses, 80% patients reaction phase II trials healthy people! agree statement need see affects majority population older riddled comorbidities. Downvote want least read fine print first free Russia, testing curiosity reasons also free everyone

I wonder entrepreneurs run cheaper emergency rescue services America, like taxi, paramedic life support devices, charging, say, half hospitals do. legal issues this? feel like obvious sick/ infected person piece cloth face, germs get much. mean wear underwear? (a joke) approach really get us anywhere.   Or, refuse say? injured car accident pitiful attempt troll. know absolutely nothing lifelong permanently damage cannot possibly factor in.

All things mention happen very, small number cases disagree experience, amazing lack willingness eat variety key factor poor diets.

Granted, I'm poor introduced variety foods growing even adult. also strive pass along children, though one teen particular resists. 5000 30 million isn’t terrible compared countries size. It’s pretty average I’d say. problem trajectory. Also, 5000 30M bad compared e.g earlier hit countries saw first wave, since knowledge treatment. one confused video? younger guy seems bitching wearing mask camera cuts another older guy rolling around ground.... 😆🤣😅 probably explains faith isn’t shattered (I keep expectations low) Ah yes, glue factory. legal? Manitoba went almost 2 weeks cases. Pallister removed 14 day isolation upon entering MB tourism ads get tourism industry going. 60 odd cases week. Something low numbers made arrogant. Woah there.

Just seems like learned nothing New York doesn’t make puppet Governor. going one historic facts generations come kids learn school.

Like holocaust, hugely varying estimates general consensus 'millions' true count never known.   also ironic N95 mask invented Taiwanese-American guy cut off. allowed FL, example, submit falsified data starting back March. See ILI charts example, and, no, tracking covid. even addressing FL admitting include people live out-of-state half year FL covid cases, include death tallies either. 

The reality presidency shut classified external data had. keep repeating phrase yourself, progressively less reasons trust data stated. spun, openly falsified. still depend others live. Give time. Doesn’t lot responsibility fall government allowing too? 
Rich people access things government lets Well that's terrifying. rocks. **Question everything**.    
For decades established theory masks wrong wrongheaded. Regardless political views that's established theory hampered even hamstrung US. crooks top office decided needed monetize virus, used foreign tests we'd able control pricing.

The entire response virus based economic impact day one. never saving people, ever who's going make money us. Along lines, think would end way pulling gun out. Oh, right way sir didn’t know you’re crazy pos. great now! mean give everyone free medicare what's next?

of course not... would ridiculous... like claimed post above. socialize outdoors? impression you’d pretty unlucky catch someone keep normal distance outside. gatherings family backyard people *should* doing, instead meeting indoors, restaurants on. cdc says US 146,000 covid deaths. safe say it’s closer 200? lunatics running asylum. One friends experienced nurse posted article Facebook came out.

Everyone started relax left country. People even try socially distance (albeit difficult Hong Kong people less scared), fewer people wearing mask (Hot weather help), gatherings 8 allowed.

It expected another wave, numbers risen much quicker expected. say ""bored"", I'd say ""running mental health"". cut in-person contact entire social support community draining, people gonna mental capacity give damn things go long enough. Especially government's incompetence leaves end sight. Solid counterargument. like bit totally dodged question second time row... :) Drop bucket. envy you, still get upset. really frustrating see. Whenever see new groups people posting hangouts/bday parties/weddings social gatherings can't help think going fed different narrative. one seems shocked, anything they're applauded ""living best life"". 
The worst ones large platforms, get whatever want travel outside state work... vacation.
I'm surprised country. still frustrating watching people take seriously. I'm hoping get are, become less annoyed time. Sadly enough, dont think people like care get sick someone know does. That’s true. Case point: homeland. two long months strictest lockdown western world, still middle it. talk second wave. say it’s still first one. make people go away. Putting head sand help 2016 help now. Better know idiots are. I'm legitimately concerned SE America without either SEC NFL Football. It'll culture shock. Maybe leads people wearing masks. Maybe that's looting starts. know, boomers mostly trapped system little control over. There's information age back then, fed media produced locally. rate college education far lower. impacts climate change virtually unknown.

Even one person changed behavior, would virtually 0 impact society whole. 

Compare millennials COVID-19. know pretty precisely deadly infectious disease is, thanks information vastly accessible. ability comprehend thanks decent education opportunities. individual behavior directly contributes killing others.

Add hypocrisy, I'd say Millennials showing true colors, less. course, excluding minority that's actually following basic decency instead saying ""fuck all, I'm going die it!"" dude allowed guns? shooter? jail rest life attempting multiple murders. might surprise know south Korean firm place world vaccines produced. cold season yet come also developed countries. amount deaths “respiratory diseases” counted Corona deaths way higher expected amount.

But there's way would live there. Compared middle income countries, Morocco great job. first wave small current one leads bigger responses before. mentally prepared actually stab someone? like movies Possibly infected sewage exposure? also still limited testing US. can't get tested area unless symptoms knowledge exposed someone tested positive. allowed guns? Texas we're talking about? get chair, whatever lethal injection use there? How’s boot taste? Deaths easier miss? skip. allocate elsewhere. 

There’s way us “check”. 

At least testing results (tests processed, positive cases, positivity percentage) get idea end. 

Deaths we’re largely dependent getting told info. guess that's fair 🤷🏻‍♀️  proved mentally incapable owning firearms. he's ever allowed firearm this, proof system working. I'm sorry, purely American scenario occurred. Even slovenly, drunken Irishman would aware deadly pandemic, Texans certainly aren't. always wish paid money vaccines trials!

Tons pharma companies many, many countries researching developing COVID vaccines Wow. googling skills ahmazing. really love trying inundate facts ‘research.’ Seriously, know you’re listing facts confirm biases. COVID virus real. Wake fuck up. Imagine going prison destroying life could've get overpriced beer suspected quality bar food. [AT&amp;T said 338,000 people stopped paying since beginning year, means least 338,000 dead AT&amp;T users US normalizing means, “since president doesn’t seem care 150,000 people died four months, must means it’s big deal. Let’s get life”.

Desensitizing rather normalizing. delusions denial people live with! equal comical shit call government! ...and bet valved systems even effective simple fabric masks...

On cloth mask, reversing flow fabric re-inhaling virus particles.  valved mask, exhaling virus mask successfully, re-inhaling clean(er) filter layers.

big big difference already infected. Yes course trackers say 499 new deaths* yesterday US. 

That’s drop 50% compared past weeks’ daily numbers. 

Can anyone explain. would possibly react differently threatened person Friend Family. would defend dont see much chance me. It’s list friend teaching close 10 years now. list stuff us do. American, don’t understand register dog town every year, gun owners don’t register guns. that’s simple thing. Guns trackable. need register least every 3 years maybe take quick safety refresher course every 5-10 years. Also, gun safes mandatory. active shooter situations horrible, worst incidents kids accidentally get killed kill someone guns accessible. Thank - thread, thousands people assuming understand science, don't.

At least wear masks though.

Also, fuck corporations. That's profoundly stupid question. Yes countless dumbasses right constantly spotlight refusing wear masks deserve get shit on, lumped conservatives. like word feminist skewed negative left wing connotation anti-man dumbasses. plenty numbnuts sides belong categories, however rational viewpoints beliefs normal people sides valid collectively calling one side names useless detrimental. Sorry bad, mean quarantine control. Travellers Mainland required quarantine themselves. realize anymore? fact even spend time giving data baffling. Except say white people created it.

And directly addressed single argument actually made white people charge west.

Cause fucking are.

So bear outsized responsibility happenings situations western world. weeks ago. booked cases decline shot back up. (Went California places) 

I okay though, spend time vacation camping figured make flight. Lol idea fuck youre talking never happen US sadly. stupid (seems like mostly) conservative politicians saying wont shut matter Everyone. Everyone knew.

Being mindset robbing house, slowly realizing ain't shit steal frozen food hope better future. man raging erection sword shit? 

Regardless getting away not, bet break houses anymore. member flat-earth society, still take holidays, since 'global' concerns apply me? Could be. deaths harder miss. Let’s see slow coming weeks. ""This America"" Sixteen tons whaddya get? Disclaimer: Asian myself.

I say, means 100%, I’ve seen Asian Americans percentage wearing masks ethnicities. suspect fact many came countries common wear masks even covid-19 contributes this.

That said, still see occasional Asian anti-masker, “it’s flu”-er, chinstrapper, etc. too. great question. personally think help enough eliminate community spread. suspicion (and hope I'm wrong) going increase restrictions further. ""how respond people spread belief God?"".

Lot people preaching science still believing various dieties.

Kind hilarious selectively believe reality. Americans seem want it. I've downvoted whenever mention NHS better American healthcare. think people respect enough sometimes. know first, certainly looking comorbidities, obese related ones high among age. 

And one something it. Thanks! OMG....so painful think this. Issued?! Right they're asked confront loons like nothing bad happen Medicare amazing breakdown costs [travel NFL team logistics closed end week. utterly insane. Yeah, right. think we'd learn mistakes. mistakes made 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. 7 day moving average daily deaths doubled week, cases steady 2 months suddenly started continously going up. I’d argue still say “it’s flu” also likely deny Holocaust... would retested admitted hospital triage appropriate unit. covid positive would significant, however condition known manifest bacterial viral infection resolved. questioning narrative? police standards?  That’s regulations limit people reaching immense wealth, temptation react way great. Looking agitate wounds, heal them.  need scientists control, mathematical logistical problem handled politicians. lesson future generations. title sounds like plague inc. News ticker see virus takes saying? Kentucky built replica Noah's Ark show brilliant science is. also heard Italy pretty relaxed gun laws make US states blush. 

So agree may something US US also giant country many people amount 'Black Sheeps' larger.  Even tempting... it!

The person gave strong belief, basically demonstrated humility, vulnerability willingness learn.

Such behavior encouraged ""abused"". bit exaggeration. can't tell woke racist. thing know sure idea territory is.

Puerto Ricans citizens United States since 1917, move freely island mainland. state, Puerto Rico vote U.S. Congress, governs territory full jurisdiction Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act would like see Puerto Rico get statehood want it. would get federal dollars disaster happens. get people thought entitled insurance pay it.

Puerto Rico hopes lure American mainlanders income tax 4%. **Legally avoiding 37% federal rate** 13.3% California (or state) rate sounds pretty good. What’s more, tax dividends, capital gain tax Puerto Rico. know lot complex treaties. Like buy mainland vs directly importing stuff. Actually people need to. Otherwise one care virus keep ignoring precautions. happening right now. twitter fella claims we'll dozens NYC next 8 weeks -- 4 weeks ago. happened. Congratulations proving point. 😂 

It really matter say point.

 Whatever say pal 👍   yeah heaven forbid credit Biden anything death rate still low relative March/April. One would think, would get another country something. China maybe use lack deaths argue lockdown measures without apparently ever realizing relatively low deaths lockdown measures. conveniently ignore stastistics countries done well.

So lets look Sweden again.

No lockdown. COVID pretty much done Sweden. [yesterday's cost? 

Our every 10,000 people, 5 6 died course 5 months. vast majority final stage life.

That price paid.

No flooded hospitals. bodies street. Spanish Flupocalypse.

So looks like country says F*ck Global Pandemic Century.

Sweden’s projected economic downturn (1% GDP) less Germany (6.5%), Netherlands (6.8%), EU whole (7.4%), Belgium (8%), France (8.2%), Croatia, (9.1%), Spain (9.4%), Italy (9.5%), Greece (9.7%) UK (up 14%).

For comparison, New Zealand government predicting downturn around 10%. - Norwegian Institute Public Health says [shouldn't locked assessment now....is could possibly achieved effects avoided unfortunate impacts locking down, instead keeping open infection control measures,"" said. I've seen, 50% higher average (looking excess deaths countries). we're probably reaching 1m mark right now, least thin tarnished? pathetic gibberish. progressive platform dems ever bad, still half annual deaths flu Texas. *developed countries Glad survived can't imagine big medical bill going be.... people thread saying we've learned nothing wilfuly ignorant? live Louisiana reading makes scared lmao. Eh stay day playing video games anyway lol know mean, american problem. look Switzerland many guns often shooting occurs. want argue pro gun owning, take Switzerland example. lizard brain worst... Even governments still believe masks, let alone citizens... drink spilled car enough determine aggressor was. nah, Walmart lets without mask enforce policy Mono’s DNA virus, entire herpesvirus family forever, unfortunately. chicken pox, I’ve also shingles. Yay. second report today I've seen. article sub today grocery worker whose father became ill mentioned also paralyzed. good part walmart employees, underpaid, deal shit everyday bit brainwahsed company hype, mostly sings along  
the bad part ""sterotype walmart customers"" let's wear masks because.... Mostly tourists. Well, spooky is, incredibly rare ocurrance happen many viruses. 

Of course great aim downplay COVID, people panic thinking they're get paralyzed. read ""executing"" made bit nauseous...

But 3 cases, take drastic measures. Good them. while, US seems think 1000 daily cases another Tuesday. Business usual. I've thought too. Post viral fatigue real thing little known doctors is... nothing. fact virus causing large portion recovered patients force research condition people actually helped. Generating vaccines, concerning distribution material availability (packaging, needles, syringes, etc) cause problems too.

For reason many people think we'll magically contain thing end year. Getting effective vaccine first step. Logistics getting distributed properly going another matter altogether.

Obvious first candidates health care workers teachers, reason think end simple, bureaucracy never makes simple. good news? would imagine every 100 people recovered, 4 died. 

It would good news 10 million people never gotten it. course, negativity focusing on. Plain simple

I want name thing happening US people find universally good, biased

If we're going throw biases around idiot naive. That's &amp; mighty assume I'm paying attention news social media websites.

You aren't. talking privileges like fucking year 2 gender studies student found society functions. Better Spanish Flu, guess; also started early year mutating killing 30 50 million worldwide following winter. science become partisan politics? GOP leap assholes actively trying hurt United States? Jokes them, can't take dont have. Haha Haha. thought illegal carry gun drunk? 150k lot vietnam. That's probably equal several million usd (in purchasing power give perspective).

Ewwww never heard herpes causing paralysis except rare bell's palsy way. Bless them❤️ Well, actually do. 

Sorry lame know all, reviewed section virology microbio class *many* viruses this. 

It's far unheard of, we've already multiple cases happening COVID. Flare-ups, is. 

Getting paralyzed flare incredibly unfortunate, although shocking happen. Many things *can* happen anything. cold could kill you. 

My aim downplay COVID, hopefully help people realize rare things happen. happened him, mean significant piece puzzle COVID. article sucks, imo cause panic. ""It's really hard positive right now..."" 

Of course, negativity focusing on. Plain simple. things mentioned issues always present society, without COVID-19. really excuse. biased inclined see bad side things, indeed helpful times. However, current circumstances, really helpful, especially way people like milking it.

""If can't see people gloomy...""

I'm pretty sure EVERYONE aware happening world right US point one really needs reminder. times like these, best thing find anchor hold to, whether faith, loved ones, stuff have, privileges access internet able take walk outside nature.

Maybe one needs pay attention. go Walmart today, want to, needed pick prescription. health ambassador little old lady, standing sunlight, 90 degree day. smiled pulled mask. smiled little smile back said, ""Thank you."" all, two words, could hear much relief. says lot general behavior members public someone's grandmother practically starts cry argue grown ass adult right thing. read post would know luxury simply stay home. Otherwise, would. got swine flu back day possibly worst ever felt. slept four days straight army go back work. get recurring mono thing. feels like chronic fatigue soreness generally feeling good. Usually last couple days I’ll stay bed sleep. Thankfully husband understanding this! I’m sure time MURICANS killed shooting COVID rules virus itself. keep repeating this, that's also year's worth deaths flu shot. Beat lots diseases one life achievement gained. article CNN today stated places desperate workers blaming enhanced unemployment benefits. Personally think that's bullshit dangerous working right now. live (California) seeing tons places help wanted signs. wanna guy source better Bloomberg? like predict safe what's point. really rich probably already plenty properties around world. Regardless people feel whether protesters wearing masks, I'm sure many saw tens thousands shoulder shoulder streets nothing worry about, months warned virus less. Here's quick hopefully helpful protip tourists there:


Don't go holidays middle global pandemic.


Dm questions article Bloomberg Friday would require 2 shots. posted sub. Thats hit em ""I'll pray "" Sandy 100%. still houses repaired. shit ton houses either pay insane amounts flood insurance get house raised 6 feet. favorite pizza place closed down. would hope least insurance claims finalized. Borders thee me. 100 I'm brit lives Vietnam, yes, contact tracing brilliant here. I've experienced first hand too. can't commend government enough efforts taking seriously. main news website ""vn express"" gives mostly detailed breakdowns patient been, who've they've contacted ect, I'm constantly informed. stark contrast west. Well I'm downvoting care less votes. nice day. absolutely insane believe 50 million US die covid-19 year. Nobody sneaks blunderbuss school knapsack either. Lol wtf Imagine starting sports back pandemic. Smh, fuck world.  gods name McConnell stay power there? Playing tennis list safe activities saw. makes sense least one safer sports. Traveling plane top list dangerous activities. Dr. Fauci said eat restaurant fly plane time. never denied that. It’s really annoying downvoted even suggesting isn’t bad. idea even defending good aspects worthy admonishment kind culty, that’s coming ardent supporter sub’s mission. Everything big Texas..

Damnit, sad now.  Tell lie loud make correction whisper. Murdoch way. Wait, wut??? sure, post personal preference really mad folks totally missed. Seems word mask context fighting words... keep blaming people believe dumb shit. understand why.

But ultimately, survival depends whether neighbor wears tinfoil hat, society dumb bad.

My neighbor dumbass powerless dumbass. matter many Facebook posts makes neighborhood page, going convince anyone ban 5G. really matter believes he's writing policy entitled society functional enough prevent dumbass neighbor harming family.

So, yeah, angry neighbor.

But need angry politicians giving dumbass neighbor power safely have.

Does make sense? Oh man kids part dance/theatre group Jesus focused think Coronavirus hoax keep Donald Trump getting re-elected (that exact quote ex) still activities- ballet recital 200 plus people one room, full theatre production singing everything, one time 40 plus students stage masks. scary. still go kids old people go going die. fuckin scary. Lol M4 &amp; M16 available military. AR15 platform available civilians comes kinds calibers. Hell, could slap arm brace one it’s considered pistol. shotguns semi automatic, range handgun. “Not modded auto ones.” clearly idea you’re talking lol. Soho today.

They've already change ways, implement new ways working, longer goes easier permament change. questionnaires I've seen 50% office staff want continue home, quite easier work, lack commute thus money saving etc. 
So business could cut office space save money make half staff happier. Maybe it'll choice, maybe 3 days week home 2 days week work.

It seems like insurance company unable/unwilling insure schools pretty compelling argument in-person school likely wind sick dead kids (not mention parents, faculty, staff).

A school requiring waiver rights students attend would also seem constitute fairly glaring warning sign

A requirement sign waiver would ensure conditions met modifier 1 - ""If done intentionally knowingly"" Massachussetts rights Puerto Ricans living Puerto Rico. 

Right. Americans equal rights. that's situation corrected. Either Puerto Rico state, independent country. Puerto Rican, American citizenship.

And unless renounce American citizenship, makes American. Period. End discussion. thought read somewhere COVID spreading surfaces. airborn.

Robert Redfield made great decision two weeks ago announced publicly “If could get everybody wear mask right now, really think next four, six, eight weeks, could bring epidemic control.”

I live MD/DC suburbs. Mask wearing already broadly accepted here, last two weeks everyone's taken another level. everyone wearing indoors without complaint- shockingly high percentage people wearing outside sidewalks walking trails. now, data fairly convinced outdoor transmission rare enough worry distance maintained. more, I'm taking mask lanyard, happily cover face someone passes courtesy.

Local municipalities proactively monitoring situation cases tightening back restrictions things get completely control.

Yea, that’s *is* fucking gross. actually idea going Portland Seattle, you? Watch live streams listen protestors. people peacefully protesting wanting heard, instead getting shot at, tear gassed, even fucking abducted. applaud that? ""good people Seattle"" risking lives expose threat freedoms. are, shitting ""lol lib tears."" fucking sad really makes hopeless.

IDK. rules 1, 5, 8, rule 4 kinda feels ambiguous.

Xer here. started wearing masks February (and CDC totally fucked testing then) probably wouldn’t close much anything all, would certainly position open everything now. don’t think Korea needs advice anyone right now. investing resources well. report imported cases, doesn’t mean people running amok streets. It’s controlled. Trump’s priority stock market. downplaying virus investors saw potential virus cause major catastrophe started selling; profound example trump’s short sightedness. 140,000. hard happy United States, period. Yeah, US give false numbers showing covid cases declining like China. /s

When over, re-establish ground up. Increase funding proportionally countries (US providing 20% WORLD health organization). I'm fine US spending adding it, others need pull weight. see, irony allowed also You’re smart man. Good you. I'm actually banning animal products. cant really ban anything real, look war drugs. think going changing one mind time. Moving animal product subsidies plants would also go long way without outright forcing anyone. There’s plexiglass TSA agent confirms identity, it’s bad. Plus mask well. Everything Reddit.  Oh long time coming. 

Over decade ago Chomsky wrote book called Failed States that explicitly showcased US shared commonalities “failed states” militarily intervened in, US becoming increasingly danger citizens. sudden fall grace - people cataloguing decades.
The US lagging behind quite important metrics Trump, many politicians across board placing little importance systemic failings. course, diversity approaches (with Trump/ modern GOP genuinely terrifying), resistance really address issues implement strong change needed widespread. getting Trump office isn’t enough tackle false American exceptionalism need change.
Here metrics US lagging behind (per capita):
Following blueprint 2016 report Organization Economic Cooperation Development (OECD)
The US second-highest rate poverty among rich countries (This includes standardized poverty measure, adjusted country)
According 2012 UNICEF study, 23.1% US kids live poverty. studies place number little lower, 20%, numbers much higher advanced countries. black Hispanic American children, poverty rate even higher, 36% 31%.
Obesity primary indicator poor diet, although US isn’t fattest country world (several Pacific island countries, well Qatar Egypt, precede it), leads OECD countries obesity.
Americans spend nearly 17% GDP health care, yearly per capita cost $9,400. That’s $1,600 second-highest spender, Luxembourg, double OECD average.
The US fewer physicians, hospital beds, psychiatric care beds economically advanced countries, ranking towards bottom parameters. US also advanced economy world full health coverage population.
Child mortality higher US advanced economy (even adjusted reporting differences), adult Americans also live shorter lives: Average US life expectancy 78.8 years, nearly two years less OECD average. comparison, Japan longest life expectancy OECD, 83.7 years.
The US also stands one countries world maternal mortality increased, rather decreasing, past 15 years.
In US, early childhood education attended fewer children (55% versus OECD average 84% attendance), older age (four years old, versus three years old), administered untrained professionals.
US women’s political representation also leaves much desired, less 20% congressional seats occupied women. Sweden, OECD leader, nearly 45% national parliament, global average nearly 27%. Female representation boards publicly traded US companies also OECD average. top off, gender wage gap also bigger US.
The US also, Lesotho, one two countries world mandate paid maternity leave.
Only 12% US energy output renewable, far European, world OECD average.
Current US investment infrastructure 75% average OECD nation.
The US highest income inequality rich countries. Income inequality calculated OECD combining several indexes, including ratio income highest 10% lowest 10%.
Deaths assault almost five times high US OECD average
When comes democratic institution, US one lowest turnouts among high-income countries. (The US one countries eligible citizens aren’t automatically registered vote.) [edit: countries like Belgium, Sweden, Denmark regularly get 80+% voting age population voting, US gets around 50%, plus 6+ million felony disenfranchised 2016, addition many means voter average American worker works 400 hours per year (10 40 hour weeks) average workers Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, etc. Americans mandated vacation Denmark, Netherlands ~30+ days paid vacation + paid public holiday.
The United States currently require employees access paid sick days address short-term illnesses short-term illness family member. 24% civilian workers United States, roughly 33.6 million people, access paid sick addition, overall economic mobility is low.
These just some metrics show US can, should, improve. Additional metrics would include: racial wealth/income gaps, Deaths Despair (worrying trend showing massive increases suicides, drug OD, alcohol deaths, etc, last 20 years), collective bargaining (see OECD rankings US ranking near dead last), student debt, etc.
Edit:
One key metric omitted: United States 25% world’s prisoners, despite 4% world’s population. 2.2 million people incarcerated. 1 150 Americans are currently incarcerated - highest per capita rate world. ~1 10 voting age Americans felony charge - many nonviolent drug possession, millions prevented voting due this.
There people incarcerated today drug crimes for all crimes 1980. 500% growth prison population since 1980, overall US population grown 45%. Even crime rates fell, incarcerated. seen, large, close quarter prison population many coronavirus Maybe that's CDC worried fall. expecting people virus return next time get flu? 300 pound linemen breathing directly other's faces play. Thought Florida day  interconnected mass tourism two whole different things though. married someone really can't give meat dairy know firsthand experience hard simply ask someone go vegan. Even forbid it, people start poaching. even happens France (on certain species endangered birds). Luck. geography. I'd agree number cases probably higher reported, highly doubt 4 times higher official number. Remind hell us Puerto Ricans Hawaiians let Americans risk virus spreading expect help U.S. Government? tourism important health? legitimately feel like nothing tourist attraction. Like bad enough U.S. tried pull help tried leave us alone suffered devastating Category 5 hurricane theyre letting sick people island contributing reemerging rising Covid cases damn thing help us relieve stress. know there's Americans really care us feel us honestly, fuck U.S.

Nitric oxide antimicrobial anti-inflammatory molecule key roles pulmonary vascular function context viral infections pulmonary disease states. article reviews rationale exogenous nitric oxide use pathogenesis COVID-19 highlights potential contributing better clinical outcomes alleviating rapidly rising strain healthcare capacity. nearly panicked enough.  Well got recession media begging definitely shut down. Sorry local government sucks bad. Hmm, interesting. Good know.  start repealing lot laws already have. accomplish anything. I'm pretty sure decided herd immunity way go beginning, caveat we'd need shut prevent hospitals overcrowding. come state it, never really plan eradicate thing without ton people getting infected first. way prevent it. 

We're large country population skeptical government mandates most, lot international travelers (both visitors), absolutely political shut international travel. actions necessary reduce R 1 simply costly economic terms terms erosion freedom.

With said, even herd immunity approach benefits greatly mask-wearing behavioral changes reduce R (work home possible, limit large gatherings, etc.). lower get R behavioral changes, lower herd immunity threshold be. total number infections deaths cut factor 2 3 fairly inexpensive precautions. live NJ livid this. highest fatality rate country (nearly 1,800 deaths per million people) temporary lull (thanks harsh lockdown March-May) country surge. think situation last. see summer camps going neighborhood people wearing masks except go shops, fortunately, still mask mandate. sure people out-of-state, well people NJ holidaying elsewhere bring back. surge South spread Virginia/Maryland according Worldometers, matter time. $50,000 Mind you, baseball easily socially distancing friendly sport American professional sports. even hold together days. rich trickle down, trickle proportionately. like rich person trickles $1,000 middle class, turn trickle $100 lower class. like rich middle class trickle $100 lower class, lower class increasingly receives less goes back corporations owned rich class, sends shareholders, overseas due globalization. difference MLB got fast access testing could see problem days.

They admitting accepting facts induced outbreak mid-September early October.

They know there's going outbreak. care know care another couple months. problem future selves. Mayhap isn't, better we've got. husband’s company WFH since early February made decision return 2021. thankful. hope companies follow suit. /r/antivax way joke?

It really sucks far many selfish people world, turn making life difficult everyone. needed. unsubstantiated, doom-and-gloom-driven speculation.

Oh man epic levels irony. want included screencap Per CDC website 2-14 days. Example fact, Sunday, biggest one-day death toll far state happened back July 16, 114 known died. press claiming 2,013 died July, actual number known deaths 1,847

Hey folks! Delayed reporting deaths increased apparent July death toll 5%! See totally overhyped! Nothing worry about!

So yes delayed reporting shift numbers slightly. Florida still problem. authors know desantis, trumpheads anti maskers read headline go 'see false news!' article really say numbers wrong.

Is distortion? Yes. Florida still massive problem? Hell yes.  Tha team least corona cases wins World Series 151 days til Christmas. Congratulations, though!!! fucking awesome Lol yeah, think so.

Saying 2022 means lag time virus start moving people back office. can't access Google's internal data sets directly, use tools provide curious want play around data relatively limited way. use Google Trends, instance, see trends surrounding search terms combinations thereof.

Search interest searches containing words [""mask"" example, pretty much non-existent peaked June year. 

If search terms related pandemic like ""mask CO2"", ""masks unconstitutional"", ""mask freedom"", ""mask disability"", see similar search trends interest starts rising around March peaking people search stuff related pandemic political/personal interests. mean could click link see numbers from..but ok, I'll play along. Considering specifically stated new tests new positives I'd say pretty easy see got it. illegal saying, thing wrong people is, work hard? get pass ignoring social distancing rules job hard makes stressed tired?

Where draw line though? Lots people hard jobs make feel stressed tired.  I'll take ready tell everyone know took it.

Meanwhile, typically conservative hypocrisy dismiss abhorrence people voting Roy Moore charged found guilty, express dismay Biden, also never charged found guilty. Roy Moore charged innocent - got away power, know did. Dozens women accused him. Biden, one serious accuser even credible. Big difference - false equivalency.

In meantime, millions Alabamans voted Moore despite knowing full extent criminality. forget election close - like Moore lost landslide. didn't. almost like could strong quick federal response understand, there's thousands Reddit China, North Korea, Venezuela non-stop LOL

Can't take medicine? said enough medial professionals time.

China handled virus professional efficient way. population cooperated effort. nearly virus free.

Many countries defeated SARS2 contact tracing, essentially protected state back then.

That really address point, all. try keep up. 

Except Taiwan (very insulated island country), there's single country Earth lower death toll SARS2 SARS1. said pandemic response force still around, SARS2 would looked like SARS1. explain SARS2 far worse literally every country except 1? get rid pandemic response teams?

In San Francisco that's referred ""A normal Tuesday"". asked one facilities guys work (I'm still going office, luckily 15 people usually 300). joked saying ""hey building HEPA filter AC units?"" laughed said ""the system would choke HEPA filters"". said filters nothing going catch something like virus, small filters use. I’ve seen similar comment somewhere, inflexibility shown. It’s shocking. Good luck 🍀 Im sick tired many people trashing America. 

I real honest question: whats answer here? fight virus keep economy afloat? seems like everyone reddit loves shit America. dont go ahead give us magic answer?

What government do? IFR death rate really improved. CFR death rate meaningless, testing map. 
 
Florida seen 10% true cases NYC got. Post title click bait.  know nurses thay still belive hospitals told non-airborne reduce fear.

They wont believe research accepts risk airborne transmission. could go work , knowing could get air?

Good way rack downvotes though. depends, HVAC setup different % new vs recycled air. probably one day thing cause Sundays numbers inconsistent sometimes higher usual times lower. look weekly trends day day. widespread denial years. 20 years hugely popular YouTube channels dedicated ""debunking"" coronavirus myth, 40 years population split half half deniers believers, like moon landing JFK now. much mom paying gave birth 26 years ago. Look what? Kinda. guess not? Maybe? America people use context, usually upset something like here. Literally weird word English. really sure. Tested 850K 7% came back positive. 7% lowest percent positive since July 5. sure backlog cleared not. think this: idea started great, really lost way maybe ran good ideas? kid sure going amazing, stopped 1-2 seasons drink whole gallon spoiled juice, sure go bathroom, A&amp;E psychiatrist Last Friday highest ever slightly 78k. 

Deaths 1000/day last week so, dropped bit shy 400 today. give opinions weight consideration facts. don’t know sure. That’s there’s always risk vaccines. It’s well worth risk nonetheless. HCQ... sympathy meter still move today.

A Force 1 hurricane peanuts TX.

Wearing Mask ""muh freedumb"".

Combine two, catastrophe hands. sad way look life. don’t know gauge happiness now, doesn’t seem like you’re looking right places moment. would like talk, feel free dm me, I’d love see help point right direction.

Edit: someone tel I’m downvoted people lol. don’t recognize names, maybe ask kids 🤣 Iowa test weekend. joke. Exactly. Viral load term referring amount virus someone sick per volume blood. Like amount copies virus ml blood. Infectious inoculum dose correct terms much virus one exposed to. Bigfoot alive said so. Believe me!!! absolutely agree come workers compensation. Make reckless employers pay it. then, thing really worry employer might try argue employee contracted outside work. is, unless multiple employees get close it. thought known. Stop freaking lol.

In reality get exposed possible infection lot time come fine. Remember get infected infected, still small amount population carries infection. Even ""unlucky"" infected, transmission 100% guarantee person person, especially outside. would get double unlucky, pretty small percentages.

These chances add time might get virus eventually, reason especially worry single one encounter unless reason believe virus spent good chunk time somewhat enclosed space close them. oof, legend Iowa routed numbers straight governor, backed least week best know bad week ago. Republicans agree masks good? numbers infected deaths fallen daily since trump stopped CDC receiving data giving job counting cases deaths Jarad Ivanka kids. almost like telling people stay home (with dollars) felt unsafe. 'Cause did. infection fatality rate gives us idea lethal virus is. 

What's interesting Idaho's numbers normally generally mild illness occasionally causes death (like COVID) high case fatality rate, low infection fatality rate. we've seen everywhere. Case fatality rates 4 11% range, infection fatality rates 10 times lower.

However Idaho started relatively low case fatality rate that's declining range estimated infection fatality rate everywhere else.

That's hard explain.

Also, need realistic numbers FFS. 146 deaths Idaho nothing. post definitely originate US lol Yes, one still works.

Like lead paint, invented closed air AC makes us sicker. Add toxins wood floors, furniture, carpets, etc. professional air monitor toxin buildup builds house 2 3 days typical. Also Co2.

Open windows quickly clear (few hours every 2 3 nights). four year old wears mask. honest, probably better adults. it, school age kids. call center worked log using bathroom got bitched day shits opinion, yes. USA never locked fully never really took virus serious countries used lockdown expand hospitals opinion isn’t valuable anyone.

Edit: locking would also mean millions go poverty since first lockdown implemented properly.. good them, people protest everyone else able want well good bad. Fuck Covid. I'm lucky I'm Quebec, Canada region mostly spared covid 19. Know what? We're FLOODED tourists.

I hope social distancing masks helps us. virus take Sunday go church something?

It go see idiots continue attend. Woah Lmaooo think bubble sports work, idk MLB thinking though Well got hand quickly TVP (textured vegetable protein) works great anything needing ground beef, dry rehydrate water broth. Sounds like could work you! See, people understand God Democrat, Republican controlled states get hit hurricanes. Thats really funny I'm ortho wish radiology even anesthesia.

Ortho cool enjoy working hands never realize long turnover times well right equipment scrub techs shit like obgyn need specific hardware.

And Call. Ugh... call ER dumbest nonsurgical garbage. Back pain 5 years? Call doc 2 am. Ridiculous

And agree PA NP great life. amount knowlege average NP PA astounding however PA school kind ridiculous short is. CRNA actually went program CRNA NP time two years. fair.  Well, personal experience, got first shot HPV vaccine told couple months turned 26, time give one shot insurance longer covered it. 

Hooray! Maybe people keep siloing like stop coronavirus. Ahhhh. page load right mobile. see columns don’t knock crocs til try crocs That’s pretty normal. lot vaccines need series shots.

I bet that’s going put lot people getting though. Unsurprisingly, looking news station ""about"" page, station part Sinclair broadcasting network. use caution reading. Money money money money FL governor insists Safe!

Seen vehicles FL plates New England. Please return home!

New England experiencing low rates want spike up. Wtf anyways

If Europe, probably GDPR. local news sites, easier block EU rather deal GDPR requirements. makes perfect sense me. slowly surely increasing testing supply routinely running 700k tests day now. fact running even tests something prepared (yes know been, fact shortages kinds test components aren’t easily solved) meantime cutting demand quick way help improve horrible turnaround time. could either limiting tests people seriously ill limiting tests people already known infected research says longer infectious. course latter option better.  Again, thinking *income* tax. work government pay income taxes, others don't. still leaves [payroll taxes, social security taxes, business taxes, gift taxes, estate Thanks, keep mind. little access refrigeration live primitive side, look forward rush cook consume too. Dried beans easy store. going Wal Mart relatively short trip everyone else moving around. what, 30 minutes max?

In school, would classroom around people hour long bursts. Much longer time infection occur, virus particles build room someone infection spreader.

Eating restaurant pretty risky though while, maybe would eat outside it. Forget that, blessed subjected life miserable planet first place. Godwin's Law alive well. sports need quashed year. need sports bad. Yes, kind. :) Same, sanity resting hope. least carries fall doesn’t pan out, next hope around corner least. local health department. closing damn northeast, nobody allowed in. Instead stealing medical grade N-95 masks hospital, please buy KN-95s. available US days hospitals want buy US made certified products. I've purchased KN-95s perfectly fine, maybe good 3M masks past, they're pretty close. post didn’t say racist. Martin Luther guy saw Christian Church forgiving sins sinners exchange money, said fuck made lutheran church? Especially 10 million 1% population, lets 99% continue business usual enough money buy $300 headphones, would definitely also enough buy stock. $30 headphones rich blood. Hasn’t best time lives (went rough patch lockdown ended reason), happy say we’re still married. would agree control probably lock instead reopen everything? Spreading misinformation dangerous. thread Covid-19. could learn others successes mistakes. well said, thank you. ideas numbers today low? Still hour left worldometer count, looks like cases end 10-15k last sunday's deaths even slightly last Sunday, upward trend cases deaths. I'll rephrase it. willfully taking significant risk could spreading deadly disease.  common knowledge many young people Covid positive, asymptomatic. Attending party reckless behavior, endangering health lives families, people communities, many others ultimately. Especially 3 states ate daily registering new cases excess 10,000 per day, unacceptably reckless. Ehh, I’m sure causality right here.

Epoch Times, along Shen Yun dance tours you’ll see flyers billboards every major city, organizations revolve around pro-Falun Gong, religious group persecuted outlawed Chinese government two decades. lot practitioners Falun Gong live US donate, yes. sidewalk proselytizing comes directly religious roots. 

The orders priority (1) religion, (2) anti-China, (3) anything supports 1 2.

When president United States anti-China, throw support behind president. repeat Trump’s China coronavirus conspiracy theories hatred China love Trump.

It basically propaganda response Chinese’s government anti-Falun Gong propaganda. Unfortunately, supporting radical politicians around world writes generally kooky stuff, put lightly. It’s shame, feel like forced organ harvesting gets completely drowned bizarro things Epoch Times related groups put out, point wonder it’s actually intentional attempt discredit Falun Gong. like hundreds thousands. hope people realize painting left/right stark terms reason political divide do. always limit empathy. choosing different threshold cutoff variety reasons. Simply casting threshold well could change time selfish. Let know denouncements Tedros, ~~W~~CHO, CCP announced, trials start. point trying make? Kind odd collection celebrities. trying say celebrities get Medal Freedom first place? Nothing happy living anymore unless you’re super wealthy. wrong stimulus? Again, can't use countries' death rates hospitals impacted, death rate goes due triage.  Interesting, I'm ""the flu"" colloquially refers stomach flu, one really says flu unless they're vomiting. recently learned symptoms actual flu realized probably couple times. You’re kidding right? Seth rate function protocol 
If die without coronavirus test 5 symptoms flu like illness Ecuador. I've lived life. expect I'll visiting States quite time. biggest difference would President Obama First Lady Michelle wearing recommending masks Day 1.

If masks worn leadership starting Day 1, America 100,000 residents dead right now, 1,000 dying every day.

Also, President Obama certainly would pretended SARS-CoV-2 non-issue hoax, thus would delayed act. reason Trump Death Clock Guess got millions Muslims camps who? like choosing litterer murderer chimps less 1% different us. karen shows calls wearing mask exhaust unit....Ive read considered nos Can't make tests/pre *free* they're damn important? Someone needs set go-fund-me. hardship her. exactly gun control. Rage hard foresee difficult self control. guess we're different. always really sucked me, never like that. I'm bed two days gone. I'm fully aware alert time, even temperature cracks triple digits and, over, really deal hacking leftover congestion days.

Easily worse cold, *that* bad me. Flu season cancelled. less infectious. can't survive current climate mask-wearing improved hygiene. Probably used word ""slowly"". Well would less people bar afterwards. decades. Good info. research learned merv 13 16 focus .3 micron percentage captured first pass. size water/clumped virus, smaller virus size.

Virus particles rated .125 micron small merv 17 higher. Well corona virus kill wether believe Spreading freedom usually means dropping bombs. seems like likely part plan well. wouldn’t put past people charge point. ""during"" Hemorrhoids long term effect! seemed like half respondents hadn’t entered today’s number yet. Right, usual summer pneumonia death spike. Happens every year. /s last country would think would pull China stunt would USA

it's like dark knight; either die hero live long enough see become villain China probably smirking base claim corrupt trusted, yet (being WHO) issue Trump, nation problem except USA somehow? USA says bad everyone else disagrees know side I'm inclined believe aware number people still, day, believe Donald Trump good job president? Let's hope everyone votes instead, progress much short amount time! get sentiment case one particular golfing leader, less time governing, better. compare numbers less thousand I've noticed like half comments like this. Really like enacting superiority people posting reddit huh. Keep making world better place. We’re country. It’s us them. test less people less positive tests, AZ decreasing positive tests  Listen, I’m saying state isn’t cool. I’m saying Texas cool well. There’s lot dope shit there. There’s backwards people everywhere. Right thoughts jumped well - except Z Nation exactly mean, obligatory 'white people bad'? People deserved voted people power change too, however, think difficult USA population superiority complex. wants kill people. You’re right understand it, healthy people aren’t supposed understand it. answer question -- virus carried exhaled droplets, large percentage droplets caught even simple masks, risk transmission goes way down. infuriating! Fb friend vacationing family PCB posted yesterday great time they’re even though “a really bad cold”. Makes sense. problem understanding meant, critiqued meaning...anyway? Lmao three F's throw away report card mom sees. American, I'm fucking exhausted. oh boy mad China hid data WHO? Deaths unfortunately going get worse, early signs indicate Texas finally plateauing hopefully start seeing continued decrease new cases. said distancing. Distancing cramming. can, have, physically moved rows apart front behind you. dont prayer books out. bibles except bring. communion right even donation dishes passed around. Singing masks bad?

Sounds like dont frequent church. 8t started. think happened media people social media keeps telling people “the side” irredeemably evil people deserves everything that’s happening them. Seen happen relatives, too. 

And see sides, honestly - exacerbated fact people internet tend assholes reinforce thinking. 

People basically need nicer internet go outside. Yeah, room mate works one local bars he's always passive aggressive towards 'cause I'm job rn. Always boasts he's working this. Honestly I'm terrified he's gonna bring back I'll bring Dad who's late 60s.  he'll publish data independently right? founding fathers never thought low-life crooked infested spawn Satan would run office trump . 

Shitty tyrannical leaders existed since dawn civilization, course tried plan it. We've raised ceiling, floor still floor WHO, organization rubber stamped China's lies, organization U.S longer part of?

Yeah, wonder provide data. coming pro-mask, left voting Californian. go fuck itself. Dude, guy smoke shop day trying convince gonna go away November election. like “why would ENTIRE world sacrifice freedoms economies AMERICAN election, kidding? makes us special?” irritated... didn’t much say except “well, we’ll see. We’ll wait see.” wasn’t wearing mask either (against state’s guidelines might add) cherry top. know, could imagine flu killed many people every year, mean holy shit. fluthers idiots.  total death rate spanish fly unknown death rate classified 
As result guess incomplete records stop ww1 due death rate barracks forgot hemorrhoids COVID flu

Coronavirus Influenza different types viruses. can't call Coronavirus Flu correct. Maybe you’re infected going save getting sick! monitoring flu, counts cases ILI (Influenza-like Illness) fell cliff shut down. Here's kicker: ILI includes large chunk Covid cases (any respiratory symptoms). means COVID + Flu year less Flu normal year. flu got absolutely knocked fuck season. Freedom eating McDonalds

Mnuchin: ""Let eat Big Macs"" I'm little disappointed craft store male CEO. Spoke Germans 2014 concerns direction USA taking. remember somewhat ashamed country even then. Trump. must look like now? dunno I’m shocked much “no immunity” got repeated without really nuance basis science.

Christ feel like suppose learn immune system middle school. Insightful. trust now?  truly shows important hold politicians rules game regardless politics.


It never happen believe would really valuable Biden announce reducing executive powers wins election. Brat  Freedumbs FTW, go Rona! Keep US #1! lost facade. rot underneath goes back 1980 least. Reaganomics putting wrong people charge. *Now even journalists punish political integrity.* course civic culture produces garbage vs. garbage floating sea garbage. Good luck Joe Rogan! whole upto 650k estimate actually high even seasonal flu. I'd argue rarely happens actual death toll flu's per year mainly lower-mid range estimate. It’s Brett*. Sadly country still backwards ass laws cannabis Hehe, like imagine person supposed procrastinating shut border Hong Kong already SAR government get shit together.

I'm fine mainland sending HK help, ask first. america things  worst symptoms?
The dude claimed asymptomatic people devastating long term effects *yikes* 

Care elaborate? Exactly - Rome report either. Oh, yes. stay near beaches, mountains, sunshine hot ass, smelly state bad politics? moon landing deniers freaks deservedly get punched think party builds high speed rail electric busses massive dams? contrary Western propaganda, primary way party maintains power via secret police mass internet surveillance, massively improving living standards ordinary Chinese people via good governance. 

The moment party stops moment grip power severely weakened. term limits gives power unelected officials lobbyists, though. term limits presidency until, what, FDR good job? Cheaper income tax. 

Many people business left reason. 

If you’re making 100k+ California. save extra 5-8k moving Texas state without income tax ... group three men weren’t allowed capacity reasons, scuffle One men wasn’t allowed reportedly went vehicle returned ""assault-type weapon"" according police. opened fire sports bar.

... goes person's mind... Full capacity reached = unload gunfire sports bar. Wow. Woooooow. hey please show respect beloved Schumann live rn consider majority people political sides reasonable &amp; independent-thinking? sold MAGA masks would whole different case. I'm American dyngus shit, Sherlock. Seeing stories like worries friends plan get married 2 weeks. 

Maybe 30 people taken masks distancing serious together, spread spacious backyard. one expected celebrate group 5-6 people conversation, they'd spaced 6+ ft other? may well set conference call order chat. see people sticking start they're going get tired group degree.

Why wedding canceled? money can't get back. places already booked 2021. think we're fine we've duty wearing masks distancing despite groom least working retail job small, confined store.

All groomsmen, 6 us said we'd prefer move really must get legally acknowledged married, elope we'd celebrate later. listen? Clearly no. make changes try make us feel safer. conversation flu vaccination, friend insisted gets flu every year. refused believe I've flu adult life (maybe kid). genuinely believed bit head cold = flu. seems many countries, flu deaths estimated. Like, Germany, bad flu season, we’ll estimate around 25K deaths. actual number confirmed flu deaths (i.e. person died tested positive influenza viruses) rarely 1000 per year, often lower 3-digit number (just hundred). need bot reduce 3 words That’s they’re telling people eat less. practical advice, ideal “oh everyone ate like Italians”. It’s going happen UK US, message eat less garbage less fat. Pretty simple. mention always foreign workers Singapore concentrated 12 people one room none died. least eat bean curries.

300 000 people physical distancing impossible, nearly 50 000 infected (what happen bean) zero deaths.

I wondered science looking positive examples hope now. begins myth immaculate infection. Translation: 150k USD buy lot Vietnam, US. Ok. course might case. say loud America... Could kids older age. Getting kids age 30+, complications child. 2020 ya major shitstorm coming winter hits. might miss friend, maybe could argue they’re emotional right now. Losing hurts, could obviously use support. it’s suspected loss came COVID last thing probably need right inviting people home.

If want try mend bridge, send delivery sorts.   would fight neighbours destroy country, claiming ""they started war""


Murricans fucked people... infected also way higher, recovered (because can't track recovered patients without knowing sick first place.)

Even sub fetish it, deaths gets higher everything else = still low morality. 1/2 million deaths vs 50 million Spanish flu, exactly compare? keep seeing brought up, parents magically stop working summer kids off. usually make arrangements. might case too.

Children probably going large reduction quality education, that's inevitable given circumstances. way around honestly going parent involvement parents opportunity. Use online resources prepare kids advance still month 2 kids go back find way ensure learning kids working. It’s exactly doxing it’s still weird felt need post 2 wave first signs? First all, someone Slovakia, cooking always seen cheap alternative, growing mindset, makes sense. shopping, make bigger shopping bf weekend suppose, buy necessities week. picky eaters, thing? mean see depends parents. growing up, none friend really picky eaters, can't imagine that. groceries, people really like (for example could eat tomato soup, going vomit), general people get used eat. Otherwise would difference eating habits trough world, least opinion lmao hit nail head. Flu used much culture people understand bad is

I flu 8 years ago (tested doctor)

I literally couldnt walk 20 minutes one point. Scariest time life- thought id never able walk again

I couldnt move legs muscles worn flu

I learned mess 607 here. Mask compliance medium-high seems improving. Go Bills mean, human race fine. individuals fucked. fucking sad right.   told friends refuse physically distance flu truly know expect. Maybe listen. reporting excess mortality. Belgium broader definition death covid also counts people ""presumably"" died covid, even never tested.

Still besides point since talking cases, mortality. people forced pushed ~~repositories~~ homes course, trying discredit efforts put in, could lot worse. pointing slight flaw post replying to. screw people die actions. long you’re fine. AP online tests massive failure. Burn stakes good measure. I’m saying do. event of, god forbid, civil war, well that’s really would happen large scale. Guerrilla warfare cutting supply lines, destroying water mains, cutting communication equipment, small, concerted acts outright fighting. Even event large scale violence, Afghanistan Vietnam shown us war attrition possible win United States military. That, desire reelection. believe numbers all. 60% people Bangladesh neanderthal gene increases likelihood get severe COVID. poor country is, there's way adequately treat people. think it’s anti-USA bias Reddit has. great institution allows criticize gets criticized, awful institutions Middle East handled worse get mention.

The USA actually 9th worst country relation COVID pandemic, following Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Peru, Chile, France — order deaths per capita.

And many articles seen listed countries? none. Nobody gives shit Sweden Belgium. USA new policy? doesn’t matter is. Shit display anti-USA bias.

You peddling USA handling worst country want make Trump look like bad evil incompetent dictator literally worse Hitler. Completely irrational. comes back politics.

That’s think is.  give special snowflake test make pay for. Found [English data   No, would fight it. mean cost government tens thousands dollars. Cant squeeze water stone doesn’t make sense. US 4.2 million confirmed infected population 330 million. means 100 names phone book max 2 persons infected died. Europe random shootings idiotic reasons... firearms strictly proihibited. 

No ordinary joe assault rifle car. random bully colt pants.

A safer society possible, USA decided it. ""ordinary joe"" gets mad assault rifle instead punching someone kills gets killed.  article joke? mean that's opinion likely imported one many carriers returned city abroad crew members flights ships. That's experts Hong Kong think, I'll go thier opinion. Depends agenda reporter/country. agree numbers pumped unconfirmed corona cases can’t deny numbers also hidden places low figure would benefit them. Would support government started rolling tanks levelling protesters? Online protectors operate basis security high enough make risk cheating much risk lowly reward single college exam.

However ACTs reward would outweigh risk. good let's keep way. hard tell drunk going become drunk driver till put keys ignition. 
I love guns think every mentally healthy person trained know use one, one home properly stored like fire extinguisher. 
Problem US clue wack jobs guns, theres bunch morons without livk training handling weapons like two lawyer idiots waving guns non violent protesters. 
Its shit like idiot taking lethal problem solving tool non emergency situation. lumps gun owners morons rest us deal nonsensical laws. 

I thinm US needs kind mental health screening guns, maybe graduated system level gun get. First year bolt action pump shotguns. graduate training record safe ownership semi auto rifles low capacity magazines on. Happy trolling. Trump shit.   None guns ever killed anyone actually believe shit? Yes wish luck that. Hopefully, spread that. saw Fear Walking Dead... doesn’t go well... threw hands last week. told someone they're going wear one, please throw tantrum asked leave, take employees.

First rule business return customers Wow 21% vat tax everything wonder strongly enforced still see (mostly expats) refusing wear masks. Frankly hope get spanked 5k fine. counted three expats supermarket yesterday wearing nothing faces smug shit-eating grin. cannot 50 million. Given number asymptomatic cases ten times number total cases, number symptomatic cases top 30 million, give take. these, 5-10% die, that's somewhere 1.5 3 million. Exactly. swear Reddit problem people happy basically three days week, right? btw, work night shifts, that's different story, understand different. course easier time haha, one argues that.
During week, wake 5am usually work 6:00-6:30 come home 4:00-4:30pm already groceries (it takes like 15 minutes shop, usually buy consume similar diet shop every day, shop free things). go bed around 9pm. still five hours time. Cooking takes 30 minutes, listening podcast audio book. Exercising 30 minutes, depends tired 30 minutes done yoga, energy normal sport least bike hour. also exercise morning 15 minutes every single day, first thing morning. think violent crimes cant stopped completely, tighten laws little run regula check ups see person still fit gun even car.

Because end day want violent deed plenty things use Guns, Cars explosive small part want get hands illegal weapon. data available number healthy people underlying issues dying COVID? one armed nobody would injured go hospital. concealed carry world consider ***good sequence events.*** causalities low, fatalities guy gets away life ""Lone wolf"" ""Totally acted accord"" ""Mentally unsound"" justify everyone able deadly weapon *they* snap *they* open fire innocent people.

In nation would gone car drove home, pissed. That'd end it. Even wanted hurt bar would rammed front which, look bar, would hurt CAR would hurt people. dude's anger turned nonlethal scenario one literally millions lethal scenarios *just cause* gun available, that's it. healthcare professionals big scare. 


And ""whopping 63 cases"" due immense amount footwork credit effort put - like we're seeing albeit response even better. Numbers typically lower weekends yes, US delaying stopped reporting cases  plaguing brain. I'm sharing room younger brother currently. gets shit school I'm unable distance. I'm pretty much fucked. 

My heads feels like gonna explode. sure avoid fucking virus. I'm Florida, fucking nobody taking shit seriously. 

I'll probably fine. I'm not? money. I'd like avoid death good longer.

Fuck gues. gonna wear mask much can. [Sweden course took. also criticizing [Sweden's well, course also easy picking positive ones praising ""unusual"" course action. 

The countries want learn South Korea, New Zealand Taiwan, necessarily Sweden. Corona **not** every 10,000 people, 5 6 died course 5 months. vast majority final stage price flooded hospitals. bodies street. Spanish - Norwegian Institute Public Health says locked down.

Sweden also way deaths comparable neighbors. Norway roughly half neighbor's population reported 580 237 deaths, comparison aforementioned 4,468 Sweden. 

Sweden failed properly protect vulnerable people comments like saying ""oh expendable anyways, would've died soon anways"". Imo that's inhuman also attempt cover mistakes done. deaths ""inevitable"", died elderly dying corona particularly nice way go either. 


Side note, always think remarkable people throw together Sweden countries like Italy Spain hit right beginning far less time prepare. countries hit later could've learned mistakes countries hit earlier. counts inside EU global stage, European countries could've learned Asian countries well, that's different topic. Spain choice complete lockdown people even allowed take walks. numbers indiscriminately get compared ones Sweden people saying ""look poorly Spain acting"". ridiculous. Read properly. assume everybody gets antibodies infected expect see know seropositivity rates many parts world much lower we’d expect assume epidemic passed people resistant. take simple scenario everyone susceptible, you’d expect 60-70% marker exposure. what’s observed. 

BUT assume people T-cell immunity, many researchs show, would see that.

I put post show T-cell immunity seems likely virus likely much milder think. heard invented handjob. mean deaths? nearing 80k cases day White House took reporting. Covid19 came bats....... 

Stares China article COVID positive tests, deaths. would helpful read source ""*The average number coronavirus infections rose 278.9 per day July 17 23, according Sciensano Institute Public Health dashboard data update Monday. represents 71% increase previous week, Sciensano says.* "" Get out. LGBTQ conservatives, day, requires MAJOR amount willful ignorance. 

Like, semi-comatose. ProtoctorU works majority tests much lower stakes ACT. risk cheating outweighs reward well.

However ACT case, people cheat ACT done person. Considering ACT get free ride, it'll done. America isn’t sending death numbers World Health Org anymore, assume withholding numbers lying  mean another Dem level ""White guys take storm state capital simply power actually trying keep alive safe, met resistance."" people wonder *why* think nobody trained constantly checked make **sure** still gun possession one. Comparing car accidents virus??? trollin?  Treatments getting better, would set over-under 200k November. unlikely cop would suspended pepper spraying someone attacking them. However, matter high low standard- employee held STUPID standard. anyone would nuts continue confronting maskless idiots knowing can't even defend themselves. Since i'm US citizen tell US handle laws restriction, want country relax laws tiny little bit. comments up:""It reported Wuhan tests cost $10USD per capita I'm sure they've managed bring costs down. costs $5USD per capita now, testing 6M people would cost $30M pittance compared billions dollars lost productivity active outbreak would cause.""

What? problem solving. many people bar, thinning numbers. mean there's lot reasons assume they're lying though. president made clear wants make bad news go away hindering CDC getting publishing accurate information. There's countless accounts medical staff inside hospitals detailing horrid, illegal conditions threatened say anything. There's refrigerated trucks hospitals multiple cities now. happen 56 additional deaths day state 30 million. hundreds people dying every day we're getting told dozens barely 100 bad days.

Legit DALLAS, HOME SPORTS, BEER, NRA THINK GONNA HAPPEN. speaking protests? tourists allowed since March 27 entire country got locked down. However, initial infections began wealthier, mostly white communities linked tourism business travel.

Every infection Americas year *solely* airplane flights. 

The virus swim around world. flew. Stop selfish trying optimize personal safety convenience. We're making worse travelling. beat virus understand wants us do, opposite. Collectively. Locally. virus loves stupid humans flying 4free.

People flying around literally virus spread globally. Americans exporting virus world, like imported China winter. stop. 

It's plane. you. trillions trillions copies live virus one human body that's infected. Even asymptomatic. know sick people fly, do. 

You also think lives people clean planes. clean themselves. Essential worker mean, oh ignore people die cares.

Pick one two scenarios:

1*2^4th / 28d

1*3^10th / 30d 

1 you. me. anyone plane airport working retarded newsagents tchotchke shop. literally can't know already contagious, symptomatic. may never show symptoms tested, spread virus. That's trivially easy. 

2 doubling. 

3 tripling. takes 50% less social distancing 2. Flying pandemic opposite social distancing. is. Sorry pal.

^4th /28 days weekly periodicity. That's staying home much can. Like, go outside life danger. That's people do, super hard. that's edge case. reference point min transmission.

^10th /30 days 72 hour periodicity. That's moving around unnecessary stuff. Like flying planes absent real emergency. 

Does travel safe lives? not, takes them.

In weekly doubling scenario, 31 people get infected nobody dies. month. 

In 72h tripling scenario, 80,000 people get infected hundreds die. 

You check math. Exponential is. 50% improvement transmission rate 50% improvement periodicity saves huge number lives. attitude doesn't. 

Ethics, flyers. FFS Sources? shoot virus? US low paid employees usually need least 2 jobs theyre exhausted end want something quick eat sleep starting again. terrible vicious cycle. fell trap need head work 6am without barely sleeping suddenly breakfast burger doesnt sound bad. also connection stress, sleep hunger. 
Thank goodness got that. I've saying awhile presentations COVID19 remind mono. 
And God mono sucked bad. fantastic place visit. You’re lucky. windows kids elementary school. block, indoor rooms. Sources? Well, shutdown March good start. problem NOTHING following three months. supposed preparing reopen. Making plan, open slowly monitor results opening further. Educate population. no. went quarantine, twiddled thumbs three months, came bored, damn consequences. fan *entirely unaware* curated space is. know often mods ban smallest dissent. really think monopoly marketplace ideas, downvoted /r/politics worst thing happen them.

Some states like Mississippi vaccination rate 99.7% can't go school vaccinated

Others much crappier adherence. state I'm in, Pennsylvania, 15% kindergartners missing required vaccinations show school information freely available soviet russia become information; silly americans. Well they're definitely nuts anyways. Agreed. Obese American singer comes mind one expected celebrate group 5-6 people conversation, they'd spaced 6+ ft other?

it's like cruel joke me, played everyone around getting paid double nothing, I'm torn ""Every month fall, government-funded COVID-19 Prevention Network roll new study leading candidate — one 30,000 newly recruited volunteers.""

In August Oxford vaccine candidate. Moderna one. Gulag. Nope chimpanzees bonobos closest relatives extinct probably right. hard habit learn. next paragraph explains one flaws logic. apparently hit everything shooter fled police arrived, remains at-large.

So there's justice (yet) armed drunk people bar make situation better. may even made worse.  trust police there? UK police even carry guns... sourced 1 keep HOME anything ever happens. Criminals guns anyways, can't? Nah mate. could people want tell police that's known disappear protesters exactly been.


A government can't trust + pandemic can't stopped without vaccine really bad combination. Funny reopen people say word corporations keeping 43% American workforce home things control people turned away may anti-maskers. 

This first time anti-maskers reacted violently. even first shooting.

I seen many ant-imaskers already angry. Evacuating? sure thats good idea. Although appreciate dedication. still hope now, 21st century, better tools allow us create detailed documentation best practices 'sent' future generations.

It’s almost like gun-obsessed culture, solve problems guns, think everyone guns, defend guns bad guys guns is....unhealthy society whole. 

Odd thought. Oh dang! guess trump send secret police Texas. must complicated endeavor first world country could possibly pull off!  Testing is. mentally healthy person

*Cries*

If pandemic taught anything, Americans mentally ill, undereducated. short story. telling long evac, mention destination plans away? USA ""I sent pandemic playbook, read it. sent impeachment, convict. sent Dr. Fauci, vilified him. chose fate."" think need articles posted this. dude 8th day sick, stuck one room, completely isolated.

www.usgs.gov/faqs/did-people-and-dinosaurs-live-same-time?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products I'm proud admit locked doors house since bought 5 years ago. seems enough data conclude vast majority people mild cases resolve issue, many asymptomatic.

Damn big business got 3 trillion dollar bailout people salty poor people getting couple thousand. going skydiving first time, getting ready jump plane, instructor tells every thousand customers jump plane, three regular chute backup chute fail. hit ground terminal velocity there's much left scrape up.

How would feel jumping plane? It’ll get posted it’s confirmed shooter black. people unemployment going get 1200 too?

Dude allowed public ever There’s much wrong comment.

15mins long time? US, police obligation save protect you, situation calling scary they’ll sit around till back comes figure help you, maybe. missing bigger picture. Giving stimulus people meant ""stimulate economy"". give everyone X income money immediately reintroduced economy go make purchases it. That's want money.

Phase 3 test coronavirus vaccine candidate begins US
An investigational vaccine developed drugmaker Moderna National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases began Phase 3 trials Monday, becoming first candidate reach step testing.

About 30,000 adult volunteers set enrolled trial, according CNN, added first patient dosed site Savannah, Ga. trial group receive two 100 microgram injections candidate control group receiving placebo, four weeks apart, network noted.


""We pleased started Phase 3 COVE study,"" Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said statement. ""We grateful efforts many inside outside company get us important milestone. indebted participants investigators begin work COVE study itself. look forward trial demonstrating potential vaccine prevent COVID-19, defeat pandemic.""

According data published New England Journal Medicine, earlier testing induced immune responses volunteers. Mild side effects included chills, headaches, muscle pain fatigue vaccine generally safe.

Several drug manufacturers, including Moderna, receiving support federal government Operation Warp Speed program, company announcing Sunday Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority provided $472 million Phase 3 study later development, total $955 million thus far.

The World Health Organization lists 25 potential vaccines clinical trials worldwide. Phase 1 trials usually analyzes whether drug induces immune response small number people, Phase 2 trial expands study people characteristics similar intended vaccine recipients. Phase 3 trials typically involve thousands subjects tests safety efficacy. Catch idiots inject covid-19 virus them. He's looking lot better.

I think shows good leadership. I'm sure quickly dismissed. far fight media demonizing masks pro-sanity measures since beginning this. guy thought OK political psychology, I'm ok calling terrorism. We'd know bit could make call. That’s necessarily true all. need be, depending system, jet would private. make copy it? 

I'm stealing either way. that's great. never forget first conversations held school staff covid shit started going ""what state tests???"" 

Like fuck priorities. lost everybody large groups. hard find people large groups. confirm. 100% mean usually adrenalin gives quite boost sprinting. yea impossible run, basically cornered fight de-escalation impossible. extreme partisanship, though, also tiny loud minority. vast majority people want normal president like Obama (not biden trump), people think agree policy level. It’s Reddit teenage anarchists gun toting mags diehards make seem like everyone split “teams”. majority young country, too, centrist. 

I whole heartedly agree “messages” important, setting tempo country. again, people don’t take trump presidency seriously. disagree word. media like fanning flame says US burning down, crumbling shitty metaphorical infrastructure, truth closer middle. vested interest stoking much flames possibly making trump look bad possible. 

To take look control obesity

Canada extremely similar boat. Doesn’t take away problem US, global problem US. Furthermore, it’s localized issue US. state obesity rate par France, Italy, etc. region well. US huge diverse country, take issues exist hundreds miles away applying whole country disingenuous. lack education

This hard measure, I’m inclined disagree. 34% Americans 4 year college degree compared 33% Canadians. Obviously higher education isn’t guarantee “being educated” it’s good metric nonetheless. standardized measures like math science literacy yield similar results countries. Similarly obesity issue, too, certain states bring regions states like mine ton. Compare region Canada tilts completely direction. wouldn't, illegal weapons even bigger problem legal once. would like US laws similar parts Europe. issue US gun control people fail realize efficacy laws they’re making. can’t ban something 11 million people easily. country culture resistance exists it’s damn near impossible institute law. best way forward concessive purchase restrictions. Licensing purchase? Great! gun control lobby deregulate full auto, SBS/SBR, suppressors level everything else. Training requirements, background checks, classes? Great! since need standardize laws nationally, make CCW national? There’s ways use carrot coax progress. make people safe simultaneously letting want feels bit unfair judge I’m quarantined decent sized house husband kids, driving crazy. still go work, financially stable. can’t imagine jobless stuck inside horrible roommates. day day life comfortable, I’m sacrificing personal comfort like many people are. I’m homebody. Absolutely disgusting. Every (edit: unemployed) person Canada getting$2000 month entire time. know what? problems infections people feel like livelyhoods families threatened.

Edit: wrong. $2000 unemployed, everyone. TIL.  meme die already? 20% NY’s covid deaths nursing homes. national average 42%. states 75% deaths nursing homes. Smart move Google Source? Also, America world. 
Edit: found it, talking certain areas, also distinctly estimation. suspect type people take international holidays pandemic tend self-centred end spectrum, surprising also think quarantine them. move safer country child? Immigrants quite common Germany. we're (and ""we"" mean basically modern Western culture) meritocracy, we're bureaucracy. smart, skilled, effective get ahead power. certainly keeps there. people charge brightest best, they're ones learned work system best. Even care public good, necessary talent act best interest, humility listen actual skilled experts do. Yayy?

It keeps happening either care, they're exact right kind stupid thinks smarter came before, ""don't worry, *we'll* right others failed."" No, won't. badly worse... suffer result. Sometimes loose sometimes others win. someone making 40k one priciest cities America started good chunk cash bank, it’d pathetic make 6 figures 10s thousands bank. okay; God's time go anyways. Bunch fucking delusional people incompetent genetics. Good morning too! French I'd also like guns one day. Tell catch virus people fucked head.  did. Victoria days 0 cases we’re back 400+ daily well educated opinion topic think good move. obviously need world health organization ever. crooked one shades numbers came statement saying big deal contagious. 

Money rules almost everything. Cut US funding straightens (and quick they're losing millions millions dollars). 

In meantime US spend dollars towards research treatment hopefully able find vaccine share world sooner later. way treat make vaccines flu. Much still unknown Coronavirus. Someone inform Lorax and/or Treebeard! Thank you, really appreciate Moderna Oxford AZ vaccines require 2 shots - US alone going need 600 million doses. Here’s thing, it’s exposed work, people exposing kinds situations nothing office, number one way supposedly virus spreading people spreading within households, family members going working world coming contact people don’t know coming home spreading whole family. assume families safe know times, don’t think spread amongst family. simple commute could expose virus, passing someone street, close conversation 30 seconds UPS man, possibilities endless, may never office protocol safety, it’s called life protocol safety. take responsibility bodies times everywhere go every way now.  Serious question: China’s numbers get flagged reporting too? Closest thing.. [Living next ""KY Jelly is. Cool read research subject. mean, one biggest differences incubation period. 

You Covid two weeks longer unwittingly spread people. flu doesn’t work like that. Mostly get fever stay home feel better. Also plenty people get flu shots, shouldn’t downplayed.  Impressive jab! good old superstition religion activate crazy behavior banner ""God's will"". shocked Pikachu face dumb people... -\_\_-

I would say: “so you’re telling ignore lion that’s eat us it’s pack wolves really need worry about?”

This something absolutely respect. think valid opinion guns currently needed. agree it, makes sense.

The big question is: reached point, would want get rid guns? 

If achieved full parity Germany terms violence, home invasion rates, injury, etc., would think guns longer necessary restricted? Maybe looked would realise even Germany's crime rate high, set stone. maybe think get quite reform reasonable. actual details important, underlying question is. 

I think crucial question: point ""personal protection"" argument longer applies? 

Because is, that's something quantify find ways work towards. isn't, pointless discuss issue feeling safe (enough), control said safety. 

Both perfectly valid opinions think one clear it. Hopefully long jail sentence related felony record. Yeah, last point really doesn’t match others.

There shortage anything UK whatsoever Covid. People selfishly bought stockpiled totally unnecessary quantiles due unsubstantiated fear mongering shortages.

we california 2 months, things went back again. Software Development Companies trying nearly 40 years. work various reasons including timezone making difficult coordinate, language/culture barrier even Indians speak English, extremely hard enforce quality control, lack accountability, etc. Outsourcing India countries outsourcing faceless black box gambling level work get it. outsourcing first world countries might actually work (for example Canada) heard tried much since much expensive. hate people say things like, ""why everybody stay safe? I'm getting food DeliveryServiceX shopping ShoppingServiceX risk all!""

That's still net benefit everyone. One person shopping 10 families still better 10 people shopping 10 families. fewer bodies store, long tip well, person likely economic resources available.

Honestly, grocery stores converted curbside/delivery only. would made workers MUCH safer. guys got WWII? get Great Depression that’s really it. I've making sure tip carry orders. $5 might much, something. Giving private data “greater good” slippery slope, that’s I’m gonna say. selfish, low-class kind attitude. Usually children think way. Grownups take responsibility welfare group well risk themselves.  talking part world dealt SARS outbreaks like past two decades. already playbooks deal wearing masks sanitizing normalized. Heyyy little guy. Everything okay? Single family home inventory low. Nobody wants move house due uncertainty. Demand same, low supply. everything already worked before. Boo hoo. I'm hotspot I've quarantined since March. I'm also missing graduation, provider lost job.

Guess what? Still shit better life I've living. know why? Europe, there's end sight. Florida? getting started there's suffering horizon. might feel like marginally better.

People short-sighted they're willing kill others even endanger it. like they've learned nothing.

False: anything mouth saying anything wear mask. 



TLDR: Wear damned mask. made up, actual, health reason to. worse nothing. don’t even want think pandemic play stays power What's plan? Idk can’t this. I’ve working home since March. pay 1.5k rent LA every month, I’ve living northern Cali near family I’ve missed. want get rid apartment company refuses break silence return date. They’ve tried get us return three times government won’t let re-open. 

Most companies saying “We don’t know we’ll re-open work home x date sure.” Ive straight wasted 6k rent far like common cold decided disappear. public place plenty less menacing possibilities too. Try panic, anxiety plenty damage own. novel virus...no one knows. Asymptomatic spreading common.

Going college profound effect person reasons. definitely classes took. great bad trade second it. I'm really sad hear kids going get experience that. 

We really lost sight important things whole situation become polarized. I'm pro-mask, get wrong, stuff people saying driving crazy. Adults feel personally threatened people call glaring grammar mistakes.

It's open forum every right call errors like continue so. hope others well. think men Mars controlling us making us things like fart 1st dates, talk eating obnoxious assholes refusing wear mask.

I'd still love see that's like while. Unfortunately..the dirty truth is...unless luck (by island culture always resistant culturally/biologically(?) resistant), dirty truth pandemics always win. Prior invention vaccines, pandemic .5 death rate pretty much meant .5 population would. cold cynical is, that’s natural process.

Nations centralized effective lockdowns bring infections, always fighting equilibrium herd resistance met. Covid19 silent, contagious. I’ve always said don’t mind working....but it’s awfully frustrating paid less work people nothing. Much could mitigated received better emergency response plan White House, basically amounted ""here's money, COVID fake, get back work.""

- Grocery stores completely converted curbside/delivery. employees converted ""pickers"". would limited number bodies stores, stopping spread keeping workers safer. Charge $5 pickup / $10 delivery (plus optional tip), put 80% workers' pockets / 20% funding technology.

- Restaurants closed dine-in immediately, guidance federal level given considered ""safe"". Restaurants could easily converted ""ready bake home"" curbside pickup (some exactly this). Wait staff could converted either prep delivery. Charge delivery fee goes directly workers.

- essential workers, giving strong guidance distancing, providing funding PPE, know...not making fun people wearing masks White House press meetings would great.

All basically boils total lack responsibility White House, either due incompetence (less likely), selfish ambitions 2020 elections (possible) direction Russia cause chaos confusion (seems increasingly likely). turns out, elections indeed consequences, ones 2016 drastically altered US's course history. remember getting past Reconstruction. always amazed large portion textbooks never got to.

That's true, zoning laws equal. cities much stricter zoning laws “normal state” supply demand growing proportionately, increase demand short-term even seemingly small 5-10% (which sounds minor) that’s enough swing prices.

That's kind point person making. demand goes supply cant (due zoning regulations), prices increase. Zoning regulations preventing supply growing meet demand. Foreign investment impact price, zoning restrictions root cause much larger impact real estates prices. Additionally, loosening zoning laws would also cause less investment properties areas, prices increasing anywhere near current pace. everyone follows order.  I'm that. companies rushing amongst first push vaccine public. I'm sitting sidelines well better studies. I'm sure lot hardware people cannot work home.

There's good chance folks labeled essential able continue working on-site. That's case industry least: send everyone home WFH, keep skeleton crew ""mission critical"" employees excepted continue work simply can't done offsite. Pharmacies hiring extra help fall now. Get used headline unless go FULL LOCKDOWN, ideally 1-2 years. unlikely vaccine developed get used new normal. don’t it. Obviously. it’s easy. we’ve gotten lazy spoiled.

However irresponsible media inflate figures create panic.

Here actual facts come terms with:

1. probably going get COVID-19 point, 
2. almost certainly going survive it, 
3. might well give someone else.

Thus, last three months, I’ve operating assumption year-round virus that’s eventually going infect 100 million people kill roughly 1/2 one percent infected, conservatively. I’ve accepted numbers. Unfortunately, millions others not. Many people sense headed, understand why. They've betrayed hysterical media insists covering new reported case first case. Every headline today drips dread, next doomed hotspot approaches next ""grim milestone."" so, lot people paralyzed rising numbers numbers context. know end.

Accepting FACTS rejecting media hype allowed get life better understanding risks really are.  Yep, sure think hide outbreak. Deaths rise already know pneumonia deaths much higher previous years. Aside masks, didn’t get top months Ehh, there's lot sitting around dugout together. Ha, seems make sense then. Hope family members happier new employer. :-) Remember people tried fight back, narrative ""oh gee, stoop level! punch nazis, throw milkshakes nazis, that's really bad :(""

we need make nazis feel afraid front teeth. cases like would fucking hilarious go Supreme Court. It’s already decided dumbass! thing 🤷‍♂️ think word looking strawman, scarecrow.

But primarily responding part said life meaning. gotta give meaning. shit permanent, know everyone hemming hawing - fucking thing, go back 'normal' degree.

Acting like permanent arguing humans made bit strawman argument. Pretending I'm speaking permanent disingenuous. Humans may evolved social contact, SHORT TERM isolation (but dragged people cry evolved isolation) turning longer term people can't handle it. Sad, really. Man, A's grand-slam walk-off Angels soooo wonderful. 

Goodbye, MLB, I'll miss you. thinly veiled racism fooling anyone sub Eh. EIDL PPP they're gonna asked prove back end.

Don't get fooled low count today. pathetic...isn't it?  makes sense COL adjustments. Agreed, think even vaccine, social distancing, hygiene masking still around long time after. single digit cases day good amount us vaccinated problem term food desert become meaningless buzzword. example, live food desert according definition. there's three massive grocery stories 3 mile radius. 

I car, beater, enables get there. also sometimes bike grocery store. there's bus access. Yet, still considered food desert. find hard believe even poorest neighborhoods town, access least friend take car. live poor neighborhood. Every house car! may shitty car, car. 

All reeks infantilizing disadvantaged me. Stop telling people they're powerless become obese socioeconomic factors food deserts. Instead, educate make healthy meals cheaply, easily possible. Basically inject bit RNA body, case RNA would contain code build section virus (usually spike protein) instead whole virus, body builds immune system start targeting hopefully gain immunity real thing.

So ways similar recombinant spike protein subunit vaccine, except instead brewing subunit outside body get body make own.

The pro safe, chance danger 3rd party, developed much quicker type vaccine (as evidenced case, mRNA vaccine first enter phase 3 trial US).

The con success fail depend heavily accuracy genome sequence used create vaccine, fact there's decent chance straight work. Basically closer antigen introduce real virus, likely immunity vaccine generate actually gives protection virus. That's live attenuated virus vaccine usually effective providing protection, almost exactly real deal. endure brexit uk 3 years wish governments would keep mouths shut promise things dont know deliver People gonna ignore additional stay home orders. realistic measures shutting bars indoor restaurants, mandating mask usage public actually enforcing mask rules. Yup, too. Fauci correctly conservative (doesn't want give false hope). remisidivir studies ended early due showing early clear convincing data efficacy.

I expect early data pretty clear phase 3 mid way in. time symptoms \*can\* go 14 days, showing symptoms 5 days. Spread among population areas started high, immediately start giving data, couple weeks in, numbers grow time goes get clear.

We're a;ready scaling manufacturing hundreds millions doses, hopefully trials go well, see good early conclusive data start distributing October. love this. walking dead looks bad can't imagine watching Correction

It's impossible identify trash thrown environment consumers, impossible trace plethora companies responsible producing, selling, safely disposing said waste.

Also, online consumption service comes massive financial ecological cost. Yet externalised costs receiving daily/weekly update push notification _that may even read_, borne us.

Because there's zero proof long lasting immunity even possible virus. [good [bad still nothing solid. Even person's immune response long lasting, there's still question robust (how well protect differing strains). virus still new, know [other encouraging. protection robust enough, last long enough might ever able reach herd immunity. 

personally, suspect likely immunity possible although may last months year, may effective strains. mind end needing annual vaccine like flu shot. confirmation form solid science answers questions relate SARS-CoV-2 would extremely irresponsible allow virus spread like wildfire needlessly allow people get sick and/or die hoping something might even possible. Especially longer people put getting infected time learn virus, lower risk severe cases, best treat it. one answers me... ( cries introvert) got bored it. can't fathom collateral suffering we'll see hospitals need turn people away things even related pandemic.

Most powerful economy world? *this* fragile. sheriff mark lamb refused enforce covid lockdown measures Arizona tested positive it.... news never reported anything since knowledge... ok? wearing mask work out. I’m already huffing puffing cardio is. I’m putting membership hold working home. Sure is. could stop music things safe OK, wtf going Twitter hydroxychloroquine. absolutely flooded nonsense Maybe difficult understand since agree come back said government tries force something want do. blows mind much people bend knee simply government said so. Cowards. interesting idea surface absolutely terrible idea practice. One reason countries like US much population falls risk categories. found US population Google:

Children: 23% (okay low risk virus, parent allow kid intentionally infected?)

Elderly: 15% 65 older

Obesity: 40% adults currently obese

That already leaves 37% population classified eligible intentional infection. It’s harder calculate risks like heart disease, diabetes, hypertension may overlap age weight, point isn’t exhaustive list vulnerable virus. taken together risks simply enough immunity full protection settings like nursing homes remain quite vulnerable.

Then issue would put millions people couple weeks. idea home limits pool people immunize plenty low-risk people live others higher risk (like me). may needed help older relatives sometimes (again like grandmother can’t drive due hip replacement).

Then issue who’s enforcing this. far I’m aware government can’t legally expose people illness non-zero risk death for. would liability work? hard time buying enough people would go willingly reason anti-vaxers exist (some people care themselves/their kid). idea let happen naturally bars parties happening outside controlled environment likelihood lead infections high-risk people seen nursing home outbreaks increasing states like Texas Florida, albeit quickly infections general population.

All madness could worn masks kept basic social distancing protocols months prevented lot infections. 

And make assumption vaccine better treatment coming? Treatments already improved it’s unlikely improve soon. It’s possible vaccine won’t come within year, lot scientists think may well one ready widespread use late fall winter. shouldn’t undergo crazy experiment like possibilities far better resolution right around corner exist. think strings attached vaccine incredibly naive, China business charity people dont NEED SPORTS lives.

Great News Yeah whatever.... bollocks u ask me. Playoff tv ratings going roof happened North Dakota? people think water boarded drowning, drink cloth mask.   good points. Larger population, logically follows would cases well. Also, considering California leading testing (I believe), makes sense would cases. understand Texas Florida cases. California constant state lockdown since March degree Texas Florida almost shut down. find absolutely shocking far cases California think gives shit accuracy statements, he'll hype regardless. called mask requirement forbidden entering certain stores. really need negative repercussions requirement. Shocking 3 months strain flu, antibodies blood; come contact strain again, 

Do source this? source found average, antibody titers peaked 6.8 weeks (95% credible interval: 6.0, 7.0) infection, estimated half-life 26.5 weeks (95% credible interval: 24.0, 29.0), decreased almost baseline antibody levels 12 months postinfection.

So Flu antibodies half-life 26.2 weeks. 3 months half even 1 half-life.

Which makes sense don’t catch strain flu twice scientists found antibodies SARS-CoV-2 half life 36 days makes sense get reinfected strain coronavirus throughout year.


Anyway source flu active antibodies every virus body defeated and/or vaccinated against, mean immune system providing protection viruses.

Sure also means reinfected transmit virus ramping antibodies. get seconds wave, still riding first. ever Target? Lol. pharmacy, cleaning products, home products, clothes, food, pet supplies.... So, companies sleazy charging people anyways. Watch basketball. handled right imo. ever heard “no shoes, shirt, service”? Jokes cus im wearing everything except pants

But answer question: probably don’t infect possibly kill people. 

I guess common sense common.  700 people 3700 sq ft. It’s like packed sardines. nothing worth endangering others over.

This argument falls apart, imo. grandma disagrees protesting worth endangerment life? protesters ultimately arbiters value face pandemic?

Thank you. follow Johns Hopkins data closely.

I aware, however, [that site](http://rdambrosia.com/staticpages/covid19/covid19-us-state-line-charts.aspx), looking something like (or creating exist). promise someone believes mask degree target demographic idiot world said scientific experts subject death threats. job must love seriously doubt field get laid. I'm fucking ashamed embarrassed fellow Americans. better . need straighten shit still can. shame. We've known awhile PCR tests miss 30-50% cases even people dying hospitals. also know miss 100% cases early true viral infections virus/antigen/antibody levels high enough detected. shows silliness taking risks assuming single test definitive. Ideally would tested negative, gone 14 day quarantine individually, 2 tests getting ship. 1918 flu also flu, ""just big flu""?

Don't understand people dumb, look death rate, closed case death rate 5%. really brings great joy call unemployment insurance benefits “welfare”, doesn’t it? long time coming opinion. say Hague don’t mean city, mean International Court Justice, part UN.

and naturally diverse viewpoints represented aside president Terry Crews starring president Terry Crews Homogeniety risk would important calculation.  small population lots similarly risky living conditions (prisons, cruise ships) would potential go far higher large, heterogenous city region. becoming increasingly clear must sacrifice economy save ourselves. Huh?? careful. disease afflicted .007% population Give week Trump block posting data sharing wait lawsuit get figured point declining case numbers.

🤷‍♀️ “The dog ate corona data” NYC nations biggest powder keg. believe Cuomo really waiting see happens fall. 

One person NYC easily brush past 1000 people day. Exponential growth virus month go 700 cases 10k+. 

I think people understand fast exponential growth is.

We went 3 million go 4 million cases less 3 weeks. bet hit 5 million half time. would draw line? friends agree disagree universal healthcare, validity BLM, capital gains tax, stuff like that. say treat old people corona open ICU beds, that's borderline. one guy says let rip it'll clear poor people like us affected, would want friend like that?  I’m sure speak everyone, experts Reddit greatest thing ever!

Wall Street needs blood lest millionaires portfolio takes dip. immediately made think Walking Dead. found virus already inside everyone. wrote state been. payed China unfortunately. Well aren’t treated tbh wouldn’t want put american umbrella

All irrelevant. Americans. Period. They're literally American citizens American passports. Canada 🙂 there's even option group democratic-run states versus republican run ones. Eye opening.

On cumulative cases per 1000, looks like states much worse mid July, R states taken slightly higher.  
 
For reason Americans seem make everything partisan, appears partisan issue.  
 
Both parties equally horrendous compared rest world. 
 
Here leader [Left wing political party telling people protest BLM.  
 
It hard take high road tell everyone socially distance regardless cause, Americans seem capable.  Everyone seems interested proving party right, side wrong.  Trump's obviously even worse, nobody taken high road America. get plane evening 30th birthday. safe then?

Of course LAX like SYD means even 30th birthday. yes technically accurate stick head sand, would ""pull pants up"" remove 🙃 There’s reason tweet everything.

Just look often complains Obama Golfing golfs 2.5 times much.

If isn’t jealousy it’s certainly form gaslighting that’s intentionally done right wing media well. they've gutted. Would enough say Western. Western, specifically American. US full non-white people ignore mask guidelines. understand it’s hard click around cheaply made site avoiding donation pop-ups, since link, would thought you’d looked data. Guess not.

I took screenshot excess mortality data referencing save that’s raw excess mortality, compared official Covid deaths expressed percentage, original link was.

But states also underreporting cases, whether data deficits due malice incompetence, don’t seem contribute observed decline death rates, observed similarly everywhere else. get treated like Americans. feel American. 

Nobody gives flying fuck feel. literally American. Find citizenship elsewhere renounce American citizenship want change that. it’s going fucking MLM moms take bait... hook, line, sinker. Florida. missing punchline Oh boy. even read sparknotes stimulus lol. Besides largest quantitive easing ever, preventing total collapse large companies, provided nearly 100% payroll paid federal government 3 months whatever. Also known as, almost every business paid 3 months despite 0 customers federal government paid thru “loan” doesnt paid back. Businesses would dropped snd right left genuine unemployment super high percent. PPP literally stimulus worker. Nearly 14K person. And, unlike obamas dumpster fire stimulus, companies werent allowed stock buy backs ceo bonuses. PLUS claims discrimination smaller businesses occured, entire thing got re-done reapplied.

Edit: might add QE didn’t take 2 years apply sfter entire economy collapsed, unlike obamas also known bidens lol 💯 

Literally many people calling jail people talking contact tracing also hold protestors shouldn’t help contact tracing. 

Cognitive dissonance beyond 9000. newly ""sick"" people higher viral load? Meds? facts general specific instance. legal investigation. legal issue. criminal accusation, would tried court law. claiming stole something, illegal criminal act. surrounding circumstances dictated legal precedence. 

We playing here. Saying someone stole $300m serious accusation better serious proof happened. provided enough legal case go forward clearly proof.

Why say it. opinion, based evidence access statements read believe guilty crime. really hard state opinion admit fact. really fucking easy say ""It belief opinion"" actual outcome investigation evidence side. absolutely entitled opinion can't go around making statements like factual. Yes, must frustrating. Canada, idea percentage is, way less 1/3. grocery store yesterday. line outside six feet apart masks, person metering people out. (Normally walk in). So, guy realize line up, walks entrance.......no mask. (I next). girl tells needs line first, also needs mask. says one, gives one says line up. told let go ahead me, worries. (It honest mistake, could tell). close altercation live. (I mean, might going beer.........it could important). lol course.

No wonder US trouble, someone surrogate take SAT him.  Clearly never yelled saying ""happy holidays"" instead Merry Christmas. fuck exactly think ""Spanish Flu"" was?? Same. Looking it. Also hurt send emails Ralphs corporate office show support her. Hope freedumb burger worth killing family member knows lifelong health issues already blame farts dog, really way. someone understood also happens homemade masks? mean masks made material surgical mask. live kind hard get pretty much everyone uses homemade masks agree! OP made distinction wanted go along identifying themselves! Yeah US fed documented forms education. Isn’t kombucha? forgot 3.

because wearing mask; complications viral loads reduced.

:) live? never go outside? totals going even rate goes down. makes perfect sense without conspiracy theories boot lickers. I’m optimistic obviously realistically it’s bit stretch things would go perfectly live cal act like know talking about. frankly exhausted Trump admin. Even think mercenary way possible, ending plague early best way economy. want devour money front them.

I understand greed. comprehend short sightedness. Frankly it’s hard feel happy unprecedented times. lot turmoil going on, see coming from.  Baseball really burying heads sand recent positive covid tests. watched cubs game today barely talked it. respect nba immediately shutting shit two Jazz players positive. MLB really messed implementing similar bubble environment probably lot harder cause larger roster sizes problems then, typically kids 10 rarely around parents siblings..../s really need add that. you? Basketball NHL essentially living bubble playing central locations. really cuts contact people could infected. MLB not. It’s basically movement (with guidelines games limited region country). There’s ways virus creep in. Americans clearly something Puerto Ricans

Puerto Ricans Americans. makes sense distinguish two.

Perhaps ""Puerto Ricans mainlanders"" works. one forcing people go there. clearly trump administration shunned helping past regards funding shit mainland americans bringing covid, think people PR good reason think they'll left dead like past. Sounds right. Short is, no, expect anything resembling normal 2020. experts saying vaccine could expect things start getting back normal summer next year. 2.8 million Americans die year causes. Imagine destroying American economy lives millions young people (who lost careers) death count year going 10%, vast majority mostly consisting 80 90 year olds. Great. Give ability vote. Try cheap trash, scum small business petite bourgeois tyrant.  phone video taken moments incident unfolded Ralphs 200 block South La Brea Avenue shows man sitting ground, surrounded milk.

that's get out. 

rinse milk. call Melburnians article. That's confusing. Goggles shield Agreed. greed that's driving push fully open kind control disgusting.

I miss sports too, worth people dying watch grown men play game better me. Ahh, see covid safe airplane analogy. Got it.  Negatives this? People allowed sad current state things. know you’re saying they’re shit pretty overwhelming, adding whatever someone’s personally dealing get this. Sometimes hard know there’s light end tunnel you’re stuck tunnel going 6 months. 

Very nice offer DM’s. You’re good person seeing good people helps happiness thank you. voted several times become state. Thats them.  Name doesn’t check out. people don’t identify such

It literally matter. Americans. would say Christmas like 75% chance happening way want. knows, nothing wrong little bit optimism. expect ever genuine LOL sub, What's growth hospitalizations? It'd extremely hard integrate many people country. New jobs would need created, new housing would need built, political landscape would shifted (that's huge new voting block). reasons, accepting many refugees (I'm talking general, region specific) really viable Canada nations. Lol think that’s gonna work chief Same. want mention guy, cant also bring guy too?

Otherwise optics, maybe pessimistic international politics. saying since March. normally get cold kind illness Spring sometimes Fall (I many allergy problems tbh), isolation, sick *at all*. We're one Russian Facebook campaign away burning witches again. I'm sure they're working YouTube conspiracy videos speak. Higher education tends lead lower population. Agreed. 

Anyone lies contact tracing POS, that's rapid increase cases march april. one Asian countries mask beginning slavery choice. insult slavery even compare them. frightening that, without curse disease, chances would lot better.We sorta lucked out, really. 


Y'know what, make **terrifying**. Paywall Employee suspended 5 days due following deescalation procedure. Baby Donnie wanna play more, took data went home. grew there. unbelievably depressing place. send emergency aid stop spouting lies Noooooooooo, reeeeeaaaaallllllllllyyyyyyy? Ya dont say. Well could've predicted that. Good, don’t come here. Okay. Protestors. Same. think became stronger team this. Probably think it’s hoax  Shame mask on. reduces nose throat irritation pepper spray. No, right. variety viruses take away smell taste, usually temporarily people permanently. seem much common covid viruses saying articles seem say. anecdotes extreme situations really need evidence say anything sure long term effects disease, rate occurs within people.

The reality get hung anecdotes bad things happen people get really unlucky. plane crash mean planes safe. going get quality learning virtually home either though unless already skilled learner involved parents. matte plan completely leaving massive segment population behind I’ve two flights, times whole aisle self. basically 6 open seats. don’t airlines compare southwest seem one best. Also masks required obv People inevitably focus 10 days rule, important bit 10 days *and fever 24 hours without fever reducing medication.*

So, still fever 10 days, continue self isolate 24 hours fever goes away own.

This advice similar approach UK, though applied different parameters there. I'm middle class suburbs Buffalo every store go 99.9% mask compliance since Cuomo started April. sure part 'upstate' assumes poor mask compliance Western NY. I’m kind jealous see chinese families going trips, restaurants visiting friends.  lot things still restrictions think still need wear mask indoors could point pushed concerted national effort. Instead, let virus spread. 

Parts Europe hit hard open business. countries like Taiwan Vietnam clamped early saw explosion. It’s proof means know control spread choose to. support still mostly blame government controller media distrust information. 
If media say factual truth people knew factual truth said continuous propaganda political benefits think lot people would take seriously. 
I consider conspiracy theorist &amp; 100% correct. I'm masks &amp; even type insane. folks largely politically motivated.

Edit: certainly try see conspiracy everything. I'm rational conspiracy theorist. Man you’ve got really low standards gods. r/leopardsatemyface yeah, I'd love go vacation somewhere. actually cut last vacation short even 1/3 way covid. 

but cannot count *other people* responsible. matter everything right - mask, hand sanitizer, shit. matters somebody else passing whether know it, care. 

I really think I'll entertain booking flight somewhere vaccine good portion people immunized. can't trust people around me. Ooh first time I've really seen phrase ""the times"" anything similar. Feels bad I’m saying you’re thinking people attitude towards pandemic showing clear lack empathy, typically comes brain time develop... BRUH Tell doctors working COVID patients. sure fascinated hear theory wearing masks help, seeing prevent infection. go fundme him? Hope attacker rots jail. Really?  skip torturing couple first place? 


There god, was, FIGHTING would moral course. I’m scientist, made sense start. get conflicting information masks, materials, effectiveness, everyone taught “cover mouth/nose” cough/sneeze, leap logic. (Except morons). advocate “harm reduction”. Australia 80% transmissions workplace - bars fun social places open Victoria.

I saw study found bars louder music likely spread people talk louder! Technically Puerto Rico territory US, Americans going country. Another intubated badly. Two new parents three went visit snuggle baby.

It's like plague Sarah Boynton point. One covid, alone, calls two friends phone, three vectors door, bring along another four, five carriers come mask-less... losers go beserk! totally sucks, glad know it’s friends awful. 😔 Article says 1 student wearing mask? instructor/test admin wearing one kept taking off. surprises here. wow, great, thank guys. Researchers work, write paper, make arrangements, taxpayer pays research. researchers give results free journals blocks access results behind massive paywall. idiotic beyond belief. Probably corruption involved got back wearing fanny packs year. crocs though. flip flops!!! think order dont stock right imagine everyone hugging coming going. Got hug uncle earl, even coughing head off.

“Kids, kiss uncle earl goodbye” “i perfectly reasonable sarcastic way.”

that’s direct contradiction. i’m gonna pull triggered card go you. ttyl Tom Cruise immune due human. He’s deity sort, least mind. Anti-maskers dying breed

We need wearing shirts let's honest here, ever since said switching reporting away CDC. knew story going play out. question multiple under-reporting by. Open 'er up! assure divide police public health, yes. However, without public trust, view method hard achieve. Oh agree, pretty defeated Biden started beating Bernie.

I take solace fact Biden’s recent platform pretty darn progressive. think public option instead Medicare terrible idea, things considered room real change. Carbon neutral 2035 also big surprise. think long competitive government health insurance start investing green jobs, 2024 good jump point better democratic candidate. think seatbelt analogy lost people? hammock wedged open car door seat drive away quickly afterwards Yep. Louisiana decided they're going publish covid-19 case death information weekends, want to. mean, US might worst, grammatically correct. think it’s OK lie people greater good?

Why lie greater good is... check southern Washington. checked [city, coronavirus, [cases/deaths]] level. America literally camps holding thousands people (including children). tone attempted insults triggers unpleasant. 

I perfectly reasonable sarcastic way. Claiming covid cancer blessings. rather get bless them. survive: cancer, chemo covid.

So delicate really? going many stories like sad preventable. going somewhere alright .. Actually spreading everywhere There’s simple idea like remind constantly: things _have been_ certain way doesn’t mean that’s way things _should be_. Habit, culture, tradition shitty reasons avoid improving things. Funny since China’s currently committing genocide. yes, trumps nazi It’s worst. bad it’s beautiful. phone beautiful people... beautiful, said it’s worst. Worst America ever seen... uge problems. It’s beautiful. hear time. Tremendous bad. almost like lot people lack imagination.

Maybe need movie famous people pay attention understand. OP English second language fiancee try pedantic possible learn something wrong. foreigners could good ^(Just thought) propaganda death toll. Chinese government force US absolutely nothing virus months? Without complete total inaction, virus couldn’t spread US. Wow realised bad is. Australia like 25 million people 600 total cases certain states full lockdown. crazy think going out. Must widespread longer stoppable. I've stood stance. live world claim accept fact that's court ruling?

That means believe journalism. gets approved government.  lint belly button tho. sayin'. Jeez thumbnail made think one blackface way light shining hair contrasted colour hands. Tourist season local contact. Good luck. time masks bottom called “second wave”. it’s small time game - little late. wide spread levels like distancing stay-at-home orders hope get control sort decent timeframe. go must masks go sir thing.

If NY over-relied masks stay-at-home orders stage epidemic would still riding wave. data testing probably took days, people covid days symptoms made get tested. numbers probably like happening Iowa two three weeks ago :( It’s seems time western / white countries introduce mandatory masking, already late. Better never toothpaste tube, missed largest benefit control outbreak already. Somehow forgot hit Sun Belt got hot. waited months without south seeing spike wanted really badly criticize wearing masks. “Forgetting” allowed us say “I told so” Elderly care homes: 1 - proportion deaths care facilities similar Nordic countries. Norway (50%) it’s even higher Sweden (45%). 

But gets fidgety consider scale numbers. Norway 255 deaths. 50% 125, could achieved handful breakouts seniors homes. country ""1"" death would easy ""100%"" deaths occurred seniors homes.

And illustrates something interesting. Canada, lockdown, also 82% 8,900 deaths seniors homes.

Italy locked also senior's nightmare. higher death rate Sweden.

So seems locking down, not, directly translate more, less, seniors dying. appear independent situations.

Seniors going bars beaches. fate determined policy decisions regarding seniors care, availability policies around PPE, number care staff, conditions seniors homes, Sweden hadn’t seen single death care facilities would still twice many deaths Nordic neighbours combined. 

So think bit disingenuous. Norway #70 death rate. Finland number #61.

That means countries beat dozens dozens countries locked similarly. countries even smaller countries. Armenia. Panama. Ireland.

So look say *why amazingly*? ""average cases"". strangely stellar examples.

Why didnt *Germany* well Norway Finland? didnt Estonia? knows? obviously complicated thing figure out. Maybe got lucky? certainly say least Finland Norway, Denmark, geographical position edge Europe might something it. 

Why *India* better Norway, Finland, Denmark? INDIA!?!? What's that, right?

(*India better Finland*! Let sink in.)

Why *no-lockdown Japan* much better no-lockdown Sweden?

Why Poland much better Germany?

Who say? Sometimes stuff doesnt seem make sense particular country gets hit particularly hard easy dont know yet.

Perhaps Sweden single super-mega-spreader casanova went around french kissing Sweden's care workers fucked everything them? knows?

But seems like whole thing kind sneakily misplaces burden proof.

If think shutting would given Sweden better outcome, *you* prove would happened. really question whether fewer people would died, think everybody acknowledges ""no-lockdown"" strategy means people might die, economy saved.

But would prove ""total outcome"" would better Sweden locked down. dont really see that. want point Denmark, I'll point Italy. point Norway, I'll point UK.

Maybe Sweden would locked made things *worse*? say?

In end, Sweden is. decision made. result COVID pretty much [done better outcome similarly-sized Michigan, *and* similarly-sized socialistic Quebec, locked down.

Sweden’s projected economic downturn (1% GDP) less Germany (6.5%), Netherlands (6.8%), EU whole (7.4%), Belgium (8%), France (8.2%), Croatia, (9.1%), Spain (9.4%), Italy (9.5%), Greece (9.7%) UK (up 14%). comparison, New Zealand government predicting downturn around 10%. total cost? 5 months, every 10,000 people, 5 6 died. last stage lives.

That price country pays saying ""fuck you"" Global Pandemic Century.

No flooded hospitals. bodies street. Spanish Flupocalypse.

That .. seem severe me.

Perhaps Sweden isnt ""flying success"" neighbours.

But considering beginning story ""If DONT shut hospitals FLOODED sick people! BODIES streets!"" ..

.. interesting pivoted ""If dont shut down, wont well Finland!"" anyones bit scared reading this, stuff like always happen. matters whether know clusters from, many people long took discover clusters. necessarily mean start second wave. nobody honor. He's right. may well exploitative, devaluing meanings slavery indentured servitude.

 large sum educational debt, law prevents filing bankruptcy clear loans. even 15-20 years graduating, repay loans can't prevent collection attempts. amount medical debt, could dissolved bankruptcy credit record could recovered now.

Bankruptcy bad word. legal protection can't afford pay owe. stops harassment (legally speaking, though may take awhile get calls stop) allows eventual recovery time. 
 
Lest seem optimistic system, leave one category screwed seniors lose assets bankruptcy income time build back up. causes issue also larger part expensive medical needs, Medicare programs beyond ability even begin cover, generally type insurance elderly pay much needed care certain age. Beyond medical assistance state poor disabled, state administers differently leading large differences income requirements options available.

Existing b systems offer ways solve problems, complicated written lawyers way ensure demand lawyers navigate them. wanted Olympic level mental gymnastics.  feel like wearing n95 Narrator: didn’t. dont think guy defending US's response. obviously really fucked up. medically speaking, understand treat critical covid patients better months ago. Figured. Thanks! think next year wash jumped cooperating contact tracers protestors. 

How Party article says contact tracers asking went protests directly,

Because politics 100%. think medical reason One that, know contact information everyone protest, telling immediately help them.

Um, 300 people come going protest, dont think info would help? wife epidemiologist. everyone else contact much valuable

Except protest tho, right? find keeping kids entertained, active, happy quite challenging right now. would far easier that. Tell about, still everything remotely... office slow hurts. wear damn mask Let guess, white people allowed everybody else sent away. Yes go back No, no, get tested 10 days :)

What hell going on? look 79. seriously needs file charges. Good hope wear mask next time!😷 Wait... blaming China anymore? 150 nation 350 million people.

To go see one doctor. find 151 more?

Then came claim America's best medical advisors consider ""earthly gods."" claim?

Or strange misbegotten point pay someone reason. Larry Kudlow said would way. He's finance people doctors.

Our country dire need doctors. pontificate.

Which suggested word ""expert"" stumbled read it. 

So understood then? administration ever shut need U.S. surpassed 4 million coronavirus cases Thursday, 150 prominent scientists, medical experts, teachers nurses signed open letter urging Trump administration legislators shut every state, county city U.S. version phased reopenings soaring numbers new COVID-19 infections, experts said political leaders need “shut now, start nations world, we’ve deaths COVID-19. time, we’re midst ‘reopening economy,’ exposing people coronavirus watching numbers cases — deaths — skyrocket,” experts, include researchers doctors Harvard, Stanford UC Berkeley, among many others, wrote.

It's clear push push push ""re-open"" mistake?

I remember, early on, Florida withheld COVID-19 case data public Friday make look like almost SARS-CoV-2 there.

Since then, Florida, led inept Governor Ron DeSantis, complete shit-show thousands people dying unnecessarily result corrupt government.

One member family killed actions incredibly selfish mean people.

Here many recent articles documenting corruption Florida's horrible  I’m US, I’m UAE. US lost chance even try control spread virus point isn’t even point testing anymore. r/fuckmasks r/conservatives r/conspiracy

Not really. thing Covid tell people something doesn’t seem safe never feel badly it. would harder sister, would probably still find way. Electromagnetic radiation UV spectrum ionizing radio waves not. Hence sunburns may lead cancer whereas putting radio near head, aiming flashlight yourself, give cancer.

And I'm means defending 5G conspiracy theory idiocy. pointing facts. okay allowed block road country? states obviously different mentione.d politically convenient so. No, deniers think poisoned actually disease paid say things. 

When someone reached position without use logic, amount logic change minds. parents tell hoax sniffles Again, got lot developing still apparently, kick empathy stat bit try risking others’ lives livelihoods BRUH Problem arguments don’t hold up. all. 

Elderly care homes: 
1 - proportion deaths care facilities similar Nordic countries. Norway (50%) it’s even higher Sweden (45%). 

2 - article link says there’s 1000 unnecessary deaths care facilities. Subtract Sweden still 8 times many deaths Norway Finland 4 times many Denmark adjusted population size. 

3 - Even Sweden hadn’t seen single death care facilities would still twice many deaths Nordic neighbors combined. 

While indeed huge scandal here, still doesn’t account exceptionally high death death toll. 


Swedes travel more:
1 - There’s data support this. Swedish authorities used explanation never shown kind evidence back claim. Neither anyone else. 

2 - Oslo Helsinki smaller Copenhagen big Stockholm anything connected rest Europe. Yet Stockholm seen 7-8 times deaths Copenhagen. 

3 - Even true would explain Sweden’s deaths went bit quickly others. doesn’t explain it’s going much slower. Even Italy Spain went much steeply despite much larger initial spread Sweden. 


Norwegian authorities “now says locked down.”:
1 - two months old: - measure actually mentions likely unnecessary closing schools kindergartens. 

3 - doesn’t say “they shouldn’t locked down”. says it’s *possible* could locked *less harshly*, think spread *already low way down*, though admits *very uncertain*. also says less harsh lockdown would *on condition* “there’s *commitment entire population* follow advice stop spread virus”. Remind get hot tub (or anyone) lol.

And sunlight air replaced salt ocean, 

Good analogy. paper nice short read shows attempt identify statistical significance factors IQ: Ok, REALISTICALLY, NYC well 3.2M cases, 400k. they've 32k deaths. 
 
This confirmed antibody tests indicating ~ 20% NYC infected. testing way, way better now. 
 
No doubt Florida fucking pay heavy price. unlikely surpass NY death toll, least several months. Given many decisions, handling wildfires deliberate clearing indigenous land, think clear case. Open windows, turn fan. fine. Also it’s like people suddenly stopped getting flu. It’s weird thing say, virus would stop say “oh flu? I’ll leave alone then”

'I thought political scam whole family got need money medical bills' mean, venn diagram people support/are cops people believe hoax almost circle. Plus, \*love\* making people can't breathe. ""A fan blowing would cause worse spread AC"" - true typical AC setups.

In typical USA closed air AC systems:

Unless multiple intakes around area, AC blows air around fan, takes hours actually filter air. many/most filters dont filter virus particles due systems rated thick Merv filters.

Having many windows open certainly reduces viral load buildup. strategic fans indoors close outside viral load perspective (minus benefit UV). Average home totally refresh outdoor air 10 20 minutes. 

USA Indoor restaurants typically arent setup either AC windows work. suppose could rig low densoty seating, fans, windows open try , lower seating density makes unprofitable. ask, know virus caused miscarriage? ever find out.

USA! USA! Yeah, took understand also. kinda points pneumonia deaths. 

So Flordia 108,000 deaths reporting period.

Of deaths 4,674 considered covid 19 deaths. 

But also 8,615 pneumonia deaths. 

And 11,283 influenza pneumonia deaths. 

So Florida's numbers could 4,675 11,283.

They 107% normal. agree you. Everything that's going US product severe case entitlement, privilege selfishness. crystal clear now. say I'm sorry situation? Karens hometown screeching people wearing masks. thing is, they'd need wear one 1/2 hour day, rules force people like wear one day, uncomfortable. Sorry. public option wouldn’t make healthcare universal, affordable even ""That dagnab hurr-ee-cane infringing mah rights.""

Same thing deaths apparently... reported many, I'm gonna round 39 4. I'm saying open utterly scientifically debunked nonsense like antivaxxery COVID-associated racism, ""no politics"" rule best way express this, especially - like - COVID fundamentally political issue places like US, whether given position ""political"" depends ask - policy come biased, inherently ambiguous. examples given sensible, feel there's better, less ambiguous way express existing policies - something along lines ""discuss COVID, specific individuals' responses"" or, succinctly, ""keep topic"".  think left right horrible view points times, also think two party system needs die. problem trying middle sides don’t take seriously, due mentality them, you’re them. citing Chinese numbers fake begin with, please watch videos post above. 40,000 ppl hot pot together matter indoor outdoor, tightly packed eating pot.

Voluntary quarantine would probably best, option quarantine beforehand. Again, chances get virus driving slim, need overdo it. delusional. witnesses say telling **repeatedly** rammed cart. Working retail grocery stores deal worse crap *accidental* bump cart, much her. flip side, know trying walk away get manager assaulted *repeatedly*?

- soccer team comprised incredibly fit athletes cardio length match. Football variety player types, wide receivers/defensive backs/running backs (lighter leaner, capable running field) way linemen (big, stout gentlemen fuck men up, weight ranges high 200s low 300s).
- Besides players, it’s also _coaches_ would need tested isolated. good number coaches older, physical shape, both. 40,000 ppl hot pot dinner outdoors, 21 times lower transmission rate indoors. Also time, there's like 700 total active cases entire wuhan. Chances transmission pretty low, exponential growth started yet. 

I'd agree 40,000 ppl hot pot dinner certainly help situation, probably made worse. think made much worse like suggesting. Death rate still likely increase two weeks, might flatten. Dalian locked down, residences close seafood plant entering closed management workers &amp; close contacts entering quarantine.

With outbreak, China becoming selective gets locked relying testing vs lockdowns suppress new cases. Nobody quite sure possible China test residents Wuhan China pulled off, infrastructure's place mass testing blitzes.

It reported Wuhan tests cost $10USD per capita I'm sure they've managed bring costs down. costs $5USD per capita now, testing 6M people would cost $30M pittance compared billions dollars lost productivity active outbreak would cause.

There's extremely cool testing strategies low prevalence. eg: test 1M people 2000 tests bucketing 1-1000, 1001 - 2000, 2001 - 3000 1 set tests (1001, 2001, 3001...), (1002, 2002, 3002), etc. another set tests. bucket 65,000 - 66,000 bucket (1,536, 2,536, 3,536) etc. test positive, patient 65,536 one buckets perform intensive testing them.

Listen educated specialists like scientists work actively them. constant backward movement beyond words. wrong dems issues too, pretty disingenuous say they're bad republicans last years. They're literally letting president stomp around breaking laws freely. need international audit lab.

Well, major media outlets claiming scenario basically racist conspiracy theory, certain red flags lead one suspect lab studying corona virus bats poor safety standards would source covid. Yep driving Oh they’ll get eventually Worldometer data collection also shows death rate U.S. declined every single day since April 12. Still high, hopeful. founding forefathers take bad actors consideration. passed ...

the virus others. supression begins! Notice cases deaths DRAMATICALLY dropped last days, last week high increase? Yeah like holy fuck media report something. Four months later don’t even know actually safe. hermit impression outside parties distance relatively safe. forgot hornets Starting wars hundreds thousands civilians died destabilizing Middle East pretty bad too. whole neo-libreal era really fantastic sure. account states different population sizes. waste time campaigning New England aim swing states like wisconsin Iowa. wont lie, I'm prepared immediately dismiss idea. could well true. Personally trust anyone maybe plays it, still. Here’s video car driving by, apartments dead bodies side modest receptacle? Anti-maskers/vaxers. idiots, different name. bother eligible public endangerment charges point. country dumb? think person's goal screw over, lot ways trials extended (keep requesting extra time &amp; rescheduling, etc). 

IANAL I've never sued, I've certainly heard lot stories people buried frivolous lawsuits drag years seem like real problem.  least make data show everything's seemingly control. nope decided provide all, guess that's really bad now. Can’t even imagine. Hopefully you’re better place now. Election 100 days! blame america's dependency reality t.v. fuck tards simple minded enough vote shock value reality star super spreader spread everyone else right thing? hope we're wrong well. 

But he's narcissistic sociopath desperate stay prison.

I completely agree understand got many downvotes. actually slapped someone situation general public would getting assault charge. That's beneficial effective would probably empower antimasker even more. data available open records laws, yes! country decline always shit. got rich. make good. country built slavery, racism, theft indigenous land explotation immigrants workers.

Our problems lie within gutting education system, 24 hour news without public option 2 party system - country never great. insanity prison system (i.e. new Jim crow), healthcare system, incredible power lobbyists help either - would argue symptom aforementioned issues.

Edit: people downvote without response cowards. whole problem, enough followers believers keep office. can’t believe impeachment didn’t pass senate. Physical distancing doesn’t work society humans function though. COVID vaccine it’ll go. Businesses can’t profit it, people can’t live normally etc. It’s intrusive everyday life  Even monitoring Melbourne. Like flu...but bad flu. made little sad yesterday noticed neighbors family get together 20-25 people. conditions like diabetes. masks etc.

I wondered noticed group one maybe would dead months time. hope hope wonderful neighbors happen. suppose thought outside would enough..but sitting close other. Kids circulating etc

Not Tx. Lmao straight CCP propaganda get exposed plenty things. saw documentary couple days ago mentioned huge number microorganisms we're exposed every day.

While know saying... evidence support it.

I don’t fucking believe it. We’re like percentage points (or less) different chimp.

- South Park Fire every single one them. 

What happened protect serve? Roman empire lasted 1000 years. ain't giving country yet TL;DR give 60 new domestic asymptomatic carriers. correct number 44?

So might see 20-30 become confirmed cases tomorrow. downward trends cases carriers, good. Hope hidden cluster.

And Jilin popped again? remember two ongoing cluster Xinjiang Liaoning many days. say???? man represented doctor high cocaine AG took money election campaign might morally compromised? honestly true. cares lol. Covid real. Ten percent Texas lot cheaper California still pretty big cities, attractive many companies. Many middle-class people moving since cheaper buy property raise family, similar happened Colorado.

Austin phenomenon tech startups started popping became pretty hipster, DFW Houston grown like crazy past decade. They're huge diverse cities, hick towns like people imagine. shit storm comes toilet tornado Damn. one day away retirement taking wife round world cruise always talked about. Thanks clarifying true false question. worth, seen many ""faithless electors"" elections dating back 1900.

There's 27 since date (including ten 2016 eight 1912).

Of course, there's always first time everything (broadly speaking). run simulation ends infected count hits 4.2 billion. Simulation developers included hitch hikers easter egg. Today  meant create buffer uneducated masses charismatic unworthy (think Hitler type) holding office.

Or, know, think Trump type.  US absolutely cannot fix economy letting virus run rampant. quiet majority people really go restaurants, take vacations, spend money drive economy, know risky. 20-40% risk takers might, business can't stay afloat revenue risk takers. Fixing viral transmission synonymous fixing economy. Getting control allows people cautiously go more. need swiftly take measures virus, including rolling back openings especially bars indoor dining, people need wear masks. viral transmission goes lower, contact tracing help even more. None going work well waffling flip flopping conspiracy peddler White House. People need consistent messaging order compliant. However, find strong evidence relationship blood group risk intubation death.

I've seen articles bad, confusing titles take point make sound like blood group completely unrelated Covid. may saw. thing happened Florida. wanted woman running state covid19 dashboard fib numbers. canned made statement why. Cause trump, third world, third rate nation. Yep bullshit people want downplay threat, luckily checked.  Based post, read see different sites list merv 13, 14, 1.12.11.1 5 , 16 ,17.

Some water droplets viral payload larger .3 micron, merv13 first filter filter 50%. Conflicting info ( larger water-virus particles) correlates percentage small particles captured.  .3 size Merv 13 50%, 14 75%, 15 85%, 16 95%

As stated, Viral particle size small realistically filter even smaller .1 micron.  .125 micron mentioned typical CV size. Industrial technology expensive mean US ""off map"" terms global health data now? easy blame American people forgetting Russia.

Just like US used money resources assist regime change leadership benefitted Banana Republics, Russia vested interests used social media manipulation vast propaganda resources install Trump damage US.

Trump successful attack US foreign power since Pearl Harbour nobody even noticed. look [chart see big dips every five days pandemic. Shut up! plenty problems say worse china false. We’re shithole country now. bad reuse masks? decent supply still feel bad throwing away mask used half hour pick KFC we. GOP. aside politics, Texas fucking awesome Sry typing fast missed “not”  Increasing rank irrelevant criteria brought deny science. Science deals objective fact. Political decisions subjective decisions based subjective values. disagree political views. accept preferred policy outcome kill people. acceptable sacrifice. nothing denies science.

I ignorant constitutional law. oppose constitution. constitution illegitimate reactionary coup articles confederation. Lysander Spooner said, constitution either authorized government had, powerless prevent it. either case unfit exist. ended ditching animal products altogether, part this. I’m 2 months hasn’t hard make switch all. Message need resources, happy help. Thank input. heard Glutathione considered treatment. happen study? 
I'm working school terrified infecting partner. Gonna using mask method like face shield. I'm considering scrubs hair cap think would allow dumb. Ahh end pain please You’re right way they’ve hiding deaths since beginning political right rotting while, right that. Well, he's Chinese, that's that, there's 2 VN goons Orange Julius? single Terran marine vs Zerg rush  Please watch videos. keep mind it’s harder find proof China everything censored. Several youtubers gone missing sharing local footages. Mass neglegent homicide. wonder charged.  list places Americans aren’t welcome pretty much every country. restrictions sensationalized news aren’t U.S.-centric. border restrictions apply countries. say ""ALL"" Chinese people unsanitary. biased opinion shows lot believable. Cut bullshit focus what's going now. US definitely hiding reports numbers since ban hospitals reporting CDC. Yes, google Trump. Money laundering, working mob, hiring immigrants work construction sites, failed casinos another 2 dozen businesses failed. Millions dollars pay IRS etc etc
 FBI'S radar long time ago. even read nieces book him. worth lol. There's enough google free. fuck Closer decades steep decline, keeps getting steeper. Hurt feelings Yes - is, greater Black Plague, AIDS, Pancreatic Cancer combined sorry hear way suggesting cases like exist, point study shows 1/3 still sick 3 weeks. also says 20% young people complained least one symptom 3 weeks testing positive, compared 10% 3 weeks testing positive flu. That's far cry likely develop lifelong chronic illness.


Maybe get completely better 4, 5, 6 weeks. agreement need study more, article way implies case similar third cases, people afraid chronic fatigue 3 months later interpret study meaning likely experience that. fuck care thinks? 

They’re literally front China. employee I'd stand make sure got extra dose sure. Hell, empty canister.  Electoral College, handed Trump victory despite losing, actually setup Founding Fathers prevent Trump. 

Go figure. mother already covid, wanted go home visit mother Florida recently. quarantine upon returning NY this: received calls public health person, answered questions signs symptoms, told staying home. 

Unlike people, assume, actually followed quarantine case possible reinfected. would guess people lying people call text quarantine. Basically, honor system, know well people that. Yeah, fun permanent organ damage survive, kids. Honestly, really could give shit China internally. I'm fucking Chinese.

I'm American, care US does.

See works? PRAY HARDER Also Hong Kong incredibly cases death due early action, population, government. knew drill SARS implemented themselves, even government saying big deal. took preventitive measures earlier I’m sure enough cases handling situation anyway close way dealt everhwhere else world... Texas ever get tired winning much? level winning people finally realize they're running cliff? :( Seriously issue still! field hospitals that’s states built stadiums fields? Absurd ""Why afraid shouting 'Fire!' crowded theater? Surely, there's fire, problem."" Shouldn’t Abbot time lockdown right now? federal salary 
He’s SES rich didn’t steal like Clinton Random people don’t pay bills people don’t go bars don’t want to. yeah, that's concern well - unless people immune prosecution, government adminstrative action, civil forfeiture related information divulged contact tracers, might tell whole truth, whole truth goddamn important.

Also, people contact tracing apps using something like DP-3T, contact tracing would done automatically moment lab produced positive result, none privacy concerns. remember Chinese called Jews south east Asia due wealth dam didn’t expect scapegoat political issue too. Unfortunately, Electoral College failed American people.

One several purposes supposed serve prevent obvious huckster like Trump coming power pulling fast one ignorant masses. Good. play stupid games, win stupid prizes. talking in-person trip hospital, telemedicine session. many instances false sense security. baby trouble may still heartbeat, mom worried reduction movement may relieved enough avoid going ER hears heartbeat.

There conditions telehealth session useful in-person visit, others definitely less good still useful, maybe useless.

The division labor medicine bit different engineering; point medicine applied science opposed pure science. (I know engineers design run tests that's beside point.)

Many routine tests measurements delegated doctors nurses, nurse practicioners, physician's assistants provide cost savings. example, go family doctor, PA takes blood pressure weight. areas technicians specific training -- went mammogram, radiology tech procedure doctor (an oncologist) interpreted results.

As whether tests quantified....

For health issues, tests already are. some, doctor encourage tests regular basis (e.g. breast testicular self-exam) report back notice changes. some, need ""test"" per se want somebody enough know-how say ""yup, sure looks like sinus infection"" licensure (read: ability take personal liability they're wrong) give advice prescribe needed medications. some, tests sort produce number inherently subjective things -- million-dollar question much psychiatry seems ""how much *a lot*?""

But bigger issue whether test available whether right tests asking right questions first place.... short time, we've dumpster fire trajectory since Reagan. retarded? Incredibly wrong know SARS 1 shit literally get sick friend, scientifically oriented person I've seen reddit, I'll tell biggest difference China views viruses West

Take look image below, widely disseminated Western picture looks like ""active treatment"", black ""left unattended"", vertical ""new cases"", horizontal ""time"")

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest problem picture, widely circulated Western media, assumes number patients, serious miscalculation.

Also drop wrong, drop public health policy worked, happened naturally.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure see point. Well sure lot fancy numbers muh guns?!

Checkmate libtards. free US? Almost every developed country even many developing ones offer free treatment, americans needing pay this. I’m sure people ~1 year ago saying shouldn’t help PR rebuild aren’t real Americans. 100%. record ever find threatened attacked knife, find another solid object like chair, use shield. Mash thing right attackers face comes near you. Use attack knife hand. soon attacker stumbled, falls, distracted damage done, run. I...

Did even read context?

It far removed people assume they're smiling because, know, they're posing photo specifically survival odds.

Like shit sherlock take strength smile, read room would you?

It's obviously different hardship. u/undeleteparent like Denmark, Sweden, Norway... I’ve seeing parents every weeks. also literally don’t see single person outside grocery trips every week two. jobs put much higher risk me. you’ve stayed completely secluded, weeks (grocery delivery, etc.) wouldn’t worried seeing them. fucking waking nightmares me. strangest ideas, like walking 4 paces across bathroom still somehow felt like 1,000 steps wide. that, reason, fill bedroom ceiling mattresses.  Thank you. truly idea. Yeah, notice except entire European union, Japan, Korea, etc... 
I mean agree NY excuse mishandling situation Florida Texas making sound like NY first city hit. Hong Kong advanced already third wave countries first. Well, probably returned fire want get shot. yep, sums up. US used place rich came live well. basically strip mined country. result. Yes was. see that. many do. It’s sad part life deal with. like every virus disease take risk living everyday lives lingering around. Deaths take another couple weeks.
There 300k active cases Florida. small percentage people going die. United Kingdom among obese countries Europe. since reddit gave genuine LOL, thank wholesome shit needed ❤️ best fight one never fought! surefire safe would superyacht... irony opted gamble overreaction countries, worried COVID-19 needed be. economies recover faster, whole reason delayed responding worried economic harm. flu finished grandfather (he'd stroke couple years before,) never really understood could kill someone. got it. high school athlete, could barely get go pee. limit energy. swear, endurance never fully recovered that. mean like communism? Russia China shown shitty managing actual economy. imagine that's similar feel seeing ""ninja"" stuff. Gee, ""adults"" (hahaha) guns, acting like spoiled child (US?), WCGW? Reminds survivor episode guy says ""I'm pointing fingers here, ...."" literally points finger two people thinks voted out. No, total. Florida larger population, Florida best per capita week's end. youre right... although update front page second, didnt realize 'age' section hasnt updated month. looking old data. Tere actually little 20 kids die C19 age 9... however 70 die flu... dont react all. Why? YET already works like UK. There's sales tax food UK, except snacks, alcohol restaurant/takeaway food.  forget larger risk long-term damage. Tons cases fit people get long-lasting effects well. least wear masks others I'd say. See main reason US obesity problem. sound like quite bit free time have. Monday - Thursday typically go way, get 12pm (maybe earlier get play hockey) check news, stock market, get ready work. Get work 2:30pm till 2am. Get home 2:15am, take shower watch little hulu Netflix unwind, bed around 4am. Friday comes. that's main day get things done (ie. Grocery shopping, washing car, take care anything else needs done) there's nothing going Saturday Sunday might get time relax.

Basically I'm say lot easier eat healthy time eat healthy. certainly agree obesity huge problem needs addressed, many factors one. Thankfully. super happy went back home quarantine rule.

Plus they've roll fining ton people who's breaking RMCO rules lately. ""Not following rules? Here's fine! too? Another fine!"" I’ve never heard Secret Eaters. sounds dirty. 😂😂😂😂😂 forgetting middle pandemic? That's smart. easy replace millions jobs Filipino/Indian/other workers, could *his job* next. would love see world lot office jobs require in-person training period 6-24 months, go remote in-person trainings/conferences/activities quarterly. person really wants office environment 5-6 days week, become one trainers. Yes, biggest conspiracy all. thread like festival geographic illiteracy. I'm curious means beat chemotherapy. Lol what. 150k USD 150k USD? Trust me, I’m American obesity serious problem here.....especially children. thought I’d read somewhere though obese UK. Desperate times call desperate measures. current outbreak bad March death rate nearly high infection rate imply. Take notes America 😑 comment strikes particularly dense... going go war China this? China owns US right now. Trump shit China - he's completely pocket desperate trade deal change narrative shit show re-election campaing. really matter say point.

Cause illogical idiot. *weren't* talking right now. midst national tragedy fucking class. live sweden, things considered fine spite lax restrictions them. got lucky.

Our daily new cases starting slow now. UK, suspect countries, like US, healthy food cheaper unhealthy food, takes longer prepare. 

Time (and maybe lack access dopamine generating activities?) resource constraint leads poorer people dump money fast food. ""iT's fLu"" years spent learning martial arts taught avoid fights much possible. I'm wondering what's gonna happen drags longer people going start get convicted what's happening protests.

Right now, high tension whatnot, someone gets 10 years assaulting police officer? even (attempted) arson someone building?

If shit like happens election day (or Trump wins), that's whole new situation. glad brought up, show small insignificant C19 is... Nearly 1.25 million people killed **car** accidents **year**. means, average, auto accidents cause 3,287 **deaths** per day. additional **20-50 million people injured disabled**. half ​road traffic **deaths** occur among young adults ages 15-44 

C19 isnt nearly dangerous driving... yet act like end world. Conspiracy theories...are conspiracy? better spilling seed ground suppose. FINE unaware, Ralph's = Kroger. allowed advisable two different things mind. You’re _allowed_ drink 6 bottles whiskey day. It’s just, common sense says don’t. Two kids here... one 3 &amp; 9 months. arrangement exactly like describe &amp; it’s working great. problem mom we’re alternating (even two families w four parents works well), teacher &amp; district making go back five days week, including day students aren’t school sanitize (???). Bc risk, pod dissolving, we’re scrambling come w another arrangement she’s stuck sending daughter daycare, increases school’s risk bc kids school exposed everyone kid’s exposed daycare. It’s absolute mess. there’s sister-in-law, who’s also teacher, district requiring go back five days week, daughter who’s old enough stay home alone stay home three days week there’s nobody stay her. sub-reddit really spoils potential vacation places covid finally reaction HIV absolutely insane. people power ignoring it, making fun calling ""god's wrath"" would targeting gay people drug addicts. governments wanted round ill people put camps. Spoiler: extremely unethical, also detrimental stopping disease everyone _might_ disease go underground even difficult reach them, test offer help. 

Things like anonymous testing far better option. stigma extreme back then, people could lose job, social contacts victim hate crimes infected. Oof Never ceases amaze much empathy many Americans one-percenters. Yet enough out. American Dream poison. forget taking covid normal flu time increase fatality linearly, likely exponentially. immune system can't cope two pathogens efficiently time. case currently still 2 digit around 10-below 30 case..the rising due people back oversea disobey 14 days home-self quarantine..currently malaysian police gonna catch fine people throw oversea returners back hotel quarantine Milk neutralize extent.

That's supply chain issues. wonder would happen another lock hope I’m wrong, that’s place symptom may result wrong treatment maybe nurse repeatedly making dosage mistake medical accident. course, another troubling new symptom also bad news.... Perhaps UK misspelt eat healthy food. numbers faked way makes look worse... said tip bare minimum. care tip 40%. Keep rationalizing exploiting waitstaff rewarding industry claim hate. reality cheap. hoaxers aren’t going accept COVID reality see loved ones get really sick die. It’s no-win situation rest us. Hong Kong actually third wave. multiple weeks reported local cases local spread. Masks, city-wide social distancing rules, work home orders virus control. Taiwan gets new cases would second wave them. countries moments virus control local spread. 

This wave thought started overly lax exemptions crew entering Hong Kong ships planes rotate crew. chain transmission brand new Hong Kong previously Hong Kong cases originating from. 

The first wave virus first started border restrictions helped manage it. second wave asymptomatic spread people didn’t take social distancing seriously. wave poor controls imported cases. Eeriky!? world fucking knew would happen instead way prepared another pandemic greedy fucking wankers focused completely fucking populations wealth.  sign injection? Less* Fingers crossed Mitch doesn’t even win seat back. don’t even know read hoaxers anti-maskers 

**One** family members quoted identified former hoaxer. spoke feeling apparently immense guilt. **some** family even attended event. 

I also don’t know read news articles medical updates. you’re questioning safety socially distanced outdoor activity small groups much, trouble believing have. 

As legality, you’re apparently one incapable critical thought morally condemn people engaging legal activity **authorized appointed state health officials.** Somehow you’re equating officials president treating interchangeably. idea why. 

The school question far complex seem recognize. I’d encourage seek coverage concerning vital social economic (especially working families) importance K-5 returning school least part-time balancing risk teachers becoming infected. 

Children appear poor vectors virus— catch adults, way around— almost always extremely mild cases. 

Your condescension obnoxious ironic. Please stop writing things like “(cue sarcasm)”. you’d try civilly engaging people seem disagree, you’d probably identify blindspots flawed understandings and/or agree anticipated. think safe say UK government talking arse topic covid, though. get funny idea people going jollies filling planes need fly get work (am care worker pretty risky frontline work.) Hope made back home ok clean bill health healthy glow show it!

I want nothing people get back enjoying life I'd love bit action too. think safe right go Spain, regardless governments countries saying. ever changing situation unless people booking almost last minute holidays based yesterday's stats risky imo book anything week advance. Sad true real knife fight scary know knife, turned quickly. really want end knife fight. Melbourne city. Victoria state.

it's difference Miami Florida. Portland Oregon. Houston Texas. Critical thinking longer taught schools reason. Tell daughter. year three total write offs. driver always blame for. Hey, followed speed limit signs. One got even aggressive towards police. paid bill.

For me, following speed limits lousy excuse wearing masks. use another device. Besides said above, maybe meat/food freezer? know freezer temperature kill virus. Shit's gonna get worse feds crack peaceful BLM protestors justifying want carry guns protests sight really want see.

I mean shit could barely drive *half* town last mass shooting without getting depressed, imagine bad things going get get couple cops protestors hot headed, stressed tense near fully loaded guns.

So let's **HOPE** happen. Cause that's literally 99% point. also one argument hear topic comes on. 

This truly difficult topic end ""normal"" citizen suffers. Yeah I'll give they're handling better politicians Youre australian arent good human would knee capped tha selfish hag. Make Murica Great clear: data reported July 20- July 26 deadline 26th right? way tell reported yet far past deadline was? two sentence article - getting shorter every day. Belgium reporting confirmed cases excess mortality. That's count high. voted in. may nitpick electorial collage winning majority vote, almost half voters voted him. Non voters care would happen. buy this, ""it american public, politicians"". chose them. Many chose actively knowingly, chose ""team spirit"", many care enough pay attention. 25% americans voted Trump, means 25% americans also bothered vote him. chose him, chose senate congress. problem represent country, do. Exactly :/ think survive another lockdown. Hopefully tightened SOPs work better. zoned Sarawak (if i'm wrong increase) too. Hate downer think country ever get shit together subreddit hilarious. people arguing ""having freedom live life like want taken away"". wearing mask. Insane. Well lucky: least UK didnt close borders people coming Spain cancelled flights. agree whole gun law situation difficult.
In end ""notmal citizen suffern either he/she looses his/her rights becomes victim sort incident.

Then really willing kill someone person get his/her hand weapon.

I mean school ""shooting"" Flamethrower. LOL actually dumb assuming race based FOOD made. Add tin foil hat. :)

edit: Nice edit. Next time take advantage edit make somewhat coherent comment instead linking shit. one needed funky time

Sad thing covid even require close contact. Hear Drunk driver killed new mother amd 3 month old child?

Do still drive car? 

Just cause moron something incredibly fucking stupid shouldnt preclude want. Flurida would assume someone claiming Kim stole Intellectual Property. part Rambo fantasy, every group one basically thing causes people break. Rambo fantasy really common around 2A fetishists really basic reason: justified reason actively murder others gun spent money on, buy guns use designed purpose.

For guy feeling freedoms ignored harmed allowed bar pandemic. That's *it.* Dude never allowed near *a* gun all, yet owned one one car Rambo fantasy actively take place.

Then get actual nitty gritty civilians owning guns. Dude goes back sports bar immediately gets multiperson shootout people ""Defending"" \[Which, TBF, that's exactly doing, going hell lot less clear due multiple guns, uniforms making harder tell many including things like crossfire always problem, ricochet, general lack training believe people lacked\] guy shot windows bunch innocent people due heightened hysteria result denied entry bar. completely nonlethal situation turned situation many could died things went slightly differently. talking, bare level, *this good outcome,* *only* 4 got injured, 6+ dead like guy pulled gun killed 3 30 seconds crowded mall, like Sandy Hook one died, like Pulse Nightclub countless lives lost, *just 4, injured* good thing. really fucked up.

And *yet another* gun owner ""Responsible owner"" loses cool takes action based mixture frustration pride. really sad we've come point, *again.* getting tiring trying remember many shootings point. Source? speculation? Haha jokes virus, that’s long planning anyway 👌🏽 hurricane season kicking gulf, get erm ... interesting. fucking *grates* that's sure. 100% Tamiflu horrible poison kills people gives people [psychotic also found many health officials effective taking Good point. Unfortunately, baseball would lot feasible players actually followed social distancing game, i.e. dugout. fact, wore masks, even field, players Didi Gregorius doing, might even able play level near 100% safety. mean, whole thing form natural selection too. really strict one advanced medical field, 200 years ago, anti-progress skeptics would weeded out. thing there’s guns citizens. vast, overwhelming majority gun owners States responsible gun owners. don’t mean downplay incidents like these, that’s intention plenty violent gun crimes, half billion guns would shit ton violence wasn’t case. Good news Randy! Go LC get us liquor drinks celebrate fear hoaxers turn states florida/texas Statistically speaking, majority people poor wrong decisions Came say 10 What, that's lot unpack here. questioning someone's willingness travel pandemic put camp people think masks work? One actively defies science (mask deniers) concern based pandemic panned known coronavirus. question governments policy I'm therefore similar mask deniers? could apply logic anyone questions government policy I. E. Concerns could opening soon sake economy like reduction 2m rule 1m (the virus conditions spread 8 meters like meat factories I. E. Leicester). 

Also, covid transmits aerosols particularly well either stagnant air air cons. Planes would breeding ground another infection vector. Yes cases moment question opening international travel without maintaining quarantine travellers certain countries cluster waiting happen. Spain quarantine issue shows indecisive UK government be. caution (plus know effective treatment, vaccine development research) key seeing pandemic through. forgive questioning blasé' attitude.

If trolling, congrats got me.

Edit: misspelling. also, trolling damn man, leap logic. China recorded 57 local Covid-19 cases Sunday

China seriously underreporting, since beginning. Oh agree, change german gun law adding recreational shooting Hunting Competetive shooting 'Valid reason' gun could whole process acquiring license includes psychological test more.

 wouldnt even problem Gun and/or Ammo allowed stored directly range.

That way could get guns fell love like M1 Garand fire range spare time. Switzerland likely stricter regulations. Literally every nation stricter regulations guns including 3rd world countries suffering mass poverty. 

And think happen either. Every nation facing form white supremacy far right extremism even Sweden. Given time foster see shit want too, guaranteed. Wow guy likely alive anymore ""and maybe lack access dopamine generating activities""

What mean? elaborate further?

I think certain people USA good way beat that. different classes HEPA filters ranging E10 85% (filtration) U17 (99.999995%) tho (that's case EU least, may vary ) suspect community spread, kind mass movement people outlying cities exactly could take issue elsewhere? 

Not handled things well point, makes wonder. treat flu way. Masks self-quarantines. Employers able pressure give ultimatum working sick. guy ""Average, responsible citizen"" act. key problem level defense 2A lack gun control. guy acting, *in mind,* justifiable attack people infringing *his right* go bar, damned logic logic play role many buy guns. 

It's literal story every single mass shooter period: either flipped result sudden incident \[Pulse, Sandy Hook\] planned years taking action \[Columbine, LA Country Music Festival\] *still* means, want, ability so. argument say LA shooter Aurora Movie Theater shooter would still done crimes regardless, interviews Aurora shooter flat states chose guns unlike car could damage faster unlike bombs put nearly much effort still high risk getting caught \[A bunch backpacks theater hallway likely go let alone accurately top suspicious\] reason chose guns.

There pretty blatant reason guns outclassed every weapon thing outclass guns point explosives general warfare. 

And even going mental health check likely stopped regardless zero doubts guy sane first place, literally snapped thing happens time stress high individual, let alone society. stop someone prior listed mass shooters, it'd someone actually honest administer tests.

As American feel saddened gun owners justify ok *them* ticking time bomb, feel saddened I've see communities literally fucking **shatter** due gun violence 100% preventable enabled fucking lazy actually change it. mean shit finally got tackling problem black Americans happening hundred years, maybe 70 I'm 90 we'll actually bill gun control passed graves hundreds thousands dug. like good percentage population absolutely *compelled* travel pandemic.

Bows, matter type strength, considered toys Germany everyone buy them. bit training able reliably hit chest sized target 25m distance. 

I still dislike mere thought that. need type violence here. look crime associated statistics involving guns. overall safer home owner country without ""gun freedom"" way around.

Just side note. shoot German military rifles (G3 G36) short time military. things, used ""intended"" inhumane monsters. definitely limited military. Covid19 disease.

Pneumonia symptom.


However pneumonia often used disease well, since cases exact cause pneumonia determined.
Though case atleast viral bacterial pneumonia differentiated possible.



Same cold, running nose congestion symptoms cold.

But symptoms also caused conditions like allergies.



It sometimes gets bit confused hundred years ago, pneumonia simply disease physicians tell causing pneumonia. I’m sorry anyone thinks comment shitty Cos know many people what’s right but.... disappointed humanity. 
Growing watching films heroes bent backwards right even personal cost thought human nature- lately see huge backslide homophobia, racism, antisemitism, transphobia- top people actually enjoying shit need end fucking pandemic. 

I don’t understand straight facedly declare we’re mature species we’re still figuring reasons murder based stupid reasons, ignoring actual evidence things certain way helps. 
I despair humanity. say flu too? I'm making argument there, evidence pointing one way, initial studies show case, act away. That's science action. hand medicines 100% effective cases, hedge chase margins. policy idea early honesty indications helpful, fill boots. 

If hand policy ideas born deep misunderstanding science (""inject bleach, stick lightbulb arse"", instance) rush implement based feels alone, get climate change denialism, instance. excuses racism.

And cigarettes point exactly valid - Policy influenced tobacco lobbyists TV adverts celebrating health-giving benefits smoking decades. Science, policy feels made changes. Finally, clarify. early April performing many tests wanted, probably would detected 100,000 daily cases, instead 10,000. detecting severe cases. Sometimes, even that. Thing mortality decisive factor alone. also permanent damage, long lasting side effects similar stuff. still limited know virus, judging people experienced far permanent damage possible. percentage probably much higher death toll. even risk simply restrict actions order help everyone? want sound rude, seems me, situation work home 5:30pm 2am, there's clearly something wrong that. either bad time management really really bad situation. hard time believe there's many people US situation, this. fine. making comment went r/badwomensanatomy spouted kinds garbage women.

Ah non-pandemic memories. flu deaths calculated flu season. flu season ~13 weeks long US. Mr. Lahey enough shit talk unlikely. people asymptomatic. bubbles radar reaches enough infected get noticed. China surpass US 10-30 years unless start making shit again. idea. Let's open schools. Imagine called Coronavirus ""SARS 2""... think people would take little seriously, would terrible? remember SARS *really* big deal back day. Never proud tri state area right angry.  Yes. Less viral load helping.

Also detecting mild cases. Before, system overload rarely tests performed people without mild symptoms. Unless medical staff VIP. 

Looking seroprevalence studio know young people got also infected first wave. Around 4% Spanish young adults, means hundreds thousands people, almost showing June stats, diagnosis relevant deciding significant medical treatment. Half diagnosis hospitalized people April. 


Now, hospitalizing less 10% diagnosis, means actually detecting mild cases.

Last thing, effectiveness testing inequal depending region. Since humans expected learn history? spread word universal healthcare socialism. infrastructure. Thank analysis. terrible approach pronouncement CDC default position suspicion. Oh god can’t even mentality. vaccine going available use least end year, maybe early 2021. swear god undiagnosed mental health issues people cannot keep others safe small amount time vs entire span life. tiny price pay make hopes catching all. 

I afraid future. covid19 causes life long issues random sudden death, going entire generation people issues, untold medical expenses, therapy everything else. It’s going take us 100 years breed issues caused virus.. Spanish flu caused woman give birth mentally handicapped children, quality life cut half it..

This terrifying. There's plenty mullets here, go Mayaguez see plethora mullets kinds, rat tail mullets, edged mullets, kinky mullets, mullets females, mullets kids... reason west mullet still thing, guess? taste /S   sounds really alarming hope stay safe.

I sorry chiming cheer guns means protect ""manhood"".

You give fuck people shot. situation like above, police show know ""the good guy gun is""?

My wife rifles hunting shooting clays. pro gun control. lost popular vote 3,000,000 Hillary Clinton.

Let sink in.

Nobody voted Hillary going say ""Ya know... I'm glad Trump won, I'm going vote time"".

Only 46% people aged 18-29 voted 2016.

Only 58% people aged 30-39

 66% people 40-49

Numbers virtually higher across board Obama's first election.

200,000 people probably going dead November coming voters highest voting rate.

If there's one thing Trump done, energized Left get Trump office costs. 3rd party news. 

2016... Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, Darrel Castle.

2020 ... Kanye?

Unless there's rigged election, I'm willing bet Trump loses bigley. 95% 650,000 deaths occurred 4 months. 27 March worldwide deaths 28,000. also don’t want gun fight live wi, virus getting here. work country club 500ppl events weekend. disaster making.

Third, there's really fat line going park relieve boredom spitting people protests masks (happened couple days ago). right wing pushing ideology objectively wrong harmful. way get want get people reject idea truth, knowledge, expertise. Reality liberal bias. already enough space trash keep Javascript reason dad sometimes visits friends live US always baffled bathrooms. usually packed pills. appear pill every little nuisance.

What also baffles him, living here, also know names many different prescription drugs. Like say something hurts feels uncomfortable always say something like ""You take *Insert drug name here*"" expects know wth even remember it.

Just screams like culture problem imo. highest refugee immigrant per million, countries left die. shit. Same. feel like I’m going crazy. left friends party one wearing masks social distancing. Like sorry shitty engagement party fucking wait. 

Sorry venting. I’m done friends stupidity. rushing engagement, rushing buying house can’t afford, understanding masks. can’t supportive anymore. wonder U.S. outlawed murder. freedom kill others restored! jail next 30 years preaching choir, people forgot needed reason say “I told people Sun Belt didn’t wear masks, conveniently forgot.

This important distinction make because:

“The large scale changes society required contain virus also number potential adverse health welfare effects”

“Senanayake wrote median age death Covid-19 80 years, slightly lower causes death 2018 (81 years).” feel like we're splitting hairs. guys deserve tossed jail various reasons. thought overblown. would blowover like 21st century viruses like Swine Flu Sars. want affect economy numbers all. know pillar kept Trump support up. Foolish thinking though. getting home pull bar quarantine turned good investment director think uni tv hour yesterday explaining everyone prepared going different safe. asked people enroll year going different going get monies worth wait year? went 20 min saying different blah blah gimme ur money! 

A lot schools going go bust year feel. great thing. Fuck bogus profit crap schools. family type barbecues I've people going back forth inside outside.

Deaths counted. Cases massively counted. Plug death rate calculator. Switzerland means controlling guns. controlling ammunition. laws Switzerland lot stringent gun ownership states, many people use model gun rights. 

I'd say absolutely follow lead, soon someone able buy penis extension want, cry rights tank. 

I'm gun owner, several serves purpose. also conceal carry permit, armed places go. think average person allowed gun belongs battlefield requires months proper training use properly. country gun problem, bigger Texas. ...Murica... fucking shithole country... ""The way stop bad guy gun good guy gun""

Nobody bothered ask bad guy gun first place. Humans never learn!!!! Well they're gonna split bunch states equal Wyoming's population people like happy 100 deaths per state. come here. Cases increasing, really international tourism thing right now, anywhere.

This. France, people really inconsiderate selfish, frustrating.

Take care! Mask wearing social distancing rest human history is. didnt change anything.

But admit changing something. Come on, almost there, admit lied you’re covid truther, trying downplay it’s impact protect chosen political figure. truth set free F Snowflakes still used insult? wearing mask, need stop touching mask, reuse mask cleaned, still need keep distance pulling mask help. 

A lot people ""wear mask"" lower talk people.
If want wear mask successfully need put leave house take wash returned home. touch mask chance contaminate mask hands. hands it'll door handles, steering wheel phone etc. people think safe remove masks, still need stop touching everything constantly wash hands /sanitise.

The severity depends much ingested healthy are, looking healthy, plenty active people underlying issues. Wearing mask help, wear mask follow every guideline. Wearing mask touching mask every minute pull basically makes wearing mask worse. want touch mask unless 100% removing sanitise hands first. Mostly see Soho/Midlevels. Probably surprising. [... church's revival—an event consisting multiple religious services meetings aim encourage new baptisms, inductions faith—was originally set take place course one week. (Pastor Daryl) Ross (at Warrior Creek Missionary Baptist Church) said event shut early initial congregant tested positive virus Wednesday. Two days later, ""I've got church members sick everywhere,"" recalled.

Despite outbreak, Ross told AL.com regret hosting revival believes attended feel same.

""We knew getting into,"" said. ""We knew possibilities. But, goodness, man, three days one old-time revivals. unbelievable. everybody ask, talk church members right now, they'd tell you, we'd again. good.""

Congregation members participated church's revival required wear face masks, AL.com reported. Ross told news outlet social distancing encouraged attendees sat household units services. 

Regarding interpersonal contact, pastor said: ""We let everybody like...If comfortable shaking hands, shook hands. didn't, didn't."" ...] would still practical/effective keep using masks specific 'high spreading risk situations' like e.g cinema. People really 'socialize' watching movie yet 400 people packed limited space. Trump called Obama resign. take 4-5 drops every morning never really looked dosage used many different brands. tried taking night couple years back kept awake night. takes months go bottle...I maybe use two bottles per year. I'm going guess people getting flu shot higher normal social distancing, mask wearing hand washing going make pretty mild flu season. Avoiding seems like best stay unharmed avoid hassle Police Hospital.

As pretty lazy person 'hassle' argument works really well. “The thin layer copper-based coating retains virus-disabling property least six weeks, meaning surfaces would longer need frequent cleanings. Ducker says thinks coating could effective years confident weeks coating existed long.

Last week, Ducker colleagues became one first teams — first — publish academic paper showing coating effective new coronavirus. “A Surface Coating Rapidly Inactivates SARS-CoV-2” appeared July 13 “ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces,” journal published American Chemical Society.” Looking humanity sub lost cause. won't. People saying ""another civil war"" like 30+ years Extreme gerrymandering unashamed voter suppression (thanks Secretary State Kemp) apocalypse movies people increasingly stupid starting look pretty realistic right now. Yeah, bring gun ready use it. gun ""just case."" That's gun owners end shot gun often. 100%. Also - stay back throw things. beans seems funny hits head, happy. Anti-compliance guns. that's American way. Lol actually editing manipulating comments play victim. bit late considering I'm one commented. :) It’s going suck page yearbook dedicated children/teachers died school year. Wait province actually able handle 8 times many people compared thought? actually gives lot confidence.

That fact CDC admitted science predicting roughly .4% death rate.

Some simple math makes clear thing much less bad thought was. Good you. countless irresponsible morons don’t. laws things people won’t right thing cause. look BS around wearing mask stop fricken pandemic. Clearly know 5,000 terrible. child thought trolling Internet hilarious. I’ll give piece advice age taught me, you’ll look back time life embarrassed obviously childish were. think statistics. preserved 0 death count statistic - impressive.

Imagine back Trump saying case count 15 would soon go zero, spent $1,000,000 per patient brought case count zero - implemented proper controls. would spent $15,000,000 - would bargain compared current situation.

Just lungs “survived” CoViD time around, doesn’t mean next time get flu, pneumonia, heck, CoViD again, body won’t succumb it, could end much weaker prior getting sick CoViD earlier.

It’s lasting effects scare most.

Being “CoViD survivor” interesting term, early don’t sure know long run.... 2020 keeps giving. u need ❤️  Thought power Christ would compel virus away. seroconversion sign waning immunity? circulating neutralising antibodies longer, body given first line defense. still memory B cells, helper cells killer cells around, able reactivate mitigate infection _after_ virus enters cells, reactivation take time. immune response slower.

24. Surely taken account 646K upper \*estimated\* flu deaths, confirmed Flu deaths.

This seems 650,000 confirmed deaths COVID (likely big understimate) vs 646,000 non-confirmed flu deaths (the higher end best guess) predisposition getting pneumonia flu, might prescribed antibiotics. case something keep mind flu death toll also much higher reality reasons don’t think good bad news. news, statistic, one expected point also anticipated.

An example good news would people recovering expected less people infected symbolizing gaining control virus spreading.

For comparison, estimated around 460 million people recovered Spanish flu. 

Do think would great news 460 million people recovered coronavirus 50 million died? Would great news you? Sounds like that... problem. germany self defense laww states may defend us reasonable measure, means someone punches pull knife stab didnt defend correctly probably convicted murder self defense. think it’s mix. User behavior probably changed hotspot states 10 days ago, testing maxed significant delays. 

Pretty easy project forward we’ll 60,000-80,000 cases almost Labor Day 6000 deaths week.

The HHS cutover skewed hospitalization data won’t able see hit real plateau. Regardless plateau flatter first wave significant changes haven’t made. schools open without masks reduced class sizes, get another pop October. little bit cautious claim know. NOBODY knows long-term effects COVID, definition. KNOW serious long-term effects many people, different statement KNOW long-term effects many people.

There ample precedent viruses debilitating long-term effects human body. Categorically ruling wishful thinking. darn mermaids! Oh do. find current systems highly inefficient clearly based false beliefs bad nostalgia.

I unaware German history nationalism based around lie nazis. true many countries clearly white washed history. Amarica same. look back history current knowledge clear bad. Vietnam point population bonded together gone full Revolution.
If look China recent changes history education see plan completely rewrite history. known crisis actor peers. People allowed mix point goes back normal people start dying someone around them, whether family, friends, colleagues shoppers etc given virus. 

In end people general self concerned selfish. people isolate longer others people get taxi without masks cough away. know get voted oblivion let tell little secret. virus happen random person chance ate bat stew place China lab studies coronaviruses.

Sit super close   sorry,I trying offensive. tried diffusing all. Sure... I’m saying order viral load theory hold, shouldn’t carer house get sicker others house general rule? don’t know we’re seeing pattern. said, US pretty normal adoption rate masks western standards throughout pandemic. even check colts saloon start murica? still wild west. Yes, did. number deaths increased Sunday last last Sunday one before. data available. actually go look make claims. Chemotherapy cure cancers kill first. People die cancer chemotherapy treatment, usually die treatment trying rid body cancer. 

Think RoundUp body instead weeds. get RoundUp leave tree whole branch tree die trying kill weeks base tree.

So that's said beat chemotherapy. time, seems like armed patrons guy assault weapon forced flee, kind proves argument 2nd amendment supporters. dude assault weapon never allowed legally anyways. Criminals respect law often police take long help, help (police cannot held legally liable failure protect you). law abiding people need armed degree.

I couple shotguns home defense wife apartment complex criminals living led police showing monthly. set bookshelf backdrop near entrance way case anyone broke live, things 100% safe.

Where grew country, police could take hour show (happened child went missing) areas better take chance .


Assault weapons legal though. standard shotguns, pistols, rifles seems bit crazy me. attacked, forced ""fair"" fight law. attacker injure kill readily hands knife and/or gun, skill and/or so. law says bigger/better fighter protect absurd, IMO. think sensible say, ""If want confronted knife/gun, attack people."" Anything less is, sense, condoning aggressive attacks. remember history doomed repeat it. Someone said once. Meanwhile Hong Kong takes drastic measures gets hundred new cases.   Sorcery part? part hyper wealthy net worth increase hundreds billions +30 million lost jobs health insurance pandemic? Cause part real world people need MUCH aware of. There's enough leaks North Korea something like get out. airtight. China completely different, there's plenty contact out.

Believing they've successfully covered 250 000 deaths would far far impressive feat suppression virus. Especially since many trustworthy nations used similar methods similar results. TMML .02% population watched video YT. promised female Martial Arts instructor beating robber. action got grabbing shirt, putting head lock pushing away keeping distance.

However, knew she‘d capable plenty time actually beat - chose to. Why? said, learned avoid fights much possible.

Shadow edit, soon enough there’s asterisk, know wrote, quit lying give paper, think least shred credibility.

This Wikipedia describes RedState.

RedState American conservative political blog.

&amp;#x200B;

How long take Americans realize health event nothing nationality, religion, position held, party affiliation, age, gender?

It's fucking disease.

I want reply stupid message like anymore.

You're wasting time. say data suspect. Don’t say data going every day, that’s simply true. go cry much echo chamber /r/politics is.

Conservatives hypocrisy go hand hand. evidence pet theory two lessons human history, form feedback loop.

1. Pride goes fall.

2. Nobody learns anything history. hospitilizations deaths matter point. much data fuckering reported cases. legit fuckery (testing sites overloaded) non legit (fudging stuff) see comment you, making up. longest focus solely yourself. like see? felt like return sports sending wrong message. People desperate return normal time yet. sad is, maybe send stronger message. planning world change anything. beat virus staying home infection rate falls. try cheat it, lose. we’re halfway 2020... death rate probably much higher that. Trump wants get re-elected

It true 2020 election year United States, change fact China still lied hard fake 21 million people talking phones *when they're dead* countries need vaccine West. much vulnerable expended resources trying contain virus. US may back business first despite current large infection rate deaths. guess lifeguard chairs need higher referring to? No, live country currently head collective ass killing fellow countrymen due ignorance.

I visited USA, say near certainty I've visited country 100+ trips there. really enjoyed visiting one point, YEARS ever think setting foot again. disappointing many like me. problem lot people can't resist sweets. Humans good push away knowledge tempted.

And junk foods designed, recipe, marketing placement stores tempt people.

Most people can't resist completely unfair put 100% responsibility people. Everything tried since obesity epidemic started change individuals. Working.

But forbid advertisement surgery crap, adding suger tax, forcing stores back going happen, matter many lives would save. FREEDOM.  debate, truther, got caught spreading lies propaganda, tried alter history, got caught again, got pissy it. You’re sad human People need space talk mental impact them. Yes, know saving lives, make less depressed, take away need Celexa complete utter misery life nothing apartment job hate every single thing made worth living ripped away one tell things back. Exactly! long Dow up, EvEryThInG fiNE!

It's blatantly obvious whenever see merry band sycophants parade newly distilled message comes mash elitist blather. didnt change one party controls influx information, truth becomes meaningless. Sure virus kill lot people reported COVID19 casualties, Trump get look great front cameras. never Americans him, optics. I'm saying Corona vanish all. I'm saying reported cases vanish Americans keep dying droves. Spaniard here. Please come here. Cases increasing, really international tourism thing right now, anywhere.

Also maybe tourism industry dies focus productive industries, long rely tourism country progress we'll highly vulnerable pandemics. *serfdom Speaking BYD, they're making big deals masks million masks California 316 million dollars, recent deal too, before.

And that's another sign fact China outbreak control, else selling masks PPE US, back Feb March. seems like really low bar even ham sandwitch could manage get over. PA takes blood pressure weight.

That crazy, need even nurse this! wonder healthcare unaffordable. concerned time 2,000 people came back life, guess plenty inconsistencies pick at! I'm extrovert, still need human fucking connection, life reduced little weekdays ""wake up, go job hate, come home"" weekends ""stay home go supermarket therapy"" literally making depressed I'm wondering point anything anymore big doses celexa ativan pretty sure I'm getting addicted melatonin. 

I less 1% chance dying thing (mid 30s, pre-exisiting conditions make higher risk) I'm rapidly hitting point I'd rather take chances 1 200 500 (or whatever hell someone like me) dies continue live like this. 

What look forward anymore? know go concert, see friends live interstate abroad side town, go holiday, eat family etc. *Everything* made life worth living bene ripped away one tell things back. Per capita. ""other arrangements"" work. problem school, lack social distancing happens school also anywhere concentrate children parents work. extended family might help moved far away that. forget; supposed time year *harder* spread. fucked fall. Yes indoor restaurants. It’s also encouraged termed virus diplomacy- Vietnam given considerable aid countries fight virus, including providing masks PPE, tracking help medical personnel. served put good diplomatic position they’ve favour nations. Spain’s largest outbreaks far past excess deaths visible now. Spain’s excess looks around England.

Spain around 50k excess deaths reported deaths around 30k. 
So known long time Spain probably another 20k deaths. mods make ""\[countryname\]"" (as \[Ireland\]) title compulsory, otherwise rule ""no edited titles"" enforced quite strictly. first one ripple real wave. virus going “that wasn’t wave, wave”. Trevor Noah good segment safety precautions Stock futures news. let's find Kim Kardashian say matter... insurance zero deductible zero copay cost per month? That's debatable brilliant job? Nothing ever enforced here, that’s we’re hitting record new cases everyday. Miss u 😭 Maybe, almost certainly not.

They'd likely catch drove window down, gives indication likelihood. single mom works 2 jobs McDonalds wrong choice going fall deaf ears.

I slovakia, US, exactly sentiment understand. dont cook 3 hours make meal. cook every single day, usually takes 30 minutes including washing dishes. roommate dorm, always cooked dinner. literally came 3am drunk cooked dinner minutes (just frying chicken breasts etc...) acting like cooking something need whole day do. Nothing works 100% - masks work better hand washing plus provide visual reminder mindful virus. wear mask, virus unlikely spread far face. 

My mask protects you, mask protects me.

Edit: seriously seems country can't grasp concept. that? Trump administration ordered states hospitals bypass CDC, send COVID numbers directly White House task force.

Some states longer publicly reporting accurate COVID numbers; Florida instance messing data months now.

The sudden drop infections deaths likely related change reporting, actual stabilization trend COVID cases. massive backlog tests really slow processing too.

We've days processed 7000 8000 tests still coming back around 20% positive cases. paralysis seen virus frightening. haven’t seen reports regarding side effect Covid today. It’s sad see grown man resort name calling. know joking leeches approved modern medical treatment used surgeons increase successful outcomes reattachment surgery someone needs finger appendage sewn back on. yet still ahead California 1/2 population.  Yeah, executive functioning issues. theory could make great plan get day. practice, plan going work. fired like would store. call win. closing several economies, stay home orders, wide spread mask usage time history. found face shields alone better mask makes absolute sense considering air blow right around shield. What's issue here? Yes really! premier sending teachers students back school fall little support protect virus. He’s telling giving funding it. gave back some, all, regular funding cut pandemic started. operational funding teaching. 

His goal privatize public services, including education health care give dying oil industry. protection kids school, many parents pull kids homeschool. gives premier say parents don’t confidence public system start shutting schools. He’s worried teachers children die achieve goals. Covid running rampant province right number gullible idiots think it’s kind government hoax. 

My town taken zero precautions protect anyone highest infection rate province. died, written brave souls gave lives continue protect economy. Funny, one asked died volunteering. 

The premier Alberta, Jason Kenney pure evil. working hard drive doctors province sell public healthcare system highest bidder. 

May choke caviar rot deepest hell ever. obvious solution aside addressing homeless problem budget nice self cleaning toilets Europe?  many years (made JCDecaux) - they're mainly used druggies shoot in.

Oh use poop also? stinks. SF long ago probably problem. remember thinking city clean pretty. Suprised problem. big park see lot bums. Sure, one thing say, ""I made mistake! like you, learned better, please learn mistake"" Vs. ""Oh *have always* said dangerous...."" [CM Punk intensifies]  forget prep test prep test!  circulating it

Sincerely, rest Canada. personally seen happen IRL. Twice. people island B die dehydration, they'll listed crocodile deaths everyone say Island conspirasists keep going near water.  1860's pretty good tbh anti-masker... you? trying make many defense cases guy? uneducated personal opinion mean anything ESPECIALLY since numerous medical scientific bodies agreed man made. first two options likely cross-species transmission, even personal opinion**, studies seem considered**""

They considered it, pushed corner called ""conspiracy theories"".

You evidence-based reasons make claims making, opinion literally that, superficial opinion. Top scientific journals Nature top research institutes agreed virus almost certainly originated cross-species transfer. even go racist subtext underlying ""conclusions"".

The thing agree on, credible evident support, people need wear masks. Honestly he’s mental.. fuck gives LA move Texas.. even Corona fuck Joe? Yes, this. Fulfilling human relationships based shared values experiences life. Denying science behind wearing masks inversely related intelligence.

A side effect many people deny science evolution culled pandemic. public getting facts wonder everyone thing. Nobody really knows whats really right. Always thought labeling posts like ""Good News"" dumb basically raw indication many people infected. feel you, It’s south. wife walked wells street Chicago yesterday (restaurant &amp; second city area) disturbing. 1:7 masks, restaurants packed, step street properly distance people without masks. ~~countries~~ worlds important ~~epidemic~~ pandemic tbh

There fixed u That's going amazing Kdrama someday Look, hear Americans say time.

You want difference? Half.

You make half money here. Half.

I gave much half moved home.

The half goes helping support society.

Most Americans can't handle making half. case, finance, lot more.

That's difference. going get rich. middle class; many wealthy people, least, American style. also American style poor people. stayed home right thing do, even cost us individually lot money. government helped. That's we're fucked Covid.

Please ""joke"" coming here. proud country sacrificed lot make better.

Please fix country instead.

Thanks. Plot twist: recipients become human 5G node polite society society one access education, healthcare, affordable housing among stuff, guns... definitely part people morons Yeah Tf website anyway? staying 10 sec super heated phone sad ""essential workers"" general well compensated, put Karens, getting exposed virus people feel freedom wear mask important workers health.

Even many retailers developing mask policies, policies ""wear mask please"" rather mask service; fear maskholes getting violent asked wear mask. fact ""DEMANDS apology"" massive delay making response reminds typical government requested speeches local propaganda CCP.

some one needed funky time ;) Travel US countries banned, so, exporting around world. right? divisive* This! this. 

They excuse, not! Compared Covid, flu absolute joke. analysis number infections vs. number deaths.

From perspective, Covid kicks shit flu. Yes this. dad told earth flat, would telling people nonsense? 

The media likely treating nonsense stupidity is. Perhaps people's behaviour precisely reaction lockdown overly strict. 

If shut people homes 7 weeks, possibility even going exercise, going significant reaction lockdown finally eased. Nope.    
By time get population going again.   
The mad max era would distant pyramids us PR? another location?  Ohio. Americans citizens. point useless method prevent virus entering country, exactly happened. Put microphone different room. county CA, two weeks get results. It’s even worth No, two counts.

As OP replied, plus ...

Georgians. Edward died 1910 really think socially distanced ? Lots hugging kissing went there. everyone wants talk position knowledge, even you, bad thing, ""same wrong""

But important distinction is:
I base knowledge piece contradicting scripture put together millennia (and points political intent - looking you, Council Nicaea).

The bible contradicting piece - arguably design - foster whatever belief already hold. noticing says lot knowledge someone going path holds.

Or would also go knowledge someone who, say knows Dungeon&amp;Dragon rulebooks picks whatever interpretation fits current game best? comparison works here. It’s race guys. Yah best friends going week dream vacation P.R. Leaving Dallas that’s creeping Corona. Meanwhile I’m still scrubbing groceries delivered... two kinds people one us fun guess...

I see point, sounds like someone can't go holiday jealous people complaining theirs. Information overload. Since find information (factual not) supporting debunking whatever claim make, we've effectively created parallel universes choose-your-own-adventure comes world view.

Yea fuck rest u might kill trough actions right.  
Not problem Yeah people poor situation can't change, good number people poor bad decisions make. Use ad blocker. people happy death rate skyrocketing due reopening everything.

LOL visitors, presumably heightened import/export think know better Europe's intelligence agencies? 

Yawn. Intelligence agencies tell want know. yeah, average joe like totally knows do. China's stats unrealistic. They're relatively in-line various countries actually took virus seriously.

Do think India took virus seriously? Comparable population. know, realistic outcome part - of, 1.44 million cases.

We've got people caring wearing mask right wing militant carrying AR protest. Mask = oppression, random stranger military gear head toe AR Glock = freedom. fucking stupid. wrong, nothing identity, question language. say English American tourists flocking Wisconsin, word American sense going somewhere implies foreign destination, case. wrong, nothing Obtuse pointing wrong, especially country 1/3 know island apart US. get uptight someone calls Puerto Ricans ""immigrants"" not, moved one part country another part. like one confirmed case 39 presumed positive (presumed count case btw) Hell, January. Even listening songs came then, trying put pre-COVID mindstate, difficult. high false negative rate tests. Someone probably positive left. possibly gotten infected. I've always puzzled 2nd waves bad ? first impression people likely take proper measures (distancing, handwashing, masks, etc.) ones infected 1st wave, therefore either dead immune 2nd wave. guess 2nd wave feeds people good 1st wave, become weary required measures they've stuck longer tolerate ? indeed, clusters also located communities like orthodox jew communities antwerp muslim communities well. 
This means spread whole country rather communities people respect lockdown infected instead wide spreading country. believe mean ""always been"" use parlance time $30 would, especially they're sticking people telling stay home. America gone crazy, well always guns around, guns around bites arse. feel 'good guys guns'. Bumblefucks 😂 did, last week. AMA. feel like describes lot shows.

Just checked, yep, Fox pitched three seasons. MO seems. pneumonia deaths compared previous years (outside coronavirus deaths) Florida. I've seen way (like 400%) Defund BBC dont...dont use fucking water. I've sprayed multiple times (work) water fucks whole life up. Food joy left life. Maybe change lead diet. mind. Dude minds! One issue viruses hit different people different intensities different times. Like, long ago, minor “cold” gf didn’t pay much attention usually do. Three days later lay bed severe fever, it’s likely virus didn’t bother much.

I don’t know exact figures influenza likely, lot people don’t really get sick it. Quite do, die.

That’s good thing pandemic: least, lot people become aware transmit diseases we’re careful, sometimes end badly. this, lots people would go work sick, using public transportation spreading whatever infected with.

Now, idiots keep that. “It’s slightly worse flu bro” Americans need auto transportation get work, food, family. necessity.

Guns serve vital purpose, minds paranoid, criminal, harassed gun nuts/criminals. sure joking real.. real cheap swill. Idiots really coincidence. stable genius said would disappear like magic. right. thinking 1000 cases per day state. Either way, good many seem think ""sucks them"" go business like nothing going on.

Yet countries dozen cases lock everything down, IMHO way done.  Looks like Dallas needs federal stormtroopers.

If read article again, *dont* see Tegnell saying ""We locked down"".

""Sweden's top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said Wednesday *room improvement* country's softer approach controlling COVID-19 pandemic countries want learn South Korea, New Zealand Taiwan, necessarily Sweden.

There could billion factors play. Diet. Genetics. Weather conditions. ""Anger God?"" knows?

It seems Covid much severe countries lots old obese people. solution could ""dont get old/and also way deaths comparable neighbors. 

And *they* way fewer deaths tons countries lock down. way around #60 - 70 death rate. maybe question ""Why Norway Finland amazingly?""

Maybe lying deaths? Isnt everybody says death tolls arent high would like? Maybe conspiracy Denmark, Finland Norway make Sweden look bad keep numbers throwing bodies Baltic Sea hide failed properly protect vulnerable people

I agree this. made key policy changes could reduced deaths thousands perhaps. would nothing really criticize Sweden, comments like saying ""oh expendable anyways, would've died soon anways"". Imo that's inhuman also attempt cover mistakes done.

I hate people like rewrite quotes. didnt say anything like that.  

The old weak ones suffer *any* virus like this. *course* hits hardest. makes disease ""more serious"" hits *more* demographics that. COVID not, significant degree. dangerous old people, obese people, weak/ill people. lot kinds people country going see deaths Coronavirus hits you. poorer country many obese people, fragile people tend grow old, wont get hit note, always think remarkable people throw together Sweden countries like Italy Spain hit right beginning far less time prepare.

Fine. compare 2 - 

Sweden. 10 million people. lockdown. 5,700 deaths.

Michigan. 10 million. Lockdown. 6,400 deaths.

Quebec. 9 million. Hard lockdown. (And similar socialized health system / pay stay home) 5,600 deaths.

Point is, beginning message clear. ""If country shutdown, flooded hospitals, BODIES street!""

In reality .. Sweden demonstrates country shut adopts measures, come handful (5 6) weak/old people succumbing every group 10,000. flooded hospitals. bodies street. probably wouldnt even notice wasnt news.

I can’t believe even social issue states. Brings back newgrounds/albinoblacksheep days argument dude. first good news linked Corona! two aspects. one ardent gun control supporters point bad guy gun. Others point (ostensibly, don’t details beyond paragraph) good guys guns supports position good guys guns make dangerous situations safer. gun control advocates say situation wouldn’t bad enough need gun solve bad guy prevented getting one, then... People definitely contagious symptoms, last 2–4 weeks even longer. Health experts sure long people mono stay contagious symptoms gone, seems spread infection months that. Then, virus stays dormant (inactive) body rest person's Sometimes dormant virus ""wake up"" find way person's saliva (spit). person might feel ill show mono symptoms, spread virus people. there's small chance people mono past pass others, even feel OK.

[Source via Oh I'd bet $1000 right season wont finish. said day finally announced restart. remorseful mistakes

There's difference making mistake something plain stupid doctors statistics tell past 5 months. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. would anyone give sympathy covid hoaxers anti maskers virus, prior getting spewing bullshit lacked compassion many people across country told kinds gatherings safe precautions taken

From who, government/Trump? entity urged people inject Lysol bloodstreams gain immunity covid told country stop many tests making numbers look bad? entity basically said ""fuck science"", schools reopening fall? people rather listen government, agendas (cue sarcasm), despite bullshit last months, science, deserve sympathy get infected. 

Also, something legal doesnt mean right stupid fuck. People need learn think use common sense, blindly listen people, especially politicians, say. privacy??? went window social media. mean look much information people voluntarily put there. Can’t Czechia? Found another idiot. becomes obvious Corona absolutely harmless health person. Countries high fatality burden check health system.

I like example Singapore. 300 000 healthy foreign workers concentrated dormitories 12 people one room. Nearly 50 000 got infected. None died. banning guns country stop people acquiring them. one way another find hands bad people. like drugs win plague inc. also recognize contracts cosmic infallible rule upheld circumstances emergencies unforeseeable acts God. Kicking renters can't pay cause far worse problems alternative actual *good* alternatives feds paying rent unemployed renters small-time landlords teaming banks property management companies positive effects. Dude, everything America like this. We're hundreds thousands people getting evicted, due unemployed pandemic, call around asking signing new rental lease, they'll want proof income, last two pay stubs. 
Where people going go now? There's plenty people care, people charge seem to. 
Things get better anytime soon. This. 

Then factor risks public transport. China's **millions** cases, where's evidence? one billions Chinese, hundreds thousands expats China, blown whistle? China's export case statistics low? EU think safe open visitors China? think know better Europe's intelligence agencies?

China's stats unrealistic. They're relatively in-line various countries actually took virus seriously. rules 1, 5, 8, rule 4 kinda feels ambiguous. Maybe there's additional concern speculative content backseat governance, addressed much directly rule 4 currently written.

You bring moderators. 

It's hard draw line pleases everyone. open political debates sub, it'd become another cesspool people arguing politics, pushing political agenda, spreading conspiracy views. go /r/China_flu subs get taste discourse like.

All largely boils fact many people tendency behaving nicely comes topics that's can't nice things. German, I'm perfectly fine people owning guns - long stored certified gun range can't carried around, otherwise situations like become inevitable. fair deaths may lower expected better treatments available lot people getting sick right younger people. Obviously we'll never truly know many die COVID-19 there's reason assume they're lying. Dude, *entire world* shut try stop COVID, still already matched annual flu deaths 5 months spare.

How see difference. Normal Flu Corona? Surely whatever flaws Corona Testing present normal flu well? many dead? An, far away. country seems able take lock one month let alone one year.

Think doomed. Opening state state next door still unsafe, like toddling bed house next door fire. that's despite lockdowns mask wearing. Imagine whole world treated like Bolsonaro, Trump López Obrador. number would way, way higher, even accounting underreporting. Yeah us americans learn history ever. mean...we're basically repeating late 1920's/early 1930's Germany right so....yeah. learn. many unaccounted deaths developing countries.

This hilarious, trump? feds shipping infected prisoners tin foil head says want us die seize island. Masks probably required travel since huge spreader, bet hand shaking out, US never really went masks required week ago businesses mandated it. I've seen stores lax actually enforce it.

It's respiratory virus; die without people infect. Rich business owners trouble hiring back minimum wage workers 600 benefits. don’t think answer cutting benefits, think answer rich people pay real living wages instead 7 bucks hour. lmao 50 million.

Can confirm. longer excess mortality Sweden, it’s actually lower average last two deaths almost zero. see happens second wave comes. Sounds great, cost time availability? 

Sounds like accidental find, although lot testing needed. Says sure works dark seems UV activated, maybe light killing virus (lol?). Plus says sure toxicity material... might know showed lockdowns ridiculous. Right, far baseball concerned holding everyone less 100% sure means many players games' quality affected. stinks one two starters DL. going insane one team actually gets hit hard.

The potential health impacts players get another wrinkle. Again, baseball side, missing several guys 6 weeks condensed season greatly diminishes product field. 

Regardless personal aspects realizing players people too, right forced get sick reason... actual baseball brand / product suffers management current climate. pisses end started shit official word ""masks help"".

Why fuck would that? that, well people go spending feel safe. vaccine answer subset people don’t want end.

I've seen videos science deniers pull guns people asking wear masks.

I want everyone wear mask public, especially doors. whole point public safety. bad people going shoot good people instead, kind defeats point public safety wearing masks. That's subjective I’m Mass days I’m comfortable going emergency.

You don’t completely isolate like this. Criminals don’t follow laws. Thanks last results show 80 percent participants Moderna experienced side effects. healthy individuals bounce back, I’m sure side effects would majority population. 

“As groups others push ahead final phase testing, it’s vital public clear balanced understanding work—one cuts marketing hype. we’re good start. evidence far suggests we’re getting blinkered groups’ PR, seduced stories amazing speed we’re losing track everything else. particular, neither mainstream media medical press given much attention two vaccines’ potential downsides—in particular, risk nasty adverse effects, even they’re till Black Sabbath, sadly help remove pepper spray. There's lot nuance control always take away guns. People compare flu downplay show never going eradicated. contagious flu. guns owned unstable lunatics?
That's actual problem, responsible average joe.

you may cause problem directly, definitely stop counter arguing valid points people countries yearly gun dead eg Detroit alone (Germany). 
Just let sink owning guns also relatively big here, least rural germany also think lives people clean planes. clean themselves. Essential worker mean, oh ignore people die cares.

Fuck off. work major airline literally considered essential worker federal government. Ah, I’ve seen soho without masks, they’ve bars/restaurants. Haven’t noticed much central, might paying attention. trying make room least could stay home watching tally /s 

Edit: /s talking about? Gun controllers keep trying introduce legislation like semiauto rifle magazine bans, gun rights folks keep fight off. preserving liberty oppression. Stop using brain much, seems people like around parts. country? mean US? That's regular Tuesday, going hospital anything bankrupt even good insurance. LOL, thought administer tests they're important? They're important revenues generate.

You guys hopeless actually believe shit saying. 

Taking advantage system negative positive thing. It’s path people either choose accidentally guided take. jerk ”morals” want, can’t criticize others taking opportunity presented with, running it. unreasonable question, quoting officials AstraZeneca UK Health Ministry. wasn’t opinion piece. regrets sleeping around youth. judgement safely, I’d rather okay amount sex one clean person lot sex god knows what. individuals businesses ignoring hygiene regulations. Germany, companies hit 5,000 Euro fine ignoring hygiene regulations. want increase 25,000 Euros. mean, we're honest, fat deaths weigh us even more? Corona-humor? soon? 😬 encase virus kills us all, still live. 🤣 OK, going use small words puppets:

Just. Because. They. Have. A. Special. Territory. Status. Doesn't. Mean. They. Aren't. Part. Of. The. USA.

Edit: see post history also coronavirus conspiracy theorist bunch stupid shit. clearly intelligent enough write full sentences, credulous nutcase. waste space. Can't find online ffp3 things might happen, conflict escalation like actually fairly common. sort person mindset need firearm times public, exactly kind person likely believe pulling firearm appropriate response minor conflict. all, maybe even minority, frustrating CCW community refuses acknowledge people exist common ranks. 
 
You see actually read DGU reports hardcore 2A people like quote. Tons people stopping burglars muggers - either situations would resolved without shooting guns, people brandishing guns win argument. culture problem. sat around far many times listening people fantasize situations get use gun, always shocking low bar is. sorry hear this! lockdown skeptics coming woodwork virus resurging. wish virus would go away never hear talking points again.


Please everyone wear mask! can't can't anymore! 🤣  ones like this, get people care about.

And take seriously even then. could close family member die it, get mild case, take seriously. hospital ICU they'll realize serious. There's feasible way completely remove every single Firearm American circulation, sure stop legal purchase stop criminals gaining access them. Case point happened Canada couple months ago. use love United States. trying move years. 2016 woke side America I’d always sheltered from. longer wish move there. Schools overwhelmingly state funded. Federal contributions amount 9% school revenue high end. federal penalty would hurt schools, absolutely crippling.

That also disregards idea schools may 'open' partially accomodate ESL, SPED small population at-risk children order cheat system.

I think many states top-down freeze schools opening, would shocked majority urban suburban schools start online least a/b schedule way things going. could said wanted say way could heard, since never learned [...]

Ah yes, typical formulaic Reddit argument: Person makes radical statement (""if go church, deserve die without medical care!""), Person B disagrees, gets downvoted, Person C results ad hominem gets upvoted.

Can't admit wanting people die going church bit messed up. proud American right now. /s still go holiday. holiday involves travelling another country going plane. lowering amount guns time. magic fix country. actually agree point, way making it. plenty countries laws limiting guns gun violence issues country. obviously they've able something works. country, however, built guns. legitimately way protect first couple hundred years country. means going take lot longer lot effort fix. Unfortunately, issue fixed four year time periods. would take huge majority country actually making decision make change. system government built way. 

Again, I'm actually civilian gun ownership moment, even though currently gun. mainly see fix coming country anytime soon. There's many issues way polarized anybody get anything done. criminals worry about. Career criminals money. unhinged fellow citizens get emotional fast issue. thing Dallas illustrates. There's reason guy, going bar, easy access type weapon. responsible gun owner, weapon would home gun safe. can't speak laws Texas know states cannot carry gun bar. lose license that. Weird, I’m living Japan still see people don’t bother wearing masks. Even worse, see people wearing masks days. going salary limits last time gets checks? heard rumor going lower salary limit fewer people got stimulus, none articles read talk salary cut-off stimulus checks. take nerf gun, tough guy thing changed perspective conspiracy theories opening eyes get educated credited news sources. entire life changed height vaccine/autism debate. pregnant first 7 years ago, got pulled rabbit hole misinformation vaccines fully believed helped cause autism. caused turn start researching even wasn’t life, daughters. started reading news science articles accredited sources. 

Also, asked pediatrician, straight “do vaccines cause autism? I’m afraid.” professionally elegantly explained genetics “autism” was, it’s whole range disabilities. never questioned science that. fact, helped open eyes lot shit. However, still believe always believe US involved 9/11 way we’re led believe. Won’t change mind one. Recent events past 4 years boosted lack confidence trust government. really conspiracy theory anymore though? US government shady fuck.

I can’t speak every conspiracy theorist know lot us simply read reading get involved groups hive mind takes over.. surely groups hundreds women can’t wrong, right? takes one perfect timing thing completely unravel years believing false science information. Getting away groups enforce thinking like also key. Conspiracy theories tend huge groups people believing one thing. contrary. guy willing murder many nothing. disregard law fundamental human morality, would unarmed stricter society? really annoys first priority panic folk: 'there evidence transmission cat humans' - fucking virus, get human cat get cat human. Gonna need stats one chief. annual Swedish lockdown, aka summer holidays. schools summer, crazy percentage people traditionally take whole month July off, socialising takes place largely outdoors, risk infection much lower. Even beaches islands crowded are, I'm confident net positive. I’ve middle it. is. you’ve social clique based going out, drinking, getting laid, certain elements gossiping following day, repeat... get idea. give money corrupt PPP program 1200 checks people don’t need it?

While definitely huge issues PPP program. many, many small main st businesses able keep people employed program. throw baby bathwater one. needs monitored closely better oversight, still lot good. 

As $1200 people need it. vast majority money immediately went economy much small businesses.  People used go buy things. benefits businesses, turn helps keep people employed. whether people need it, putting little boost economy keeping money flowing businesses turn keeps people employed. know plenty people ""didn't need it"", used go local surfshop buy surfboard/wetsuit went local pro shop bought golf clubs, went local bike shop bought new mountain bike. sales local shops making everyone tightening giving people money make purchases like exactly need save small shops going time. Yes believe probably could started asking protesters get lawn began brandishing weapons happen. spanish flu killed 50 million people worldwide millions states. protests, anti-maskers everything else we're seeing today. 

We learned nothing.  burst bubble Google employees pretty valuable, losing one pretty big deal expect many companies follow hard find exact proof, definitely vary state/country, numbers confirmed cases come actual test positive, guess attending physician. Hence cases numbers lag - takes time death confirmed covid. 

Now, agree bit “nursing home patient multiple strokes dies happens covid” kinda counts misrepresents situation slightly Americans fucked right though. Anerica exceptional this, probably country gun history. Guns rooted america trying remove would cause giant profits black market. bought fanny pack H&amp;M... :-/ Likely true. However, people need eat right need place live. Right need little stability anything ""Fatphobic"" banished everyone's vocabulary. nothing empowering fat, all. miserable human fat (I still since lost alot weight, BMI 37 now). 

Its wonder disease chances kill fat people, bodies struggling cope extra weight us. honestly terrified disease can't wait reach healthy BMI. who’s snowflake? How...? fists dangerous firearms? clearly distressed although last while, forever. community volunteering do? may social aspect knowing good may help you. Yup! Mind matter!

Lol quite. takes one good shot small caliber kill someone. Although, heavier caliber, faster fire rate ammo really makes things easier. didn’t understand anything sorry poor thing! That’s terrible know different kinds scientists right? Statistically, yeah, that's true.

But anytime wide variety cases, going get fall outside likely norms. masks also one many mitigation techniques, they're guarantee. 

So sort like asking ""I thought wore seatbelt, injured crash?"" still true seat belts reduce injury, absolutely still people injured dead wore seatbelts too. ""We Knew Getting Into""

And proceeded stupid anyway. time motto ""Land Free, Home Brave"" replaced. correct.  It’s parties pass shit, equal responsibilities. Pelosi ain’t looking you! research leads different results. Predictions overblown covid19 well. Many eu countries based lockdown N. Fergusons simulations/predictions, clearly overblown. predictions overblown past well, BSE predicted 2.2 million corona deaths USA 500,000 UK ""if measures taken"" - measures adhere stepped back btw.  Anti COVID people tend really fall like “muh second amendment rights” people, wonder why. False, HK-China border control. think governed China central government, covid-19 response lax China's. example, travellers quarantine government facility, instead self quarantine residence. That's lot words ""fat shaming."" think people upset well News 15th century, Remember let cruise ship dock want ""the numbers"" go up? Pepperidge Farm remembers. think that. true None, difference. I'm conservative believe shit. right, difference round us kill us all. would make everything better. There's couple quotes made think  
'There winners knife fight' 'The loser knife fight dies street, winner ambulance' anyone get tested rule COVID? sounds terrible. Hope you’re feeling better worried things? Yeah, unlikely happen, experience fear insecurity intruder threatening loved ones home, guess change mind. Gun ownership security alarm purchases drastically rise home owner victim violent crime. tell everything need know. problem can't force shit. ""God given right"" stupid things like this. can't force things deny things.

Although see point making illnesses worse such. Brainwashed truth. Nokay. Good him. Can't say many leaders. Lead example took lil Rona get going going. 💪 Sounds kinda hot!

Apart cramping oozing genitals, suppose... Lived Texas life. love last years really highlighted parts hate. Mostly willful, proud ignorance. 

Looking move things settle bit think would depend meant 'Spain' terms handling pandemic. think Spanish government contend European nations, far pandemic control goes.

In general, Spanish people socialise lot, talk lot, talk loudly, stand close touch everybody time (the true Italian culture). European cultures act like this. Spanish culture great breeding ground type infectious disease, compared European governments, Spanish government always going change population's behaviour going reduce spread coronavirus. Ask friend precautions they're taking.

Will require masks?

Will people socially distanced times...but especially eating drinking?

Will physical contact forbidden except within household? (Meaning dance one brought you.)

Will require hand sanitizing everyone arrive?


How bathroom situation handled? area live usually doors unlocked open summer. visitor comes around invite cup tea chatting.

I dont want live area possible. Also, app able recognize exposed hospital? care Covid + patients PPE would want distinguish exposed hospital vs outside hospital. called fat shaming: called impactful way influencing somebody get motivated get healthy exercising, eating well, etc. Sure, understand peoples' cases able lose weight due medical conditions, hormone imbalances, etc., mean can't eat well least. Commercials like Halo Top ice cream glorify fat people ""should lose weight"" ""should skip dessert"" continue eat unhealthy. pisses off. Totally. Dose medicine. Especially fatality rates Home Alone style martial arts really hate line argument pandemic scared, stressed exhausted perfect time self-improvement self-education. everyone spoons that, okay. Treating someone's life like one's personal toy perfect metaphor current state conservative politics. man forcibly given coronavirus via injection eyeballs testicles Oh I’m sure support groups right incredibly popular.. that’s scientific study I’ve seen. You’re actually claiming time you’ve ever lied argued bad faith? Hah! Nice one, truther, actually made laugh loud one  That's joke. Maybe ones plane? need Hawaii's data? Pretty sure covid already widespread Africa. barely noticeable Africans fall high risk age groups everyone else IFR barely makes dent existing high mortality rate. Walmart shoppers sometimes employees. sometimes entire meal. think fucking gross. *poke poke* we. Trump get numbers matter what. stop testing falsify numbers. American government whole wants silence issue.  thinking global scale, since lot countries vehicle laws US does, pulled data [here, admit old data mean, I've heard tons black conservatives. assume carrying AR-15 around everywhere goes, conservatives do? bunch CCW people engaged bar, sounds downright Real Murcan me. fact whole thing like conservative's wet dream - one man standing liberty oppressive tyranny Nanny State - others disagreeing participating Marketplace Ideas. live ammunition. Everyone fending themselves. Law Jungle. Stop talking start Vote.

Sure, we'll ignore everything GOP suppress people's votes. /s feel important smart. I'm less worried children's health. part examples serious side effects. opinion 1/1000 children dying definitely many think I'm okay 1/10000 either. probably realistic number. 
I'm worried support staff teachers. Teachers largely aging demographic. evidence yet, one silly enough try it. Give month half good I'll hundreds test cases. always sort avoid possibly deadly situations, told one million chance stabbed going favorite restaurant would simply go. super low chance I'd get stabbed, might. Yep. newly learned information, recommend trust completely, confirm everything wrote yourself. Thanks that. Man cant compete that.

You win safety coffins bell myth, there's verified proof saving anyone there's enough air casket minutes life. ever rung doubtful helped anyone. zombies come haitian stories, no?  didn’t even bother planting false evidence Iraq, took pictures cylinders called WMDs Pandemic felt US since mid-March schools businesses closed. 4 months week. Alongside ban adverts 9.00 p.m. (2000 GMT), food deals plans calorific content meals displayed menus, government also launch consultation displaying calories alcohol. 

Mandatory calorie labels alcohol would huge. Imagine everybody knew single shot tequila 150 calories, IPA's calories per drink beers. **googles ur dad** amazing much things keep circling back that... jars urine. Basically body needs months get virus control. replicating like crazy. Trump lost popular vote. We're democracy. People talking voting. making noise.  America country, largely fancy way saying group people live common area sort underlying government.

No need die arbitrary thing.

I would also argue America *has* changed time. America, slavery illegal women vote. Yes, America long way go equality (as much world), made progress time.

Progress always linear, dark times like Trump's reign hopefully dips upward progression.  Remember Trump accused China hiding That's everything accuses others of, would himself.

**G**aslight  
**O**bstruct  
**P**roject

I'm joking all. guess know Vanity Fair magazine 90s. lot research work goes reporting (they actual investigative reporting example, supposed lack thereof usually knock MSM conservatives) implore read article great one. Land free... really, secret.  cares WHO?!?! sure. Gen X’ers sane ones? Lol linguistics best guy, Noam

what mind german always wanted guns quite like visit shooting range work shoot bit breezes storys like dont make easy argue pro gun. Weird thought United States sovereign nation don’t take orders WHO...

I also seem remember Trump withdrawing WHO, guess like crazy ex can’t accept break pretend never happened much news me. read blackface barbecue even blink explanation acusations China reminiscent build Irak war WMD's.

Witnesses claims never taken face value whenever there's greater geopolitical picture look at. account witnesses far China's acusations human rights tend go. Even salaries crap things barely work, 1.3 billion people difficult 2nd biggest economy. One western myths China think long term. Anyone spent time China quickly realises that's true. look recent political blunders. disagree. believe knew could happen likely would happen, planned it. 

Modern life Corruption ruined plans, look design, pretty solid centuries old. know lot viruses, could explain people testing positive previously 'recovering'? Re-activation opposed reinfection? tf kind person EATS public restroom?? would go to? point, would take you? He's gotta build wall something. Jeez.... puntended Goebbels Shoppers need quit shopping entertainment purposes stay fuck home. absolutely must go out, put mask nose pie hole. Idk removed comments answered correctly, no, happen. Byrd Kennedy poor health died office, took months Franklin seated. effectively 60 votes short period time.

Also, Lieberman caucused them, fought came public option.  Yeah, absolute opposite shocked pikachu face LGBT communities seeing government downplay, mismanage, blame victims dangerous virus. sad story, made sadder fact turn gofundme cover costs treatment. like tactics! Saw post dude recently going commando beach I'm at. That's pretty decent tactic, too! Well Texans gotta enjoyed freedoms. Can't make wear masks. Australia here. flu rates 98% year. hand washing social distancing paid off.  Except decided HHS going get info run private company - mean it’s subject open records requests.  able automate.

TBH think endgame, difference rich person money possibly spend lifetime. Rich people smart, greedy immoral, think desperately trying maintain power since know come soon. extent endgame suck country dry fuck first world country spend winnings in, leaving US rot conquered.

The civil war already began, rich started killing. matter time people actually start fighting back. Money says start banning anyone posts I'm curious Hague ever denounced China's Uighyur concentration camps Half plans already implemented California, like putting calories menus restrictions junk food marketing. Finland

Has term limit two terms 6 years limits nothing stop corruption, look Russia them, Vlad basically got rid them.

What kind non-argument this? ""Term limits work removed""? basically force country choose new head every 2 terms (US) possibly destabilize country.

That's exactly point. longer head-honcho time implant system harder oust later.  mitigation Covid blocks Flu well, neither personal concern.    China openly admitted stopping testing mid February.  
  
And even testing limited Wuhan people travelling provinces. 
  
Spread lies elsewhere.  
  
Since multiple massive spread get caught. like everything politicized towards polar opposite agreed upon unanimously. packed information gathering B. fucking semi intelligent primates decide things button B button now? rest alphabet exists, meaning problem big solve, lets bring fucking B button decide whether choices fucking B? Well fuck that. I'm making music. ""It's happening can't see it"" ""I wish well."" American states stand idle TENS THOUSANDS infections per day recorded.

How many cases recorded? (Asymptomatic, false negatives, etc)

WHY??????? Less data = less death. Remember China exactly earlier year thought dystopia? Thank this, got ton stuff I'll use. 

Everyone wears masks, necessarily call good PPE. think saw list ranking types PPE somewhere, stuff we've got definitely bottom 3 4, bandana, least one hospitals around washing paper masks re-use, guess could worse. That's many states reopen right now. think u r referring them. Planes theoretically pretty okay **googles ur mom** *Shame*. protect virus. Wear mask, whenever possible minimize contact others, practice good hygiene sanitation (wash hands). note steps proven effective reducing person's risk getting infected.

Also protect mental health. Find ways keep busy safely. Set goals work towards goals. Reconnect friend via Zoom, nice long call someone. would like note obese also risk factors.

There saying boat safest harbor, that's designed for. feel like saying applies here. rational afraid virus. also rational educate power avoid contracting virus. said, accept risk things do. Accepting best, rest luck powerful antidote uncertainty. 

I wish luck brother. Remember, Vaccines coming. Stay strong. mnuchin member senate? wanna see one ""elites"" contact trace case south Florida.

They got easy. It’s germ, dr faucet idea he’s talking able open Halloween! eminence front generation. kids alright, get fooled again. OP could lot worse. anger justified. Yeah world well. favorite scene one today's games showed closeup manager (I think Indians'), wearing mask pushed nose. No. That's get Covid. That's nice. can't even go check mail throw away trash without half dozen assholes breezing without masks on. bc bitter lol. **googles nobody gives shit** said accelerated decline. steep decline began much election. already u/Thatdudedoesnotabide, say concerning nearly 150,000 dead Americans hands? one people. exotic animals. Remember Mad Cow? look war....

wait. 

fuck. Doesn’t contradict said examples summer camps large breakouts? Among young kids? Really? I'm unaware any.

It's matter ""when, if"", children physiologically different adults ways make less likely spread particular virus.

More accurately, chance X goes terribly tons kids die. alternative chance secondary effects (poor education, depression/anxiety, child abuse, etc.) catastrophic. 

I believe odds far greater X based currently available science. someone actual evidence beyond yelling, gut feelings, votes, I'd love read it. Yup wish people would stop placing blame “young people”. It’s like...fuck you. cried haircuts? could manned leaders kept bars closed. Young people wouldn’t flooded back bars leaders balls close them.

So yeah, fuck young people blaming. bet actually false. honestly bet majority real conspiracy theorists level mental illness fact rather intelligent.  

They make connections detached enough reality can't see connection work, smart enough see it.  

Basically, think government get them, example, smart enough find proof government get detached enough able ignore proof breaks down..for example government really reason get them.

Sure, bunch bandwagon morons certain types theories, probably significantly morons make fun morons happened believe person explained truth.  referencing concealment ambiguous reporting china provided early on. Gay, voted Trump, believed coronavirus conspiracy.

Bye Felicia. 👋🏼 forget, ""I know God forgiven me"" PR needs finally become state, stupid point Yeah boyfriend boys luve here. Downstairs kitchen living room right outside loving room doorway office. Upstairs 2 bedrooms bathroom. Upstairs huge. okay 2 boys room 2 needs, nightstand them, love seat, entertainment center desk plus toys stuff there's still room play. Tim king dude bed, train bed, entertainment center, vanity mini fridge. Plus there's still room walk boys play. Honestly bad owner complete dick gives shits anyone. Here's run many housekeepers since I've here. Plus listen acts like boyfriend trying fuck time know we're talking about. expects work he's there, he's after. care I'm sick. got shitty baby emergency surgery taken children's hospital. got 4 days him. list long. Plus gives family time all. even one day week. get paid shit. would trust international team virologists geneticists. Biden want poor healthcare, that's neglectful continue killing lot people. last count put American healthcare system killing 68,000 people year afford healthcare. Yeah unneeded since evacuating effective plan. time explored maybe work kind thing, studies done that. Turns much good point trump still publicly endorsing even claiming taking apparent reason. think opinion specifically guided anyone's treatment, made look like moron. I’d love knowledgeable matters. news really talk it. good sources follow? Like maybe get subscription “newspaper”? So... North Korea virus guy entered... tried blame south? Yep. US 4% world's population around 25% cases. bad. What?! .... going flee *to* North Korea??? mention flu bad.. think ought something it?! Put cap back glue, pal. Uh, live Cali? You’re describing I’ve seen LA since March, way tonight. We’re 4 days season, don’t see going continue. legitimately think someone going seriously hospitalized die.

They’re already saying redsox pitcher heart issue developed COVID. Likely myocarditis.

4 starters marlins got taken one swoop. 

The majority players wearing masks dugouts, they’re flying across country week? 

It’s matter time team 10 starters sick once.

I love baseball, they’re right madness. Reverse UNO could get mad people going bars, open? spreading it.  Gotta believe three known cases many move. way. number cases per day grown quite slowly. Good take lot people sick dying wake people indifferent ignorant. 

Remember majority's opinion LGBTQ rights changed people came out, sudden one nearly every extended family. care LGBTQ rights kid, sibling, nephew. 

Similar thing happened AIDS. Reagan said ""those boys brought themselves"", pal Rock Hudson died it, problem.

Remember seniors Tea Party demanding across-the-board government spending cuts, someone mentioned government SS checks. 

Just like mayor Jaws, many people care problem swims bites proverbial ass. want cynical, areas seen rising cases recently also ones obviously bad death reporting (there's correlation here, obviously). HIV latent infection, hides cells. less infectious hiding. like Herpes, way infectious symptoms means virus hiding replicating So....north Korea already covid tried blame south Korea it...by pinning defector defected south ,raped someone South Korea defect south go back north.... Mind fuck...... minds everyone else free go live cave. I've seen many times people thinking right go they're sick *other people* stay home want catch it.

Like, exactly plan going everyone creating functional society can't safely leave home. don’t see can’t get mad haircut cryers, leaders young people going bars. don’t think blame go young people course blatantly ignoring social distancing excused? allowed go gun range without gun shoot guns? I’m familiar German rules know states go without gun shoot guns want to. denying left. Let's get ahead ourselves.... 🙄 USA done Latin America Philippines bad Europeans Africa

So fucked *most* tried jump conclusions whole HHS handoff, literally days later new cases plateaued actually started decreasing despite testing. 

So either a) states/hospitals trouble switching new system that's making numbers distorted (something mentioned might happen due switching systems middle crisis) b) they're flagrantly cooking books. 

Hard say which. Ford country sir.... got downvoted hell suggesting “high percentage” professional athletes careers ended catching COVID. 

That’s realized it’s far gone can’t say anything isn’t “we’re massively, incredibly, ridiculously, tremendously fucked” everything. think every time someone says excuse “take rights away forever”. tbh. middle ground taking seriously (which bad) like ""omg world ending"" Born raised South exaggeration absolute nonsense...unless you’re Mississippi...in case... suggestion?

- Make election days national holidays, explicit intent giving people opportunity go vote. Essential workers mail-in ballots.
- Make mail-in ballots available nationwide, excuse needed, indicate preference.
- Make sure one dis-enfranchised right vote, even criminals. still say country run.
- Reinstate Voting Rights Act, updated correct recent injustices access polls, poll distance, polling place density, etc.
- Redraw congressional districts states fairly, disallow gerrymandering.
- Finally, make voting mandatory, civic duty. Trump could learn thing two here. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

Kids show football camp signed waiver parent. dumb things done pandemic, jury duty dumbest.

I'm hotspot right waiting see get put jury. Glad guy asked swab cat's retropharynx. started spreading rapidly February never ""going away"". Sure places knocked it'll circulate around globe years. Even US quarantines designed eradicate disease, slow hospitals could prepare give time develop vaccine. patients 14 going time

Wait. mean people hooked 14 different IV bags simultaneously? get 14 medications one two IV bags?

Sure sound good, this. colleagues coping? can't imagine state affairs, even continue get worse, mentally physically sustainable much longer. Thanks comment, work doing.  let's add 'Paralysis' growing list horrifying shit virus do. Along permanent loss smell taste. immunity it. Random strokes young people. Honestly 'asymptomatic' cases 20 years become paralyzed? fucked up, half planet becoming paralyzed.

  got something like 100k gofundme. expect try pivot appearances Fox News conservative media. would say grammar accurate Nurses need get hell working covid die. Lots us waiting home hospitals literally sacrifice us. That’s called sociopath. That’s like learning English living Scotland. Yes it’s great teach gealic able survive modern world need able speak one world languages English, Spanish, Russian Chinese. ppl want children fail? AI like one first detect coronavirus spreading China I’m fifties agree you. Don’t forget shit generation older left guys with—housing, climate, gig economy, etc etc. Yeah exactly. 

They're like Fox News, relationship.

But bad thinking fox initially. South Korea starting slowly resume normal life. happens vigilant Covid actually work control rather YOLOing ending going nowhere 6 months see left supports censorship.

Covid-19 President, hope reaches every Man, Women Child.

Edit: guess America still ready Women President.

I weak person could resist.

Edit: Come know maximized comment offended. disappointed? People want complete gun ban act like live safe country that's occasionally interrupted violence. ignore myriad ways we're different civilized countries, like fact police routinely murder citizens blame us it. gun ban would likely effective preventing mass shootings, would lot less drastic restrictions.

On hand, idea we'll take arms tyrannical government obviously bluff. war guns, without them, either. It’s wearing masks. It’s wearing masks, tons spontaenous closures businesses keeping certain businesses closed entire time, therefore destroying industries. It’s year+ gimped education, year+ cultural enrichment like museums travelling (probably 5 years you’re US), year+ shamed something trivially human seeing friends hugging parents. It’s year+ ~20% unemployment (great depression peaked 25%). It’s year+ bans reusable bags, year+ throwing disposable masks oceans.

We’re destroying world, economy, culture ways cannot possibly comprehend. much bigger “just masks months get it” I'll watch em, little man. throw link. It’s fairly clear anyone pays attention healthy is, majority America fall category. 40% Americans obese 8-10% asthma, strongly increase risk COVID. mention even people don’t show ill effects potential long term issues. Acting like isn’t risk significant portion population ignorant. Deaths COVID approaching totals WW1 Vietnam combined 5 month span. didn’t get high school, you? well Mainland Chinese hate masks well want even think it. Every weekend Houston people piling top bars masks on. be, economy fucked either way. Trying explain parents likely cheaper long run pay everyone 2k/month &amp; freeze mortgages across board 2-4 months stay fuck home get ahead goes head. absolutely convinced lead US communism destroying country whole. 

It's beyond frustrating. one study, pre-print server less (it peer reviewed yet). also worth noting model based infecting unfortunate and/or stupid (those frequently exposed bad luck, choice \[freedumb\]) - basically need reach immunity smaller percentage population still reaching high percentage among subset get exposed. means frequent exposure subset would need continue social isolation similar guidelines order stay it. study indicate life return normal herd immunity threshold met; start see less active cases subset. infection rate would still spike subset changed behaviors join subset. effective vaccine ... everyone get it, players everyone else wants able to, *should* make huge difference 🍀🤞🍀 CDC official guidelines less 10 people believe, personal preference keep 5 people less Jail less year, prison longer year. 

But even prison life, people actually died permanent injury still shitty situation could neen avoided better regulations guns ownship. misinformation spread?

Although might like interpretation, data squeeky clean.

Because cant give example spreading misinformation, made lie me, little one.

Which totally discredits everything said. ;) North korea, best korea Sadly, US, check like occurred, would considered invasion “freedoms” store gun kitchen countertop next kids highchair. argument could need moment murder bad guys invading home. Sure have, ignore fact 4 days 1000+ deaths last week. seen deaths 1000+ month got 4 row. Battery. ""Maybe took precautions take protect myself, family, society large, partner would still alive. hope live long life consequences choices, hope grow point it."" unified face towards nations keep much decision making local, generally speaking better people. really want federal government sticking fingers everything, areas intolerable states allow go way. Every nation make choice determine gets decided local level national level. 

There likely discussion adjustments handle pandemics future consequence this, response really depends pandemic viewed already passed. might viewed badly end toll known, problems may viewed tied specific people rather system itself, major changes system might appear warranted. I'm actually pleasantly surprised seeing ~2k readers subreddit 3 weeks. simple. Every attempt thus far pretend everything ""back normal"" backfired. gonna get start respecting virus? don’t blame anyone choosing money. That’s it’s bullshit unemployment taken away people get work.

That $1,200 check put every min wage worker country $15hr month goes out. make unemployment universal send checks whether working someone posted before. won’t real start “In memory lost “ school yearbooks. Tl:dr defected north. Maybe raped someone south going back north (maybe avoid Punishment, wanted question him) Wow. actually defend CCP believe anything say.  
  
I right, nothing worth taking to. US conservatives, general, nominated, elected still overwhelmingly support actual moron truly horrible person President... Wait. don’t spare nazi flats hanging around home? even? Idiocracy wasn’t malignant people that. like they’re looking buy havens climate change. ultra wealthy feel though essentially buy way catastrophes. Maybe they’re right.  legs sure are.  

YEA...I said it!!! could more, indicators Covid-19 could stick life. 20 years old 70 years old reason capitalism die. successful economic system world ever seen won’t die people stupid understand high school level economics.

Other aspects like healtcare however, hopefully accessible. stupid. want season, isolate players, coaches staff. want to? dont get paid play. bet would isolate.

We've seen already working MLB. work NFL either. defensive? guess weren’t part Coronavirus March big blow up. Seems like years ago now. anyone remember time 14 Players/Coachs/Staff team tested positive Influenza? even something extremely contagious like Norovirus (stomach bug)? see stories present themselves, letting air ""just another sickness"" theory... yet, doesn't.  No, everyone usa want. pretty expensive regularly shop amazon get groceries delivered. Super strict mask wearing yet still happening Japan Hong Kong. honest im surprised basic unemployment benefit low you. Personally think really would benefited national list/ranking contact tracers people caught outside household.  Parties indoor/outdoor would high list seems fact immediately put USA tier North Korea Saudi Arabia almost 200 countries world incredibly telling. young adults. Every age group something stupid. I’m threatening anyone. I’m identifying extant threat. Maybe language barrier getting way let state clearly: everyone’s problem. 

America giant economy, nuclear weapons, generates much world’s carbon either directly indirectly, large population deliberately created (through media brainwashing) morons vote world’s interests. problem. problem. everyone’s problem. across Atlantic help global warming really starts kick in. Without could use money paying debt, investing, extra spending money make much easier retire way earlier

*Could* key word. Given response many people simple act wearing mask save lives - many think would take extra money blow it? prepared let live street reach 65?

To SS basically way deal millions elderly homeless people. assume SS contributions basically charity them. nothing new vaccine given public end phase 3 trial? Good news exactly (as father severely immunocompromised 8 yo boy would like nothing with), also clearly catch-22. Far people seem possess ability take good news *and* keep guard up, stay smart. I'm glad u/Orisaaaaa currently days without deaths MI, seen sort news lead directly people sort wiping hand across forehead, saying 'whew! thank god *thats* over!' going right back old ways, road numbers start ticking again. love/hate relationship ""good news"". majority US looking solid trend good news late April early May, month later weren't. I'm glad areas country world *now* wel making progress, science hands game get us this, we've seen nothing else recent months/weeks many people take good news sort 'throw masks away return dry-humping strangers bars' announcement. around go, rinse repeeat. Reason #362 never use toilet looking bowl. see that's ""their problem."" 

They already gave handout, give more? complaining. savings fall back on? 

/s argument basically means everyone armed people exercise free speech fear. Chernobyl death count 1,6 million people estimated years, cover up, official stats like 26 deaths lmao, lying wikipedia states it, CORONA virus hidden deaths amplified 10x.  Yeah I've heard ""my friend nurse even swab anything comes positive"" many times over, too. Nurses bragging job well friends = whistle blower hero Also United States 6-9X times people, it’s easy. Voice reason. missing many. Many people can’t get fact affects everyone (ok maybe super rich parents bring private tutors/ nannies.....governesses like “The King I.” Okay, soo situation gunman use systemic terror means coercion?

Honestly, definition better someone trying push agenda terrorism plausibly argue lunatic conservative attacking mask-wearing liberals something. partying going cause outbreaks, areas party allowed open first place?

This regional chief passing buck Good thing mods remove low-quality posts.

This place would mess allowed old piece cherrypicked crap supports official narrative. need guns streets! Think much safer crowded bar full inebriated patrons would everyone lil law giver!! 1000 deaths day 400, overnight? way. figures manipulated. work home civil servants, let alone private sector workers literally stated fact. stuff I'm saying coming facts. Numbers paint whole picture, obviously

""Get high school diploma"" - cut education funding decades.

""don't kids till 21"" - cut Healthcare, sexual education, access birth control, try ban abortion...

""full time job"" - era employers often keep folks part time avoid benefits, cut wages low possible, quickly eliminating front line employees?

And union electrician, making $50+ hour, union monopoly trade. think heart right place, proven anyone reading really get it. might problem, privileged existence comes expense others. First, beware abuse buzz words like ""conspiracy theory"".

Second; pay attention obvious false alarm, there's smoke, there's usually fire.

Current evidence is, republicans democrats, especially leadership, propagate unfounded conspiracy theories then, idiots.

They're BIG Profits business corporate military gov't conspiracy theories today. starts BIG $ buying corporate military gov't representatives but, knew that. Basketball bubble best chance. way football goes.  would take 3 4 years ""herd immunity"" take effect. US 50k ICU beds. infection hospitalization ratio 2% need run 5 million people beds need 2-3 weeks each. would take 4 years, low end, assuming beds used 100% efficiently.

Herd immunity pipe dream. Hope vaccine. Fortunately that's one bright spot. virus detected Spain's sewage far back March 2019.

They ran single test said one sample sewage. test also false positive rate. Considering repeat tests places world show virus spreading early sewage, likely false positive. Probably thing that’s bipartisan point US: obesity denial.  ""Not political"" euphemism ""status quo-ist"".

Imagine grocery store getting called ""status quoist"" carrying tires office supplies. clearly want support status quo carrying food, makes easier people find food.

No, status quoist, countless political subs could using discuss political ramifications disease. /r/politics one, countless regional subs. people run /r/coronavirus want virus itself, people find information *about virus itself*. 

If ""everything political"" even really individual subreddits reddit. merge everything /r/politics, right? 

Or please subs dedicated discussing things category? once? Without goddamn noise pollution preventing finding important info? Remember prescription drug advertisements TV, unlike vast majority countries. get sold jingles stuff way one would sell laundry detergent. really despicable. 

Did kill guy? cares families, since going jail good baby... Breonna Taylor women got shot police breached wrong house?

If yes theory indeed useless. shame. Getting killed people whose job protect you. wouldn’t say human thing want downplay death count. would say opposite likely. hyper-focused one disease, like right now, would say anyone dying C-19 would likely listed dying disease even terminal disease.

In UK even worse. Anyone tests positive C-19 subsequently dies time reason, labeled C-19 death. could lead massive distortions odds dying within given year age cause, roughly similar odds losing bout C-19 well.

I agree million ways numbers could misrepresented. lies, damn lies, statistics. isn’t clear way would agree lack transparency. effort manipulate instead educate public. leads mistrust experts, politicians, authorities. $1,000 hurricane María hit island. see article showing Lake Chuck highest per capita numbers city country?! 

At least we’re winning something! Louisiana usually competition 49th Alabama Mississippi every list. /s Fox News cable channel Fox local network affiliate thing. buy wallmart.

We’re like meth-addict downstairs neighbor pissed dog prevents home robbed. university supposed using (or something like it) common surfaces fall. Yeah, saw CNN hospitalizations 23 percent children.. able find reliable data/articles back up.. anyone source please let know. cloth masks exhale ports - every one absolutely fake. There’s difference material behind port. cut through, nothing. 
I real VogMask, purchased wildfire smoke issues - functional port. designed protect person lung issues smoke, it’s useful viral pandemic. 
Anyway, feel little better exhale ports - almost fake. guess I'll depression while.

""I guess I'll diabetes while."" 
""I guess I'll cancer while."" 

Downplaying mental health impacts pandemic favors. Telling everyone disagree leave country anti-democratic, straight anti-American. United States founded idea different people different cultures coexisting thriving. diversity makes great country. people like you, think anyone different welcome, traitors. class. Me, too. Got many perfect attendance awards elementary school. Lots sniffling &amp; drippy noses class years. 

In community college remember taking test something 101/2 degree fever &amp; feeling like crap pretty bad headache, even got confirmed school health office, mom come get (I can't drive) hours work took aspirin &amp; either hung old admin building (where health office was) miserably went back regular school day. 

In November 2018 2019 HORRIFIC cough still went school with-the thing entirely like 2-3 days Thanksgiving! REALLY fucked hindsight knowing FLU manifest ""just"" cough. right, Hong Kong infecting Shenzhen, something needs done. Ok getting group five number? Everyone saying less ten. It’s impossible even know right thing besides hide guidance different location day day. get $400? Ive heard trump Mnuchin state want $600 reduced 70%. would near $180 pua get taxes taken somewhere $100 $120.

That's ontop unemployment. looking yesterday. went $650 week $668 month due switch. West Michigan spared worst pandemic far people living denial could happen too. 

Most people see mask wearing something debate disagree changing behavior whatsoever. 

We're ticking time bomb surprise outbreak would catalyst Whitmer moving back another phase reopening plan. $1,200 *month*.

At *absolutely bare minimum*.

Fuck you. police neighbors something? Sounds little far fetched believe always get someone harm. Bar full less capacity covid.

Edit: literally state video, dude. Phase 3 trials, vaccine (or drug, depending tested) reaches primary end point, participants control group (in case, placebo) offered vaccine well (or medication). Assault rifles illegal one legally owns one. too, crazy. seems hear new information daily 7 months this. People fat shame zoo big cats get it, stands reason automatic weapon shot bar. yeah. Germany's rules seem perfectly okay Ok boo mer no, see, would force senators actually *care* constituents. Let alone educating them, know Washington like educated citizen.  Wow. knew Walmart stated would require masks going shit show. People even put pants go there, never crossed mind. figured would lot hillbillies screaming rights, etc. enter store know requiring masks. Don’t get hopes Yesterday, NHL tested entire league (who bubble) 0 cases. Yep! virus isn’t harmless survive (e.g., trump puppets) would like believe. slowing down. Many hot spot states plateaued declining case/test positive rate (source: NBA’s measures within bubble extremely stringent cautious. don’t deserve compared MLB slightest. people probably intubating COVID-19 patients. program probably won’t kick call schedule brutal also live Appalachia...don't get started snake handling. know, surrendered lost war.

They've gotta change themselves, change. combination help persistence. know mean. Sounds like cult... Well take long. opportunity truly knock March May, every couple weeks would see news articles Marti Gras, Spring Break, Covid Parties.

This fault, shutdown meaningless, we're effectively back April again. \*slow clap\* fucks sake, no. Finally someone gets it. Freedumb ends endanger others. refuse accept scientific based advice improve health outlook suffer complications result then, yes, fault. Jamie Oliver healthy eating schools thing back mums afraid kids would starve eating vegetables showed schools pushed burgers junk food fence them. Hmm. Life never easy, tougher some. Glad exercises etc. Hopefully people start waking realize consumers power. Won’t happen. could already COVID. mention lot companies already outsource things like India. hear you. much want optimistic way everything gone -- I'm holding breath... Still happen. 

They killed nba March couple players Midichlorians course. Yeah hear ya, read im smoking window Montreal, saw 3 people walking nose out. 
I think vey accurate malicious, well, guess incompetence.  I'm saying minimum wage, defined ""starting point"" would gradual climb market would adjust equilibrium

How so? market like ours, supply labor vastly outweighs demand, would drive wages naturally increase? way see would balance supply demand change, never population growth continues exceed rate job take away power lower class assign value labor isnt market choose

The lower class power take away. class, large disorganized collective bargaining, individual bargaining ineffective, especially without robust employee protection laws, employers easily replace individual tries angle pay. true, fault  How? Every single metric state agrees it’s receding fast Arizona, peak weeks ago. load nonsense haha. first year determined amount paying escrow enough. caused increase - getting escrow back green + surplus prevent happening again. 

The kicker though since going ('our' meaning bought home ex fiance) first full year owning home qualified approved Texas' homestead exemption reduces home taxes 25%. came play around time increase. tried tirelessly mortgage company (Amerihome - trash customer service) review monthly payments align appropriately reduced tax rates follow call met documentation previous discussions.

I cant even put words frustrating been.

I forbearance hoping sell home period ends certainly lose foreclosure. top tech companies, salary hit might occur 100% remote means don’t live expensive places earth work companies anymore. know Facebook implementing salary bands based cost living region. I'm salty 600 couple different reasons. Disclaimer would make unemployment I'm happy job super secure.

1: fair, frankly fucks essentials. Walmart employees get maybe 12 hour, unemployed movie theater worker? Close 25 hour. shits fucked.
2: can't fucking hire anyone right now, 600. safe(I mean much 90% empty office pandemic safe) training people go home work. stupid, need safe, state 11% unemployment, noone wants work.
3: keep hearing ends, people evicted. I'm sorry, fuck time money? Nah, knew acceptable made others upset hurt. simply care. sense right, probably really know offended completely lacks empathy people color and, wealthy white college girl, never confronted consequences actions before.

Blackface least poor taste DECADES. reasonable way could know allowed. Good job google. Unlike job work home management like ""nah""

&amp;#x200B;

Then commence send managers supervisors work home lol  wear mask socially distance others. kinds folks, experience, generally both. Yeah, close contact hockey... Oh wait 

*Edit: New rule, checking... maintain 6 feet clearance...* actually stopped using N95 dirty looks. didn’t buy Covid, happened few. people look like I’m paranoid keeping supplies doctors. wear paper one, one bats eye.  And? want pizza Chinese po-boys every meal.  know I’m overweight need drop 25-30lbs I’m cooking chicken thigh roasted zucchini right instead. 5’5 172 lbs morning. additional Federal funding $400 month. State unemployment also still intact.

It can't stay around forever. won't. pull bandaid tricky. never able calculate remove additional federal funding jobs come back. keeping federal assistance $600 week great incentive stay unemployment, want country.  not. good guys guns might breaking law. Unlike vaccine mRNA vaccines safe zero long term effect.

This done find right dose see even works desired. witnessed insanity speak of. Shits crazy. I've reached point viewing trash like leaves loss words. tried put couple intelligent sentences together, would chance influence target audience. say virtual season replace large person sports current console video games, let teams face virtually computer vs computer, play games would happened real life, crown winner end. relate much. feel like I'm stuck episode Twilight Zone. I'm really worried contracting Covid spreading family anything. now, brainwashed Fox News, taking many precautions. dad super high risk he's starting believe conspiracy theories. I've called friends call Covid hoax. opened bestfriend anxiety acted like dramatic. feel like I'm made fun taking precautions.
 Idk coworkers believe, social distancing. see going parties bars FB weekends...despite fact cases state increasing. 
 feels hopeless. 39.8% Americans obese dude, 70% overweight. media ""normalizing"" it, actually norm United States. fucking awful, ridiculous norm.  future historians know Yeah back January doctor swab got sick absolute hell - muscle aches, could hardly stand etc. confirmed flu. indeed kick ass (but recall worst three days - credit shortened time getting flu shot likely &lt;3). Honestly hospital IV arm rehydrating best sleep long time considering living homeless shelter (highly 100% likely caught since people give eff hygiene) Question: family (defined people living 1 house) able vacation somewhere drive to, object that? Assume visit bars/restaurants, essential places like grocery store gas station. possible upset things? November 2nd they’re going deliver every American one novelty person-sized checks Trumps face signature send back bay Keep clear head; it’s true “Oxford vaccine” one promising right now, it’s also quite forward experimental protocols validate it, read article mostly PR CEO Italian producer.

Said producer legit factory producing Oxford’s samples since beginning research, way knowing sure phase 3 trials go planned, making group known future business opportunities.

I’m Rome Italy, first time CEO interviewed boasted product; still, would expect him?

So, TL;DR: Oxford vaccine one promising, ain’t bigger news interview CEO said voicing hopes, anything scientific certainty behind virus 3% chance killing someone age. That’s risk I’m willing take.

This argument sucks. Why? It’s fucking you. It’s 85 year old grandpa trying buy groceries selfish ass going infect kill. many young people think exact way they’re absolute morons. This. NWSL went month bubble positive tests, done. RIP :( still buy N95s? 15% positive tests bad. Hey drink quart whiskey body drive around place neighborhood. good, airbags seatbelt, worry about? body choice. one pigeon droppings water tank used indoor irrigation system.

Oh damn.. #FlippedTheScriptOnEm truly psychopathic lack empathy toward fellow man. Ex-Pro cyclist Phil Gaimon posted YouTube video calling USA Cycling irresponsibly issuing race licenses right despite technically legal breaking rules..

""Sports luxury functioning society...and ain't us right False Dichotomy logical fallacy effective flu vaccine? is, 30-50% effective?  thought Boris Johnson UK Trump still fan certainly hell lot better Trump. admit mistakes shortcomings listen experts. That's something Trump incapable of. traveller tested upon arrival South Korea, unlikely picked Singapore airport day before. incubation period least days. minimum wage workers, get it, probably financially beneficial give $600/wk + state unemployment. 

For minimum wage worker, 70% previous income = eviction. People already check check take income cut watching politicians bungled begin hand billions rich friends Wall Street?

If minimum wage workers getting much want go back work $600 + state unemployment answer minimum wage needs go up. RIP I'm pointing full shit sole purpose try insult someone.

You can't read, I've explained traits person behind keyboard change validity statements. true, true. nice try deflecting. good big words smart brain.  Ah maybe ""true?""

Because look everyone got one $150k. love cunt gets deserve AITA going her?

From perspective random stranger wouldn’t say so. don’t know pandemic like Florida world’s shitty shape everyone’s stressed, tired frustrated. Travelling likely increase personal risk don’t owe anyone, even nearest dearest, put line it’s power prevent it. I've actually met people envious ones WFH. One even told understand life worth (she went back office early May)  Walmart ban them. Even smart one still gets exposed everything comes contact comes back home.

Oh bad eat still includes maccies, pizza hut, burger king etc

A local place near pushing 50% stuff realised reopened seating assumed takeout. tell smokers smoking ""beautiful"" ""brave"" though. 

We also let active alcoholics onto transplant waiting lists pretend possible put away case beer/day still healthy.

Telling people they're fat make lose weight, telling carrying second person's bodyweight extra fat beautiful certainly helping either.

I'm 100% personally, fact precisely handle employees 100% remote (fly quarterly put hotel, team building mostly). 

There's lot employees like working home though. understand it. Middle management anti-WFH, there's surprising number individual contributors prefer working office.   It’s harder get Google Harvard. Interview success rates less 5%. even like resume willing give interview. Lol. New grads rarely go Google, unless internship previously. really dumbass, you? people like electrician, people like work home dont much savings bills, $1200 go right back economy. one using get take local restaurants pay bills keep people staff, likely low wage people need help pay rent. economy works, stimulus checks go everyone making certain amount. 


Now everyone uses shit Amazon new TV something, yes, pointless, companies dont need help. well leave well free medical support free school canada hey, control need send kids back school, said human ability think logically. news told Covid can't spread BLM protest. Liberal viewpoints like evolution, birth control, equal rights on.  what's point? get argument I’m tired people forced make “choices” lose/lose potentially poverty death, wealthy folks eat restaurants.

Edit: grammar paper yes. NBA players leaving go strip clubs, inviting people come back rooms. President thinks he's good health, meanwhile American people obese followers love tells is. Yeah...no. don’t need businesses protecting workers forcing work unsafe conditions. workforce recourse, people won’t show work. can’t provide safe workplace, don’t open.

Do think terrorists taken placeS?

What ""reeducated"" about? 

How exactly ""reeducated""?

What conditions release? maybe I’m interpreting wrong. I’m means great understanding grand scheme politics, feels intentional. Like, again, Republican party uses working class vulnerable people shield corporate ass-patting.

You understand politics average American.

I definitely feel sentiment though haha kinda like 'hey I'm random person obvious; keep Charlie Brown trying kick football?'

Idk people brainwashed hard country. Cold war propaganda fucked us good. Awesome news. expected distribution risk groups healthcare workers teachers year, absolutely would pleasantly surprised see full rollout beginning next year. Truly awesome news. Oh it’s W god he’s done lot dumb shit past couple months. Hell, took leader opposition pointing dumb force internationals pay NHS coverage internationals saved life COVID. taken losses wins. you’re ignoring article linked saying hospitals overwhelmed sending patients away... Well didn’t really “try”, mean, part considered success. School lunches mostly forever changed lean towards healthier options. like canada does? Yeah higherups certainly know /s Even vaccine found today would take months trials, many months ramping production up, many months get people vaccinated. least year out.

Granted, necessarily huge failure EVENTUALLY get it. trying delay vaccine comes point. Longer delay, closer vaccinations existing.

Situations like NZ, pretty damn locked opposed HK Japan still travel to, rarer. Grew back forth across Canadian/American border. History Canada completely different history America. History Oregon/Pennsylvania different Utah. 

Canada taught WW1 restrictions Germany led Hitler coming power.

It later self taught reasons US able large economy due mostly untouched war Europe rebuild.  shouldn’t bully mentally stunted. much Irony situation. Canadian literally believe crap coming states every single day.  got 500 upvotes nonsense post. 56 police injured Seattle. think protestors smart one. Stay home.

Moderna history sketchy press releases they’re interested pumping platform actually producing effective vaccine results wrong, calculations show easiest People got adding New Cases+New Negative ( 2,998,750 -2,962,648=44,994)Total New Tests (8,892 +44,994=54,199) excludes Inconclusive ""Awaiting testing"" day. Calculate 8,892 /54,199=19.8%

I believe meant is:

New Individuals Tested = New Cases + New Negatives = New Cases + (Today's Negatives - Yesterday's Negatives) = 8892 + (2998750 - 2962648) = 44994

Percent Positive = New Cases / New Individuals Tested = 8892 / 44994 = 0.198

With said, 19.8% alarming! love day get better worst thing, running, first thing morning. may spirit animal. don’t understand everyone ( business government city officials ) letting people don’t want wear mask follow kind covid safety measure run show . throw fit. sudden mask rules one enforce what’s ever .

The NFL, NBA, NHL, NCAA MLB (along lesser leagues) need pull plug regroup later next year. pro-sports wants survive needs set example serious pandemic make look like something ""work around"".

I cringe thinking happen 90,000 people converge Indianapolis Indy500.  police definitely would violent crime think needs reform.

Would make way less risk home invasions burglary believe meant home defense/the Public. 

They largely traditionally militairy rifles meant automatic. 
Just make semi auto sell people, mean should. 

You buy M16 reason buy Mac 10. 

Shotguns like (regular rifles, modded auto ones) fundamentally different weapons. ‘Want’ underestimates situation badly US. Many families can’t survive even short time work, can’t afford go work without public schools caring children.

The whole system designed trap people, it’s nothing efficient. live small town within national forest. national forest packed like nothing I've ever seen before. Even mid-week campgrounds nearly full nearly dispersed camp sites taken. biked past one couple days ago normally overgrown somebody multiple tents canopies vegetation more. Locals unhappy people camping trails taking water holes forcing us deeper deeper forest. , , STUPID! Yeah that's exactly thing. protests happen overnight activities going beach suddenly permissable. baseball slowly dying sport anyway Home invasions almost non-existent country. motion detector lights almost everywhere. Even street lights start turning late night save energy. Walk near one, lights up.

It's like situation cops. They're around stop crime. can't. figure it, get people front judge. 

We civilians protect making easy cops figure it, means motion detecting lights cameras. certainty getting caught goes 100%, crime rates drop like drank 10 tequila shots. Majority Americans many studies. stupid, low effort joke based incorrect assumption. stupid. said CCP claimed virus came Wuhan market. contradicted claim? Totally agree. think part large companies' seriousness comes colleagues world. late February, company series presentations Chinese colleagues going (which definitely eye-opening) speak daily colleagues Spain Italy, helped us take seriously early on. Larger companies also resources, infrastructure, skills needed improve odds successful transition remote-by-default, makes decision easier. 

I talk folks small companies time, run everything via tribal knowledge anywhere near thorough documentation have. often also often managers comfortable giving employees autonomy get stuff done, makes harder firms really feel comfortable remote workforce. lots weapons bloodlust. help right? No, there's line. Typical day America real hidden danger (and new legislation delayed) liability protection businesses. Businesses don’t take precautions employees/customers get COVID? Kiss workers comp claim etc. goodby3 We've reached zombie apocalypse stage pandemic apparently  paying stay home, paying forced employer shut down. requiring anyone look work, means paying stay home, lucky enough, fucked. 

I agree continuing 600, something better. need better data. many peoples jobs disappeared, longer recalled, required look work? Literally everything state open outside poker rooms casino, obviously staffing reduced. People willing hire.  Know else probably makes people feel depressed? Knowing they're responsible loved one dying seriously ill, that's what.

There 21 year old guy Florida gave coronavirus dad, dad ventilator while. think felt? think he's going feel dad long term effects this?  people going beaches ~~just refusal wear masks~~ **Freedumb**?

**FTFY** unprecedented slightest.  access social media death counting basketball game unprecedented.  I'll admit, watched bunch games weekend. Mentally nice way relax forget everything while. 
On flipside, watching, immediately realize good percentage players &amp; coaches wearing masks distancing... nose mask thing, generally acting like everything normal. 
I believe said back month ago, take ONE. We're going back mid-march sports thinking things bad realizing, opened toothpaste tube, can't go back again. anything MLB showing rest organized national sports leagues take seriously, get far en-devour. talking specifically economic survival. Border closures globalized world sustainable long term. read article, better yet watch press briefing, see saying true. Countries need develop capacity control outbreaks happen everyone around world needs learn loosening tightening restrictions going happen time need part. Shouldnt vaccine easier produce vaccine created oxford? Sooooooo found another gym right? Supporting business condoning supporting behavior. interned Japanese WWII far less evidence danger society. course, consider wrong. thing save us vaccine. Otherwise whole world eventually get infected, matter what.

Haha yeah. also wait least 6 months people really try vaccine getting it. anti-vaxxer want beta test health.

Beyond release vaccine though, there's also manufacturing distribution. It'd everyone access it. give time. Oh, gets better:

In [Jacobson v US Supreme Court went far state compulsory vaccination unconstitutional. decision reaffirmed several cases. Bullshit. Enforce mask wearing much possible. Fines asshats wear them. Ad campaigns endorsed local government president support show important mask wearing is. Closing venues comply pandemic regulations mask wearing distancing. things could done have,for part, done. 7 days cancelled season? ""Sweden"" ""Finland"" *are* valid comparisons identical? 

Some points valid. Health care. that's put Quebec in.

The point everybody compares Sweden Denmark, Norway, Finland. every country different. even ones similar, sometimes luck seems play part.

Some countries well. hit badly. Hard say exactly why.

But presented ""Sweden Outcome"" back March alternative shutting destroying economy leaving seems permanent scar psycho-cultural existence .. would said ""Let's Swedes!"" 3 months, opposed *has* happened us. really care Sweden missed it, I'm much worried try pretend Sweden never promised April reach 100000 tests week mi-May.

Instead drive around harassing people rather actually stopping serious crimes. funniest thing read today...LMAO Question: US federal govt suddenly started things better, possible mandate closure inter-state travel? I'm guessing states can't since responsible states outright banned travel states, merely imposed voluntary quarantine cases; remember reading big difference USSR USA ""papers please"" get former travelling ground major jurisdictions within USSR.

Canada's provinces seem able restrict intra-provincial travel. Examples like Atlantic Canada currently closed rest country, earlier Quebec banned travel Ontario traffic crossing Ottawa. neighbor? That’s TN. fastened cloth grills face mask part helmet went flag football, might work It’s like actively tries make world worse place. appreciate kind words. seem like bit domino effect bad luck hits, though likely easier us recover dismiss individual cases misfortune.

Houses selling fast. drive costs housing rent locals limited minimum wage jobs area. already increase crime, wildlife habitats trashed destroyed. Broken clock right twice day attention validation seeking want change you’ve never seen before. But, here’s changes could implemented current system would work accomplish pooploop5000 looking particular order:

1. Bolster SEC IRS, encouraging go big guys rather continually neutering investigative disciplinary powers.

2. Create meaningful understanding cost living state, require companies pay employees enough meet bare minimum single full-time job also allowing unionize.

3. Tax fuck rich, afford it. 

4. Divest police, department homeland security, failed bloated expenditures invest education. College shouldn’t ‘dream’, practical next step children prepared take want to. 

5. End two-party system. winner-take-all system leads intense division void represented interests. Implementing ranked choice voting would change voting question “who’s lesser two evils”, “who represents interests most? Second most? Third most?”. pit politicians efficacy predicated collaboration. 


These things won’t fix everything, heaven knows there’s whole fuck lot do, would humanistic step forward. understand would like know specifically people urging new activists toward, think too. We’ve never seen system works people before, patient new activists piece together. It’s frustrating total head scratcher, tbh. keep reading news like: people get away blatant corruption utilizing people livelihoods like pawns? It’s right there. don’t brightest crayon box look twice see something amiss. Ugh. Idk. hate it. there. Source svt. clip another time want infection herd immunity. Check Annika Linde said also. Soccer exists. 650,000 people dying good news you? Yes, children need kept healthy weight because, reach certain age still fat, struggle rest lives. also creates hormone imbalances screw leptin ghrelin levels seem easily repaired (if all).

The horrible part children lack cognitive capacity understand behaviors weight lack agency control food parents offer them. time control things, they're saddled biology make far difficult ever control weight without much, much greater efforts child grew thin.

This fat-shaming counter-productive. feel bad yourself, much harder focus make greater average efforts control weight. also people finally manage get tend regain weight. body literally screaming everyday go back higher weight. People issues whatever reason (luck, parents kept healthy, good genes) get care. They'd rather criticize judge. Living everyday life hungry (because brain lying you) easy, even result healthier body. yet unprecedented pandemic.

Let know many human lives trivial you. don’t live Texas it! Curve gonna down! understand coming morally, without example happens contribute society drive contribute (market consequences). 

Like honest, way could ever homeless always able afford need maybe little want, would make want continue work difficult positions? Like put aside empathy second think would convince people work mentally physically difficult positions could work lesser jobs still get paid enough support family? 😳😳  No, reason he's published epidemiologist modern history though.

Do seriously need /s  You’re one sounds privileged. irony. life shut in, mean others  don’t like stay you’re at.

Yeah, that's literally saying, disagreement there.

The latter part simply true, though. Plenty countries relaxed measures fine. Japan Sweden examples.

&amp;#x200B;

 Another point want make response disproportionately overblown around world non-deadly virus. think bit overblown response Vietnamese government three (!) cases? even bit? Boris Johnson consistently voted gay rights. Dump rhetoric. pay attention class i'm wearing swastikas. willful general ignorance. ensure 500 billion disappear big companies again? I'm saying couple Nazis, I'd like point people Nazis Nazi flags lying around house. Still lower mortality rate UK/Italy/Spain etc Well see happens. vaccines likely going require booster full dose. doubles requirement vaccine. think us get first dib wrong. Itll take months months release vacinate even 30%. Also 40% people infected early 2021 screwed anyway. That's dumb question. obviously never. speculate people people fact remains, people stupid virus stay Well yes, mentioned million times here, deaths lag cases. deaths continue rise cases peaked. like obvious increase cases would result increase deaths, decrease cases result decrease deaths.

Also per [Washington Post's weekly trend new cases see Florida, Texas Arizona downtrend. reporting less new cases peak, means epidemics downtrend simply less steep uptrend.

Florida's 7 day rolling average new cases 10,336, lowest since July 12. Arizona's 2,663, 1,000 peak. Texas, 7 day rolling average new cases \~8,400, peak around 10,100.

Nationally, numbers offset increases states like California. Oklahoma, Missouri, etc. also virus may remain dormant, also fucks circulatory system up.  Pre-COVID want WFH harder focus (ironically... though YMMV) home setup good office.

Now, I've fixed second problem least, I'm slowly getting better first one. company seems considering reducing office space they've discovered WFH doable, sent survey related questions. Initially, said would want come times week like said, though later question around getting rid personal desks (we're already open-office setup, would reduce space further) favor shared workstations. point basically responded that, they'll need make workstations really super nice compensate lol, else I'm staying home Megadesk. “Yes racist. going it?”. claims he’s racist he’s *married Asian*.

Also kind ironic using Chinese government example (I'm assuming) government bullying half planet well. Works way around too.

Yeah, told relatives HK complacent weeks ago. shouldnt let guard given HK's density, outbreaks happen flash spread bad. exactly happened.

The point coinflip cut car crash fatality rate half, IE making lethal COVID19. odds maybe getting accident, getting accident RIGHT NOW. COVID19 killed 15 times car crashes time span common. 

This hidden common risk. semi merging lane drunk driver T-boning you. something happens every day, something greatly affect life. analogy goes further; like car wreck COVID19 leave permanent disabilities, financial difficulties, guilt killing someone else. imagine Trump wearing mask zoom meeting, in-person meeting think disingenuous blame media reporting COVID deaths normalizing obesity. referring advertising fast food something like I'd buy it, American standards COVID victims ""healthy 20-somethings"". 

It's clear massive, structural problems American public's relationship food talk day intersects pandemic example gave reductionist inaccurate.

I've always wondered, always stop responding ask correct response continue social distance ignore personally want hang people. entire focus conversation many people continuing normal life like it’s problem, hanging friends family want to. It’s ok people need stop excusing it. Yes, pandemic going many months.

There record unemployment people trained hired run process labs.

If make excuses every weak link, nothing weak links.  lockdown nothing. Opened real guidance cases worse lockdown. Edwards put mask mandate place start. Damn Louisiana Republican Party using political points Edwards caved prevent anymore damage career. Multiple patrons shot back, read correctly. Could lot worse bar allow firearms OK, American way. Yes, it’s pretty easy decline go things people apparently think okay now, even pre-Covid times wasn’t generally interested gatherings 2-3 others (and avoid too). think many companies (sadly) move remote work end 2021, worse, forever. destroy businesses depend workers, restaurants. . flu elementary school guess big parents carry upstairs just... lived downstairs half-bathroom week. tried get couple days fed laying floor, made four steps falling bashing head living room's fishtank.

Also realizing parents absolutely left immobile 8 year old home alone flu. morning set floor couple gallon jugs water, sleeve Saltine crackers, thermos full soup fucked work lol. absolutely true. option good kids many never recover time lost. truly one long term consequences. Many kids left behind. Healthcare workers people too, get days like regular workers

In company, usually there's crew saturday major labs connected hospitals finish open cases week, hospital wont collecting many new specimens. Usually short day they'll leave around 1 2

On sunday, labs skeleton crew help process emergency specimens taken ORs. That’s countries important epidemic tbh Even Coronavirus, 1/5 deaths India unreported, go figure. 80% deaths India still happen home, including deaths infections like malaria pneumonia. Maternal deaths, deaths sudden coronary attacks accidents often reported hospitals. ""A lot people get medical attention time, return die home India,"" says Dr Jha.  counting hospital deaths alone going sufficient enough get accurate number Covid-19 fatalities.   get count funerals crematoria burial grounds would equally tricky. Many India's dead cremated open large swathes countryside. Funeral services cater small sliver population.

In developed countries, overall deaths usually quite accurate since deaths mandated report coroner similar government office. developing countries uncommon system exist outside major cities, making death counts highly inaccurate. Baseball *positive tests* outbreaks. Alrighty comment. Im saying sarcasm obvious without s. Like one cases blatant someone without cues whatsoever could figure people opinions mocked wouldnt even talk like that. people selfish narcissistic. deal emotions like guilt, regret, general concern others. live validation approval narcissists. somewhat agree also know preschool US historically accessible wealthy. Head Start good government programs exist, preschool/childcare general prohibitively expensive. reason kids tend enroll age 4 U.S. might that's eligible public Pre-K programs part local school district. programs free, low income families utilize them.

So starting preschool age 4 inherently bad, think indicator shortcoming part provide accessible universal childcare everyone needs it. symptom, rather cause.

(I preschool teacher btw!) me, shit all, safe side. Aussie here.  currently middle winter flu cases 98% last years figures.

Wash hands wear mask!!!! think understand data works out. make numbers start applying pretending mean something. Right. Remember pandemic economic depression Obama? Oh right. every horrible thing started trump. act like Monarchy accelerate downfall country disingenuous worst. enabling . Sports take mind Covid. need talk every second. know do. insane short period. Really makes wonder Wuhan's true numbers spreading since late November.

number NY biased, tested people going shopping.

Those afraid stays home less likely get infected less likely get tested. intelligent person seriously believes Obama stacked hand Trump would violate law frequently egregiously Trump. information provided individual states indicate large increase number cases. information readily publicly available anyone wishes see it. Nothing hidden.   bubble Canada... rest world watching. seen long people's memories are. 

From experience FL, long all. Like saw happened NY deaths lagged cases yet people constantly point cases high deaths aren't. Like ya....wait weeks say same, 7 day average increased every week past month. Really bad times horizon. Putin took advantage system

FTFY

Putin/Russia grooming many ‘conservative’ Americans decades. work paid bigly. 

Remember Senate Republicans visited Russia couple years ago July 4th? 

Remember high level Russians laughing Trump Oval Office sworn in? 

Remember Trump/Putin meetings without anyone else room transcripts?

Putin running America Trump/Senate Republicans gophers. wear one protect others. Americans crossing Canadian border ""drive Alaska"" go vacation properties. scenarios individuals supposed abide certain behaviours (regarding stopping self quarantine). instances American travelling either scenario abiding agreed entering.

They fined. Unfortunately, violation law results fine, law merely suggestion wealthy enough. flown Spirit years, flew relatively frequently past. 

They give shits anything. could legally make bring chair sit would. don’t know they’re stock anymore Oakley has/had goggle frames seal around eye frame front basically look like sunglasses. bought could get w/different lenses, think clear, yellow tinted, sunglasses tint anti-fogging spray/coating.

My husband first responder goggles work getting progressively worse quality. He’s wearing months disinfects them. idiots? I've one worn face masks daily ever since early March...and social-distanced properly.

I've hardly seen Australians wear social distance properly - whether ""known"" numbers (It's usually 2 weeks - rare cases - know not, remember).

Therefore, would argue Australians are, fact, idiots - because, besides actually stayed home go unless absolutely essential, Australians bothered wear face masks properly social-distance properly since pandemic first started! local state groups counter making wild numbers worse even actual ones would be.

Might make Trump flinch USA territories beginning. Besides original 13 states “Northwest Territory” almost big 13 states run Congress turned states. Rico’s status similar this. referendums whether become state Puerto Ricans divided almost 50-50. took combined 20 countries latin america surpass canada states...

There 650 million people latam basically double population canada us combined. sort conclusion even reach article? higher population expected absolute cases? IIRC, lot Hutterite colonies hit - many travelled Alberta (around Warner) funerals three girls drowned long ago spread there, course went back colonies, back cities (as said, went supplies). I’m flying end next month, ask, end getting sick flying? headline sound like opening ad Umbrella Corporation?  biological need human touch interaction. Eventually, lacking drives signals brain cause depression. evolutionary trait helped early humans survive. 

And said pandemic priority. suggesting ""suck up"" regarding depression shows lack understanding physiology.

The correct response would be, nee socially distance, despite desires, increase awareness treatment mental health time hard time seeing affect baseball? Cases happen. learning live this. managing cases become outbreaks... are. Move stop calling 2,3,4 cases outbreaks Why? Doesn’t insurance save conditions? thought pocket maximum. Well yeah, crybaby trump cut ties didn’t provide coloring book extra crayons trump color showed pretty pictures bad Covid Nice ad hominem. eminence front. Or, least, he's incoherent moron. Every local level report massive numbers make Trump flip this. Like ""oh looks like county 200,000 cases week..."" funny half us saw coming mile away person who’s supposed report probably call sick due Covid travel pleasure pandemic, deserve whatever catch. Fine one percent income last 6 months. Clearly late post...

What fatigue like? late March, too, ever since twice month I'll 5-6 days row insane exhaustion. Like, I'm sleeping 16-18 hours day, I'm awake I'm exhausted move. used run half marathons, man, doubt could run five minutes. fatigue like mostly went away, steady? bet would wore mask bought everyone drink gun. That's terrible thing guns, soon get one shoot somebody

/s relatives think fake even though family works nurse literally got it..
 Smh it. either hyperinflation people die. easy fucking choice. 

You revealed moral dilema republicans, save people save economy works rich mean, like they’re flying commercial...

The real issue lack bubble, guys going partying. Beautiful comment. believe shady ass politicians part too. That's fight??? China can't US??? makes like China. That's why. makes same, rights witholding, nation lies, lack democratic options fucking CHINA!!! good that?? guys screwed. Language changes everybody else knew meant. also pretty unlikely unfolding story, details available. know quite that. think completely lacks empathy, way understand others imagining would do. Yup, either accuse others of, want accuse others doing- cases, see oppurtunity ""legitimize"" actions making outrageous accusations using honest response example allowed get away crimes. thing is, supporters can't see difference- democrat politicians hold members accountable much often republican politicians do. That’s ridiculous.

Being treated corona free. $0 bill. Yes, lose home Chapter 13 bankruptcy, equity - meaning amount paid versus much worth - ""money"" bankruptcy take forcing sell home. state, amount/limit $15,000 right point. let's say, $20k paid could taken it. law (at least state) take account kind debt was. (Other tham student loan debt, different rabbit hole.)   realize people running labs processing tests also, know, people, right? need days lol Crazy thing Indian government still insist currently ""community transmission"" India! every time there’s Recession huge trouble/scandal US, it’s always Republican White House?

Is coincidence? Lol, right live NY know Liquor Store owner got back Florida week ago went straight airport back work store. zero enforcement, worst got daughter law let stay house anymore livid. Blessed thy karma. Except still better ones Trump calls shitholes, least major metrics proceeded read comments endless remarks Covid fake global conspiracy. 

There staggering number uneducated people United States *and* public trust/faith public institutions reporting dropping decades. 

Combine two: people stupid figure things stupid/distruful put faith experts... pretty much recipe huge number problems we're currently facing. decent strategy requires funding, increasing social safety net (at least temporarily), etc though. refused spend money people things they'd spend successful. weak selfish, power intoxicating. virus doesnt take day off, people collecting tests, running labs, reporting tests lol. going end very, ugly. Nah, know difference flu cold. One bedridden not. you’re getting information reddit comment section without looking sure it’s true, you’re already misinformed haven’t bothered look anything else. behalf us want schools open, means, please post medical research showing elementary age children pose even minimal risk spreading teachers other. see that, I'll gladly reconsider. China dystopian hellhole Hey! said yesterday stocks great! Unemployment low China virus! us! 

😕 Same. want people live. Doesn’t change fact you’re wrong. three states Connecticut, New Jersey, New York. Good job. make reopening school possible. far degree perceived course better Harvard. would say that's matters going college, talking actual educational quality Coursera arguably better suited case. Though Harvard classes they've already offering virtually pretty good. Well, know, tackled April wouldn’t dragging people wouldn’t bored social distancing cause wouldn’t to

california says otherwise There's got something said regularity Despite media wants everyone believe, Florida full northerners southern clothing. aren’t swing state think same... 

Unfortunately loudest dumbest make headlines. I’d say equal portion Florida shaking heads much rest world dumb stuff Florida doing.

Judicial precedent strong here, expect anti-maskers lose every legal challenge. story really tragic though. idea ""asymptomatic carrier"" something like typhoid completely unknown, piss poor job explaining infecting people. Washing hands cooking would gone long way :(

 mean begining community spreading here, poor r getting poorer n things always get attention rich, coming September exams coming country n one puts lot pressure. It’s matter human nature, common sense point. People want socialize travel can’t much stop it. want everything go business? norm antibodies disappear 3 months say goodbye 'immunity testing' US obviously both.

Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, etc. monarchies stop also representative democracy.

The US, France, etc. republics, stop representative democracies. Don’t forget 

3) preemptively ‘compassionately’ sending home prisoners risk avoid higher numbers medical expenses. matter worth 5-6 months. real bearing long term investment. matters rent 20-30 year investment worth end term. buy want pay $40k asking, save $40k today, miss potentially hundreds thousands rental income profit future sale decades line. court case regarding this? awesome straw that’ll break back many corona virus vaccines anyone else created? never distinct reason 14 days. set ""with abundance caution"". reduced average length infection incubation period.  instance, said way likely resonate gun owners gun advocates. They’re ones need see issue bit nuance experience. 

He never owned gun first place. goes prison felony, allowed one legally [5 years know comment sounds kind milquetoast, wasn’t targeted you, fwiw. Wait, what? Like know Bay Area hella expensive, never really know expensive. Canada chlorine-chicken example big eu far know. Someone else mentioned salaries might take hit, think actually opposite, I've noticed started spend even money working home, needed buy new chair, upgrade better network provider, can't use company facilities anymore, free coffee gym. Also, one biggest grips WFH dirty house gets, also spend time week cleaning. Okay, then. many people willing kill order happen? many willing cripple? Give chronic, life-changing illness to? many people good enough sacrifice you?

Because exactly advocating. There's evidence herd immunity even thing virus. NOVEL VIRUS. There's enough evidence suggest something lays dormant fucks later years chickenpox.

Are willing look faces people wish goodbye? dice rolls affects loved ones, say worth it? myopic?

It's quite interesting countries managed lockdown (for MONTHS, forever unlike idiotic strawman people regurgitating) fine. Hm. Definitely rampant stupidity problem states. p*litical issue. public health one. virus discriminate. could gotten control it, let stupidity reign.

Edit: nice editing comment I've replied. Coward. That’s happened us. don’t think it’s directly correlated commute, due out-of-touch board doesn’t realize we’re functioning normal working efficiency. We’ve accelerating rapidly last years pain acceleration extremely heightened WFM.

I’ve started taking time way put foot down, including today—slack muted, email. dread tomorrow means work piled way out. Ponzi scheme, pyramid scheme. benefit payouts funded enrolling new people program, investing initial contributions (since contributions used pay people) Walmart isn’t public it’s private. private store choose serve you. That’s like praising feudalism you’re lord. That’s nice person, system overall doesn’t allow everyone succeed, therein lies problem. 1 billion starving day capitalist nations, 1 million homeless United States alone (those pre-covid numbers) It’s denying medical access disagree them. People refuse wear masks infect others high rate people need hospitalized, given supplemental oxygen, given treatments like remdesevir convalescent plasma already limited access global pandemic. makes perfect sense make sure people actively spreading dead last list they’re ones need treatment.  

Insurance denial cool. Insurance companies already predatory put profits anything else don’t wanna give another reason able deny claims. thought thing. there's types prisons state, private, juvenile, federal one. Amsterdam shit. Everything outside red light district awesome. didnt help OP. Life comes lots risks. Carefully decide far bed like go everyday accordingly wouldn’t place offer $13? reason times: pick better works competitors. fact places like target Walmart offer min wage states, get better workers. Hi-Yo Silver...away. blunt smoking . effective. Agreed. We've looking Spanish Flu outbreak 1918 lot prior example, see mentioned lot outbreak lasted 1920, another flare lasted 1922 quarantines let soon. commercial airline travel made global spread easy. seems floor 27%. That's W. Bush's approval left office. Yes, probably would. onset symptoms would occur 0-7 days infection. infection would last depending severity. moderate-severe would likely require hospital visits quarantine changes moot. Asymptomatic - mild would mean 10 days enough. Well, response that, since choice operate way save money extra, eligible bailout funds IMO. shareholders bail out. I'm sure means I'm communist something. Haha. Thank laugh. noticed autocorrect made seem sympathetic dark side. agree. Also, ""opened up"" doesnt mean back normal like much US. still crazy limits business, regards capacity distancing, even stage 3. Still blips there, like migrant worker situation Montreal, overall Canada great. conspiracy theory. personal experience. mean tbh meant could work home id probably stomach bit drop salary. commute costing £240 quid month petrol plus toll road costs. I’ve saving away 6 months nice. drop salary remain working home wouldn’t bad deal cat ever got chance, he'd kill everybody care about! meant end comment ...""please tell said that"".     
That why.   
Hopefully get boo hands cup Toronto year. may onto something here, intuition keeps bringing back event guess wait details suspect released jump conclusions. Came looking comment. I'm currently studying this, I'm expected take 6 hour test situation students suspected infected. Shame AAMC (and NBOME) considering profits safety. Anything end year incredible one using get take local restaurants

Not great idea, since potential vector disease spread whether picking up, contaminated food, another customer, etc. Better cheaper prepare food control. laid take $1200 unemployment. Getting pandemic important economy, since continuation cause overall damage end. going lie, masks became mandatory province happy maybe 40% wearing less wearing right. Law says cover mouth nose, new favorite thing telling people cover damn nose  Another part problem many people believe DJT would force approval vaccine safe, because. data show 50% people say would get vaccine. 

I get saying DJT WH, worked people things like clinical trials ethical people. think would advance vaccine next stage problems.  cool people dying think wife selfish ridiculous. family members behave like that, insisting vacations everybody else's inconvenience. talk selfish people more. Tell wife grow up. Acting way pandemic unforgivable. special people, need take vacation national health crisis. Millenials getting houses. Large companies huge reserves going buy cash immediately upon listed turn around rent them. going make housing situation worse long run. There's going massive amount homes end owned few. Back March saw projections around 2.2 million deaths, headline definitely false. almost morning two FB ""friends"" (read: acquaintances). reposting something saying air escapes side anyway effective. husband I've known fairly conservative, spouted ""just another flu"" nonsense top claimed it'll magically disappear November, naively America-only conspiracy theory Canadian (i.e. world making stuff bid hurt US Dear Leader's chances getting re-elected). mean, he's also pretty blatantly lied idiotically cabinet initially responded pandemic. even really mea culpa. like blaming populace fat instead of, example, govt instituting lockdown way late.

I understand we've gotten point we're impressed politician string two sentences together, whole BoJo redemption arc needs nipped bud. literally watching govt promo video that's *supposed* make seem likeable empathetic, he's still piece shit heart it. Maybe.. cold weather kills virus? Quick, everyone inject liquid oxygen. Good luck! definitely drink water, keep drinking it. hard gets easier. made addict, fault get back normal. indeed would end walked around clothes on. realise counted sociable!!! bit lazy came going this. Going pubs ubs ever really thing. got system quite quickly went back reading paying video games. won’t automatically know better shuffles papers doctors office. rude unsolicited. Adults need feel like they're still stuck high school English class. ask advice grammar, fine give much constructive feedback want. see business. much higher chance life long complications including brain damage damaged lung function

source much higher chance  great news! glad still opening schools though.... though God would protect since righteous holy! Stupid bastards. Saturday, demonstrators held anti-mask demonstration Mount-Royal similar event held Sunday Quebec City.

Attendees said believe choice wear mask government mandate use. Others expressed skepticism cited conspiracy theories masks and, cases, COVID-19 pandemic itself. would much rather get vaccine wear mask extended amount time. masks convenient painless you, good you, think everyone? idea masks efficient vaccine outright laughable.  Self employed, contract workers, gig workers qualified ui. fact hell lot easier regular workers haven’t asked prove anything. Office spaces going anywhere time soon. 

WFH works fine well established team. try training new employee said employee WFH extremely difficult. 

50 percent training someone new socialalizing team. requires personal contact tough working home. Companies keep salaries shifting workspace lease obligations workers. paying workers rent want use houses. “That’s may end herd immunity” said. “Only strong — people take seriously — survive many, many others perish. hate say it, we’re almost natural selection point.”

  tired winning yet? Yeah, people rent US houses 700 people give free drinks goodness heart... Belgian flag Belgian one beer logo got bought case world cup.

I guess hang every 2 year month so.(WC EC) reports receive member states. China lied withheld information that's WHO's fault. expect investigate numbers must invited country? 

So much anti-WHO nonsense form people like understand actually works. world's health department compel countries comply. Nobody ""larger threshold"" mortality *rate* anyone else. prepare CTE play football likely unless relocate.

I'm Montreal too, best part mask rule mask cover nose. work mall tell people cover nose least 20% time, people get bitchy bad. Malls gross one good day, fuck cover face violation 1st amendment ok  Assuming paying employer employee portions SS, grossing $20,000/month, reason retire 40. 397 posts T_D Truth told broke friend refusing wear mask.

I too, many people.

They know it. Fox best example this...

Several hosts... remoted saying everyone needs physically go back work everything fine. Yes tam honks. Exactly! cat's can't transfer coronavirus you

but would could ventilator hopefully will.  Top firms city “build extra”, average Joe lives outside London trains everyday huge cost, firms know offer “attractive” packages tempt talent.
You’re paid commute that’s fucking idiotic, however lead believe agreed remuneration extra help cover cost. Bull riding legal. Bull fighting not.  Pure stupid... absolutely stupid. mask made 6 year old neighbor. Hardly part supply chain hospitals. Faucci's argument lying us BS. pediatrician told mom drinking juice, water. guess happened? guess happens get extra fat cells child? Sure lose weight shrink-but cells never go away. 

I battle rest life mom listened terrible advice control body. [Dengue [very new vaccine (after 90 years although concern efficacy Serotype 4. worried AC airport air people around plane, idea say you. bank gets mortgage payment. facebook. facebook already pays FAANG company refactor salary work home. imo bogus. still making 95% population so. San Francisco here. Crazy many moving trucks see... far people leaving. means rest country gonna get expensive fine techies spread out. Hey dont ass, cops busy beating peaceful civillians, dont time nonsense USA pretty large country (5th geographical size 3rd population size). 

If want implement effective solutions reduce gun-deaths.. treating root/core causes symptoms. (if ""treat symptoms"".. never make headway fixing actual underlying problems). Lol, sure planet living on, welcome Earth.

The news report race black suspects want called another covid immunity expert. Yes, completely ruins supply demand claim. Economically speaking would anyone right mind hire someone know hire someone else less? take correct path action (punch right face) go jail. Imagine twats trying 1946.  They’d imprisoned, shot/beat up, imprisoned. Exactly getting 20/hr across board hazard pay rip

when'd lose him? Anything’s better compulsively-lying covid truther surprising run lungs infect eventually. I'm forgetting failures. Calling fat takes vulnerability. Admitting wrong virus meant is, political standards country world, taking hit favorability.

I'm shocked far moments recent memory basics live. called slippery slope *fallacy* reason.

Funny telling though instantly associated nazi symbolism trump, republicans, right-leaning politics. Yeah man. Sorry, Justin Curto lame ass hate every comment section becomes America even related People already accepting risk.

Realistically science already shown immunity gained covid eventually immunity reached. problem numbers get ugly.

Looking current vaccine data pretty much sure thing one come along better hypothetical would going first group take longer time.

The 3 potentials scenario improved treatment virus longer life threatening leave long term effects. lot interesting treatments trialed studied currently. also research testing going blocking covid able infect (such nasal spray others). Lastly viruses type contagiousness tend mutate favor less lethal.and could another turn events hypothetical. love live music much next need right period. bands venues need stop till get shit control. really lot businesses depend Google foot traffic? offices basically bubble. really go eat go anywhere since campus. 

I worked Sunnyvale campus surrounded offices. like gym close mostly populated people companies since Google gym Rising RI, 😣 Thanks! Google campuses fairly insular contain pretty much every convenience could want within ecosystem. Googlers really reason go anywhere campus, everything free. definitely impact, whole area shutting Google. born raised couldn’t agree more. Thank God left U.S. “I fucking dumb...” There's way wont WFH becomes standard. Kind hoping little much expect companies pay arent operating same. flu vaccine even much effective catching disease.

Infection recovery gives temporary immunity one strain. flu shot gives temporary immunity couple strains, since predict advance strains put vaccine, strains get immunity may even prevalent strain(s), whereas infection recovery gives proportional protection (e.g. there's strain 70% prevalence, 70% chance catching becoming immune, vaccine protects 3-4 strains 30% prevalence, get 30% immunity) don’t think fully appreciated irony comment wrote one equally productive people commute deal ""looking busy work"" garbage. Phuc gone mad demanded publicity traitors. Go ask people London Vancouver . case everywhere picked bad time go college... about, ""Your mask's slipped down"", polite save face. Honestly one best purchases. 3 years great day got it. Hoping last 10 years. I've using ~10 hours day far. Ultimately, burden proof author. central thesis goes definitions central field taxonomy. Humans different genus mountain evidence justifying classification. Alternatively, merely ignoring rigorous scientific definition genus species, it’s nonsense anyways definitions definitions used broader field science. Actually not, holisdays started states weeks ago talk airport testing now. ""Whataboutism"" = Wikipedia fallacy use get exposed hypocrite need way save face

LMAOO Yeah right.....panic good. Sort like *The Boy Cried WOLF* super screwed isnt much outside donations help them.

 


It's funny developed countries except one unemployment benefits one really beeing desperate.

 


But hey, nothing right ? dont blame blame Justin Curto lol try switching heavier snack alternatives like baby carrots fruit. tell personal experience it’s lot easier buy something eat it. Also try go walk type exercise times week. help lose bit weight, might also help back bit. full agreement last point. Super easy.

1. socially isolate go absolutely necessary 

2. go out, wear non filtered cloth face covering fits nose mouth 

3. Wash hands 20 seconds multiple times day work deceived month ago we’re going back 2021. Even early 2031 it’ll partial opening. It’s less disruptive business operate way open fully risk mass illness. I've heard, A-day/B-day schedule. A-day kids school Monday/Wednesday, virtual Tuesday/Thursday. Vice-versa B-day kids.

This entire sub filled fear, rage, misunderstanding.  Socialism thing works tbh. say socialism leads communism.. well see clearly capitalism leads communism. think idea works, particularly case idea membership decided. need bit research actually rather picking information news headlines. cant stand 6 top 10 songs. loving job WFH. don’t every day plant trials run get spend next day writing findings without interruptions start hour early longer driving 1 hour 1 hour back. waiting end day drive home waste lot less time.

So, news Puerto rico state, country yet part U.S. guess name U.S. incorrect. United States Territories America. even solve issue Puerto Rico citizens voters. also weird thing find out. citizens U.S. voters. intents purposes Puerto Rico like vassal state. oddly enough makes electoral college argument somehow make sense always clear states voting, people.

Very interesting country, U.S. empire True, just....gah, kidding? American politics giving many scraps whilst choice steal lions share (even last bill, 500 billion given large businesses. Thag it. Almost every part relief broken down, large businesses ""hear, fucking half trillion, dont worry paying back"").

I get virus serious, goddamn yanks get screwed every way, virus used excuse distraction fact actually stopped virus, delayed parts world still spiking regardless actually seem suggest lockdown might great tool stop virus. Goodle. Right, sorry, meant Alberta whole. even south, increases happening Central Edmonton regions (like outbreak Misericordia hospital week ago, two breaks Red Deer past weekend). We'll find hours numbers like now; hope go back reporting weekend soon False, Adam Silver mile won’t get approval without phase 3 clinical trial. You’re describing Phase 1/2 results designed determine safety dosing. 30,000 participant trial dosing study study determine whether there’s neutralizing antibody response.That determined Phase 3 trial starts. survey May put 50% yes, 30% maybe, 20% no.

Yeah, it’s clearly way line pockets. really hate it. background genetics research public health, I've never seen anything grow exponentially (especially R0 3-5) suddenly level off. would happen natural environment organisms run hosts, time, space (called ""refuge"" ecology). Again, R0 3-5 every single individual capacity infect 3 5 others, upwards 10,000 per day 2 states 3,000 another constant, make statistical numerical since exponential growth would suddenly flatten drop without strict control measures... simply place 3 aforementioned states. Norway's experience proves I've gathered far 4 people. Anything beyond that, try avoid. would gather people know they're taking seriously (not downplayer) behavior like throughout thing, would still take precautions wearing mask indoors would much prefer hang outdoors keeping 8 feet+ people.

edit: Basically assume everyone could potentially infected behavior (mask-wearing/distancing) would prevent getting infected someone actually end infected. wild, scary thing dont see going away anytime soon whole generation idiots raising another new generation idiots... Use app (or app) look many calories things are, you’ll amazed much you’re consuming.

I'll add lot intrinsic whatever food is. Instead often particular meal made. Empty calories fast cost effective way making bland meal taste better. mask kinds things food intended sit store weeks even months. 

I've found vast majority high calorie foods liked could cooked home far healthier lower calorie way I'd find stores even restaurants. recipies online usually healthier options. usually made even better lowering amount oil sugar used. looking copy cat recipes whatever tweaking bit let keep enjoying guilty pleasures without guilt.

I never painted anyone two categories. simply stated people downvoting others thread saying sometimes conspiracy theories right. Instead, everyone thread wants confirm one another people give conspiracies second thought flogged.

LUXURY ITEM? 20 BUCKS WALMART. THAT'S LESS ONE BIG MEAL MCDONALDS FACTOR DRIVING COST. FUCK ME. ELECTRICITY RUNNING IT? WATTAGE LIGHTBULB besides, going slow cook?

FUCKING ANYTHING there's lack nutritional literacy American public. Many people really know healthy diet looks like, perceptions skewed advertising way community grew lives, self-perpetuating problem.

Fuck agree here! I'm trying educate mother fuckers saying buy slow cooker use smart phone access World Wide Web look damn slow cooker recipe. Yet jump like smart ass go ""NOW WAIT MINUTE PAL, PEOPLE STUPID LEARN COOK, CAN'T AFFORD LUXURY SLOW COOKER, DRIVE 10 MINUTES WAY NIGHT BUY BUCKET KFC"" 

Yes, takes willpower eat fast food every day, yes need spend 8-12 minutes research use slow cooker, yes need least Google searches ""cheap, healthy recipes"" that's fucking life man. willing let commercials showcase junk food influence diet habits spending behavior sucker. fucking autonomy self responsibility man. definitely pretty cool story. Maybe parties lol. thanks taking time reply me. Really dope apart that. One last question carry walkie talkie around / find someone danger hard fat like half people fat lmao idea would make sense case. We've working home since March. seem plan go back time soon. Saturday normally low day death reporting recently reporting like days. concerns well. wanna get ride. That’s u get Charisma Uniqueness Nerve Talent choices means anti-vax. little hesitant vaccine fast-tracked months study potential side effects come along though. bet phone ringing hook wellwishes colleagues. Experts repeatedly said spring vaccine treatment, would need prepared lockdown areas hotspots popped again. believe Fauci said we'd working put fires vaccine. countries far fewer cases are. problem US' strategy economy going go back normal long large threat getting infected. know many peers young professionals making 6 figures previously spent lot disposable income economy. Happy hours, trying newest restaurant town, going $15 cocktails, gym workout class memberships, getting hair/nails done, traveling, etc. Guess people now? Sitting home, cooking 95% meals. proper lockdown numbers looked like Germany, people like friends would feel comfortable going things, precautions. Given things US, feel comfortable time soon. result, people going back work to, high earners sit home contribute much boosting economy. think would appropriate strategy? Sounds like sweet talking mistakes made beginning. Even Fauci admitted advice diluted economic considerations. shameful thing doctor made oath compromise medical advice economics.

Look Asian countries, used masks day one, opinion coincidence overall case numbers lower. are: Folks, let tell Clorox people, fine, great people. Absolutely tremendous people. best bleach, trust folks. got phone Clorox people told Clorox bleach official bleach Making America Great loved it. Absolutely, tremendously loved it, folks. believe bleach. even know make want lol. Yes  assumed verbiage doses referred required amount medicine administered vaccine effective, would account however many shots required. see point numbers they're halved dose refers one two shots needed, would dispiriting case. ok, report juden. way fix country. Maybe get commendation.  Sure, make financial sense seek American tourist money risk Americans causing outbreak falls much lower level. loved back day opened midnight. fun, everyone coming pumped feeding energy. see moms moms like bunch girlfriends shopping kids blast. switched Thanksgiving Day (initially around like 8pm so) noticed people grouchy snippy around miserable since ""eating holiday"". one's forcing guys! weird little coverage ongoing riots get now.

I guess shooting live rounds mothers singing lullabies officers also shooting veterans formed human shields protect moms police aggression plays poorly TV. Yes that’s true. can’t handle spread virus Americans bring them. Exactly. time taking risks giving passes prevention best tool virus. think another potential downside effect lot industries cater workforce major metropolitan areas. many restaurants, bars, coffee shops, convenience stores, barbers, dry cleaners, etc. potentially impacted without workers coming every day? Top talent big companies already got work wherever/however wanted pre covid. Shout Michelle Obama. Yeah employees wfh permanently already provided stuff. think pretty normal infection rate super low country (leaders *and* population) shown put outbreaks metastasize USA-sized trainwrecks.

Good Ireland able this. first symptom me. would call day 0, symptoms set went away bet Covid end careers given works Well answer question specifically, give faith. know people threw around word ""hoax,"" none mean disease exist. mean as, parts media reaction ""hoaxes."" probably right word, IDK use it. mean media's portrayal covid disproportionately bad actual data, ignore anything positive happening. retroactively get back 2400 next April income lower 99000 year 2020? keep hearing that, can't find anyway.  care others' safety still care wallets.

A good whack wallet listed along Covid-19 preventatives.  never understood republicans worship people tread them. daylight savings Hawaii would 2 hours, 3 hours half year.

Tough fair. born alive cares Put vents please, fat idiots can't breathe mask on, claim. COVID super compatible bars lower Broadway. loves amount available hosts! It’s free real estate.  I’m WFH admit it’s hurting family business. parents operate small sandwich shop office building it’s closed since March. can’t imagine WFH cause dynamic change way economy function. Well, body choice. Put mask on. again, together, breathe lot. Maybe get thing faster catch it. lockdowns make virus disappear, simple cause bottleneck spread. locked overwhelm hospital system, eradicate virus. inevitable lol uncle died nursing home last night COVID complications. tested positive weeks ago never really improved, pneumonia got end. family still planning funeral week, funeral home says limit 250 people. WHAT. many people? Indiana. Thankfully older family members terrified attend, I'm certainly interested driving COVID hotspot TX (I live 20 hours away car). plane question, way I'm that. know consider holding 250 person funeral circumstances... add /s death toll state Florida since pandemic began one week New York City height pandemic there. Fuck, ate half slab ribs put suit tie every day enough I've already heard talking giving unemployed people bonuses going back work

I idea return work bonus even supposed be. Like even about? Go back work get paid.... ""here's bonus cause draw unemployment last 6 months"". Full text please? double average deaths car accidents USA per year, it’s still July. totally agree. said first heard reopening I’ll say - dumbest fucking idea imaginable. Even CDC like, “it’s matter people die, it’s matter many die.” Absolutely batshit crazy, country. Didn’t isolate two weeks season opened? Nobody hospital 3 weeks oxygen, read inbetween lines he's ventilator staff posting behalf yeah, end year. i'm guessing they're assuming good treatments then. Don’t forget Florida already covering numbers Yeah.

We're like worst.

But course fit within narrative poor people dumb well educated people smart.

We're shit risk assessment smart people absolute morons.

News coverage pandemic match experiences hospital. propaganda.

My COVID patients poor high risk. going parties. doctors nurses are. seems like government played large role decision making too. reopenings gave false sense security.

i know it’s easy call individuals dumb, i’m guessing majority population doesn’t keep daily numbers, waiting hear what’s reopening what’s not. 

since they’re paying attention what’s actually going think stuff reopening virus done. threat here. end season teams five six uninfected players, team DodgersGiantsPadres little league team beat YankeesBoSoxChisox Tom Brady World Series. company provided gear. previous job knew people worked remotely full time, company paid business internet connection, phone, desk, chair, etc. even allowed use internet connection personal devices. work machines already hard drive encryption VPNs work.

So see perks employment future. think deserves much credit death per capita low especially considering old population mostly open.

The data signals Florida currently peaking. type thing make people riot streets tbh. Shortsighted to, would actually save lot money long run. I'm pretty sure prearranged make dear leader look tough virus. I'll bet bloodwork already looking better.  Fed face down.

/notes session ok, keep  CSA longer apart America.

Says traitors. According United States, still part country, there's war prove it. got fucking lucky that’s it. 100s millions nothing show “hard work”. Thank god fucks like first lose everything. Well people cause chaos destruction send cops Portland? communists want country burn. Oh look, stupid, drive-by comment substance. respond single follow-up comment know can't defend stupid position. -1 death time reopen though. SAME.

I'm intellectual, 2 degrees led develop highly specified critical thinking logical reasoning skills. spent greater portion 7.5 years life analyzing scientific data, specifically ecological genetic data. i'm saying personal experience science, critical analysis data add fact logical. I'm pretty sure ones screaming FREEDOM reason wearing mask ones thought gay men locked wearing condom. First shot already given someone first shot given person 6:45 a.m., Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, nation’s leading infections disease expert, told Mines small businesses already planning work remotely CV happened. imagine we'll go back. Similar position Texas.

I wonder willing insure, absurd cost, sent back NOPE.PDF instead quote. visitors allowed Covid wards. *again sports non essential.*

They country's morale. Maybe you, hundred million Americans. guy deserves long painful death God comes take even eat everyone else sill eat less that. Sure knowing actual calories things helps, removes guesswork frustration, people would much better even eating less currently do. totally missed point post. could eat sorts things lose weight. making decision eat depressed pick easiest thing makes feel best immediately.

Do think link fast food obesity? imply isn't? Illinois Read inbetween lines tweet today: he's ventilator also accurate without calling traitors. Wearing mask wearing mask binary choice, either not. Science work way, scientists work likelihoods. likelihood regular cloth mask protect catching COVID remains low, like Fauci first said ""don't work"". evidence masks MAY reduce initial viral load, MAY reduce severity symptoms. Masks good protecting OTHERS viral shed. 

This problem start. No, bandana mouth nose protect COVID. may protect worse symptoms definitely protects others virus particles, one asking February March. wanted know masks protected us. answer always ""No, like understand protection"". Anyone thinks UK trump doesnt understand nuances global politics loves Reddit circle jerk, mildly aligned conservative issues that's it. won’t bet ... think it’s going race onset cold weather &amp; typical flu season availability vaccine. Oxford &amp; Moderna’s respective timelines hold true approved fall, emergency availability healthcare workers high risk groups may save lot lives heading wintertime. Widespread availability wouldn’t think early 2021, vaccine doses people need October/November would huge. situation Bay Area isn’t caused politics. economic influence major tech companies one place pushed rents roof, people leaving. Yes, wrong suspicious. numbers reported state department health nothing federal government.  Groundhogs day someone owns small company loves work home (In fact we've done without office 2.5 years): believe many talented people want office get house couple hours know they've done part soon get back home. 

Some get lonely, want get away kids couple hours, others want direct way watch Youtube together instead getting report done. Looking you, Stevie. 

There rules much someone office certain size really able manage without one. know bit cliché shared space certainly helped getting newer people fold developing ... uh ... company culture. heard DOTA tourney still Yes, think criticism heard make smaller countries look worse, better. already normalized, participating. son starts school week lots asymptomatic infections, could dangerous. time tell. Idk bro crazy doctor moving hands lot seems pretty legit. Let's frank LA mass shooting incident well 200 casualties highest record fatalities shooting. comparison entire year mass crime China far less casualties fatalities *one incident.* Guns far easier kill people enmasse designed entire existence, trying sugarcoat going ""Well look, Japan 12 kids stabbed knife!"" ignores 12 children lived raw amount shot shooter MULTIPLE rifles led hundred dead scene going hospital *and* well hundred wounded result ensuing chaos directly killer.

It's flat contest guns make far easier kill enmasse. soldiers using cleavers war? really awful. usually absolute dogshit weather, ball really tiny, shitty, unimpressive little thing. Every year see tourists crushed disappointment see lol. I'm going play devil's advocate risk votes, suppose. Really want generate conversation.

From social standpoint, obviously people agree protests justified. virus containment standpoint, okay mass protests concerts? “New method: “A fatality counted due COVID-19 medical certifier, usually doctor direct knowledge patient, determines COVID-19 directly caused death. method include deaths people COVID-19 died unrelated cause.”


Old method: “DSHS previously counted COVID-19 fatalities reported publicly local regional health departments received notification verified death. length time process takes varies jurisdiction provide timely demographic information fatalities.””  suger lobby powerful tried failed, food labeling laws need alot work. Thank that. Everything cool, BOOOOM!!  FR2 covers octave everything small would harmonic. 

Yes, that's part thought champion tier trolling. Yes. close family meet two four time always outside. one us sick, worst happen three others get infected (which great 14!) hard visits short. hot outside. 

We get together outside weeks ago wore mask enter house, even use bathroom. 

Yeah means can't hang day, want use bathroom 5 person household better thinking can't see family. actually see often before. 

I wear mask, bring disposable plates utensils house, drink cans. eat food unless right grill prepackaged, food huge transmission vector anyway. 

It's hard family members really bad setting boundaries other. day mother visited. 63. said hot wanted go inside cool. *I tell mother could come house.* (For safety!) stand firm. can't try. 

The family story active Covid deniers. guy interviewed says regretfully, used make fun people wearing masks. 

They could still enjoyed family time duped conspiracy theories took steps protect themselves. literally lost grandmother propaganda couple's hubris. Maybe not. anything America hiding numbers backlog recently? Cause is, call bullshit. Generally smaller better. There's lower chance someone group virus someone fewer people spread proof degree Harvard doesn’t equal intelligence. always eat masks. bit olive oil great. Right also taking smarter precautions. Well, look what's happened though. Fauci setting good example. Even though they're bubble, people like person responded see sitting without mask think ""fucking hypocrite"" Yes, think teachings valid. end, personally think way still inserting God life, even though recognize something things actually happen like parts material experience, things motion tend stay motion. Interesting read since sample ""disintegrated"" we'll probably never know. Aaaaand MLB insane put players risk r/JesusChristReddit Lol can't dismiss studies basis ""but lab settings bro."" Lab settings meant replicate real world, least good studies, they're peer reviewed well known institutions infectious diseases. Plus, read them, realized almost half population studies based real data past outbreaks. 

Of course masks alone bring curve. they're essential try contain community spread re-open. ""experts"" always advocated masks btw. real ones did. politicians dragged feet deliberately concerned low PPE supplies.  must wonderful people quality life. I’ve never work home 14 day stint amazing thing ever. Typically work weeks 60 hours work night shift I’m constantly exhausted. 14 days felt rejuvenated states Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas Utah.

I don’t see Illinois list. Surprise guy doesn’t know meaning words didn’t read article. hired lockdown. took two buses insurance. table manufacturer (mostly cafeteria sliver went medical tables, hence ""essential."" Wonder they're going fare seeing schools probably reopening that's biggest customer. Expensive, custom tables no-refund policy probably #1 list schools going forward. 
I getting help state (WI) representative get case closed State start filing PUA. Taking bus one highest risk things one time feel justified. also hospitalized year ago two nights due ""viral syndrome"" insurance, going again. Nein Nein Nein Sure, see anyone proposing sending children hospitals though? question slowing number due capacity limits many areas? Looking Arizona that's definitely case excess deaths past weeks 40-70% higher ""I take responsibility"" - think know possible, dumb hard make safer though

You'd think. apparently owners trumpish think clearly. face ethical questions like employers able mandate vaccine employment, accept unemployment refuse vaccine, poor communities access vaccine on.

Questions like seem benign competent government Trump, seem like legit ways try control population free people. places making online learning option. Yeah, saw u/k6bct figured that's amateur radio call.

The thing is, fact. math head. FR2 covers octave everything small would harmonic. Sounds scary though. Nothing “decided” kind conservative judges we’re stuck with. Anyone thinks ever happen delusional I’m getting tested tomorrow. Despite wearing mask taking many precautions could, funeral last week got me. couldn’t leave mom bury mother though. I’d love flu.... (please flu)(I’m fucking tired) I’m 110% across entire country, think enforced within reason. I’m fine police “setting up” public areas often heavily populated, see one person alone getting car without mask write ticket ridiculous. 

Who going infect one around? car? Herself? petty ticket. Similar criticism Fauci baseball game incident. He’s likely around people since started (one wife, god’s sake). friend may someone exact exposures, someone eats lunch (HCW allowed eat lunch, btw. CDC recommends 3 people break room one time). 

It’s unreasonable pull mask you’re alone around anyone outside, bathroom, home, etc. he’s critical, he’ll probably live. said, he’s kind that’s smart enough learn lesson. wouldn’t call “pandemic”, remember NFL get tests, time getting tests difficult, get donate fed allocate based need. 1) NFL 2) fed help 3) Texas would probably rather test less lower total new cases. 

That's analysis broad strokes. get tests US, get tests allocate based immediate need. Testing &amp; Tracing saves lives. even accurate.

There successful vaccines particular coronaviruses before. least couple specific ones veterinary use.

Also, SARS MERS vaccines regarded high probability success exist never completed testing disease eradicated wild phase 3 tests could even begin. It’s ridiculous comparison belittles bravery sacrifice soldiers. would argue football better chance successfully completing season there's plenty time games

I actually think might onto something... played 8 games took 2 weeks games? Sure see around here. sad say I'm glad someone officially stated court case...  football also name thing launches nuclear weapons. No....He funded pandemic prevention efforts removed current administration. things cite require legislation Congress, still moved us right direction issues. 40% that's it? That's actually quite low. Sounds like need government order. Michigan mandate backed $500 fine. 99.9% wear local stores.

But cases keep rising anyways outside stores, people still dumb hosting parties, group gatherings going crowded beaches. long testing schools covid right?

obligatory /s Considering would like people country actually healthy especially whole mess, yes. super clever Ok, know shaming someone wearing mask make less likely wear mask, anyway spite, better person wearing mask spite first place?

In either case, ignoring known effects actions feels good shitty another person.

If want make world better, focus ways actions actually make world better. Anecdotally, know two people left Bay Area good Covid.

One hated job, WFH, time search new one. got 100% remote tech job. moved less expensive city paying 1/2 rent nicer place.

Another guy’s company gave option WFH permanently. took it, moved back parents Colorado, saving much he’ll probably buy house next year.

They say coworkers exact thing. Yea bend combination slowing states along testing capacity limit.  Hospitalizations numbers screwed many states though due change. Missouri, hospitals/state relied completely CDC reporting portal updated hospitalization numbers since July 12th He's symptom, disease. personal Vietnam kind do, hear real god there. jobs involve data analysis, explanation provided seems likely. anyone alternative explanation supposition, would welcome. I'm particularly expert type statistical analysis, changes ham-fisted, makes easy observe. Petitions useless stubborn idiots. constitutional right wear pants, masks? [But see anything really restricts point right place? does. policies certainly deserve criticism, [he pretty funny police people would show Trump's last rally eating junk food intrinsically make fat. calories, matter eating. get fat salad, easily. WOAH! committee? ready need seek help get medication. Ah yes, weekly blame game. First reckless young people, fake death numbers, fake positive tests.

I sure things blamed, can’t keep track guy. see smoker, say ""it's right smoke, able turn around sue tobacco companies gets lung cancer, science reached consensus cancer risks smoking long time ago, blame gets cancer something made conscious decision do"". People disagree someone life choices without going extreme hoping someone dies consequence free will.  absolutely psychotic someone react ""one hope die exercising right free choice"". I’ve joking school Survivor competition year. It’s morbid joke right now, reality going sad scary. wound tight. love golf. making joke. short term 

?????

Capitalism killed planet. Please refer CLIMATE CHANGE. dose 'rona? Germaphobes getting infected yourself. best way avoid infection herd immunity distancing might infected. entire plan get everyone else infected he's safe bunker. reemerge roam freely. incidentally plan get hair cut October. takes hundred thousand/million dead Americans right? big deal /s

Never mind long lasting effects lungs heart, fact studies show reinfected. I'm radio nerd, here. 24,250 - 52,600 mhz. Full wave length radiated signal would smallest, 0.2 inches. expect nothing less Resistance Islamic Radicals (RAIR) Foundation. I’d probably think website parody wasn’t Southern Poverty Law Center calling past. Yeah, there’s big problem herd immunity strategy one talking about: requires 70% population infected, 25% population board idea. never sliver chance 7 10 people country going ok catching brand new, deadly disease spreading families. Somehow, loudest, angriest idiots able influence policy, even wishes overwhelming majority American population. Probably not, thing we’ve gotten right ramping production vaccine it’s even ready. Great....I good another four months. But, least making governors fight PPE steal unknown purposes. pandemic response team would still there. pandemic response playbook would bible follow instead knows (burned up?). numbers would still going CDC and, result, believable us common sense. one act allows things made bulk whatever needed emergency would implemented. bones/basics would there. 

But right, people would still calling hoax, infringing freedoms, storming state/federal Capitol demanding freedom piece fabric get mustaches waxed. They'd claiming Obama creating sharia law requiring masks implementing shelter place.  small sample truly scary. demographic tested relatively young, too.  China likely didn’t let start trial country since candidates become nation grown folks can’t use solid decision making skills? Duhhhhhh didn’t see coming?! impatient taken 4 dummy steps forward go back three idiot steps backwards. logical fallacy hypocrisy amusing  data manipulated? soon cop manhandles someone would become news item examples cited apples oranges. 

While inside, way out, people wear masks properly (cover nose &amp; mouth). Don’t remove reason, including drinking. 

But near one’s car, without people around, lack mask shouldn’t ticket worthy. Yeah maybe NBA NHL make work NFL college football year fantasy. nurses Uz, Becky Becky, Stan Stan. F Heavy fines assholes I’ve seen number comments social media seek discredit number things coronavirus testing, seriousness health threat, etc. presume fake, place go find collection responses common “hoax” talking points?


One example give several people claim know someone received positive coronavirus test result never taken test—this sort story would seem aimed making positive result count seem fraudulent. 


I apologize bad place ask type info. can’t seem find sort comprehensive place type talking points well refuted sources, etc. No, think 19 year old's death less tragic 109 year old's mind spent £200 month commute, I'm pretty happy spend extra £10 month power. really call largely living normal, least yet. Nightclubs, theaters, amusement parks, etc, still closed. Bars restaurants open restrictions. Cinemas started open, fully. People vacation, probably continue work home large extent. vacation larger companies started work shifts half office spaces used. universities high schools open physically again, many still online classes. Restrictions vistors hospitals elderly care centers still apply. I'm dumping anything you.

I specifically addressing ""they're happy following authority"" sentiment shared many anti-mask people...because heard attitude brought plenty, bullshit.

There's plenty bullshit camps, I'm sure. attack specifically. pointing something I've seen. possible picked incorrect inflection trying say. dollars spend days like that, likely bean counters corporate (who get holiday days, way) continue keep stores open. reason stores keep adding hours Thanksgiving service people keep shopping Thanksgiving. 

I'm sure ever worked retail, everything numbers. year's goals set last year's actual sales + amount more. One store worked used make us call sales numbers every hour special sales/events supposed drive traffic store see pacing day's goal.

So, truly believe work, make hard bean counters think profitable store open day. truly care think better store open, spend money. young person. miss friends family too. miss eating food restaurants going coffee shops too. know what? bad.

It's you. go unnecessarily, go without mask on, take non-trivial risk literally killing someone contracted COVID without realizing it. far I'm concerned committing murder.

I care badly struggling isolated. know sucks, least hold potential vaccine next year take there. willing risk people's lives bored isolated deserve absolutely zero respect person. profoundly selfish. already case way back fought bully. vice principal apologized side saying suspend everyone involved knew victim. profit = life saving meds. Yes, do. agenda consists letting spoiled rich white idiots get away racism anymore. ""I know"" excuse decades. may dumb question: example daughter went another procedure tested positive (asymptomatic) included count? I’m hoping case isn’t children hospitalized virus complications. Either way horrible Yuck. 100%. simply guarantee infect anyone. could infect 100 0 host possibilities. Exactly absolutely worry shortage glassware. easy produce, still takes time. shortage toilet paper hand sanitizer. Neither difficult produce, unexpectedly high demand shortage. problem solved, issue months.  never stop spread, slow spread. Recovered / vaccinated persons contribute slowing spread mask, social distancing, restrictions gatherings, especially indoors.

They equally important ending wave pandemic.

Also, getting Chickenpox vaccine may prevent Shingles never chickenpox, guaranteed, people vaccinated chickenpox sometimes get shingles, everyone get booster injected skin called Shingrix turn 50. consensus Hydroxychloroquine? seeing conflicted studies various doctors. know originally used fight Malaria. Anyone insight? what. Practically every country that. fact China locked cities begin alarm bells ringing course cherry pick this. Yes. People misquote and/or misinterpret says time, including article. oh know, hence put can. shame many scholarships adhering pandemic Balkans lockdowns. Bulgaria strict lockdown specific time elderly people go stores (when nobody else could) fines outside without good reason essential work - also included able walk kids parks, allowed walk dog. Yet, Balkans huge surge infections - larger spring increase deaths too. get real family dying something warned about. Phobias generally rational, even thing reasonable fear. know, Trump germaphobe fears germs laughing behind back tiny hands thinks leak secrets NYT. Makes much sense anything else days.  Actually US’ shutdown pretty much long deep western average, way deeper longer successful countries, like Denmark.

You compare shutdowns putting various places many us asked stay home wear mask go out. man gave life caring sick. contrast heart-wrenching. already better really arguing Puerto Ricans deserve representation vote anyway. really really hope teenager, otherwise quite sad.

Strawman. say all, know it.

I said, repeatedly, I'm favor becoming state. I'm going pretend lack representation big misjustice want make justify removing representation.

Nothing removed. 2012 even vote majority statehood. So, prior 2012, majority PR people want become state, thus get representation cost paying taxes. Sure, things change, vote majority. That's great! feel though injustice carried out. Change happen seem uneducated dismissive, think convince since requires certain level empathy understanding politics seem have.

And run ways misrepresent opponent twist words around, resort personal attacks. Nice. 

I get it, want statehood. want representation. know, well do, everyone supports view PR. guess people agree matters personal opinion ""stupid."" Well, good luck changing people's opinions atop high horse set upon. want live planet anymore. constitution backwards.

Florida probably double deaths current since excess deaths double accounted covid. “tHeY’rE fAkIng dEaThS!” Apparently 700,000 people need die everyone get it. Maybe even then. worst thing story comments. Stupid not, clear lot Redditors commented *want* people get sicker even die kind ""Darwin Awards"" retribution.

I’m (now formerly) teacher. resigned last week bc health risks classroom. refuse choose job health. proportion kids get ill remains small, good, unfortunately also help hide effects schools opening contribution community spread. adults get sick, transmission attributed work, shopping, gathering, etc... anything avoid blaming schools. Deaths today agree nothing essential traffic, many goods coming Hong Kong mainland necessary can't sealed completely. Time video game sports replace it. Wait.... would employees deserve Black Friday off?! It’s holiday, it’s literally shopping day. That’s like saying someone works sports bar Super Bowl off.

I never gone shopping Black Friday cuz crowds annoy me, worked retail younger days. Never million years would expect biggest shopping day year work. option eat there? Why’d say wasn’t then. Shit, profits dropped 20%, better outsource more.

Sadly \s. That's new low US politics. many already made items PURPOSELY made chewed quickly, dissolve mouth leave feeling satisfied. There's tons Netflix exposes this, learned lot Bars, protests, restaurants. one essential. mention protestors wear masks happen outside. Lol same. saw email first told wife, said already knew WSJ Hahaha.  Miss football, that's silliness

Yes, course, sick person apartment you, you’re pretty much fucked outside living PAPR eating/showering outside. 

About thing aside masks gloves ventilate apartment using bath fans (if truly vent exterior) opening/using fans windows. Absolutely. especially lot us jobs, hard time working/justifying enough hours make ends meet. point NOBODY outside executive pay bubble getting payed deserve, get shitty it, get shitty real moocher class; 1%ers horde wealth. No, didn't.

But again, thank actually checking source instead baseless accusations. coronavirus vaccine? 

I'm aware long term problems recent vaccines.

There plenty viruses cause long term issues. making food. Preparing chicken cooking cooking rice cleaning dishes including ones ate take minimum 40-50 mins. Plus time regularly go grocery shopping price increase cant bulk buy. Also long day work feet, almost hour cooking cleaning would feel impossible. 
Not many ppl see scrambled eggs viable dinner. that, already clothes home wear faces. Maybe efficient mask even scarf sort good job stopping droplets. could done since day 1. Well guess officially kiss 2020 sports seasons goodbye then. Wondering long try drag finally throwing towel though. Ivy League never smart, always rich. Congrats progress! right way often slow way, still counts. insidiously...

all speeding tickets, parking tickets, DUI's... exactly, wish people would know this. status morons wearing masks? They're going pull up! That's US. went chansmokers gig got covid19 shitty autoimmune disorder One rebooks VV late Oct, threw towel finally got money back. idea now. still NCL FCC hanging around somewhere. really miss travel. 

I basically ended infamous Diamond Princess threads. one people assuming overblown till week 3. one favourite groups last year so.

Dear baby Jesus, you? sure sarcasm, that's something like would posted. surely see good idea insurance companies scour peoples' social media, deny coverage based find.

""We noticed exercise 30 minutes today, premium increased we're satisfied level activity.""  likely Russians involved Brexit certain people may want. matter fact, Russia heavily involved Scottish Referendum Boris believed in. hilarious think Trump ""demolished Clinton corruption.""

Trump poster boy corruption, nepotism, conflicts interest. people made fun boy Andrew Yang.... think part 50% population average IQ. “Team sport” help make mlb right answer? team sport players rarely get near other? Yes tennis teams exist amount. even care reply I’m wrong anyway. extra tight end goes slamming full pointback guard end-zone walk walking grand buffet last night. Epic sure. Yeah always sad see action... say miss part said can't read? Covid back April. middle marathon training. feel ok jogging 3-5 miles still def feeling chest. wearing mask seems ok. It’s def hot hot try run early. I’ve seen lot folks running. also coach little league wearing mask too. Donald Trump would call - good guys. fucking kidding me?!! Moderna moderna that.... Sooo many people going get burned investing company even funny. must really good PR firm. 30% without mask. eye covering, Covid contracted eyes.... Ha!  true Sadly, too, true. Thanks additional information - wish clear either way good clarity would helpful! Typical answer. Yup really best there. Give head shake. cannot even read write public school system. many haves, Paying private schools then?  Sweden explicit *weren't* going herd immunity. Swedish assumption would going long time, multiple waves, people able stick harsh restrictions lockdowns long time. suspect last comment probably came kind harsh. Sorry that.

But I've spent adult life 230 +/- 20 pounds, tell eating burger without value meal make ""skinny"" people's definition -- already that.

Losing 20 pounds one point nothing make exercise easier. One big thing *did* make exercise way easier round physical therapy hip pain PT basically said ""you're using wrong muscles walk hip flexors angry"". targeted exercises basically re-teach walk. got PT doctor willing consider something besides weight issue. hoping happy feel like I’m minority athlete’s lives matter much hours enjoyment we’re going get watching sport. 

We okay all. young, healthy still face risks suffering long-term damage. Let’s face it, husband sick suffered long term lung damage could probably still provide family desk job. professional athlete wouldn’t able return job. 

Not mention jobs professional athletes identity. They’ve sacrificed parts lives able pursue sport high level. aren’t able continue sport changes whole life. “Handful black voices Trump” don’t worry dow jones going Yes, note bottom state began adding antigen test results Florida’s case totals earlier month. Antigen tests new category tests detect fragments proteins found virus testing samples collected nose swabs. FDA authorized first antigen COVID-19 tests May.

If understand correctly much likely return false negatives also come back much faster.

We (Florida) also counting positive person negative test per test, per person. fine look daily rate, using draw conclusions time really correct.

I'm expert, think look great. Hopefully continue seeing bad numbers trending down, looks like there's long way go. catch 22 scenario, take measures, lock get this. nothing prevent millions die covid. matter many people die. goodness sake - many dead people take accepted definitely **not** early declare Swedish policy failure??

Spain opened quickly - nightclubs open!! course covid started spreading again. rocket science, covid go does. Cases dropped Sweden people distancing - cases rising Spain people not. clever trick here!! nimbys stfu look what's happening.

The bodies go somewhere. expecting? Reminds Project X, based true story. day remember. Forever! Wow. suspended without pay rest season. complete selfish piece shit. guess point maybe try murder citizens standing way actual life-saving measures.

It's actually easier actually doing.

Edit: thought response something else posted sub.

It’s conspiracy. saying aren’t using data sincerely doubt veracity, really aren’t using it. 

I view malpractice take data face value point. used publicly viewable scientists, that’s true admin collected perhaps curated it.

Let’s put way, tried publish analysis based admin’s data, would refuse let pass peer review would give burden posting raw data verify whatever claim wanted make it. full truth don’t know it’s reliable, undermining credibility fully appropriate. summarizer bot, Here's summary 1976, mysterious new flu began spreading north-eastern United States, President Gerald Ford raced ahead high-profile campaign vaccinate nation. flu strain turned rather mild – vaccine caused several hundred people develop paralysing Guillain-Barré syndrome. debacle central story American public uneasy relationship vaccines. also precedent worries scientific community wrestles deal vaccine hesitancy overblown expectations.

Often abnormally high day, next day is, abnormally, lower. 3rd tends somewhere between, following normal tract on. (Ninja edit.. also, sometimes ""dump"" positives negatives gets tossed really affects daily #)

Yesterday, historically, lower Friday. daily numbers mean squat. Take em, look 3 7 day rolling averages get much better pictures what's reported (since.. knows truly) going on. Generally, public health officials care that. Police care catch act selling minors, giving - event past, much it. People feel like splinter deadly 1918, modern medicine made us invincible.

Just reasons slow burn herd immunity least favorite outcome. Even though looks likely every day.

Plus don’t want roll dice virus either. sucks. we're best. best who's ever new China. one's done better us worst. numbers better countries tried worst numbers. I'll tell you, never seen worst took previous numbers cleaners. Nope. genocide. East Asians already figured decades ago. wear masks flu, cold, even allergies. It’s insane US individualistic don’t even see lol got permabanned without warning CoronavirusUS 4 months ago harsh words Trump fuck-ups. get broke sub's rules, would appreciated warning. mods give damn asked proper explanation temporary ban. Now, similar posts mine place sub. (yes, I'm still salty) here. went hilly area, family locked days, else disabled dad going mad. first CDC telling people wear masks though. I'm sure Russian disinfo culprit instance. either CDC telling ""noble lie"" buy medical grade PPP flat wrong first. 

Now they're thankfully urging everyone wear mask, also first ones say useful. everything op foreign actors, lot time government kinda sucks. 10 minutes inside breathing air lower risk, Although still wouldnt risk without n95 better mask goggles (indoors).

One sneeze minutes someone talking direction (without proper masking them) get (even outside close enough ). meant ""upstate"" like Jefferson, Lewis, St. Lawrence counties. rural NY Trump fuckboys live. outbreaks traced back gyms yet? Trump, Desantis, Kemp name few. Ppl still understand seriousness yet...til hits them. Goes show there's small minority people advance human race, rest plodding along ride. 

As special everyone thinks are, - contribute little advancement species. 

Which fine, course. benchmark AZ passes cases decreasing 10% course 2 weeks, isn’t much you’re starting many. exactly use multiple benchmarks. ignored like warnings ignored. problem try fake like things normal enough something totally unneeded like sports (which love BTW), strengthens perception COVID big deal. We're already trying combat that, particularly dangerous ways considering comment. Well gave example NYC basically say lockdown really prevent spread. strict lockdown people stayed volition started wanted wear masks. particularly cold/wet spring, many people forced inside weather.

I watched every single press briefing NY governor confused kept spreading alot people getting work travel staying home. sudden curve nosedived, protests street parties happened, people calling street parties everyone like ""why BBQs bad protests OK?"" despite drama, new cases per day kept decreasing til hit 700/day state 19M. Total hospitalizations 635, obviously new cases minor. days deaths now. 

It seems like disease runs course done. everyone going susceptible I've known people work covid patients live one get it. law pass onto anyone family quarantined with. made shutdown rules, yet disease still found way old vulnerable ignored young/healthy people out, part. way is. think states keep postponing really helping anyone. best thing stay strong healthy. smoke drink eat much junk, exercise.

I’ve reading tends flare months time hopefully mine going stop soon. I’m heading month two severe pain ass. Hope find relief soon! Look code online order bioMD. usually good discounts. ship fast too. usually get order 3 days. would like to, speak things sometimes, last time uncle started talking Trump beginning blatantly factually incorrect viewpoint felt like would complete waste time. Especially since person, wasn’t whip phone start texting articles. felt like utter waste time reddit comment section, research paper. someone also LGBT, guy pisses off. wants others help pay idiocy? thanks. hate person loses shred humanity towards someone sick types people. really need pepper spray. think may sleep hygiene channel also, sure.

Love asked response was: “Honestly? Theres greater chance they’re going heaven are“. parents afraid kids get published age drinking. That’s really accurate all. I’ve taken care hundreds coronavirus patients pneumonia “deep lungs” 99% recover fine Almost 5 million Canada. serious work yet. ***Some*** do. see care working hard protect others themselves. I'm sure places ***most*** thoughtless, FWIW. Lol u downvoted moved on. want angry? seek truth  gay, Trump-voting conservative who's begging money.

Typical Republican. Never takes personal responsibility.  countries escaped economic toll pandemic. Even Sweden, never went lockdown still massive economic contraction. People get frightened, stop spending, lose jobs, hurts economy. faster get situation control, economic damage minimized. choice public health economy, choice neither. 

With mind, countries controlled virus varying degrees. New Zealand, Australia, S. Korea, Thailand, Cuba, Vietnam, China eliminated disease seeing return semblance normal economic activity. Germany, UK, France, EU countries still transmission managing keep control limited reopening. asked magic bullet, truth none; pandemics disruptive every level impacts widespread. mitigate damage try save lives using tried true methods history. set repairing economy.

If interested reading, I'd recommend Virus, Plagues, History Priscilla Ward's Contagious. also send shorter form reading external structure office co-workers help. people issues executive functioning. It’s rare uncommon. Americans, especially conservative variety, tend self involved think entire world revolves around US. United States completely politicized pandemic? billion people india (3x US) yet fewer deaths per day. Obesity india 7%. obesity US 42%. life expectancy US 80 years. india it’s 69 years. Thoughts? Womp womp  That’s link Wordpress web site organization appear exist May year.  chart linked page cite sources data. It’s exactly credible source. looks like random college-age python script kid threw together try scam donations. 

That said, click around bit site find excess mortality states. three largest gap noted Republican strongholds New York, Massachusetts, California. Honestly probably close. number deaths would estimate really 1 million cases. 

At point would good thing actually true. lol 4 straight 12 hour shifts patients home. Here's hoping nurses dont bring virus 🤞 Waiting patiently visit Peter Pan  Like said before, always dumb asses stick hand fire figure BURNS. understand people stupid. see photo?

No social distancing all.

No masks. worry guys. like flu 

/s Ugh. plan could us going back forth in-person, blended, remote depending numbers. pushed student start date back week train more. little district pretty good. there’s lot community backlash kids wear masks, person matter what. think stick plan though, hope. go back, I’m trying figure kids go remote (parents choose) lessen exposure. sucks. numbers don’t change much, district start person. Anchorage starting virtual. Herd immunity basically means R0 low enough stop spread social distancing times year. Partial population immunity helps reduce spread, \~20% infected NY causing R0 one estimated R0 virus way off. 

If 20% population immune lowers number people infected person spread 20%. NY herd immunity 20% infected R0 would need naturally 1.25.

The 20% contributing stopping growth certainly factor. true. 0 reason Maine, NH, Vermont others need shutdown. fine. true death rate here, that's due lack testing. Even CDC said much. People like pretend we've progressed much since then. big stupid dumbass lmao really think physicians stupid simply unaware lifestyle interventions? 

If easy 'change people's lifestyle', epidemic obesity even various age-related chronic diseases. turns compliance impossible enforce many patients, that's we've develop drugs. 

Also, amount lifestyle change going substantially slow aging, always going uphill battle matter healthy lifestyle one leads.

Turns people differ widely extent self-control - psych literature approx 60% variance trait self-control heritable. gonna do? Blame people choosing right parents? even close. Herd immunity happens 40% 7.6 million NYS theyre saying antibodies gone months 1,000,000 virules started 10 continue replicate 100,000,000,000. matter level load immune system kicks in? k Saw article days ago.

Also plain wrong stadium staff security. obviously need near much staff games thousands fans, definitely still need staff there. There's lot goes running facilities teams game, even without fans. run itself.

For second part, many employees jobs close contact other, even many non player staff. game trainer may required close contact dozen players dealing cramps, injuries, etc. job could done distance probably field first place. preaching people thought flu nothing serious suddenly became serious Covid became issue.  Isn’t responsibility business limit capacity too? Lockdowns still enormous impact mental health regardless. San Andreas fault entered chat. lied beginning covered China. sorry give shit US providing data not. real shame, actually turned around good bit locking relatively quickly compared states (after horrible start obvi)

but last month population gotten indignant following best practices. attorney general fighting governor, sending letters mask orders ""unconstitutional""

We almost smart this. People expand vocabulary reading.

If writer/editor misrepresents medicine fictional work, status fiction change impact?

Where there's correct professional expression(that's adopted here) extremely important people able communicate clearly, muddying waters make argument ideal. still 5 months left! never make obligations, handed full control China backing out.

Way go, really stick China giving power, fucking genius move Trump. Ya needed reason say “I told people Sun Belt didn’t wear masks, conveniently forgot. #🧃🧃🧃🧃🧃
#💀💀💀💀💀  husband also took day trip MI Chicago (Lake Forest/North Chicago area) school-related reasons May noticed thing. everyone masked - properly, too.

If would someone else tucked away don’t know would done, never thought would things get thru weeks did.  No, happen family change them. Unfortunately.with precautions instant tests, Dump get convinced personally. Yes. stay home need something watch tv. Trump seems trying now. Lol Good ole slow boring baseball whole 9 hours, mean 9 innings. Whereas southern US, becomes comfortable outside day September October, they'll start go down. (Then pick back December.) Honestly nobody believed death numbers China, US real shit storm now. certainly knew country referred to. Right, I’m done without 4 salient bullet points spring mind. love bullet point.

1: Never take NHS granted.

2: Don’t believe word comes Politician’s mouth.

3: Don’t underestimate Covid 19. It’s cunning crazy contagious.

4: Thank fuck I’m alive. Yeah dats worried about, lasting side effects disease. never ever seen humans before. Heck, less YEAR since discovered virus. right want bottle come handy someone tries rob something matter? still health risk everyone open. Wait it...  What's circled left several times? Oneida County REPRESENTTTT o/ unlikely reached 'Herd Immunity', although certainly conceivable new infections slowed part due large number people previously affected. spike (i'd hesitate call second wave), part due gradual reopenings. still reopened many businesses despite decline numbers due fear resurgence.

I think country/state reached herd immunity, believe province Italy around 50-60% tested positive Covid antibodies, likely means close herd immunity (if indeed reinfection possible, debate.) guy wants miracles can't accept maybe given signs along.

This systematic destruction American empathy media indoctrination national tragedy epic, almost biblical proportions affecting tens millions families USA even causing worldwide destruction there's little climate action along insane lust war — even outright fascism farce ""law order"" (just Hitler did).

The multi-billion dollar Corporate Media Complex (that includes search engines social media stunts progressive outreach) increasingly influencing undereducated Americans confuse rugged individualism sociopathy — help prop profitable Americans actively agree vote work best interests.

This end result. many people stopped valuing best actively hate worst — FOX News MSNBC cheering hatred on. Americans become belligerent idiots embrace willful ignorance beat chests like dumb apes money-wasting military jets blast overhead.

Congratulations Corporate Media — Cold War scores existential threats — greedy haste money power basically destroyed heart America.

I even recognize country ""A week least"" seems like kind long time bedridden flu people. probably right way many people thinking every time get sick, influenza, feel might also overstating effects vast majority population. No, lets stick Data. Lets say 50 Million school children (there allows fudge room) first focus approx 15 million high school aged. Lets say slightly less ""contagious/transmissible'' adults reduce R0 1/4 (i.e. multiply .75). Lets also adjust R0 fact spending approx 30 hours week high risk (for contracting) environment infected creating high transmission environment homes. think could easily argue higher, lets call 25% lift R0.

You put assumptions initial infected population, easy see ""going data"" numbers potential cases spread outside population little bigger ""a few"".

If want use elementary population approx 35 million, decrease transmission rate significantly. Doubling base population still means going end large number. Additionally, key issue, putting classroom; significantly increases exposure.

That even touch cases among staff often high risk adverse affects. 31 states NY too. People know NY traveling.

OP says they've going four years. people afford keep lawyer retainer long. tell lol happened Arizona? recent study I’ve seen said 20-25 percent people Covid still self-reported cough, fatigue, shortness breath 2-3 weeks illness. It’s new virus sure, that’s actual data have, small study. sure new thing everyone focused upon. 26th, real milestone rate. what's going testing extremely long waits lowered capacity, well Mardi Gras situation back Feb almost one able get tested, may significantly different per capita think. They're isolating Lectin protein, called FRIL, hyacinth beans, turning aerosol, blowing mouse noses.  glycol protein binding effect flu covid viruses. That's probably b/c corona spikes seek entry cell glycol swap IIRC. virus goes bean protein, FRIL, instead entering host system/cells.  Eating beans going anything (except maybe poison you).

Someone real science degree feel free correct I'm wrong. They're already dropping him. Saying states went presidents wishes opened fast. I’ve thinking lately. We’re responding badly we’ve good long US. Republicans serious majorities houses supreme court. chose create plan instead restrictions. republicans fucking too, hold governorship.

You can’t simultaneously preach it’s big problem worth shutting economy simultaneously say number people infected die causes high skew overall death rates 

How many people think die randomly every day many think COVID? It’s usually low Sunday less testing hasn’t 0 awhile, I’m going take win!  Live Key West well, completely concur above.

Also interesting, lots tourists came thinking COVID here. definitely come follow protocols home.

Here keys doubly fucked bc also huge amounts daytrippers weekend visitors Miami-Dade. 

Our govt, city, county, state fed reluctant act again. 

There's even discussion reopening bars! Halsey Beshears, Sec DBPR plans work with, get this! Bar owners talk reopen bars ""safely."" 

!?!?! sure saw last month, gave little lift least *someone* Congress gives damn fact $1,200 supposed bail people unemployed months now? fact one-time thing instead monthly payment crisis subsided? fact majority stimulus went rich, instead average people real engine economy?

Nothing.  big concern restaurants too.

There’s president aids crisis also lawsuits food poisoning cases. Nobody knows would pan out... nobody really wants defending either. know wouldn’t. takes one asshole. country close overwhelming uncontrolled spread seeing southern US. countries specifically? Id like look health economy mention travel social gatherings play this? go hand hand studies show masks alone help lessen spread?

I'm asking I've seeing lot people pushing wearing masks, couple people also saying safe travel hang friends. feels like there's consistency people besides wearing masks. yet death count fraction NY. NY load infected people senior homes (and indemnify operators lawsuits), killing thousands needlessly? You’re back already? Ouch. actually fuck becoming state. They've voted several times always vote it. argument true. mean tell republicans hypocritically projecting?!?! Forget learning, parents supposed actually work? know many jobs incredibly friendly time random. American ""health care"" sword damocles hangs nation. 


Even ""adequate"" health *insurance*, insurance companies make hard possible properly reimbursed. ridiculous. Public health profit making venture. corporations bribed politicians keep way. shame. excuses discovering bacteria such. not. you’re telling since you’re older, whatever say holds value say? Shut fuck lmao, stop childish. You’re fucking moron. Yes, DEM President gets clean gop admin... took 3 weeks get results, test thru Walmart parking lot even really underpaid. ~99% college athletes aren’t money making sports programs, getting awesome deal really. doesn’t seem fair players bringing tons cash getting it: it’s really difficult issue fix. you’ve ever thought possible solutions implications solutions get really tricky complex really fast before. Don’t forget EC vs popular vote got us Obama it’s bad system Worldometer lists recoveries countries like UK, Spain, Sweden N/A makes wonder actually reached 10 million awhile ago. like said, recovered doesn’t necessarily mean health back normal. People that, they’re Florida’s Disneyland. Yeah. Georgia dropped 2700 new cases 3 deaths. Maybe they're full-proof like condemn isn't. Abstinence full-proof quarantining arresting rioters arsonists? Alright. much non-issue, though, anyone bother pay medical debt all? [the common bankruptcy US. Rather, I've led believe discharging debts incredibly difficult; case? 

I'm trying combative; medical system largely incomprehensible us. know administration expects countries ever willing open borders American citizens reported number cases can't trusted. believe rare yes. That's distinction important. Yes, times like ""the surface economy looks strong...a lot folks really motivated vote change..."" May try it, thanks, sounds exactly like need :). usually subbed lentils, work everything. stresses least scored average test. Puerto Rican currently residing island tell pretty messed seeing government screwed working class mind you, let American tourists without testing appeal United States want statehood remain power. boggles mind. 

Meanwhile they're lying numbers half island infected. essence Texan.

Be arrogant condescending clueless asshole get ass handed China education camps right That's never hear people getting infected hot areas. mean, besides southern US, Mexico, South America, Asia, Europe, Australia, Middle East Africa hear hot places high Coronavirus rates? Someone sue contracting corona someone? 

On grounds. party never happend? Maybe kid went party? Victorians meaning people live Victoria, Australia. state Melbourne capital. It’s all. That’s excuse use. It’s fact they’re asked told comply people feel inferior to, get volcanic explosion stupid result. Germans this?  You’re downvoted you’re right. Race nothing here. USA failed like Brazil has. Good point. tropical storm may suffice baseball outbreaks basketball mls (is mls even testing? idea rules are)  Well duh.  43 years pandemic ever dealt with.

What thinking triage bad flu victims every winter hospitals.

And fair, sick going die....does honestly make sense put person hospital bed used someone greater chance living?

I sorry hard time accepting facts. shit goes south, sometimes need make tough decisions.

Having impartial collection doctors, directly involved makes lot sense. Another poster stated better could.

Having triage system avoids additional stress already stressed doctors good thing. Interesting. take it?

its foul taste odour, higher incidence adverse effects taken mouth, particularly nausea vomiting. I'm conspiracy theorist &amp; none that. Putting people groups like gross.  want Christmas man lol hope you’re right people could potentially get inoculated tiny viral load? think point that, due poor initial response, great answer America now. Many experts recommending nation-wide lockdown several weeks. suggest, negatively affect economy, requiring stimulus. best response would 5-week national lockdown March-April, time testing contact-tracing apparatus could established. happen, America uniquely difficult problem solve perfect/magic answer. family FL one nurse. beginning months least them, believe viewed northeast problem, time cases here. whole lockdown masks common place, still plenty people whole nose etc. much thought learned lesson here, maddening watch many around think control here, feel travel now. think we're going right back steady increase cases gets colder schools fully reopen. legal authority Thoughts works technically Edwardians?

I know care either. thing every country succeeded containing virus did: national shutdown robust test trave system. slowly reopen, maintaining high degree caution keep courage go back lockdown/earlier phases reopening moment cases start tick back Deaths rates hiked every Thursday month, that's better measurement point They’re minority too. They’re fucking loud obnoxious spitty causes illusion people. It’s less third country fucking everyone. plenty instances caught normal seasonal flu could taste smell days. anyone mentioned that? able smell taste accompanying “flu-like” symptoms still COVID-19. I’m taking crazy pills asserting statements, right? Cool cool. protestors. can’t see bit says you’re saying sorry. Care copy paste it? Uh, no. seriously don’t see difference?

""Thanks China/Russia/Bill Gates/Big Pharma/World goverment creating coronavirus relasing public""

I idea world people live surreal witness it. I’m planning short trip 60 miles. N95 mask plan following. exit apartment wearing gloves N95 (also face shield), walk elevators. biggest area concern elevator usually contains mask people. empty go ahead get parking garage. plan switch gloves, use cloth mask replacement inside car.

I device need use restroom go car (so would go restroom!).

Once arrived destination plan put back face shield cycle gloves cloth mask.


Let know suggestions. Thanks! go visit r/waltdinseyworld people idea anything wrong world. ELI5 version take nickel double every day 20 days. would infection without mask.

Now penny instead, would mask.

Tldr: initial viral load matters exponential growth. post pics? \#15DaysToFlattenTheCurve Thank much well thought response citations. honestly able understand plot relationship X-axis, understand now. things hard see happening, agree years year year comparison bring clarity whether alarm warranted. 

Also, last line rushed vaccine family first line COVID-19 vaccination. I'm anti-vax, I'm also become space monkey. Thank again. ""Cheap airfare babe, let's it!"" /s healthcare plan max pocket, cost much? Preach. Yeah going say resistance HEPA filter issue, throw extra fans. shit-ton them! feel entitled, think they're saving economy them. Beyond ridiculous! ones care managers first place. administration, longer Goodwin's law... direct copying. confirm, southern Californians apparently won’t let tell do. Biggest reason seems like mask compliance going grocery stores retail stores seem stating they’ll refuse service without one.

It’s gotten much better, still see people wandering around without one.  Chant China Flu many times. Like war invaded chant China Invasion many times would magically end. Hey maybe answer question-

Would sacrifice 0.6% people 0.5% people? 

Would sacrifice 99.5% people 0.5% people?

Its easy question. pregnant fully locked down. exhausted it. 

Just saw friend mine post wedding Malibu w everyone close together without masks... makes want rip hair out. Indoor-outdoor wedding. 

Everyone fuck self-discipline stay home end already. assume I’ll ask next time see her. meant actual vacations. road trips. Driving Vegas. home day 2 kids. won’t risk them. see families like nothing going on. seeing Americans using high numbers. Americans value privacy even pandemic absolutely still possible could stop counting deaths. can’t see it, doesn’t exist Link doesn’t work. Breaking news! Couple points here. 

You jumped cooperating contact tracers *all protestors*. absurd. 

All article says contact tracers asking went protests directly, though asked indirectly around large crowds, would offer information voluntarily. 

There's plethora reasons might this. One that, know contact information everyone protest, telling immediately help them. Telling everyone else contact much valuable, something house party That's injustice. agree this. Someone assaults shopping cart, pepper spraying fine me. Shame Ralph's Oh come on, police deescalate, that's high standard. Lol good luck tough guy. 

You probably haven’t left basement since started. exactly NFL major longshot. would massive roster issues Totally thing, got em! count things makes happy see many

Have ever tried purchasing CBD rich hemp online making tinctures it?

That's we've home past year. lady issues cost buying commercial cbd oils making us broke!
 
Nowadays make oils home savings huge, mention we're rolling cbd!

We pickup oz ""smalls"" little $28 (USD) . 17% CBDa weight..thousands mg. CBD potential comes oven.
It's good stuff helps us tremendously. bit irresponsible. should’ve gave people option return back. Nova Scotian Austin here. Best luck, friend! often like NPR.

I honestly forget small people’s world is. family, friends, acquaintances old work colleagues dozen US states half dozen countries across three continents. wonder situation news item don’t trust news source talk directly.

And taught school family seek information important topics look biases.

I moved diverse pretty dense urban area south, distressing number people around cannot conceive different viewpoints exist valid time. people different life experiences. choose one two focused sources follow (often pastors faux news channels) completely ignore deny anything doesn’t fit narrow world view. believe everything Facebook matter says says long conforms beliefs.

One friends lived tiny Missouri town 19. Never spoken black person managed get go college. made Lot adjustments old worldviews. large proportion family barely talk he’s “corrupted evil ideas.” ""It's freedom pull lever, right dictating do!"" - asshole would anyone write article stupidly obvious... slow news day part social distance haven’t left house substantial way since pandemic. first. Karens Kevins refuse wear masks need sent island misfit anti mask wearers. Hey, we! even generate profit! prison industrial complex great? Found idea fuckhead. thought talking china virus. Try keep shut fuck up. little power. Expound please ^(the scientific publishing industry really weird stupid system. pay privilege selling content. this, spawned separate lucrative business sham journals publish anything give provided pay. often one gives articles mind impact factor journals trash reputable researchers know fake journal see one sadly gives fodder conspiracy nuts leads shoddy science.) Keep Atlantic Bubble closed.

The last thing Atlantic provinces need allow free travel place west New Brunswick. Stay home.   understand concept outlier statistics? 'numerous' articles reporting on. I'd love to. completely agree ok US 12 years remove circulation, extra money printed 2009 2008 fuckups, COVID19 printing take 2045 adjust inflation remove money, assuming US go bankrupt then. English news article lockdown news?  think uninsured poor working people going seen first signs illness continue go work delusional. literally camps. That's point Archive everything! sucks, least fired.  triggered live state comment want. live California true point every time southern California reason California looks like Texas Florida.

 Northern California, especially Bay Area, job keeping social distance wearing masks southern California got vids beaches flooded wearing mask huge house parties hills. Despite San Mateo Santa Clara reopening bars door dining huge spike like San Diego Los Angeles.

That's top 6 coronavirus counties California major southern California.

So chill, bro. Right? I’m looking forward inevitable excuse response too.  Deaths best indicator they're also delayed indicator Lost insurance due pandemic went ER 3 weeks later Covid symptoms. 6 hours sent home. 

Costing $3,660. room $1,300. Ok, goes, although I'm sure there's point. get feeling get information one source, listen other... (I recommend read Karl Marx Ayn Rand, see different points views, realise they're missing point...).


I'll treat claims one one...


- unions work taxpayers, negotiate employers (be private government), generally (generally!) members, sometimes work taxpayers (counterexample you: limiting number student per class)


- ""this democracy"": union democratic well, most, much US (I imagine ""this"" refers US...), saying shows bought propaganda, ""plutocracy"" closer truth US, although kleptocracy also suggested... (look words, learn something...)


- ""The taxpayer’s vote decide governing schools"", imagine meant ""governance of""... would great, system called ""anarchy"" (not one brainwashed with, ""anarchy"" we're witnessing US now, no: one people vote every aspect society), much doubt school governance decided taxpayers vote country, furthermore think unions decide school governance, either live parallel universe forgot take medication; know system country school governance generally decided institution generally called ""school board"", union negotiates it, rarely dictates (look words, wonders vocabulary understanding world...)


- ""Teachers unions unelected bodies"": course are, that's like saying Starbuck unelected, created (not elected) negotiate employers, REPRESENTATIVES generally elected


- ""put teachers self interest children taxpayers"": would...


- ""often exercise undemocratic influence education tax policy, among things"": democracy balance interests, exercice interests democracy (well, living real democracy...)


When said know start, meant tip iceberg. tiny grasp political ecosystems (I mean politics, mean political, philosophical sense...), there's way could explain you.


I strongly recommend start studying philosophy, develop critical thinking. cases one day meaningless 

It one day. Look curve. 5 6 8 days know this.

Using ""you"" changes discussion facts personal attack.  wrong this.

The death totals [in chart France Coronavirus chart, France reached total 0 deaths Jun 24 subsequently July 11, 12, 13, 18 reached 20 less numerous times. 

It's really hard ""blame"" someone Reddit this.

But managed know this.

This ""blamed"" claiming France ""meaningless"" 0 one day. even true!

Why singled ""claiming"" even true?? false statement. France achieved 0 cases form multiple days less 20 even more.

When US gets close 20 let know. need medical science *not* politicians deny medical knowledge ""take space.""


Leave alone. make ""you"" statements statements include name. remember use 'good' sub. basketball started. 

basketball games one place. 

MLB traveling. 

I think USL soccer started faring well AFAIK.

&amp;#x200B;

all get tested every 2 days. least, plus symptom checks.

if run temp, go home, example. Yep. live one places. least hospital 2 ICU beds access medical care without flying Anchorage. runs around could get bad quickly. I’m pretty nervous school year start. elementary teacher one kid middle school another high school. going go small bubble, contact hundreds others every day (cumulatively) overnight. Yes. 

Traveling downfall. 1 10 people covid get diagnosed means.. 

10.000 new infections actually mean 100.000 new infections day, rather, 1-2 weeks prior due incubation period. covid death rate 1% would mean 1000 deaths day... numbers pure speculation course 1000 deaths day would crazy..  effort compensate lack tax revenue due actions, shifting revenue generation taxation fines, turning normal folks criminals process. guess France got jealous US War Drugs criminalizing otherwise law abiding people reaping billions profits government, finally decided get action. would see uptick building/house fires... 146,000 Americans died COVID-19 - nearly quarter global total — nearly 4.2 million confirmed cases country, **at least 1 79 people infected.**

Good news guys. get 79 times worse worst! Base policy science. 

Stick science. 

Trust science advisors political advisors. 

Have strategy stick it. Adjust tactics based science goal reopening safely. 

Think beyond news cycle.

Hang portrait Harry Truman office quote, “The buck stops here.”

Don’t scapegoat countries public. Play hand you’re dealt deal countries private. 

Use Twitter public safety messages. 

Use bully pulpit stand conspiracy theories. 

Talk predecessors learn successes fighting previous pandemics. 

Swallow. Your. Pride. 

Act interests Americans. together. 

Model safe behavior. Wear mask. Implement strict social distancing PPE requirements public events. grocery stores it, politicians supposed leading. 

Study governments reduce case numbers significantly reopen economies. Compare efforts compile “lessons learned” report implement recommendations. 

Gain understanding saying, “No pain, gain.”

Work states ensure tools need succeed. play favorites based political personal reasons. 

Do pit states other. 

Repeat phrase: “It’s me”

Admit mistakes, learn them, adapt don’t repeat them. 

Show Americans care. Worser Trump vindictive punk. Pro-Life ass. I've sending grandma gym.  Thanks data pointers. see numbers drop-off Seattle? city level detail data? Glad see anti-masker get deserve.  fear idiocy may deadly obesity year. say trigger offending first I'll never speak out. go looking it. I'm responding.

Dont like trigger. Thank taking time send note. feeling like must wrong since principal teachers seem ready get school back running. It’s private school might financial incentive school seem eager students back. son really well distance learning end last year guess really isn’t rush get back. guess feeling like maybe overreacting since parents school seem board going back school. Luckily new work projects came work home. without work March 15 couple weeks ago. know many parents go work order provide school back sort necessity. can’t imagine going work out... corporate jobs

lol Youtube stars exist bubbles influence. Tom Hanks predates youtube much larger mainstream culture since cost producing content much expensive. never another Tom Hanks again. I've stood stance entire time sufficient evidence proof. know, actual burden proof, guilty beyond reasonable doubt proof. Proof would legally go court unless think spider operation going inside investigation clear Rick Scott, would conspiracy theory.

I'm saying corruption exist actually one arguments trying make monetary issue. said corruption systemic almost elected appointed officials corrupt. However mean I'll accuse man serious allegations even enough evidence warrant charge let alone prosecution. 

Just stop. problem right now. Well, one many. People like person responded live chance misrepresent people said order make seem moral good. deep pieces shit know it. head USA could something golf get us greater ability test. Every country world dumb testing issues have. ""Slow testing down"".....moron charge. bet bully liked say I'm touching I'm touching shirt. people might believe know him, personally. That's way denialism get reduced. ""good news"" long everyone knows someone sick died Uber Karens south sucks! People changed, going business getting hair done, eating out, bars, etc. social distancing staying home since schools closed March. Unfortunately, husband still leave work, do?

Our friends parties, dinners out, play dates hermits! Define responsible though? Responsible realistic sense r/coronavirus sense? 

I’ve bars/resteraunts people would say isn’t sensible. I’ve felt safe measures they’ve taken country cases atm. haven’t socially distanced main friend group since started going pubs resteraunts don’t sit apart what’s point? 

I’m keeping distance friends elderly family course strangers. won’t catch mad house parties anytime soon example. I’m wearing mask everywhere, washing hands often on. id call reasonable precautions. I’m sure folk sub would agree That’s point. Institutions gutted point powerless. happens administration whose goal destroy regulation. thought judging 1918 Spanish Flu? propose change lyric 4th July classic, Lee Greenwood, to: ""I'm proud ""mainland"" tourist, least know I'm free...."" 

Would also alleviate need explain word, ""American"", folks like you, slang everyone world said, means ""mainland tourist"". made realize whole thing us trying save themselves. that’s weird hits. think still ended describing idiots.

Maybe idiots, decidedly mediocre people.

My faith democracy rocked bit. two graduate degrees reached 1% 30s. 

Everyone always claim elites make decisions, saw 2016 that's painfully true. Yet everything seen popular democracy making decisions has... impressed me. crowds crap.

What's basic, honest reaction? Thank fucking goodness live superzip deal people high school deliveries practically ever life. Looks like would waste time anyway.

Now acknowledge unfair terrible, would lie claimed feel it. look EU see sort selfish idiocy feature democracy such. I95 South looked busy hell yesterday today passed ramp. doubt everyone headed Fort Lauderdale whatever. must caught covid “mildly.” im 22 immune system trash (think colds last month year catching strep flu every single year despite getting vaccine) bad asthma. wore mask every time left home rare. live alone. sorry im still salty im still seeing people parties ive super isolated still got sick Hurricane parties live? would also interesting look greater Vancouver area compared parts Canada. AC nearly common around Vancouver weather much temperate throughout summer. far BC seem lower numbers. mention start EVERY play NFL anywhere 8 10 guys directly facing feet away. Folks get close soccer, aren’t actively breathing others faces every 2 minutes. one lineman gets covid slips whatever protocol is, basically everyone else line going get it. Covid? district attorney told I'd get immunity testified... Guess who's next? Yeah. keep getting people operating don’t history behaving bad faith over, over, again. Right, who’s pounding heads it’s bad idea? Wife beater tank top bbq stains , Same. thought “a glass” unspecified amount (hence shot glasses). article says driver's name Juan, explains oink patrol arrested him. He's lucky though, name George cops would killed him. feel like heard Peter Navarro know where. I'm pretty sure mixing Eddie Nero Californication wit last name saying absurd things lol increasing atomization culture. old person thing thinking know them. lots micro celebrities particular subgroups. Im sure bill millers happy personally think disgusting cringing even donations especially considering treated others trying play safe. great point, it’s known “Harm reduction” cases safer sex.

For instance AIDS could stopped completely people would get HIV test monogamous sex getting tested, that’s life works, “ABC” strategy (abstinence, faithful, use condom) actually shown success preventing HIV spread. make white owners billions suffering intense physical damage (sometime permanent) receive major communication university Alabama. That’s least equitable trade I’ve ever heard of. yes went attack everyone defended it. 

you’re fucking hypocrite you’re clearly intelligent enough see it. you’re also intelligent enough get thoughts once.

the way tell keep religious beliefs myself, way tell keep non beliefs yourself.

and way spelling quick fixes, turn one sentence reply whole paragraph points people didn’t originally see.  know clueless, denial

Got friend like this, lives tiny town. lockdown, mask mandate, nothing changed her. I’ll never understand trump didn’t this. Covid slam dunk 2020 win somehow Trump fucked up.

he could leveraged virus justify stronger border protections too. might gotten Silver lining Biden elected

That'd pretty thin tarnished lining best expect now. hope following election get real change actual progressives ballot move us forward. Bubba done us wrong! Oh know it. I'm honestly looking forward election already see next 4 years might look like. I'm age never seen anything quite like before. selfishness display whole new level. Chinese number could 100% higher reported. Big yacht  wonder simple greed. think lot folks bought narrative virus hoax aimed discrediting opposition, remaining denial might motivated greed, avoiding pesky old cognitive dissonance saving face. sure. Antibody surveys done months ago showed 15% state’s population virus would 2.8 million people. However Louisiana also pretty significant early outbreak least New Orleans. one reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face. *Gladyshev – one world’s leading experts causes ageing – could help ponder academics pharmaceutical companies across world heading wrong path.*

Spelling quick fixes. Sue me

All said 

If God bless them. survive: cancer, chemo covid.

Is attack? phrasing Okay. report business then? currently recommended right now. sure true. 444 new deaths Sunday seem Sunday data  South Africa also 80% Africa's European population done science, know tests created equal rely trained person execute interpret.

The reliability test done layperson home consumer-grade equipment vary quite bit particular test. totally fine many situations stakes low time essence, like using OTC blood pressure cuff take blood pressure. numbers bit put right, I'm probably going suffer bad consequences.

An important aspect medicine think understand *applied* science. Doctors like engineers way. troubleshooting complex system, individual tests useful sometimes provide context need make right decision.

In example, heartbeat-listening device answer question ""is baby's heart beating right now? y/n"". That's certainly important question get answer for, real question trying answer situation they're discussing. real question ""my baby suddenly stopped moving -- anything wrong, what?"" high-stakes, time-critical question. point going doctor run tests, doctor look several aspects situation time see notice anything abnormal. next time hear insane theory “plandemic” someone saying hear political figure satanist. came facebook post . 

 2016 kept hearing batshit insane stories HRC coworkers. mean insane shit. Like pedophile ring , satanic cult, etc. everyone traced back dubious facebook post . That’s literally it’s called.

Where fuck getting Viral load, also known viral burden, viral titre viral titer, numerical expression quantity virus given volume fluid Democrats Republicans use massive debt argument reduce healthcare spending increase war spending. general, immune system brings big guns, likely you’ll long lasting immunity. vaccines fine balance making immune system respond strongly strongly serious side effects. There’s several “layers” immune response, clear threat get involved might develop strong immunity. immune system complicated, it’s straightforward presented here, that’s general trend. could stop counting deaths. can’t see it, doesn’t exist “deadly COVID-19 virus” That's hilarious, think people cooperate tracers Didn’t already happen 2008-2010? Yes, I'm sure Bolsonaro change ways, hipster Dutch city called out. even get chance fight back punished kicked head drawings fit clean room? President promise survive 65 offered discount qualified medical procedures. don’t understand nation regress much short time. It’s insanity. posted dead link please feel free post haha I'm angry hell, even experienced harsh reality virus. know angry country know angry people allowed happen. Ordinary people chose selfishness fellow citizens. People know, too. Seeing posts about...I'm furious. 

So, yeah, anger trauma healthy recipes. virus take Sunday go church something?

Tagging along hosts church worked really well virus far. Bars night, church morning make SARS-CoV-2 happy microorganism.

Edit: getting spelling SARS-CoV-2 right  People always miss orange elephant room. forgot Sun Belt got spike. needed reason say “told so” months seeing spike. Ignoring important factor allowed us gloat “stupidity” problem this. 

My brother thinks like flu it’s blown proportion. he’s person treat people every day. Give comfort intubate anything that’s actually difficult. talk loved ones options video chat. talk afterwards cry feel kinds guilt loved ones dying alone. (I’m either) 

You’re right. It’s real happens YOU, what’s happening people around isn’t OK either. 

It’s OK people change minds, doesn’t make less selfish person beforehand. considering size density nyc population alone, paired scale outbreak. get whole entirety rest state they’re bringing like 500 cases daily... seems shockingly low. people depression chemical imbalance hot take. natural result world getting better culture says should. dude gotta stop editing comments, get first time.

In case strawman argument A) **COMPLETELY LEAVES OUT** rest world. South Korea, Germany, Japan even Nova Scotia ""ruled out"" one single statistic '1030 cases France' made **without even reference whether cases increasing decreasing.**

That one statistic continually brought without regard size country whether cases increasing decreasing many deaths there. (only 10 per day France vs 1,000 US) happens rest world.

You sound misanthropic.

Edit: downvoted factual dissent. Seems right sub now. Outdoor transmission extremely low, period. isn’t even controversial. NYT lead medical reporter went far call small masked + distanced outdoor gatherings “safe” based current state research infection data.

Note died 1900 US basically behaved like country. 

Federal government 50 state governments made ZERO preparation pandemic, despite pandemic started China gave 2 months head start. Basically ""until happens me"" attitude, country level.

Then even virus starts spread US. People every level, way President think ""it's flu"", ""it'll go away like miracle"", ""pray away"". Despite plenty evidence data China would suggest otherwise.

Then US failed adopt proven effective measures like wearing mask May 2020? FYI China mandated mask wearing January 2020... else many want make “great again?” Can’t great without acknowledging decline fashion.

Ironically, people wanted ""great again"" hurt common cause common cold rhinovirus coronavirus tons strains different viruses cause cold exactly same. One cold may rhinovirus, 3 months later could adenovirus, 3 months later maybe coronavirus. Hard extrapolate much based colds. hope lost. Also Reddit pt2: trace blm protestors. Cite? Reddit fine Yup, Rupert Murdoch’s empire slowly eroding democracies freedom world wide. made half country believe healthcare treason they’re trying take away freedom! Brainwash population media let nut job like Trump run. Rest history. That’s basically happens US too. think laws don’t really get enforced unless students found passed drunk something. sounds grueling. there's three options:

1. Get hotel. Look ones taking precautions. Try find one area popular (as in, place many people stay).

2. Stay friend/family member overnight.

3. Go camping! weather's pretty nice recently (I'm Utah), plus would help break monotony driving get fresh air. definitely safest option, since need interact others, would require research sites open.

If else fails, sleep vehicle, though pretty difficult. common colds caused rhinoviruses.  got deserved. Yeah places can’t afford hire anyone else. Considering places can’t 50% occupancy. businesses suffering can’t afford spend anymore money already spent. kind Americans talking too. can’t even get people social distance states. Making masks mandatory basically last possible option.

Can’t close interstate travel one states assholes completely free spread plague around. Fuck WHO. Intent always scapegoat crimes humanity. Really questions depend number (active) cases area, area bubble. 

I'm cautious, wear mask, try limit extraneous trips, also area cases, NH, may deem safe may totally unsafe area lot cases and/or densely packed population.

We going risk management, good Phoenix may good NYC, London, wherever are. camera kept programs proctor see  Lots people disagree, don’t think term limits president. Lots countries don’t works fine usually happens party gets sick you, country does, get sick retire. Don’t know would implement US system though. 

Judges however, think need appointed (usually still don’t fully understand US system besides Supreme Court judge gets in)  COVID flu real it’s terrible someone passes, anything. numbers way worse that: voting population knew care. well know Trump is. Ppl care. Agreed! Can’t get loan today like could back then! don’t think all-outdoor bbq despite referred such. surprised wasn’t least little detail shared essay. Everything know thing far strongly indicates outdoor transmission vastly reduced therefore low risk. 16+ people ultimate contracted “backyard bbq” I’m guessing people weren’t really hanging back yard much probably inside close together. Agreed. Things seemed ""stable"" many years. hood constant leaks. eventual would break down. Honestly think 9/11 warning wakeup call react horror people connect dots major scheme things.

In lot ways can't blame them. There's many distractions person's day day, keep date world events, know? help media USA pure propaganda ""Should customer become violent, remember thank loyalty offer coupon."" Worldometers. banned lot them

Pushing misinformation sub banable offence. Idk guy work swears masks harm good. refuses wear one dangerous are. Saw thing YouTube did. Sure education works car dealership sure seems expert. Example, heart attack go ER die. Apparently tested even got hospital came back positive. Listed Covid death

Since COVID vascular disease, prove underlying cause heart attack. mean, sides aisle though, sides aisle US right wing. choice far right center right. Obama many things Trump done mass deportations, mass incarceration, bailouts super wealthy people, tax cuts wealthy, cracking social unrest police military (occupy), etc. Establishment dems marginally better, Obama Clinton directly led Bush Trump. Biden different, telling Wall Street come them, authoring crime bill gave mass incarceration PoC communities, proposing cuts Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, etc.

If dems actually moved left stopped taking dark money doubts they'd stomp Republican party existence, refuse sweet sweet cash. mean, dems like Pelosi Kamala Harris even agree measly 10% cut military recently. 10%. also voted taking troops Afghanistan. painful. used work Dubai! guess easy stay home social distance 47 celsius outside 😀 article took 24 hours write source numbers taken USA enough daily cases make difference. USA adds 60-75k cases day two days add cases Canada total. seriously think upwards 80 million brainwashed people US? live decent balance left right, majority conservative liberal people meet reasonable, independently-thinking people. can't act like country split Democrats idiots port potties would safe, they? Since risk comes flushing.   Yeah. vote president November, actually vote president. like opinion poll. votes tallied, state legislature (aka public) choose electors officially vote president.

Now practice, electors pre-selected vote presidential cabdidate, electors previous pledged candidate automatically chosen behalf.

It meant create buffer uneducated masses charismatic unworthy (think Hitler type) holding office.

As said great Agent K, ""A person smart. People dumb, panicky dangerous animals know it.""

Since creation, 33 states (and D.C.) passed laws obligating electors vote pledged candidates, essence means must follow state's vote.

That means quarter states, including high-value states NY, PA, TX legally allow electors vote different actual vote. Reagan helped fascist dictators take power. country fascist tumor need get rid get rid us Texas much lower positives trend, track record Sundays much lower cases reason. California also well trend. think states seeing stability, drop that. daily total US 7 thousand would expected. I'd surprised back 65k+ tomorrow. Yeah, that’s case every Sunday. deaths.  Term limits congress would solve lot that. Come man, historically could make argument, right now? even close true. simple taking step back keeping distance people effective mask?

I would say social distancing easiest way stay safe. much effective using mask, me, obvious choice.

But live Europe. risk getting shot wearing mask. stores restaurants make sure social distancing possible stores, neither interest use rules demanding everyone wear mask. That's unfortunate side effect placate conservatives demand lives sacrificed economy. I'm 2 degrees separation PhD medical research insisted called ""doctor"" even put Dr. name tag... handed defibrillator panels went ""Ph.D!!!!"" think OP saying goggles shield apropos pepper spray may sound harsh, 45 dog whistling white supremecy shit last 3.5 years, November needs get pos wh Decades. controversial? know virus made.  thought worth acknowledging we’ve least managed turn testing around quite bit since terrible start, something think isn’t talked enough.

You’re right though. Sometimes feel like can’t mentally process hatred president point. nearly puked election night even never would imagined this. want die mean deserve it. selfish thing suggest. Wow! first medal. seriously House Stark words hard times. usual words are, “Summer coming “. think somebody point paid quarter million dollars mostly awful people. Uh, OK. People screeching top lungs standing top protests cases continued decline since happened, (NY) doesn’t even pay federal taxes matter

Funny call us American Tourists county? NY call WI American Tourists? don’t, Puerto Rico different plain simple serious problem bus drivers. believe, without evidence, prosecutors working case bastion moral fortitude within corrupt department?

Cheap holiday people's misery. assume commenter meant “U.S. good throwing money corporations underpay employees produce innovative/needed commodities”. Pretty sure real risk Dr Fauci Trumpicans text death threats. Looking indoor super-spreader event case studies, class rooms seem like perfect environment: windows usually open, lots people talking, long exposure know even young kids spread virus, know super-spreaders, enough evidence say sure point. case environments prolonged close contact lot riskier environments like grocery stores people pass quickly. hurricane hoax make us give guns, y'all. It... uh, neighbor's Buick floated by? big stupid dumbass lmao Seriously, anti imperialist media US, even far left outlets like Jacobin. either infiltrated (Jacobin) bought (vice).

You guys remember seeing mainstream media saying John Bolton good week ago? fuck that. know. biggest untold truth airplanes infectious AF. American Airlines stopped flying Hong Kong HK Airport Authority requiring cabin crew get tested arrival. HK’s second wave began infected pilot according local news. flying dangerous unless you’re ready wear full PPE gear refrain eating/using bathroom duration flight. yet see passengers trying fly without gear on. Ahhh! Glad got out. Cross fingers escape soon. Maybe immunity learn past people alter past present? NYC? ordered sofa \~two months ago stuff re-opening, supposed delivered tomorrow. live alone apartment, either delivery people come inside never get living room. everyone wearing masks keeping six feet apart, increase safety measures? open windows (I AC anyway). powerful air purifier use, work well windows open. also ceiling fan turn on, sure wise run? Literally crying. want things get better visit mom, who's 74. hate non-mask wearers. like judge others different opinion. opinion hurts communities health? Please go die fire. Generally yes. insurance might pay one test. regions might government program paying running testing center.

What’s less discussed cost sheer misery finding whether insurance pay it. rarely get straight answer effectively end gambling hundreds thousands dollars unless you’ve got time get writing beforehand. never said anything compared US

That may be. ""strawman"" me. whole argument US needs medical doctors **help it** reason entire thread. still US territory. really conversation?  Shocker. look today's numbers, 400 something dead US, 1000+ day according worldometers. virus take Sunday go church something? People keep mentioning difference northern CA handled vs. southern CA. interesting compare norcal/socal states. Bay Area (where I'm from, live) population around 7 million people, population basically equivalent Massachusetts. bay area first area nation lockdown, since significant amount spread Santa Clara County early on. We've 45k cases 9 bay area counties, 40% cases MA. hand, yesterday 600 new cases, we're much worse there.

We could also compare LA county (~10 million) MA. They've 175k cases total adding 3k-4k cases per day recently. That’s awful hope person gets rightfully ostracized. regulars proudly told they’ve eat two days since dine restaurants state reopened May 21st. catch COVID, could potentially spread like ten different restaurant staffs. That’s neat. 

They also political mask on. I’ll leave guess support of. subreddit saying on? somewhere filled insane people? that's said GoFundMe. entire website. that's reason essential businesses closed, even stricter guidelines businesses open? 

Not everyone wear mask properly even wear one. Surgical masks porous cloth masks provide much safety. flu joke. 20,000-60,000 people US die every year, that's par traffic fatalities (which also horrible). Whenever someone said ""oh flu"", either ""just"" cold, really got flu ass kicked week least. think idiots mistaking colds flu ruined term culture.

A bad flu killed twice many people WW1, less time. someone says COVID ""just"" flu, nbd, seem super ignorant me. like saying house fire go ""oh, ok, might blazing, smoky inferno trapped inside"". Even medical condition, bad manners argue people job. Thanks working essential job btw. state journey MI Chicago hubby pick something business. thought city MI really good mask compliance blown away everyone saw Chicago inside outside wearing mask. back May. Uh...what? vaccine. political issue politician sign document force vaccine through. needs developed tested. Last time checked 12 companies working it. Obviously wants first. can't force plant grow can't force vaccine out. nothing president is. Also, heard seen Biden past years? unhappy covid related responses now, heck think shell man better? Let’s sit inside watch cnn day. New guidelines*: whatever time end school one day start next is.

*not really I'm sure hospital works strict self quarentine policy place test come back earlier. That's hospital many others across city doing. It’s territory it’s state. Nah, I'm financially well enough already want something care about. TBF state Florida mask mandate. Nothing lol comment rather ignorant take account large portion US nationals come immigrants even around colonial era. issue education system. said wat! can't anything else!  may sound really bad, can't name one friend family member would want spend quarantine time with. trust anyone paranoid me. dog good company. definitely ex's!!!  could recommend good chiropractor ceinge neck  Straw man argument. 

Nope. argument **specifically countries gotten virus control.** countries not.

At 68,000 cases per day? have. not. 1,100, depending size country someone may based on

**A) cases increasing decreasing?** France generally decreasing. Maybe they'll still lose. countryu 66 million people 1/9th cases California less people. 

**B) deaths increasing decreasing** case Japan zero France near zero. 

Finally

**C) countries conquered virus** poke constantly point ""France"" related argument **is** strawman. 

I said countries. said decreasing cases decreasing deaths tending toward 0.

Trying constantly stick ""but France 1,100"". strawman argument - one make. Don’t take stock Sunday numbers - hell don’t take stock numbers. It’s pointless like implies second wave. Also, could gotten behind science mocked democrats it, made democrats look like they're following lead, would amazing New Years sucks city full people live here. Every bar charges huge cover drink Uber taxi cost shit ton.

New York amazing everyone visit. new years stay mid town. Stay Soho village even Brooklyn. go tourist shit like statue liberty (take Staten island ferry, free get 95% view pay 80 bucks tour) empire state building (pro tip that: find rooftop bar see empire state building view too) actually spend time there.

It hurts soul people go visit NYC walk around 3 blocks near times Square. Go adventure! would vote it. They’re themselves, it’s conspiracy. Florida, got called it. numbers show resurgence Memorial Day, Fourth July. 

Many areas without significant protest activity surging like crazy. still flu them. Numbers inflated. Everyone blindly following orders. answers... usually YouTube conspiracy videos. Correct. fixed thx. Good masks certianly . Homemade ones not.

My P100 use goggles.

PAPR proper filter even better longer wearing, cost 700 2500.  VERSAFLO CDC

PAPRs use HEPA filters (high-efficiency particulate air filters), efficient P-100 filters protect SARS. PAPRs provide higher level protection disposable respirators. Health care facilities SARS-affected areas used higher levels respiratory protection, including PAPRs, persons present aerosol-generating medical procedures bronchoscopy SARS patients. They’re bad ways. I’m close uninstalling Reddit too.   time get light case ""confirms"" big deal failed meet deadline, chose ignore it. city in, (in Canada) 100% masks anywhere inside public building. six foot social distancing. think flu. theory problem reasonably verify counterfeit? Flying first time ever next week, needed hear Recovered also relative term, many lasting physical/mental damage. I've saying allowed police become militarized time since much force employs former military trained people. promotes ""the warrior mindset"" meant civilians.

My opinion is, trained kill, swat, common cop.

I also think poor treatment veterans, deserve mistreated look trouble civilian life. clear hard job, anyone served deserve deal worst society (criminals, drug addicts, homeless vets, insane, ect.)

We know overhaul institutions, there's many chiefs enough Indians. clear need changes, system actively suppresses change even century time. pricks still let get first place screwed us over. 

And yet blame US manufacturing serious? live NYC know people got tested work test came back positive, even know sick, also know someone pass anyone, even though lives two people say south Fuck act . Hope kids people around ok sucks is, many people refusing follow guidelines wear masks, they're essentially responsible death nation. Trump leader said cause. Imagine schools, remote learning..  put number sign number one. literally code increasing font. 3. Moderna stock like turtles. numbers shows resurgence protests. anti maskers true conspiracy theorists. they've done great job convincing everybody conspiracy theorists right they're fucking stupid loud.

You can't worship president true conspiracy theorist. Well they're regretting lol It’s going interesting week week mask mandate people’s strong opinions work. people want national shutdown, even states well virus. Well done, even close headline. Actually even planet. worst part there's still going people think worse flu. Since mask mandate growth slowed overall we've cases kent county per day month ago. per mi.gov website post shared 3 weeks ago showed us 100 cases day first time since end May. Well don’t. luxury schools AC? think it.

 Old Yeller? NARRATIVE... stupid press thing ;) Hmm...since symptoms COVID-19 lesser wear masks opposed don’t, wearing mask functions cheap effective public health treatment.

\#Masks4All Yes mask wearing helps immediately super simple do! great hear.. southern hemisphere.

I'm sure Americans abide wearing masks social distancing...... eventually. much longer 14 days. July 6th still updating. would brain damaged see dashboard. recall seeing articles anything.

I see several people thread talking experiences (nurses, one partner nurse, work part hospital) saying numbers hospital still-births (and miscarriages?) Seemed 3-4x normal.

To relate us, however, pessimistic calculations I've seen ""actual"" deaths China 50,000 deaths (officially 4,500-5,000), official us death count 150,000. us could possibly still leading china big margin. pretty obvious countries transparent though.  whole set rules quarantined person/people needs sleeping, kitchen, &amp; bathroom space, I'm assuming that's meant cases roommate family member travels. However, know earth they'd enforce that. larger number people,you also larger number people get sick. That's tally percentages rather numbers comparing countries. America roughly 5 6 times many people UK. means 5 6 times many people canbe infected. simplistic example, easier 10 powwow get sick country 100 people flighty 10 people.that said,it's childish example almost useless. 

In case coronavirus,the difference would take 2 weeks make up. would take longer foran exponentially growing disease infect larger population. car coronavirus us vs UK, (rounding up) 6 times many people UK, would take less 3 doubling times ever UK,a numbers. Corona doubles (ladt time checked,during early days) every 5 days. means less 2 weeks us would catch UK. song ""we'll we're smaller different"" laughable. Again,the larger population,the people get infected.

I believe intention keep discussion facts events that's lot people for. plenty subs cater people's desire bash favourite undesireables.

There legit reasons forums impose restrictions scope discussions. case politics sub, discussions would undoubtedly cause entire topics derail people various political leanings start fighting politics (consider like families forbid political discussions extended family members). 

Many people civil informed enough lead fruitful conversations topics politically-motivated groups past actively brigaded subs push views attempt fan hostility.

You ask ""hey, freedom speech?"". case, freedom speech anti-mask, anti-vax, anti-5G? sub open discourse then?

In case, think sub pretty accepting negative facts countries political parties long discussion facts rather entities. really want bash China, there's always China_Flu /r/worldnews. want bash GOP, there's /r/politics.

Privacy issues, suppose, sick something people doubted, I'd sign release something people could see video going through. plenty patients would agree that. sure Poland. Kraków's got places like over. Pretty sure asshole ramming cart, okay. course views China. Theres absolutely way case data accurate. province? I'd like look mind sharing. That's sub shit, ever mods great idea giving bot list words auto remove comments like P0litics needs removed, virus nature response P0litcal.  winning fight many losing.

Australia hit double figures deaths/day first time ever. number deaths per million population 6, compared UK's 674.

If Europe government would fucking worshipped. Always enjoyed comprehensive FP FA articles written. Yes article said common sense, hope countries take heed it. want comment FUCK YEAH!!!! Frustrated freedoms restricted something trivial like containing deadly pandemic, man retrieved one assault rifles car opens fire.

The people inside outraged right congregate bars deadly pandemic challenged, subsequently drew guns carrying exercising freedoms returned fire.

Officially American thing ever read.  Public info professional, available simple google search name. gravity situation sad joined frontline became official RN help need. COVID happened quickly within year. I'm immunocompromised. part stay fuck inside. really left since March 12th.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm moving couple states away months. plan double mask (kn95 + cloth top), swim goggles, face shield, gloves get apartment car. I'm car, dispose gloves, take face shield. alcohol along swim goggles proceed drive. Put back gas pump pay pump.

repeat get new place.

&amp;#x200B;

We're movers move stuff. show (we're leaving movers come pickup). put ppe I'll move one bedrooms seal unload living room. they're gone, open windows (with ppe still on), come unpack boxes, sterilize furniture. aired half hour, take ppe. Yeah watched something this, America bad response pandemics historically. “Don’t like reflection? Blame mirror.”   eeek

It's ""eke"" 😂 OP wrong It’s education unfortunately. Since many people grew poverty whole lives don’t palate many foods unless highly processed. 

I volunteered teaching cooking classes low income families years mom rural Canada. people wouldn’t eat kind beans unless hidden chili, forget cooking dried beans kind. wouldn’t eat kind greens vegetables weren’t potatoes carrots. even hard get eat kind meat ground beef. constant struggle eat anything carbs cheese products. best uphill battle. It’s reality people introduced variety foods young age. That's Congress like Crazy Manipulated.

I expect see 0 American infections October, like magic, Trump dancing victory lap people dying left right election. electorate media swallow up. think Trump sees Covid 19 mother voting suppression schemes combined mother cash heist.

As long people take election security granted, election lose. happen link study? I've assumed along, seen science back hunch up. I'd like send study dean (lots faculty college requesting barriers / shields alone way circumvent social distancing mask requirements, insane me) far none articles I've seen actually provide link source. state US public education, would sad true. fucking awesome! Also late 90s pretty old. difference hit though.

NY hit hard fast, could done little mitigate that. Florida - could taken different position everything could wrong (re-open early, mask mandate, encouraging tourism, sacking data scientists)

As international observer, Florida hitting many cases tells far tragic story NY, 300k+ cases they've added since June entirely preventable. can't said NY. Probably million ... idiots say ""it's X deaths""

Also, never ""only X deaths"" parents die, spouse, friends family. American tourists 

So tourists? Puerto Ricans American citizens tribal. Republicans assholes. End of. Give little time. They’ll catch outbreak 1 state one city. Rest us next covid free. point, unfortunately, lockdown going solve problem. many people gotten sick worldwide, virus circulating population many years. best hope lockdown vaccine available administered 70%+ population. point turn something like flu get periodic outbreaks population doesn’t see significant impact. Fucking hell making feel old 28. Don’t spread misinformation please. get info “half cognitive problems”?? 

The etiology reported CNS damage well studied nothing concrete. know coronavirus (not specifically SARS Cov2) genomes found brain victims. yes, coronaviruses find way CNS humans. Encephalopathy symptom COVID-19, one paper n=1, 70s. 

There really isn’t much literate regards COVID19 neuropathology. don’t know enough yet, spew misinformation sake fear mongering really immature. keeping open mind however FUCK scary. seriously hell get half lol? 

Be safe, stay healthy. also find exactly virus came from. different. use military show help transport crucial medical supplies medical supplies mean bombs Well foolish week ago according government, see point view agree, medical advisors probably know more, advised risk low enough people able fly. I’m assuming joke don’t think lot morbidly obese people UK......and they’re referring mean this? Covid morbidly obese...... good combination. Report Yes, still time bring numbers winter. Winter causes two problems: 

The first one virus lasts longer cold air cold environments. makes virus contagious.

The second one winter Vitamin deficiency increases. makes virus deadly 

It's better ready low viral incidence. know fella who’s real it, he’s mentally ill fucken idiot wish article gave specifics onset illness. seem similar GB concerning virus many strange complications associated it. stumbled one today I'll refrain naming reasons point out. unironically comparing Covid safety policies Jewish oppression Nazi Germany. Although given Florida could reinfected bow Coronavirus Great comment. grinds gears see media blaming random citizens government policy. Especially paper owned billionaire think so? whataboutism make comparisons now? Comment deleted assuming referring Fauci's mask pulled baseball game. said pulled minute get drink water. yes, people he's around time is. sixth day triple-digit?

Uncle Sam like, hold beer, tests I'd hitting **six-digit** daily weeks. one things grow filopodia move around (like HIV, Ebola, dengue, metastatic cancers), allows present virions. could also allow attach, limpet-like, structures, e.g., endothelium. may make recalcitrant. Also, goes hide platelets, last quite normal circumstances.

As far testing positive, really depends test. it’s IgG serology, that’s long-term antibodies “works designed.” (Not everyone making antibodies, though, appear t-cell mediating without making antibodies. something.) Nelson Muntz: Haha! tough one. true, MTR vital lifeline city. Ding dings avd ferries far safer choice. many essential workers impossible. choice full lockdown city government seems keen avoid it. friend ""break up"" us today. partner died last month 44, suspected Covid-19 although confirmed.

She's mad offer condolences support in-person. small baby home I'm survivor right-sided heart failure influenza complications. politely explained going right told us ""relieved friend duty"" need live lives stop this.

It's irrational people are. miss anyone acts like put others potential jeopardy, especially someone who, people, know better.

I'm really sorry loss. money. That's why. believe meant say country  So, wrong continue using physical distancing? Given still know effectively nothing actual efficiency, even forerunners, would say so. isn't. 
Terrorists aim inspire terror ""targets"" political religious reasons "" planned"" acts. 


That guy raging uncontrolled lunatic. found something really interesting document WHO.

[INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES CERTIFICATION CLASSIFICATION (CODING) COVID-19 CAUSE reference section 4.2.3 volume 2 ICD-10, purpose mortality classification (coding) produce useful cause death statistics **whether sequence listed ‘rejected’ ‘accepted’ may reflect interests importance public health rather acceptable purely medical point view. Therefore, always apply instructions, whether considered medically correct countries correct assumed error, since changes national level lead data less comparable data countries, thus less useful analysis

So [section 4.2.3 Volume 2 section dealing evaluating reported sequence direct secondary cause Effect duration classification evaluating reported sequence direct antecedent causes, interval onset disease condition time death must considered.

So sequence coded way reflects ""interests public health"", rather ""is medically correct not"".

That's kind interesting. real problem. Darwin got bit slow harvest now. could go holiday wanted. think foolish so. carry guess   Damn took 2020s lunch money Something keep mind: addition deaths flu cause anyways.

It may lower year thanks social distancing, maybe many people risk already dead count deaths overall increase. True happening think life going back normal countries? 10 million good portion probably long term health issues due it. Ninja normal? I’ve never triage nurse ER send home overrun before... Lol yea, hilarious people think states improving. guess is:

Not reported dead
+ reported hospital
+ X amount time passed since positive result (e.g. 30 days?)

Then assume recovered

Some slip cracks, prob reasonable reliable. someone still sick 60 days last positive, there's probably decent chance either go back get tested go hospital die X d

.o e
Xpxi l.. That's bit really frustrates me, idiots say ""it's X deaths"", place that's tough lockdowns, closed borders etc. use lack deaths argue lockdown measures without apparently ever realizing relatively low deaths lockdown measures. conveniently ignore stastistics countries done well.

It's like 2 islands, island island B. populations equally infested crocodiles. Island policy allowing people get close water island B free all. Island deaths year crocodiles island B 1000s. Island conspirasists/idiots work stats agree deaths year crocodiles harmless laws getting close water government oppressing reason. Actually, going back rereading think reading right. think anything wrong that. nothing religion can't yourself. 

This really depends disposition, people can't live without spirituality. Thank providing resource. gave something peruse consider, plain nice. paper website's graphic based states IQ estimated National Assessment Educational Progress (NAEP) results tests administered public school students. Looking data, scale IQ differences states seem small enough warrant caution concluding IQ ordered state basis. would defer someone greater familiarity statistics, perhaps someone higher IQ, know caution warranted. ; ) This. don’t think cares Healthcare really universal. really did, he’d support Medicare all. can’t get universal healthcare public option. It’s impossible. think he’s kind dumb who? really stupid hill die on, bro. government care. governor hot trash started he's forcing quarantine matter what. mean controls introduced cases continue climb different countries define ""Recovered"" differently. showing symptoms x-days vs longer hospital vastly different. Excuse me, I'd like point US, death rate around 6% infected. 0.6% deaths compared whole nation's population. I'll go ahead point 149k people died disease less 6 months. Yikes. course Georgia tho. 81-95% still need isolated, right? community coming together... 

You mean sparsely populated area low density low tourism. 

Antarctica cases also. thinking safe Alaska must be. guess not. MERV industry rating filtering capabilities filters. higher MERV rating, smaller particles able capture higher capture rate. get past MERV 17 become true HEPA rated things like hospital surgery rooms towards MERV 20 become ULPA rated various clean rooms. difference something like MERV 15 HEMA 17 filter, even though capture particles 0.3micron HEPA grabs first pass filter, higher capture rate, whereas MERV might capture 75% particles. 

You right blower motors cannot handle extra drag. true HEPA filter systems, addition filter common return, supply register HEPA filter small booster fan. booster fans requires additional power. Found hard way engineering electrical systems clean room know needed power supply register. got hit huge change order. larger engineering fee project. like clockwork Well seeing Britain see enforced, plenty people ignore it. might recommend good honey tea squeeling. :) Varies country lot easier control outbreak literal island. depends live. live NYC matter many protests large outdoor parties bars streets get reported media past 2 months, cases continue decline. guess winter bad ever let run course, places safe many people already it. You’d shocked amount state plates mostly NY/NJ/MA. don’t get They’re group people decide hospital gives help sends home die. 

They overrun can’t help everyone. serious, hard. stopped eating meat 6 years ago seeing one many undercover videos factory farms.

I still eat wild-caught fish (farmed fish nasty, eat shit often), pastured eggs dairy. 

Meat substitutes come long way. eat lot Beyond Impossible products.

You either (no cold turkey, har har, I'll week). cut pork first pigs fucking bad 😭 cut beef too, finally poultry.

I still eat *really* well, so... done. :) find final motivator. Look analysis looking overall increase deaths - many deaths year vs average past 5 years adjusted population, etc. Usually termed excess mortality.

When analysis done region, deaths actually overall - Canada.

Anyone US?  way schools open stay open long. dozen schools massive outbreaks (and think many schools country) impression reading media correctly they’re safe. MLB enormous amount money behind it, schools don’t. Mass American Graves Again. actually imagine guilt, I've taken every possible precaution protect people around me. never want experience guilt, I'm behaving such.  Projection hypocrisy, usual.  Agree similar that, causes death. rona *SSSSSQQQQUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*

Omg, so. much. cryyynnggee.

Oh, poor poor soul, crying doily pillow. oh poor thing. nnn't-awww. Sunday _especially_ low though.  child tried say staying home. Cute. Like gave choice... kid going school. already breeding ground germs! covid, imagine. agree, areas, looks like lot people selffish. agree is, selfish DNA. totally control, CHOOSING ignorant lifestyle. 

I tell this, would need DNA change came Canada live. act like here. always odd people act way, society not. try considerate people smile face almost brings tear eye. That's strength right there. Something fucky going reporting US.

New treatment procedures account drastically lower death rates southern states reporting.

They're covering we're months election. pathetic. It’s baby’s fault born US? It’s young person’s fault living here? Even voted candidates tried reform healthcare? Interesting. business rent work space working home damaging mental health productivity. hate it. hated lived boyfriend's big ass house, hate single living alone tiny studio. Despite it. I'll returning office minute can. Well say grain grains. Same, frustrating see idiots proudly going out/traveling care world, others trying part keep everyone safe staying home. 

I'm sorry feel alone cannot see bf, hope thinks get better safe see again. mean time stay strong, thank part responsible staying safe. K. live liberal state people making political trying put negative spin positive news order never open up. want push back notion ""making political"" republican thing. not. governor flat lies. He's trying convince people surge young people getting sick, even though #s down, younger people higher percentage smaller # cases - celebrated used spin narrative we're dangerous situation employer goes loses job? Reddit fucking retarded. fair, numbers always lowest Sundays highest Fridays. Fewer people working weekends, fewer doctors signing death certificates, delay getting tests done, etc. That's easy, though. Judging sign looks like people didn’t want wear either. Dude people probably common cold flu people even know difference 2 dam bit good cover nose. Thank you. No. america bad. china soviet russia good Sustainable relationships built mutual core values experiences. 

something something, blood thicker milk. That's far many phases simple enough implement. Got take advantage 49$ direct flight trips. 🤣 *Palm Beach County paying $875,600 federal coronavirus aid use app, developer maintain 2024. Miami-Dade plans pay $775,000.* 

But people testing positive voluntarily download app enter they're positive. people also download app two phones 6-13 feet one another get notification go get tested within 2 weeks infected person's positive test. presumes everyone phone times know may contact, happened. Sorry, meant post California sub. I'm median age. T.T Thanks information. mildly reassuring know ICU'S area capacity. Mark Zuckerberg called VirusBook, maybe. school planning Phase 3 that, virtual. Phase 3-5, go everyday half days. Phase 6, completely reopen. Keep mind 7K kids, chaos caused. Yes. I'm getting pissed reading live NYC, everyone like ""we X great."" things here, covid still ran course. Honestly, masks social distancing probably work, disease would ended April reemerged June. Instead kept going late May fizzled out. many uncounted deaths US. It’s fault choosing it. CA shut things ELI5: imagine immune system fire department, fire infection. Wearing mask dampens amount “fire” get house. couple sparks enter house, fire department enough time quell inferno gets hand. Now, don’t mask, take open mouth sneeze back throat, that’s like firebombing house firemen hell tough time putting blaze. 

TL:DR wear mask, prevent fires.  already did...

Why taking stance facts must derive court rulings? There. COVID killed people year annual flu. ya’ll stop using fLu KiLlS pEoPlE ‘excuse’ now? Maybe people got crap scared got act together? hunch. treating mask wearers badly months end. NCAA passed ruling players make money image likeness That's state's alone yes agree flu deaths worldwide estimate feels bit bigger be. Nobody really kept track influenzas death rate covid cause ""normal"" thing. said think flu least caused deaths scale lower-mid estimation average worldwide. Consider fact many countries locked due covid would possibly less deaths normally would influenzas. Examples countries would many asain countries like Vietnam south Korea Japan. bad people, used consider friends, kinda hope someone love catches virus least gets really really ill maybe they’ll stop selfish assholes actually take seriously? also go home families games... least MLb NFL. guys awesome! wish awesome. Excellent points. pay treatment, treatment possibly infected due intentional ignorance recklessness. Also, God loves much would give highly infectious deadly virus? hope rethinks lifestyle beliefs he's suffering. PANIC!!!... PROTEST!!! That's works. provide proof guilt corruption. Speculation proof. making accusation corrupt. need counter accusation corruption proof corrupt. preponderance evidence falls you, me. Prove corrupt case influenced. Haha someone mentioned praying causes covid, mention screaming protest. America already drowning. need hurricane make drown more.   I'm going back home. one family going back home. cousins sure seeing bunch shithead American tourists though. Outdoors lower risk factor 19, see requesting Americans come. I'm sure mean Puerto Rican nationals Puerto Rican Americans. Regardless ancestry Americans go Puerto Rico right now. No, context key. I'll say fuck bastard front friends ask Nana weather gonna hot fuck Monday, moderate work, meetings etc. need moderation people words considered inappropriate. fair, many exact situations spanning last 5 years gun control advocates warned about. Many people shouldn’t firearms sort. even suprising reaction anymore. 

People become entitled feel completely justified kind thing. think asshole actually considered ramifications actions? People taking seriously all, especially people likely get spread it. slums packed Brazilian favelas low income people basically given up. typical ""I'm untouchable"" ""muh freedom"" idiots cities suburbs basically carbon copy American exceptionalist go party every weekend without masks care they're narcissistic children think virus bend will. 


We testing lot African country I'm sure, play part too, practical level mirror Brazil wrong ways. least president takes seriously trying best populace absolutely botched things every turn. go Cape Town Johannesburg Pretoria swear people even know virus all. Big groups, social distancing, everyone masks hanging around necks. poorest people even understand going forced military presence comply. one big fucking mess. 60% excess deaths God's sake. are, primarily actually aren’t communist regards economy. They’re actually capitalists led boom chinese billionaires. Nihil novi sub sole Latin nothing citizenry: Mass shootings gun crime literal direct cause poorly handled gun legislation moreover even somewhat easy access firearms. direct 1 1 result: people allow guns less qualifications likely people abuse them, even majority \[Which course becomes question open fire public, seen billion scenarios\]

ANY country could lax gun laws experience exactly US experiences. That's paranoia plays people's decisions buy guns naturally leads wanting fulfill Rambo moment, instance ownership gun makes hero justifies mass slaughter. ""Unique"" US real thing occur anywhere world flat given enough time lack attention.

EDIT: Immediately remembered couple pulled guns protestors month. two allowed guns *at all* nearby protestors felt **threaten GROUP PEOPLE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING** know sure dogshit acted *at all* fact owned guns. I'm still shocked one died two idiots. wish facility quarantine order place. work healthcare too. Amazing amount people going planes vacation.   Damn, get ad blocker phone. use adaway bromite web view rooted android :( hope that's ends up, definitely quarantined get shit together enough participate without causing pandemic breakouts wherever go. agree you. what's wrong Italy? mean aside rampaging corruption everywhere. corrupt inefficient government healthcare pretty good. stupid? fired upon bunch black conservative militiamen, fired upon bunch hoodrats returning fire. know auto correct /s either way I'm sad amused ??? 

&amp;#x200B;

How cut military funding invest research education long - Puerto Ricans - get reparations. China alright economically, totally wrong here? visited store EMPLOYEE lowered mask cough arm. People clueless. austrian here, disgusted aswell dude probably means term purchasing power. Surprise people get it. I'm hoping government assistance programs start conversations universal income. start understanding consider worth, start really look minimum wage jobs. available guns easier obtain less restrictions own, use, where, likely situations occur. Guns hard own, *period,* raise likelihood ""Wrong"" person owning guns also general forms crime turned likely nonlethal lethal. Guns serve immediate justification person end try kill you, die instead.

In blatant honesty US ""Special case"" terms lax gun regulations leading blatant gun violence. weapon manufacturing industry gets lot money marketing guns literally anyone paranoid anything, alongside culture guns anywhere rational fear mongering based location culture club.  lax gun laws Germany even substantially enough within country mile US' laws bet money year occurs mass shooting. literally matter time general citizenry owning guns general citizenry abusing right, leading fetishization states give weapons. inflammation caused bacterial viral infection, air sacs fill pus may become solid. Inflammation may affect lungs

SARS-CoV-2 virus causes covid-19.
Covid-19 disease. use look respiratory disease experts starting believe vascular disease causing small blood clots form entire body. blood clots clog blood vessels slowly choke organs causing failure. 

A combination blood clots inflammation cause complete organ failure. lungs one possible organs.  Well practice, private healthcare facilities might bad, regulated properly. Germany good example this. Seriously? What? Name one scenario Look ""eat less junior health minister Helen Whately"" Google, there're news sites posting this. points pm Yeah, well, that's just, like, opinion, man. There's going lot orphans/adoptions. worked 2 jobs before...to me, fast food eating actually expensive coming home baking potato cutting salad. However, take consideration health concious always gym person. kids would probably want chicken nuggets lol. Right live bf cooking stressful buy make us both. Thankfully eats make complaints. Can't imagine living picky eater kids (my picky eaters cats 😳...) know TON people guns keep house never done anything like this. Sadly, even occasional incident like makes agree you. without U.S True true. used get groceries wally world wegmans moved town addicted them. really believe overcounting deathtoll narrative pushed usual sources reality actual death number far higher. allow people brush whole thing conspiracy ultimately scandal certain states (Florida, Texas) suppressing actual death toll revealed. Statistically per capita they're like incarcerated America following countries:

~~None~~ them.

America tops list current incarcerations per 100,000. Land free imprisons percentage nation earth, even pesky authoritarian ones.

Why? well discussing for-profit healthcare system failing citizens, America for-profit prison system also disastrous citizens. Sounded crazy too, here's little napkin math. I've watched guys move $50 product 5 minutes seemed keep pace going rush. rush 3 hours day, another 5 hours day 1/3 pace... that's $2800/day. x365 would million dollars. 

Of course total estimates, actually seem realistic could gross half million, minus 30% COGS, minus 200k license, still 6 figures left paying themselves. pussball lmao. quick shoot something get way. fly would get medical n95's jug hand sanitizer. don’t let us in, people going right taking advantage bad situation. don’t want people there. Lock wouldn’t even blame guys it. Yeah, outliers. much die much children affected?

What 10 posts sub millions children really affected? Yep. makes bit wary grappling much gym. recently, numbers low right now, spent 5 minutes face face sick person would virus way deepest part lungs, cannot good thing versus small dose starting throat... Try reading past headline questions. evacuating tourists city. little fantasy bubble everything dandy serious jeopardy bursting, know deep down. they're keeping reality bay long possible.

When families get sick, beds left help them, die complications, reality kind. JFK rather suss though. know official explanation doubtful relies idea 'magic bullet.' Honestly shouldn’t allowed firearm legally history mental illness criminal activity exceeding something like public urination. I’m willing encroach peoples freedoms means protecting people’s lives feel you, also, look NBA doing. going responsibly, process providing American people much needed respite stressful times. Almost like reward staying home, watch live sports. administered 236 tests recent round testing bubble, 0 positives. seem think know government which, commendably cautious puts boat people saying masks work despite government highlighting do, end spectrum.

Did stop flying going SARS, MERS ? want people wearing masks around you, find effective cough sneeze lot near them, seem disperse without confrontation. miss things use to. play everquest II spent tons time leveling toons. lot people country (India) convinced Covid overblown without masks distancing. result: India number single day cases yesterday definitely bad idea, think number one thing class room ventilation... really hope possible open windows entire lessons. Yup, every time see another place we're welcome, I'm happy see someone making responsible decision world. Perhaps humanity survive all. Brilliant. Goes show effective efficient digitization automation tasks be.

In country (Pakistan) till mid-june thick pandemic, peaking +6k cases per day +150 deaths daily. provincial govt. policy sample testing among selected areas targeted lockdowns yielded surprisingly positive results.

Mid-June peaked daily case numbers + deaths descent 70% reported positive cases recovered. specific situation exactly gun control advocates warned decades.

Warned hilarious. **happened hundreds thousands times point.** many mass shootings literally even remotely similar bodycount, occurred all, without aid insanely lax gun laws.

THIS guy allowed gun, like many ability. I'm honestly shocked went back bar got another exchange gunfire nobody accidentally shot shot him, one biggest issues mass gun ownership public people actually aware enough target *is* also things like crossfire, confusion say first responders \[The black guy killed HOLDING mass shooter stopped\] etc.

It's literal nightmare scenario wrapped one. lot innocent people danger due ONE GUY access deadly weapon allowed near mile minor altercation COUNTRY would resulted injuries. Grab 40, let's get keyed It’s race guys true, mentality probably strengthened fact playing shortened season, game important would usually be. Cubs fan, almost feel like consider forfeiting least upcoming games Reds. One players, Anthony Rizzo, even mentioned seeing going team getting freaked out. forfeiting game might mean forfeiting whole season, probably won't. cut coronavirus reporting, overall, all-cause mortality. body counts don’t lie. put blame tiny hands Donald Trump ushering world face masks science politicized. Thanks, mother fucker. I’m gonna guess Tears Teacher here: already telling class parents directly, ""Do send kid school symptoms. convenient send home immediately day really disrupted."" wanted fill spots friends. ‘But it’s like flu’ option really. Hopefully, Governors issue “shoot sight” orders soon deputize mask wearers. fails, bounties carcasses, like used wolves vermin.  People need spread this. It’s important shedding light misinformation.

People comparing adjusted figures raw numbers. adjusted figures coronavirus undoubtedly million moment, won’t come light end year longer (when total higher). Damn, really hard Americans full stop. Y'know, one world's worst healthcare models.

No time bad time discuss importance universal health care basic human right, without incurring absolutely *extortionate* bills. RemindMe! 3 months Low IQ garbage that’s unfortunately lot here. deaths entirely preventable quarantine masks? way 650000 anyway. teach people say it’s flu read think variant strain virus. Wtf don’t want know. How?!! wife nurse; list states travels them, quarantine gets back 14 days - Unpaid. Almost certain Louisiana one them. aggression stand, man. also endlessly praise police military even even they're caught things claim want prevent Half us smart this. half, much. Exactly, besides never situation got heated could escalate. many still suffering long-term effects permanent damage? United States 2020, expect? get minor exposure COVID work wearing mask, go home. wife also get minor exposure none exposure all?  Bulls waking tomorrow morning:

The southern states also wanted 3/5th slave populations count towards number electors house representatives. would way less influence popular vote system slaves voting.

Thanks! too. Someone know positive test swore false positive. staying home, maybe. out, working, singing church, so.... doctor bill separately months later  Life going back normal countries took seriously.

We’ve got 140k people dead US- federal government still isn’t taking seriously. pandemic doesn’t go away. either take precautions slow spread... let millions die.

And one implied going wipe human race- could cause death millions upon millions people left unchecked. cause economy beyond crumble, millions become homeless starving... could lead war revolution.

That’s obviously extreme point, unlikely... nothing seems reach right now, functioning adults white house, never would happened. pregnant fully locked down. exhausted it.

UGH same! told pregnancy would hard, something tells even harder normal. way things going, quarantined everyone doctor parents January. real fun begin baby arrives September *still* paranoid comes see baby they're begging let in. retarded? absolutely term limits elected officials. terms limits provides many opportunities corrupt individual stay power. Trump's incessant behavior scapegoating groups people really shows true colors ignorance compliance followers.

Very similar Nazi Germany, terrifying. Boomers Good luck, sounds like dick dude side Reread post imagine you’re someone 1. feels bad remorseful mistakes cause others harm and/or 2. recognizes many people across country told kinds gatherings safe precautions taken (to say nothing legality/reopening) easily could’ve terrible luck versus high risk.

Regardless, you’re presumably talking horror 150K dead one sentence dismissing lives “morons” next. blame cautious building elevator, probably ought get more. plan sounds ok -- however really even need gloves, bring napkin something press buttons elevator, touch part napkin touched buttons, toss trash parking lot. can't tell serious anymore, I'm going act serious.

Sounds bit overkill, hurting anyone so, sure, go ahead. 

I've seen N95 face shielf setup Healthcare workers, specifically ones working getting someone set cpap sleep apnea, like literally working random people breathing machine that's going spreading shit. elevator ride, yeah gonna guess thats beyond.

I also want say something anti bathroom device... despise nasty public bathrooms, I'm going support there.

I know are, bad cases there, generally sounds like good mask sanitizing hands good way go. need feel safe, I'm going give shit. Though honestly think need mask car unless Ubering people around. Save wash it.  China hid data based national shame. US political impact Trumps election chances. US handles pandemic bearing skepticism origin virus China covered months. critic Trump China. Thank much. 

1. written statement vetted gov called press release, interview. Maybe many interviews done way China, countries free press.

2. one responsible getting bats remote caves city 11M people. there's pandemic caused virus bats. minimum, prime suspect. 

3. complaint US's revoking grant sounds entitled. No, owes world apology.

4. sbout lab built. there're many inexperienced people working lab process sloppy.

5. there's bat 100s miles within Wuhan bats hibernation, heck could outbreak happen? bats Wuhan lab.

6. deflecting. gain function research. Bats infect humans easily before. found key make bats infect humans much easily. published papers international conference. never explained studied that. 

BTW, one insisted RG h ed virus lab ""only 96%"" resembling coronavirus. independent scientists able check database see whether that's one resembling coronavirus confirm virus really 96% similar.

7. I'll trust US intel trust China. Plus, various European athletes told countries' press March/April got sick Wuhan Oct symptoms resembled COVID-19. TN too. Maybe southern thing. right, still would dealt stupidity WHO, CCP, Fox News, Churches, republican house senate, ignorance certain US citizens. tricky question. fitted mask better leaking around edges. surgical mask better filter Victoria, Australia, everyone went lockdown March May. Cases single digits, rose again. seems long still cases remaining, they'll eventually rise again. dont think dictatorships either  Nah agree happening protests disgusting  Sounds like great sociology study. diffusion fake news social networks via Facebook. article blows  Puerto Rico absolute trash pit, surprised people want even visit. Literally it’s like Detroit palm trees. 

All same, part U.S., can’t restrict travel to/from mainland. sarcastic putting vaccines, prefer prevent aging via lifestyle nutrition changes don’t think forced chemicals body. every North American obese globally cultural thing, sure, genetics plays role that’s centuries certain lifestyle (good bad), passed generations. wasn’t dumb luck begin with. US seems losing obesity/health battle per capita severety condition, it’s big issue countries like Canada. (I’m Canadian) shown cities good public transit system healthier populations least less (far less) obesity. seen anyone public transit (and elevators) obesity condition. Even entire life (many decades) seen 1-2 people city problem. plenty junk food available too. something “self-control”. 

Why put band-aid solution prevented educating young age? Sure take while, multiple generations, isn’t real solution slowing aging much humanly naturally possible? isn’t opinion, I’ve told. excuse hear get funding/money government died due COVID 19. 

I could kinda believe hospitals privately owned often overcharge shit people. yet see real evidence support think it’s bullshit.  say so. Welp know jim might good least create illusion that's meanwhile continue get richer richer. UK already one non-religious lowest death rate. guess God loves non-believers more. risk alright taking? boyfriend 33 high risk. want marry one day. ends ICU, ventilator, dying can't see him, hope feel collective guilt conscience everyone died y'all care yourselves. extrovert can't socialize physically options. FaceTime call friends phone? adapt forgive people life blatantly selfish love life one family members die. virus went Wuhan, around Asia, Europe Washington state. Europe mutated became nine times infectious. strain came New York. went New York rest country.

It’s entirely possible Wuhan numbers you’d think observing put office though? actually avoid fights three reasons.

1. training martial arts learned so.
2. fight someone means unnecessary interaction people waste time.
3. scoliosis i'm basically half cripple would loose dont fight child someone handicapped me. Oh man, would LOVE see Ronny boi face start freaking Trump drops him. blame game going intense. Georgia Gov common sense.... really hope holding breath one. Proof, shit known decades. Ugh selfishness astounding. Like I’m happy you’re enjoying COVID paradise. cancel trip Norway I’ve saving/planning for, two years. probably won’t able rebook anytime soon idiots going keep country closed forever. infected, 10 die fear lol ""but Obama built cages!!!""

Like ok. So? still wrong. put Covid patients nursing homes, instead Javits center. Oh since pisses much, personal anecdote. medical student moved giant city far away almost everyone know. Last week, 9 medical students decided meet social distanced picnic outside. Mind you, *this type meeting school explicitly encouraged us do.* want us get know spend every day next four years life working closely often relying them. Anyways, sat big circle spaced apart ate, put masks back right away. stood kind split pods 2 3 people conversations, spaced apart, masks on. 15 minutes later, woman passed us walking dog decided appropriate begin screaming us. told us carelessly flaunting guidelines (in city in, gatherings 50 people permitted, following mask ordinance). screamed 10 minutes saying ashamed ""how many people die young people stay home stop selfish."" proceeded TAKE PICTURES US WITHOUT CONSENT imagine could shame us sort social media. terrible experience, none us confronted her, nodded said understood clearly going calmed reasoning. 

Turns lady professor school going (not med school science department). emailed dean medical school freaking out. Apparently dean replied following safe practices school encouraged us safely spend time together socially distanced, masked walks picnics. grateful school backed us whole incident terrible me, especially since took long time decide whether wanted go picnic since I've mostly left house essentials since March. 

If woman gone 25 minute walk away downtown, would seen thousands people walking around, (who knows many tourists cities highly impacted COVID-19) many flaunting mask ordinance, eating outside supposedly ""socially distanced"" outdoor tables fancy restaurants. Yet decided small group people around time anyways, wearing masks outside, ones would let frustration happened young. Also study martial arts Kali instructor Philippines gang kid/teen knife fights. always says go knife fight assuming cut. also advises avoiding fights much possible. consolation, half accounts actually bots. mention race shooter know means. called positive thinking. *Laughs introvert* Covid little SARS That's point. unlikely get situations without knowing to, going know situations. self fulfilling proficy. dosent mean possible. 3 factors guarantee 98% chance staying poverty line: get atleast highschool diploma, kids 21 married, work full time. I've meant huge handfuls electricians union grew enough money eat days. college education, barely made highschool. Lucky enough landed union families, even real estate. say possible blame entirely system isnt correct. saying fair means. stating facts. Well yeah. recent photos smiling happily holding nursing certificate. every rich person starts rich though get you’re saying  Yeah right, like provide free healthcare everyone US. feel like needs get talked big takeaway watching news still better watching fox news..lol. Anyone like living among entire tent cities drugged out, disease-ridden hobos? warned...then could prevented. Fair enough. 63 cases 5 deaths near 10% death rate, even higher death rates recorded across region (HK 17%, Taiwan 21%, Singapore 14%).

It's *bad* per se, intense consciousness everything possible let spread overwhelming. COVID struck, region sees potential SARS round two rather ""just flu"", helped response immensely.

Even milder COVID, still might something Vietnam capable coping spread uncontrollably. Assuming you’re American, time Vietnam allow us visit entire world recovered Covid. last country recover. gotta vote someone actually gives damn. person Sanders, happen. Maybe another 4 years. Almost 22 year olds die this. Also would say need get sub. Reddit, Twitter, Facebook designed give anxiety. sub particular nothing fear anxiety. difficult addiction break put phone entire day go hike somewhere nature. think amazed much positive outlook next day. Virgin TIL anyone understanding someone would want save themselves/ put risky position soul American 

/s moment, want us.

However, couple years things different. Vietnamese universities going start attracting foreign students numbers.

Did know recently 5% US higher education students foreign students? know general pay expensive tuition rates local students? Foreign students great US economy.

COVID-19 Trump's xenophobia going change that. US universities going ""do less."" Vietnamese universities opportunity ""do more."" done NBA won't. religion inviolable. look little boys past years...🙇🏻‍♂️ We’re kind seeing problem everywhere — matter restrictions government enacts, people see double standards contradictions. However, often used argument relaxing restrictions, tightening them. Amen brother. certainly hope we'll get effective vaccines ASAP make COVID-19 history, despite that, long handle it, hell yeah I'm going continue wearing masks planes. Looking back, can't believe I'd congregating hundreds people packed spaces (clubs, concert halls, public transportation) decades, without even thinking it! dont make laws i'm poor sod follows them. going assume satisfying watch

It not. Incident filming began.   Disillusionment? Bruh y’all need catch up. I’m way ahead Nihilistic phase. asshole. ""The best data""...I'm surprised Trump standing right next him, whispering ear say next wrong. sign oppression wont obey rules get ticket/fine 'bad' person. tool psychological social inprison others fear comply new measurements. Solidarty based must. based free will. 

Only 0,02 % dies covid covid. people 70 medical issues like obese higher risk. would flu. reason less people die flu season last months. already died covid.

Stop smoking drinking, living healthier, sport less stress would much effect wearing mask increase chance surviving Covid.

I heard politician medical specialist push solutions. wear mask get vaccin. confirms political virus instead medical issue. 

""Comply new normal risk others. make take vaccin take away privileges.""

In country taxrate healthy foods increased, investments hospitals decreased years even new investments. doens't add up. 

Conclusion: measurements health others. They're comply new normal. world change much next 5 years based fear odds favor. I’m disputing horrible job. acted late. DeSantis done less done essentially nothing Kemp actively trying make situation worse suing Keisha Lance Bottoms, mayor capital prominent city, Atlanta, issuing mask order. paid government get access. access much money access much money do. Every country saw China locked Wuhan. believed things bad despite lockdown, taken virus even seriously? Like Russia would called US moon landings fake? called whistleblower better info CIA? technically correct.

I also attack random people minor inconveniencys. 

And im pretty streesfree too. uhm. jail life. lol clearly secret raging public menace threat explains COVID dangerous due infectious is, dangerous body catch compared flu. think 1 percenters escaping hell hole call US? see many people US asking Thailand Elite Visas Thailand forums. 15k usd, something middle class easily afford savings. 

Now many people work home you’d either serious responsibilities home repeatedly kicked head donkey willing stay US options. take RV Ft Meyers area every winter canceling plans 2021 season. gonna safe enough Florida correct thing. know difficult realize matters, think much worse everything would responsible among us continue isolate face lack leadership. Everything's bigger Texas.

Even Death Count. alwaya question civilian NEEDS firearms. average citizen need access AR-15 !remind me: three weeks Studies Show? knew casually browsing reddit morning since 2 months ago sounds like norovirus. opinion one guns. Can't wait someone guns something make sure guns.... respect opinion want argue... tough subject. do. 'talk' couple Internet. Holocaust deniers, anti-vaxxers... around nutjobs. Unsurprisingly, since dumb reject evidence massive, underestimated covid death toll. disease different. modern flu rolling around global human population hundred years. immune system trained deal moment born. Coronavirus essentially brand new. simply know enough make judgments risk way flu.

This key difference risk, something calculate, uncertainty, estimate much risk calculations might incorrect by. uncertainty disease right HUGE. trusting risk estimates right simply foolish. dont know widely used, case accepted (86%) according (3 weeks old) article. think that's British people visit Spain, really much grasp reality.

Brits account ~20% Spain's tourism. Never late get shape. direct. Facebook needs go thought ""middle ground"" illegal. Troll alt-right? Hard tell days. don’t feel bad guy think needs done. Covid19 leave body damaged rest life doesn’t kill you. way beyond point allowing people continue spread fucking disease. know it’s killing randomly healthy people, children. treat fucking antimask people like bioterrorists. shareholder profits tho 👀 website even says medicare all, need search video YouTube.

The website goes clarify adding onto affordable healthcare act. Similar Pete's pitch medicare want Who's firing back Portland? American gun ownership absolute LARP. natural - majority people want help close first. Wait.. carry firearm bars Texas? place like like Buffalo Wild Wings less like regular bar? Restrictions tighten... bet don’t March streets assault weapons demanding given freedumbs back. Well said US states. one Youtube Conten Creator called ""Backyard Ballistics"" something like that, explains Italian Gun Laws. Acting Government can't nice things? gun? thing specifically created kill things? I've never understood. least Alabama mandatory masks two weeks ago 7 day average cases seems going last week. Hopefully that's trend continue. confusing Victorian also--screw it. care. Enjoy feeling superior. 

I wish best. begins. dat water'll put shock  tell government really doesn’t want wearing mask interferes face recognition tracking We're talking specific toxic subreddit, conservatives general. That's started... Oh, let hook easily. acted like complete DeSantis-level fucking asshole reopening. time tried go back way late, evidenced situation Texas right now.

DeSantis, Abbott, Kemp, Ducey, whatever grampa dickwad Arkansas's name - none pieces garbage deserve consideration all. caused thousands unnecessary deaths valued politics human lives. Nice! Italy ""Oxford vaccine"" always referred Oxford-Pomezia (the chemical company located near Rome), absolutely legit! 🎉 Wow, Grandmas Boy reference? Man need equip essential workers pepper spray, high-class ones really sting anti-maskers People would still need able defend crime. Look rooftop Koreans LA Riots. lot rioters used bricks, bottles, etc. korean store owners armed , would completely lost livelyhoods.

Can't believe people vote ability defend ones self. wife physically strong person bigger guy broke knife (have domestic abuser lives unit us could power her), would screwed without gun. 

Guns need regulated background checks done complete bans. banned, police 100% liable failure protect taking power away people so. ACT tests cause C-19!? guess don’t know complications happening people aren’t deaths door.... ever 25 requiring inhaler make workout? Or, stroke 30.

Yeah, virus that. June last month?. Oh wait. mean.... NEXT JUNE? 😫 Exactly. incubation period same, normal flu would kill waaaay people. article month old, WTF people thinking?!?!  mean many antivaxxers antimaskers America may never go away really bad? official number antivaxers country?  Oh gives shit r/snowflake think. Sustainable forest management actually one things US good at.

Forest sizes stable 100 years pandemic scale type literally never happened.

except times pandemics scale (and larger) happened... felt way California. Cases per capita really give much information, already shown: Louisiana one highest tests per capita. Rate positive tests better measure, give 'bad' publicity increasing testing.

Deaths per capita also accurate measure hard place hit already available charts, relies accurate reporting cause death. Even better measure would measure total deaths compare previous years.

Video goes depth several days test results removes important reason testing, prevent spread individual - people get information they've contact someone infected 2 weeks back order quarantine. give hint general measures needs made.

There could better follow prevent spread someone tests positive. hate shithole country much. New York hit 5k deaths April 7th. hit 10k deaths April 13th 15k April 22nd.

TX deaths per day currently lower NY April 7th, let's hope see similar growth. Lol people act like quarantine worst thing ever happen It’s uber rich running save harbors. Quite middle upper middle class people, able work home, seem show interest leaving countries like Thailand. I’ve seen topic pop quite frequently recently Thailand groups. 

(Read you’re interested costs)

Our news reported quite surge Thailand Elite visas sold (if trust reporting don’t know lol). actually wouldn’t surprise though. 

I mean, haven’t community cases long time, thailand elite visa costs ca 15k US (cheaper families) anyone coming 14 day quarantine monitored hotels. expensive I’d happy spend 14 days allowed leave “room” (full villas pool etc). 

While it’s expensive, it’s uber rich expensive. made short calculation 4 person family see would cost. 


Thailand Elite Visa x4: aprox 1.7m THB 54k usd
Flights: 5k usd
14 day Quarantine medium hotel: 8k usd

Total: around 75k usd including misc stuff. 

You don’t uber rich able that, especially aren’t family 4 thus reduce cost lot. single person cost would go roughly 20k someone middle class easily saved up. poll would line American climate change deniers. big awakening Nothing. paid attention previous 19 wars US waged saw went

That's February May ~4000 deaths due pneumonia 20 year average time period Texas. 20-year average pneumonia time Texas 1200, Texas recorded almost 5200 deaths. NONE counted COVID-19. 

Texas severely under-reporting death toll virus. Totally agree. That’s we’re waiting. Also think might issues travel insurance get sick country puts travel restrictions. think knew bad humanity be, we're seeing raw data now...every day. Yeah, seems lot people expect magic pill eradicate virus tracks soon vaccine approved. concern get vaccine, get people vaccinated, people relax lot, thinking safe, rears ugly head people keep mask wearing, social distancing, hygiene full herd immunity achieved. Nobody give thoughtful answer. They're happy following authority. Death faith. Hopefully someone study death rate religion done. America pretty good forest management actually. Forests stable roughly size century Elizabeth read this. might used fire extinguisher earlier. shadow edit, you’re liar argues bad faith thus arguments zero credibility, fucked, truther Yeah absolutely cycle. One best ways combat actually free school lunch programs. helps combat food scarcity families, helps ensure kids nutrition need education helps introduce kids variety foods! football way contact sport association football. It’s harder keep players away other, period. 

Completely irrelevant testing isolating done right. soccer team comprised incredibly fit athletes cardio length match. Football variety player types, wide receivers/defensive backs/running backs (lighter leaner, capable running field) way linemen (big, stout gentlemen fuck men up, weight ranges high 200s low 300s).

Irrelevant testing isolating done right. players, it’s also coaches would need tested isolated. good number coaches older, physical shape, both

Just like football Europe. top comment lol! Depends employer. also scenarios person could previously hit pocket max year. I'm saying ideal really understand point article is. isn’t people can’t grasp it. 

It’s selfish people decided since mask doesn’t protect them, shouldn’t wear one. 

Noticing that, media government put questionable stories studies last week saying opposite. 

Now, idea mask keeps safe limits severity virus you. virus get you. Freedom will! friendly reminder lot people things never ""got back normal"" 2008 crash. know lot people whose lives forever changed crisis hit. lot jobs never came back lot people became permanently homeless.

Every crash upward re-circulation wealth. crashes get worse worse billionaires get wealthier time. disproved yourself. look total hospitalised daily deaths  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Far expensive? No, transportation costs much delivery, cases. 55 cents per mile real cost drive car. true another issue money childcare. See schoolyear parent getting ""sweet"" deal. kid gets go school receive education, parent gets work havd worry fronting bill childcare. 

The summer months struggling parents ""leanest"" ones spouse stays home kids summer, kids old enough leave alone. see lot church run ""Bible Camps"" ""Summer Camps"" offered free. places drop child day go work nominal fee, perhaps even free church member. 

However, EVERYONE kids needs childcare indefinitely can't lump kids together pre-pubescent herd roving viral vectors, presented really shitty problem country super ill-equipped deal with. Hey, I've waiting chance say this:

Fuck you, Ron. Thank beautiful gem. USA 80 million tourist destinations, France 89 Spain 83. 

Also, going ignore mass rioting that’s pumping infection rates?

No, reporting same. China - shining beacon perfect reporting. Right?

No, media trying fear monger make look like US administration absolute train wreck even though it’s honestly bad.

BLM movements caused greatest increase cases.

I concede uneducated idiots south don’t wear masks also blame. don’t believe virus.

But can’t blame administration. supposed do? Halt everything 6-7 months? They’re trying best safely resume economy practicing safety. guns illegal would need it. guy able shoot patrons needed shoot back. people think ridiculous guns commonplace America. begging trouble. fucking live Beijing. I've lived since born. 35 years.
In front house one 19 largest tertiary hospitals Beijing, China-Japan Friendship Hospital.
People want die, lot sick people people run hospital door help? Everyone desire live.

It's pointless waste time you. calling brain dumbed? crew needed? they're going fans they're going broadcast games TV either? think that's gonna work well them.

A TV crew sure, TV. there's fans games across Europe. That's got sports back. second part, many employees jobs close contact other, even many non player staff. game trainer may required close contact dozen players dealing cramps, injuries, etc. job could done distance probably field first place.

They're also part test isolate. Every single member clubs tested us get football back. Like said, doable. sure downvoted, absolutely right. absolutely crazy different parts country function. make certain threshold access state's public health system (Mass Health, aka Romney Care). Goodness knows saved bum twice. want free open internet want tech CEO's policing online forums. 

Truthful information coronavirus clamped social media February. bad idea 1 million fringe idea could right. 

Some be. Joe rogan would thrilled . preaches one government official telling everyone getting shape healthier boost immune systems . Never though Boris would first big name say FWD based true story. zombie outbreak 2012. zombidiot? fucking fuck wrong you? know ventilation spread thing, wonder people hotel quarantined.  wonder catching asymptomatics given get tested feel ill.

Or testing en masse everyone geographic area? tank driver go home, get mail mailbox, children sends school, house neighborhood

You're completely misunderstanding asymmetrical warfare insurgency work

You shoot tank AR

You shoot imperialist's family members. kidnap children. plant nail bomb Amazon package leave door

That war works 21st century Basically means best fight one end in. words stay fights much possible. friend works hospital keep telling seems lot pneumonia cases sudden that’s weird gets mad. Strong +1000 Exactly: came say it, much better 👍 thinking moving Dallas. Fuck.  Lol, 8 percent. people sub hilarious. know CDC puts .36? Perhaps bit low, might like .4, that's still 1/20th number. Oooohhh Australian state Victoria Victorians. Victorian era Victorians. Since Queen Victoria already died couple decades Spanish Flu. ""**Masks required** revival, according AL.com, Ross said went knew risks attending coronavirus crisis.""

I flood information... want admit wasting time.

Do want not? dread moment one eventually dies ahead another this. 

now bad day. sure! I’d contacting local homeschooling groups find one suits family best, join up, notify school district, get touch home school legal Defense association see they’re fighting join well. comparing annual total Corona racked 7 months (worldwide).  Sorry, neighbors going keep voting correct letter next name. 

No qualifications matter. thinking well. Though suppose \*\*attempted\*\* counter-argument justify scenario legally happen first place.

I think also like (I really can't think better word think accurate) fetishized ""good guy gun"" hero lot gun owners seem delusions grandeur about. That’s negative, Ghost Rider Obviously thinking, ""they'll leave ambulance go in!"" clue. Cases down, maybe best indicator. Hospitalizations also down, roughly right amount time expect see changes start impact (~3-4 weeks). Pretty good indicator. things really turning around, ought see deaths start trending sometime early August, would roughly expected timeline well. point it'll pretty clear what's going on. maybe one clue. fuck goes fucking idiot’s mind shit like happens? stupid.

Almost mobile phone cards China prepaid cards, blockade, many corporate personal cards ran prepaid (because temporarily useless, I'm blocked home wifi times, keep paying internet card?).

I know Americans think person phone card buy silly X package phone carrier, China phone numbers phones bought separately many people buy cards 2 carriers due different rates

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stupid. I'm answering question seriously, believe otherwise.

You want live dream mainstream Western media created you, fine. There’s obese there’s morbidly obese. Many people meet definition idea obese. Lots obese-like-their-PM obese folks UK. Nowhere near percentage morbidly-obese 😣 less half time. measures place beyond anything we’ve ever done flu. 

If allowed run course we’d looking order magnitude deaths now. Problem exists many come true later.

Pearl harbor, turns freedom information hints US government Tonkin, well aware never happened, mk ultra, sheer amount cover-up suggests find years come. even watch loose change, 

Fuck yes mistrust government, try avoid conspiracy theories myself, gotta tell ya, there.

Just follow r/coronivirus ffs, two days ago article antibodies lasting past 1-3 months, yesterday medical claim several colleges Bio giants find antibodies may protect top 3 years. 🥴
Shit makes head hurt.

So wanna confront conspiracy theories, remember buying official story, means putting trust government caught giving syphilis innocent would quicker ask blindly trust official story, question authority.

Masks bad, good, risky, mandatory. Virus bad ""WHO/CDC"" bad. 

Bottom line humans pick choose news wanna hear, ok fronts, tell this, trusted government since left military.

You empower conspiracy theorists arguing them, come sheep official story, narrow minded. research pretty fucking well read.

I personally love hearing ""yep 12 guys cave Afghanistan perpetrated 9/11"" somehow Iraq Saddam Hussein, omg Saudi Arabia. 🙄

Edit: feel free use ""it's science"" argument, would probably get whole lot headway if.

""Science muddled politics"" Easy solution you

Have considered \*not\* shooting sports bar?

I every single day life. actually quite simple drama-free. Highly recommend  shooter story probably responsible gun owner whole life though.... right point wasn't. Here’s link excellent advice: stop using Facebook. family die hard Trump/Anti-Mask Karen’s even 1 person calls 70 comments army racist friends coming one person commented something like “well keep everyone safe” Less less every day... paralization complications covid. truly scrary. ont sure same, GBS it. ""literally"" = allow exaggerate. 30 sort minimal number important stuffs cant delay carry like funeral school avoid shut (a class split 2 case go 30). would still likely get visit police gathering less 30 stupid stuff like parties such. Good things allowed happen, get hopes up. Nice job, 50/50 chance getting right. :) Perhaps right word stagnant ""manipulated"". remember ""pro-life"" Lt. Gov Dan Patrick's heartfelt honest statement ever: ""there important things (you loved ones) living."" would still say - propoganda normal flu. Let break ignorant people. 

Fact 1: people conspire achieve things.

Fact 2: people including authorities bad things.

Fact 3: authorities hold back lot information.

Fact 4: people often feel need act beliefs.

Fact 5: authorities act beliefs.

Fact 6: humans extreme beliefs based fear, prejudice, greed, power on.

The word theory means conjecture necessarily right all.

A conspiracy theory like Russia meddling Western affairs one pretty much believe lot substantial information support it. dismissed.

Obviously conspiracy theories born hateful bigotry kinds fear. theories outlandish.

Conspiracies happen though nonsense put notion conspiracy drawer inclusive everything supported evidence world fantasy. Honestly, wouldn’t return. Check homeschooling, distance-learning, options available. Begun, Stupid Wars Trump urged people tell doctors tell stallions. Read better. defending Trump definitely say Trump's fault. agree apparently terrible reading comprehension. Good trying win? Darwin award? can’t believe actually spent time watching gigantic piece shit (FtWD) instead literally anything else. Nice subject change hot seat. basic math; guys hurting. know, perfect here, sure shit want China right now. Idiots find echo chamber somewhere. gotta risk get brisket   🤣 Foreigners took China's data face value things got worse due inadequate response. need imagine deaths many Chinese feel better counties. know fox news garbage reading article non political cited real peer reviewed studies. basically quotes compilations studies. fine article. Sure, Eating less something necessary fibers, protein carbohydrates needed daily routine make people better. witches racist, saying? curious News Source = None folks. truly ""None"" even know Covid existed, much less conspiracy theory Glad hear company fire technically right think makes statement wrong. Perhaps intention statement make distinction value claim. again, totally right considering statement citizenship perspective think necessitates PRs able differentiate Americans. kind routine hold too? Could related? surprising all. many people pandemic endend reopening bars, restaurants, etc. end country-wide lockdown. 

People stopped wearing mask many places, months, right became mandatory, (and indoor).

I'm currently touristic French region work, I'm one ones streets wear damn mask. Tourists coming every countries continent (something can't understand) wear masks either. happening everywhere Europe situation get worse fast.

We advised stay France going vacation, avoid potentially spreading covid-19 even further, hope we're (but highly doubt it), wish everyone wastrying limit trips region, least situation gets better... Ireland Ha! Big Willy warned us long back:

""Now, now, now, upon time west
Mad man lost damn mind west
Loveless, givin dime, nothin' less
Now must put behind test (can feel me)
Then shadows, saddle, ready battle
Bring boys in, come poison..."" care past care virus welfare others, either. say anything China honest accurate. I'd say doubt faked numbers. point is: they're gonna corrupt, least they're good it. USA fucking embarrassment, led orange mutant/toddler hybrid White House, supported pieces garbage like Ron DeSantis. Trump trying best corrupt dictator, can't even pull off. government seize confiscate PPE shipments ordered states vote him, states covid less control cronies states exploding, directly fell line rhetoric. spends months mocking virus masks Democratic hoax, he's ""too focused"" covid throw first pitch Yankees game, always wearing mask now. 

We got hit hard March April, southern states benefit seeing happen, got control. completely ignored it. virus may started China, ""torch"" passed. USA biggest shitshow world right now, terms handling pandemic. also depends location. NY/NJ approved outdoor gatherings things start reopen WAY more. excess death statistics suggest least double. Okay, thanks! Different people. everyone follows around reads conversations people, say people. course welcome can’t complain responses comments different people. analogy compromise steps - would mean always wearing mask socializing outdoors? even admitted arresting doctors first discovered virus back December. people forget.... Meh going keep recycling comments? Maybe try scrolling past comments idea again. :/  way players staff involved American football team compared soccer. 
 
Is there? European Football teams 30ish players plus 20ish staff around them. per team thats 50ish people.  
 
I dont follow American Football, dont think numbers would different? getting 100 people? Lies solution Universal basic income people aren’t forced work recklessly would good start. I've seen thing, sure downvotes? 

Takes longer virus reach hard-core infection immune system time learn antigens respond virus get less severe illness (IN CASES) Ya. Right? Unfo forgot Sun Belt got spike. months judging masks without spike happening, needed able say “I told so”. Tell Chiquita Banana growers. I’m immune compromised well moved. good plan there. watch cross contamination gloves. Using hand sanitizer washing hands often possible better gloves, use sanitizer gloves disinfect them.

The US largest tourist destination world lmao, France Spain reporting deaths anyway flu, pneumonia, common cold symptoms paired old age?


The US using method literally everyone else fact vast majority deaths 80+ year-olds?


Oh, well say so! guess kill already get right? Lol, it’s killed 5x amount. 🤦‍♀️ Yeah it’s not. all.

First flu deaths aren’t counted, get statistics literal algorithms. Second worst flu year decades 2018 think 10,000 died, THINK. 

Third 12 months, 5 months here.

And fourth Texas hiding deaths. CDC shows 6,000 “excess” deaths far year last 5 years. attributed “pneumonia”. Nope. Look Bolsonaro. turn Boris Johnson denier reasonable person (at least concering subject), though.

The REAL fact matter people lazy shit would rather pop bullshit microwave 1. US reached peak death yet. Death lag infection couple weeks reporting death lag behind death 1-3 weeks, look Worldometer cases started rise early June deaths started rise 3 weeks later, would expect see, current uncertainty high daily reported deaths peak. 

2. Treatments improved recent months, England said death rates hospitalized patients June 1/4 April, least due better treatments, see expect deaths continue slower rise time unless hospitals run beds, already happened hard hit regions.

3. Demographics. Back April sick people got tested large portion died. Testing avaiblity better regions now, rise cases larger portion younger milder cases, smaller portion expected die. Nursing homes play disproportionate role death counts. Roughly half deaths March/April came nursing homes. well-protected time, mortality numbers halved. ok...? don’t hear response point entire world doesn’t immunity covid.

Nope. That's exactly means tens millions Americans. whole ""bootstrap"" concept utter bullshit, reeks privilege. 

You ever learn make good financial decisions always poor. ever get buy ahead, save money time, never enough now. ever get even opportunity, cuz late bill costs half days wages. Cuz 3¢ overdraft costs $35. There's loan parents, bank give mortgage, buddy definitely $5k lend. 

If ever held $1000 cash already owed someone, privileged. That's reality country, gotta get bubbles see it.  know. would good someone could confirm 100%. That’s exactly reason get flu shot now. I’d get flu every years since adulthood would knock commission days. I’d never get shot because, well, hated shots one reason people say shot isn’t foolproof. last time got flu, bad become delirious nearly passed middle night. Since live alone scared enough go get car drive hospital. I’ll take little poke arm there’s even small chance prevents experience again.

Edit: mention sad joke urgent care center local hospital. waited six hours feeling like death room full sick people. I’ll anything avoid going back there. Eventually tattooed onto skin along w vaccine read w infrared light. Sound futuristic?

Here theoretical question wont answer-

If 0.6% people die alcoholism/obesity/home abuse due lockdowns, worth saving 0.5% people? younger generation handed prime opportunity distinguish Boomers they've loudly criticizing years. And, push came shove, turns also took lazy way boring inconvenienced them.

It’s rest state governor acting like idiots. I’m honestly embarrassed Floridian right now. 1200 readers ...... strengthening numbers might overstatement.

But also: coming government. remember mine (the US) tried classify pizza vegetable. US UK smartest healthiest countries world, including leaders.

Trump can’t buy virus off. optimistic. around instead, may kept stockpiles masks advance, rationed populace like Taiwan did. Aside that, I'm convinced things would different Obama. 

Remember EU UK also shit shows took ages take action. incompetence/inaction unique Trump America common among Western governments. France instance reopened general aversion masks distancing, daily new cases steadily increasing 1k day. insane numbers like America, still bad numbers. people , WHY?

I'll give another example, mom volunteered food pantry. literally would accept donations fresh vegetables like greens, eggplants, radishes etc get people eat matter prepared. 
You gotta realize we're talking rural fishing/farming community here. way shape form blaming people, product poverty. people grew families parents always working often feed whatever convenience foods available. I've heard every horror story sun, things like kids ate hamburger helper prepared every night years. 

So education definitely factor, I've seen lot success stories myself, simple saying teach make lentil soup watch blossom. would also love sources regarding claim.

China always open cooperation coronaviruses, remember BYD's masks get U.S.? restrictions US CDC

China even pledged open vaccines public good

What United States do? Unwarranted suspicion Chinese data (shame Harvard even guessing death toll parking lots Baidu search hotwords people exaggerate deaths logging cell phone numbers) accusing China stealing vaccine information none leading vaccines available

Tell me, China go ahead steal vaccine data Germany UK?

No one steal something exist.

What US asshole comes cooperating fight coronavirus, Trump wants get re-elected countless Americans sacrificed Americans brainwashed mainstream media want blame Chinese data maintain ridiculous sense superiority

That's ridiculous. got mine soon became available year, cost cent. Dollar?

Yep. I'm getting disillusionment phase myself. everything asked early months, others didn't, everything still fucked, think ""why bother then? made depressed isolated lonely nothing, cocktail anti depressants sleeping pills ativan, clearly never go away, fuck this"". feels like made life shit promise would weeks, maybe months most, nothing people grade listen principal punishing us cancelling fun stuff promised end year. work get reward I'm feeling hella fucking disillusioned. overwhelming majority deniers never achieve anywhere near level self-reflection.

Then cases higher ever Monday Tuesday, partly due backlog reported weekend. 

Now week curiously lower cases week, I’ll concede Trump fucking numbers. Somehow, don’t think happen. week bring new numbers haven’t seen before.

Yup, Trump's idiot, people dying China. China covering up. Seriously, even without El Pais reports something really weird death statistics: soon opened tourists suddenly 1 3 deaths per day rolling average, Italy time still around 40 60 per day much smoother slope That's countries publish stats recoveries. Look Norway, long time, see looks like 8,000 people recovered one day.

Recovered, following general way done, means 2 tests taken one week come back negative. understandable attitude, that's route health happiness. you’re lying sack trolling crap shadow edits Yet, somehow, still hoax people's eyes! never understand intentional willful ignorance people. look forward making final contribution. Anti-mask passive aggressive. I'm open consider anything.

So far never heard anybody give plausible answer many countries around world hiding countless COVID casualties without *anyone* able detect it, anyone reporting it.

You'll see coming lockdown, CDC saying IFR 0.4%, revised 

Now they've recanted bit IFR estimates line studies - 

As see, gotten highly, highly political one point science based.

So, numbers - 

0.1% IFR = 280K deaths total, 

0.4% = 1.12M, 

0.65% = 1.82M dead. That's deaths, double ICU survivors permanent lung, liver, heart problems rest lives. Always interesting read State puts cap number people allowed gather single place. case number 30.

Is arbitrary state actually possesses resources infrastructure trace individual, whereabouts, interacted with, they've etc? think LOT there. MLB hella teams players. nba cut teams half let teams playoff hunt bubble. got downvoted hell suggesting “high percentage” professional athletes careers ended catching COVID.

They absolutely will. virus **specifically attacks lungs leaves permanent scarring.** Even hindered much become hell lot less useful team second play impacted even tiny bit. perfectly healthy 20 something startup far appealing 22 year old Covid may far worse wear year road. 

You trying claim still even career, many still have, they'll worth hell lot less matter given virus works. people survive encounter Covid, that's logic, reality though majority Americans medical debt, homeless, result virus direct affects flat croak. jobs simply give 2+ weeks vacation illness stands, unless fed steps renters make majority America place recoup either making even fucked. know net worth ~$300,000,000?

It well month since US overtook previous peak. previous peak deaths occurred 2 weeks (apart couple outliers) 2 weeks peak infections.

However, now, US barely half number deaths per day peak. Even month cases escalated way past previous maximum.

What's different time round? Jesus he’d probably say “Dude, wear mask!” stimulus money growing fields probably. know want be?...In shootout bar Texas pandemic. Holy shit, really energy left waste pretending national pride. Influenza flu, typically categorised H#N#, like H1N1

Lol. number. I'm California. think? think good people everywhere. real pieces work California. several potential causes HK's 3rd wave:

1. Government controls relaxed quickly. People allowed dine group size restrictions (albeit degree social distancing enforced)
2. sizable amount people given exemption forced quarantine testing. includes sailors, aircraft personnel, truckers. Inevitably people went city spread infection
3. sizable amount import cases civilians returning world. even boarded flights HK despite confirmed COVID-19 aboard (assholes). violated quarantine went city.
4. Anti-government protests never truly ceased people still gathered relatively large groups participate That's hilarious like makes think Puerto Rico wants corona dumbasses America turned back Puerto Rico hurricane Maria. Texas got hit hurricane trump it, exact thing happens brown people Trump's like ""we Puerto Rico? sell it?"" paper towel throwing, omg he's unbelievable. Puerto Rico without power eleven months. I'm even Puerto Ricans I'm still angry shit sad part learn history past mistakes.

I'm burying heads sand avoiding problems, kill mama COVID germs, I'm gonna kill right back. I'm curious say  Haha. travel more. Even reddit, find kind women’s free nudes. realistic too. Playboy men want fake-looking white women. Reddit, asian, black, white race ethnicity 20-gilf ladies, height size, lady like amazon warrirors. Many post selfie get self esteem boosting. Obviously referring article stat say ""this""

Somehow actual deaths coronavirus confused scare tactic.

Whose tactic they? one died. scare tactic caused it? this?

Unless one believes God trying scare us, can't scare tactic. That's sentence decided use dead bodies scare tactic? I'm part penis.
There's many us here, imagine, we're fairly small. Careful. actually know funds go correct person? want know irelevant. accusing, bring evidences. Depends. Insurance providers try weasel literally payment best interests pay instead force take multiple tests tangentially related things either put actually getting treatment, flat die pay litany pointless tests actually get treatment.

Insurance thing bargain get treatment. get treatment. can't imagine pain responsible US Citizen must feel stuff like happens.

I personally dislike sorts regulations bans since honest responsible citizen one suffers most. Yeah, even *tried* using bleach?

Even worst case scenario (if sick) exercise least 30 minutes day. “Blame Lieberman dems super majority nerrrrrr!” include Japan list Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, NZ, etc. response absolute garbage. Yes, compared US, look great, compared countries Asia, really screwed pooch. showing. Cases beginning rise government still making shitty choices going Trump mentality ""fewer tests means fewer cases!""

But least people mask Japan part. people washed hands... goes show stubborn humans ignore much proof diseases work. Evolution doesnt necessarily favor Intelligent species abortions

Is possible engineer viruses perform specific tasks within human host--that is, create viruses beneficial rather detrimental human health? think always people don’t like told do. Especially fight microscopic enemy. I'm Canada provincial health officer recently reported community testing wastewater indicates likely eight times many people COVID reported. said that's keeping reports ministry countries. mess Texans.

And do, please mess Abbott. He's trash. Glad still sense humour. I'm scientist sounds plausible. want American not?? you’re talking industrialized first world nations, point sure. really anything US happy all. I'm 22 given I've seen basically reason deeply happy satisfied basically anything.

That's actually dangerous thought basis undemocratic ruling. didn’t support public option 2009, makes think he’ll support now? think chemotherapy working cool fought anyway. America nutshell. Spoiled, stubborn, stupid. It’s ok acknowledge vast majority America isn’t represented click-worthy headlines. It’s fair thing mention. downvoted it’s fun reminded you’re speaking broadly awful country is. understand that. Many still wonder virus skeptics. thought domestic travel safe. hope people get fully reimbursed extra inconvenience. Beautiful, America.

Happy birthday btw Jesus christ. That's serious. better quarantine place though? Maybe serves purpose unless political system fragile unable see health issue political one.  hope not. hope another reason. Scenarios like NY, Italy, Wuhan psychologically devastating population large, mention immense pain suffering victims families. 'you need take shoes inside' thing *Japanese* cultural tradition, Chinese. Florida seen massive spike recently, takes bit die. Thats early deaths falljng cases rising agree social distancing must prioritized gatherings must avoided whenever possible, humans naturally social animals meant socially isolated like this. I've socially isolated since March I'm getting quite anxious depressed able see hug friends person. Social isolation takes toll mental effects pandemic humans surprising may thinking. would awfully confusing problematic ""left"" ""right"" already widely used terms every aspect life. never used terms new definitions popularised them, would fine nothing bad would happen it. bleak. Memory B-cells still present produce antibodies reinfection.

But research still needed - durability &amp; effectiveness antibodies, cross-immunity different strains, vaccine effectiveness older people, etc.

It likely similar flu vaccine - good year 50% effective preventing flu. get flu, mild vaccine.

That would still sufficient put yearly death toll something like 30-60k per year, like flu.

The problem virus novel - something human immune systems never seen before. endemic, due vaccination time, life resemble normalcy again. Also miscarriages stillbirths spiking. It’s third wave, first never ended. never will, immunity appears, naturally via vaccine. told parents 500,000 1.5 million December 2019. crackpot then. Took flight got sick, felt awful 3 weeks. alot hoopla, doctors gave regular flu meds. Debeloped pneumonia persisted whole 3 week period. healthier would taken me. article making insane. seems like answer, no? won’t FDA play ball??? according source linked, includes words. source says otherwise? I'm dying thought Japanese dude happy kid Christmas, dressed cowboy shooting revolver. Nope. Stop making shit up. Even article says stop perpetuating idea. Stop idiot. Obviously referring article stat say ""this""

Again idea talking about, people die everyday across world every day people died last 6 months due covid US, course covid bad stop acting like hundreds thousands people dont die everyday dad one people flu almost killed 2013. Gets flu shot every single year that, said closest ever felt dying, dad done many really stupid dangerous things life. 

Even flu shot, I’ve gotten flu twice past decade, it’s always horrible. weirdly get fever nausea time though, think it’s shot making little less severe. Still leaves feeling super weak, even tamiflu, month anyway. flu joke. Upvoted you. Thank info. way speed limit sign reminds speed. Seeing others mask likely prompt wear mask engage actions prevent spread. It’s permanent effect - would assume wears while. Agree, much talk second wave, requires general lull sudden onslaught time. 
We still less first wave globally, fear Autumn, second wave truly hit world.  Filthy pigs. litter: Fuck You! I’m vaccines general - flu shots don’t seem like great idea. people say got flu despite flu shot, even Bill Gates (who definitely big fan vaccines) said one issue flu shots they’re effective old people, know influenza viruses mutate comparatively quickly, think it’s quite reasonable wonder benefits outweigh potential risks / side-effects.

I’ll admit haven’t done full research find flu seasons become significantly less severe since flu shots become thing. that’s case, I’ll happily stand corrected. didn‘t become smarter 100 years? 😅 Mass stabbings common Japan example. average amount killed stabbings far fewer guns multiple reasons this. One ways treat stabbings, even first responder situation, going easier gunshot, result knife fully penetrating someone and, likelihood, even fully penetrating vital areas bullet likely go way target, cases caliber low enough, .22 instance, bullet ricochet bones leading even damage. .22 caliber pistol likely break skull instance, goes eye it'll ricochet around inner part skull turning chance survival zero, assuming bigger caliber usually means much immediate damage take place getting killed. knife far harder *use* first result close distance means act killing someone knife also going harder simply shooting someone result far closer kill: mentally distance target 20+ feet away death looking like fell bullets, knife *physically* tear skin, tendons muscle, *hear* them, *smell* blood, etc. FAR traumatic everyone involved. means someone attempting stabbing going far harder time finishing job stabbing someone enough times actually kill going taxing every way, also means victim even capable running faster killer flat receives basic first aid injuries stand far better chance survival. even means luck factor entry area knife going thinner bullet literally tears muscles via force, unlike knife parts open were, could survive encounter well 10 stabs centimeters still live.

What *know* even guns option crimes crimes would still take place, average far less lethal even force applied. gun simply far easier pull trigger multiple times guarantee thing end dies, knife flat miss vital areas simply person fighting back, simply first stab highly unlikely lethal even aim neck. rarely someone machete, knife, even bombs going rack high body count, exceptionally unlikely someone gun injure aim at. even intent mass death, bombs harder put together gun set fail delivery, assuming blow first one common results wannabe bomber blowing up. saw MAGA Bomber US literally would succeeded death, minimum, delivery method failure make proper bomb, often biggest issue bombers many times they'll fail *flat out* actually succeeding. stabbings bludgeoning far likely survive result modern medicine evolved alongside fact flat harder acts: talking clean hit head kill someone hammer, talking 10, 20, 30 hits, talking deliberate, multi minute actions secure kill, gun unload 20 rounds minute even common HANDGUN assuming gun decent shape flat used someone minimal experience shooting, target mass people highly unlikely kill LEAST one person.

The harder something get, maintain, less likely used mass attack flat crime. flamethrower, instance, highly regulated basically every country even slightly improper use get lit flame well target making least enticing choice weapon. doubt *used* crime, *especially* mass attack, doubt it'd become new Glock Shotgun crime. Even vehicular attacks far less likely fatal used pretty commonly across globe, unlike guns mass vehicular attacks usually require pretty penny commit is, again, another barrier prevents used primarily even murders, unlike guns US part tracking giant 4 door sedan going far easier tracking gun shoots 9mm.

If ""Would rather"" self defense situation knife gun, I'd rather proximity knife gun, simply long, obtuse object like office chair even throwing shit someone knife gun go long actually pick object defense, let alone fact actually possible wrestle knife someone's hands even leads greater likelihood dying, again, unlike gun *close* actually attack, guy handgun could firing wildly 20 feet away still hit result bullets work. OP implied going end human race. adding death toll religion caused earth. mean like dakota access pipeline protest? south dakota sheriff department need fucking MRAP?  soon excuse used people. doesn't. even close. calculations take account die virus (who may lose none life expectancy). That's like saying 3 people died cancer age 30, average lifespan Australian male 30 Well, it’s completely obvious photo eating MUCH beans rice. called out. really hit home relatives overseas asking we've given scary news see US. asked they've mostly business usual, except people wearing masks public (despite summer) keeping distance possible, otherwise everything open normal.

It's like dammit. could us alternative timeline. instead, live darkest one...

Self centered idiots think themselves. I'll continue living hidey hole hope biggest idiots die off. Basically, lockdown, restrictions imposed mandatory masks public transports possibility see 15 persons week. Parks, pubs shopping streets packed, social distance often non-existent. saw Brussels least (which ironically, seen real insurgence cases).

I hope get reasonable explanation. specified referring purchasing power instead saying ""150k USD equals several millions USD"" makes sense. Poor choice words. Sad hackery sad. want compare another well known human virus looks like hepatitis C me. Like hepatitis C, appears messing interferons necessary clearing virus completely derailing immune response.

Hepatitis C latter mostly mutating fast immune system cannot keep making antibodies. due sloppy RNA polymerase enzyme makes lot mistakes copying virus RNA.

In USA - basically borked due high number cases (vastly underestimated doubt) massive levels community transmission. can't isolate/quarantine cases, contact tracing confirmed cases mathematically impossible. There's point politicising isolation/quarantine policy going make little difference. late.

Ah yes forcefield PPE, brand new market PPE 100% protects nurses virus that’s 0.000125 millimeters floating air! I'm sure Americans doubting Chinese data, least ratio new cases deaths China clear.

There's serious disconnect number deaths U.S. percentage new cases since May 27, day Florida data scientist Rebecca Jones fired

If fired, Florida opened early.

It bad Florida today.

During first wave epidemic US, death toll around 2000 per day, US adding almost 2-3 times many deaths per day March, yet death toll 1000

Has American media followed investigation? Questioning? see it.

Americans paying lives fraudulent data. ...and funny rich convince government media (both own) tell everyone go back work - ensuring family wealth continues grow.

All reward, none risk. Current stock markets mostly running artificial intelligence pepper spray Sunday, China also recorded four imported cases **44 asymptomatic infections.** country include asymptomatic cases overall tally confirmed infections.      

57 + 44 = 101 44% underreported known cases. keen believe since many cases false negatives, many hospitals use CT scans alternative. really GB hopefully he’ll end recovering fully. knows though 280 still manageable, bad last time 280, since much testing back then.

This time, hopefully trace people get infected respond closing corona-proofing locations. Australia existed country 119 years UK obesity one highestin Europe. main reason covered much worldwide America still far ahead us Unfortunately narrative, it’s true.

I assume, thought odd offended using military get supplies needed. wanted us reduce military. mom dad's fault. 22.... new graduate. makes sad me. Kid probably finished nursing school jumped right in. America No, don’t. Facts presented negative manner anti-US. “despite biggest, richest, powerful nation world greatest amount tourism population, US manages stay 9th list COVID deaths per million due good management”?

Why don’t guys write article incompetent Belgium’s leadership was? France UK failed enough? guys don’t give shit. want people die Trump looks bad. You’re borderline psychopathic.

The UK worse results US. really worst we’re 9th list first world countries, despite largest tourist destination world? countries even testing much us? Aren’t reporting deaths anyway flu, pneumonia, common cold symptoms paired old age? No?

How fact vast majority deaths 80+ year-olds? no, let’s highlight danger poses 18 year olds fearmonger even though lethality rate 1%, barely slightly higher flu.

Fuck us, right? reporting confirmed cases tests, that's 279 (on average past 7 days) means. 

Confirmed cases death... people catch covid survive real number much higher. many ""pneumonia"" deaths put Covid column Gov Abbott could sell reopening.

Way many wanna lions-in-winter actually washed has-beens, senile never-was-ers. 

Money broken democracy. parties inherently criminal conspiracies now. take money businesses, lobbyists, crooks literally criminals deregulation, favors, pardons etc. everybody gets richer richer, inside system. Selling access favors instead duty. politicians spend time raising money actually real work. politicians leave government work vastly higher net worths entered. outrageous. Impossible. Inherently criminal. Getting rich political bribes job. that's do. works.

Ok write sounds bad. 

I wish innocent listened behaved ones suffer. 

I wish virus fair. Netherlands next nobody wears mask outside legally required (public transport) general attitude way imo one point centers disease control said didn’t help nobody wants odd one - 99 percent people aren’t wearing one don’t want start trend dutch people generally like “be normal” anything ordinary. premature births seems I'm inclined believe number going 50 million. assume low obviously going rage spread like wildfire schools open up. Ramming shopping cart def constitutes assault. Imo standing within 6 ft without mask. Considering deadly virus going around, ought considered self defense pepper spray someone standing close mask on. coughing, spitting, yelling people doubly so, bc even masks germs travel much farther. Fucking yikes. also know cigarettes cars cause large amount deaths though, worth ban those? cant catch emphysema someone restaurant next smoked cigarette car 20 mins ago  No. 99% abortions happen first 8 weeks pregnancy. I'm ok delivering giant cardboard cheque want. Thank you. husband works pharmacy, though could survive stayed home loves job knows people need co-workers. everything stay safe like hand washing, sanitizers, masks, etc know high risk sick people go pharmacies, fact life. fuck, man.

But like, join one mega-virus anything like that.

And, like others said, hand-washing, mask-wearing, social-distancing going crush Flu transmission rates like sledgehammer (hopefully). allowed guns ever again.

I can't get head around guy unloads gun crowded bar reaction.

Taking guns away psychos killed injured people save lives. gun first place. Taking gun away undo shooting. i'm glad many people going ive gone years years giving risking death like weeks months. guess stronger thought along. learn new ways entertain try new things. variety kill boredom yes.

You could said wanted say way could heard, since never learned how, knew, attack, insult, call names. Since people generally respond well that, outcome predictable. 

But maybe never really wanted opinion heard understood, wanted attack insult people. that's case, succeeded. What? expect timely arrest dozens witnesses terrorist attack? so? hundreds thousands died COVID lockdowns, means millions would died without lockdowns. lol fact place already full capacity god dam pandemic insane. people make kind sense.

2) Escape situation -- yes, can't always avoid confrontational situation first place. *are* confronted, everything possible escape confrontation.

3) Control situation -- cannot escape, use means available contain violence. Whether that's sort kettling maneuver using hand-to-hand pinning methods, put situation hold escalates full violence, so.

4) Defend -- Finally, else failed situation escalates violence, defend judiciously possible. fortunate never reach stage confrontation hope never do. actual fight, yeah, knives scare shit me. get fight someone wielding knife, *will* get cut. Ich habe ""bitte nicht scheißen"" verstanden...

Though suppose that's valid plea, too. Brazil, still first wave. making illegal you’re removing law abiding citizens giving even power criminals. good now? Arizona death reporting also abysmal. disappears almost entirely Sunday/Monday, current peak date death July 8 even though every day since higher (meaning huge delays reports), deaths routinely added retroactive several weeks excess deaths Arizona *significantly* exceed attributed COVID deaths, almost going COVID. There's explanation. country, Ecuador three different kind deaths.


1. Confirmed (around 6000, part world death toll)


2. Suspected (around 4000, part deat toll died symptoms getting test results)


3. Excess deaths. number people died tumors, cardiac problems required surgery causes could get necessary medical attention (since almost hospitals become covid centers immediately life threatening surgeries suspended)


So, yeah number deaths caused directly indirectly pandemic way bigger official death toll. want to? act everyone owns assault rifle plans shoot people it, people like ranges Places like Australia seen 99% decrease Year-over-Year flu cases 2020. measures we've put place SARS-CoV-2 pretty effective flu year. Provided people get vaccinations. survey done late May Associated Press research institute University Chicago showed fully 50 percent Americans either hesitant absolutely would take vaccine. 

 maybe surprised learn Puerto Rican's treated Americans, unless need blood soil. Hopefully they'll feline fine soon. There’s something that’s making lose speed though. don’t think social distancing improved last weeks. Ifit helps any, everyone selfish/crazy. recently reconnected couple old friends internet found taking thins seriously, isolating, wearing masks, pretty much thinking things were. nice talk again, especially since many neighbors seem take things seriously. That’d good start. (American) Boys raised without empathy allowed range emotions means grow angry lacking appropriate coping mechanisms daily frustrations.

Hey, geniuses, face masks don’t work protect people getting virus come doctors required wear first place expense people???? What’s point wearing masks “prevent spread” you’re doctor treating people who’re already sick (and dying...) virus? know, give everyone since everyone pays taxes rightful claim That's know drinking problem.

Like said .. dont ""shadow edits"". cant even think would want change something someone responded it. make change want see it.

But understand here. childish game assume teenager. downplay it’s impact protect chosen political figure.

Like said, dont like Trump. American thankfully dont play ridiculous game called American politics.

If choose politician like suppose would Bernie Sanders. Although suspect doesnt really matter much vote for. politics become giant game World Wide Wrestling.

It's funny call ""truther"", say ""the truth set free"".

At least agree that!

Be well. shit article, wonder ill-informed that's reading. reason infections... need 30,000 test vaccine infections know works. Also China testing Brazil. /S //S signals capacity. 

We hit testing level capacity lab result standpoint. Regardless many people get tested, ability, manpower, resources (currently seems) report certain amount test day. fluctuation results moving positivity percentage, days they’re able report get results. 

But nothing us accurately lowering creating plateau case count. 

We’ve hit plateau/peak able process tests data quick it’s coming in. 

Hence, example back logs Arizona Florida. understand American trash ideology that’s guy talked about. said could understand rich leaving would same. didn’t say anything regarding cutting social services on. 

I don’t think someone understand people wanting protext American ideology that. idea we're going keep forever seems silly me.

Who said forever? like 5 months. Maybe another year masks. gonna We've seen much worse pandemics throughout history yet we've managed survive outside isolation.

Sure. Human race could survive 7 billion people wiped out. what's point? Proof? called cod pieces.

Look thought pretty ironic anti 2a folks like one might find progressive nw, seemed think police would help didn’t need guns.

Edit:grammar ...using use one gotten trouble before. regional thing?? Truth told broke friend refusing wear mask. 1.25 million amount people died car crashes world wide. look US numbers, 34 k died car accidents last year 137 thousand people died covid. Neither, parties interests directly opposition working class interests. M4A major issue you, parties given middle finger America. article highlight wrong. thought outside gathering social distancing safe. ... banned using hospital resources. 

 Ride home guess one advantage COVID-19 running wild US testing vaccine easy. different story.  don’t like people social distancing pretty awesome me.  Doesn’t mean want impose everyone eternity. Two thing immediately come mind: Texas Texas.  self sustaining infections gonna campgrounds. medical expert alarmingly seem know president. US solve COVID-19 year - one way other. late Vietnam way (no deaths, cases). necessary, solved herd immunity (massive numbers dead people - millions hundreds thousands).

Exponential growth unsustainable - even virus. growing fast now, point run victims.

President Trump's current plan (eventually) solve COVID-19, survivors ""changed."" example, two kids 3 6. Assuming survive Trump Genocide, going trust US education system keep safe? someone loves brown rice beans feel attacked. Religicoviots. suck layers corruptions. 

hospitilizations deaths least harder hide less variables. 

And say hospital capacity. pure regular ol' hospitilization numbers. 

At least state, readily available tracked. IDK texas unfortunately. 

Everything measuring trends anyway. None stuff super accurate even super important day day. mean, different 8K one day 12K another really useful general public. trend important. 

Hospitilizations death trends easy, simple numbers spot trends. problem initial delay, initial delay moot middle lol strict gun control guns shoot range.

The concepts mutually exclusive Vaccines yes, treat? Fluids bed rest? disagree. someone wrote kills 200-700k people year. considered OK. wondering imaginary line says XYZ thing kills this(some number) many turn world off. line deadly things. ok sacrifice 200-700k year 900k. right sense worse 1918 flu Why? (Brit here) forgot Texas ""South Korea reported 14,000 cases 298 deaths pandemic. Saturday’s 113 infections highest single day since March 31.""

But,

Daily virus cases spike weekend, health authorities warn

The number new daily virus cases identified Friday South Korea surpass 100 due infections detected among workers flown virus-hit Iraq sailors Russian ships docked here, health authorities article pertaining exhaustion social distancing Americans. strange hill literally die on. interesting context term tinge irony. Canada.......eh?

lol......yes, Canada take the, ""Think person first"" attitude limits. But, indeed fault.............it's good fault. Far better the, ""screw you, I'm ok"" attitude.

The interaction see entrances Tim Hortons funny. (Not much right social distancing, normally goes two people get door time). normally speed bit, trying get door handle first...........not get person, able hold door open person enter first. course, loser (the person actually walk first) mortified, ACCEPT kindness instead giving out. say, ""Thanks much"" walk through. But, always second door six feet in, first person grab door first door opener person choice accept returned favor.

And poutine. Keep shifting goalposts.  change year since vaccine won’t end it? god endanger others praise fucking silent invisible? likely he's figment stupid, half-baked brains. bystander suffering thousands rape priests. But, needs praised like narcissistic child. I’ve seen pretty large protests involving many armed people police seem behave differently. Tell tried training knife partner.

Anyone martial arts know even gun, chances side confrontation begins within 21 feet. gun, *will* get cut, period. Haha, seriously based actual knowledge say that. I'm expat China, city local transmission months. actually genuine real knowledge China believe news tells you? state something though fact reality know talking about. curious what's wrong sports bar though? I'll vote I'm getting fuck out. willing let *you* die *our* sins.

Maybe prayed us would accept God easily. - prbly life death virus though. still leaves great deal people permanent damage organs. They're bored adults stupid adults..... type argument something get...masks pretty much mandatory places, care catching it, put mask public place spread case it. anyone want get back life (spoilers: essential workers whole time) trying kill someone? everyone actively trying stop spread, loved one get taking care hygiene point. That's everyone else supposed to. Op never mentioned going around without mask anything. Hundreds bars licenses suspended 9 hour delay fetching comments.

ZERO reports systematic killings credible news sources, biased ones ""interviews"" like 8 people expect represent ""1.5million"" people facilities? 
I never said nothing sketchy, five year old‘s reading comprehension. never addressed points either. Neither credible news sources say death camps arent comparable concentration camps used Nazis. accurate name either reeducation camps (official names) labour camps (more accurate).

:o

I'm shocked! Shocked appalled! Wow, wearing mask another year gonna HARD everyone. We're 5-6 months people act like decade. hope actually gets rolled Nothing ever really changes. result putting party country/state. Genuinely, I'm sure point would be, either.

Things way worse Texas reporting made damn difference. state still open.

And know hospital would confirm deny anonymous tip. presumably they'd searching tipster. large number people literally still give shit directly affects clusterfuck. Bonfire. school opens person beginning huge outbreak. every republican voting trump. know many voting Biden. Really 1/3 country like describing brainwashed. know plenty people area, voted trump 2016 voting Biden even though goes views trump horrible real affects me. agree. Make sure document everything carelessly show negligence. Funny, that's told asked teach statistic Grad school.

Those relevant variables. could string together show formula would play out; seem either trolling unwilling consider full effects. leave this. Even dealing small number (i.e. probability transmission) multiply huge number (i.e. student's exposure opportunities) end big number. kind like Superman 3 situation.

You fun though. r/NormalDayIntheUS could be. lower last 2 sundays. There's lot science yet that, looks like immunity proportional bad disease was) Also one guy got amputated? either going die there’s permanent brain damage get amputated. There’s way anyone ever gets better, they’re lying us. I’m thankful live Japan. There’s “widespread” anti-social behavior kind deniers here. But..... thats SoCiaLiSm. Hockey Noon 1 games go OT. Incredible You’re even subject original post, lol. entire point people insisting still socializing despite raging pandemic. requirement also address maintain mental health, lol. Maybe need chill IBS? Someone weeny peenie even see Republicunt failure. sides fucking things years without anyone cleaning mess.  go thinking ""opinions"" still correct.

""I mean, pandemic -- that's God. can't argue God, ya?"" US accuses China be, mean.

I still see drone shots lot bald shaven uigher loaded train carts, US.

US near CCP. Ah, good ole punctuated equilibrium. fatigue actually coming back bit. Two three days every week accompanied core aches slight loss balance. happens I'm dead day usually can't find comfortable resting spot couple minutes might bed 12 hours, sleep four.

Actually Fri Sun now. Sat felt totally fine reason. still stuff around house laundry beat up, that's it. hundred meter walk corner store earns half hour couch.

And like you, life normally active. work HVAC pull around heavy stuff day 15-20k steps. work get going bad part. back truck stare minutes catch breath.

Best wishes. even much worse election.

The election bit scares most, Either Trump wins continue crazy train, Trump loses get experience Lame Duck Trump... imagine Lame Duck Trump somehow 10x worse anything experienced far. Yes hopefully dangerous radical leftism completely destroyed soon. What? mean make effort make antibiotics useless slight inconveniences?

Joking side, live Philippines pretty much backwards healthcare system US (guess that's got from), ALWAYS give subscription doctor visit. think required pharmaceutical companies. 

In order sick leave approved get certificate doctor. work encourages us take sick leave instead going office sick since leaves brings whole production floor halt. Every time get 3-4 different prescriptions. Sometimes antibiotics, sometimes not. usually throw trash way cause know need days rest tea... Trump end result, shitshow decades making. government reflect people whole. idiot president user? know bunch doctors party together. live Florida. 🤦‍♂️ Like think turning corner heading back realized Sunday numbers American Dream. Yeah fucked Trump administration, look bad Europe also, think contributed delay ignorance provided contradicting information. organization long corrupt...here’s article dated May 2019

 Philippines.

Most country poverty, cannot enforce strict safe way daily living. People money opt stay indoors airconditioning, online groceries, food deliveries, working studying online/remotely. without money cannot that.

The president decided make decision everyone enforce strict lockdown infected areas COVID clusters. Problem people can’t survive locked down. They’ve given food money, don’t know continue. Obligatory r/conservative reframing scenario make liberals look bad media look hypocritical, De Santis actually hero Florida's low cases deaths statistic makes look good. surface transmission lunch ate left.

What unusual situation. hard mix technocracy democracy. issue still politicians ""selected"" arrogant optimistic, even expert council, probably listen less. said shooter went back sports bar, ""confronted by armed partrons,"" exchanged gunfire People lift restrictions immediately reimpose people thing longer restricted know right beginning China cannot trusted. brought safety pandemic. hand, know China cannot trusted, yet administration nothing months it’s late. one downplays anything. know obesity plays role COVID outcomes. Look downvoted post every time kid younger person dies... always ""bUt ObEse""

It make look smarter ""woke."" upset yet another child that's dying leaders want open schools, colleges, enough protect people. Pointing something everyone already knows sad story annoying hell Spanish Flu it’s Kansas Flu. Spain scapegoated unfairly. say looking post history use /s often (ever?)
 

 
You're wrong dude. think fail understanding diverse world is.

[Advice use masks context COVID-19: interim guidance, 6 April  currently  evidence wearing mask (whether medical types) healthy persons wider community setting, including universal  community  masking,   prevent    infection respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. Medical masks reserved health care workers. use  medical masks  community may create  false  sense   security,  neglect    essential  measures,    hand  hygiene  practices   physical  distancing, may lead touching face masks  eyes, result  unnecessary costs, take masks away health care need most, especially masks short supply.

This guidance clearly recommends universal mask usage, highlighting lack evidence, even going far suggest potential harm.

Hence original comment sharing experience Facebook, known meeting regularly WHO, fight initially described ""infodemic"" fear mongering, etc, censoring platform information contradicting WHO. Earlier pandemic, advocating universal mask use face covering was, see clearly now, contrary advice time. leap accept possibility Facebook censoring ""harmful"" information related virus -- publicly acknowledged -- characterizing general mask wearing harmful... well go. experience seems plausible.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Dude I’m that, Chinese people known hygiene country either. However, despite that, government probably knows sanitation important economic progress since it’s authoritarian, enacted policies area quite effectively feel (sanitation workers etc.).

I saw comment, aside four main T1 cities to: Chengdu, Lijiang, Dali, Urumqi, Yili, Kashgar, Qingdao, Jilin, Hohhot, Baotou Stone Village, Lugu Lake Surrounds, Turpan. hike/ sightsee quite lot. 

I honestly feel comfortable hygiene-wise (food, sanitary equipment, general cleanliness) middle bumfuck nowhere, Yunnan, places I’ve like Delhi, Jakarta, Yangon. context, Dalian total population 6.7 million people.

Man NHC really flexing testing muscle Urumqi Dalian. cases went first smaller testing strategy, days later decide say fuck it, [test pool size use Dalian 5 people per pool, 200,000 separate PCR tests day.

Also contest: far peak testing capacity entire US 950,000 people day. Louisiana coming HOT super simple. never type people would burn whole country know literally everyone better them.

This happens fuck around let control checks balances. Murica. ""Dr. Joseph Chang, chief medical officer Parkland Hospital Dallas, Texas, [told ""20-something"" girl visited 80-year-old grandparents going party friends."" country hit limit democracy institutions failing can’t capitalistic humanistic wants speed information barriers disabled prevent things like this.

I think one fellows invented WWW said wanted save democracy, we'd away internet. Anyone want toss phone?

Oh, well, democracies always suicidal. watching one limping along. way several decades. 

Failing civilizations often stagger stumble around but, final collapse usually quite sudden. 

As keep telling folks, we're living Atlantis tomorrow. Enjoy lasts. Entertain thinking grand legends life today would generate 50 100 1,000 years future. Sorry, support claim.  unbiased 

I'm saying biased simple narrative try sell. Fox literally memos sent want days news fit specific narrative. think means much. 7 day average climbing every week hospitals filling. We're precipice serious disaster. wanted run like Trump business. Even basic Googling would show anyone would go. Delayed gratification strong suit.  Per Dalian COVID-19 Pandemic Prevention Economic Development Command Centre's ""Regarding city's pandemic risk notification"", Dalianwan District classified high risk area. following control measures enacted traffic, people streets Dalianwan District.

* Public transport taxi strictly banned

* Trucks carrying goods must present pass register entrance exit, must enter leave checkpoint

* personnel entering leaving hot spot area must take precaution donning PPE

* roads streets entering exiting Dalianwan District come traffic control. enter area one may go via Zhenxing Road entrance Dalianwan District, entrance closed. S7201 Express Way exit Dalianwan District closed, entrance exit done via Bihai Road pass. Entrance exit intersection Guangxiang Road Guangdong Road intersection Guangxiang Road Jinxia Road allowed pass.

Per latest pandemic prevention situation, districts Dalian free full scale PCR test. Starting 26th, million tests conducted day goal testing entire population.  Spirit airline types doesnt prevent clipping phone onto monitor, using google voice assistant wiki results. Probably something like that, maybe components immune system. science still new complicated

Here Pay attention, morons.

Everything deranged Christian fundamentalist doomsday cult government running around world claiming ""evil others"" really nothing covert admission list exact things do. 

Remember that. US could easily hit 350,000 year's end schools open. Sounds like cursed cycle life something K people skillset process tests already employed (they never lost job first place) high demand. cant train joe schmoe mcdonalds shift manager stuff quickly, requires lot education training.

You'll also need supervisor oversee them, also means manager and/or director lab effectively call 7 days week. people already overworked fuck. 

And like delaying sunday tests monday actually affects anything lol, get lumped monday's numbers (which there's spike every single monday). People getting test day later going make break pandemic. open!  provide benefit, **is** harmful children waste time. reason pushed force parents back work ""productive parts society"" aka ""make money corporate masters increase supply labor drive wages."" understand going through. Exactly. agree realize made good argument put much stock say.

If science well established, therefore scientists wishy washy pronouncements, yet continue make definitive declarations conviction...

Then, well, there's case telling ivory towers stfu enough solid evidence know wtf talking about. stop making absurd fucking appeals lab coats. Really it’s politics. world shut borders us. r/jesuschristreddit Wow upvoted. 

Seems US renewable energy supply lower 7.5% overall 2017. average: 13.5%
Canada: 17.3%
India: 23.4%
China: 9.0% lot countries learned lesson trying reverse deforestation.

Here Japan, 2/3 entire country afforestation right now. It’s amazing hope continues. We've reached Mad Max zone disagree, us... well maybe. Millennials: ""wtf I'm never going retire"" Actually, did.

179 new cases 2 new deaths reported.

It's report. actually read it; work via osmosis.

I idea reporting accurate honest, claim patently false. That’s lockdowns slow spread, don’t end anything. can’t starve virus like this, especially cases asymptomatic. goes away long term herd immunity, happens either lot people get it, sufficient vaccine comes around, years away. whole “if everyone stayed home we’d done now” mentality nonsense completely ignores basis virology. true, responsible deader dead then. choose wear mask. going respect choice? doesn’t make sense. provides truthful results, they’d publish results. China lies it, concern US? Oh incompetent president couldn’t handle it? shake head number downvotes. Seems like touched nerve. People hysterical. talking someone replied something BNO newsroom   agree, think US still stay keep eye happens China? southern CA (and valley) large Republican districts. Look cases deaths located see very, stark difference.

Houston Dallas Democrat cities hit.  
 
My point Republican districts well, Republican Democrat areas horrible global standards, instead joining forces fight common enemy (covid), Americans interested highlighting political side least bad. neglecting consequences social distancing. Similarly, can't say, shut non-essential businesses unless also saying, provide living income meantime.

You seriously need chill. Bc point ever say people hang bc need to. Take deep breaths take walk read again.  That's subjective. Yes, raw numbers everyone's better new york. least right New York tracks 5-15 deaths day. Less 100 week. Florida track 900+ deaths week. trend going upwards. Boomers’. all, “if feels good, it” whatnot. Nobody guns situation liquor involved either certainly looked like danger last year. Hopefully one good thing comes would possibility nipped bud. 

And NHS ever get privatised, I'll taking family next flight out. helps know fast sprinter, person faster ehhh. really sure that's going get sports bar. people holidays go work. mean go see people. Someone needs take one crosses wall church beat fucking sense people. please start taxing churches like these? make non reversible?

I bet church gathering madness stop moment tax status threaten. Yes also reports congestion tourist areas Sweden. region showing increase cases Gotland. little spread begin with. areas rebounds tested en masse. Also contacts positive cases tested serological tests give clue number asymptomatic people. Wow, VIOLENTLY American Oh yeah try it. lovely examples ""good guys guns"" insist carrying. reason gun control, mentally unstable rednecks like can't learn control emotions. They'll never become state unless people stop moving there. Population decreasing 5-10% per year. hopefully businesses follow Charge gun, knife run. suggest done exactly? think pass legislation raise minimum wage people better situation? think companies see labor bill double they'll keep prices same? believe realistic result raise wages, see equal rise pricing index, thus offsetting sort improvement thought would achieved. 

 really want system improve, want abolish minimum wage altogether. minimum wage give companies power comes hiring. provides static value labor workers provides room negotiation. Imagine world minimum wage, worker negotiate wage matches desired budget, budget match wage. companies pay enough workers thus survive. instead allowing labor market sort out, government created base minimum wage, putting companies equal ground essentially creating wage legal collusion, allowing skilled labor opportunity negotiation. want talk privilege, minimum wage case point #1 fluid wage market would benefit skilled unskilled alike. Given quite standard argument r/brexit discussion involving brits abroad, highly likely hyperbole. would prefer sit get shot?? Fucker takes aim me, take aim Wow, difficult situation. Thank sharing. Terrifying know *feels* like nothing, keeping safe keeps others safe well. can’t know certain might hadn’t taken seriously, *can* look case/hospitalized/death stats hopefully take solace knowing worked hard keep contributing them. Yeah mental healthy person would never that. thread - thousands people assuming understand science, don't.

At least wear masks though.

Wouldn’t know conservative friends’ Facebook pages. Apparently hospitals get money every positive coronavirus case/death, they’ll count non-COVID death COVID-related person tested positive COVID 🙄 crazy people everywhere. fringe cases large country.

And American see abroad wealthy. It’s known vs unknown. That’s complicated.

And yes treat. There’s whole world drugs help minimize flu: Tamiflu, Tylenol, NyQuil. 

We still don’t know long term effects coronavirus organ systems life expectancy - EVEN NEARLY ZERO SYMPTOMS. 

I grateful job allowed us telework. sure hell don’t want Covid - least know it. people minimizing selfish, idiotic, narcissistic assholes. desperately want government held highest possible standards set far better countries around world. sub: Oh yeah protesting fine, never said gather large groups lol God calm down, sane person knows exaggerating effect. Quit looking fights. true places though. remember public health director Mecklenburg County (Charlotte, NC) saying three coronavirus tests. Total. That’s much prioritize testing first weeks. Well, that's case would pulverized back March said ""face masks work"" work colleagues.

They still day wear them. Somehow similar Hong Kong... normal workers, businessmen students, China Macau exempted quarantine (for China, even required tested!) either masks shutdown, hopefully people comply. sort news story repeated daily (changed ever slightly), every Fox channel, suspect we'd see weakening resistance idea two weeks time throughout US. Masks help stop spread, data there. 

The initial argument masks stop spread (entirely) still correct. change narrative ""wearing mask heavily slows spread, drastically reduces extreme symptoms""? Anti-masks resistance comes many forms, ""soften"" message, we'd see acceptance. want see normal adult conversations look like welcome drop threads. german say dont 2nd amendment.

Fat shaming comment 3, 2, 1? Oh didn’t say said were. I'll clarify point, first wanna make sure offend you, intention.

What I'm trying say things heard US, I've heard country way (even though reasons would bit different, cultures different).

So, even pandemic, ""deep state theory""- people charge saying can't anything hidden forces stopping them.

Then there's ""muzzle"" crap related face masks. there's human rights issue raised regards quarantining certain people/zones etc. people demanding haircuts.

I say opinion without intent hating people I'm talk about, believe not, understand think like this, distrust authorities.


However, people hate authorities much anything 'disobey'. wearing masks February/March authorities asking to, thought governments released virus trying kill us.

Then governments started suggesting wearing masks, they're ""human rights"".

These thinkers, they're professional contrarians, saying 'no' everything authority figure tells them.

If everyone sheep they're following government orders, conspiracy theory fans sheep well, everything reverse, seem question shit relevant matter. look government opposite, that's somehow means free.



All topics necessitate rational discussion. need ask means basic human rights quarantined weeks, without anticipating result molding process fit existing information. need able actually accept answer find. Yeah americans need guns people didnt guns. That’s political organization evolved beyond city states nations training nurses, difficult. know hospitals used floor nurses assist ICU RNs, unit included. theory good idea, experience created work. think employing one two extra certified nursing assistant beneficial unit. 

If floor RN help, could give oral meds, dressing changes, turns, IVs (these pts enough already tho). still leads ICU RN manage titration IV meds (some patients 14 going time), anticipating care needs, monitoring hemodynamic changes, still full assessments. bulk work still there. another nurse you, management deems acceptable give ICU RN another patient assignment 'you helping hand.' patients acutely ill virus presents, disservice people families dealing it. 

This grim, really shown ugly light profit hospitals insurance. system meant handle disasters scale prolonged amount time.

And address charity, well verse area. apologize. No? Wheres 2nd amendment?! past weekend comment ill-timed. talking point anti lockdown crew. They've using word fOrEvEr months order make lockdowns restrictions sound like horrible punishing impossible task means able see grandmother ever lot years left might die ever see again. Also extra strawmen get thrown like social distancing means ""locked inside house"" ""can't go outside"" getting vitamin deficiency lack ability even see sun. Usually punctuated ""if afraid stay home"" ""you're afraid leave house"" supposed imply sacrificing greater good like hero, actually home coward. 

It's part movement specific talking points. 4 weeks since I've heard anyone really exaggerate like that, may coming back resurgence virus possibly leading lockdowns. Watch really dramatic language cruelty able see family, course complete lie. worry, people ones protect us detect tyrannical regime taking over... MLS initial issues, already middle successful bubble tournament. NBA NHL look like they're going pull bubble tournaments next months, too. 

Considering quickly spreads bad around country, MLB's plan numerous pitfalls. I'm sure sport able pull season vaccine comes unless play bubble. Strokes, Heart damage, Lung damage, Neurological issues, amputations, etc...

Psst, that’s permanent damage, bro. Spoiler alert.  Oregon protesting non stop last two months.

They 7th lowest cases per capita, 6th lowest deaths. issue employers requiring employees come back office even work home. rationale that, long sharing office, social distancing fine. Articles like important keep emphasizing point shouldn’t going back office, *especially* work home. [i like someone took advantage system did, suddenly hate them? word looking envy.

See, illustrated difference. 

For many, it’s hyper rich beat punch taking advantage, it’s never occurred us compassion try take advantage first place. 

And never occurred someone wouldn’t take advantage, hadn’t beaten punch. 

That’s billionaires shouldn’t exist. I’m jealous them. sociopath one. No. idea coding deaths straightforward. EMTs get call person died home. Looks like respiratory failure heart attack. Could covid, test won’t change clinical decision making, gets logged natural causes everyone moves on.

Sure. counterpart senior already 2 strokes nursing home, moved hospice. there, COVID breaks out. 3rd, 4th stroke .. die. positive COVID test, doctor encourged put COVID contributing cause death ""assumes"" could been.

Now repeat seniors homes hospices around world (and ""Covid story"" taken place. know COVID breakouts prisons? Well .. people dying old age big prisons time! anyone heart attack prison age 68 going ""heart attack COVID"".

So think major issue. 

The ""excess deaths"" tricky situation. number using kinds interesting concepts like ""weighting"" ""setting negative values zero"". People look like authoritative. CDC admits much number actual covid deaths higher confirmed covid deaths.

Disagree. agree probably cases getting counted.

But side think basic thinking ""if Covid *could* contributing factor, say was."" good enough register Covid death. think major number.

And consider much happened seniors homes people ""just die"", covid breaks .. think kind significant phenomenon. course , last thing want happen weapons pointed people. Especially unmarked, unidentified ""federal agents"" whisking people away vans. someone attempting without properly identifying first, there's reasonable way someone know someone allowed scoop firing upon someone trying kidnap seems like inevitability.

**On Monday, queue patients curled long outside Medical's premises Stockholmsvägen 55. According visitors, waiting time due technical problems booking system, still good spirits.** 

\- expect would queues here, perfectly okay. take opportunity meditate little queue, says Susanne Ytterberg waited half hour NT met her.

A woman contacted NT gave queue, thought hot stand wait sun. Charlotta Hörnqvist son Vincent Gerdén also thoughts.

 \- waited five minutes far, takes longer that, maybe test Stockholm instead. symptoms already December, free test, curious see covid-19 had, says Charlotta Hörnqvist.

Ilham Ishak queuing good NT talked her, nothing bothered her.

\- problem. live close by, close home then, says.

And persistent Susanne Ytterberg finally got come test herself.

\- got in, went away. wish could get test result once, takes twelve days, says.

NT unsuccessfully searched mindoktor.se comment booking system. Yeah people - corporations! almost miss guy would make ""herd immunity yet?"" comment every one threads.

I wonder stopped? Surely can't answer probably yes now? Police carry knives fucking liar.  house, rules GTFO 

True parenting like that. non parents, really abusive parents make bold declarations like that.

You summed one post academic bubble touch professors academics run distrusted us “mere mortals” time.

That professor lucky meltdown didn’t worse outcome. wouldn’t gone well major cities. Whereas, example, England adds COVID deaths toll day reported, regardless long ago actually died. Including deaths people COVID past, recovered, died something else (as old people wont do).

The reason people holding places like Spain account gives ammunition use administrations like (Boris, Trump, Sweden, etc.) meant criticism Vietnam.

Wonder much corporations executives benefit without really following kind mandates hire back laid employees close every non-chain restaurant America want think possible.  Close small businesses well.  It’s pretty amazing far leftists reddit despise big corporations yet want create economic environment survive.  

You’re going see dead small towns big cities left wake policies year two, you’re going shake head say ‘I didn’t know’. think work. 

I decent number IG friends stuff. stories pool parties, bars, restaurants packed people masks. American's decided they'd rather live IRL GTA V server give guns \*even little\* . feel sympathy fellow Amuricans dodge bullets daily basis. Congress, Republicans honestly fear stabbed way shot.

I know shot walk park there's something primal stabby things. feel weird thinking it. rational thought discussion, sides. Present facts, truth come facts, people cant listen facts. That's problem. Wait, that's problem! Funny say nothing substance say, OP one saying unanimously hates rich people.

I get might dislike system, agree, it’s unfair, hate wan’t, difference.
Just someone took advantage system did, suddenly hate them? word looking envy. 

I doubt system change lifetime, (although hope Americans get welfare sorted, issue fixed long time ago), best bet try take advantage it, still alive able enjoy benefits.

Not saying unfortunately  go understand guns lead needing guns? need defend gun people guns. many issues America could improved making guns illegal. Like police guns, less people would murdered unnecessarily public would less hostility towards them.

So many countries manage without guns, Americans brainwashed thinking need them. go ""oh people get stabbed blah blah"" would rather one person get stabbed disarmed, someone shoot 20+ people semi automatic stopped shooting too? First time proper flu, felt like death. could barely move five steps stop rest. knocked week. know flu really was, thought something like Norovirus, going around time. 

The real flu joke, agree... people seem realize flu truly feels like. pain discomfort faced reality ideology. upside listening landlords complain there's one screw over. think difference government seem least plan direction. easier ""sacrifice"" light end tunnel sort thing. 

The USA 50 different plans, shitty other, big idiot top spouting nonsense. light end tunnel exactly? Agreed. friend server, making great money right now. 
Also, congress seems touch prices rent. Extending eviction freeze good, basically bandaid looming serious problem Ive toilet bowl called New Orleans, doesn’t surprise me. Though know good people state LA, despise New Orleans Fucking Boomers ones controlling system. Get 'trapped system control over'. They're ones voting upholding system.

Also, Millenials nearing 30-40. aware young people Millenials, right? course, right bear arms resulted widespread gun proliferation US... police armed response that... police militarization increased steadily years due widespread consumer access weaponry even higher ownership rates...

The US situation criminal buys gun easy, homeowner buys gun hear packs criminals roaming streets, burglar brings gun expect homeowner one homeowners already gun think twice buy one.

There estimated guns people US point. data bit old, ignoring surges gun sales lately. Stories like public education mental health debate gun debate. tragic details interview. Elmherst hospital large number patients ICU died lack staffing. patients would wake medically induced coma confusion would remove life support system go bathroom would die there. would found 30 minutes later nurse would return rounds. apparently happened often name it- ""bathroom codes"". Truly heartbreaking. require political organization action outside democratic party structure, made much clear. decades watching dems continuously starting position compromise (don't forget ACA started Heritage Foundation plan) roll smallest hint resistance difficult see anything controlled opposition point, especially show hostility left wing party nominally opposed  Jail. main piece republicans want pass. called red line.

I took SAT ACT 25 years ago, along SAT IIs (aka ""SAT Subject tests""). way, could see really well one test vs other. fine ! ? jail Americans GUNS never make sense me. German here. 

As would care tourism industry. care fun. stop whining clean hotel room, paid that... /s guy history mental illness. one million stressed Americans snapped went rifle. Armed patrons? someone carry bar Texas? problem landlords still evicting people. never stopped.

The legislation written really consequences landlords evict. many landlords claim aware law.

It costs money tenants fight eviction notice goes record even eviction denied judge.

I would like see politicians actually materially help people avoid homelessness instead claiming did. It’s sad, true. always subset people care something happens someone care about. brought fists knife fight got 13 stitches face, I'm aware that's mainly transitioned slashing face running police. American US decided,    public education= communism. Ok two years... cares? go away time, everyone thinks wishing away, go away instantly. safe cautious. hard ask. Everybody anybody also “knows doctors nurses” tell hospitals Florida empty. They’re going keep playing. It'd make mad enough stab someone! fuck step like last ones I've keeping close eye trials I'm seeing get great? Like, side effects experienced line pretty much every vaccine still early I'm seeing red flags effectiveness. 

Please explain vaccine answer. I'm preventatives kept isolated since march, ultimately vaccine certainly answer. Unless saying keep due diligence vaccine rolled enough hit herd immunity. I'm agreement. LMAO recommend. 

Hell. whole point 2A prevent tyranny good luck taking US Armed Forces single shot AR. Judging well whole ""wear mask"" going far US, I'd guess see big increase anti-vaxxers there's vaccine available. good aspects US even defending right now? I'm sure accurate OECD page tbh. Data national grid UK shows 41% energy renewable sources. also get around 20% nuclear. like guy Detroit stabbed 77 year old woman refused access wearing mask. tried stab sheriff getting pulled later on. guess we'll see happens week. numbers curiously low, I'll concede you. somehow can't see happening. think week going worst week yet. incoming 'and axe' comment, watch vaccine one. I’ll admit, I’m nervous. thinking waiting months see people reacted shot got it. Oh yeah! Guns anyone everyone! America! Yay! Vent away - feel same! once, I’ve said feel crazy too! discussion shouldn’t around it’s right thing cut run press already establish advantages. Ie “I would thing”. conversation let’s increase education, universal healthcare, social safety nets ability thepolitical system 
respond. Saying “I would thing rich it’s okay” tacitly reinforcing established system.

Added next paragraph 
How argument framed says lot. “The rich right moral duty leave USA protect family” statement unknowingly loaded American ideology.

Added.

If enough rich people insulate next pandemic measures put place prevent next one? depends law says, made law all. one getting shut here. business usual (the entire area) throughout exactly hidden. Even Mayor advises, writing, ""you what's right you."" took 7 flights last 2 weeks. give sanitizers clean seats, flights usually full room. People wear mask everywhere. dangerous going supermarket IMHO. Many Countries take people temperature leaving arriving. Even 5 years.

The last 20 blip.

Take one day, actually *one moment* time...apply mentality everything even Covid enjoy life bit more. important goals plans future, worrying wearing masks social distancing next 5 years silly. Right, would ""hiding stats"".

But end result would doctors working really overburdened situations, taking part country's national dialogue COVID talking big problem ..

.. looking nationally reported numbers seeing really small numbers.

And none would raise flag this?

But think happening several countries, right? Brazil India Russia China Japan pretty much Africa Middle East .. countries significantly deaths reported somehow doctors nations able raise voices it?

All countries really bad situations hospitals .. yet search something like ""india covid hospital"" [these explosive images proposed idea, yes? countries much bigger crisis going ""hiding"" somehow? Quoting context!  Brilliant! really understanding economy. smart. think pointing almost certainly illegally carrying weapons, unless went bar pandemic stay sober. No, subject state sanctioned violence inanimate object indeed suffering. right keep bear arms important shall infringed. American here, listen moron, justified opinion Many people US already that. ...while rest. mean I’ve visited like 8 states, okay. 

Imo, country nothing like see TV Reddit. Every country issues, US it’s dirty laundry aired entire world entertainment tv. 

Again, don’t get wrong, us problems. day day normal craziness either overblown nothing day day life. example, hate trump want, absolutely change day day life. greatest power set tone, poorly, minimal actual impact life. 

In many trips US, could give examples US objectively fucked different anything you’d see Canada? $1200 better nothing, end day isn’t enough, might pay 2 weeks worth bills isn’t including food. I’m probably furloughed end year.. it’s possible could go shorter (I hope) longer. Know many better paying jobs available? Barely any.. hiring freezes end year. Can’t waiter bartender since aren’t even open open partially opened.. means 30 servers have, 5-6 brought back. Taking away $600 week tune, need say “hey got u $1200”. seems like slap. 

Sorry rant.  I’d give +1 creative, no, no. Hope husband stay safe. That's rough. Sorry hear that. Hmmmmm... Yeah, that's figured, although (without really going deep details) GDPR sounds reasonable enough. Hmwell .... saying data suspect uncommon anxiety depression right now.

Putting sub might help.

22 awfully young high risk Covid. Absent underlying heart lung problems unlikely kill you. happen rare. likely greater danger something else. Oh, see, conspiracy. I'm trying feel like government ability outclass outnumber arms civilians bear. dont need write high school level since exams, barring english social studies, wouldnt require high degree writing proficiency. long understand lectures questions asked them, proficient enough. without writing tests, levels playing field students understand speak english cant articulate well enough sat/acts liking gonna happen time soon. Farmer organizations lobby government hard get subsidies profitable cash crops. think ""Got Milk"" posters every elementary school lactose intolerant kids can't even drink milk? It’s really generational. 

If 1970 liberal hated Vietnam War gays. 2000, conservative hated Vietnam War gays. Nope, either little cases lockdown much cases lockdown help. :/s think US comparable China? I'd love hear explanation then. We're 10th world deaths per million, 30kish made NYC get 40k government money per death. Cool yer fucking jets. See, *this* real reason second amendment exists. exist protect privileged, exists people shoot back government becomes tyrannical.

Thanks, thanks really poorly written headline. first thought “ladies night?”. hearing Uyghurs year multiple credible sources, pretty well established human rights violations going on, including concentration camps, photographs details people ground. saw bizarre train station transport day. claiming nothing sketchy going on, burden proof really lies explain many stories reporting it, what's really going on, Western media simply making up. Also, see lot apologising China profile, use ad hominem, maybe want address that, too? right rest world wrong? matter long big party is, going party covid unacceptable. That’s line.

Also metric system China, seen wet market close? first two honestly likely third option, that’s it’s expensive transport live animals hundreds miles. first two options related China rated study extremely virulent diseases happens sit goddamned epicenter disease. that’s suspicious you’re idiot. 

I’m claiming virus manipulated designed lab. think it’s far likely studying particular, naturally originating strain accidental/negligent leak. I’m even dismissing wet market disease vector. 

My personal opinion, studies seem considered, spent time China, low level lab employee making bucks side selling lab animals euthanized incinerated. Given effective bug spreading, would take live host getting sold wet market. Also, laboratory issues China really solid “[close attitude pervasive, China literally can’t trusted make [baby citizens.

That said, testing limited, one knows 4 million cases close correct, factor 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 80, 100, even more.

Plenty people know COVID-19 never tested, plenty asymptomatic carriers tested.

All think know 4 million Americans almost certainly infected SARS-CoV-2 140,000 dead.

Also, note areas America reported confirmed infection rates greater 5%. I'm sure largest confirmed percentage date, welcome data regarding figures.

Weird lot never provide evidence conspiracy theories. Aging tf they’re likely retirees qualify Medicare would lower cost almost nothing. don’t understand people sub eat false info. I’m American Taiwan. First news Covid came around Chinese new year vacation time here; December-January. hit news still rumor. confirmed, government swung action. 

Medical masks whisked shelves longer available consumer purchase, instead everyone go nearest local pharmacy, provide health insurance card order get allotted amount week. 

Meanwhile, wearing mask deemed compulsory almost public places. way back January February, now, new cases quite time maxed around 450, hitting peak April. 

So although we’re woods now, it’s still relatively normal see lot people wearing masks public. Moreover, still required buses riding metro system. incidents individuals challenged authorities wearing masks, obvious anyone mentally unstable. 

For part, people largely compliant cooperative it’s really benefited us great outcome. There’s guarantee we’ll safe forever here, vigilance still necessary.

Almost one English first language going mistakenly put umlaut. fair, many trust issues Florida's reporting well this.

Can't blame bitter jaded, thirtysomething I've landed myself. said... anyone living parents really ought best inadvertently kill parents. (I say someone substantial amount living parents.) hard find exact proof, definitely vary state/country, numbers confirmed cases come actual test positive, guess attending physician.

That's true.

You look guidelines coding deaths. tracked down.

[INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES CERTIFICATION CLASSIFICATION (CODING) COVID-19 CAUSE let pull 3 quotes DEATHS DUE COVID-19** death due COVID-19 defined surveillance purposes death resulting clinically compatible illness&lt;&lt;,   confirmed COVID-19 case, unless   clear alternative cause death cannot related COVID disease (e.g. trauma).

So ""clinically compatible illness"" part includes strokes, heart attacks, pneumonias, etc etc compatible COVID.

And see includes ""probable"" along COVID-19 MEDICAL CERTIFICATE CAUSE DEATH** COVID-19 recorded medical certificate cause death decedents disease caused, assumed caused, contributed death.&lt;&lt;

So doctor even assumes COVID contributed death, goes on.

And little later - reference section 4.2.3 volume 2 ICD-10, purpose mortality classification (coding) produce useful cause death statistics sequence listed ‘rejected’ ‘accepted’ may reflect interests importance public health rather acceptable purely medical point view. Therefore, always apply instructions, whether considered medically correct countries correct assumed error, since changes national level lead data less comparable data countries, thus less useful analysis

So [section 4.2.3 Volume 2 section dealing evaluating reported sequence direct secondary cause Effect duration classification evaluating reported sequence direct antecedent causes, interval onset disease condition time death must considered.

That interesting language.

This sequence coded way reflects ""interests public health"", rather ""is medically correct not"".

So .. that's official guidelines going doctors world. vaccine two years? People keep trying equate wearing mask violation civil rights.

It's violation civil rights nudity laws are. forced wear pants/shorts/skirt public.

Like we're middle goddamn global pandemic, one side *refuses* give even slightest bit help, side actually listens scientists experts. sides again? Laws like won’t stop criminals getting using guns. make harder law abiding citizens defend themselves. would really like know is.
Is media coverage US stuff like bigger, countries problems too? leads people broken heads? problem lot cases though.. ""GUN-problem"". psychological/emotional problem. 

* person owning access Guns made event happen. 

* also never able know (futuristically) whether sane rational person would somehow ""break down"" spiral downwards depression etc. (IE = perfectly sane historically law-abiding citizen could purchase guns decades fine.. event happen throws off-kilter downward spiral may way know that's happening (especially live alone semi-secluded). Maybe spouse dies fall weird conspiracy-mindset whatever. hard predict. 

I'm big supporter/advocate trying ""baby-proof"" entire world ""someone somewhere might someday flip start shooting people"". union pay second fifth times? 

Does union assist getting identical job town next door sixth time? give everyone done who? appreciate joke, 350mil us, 30k less 1% population American conservatives truly become death cult. worry guys 2nd ammendment stuff. Yeah right. missed, suspect still large. Isnt 400 top basic unemployment benefits Yep. much American Execeptionalism, recently translated selfish asshole-ism. Good. 

However confused someone writing book people; demand books name gym owners defy shutdown? guessing paid deal. says spent night gym owners book clients interviewing “Well, first,” Dowlen said. “I stayed night gym writing, book clients Ian &amp; Frank waking up, I’m gathering computer &amp; notebooks, waiting guys come final questions, SWARM Camden County Sheriffs &amp; local Bellmawr police (with K-9 units waiting vehicle) come bursting thru door….to me, sitting there, writing, myself. First &amp; foremost, law enforcement officers polite &amp; respectful. Look video footage national channels. tonight/this morning, writing new book chapter right now!!!” Quoting without providing context context part. really say America country struggles racism, sexism poverty? sums right there. 

Fucking crazy. Yeah are, are. allowed things get point are, why? Self preservation. Like Upon Time Hollywood quote article falsely. 

This quote article. guys say enough idiotic things without making adding words. 

This said:

“We knew getting into,"" said. ""We knew possibilities. But, goodness, man, three days one old-time revivals. unbelievable. everybody ask, talk church members right now, they'd tell you, we'd again. good."" group quite small tbh. Hard analyze everything trials. Yeah, wars plagues like that. fine gutted ""me me"" shit gotta stop. EVERYBODY'S hurting bad WORSE. There's alternative hurting. story sadly American. Maybe closer mil deaths 1-2 billion infected He'd probably sign pledge denouncing it. meant statistical potential. tired. Using math form statistic possible outcome. Yep. people never understand though. Sad. Vietnamese here, excuse English fluid:

They'll take flight home self-isolate mandatory quarantine there's enough resources so. people self-isolate quarantine 14 days daily checkup health personnel home area. Yes, Vietnam robust system disease control ward city village/town.

Edit : ministry health also announced emergency alert where/when confirmed cases past 14 days people take precaution contact MoH guidance/tracing.

Edit 2: domestic transportations to/from Đà Nẵng restricted 12AM 28/7 except special cases roads far know Versailles treaty reason. german citizen could guns easier treaty set many guns Reichswehr could Citizen forbidden owning guns prevent loopholes. go.... Sorry evidence required? virus goes cat change, transformed. virus. Thus infect humans. case burden proof prove cannot can. super rich force hourly workers risk getting coronavirus spreading relatives (""essential workers"" = disposable workers) meanwhile go countries coronavirus free. That's problem. Here's lesson people still learning....

If someone high risk household, everyone needs start wearing masks study found households everyone wearing face mask indoors precaution knew anyone lived sick, risk transmission cut College football survive without bubble either “Revival” held revival virus. here. really shown us cattle are. quit job, downgraded everything postmates. Figured hits fan I'll abandon everything go mountains till end times. Gee, knew thing gets spread... see lot people ranting raving others full fear porn, see little actual fear porn. replying article comments suggest still take vaccine developed people need continue wearing masks little longer. extremism see yours. Yeah dont 7 BMWs pool, who's really winning? body types kind stuck fat, aren’t trying? Yeah there’s excuse. Voters HATE him! beyond ridiculous IMO. reason America taken covid rest world recovers deals 100% word must used sub!

The places conspiracy nutcases get insane ideas also forbidden discussed sub! thing turn America around actually fighting virus is......something forbidden talked sub!

This one reason insane running show now. logical science believing country silenced must offend nutcases! self-defense though, rammed shopping cart Pretty cool mods get decide submission related story gets approved 🙄 lot people suffering blame. think dumb little league still playing could also old-time plague mitigation measure locking church 30 days, painting red crosses door “Lord, mercy us”. [The CARES Act banned evictions people living federally-subsidized housing, federally guaranteed mortgage July 

[But landlords still filed evict illegally meaningful consequences means anyone could evicted last week. 

However, [states offered less protections evictions still moving sub infuriating. One top posts something like ""CNN screeching outdoor concert thousands protest""

No shit. One activity meaning protest rights lives people. There's good time it. can't wait pandemic combat racism killing people.

The difference protestors mostly wearing masks. like ideal gathering conditions minus close proximity people there: outdoors wearing masks transmission low.

Christ look people suffering willing sacrifice personal safety think ""man guys fighting lives."" Cats manmals.

They operate breathing air order metabolize food. Given efficiency human (rough estimate... huge difference), would need amount air proportional size. means cat breathe less human, since lot lighter.

So 3 kg cat 1/25th infective one Human.

But consider cats dont give shit social distancing nap right chest.

This puts 1 feet away mouth.

The distribution virus based spread volume. means cubic (n\^3) dispersion rate (Also reason social distancing works). 1ft get 216 fold dosage (compared social distancing cat).

# makes cat 8.64 (*) times deadly human observing social distancing.

(\*) = 1/25th \* 216 fold exposure

I'm 32 almost everyone know unemployed way reduced hours, includes people 2 degrees six figure jobs. know millennial is? Lmao That’s crazy! I’m Melbourne Aus, we’re conducting around 20k tests per day many 42k done Sunday alone average 3 day turnaround! Plus tests free &amp; government pays $1500 need quarantine &amp; can’t access sick pay. We’re currently locked around 4500 actual active cases (albeit today highest figure 515. Coronasub: 

""Your response p()litical. 

BANNED!"" trial 25 months long?! still gun problems states eh? would love know people new excuse justify fake exaggerated Like poster said, transverse myelitis caused minor viruses like cold flu. May even triggered vaccinations (still debate). 

Basically happens immune response become reactive virus starts attacking nervous system. 

I speak experience 6-month old daughter 3/4 paralyzed TM nothing runny nose. Luckily near one best children's hospitals country happened rare disease team made full recovery (well, 99%). 

So, would assume spike TM, Guillian Barre (sp?), rare viral-neurogenic diseases expected Covid.

*edit: clear, got TM 4 years ago. COVID related. Sorry confusion.  Yep, Ohio Governor stated based county-level mask mandates (before went state-wide last week) numbers compiled Wednesdays. Weekend data reliable, never really been. know private labs (the already painfully slow backlogged CompuNet LabCorp) staff taking days off, hospital practitioners reporting data efficiently days, (perhaps newly 'less sick' people wanting fat ER bill waiting workweek). agree 100%, numbers start taking massive downturn rest week highly suspicious, see Mon-Tue-Weds plays out, assume old ""weekends off"" dip we've seen months now. can't drop partisan bullshit work together one time fix actual crisis affecting constituents. 

Supporters sides guilty too, need cut shit unite together demand elected officials. RT... Well answers question spreading disinformation purpose. admit wanting people die going church bit messed up.

There huge difference wanting people die wanting people needlessly waste medical supplies. want go worship death temple, ready die. rest society squander resources them. children, able accept consequences actions. Make dumb decisions put people risk, reap reward. Also know already commented explained like GB syndrome auto immune reaction known (rare) complication many viruses including covid would like let know \*\*actually know great deal virus\*\*

1. Coronavirus family - known cause acute damage affected organs.
  1. Known \*\***not**\*\* lay dormant body
2. infects \*\***endothelial cells**\*\* via ace 2 receptors
  1. Endothelial cells line every major organ body (so covid infect every major organ body)
3. Symptoms (and causes!)
  1. **Loss smell**
   1. Cause: Virus infects nasal endothelial cells location olfactory nerves (the nerves allow us smell.) causes damage inflammation. take heal regain sense smell.
  2. **Loss taste**
   1. Cause: endothelial cells mouth tongue
  3. **Coagulation** (clotting vascular problems like stroke, heart attack, pulmonary embolism ect.)
   1. Cause: Vascular endothelial cells - causing damage inflammation starts clotting cascade
  4. **Pneumonia** (and respiratory issues like ARDS)
   1. Cause: lung endothelial cells - lungs ton endothelial cells ace 2 receptors quickest easiest virus get respiration. number one problem.
  5. **Cytokin storm**
   1. eager aggressive immune response caused body's response shit ton endothelial damage
  6. **Guillian Barre**
   1. one im putting likely dude article experienced. (This another auto immune reaction) rare, auto immune disorder immune system attacks nerves. triggered sorts shit. Covid one things trigger it. rare, definitely something concern with. 
 

&amp;#x200B;

Literally every symptom caused covid root endothelial damage subsequent inflammation.

We know lot.

Thank coming ted talk. ridiculous outrageous time. I'm optimistic anti-vaxxers take enough effective, sadly. “Its health, compliance.” — coworker. 

Ive got wild idea. Maybe compliance sake health? um lot things directly affects. title morocco gave citizens 5h30 go back respective cities holiday week shut midnight. Causing mayhem lot accidents highways roads cities. 

Btw: yesterday 800 cases 7 dead COVID cases... many point make valid, don’t necessarily think statement made know much virus...

- Everything you’ve learned viruses wasn’t know studied.
- know absolutely nothing long-term effects COVID-19.

It’s true features virus seen before, doesn’t make effects one known. take decades figure out. say shoot virus fine, comply capacity restrictions. /s Oak cliff. Highest crime rate Dallas. 

It's extremely likely guy gun legally. likely patrons .

Oak cliff ive seen gun transaction, stop light, mid day. assault rifle handed paper bag, sticking like itwas baguette.  Guy hasnt found likely found neighbors friend hide people place unlike snitch help cops 

It's likely nothing masks plenty guy feeling disrespected critical thinking skills thats 5 murders 20 years shit first one 1973 PPP smal biz's disappeared $500,000,000,000 yeah $1200

The response virus nothing P0LIT1CAL!!! Gen X: ""..."" fire still dumpster. still fine. right applied specific type weapon though? arent allowed purchase anything want, case line drawn.

Or purely constitutional you? general.

Not every case.

Particularly case health care workers exposed high viral count. Plenty get sick die.

But, general, yes, people get less sick wear mask. that's going depend person may also impacted strain virus get. ignorance strong here.. shingles get herpes virus young person lyer life get shingles hard place visit. much correct. USA USA USA! Thats US needs serious gun control many maniacs wait till finally shoot gun. Thats many school schootings too. agree w all. say though, state, fudge hospitalizations bc count suspected C19 cases, confirmed. Virginia Hospital Association tracking that, thank goodness. one thing another. keep saying, least retrospect, excess deaths important. almost like switzerland literally stated fact. stuff I'm saying coming facts. Numbers paint whole picture, obviously  Organize leave state? organize way? Agreed. think US National Park Service take look take note Parks Canada operates maintains national parks. system much better compared US, Canada different country citizens aware considerate environment. heck church anything? could hospital, school, stadium, library, friends house, would same. assumes get effective vaccine point. hope effective safe realistically vaccines disease far knowledgeable take ten years. know we've put priority globally count make policy around it. 

As nation need take stronger steps mask wearing spreading misinformation. Ah yes..worst country new cases world...lets start sports...indoor sports coronavirus thrives. Way go idiots. Also studied karate. first thing learned gun involved, get line fire. ""has virtually GUN violence""

But yet still violence. USA ranks 94th List Countries intentional homicide rate (source: guns unavoidable guarantee murders. USA #1 list ? (I'll give hint:.. gun-deaths involve lot variables ""guns alone cause this""). attend high-risk event *don't* contract Covid good?

I expect fines contested season officially cancelled, leading chicken-or-egg litigation scenario. think lowering # people flight helps tiny bit. SARS-CoV-2 truly infectious plane air continuously recirculated across everyone. literally nowhere safely escape. tiniest amount airborne pathogen find victims far beyond seat released. 100% 

Idk fix immense amount stupid loose among country Problem necessarily parties, gatherings friends families near beach local law enforcement anything even though there's 10 people limit. start enforcing bit maybe people stop gathering masses less careless (source: I'm Barcelona resident live close beach, every day there's massive amount people picknicks, bbq, massive volleyball tournaments more). God's plan that. Nope. license holder commits offense license holder intentionally, knowingly, recklessly carries handgun authority Subchapter H, Chapter 411, Government Code, regardless whether handgun concealed carried shoulder belt holster, license holder's premises business permit license issued Chapter 25, 28, 32, 69, 74, Alcoholic Beverage Code, business derives 51 percent income sale service alcoholic beverages on-premises consumption, determined Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission Section 104.06, Alcoholic Beverage Code ; Response times little slower part OC.

I high hopes one pass!  little longer. ,😟 Bourbonic Plague. cost effective icu truck four?  eating alive. clearly money education healthcare reform wanted to. clearly ability time bring country first world. Poor people seem hate poor people lot know why. exposed countries know things could much better? not. 

But believe human inference pretty knowledgeable grasp people humans deal things. 

Touching something up, dumping numbers, etc etc, happens time. Making something appear better actually is. used almost every measure business. would think profit health care system, governors states finances tied tourism needing people visit “feel safe”, wouldn’t corporate executives do? 

If think government GOP entirely transparent 100% genuinely honest, idk tell you. 

And that’s conspiracy theory, it’s government shooting foot much many Americans take time educate theirselves matters, realized corruption issues plague country. 

But buddy, isn’t chem trails, it’s political corporate corruption. didn't. used sense grades, fact mentally disabled people generally get good ones, non mentally challenged person strut around proud marginally better performance ridiculous. Ah yes, pull (possibly) contaminated fabric face orifices someone explain happens placebo group? told live life vaccine? put risk thinking might immunity continue mask social distance? tolerated America? Stuff like makes argument shut shit seem pretty relevant beyond virus. people gonna shoot place maybe lets avoid additional threat violence beyond virus well. like time-out adults. Cant even believe genuine cynical idea. point, somebody breaks chain makes better life children. people late. never late somebody properly teach children I'd rather able opt SS. Seeing 1k paycheck go SS Medicare could invest get way better return investment frustrating trying lower occupancy could go in

Seems reasonable me

/s want believe Biden would way better job actually enforce shutting US providing us relief need make it. need vote people like Mitch McConnell. need house state Democrat owned. ever want see end, need people actually give fuck, god damnit Yes it’s nearly good product dedicated delivery service professional warehouse staff, special delivery trucks etc.
It’s huge investment sure, given it’s happening around world it’s weird hasn’t taken US. Many Americans get day batteries toilet paper vegetables (apart Instacart gig economy solutions is) last weeks Gotland gone 21 cases per 100K population 40. Sounds like major outbreak? reality it’s 13 actual cases 24. Kind shows problem 100k metric small populations. gives people ammo blame protests spread rather seeing reopening huge factor personally know someone paralyzed vocal cord secondary nerve damage covid. She’s late 20s, she’s probably never going talk properly again. ‘mild’ case never hospitalized.

Fuck virus, fuck anti-mask idiots wore masks made look like Nazi flag protest living socialism, expressing concern may soon live environment like Nazi Germany?! 
And course Nazis... third Reich taught American schools? Honestly, never manage virus vaccine treatment, society won’t go way might imagine. may well living early stages apocalypse. way life depended certain level economic activity can’t replicated anything close current environment. Tourism, travel, hospitality, live entertainment would permanently dead industries, millions jobs industries sustained created elsewhere economy. Normally shocks like would stimulate demand somewhere else, technologies we’re using place social interaction designed scale without requiring lots new jobs. We’d looking permanent mass unemployment poverty, economy unable provide gainful employment millions people. It’s skills would obsolete, it’s would limited demand new skills replace jobs lost. Every city look like Detroit. social order might collapse anarchy mob rule. It’s happened before. COVID capable bringing new dark age, may already started.

I think we’ll effective vaccine early 2021, though. sleep night? worry lose fortune become mere multi-millionares Amazon made entire US used getting everything want within 24h clicking online,

So...in week two going one player team they're going play game catch whoever drops ball first losing team?

Or go rock-paper-scissors?

This patently ridiculous. MLB, NFL, NBA trying play seasons pandemic worse suspended games.

Take season country get pandemic control let's talk sports. Yeah, quarantine fatigue isolation. see select people month. first time seeing someone face face lockdown 2 months, huge weight back. Plus people responsible isolating/distancing, risks lowered. Poe's Law work here. Enjoy choice voted for. earned it.

Ouch. Mississippi passed Arizona state highest percent positive cases. Mississippi 21.2% last 7 days. Alabama Florida far behind two. Well think faster way quickly lower amount people inside? three musketeers using noodles here.  It’s like 98% recovery rate!

""You're going responsible deaths 2% people infect! cares!""

Absolutely chilling. I'm surprised Canada 17.3% given nearly Quebec powered hydro (24% population) least 20% Ontario's power also comes hydro, 39% country's population. Even government's page lists 17.3% though that's gotta right? Everybody look there! ^uhhhhhhhhhhh government takeover! Yeah good thing current administration incompetent.

Someone would immediately blab press...and would probably president FLO! RI! DAH!

And no, Funerals grieving. Reddit literally discourse fiance's parents went 2 week road trip across U.S. Texas... There's reason talk them. nothing. that's problem. America China, two prime examples It’s design. Look “Starve best”. People wearing masks nostrils least get nose flick. ""The virus attacked central nervous system, staff stopped stroke,"" Green wrote Friday's essay.

What horrible illness. family get-together, Green's parents in-laws attended, took place home June 13. six went test positive COVID-19 week followed, additional family members visited in-laws onset symptoms. Five Green's family members tested positive mid-July, day Ceja's mother's placed ventilator roughly three weeks hospital stay. remained critical condition Friday. Green created GoFundMe campaign raise money Ceja's medical bills last week. 

And yet [800 Texas Bar Owners Expected Open Defiance Governor's I’ve wondering this. Maybe increased testing actually lowered official death rate. Great.

But I’ve also wondering seeing trend earlier death rates eventual go past former peak rates. shut fuck lol concept democracy using western perspective, local elections China thing population high decree representation CCP, proved 90+ million members party (making biggest political organization planet) 90%+ satisfaction approval rate population central government. people's congress 3000 delegates representing 90+ million members 1.3 billion + citizens, elected, appointed. also makes National People's Congress biggest legislative body president declared ruler life?

He declare president life, term limits abolished, wich somewhat authoritarian practice, yet far different ruler limitless power, others still voted leaders, Xi still kicked.  would remiss, didn’t say that’s slightly misleading, lot Covid deaths counted Covid Pneumonia, however even adjust that, still massive discrepancy year year pneumonia deaths. 153 texas. good lord Nope, read Facebook comment today someone trying avoid giving Walmart business Walmart's support BLM. shooter remains large.

Fantastic I'm confused going help anything. Maybe information missing article? I'm happy escaped US 10 years ago. count? fifty-something age group equally idiotic though. I'd rather stay home smoke weed, peers shopping without masks getting way close, generally geriatric spoiled brats. see age groups stupid retail job. Yeah, nobody leaving house know wtf we're dealing with. without 5G microchips? /s zombie viruses get fucking everywhere  isn’t really though. Young people immune serious complications like blood clots leading strokes amputations, needing ventilator possible long term organ damage. There’s much still don’t know virus. course possibility spreading older people. Well want population actually aware shit country would you?

I mean, would straight denial anyway yeah can't speak person still take precautions. time, constantly think "" what's point?"" people dying drowning bodies day day work. go home family posts bbq July 4th celebration. people breaking point ""if dgaf neither i"". baseball game mask I'm imagining David Bowie &amp; baby leading Warriors street gang strategic battle cases cola &amp; yodels lmao thank beefing resume Yeah I’ve heard part state terrible. I’m closer Detroit. Exactly. handover took place around July 14th so. New cases suddenly plateaued starting 7/18 actually decreasing miraculously. percent positive testing rate also improved reported hospitalizations down. 

Quite coincidence. Impressive. there.... opinion, also fact. primary cause capitalism. Grift symptom capitalism. much cheaper use money save take bunch vacations places beaches, mountains, sunshine, still come ahead  Hospitals across state rejecting sick people room days within last week state reporting 86, 75, 56 covid deaths statewide. state nearly 30 million largest medical centers planet Houston &amp; DFW. hiding numbers I'm worried much.  happened Mexico too, first discuraged using masks bc ""it necessary unless sick"", recommended worn everywere world locking period time. even afterwards wearing masks distancing. Funny china criminal. (if) America business usual. FTA:

South Africa moved dubious position fifth highest known Covid-19 cases globally, 382,000, rising rapidly around 12,500 per day

South Africa's initial tough lockdown response bought time treatment protocols refined, part force circumstance, becoming much better used USA Europe.

Already South Africa, 30 per cent restaurants -- heavily hit country's tough Covid-19 response regulations banning alcohol sales -- closed permanently, half remainder say may never open again.


While South Africa meant great example handling Covid-19, instead example rest Africa good start easily become poor middle end. Conspiracy theorists ignore real conspiracies made ones. makes think trick people ignoring real conspiracies. thought immune system match HIV virus - thus going untreated, HIV make person really immunocompromised?

If immune win HIV (so less virus count time getting fected), would immune lose finally? three states also 1/3 total deaths country. Cos sound like patronising prick? Small nitpick think mean Warships. far know last Battleship (BB-63 USS Missouri) US Navy service decommissioned 1992. I'm right.. right retarded, makes something much less realize pandemic helps speed process up? plus they're skipping safety testing like many wonderful ""experts"" believe. cutting red tape phases time. Unfortunately - knowing someone like - who've yet caught look guy &amp; say he's something similar. they'll catch it, perhaps also admit wrong, get called someone else sheeple/fool/tool/whatever, ad ~~infinitum~~ idiocracy... mark us zero, that’s works right? like took page Trumps playbook. ""Good ole Days"" marriage forced upon woman economic reasons. women economically independent marriage optional. Independence cuts ways men fact men longer need women especially bring nothing table. think rest world well beyond tired shit now. Yeah proof?

/s 

Well done explanation evidence. It’s sad people need laid it’s unfolding right front us talked loudly. don’t think need go far beaten path Chomsky find people pointing things. Remember ordered Hospitals send (White House) data instead CDC well, surprisingly NOTHING last week suddently numbers go O: getting downvoted people believe Covid-19 real. mind them, right. Good. Governor Death Sentence needs put microscope. Hell needs resign removed office! also seem remember Trump withdrawing WHO, guess like crazy ex can’t accept break pretend never happened


Then remember incorrectly. US still member remain member July 2021.

NJ going right direction last two months. Stuff like turns us right back around people STUPID. Suggesting people might lose right firearms is... bad people shooting restaurants protests hurt feelings?

Pretty high drama take ok dude, you’re entitled opinion Indeed. would agree assertion.

It's kind like forest fire. But, forest fires end. Nope, thought oh-so smart, asking could covered switching gears saying wasn’t possible, faulty argument got called shadow edited it, lied shadow edit, admitted it, tried “how bad thing” game bit, failed claimed forgot shadow edited, LOL, trump would proud you, truther didn’t get tons free money put bank account. It’s gift, first all, it’s low interest loan, it’s used make payroll, maintain inventory, potential clean costs, insurance rent payments, marketing information customers changing availability new services response Corona virus, exploring business options like online sales expanding outdoor services keep customers employees safe.

I investor brew pub business received covid-19 relief. One options management thought use money purchase building operate. However, building rented close relatives two main owners. conflict interest use loan self-dealing like that, even buying beneficial business renting long haul - money help business pull now, enrich owners relations anyone’s expense.

What using money for? created on-line ordering system, took ads local newspapers advertising on-line ordering; hired kitchen staff limit number people working one time - one person prepare much to-go food advance, need full-time cooks it; hired contractors expand dining area former storage; process moving improving parking lot expand outdoor dining safely; experimenting different options beer go crowlers using short supply; bought new sanitation equipment suited providing take food beverage; purchased takeout containers bags; started paid intern program beer making chefs.

All things help keep afloat keep employees still working paid. addition spreading money community utilizing construction firms hiring interns cooks. also personally pleased refused invest business unless employees books, table payments servers kitchen helpers common area (and owners want pay table - people working types jobs area want pay taxes FICA earnings - fact staff members quit implemented.). everyone staff receiving received unemployment money time hope start trend businesses responsible toward employees. Lol Wow actually beginning phase 3 Moderna vaccine trials nothing except typical mild symptoms vaccines tend induce gone wrong yet, that’s encouraging. I’m doctor - knowledge recall discussing pandemic mother chief physician previously virologist State Serum Institute Denmark, understanding replication essentially stopped two things; immune response lack healthy cells invade (meaning you’re *wayyy* dead). immune system basically better time respond initial blow less intense advice ever followed. People confused flu cold season past winter exceptionally bad (prior SARS-CoV-2). tons stories ""Well December/January REALLY bad cough fever"". symptoms specific COVID-19, they're general illness symptoms caused plethora viruses bacteria. that's terrible measure, fact HUGE amount people bad colds bad flus winter long...those SARS-CoV-2. thing notice hospitalizations exceptionally high period unlikely massive numbers people seen symptoms really. :( Problem is, time, “God given right” likely harming people. even talking gen z right teenagers Texas, he'll get slap wrist given guns back. probably see real jail time. wish people would wear stupid right faces. would save ALOT time energy. Ok anything people fat carbs right now? Cavemen know better and, like said, would gorge due scarcity. That's clearly problem people anymore Eeeeewwwwuuuuuuu 'dem Duke boys! Chickenpox technically herpes virus, ""herpes"" usually means herpes simplex. That's horrible. Calm down... it’s clearly joke. quite honestly joke stem somewhere. That’s pretty terrible positive rate. Can’t believe Florida still open. Honestly, I'd love see breakdown Slippery Slopes history action (or inaction) resulted exactly predicted might happen.

EDIT: Thank concern everyone! finally got script corticosteriods 5 day course Z-Pak... standard treatment mild COVID symptoms. 2 days in, feels much better.

We it, symptoms classic symptoms mostly went away 2 weeks ago. Still lingering breathing issues. rightly so. reports military loses guns time (in country never heard things) strict measures. think making arrangements children thats schools closed covid outbreak gonna easy, put them? Daycares gonna tell fuck right I'm pretty sure grandparents friends gonna tell same. lengths they've gone frankly insane. Like seems kind cute rational first. Well, needs sound, right? pipe crowd noise. That's baseball. crowd itself? Well, make cardboard cutouts. crazy people descend isolated madness. No! That's baseball. Everyone live magical bubbles somehow move around country without popping! That's baseball.

Not exactly sure got vibe crying. Everyone hurting worse. shortages personal protective equipment persist coronavirus pandemic, 3-D printing helped alleviate gaps. Anthony Atala, director Wake Forest Institute Regenerative Medicine, team using process innovative way: creating tiny replicas human organs — small pinhead — test drugs fight Covid-19. Here's another factor: every employer creating safe environment people return. would give money potentially work company keeping employees safe, company forces people workplace even symptoms test positive covid (even though there's high false negative rate). ""My ignorance good facts"" creed live Yeah right? “All extra unemployment keeping people home.” Yeah exactly point. American: like yer kind 'round here...

*Shoots statistics* It’s already like US. like 10s tousands head toward swedish East coast still country. Fuck you. spreading lies misinformation. 

Long term immunity known, sure, evidence suggest last quite while. repeat cases nearly year suggests vaccine last least year. Annual vaccines fine. like flu. 

Don't make people panic blog gets views. that’s one way revive economy ... doctor bills, drugs, hospital treatment -
gotta give credit owning it; that’s gone missing Sadly $1200 went China RobinHood. American industries shit people spent money Amazon things made China. Lots went Robin Hood stock speculation drive Tesla Hertz.

It couldn’t go airlines, hotels, restaurants bars partially closed. 

Imagine spent money rapid testing airports schools., instead Flat Screens Yolo options.

For 3 trillion dollars could given every man woman child $9000, don’t even get started wastefulness PPP airline bailouts. bailed highly leveraged gym owners multi millionaires, begged open back getting PPP loans. happened fiscal conservatism? Since republicans love government handouts? I'm guessing it'll empty shelves...

Where folks expecting holiday merchandise come anyways? allowed gun again? That's attempted murder, second degree! allowed freedom anymore!

The hell, man, dude barely deserves oxygen. Even responsible gun folks completely miss target. Ugh. Sounds like brainwashing session. paying attention? Things looking better all. 4 days 1000+ dead last week, highest week month. It’s get worse too. Legal assault too, Assault making person feel definition assault varies jurisdiction, generally defined intentionally putting another person reasonable apprehension imminent harmful offensive contact.

Yes! make sure trust responsible. doesn’t complete solitary confinement vs sharing drinks mosh pit. Soooo much room smart measures optimize social mental health (which extremely important) also fighting virus. that’s unfortunate, employers still need keep employees families safe responsible. one *wants* shutdown, *need* one. r/instantkarma realize pays social services right? services meant protect citizens situations like these...? Funny assume read fucking idiot. Haha, owning gun shouldn’t right. quick blame us (NYC) first city hit

Wuhan Milan phone. Shall tell here? America would surely succeed everyone afraid shadow like you. Ran away confronted armed patrons. link gofundme! NBA OG infected athletes. surely don’t equate COVID Swine Flu. also share research encourage people err side caution. It’s utterly irresponsible, evil, brush pandemic it’s nothing worry about.

God bless America. umbrellas require warning labels tell open pointing face. Well depends, definition conspiracies false (since conspiring bunch people agreeing together secret pact, something possible, repeated countless times history) theories bound correct. Hell, everything Snowden blowed whistle conspiracy *theory* became actual conspiracy. Wikileaks seems contra-conspiring conspirators using factual fictional conspiracies ammunition... really want able fairly separate plausible crackpot, need clear unambiguous statements nuanced, level headed discussions, going one-size-fits-all solution help either, especially operating ""how *we* deal *them*?""

The fact matter *real* market value unskilled labor much lower minimum wage, employers unskilled workers would set wages accordingly allowed to. Without government regulation, unskilled workers would choice accept poverty wages, even meant (just instance) sharing $1600 one-bedroom apartment five strangers, living three room, alternative would starvation homelessness. can't bargain they're easily replaceable, collective bargaining work scale entire class.  former Dell head honcho told difference American missing work Filipino missing work American might make little less money, usually not.

I liberal leftie. I'm Canadian living Germany. think communism actually kind cool idea. support welfare state, abortion, separation church state, high taxes rich. etc etc etc.

You literally peeing wind accusations, ending face. trust Chinese authority source virus... article *you* posted China lied/is lying Thank you. live work Minnesota, cases per 100k people much lower states. co-worker currently vacationing Florida, COVID hotbed. 

My employer requiring quarantine upon return. work logistics jobs considered essential, I'm angry sitting next someone return work 12 hours getting plane Florida. 

People organizations taking virus seriously there's much protect bad decisions people make. Whole family really sick December, coughing pink foam blood, wife still diminished lung function. Kinda like flu bone opposed joint pain. pulse ox states normal. wife went xrays feburary docs surprised walking pulse ox low.

Was slightly sick March altered sense smell/taste, weird fever/chills. Kids cold well. 

Later may broke rash. Kids slightly sick again. Rash lasted three days so. Kids complained itchiness well. 

Just really weird year. Rednecks, hillbillies. can't dorms safely. need independent HVAC, bathrooms, indoor dining--pretty much defines dorm. Well ok guess I've ""told"". Reported blocked Honestly guns could part that. Conservatives love say ""guns people, people kill people"" entirely neglect makes people kill people. think functioning society people driven crime, gun violence really issue. logic

Now define ""projection"".

There go. would good onion article dozens us! Dozens!  don’t see education would’ve stopped this. We’re dealing pathological narcissistic entitlement coupled complete lack impulse control. major players aim first deliveries autumn. usual delays, personally expect vaccine non-risk groups around early spring, perhaps late winter, goes exceptionally well.

The high US infection rates speed up. I'd say safe say one two hundred Americans produce antibodies coming two months. would translate 75 cases placebo group study, divided 1:1.
With current levels, could thousand people more. unfortunately, participants study likely much lower prevalence, neither deny ignore epidemic.

For generic chances vaccine, see ""Clinical Development Success Rates 2006-2015"".
But course, biggest risk factor immune reaction particular virus outside reach statistics. like bar scene scary movie denier took ventilator. That’s real tragedy. 25% COVID cases, 4.3% world’s population.

At point become criminal. know mostly spitballing, looks like random sample tests Mar-May Florida suggested 10 times many infected get found/reported.  


So ballpark Florida probably somewhere 20% actual infected now. average criminal unlikely trained knife wielding ninja. can't goddamn BB gun? compassion people bar. could gotten shot doubt would care guy going jailed AFTERWARDS shoot someone. 

If see issue going gun owners shot someone think ever find common ground fairness, right fat. change fact grossly unhealthy. Even right get obese, mean actively supported Oh great, go :-/ GBS swine flue wrecked immune system 10-11 years ago. 

2/10,would recommend. 14 different bags, would 14 separate IV lines. sick, patients survive amount support needed. would estimate covid ICU pts averaging 6-8 drips time. intubated patient, 3 almost always sedative, pain med, paralytic. going, blood pressure usually decreases (in congruence shock [septic, hypovolemic, and/ cardiogenic]) requires pressors maintain perfusion. Sepsis requires antibiotics infused. 

Due pathophysiology virus, people clot showering. Pts need antithrombitics prevent clotting another drip. Clotting thought increase risk strokes, lot acute renal failure requiring continuous dialysis, myocardial infractions related malperfusion. 

Uhmm, would say everyone tired burned out. know anesthesiologist RN hospital passed away treating disease. Lucky free 24/7 support local community psychologists/psychiatrists able aid emotional support. make easier, helps. Long term think everyone form PTSD require therapy. moment, lot put head down, power get shift. Taking proper precautions, nothing emergency. take time make sure PPE properly placed taken give greater chance continuing care allow health care workers give care greater amount people. wonder Trump send secret police stop violent criminals... hate second amendment? /s Yeah, like Norway opening Sweden, Denmark opening Sweden, Germany opening Sweden, France opening Sweden...  ""We knew getting into."" everyone else 40 morons came contact with, asshole? know getting into? behind though, going come new normal, first generation experience it, might better even. But... I'm hungry! Muh hot dogs beer worth risk! stay home. can't patriotic protect community weak fragile handle it, better stay home. Yeah sadly there's lot overlap people want eat dine restaurants people tip worst. 

I've gotten takeout couple times, I've trying tip extra. used waitress/bartender know struggle. friend's restaurant pooling tips, everyone's tip share right now. tips split hosts, bussers, servers. crazy Cool. town taking different approach shut playgrounds like health hazard. Seems like thing forgot put keep people going barb wire claymores ground. Anyways, washing hands great. concern kids play time. know kids put hands sorts places, including mouths eyes. I'm ""stuck"" WFH happier. much productive client I'm spending day week travelling site. Right wing? Oh, we're done first one now? 
Thank goodness. /s played 3 games. point basically impossible prescreen potential gun owners remove might problem someday.

The article says nothing shooter. know point *may had* certification training necessary.

""We need better screening certification"" really strange stance take point there's indication yet lack screening certification contributing cause here.

And potentially harmful stance take right now, turns guy *did* paperwork order, ""see, look, certification work there's reason waste time it"" becomes argument teeing side make.

Yes, need good controls place including training, disqualifying people criminal histories, etc.; saying ""this specific case would stopped let unqualified idiot gun first place"" dumb statement make staking integrity argument unknown. mean like person schooling age ten? Mine 3! not? Whats best flavor boot? Boot classic boot light? 

No! Vanilla boot lime!  yesterday black nazi group shot I'm Imagining roid raging anti masker told put mask tough set. Weights getting tossed clear across room, hurting someone course. expose people, look antibodies? point simply cut people modern medical care. 

Great news! hospitals almost full across southeast. Pretty soon, everyone cut modern medical care. think turn floridaman card become judge. What? No.. I'm absolutely shocked. could seen coming .. think it’s absurd too. many people street house putting risk working Chic Fil A. Nobody seems bat eye risking exposure far less $$$
The number people get work behind scenes sort make case it. money equal jobs. Advertising, production, sales, etc. FAAING Sure, go sports bars genetic allergy shot asshole control impulses. there's that. I'd bet singing different tune one ventilator. time virus infects, gets chance change itself(evolve) becomes harder deal with. Think bigger picture, selfish prick. Global covid deaths undercounted. Likely million already. another 6 months 1.3 million. We’re half way year.

US data 38k deaths 2018 due car crashes. Roads relatively safe here. annual deaths less covid 6 months. **Covid deaths least x6 worse car deaths US**.

Like said. ban smoking. That's ridiculous statement. Stop baby. wear mask watching movie riding roller coaster exercising, unless kind limp-wristed overly-sensitive panty-waste, case probably stay home forever. America definitely many financial pitfalls prey poor - high interest credit cards pay day loans market lower income demographics know they’re likely make money people inevitably unable pay back loan/credit interest rate debt insane, literally poor people stuck forever-monthly-payment loop. many people it’s choice faced financial stress. It’s awful system :( terrible know. wish done things differently country, providing funding families young kids, perhaps pay bills one caregiver stays home over. can't imagine single parents trying go alone. handled awful way dragging forever vaccines treatments discovered. No, people self control. Stop making excuses. ridiculous  Unfortunately, can't ""fat shaming"". Apparently okay point someone intensely overweight ""everyone beautiful"". Now, get wrong - I'm body positivity. fine line ""being positive body despite little overweight"" ""you can't say anything negative even I'm grossly obese"". obesity becomes serious health concern, think okay say ""hey, fat"" *admitted* shadow edits, -adding words clarification comment quickly kind cheap -You taken made harmless clarifying edit made comment afterthought.

You worst covid truther ever, LOL Well, full capacity. responsibilities. someone mental health issue, cops really best resource? No. That’s goes dozens things dump onto police often end poorly. Heart disease leading cause death US long time directly attributable cases obesity. Diabetes number 7 list. 

I don’t know anyone exact figure, obesity probably kills half million Americans every year, mention challenges, inability perform many physical activities.

The challenge people hard time threading needle fat shaming constructive advice. Also, people suffer obesity self-conscious number reasons, it’s easy interpret constructive advice attack.

The thing really aggravates see obese children. really wish considered child abuse overfeed small child point obesity. It’s much harder kids ever develop good habits parents don’t even know eat properly. normal. Antibodies go away relatively quickly, body ""t-cells"" learned make new antibodies ever infected again.

Some evidence still works decades later, obviously know sure.

Edit: clarification know effective t-cells long-term making antibodies Covid-19. They're effective may viruses. Hopefully, Covid-19 similar. Probably good chance tho. we're Intelligent enough listen advice !? explain different regular rifles pistols please. vaccine tracker NY Times claims 5 vaccines Phase 3 right now. true (and think NYT good enough source), people ever talking Oxford, Pfizer Moderna? Although long suspected it, knew certain Trump elected. tangentially related BLM protests,

Which take ""anything involving black person"" Schools America always pushed rug. Here’s truth situation. power don’t care problems rest us affects them. hadn’t caught virus, he’d still intransigent ass caught it. 

That’s Trump problem. seems carrier infects around without infecting himself. like viruses, everyone gets level sickness. say anything either way, assumption players seriously ill. We're aware virus due extensive testing. even article? fat bad health, period ""I open consider anything"" almost opposite saying impossible.

You funny weird little way. surprise absolutely NOBODY.

What expect would happen pro-sports teams? One player gets infected, entire team affected/exposed season gets filled postponed games teams forfeiting.

I would SURPRISED MLB actually finished shortened season year. judge Florida? northern thinking. Which, mean, wrong, neglects fact first guy gun nobody would injured madness this? think WANT massive death toll? want friends, coworkers, families die? wrong you? forget God damn sports focus making sure general public safe? 

Oh that's right sports make rich people rich that's that's important. think they're risking lives point, think significant portion US deaths due covid directly attributed Trump administration Boris good ideas, say Green. completely lacks ability actually follow them. seems think (and probably right) soundbite actually follow plan benefit already gotten popularity. always do. well..looks like masks work...we'll see shortly...only places left masks ""appear work""

yes, u may vote - 100. go it. I'm cheering on. try get far away people possible one two times sneezed public this. Bet wears mask instant recourse murderous violence people don’t get want fueled conservative political rhetoric. (Actually right wing, embraced thoroughly mainstream conservatives feels dishonest say it’s conservative thing now.)

These people don’t assert isn’t law, don’t like law.

Things going go smoothly Trump win. compare gun ranges gun stores though. 
I know got 20.000$ annual fees. Casinos example hold lot money every night rarely get stolen. 

One thing sell gun, another sell thousands guns cops knowing guns stolen. Way different process. 

If think security 2020 based tearing wall idea improvement safes, cameras, movement detectors etc. Perfect explanation worried getting COVID-19, started Chemo back January 6 month treatment... I'm really glad theses beat odds! glitch? lots masks sale imagery TV series. like one: Hollywood DMCA Precognitive Authority little known highly empowered agency. determined point distant future, high probability one quotes used literary work, movie, one infinite number monkeys. 

However, time, Hollywood pretty much closed due Coronavirus resources needed elsewhere. Sorry, didn’t feel need throw around words already lost meaning.

Nowhere condone violence, clearly deranged individual behind bars, wasn’t pre-planned terrorist attack IMO. Hopefully drop charges entirely well court date. story repeated again.  I’ve heard 6 times last week.  it’s always “my cousin’s roommate”. I’m honestly opinion Americans can’t cope losing battle something. clearest explanation continuing eff royally. 

It’s like listening loser hometown, everyone knows loser, brag awesome life it. “With absolute abundance caution, taking step,"" added Lauer. “ quote article suspended season ONE WEEK. 

Not playing sports pandemic cautious. know, I’m coach. I'm American. You..weren't required wear face masks till today? cornered, 1st option, mile, run away. Oh sweet satanic child... virus detected Spain's sewage far back March 2019, local transmission happening lot places around world late-2019. Even wasn''t case, blaming authorities able contain 99% governments Earth could contain, case US/UK even try contain (either Swine Flu pandemic) silly.

I think that's admirable way look it. could certainly use people coming together help whatever way able. happens. Good point State vs. Federal funding. suppose rephrase original statement underpinned belief (again strong objective data, provide insight would appreciate it) schools, despite funding source, still strapped fighting budgetary limitations due property taxes respective locality. 

This turn results inability operate effectively without federal assistance. result relationship, disobey guidance Federal authority would almost certainly mean budgetary strain disobedient districts. would almost certainly result immediate slashing certain programs, likely Art Music always seems first get chopped. 

Although, severe enough imagine could also eliminate heavily impact school lunch subsidies poor.

My comments getting blocked using word starts 'Cap' end 'ism', even spelling presidents name. 

Like Mods, knock fuck off, pandemic inherently political, stop trying police comments. Surpassed number living normal lives  mean Darwinist generational natural selection. Meant: probability relative intelligence quotient increase. Reminds video watches young kids japan hard core airsoft guns. gun instructors texas invited come shoot guns. Kid drills get go. Airsoft skills translated really well him. proper technique safety habits too. Yeah, season probably get called soon enough. One thing never seem hear stuff symptoms. everyone asymptomatic actually getting sick? going go naive reddit consensus overcome bad ideologies ""beating free market ideas"" stuff really work, think anyone actually believes remove spread conspiracy theories beating prominent conspiracy theorists debate discussion ever actually tried before. Seriously, matter say conspiracy theorist knee deep ideological positions, positions founded pathology, debate pathology.


Realistically thing unfortunately deplatform prominent conspiracy theorists. can't make renounce beliefs debate, removing potential audience ensuring screaming void best alternative. point yo protect people, even matter? feel like matter first months school year going go badly get everyone understand need continue social distance wear mask.

Still voting blue straight ticket, know true. ""We positive synthetic intelligence would develop champion trial fight coronavirus deserted pretense concern second curve appeared flatten April Might. let guard down.""

I pray true. video truely don’t understand man come attacking woman instructions wear mask. Insanity mixed ego capturing mindset people seems. Exactly. want suspected sick. white people know handle rejection. throw tantrums lol.

This karma times establishments created clothing policies exclude minorities. sure, America likely killed gun ever use home defense. America constitution gives individuals express right freedom display complete lack brains logic entire world, without fear reprisal. needs kids... guarantee nimrod super spreaders read covid 19 Reddit. busy connecting. safe public playgrounds one else there? Taking Moderna vaccine part clinical trial excludes taking part COVID vaccine clinical trial - exclude getting different vaccine later. ALWAYS drop clinical trial. ask primary care physician way know sure things concerned diagnostic tests. 

But asking think see doctor, yes do. used handful trolls around would get triggered teleworking mandates Since masks become political, I'd call political motive. nit pick well?  Right, since patrons can’t carry, fall establishment ensure protection use armed employees posted entryways. Yup believe use ressources hand. you!

Wouldn't want leave hanging!

The FHM strategy day one protect elderly flatten curve (not overwhelm hospitals)

It failed first beginning seem worked well other

Just give ping if/when forget remind you. ;) someone message ""so going hang out"" straight answered ""after pandemic"". Like people get it. America tolerating. Ohhh. headline says lol. bad I’m dumb dumb.  bother, arguing moron, guy probably thinks words violence purple man buns look good. doubt it. likely virus found way human activity goes unnoticed flares becomes noticed. Protests outside people wear masks. Parties, however, usually inside outside, people literally dont wear masks party. Theres clear difference. Honestly view it’s *want* think meanly others. funny, lot get huffy challenged masks say they’re bad people wearing them. everyone else either outright liar, falsifying tests, conspiring mess election, sheep according them. 

I hate story week ago started appearing everywhere, along “knowing” nurse decided send swab dipped water see results got. Wow, either lot people know nurse people left testing center they’re full shit. Also, gun works well. Well, \*are\* winners here. Gotta show Lafayette ;) Former Pentacostal Christian here. pure insanity. would explain thats Youtube for. never understood early scientists medical experts saying wear one, early weeks could made huge difference Stay mad, CCP handled infinitely better US UK puppet handled COVID Swine Flu outbreak. think confused. say terrorism? here, go get sick care, four months still want act like selfish asshole, shouldn’t take spot hospital. German gun range brought exact topic. told would easy target thieves. Imagine criminal organisation steeling 250 guns ammo ""Sportschützenverein München e.v."" night. 
Cant happen, wont happen many teams hot zones  people deserve actual Darwin awards young people didn’t kids. Ouch, hurts right Ripken  alma mater list rules students follow, including staggered move dates, face masks public, big groups, etc. However, also campus known two neighborhoods filled parties weekends. kids threw massive party streets told social distance months ago got ready go home. kids lighting couches fire celebrate St. Patrick's Day, see going along rules whole semester. Same. Never ashamed country. peak ignorance wasnt friends family would seriously consider leaving. “very large percent serious lifelong damage” ridiculous probably fearmongering claim.  


Oh ? really wish honest. Fine, go :

Another Wuhan published January found 12% Covid-19 patients showed signs cardiovascular damage. studies since found evidence myocarditis, inflammation heart muscle cause scarring, heart failure Covid-19 also found evidence scarring Covid-19 patients' lungs. According Parshley, CT scans show Covid-19 patients light gray patches lungs called ""ground-glass opacities,"" always heal. One Chinese study found patches 77% patients, Parshley reports.  soon tell whether lung damage Covid-19 patients permanent, shows one third survivors similar coronaviruses SARS MERS long-term lung damage.  disease new, absolutely foolish go recent findings blindly assume long term complication rates minor. Btw. highly infectious disease, 12% absolutely massive coems long term damage (and thats one organ, roll dice organs). even concerns arent widely known hadnt picked scientists months ago, dont know why'd even argue this, unless use dubious sources form opinions.

People rather want walk side caution, disease better understood, regardless, current findings taken serious case.Fact is, dont know anything right now, stop spreading misinformation new disease, way properly understanding instead follow health scientists discover step step. Currently everything points towards high likelyhood lasting damages. showing claiming conservatives Nazi tendencies straying reality. 

Also, three dudes wanna wear masks bring assault rifle club retaliation? Safe say, they're conservatives.

If US getting banned countries president, anti science, Nazi sympathizer, done piss poor job leading pandemic, maintain supporters ones banned travel. serious risk, need isolate bubble vaccine arrives.

It kills one 10,000 healthy people 50. 

My life staying paused longer, I'm sorry seems selfish. makes sense cases can't grow forever. Even herd immunity, certain percentage people use masks/social distancing/stay home, etc.

We're still good spot though cases plateued high.

I also wonder issue states testing overwhelmed?

My supervisors son throwing last week, doctor told get covid test...and didn't. boss sick week...went ER...and test.

I know sub reads LOT numbers, likely tens thousands cases counted day. bodes well herd immunity too. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Since cant disarm whole populace since always illegal weapons means guns regulated arent easy get regular check ups monitor mental health gun owners. whole world change nothing happens loved one. think everyone else selfish! LOL Good option. tech industry, liking WFH option. hope companies allow permanent WFH jobs. would guess probably 1%. Theyre going total immunity lawsuits arising negligent behavior surrounding COVID. giant win corporations usual Fuck working Americans reminder government legal systems pretty much bad joke healthy 24 year-old fairly fit gets plenty sunlight (vitamin D). getting it. chances dying Covid virtually nil. 

I anti-vaccine, vaccine rushed doubt likely wait little. 

It everyone individually asses risk/health make educated decisions based medical information.

EDITING SOURCE: often take decades develop slowly asses extrinsic toxicity them. think we're gonna make end month MLB still playing. Obviously saw opportunity lower capacity /s team Florida places. shocker! 

Should done bubble. MLB farce. want move Canada one shooting place. USA basically wartorn country. put blame people pandemic - fat government failed response. Donner party tactics

Cannibalism? military loses guns time dude  Fuck, man... thought Missouri's UI trash barely giving people $200 week... ""shithole country"" keep mom bubble. So, 81 bum valve makes expendable eh? big loss, she’s death’s door anyways! Half women family live centenarians, surely years can’t worth living, let’a go bar spit other’s faces. went far forced sarcasm.

EDIT: spelling Canada last time surgery hospital 6 days. cost $40 parking upset that. vaccine group reaches primary end point end trial duration, minimal grade 3 4 adverse events, vaccine could approved early use general public. clinical trial still continue long-term follow - 25 months. quite lot clinical trials work. nothing new. think we've got better treating it. 88% patients put ventilators NY died. new virus woefully bad treating it.

You figure 88% state hit hardest. NY 1/5 total deaths.

Like, could knock rate car wrecks made everyone stop driving cars. Faculty member here, know schools declare financial exigency (in case state unis) state board regents allows, tenured profs fired. happened U Alaska recently, example (pre covid). Everybody know would rather risk risk illness/death/becoming community vector. 

However, clear, point board declaring financial exigency, tenure offer protection early phases layoffs. school know worst situation right now, 10% faculty laid rest put partial furloughs, laid “term faculty” (non tenured, one-year contracts). Logistically simply easier start term faculty since job contracts need legally voided.

My school little unusual use 3 year contracts even term faculty. pushing accelerated retirement right now. New, research-active TT track (not yet tenured, tenure-track) probably best position since universally cheaper salaries tenured faculty, yet also actively pursuing grant funds. Oddly, uni haven’t even cut lab startup funds (I $225,000 promised lab startup amazingly they’re touching it) - probably since know would sharply reduce probability grant success.

 Anyway, we’re braced mix furloughs, layoffs, early retirements, increased teaching load &amp; increased grant expectations.

Now I'm paying terrible price I'm depressed I've ever 4,000 federal employees seeking disability compensation grounds contracted novel coronavirus work, survivors 60 deceased employees seeking death benefits reason.

The total number claims expected increase 6,000 within weeks, according report amounts one first accountings pandemic’s impact health federal workforce.

The report Labor Department’s inspector general assessed coronavirus-related trends workers’ compensation programs including Federal Employees’ Compensation Act, covers 2.1 million employees executive branch departments agencies plus 630,000 employees semi-independent U.S. Postal Service.

Last year FECA program paid $3 billion benefits 200,000 people, mainly compensate lost wages employees unable work — temporarily permanently — work-related injury illness. also pays medical rehabilitation services well death benefits survivors.


The report said soon pandemic declared March, FECA program took several steps prepare coronavirus-related claims, including designate occupations law enforcement, first responders, front-line medical public health personnel highest risk contracting virus work.

For occupations, program “will accept exposure COVID-19 proximately caused nature employment require medical evidence establishes diagnosis COVID-19, positive COVID-19 test result,” said. types positions must show disease employment-related, type injury illness claim.

Employees three departments high concentrations jobs deemed carry highest risk exposure — Homeland Security, Justice Veterans Affairs — accounted 4,011 claims filed July 23.


Of those, 1,623 granted, fewer seven denied, 25 withdrawn rest waiting adjudicated — including death claims — according data provided Labor Department current inspector general report.
The government keep central count many federal employees remained regular workplaces pandemic vs, working remotely paid leave.

However, number types positions FECA program deems high-risk would hundreds thousands, even excluding Postal Service, relatively jobs lend telework.

Nor central count numbers infections deaths among federal employees. However, reports largest agencies show nearly 19,000 infections nearly 100 deaths, figures continuing rise.

Plus, know fantasy comes from, life Hollywood thriller movie. People break houses looking rape and/or violate anyone find. break *steal shit* *get out* without caught. probably much likely get rid burglar making noise conveying presence way - *especially* they're armed.

And danger family's well-being... well, number burglaries Germany [has halved 2015 167,136 87,145. find statistics many remaining burglaries resulted bodily harm anyone, *do* excerpt [the Federal Criminal Police's 2019 statistics | Total Number Recorded Cases 2019

Sexual harrassment and/or rape lethal consequence | 2
Robbery lethal consequence | 1
Burglary lethal consequence | 1
General Assault/Battery lethal consequence | 78

Keep mind data points include instances happen burglaries.

And, particular discussion, perhaps two important statistical points:

Crime | Total Number Recorded Cases 2019
-----|--------------------------------------
General Burglary | 87,145
General Burglary involvement and/or threat and/or discharge firearms | seen columns 3, 5, 6, almost half burglaries mere *attempts* even succeed - still distinct cases succeeded, later caught, amounts another 17.4% total cases. one third burglaries actually, like, *works*.

So 100lb female large male breaks house, *hide*, *call police*, *wait* either leave apprehended police. *astonishingly* unlikely harm going come you. Ah right are, actually 96.4 percent people aged 60-69 years old.

I know all, last months productive ever. Used PF member. Peloton, dumbbells, resistance bands home.

“Six medical experts felt confident sending kids back.” Maybe opinion 21 millions HUGE number. fact total active mobile phone accounts China 1.6 BILLION December 2019, 1.14 phone number per capita. 

When epidemic outbroke people stayed away jobs home, found spare phone number(with data/phonecall packages) waste money, cancelled spare phone number.

Remember 21 million 1.3% total 1.6 billion mobile phone numbers. FIT NARRATIVE LET FIGURE WRONG choose take word sure... I'm willing bet daily cases way higher willing admit. think that’s bubbles work Yeah alot ones arrest people team. all, definitely way tolerated. It’s $400 plus normal unemployment plus $1200 check depending child bonus may add $600 week top that. Typical. Employees expected enforce mask policy, means deal insane response pyschos, corporations punish employees cover asses. constitutional ""right"" infringed pant wearing requirement, seat belt requirement, forth. words, none. 
I'd argue mask wearing requirement less intrusion pant wearing requirement, one going wind respirator wear pants. 😉 Don’t mislead, huge profit company, cynical thinks saw much saving people office thought way make COVID another 3% margins I’d hate one volunteers received placebo. This. Effing Mardi Gras gave us surge start like NYC experienced. effing tourists Texas Florida bring numbers more. Wait? bigger news is?

It's huge, no? knew possible, seems become certainty Oh yeah, forgot that. eating though? takeaway count too? tell political structure world makes perfect pandemic response plan, managed keep virus contained. Every single country case growing starting 0.

IT UNKNOWN TIME. acknowledge limitation human beings. think reddit discussions often fail people know Germany US completely different justice systems way much authority judge has, much interpret text law little bound preceeding rulings similar cases.

There's actual science behind far know divide countries world mostly German-style law vs British (US?)-style law. leadership. Bravo.  denied medical care, put list last ventilators hospital beds. people making $600 like earning $40K annually begin with. lot jobs like restaurants/retail need reduced staffs since can’t go capacity right now. Obviously doc pocket Big Kale. Go literally news video mentioning covid read comments. Absolutely filled brim denial links sketchy ""debunking"" videos.  No. verified reinfections. cases people testing negative testing positive again, 1) PCR tests not-small % false negatives, 2) body continues shed RNA infection- still infectious shedding. makes continue test positive. meant say actual case count least 10X reported. Edited comment make clear. studies estimate much 20x counted, especially since testing disaster US. 

The deaths numbers certainly concerning, virus like sweeping unprecedented rate accurate numbers chart it, real CFR vs. flu? many people actually get flu year vs covid? Since there's COVID vaccine immunity population, maybe simply affecting people flu usually once. Still points huge problem though, deaths deaths gotten better handle back February, March, April... basically late, think we're even capable turning back now. 

It's want take seriously extent necessary, I'm feeling crappy literally one handled well beginning information moving target. Everything's gone shit little payoff, there's much light end tunnel, clear path forward economy continues burning ground. got north Korea vaccine, 2 shots good. 

No infections there. Clearly learn something despite much larger population, much higher population density increased global travel, covid 19 nowhere near deadly spanish flu.  keeping pumping fear.  allowed guns ever again

he shot sports bar assault rifle full... allowed walk free ever Dude probably ARM mortgage. brothers gf one first house money put couldn’t prove income high actually (bartender claiming tips) that’s got mortgage. jumped 2008ish almost lost house. say it’s false choice regardless. Look Spain, Vietnam, Hong Kong, China like 3 different times, Australia, US south, Japan, Belgium... could go on. Even *with* insane restrictrions, virus *still* spreads people *still* die regardless. It’s best take 99.5% population hahahahaha CDC supporting school openings drastically rolling back quarantine length return work testing seems signal end corona virus US. believe people transmit inner worthlessness, well existential danger present ones love. So, no. folk need desire speak with. know enough public speech/actions. Done.

If lasts long time Trump probably joke annals history. Like England king pretended dog such. joke, impact people time largely forgotten.

If US falls soon however, think Trump big character history books person destroyed global trust US. real impact Trump going show years. companies realizing single political office fuck decades work go somewhere else materials selling goods. Haha, nice.

Queue Captain America: ""I understood reference."" :) Suffocating test capacity makes test positivity rate go since motivated still try complete test. want make test positivity go down, broaden testing testing essential workers every week require testing anyone visiting state. way, rack bunch easy negatives balance positives. understand even point talk shit China. Yeah course gonna perfect, even CDC said actual case US might 6-24 times higher.

Why wanna TRULY know good/bad internally taking quarter total confirmed cases entire fucking world?

Fucking embarrassing it? true see tame compared fall. That's worry. Oh, please elaborate.

This good... *&lt;gets uuuuugh, politicization basic matters health safety science going downfall US society. every COVID denier planet suddenly developed understanding exactly science works they're unanimously favor actually something, pandemic would airtight lid within month.

Here's idea, anti-science side already using: propaganda. Cover buildings, buses, mass transit, websites, maybe even TV science. Show people exactly scientists saying, exactly came conclusion. Make science - conclusions underlying process data - come people actively, might able convert people. Conspiracy theorists might lost cause, mainstream believes whatever Trump says want think dig actively might convinced. Heck, even Fox starting move pro-science we-have-the-data side. thought terrifying...  lol that's exactly did. I'll go back give comment due. problem argument anything suggest *yet* (at least evidence yet). possible, see evidence tampering go data says. fatigue social distancing emerging major challenge curbing pandemic eighth month. That’s especially among young adults less fearful coronavirus, suffer greater economic social costs stay Japan Spain U.S., infections among millennials Generation Z driving new waves cases don’t seem abating despite re-imposed restrictions. worrying trend reflects social distancing curbs proving untenable long period, despite initial efficacy flattening virus curve across world earlier year. question whether Russia compromised good majority American government, obvious Trump. question deeply infiltrated government going need done fix it. :( instead ""president"" still using MAGA campaign slogan. Like WTF last 3 years think America's great again, yet?! /r/unexpectedoffice question here. everyone outside entire time, inside hours that's spread. wearing masks all?

Again Meh. lived Austin 6 years. There's cool stuff nothing worth staying for. state I've people constantly remind awesome is. Texas pride shit looks pretty dumb now. Early testing federal government. FDA prevented individual states trying start testing programs, CDC failed attempt get testing started. IIRC WA local flu study forced stop Covid testing like February.

The lack testing snowballed problems. help president dumbass spent whole time telling Americans coronavirus would ""go away"" own... Pretty good indicator federal government priorities early on. Polls show people support Medicare All. actually think issues like effect everyone added question people vote on. States things, least Virginia experience. clear medical industry profit business donates campaign politicians influences vote (which illegal). really study this? mean people still going refuse wear cause know Dr faUcI cAuSe PanDeMiC. often say I'm proud live NJ, I'm proud state, people especially Murphy acting way pandemic. Hes made mistakes sure, things would lot worse acted differently. I'm surprised question needed 

Well honestly ball court USA.

Well, yes going bad. worries Wait, article also BNO newsroom... saying giving two different kinds news this?   Damn already 5000? Shut Well White House say can't listen science anymore... Well, let's see can't google question find answers top result ""sweden like they're far worst Nordic nation, one highest death rates (per capita) European nation.

The kind person creates example obvious mental gymnastics, also kind person overlooks Covid vascular disease. wouldn’t expect good faith response user brainstorming scenarios attempt disprove imperial data. Republicans ones rioting large public gatherings people wear masks one social distancing months end. Sure dude keep posting conspiracy coronahoax that's sure mark intelligence. sources claim millions sick tens thousands dead, OP claimed. yeah system designed slow change like wouldnt happen overnight. overtime chipped away took getting one pos like trump office ruin That’s cute think numbers put online accurate   China's concentration camps much worse People probably want get sucked debate guy post history. Multiple research articles shown overwhelmingly R wear masks far less often think (wrongly) aren’t effective, FAR likely think it’s hoax 5G shit. 

Here’s thing - comment isn’t fueling anything. It’s descriptive based upon facts. leader country politicized freaking deadly virus politicized opening schools even unsafe places (which like 95% places use guidelines anywhere Europe Asia).

Absolutely one would argue people absolutely nuts bonkers crazy now. People shooting others asked wear mask, people pulling others’ masks spitting them, people pissing store floors asked wear mask. 

Here two references, many aiming something people may already encountered felt. great Patriot Act bookmark-able event decade 2014. far damage planes currently still alighting fires. Nah. U.S. voters really short memories. pandemic already old news people. still old news even death rate quintuples. limited time period people care things almost never exceeds months

Counter example, whatever reason Benghazi. obviously know live, barely know country. Different regions Mexico act differently. course anything obtained, difficulty levels vary. Man, come on. Dude shared fucking Vanity Fair article New Republic left publication known clickbaity headlines. 

These kind headlines exaggerate alienate large groups people exactly less reaction Trump actually something bad. extreme right won. Good luck. 100,000 people rally Brooklyn, hot spot, 0 social distancing.

Gen X: Please. Masks. That’s I’m saying. even one grifter buddies owned mask factory instead hydroxychloroquine factory stood national TV advice CDC pushed masks ""what lose"" attitude. dumb fuck followers would hopped onto bandwagon we'd 100K less deaths now.  clean store work at, mobbed. even stay I'm cleaning it. playing around without masks on, even washing hands. eating, talking phone, playing hair makeup. know hell wrong people. Thanks China... government hiding data you, they're reporting WHO, do. mother law waited 11 days without result test. second one going 5 days without result.

This husband tested positive 6 day wait he's fucking 70.

Oh wife tested exact time got results back 3 days.

Florida 100% holding back results. sister ultra-cautious, bad thing. Apt comparison, Manson wanted like rock star, fame privilege without putting honest work. spent time babbling greatness without contributing anything meaningful world. go woods   don’t test know needs self isolate, contract trace clusters developing. Testing big part control results managed well, test don’t anything results change behaviours seeing areas loses it’s value. 10+ hours day, 5 days week, job. take lunch, that's it, really.

It recover then, flooded global warming time. 

If right hurricane hits slow motion end Florida society. Reagan segregation till 50s, Vietnam War, Cold War McCarthyism, Nixon... exactly ""eroding"" from? I’m disappointed nobody responded comment there’s lot people talking shit comments like yours, reasonable informed critiques. It’s hard tell difference people completely brainwashed, propaganda, stupid. Ever heard quote, ""It mark educated mind able entertain thought without accepting it.""? withdrawn (due political pressure) mean debunked true. Yea, looks like fool. I've seen lot people moving 'driving riding car dangerous Covid!'

Which infuriates me, like, *yes, KNOW, stoplights speed limits seatbelts safety standards and...*

And they'll handwave like I'm one ridiculous. hospital difficult explain ""freedom""-loving western worlds indulge chaotic anarchy mindset measures authrotiy ""evil"" mind, condemning masks 5G that

in werid sense, things like Xi Putin who's reign lasted longer 4-5 years may terrible idea circumstances like now, least knwo leader anything short-sighted extremly diversive, sometimes even undermine succesor political reasons deserve I'm gonna take wild guess assume democrats ones walking around parades holding Nazi Confederate flags... Influenzers... said like they're far worst Nordic nation, one highest death rates (per capita) European nation.

So, summary: lot people think, still dead bodies per capita almost EU nation. Yeah, screw XPS laptop ad I’m never buying one ad ridden website. debate numbers death numbers inflated (a worthless argument, ask me); people straight deny existence virus damn minds. can’t fathom disconnected reality. OMG! world going end! providing numbers consistently buy failed one day! Outrageous!

""bUt CoUnTrIes DiDnT fAiL!""

Maybe because

1) large population US.

2) sunday.

3) Checks Balances place ensure accurate reporting.  can, it’s called electing failed business man/tv “personality” run country.  Nothing good. really like website, impossible truly measure recklessly incompetent administration been.

We finally sort action march, absolutely terrible far late, rolled everything back weeks later ""reopen, reopen"", ""no masks"" maybe 6 entire months initial outbreak beginning somewhat come confused consensus wearing masks bare minimum save lives.

To ""how many deaths Trump responsible delaying action 2 months?"" -- answer **all them**. long March, 2020. Yup So, meaningless death people believe danger virus, extra meaningless death type idiots... wonder end 2020 going look like America. Sure, knock out: 

[Senior Official dodges questions Taiwan’s membership: praises  full rationale here: particular, pay attention contribute high-quality information. require users submit reliable, fact-based information subreddit (as opposed opinion articles, advocacy, etc), provide English translation article comments. many places online discuss conspiracies speculate. ask here.

Unless want FFA forum, line needs drawn somewhere limit scope discourse. Compared /r/COVID19 (science-only sub), sub actually pretty lenient.  point believe trying make intent difficult prove therefore be, been, utilized scapegoat Sounds like regional thing... Cause, though know could get anything here, I'd go ""outside pharmacies"" suggesting.. even trust similares... kn95s get posted lot know close n95. Florida Medical Examiners Commision always provided information deaths Florida. get data sent every coroner provide public. source track things like people died hurriance.

Their death count higher death count provided department health (The official covid news article broke, Florida's response hide data hard find historical news articles want talk bad currently doing.

Important things know comes start whole ordeal. 99% impression happened. historical desire suppress, believe still underway much get away with.

Florida previously report anyone resident (We tons ""seasonal"" residents winter. ) official numbers. currently report resident non-residents (just separately)

They also accurately report testing backlog, report pending tests state, 99% testing Florida comes private greater 7 day backlog tests, numbers see reported cases week ago.

Florida also 7,300 excess deaths (Compared historically previous years) March 15th till July 11th. puts numbers least 20% behind true numbers, especially take account historically less deaths clear Florida's numbers, terrible are, entirely accurate, show full picture, Desantis strong history expressing data much possible. Good news rarely ever posted subreddit even good news, receive much attention compared posts negative nature. kinda shows people love dwell misery, comment section alone proves it. comment section posts? Go figure. Even way COVID-19, there's lot good reasons believe life hard painful. Times much harder now, would nice took break negative look good stuff life instead always whining bitching bad stuff.

Just grateful life people. Like seriously. whole subreddit could use POSITIVE attitude adjustment. Making America Great alright. /s kind shovel have? I've got bush need get rid yard one used dig hole burying head clearly top tier caught shit going parties starting April. xD

but city state live (Corpus Christi TX) become one hottest hot zones ... knowing everything possibly avoid catching COVID spreading ... sleep soooooo well night O:-) Extreme corruption paired extreme incompetence extraordinary bad things. hope retarded think name organization determines inherent value. like ""we X great."" things here, covid still ran course.

You know know, unfortunately. countermeasures NYC used effective? another Earth compare to. But, pretty likely situation would much worse people followed guidelines. Sure, make situation go away entirely, definitely helped. woah woah, i'm fox news fans means say CNN unbiased left leaning ridiculous. networks main constituents ratings drivers stick drives ratings. need intellectually honest here. want ""unbiased"" news better going places like reuters, bbc, bloomberg, NPR avoiding CNN Fox News. Tbh you’re going get quality learning year period. option viable one option much better chance keeping majority students, families, staff, communities safe. scientists based opinions DATA PROVIDED WOMAN. absolutely independent data source. course scientists would reach conclusion. nothing hide, let independent investigators look database see whether there's virus studied similar coronavirus? again, reports files deleted database. ther would need forensic engineer well. 

Short that, call non-believer. want fun google Zerg rush, results pretty funny. dunno still works though. That's entire point actually. entire country split political party speaker theoretical, half retarded intentionally malicious ""others"". lot time, ""others"" are, blatantly breaking law, refusing take action real issues, taking actions help take advantage victims/little guy (who obviously must be), inherently unqualified, undeniably corrupt, blatant sex offenders, serving rich (not you, obviously), actively opposing greater good. matter party in. get fed bullshit.

I'm Democrat. got emails AOC campaign trying fundraise while. idea why. live NY state. emails said donors side super pac's average donor donated $18, super low number like that, help grassroots campaign beat super pac's. unknown reason, also get dozens emails week trump campaign. emails say donors side mostly super pac's, average donation campaign $18 super low amount, help grassroots campaign beat super pac's. 

They cant right, right? Unless they're both, something sketchy like, know, showing mode instead mean represent ""average"", skimming highest donors giving. average $18 would mean trump got 22 million donations 2016 (~15% population). significant portion less $18, since that's average work. Hillary would needed twice (~30%, spent LOT more). However, get emails her, can't say claims were.

The actual problem happening sides entire time. saying things, would lie, political parties organizations donate millions them. point fingers other, creating division, saying look bad ""they"" are. could ""we"" let happen? parties claim rational one must crazy liars, news watch tells trust liar.  remember reading data Bernie's book, sad data never gained attention general public politician would really want solve problems.

 Haha, yes, true virus slow mutate. all, already pretty well-adapted infect humans begin with. 5-14 day incubation period high transmissibility, damn good job thriving. still evolving though, within realm possibility could hone make things worse already dire situation (like, say, increase incubation period, lengthening damage tissues).

fuck em! even ask question like that? kind person you? beautiful answer many Information. Thank time precious piece. detained without reason detention stated, meantime detained time (48 hours max) expedient reason arrest stated time. arrested probable cause. 

The Federal agents identifying information shoulders. *Devenpeck v. Alford*, U.S. Supreme Court explained although certainly ""good police practice"" let suspect know reason arrest taken custody, constitutional requirement so.”

Again, kind lawyer you?

If actual lawyer would know cases determine laws put practice, pure wording law doesn’t necessarily mean that’s it’s used. think someone believes something strongly enough actively recommend people activists, something tangible point say ""this model want society move toward"". Otherwise, they're seeking attention validation audience worth shit. 


Edit: Downvotes going garner sympathy cause. I've always said, ""Everybody get turn"". remember California singing praise. Texas talked low numbers. Theres nothing stop it, slow it. I'm curious bad get US govt finally throws hands air declares ""well, we're gonna let coronavirus burn we've tried absolutely nothing nothing getting better"" Americans barred every country world except Brazil lax pandemic response. Possibly. It’s hard say depends person working really. husband author always working home. He’s actually hated others works like editors publishing types home want ton zoom calls meetings deems unnecessary cut established routine. 

Myself hand could never work home. Mostly work special education need students. I’m England schools open key workers children never fully worked home wasn’t full time expected admin type stuff home. I’m absolutely shit wfh. 

I think depends person could maybe cut office staff self motivated, able avoid distractions willing. awesome resource thank 👍 next day! Outsourcing already easy, problem talent available elsewhere. common way rich US born wealth. So, EVERY rich person starts way, majority do. I'm saying never happens, rare utter bullshit see Americans questioning, ""but home invasion?"".

Fridays Matter! /s Absolutely true. \^ wife went grocery store yesterday came home tears maskless man invaded space politely asked could get way, snapped, ""Why? mask works, it!"" friend 20 years posting anti-mask memes facebook privately messaged wrote ""I know attack somebody wearing mask, empowering posts."" friend wrote back effect wife getting info 'news' friend done research stop spreading truth wife unfollow her. devastated casual friendship. friend's side husband died.It's amazing politicians divide us all. actually ok roll back quarantine time 14 10 days. think 14 good starting point. amount time learn length required recover 10 probably appropriate time span. people gonna hop hospital beds 10 days go work CDC reduced quarantine time. mostly effects received positive test home self-quarantining. fuck wrong you???? It’s true know :) ‘Just let kids play football instead’

This basically dooms NFL season well, since similar approach lined (except even higher risk since there's way players NFL team wanted fans stands). definitely feel people trying, it’s pleasant, yeah, there’s lot space user error. supposed sort competition? someone wants TV. cute. metrics, specifically? 
 
There currently tens thousands backlogged tests waiting processed. don’t know metrics would saying it’s receding fast.  thinking day that, day age, would probably sue make millions, still get about... Yeah luckily boss leaves us whether work home. think 90% office working home point. go groceries middle afternoon otherwise stay home. Hope traditional/old fashioned bosses adapt allow well. Someone tell Alberta. Save us Enforce though? police rampant right now, besides entire police forces argued refuse enforce mask mandate.

I agree needs enforced need figure interesting trifecta obsessions. That's all.

Edit: 2200 cases 2019 government report I’ve read they’ve trying phase 24/7 stores late extended hours stores time, pandemic made lot easier (understandably). It’s bummer, there’s nothing quite great getting called saying don’t come work overnight shift Waffle House, going explore Walmart night. 

I don’t believe open overnights pandemic, don’t think shift back ): it’s worth keep doors open night imply get far less gave even disingenuous. Oh, guess realize taxpayers got unemployment boost. Lol nah. NHL managed fumble anything yet. 

Turns country league take things seriously sports continue. Well Eric Topol Fauci saying another thing Interesting, considered that. might willing take pay cut TBH. I've saved lot gas takeout (sure could pack lunch requires forethought planning skills quite developed yet). Sure, never disputed that. bullshit. person getting paid job. anything, reduce company costs everything rent reduction, wear tear building, office supplies, office cleaning, cutting middle management who's job tow office line... etc. Love see raise people working home using resources jobs. yeap Ikr, Mr. Governor. gave fk virus anyway Assuming went got infected came home you, risk infecting 27.8%, look intra-family infection rates Table 5 ( Family Secondary Attack Rate, spousal) better go alone risk getting infected take 1/3 chance infecting go take risk. Take care. I'm interested insistence supply versus demand low class labor. simply implies labor indeed need paid less since essentially many positions redundant best. seems counterproductive reward redundant non-earning positions increased pay. understand living wage argument comes pulling society's capital appears worst low skilled labor workers ones benefiting increased minimum wage, rest see wages either lose value (via inflation pricing changes) remain same. Yeah everybody America fat hell. lost fifteen pounds moving different country, make conscious changes apparently started living way healthier lifestyle. knife? bat? violence terrorism? something I’ve seen change lifetime. still possible made fun skinny kid, people assumed poor couldn’t get enough eat. Even high school, really almost one fat. even little bit chubby side. could probably easily studied high school yearbooks, probably been. Obesity people age 18, age, truly rare human history.

 read theory people partly react badly overweight people, part instinctual brain recognizes disease, modern way think obesity disease, something like plague. natural state man include extreme obesity, thing minds prepared it. honest, also benefits company health employees. Making decisions like puts drivers seat allow plan ahead company provide stability. Anti-maskers ruined sports 2020. Let's get shit trending. Even NBA NHL workout bubble, ruined baseball, college sports &amp; likely NFL. states they, example, review death certificates Sunday, every days, database simply get updated. Tomorrow again. add this, Florida’s positive percentage rate ridiculous could said argue contrary. None things actually done lol. shutdowns lasted maybe 3 weeks everything started reopening, states getting hit hardest now, excluding California, didnt take seriously all.

Also post joke look every country control. Toronto, city 8 million people, 20 cases today, 6 Miami marlins baseball team. damn right. know someone there! Put damn masks people!!!

What memory forget walking stairs go kitchen sitting last step thinking possibly walk further. know long sat/laid stairs energy walk, felt like legs possibly support me. anyone reading Florida? I'm curious mask wearing numbers look like now. drop reflect people wearing masks?

I'm southern Maine cases low still, aside grumbling outliers, mask wearing stores area close 98%. (Based unscientific survey asking managers cashiers trends they're seeing.) Oh agree, don’t believe senior management share ethics general described life, never time put words I'm lawyer. would surprised action try protect another person would somehow covered law would take precedence employers ""*run lives!!!*"" policy. fact also eroded learning institutions heading online. What’s difference Harvard Coursera Fall streamed? Governor Abbot Governor DeathSentence 2 months ago Fox getting praise response...

Texas already overtaken California cases per capita, ass deaths per capita. 

And Cali seen anywhere near hospitalization explosions either them. 

Great success guys. Haha same. honest wouldnt want many anyway Mhh think 24hrs observation. thought worst night like sometimes extremes. really could think 24hrs adventure could give better, complete Insight. increase workload? colleagues noticed increased tasks commute. Thanks. became lax 99 days sars-cov-2 free, virus bounds bounce back all. believe country time crisis, handle like previous waves. offer remote work? need people, might way. place look, despite pandemic, think I'm weird asking work remotely exclusively... 

What state jobs located in? reading article may plenty test performed people may plenty capacity existing automated testing machines process them, supplies run machines vendor specific vendors can't supply enough meet number tests. sound right? Kinda moot higher ups ones violating most, either wearing mask nose chin pulling talk. selected, please skeptical cop testimony without supporting evidence. MLS barely positive tests either God damnit, comment never fail bring smile face. wrap around Oakley shades thats one dumbest things ive ever heard. imagine terrified symbol think physical violence *less* harmful wonder they’re taking covid account. Like upcoming shitstorm November elections? 🤔 relatively difficult kill someone fire extinguisher, though. apples oranges. 

Also, there's tons unlikely stuff could happen take precautions it. Like wearing helmet cycling. Paying 100% attention 24/7 traffic (no matter vehicle not). Eating food might give cancer hypertension whatever (ok, that's unlikely) Yeah guess never thought breathe everyone’s breath plane lol. Thanks advice 😷 They’ll smart it, can’t roll mid pandemic would make look really bad. fires dampen little someone else makes first leap? knows  ah scares alot volunteer hospital rigorous training 

it disheartens people even coworkers haze it

lives househild 4 8 memebers high risk

scary No, three first announce instituting WFM all, extended it. Google first extend long, interesting see moves others, rest country. 

I edit clear.  parents going children go school? really think there's something saying here. Annecdotally There's huge uptick depressed young people lamenting 40 year career, seems pointless, can't imagine wasting life working long, etc. personally felt early 20s. 

The college experience today (or least late 2000s early 2010s) absolutely feels like paid vacation looking back. get experience level freedom, without responsibility comes graduation, course outlook remainder working life going look bleak. would persons guns removed committed crime?

I think I’ve actually spent money working home. Office 20 min commute though don’t super efficient car. Using electricity home, paying coffee (my quarantine splurge Nespresso machine), food costs doubled. But...I’m healthiest I’ve ever been—cooking fresh, whole food every day, cardio lunch, weightlifting work. that’s social cost seeing anyone building able chat. office setup way, way better. 

Ultimately feels like netted even overall, think. miss office dread adjustment period if/when ever go back. republican uncle, medical condition Canada wait months get treated.

I've wait months see appointment US. different, even true? nfl testing 41 thousands tests.

IF player gets infeceted miss 2 games , INCLUDING everyone contact them.

so unless teams lock players 6 months ONE sneaks , sports happen.

again sports non essential. that's good, went bubble yesterday, think woods. Edmonton last couple weeks become leader (per capita) new cases active cases among Canadian provinces. restaurant service staff working bubble coming going; even screening think still chance get in. lot businesses, especially consumer exposure, tend long standing policies paying profits ownership regularly, leaving minimal operating funds reserves business.

This part litigation risk mitigation strategy. routinely return profit shareholders, can't clawed back future lose lawsuit. (I work live entertainment) Broadway shut down. That's knew fucked long time. again, they’re still lagging number weeks behind processing tests. data current.
 
They’ve also downward trends several times already. trends spike several days later. Sorta like trends aren’t super reliable. that's states playing shell games death statistics. It’s almost like need collaborative worldwide effort..../s even reddit cant help? misread. need stay isolate vaccine.  place viral town hall meeting insane people publicly listing every conspiracy theory sun reasons use masks. Bill Gates 5G God.

I'm convinced Florida really massive medical experiment use double quotes cite verbatim. make clear saying article. stands like this, looks like someone revival saying. Please change post make clear saying what. Especially since top one's correctly citing below.

How many people bother read article think actually someone said. Feel like that’s many tbh Don’t want gym membership? buy $4000 bike. Easy! focus drug treatments now, since vaccine won’t coming another months earliest. since clearly people won’t accept another shutdown, best damage control. Oxford phase three almost month Brazil South Africa. They’re expecting results sometime August are.

My favorite argument demand housing consist solely locals need housing.

Where live unreasonably priced luxury apartments going market rate (yes would make new market rate) luxury apartments marketed towards wealthy foreign nationals need residence America, priced accordingly. market large cannot differentiate two.

All new housing near marketed towards people already live near me. guy article wearing trump shirt swastika. report comment want change facts. many people prisons are, number kind low? Stronger worker rights America? Keep dreaming. it’s good consumer bet corporate America fight tooth nail keep happening. mean every “essential business” already scrapped covid pay raise. ""I listened British say say exactly Sweden. two countries stand we, think case, hold slightly scientific line this. balance politics science us little different countries.""

Yes did. Either blind lie. conspiracy theories please -_-. Every company tech sector already work done effectively home. There's nothing Google knows COVID-19 already know. curve still going up. Common sense would dictate things going take longer get better.

Also, offices pretty cush, they're home. tech employees still prefer work home given option. probably depends are.

But still boomers office refusing leaders lay plan national strategy. look fun UwU antisocial before. I’d guess increase wfh little this. doesn’t matter work, move somewhere you’d like live, rather live. Unfortunately think gets canceled. hope nfl goes bubble like nba. really want see football played. Maybe 4 divisions four cities playoff/championship vaccine comes early Jan.  would great going blame allowing 70 thousand cases per day weeks without take concrete efforts minimize spread. Fucking Reddit. excuse put mentally ill people mentally ill helping openly admit mentally ill. hivemind stupid are. Oxford September

Those big three we're really counting on, well Johnson Johnson BioNTech Hang measurements sewage water conducted lot later. done water collected measured now. time sample collection knowledge coronavirus authorities genetic information PCR-testing could done time. tweeted fat people drink diet coke. say ""I drink diet coke,"" tons photos drinking it. believe you’re misguided. Sweden (and quite frankly, northeast US) got via herd immunity, either locking locking late, respectively. world didn’t end either locations. Letting virus burn perfectly valid solution, far preferable welded home authoritarian government, literally China “solved” - again, China multiple outbreaks reimplement awful, human-rights violating shutdowns multiple cities. 

Lockdowns don’t work. don’t. much would like microcontrol every “idiot” earth like little pawns make whatever want greater good, however you’re justifying motivations, people put it. even submit authoritarian will, won’t enough stop spread, much evidence proving that.

Example herd immunity: much Sweden’s cases deaths fallen without government shutdown. fall must due virus burning own.

Source showing herd immunity much lower think: source showing lockdowns result virus coming back: look data still reduce entire, data driven argument “but want kill people” nothing else say. hope everyone else come around eventually Rents 10% already. don’t think we’ll see mass exodus though. Work one reason people live near downtown. Herd immunity never goal here. Anders Tegnell said commenting subject.

Oh really? exact words Anders Tegnell 16 Mar 2020.

[""Our plan UK's: ensure get herd     
(Yes, remember UK aiming herd immunity? do).    
The relevant here: "" bit cautious *using word* breathes little given question of, says Anders Tegnell""           
That's months later would say ""herd immunity never part strategy"", *word* ""politically incorrect"" even unwelcome strategy obviously failed, like us ""politically correct"" predicted.        

Fact 1: Sweden wanted Herd Immunity        
Fact 2: Sweden praised wished imitate country covid deaths Europe.     
Fact 3: Sweden lies says want herd immunity       
Fact 4: Sweden hypocrite say ""UK much higher death rate us"" since herd immunity strategy largely part it, high death rate put lockdown, way around.

Speaking hypocrisy, sentence? "" listened British say **they say exactly Sweden.** two countries stand we, think case, hold slightly scientific line this. **The balance politics science us little different countries.**""

Personally normally feel hungry eating. something. brain, routine, boredom, advertisements, people, telling - time eat, it. also try hard lose weight, hunger something resist. Ah theres token fear mongerer always shows one threads. Honestly would pay cost degree Harvard meant got degree Harvard.

There's asterisk diploma take class online guarantee long choose degree carefully pay end.

TL;DR: agree almost institution literal actual Harvard America like two good things. Freedom speech, (which doesn’t even exist right now, police attacking unarmed protestors illegally detaining journalists,) good infrastructure power/water/what you.

I’m grateful wake first world country electricity, good internet utilities, fun finished goods nearly endless supply food. That’s essentially ends. last hundred years spent setting system fuck generation enriching taking responsibility.

Fuck America. mean. getting !remindme next pandemic Yeah estimate bonkers beginning. assumed would end community spread deaths would drop literally nothing June government needs support working people. Like elsewhere did. people protesting open businesses protesting government helping them, haircuts. modeling current pace coronavirus' spread U.S.

We long Covid. Started attempting lose weight middle february (a month covid really kicked denmark). I'm still morbidly obese 166kgs (365 pounds), I've actually lost 30kgs (65 pounds) since started. 1.25 kgs per week average, probaly border ""healthy"" lose. 

Shit takes time, sucks. I'd like add scientist medical professional anything saying may since proven false. unfair comparison. Writing software done nearly effectively remotely in-person done way lots companies long time. 

Teaching 8-year old remotely not, one idea effectively. Even done effectively (doubtful), probably take year figure effectively anyways. keep kids home next year, many practically losing year development, especially poorer ones without great workspaces internet home, without lot extra help parents even tutors, frequently non-white-collar parents can't stay home them.

No one saying sending kids school easy choice, rather might better incredibly problematic alternative. Google's case, alternative keeping people home barely downsides all, obviously debate. so?

If I'm typical teacher playing rules, I've locked summer. Healthy.

Then in-person school starts, within week, COVID-19. vector seems pretty obvious, it?

Are cases difficult because...yeah, *seems* obvious, evidence circumstantial? could got gas station wherever, timing coincidental?

My guess Sweden ever reach goal 100000 tests. due lack capacity, due lack demand. can’t talk movie theaters since never go, masks, life Thailand seems pretty much back normal. haven’t community transmission within well month (think 2 long stopped counting). also risk asymptomatic travelers getting since forced monitored 14 day quarantine multiple tests anyone coming here. 

Not everyone badly US is. masks change us non existance tourists lack foreign products imported. definitely negatives, live going it’s normal way people traveling inside country, holidaying, enjoying empty beaches need worry.

Beginning May (first week) rate 14% 12-13% Midsummer. 17-18% positivity rate around peak April based 17-25k tests per week. think possible increased tests earlier, would made drop sharper earlier - drop general population mild cases only. Due length severe cases hospitalization stay, think would changed considerably numbers deaths, unfortunately. 550 people died six weeks since mid-June now. That's number people died first two weeks June. Last two weeks May close 800, week 500 single week. people sick least half month deaths. think meant respond guy me.

I brought strictly context comment talking last weeks, never claimed anywhere explained whole anything vacations feared potential source new outbreaks... 

It would accurate say feared potential source new outbreaks places ill-equipped deal surge patients due low number permanent inhabitants, yes, notice happened - ascribe factors mentioned previous think find AC far Brazil India, Puerto Rico et.al.

Fair point, counter-arguments:

a) need moment get infected, spending even hour bus air-conditioned fridge levels (very common Indonesia friends tell also native Ecuador) enough happens infected person board, matter spent 167 hours week without AC.

b) countries still dealing relatively low levels spread, even 5% country's population lives AC-equipped houses, get infected make country rocket covid league table.

c) disregarding air conditioning, know direct extended experience people living hot climates tend *avoid* outside sunny temperature high, whereas Scandinavians eager brief periods get chance. Given this, stands reason effects warm weather would same.

I admit knowledge specifically seasonality flu India Brazil, know looking various countries' mortality data even countries would normally considered hot clearly visible seasonal patterns mortality, places stable climates (equator countries, basically) it. even spell Atlas correctly. really worry walking neighborhood wearing wrong type clothing getting killed cartels part of.

I concede present elevated risk staying home. However, done way thinking risk would improperly cleaned surfaces, read considered major source infection.

Hope stay safe well! luxury constantly away home, evidenced happiness needing travel. like work client have, deal. article doesn’t mention average deaths per month baseline comparing last 5 years. Statscan shows numbers around 3500 reported deaths per month average per province. BC, minus 100 reported COVID 350 average, Alberta article giving 2 month timeframe. numbers kind place article.

Anyone knowledge statistics knows article 1) short period statistically significant 2) small variance average statistically significant.

In fact, variance 1 month year year last 5 years 10% variance years.

I feel like Alberta BC done adequate reporting. One like 10 20 month... Sweden right LA county not? 

With similar populations, LA's death count lower 4360 confirmed cases higher @ 174K. Probably due Sweden reporting positives. 

 LA wear masks businesses closed restricted. Schools are't opening. contrast, Sweden largely living normal.  

So please, someone smart explain numbers spiking Sweden's plummeting? RemindMe! 2 months planning taking vaccine shot becomes available?

But second anti-masker sees someone mask pulled minute two, nose exposed gloom doom 'everyone wearing mask wrong' 'proof BS' , 'pointless anyone else even try' people guns? I'm confused saying. started quote article, confused all. quote? suggesting patrons caused situation become potentially lethal? Dr Fauci recommended wearing masks evidence researchers showed absolutely beneficial.

To fair, early recommendations masks discourage people hoarding PPE drastically short supply frontline medical workers time. think anyone claimed wearing mask actually made worse terms infected, people working hospitals ones *really* needed them. run strip paper surgical tape across top mask, seal prevent glasses fogging.

Yeah, problem current situation Covid anything controlled experiment measuring change productivity due working remotely. everything ""normal"" firm went remote only, might able review things went, middle completely unprecedented global event like this, simply example could trust hold true normal circumstances.

Personally, believe in-office work improves productivity efficiency, moreover, improved knowledge sharing. see level cross-department collaboration via zoom saw office settings. folks product speak folks sales speak folks finance absolutely offers collaborative atmosphere difficult replicate remotely. 

To clear though, firm recently lax WFH policies, people always office, general believe pure-remote workplace best path forwards. competitors back office firm not, productivity creativity gains become apparent (in opinion). diseases reality? believe understand this. claiming diseases list vaccins reached herd immunity? plainly wrong. Ask local immunologist.

Also maybe specific. argue reach herd immunity natural means (no vaccin). Right? diseases history happened with? Wait vaccine get approved next month it’s waiting game point wear masks social distance Maybe 500,000-million people sort lingering symptoms ranging mild severe I'm sure comments exists, certainly seen them. often ""I'm taking vaccine proven safe since accelerated important testing"" stop reading things make paranoid information really useful without actual numbers? 7 people searched ""are mask mandates communism"" last month 141 searched month, that's 2349% increase. still 141 people. significant all. 

Of course nobody would've searching anything ""masks unconstitutional"" ""mask freedom"" March. initial search volumes virtually nonexistent, even tiniest increase going appear massive percentage. I've stock piling ammo day vaccine propaganda came fruition. going though going people egged on. People like ones thread.

Ooh, mass murder. No, unless one symptoms do. Yeh, known effects stay recovering; breathing, lung damage, kidney problems, muscle waste, on. 

But I've heard Nick Cordero's experience- thought effects unique. apparently not.

And think idiots fight quarantine, lockdowns masks. 

It also brings perspective evil info-wars Bannon-ites posting sheer BS. punctuation confusing af. im starting get numb it, unfortunately.. 2020 need say ""im sexist"" asking question league average person know about... like someone saying whats QMJHL saying must anti-Canadian know Quebec Major junior hockey league.

I saying repeatedly. Medical workers biggest offenders.

My CNAs environmental services department far compliant cannot afford take risks nurses doctors do. Well using multiple negative tests buffer numbers exactly productive way. Much better look new tests/new infections looking see going down.

No clue record, me. talking points. stated purpose protest ""Allow us spread virus threat violence"" mean media saying protests would spread virus. were. Repeatedly. fact, MSNBC running commerical Maddow asks ""Don't think protests going spread virus?"".

Besides which, recall hearing much widespread protests cities virus spread immediately thereafter like Miami, Dallas, Houston Phoenix. might able make case LA Atlanta, one even trying make case nuanced. Correlation might actually equal causation. isn't... national news. mean, hanged beaten spot, like people think okay companies make clear WFH least option long while, younger employees home option move back parents' somewhere rent cheaper save money. What’s doubling rate?

;-) Nice job MLB, considering distance players field actually makes baseball one safest sports one could play this. bubble setups, players crowded dugouts, barely anyone wearing masks it’s EASY players without effecting performance whatsoever. you’ve fucked yr whole season couple games 👌 Definitely not. Millions current cases, minimal contract tracing, lockdowns, poor mask use... republicans took gamble. opportunity impeach trump mike pence president tail end presidency. thought keeping base happier would safer bet least secure house senate come November. I’m sure thought “yes he’s bad really what’s worse happen. almost this”. Well worst happened work U.K. isn’t planning us back full time new year, we’re handling much better (still great) US.
Right decision; I’ve Covid it‘s bit fucking shit. call shit, actually, disservice shit. It’s worse. guess, took higher paying contract without insurance vacation ie:per diem job. great! look way, statistically slower healthier it, likely keep off. lockdown preventing bars open first place prevent spread CoVID also would prevented this, thousands deaths number protests president show posters name portrait nazi symbolism beside it? would different?

Something like believe so. That, POTS. otherwise healthy, horrible tachycardia prevents working hard heat. I've several EKGs nothing show, seen cardiologist yet. reason believe EDS POTS part EDS. heart rate stable otherwise 120bpm jumps high 170bpm heat. 74bpm completely supine. Everytime ask anything ""anxiety"" happen history anxiety. shit anxiety heart racing like this, know? bunch things could like Lyme since characteristic red ring long time ago, visual snow syndrome... honestly surprise considering fucking super preemie. prevailed people think I'm ""overthinking it"" even though I've symptoms ridiculously young age heart rate definitely abnormal nobody stops look past EKG. can't advocate treat though I'm insane even though psychologist says get doctor.

Thanks. isolate already. feels ad though I'm one taking seriously I'm scoffed ""hypochondriac"". God forbid 21 year old obvious chronic illness.

I might begin taking zinc. November hope ponder dangers quarantining echo chamber. anything, salaries increase due savings office space, power, internet, maintenance supplies, etc. would offloaded onto worker. There’s difference living near *a* downtown people living near expensive downtowns country. working home becomes norm (which might), population might becomes less centralized. nice meltdown remember we’re home it’s arts turn go insane. employees tasted life without 3-4 hours commute every day. WFH cut suddenly, Googlers quitting en masse. compare life-years lost!!! per capita lives lost!

So point article, lol Try reading rest article. say asymptomatic common, put it. 

The article states ""Our results indicate silent disease transmission presymptomatic asymptomatic stages responsible 50% overall attack rate COVID-19""

50% presymptomatic asymptomatic 

So yeah. I'll stick point. I'm situation are. qualify payment based 2019 income, furloughed work since April employers realizing quality education Harvard creates also come open source areas, Coursera / self-learning.

They acquired even mismanaged conglomerate, who’s share price something like 75% last 4 years.

So guess happy ending depending soon owners/executives able share shares.  give distribution timelines, start end year - probably 2 billion total distributed given amount time first distribution - 6.. 12.. 18 months - knows? 

It's also dependent individual manufacturers region. They're licensing manufacturing Indian company supply India's 1 billion. I'm sure country prioritize supply well. example U.S. might prioritize healthcare workers, essential workers, etc.

Going quote, see end 8% 10%. I'm seeing 375% 1005%. Yet gotta remember since entire WFH situation started productivity decrease. anything, increased work tied live many people quick jump online answer emails outside normal working hours. People working now. I'm not, fuck precedent. companies realized WFH actually better every capacity. Productivity increased, office space costs cut, right employees asking ""internet/electricity"" subsidies cover extra personal costs WFH. Employees falling hook, line, sinker new environment due perks, companies real victors here. get productive workforce, get cut immense overhead costs, really anything else....we employees demanding stuff upfront, else become norm (that pay internet electricity, see sort salary increase monthly subsidy jobs cover extra costs).

Every employee WFH assumed overhead costs company use pay...and hardly us got sort raise compensate costs.

Wake people. would reasonable temporary solution guess, previous opponents too. fucks league schedules, unless team eliminated social equity, continue extract value wealthy instead I'd mostly agree saying BoJo *was* actually admitting anything rather simply creating diversion real problem (which horribly slow government reaction covid). He's lied unbelievable amount times mistakes made, claiming death toll predicted etc.

Reading comments thread making feel like live kind alternate universe. course people live Britain exposed continual gaslighting we're subjected Tories, think everyone needs understand indeed still they're completely shameless it. issue curbside delivery groceries need schedule advance everyone it, you’d run major “sorry, item stock” issues. 

But, it’d def option would help give shot. Trillions lives. . . Try 100K+. real headline “Florida general raises trust issues.”  Maybe often enough justify two cars alluding to? know vaccine made available? much winning without going party, without visiting extended family

Visit **outside** small groups friends / family.

All wear masks socialize distance. Good mental health staying safe. That's pretty much guarantee. That's seeing ""death waivers"" states included enrollment paperwork upcoming year. Money can't buy new cardiovascular system. Rich people die too.  monthly fees film instead game I'm board taking baby steps make it. Keep gets easier. agree, peoples opinions different. made comment expected numbers infections below.
After thinking moment right now, bit concerned:
If vaccine reliably prevent infection root, data even provide clue whether younger people severe form seldom not, older people enough well.

This especially interest focus immune dysfunction Covid-19.

Only ""hope"" US get cases next two three months, data valid. mean that's flu is, it? accept hundreds thousands people die flu yearly, would drastically easier stop CV. deny balance somewhere society walks comes human life &amp; individual freedoms risk it.

This comment justify complete opening anything like that. meant pull conversation away extremes &amp; ultimatums. personally part &amp; practice aggressive social distancing &amp; self-isolation. still conversation around balance lie, instead treating people like monsters disingenuous implications character. sad. need tougher firearm restrictions ever before. scares shit fact Democrats Republicans purchasing firearms almost predicated fear simple home defense sporting. 

The worst part many people r/politics rooting Democrats buy guns literally months ago freaking gun ownership. That's hypocrisy fullest extent. 

After get Trump I'm longer calling Democrat Republican. parties antiquated destroying everything we've built. I'm joining humanity party whether called 2024 something else, God's sake, let's get normal moderates unique ideas ability think independently once.

Seriously. Whenever see someone claim Democrat Republican can't help look cognitively less caveman quite possibly dangerous handgun possess ideals sow seeds utter destruction. suppose anyone's fault, though. We've completely brainwashed ratings clicks, means reverse think feel world.

Either way, Fuck shit. I'm humanity, party. Also; hey, check happens nice weather Winter comes 9000' elevation. . . . realize 320 million people country saying message asking things, right? Good thing colleges starting go fully online, cant beat virus US vaccine comes out. body ready. Lemme overpriced boomer shit. fly every day? hotel? sounds horrible. Seems like would've great chance give people like guy room say ""See experts either""  context, Ive heard far Miami Marlin's players test positive week informed opponents Philadelphia Phillies it. Instead sending infected players quarantine, decided let play Phillies (the uninfected team mind you) wore masks. Complete utter fucking incompetence. Inappropriate sinus tach? mom covid couple months ago. fine shes way older. Obviously YMMV maybe info help put mind ease little.

- - - 

The thing remember is, virus incredibly contagious - people around arent complying, remove yourself. Always keep mask covering nose mouth stay away people. best, responsible lower risk substantially.

Also vitamin C, zinc doesnt hurt. make sure getting daily values get good sleep. never happen. want happen but.. lol never Remember next time someone tells “we listen doctors.” It’s really important know doctors you’re told listen to. Vitamin D3. read studies r/COVID19, nutshell many severe reactions virus vitamin deficient.

It miracle cure might help, cheap. real downside taking it. people without symptoms transmit infected people transmit virus symptoms don’t symptoms. important people infected identified testing, isolated, and, depending severity disease, receive medical care. Even people confirmed COVID-19 symptoms isolated limit contact others. measures break chains always important stay least 1 metre others, cover mouth cough sneeze bent elbow tissue, clean hands regularly, stay home become unwell asked. areas widespread transmission, also important people wear fabric mask physical distancing control measures cannot implemented. here. order out, try order directly restaurant pick rather something like DoorDash. way know money going restaurant getting skimmed top.

* Closer Asia larger Asian population elsewhere US, attractive east Asian investors / second home buyers.
* parts support urban lifestyle car, walking/biking, etc.

Supply factors:

* Depending location Bay Area: land constraint. areas built usable land already.
* restrictive zoning laws: lots red tape build anything, restrictions housing go, height easements.
* Sub-bullet zoning laws: lack willingness build / increase density. See areas like sunset capped 2-3 stories, despite able (at least parts) support higher. Paris higher population density SF, despite high rises (in central Paris).
* Cost building due geological features: earthquakes, landfill, etc.

All together create recipe massive price increases. Demand shot starting late 90s really let since (there downturn early 00s flattening post 08 recession). Various Bay Area cities tried address various ways, NIMBYism gotten way pretty much everywhere.

The pandemic MIGHT help, also creating weird problem: lowering demand high density [read: highrise) apartments lack outdoor space limited floor space. Pre-pandemic solution increase density housing, post pandemic knows. True.   
However know countries effective.  
South Korea example    
(South Korea US reported thier first case day ).  
S.Korea deaths =299 far.  
US deaths =149,849 far. thought dream, no? Everyone armed, time right? Polite society enforced massive firepower. Government overreach answered tactical armor, AR-15, spraying bullets crowd. alternatively driving car high speed crowd, like idols ISIS do.

Oh, wait, want ""hood rats"" armed, want ""the good guys"" armed. still 100% certain get twice not. people reporting getting (could flare first one might possible they're getting reinfected, still know certain,) second time worse often. reason many conflicting articles there's disagreement. Agreed city weekend apartment building next us girl turning 22 50+ people rooftop, none masks close proximity. ask pretty much resigned fate till vaccine Yes. Almost like race / ethnicity absurd belief systems thing.

How become s*****? Unless pay lot money like Wimbledon did. We're exploring option too, lots people expressed wanting come back due distractions home, insufficient workspace, kids going nuts, etc. We'll see plays 20% captures super spreaders could see rate slowing especially people cautious large gatherings closed down.

Completely irrelevant. reproduction number average already takes account, distribution spread affect threshold required herd immunity.

All diseases spread unevenly. SARS-CoV-2 special. Definitely pandemic awareness that, keeping policy able cancel membership online phone. cancel person. brings unnecessary risk employees customers alike. Twitter says he's oxygen, ventilator. CEO Goldman Sachs opener. cement monument rich white privilege. don’t seem detect failure logic Yet Gov. Lee refuses issue statewide mask order saying delegated authority mayors. wiki page talks low income areas stores less options invariably less healthier fresh produce high income areas. change fact buy cheap healthy food bodega dollar general compared processed shit eat McDonalds. argument food served Taco Bell Burger King healthier rice, pasta, beans, canned vegetables, literally cheap options available corner store? No, prepackaged deli cold cuts walmart healthy fresh cuts butcher, healthier shit find Subway sandwich. Claiming fast food healthier food options provided food desert corner store weak hill die on. giving employees OPTION stay home summer 2021. misleading headline. Sure, that's sorta dismissive point. 

If want hospitals overloaded, reduce rate transmission grow exponentially like what's going rn. seems current policies that. Ricans can't choose though.

And citizens 50 US states *can*? get choice income taxes *or* disgusting situation smart people would prefer voices heard instead selling rights tax cut.

Believe not, many people, many *are* smart, really care politics. think voter turnout people vote US anyway? 55%. think people, especially would found commonly reddit, estimate much population really gives shit. Seriously. think 45% people vote stupid, rather care. anything, Republicans good motivating stupid people vote. 

I think large portion 45% even portion 55% would OK giving right vote mean would get much 25-35% pay taxes back. That's life changing money most, voting change many people's lives. beware Englishmen? It’s also projected people die AIDS, cancer, heart attacks time didn’t go hospitals people die COVID.  March April difficult grocery delivery nyc trouble since ""doing fine"" work global pandemic. going squash virus pandemic. Flatten curve, isolate vulnerable, let runs course healthy population slower pace.

With strategy we're still lockdowns 2021. Wow stubborn stupid White House? That’s low bar achieve. Congratulations! plenty posts reddit arguing people care “the greater good” paychecks. It’s disgusting. Looking back 2008... somehow it'll still responsibility pay bank fuck up. Trump, utterly failed pandemic response, never POTUS, gets blamed bad Repubs party always great reminder garbage continue him.

They're following WH guidance they're genuinely bad people. dunno chap, fuckin mind. cannot develop necessary antibodies own, would greater risk negative outcome contract disease compared someone vaccinated. That’s employer immunoglobulin hand job site person risk contracting hep B job. Yes, yes ! Let hate flow you! According news articles saw today, tested negative day two ago. true. terms production ramp rollout, also sizable number people want “wait see” vaccine safe.

We face ethical questions like employers able mandate vaccine employment, accept unemployment refuse vaccine, poor communities access vaccine on.

This may exacerbated reports vaccination may last months, increase suspicions conspiracy theories. may willing take vaccine give children fear unknown effects vs relative danger disease too. Theoretically everyone US quarantined weeks, closed border completely first heard virus, one would died. Typical summer flu deaths reported covid. original comments claims were. “If nothing” I’ve house 17 years month first time I’ve gone $300 month. I’ve tried messing thermostat bit past weeks significantly uncomfortable slightly higher setting it’s worth extra $10-15/mo keep cool day. don’t care mask wear long wear masks doesn’t seem proper seal they? know well antibodies protect you, even test positive antibodies, still cautious. disagree narrative this. fan large groups, looks like people back social distancing kind hard gauge distance people front angle. video shows less social distancing front, large field can’t gauge distance lights dark field. isn’t really “large concert” means. probably wisest move, certainly less dangerous many beach crowds we’ve seen protest crowds well. virus discriminate cause, charity anyways, simply calling people selfish might short-sighted.  someone makes living re-writing offshore code... Please tell anyone cheap engineers make much money. gets even worse go overfat, enough excess fat predispose someone medical problems. years back. study concluded americans risk due excess fat. 

Our horrible diets arguably single biggest killer US right now. that's even getting amount damage done environment, animal cruelty, etc. We're destroying much collective insistence need live junk/fast/packaged food. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

The words would ""declining titers"" Come now, that's water-wise. Southern California I'm making cinder-block wall topped broken glass iron spikes keep riffraff. congree! literally spat drink reading this. expect that. Wow. Thanks making day 😂 happy help! anybody know reason incredibly low numbers deaths get posted Sundays Mondays? like start I'm sure result way deaths entered, always confusing me. Yuuup, I'm fan Taos starting fine people, large popular hotel Taos voluntarily shutting keep staters coming infecting others.

Was happy see videos cars state plates denied entry state parks.

Now need everywhere else follow suit -- discourage travel, travel enforce mask wearing fine crap them. Hygiene sure, universal masking? see point everyone wearing mask time public over. sick, sure - reminder darker time - quite frankly look forward day burn masks back Jeep. u forgot lot boys can't sleep night catholicism non priests went jail pay this...
look what's going world, Erd0gan, KlM, Putln, BoIsonaro, Tr ump Covid-19 now. belive god anymore... assholes getting richer poor ones getting even worse condition...
belive helpfull friendly, world would better place everyone would like  Yeah work currently work home set official date forced managers justify anyone needs office time. already know kids going back school September would vastly easier work would say something like change next summer. Depends strain - lot people said, last winter's flu BAD. stuck bed week, also even ""better"" (had be) back work, sucker hung lungs/chest WEEKS. actually thought turned bronchitis, except w/ Covid everyone's talking last year's flu, I've heard many stories identical mine, I'm pretty sure ""just"" bad flu. told took 5-6 weeks finally started feeling ~normal again. sucks! There's reason kill vulnerable people! That’s one expert field many. publication make valid points. However, actively published professionals. us argue consensus changed. expertise. Leave task appropriate circle scientific experts peers. debate ongoing but, thus far, people considered sister species strong arguments justifying stance. It’s interesting idea entertained scientific fact people “a third species chimpanzee.” pay well. There's guy going work right every city America whose entire job dive giant tanks human feces clear blockages pumps. 

There thing job people do, wage worth job. [Got back real. crisis, like Irish potato famine Holodomor Ukraine, political issue. That's great question. like people lottery whole thing, crazy. ~23k tests per weekday 4th July. lucky 20k/weekday. Tests taking way long get results lot people skipping getting tested. 904 today’s 1,813 cases tests done July 11-14. Hope building cash last couple years 2008. Banks write loan 6 months liquidity payment. People wishing another crash first all, disgusting, hateful people, waiting loot corpse fellow americans, second all, idea talking about. education ranked 43rd nation so... lots dumb people here. looking options, likely setups look outside state. Thats problem know haha. way defining denominator case different, comparing resulting percentages informative.  Burnout likely happen. like current job much February I've barely seen three best friends since pandemic started. used get lunch every single day. easier grab ear quick help. Roommates distract me. Free food. Gym medical staff site. ""This America! Because, fuck you!"" tongue cheek. get well. hear cases people going around world spreading back countries well. 
This shows global economy banning travel actually happen.  reason fed sugar water. literally nutritional value value whatsoever-no matter portion size. 

I fed water. many tourists travel US well, normal year anyway. drop plexiglass dome doors. depends. wearing mask said protest? No? congratulations, may caught covid! Bingo. #2 #3 I'm going guinea pig thing. Fed fed intravenously. mean, possibly.

A. know long immunity lasts naturally, vaccine could beneficial, creating immune response similar disease.

B. vaccine designed stimulate antibody production. may hurt someone gets vaccinated realize I'll first. However, take time amp antibody production, may useless duration disease, anyway. vaccine actually effective, we're going ""fun"" trying explain people still need chill least couple weeks build immune response, guarantee it. We're going see stories people getting sick claiming work tried go back normal immediately. mentally prepare looks like works, see bullshit coming already USA #1 I'm cutting everyone checks, paying everyone threshold stimulus. I’m guy trying teach lesson, lesson wasn’t immunity.

If limited understanding thing, certitude others wrong unwarranted. 

This person self admitted limited knowledge thinks knowledge good enough declare everyone disagrees wrong.

His certitude unwarranted.

Now I’m arguing antibodies all, person rudimentary knowledge subject shouldnt pass sweeping judgement everyone else full shit.

So response memory B cells sorely missed point.

I guess succinct thing say would “whoosh”

Edited fix word Yeah, even gave everyone three months, would give us three month pause keep working stuff start much better point. Good lord, stop appealing authority personality incredulity. care.

*Is implication state health departments started manipulating new case data day White House ""took control"" data?* Look man, there's certain amount accommodation going get here. There's fine line office equipment toddler dropping ""work phone"" company replace 5x year.

Most places give reasonable replacement cycle office equipment like laptops phones, eg apple care, warranties etc.


Lots professions still require professionals get equipment work, office not. many American states calling “mask requirement” “mask mandate” zero repercussions? Indiana example said “requiring” facemasks, look article: “There penalties associated following new statewide even call that? Sweden decided euthanize large portion sick elderly instead admitting ICU. shameful, downvote saying it, truth.  Running bases time could see wearing mask impacting performance. vast majority base running one two bases, 90 180 feet. That's huge distance. also like one least contact sport......  cops ones instigating communists. people thinking everyone different views communist go work grocery store week. Maybe Home Depot. Luckily everyone wearing mask public now.

Before mandate line behind guy Publix wearing mask. told cashier can't wear one feels like can't breath. moron full face motorcycle helmet cart!!!!!! brain surgeon literally left store, got motorcycle donned full helmet face shield. wish gotten photo prime specimen Florida Man. one compare Northeast. 

They got hit harder faster anyone testing capacity place. 

Places like CA, TX, FL much less excuses.

Politically speaking situations TX FL particularly tragic back May clearly reopening almost fully soon, applauded ""success"" stories. look. answers never claimed did. 5 year old wish better answers. I'm enraged.  many think uncover exactly? would HALF cases start making Florida look like bad. bother Like trump president has? member trump administration dies Coronavirus I'm throwing big virtual party  bad people like end turning states go California, voting things caused flee idiots assholes. two meet one person get shitshow.

Woogie woogie! ruled vegetable, ruled contain serving vegetables (tomato tomato sauce).

Just like contains serving(s) dairy, fat, grains, etc. Unless Joe Pesci Casino. Yep. look posts sub info. Bro. even gonna see plateau new cases close things like bars. Yup. Hence try always get back 'low hanging fruit' comment. Imagine writing like  Yep, 4 month paid vacation good enough. $450 weekly return work. CCP probably told tedros say this. Herd immunity great herds, that's many bison roaming plains. #TrumpsTraitors - Following individuals prosecuted post Trump admin. Bill Barr, Billy Williams, Chad Wolf, Louie Gohmert, Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, Erik Prince, Rudy Giuliani, Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson, Kayleigh McEnany, Kellyanne Conway. much China apology going here. fuck. literally covered fucked world. USA would’ve never gone path China didn’t cover ""Golf nice walk, ruined"". really getting better

Sounds like they're desperate try paint case less deadly clearly is. fucked reaction allowed entry, almost cross posted /rWTF, well. Sensible. censorship here. got banned another subreddit city rude someone kept saying fake 2nd account someone else everytime wrote something. started ""who pretending be"" get less civil. 

I checked post anything today, 99% means also blocked. OK, I'm sad. staying California moving another state? Also, virus airborne aerosolized. add AC, 6 ft rule that’s already established isnt enough especially inside— disaster. mean much me, better, give trust need take risk. UK currently letting infected Americans country literally want upset Donnie boy. Perhaps heard Trump threatening universities in-person classes. says universities classes 100% remote foreign students deported. bad-ass may may be. Trust me, I'm not. yes, salaries pretty outrageous, part cost living Bay Area. pay cut someone decides live someplace cost-effective? hiring contract, legal, shitty. Written handbook somewhere makes simply corporate power games designed screw employee. Going forward new hires work remotely, sure. guy Iowa going ask less guy Santa Clara, even skillset. pay cut employee chooses move? Corporate greed, pure simple.  right news? feel defensive. dying herd immunity? can't believe people actually upvote posts wishing millions Americans lose single valuable asset, loot corpse. 
 
And what? homeowner watching people root lose all? ok that? Nothing world dangerous sincere ignorance conscientious stupidity. **Martin Luther King Jr.** never protecting themselves. fascinating read! Thanks sharing! fixes amount testing. NFL investing testing **adds** testing capacity rather taking away public.

*IF need ""Sports"" fulfill morale.. need better life.*

That's opinion. 100 million Americans disagree got wanted. opinion one override opinion 100 million. Correct. One guy scarf/neck gaiter mask around neck yesterday getting groceries. politely told mask mandate area store requires on. Said pull up. buddy must agreed said something guy right next time saw him. issues.

Then saw another dude nose thing actual proper mask, older guy ""I dare you"" sort look. Figured knew deal (it freaking surgical mask all) told ""hey man, that's like dick hanging top pants, pull up."" ignored me, argue either. 🤣 hate saying obvious  really hope teacher's union reach help. absolutely reason distance learning cannot implemented USA. top talent cheap prices

There thing. occasionally get someone good really good cheap price soon realize could making money somewhere else move on. Turnover one big issues manage dealing outsourcing. got pushed back March 2021 trust listen Dr. Fauci admitting made mistake, even vastly screwed up.

He vastly screwed up: purposefully lied us. knew well masks would help, said otherwise order prevent hoarding. political decision, medical decision. regretful this, people use (logically rightfully) reason listen anything else says, grand majority information provides spot vitally important American people.

H'e's grownup... I'd bet lives long enough write memoir, even slightly self-reflective, he'll talk great regret choice lie masks. Moses Mountain Doctor 6th grade graduate brain surgeon Jethro Bodine, ain't never asked fer masked man date! paw? ~ Elly Mae Clampett would comfortable getting vaccines ill anything, even mild cold. sad, RIP. THANK YOU. think people reddit like truth live head sand. news happening! accurate used separately together. Immunity last long.. get reinfected month later. Also, viral load gets tossed around lot here. People ignore obvious genetic risk factors, including gene defective pretty much guaretnees end ICU. fucking tourism. STOP LEAVING LIVE, PEOPLE BRING PLACES CANNOT HANDLE IT

Sorry, looking front door line GA, FL, TX, AZ places plates little ass tourist town gonna ensure aint around winter/next year. Stop going camping shit. hate it, makes upset

Stay home absolute misunderstood, glossed-over concept diet nutrition *portion size*. expect experience American typical most. school taught lot **what** eat, never **how much**. college looked calorie (at least, pertains food).

Your problem mom fed juice. gave much (juice everything else). possible drink nothing juice still thin. Perhaps healthiest choice, terms weight management, really exactly simple calories in/calories out. Given age, shocking, hopefully recovers soon. Imho think 100k deaths pretty massive already. sincerely hope rite Yup. constitutional right wearing mask. federal government arguably can't impose states (10th amendment). Ive given facts data debunk everything ""feel"" understand youre disbelief.

The information there... people making mountain mole hill. 

**Is COVID real?** absolutely

**Does spread?** quite remarkably 

**Should wear mask public?** absolutely

**Will die get it?** almost certainly not... disproportionately kills elderly men.

The people need worry avoid mass social gatherings 65+ (median death age currently 78, thats 82 two months ago)

Those retired, already setup stay home, ones quarantining. Like Flu able choose want to... get sick, thats them... retired didnt NEED go concert/baseball game/carnival/etc rest world living running normal High flow oxygen, CPAP, bipap. There's one method aiding breathing ventilation. company us home end March. team betting pool ""the first day could theoretically meeting office."" vote April 1st, 2021. I'm person left betting pool whose date already elapsed.

They thought crazy! Except health care system , like schools everything else, isn’t designed pandemic. need completely separate hospital Covid patients safely treat people. guess non wfh folks die? got posted today, thought honest well written. Desantis: Time open bars! Oh, well basically answered it. thinking infrastructure (schools, roads, water/sewer) basically guided zoning. I’ve always considered introvert months WFH pretty miserable ready go back office. WFH next summer literally sounds like nightmare. confederacy lasted 5...

No, still screwing country. This...


There's much say this...


People need basic courses philosophy... challenge people hard time threading needle fat shaming constructive advice

Even people money, problem big part tourism, hospitality, service eating go bars clubs -- activities spread virus possible wearing facemask. see entire sectors tourism, hospitality, service everywhere facing bad times pandemic control.

I doubt matters much focus reopening stimulus neglect get virus control. So, yeah, bad times Vegas anywhere else depends tourism, especially since country doubling reopening ""sending kids back school."" can't get hard see root economic problem public health. Well good Swedish ;) Coronaviruses probably cause severe epidemics recent times. People remember Swine Flu lower fatality rate regular flu people argue reacted quickly declaring pandemic. first SARS virus MERS Coronaviruses serious. high fatality rates also real incubation period. screening people's temperature found carriers quite quickly. helped lot fight two. one much harder contain pre-symptomatic asymptomatic periods. harder find carriers.

Vaccine much likely treatment. Vaccine technology well known used years. accelerating vaccine development quite safe vaccine effective way controlling it. Q1 - Q2 likely vaccine, think 3rd vaccine reach phase 3 passed safety tests humans. vaccines provide protection.

Treatments disease take much longer develop vaccine unless find treatment already approved another disease repurposed use COVID19. bringing completely new therapeutic market targets complete new aspect biology can't accelerated. many unknowns safety protocols followed carefully. could several years. one exception would neutralising antibodies like Regeneron making. essentially end product vaccines. Regeneron selecting think effective antibodies body produces COVID19 mass producing them. really skipping vaccination step also accelerated clinical trials quite safe naturally produced body. revelation, virus DragonBall Z Goku gets. Motherfucking Akira Toriyama predicted 25 years ago. soon started working home began incurring extra costs like this. failed calculate running A/C office more, increased water, SNACKS...

Although ""lockdowns"" relatively mild. Germany example never really locked down. big lockdown alliance Europe Spain, Italy, France, later limited even UK.

DE, NL, DK, NO, never real lockdowns, restrictions sure, lockdown meaning ""A **lockdown** requirement people stay are, usually due specific risks others move freely."" 


Edit: agree, article garbage. People can't handle shit ""normal"". They're talking WFH equipment - monitor(s), comfortable decent quality headset, mouse &amp; keyboard, chair.

Yeah you’re right, ignored fact Hillary ran terrible “He say mean word!!!!!!!!!!!!” campaign Trump demolished corruption. 

I get it, don’t like Trump either disregard failure nae nae kweenz Hillarys campaign naive Google could choose expand US offices US offices, regardless COVID wanted to. maybe already. appreciate sentiment cannot solve systemic issues individual solutions. need functional government. Great Depression different era much less hyper-specialized hyper globalized economy. kids went home likely infected parents. article based study. based one Emergency Room Doctors report. surprise people taking grain salt. won't.

Can't overstate name capitalism, business owners risk customers' lives told what's right. 

Because, BusInEsS... South Korea's outbreak March, patient #31 churchgoer (well, cult churchgoer) attended quite sick, somehow attendance caused 1000 new cases within week. Within weeks shut city Daegu it, Korea became #2 outbreak country (besides China) several weeks. amazing job controlling outbreak, rampant anymore, like 1 case per 1M population per day, compared 200 cases per 1M population per day US. citizens 50 US states can? get choice income taxes voting?

Yes already better deal. Even think like grind people's gears understand removing representation taken lightly can't say ""but pay federal income tax Believe not, many people, many smart, really care politics. Bla bla bla bla bla ...

You really arguing Puerto Ricans deserve representation vote anyway. really really hope teenager, otherwise quite think large portion 45% even portion 55% would OK giving right vote mean would get much 25-35% pay taxes back. That's life changing money most, voting change many people's lives.

Still justify removing representation. Plus wages lower people would pay significantly less (around 12% top bracket), sadly still give away voice. seem uneducated dismissive, think convince since requires certain level empathy understanding politics seem have. [Citation needed] zach guy called owen told girl 'enjoy poverty' kinda cunt would that?  can't true. Dave Facebook feed said COVID-19 real. anyone vaccinated year tho matter point stimulus give people money spend things would otherwise buy. Someone tons money would save invest it, could see people making $150k spending shit. He's trying act dumb, one wants elect dumb person govern country. He's trying act like buffoon, character - someone memorable also whose strange antics distract questionable decisions. Sure, it'll lot fun world China sole super power. They've always treated people well. 30 years daily interactions idiots provided ample evidence opinions. Rebels... Lol. That's funny way putting it.

But speculation idiot online. That's video. 

NBC knowing demographic. :) It’s heck pneumonia season FL. don’t.

Countries lighter lockdowns similar IFRs.

You right. different people die people’s negligence. doesn’t make smaller health concern isn’t case though. Death death.

Also, right, lung cancer isn’t dangerous obesity. things less deadly widespread bigger public health threat things deadly less common. depends total years life stolen public total particular problem. According article, answer IRS sent checks starting April, based payments either 2019 2018 tax returns, reflect earnings coronavirus pandemic brought economy standstill March. means higher earner whose income dropped 2020 income thresholds stimulus payments, get extra benefit file taxes next That's IRS reconcile tax credit 2020 income, tax experts saying help you, hurt Families also receive $500 child 17, means families children born adopted 2020 get tax credit $500 file taxes next year, according Yet Europe cusp second wave, HK Australia already second wave. Almost like there’s pandemic highly contagious virus going on. Possible. mean saw serious NBA took coronavirus right away. immediately shut canceled games soon one player tested positive (Gobert).

Such as? like, what's stopping saying no? balance powers statewide government level? Cause me, deathsentence probably refuse it. then? swing state much longer. corona kills older people disproportionally, older people vote Republican disproportionally. statistics. I'm amazed bad disease anyone that's weight. LA see people wearing face masks sadly still see small family party's. Wish people would stop acting selfish spread virus. apologies then, I've seen happen (one would expect fact checking least media happen publishing content, live new age lol). ""Full disclosure: gay conservative, someone often juggles persecution sexuality true values. combination requires lot tenacity earn respect either group.

In great haste, began prognosticating alphabet soup “scamdemic.” believed virus hoax. believed mainstream media Democrats using create panic, crash economy destroy Trump’s chances re-election.

And so, believing pandemic hoax, partner hosted family members Saturday, June 13. Sunday, June 14, woke sick.

By Monday, June 15, partner parents sick. Monday, in-laws traveled witness birth first grandchild. took father-in-law’s mother one partner’s sisters. night father-in-law became ill. mother-in-law daughter began feeling sick. cut trip short.""""

And yet still, still people believes virus hoax. going believe they, someone family, gets sick. Well, perhaps end covid. really sad do. Florida big place

Only place country drive north get southern guess what, coming Florida. Random Redditors going say since Google allowing workers back Summer 2021 social distancing Google knows all, allegedly. limited US locations there’s fans games ? Hold now. get cocky. They've yet play game. know fucking stupid. Everything racism now, like go see news Covid, keep seeing people talk cops killers shit.

Go take /r/politics /r/liberal. running adverts non stopped Florida Keys Space Coast. Meanwhile freaking Disney opened back up. insistence perp named black man racism never go away either. admit dude it’s kinda racist don’t even need told it’s black man assume race person black. you’re right doesn’t make kinda racist asshole. two gym memberships since 2012, cancelled soon reopened put together garage gym less $1,000. It’s COVID free, old men walking around wiener hanging blame picking weights. Worth investment. literally closed NBA season 1 case.  really pay ""cut"". taking salary adjusting equivalent new areas cost living. still buying power. No. Pedophiles scum. Trump trying murder children.  look cool, believe normal times helpful see entire person's face ID purposes. I'm going say masks helpful certain circumstances, universal definitely necessary 2022-3. own! really exhausting. know overly wordy writing style doesn’t come across intelligent witty? It’s completely unoriginal shows can’t express thoughts concise manner. chance young? Like teenager early twenties? would explain rigid thinking, lack understanding government policy actually formulated shelf Reddit personality. Fair enough are, 10 years ago. Unfortunately ‘style’ transparent substitute actual facts, logic sources (btw I’ve said can’t provide evidence something doesn’t exist, can’t provide evidence god doesn’t exist, stop asking so).

You’re criticising unjustified assertions? started unjustified assertion constantly weasel defending. please, tell me, evidence shows UK government’s anti-obesity strategy exists cover post Brexit food shortages? Please answer actual sources tedious pseudo-intellectual ‘put downs’. 

Again claim believe trust government rigid echo chamber thinking. human prone human failings. Also narcissistic tendencies almost essential reach levels government. doesn’t mean can’t sometimes create implement useful policies benefit countries. People complex, aren’t extremely good bad, governments different. Formula 1 running weeks without outbreak.... people involved taking seriously quarantining within team wearing masks 99.9% time around people. Literally impossible. average onset symptoms 5 days.  Given coronavirus particles 0.08 micrometres

The size virus irrelevant, since transmits respiratory droplets much larger.  I'm catch lot flack extended family declining BBQ invite couple weeks. cousin family flying hotspot coming another hotspot, live. I've got articles like back decision. Yeah get human beings. sad truth human beings die everyday. world perfect never be. either upset strive things obtainable (like humanity right thing) accept cards dealt. One side totally dropped ball bitches moans claims would done much better, reality would fail hard. Take precautions, safe. good citizen use common sense. That's do.

When hear bout idiots Covid parties getting it, pity morons. Candace Owens still exists. Don’t dismiss surgical masks release amount unfiltered breath. leaves via sides nose area. Anyone wears glasses attest unfiltered breath fogging glasses.

Here study showing it. 3m mask study valved model. Exact thing happened UK Jamie Oliver. Instead actually improving quality lunches, removed designated ""unhelathy"" items, unfortunately, things worth eating. little thought put implementing changes, literally bare minimum say something, made overall situation worse.

They also shut school tuck shop, despite regular old newsagent right round corner - brilliant thinking, instead able keep eye sweets kids buying, send 'em offsite.... didn’t death count 650k+ require self imposed economic bomb. That's obvious months. Sadly people ever wake up. right lightyears ahead us ages: faith! Blindly trust it'll work knows, might! Exactly, replacements cost thing. What's problem? Good point know that. would basically need quarantine 2 weeks getting vaccine? also understand numerous boosters may needed post vaccine. crowds see rioters cover three faceholes, ideally. Arkansas resident, idiot Tom Cotton, I've basically lost faith state's government representation. statues last 160 years, anti-maskers continually defend statues bitter end. home state Maryland, State Superintendent said purposes COVID-19 outbreak school would mean 1 single person (student staff) school disease. would require school shut 2 weeks (at least). Can’t tough paycheck, pretty soft. Plenty us plebs things money don’t want really want like FIFO mining outback Australia. mess Indiana. Test shortages (1 per household unless prepared pay pocket). contract tracing (in county anyway). Large gathers 250 allowed. Sounds like funeral home following state guidelines. mask mandate went effect today, attendance required wear mask.

Sorry loss. aaaand that's still want get even low (relative demographic) mortality rate Humans gonna human Yes, calorie dense food makes overweight. would thought? would eat lot healthy food get obese, thats eating fast food often. care weight depressed, find idea cooking exhausting day work impossible probably eating junk food.

I feel like arguing point make. Yeah, it'll based cost living calculator. types calculators already used HR team multiple offices across country/globe. they'll take current salary adjust equivalent new area. I'm probably going get it, believe nonsense microchipping vaccines, faith anything US government pushing right time low, skeptical double-checking feels lot smarter time last year, let alone 10 years ago. I've seen ""antivax"" sentiments lately make sense. information regarding COVID19 China thrown out? impossible numbers low, ridiculous. another 1200? aw shit man things MUST bad theyre paying amount human attention span good enough ""on high alert"" times

That Sweden's argument imposing strict lockdown late March. can't keep year vaccine available, soon ""get lazy"", virus spring back. try go ""medium alert level"", **can** sustain year - accepting nails get stepped early on, hopefully less overall (to stretch analogy *way* beyond reasonable...) great question. hard problem. central guidance, state district cobbling something different together scratch, effectively re-inventing wheel. And, teachers' unions, virtually impossible enforce training instructors new tools they'd need properly remote learning, - similarly in-class instruction - good teachers bad teachers, providing wildly differing levels instruction.

Like much response administration, instead spreading truth planning worst, spreading false hope hoping best. instead using last three months since first shutdowns figure effective way teach kids using remote instruction, assuming everything better come August school go back normal. administration double decision admit dropped ball.

Remote learning work well parents afford look kids home work. may even computer home, Internet. school learning work obvious risk lack capacity (and possibly funding) implement proper social distancing. even did, relies (at least younger kids) model citizens follow rules endanger children teachers. parents can't even manage model citizens comes following social distancing guidelines, know one reasonably expect children be.

And, no, better idea. Like said, hard problem, area expertise, paid think 40+ hours week last 3 months. getting vague CDC guidelines less month schools reopen basically says ""reduce class sizes follow social distancing guidelines"" plan action, much less one implementable shows thought foresight. Hard believe wouldn’t aware positive tests team game. could argue job right aware nothing else exactly it’s horrid lapse either way maybe I'm alone, really want relocate pandemic. planning it, way I'm getting plane year. Unfortunately happening lot. Even know better taking liberties social gatherings want semblance normal life back regardless risk. publication Tom Cruise chapter rejected PR people consequence taken Leah Remini's memoir way better read that: stress chaos \[of Scientology handling everything life\] taking toll Cruise’s staff. church adding work confusion unnecessary.  assistants\] Andrea Michael Doven put many expensive sec checks \[= Scientology interrogations come bill\], lost home. living trailer Malibu.  though, told Michael donate $50,000 \[International Association Scientologists\] make damage done working him. almost caused divorce. staff required work 14 plus hours day. overtime, salaried employees.

I think someone said first big review supposed happen October 27. Something still add up. Feels like going ""mention covid-19 death certificate"" make easier undercount things. yet somehow generates 600 cases... 

will interesting see numbers look like week. significantly drop reported last week it'll good sign fishy business afoot “Every country free speech laws too...”. 

You sure that? 

My point is, let people racist plain sight there’s opportunity public educate them, show love, compassion etc..

I hope think attacking you. I'm informing rules. hours Moderna‘s initial announcement, second mRNA based vaccine enters final trial. Let‘s hope best! LOL. Antibodies provide long-term immunity. None Mrs. Obama’s fault. like 1994 son went kindergarten. Oh NIMBY zoning laws, taxes, regulation, certainly contribute. 

My point disperse Bay Area workers among cities might move to, still won’t enough votes make place San Francisco 2.0. Bay Area insanely high concentration people, happens tech companies there. Plus rents high wages insane, won’t happen without concentration tech companies. That’s really good point people stack deductions, standard deduction way, way itemize. United States' poor response pandemic provided excellent circumstance pool volunteers test vaccine dangerous environment Long con baby! Yeah, that's rather silly excuse. pretty much makes traitor impossible anyone would use excuse. plausible difference person declares enemy betray trust way someone covertly. money goes cops start fining people fined need make loss speeding ticket revenue due fewer people driving.

-Just bad cops extraordinary reach, especially there's many cases consequences actions.

Having rudimentary knowledge something means knowing enough understand works without able tell exact processes take part it. Like knowing there's cell whose function remember pathogens produce antibodies remembering name it.

You literally google *cell remembers produce antibodies* find several sources diagrams explaining cell works prove saying correct. declaration possesing rudimentary knowledge argument invalidates person self admitted limited knowledge thinks knowledge good enough declare everyone disagrees wrong.

That's egocentric point view believes unless expert talking, can't wrong. even actual inmunologist came explain you, probably still find reason call bullshit. stated fact, could looked confirmed true deny false. Instead trying make point ""lack knowledge"" trying minimize certitude unwarranted.

It's not. even confirmed previous comment. I'll even link pages explaining said correct certitude free citing sources believe incorrect promoting I’m arguing antibodies all, person rudimentary knowledge subject shouldnt pass sweeping judgement everyone else full shit.

This exactly **YOU** doing. arguing point, arguing believe people need get degree making point. care subject we're talking much care right others wrong. even dismissing correct knowledge subject fact claimed he's fully knowledgeable guess succinct thing say would “whoosh”

Thanks good start NoFlo really another Southern state. initial difference deaths Sweden Nordic countries probably caused extensive difference community spread late February/early March. four countries put measures place roughly time (week 11). hight country’s peak deaths hospitalization determined community infection rate point time. Sweden’s significantly higher it’s neighbors. 

The slower decline Sweden probably caused lack lockdown, infection rates fell slowly Nordic countries. striking relatively lax measures taken Sweden consistently decrease spread soon put place, quickly stringent measures.

Unfortunately, corporations set fired don’t follow proper protocols. lot major chains ranging Macy’s smallest corporate stores. 

I assaulted work previous job threatened “be pulled counter punched” (in front customers kids), called racist along threatened get fired. using copied fraudulent coupons store chain aware of.
I instructed scan them. manager stuck her, promptly found another job, left store closed covid-19. 


I also sexually assaulted previous job. told, “they’re fun! too. Don’t serious.” 

The corporations protect actual worker unfortunately. many statements seen ""COVID deniers"" now? 

And again, morons give shit problem actually happens them. virus replicates exponentially, don’t people end full load matter start? lighter initial load let’s body get going defenses load becomes overwhelming? question exactly. I’m sure exactly started would check podcast called “Against Rules” Michael Lewis. dives topic really interesting. Chinese health authorities chill whatsoever

""A couple guys seafood plant? Test whole city. Oh, got 4 days it"" Welcome US cases deaths rising nothing done it. ICU beds left mean ED complete shit show Good news! Kim Kardashian hire Ron Perlman shoot home depot Appleton, Wisconsin August 24th, 2003.  Like New Zealand? jealously watch news remember life used like.  important remember US this,WHO technically couldnt strong arm them, like couldnt barge China investigate virus source without permission. serve objectives important winning politically.and that's point different international organisations.


It's American citizens needing US accountable. impossible let government bent down,stay alive, vote out. Fyi, John Hopkins gets data directly state bypasses white house bullshit. That's say data perfect imo reliable WH puts out.

Also - here's page charts graphs based JH data.  [http://rdambrosia.com/staticpages/covid19/covid19-us-state-line-charts.aspx](http://rdambrosia.com/staticpages/covid19/covid19-us-state-line-charts.aspx) 

The cool thing compare states per-capita basis, there's even option group democratic-run states versus republican run ones. Eye opening. college athletes receiving free education. like $2000 dollar scholarships. That’s thinking. anti vaxers know online (from past mom groups) super pro mask.
I’m curious see Covid vacation ready.  MAY MAY NOT. Evidence shows work. Seems pretty clear me. see antimaskers FB. People who, otherwise, thought intelligent enough. reason stay put! live Kansas. mostly removed current case counts, area seeing spike tens cases. social distance acreage! one said identical.

Just someone something atrocious make right someone else something else that's atrocious.

Let's good humans take stand atrocities, regardless committing them. Viral load indicator outcome. people huge viral loads still asymptomatic. don’t know many times people say don’t need antibodies blood avoid infection. Good know still rely Johns Hopkins. wondering today, actually. T(R)ump virus. even used term today Trump still calls ""China Virus"".

No, Donnie. fucking ours, now. party also biggest, currently. fringe ? cause HOUSES STILL DESTROYED HURRICANE MARIA Yeah Ron Perlman... Well china also hiding shit, yeah two wrongs make right.

God damn communist bots downvoting shit expecting people notice. see far then...

Cats go mate / sniff cats.  Dogs get run dogs dog park.

And guess what, go back infect everyone owner's household probably good thing claim that. like that, chances dying significantly went down. It’s covid-19 deaths, it’s deaths pandemic.

I lost brother due heart attack. hospitalized month (mar-April) barred seeing end life. 4 family members, pick one go. hospital broke rules let us 2 people. funeral. know feels like world crumble one hold comfort you? I’ve said subs feels like “out sight, mind.”

My world imploded everyone around complaining bored sad can’t life way used be. never felt alone life. 

Yeah- I’m best right now. seeing counselor regularly trying take care myself. cry nearly every night wish could hug mom. press charges sue work.  needed study this? Ok let’s even try. bust ass kinds injustice one North America change lifestyle feed pills fries. self-control uncontrollable, bother laws? start putting anti-aging shit vaccines then.... EVERYONE benefit, control control. idea NYC's antibody numbers were? NY huge state upstate hit nearly hard state NYC. Trump taken pandemic seriously beginning kept America safe may well deserved re-elected. end day, need people charge effective time crisis.

Of course, big problem hypothetical scenario that, handle coronavirus crisis effectively, Trump would probably needed quite different person altogether actually is. honestly look like ""fork road"" type scenario leader presented two choices and, while, plausible choices might selected. think Trump ever inclination temperament handle effectively. possibilities need considered scenario:

1) people immune reasons previous infections 

2) 20% already infected making 20% society’s infection risk. people social contacts others. Anyone else think must like watch Rome collapse? Exactly.  show us UK Deads/10M population ratio 675, Spain 608, Portugal 168.

For 100 confirmed covid-19 cases UK dies, Spain &lt;8% dies, Portugal recent numbers shows UK average 67 dead per day last week, Spain 2 , Portugal 4.

Even numbers dead might bases different criteria, easy hide dead cases press numbers low.

Conclusion **UK citizens much safer Portugal Spain UK...,** UK citizens prone leave UK infected getting infection abroad.

So government protecting keeping Iberian nations exempt quarantine"" list?

&amp;#x200B;

\*note: Spain numbers highly influenced (negatively) first wave, also low numbers daily dead probably increase due recent situation Spanish regions. report that. including 57 local cases ,41 Xinjiang ,14 Dalian,Liaoning Province,2 Jilin Province ,next Liaoning. Ok, case think test necessary? wait see symptoms stay. Thank advice It’s slippery slope. First ask wear masks private business, gay married robots injecting us mark beast. end? I’ve got ID doc work started hospital patients NAC. wonder possibility said country get *Sanction card* opening America? refrigeration trucks chicken nuggets.... Lately? feel like pretty steady decline 4 years. ending gross mishandling deadly pandemic. told 4 years ago, presidency going end, would shocked me.  axe! hate we're becoming like china. retailers enforcing mask requirements employee safety. really — different saying it’s encouraged? Yep. Almost every cold flu I’ve gotten past five years scraping bottom gas tank days row. mean? they're dead perfectly deescalated great critical thinking/long term thinking, maybe explain us currently 2nd biggest economy world?  reduce infections. Americans literally last ones knowing lmao. Good luck  Thats funny, got positive test back day well. always wear mask public wash hands going out. symptoms like mild head cold. even think COVID lost sense taste smell. might gone I'm recovering well. Everything pretty much gone except cough. worst judgy types Antibody reduction mean immunity disappears. There's study earliest people infected says antibodies drop first stabilize around 6 months, apparently textbook viruses. Scientists know seem fairly confident people get least year immunity. even allergies, way know 100% dont it, even test accurate, positive test trusted, negative.  Think like leprosy treat way it’s killing people lot people fucking wake isn’t fckg obvious might next month, also US domestic international/ It’s possible ball big stop point. People getting roped voting trump using kids targeted pedos, pushing fear suburban housewives ever growing conspiracies. Don’t forget bots retweet tweeting lies trump. Yep understand centerfolds *fantastic.* It’s probably fact NYC currently empty. city times last week barely anyone homeless people. Trump Putin. That's kinda point...Im sure hospital Pinellas referring TGH ER admitting way fewer patients need urgent care due obviously reallocate resources space deal covid patients. saying they're admitting patients boy really need go ER right now. already one family member USA killed selfish inept handling pandemic American government.

Now time ""chill"", friend. cost/benefit mass testing FAR better opening virus ravaging population.

Sick &amp; dying people tend consume spend much healthy, living people. New York sufficient immunity R(t) 1 current behavior circumstances. open things up, could lead increase R(t) back 1.  round prayers finally trick

Maybe time, it'll work. Never mind previous times failed.  I’ve working weekly ICU Covid patients since early March haven’t gotten sick yet (knock wood). wonder chances antibodies small exposures. says ""allowed"" to? Protesters block major roads make points every years somewhere US. Ok, stop bad news. Let's hear something positive too. want post follow question Fauci's answer was? you? going ignore comment pretend get called cherry-picking quote entire interview, actually proves right wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: appears took downvote ignore approach. Here's entirety conversation referencing. patience idiots. 

 March 8:*** *There’s lot confusion among people, misinformation, surrounding face masks. discuss that?*  *The masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone else… Right United States, people walking around masks.*  *You’re sure it? people listening really closely this.*  *…There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.*  *And get schmutz, sort staying inside there?*  *Of course, course. But, think masks, think health care providers needing people ill. people who, look films foreign countries see 85% people wearing masks — that’s fine, that’s fine. I’m it. want it, that’s fine.*  lead shortage masks?*  *Exactly, that’s point. could lead shortage masks people really need it.* Likely hit five million week six million less week later trend continues. pint glass common glass. Can't believe getting downvoted. Lmao know want tell “flu worse, wear masks” people? 

“Don’t think people dying bad thing, matter what? going take anything away this, realize wear masks, COVID reduced, colds flu well? Maybe wore masks time month, could eradicate every disease spreads respiration?”

I mean, seriously... go-to argue wearing mask, instead reducing needless death way possible?

Fuck selfish assholes. That's meant imply second sentence. doesn’t matter. could smack anti vaxxer face EBP day claim ‘Big Brother’. Oh, mean herpies? mum? you? k. getting ready move Arizona Washington, diving. anybody provide resources tips safely getting planning quarantining 2 weeks get there, dad lives empty room could stay temporarily would suffice? Godwin repealed law trump administration. point Nazì comparisons accurate longer extremist hyperbole. south, sure fucking did. Maybe round prayers finally trick, virus just...disappear hard hit major cities I've seen stats seem stalled 20%--as say, social distancing. seems like there's something combination level immunity maintenance distancing measures together really key limiting spread. Either really big coincidence 20-25% number keeps coming up! Among certain portions population (essential workers families bore brunt far)? maybe. white collar offices open indoor dining would see herd immunity. issue related AC blowing around air indoors, even gets vents. So, someone infected cough, talk, whatever, blowing AC move infected aerosols much farther would otherwise travel. So... untrained ear sounds lot like Trump wants minimum wage workers get back job quicker, instead staying home two weeks. 

Plus, employers might say positive second test isnt proof enough continue sick leave.

Moving 14 day sick period 10 day also eliminates short term illness coverage many insurance plans would also guess.

Money first, people second. know interacting women? True haha think person might trying make less scared? I’m overweight, I’ll okay? Idk America needs serious facelift. Yes made sound like apocalypse... lol didn’t get much worse headline article honest, tomfuckery, dipshit von clownstick would actually scored points GODDAMN LEADER something instead denying reality. followers would masked dear leader said so, hate still would because, well, science. We’d done this. Fuck guy, every splintered broomstick earth. Fuck guy. Well that's really good news. had, she'd probably prison. US leaving communist-controlled WHO. Theres literally zero reason give data. fascism, violence, disease problem. Fix 'perception problem' magically go away.  need test multiple times give virus time incubate Eww. heros wears capes! Louisiana lot cases early testing available. Every mushroom cloud silver lining. think China's numbers real? bunker boy complaining someone something unfair, he's mad thought first. hates one-upped. good thing many best schools dropping sat/act requirements Crazy cause china many places even reporting numbers Right sentiment! Eh, Ontarians think we're particularly well governed. complain plenty dumb things government here. provincial government actually quite unpopular Covid showed - actually done reasonable job handling it, gained lot kudos even folks otherwise opposed (me one). Imagine second activity 6% fatality rate. example choosing fly 94% chance survive trip. imagine choice whether would partake activity. 6% returned positive result still high. never want mother. don’t want get sucked bullshit mommy culture. gives info testing. would better never met her. ANGRY MAKE ME. surprised NIETHER. It’ll like Logan’s run soon enough. Maybe permanently. Hopefully social security retirement age goes back old people die people enjoy retirement couple years COVID kills Check testing per capita versus rest Africa Deaths unfortunately continue climb. hospitals overwhelmed...they waited long shutdown. Issued Herd immunity impossible. Spain tried it. Antibodies last long people..aka getting again...   So, I’ve thinking this. kids since early March. wanted take drive somewhere could get change scenery. Maybe 3-4 hours total. Trying keep kids together restroom hard. bought WAG bags urine bags gel. It’s idea, really want us stay away people right now. thank you. feels nice acknowledged. Things slowly getting better, over, I’ll come stronger. takes time :/ Make sure it’s reputable manufacturer. biggest difference otherwise seems pressure-rating, ie deep breaths take work correctly. So... make sure rapid-shallow breathing you’ll die respiratory alkalosis instead? I’m somewhat facetious, try take huge deep breaths. we! Thank you! ❤️ They’re 12 hour drive away would probably fine could change definition “quarantine.” Let us real, expecting this. dangerous. November can't come soon enough... 716er well. Masks everywhere Yeah, HEPA filters let covid through, problem air gets sucked filter, still moving covid people way get trapped, least blowing back out. Ok l want offended need grow party rear lying this? look data. saying simply seeing numbers level off, yes, it’s possible Trump suppressing numbers make look like rounding bend actually still going up, say something factually incorrect like this, look ignorant. doesn’t help case. Puerto Ricans Americans. There's really distinction ""Puerto Rican Nationals"" ""Puerto Rican Americans"", country. Nobody shrugged countries hiding numbers, ESPECIALLY US didn’t enough functional tests, millions sick 10s thousands dead. China hide numbers what's point testing again? family Tallahassee, Orlando, Tampa Bay, West Palm. 

They're terrified.  pay, hope. otherwise management suck. Uhhh *shocker* lol Serious question: 


Can sue government hiding data us? Oh well thats different ! hope father law survives  It’s way early declaring victory *anywhere*. NYC hasn’t even fully reopened yet gods sake! I’m 31 getting plane September. Don’t make feel old. aren't. 

They care.   fair, entire R party party projection. True , testing much worse poorer asian countries. Like Philippines 1.2million people tested Japan tested 700k , hell that? I'm going retire myself. Sundays always lower n reported, never found months wait till Tuesday find bad things weekend Oh shut fuck man, USA sabotaged Puerto Rico every turn made disaster even worse them. administration failed  inevitably shut everything down, bitching numbers falling.

Anything today takes 2 weeks take effect + however long takes test (add extra week deaths) started father-in-law who's still ventilator.  work statistics-related field? well read? curiosity; seem quite conversant topic associated research. disagree, couple thoughts specific MS Delta: 1) would curious know many people internet Delta. one poorest regions country went went buildings went even proper plumbing, 2) marginalized people beaten long they're never going trust authority figures. State Decay, State Denial, State Chaos Alaska Airlines. bought tickets trip September middle seats still blocked choosing seat. Get this, also help prevent outbreaks flu, big brain time people. Wow, easy, im gonna stay home permanently Sort positive. Death lagging indicator, things get worse get better. 

It would help Texas better leadership, plan. really sucks. think good 2 weeks stay home, get food delivered time, maybe get Covid test right baby born, could still come stay? (If she’s driving distance, anyway)

Congratulations impending arrival. It’s really tough time welcome baby (and make transition parenthood!). devastating story. interesting deliveries might reason behind exposure. important wipe products. 

In case, sad reality, maybe need terms departure loved ones. know at. know either one us could suffer severe COVID infection. suppose time ""In case happens..."" talk family. I’m tired reading reports like this. many times media report virulent nature one takes seriously?! know I'm stranger internet, heart breaking you. can't even imagine going are. I'm glad seeing counselor. hope wish find peace, time. way establish fact related legal matter like fraud, government certify it. Even involves government fault.

Are fascist? literally fascism describing. Usually prophylactic secondary infection. mean \*ex-friend technically speaking, actually evolve short spans time. see happening animals well us. example, elephants much shorter tusks due evolutionary pressure poachers State run democrat. thought republicans fuck things up?? Lol Well got somewhere.  guess hotel staff prostitute. know what’s painful eyes direct shot pepper spray? shitty website linked. Well aren’t treated tbh wouldn’t want put american umbrella USA fucked many times throughout history. feel awful want best them, wish statehood would help I’m sure right answer Tamiflu, sure said zpack. stay inside, never come contact human, sanitize every item delivered door touching it, avoid serious illnesses. slightly incorrect. current hypothesis without antibodies could get re-infected, b-cell memory able produce antibodies fast enough never get sick, perhaps mildly sick, could possibly transmit disease (unknown time). 

If antibodies, hypothesizing ""sterile immunity,"" can't get infected infect others. paper, yes, there's disagreement there...


*De facto* think mask debate US perfect expression crooked interpretation freedom US. others... KKK 2nd thing comes mind. 


A lot interpretation freedom US related morals responsibility. 


(And supposing somebody uneducated bc think like ,well, say...)


Edit: forgot freedom carry gun...


The following story great: combines freedom interpreted right wear mask carry semi automatic rifle. Responsibilities morals nowhere  need stop fucking animals. mainly protects them. Maybe protects small amt. Definately better nothing.

Its tricky depends type exposure amount. Even Democrats using COVID Trump, Trump governors (especially conservatives) could worked plan fight thing get US back track.

Instead, didn’t step challenge point fear tactics. quote proves lied. cherry picking. matter later said workers need masks. said reason wear masks unintended consequences. lied. Period. want ignore lies pretend like happen also said workers need masks. Compared influenza, Covid-19 kill 10x number people infects low estimate last time saw comparison, fucking flu. Get shit together Florida Yes, think offers protection. may still exposed lower viral load, get less sick.

The best kind masks made layers cotton fabric, like buy etsy. studies showing absorbent. also comfortable cute. Issued feel like people say people don’t go don’t lives people super empty inside entire life social life lack joy themselves. They’re projecting feel onto people choose themselves. country reported unable meet simple deadline.

surely jest Florida, Arizona, Texas good try. find milk shame go together frequently It’s always conspiracy around here. people acting shocked around 400 deaths today. It’s ALWAYS low Sundays. America cared economy lives people. pour essential oils comes shes witch doubt   Last Sunday lower. Sunday even lower. make claim like without looking actual 381

7/19: 412

7/26: 451 Remember wall made using corpses mortar  Well well well isn’t consequences actions. ""We need evidence"" ""here's evidence"" ""NO KIND, NEED EVIDENCE!"" 


K dude. Freedom 35 Nope parents ppl turn say abortions viral deaths combined Covid deaths. Used say flu conspiracy trump. ppl could dying watch family members die still moving goalposts I'm saying good thing, but, finally least get people stop trying say ""it's flu/not even flu"" anymore? wildly inaccurate pains many redditors still misinformed. 
 
MILLIONS New Yorkers got COVID. tested. Antibody tests show us that. 
 
The fatality rate disease changed one bit, since got good data early February. Good rule thumb: multiply number deaths 100, roughly true number infections. Thus, NYC 3M true infection. plenty opportunities enter body mask not...

Like, already proven wearing mask much prevent getting virus (still helps) anything prevents spreading stop bit, 3 months exact. use online proctors? would eliminate that. I'm sure possible cheat could said person tests. university required online proctors online classes 8 years ago equipment likely even better CT 31 states, unless coming air think people asking cross border. lilly pond half full day 29. Good!

Earned full. leader comes mind read title includes ""crimes humanity handling covid-19 pandemic"" misunderstanding common, need apologize. It’s good time read history current affairs island though. We're even 2nd wave yet stuck first wave. Winter coming. trying totally rude LOL yeah, big time south. well established dining restaurants risky. Shopping risky, especially workers. Best practice one person household shops, others stay home.

Eating restaurants shopping known risks. People may things, make safe. Again, much better Facebook social media. Glad see fellow fan outside r/madmen! not. gave information department investigated. None individuals involved case involved investigation preliminary research. 

Because that's kinda US works. People guilty based accusation requires proof beyond doubt. play whole guilt social media game like Gen Z'ers. One difference US Europe though... There's definitely clear line, then. 34 weekers require interventions, even. think that's clearly unlikely stillbirth attributed person died COVID. People large numbers ""outdoor cats"" might spreading it. cats, cats, cats' owners. round detain internment camps.

Its like USA doesnt use fascist methods goals.

You assholes believe torture ffs.... Pretty much. Many make big deal Limbaugh, yet realize celebrities received Medal Freedom. 

You could even argue Limbaugh bigger impact listed. Try bringing conservative radio without people complaining Limbaugh spreads. like TIME's Person Year, recipient always leave positive impression. GPS tracking proves whereabouts Summer, contact tracing show came school. Insurance cover testing cost. get tested week, long covered. turnaround time quick area work. first Covicane experience. Nah shuts won’t reopen Yeah facebook bad cmon, thats people noone else. Fucking imbeciles information would much helpful knowing dude voted Trump 🙄  paid off, sense. got trillion copies extra RNA. Exactly. think speak us say works distribute doses quick enough would beyond relief hang friends family GOP everything accused DEMS ""trying do"".

Death panel, check

Sending feds states, check

Literally murder citizens, check assume mean majority scientists around world convinced naturally occurring virus originate lab.

It's fairly likely originated near Wuhan, although conclusively established possibly never will, engineered humans. take vote interests? Alaska deceivingly low population density paper 50% population lives around Anchorage. little bit community spread right place takes really fuck bad. countries observing decrease death rates per case it? GOP control Germany England, too? poke stick, retarded shit come out? Uh... hyper inflation creates issues. 

This basic economics. 20ish percent them, yes. those, 99% survivors argue lightning dangerous fake news. Trump. Oh alright. get that. However, Limbaugh extremely racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. career made pretty much exclusively spreading views. He's pretty clearly totally different league celebrities. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know John Wayne super racist, least made career acting. Limbaugh's made career racism/sexism/homophobia. Again, think joke celebrities awarded Medal Freedom, there's still pretty huge difference Limbaugh.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, there's also pretty huge difference award given private company award given President. never seen progressive like this...

yeah, I'm convinced economy crash.  ""Some ~~sh~~it others"" Bit *White Plains*? Mask mandate 0 active cases nice preventative tactic, good see since politicians work reactively instead. Shut up. America bad. /s again, believe facts exist outcomes court cases? “Stay home” messaging failing continue fail.

I think would better luck strongly encouraged people family gatherings outdoors masks. 

Telling people go year without seeing family like telling teenagers fuck. You’ll better luck teaching use protection might technically true lockdowns soon March, nearly essential businesses required masks entry. months vaccine broadly available. 4-6 months. “The plot like Bambi, instead getting shot mom went Disneyland licked lamppost.” virus real, feel like using distraction something else. coronavirus something keep “the people” occupied. apart agenda  government denounced expect. Yeah...asking racial thug beatup black guys club something requires level compassion mutual respect community bit much yankee cops.

&amp;#x200B;

All US cops know pull gun child unload 3 mags his/her chest pointing hot dog said police officer. ""I felt threatened."" get court, usual. Thanks speaking up, bummer. I'm southeast can't even get people board masks yet I'm still full stay-at-home. hopeful next phase would include stuff like quarantine travel, guess also works people follow it. Ahh Physicians magical powers can't done testing. hate science? US territory. Forgot exactly means detail hybrid status road full statehood. Returning normal would help, order require vote actually take issues serious opposed pay lip service pass bologna symbolic legislation. Yes governor said penalized underage drinking. not?

More generally, sounds like nobody trouble poor social distancing / curfew? Perhaps, vaccine viable, people focus treatments possible cure, like HIV far know. HIV recently got cure, remember reading. explains theory Italy nurses/doctors getting REALLY sick. viral load high sadly death sentence. Thank defending us. just... go comfort. Florida economy relies tourism.

it's like Pokemon battle rule, Florida's weakness COVID Nothing privileged white mommy. /r/oddlyspecific Hmm... called dickheads? alberta. donated $1000 go fund me.










Big Jk. Like tf would. got 5 it. Meh, I'm already tracked. least I'll get vaccine it. they've cited 6-8x deadly. expecting provide made-up data

but nope, decided ignore it. this, I'm going assume BAD, BAD. anywhere $500 $3k take ambulance (it depends location, various ambulance companies different charges). insurance might cover that, decide dying enough justify it.

Then another $3k basically walk ER. stay get minutes doctor, already looking several thousands.

Many people deductibles, $10k. amount need pay insurance even starts kick in. hundreds thousand plus per month premiums, reached still pay co-pays, insurance still might cover everything (e.g. ambulance) might cover full (e.g. one ER doc saw network, pay 80% bill, $800 five minutes time). Anyway, deductibles, many people would $10k hole ambulance, ER eval &amp; admittance, first breathing treatment. Aye Chihuahua know completely inappropriate, Disney World OPEN!!!!!! Haha Okay. Trump? Middle aged American dudes too. real. name dropping, mention Russian puppet, Trump Ummm… Congratulations ? teenagers get punished judges drinking alcohol USA parents mean kinds trouble? wondering legal situation parents afraid of. Highly recommend checking mathisse thybulles YouTube channel. He’s rookie player Philadelphia NBA team he’s vlogging experience accommodations.

That's trust nobody zombie apocalypse True story: mom seizure one Good Friday 9th grade 6 years ago. Ambulance ride mile, maybe bit more, thankfully wasn’t severe one kill. Anyways, Long story short, cost us 10k pocket including insurance. make matters worse, still paying unrelated investigation dad who’s charged 60$ daily hasn’t hospital 8 years. sucks since rammed first! That’s assault?! poor response US officials calculated purpose.  Well purposely obtuse try ""win"" argument. done you.  might dumb question, I’ve got bad seasonal allergies results lot sneezing coughing. troublesome obviously due similarities Covid symptoms. Usually feel better day recently returned short visit college campus I’m wondering infected. reliable way tell I’m suffering allergies Covid? mask dumb maga followers

Do honestly think saying something like helpful?

Do think maga type read &amp; change mind? think they'll push back?  Common sense? Georgia. Wisconsin. Calling “paper” real stretch. ramblings deranged individuals. Probably assumption due extra hard exhaling running inhaling high rate too. see one would assume higher risk. guess people stop dismissing covid ""oh, even bad seasonal flu""  Yikes. What's going South? death greatly exaggerated. Everybody going working home forever. seems like functional idea first months coasting existing relationships processes built office.

Perhaps straight-up programmer work home forever vast majority getting fatigued set watching chaos lowered productivity grow. that’s existing employees; it’s total disaster new hires.

America baby jails. What's point lol.......ok. Sure. Charge then.  Oh Canada...sigh government. also selfish Americans wear mask. make sure get anywhere near them. husband ordered n95 masks ebay early March. arrived couple weeks ago package China clearly boldly labeled ""THESE PANTIES."" gave seller good rating.

That's started using credit karma lol  mainlander *can* make trade moving there. Yet somehow aren’t many takers. /r/MaskSkepticism yet (WARNING: Safe Braincells) flip side, Trump taken pandemic seriously beginning kept us safe definitely would gotten re-elected. gift wrapped him, could show empathy don’t understand South Africa 5% Africa’s population 52% covid cases. kind difference can’t due testing alone. According video seem taking virus seriously too. made laugh. Hey man dont want mess freedoms Good That’s thing here. I’ve done done me. We’re assholes. 

I’m driver 5 iron Canada, could proximity thing. black excellence Confirmed cases* NY likely well 2 million cases didnt testing capacity Can’t second wave first one never ended. also deaths beside confirmed deaths.

Well, yeah lol. meant without testing that’s way that’s fine. Um, Saratoga county checking in. Mask compliance close 100%. really showing best side lately, America. say ok? smaller initial viral load, virus go replication cycles match larger load, immune system time recognize infection shut down.

It's cellular analog epidemiological principle community starts managing transmission rate (through social distancing forth) infection rate low, going much easier time. thing happened war Iraq racism middle easterners post-9/11 era. Yes!literally hope ruin credit 7 years bounce back. pay 5 years consistently fall face earth. guess insurance company could go court argue ""he covid die anyway"" seems unlikely work.

- [Aging *by FAR #1 risk prevalent diseases: Alzheimer's, stroke, heart disease, pneumonia, cancers, COPD, sarcopenia, osteoarthritis, glaucoma, cataracts, list goes on... 

- example, *[high cholesterol 3x risk factor heart disease, aging confers 5000x see incredible relationship morbidity mortality prevalent diseases, even including age conferring [**~1000x** greater cumulative risk putative risk factors diabetes lung disease paltry 2x risk factors 

- already know COVID-19 results non-respiratory related morbidity/mortality, systemic involvement [neurologic, renal, hepatic, cardiac, endocrine, GIT treatment provides improvement multiple aged organ systems would therefore extremely valuable

- health implications targeting fundamental aging biology allows us treat dozens age-related disease simultaneously, potential treatment COVID-19 drugs could also address dozens age-related diseases [common comorbidities People need get real virus first. maybe deal second one. sleep night monster? usually don’t vote talk politics often. prefer speak things I’m well versed in. However, point it’s hard look current president say actual fuck. horrible....but know song like lyrics! also I'm sorry.... hard navigate stupidity government officials around keep loved ones safe....to part, beyond, try make aren't. MADA! I’m still flying current scientific consensus it’s still safe enough. follow Fauci.

I flight canceled early March visit family desperately want see several risk family members it’s worth it. friend goes restaurants takes flights, don’t agree them. 🎶🎶whooooo yoouuu?? Whoo whooo..whoo whooo🎶🎶 thinking US we’re hotspot right now. Anyway safe travels next month. kidding me? Comparing Chinese Japanese, cleaniest ppl world? Here’s video Shanghai Disney, 1:11 Chinese parents pull world famous “let kid pee floor” stunt. can’t make shit Why? guys get invited parties? let name restaurant slip somewhere reddit. get brigade time. probably situation getting lot worse already was. Like, cases ramping up, situation eerily similar situation NY.

You good man wanting help people, many people earnestly want believe America's Bill Rights. many blatant exceptions thrown government feels like it. land free, home brave, breeding ground stupidity Lol. We’re almost Yikes imagine thinking viable comeback not. That's idiotic. leaked it'd still bat virus. Viruses jump species virtue getting lab. easy. horible loooong time denial paying shit fucking hate Please note comment holiday travel general, UKs decision quarantining Spain returnees. 

Low equal UK doesn’t mean save standards. 

The problem virus tends aggregate clusters. Spain currently 2/3 larger clusters rest relatively low numbers.

Now imagine, however, people different parts country, meet holiday hotspot (eg Benidorm etc). inadvertently people clusters mix together place, thus creating new bigger cluster virtually revolving doors new tourists arriving leaving. 

It takes infected people, coming bigger cluster’s area, start new cluster. infect local staff, e.g barkeepers etc, turn circle infections spread around. 

When people country visit, infections might long left local staff keep infecting new tourists, bring around parts country. 

One better examples happening Ischgl Austria. original infected long left, infected staff kept passing virus new tourists, ultimately contributing largely (but means solely) spread across Europe. 

That why, general 14 day quarantine returning travelers really mandatory like asian countries. I’m wandering bear, I’m hibernating, usually found sniffing around random campsites impersonating famous cartoon bears (just fun). don’t usually worry much covid wander around well, I’m wandering bear. Jesus haven’t seen site since hair balls  hell news anchor star effect filter. local news turn Turkish karaoke video? Many Canadians can’t even get Atlantic bubble. welcome believe suppose, heard single democrat running president, ever, even come close implying want become dictator like Trump clearly aiming for. agree general politicians pretty shitty hard imagine so, republicans seriously trying best take next level bullshit.

Not mention pretty weird go ""well, current guys clearly twats, guys would too, I'll stick current twats guess"". make sense stick status quo that's obviously terrible. USA left WHO. Maybe worn mask baseball game worst test pass. Republicans deny science I’m sure type thing exists Centrism worthless spineless position take. Shit important fence.  Congress Republican power remember correctly expect since testing full swing NY going worst phase, infections NY diagnosed. un-diagnosed infections among people mild asymptomatic cases.   getting this? CDC website says 969 new deaths July 26. According [this new antibodies contract infection clears recover 70% previous levels. specific IgM-S/N became undetectable 12 weeks disease onset patients, IgG-S/N titers showed intermediate contraction phase, stabilized relatively high levels six months observation period. late time points positivity rates binding neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies still 70%. **Taken together, data indicate sustained humoral immunity recovered patients suffer symptomatic COVID-19, suggesting prolonged discussion rapidly declining humoral immune responses provoked broad media attention, raising doubts anxiety feasibility vaccine development immunity infection. Based data, appears humoral immune response SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic COVID-19 patients rather prototypical viruses early expansion phase followed intermediate contraction phase sustained memory phase. Analysis terminated observation period earlier study, extrapolated long-term trend based contraction phase without considering determining memory/consolidation phase, bear inherent risk come over-pessimistic conclusions concerning durability humoral immune responses SARS-CoV-2 infection. lol, stop dreaming bro, wish US like China now. China nearly 0 new domestic cases several months now, basically EVERYTHING re-opened, schools, movie threatres, malls, restaurants etc... think night clubs remaining closed right now. 

China never skipped beat terms reporting data WHO. Whether believe data another story, never late. pertussis vaccination wore 16 (now 28) worst experience entire life. Get shots folks, wish worst enemy. Telling people leave seems unhelpful. jobs, family, connections, relationships? makes places better?

Saying “just leave” way broad brush. Money = important health?  Wtf... Cascadia subduction zone putting bid. Obama less power Trump? Regressed? shown true colors? political centrist can't tell difference Democrat Republican. may centrist US, certainly comparison Western Democracies. “Preliminary calculations Australia found average years life lost per person 17 years men 14 women.” accused might might done thing accused. sure hell done himself. know, cant control everyone internet... seem control issues.

Like what's point can't get results fast enough? could infected thousand people know it.   Wow could little bit triggered?

Project   Wow like China. would've thought That's pretty low bar. 

It'd better, still sizeable chunk Americans refuse change aspect way live cultural selfishness. probably still Republican Govs going he's Dem. still economic engine driven consumerism, first sign bending we'd probably ended soon reopening order try kickstart consumption US economy needs survive. also cost zero dollars extra.

Location, camera, sound, anything would indication phone user could see. gave phone hold laptop heartbeat it. know that's hard made point.  Another important take away restriction testing within 90 days positive test. 

Antibodies initial infection cause positive result within 90 days therefore test second possible infection time period cannot used conclusively prove second infection.

This means frontline workers returning work within 10 days positive test unable tested show symptoms following 80 days. anyone see guidance secondary Covid infection suspected 90 day period? stupidly wrong, even laboratory confirmed cases US last 15 days 50 times higher 0.007%. Plus real number probably 10X higher account asymptomatic people mild enough stay home never get tested. factor 500 mean people actively sick moment. pretty much vaccines work...

tiny dosage, built antibodies, immune bit/while/ever  leaving to? Coming closed minded rural area, attest, can't really fathom depth ignorance leave get perspective. Remember Paulie Shore, Old Timer? They're like that, act. referring secret police, lying statistics, sacrificing greater good favor profit. Toyota flu sucks ass. got day Christmas fuckkkk could barely walk can’t even think straight u get shitty ass dreams every time u close eyes didn’t sleep day flu Around 3-4 months, tops? really mean **internal** numbers perfectly correct. locked people going better.

I agree better sub accused Feb. like, never TRULY know good/bad internally.  there's possible solution- high-powered potent pepper sprayers distributed retail employees.

No.  Imagine lowly rapist yes, natural space people canada spread locations are... life saver. left property year **admit** one. charges even accusations brought individuals involved working case. could play ""what if"" weren't. making assumption implying individuals also guilty corruption. last question unreasonable. answer it? yes, answer then. big deal Real see little evidence protests spread coronavirus U.S.

It’s “narrative”, it’s numbers actually show.

Most large spread events happening among groups people indoors. (Big family gatherings, churches, bars, restaurants, etc.) 

Most demonstrators wearing masks, actual *gas masks*/filtered respirators point.

Get it. fear may spur super super-spreading. libs, all. wondering too. I’m moving apartment next month kind worried! think people oddly obsess fictional awards much Reddit.

That said, wish give you. see point, guess deserved die. /s Many hospitals simply discharge patient 14 days show symptoms, register others recovered 14 days tested sick home.
The “recovered” figure always puzzled me. That's rather interesting. Compare numbers Massachusetts Texas, basically not-for-profit hospitals left owned religious institutions:

 insinuating worthy banned? Surely 100% true masks prevent disease, allow forum people provide alternate points view. mean, wrong, run things talk about.

What afraid of? Wow :l AC? Possibly, someone catches covid tries isolate room. air circulate around. That’s spreads well apartments. 

Your neighbor’s AC won’t impact though live house isn’t connected. There’s lot wisdom saying “there nothing new sun” Quick correction, Modesto county seat Stanislaus County. 

Everything else stated could even considered modest.    Good. dead people don’t shop. #MaskOn Yeah, get UK already hit peak seems gotten control whereas USA still exponential growth curve. USA far cases per capita can't stop it, we'll eventually deaths per capita too. Would disagree? Cyka blyat  hate argument! coworker repeatedly said I’m giving freedom I’m living life I’m not...eating inside restaurants going bars? Absolutely true, stop painting big brush like that. deals absolutes? wrong.......I Canada, trust me, market cornered idiots; too..........but much minority. People generally ""get it"" here. guess show Democrats that? That's thinking. immune system first detect based bunch randomly generated antibodies. one finds presents cell capable making antibody, start amplifying antibodies it.

If starting single replicating virus immune system detect average replicated 1,000,000 copies, much worse started dose 1,000,000. bad 1,000,000x1,000,000, density makes easy detect (density\*time), say instead immune system detect 1,300,000 copies. 30%+ higher peak load time immune system grows response.

If masks cut large droplet spread, could tons virus particles, leave behind near-aerosol regime, could anticipate kind thing following pattern like that. made numbers though, need work see big effect would expected.

Fever inflammation also let immune system detect earlier temperature increase increases molecular interaction rate antibody search, inflammation allows larger immune cells area get presented antigens begin making antibodies. might get fever inflammation earlier small dose large, time virus count N, smaller initial outbreak time damaging cells longer even though virus count patients, mean inflammation signals amplified more, increasing detection rate. would die flu likely died coronavirus. lol keep assuming everyone defends Indian govt bot. Fucking retardation bad we're stuck every country locked us lmao I'd love leave we're fucked. Fat fat, still life. Sometimes think stories not-that-distant history— witch burning, blood letting, human sacrifice— think “man, behaviors different thinking today’s society far off”. don’t even know facts. happened Cuomo. Let people gone hospital pre-symptomatic back homes. NY limited capacity following guidelines White House reason keep “healthy” people hospital would risk Covid vs sending home. people came back caught Covid hospital issues. That’s happened. US desperately weak everything except military strength. 

This crisis hopefully wakeup call jingoistic excessively patriotic Americans glorious superpower badly behind almost everyone else metrics affect actual lives. Yeah ""secret police"" badges names them. Stop watching much CNN Yup lot people still going 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ I'm surprised banned every country now. quite; Mono County Sierras pretty liberal. Everywhere else state, yes. even that. Imagine Trump leaned hard xenophobia nationalism. Imagine riled every racist saying China finally attacking us. time Trump warning do-nothing Democrats love China.

Then supporters would social distanced, went masked, sacrificed country spite chinese.

I’ll never understand trump didn’t this. Covid slam dunk 2020 win somehow Trump fucked up.

Silver lining Biden elected...but still, it’d nice 150,000 people dead. could safely opening schools, workplaces would open, could see family semblance safety. .... New? That's true can't remember start year blur let alone last Monday . like IRL twilight zone episode extras.

Sociopaths somehow feel better reason feel empathy. case “she’s overweight” reason. 

As 1/3rd kids aren’t overweight... it’s ok die. Sports escape big portion population. think MLS right playing 1 location. US still control seems safer teams travel country. They're colony US. ginger.  Masks filter viral particles. Even get some, won’t get much would didn’t wear mask. lower viral dose, less severe symptoms be. Wat easy get high % absolute numbers lower. sealand would absurdly high murder rate 100% people still there. Bet super proud exploits. Good job junior, moron. exactly mean ""cooperate"" Fuckin’ right can't. base still whatever does. states, base makes breaks election. clearly tell states need base Reps win primary major election defiant him. may true state, live United states commonwealth, state. commonwealth massachusetts, profit systems alive well. republican governor follows science hates populism. Remember days? Pepperidge Farms remembers. pretend know anything virus, go experts tell me. sound like one idiots think they're experts googled something half hour. march nobody really knew think unless epidemiologist still know Coincidence, probably less virulent strain/mutation virus? I'd buy dollar! Explain? Like, specifics Cuomo mishandled New York's response? nursing home issue bad, learned deadly Covid elderly, believe even stopped putting Covid patients nursing homes (correct I'm wrong that).  Simpson's Paradox. need look data state country level aggregate country level.

Edited clarify years ago happened. still can't medicine anymore day. case drug rash, unfortunately. Actually flu go 650-800k usually, said every year 150k 800k, depending strain could go worst spread us 2-3 times higher  Like whole /r/China_flu, though definitely take numbers pinch salt. Still legit countries though. helth super healthy fit hospital doctor 30s end ventilator dead:

I've read medical studies discredited viral load theories early pandemic. think latest discovery defective gene producing key interferon virus actually makes sense versus everything we've witnessed far. course, possible previous theories pass testing (like viral load) control gene defect possible matter people defective gene. hello sand. head. willing excuse anybody.

When looking data, however, look context. New York hit early much data today (we significant amount data time, however). 

Did NY leadership right thing? No, opinion. look place like New York City compare city place like Arizona, zero excuses. like comparing apples oranges.

Population density, housing types density, mass transit completely different.

The amount data available recently much greater before. Plus everyone learned NY (and Spain that, Italy that, China that).

Although believe NY mishandled, obstacles success NY challenging.

Places like Arizona, Texas, Florida willfully jumped cliff following selfish, inept, ignorant leaders. constant supply? Gone morning? Seen, heard? kitchen? don’t appear arguing good faith willing admit you’re wrong.

where think Bold assume Trump ""allow"" us elections.  I'm sorry go around labeling people criminals without sufficient evidence court trial. freedom imprisonment weak case fascism? exact opposite. Fascism would letting express opinion guilty. said free opinion absolutely every right it, legal reality wrong. would rather 100 guilty people go free lack evidence 1 non guilty person put away went ""well maybe it"" option. logic innocent men death row.

So anyone acting violently, her, would true year ago anyone heard Covid-19 , social distancing, anti-maskers.  commonly find Republican party (as well various ""news networks"") accuse people something illegal unethical pretext wrongdoing. words, they'll accuse someone something (that they're usually actually doing) thing seen okay ""fair-game"" since Democrats already never got caught punished (even though didn't).

This justification used every instance voter-suppression outright voter fraud perpetrated Republicans-- payback stuff believe Democrats already did. Texas trying Stupid Florida. Texas number one! Yeah I'm passports paper can't safely go anywhere without getting exposed, let us country. Bro, freedumbz. Nowhere else many freedumbz. used married guy like that. going better come November.

That's like entire population Arizona dying. John Hopkins gets state data states. get feds. port storm ¯/\_(ツ)_/¯ Ooh, juicy! asked provide facts cannot. Logic means nothing unless provide substantial supporting evidence. no, population density necessarily mean cases. Seoul greater population NYC yet numbers fraction NYC's. 

Americans disease control capability due Trump's willful ignorance ""my freedom important life"" mentality. Nobody's calling China hero, sure hell better job containing COVID compared countries. US intelligence detected mobile signals going lab Oct 6 Oct 11. 

What kind accident exactly picturing here? doesn’t make sense lab shut long something like this. 

Even making big prep virus, amount concentrated virus would would measured milliliters. Even spilled whole thing floor, need bleach wipe couple paper towels carry day. worst case scenario centrifuge accident aerosolizing virus, even solution let things settle day, bleach shit everything wearing mask. even then, would affect one room centrifuge, whole area building (labs like built restrict airflow BSL3 areas) It’s complicated drawn process.

That's awesome. happy done 3 years, can't imagine 5. Enjoy career random internet friend! Possibly false negative. Possibly someone quarantine well have. Possibly picked contact supplies. possibly new disease know everything transmitted yet. highlights fact take extreme precautions dealing something fully understand.

If reaction public health measures save *their children*, requires cloth mask months, think fight climate change, require much fundamental changes daily life. whole species dumb save itself. Bars, concerts, parties, weddings (even outdoors) kind ""fun"" social gathering people require good mental health spreads most. Protests, social justice activism, riots, etc. spreads least, especially people shoulder shoulder yelling. don’t watch baseball Again...that's literally AIDS is. could even look wikipedia help this. I'm guessing 5th 6th grade? Yea live Hudson Valley rural town everybody wears mask here. seems like something someone would say live here. I'm Red hook, Rhinebeck, Poughkeepsie, Kingston Clarmont towns ppl wearing masks ""It's flu bro"" folks say now? Ah, okay.. We're one family BBQ, church service, small town festival, farmer's market weekend, crowded barber shop afternoon, busy restaurant night away local outbreak.

Let's hope come that. Well sucks. Wonder remaining baker’s dozen feel guilt. at. all.

Edit: Correction, non baker’s dozen covid party. wonder managed BBQ virus still feed everyone. Oooohh one people lol. Nevermind. Agree disagree. Devil gave covid. facebook two friends NYC Floirda speak. One Miami beach. quarantine come back? Probably not. learned nothing March. baffling.  paper ACT locations offer online test proctoring? enough evidence warrant bringing trial would required to. legal contractual obligation working States Attorney. Failure dereliction duty would result dismissal least comes charges impeding lawful investigation, tampering evidence, witness tampering, perjury. vacationing Hawaii. back Florida remembered lockdowns strict beginning. really sucks managed slow spread exponential growth. hate say think hurricane would good southern states right now. south people take hurricanes really seriously stay indoors. they’d virus.... Thanks detailed reply. I've London 10 times life always loved there. much better large American city, digress... I'm Florida amazes cases entire UK exponential growth end sight. Let's see remember correctly. Everything's gone higglty piggledy, hopefully soon Tickety boo :) Ignoranus = Dumbass old people going isolate rest lives? poor parents :(. NYC resurgence? fit theory? lockdowns work well need keep them? kind makes sound like work.

I live NYC everything people Reddit say done lockdown - mass mask compliance, almost everything closed, empty streets, etc. still spread two months. disease FFS care restaurant vs. house Walmart vs. nightclub, mask on, apparently, since people wearing mask hears March 20th 25th, even though mask order started weeks after. more, least star players. strong sense college football canceled season, soon after. doesn’t! research!! Mr. Katz number times discussion.

Nope. yea also lot evidence antibodies test arent capturing whole picture regards immunity, many missing lot immune people either antibody levels low detection dont depend antibodies immunity.

so well may gotten close sort herd immunity. witnessed similar sharp decline cases hard hit areas. cannot remember past condemned repeat it. (George Santayana, Life Reason, 1905) Every sperm sacred. discouraging people getting tested second time recover.

CDC trying solve testing shortage eliminating demand  everyone wants talk position knowledge, even you, bad thing, ""same affirmation seeking match beliefs everyday actions.

and want live life contrary beliefs? mean moral beliefs religious really bad thing?

but get point... religion bad thing preach something contrary, like person outside religion topics yeeeeeeeeeep. q-tard wasteland imagine info Russians spreading. people completely ignorant able reliably research scientific information own, would hold hand, show evidence, claim science real since goes facebook memes.

Why hold degree Harvard order passing along scientifically backed safety information others taken seriously? Even folks would still deny it.

As say... “You can’t fix stupid” Don’t change title. actually good article provides data shows factors much better correlated cities seen case spike protests. data goes would love hear it.

According article others, fact virus doesn’t spread well outdoors, particularly people wearing masks many protestors are. Keep mind people become infected 6 feet apart wearing mask poorly ventilated building. Social distancing isn’t be-all end-all. protests sometimes keep people home going bars higher risk places. factors nothing “media narrative”. Ontario paragon good governance. across border looks superficially identical US, yet America full itself/stupid take lesson place answered 4/5ths perennial problems. Locations check out. Gives zero fucks checks 😷🤒 That's called Swiss cheese theory, 1 layer protection sufficient. There's many ""holes."" second layer social distance. 3rd layer duration, on.

No *single* solution work, stacked one layer top another, eventually nice thick stack Swiss cheese that's 99% *hole-less*. Yet it’s brought constantly sub. read dude’s aunt twice removed definitely infected twice even though millions infected there’s data shows proof reinfection, happen, dude. happens time. YUP.

A lot people really idea much propaganda consume. took 30 secs find, lazy infection rates new tests 33 states. minimum wage worth risking lives. Yeah, definitely getting though. I'd say London could probably air con now, gets pretty unbearable summer sometimes. 

Trouble is, average house Britain built 1914, thus half houses built then. tend solid walls cavities, there's nowhere run ducts retrofit air con. say 1130 new cases one day ""beat"", apparently.

Nope. 

A) countries beat it

B) decreasing case load

C) deaths tending toward 0. much going cost them? Make America flood awful? humans. It’s fault live country insane medical costs. thanks, want listen person fantasizes killing dismembering kids regular. healthy. 

I keep mask (and wear it) wherever go! humanistic, patriotic plain common sense United States accounts nearly quarter deaths. Nazis blaming jews losing world war Worldometer adds 6K deaths onto NY death count. #s trusted? results take time. time get results probably chances pick up. That's good know! I've lucky could really happen us. Looks like takes lot time effort diligence comb.

By way photos heartbreaking, words. i’m not, take mask then. don’t wanna work, don’t get paid. Simple that, teach online instead school Everyone wrong. sense thag didn’t understand exponential growth saying 2 weeks wrong! 2 weeks gets worse, 2 weeks way worse, 2 weeks that... :) R0 measles reported 12 - 18. highest estimate I’ve seen COVID-19 5.7 earliest days Wuhan. going poop public, please dig hole first, unless runny explosive. SARS MERS also coronaviruses immunity lasts years. 

If, perhaps, severity illness factor immune response longevity, might expect one somewhere middle. case, there's clearly range outcomes virus family. Covid closely genetically related SARS, believe. Plus new study showing antibody levels plateau around six months rather disappearing. 

I'm cautious, worried.  accurate magnitude 30-50% \[I studied accuracy tests end..just snippets\]

Is false negative % inaccuracy false positive %?  That’s false comparison lot levels I’m sure know. % Positive affected significantly due backlog (it'd actually higher backlog due symptomatic people tending prioritized hospitals running labs). Number tests remained largely constant reported cases begun drop, positive trend. also see beginnings flattening hospitalizations, although early tell. UVC lighting, addition standard filters, become standard AC units IMO. Education. lack thereof. people probably know test results period ends. shortsighted goals point. could office months. sense person loves victim anything else. gets play victim angles. cost insurance $80000 13 days hospital. paying around $2000 since met yearly pocket ($6000) cost. can't imagine without insurance insured. There's also underlying racial tension that's apart country since beginning.   always take one inconvenience overcome another, America usually something consumerism. Well said, agree 1000%. Trump crook early life. read Google. there.  deaths rising breaking records.  especially low COMPARISON cases - death ratio past Sunday. That's point they're trying make. following rise evident past Sundays not. That's concern provide They're supposed last forever. That's memory B cells exist. Agree approach btw. Good luck!

I personally cautious, think government mandate quarantine earlier come back overseas + compulsory masking earlier. hope cases goes neighbourhood countries. know whole lot Kentucky politics, always thought pretty red. Democrat governor anomaly or...? I've impressed I've read Beshear's handling this. totally right America’s greatest country history humanity. increasing weekly everywhere except Vermont Yeah cause trump gaslighting, projecting, asshole blood hand  Yeah. policy biased ways might obvious everyone, ambiguous - sure people might accept ""don't discuss governments"", disconcertingly wide swaths population consider existence virus political. examples clarify much this, feel actual intent (which seems extension rule 8) could messaged vastly better. Wow president next. Fuck Donald. Correct. careful accounting experts still left us somewhere around 1 percent fatality averaged beginning, trending closer 0.5 recent cases. Nowhere near 6  Look big brain Brad. USA though news good news?
Until you’re ER getting intubated. got opinion form research presented NYT journalists... almost responded long drawn apology even noticing country’s economy rest solely shoulders, don’t even live there. recognize Taiwan independent state. mouth piece China. 

WHO tweet Jan 14th: ""Preliminary investigations conducted Chinese authorities found clear evidence human-to-human transmission novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified #Wuhan, #China.""

Fuck WHO. Fuck China. one other. temporarily sacrificing economy personal freedom, US suffer economy, human lives freedom many months years. China opposite. isn’t ironic, don’t think?  Texas entered chat... Lol. don’t know thinking Master Yoda. Coronavirus particles small caught them, every air handler designed take them. Ah old brainwashed it’s like flu? Theres ton make sense like gop purchase masks listed building maint something like food high amoutn money problem 1976 Buckley v. Valeo court case legalized bribery calling ""campaign donations"". 

Pretty much every modern problem stemmed fact rich people America government that's Buckley v. Valeo. nothing else positive done every regard. Climate change? Oil industry money. Cheaper drugs? Big pharma money. Legalizing substances? profit prison money.

Trump symptom broken system. People yearned answer right willing tell wanted hear.

Going back ""normal"" without unending Buckley v. Valeo (and Citizens United) put right back system gave Trump. need push past low threshold ""being better Trump"" better last 50 years. Lol ""now"" I'm Shocked. *Shocked*, tell you!

/s OK yeah sounds like torture Oh ok. Thanks insight! 5g suppositories. Yeah obviously mean we...became China??  Hmm thinking geopolitics level ASEAN curious eg Europe East Asia management. think consensus open one point among countries, recent new cases hitting us. time worried economy take bad hit again. manage balance that's tricky. discovered under-reported adjusted numbers upwards People thinks hoax really reaching omfg  lot countries simply testing capacity south Africa they're basically richest country africa I'm mistaken Republicans senate failed us refusing impeach him. Whatever happens next fault welcome follow redditting last 12 years, it’s there. last six months don’t think you’ll see anything bothers one bit. It’s care conspiracy theories paying attention enough see doctors China start break silence late December go web warn world. 
 I’m lucky enough taught critical thinking child, hear enough stories family members witnessed pieces history. started path conspiracy theorist 1981, grandfather’s war stories match text book school. stories since validated hard evidence, tend reserve judgment weather official story truth match other.
It’s probably big piece didn’t believe US government said masks work. could see Asia lot success them, done research years ago 1918 influenza quarantines helped long-term health economy US cities enacted them. True. Lmao work industry, got laughed months ago told peers possibility, UVC lights become industry standard Air Handling Units. Who’s stupid enough want sneak back N Korea? avoid large amount deaths even bit worth it. easy. already preventions flu atleast understand it, covid. Hi. Young adult. Got covid. body absolutely fucked 5 months later.

Can't walk treadmill 10 minutes.

Thanks. kindly fuck off. got drain? New cases down, number tests reported roughly constant (slightly near level new cases). % positive hospitalizations flattening out. want start Well, way past bedtime, poppet. amazing people believe belong cult. come click state NJ worldometers, bunch counties show data yesterday? There's bunch counties counted daily count cases, like everyday check. Executive Producer Larry David RemindMe! 2 months  trust China. China's neighbours reported less cases imported China Europe US. work way. all. People trying list causes covid related looking reverse.

Why think people would go far check motorcycle accident victim covid-19 not, alter cause death make country look worse?

Stop denial. number go everyone honest. Back February, said wearing masks cause illness...... Buy European...😏 ( shameless plug here) mice wear mask? Good stuff! Again??? That's twice week! funny White House Muricans still claim China hiding numbers mislead, fact China started massive strict quarantine blockade world stop spreading, let along building hospitals rapidily mandatory mask wear requirement, done FREAKING EARLY JANUARY front world's attention, one believes thinks hoax reason accuse China ""barbaric/dragonic/asian desease/violating human-rights"" basically nothing, comes March blow faces suddenly becomes ""China lied us""

&amp;#x200B;

typical Trumpians' logic due testing countries tests. He's trying suppress vote he's setting conversation loses he'll blame rigged mail ballots honestly remember last time cold.. Runny nose, sore throat, body aches, anything..  mom ran daycare house first 16-18 years life. I'm thirty taking sick day really hard can't seem get sick.  

Then again.. stick fingers mouth wash hands often touching things public Never underestimate willfully stupid people be. USA like China, Brazil Russia? wonder Good, there’s chance doesn’t become type mega virus. interesting news still preliminary. one proteins (at least 16 according article) virus has. doesn’t seem like specific antiviral would prevent protein job. find one, would need shown safe humans/other animals, effective would broadly (e.g., work person never infected, work severe cases, would work long term would virus find way infecting perhaps using another one proteins). Lots sure! getting harder care Texas. People need straight leave state common sense I'm MA, recently implemented actual fine quarantine violations. supposed fill form coming certain states (most US, except bits northeast). assume might check you?

The thing is, idea they'd check anyone actually fills form, especially cases people generally live and, say, travel FL come back. Lyft drivers right refuse service? Also wild got arrested one called police. never happen white women wrongfully calling cops black people stories? Clearly medical advances dramatic. study leeches? Good job keep up. vacation SC blown year we've thinking going upstate (I'm North Jersey). think Northeast made good enough habit mask abide guidelines feel comfortable coming up, knowing whether visitor resident, everyone respects respects virus. Life stop. need everyone page careful respectful. assholes country could realize that....  im wet blanket

im explaining high risk lot friends arguing deadly thought would can't live bubble forever. Clearly heard Iran Victorian “people Victoria”. Unfortunately falling deaf ears Kansas. Glad Governor listens him. wish legislature would stop petty local leadership would step enforce mask mandates. People might take seriously then. Kentuckian here, I'm gonna copy paste I've said another thread.

Beshear walking thin line damn good job it. imagine wants shutdown bars, reasons waiting (I guarantee shut within week). Daniel Cameron (Our Attorney General) recently attempted to[ prevent remove executive actions related maybe taking consideration. want bars shutdown immediately well. kept me, family, friends safe far, I'm gonna trust him. Cases hospitalisations also lower Sunday Sunday Sunday 3 weeks ago. point? rising cases follows rising infection rates course case lower last month Sundays would reflect that. abusers bullies work. kind horrifying seeing certain tweets Facebook rumors predictable administration's next moves are. I've seen really bad misinformation subreddit. lies misinformation direction, making covid sound much worse widespread actually cherry picking worse cases. according logic, subreddit banned well. Also, believe people fake bots questions stupid. someone says wear mask gets 5K upvotes - way people coming upvoting stuff.

Again, ask, believe things ""propaganda"" (which really rich posting here), stuff wrong, problem people reading it.

Have read anything r/coronavirus? gets made fun rest reddit people say many things wrong get upvoted. kind data definitely useful though, also used evaluate effectiveness choices made.

*Blind* partisanship encouraged, picking party based results leadership seems prudent.

Of course, still information, individual contextualize &amp; understand consequence state leadership, consequence national leadership, simply unavoidable. also question economic impacts, central discussion steps moving forward really clear well passed. point withdrawing right, enable cover-up. spreading fake news slander WHO? remember claiming warned H2H transmission email ""email"" revealed full things China already publicly reported asking info.  Perhaps normalizing means, “since president doesn’t seem care 150,000 people died four months, must means it’s big deal. Let’s get life”. 

No sympathy morons. I’d say let go kill health care workers deal it. GET. OFF. FACEBOOK.

It’s literally killing us country. too. ball big money too. whole demanding people come absolutely criminal me. Let work home. shoes parent younger kids, I'd see maybe 3 4 friends go out, could bubble, rotate teacher previously majority funded USA mean. Sticking head ground effective treatment, least can't cough anyone mouth full topsoil, ending chain transmission. would still effective control method administration put forward. Reminds “Cigarettes Chocolate Milk” Rufus Wainwright. Like Senate? turned homework two months! vast misconception covid kills old people primarily 

in america kills fat people primarily

to me, nuance needs shouted rooftops want people take seriously

""most kids seem immune"" bullshit So.... pulling shit ass? Got it. We've seen dozens far. Maybe they've affected people's view. become tribal, team sport. People believe point clearly capable seeing objectively. interesting know that. I'm pregnant still useful know. Testing slowed down. taking two weeks get results people bothering get tested. 

1,128 today's 1,973 reported cases (57.2%) tests done July 9-13. go prison this. mean it. okay ask made worth move here, kind place moved from? appealed you? I've lived entire life rarely seen good things guess maybe could help. want know too. 

I know someone wants move good country EU keep saying probably bad idea. They're thinking closer think let go guilt I'd feel. know that's thing yeah. feel I'm selfish wanting well. 

That personal lol. 

I understand rather answer. I'm interested objectively too! Turn news now.   statement is: “durrrr” Yup. real reason outbreak, mask nonsense came months later, it’s easy virtue signal former opposed latter. US needed fully shut January. international travel, interstate flights. NYC already hotbed months shut March medical professionals report cases essentially spread fast here. People would still take subways interact thousands people day result.

Then get poorest poor live 5-20 600 sqft apartment can’t socially distance. add poorest forced still work essential jobs like cleaning cooking even afford place food etc continues spread.

All could prevented shutting signs first started showing months later “first confirmed case” nonsense. needed stopped educated international cities first prevent backwoods morons can’t damn thing right making exponentially worse. It’s honestly I’ll never champion Cuomo like many do, response directly responsible thousands deaths. I. Am. Shocked.

Hey everyone. Send r/fuckmasks love me. Isn’t wine spoiled juice? two weeks me. carried back bed bathroom beginning could crawl/stumble myself. concept time sleep part don’t remember much crying body hurting over. never want experience anything like Yep, flu last Sept/Oct basically ruined life ~6 weeks. recommend! This^ trying help person, knowing available Amazon crazy amount people asking me. get concern. Yeah, things would get substianally worse consider moving.

It's like discussed wife. agreed we'd move another country either us got major chronic disease money spent move would much cheaper money we'd spend American healthcare.  Prove it. probably barring voting trump. good night! &lt;3 Yikes. I’m really enjoying show. point anything saying Texas’s care home policies what’s causing overflowing hospitals? harms consider.

This statement reflects political bias. infiltrated everywhere, even WHO.

Of course try back finding case people wear mask. Exercising. fabric mask get wet sweat, making harder air permeate.

Air permeate fabric masks. goes around edges. Air goes around eyes, ears, chin. Plenty air goes past edges fabric mask. stopped anything. flows right in. flows right too.

But air travel distance get nose mouth, distance, moisture particles absorbed cotton, including breath exhale.

If mask gets damp, carry extra one pocket, switch out. 

You definitely going die lack oxygen. [This proved it. seriously want believe you, UK vaccine task force come tell us get hopes spring, right Oxford announced they’re still track October? sounds like powers really don’t want us think things get better. It’s demoralizing Isn’t California 35k ahead Florida? headline going NY? could ram telling go ram manager? Good idea /s

No matter conversation about, nobody wants aggressed upon. reaction excessive needed protect herself. Also women carry small form personal protection general. reasons...I’ll let critical thinking figure why.

So yeah don’t physically assault women (or anyone really) many wised respond stop aggressor. Whether it’s taser pepper spray. South heard women without brothers carrying knives (I think that’s excessive urban areas) &amp; guess lots relics women property modern times. 

It’s one one day you’ll f*** wrong woman (aka: prepared woman). wondering theories hypothesis considered facts? gaps even wider Texas, 55% excess deaths classified due coronavirus, Arizona, 53% excess deaths attributed causes COVID-19. Minnesota showed best agreement, 12% excess deaths unattributed COVID-19.

In short, anything COVID19 deaths vastly underreported. would rather live terrible life live 100% fine that! Walmart cashiers much valuable society whole Eliah Drinkwitz is. understand, cities China like NYC terms density, bad sanitary standards, way numbers could low. It’s simply absurd 70,000 ppl got sick city 15million ppl lived. Look Rome, NYC, cities west got hit first. Use logic. numbers vastly *undercounted*, half right, guarantee deaths least twice number  like people office first coworker got positive test. Complete denial.

""She fever? got positive Covid test? sure something else that's giving fever? Like food posioning something?""

100% complete denial flu cause asymptomatic infectious. However we've seen social distancing practices absolutely annihilate flu southern hemisphere countries going winter right now. Accidental Covid Transmission  Corporate immunity come! Everybody back work die!! I'm mRNA means vs normal vaccines.....but would Moderna FIRST mRNA vaccine at-scale? ""Oh sorry sir, there's line.""

""Oh sorry! know.""

""It's OK. Sorry, also need mask.""

""Oh sorry! bring one.""

""It's OK. Here's one.""

""Sorry that! Thank you.""

""Sorry excuse sir, go ahead like.""

""Oh sorry, that's kind!"" office less block GCT. essential financial business one goes office.

I went office first time last week 2 hours (took cab back) since March 10 people 300 person floor. 

Ditto offices cities. one wants go in, making record profits business booming. reason risk employees health.

I happy work great company. /s right? Nope what? That's for? Whether warranted not, usually for?

I thought would give antibiotics certain (vulnerable) flu patients minimize risk bacterial superinfection. Thank ♥️ stuck US need take trips Canada (once can) honestly consider it. ESP November doesn’t turn tides here. Compared flu, sorry, rereading see confusing No, literally snuck back avoid border controls absolutely hate country ran. people charge monsters. need removed positions power locked up. They’re better surgical masks (the blue ones) cloth masks quite good regular N95.  N95 masks short supply though, still, reserved medical workers.

In general goes cloth masks &lt; surgical masks &lt; KN95 &lt; N95

Given even cloth masks (the least effective 4 ) still shown reduce spread, give idea. 

Remember: masks show completely prevent spread, reduce chances. like abstinence safest form sex, safest thing stay home can. That's he's talking much rigged mail ballots. plans Democrats spent months talking trustworthy. trustworthy unless running traitor party willing sell soul. strange ""BuT ChLorIne KiLLs CoVID!"" +8 votes ""Chlorine probably kill covid."" -8 votes. second comment also provides link info, better first comment. Well tbf either Satan Devil choose from. time Hillary serious fire Benghazi emails I'm sure hurt her. Though, way years going seeing lot political figures truly think act think need get fresh set bodies. dump? spain bad start year Covid-19 looks like learned nothing...🤦🏻‍♂️ Wax poetically doncha? I'm curious confidence hospitalizations deaths, sure inaccuarcy case numbers. going total hospitalizations total deaths (or pneumonia related deaths)? Texas, understanding death hospitalization counted covid-19 without test (premortem). Lack testing caused us focus quite heavily hospital capacity, repeatedly stretched, causing huge concerns. Shows heads at. Must excited times. You’d *think* so! 2020, I’d 2000% certain could, easily, one arm tied behind back. 

But seeing CDC bungled tests back Feb, disgracefully PCP distribution bungled, continuing mask PCP shortages, unacceptable delays processing tests keeping testing supplies meet needs (woeful shortages still, climbing) . . . uh, no, zero confidence US federal government capable getting citizens vaccine timely efficient fair way. Zero 😣 limited border opening, total closure. doubt total closure would 'international port city' reputation favors all, since still quite integral current supply chains world (and China), much US-China trade/diplo wars worsen.

The exempted individuals quarantine biggest issue, imo, especially thorny one since likely source wave, viral strain wave likely original Wuhan one origin (unless, imported case China spread locally, border way exempted individual there. another possibility well) 


Whatever measures put today purely political nature, appease even pro-gov politicians calls 'Wuhan styled' lockdowns. epidemic curve wave trending downwards, daily 'hundred case loads' exactly putting anyone ease. 

Exemptions need continue (for local effort also global effort contain virus), certainly require conditions before. 


1) Testing arrival (i.e. seamen aircrew). Possibly paid employers well.

2) Segregated transport to/from accommodation, provided employers, supervised gov (i.e. confirm carriage disinfected use transport exempted individuals)

3) Segregated accommodation non-quarantine guests hotels/hostels, simply use Penny Bay facilities (on decommission local wave usage) temp accommodation, paid employers board.

\- could enfore better hotel guidelines dealing quarantine guests non-quarantine guest room allocations. Hotel workers probably object, however.

4) Continue policy daily medical examinations (i.e. temperature health check) departure HK.

 
Other request: Ask personnel remain craft test results confirms negativity crew members. (For exempted individuals only) true. Herd immunity little impact, unless claiming half San Diego’s population restrictions clear though. list always subject change. going countries constantly greenlisted, like redlisted countries stay list. plan leaves like 3 million uninsured 70 million insurance can’t afford use it. It’s garbage. theorise. Lol. conspiracy deligitimise idea conspiracy allow ridicule certain conspiracies whilst hiding others? 😜 Going number's game, COVID19'S mortality rate tell us approximate number infected people, totally disheartening think it. Excluding people died complacency ignorance, deserve happened them. I’m tired. read “euthanize them.” banned pointing whole kids cages thing Point you’re fucked either way get busy revolting get busy dyin’ weighs whey protein shake! vaccine answer although media give rosy perspective trials- aren’t great either. Keep wearing mask, keep washing hands keep socially distancing. 5 day old article. transparent anybody reads thread.

For record, thought sorry added clarification ..

""Health Personel, inspectors international watch groups. etc etc etc.""

.. original comment ..

""medical personel""

.. without making kind comment there.

I realize changes entire quality implications comment really really sleazy dishonest thing do.

I try better.

Be well. think also depends home environment. home office, productive. I’m studio apartment trouble getting right headspace, always distracted. Apocalypse via short attention span. schools going shut down. Period. run fucking train right wall aimed at. long Public School funding intimately tied Federal funding schools obey. 

The schools may allowed disobey, consequences disobedience surely mean less dollars road. fucked up. Wait.....americans repeat tests multiple times??????

Where I'm one resit next school year (sept/Oct) unis dont like take resits anyway. Israel’s healthcare system isn’t close overwhelmed. right heart many Redditors pro-shutdown pro-bad news. pretend it’s you’re good person care others, reality it’s retribution spending life anti-social social world. Redditors like really don’t care virus, love security homes computers terrible DUMB extroverts suffer.

Grow gain perspective. Amazing hear dumb extrovert/introvert phase much reddit, one even gives shit real life. It’s another arbitrary group put into. want stay home shut continue love coronavirus despite people kills, fine, don’t pretend you’re better person it. 1. Healthcare.
2. emergency services, like police firefighters.
3. Crucial jobs (power industry, food industry etc).
4. Jobs involve interaction lot *random* people (bus drivers, grocery store clerks, waiters etc).
5. Jobs involve interaction lot *non-random* people (teachers go here).
6. rest.

I'd say so. Sounds like bump stock rifle. things specifically made spraying bullets without aiming. Weapon mass destruction. lot sick people people run hospital door help

It's initial symptoms virus (coughing, fever, shortness breath) quite benign confused diseases. many asymptomatic carriers pointless waste time you.

Ad hominem Says man living nation world thinks way.... even realizing rest world virtually gun violence Exactly. whole country shut NY, CT, NJ hit hard virus. took time increase testing capacity, contact tracers, mandated masks. NY testing 70,000 people day. states struggling opportunity prepare didn't. America True, however relied higher figures Latin America. possible using current data Latin America 2 day old data USA Canada, incredibly misleading. must young summer child. Yeah. think kind people travels pleasure another country middle pandemic probably kind mindset trust awaraness situation. Think stat women correct, although right general high life expectancy here. Texas bars still open!?! FFS Deplorables deleting society embarrassment. awareness hits home get bills hospital liefelong complications COVID. Can't fix stupid Govt leaders advocate stupid begin Yeah read thing. Sad news cant get simple things like ""how long pandemic going"" right. Everything exaggerated. since usually higher level criminal energy, might closer pulling trigger TV owner. turn makes gun TV owner ultimately dangerous one. Especially country without general gun rights. Nothing safer everyone shoot anyone, even accident.

All criminal incident statistics show Tbh, consider 80k people safer rest us. Why? government already keep eyes them.

Those dangerous one people left Danang event. many them? went? met? now? Honestly, men like little emotional deadly firearms part God's plan. really surprising. Lifeguarded small beach town faithfully relationship, chlamydia ripped half staff. Everyone fucks other. Would slightly minimum wage take time deal make state fine money? bother. Californians? What's that? I've heard Angelenos. Pretty confusing. RemindMe! 3 months pure luck outbreaks.

BTW, hours ago three Vietnamese escaped quarantine hotel using fire exit device 6th floor.

(Ps. outbreak caused career counselor Gangnam, Seoul, given invited lecture counseled soldiers unit, soldier returned vacation.) Could also stopped AIDS banning sex single generation well. Still actually. Perhaps Spanish Catalan government promote parties, tourism, night venues, cultural events concerts time then, conflicted information going part downfall. It’s interesting Spain outbreak. I’ve heard masks widely used Spain places Europe. Masks aren’t solve solution guess. sympathy idiots. feel sorry involved hospitality tourism industry time taking vacations. Empathize fear offer logical, factual evidence. Please don’t publicly shame them. Mocking conspiracy theorists makes dig heels. Real change better chance occurring employ kindness logic within us. Thanks.  like universities. rushing bring students back shove campus housing avoid going massively debt (something government helping anyways, that's another bucket fish altogether). saying ""relying students maintain safe social distancing practices"" place housing literally impossible - mention students family school need form social connections peers order stay psychologically healthy. Universities KNOW opening going cause huge uptick cases. KNOW putting staff students enormous risk. also know setting looks like fault students happens. see headlines now: ""irresponsible student partying causes deadly outbreak COVID-19 *insert college town here*."" system set failure, cannot blame solely participants behaving within system.  mystery paralysis scares me. Given number antivaxxers, think vaccine needs US's plans Good. got deserve, fucking Karen trash.  See dont even know ""shadow edit etiquette"" dont it.

If *whole* argument rests fact maybe tried quickly add "" health personnel. inspectors international watch groups. etc etc etc."" ""medical personel""

.. *whole* case ..

.. silly billy.

But still love you.

Be well. People saying lockdown may last several years.

To think could month people would supposed do.

While younger person chances dying low, still 30% chance severe case possible long term damage, something really want take chance on. suprising measures mask-wearing social distancing place time spanish flu disappeared now!

It´s almost like never meant infringe peoples rights protect public face deadly threat. - learned something world! 

Now know state Melbourne in. 

Tomorrow learn something else, too! disagree opinion. someone position 40 years several different presidents, parties, know he's doing? challenging obstacle overcome. seems cycle perpetuates itself. blunt refutation ridicule Fingers crossed ! said week local transmissions finally ending another outbreak occurred soldier vacation. Lets hope time real !! that's true really good news. getting vaccine 200 million calamity. 100% British accent + YouTube! couple months ago began binging YouTube videos 2004-2011 UK X-Factor (no interest singing competitions before). don’t know find really comforting / diverting troubles hand 😂 hope catches coronavirus hospital. I’m done hoping people eventually come around, every single Karen piece trash.  daughter attends school metro Atlanta majority systems decided remote learning start year happening.

Which would fine Georgia High School Sports Association decided yes fall sports ok.Imagine full stadiums people.These dumbasses right next other.

It's little concerning. hope trend continue second peaks. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤ reason take seriously. couldn’t figure either. context:

In australia, state vic second outbreak coronvirus.

Vic good measures places stop first wave came travelers. 

Vic 2 months ago recorded zero cases.

Biden liar. international team conducts investigation would happy read research results. LFM Mythic Life +16 piece news changes nothing. Ergo, neither good bad. someone explain viral load matters virus replicates? load broken units, let's say 100 units make really sick. Let's say get viral load 1 unit versus 10 units. virus replicate 100 units either way? Great diversion tactic. Address point, fold. 

I repeat:

The fact need provide article states China fact lying covid statistics, paper appears insurmountably false, reeks ignorance. 

Some conspiracy theories wildly foolish, flat Earth theory or, Covid virus actually virus. Others one I'm posing, far foolish. boil everything yet proven true conspiracy theory, wonder China easily get away this. mean government saying bars allowed reopen, sort social contract reasonably safe. It’s like speed limits...there social contract speed limit 60, it’s reasonable drive 60. reasonable drive 100.

Now clearly social contract doesn’t exist anymore...because it’s clear government bunch loons. result that...there really social contract people follow new mandates/or follow second lockdown.

Americans need guns great deal racism, poverty, sexism exist elsewhere. universal basic income, end drug war, guaranteed job program, free healthcare, including mental healthcare, education, social benefits, would way less need gun. However, things guns needed state shown compensate people adequately fails protect

I never said people assault weapons.

- Complete lack education shocking amount people

- Nationalistic flag waving

The US leadership ashamed. idea stimulus help people pay bills get evicted. significant part.

However, see lot people bitching folks still working retired Social Security get stimulus checks well. Keep mind economy based consumerism people spending money jobs going come back quickly.  

Things expensive. Someone retired still working likely spending simple necessities. Giving people stimulus addition extending benefits lost jobs help economy recover faster. know think good portion zoomers pretty shitty beginning too.

You cut slack. obviously speaks another language. 😂 maximum 😂😂😂

Depends what's savings, 😂😂😂 getting slammed. article February reported **death toll** Wuhan 50,000.

Deaths approximately 10% total cases, means **February**, least 500,000 cases.

China lying butt. Bat versus outbreak occurs city lab studying bat viruses.

That's enough evidence initate investigation cop they'd suspended pay, all. humanity go? Maybe slather rice butter eat buckets OK guys.

Shockingly accurate, considering what’s happened lately family? one says hiding bodies (well, maybe crazy people are)  beaten nothingness. briefings summer outside Tuesdays Thursdays. Tuesday afternoon weekly cross-check death register, usually shows extra reported deaths Wednesday.

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Some numbers development past two weeks:

* 5 days without new reported ICU patients.
* Current ICU patients 48, 50 second day row. hospitalized patients 300.
* Excluding last 10 days potentially incomplete yet, average deaths per day fallen single digits week prior period (average 8). Total numbers deaths reported far last 10 days 25. Last day 10 deaths two weeks ago (13/7). 
* Week 29 total samples taken PCR tests fell 69393 (week 27 28 80000 each). positive ratio 3.2% Numbers week 30 expected coming days. ( source: )

Doubters point “flu 1918” evidence Covid-19 isn’t bad seasonal flu. “Because flu killed 50 million people!” would say.

They focused proving Covid-19 don’t realize parallels current situation.

The Spanish Flu, first all, didn’t even originate Spain. one really knows originated (though it’s suspected originated military base US), Spain first report it, led naming pandemic.

Furthermore, like Covid-19, particularly deadly strain flu never encountered before, thus little immunity it.

There doubters back then, well, decrying mask mandates social distancing. Doubting severity disease, people held mass public events, like parades, led infections deaths.

I guess old saying learning history condemned repeat demonstration again. Writing part communicating.  can’t write well, can’t communicate well writing.

The solution simple. Stop listening gun owners ever act public safety change, ever it. value chunk metal life. gathering large groups means exactly that.

Again: mass shooting entering bar, repeat can't comprehend this... millennials who've locked lifelong battle boomers. Gen Z, meanwhile, seems hate millennials reason. Given this, see annual shutdowns mandatory flu vaccines every flu seasons. could easily save hundreds thousands lives every year flu, particularly old people. Many 90 yr Olds could easily live 93 94.

That’s friend mine said yesterday asked still travel Spain... course wouldn‘t quarantine get tested returns. 150 vaccines development. Calm things fine. *And* also believe virus serious. local hospital, local government, doctors nurses gone publicly FB declare that. believed things bad despite lockdown, taken virus even seriously?

That's good fair question. *didn't* USA react better, knowing serious killer virus coming way?

Answer: President Donald Trump.

Let's rough math:

The total number Coronavirus cases reported around world 16,448,217.

The world population roughly 7,800,000,000

16,448,217/7,800,000,000=0.210874577%.

The population China roughly: 1,439,738,287

0.210874577%*1,439,738,287=3,036,042. So, statistically alone, estimate around 3 million cases China. way higher laughable 83,891. America gun problem. America mental health problem. rest peace, nick cordero. can't believe thing even exists I’ve heard family members frequently tout Fox News. brought CHAZ. Seattle. sent feds straight Portland Oregon. majority “white boys” killing people white supremacists cops. know serious thread comments conjured hilarious image mind. daughter talking people age care going big parties. People would take streets within hours. Thanks information, heard good news corresponding bad. hopefully breakthrough reduce plastics  emergency, definitely go! Honestly, we'd pump full fluids, ensure obstruction, relieve pain. definitely could done waiting room chair. 

And think lot hospitals separate waiting areas COVID emergencies NON-COVID emergencies. Different staff assigned minimize potential infecting patients it. 

We really trying ensure patients receive care need. 

Has urologist evaluated lately see locked loaded? urologists preemptively prescribe flowmax. People overestimating them. There's lot them. issue lot people skeptical fast vaccine developed realize one vaccines research years already You’re pulling one year figure knew where.  one turns two turns five.... Anybody bring gun shoot packed bar never average. sandy hook kid average. normal people. Sometimes life sucks. lose money.

Anyone stepping flight afrer say March 15 idiot. 

This doesnt take hindsight. No, stupidity.

It's fixed wild west report who? actual enforceable law, per Health Department police. called ""mandate"" law. It’s going gets hurt. virus completely destroying bodies. It’s starting infect cells lay dormant spreading even worse originally thought. Japan can’t contain 0 cases multiple times telling hiding undetected certain people contagious way longer ever thought possible. read post one 17 year old coma weeks told “recovered” it. know little shit. 

We need start treating anti mask people like bio terrorists. need overthrow government states refuse lock close venues helping spread it. need close schools kindergarten college. need Trump White House. hope Biden balls put US total lock enforce it. I’d rather see militia forces used save lives throw protesters back vans. Use enforce mask laws, shut parties gatherings. biggest threat humanity fucking virus. old coots charge right dead won’t see devastation leave next 10 20 years.  Confident retired people collecting SS 401k dividends see pay cut.  Uhh what? Look developed countries That's rather selfish. I'm electrician every day keeping power on. wife teacher forced back classroom middle pandemic. yeah, fuck us right. get stimulus tax breaks anything. voted every time could helped. kind hoping they'd get bored go away. maybe somewhere around 700 million guns country?)

400 million. one gun per *see* me..? What's deal eternity thing? Since year eternity? want safely go gym nice tea tea house,please 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻  Exactly, one armed worry Moderna trial anyone want read article. Oxford US trial starts next month. Also /r/NoNewNormal crazy. Stuff like many full it.

You're damn scared wanting punish people medical neglect whining risk others.

I'd say thinking like risk.

Aww hypocrites mad getting called death wish fantasies. Oh sweet summer child get that. I’m really really self-centered. fucking trespassing, stop ‘peacefully protesting’ bullshit. Sounds like i'll survive 😈 money costs insurance?

that one Yep. insanely packed Yellowstone Glacier National Park. national parks limited resources campgrounds due covid19, alot shelfish dipshits feel entitled think camp wherever want including private property, tribal lands (closed non-tribal members) leaving trash dumping RV waste water, toilet paper, diapers, tampons, shit. Even national forrests seeing tons human waste trash trails forrest service roads everyone camping RVing pandemic.

There also enough National Park Service Staff handle high influx selfish shit bag humans/social media influencers go trail, damaging veggitation conservation efforts, cause traffic jams cause want selfie bison epic covid19 travel insta story bullshit. Even 25% would massive help state shutting places well! someone strongly Christian, apologize deeply selfish people can't take even tiny cross avoiding church months save many lives. “Assault type weapon”... you’d think written Canadian Murica. 

It’s trite say sort thing happening longer shocks me. happens often nothing ever changed. Really gets choochin first thing morning. long test, there's pandemic. long use forethought, there's risk crowding children school buildings college students frat parties. kids stay home course that's got nothing pandemic already magically disappeared. get deported whichever shithole countries came from. Ney need money make life bearable, without intruder could aswell take life. Nah. admitted asymptomatic risk spreading.  went hiking since shut park went staff walking thankfully see trash ground. Bigger parks hard police thousand aches can't watch everyone. idea people think okay litter. would hate see house looks like. experiences US doctor's visits weight that's measured calculated BMI used tell us we're obese. I'm saying wrong, knowing body fat % directly something usually encounter unless go way figure out. Well, 100% support people owning guns, far instruction, maintenance care required line. leadership important. Real leaders decision liked everyone responsibility protect people right thing even means losing role leader.

We opened US early politics. never properly shut politics. Governors tried right things never going win Senate republicans refused support appropriate funding citizens stay closed. president refused help secure ppe fought leader tried right thing, decent things, ethical things.

The rise covid cases youth due irresponsibility youth. instead directly fault failures leadership government. present facility bridge going across trinity river town Dallas happened.
Let make clear!!!!! returned fire soon first shot sound shots small arms assault rifles like lady claimed! said “AR-15” heard multiple gun shots homies hood quick trigger. Clearly threat punished doesn’t stop anything. many shootings happen Chicago every day despite guns shooting people illegal. hope one symptoms coronavirus decreased stupidity stupid gun owners. keep employees home least next July, people familiar matter said, making search-engine giant first major U.S. corporation formalize extended timetable face coronavirus pandemic. Yea found odd reply well. ""Shouldn't allowed guns ever again."" even need said ffs patronize gun problems countries “solution” country nothing like ours.

Mmm, American exceptionalism  reached upper death toll Flu? would expect much worse flu. Check source. inconceivable many studies base data homogeneous source. Also, like 14million samples across globe, think fake. Fox news crazy online shit radicalizing part country. hate people ""liberals"" basically anyone group scares hell me. feel like sadly understand Nazi Germany happen now. God sakes one hated groups socialists. I'm scared country. talking about? know exactly came from, effect is. large % serious life- long health damage left covid 19 patient.

As far I’m aware, consensus all. It’s minority cases lasting symptoms, those, least gone 2-3 weeks positive diagnosis. looks fairly uncommon symptoms lasting longer month, even instances are, clue long lasting may be, one recovered virus several months tops. 

A “very large percent serious lifelong damage” ridiculous probably fearmongering claim. US president time downplaying everything well. American soldiers died “Spanish Flu” World War battlefield. ... Singularly focused winning war achieving peace, Wilson failed publicly acknowledge pandemic, much less address it. indifference disastrous consequences. ... thats ""sunday stat"" - per countries Sunday sees dip reports. Encase. chained good chunk economy sectors. decades. matter time backfired. rethink that, everything created around (it's economical phenomenon) maybe get something good this. Facebook-memes-shit. probably future coronaviruses, one followed SARS, mean world constant state pandemic. development successful COVID vaccine greatly speed development vaccines future coronaviruses.

Plus next time there's unexplained pneumonia China, national borders slam shut far faster time. burned hand teaches best, say. Nobody wants risk repeat. Odd, think magical man sky would’ve saved them?!?!? Ohhh, must’ve part mysterious way plans. Commonwealth Puerto Rico meaning neither State Independent country. ones voted **NO** multiple times become state. Mainland pushed since 1940's. citizens constitution apply them. U.S. citizen resides Puerto Rico effectively disenfranchised national level.

I gave everything needed educate topic. short easy read article. Yet still choose ignorant. Peurto Rico held multiple votes Commonwealth, statehood independence free association. always vote **NO statehood.**

Edit:u/Ya\_like\_dags - think make Sorry, know ton sanders.. makes say biden give damn? get impression does, I'm still trying figure guys out.  toy tiy trident. Pandemics happen future, inevitable part world lots humans animals interacting closely other. might another coronavirus, might influenza pandemic, might another germ, first pandemic last, although years probably pessimistic pandemic scale. 

That said memes make sense. fact people might get sick die years silly reason anything stop getting sick weeks month. Also develop human coronavirus vaccine likely much easier make ones new coronaviruses future. mRNA vaccine tech, works, could open research pathways lead vaccines tons diseases. believe sub proper correct definition circle jerk. learned live deadly infectious disease before, flu. couldve eradicated locking would have. thing even contagious flu. never going away. someone raised church ""old time revivals"" always wondered God found fitting touch people church money paid guest speakers offering plates. never anything home yet God never made mom pass seize listening hymns comfort living room. think quite honestly well keep spreading vulnerable.

I’m fucking sick reasoning. Literally *everywhere* gone “unmitigated spread fine, we’ll PrOtEcT VuLnErAbLe” incredibly high death rates group “protecting” *BECAUSE CAN’T PROTECT UNMITIGATED SPREAD.*

JFC, “we need protect vulnerable” talking point die painful death should’ve died months ago already? going interesting see factors end determined behind this, higher average age seem like obvious one. shame information available languages start, good hear that's case - keep peak possible second wave. Yeah around half million, near 17 million. BoJo taking lot W’s since sick bodies deal coronaviruses time, much growing evidence multiple sources infection gained immunity coronaviruses may limit COVID-19's disease potential 

And sure big uncertainty is. seems enough data conclude vast majority people mild cases resolve issue, many asymptomatic. get vote for.  62 million ignorant fools voted moron failed almost everything life known con man years thought good idea, rest us paying lives cases. would still better invest money instead gun bag cash throw intruder ""Mama always said... Stupid stupid does."" cops useful. Forgot those. means small towns/rest stops become breeding grounds outbreaks someone shoots cannot avoid confrontation also would like gun i'm allowed to. Don’t forget fentanyl. Yeah see people shitting Belgium think we're one countries actually counted right pay FIL himself. That's Republican way. would us believe. Based google mobility tracking, social distancing significantly better was:

July 21st Report: 12th Report: last week, workplaces -62% baseline, June, -29% baseline. That's pretty substantial change last month so.    ""Preventable death""

Damn hit pretty hard. Wish us luck dude. Imma post lol take idea well. 

Have ever beaten frying pan? Imagine always check covid forecast see need bring packed lunch face mask? wonder intruder would react turned medieval armour nude heard intruders cannot judge danger crazy shit like turn tail. well dont know luckily never situation. armed patrons could facing felony charges firearms bar, unless police.  control it? Thats usually done laws, drugs such. illegal one, citizens going them.

You can’t magically make disappear hands military. Guns easy make get smuggled every day. Even US stopped producing would change nothing. reproduce ""Oh boy, opportunity use toy obsessively carry around fantasize I'll never back conflict long nearby."" Keep mind economy based consumerism people spending money jobs going come back quickly.

Maybe time reform economy consumer spending make 70% GDP. sustainable even good times effects global warming catching US next 20 years things need change. really trying justify spending money time something never use? one guys itching reason kill someone? (They typically join military) get punished isolated society see error ways.

But whatever, you. country kids get shot schools every month.  number zero considering they're risk exposure 47 states. OP, here's I've read, expert. 

The Sample size phase 2, least one article posted here, 1,000 people. probably fine research perspective, may that, people scientists seems ridiculously low.

The duration vaccine, really post-infection immunity, unknown. know antibodies last two months, know antibodies component immune response. One study said vaccine produced antibodies 3 times. Then, one lady WWE tested positive March sick, though detail level. tested negative weeks later. June, company testing, tested positive again. could faulty testing, also new territories never time effort test people months infection since really exist months awareness it. noted felt symptoms too.

Dr. Fauci said vaccine would 70% effective. hard say meant vaccine 100%, people take it, both.

With mind, maybe lot things I've missed, pretty easy keep hopes tampered. want Summer next year, lot things, year absolutely shattered faith humanity. Regardless, fingers crossed. Bizarrely, dumbest possible thing could say point. People would still need able defend crime. 

Not gun crime low, people can't (easily, all) guns first place. I.e. developed world bar America. work small, liberal arts college early arrival students coming later week. going absolute shitshow. Poor analogy sadly.

When think going ship help need help end goal saving people mitigating loss life.

A large swath population actively saving lives. else argue lack universal healthcare politicization pandemic?

I truly feel there. much preventable death. partner receive stimulus unemployment due sole proprietorship status. 1200 received despite still employed saved asses. Source that?!? That’s wild! Looking states data it’s obvious young people affected COVID. However add COVID deaths everyone 40 state, account less 3% total COVID deaths. case despite younger demographic making bulk confirmed cases. like rogan always talks supplements level getting shape makes sound like he’s hocking shit. wish could isolate issue eat unhealthy diets singular issue.  studies I’ve seen quoted sub put around 0.3%-0.8% keeps people (maybe right mind, maybe teenagers messing around, etc.) answering positive incite panic others warranted? Maybe that's really pessimistic view end, people never cease amaze me...  breakfast cereal aisles would boring without us. should’ve yelled “get lawn” proceed nothing. right protect property. Eh meant furloughed / laid off. Damn that’s dad-ly dad joke ALWAYS wack job that's willing cause harm peaceful people. 2nd amendment rights taken away there's crazy guy misuses gun?

I think story like makes easy argue pro gun!

If wack job opening fire would 100% want gun protect myself.

Again, ALWAYS crazy person that's willing crazy things. gun proper trainning use it. protecting potentially family people around you.

You rarely hear majority gun owners responsible... He's going get great real world training feels like *actually* rights restricted.  Take you. No, he's not. Yes, I'm also disillusionment phase, everything right beggining I'm slowly starting stop caring, getting fed everything. I'm depressed homework fucking piling up. don’t 200 years gun freedoms do, 10 guns everyone one citizens lying around. 

Please patronize gun problems countries “solution” country nothing like ours. country fucked still understand still tie last year's income. one making $75k year who's still employed going hell lot better someone making $100k lost job. understand urgency passed first one, they've time figure better way.

And know lot $100k sounds like would tens thousands bank, high lot areas country. It’s clusterfuck politics fear porn spread bums.

The majority people won’t even click op link go comments don’t care positive news. would love covid lasted forever. national parks. lot hiking see trash trails ever before. Especially camping spots. started bringing plastic bag carry pick inconsiderate assholes. small % people got laid off

? don’t understand see everyone wearing face shields - they’re infective since they’re open back. mean, sure you’ll protected someone sneezes front - air travels freely around open spaces back sides. 

I discussion colleague claims virus hoax face shield bette protector since it’s solid plastic - perhaps didn’t see irony all... statement contradicted itself. 

To top off, said way face shield would beneficial - would used conjunction face mask. would course helpful, said get-go, shields meant work - rather alternative. 

I also get pissed see assholes masks nose. It’s like think get viral load inhale mouth “sniffing virus” won’t give increased risk “since use dogs detect corona dogs don’t get corona” - actual quote. web site get info: numerous web sites.

but wants cry US manually supply data cut ties them, US consistently posting information publicly whole time? too. want end. vote November, else do? different. one case, woman wanted child would devastated lose it. other, dozens possible reasons none business woman may ready bring child world.

By ""they"" mean single person later clarified comments? create much transparent organization actual allies instead enemies.

A virus give shit alliances. What's point NATO-style useless literally pandemic originating outside borders? 

Why would anyone want member lead US they're skyrocketing cases despite majority allies managing reduce massively? !RemindMe 8 hours order research would happen. decent examples, like kids summer camps large breaks. Even miniscule chance spreading school setting hours indoors close time dozens children. point becomes matter when, if. ok though MLB season 6,936,046 games per year. they? see that? 3 states?

My mental health feels depleted right now. I’m obese 22-year-old Texan feels like caught virus, it’s over. feel like I’m on-and-off state of, “Be cautious virus, don’t worry day,” “Omg it?” Anytime experience types symptoms (I allergies, nose runs bit, cough, etc.) feel screwed. 

My vitals practically good. Pulse usually around ~73 pulse oximeter reading says 97%, sometimes 98%, still get really weird feeling stomach (fear, anxiety) makes think virus sure I’ve lived last day. It’s odd, terrifying feeling. 

I couldn’t sleep tonight soon started dozing off, weird wave go feels like panic set in. don’t know describe perfectly. like something rolled gut. Probably fear anxiety. Idk. 

Also, know need take break sub. feels like addicted it. 

Sorry rambling. Ok, I’m bit confused statement. Although novel virus, still coronavirus, definitely new. HIV/AIDS. 

And HIV/AIDS described. know, mom public health nurse time HIV crisis early 90s. mild people beginning all. People personally knew died painful slow death within 4-6 months. Thankfully, incredible treatments mild vast majority people (I don’t know said vast majority- never, ever mild illness. horrific treatments now) came many years research. honestly don’t know you’re talking about. completely different illness.

Edited add: understand you’re referring fact often HIV symptoms obvious several weeks (not years, absolutely not) hits hard. However, would much evidence months experienced completely different virus true. It’s apples oranges. They’re even close sort virus based upon basic epidemiology.

 Seriously though flu season could suck Covid riding along, I'm hoping Covid precautions, seems work flu well, may actually see lighter flu season. provide benefit, harmful children waste time. 

I'm sorry. show logical connection there. Something beneficial inherently harmful. neutral. Waste time? else going doing? force parents back work?

Adding tax advantages here, Thailand definitely cheaper Europe ever was.

12:56 a.m.: NFL players attend 'high-risk' events contract coronavirus face team discipline, lack pay
NFL players contract coronavirus ""high-risk"" activity away team facilities face team discipline might risk paid, according league's new protocol.


A memo sent NFLPA agents weekend, copy obtained ESPN, outlines several rules governing player contracts, opt-out provisions contractual consequences canceled season.

The memo says final language Friday's agreement league players appear side letter still negotiated information distributed weekend represents ""a summary major aspects COVID amendments."" basics dealt with, final section memo devoted fact players held responsible way circulate public coronavirus remains present.

Players told weeks ago conference call NFLPA leadership could face discipline, including fines, conduct detrimental team found contracted COVID-19 reckless activity away facility. weekend's memo reinforces says activity could allow team challenge status COVID-19 diagnosis football injury.

If challenge succeed, presumably team could place player non-football injury list, move would allow team option paying him.

The memo also states: ""Clubs/NFL challenge designation football related injury prove player contracted COVID-19 engaging high risk conduct below. (This issue remains open.)""

""Players going careful outside building,"" Los Angeles Rams tackle Andrew Whitworth said last week conference call disclosing entire family got virus one went lunch friend. ""All takes one exposure, spread like wildfire."" addition risk death, 3/1000 real risk, also risk lifelong disability. 

Something keep mind. feel pain, never better time online education self-advancement. 

Good luck keeping together! Regarding title, need study tell us mask supposed cover nose. unfortunately, people wear mask nose probably type people going change behavior study. really don’t understand care predictions right wrong. also plenty predictions first would contained like SARS wouldn’t effect wealthy countries much. like said, shouldn’t care.

Over 650,000 people died probably more, less. excess mortality many countries (and want prevent indirect pandemic deaths too) one’s counting dead Yemen Kazakstan. Regardless predictions reality face, it’s really tragic one. swear people think apocalyptic amount death like would see movie wear mask.

Not mention one reasons predictions overestimated many modelers didn’t take improvement treatments account. feel bad healthcare workers work tirelessly save people’s lives patients “not enough people died”. Yeah generally reason run chase. Source: run away couple potential muggings London 60% shot. Probably ongoing deficits though Yeah real. winner knife fight dies way hospital ambulance. Ever marker fight younger? Wherever marker swap cuts, fun Sweden less interventions neighbors (still some, though! 50-person limits gatherings closing museums, university campuses etc). interventions also continued longer time, many still ongoing. moment, Sweden little bit stricter restrictions Denmark/Norway/Finland actually.

Yes. even freaking try anymore? six+ months BS, economy toilet, show it? Nada. Everyone going get virus point. bed shat. Everyone blame least little, obviously much others. got beat. Might well try live life least bit mean time finally get vaccine least half decent treatment out. much effective. got 14 players 2 coaches marlins positive, dunno much longer baseball go on. love baseball Right. Cuz humans honest, self controlled, believe fairness.

So. Much. Bullshit. cops bad. seeing recent backlash Lewis Hamilton got reposting kingbach video instagram, ([this went checked comments kingbach instagram post youtube video amazed reaction people have.

Now someone higher hierarchy (Bill Gates) says US made mistakes, masks working, reopening schools dangerous, criticizing ""medical experience"" labeling destroyer life US politicians news anchors tell people good no-one needs mask cheer follow blindly.

Why social media polarized towards side now, see, number people ""don't believe existence virus"" lower others, instagram youtube comments quick criticize everything side science studies praise hoaxes Bill Gates Fauci literally trying lower world's population ? think speaks volumes. Somehow, people offended $600 per week $500 billion can’t accounted for. He's trying spin expected post-Brexit food shortages. mean...people willing die early 30s heart disease probably scared virus since dying young plans start with. sad part even downgrade current FLOTUS.... times change. Probably even upgrade current President tbh. Awesome. time begins happen. sad legislate use law enforce common sense public decency. defending people know nothing doong job licking boot?

Just say dont point move fuck Go hike friends dude, stay outdoors, keep gatherings less five people, maintain distance possible.

Don’t forget either might die it, could spread someone older die virus. 

Don’t abandon caution safety you’re lazy it’s inconvenient you. iT’s FLu....BUT WORSE!    easier

yeah dude, no. Vaccines definitely solution. everyone (or appropriate percentage) get vaccine period time ""immunity"" lasts, virus go replicate die off. availability logistics issues. looks like pro-abolition argument actually pro-2a argument.

&amp;#x200B;

But life ugly, willingness use weapons others ugly. ugliest willingness use *access sports bar.* America horrifically high number people psychotically selfish seems even surprising headline. It’s never going away, need “live” far lower levels death severe illness, possible vaccine advances treatment. Society can’t operate way close way 2019 many people dying many suffering permanent debilitating symptoms. loot store burn down. show them! American seriously considered fleeing country, understand sentiment want apologise fucking dumb here. Auto deaths per year: \~1.3 million 
Smoking deaths per year: \~8 million

Not sure dependent cars dependent things used drive shutdown, look like we're going find answer here. hit hard fast, could done little mitigate that.

I don’t like narrative. NYs first confirmed case March 1. didn’t lock March 20.

Meanwhile Asia deep trenches February. 

I’m singling NY here. I’m saying nobody gets pass ignoring happened Wuhan. provide fire service people 
Because fire un checked threat everyone It’s clearly COVID-19 loves America won’t leaving anytime soon. Well reopen people met know go work. want able things. bet lot working service jobs wish could stay home still get paid. are.

Back slave South, really dangerous jobs, hired poor whites. slaves valuable. lot money tied slave expected get lifetime's work them. Slaves investment. poor whites day labor. One died cost nothing paying families days they'd worked.

You're modern equivalent that. die, they'll hire someone else replace you. Minnesota good job racism year. really tremendous job. Reading comments like makes feel bad actual good cops trying job

Edit: fact I'm downvoted oblivion makes much happier live US. really think every literal cop evil became cop kill/harm innocent people? Genuine question Yo American say y’all definitely right. believe second allowing guns makes country safer overall, regardless fact may help people isolated situations like one described. clearly going agree that. 

Perhaps least agree place assault rifles, anything killing power pistols. friend would benefitted use. fuck America. 300m+ guns us, approximately 20m people concealed carry permits. event extreme outlier. argument like saying ""man, really want hammer, sometimes people use kill people, can't argue pro hammer."" getting closer Trump he's 65 100% agree. can’t really talk virus without also speaking forces work impede proper handling it. What’s purpose talking virus that’s impacting lives everyone planet can’t talk many issues exacerbating crisis? announced it, dude wfh week Even trolling, White Plains (really Westchester) amazing compliance mask requirements. ""Epicenter"" nation, Westchester's numbers great everyone see still taking seriously. Yes. That’s damn funny able guess it. Maybe deaths Texas stop 2 weeks. know.

I know bubbles NFL certainly can't college. However NFL amount time prepare. guess we'll see handle it. want sports. makes sick. :( can't look forward things 18 months away? Like vaccine? yeah confused, whenever hurricane hits puerto rico, USA ridiculed helping them. Americans wearing mask go Puerto Rico. Works ways. Probably fitness book started pandemic. can’t imagine anyone would care read non-story. wanted attention, got it. Unfortunately Facebook mommy groups. conservatives conspiracy theorist internet. pay attention news Alex Jones Youtube spreads huge numbers conspiracy theories, even believe make money.

Social media design feeds people connects people views. lot dumb ignorant people want feel smart country every race, gender, religion political affiliation (though groups may higher numbers dummies others) participating conspiracy theories makes feel smart gives sense identity solve address problem go away. planned vacation Lanzrote (Spain) year too. I‘ve cancelled it. paid 55% price, I‘ve cancelled without reason. long government says travel restrictions pay 90% depending you‘re cancelling. tried postpone next year, wasn’t possible without paying 55%. negotiation, nothing. travel agengy insists right. I‘ll pay, Never ever give money again. 
I also travel insurance, don’t pay case pandemic. say entirely covid. combined everything, even normal average deaths range natural man made. multitude factors play reaching number. Hell theres variable police start gunning people plays factor. say insane consider lot people US high risk factors. Also consider many retarded sociopathic brainwashed uncaring assholes would love people died covid strong survive weak die mentality fake virus, end helping achieving number. said someone else, faith humanity anymore. severely surprised live next year I'm higher risk also grown ability cuss everyone wear mask wish catch symptoms I'm tired. little late. current rate virus spread high brought safe level masks current permissive level closures. Indiana mix counties, experiencing truly dangerous levels spread (eg. Elkhart) looking better shape (eg. Allen). state also borders Ohio east Kentucky south - relatively bad shape. Detroit (to Indiana's north) hot spot, appears better now, though questions remain.

Bars restaurants still open. Indoor fitness activities permitted without masks, involve 'strenuous physical activity'. Many schools pressing ahead opening classrooms couple weeks.

It remains seen well people comply mask edict. Many police sheriffs saying openly enforce it.

Indianapolis among 11 cities recently leaked White House report called upon take robust measures slow virus's spread. point, looks like Indiana might able avoid complete shutdown weeks taking big step backward re-opening by, example closing bars, casinos, exercise facilities, prohibiting indoor groups 10, opening schools, enforcing mask rules stepping testing contact tracing.

But, honest, think complete shelter place order going place beginning October - whether state takes steps. may well calculus governor others using. Unfortunately, means choice big step backward shut plowing ahead shutdown. former means death suffering, latter somewhat less. Mine $3000 USD well Joe Biden Donald Trump Barack Obama time think/thought 100% fine payed $3000 USD mend broken leg. Republicans brainwashed people, lazy research, thinking little bit taxes help everyone worse. 

It's infuriating ""Christian right"" fights wealthy tells people poor black people reason they're super wealthy. church Vegas money help poor. 

We pay $1000 monthly insurance. get another policy cover insurance cover.

Obama fighting universal health, Republicans took Senate get anything done.

all get everybody vote, especially since Russia meddling yet again. know people go church, including pastor made comments, doesn’t surprise one bit. be, unfortunately totally different story what's point? Geographically speaking, I'm closest relative grandparents (about 90-minute drive away ... next closest 7 hours away). relative visited since March, though neighbors check hem. initially difficult explaining mom going visit grandparents (her parents) ""staycation"" last week, understood. Even though I've careful, live somehow gave grandparents coronavirus. called ""optimism bias"". Instead Wiki page, here's cooler page podcast attached: think future health, career, finances, even longevity — imagine rosy, hopeful future. everyone else, though, tend far realistic.

In words, smoker, everyone else going get cancer. You’ll probably lucky portion smokes 90s, think. Similarly, odds success new restaurant change depending starts venture. you, odds pretty good. someone else, see odds pretty bad.


For 80 percent people, brain overestimates likelihood future good events underestimates odds future bad events. like criminals conceal weapons law abiding citizens all? Millennials- Oh noooooooo, crash real estate prices, ooooh horror [says browsing listings] understand happening 100 years ago... today porn, TV, videogames, video chat social media could possibly want. hearing EU article??? 

Like missed American news talking it? Seems like big deal.

Let known starting catcher Marlins travelled team Miami Philly, found positive there, still played entire series despite people testing positive passing day. rights too! ~ Anti-Masker  did... would someone broke started attacking you?

DNA clearly shows that. ""kids can't spread covid"" said

""it's perfectly safe"" said quick. Easy say now. different thing intubated. summary measures:

1. Reduce gathering limit 4-people 2-people (except household)

2. All-day takeaway restaurants

3. Closure types public facilities

4. Mandatory mask wearing outdoors (in addition public indoor areas announced before)

5. Increasing tests severely affected areas

Jesus hate 'logic'.

Either get struck lightning don't. 50/50!

It upsets willingly ignorant people comes anything even faintly scientific. It'll get better. suck. forever. want offer advice anything like that, hang there...times weird. got this. agree people identifying problem needs solved, video talking lied hell back. patches stating branch. talking car unmarked, well think vehicles need marked looters rioters see coming. believe protesters good people arguing potentially good thing, rioters looters unacceptable matter anyone says. people actually kept fellow protesters safe revealed looters rioters protests would shed much better light people would willing support shouting for.

I willing argue even mind changed I'm provided information good makes reasonable sense.

Look Lazarus Naturals! prices reasonable, also 60% discount veterans &amp; low income individuals. Hospitalizations percent positive dropping fairly quickly last two weeks screwed deadlier virus hits.  Irrelevant.  I'm talking about.

But already know zilch. Good luck Trump though, maga!!

Puerto Rico part US can't. best can. keep reminding kiddos going struggle year &amp; ""behind"" whether class virtual.  Let’s look what’s happening Portland

We definitely keep eyes that.. also fair realistic breadth scope what's going (and importantly what's going on).

It's also like Fed Agents driving random quiet suburban houses dragging away innocent unrelated people reason. arrests holds happening Protestors protest-zones. (IE = put risky situation.. somewhat expect risky/detrimental things happen you). People need practice better situational-awareness. 

I'm sure i'll get downvoted saying (the following).. Protestors need find smarter (and safer) ways protest. ""being dragged fight"" exactly outcome authority-figures WANT. Emotional people easily manipulated .. playing ""emotions moment"",. giving exactly want. smart all. normal people.

They think are. Took gander see subreddit steaming pile propaganda hate. irony calling conservative truly mind blowing. Seems like lot Donald pleebs migrated way. I’ll go that. Better term. still going increase quite bit. fucked. scary. alright... ccw holders, carrying bar?

""Stop stuffing face burgers!"" cheap prepared food high caloric density. Nutritious, low calorie food prepared often ridiculously expensive. Learning eat eat instant process. Fad diets fail reason.  Fresh fruit vegetables often available food deserts, leading people right back cheap prepared foods.

I lost weight armed appropriate information needed make changes - proper calorie estimation, diligent tracking, increased physical activity. idea posted r/Coronavirus, mean, yes masks main point like, nothing Coronavirus besides swastika mask.

To respond there's bigger coward one afraid reality reject completely would nothing react it. always get crickets response. Thing risk big death (not sure long-term damage sickness), contributing spreading it. something community, others, yourself. helping others socially distancing. Maybe thought helps ... South Korea 150k cases, 14k

The actual infection rate *is* actually higher known case rate country.

... that's something else. actual infection rate United States probably 10 times known case rate, COVID-19 severe symptoms 10% cases.

So although 4 million *cases*, probably 40 million *infections* United States.

This way, way bigger China reporting. I'm sorry break you. Literally even cover 1 month rent.

Here's Sweden (which famously lock nominal COVID death rate 20% higher US) death rate month. able find US numbers, I'm sure looks similar.

Regarding original comment: 

I understand frustration use hospital resources care people behaving recklessly. real world, course can't turn away sick like life choices. take care kinds people, drug addicts, criminals, abusers. Sometimes two people shoot gunfight, parties end next operating table, physicians triage differently car accident victims. EMS saves heroin addict sometimes several times per week. Talk expensive harmful everyone.

It extremely frustrating watch people participate collective sacrifice getting everything want do, resulting harm others. Unfortunately human condition many us constantly cleaning messes others make. necessarily see clearly seeing article. truth human beings care sort democracy hospital systems, turn away sick ER. don't. Welcome Germany, give police permission inspect storage firearms ammunition apply ownership permit. give notice either quite polite it.

Realistically, get checked every 10 years. told officer I'm probably non-German city ownership permission. TIL Southern Strategy.

Shame. surprise all. left thread conservatives claiming ""the left violent"". Still seeing it. Another stimulus coming? 1: guns illegal, never ever matter law pass. gun factory still operate ""make guns illegal"" police, paramilitary/security, illegal transport sale (most guns produced outside United States affected US law). Really giving monopoly guns private security (i.e. rich), criminal intent government, seeing Trump sent unidentified federal security contractors kidnap peaceful protesters street, I'm sure would want that. 

2: inspector anything productive do, although country plenty guns, actually shit together. mass shootings every week use time. safety well-being citizens actual priority (unlike US) spot checking insure said safety considered waste time all. 

3: easier track guns illegal? people trying hide then? illegal WONT way track know what, nobody going declare confiscated. 

4: 1800's this. think people can't steal things modern age something? I'm seriously loss point statement. think it’s actually pretty bipartisan.

Also, take drive around poor neighborhood drive around rich neighborhood. difference restaurants grocery stores pretty blatant. Corporations market poison vulnerable society put marketing campaigns healthy happy models eating it. totally insane.

The whole thing reminds smoking. poor diet kill people smoking (at least UK, sure US) advertised similar way. Come back McDonalds, salads now! Please look calories salads! Would like gallon soda salad ice cream sundae $1? Junk food addictive drugs lethal eventually. changes gut fauna changes cravings, many people who's taste messed drink water anymore. see that, unfortunately couple bucks hour really makes difference. Capitalism blocks innovation. IP laws encouraging greed block flow information. huge payday awaiting whoever finishes vaccine first encourages cutting corners.

So ""Sesame Street"", ""Fortnite"", ""child rape"" seems favorite thing ..

This nice comment never saw rape thirteen year-olds huuugely small knob

And comments really ragey angry.

So seem fascinating person. highly doubt house values drop. anything see increasing. Low interest rates might actually encourage people raise prices slightly (or people overbid) people paying lot less interest (4% 3% 500k house difference 100k 30 yrs) willing offer 50k right means saving 50k overall. 

Its going regular home buyers buying homes housing crashes. Banks going lending money housing crashes (this cause huge cash flow issue) going huge real estate companies capitol/cash hand buy properties make housing even worse. 

People home buying market actually cash hand right ever. People borderline able make down-payment cash buying first house. Demand probably huge right supply actually going limited (we stopped building houses 3 months) evictions/foreclosures probably balance out. 

Idk thoughts. Ugh, hard. completely empathize people told essential, benefits suggest expendable. pissed ways, agree who.

Let's make mistake, entity capable allowing everyone stay home except agriculture healthcare etc would federal government. need direct collective grievances to.

I'm tech worker making nearly six figures eat lot rice beans, homemade bread, tuna, eggs, cheap foods.

But get saying. eat choice they're healthy satisfying. different eating grocery budget week $7. kids? No, kids go back school. correct unskilled labor worth less minimum wage, I'm saying minimum wage, defined ""starting point"" would gradual climb market would adjust equilibrium, take away power lower class assign value labor isnt market choose.

HK lost “international port city” reputation. It’s effectively part mainland China. Generally true. find though NHK puts lot diagrams, models reach lot casual viewers. think point, Japanese might willing go in-depth issues read articles well. many unnecessary shootings, agreed. Coronavirus? relevant sub?

More specifically pertaining incident, patrons let club shot place up. fact let ""at capacity"" due COVID restrictions seems neither there.

I positing reason posted sub sounds like ""one stupid anti-maskers"", *were* case, would make least marginally relevant Coronavirus issues, thus would belong sub.

""NaZis sOciAlisTs"". Yeah, name. Much like USSR socialist name dictatorship. Peoples Republic Korea, Republic Cuba, many many more. Much like US thinks democracy republic. Seriously, could change choose lead. guys sprout nowhere believe ever changes tactics, actually hold opinions. think he's currently trying pull overton window, seeing acting somewhat respectable viewed great, rather normal PM. Makes sense mass shooting epidemic predates coronavirus pandemic decades... Football evolved lot differently rugby (a sport I've played years despite American). Football evolved play stopping reset tackles, turnovers, etc. Players allowed substituted plays. led position becoming super specialized 11 positions offense defense played different players. makes 22.

Plus whenever kick points (like fly-half usually conversion try) that's specialized position too.

Plus last (like rugby league) team either score (unlikely) punt ball far away lose possession. punter football also unique position.

And yes, injuries quite frequent. Honestly I'd say American football much injury prone rugby, even massive rule changes safety last couple decades. Teams need least one backup every position. mass shooters would still access firearms restrictions place.  Yes! It’s important stop blaming poor people victims predatory practices. poverty doesn’t allow luxury saving disposable income. preyed upon banks overdraft fees loans, check cashing places, payday loans, rent furniture, etc. victims system. info shooter, everyone attacking preferred target race political persuasion, rules damned.

January 2025 Sadly, history somewhat repeats itself.

As society progresses, appears peoples' education care others not. Thanks dude asking. wrong, every month passes learn virus, effectively treat it, spreads, etc. think eventually reach point position warranted, we're yet. agree can't hold indefinitely rolling lockdowns shutdowns, still better prevent many people possible contracting learn treat better. much longer? personal (in way scientific) opinion maybe another year so. still think benefits would outweigh costs point. That’s well good. would argue people guns harder oppress kill.. Remember, absurdity going get worse worse closer get November 3rd. Stay safe there, powers desperate sacrifice family sake 🍊's el.ecti.on odds. Pretty sweet article. Basically slaps every BS theory conspiracy see net. Here's idea: stay closed.

Or reopen kill bunch people. you. agree 100%. people US idea healthy diet actually looks like many calories actually consuming. enact systematic change address obesity, including increased nutritional education doctors well general public increasing affordable access produce around country. think need constantly remind fat people they're fat person responding state extending WFH. probably even privy discussions.

I think say certainty company seeing big drop productivity would extending WFH many quarters out, would instead saying ""we review situation next month."" way would paying developers big salaries saying ""WFH indefinitely"" things going well.

Things going well tech firms. WFH working. Costs offices effectively closed. urgency reopen. really wish they'd make masks available bands go around whole head opposed behind ears.

I find ear elastics less comfortable full headband. That's completely wrong though. CDPH shows 2043 deaths today 401,938 cases among 65s CA. CFR 0.5%, .005%.  I'm confused. Boris turning competent reasonable leader now? Might loop almost like he's taking serious issues like obesity corona seriously. Yes. Also, overweight obesity linked poverty class issues (I know simple, there's certainly correlation poor able afford healthy food visit doctor). personal health problem, also social one (yes, things one cause). read somewhere there's actually psychological phenomenon this. stuck long term cycle poverty, get used idea kind windfall last long. Logically might make sense save additional money, get beds better quality/cost ratio credit, use rest money *as comes in* buy improvements.

But get used idea money last. saved money, use next disaster never anything ""nice"". Especially since many needs based programs low cutoff points, hold onto tax rebate spend groceries since longer qualify food stamps/banks. get used tomorrow guarantee, whatever feels best moment figure tomorrow take care itself... not, amount planning part would help anyways. word mask context fighting words...

This makes sad. I've seen many people younger generation trying aware what's there. We're trying, really are, know what's there. US media (from daytime soap operas music news channels) prevalent lives difficult break away from. Yes, we've internet past 35 years learn world, can't say much ~2010 (due young really pay attention), since American media prevalent life, presented foreign source information, natural response turn familiar source, American media, one grew with. Another factor America damn big influencial there's little reason maintain daily awareness countries. pisses government country two choose embargo resist will, cares? We'll trade countries put pressure us comply.

Just speaking motivations here. Americans tend motivated individual freedom rather societal duty, there's many things working indulgence worldly affairs (save military involvement, separate conversation), makes hard sell self-interested populace.

There's plenty reasons (mostly long term) Americans interested long term benefits aware involved worldly affairs, Americans looking short term benefit. Lol 10 million recover que doomers digging negative long term effects. doomers thought would dead months ago. Chinese health organization  Shitting floor describes country pretty well. Absolutely, guess USA hope checks balances havent anything past 4 years eject Whitehouse. flu virus still flu virus. know stop washing hands wearing masks. can’t anyone know something experience themselves.

What get sacrificing months? 

A President denial. risk generation denial. crisis we’ve pretty well proven won’t defeat — least current leadership. wrecked economy. bunch lost jobs.

I’m one them, can’t blame millennial zoomer basically saying, “fuck it. tried save fucked us all. I’ll probably fine anyway. Good luck dying mess made!”

It’s completely rational way feel, way government behaving — long continue distance mask anyone increased risk. purpose. manchurian candidate elected.  could back (i.e. CDC estimates), unless show trolling; worth effort.  I'm pretty sure first time adult life back February. I've worked healthcare knew bad man. 

I dealing pinched nerve left elbow prior. Okay freaking thing hit me, shit happened right elbow, joints like, attacked pain. could barely get stairs 34. mention coughing peed pants, worst face? Ache I've ever life one day, completely lost sense smell even though nose stopped stuffy. nasty, febrile mess broken body whose lungs rattled breathed laughed resulted coughing fit. 

That went week slept lot. 

The fever like May (though low grade still happens time time) arm pain excruciating. surgery arms unpinch nerves like everliving fuck? 

Never ANYTHING like that. legs feet tingle like time time. I've lots blood tests shit fucked week half sleeping. surgery arm hell. 

So yeah, flu fucking sucks lol. 

People saying ""just flu"" piss several reasons. 

On geriatric psych unit worked on, patients come ICU, physically recovered flu resulting cognitive neurological issues changed entirely one knew they'd ever regularly functioning adults getting flu. Completely different people, families said. rare, happened. 

The flu serious COVID we're several months .... 

Stay inside. They'll need hospital beds think deaths bad now, they'll lot higher come fall/winter. 

Everyone least venture safely possible get flu shots though. Pretty important, especially year. doable month take best international routes: everyone isolates home month. Massive fines - starting $1,500 - travelling anything school, work, healthcare weekly grocery shopping.  Everyone work study home possible, even small children, month.

With place, car travel severely cut, traffic stops effective fines enforceable stopped place route home, work, school, local shops, health care providers.

Outdoor exercise allowed encouraged foot within set distance home.

Face masks school essential businesses everyone times. essential businesses like finance, medical, food supply open.  many working home possible.  Schools empty younger children essential workers.  lockdown needs longer terrible start conditions, it’s better almost children/students defer repeat year’s school control pandemic, despite developmental issues.

Massive fines anyone house party/dinner party/mass family gathering.

No church services, except 5 people wedding, 10 people funeral.

Stickers floor essential businesses properly physically distance everyone checkout.  Perspex barriers checkout addition everyone masks.  Security people letting one out, one grocery stores maintain smaller numbers shopping one time.

If go successful German route, everyone tests positive (with without symptoms) goes hospital monitored constantly test negative symptoms gone.

If that's late now, successful Vietnam route everyone tests positive (with without symptoms) goes enforced isolation, test negative symptomless, hospitalised.

Undoing lockdown done careful, enforced stages, immediately reversed area cases deaths go back up.

Outdoor activities first open up, especially national parks beaches, physical distancing encouraged, individual beaches parks shut become crowded.

Melbourne. Australia currently gone back severe lockdown mandatory 14 day one-room quarantine international visitors failed sloppy implementation, covid19 cases per day went back up.   schools back open Melbourne, one child tested positive covid19 entire school shut 2 weeks. conservative friends don’t think happen don’t care happens someone else. live county people, probably 90%, careful. Dipshit friends probably get continue spouting bullshit. Also rental cars. know someone works rental spot said business never better since people want avoid public transportation + get Serves right! 'Its bad' Um... kind seems like opposite contain virus.

&amp;#x200B;

At time really want doubt Vietnam knows doing, far seem know doing. dont get it. They're flying high cases, tourism still open. country dumb. I'm ashamed live here. they? source? trying start anything really wondering. us pay attention terrified see many things opening up. I’ve seen Instagram influencers’ videos people huge crowds nearby water park. Seems like one cares. Schools open too, know many people can’t afford send young kids school. election year? get vaccine local pharmacy one safe. neighbors rednecks... :/ low expectations set general. scariest part Trump current administration anything done far. blip. future American authoritarian Hitler Stalin look got away with.. truly want push country towards authoritarianism... idiot reality TV star charge. large portion country eager it. Education, mob mentality, environment raised in, exposure toxins like lead, echo chambers, need feel secure even false sense. sorts things. influenza B year. software dev, office work fuck got destroyed. unable work week. back neck hurt like almost 3 months. mean even 100%. think 75% good compromise. live political environment compromise impossible. Yeah, exactly. I'm dining indoor restaurants whatever crazy shit, psychologically broken down. job future, I'm losing housing, thank god want kids I'm 32 year old woman single, still want partner. Like, we're told going last years years, one else listen basic fucking rules, fuck it. point, fucking killing best shit coronavirus me. Americans really *do* like ""not"" jokes! High five! June last month though  sounds like seeing parents live worth risk then, despite nonchalant attitudes definitely means careful you. guess facetimes phone calls sufficient, go extra mile. Well, gl that.

 tale tortoise hare comes mind. Yeah cause don’t work anymore haha make sure got china numbers though, I’m sure accurate Great, century mankind gonna deal crap again!

I'm kidding! life earth gone thanks global warming! ;) live tourism capital US.... We're improving guys great news. Oh wait.... Damn! They're messing around. Well done guys... Would surprised kick us China Fuck CCP would thought 4 populated states country would eventually top 4 COVID cases country. Unfortunately seem confuse conspiracy theories skepticism. ignore everything reputable scientist say. seem clue WIV data actually published. trust liars still havent found Saddams WMD, went war 2003. China open democracy, president declared ruler life? way get many false positives. Positive rate normal 1% Fta:

SK Bioscience, South Korean pharmaceutical company backed Bill Gates, may capable producing 200 million coronavirus vaccine kits next June, Microsoft co-founder said letter South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

A handful vaccines, include one Astrazeneca-Oxford two China, final stages testing, raising hope shot available end year.


Hopefully we're right track here. China lying asses off, nuke china alrdy. Sun Jul 26 2020 tests: 855.811 | positive: 56.130

... indeed look lot better

[Source [Source Yes. Except Korea even think guy Covid.

The plot That's chance Karen takes. Sensationalized headline much? agree course.

Even put aside $1000 savings every week, 19230 years get first billion. Imo, good guys never get there, due altruism, ones tend oppose wealth redistribution exactly nature selfishness required get there.

My 20-trillionths billion.  Dems need strip liability waivers conference. Almost enough make say ""Good!""... realize Monday-Wednesday always low number days, really much done curtail virus (with exception stores recently requiring masks) data lagging anywhere 4-14+ days... One stop analyzing early chain causality. feel like poor root cause analysis part low amount grocery store shoppers wearing masks extremely obvious cause. governor amplifying echo chamber masking-up also two extremely obvious causes. OK going definition, attempt coercion? According article guy come back say ""let I'll shoot!"" got pushed bar, locked doors, came back shoot everyone fit rage.

That's terrorism, that's psychopathy gutter trash person care life all. fact viral load common knowledge vastly accepted point crazy me. I've explaining people (in person, much online) 4 months... Hopefully becomes trend sticks. Stores never started opening Thanksgiving Day. I’m still getting milk. trick consider things scale. One man rifle cause easily dispatched government, sure. That's *good* thing. want every lunatic gun able overthrow government. imagine government trying kill 100,000,000 armed revolting citizens puny fleet 10,000 drones finite munitions. one *individual* guaranteed success, whole *body individuals* able overcome.



Think another way: armies swords trying kill other, line charge. man front line army likely survive *individual*, twice many soldiers (and Hannibal Barca) army still likely win *overall*.  fun, quick heads — 100% okay me, you, anyone ask someone source make claim internet. 

Now take three deep breaths, it’s going beautiful day! chance take shots first batch, would you? Good. get little fuckers back school. FFS. usual it’s US tipping balance. 

Similar small portion global population uses 25% world’s oil, they’re also huge portion global COVID cases. refuse lockdown, wear masks, etc. someone lives Canada hope keep border closed long time amazing loving, knowing, powerful god continues fail prevent things. think know difference martyr ignorant hick asshat? maybe burst wrong word. thought seen cases NBA players getting covid could mistaken entire situation changed mind support Confederate flag wall. build wall Confederate states get fuck country stupid flag back ""Its banana, Michael. could cost, ten dollars?"" testing data filtering white house first goes CDC? wear fucking mask fucks sake shit worth dying Please provide scientifically validated sources claim origin virus Wuhan Seafood Market.

No one said otherwise.

But spreading November. Financial literacy learned skill one taught schools.

79% GDP spending, guess there’s least that. Pretty sure Pfizer already started, would second....  mean ""Corona-land""? literal whataboutism. ignoring point made drawing attention away something totally irrelevant.

“I don’t answer criticisms cops murdering people cop changed tire once! that? good cop. Say, want lunch?”

You completely avoiding conversation entirely. trial could take 2 years, anybody enrolling probably followed long don’t get COVID.

But, they’ve probably got event triggered interim analysis, meaning certain number enrolled patients get COVID, let independent body look unblinded data determine placebo patients performing equally well, worse, better. overwhelming efficacy threshold probably built protocol, well futility boundary. haven’t seen protocol yet, I’ve asked around analysis thresholds, expected timing, etc.. it’s 90 hospitals, somebody leak protocol long. source? want visit fucknews. Absolutely agree.

I really hope time far deep end we're forced properly address problems coming deep, deep place  disagreement here! FYI - alternating capital/lowercase typing indicates sarcasm... going attendance professional sports games -- social distancing eating drinking Man High Castle.  need call BS every country using US India standard. Like stupid New Zealand dictators hiding numbers worth, doubt much. First, someone would qualify privileged measures, never ever stopped something cited. (Traffic) cops like writing tickets. Second, supposedly, people disinclined wear masks whites, usually blue collar, many opportunities write tickets minority mask refuses (this can't matter affording masks since cops seem offering mask citing). Finally, admit 2 may wrong, certainly case almost contractors local hardware store wear masks correctly, variety races. say care policing masks results disparate impact different races; coronavirus deaths getting things control enough robust reopening important wildly pressing concerns police overreach/racial disparity impacts. expectation emphasis mask enforcement reduce racial disparities citations/arrests, would move police's focus traditional neighborhoods issues apparently result undesireable racial disparities. charged attempted murder every patron staff member there. Bars restaurants throughout Oklahoma pretty much back normal. lot restaurants dividers require wear mask walk in, show. People largely given fighting virus, even believed first place. places still closed, lot businesses gone under, lot places open using really silly precautions put show without actually anything. 

At point wondering long take burn general population naturally. assume actual case number least 10x *more* currently recorded count, long take get herd immunity? I'm sure people ask question every day. 

It feels like everything happened zero payoff I'm tired all. everyone thought 1-5% would die, made sense, seems like slightly deadly flu worse lingering effects people. issues medical system temporarily overwhelmed, lot seems issue medical systems setup first place. enough PPE/beds/flexibility huge issue. keep talking enough beds staff time laying people keeping parts hospitals closed. 

I want sound like one deniers conspiracy theorists, possible made mistake taking virus seriously? look back, fallout job losses/mental toil/etc worse actual virus? 

Sorry, get mind. There's one talk stuff people deny covid issue all. think legitimate concern, I'm tired upset literally one seems figured appropriately respond time get right least two months ago.

Edit: meant say actual case count 10X shown, original phrase clear Hahahahaha, every fucking day police prove &amp; useless. 

We'd seriously *so* much safer trained &amp; gave pellet/rubber-bullet guns certified EMS &amp; social workers. Still funny frying pan though - can't beat satisfying CLANG. America Bad, China good!

Edit: downvote ? ! said exactly guys wanted . .. accurate counts data going Whitehouse first? Bro, dumb I'm starting consider stop answering you

Think families people could shot guy, obviously. could think I'm one pointing make lose faith gun owners anything pandemic taught many people actually killed flu year. Scary stuff.  it’s filled people like think great existing assholes it. 

We potential great, shit that. decision like affect recent graduates? earth get right kind experience (just general skill working well others example) starting working home, boss works home? I'm pretty sure entire career would different I'd started WFH environment. certainly think would trade it. current requirements mostly require people walk around face coverings. Whether coverings offensive not, relevant covid virus. Couldn’t agree more. perhaps one biggest threats facing society today. It’s common Reddit, it’s actually norm. Especially sub, Reddit actively promotes keep “safe informed.” 

I don’t know recover this. seems accelerating. Particularly since many people stopped in-person conversations replaced online interactions. 

Another poster (buried) pointed shooting occurred neighborhood called Oak Hill. google neighborhood, you’ll see likelihood MAGA good ol’ boy anti-mask zealot highly unlikely. Sorry, anti-safety pandemic seems idiocy pretty well localized conservatives Friend mine works Belgian pharma-industry, apparently started human trials around now, goes well, production November full rollout Jan-Feb.

That's course smaller scale maybe start amount production already awaiting results, still, hope sheds light timeline competing vaccines.

Edit: Janssens Pharmaceutica one, daughter Johnson &amp; Johnson, goal producing billion doses end 2021. Theres getting away it. either A. shleter place lock everything B. open deal consequences. 

I'm starting buy herd immunity, dont know want sit house theres vaccine. chaotic situation, even important officers easily identifiable. 

Those would attack police acting legally captured arrested, hidden from. ones making peaceful protestors look bad dealt with.

People coming unmarked vehicles dubious legal rights pull people said unmarked vehicles makes situation worse. Especially there's reports grabbing peaceful protestors along non-peaceful ones. respond! also test less people week? felt saw Canadians going Florida booking cruises. come crying government repatriate them. Christians also denied history 6000 yrs ago based billions fossil.

It’s test, people read it. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* lot have! parent's state too. whole ""things suck, even try!"" argument helpful. business state disobeying orders, report state authorities. virus going away need part curb spread. shame red mask &amp; red hat brigade well read.

Please make exception here. People need aware misinformation spread. bit less trash. Quite bit. Still, eat things often. variety good, treat while. worst part view - *know* act like ignorant asshats, endanger others, flaunt social safety conventions, chips hit table need help, society they've burdened stupidity swoop rescue them. Even rescuing might put other, better people risk rescued. 

I feeling somehow could prevent chucklefucks getting healthcare treatment COVID, would LOT fewer morons convinced mask limited capacity restaurants ""civil rights."" sudden, hedging bets would become important adamance hoax.

Of course, also know reasons can't go path making feel repercussions ignorance. get it. like, fuck, life truly fair eats year. even close brother. Looks like this. many almost correct words actually mean right thing context.  working intended acknowledged United States better highly centralized, totalitarian state lowest rankings world nearly standards petroarchy staggering issues wealth disparity, extreme sexism, violently repressive religious laws, frequent state-sanctioned murder, contemporary slavery...

I think good job, sense comparing us developed nation's much nation undeveloping rapidly. really frustrating trying explain people sports luxury entertainment.

And luxury entertainment takes resources community time resources already strapped.

My hospital fighting testing capacity, PPE, social distancing. Meanwhile, there's billions made professional sports use resources.

I understand identities centered sports teams. understand entertainment could even used keep people indoors banned person spectators.

But luxury costs money leaves hospital fighting yet another entity basic supplies.   better run. That's even worse weapon.

From personal safety perspective, easy choice. live area police reliable protection, fortify door set way quickly call cops - standard Home Assistant (Google Home, Alexa, Siri, etc) it. live area they're unreliable, ensure defend escape.

Also, comparison knife better damage much property is... good. care shooting shit, defending would concerned people downrange. personally gun (though support people's right so, within reason). people live rural areas perfectly safe defend home gun there's nobody else within weapon's maximum effective range anyways. Dude state pulled gun asked put mask grocery store. Ended needing 5 cops subdue disarm him. Last night reading bar TX got shot denied entry capacity.

LMFAO wtf case people may end dying starvation COVI-

Wait second, realized we're saving lives... Biden taking oval office telling everyone c h l l. 

Or trump takes office becomes double garbage fire. monotonous actually starting think bot.

No, get that... also counting $600 week federal aid unemployed cut back hours. means aid government like $2,800-$4,000+ Depending state live in. know CA, Unemployment boost, making $4,800 month unemployment, plus ""$400 month"" Stimulus.

Fox news shy telling people Nazi party name word *socialist* it. viewers sharpest tools think they've broken secret code. abandoned modern Dems it. hot topic really back.

""Guvment trying steal burgers fries, want that?"" Scared everyone best Dems backing it. expect read paragraph?! someone USA, family motto always; “yes, fun get this, *really* shouldn’t able *easily*”

Edit: Side note, could possibly moving EU future, I’ve picking Français Nederlandse jobs, picked Deutsche.

Any recommendations/ pointers die Deutschen speak? problem people power viewed health economy. can't healthy usa economy people scared, economy driven consumption people scared consuming. 

Fixing health crisis fixes economy. locked hard early come back slow steady. point think trying make vaccine. health economic crisis then. feel like problem system better president could led lot stronger response throughout could made difference. Apparently security camera.  Remember way default? Maybe keep way. Tbf, shame fat people country. hard fat country get defensive discourse negative. We've gone far wrong direction though. able talk honestly obesity without shaming/feeling shamed. 

Obesity starts young age. socioeconomic issue people realize. hope end jail, truly workers pepper spray police? Heartbreaking. blood christ terrible antiviral. Probably ton them. That's disgusting. think trickles bias employers place value degrees. prestigious schools hard get well. trouble getting 4.0 GPA community college. 0 death mean lot people, “no one left behind” sort mentality dont feel threatened doomed. 

Needless say, even Vietnam, poor, life become hard due worldwide economic fallout, people need hope get number 0 sort symbol hope faith country. police would find they're afraid touching anyone arrest.  Exactly.... people die lockdown.

If virus deadlier, maybe we'd give shit. unsustainable pause everything forever. There's nothing wrong want blow now, make bad financial decisions live they're young. money, therefore choice. However they'll pay come retirement age. Making decisions peoples money saying they're irresponsible (however true may be) wrong though. responsibility bail people bad decisions. makes problem worse holds make good decisions back. past weeks, face masks mandatory public spaces regardless social distancing (even alone trail street, must wear one). remove eating siting (no smoking eating walking), active sports (like running alone keeping distance) unable wear one medical conditions. 
Most people observed measures, though young people others sometimes seen improper use. Then, bit loophole night bars (people definitely respect measures there), closed clubs added curfew bars/restaurants close midnight. Sure, enough people dying taken seriously. Especially since people predisposed trust anything internet challenges current understanding world enforce though? Retailers said requiring masks later said going enforce employee safety. means want get sued. 

I go Planet Fitness. rarely enforced lots rules have. I've never seen ""lunk alarm"" actually enforced. Even gym goers dropping plates every often. meant simple dress code even enforced. People could get hurt sandals workers say nothing. Yes, way. way people need mortgage buy home take back seat droves people paying cash. Ones gonna pass long long time honestly.. idea right concoction. need make sure there's long term side effects, need make sure polio vaccine repeat. caused regulations today vaccines. Rushing always best idea despite much absolutely sucks right now. agree definitely individual appetite differences contribute heavily ones weight. incident? Maybe, maybe not.

What think _there less incidents like this_ required certification training. It’s funny he’s correctly identifying there’s problem (big businesses supported gov small businesses) blames entirely wrong thing. think **Hitler** pretty well known *racist, murdering dictator*.

A poll read years ago said around entire world top 3 ""known"" historical individuals are: Jesus, Hitler, Walt Disney 3rd place. man known different reason, reasons good ones remembered for. think person option online worried. Yet another entirely unrelated previous comment subreddit's topic reply. Yes, compulsory sterilization terrible almost (if all) Western countries guilty start 20th century 80s. cherry picking information Sweden might gone check rather larger article listing countries still practice . past hopefully, learned learn case countries still coerse criminals sterilization part sentences prison time. not. ""They capacity""

So plan make space himself? say full rabbit pellets.

You go make list everyone harmed another politically-related argument country last six months.

You tell many liberals initiated harmful actions reactionary, regressive, racist.

When list hand, come talk me. keep track whom. Apparently, not, would make idiotic claim did. ignored.. news. Lol. Maybe instead gambling sports year, gamble teams shut due covid19. looks like person saying agrees, whole thing reformed tasks performed effectively. mean I'm history buff Jew, know WW2. extended family significantly smaller direct result third Reich. History American public educational system insanely whitewashed. still teach kids Christopher Columbus good guy discovered America lmao. Ignoring fact educational advice ""watch documentaries Netflix"" response comment public schooling system, ""Hitler bad"" history lesson. Looking geopolitical economic circumstances allowed rise third Reich history lesson. say again, teach us much here. Lol.

Edit: also totally agree importance self educating, anyone looking entertaining history lessons highly suggest podcasts ""Hardcore History"" ""History Fire"". top notch. also seems buying big jug Bleach, probably mix Bud Lite, keep 'rona bay... something like 200 vaccine candidates tested right now, anyone's guess ones become available given country first. Assault type weapon? even mean? used bolt action would hunting type weapon? mean, people guns literally stopped shooting bmi 21.4 us live northern hemisphere cultures summer schooling, really know what's safe not. Even places cited never closing like Sweden, fact closed secondary schools (not sure universities). guess still safe due shared HVAC, close-quarters living, shared bathrooms indoor dining halls. Even low rates, soon get case dorms going spread like crazy. Considering MLB made single weekend without outbreak imagine long schools could stay open. Districts 3000 kids congregating day going back community. College campuses trying still sports top housing kids country. We’re 6 months vaccine effective treatment we’re going everything make necessary. That’s assuming immunity even lasts long. can't survive $1200 3 months, clearly need better managing money! /s Oh, course. still fucked happened.

The accuracy statement never bothered willfully drink poison, knowing poison. believe refers people poor fools trapped there. ""The data show **7-day running average number COVID-19 cases reported U.S.** sudden break rapid climb flat corresponds day handover responsibility data CDC highly politicized Department Health &amp; Human Services. difficult conclude official numbers longer trusted tell us anything meaningful course pandemic U.S."" Although academic journal spotlights happening vaccine research terms us understand I’m starting become large proponent forced sterilization Covid deniers anti Vaxxers. rest world doesn’t time. Man wish family like that, gramps(America) keeps guns behind plant pots, inside clock, back open bed truck covered blanket, bed, etc. accompanying ammunition loaded... single one gun safe... kinds garbage women.

Lol, woke scolds like treating women like children? ""spout"" anything anyone, happened challenge comment someone happened woman. fucking weird post history. Fucking K E S.

Oh no, views opinions disagree with! ""Fucking YIKES""! happily debate *any* opinions disagree with. won't, debating opinions, trying discredit made comment challenged perceptions, woke scold feelings hurt.

But go on, opinions want challenge? dislike what's going China? dislike Trump border policy? Anything all? think so.

Edit: Lol person's profile, woke scold outrage talking ""ableism"" ""fatphobia"" calling people ""problematic"" profiles person tracked comment found something completely innocent offended by.

Aside many lives lost, see industries massive closures: restaurants, theaters, theme parks, fitness centers, bars, bowling alleys, skate parks, niche shops like small book stores.

All industries would need significantly invest money innovate time profitable. It’s doom gloom entire service industry.

School kids get shoved lockers probably though 😂 early days Corona people kept saying shit like ""the flu kills more"" ""heart disease kills more"".

That's thing calm you. need reduce also! Dying heart disease expected reality here. one even considers reducing it... hope judges start pressing people infect others refuse wear mask. charged reckless endangerment. Democrats shit either, buddy. Red vs Blue, rich vs us employer giving dates, keep saying they're evaluating situation, vary depending what's happening location. Initially summer, October... foreseeable future. think want keep pushing date back. Let's destroy people's jobs mental health avoid virus almost definitely affect them. sew clothing.

Wait, really? bit? century living in? article says nothing shooter. know point may certification training necessary.

Ah. seems unclear. speaking _general sense_ _this specific instance_.

Because yes, gun control may well stopped incident. matter strict, gun control stop _all incidents_.

What certification accomplishes _reducing amount incidents_, whilst giving impediment people need guns jobs, well trained enthusiasts. Mostly means ""effort-wall"".

My original point comparing effort-wall '1984' pretty dumb, premise _gun rights come bundled package consisting freedom guns, people hurt abuse firearms_, readily agreed upon rights end hurt others. ""Your right flail arm ends millimetre someone else's nose"" that.

You entirely correct arguing specific instances largely moot. think move subscription-based journalism contributes less depth understanding, think deliberate. netherlands 1% positive tests classes Ph.D. faculty teaching! know WTF they're give live lectures office hours. less?! tell people think less...it's people value contact interaction classmates teachers. human touch. faculty want get back normal badly...they miss classes too. college town highest rate infection WITHOUT students 20-29 yr old group. uni STILL planning person classes next month...insanity.

The problem is, faculty staff payroll set. buildings still need maintained paid for. Online dorms meals pay do? Fire staff dorm dining work open what? 

It cut dried matter. LMAO Pretty much yeah SARS long incubation period?
Contact tracing simple? think surveillance system powerful really track everything?
Given knowledge virus today, everything seem simple. need understand NOVEL time. Sums point. totally predictable without bubble. Even bubble there's risk, least fighting shot staving covid.  
  
Crossing fingers NBA keep things locked next months. Maybe wake call dumbasses like Lou Williams. Yup. It’s like shooting fish barrel. USA’s horrible response COVID-19 design. Cull herd ever survives forced go landlord tenant mega-corps rich.

I'm happy I'm longer part world. worry someone going car get gun, hero gun trying stop them. That's entire media, talking about? four far left outlets. Also, follow origin story, they're repeating one account Portland unmarked cars badges on, secret police, detained 2 people questioning.

The discrepancy even larger Alberta, 40 deaths linked COVID-19 found Feb. 23 April 11 total 402 excess deaths recorded.

For Alberta that’s 10% B.C. that’s 8% discrepancy statistically significant numbers. I’m convinced that’s major miscount. Could miscounting? Sure. could also miscounting. read Danish news. said “he hopes Denmark mandate masks RIGHT NOW”. could done there’s new wave fall. Primary reasons people wore masks public transportation people risk groups still could use it. it’s people risk groups blocked parts society.  inject Bud Light!

Use brain. national pandemic response team 2018. Things would gone differently. would probably looked like 2003, SARS came US stopped immediately testing contact tracing, 115 infected. wasn’t conservative nothing masks. 3 black guys weren’t allowed club 1 shot place. promise guys never worn MAGA hat.

This work, **NEED** bubble. Unfortunately MLBPA want bubble, meaning going business usual, minus fans. 

The NBA bubble breached twice, accident purpose, yet positive tests. NHL flying hubs now, **2** positive cases **800** players tested. keep mind, training camps, teams still home cities. 


This done, travel option. Healthcare U. S. many issues stem competition plans big pharma lobbyist.

I think stating trip hospital cost tens thousands also ingenious. huge amount factors price. control many it. Depending health plan within pocket max deductable price also vary. scenarios already met pocket max result zero dollar bill.

 insurance bill may lower cash payer. low income could qualify even lower bill bill all. hospital organization work regular provides millions dollars worth ""community care"" individuals unable pay.

Lastly, say also situations people screwed unusually high bills. say problem way Healthcare set America, absolutely is. pointing huge bills possibility. um long term side effects super health adults research frontal lobe Children teens ages 10-19 likely spread coronavirus among family members adults children 10, according new study South Korea. results published online early release article journal Emerging Infectious Diseases could updated official release October. 
 
Researchers CDC Korea Centers Disease Control Prevention analyzed reports nearly 60,000 people contact 5,706 coronavirus patients January March. found 12% household contacts COVID-19, 2% non-household contacts contracted virus. 
 
""Use personal protective measures social distancing reduces likelihood transmission,"" authors wrote. 
 
In households coronavirus patients ages 10-19, nearly 19% contacts tested positive COVID-19. highest rate transmission among age groups. Children age 10 lowest rate 5.3%. 
 
Based timing South Korea's lockdown measures, high percentage among teens tweens among younger children could explain transmission occurred around school closures, authors wrote. China, instance, contact-tracing study showed school closures social distancing significantly reduced rate COVID-19 among school-aged children. Additional studies, including antibody tests, would better explain public health benefit school closures prevent spread virus, added. 
 
""Although detection rate contacts preschool-aged children lower, young children may show higher attack rates school closure ends, contributing community transmission COVID-19,"" wrote. 
 
Higher detection among household contacts rather non-household contacts could also reflect virus moved among family members home shelter-in-place orders. 
 
""Given high infection rate within families, personal protective measures used home reduce risk transmission,"" wrote. 
 
If someone home tested positive coronavirus, social distancing personal hygiene ""most viable options"" prevent spread virus, authors said. Future research might able explain whether wearing face masks home could help, especially family members underlying conditions face high risk contracting COVID-19.

Poverty nothing ""systemic racism"". Poverty see skin color look poverty statistics US see plain day.

34 million people US live poverty, 15.7 million ""systemic racism"" cause poverty largest demographic people living poverty white? reason headlines change US county focused dividing us along racial lines contributing it.

Poor communities issues matter color skin population rather deal issues easier ignore one group scream racism.....and wonder nothing changes. Sorry downvotes getting people actually understand Darwinism. Yikes. Hey, could talking bar Dallas, South Dakota. I've seen articles popping 90-120 days lose antibodies, thats thing stopping reinfection think would seen ALOT cases since we're pretty much 5-6 months in. 

I think verified cases reinfection either.  Woah woah woah..... put stick polite now! want get us lawsuit you?!? Sweden let people drowning pool said “look, Sweden lifeguards, life buoys.”

Are thinking FL? I've seen lot gated communities nice houses FL.  Countries keep reporting this. point going believe it? write something mostly agrees you, say believe still deadly flu. good take seriously.

However, otherwise, 100% agree you.

I think benefit we've gotten shutdown overwhelm hospitals, probably prevented deaths early got better treating people locked down.

But look Sweden. Look New York. New York New Jersey huge breakouts locked down. Half friends went new york early March came back Covid. likely rampant there. 

Herd immunity real. I'm married PHD pharmacology saying day one. understand deniable point seems basic math. countries successful lockdown seeing huge surges easing even little, get immunity.

I live hardest-hit county state. anything special now, numbers still falling fast. rest state still catching average daily state numbers going slower. county far better last week. think ton us already it.

And I'm scientist, married PHD'd researcher actually works one universities influential treating Covid. we've felt house months. seems playing like we've thought would. Errrrrrrr ... no.

I actually never said that. 

You pull quote did?

What said open consider far never heard anybody give plausible answer many countries around world hiding countless COVID casualties without anyone able detect it, anyone reporting say ""they hiding bodies!"" dont go that. Well carried out?

It’s utterly asinine, can’t get people. Doesn’t matter you’re doctor, nurse, otherwise professional credentials nuanced opinion. new Facebook post comes virus, they’re it.

It really feels like live Idiocracy. be, get stuff non-prime delivery time/cost least. pay quite lot food delivery (around 10-20%) find worth it. yet, they're ones Nazi flags available tie heads. Funny, that. Also elk meat carbs devil food. Hey, know whole thing sucks. really appreciating anything ease mind humor like this. said, really hoping nothing good results Phase III trails possible vaccines. hope Moderna key player this. type vaccine determined safe would huge unreasonable losing hope. rough times 

But Astranzenica (aka oxford) vaccine looking good.  claim suspect safe likely provide protection. check easily believe next phase testing 30 thousand people.  

You may getting jabs June hopefully working vaccine process least underway.  

No guarantees little optimism warranted.  vaccine may turn 100% effective safe Yeah loaded corn syrup really fun get Brock Lesnar enforce this, suplex anyone wearing mask Yep. Unloaded guns safe ammo another safe going get discharged anyone ""heat moment"" situation - take pause thought owner even access.

But weapon loaded ready go hanging rack behind truck seats? That's different, sometimes tragic story. likely is. black owned restaurant predominantly black customers. What’s Covid? Yes called harvesting effect. nice term, real phenomenon. reality, right, what's whole point? quarantining symptomatic players 10-14 days, going 22 man starting squad made mostly B, C, team backups players team starting positions well practiced in. 

It's going look like Div 3 college ball there. absolute joke football season. 

*No offense D3 ball players, guys playing elite level. are, yes. Imagine dumb enough ruin rest life one night.  go again. I'm sorry understand impressed assumptions. 

Take care. Actually shocked see people chanting ""were number one"". Sure protect them. send sick patients back nursing homes. stricter measures place limit number people going in/out nursing homes. Setup special shopping hours elderly. Tell older people need stay home more, wedding fill room elderly, go elope somewhere ceremony next spring. things probably prevent deaths anything else. eh senior employees. you’re acting like it’s nba team something. there’s thousands people graduating class would make good employee google, microsoft, apple, etc. mean America found minority population it’s ok hate on? Thank you. went back read article. Another article read never mentioned motive. Lmao sounds like group super villains Impossible, asymptomatic carriers. Minding people even know could spread without symptom back Dec. Jan. next best thing club. balance... understand huge selection bias comments like these.

The people reasonable views don’t feel need shove everyone else’s throats. It’s usually idiots crazy ones do. tried reduce travel playing teams regional divisions - American League East teams play National League East teams, Central West teams. traveling much normal, still going impossible keep control. NBA might better chance keeping everyone Orlando. None would work normal travel circumstances. Thanks sharing link info! Another point view get there's much larger chance lingering issues. Worse, much bigger chance pass older family member friend's older family member die. ages conditions died? 
 
I believe condition was: Texans. It’s stretch assume whatsoever. They're masks - took actual flags tied heads. Wonder hand, *hmm.* College minus life experience piece paper rubber-stamp many anyway.

I actually prefer it. Professors accessible I'll able shoot email ask research whatever. saying months ago got downvoted hell.... pro seasons never finish. Every one MLB, NFL, even college FB, Basketball etc... really sucks virus doesn’t care want sports back... Implying America great country live in... over. New Zealand could hiding extent outbreak. detected Europe November. highly unlikely could contained Wuhan October.

Meanwhile rest world fully aware virus middle January. measures taken then? No, countless countries decided wait domestic transmission running wild throughout country. Man, hell knows..people losing damn minds anymore. past Friday county corrections officer got argument receptionist appointment doctors office near asshole pulled gun shot her, bullet went chest struck ankle patient. Receptionist died. guy shoot bar year already?!  No, thinks people recommend 'any civilian' AR15 part problem. put words mouth. dishonest.

What's alternative then? Make gun ownership mandatory protesters armed well? Well asking civil war.

I've also read mechanisms involving tolerance addiction pertaining carbohydrates - may account one feels awful days starting no-carb diet. could explain carbs seem addictive nature people.

As far fatness, quote it, carbs used immediately basic functions intentional exercise, stored body fat. 

Carbs kind like comfort food think. college, worked people bulimia, 9/10 times favorite binge foods carbs. even invented new speak it; fat shaming. overweight almost became protected class US. I’ve felt need point Christian:

Edit: Taker exactly? Good questions.

All militaries lose firearms regularly. get widely reported militaries like make big deal it, higher profile thefts make news.

They generally notice next inventory, every year send guy jail really argue there's way avoid robberies, useful prevention always involves team armed guards. There's way justify gun range.

Gun ranges also remotely ""top notch security,"" although they're generally secure businesses. Again, lack guards human error insider involvement biggest driver theft.

If asking multi million dollar security vaults every range, suggesting people pay $20,000 annual membership permitted shoot guns?

Stolen guns really hard sell. They're generally sold directly gangs, illegal drug pipelines resale. Anybody street selling something potent marijuana knows guy get pistol rifle price. price generally lower retail stolen could involved past crimes.

You get hundred thousand dollars firearms tearing wall. pain ass gangs drug dealers still stolen guns, another product line.  would awesome could this...let deal own. Sadly though, get sick go hospital, hippocratic oath requires doctors treat them. can't win. best hope deal long-term health consequences actions learn lesson teach others.

Shame horrible motivator. public health experts recommend shaming people. People end reinforcing beliefs, either hiding behavior (fake masks) associate shame mask wears never wear one.

Better emphasize positive, hype around wearing mask. Make desirable (as much be). Also non-judgemental education support place it? 

I've actually seen local casino offer big money raffles show wear mask gamble (what fucking time alive!). Surely treatment nurses doctors free? answer. sadly know truth.

It's strange community, mostly middle class educated, almost white. Even though borders Milwaukee bubble narrow-mindedness, people live die sports. I'm genuinely surprised season suspension, relatives people grew give one damn virus would gladly put kids field surrounded infected people. new phase something else. Wonder next one be? Masked gun people? wonder badly compliance would driven turns require booster every several months. old people India can't really isolate themselves. families know young people going work least one member 60 stays home. underestimate instinctive need socialize.

Definitely direct consequence probably true Definitely seems something else going there. They’re arresting them, taking station reading rights they’re interrogated, later released

You watch many cop shows think police read rights immediately arrest you, you’re interrogated. 

I also note aren’t arresting peaceful protesters. They’re arresting rioters trying tried damage Federal Courthouse Federal buildings. Lmao, talking penis size cannot win argument intelligently? Thanks perfect representations average american. nothing. *You* get sick. virus shitshow.

It sucks bunch dipshits kept one done solution, nothing.

But said, point think expect continue riding get vaccine. There's option, gotta done. bet can't name one protester ""disappeared"". Hey, six months prepare something prepared first place, got cut slack /s.

Seriously, lot hospital overruns even many people. hospitals built kind major event. systems built kind large-scale crisis. Even months going on, still adapted. approx. 1,600 covid hospitalizations throughout Louisiana right now. Spread among facilities throughout state well-run system problem. hospitals ""over run"" 30 patients need COVID care time. knew healthcare fucked country, actually watching real consequence unfold. dont tell us nazi is? Dam Texas Arizona tourists invading New Mexico wearing masks social distancing. swagger around streets squares right come fairly safe state flaunt cooperation rules kept infections low. foolish arrogant time. Go back home plague stricken states can’t follow rules. what's stopping shooter?

And answer cost zero dollars seems optimistic. assumption would insurance deductibles copay going quite hefty monthly cost.  Oh, I'm sorry hear this. hope feels better soon. No, also expect built guarded way people able walk take stuff  get asses handed them. Well one, typically homicide detectives ""solve"" murders, that's main job. upset regular cops solving murders, that's like upset paramedics lousy firefighters. Homicide detectives cops, they're ones conducting traffic stops beating people protests. even homicide cops can't much improve statistic solved murders system presumes innocence unless guilt \*\*proved\*\* without doubt. thing murder usually done secret murderers often try avoid leaving evidence... That's part it, large portion population self control care. family reunion awhile back one overweight obese 20+ people. thing applies anti-depressants. First off....not every idiot US buy gun. Depending live personal legal/medical history quite difficult impossible actually. 
I dont know Germany US state gun laws. 50 separate sets laws. dumb? maybe...doesnt matter, that's now.  


You dont something hard coded document set groundwork country guarantees right bear arms. do. outdated concept? maybe....doesnt matter, that's now.  


The US produced weapons year alone country people...a times over. bad idea? Probably....doesnt matter, that's now.  


Now please explain fuck normal American supposed change literally this?  


Your country hand fully willing look way, falsify emissions records export ""eco-friendly"" 100K diesel cars rest world reaping financial benefits destroying planet....and know what, thats fault. like gun problem US isnt mine.  


And want really go there, maybe look country stopped allowing citizens firearms. answer may surprise you! guarantee people like dependents 2019 bo long 2020 see dime 1200 taxes next April. Because, know, money 9 months us whole lot good. like one movie basically everyone dies find virus came like bat cumming pile pig shit gets put pancake something. think trial, one supposed believe really immunity, point trial check see vaccine works. Noah get boat. exactly kind thing people outside USA surprised hear happen. anything think people surprised stiffly Ike happen often!

I'm gun ownership, they're fun use safely responsibly, damn scary many people USA guns little training restrictions. live within 30 minutes here. thought bars closed Texas? guess one trying say it’s restaurant get around that? Stupid Link didn’t happen sounds right phase three trial. I'm sure people got idea take couple weeks something. better get test results back quicker possibility small laughable. 

Before anyone got front door police would already arrived. Even armed police door rams would hard time getting door, would Spiderman get windows. They're triple glazed roll shutters. Never mind motion detecting lights video cams housing community has.

In short, worth attack get caught. Oh and, may also mention Germany currently living lowest crime rates Well, I'm sure exactly, know definitely want drunk. That's non-negotiable. ever reason cancel season, good opportunity could get. Half Marlins roster Covid, bet decent money least handful Phillies too. Phillies playing Yankees today (if game isn’t canceled); action isn’t taken contain virus, season over. Certified mentally stable gun. Current case fatality rate confirmed infections entire pandemic 7% US.

That's incorrect, 150,000 reported deaths 4.4 million confirmed infections, 3.4%. would argue number reported deaths low 50,000 100,000, still get us 7% bet five days cancel mess. Guessing like 10 days... He's fat almost died. day politician actually something good right thing experiences. Well, cool Americans like deserve much more. U.S. looks like mess (I'm Filipino.) Sure, Philippines lot problems (like, lot, saying bad understatement goodness gracious, government pretty corrupted) least government make wearing masks political issue.

(If Brazilians reading this, please impeach president.) Cool let us borrow time machine. MLB really given worst situation, go play full season 30 full teams likely fail. Still elected bubble that's going screw them. still hope NBA NHL. Especially NHL due 2 smaller bubbles exclusively Canada. whole thing won’t even come close working unless players forced wear masks games. 

And course, it’s Florida ruins it. Currently $800. 40 hours 5 days $20/hour Money ruins everything. It’s blunt instrument power. basis reality it’s Monopoly money forced fight produce wealth fuckers. sit ass decades beyond me. Defect. Infect. takes lot time money think it’s worth it. thought going pandemic killed 1 20 people spread easily. Social distancing proven able reduce spread R0 1. Further, really dangerous old unhealthy. 40 healthy likely die car wreck rona.

It's dangerous - think taking precautions. nearly dangerous initially feared. ok Im board that. Yup. fault. /s Confront stupidity, coddling anti-science/knowledge led today. sure Texas state legal limit carrying .02, means drinking bar restaurant probably limit.

Of course really enforced unless another crime associated it. I'm sure cops regularly get bombed duty carry (I personally know least 4 do.) Gg Departed reference? least Illinois, circuit breakers place. Individual regions moved back phase 3 infections spike instruction goes online. safest thing stay online time students complain value online instruction. Everyone wants eat cake time.

Faculty need remember tenure doesn’t protect massive financial issues like housing money enrollment 40% It’s one rare excursions every employee treated equally. 

Even it’s 60% chance spike Universities still 40% chance infections holding steady decreasing. Orioles .500—I’m cool want shut season call successful year. COVID-19 Cases High They've Always Older Adults Watch Fox News A$$hole$ theoretical question wont answer-

Got em. Pure scum. often? haven’t seen data, sounds interesting. We? dont know this, us arent unhinged pieces shit maybe would like escape madness. Maybe attain kind refugee status end year. get mean but, one dont identify crazy shit. understand though US national parks 320 million visitors year. Canada deal ~25 million 

GSMNP almost many visitors Canada’s national parks combined itself.

So it’s simply “Canadians responsible” parks run better. It’s much smaller operation. participated, there's 50% chance get believe ""real vaccine."" convinced they'd vaccine months getting trial vaccine placebo phase 3 trial? say anything masks? t;dr; America's health system based greed else. Companies everything lock customers proprietary parts can't source them. effort squeeze every penny sick people, chopped knees. work company work many large car dealerships around area. tremendous sales. know else? got huge amounts taxpayer money “relief”. huge company, making record profits, owned millionaire... getting tons free money. sure yeah people upset people like friend works Fantastic Sams got extra unemployment weeks go back work cuz everyone mad able get haircuts reason baby caught covid. Baby seems okay it’s stupid around. comment 5 sources, including interviews nurses geriatric specialists? 'Pro-Lockdown'...BUT...The US big treat one chunk real estate . Now, federal gov't one making call per state basis (but obviously thats pipe dream collection brains), sending TX FL shutdown April made sense. like 'why', extent right. allowed stay open June whenever things picked up, they'd 'pain' NJ felt, motivation end pain.


everything confused inconsistent...but refusing wear mask point simply foolish selfish, unamerican.  it’s predictable. predictable. Handguns bit harder comes actually hitting target moving, even tons tons practice. 
For military practice qualify (a lot) 9mm Bc weapon deployed with. know would struggle situation, Bc also want accidentally fire upon bystander either.
Rifles bit easier imo (and many others opinions also). add scenario, people drinking, general hysteria (which common civilians ready trained for) predictable outcome. hell thought good idea. theory could use weapons fight autocratic government. practice, government developed country like US military side, drones, tanks, helicopters, planes, artillery, ICBMs even nukes side, puny AR-15 really help way. make likely they'll kill outright. able overthrow violent government well developed military side violence.

The ""we weapons protect us government"" argument died first tank rolled production line. course, rocket artillery home, things might different... political five star prospect dies lets face reality, long guns remain cheap easy get, he'll able get one. legally allowed gun simply raises price bit

Unless society whole chooses disarm, achieve gun safety Poor person here. speak experience living around poor folk.

the systematic use of terror especially means coercion. 

Terrorism political, makes sense all... terrorism based religion example Serious question American .. shitfaced bar it’s still legal gun ? think connection that. LOT americans even open windows all. recirculated air. perhaps covid 19 spreads windows closed, keep windows open, airs room house w/e. keep windows open EVERYWHERE europe. perhaps that's reason kicking thing's ass barely seeing cases deaths anymore? 

could possibility? mom thinks too. Texas seems like type place would toothbrush adaptors guns still hold gun brushing teeth. watch video? people see says ""republican""? get it? meeting before, many small community meetings? way rifle target practice! can't take away mans hobby people got shot. begins gf top line alien ware laptop. take apart replace hd assure even expensive stuff cheapest grade electronics connectors make amount don’t dial 911 dudes become huge threat health. FYI OP get around ""This link already submitted"" issue adding tag end URL, eg ""?t=2020""

So [this pdf submittable one original him. Thailand always great place escape, even Middle Class people. much medical tourism there, beautiful country. major European country hit way NYC though; hit hard, lost control regained it. stories unbridled success here.

Sure, let’s conflate Europe realistically could’ve done. Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, New Zealand excellent job containing virus since onset. countries standard.  southeast desperately going miss football. literally right religion way life many. 

You'd think might reflect think ""what could we/I done differently here?""

But instead going mostly get pushback insistence season push regardless. argument turn political 2 seconds. Lol make computer decide whether able see content? US? certainly reported number deaths, actual maybe. problem never properly quarantined US ""house arrest"" dragging out. countries proper lockdowns 2-3 months got control. means takeout, going friends' families' houses visit, stopping Home Depot pick tile kitchen backsplash project always wanted do. half assed lockdown, reopened early, ""plan"" moving forward waiting vaccine. means need sit around home indefinitely one many selfish people decided haircut BBQ important. Take American seen share armed conflicts, gun far best means self defense. weapon like knife club requires close range, strength, agility operate properly. gun requires enough cognitive function point click, still tool requires bit training, nothing comparison learn martial art train body use another type weapon effectively. Sounds great theory unless name Breonna Taylor.

Bear spray would better knife. pretty literal.

I Doubt means people accidentally get close. Plus bonus looking like Duck One thing still understand can't quarantine 80k people hotels? Due lock down, Da Nang abundant hotels empty rooms quarantine people in. government set price ceiling people quarantine pay accommodation. Instead letting 80k people travel freely, safer keep also bringing necessary personnel places needed? Young people honestly taking much seriously older people I’ve seen. Anywhere go people see wearing mask people age 60 Like mowing grass bigger. field instead yard. Tractor instead lawn mower. 

The blade deck cutting back tractor commonly called bush hog. Bush Hog brand it’s used similarly say Kleenex mean tissue. seen Idiocracy chance?  many times mods folks. clintons spent career public service exited billionaires Decades ago took many AP classes take single AP test. family poor afford tests. ridiculous. problem us child-free choice! Hell yeah dude mention Finns whose mother language Swedish, guess fine everyone else.

In spring looked like Somalis over-represented sick statistics, apparently situation better now. US revolution soon enough? Jeez guy, read article. 

I think responsible go bar gun person. register ""good guy"" move me. Alcohol guns mix, we've learned article. Also I'm bartender, bar serve people carry guns (and leaving car change either). I'm saying, actively getting drunk public gun, ""good guy."" instead seasons next year several small tournaments?  place makes 51% money alcohol thus one gun. Even chl. ‘responsible’ gun owners. place shouldnt even open shut may skirting covid restriction bar alcohol sales percentage. 

So every part could avoided bar fines civil suits coming way. People turned away hospitals Texas die home. What's southern strategy? don’t think realize stupid human beings are. marvel achievements, build monuments ourselves, gaze amazement nature like bullshit human artifact like math. Good chance us left 100 years. Phase 3, know aware given placebo find trial over? got placebo could get real deal? go ahead get case get trial? idiots young adults: ""I know him, he's cool, got it""... Facts. 

- money spent coming conclusion unlike OP. changes would require careful, long planned slowly implemented changes.

Statistics indicate problem every idiot roaming free allowed buy gun. saying ""your country nothing like ours"" nothing downplay problems.

HOWEVER

I'm German. problem cars the, many places, existing speed limits. discussion basically guns US. defend claw teeth, others see problem kills people.

So yes, countries different. mean one think existing problems look solutions Well yeah, Texas isn’t great place visit. You’re getting downsides none upsides. Jesus. Everything's fucking rcket US. back grouping judging people broadly color skin?

I’ve since January seeing inept internationally diverse stupidity exceptions. I’d say Americans reddit subs (whatever race) advocating many right steps including masks discussing viral load (back young healthy Italian docs dropping dead) long governments like Iran, Italy, Us, etc implementing steps

Personally think blame accountability needed well intentioned antimask lies used preserve stock healthcare providers Couldn’t seen coming. capitalism dying. Congratulations poison. Welcome reality. People suck going change that. SS money poorly managed put much see gutted left right made practically useless get older.

SS benefit everyone, thats SoCiAlIsM Texas syndrome I'm extreme introvert, even feeling it. depressing part self isolating supposed buying time build testing contact tracing infrastructure control get back out. happening, basically means we're waiting vaccine developed.. still long time away.  Yes! even coming from? It’s aggravating keep seeing pop everywhere now. Facebook. Within extended family. Ugh. reading it, remembered Dallas Texas, story made sense. you’re American apparently Considering police seem actually spot checks Germany, I'd imagine laws least even stricter improper storage Germany Canada (where serious major offense improperly store guns, ammo even kept separate like European countries iirc), yeah vast majority people will.

Theft still issue homes, gun range would pretty big target also issues storage limitations. horn criminals would typically able steal guns, keep range they'd access hundreds thousands guns. will. children, stillbirth/miscarriages, young adults invisible chronic ailments...then become apparent. virus ruthless viral machinery grind on. employee, would take unemployment given opportunity unemployment would definitely ask hearing.

I would take unemployment sue former employer. important part would pressing charges assault, would support civil suit. Eh, bad around week ago. thought don’t want included? C’mon, Moderna. super good news they’re starting Phase III. really believe one key players win virus mean, covering mouth came pandemic back day (if remember correctly). might keep habits got this, least habits remain ""There risk exposure President Vice President.""

Yes, going forward, exposure? amateur contact tracers here? one hang also properly isolating? mean go visit parents whenever can, I'm also lucky bc roommates cat. Hope feel better! Maybe take walk park something get around others? Yes, kinds things scary make us worried. try reduce risks. 

We wear seatbelts every single time drive, even though might get accident handful times life. make sure properly cook chicken *might* salmonella. go doctor feel lump might breast cancer. sorts things prevent injury. 

But reasonable. go doctor whenever slight headache cough. might brain aneurysms sorts deadly infections. go doctor every time, get anything done. Instead go doctor gets worse stop week so. wear full protective gear cycling might break bone. wear helmet that's reasonable. drive cars even though crazy death machines. wear seat belt obey traffic rules. built bunkers safe crashing airplanes chances? make sure government keeps oversight punishes plane companies fuck up. 

So get deadly weapons protect something vanishingly small chance happen? Especially ownership said weapon would sorts negative consequences tied it? 

Much better make sure violent home invaders get caught get harsh sentences, people discouraged that. buying alarm systems sturdy doors. protect country, protect himself. incompetent, ineffectual, also infectious. Virtue signal bro. Wooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!! lmao! Yup, it’s bullshit churches get tax exemptions. It’s another scheme rich get richer. See: Scientology, LDS, every televangelist start. Add history abuse, many don’t know society funding schemes. Brb, going buy drone MOP Wait... thought flu bro???? speaking language politicians understand USA! USA! USA! must terrorists lock up. violent thugs need jailed.  needed bubble situation like nba really feasible baseball could go right playoffs like sports Trump’s America Damnit I’m hungry Dude allowed guns ever again. 

He's opened fire crowded bar real reason.

Man never allowed non-prison-issue toothbrush again. economy longer intangible thing. People starve die whether stay shut reopen due lack social safety nets. good incentive draft legislation establish better safety nets long run short run there’s nothing try fail reopen - works. could wrong, think Fauci said strong chance would vaccine end year. really said that, understand how.  me! karate, jujutsu, Tae Kwon Do. miss jujutsu most. can’t find anything similar near me. 

My sensei Networking prof. late 60s. Loved showing throws me, I’m little, great. learned fall properly, it’s come handy equestrian lol Children going die numbers country never seen. yet industry soon heads another direction “open” sector back up. Bars schools cannot open plagues.

Every region tried failed.

Every region tries fail. Ohio *sense*, thank God. That’s... Crazy. point mask prevent droplet spread. 

It sounds like countries handle differently, doesn’t make sense. exact type government tyranny NRA stands save us from! Fuck bar owners infringing liberties! Unmarked/unidentified feds throwing people vans though? Totally normal tyrannical all.

Edit: sorry angry, forgot sub on; know it’s supposed pure politics. Actually, parent state sued kid could play football still get elearning. state relented days, never went court, win. genius thinks unsafe go school play football! Leave people alone, shameful see jealousy hatred towards rich people.






*This message paid part rich people. Women, elderly, children disabled often faster motivated criminals. dead people cancel cell phone accounts? China also gained 10 million new accounts last months, dead people came back alive? told somebody recently ""hey, im conspiracy theorist too, put fucking mask on"" 

lol. Cool anecdote though

Well, know poor Indian guy born poor died poor really, no. really teach us much here, especially comes history lol. c'mon. post dramatic. would click bait article would totally go it. Yes exactly! parents 70s, diabetic, overweight/obese, seem think long hang small groups outing you’re fine- wtf?

My laws also 70s keeping away us understand distancing.

We’re still making wfh baby work really hard. man needs Buffalo Wild Wings, takes assume funds thermal cyclers get test results ASAP. Oh, think thought little extra weight. Like I'd say like adele (before adele lost weight). Guess bit miscommunication then, oops. That's used unethical deterrent \*some\* employers, policy would changing real fast soon challenged former employee would good chunk change troubles.  like board games? Sports? Something helped setting virtual versions things used enjoy friends. play board game Code Names people virtually now. There's online version Zoom pull board up. I've also set virtual game watches friends (before rewatching reruns, live sports back!). Zoom pull game TVs. weekly Zoom happy hour group used go restaurants monthly. I've done virtual cooking classes too. know going out, helps get boost socializing. also watch travel shows occasionally get excited places want travel over. Finally, health insurance? Many insurance companies waiving copays telehealth therapy right now. feeling depressed, consider talking someone telehealth. get this! people won’t bear arms fight black lives open fire fucking beer. 

Jesus Christ America get priorities right. constitution allows people dumb offensive long physically hurting anyone making threats. 1/3 teachers obvious trumpets, many else work due jobless rural area. think local unemployment 15%, higher even area states. Gg? anyone got front door police would already arrived. 

People understand big America is. nearest cop is, good day, 30 minutes away lots America. that's assuming he's stretched entire county that's big entire city already engaged. never protecc ignorant think that, everyone else follow guide lines...

In Germany do, either follow rules, remarkably similar grew Canada, lose license forever.

This guy sort automated rifle car? That's allowed here. Patron bar CCW? That's also allowed here.

Hell, can't even remember last time saw bar fight country. Rest world ignore Brazil, Mexico India. 

 mean developed nation's?  haven’t able smell fresh air months due that, I’m hell lonely. Getting little depressing me. I’m trying say is, it’s everyone. Yes, organize way turn season tournaments. Like, Hockey, say, Pacific vs. Atlantic division six weeks one city. Everyone plays everyone. Metro vs. Central goes elsewhere. everyone's played 82 games. husband's company released something saying coming back January 2021 earliest too. 

The declining birth rate means I'll never see benefits since program insolvent time retire. would rather invest money myself. minority them. spain florida EU? police departments across state refusing enforce mask orders 'theyre mandates laws' least bullet microorganisms blown flash hot powder. get stabbed, get several inch deep puncture wound full whatever hell knife blade skeezy character goes around stabbing people. headline ""Florida man travels Texas shoots bar denied access covid pandemic""? think okay slap someone intentionally either without escalation part. Even feel individual deserves that's wise, objective bystanders call aggressor, law you, make antimasker dig position harder. community normally pretty level headed. Yeah insurance companies insure things guaranteed go badly.

Say want ethics... know they're doing. much insidious ""doesn't care"". guiding re-election campaign strategy, ignore minimize virus force economy open create temporary illusion economy great (no matter cost lives). lot overblown machismo.

Scar heart

The German doctors, attached University Hospital Frankfurt, performed MRI examination heart one hundred cured corona patients, average two half months diagnosis. patients ages 45 53, two-thirds admitted hospital, two ICU ventilation. Sixty every hundred patients found signs inflammation heart muscle tissue, doctors write journal [JAMA 32 patients scar tissue result, visible MRI images.



The inflammation apparently leads death myocardial cells formation scar hold tissue together, explains De Boer. large number patients signal substance troponin measured blood, indicates myocardial cells lost. combination blood count patterns MRI scan makes 'obvious', says De Boer, damage heart. well known coronavirus enter heart: organ, like lungs, many antennae, so-called ACE2 receptors, virus uses penetrate cells. 

 

None patients studied acute heart problems became ill. Whether hospitalized medical history matter post-corontal heart damage occurred.



Scar tissue heart muscle serious consequences time. German patients examined, damage ventricle minor may enough cause heart failure, thinks cardiologist Piek, scar tissue found may lead cardiac dysrhythmia. Whether also occur patients cannot predicted, professors stress. Scar tissue resulting inflammation different resulting heart attack, explains De Boer: possible scar become smaller long time.

It’s incredibly frustrating hard get things done way. Hmm, that's lot kids sick disease affects old people. No, PPP (forgivable) loan businesses.

The $600 week reported taxes, pay taxes (surprise!) like unemployment benefit. confirm this. I'm wilderness search rescue team East coast. number incidents we've called past months staggering - least four five within last week.

If major capitalistic companies taking seriously, think people would realize ""liberal hoax"" ""being blown proportion/just flu."" Grow That's Mormons. hero-worshipping. read first post? began with:

`I agree radically defund police rethink enforce laws resources send 911 called.`

To drive point home: agree question responsibilities give police question do, it. crises solved medical professionals social workers cops, prevented investing communities people, particularly color.

That said, saying ""if can't solve it, fuck exist"" comes murder case wholly unrelated said above. Basically, yes, question police. reasonable person would infer questing police tactics, motives, responsibilities, funding, accountability etc ... instead arguing abolishing police outright, even aren't, say. That's point. 


EDIT: guess I'm trying say is: think severely defund police forces -- still need homicide detectives. Part point lockdowns build enough ability test, trace contain sustainable level, figuring reopen safely.

Many US states similar transportation law. 

Though, gun storage like recommended... required states. I’d say nazis threat. Damn no. canceled every flight planned well 2021.  Drastically increased detection rates compared early stages epidemic certainly account lower CFR. estimates IFR neighborhood 0.5-1.5% whereas current CFR US near 3.4%. 

As epidemic continues, testing access continue increase one would expect gap CFR IFR narrow. Moreover, IFR may drop due improvements treatment. 

On whole makes sense reported death rates would drop time. Moreover, substantial time-lag increase case counts increase death counts due number factors. biggest is, course, take number weeks infected person die illness. second factor one typically sees cascading effect early spread disease, starting highly connected exposed individuals working way contact network. moment connected seem young experience lower fatality rates. Maybe thinking 19 player allowed enter bubble tested positive? that's exact opposite bursting bubble.

They test daily, need two negative tests 24 hours apart enter bubble. Wha?

Yes does. kind established fact second wave Spanish Flu carried soldiers returning Europe.

If recently learned Flu recent articles tied Covid, understand gap knowledge.

Recent articles highlighted ""they didnt follow rules"" part left ""it spread soldiers"" part. (Although Liberty Loans fiasco certainly aspect hadnt parade, wouldnt breakout. soldiers issue, crowd.)

But really recent ""twist"". interested Spanish Flu whole life. always one geeky little nerd facts. *always* said spread soldiers. since covid thing narrative tweaked bit contemporary audiences.

They're still waiting tests June come back. Except lot stillbirths highly increased COVID areas since COVID thing... Strange coincidence. Sadly lot people even groups suffering people acknowledging it. Message remains same. Joke news. Next. “One like other” since 9/11 happened once...

So al-Queda didn’t employ part systematic campaign? Maybe hold back sarcasm example doesn’t make sense. also don’t even like definition it’s one presented maybe take community terrorized, even stupid chud's goal revenge inconvenience.

Someone terrorized isn’t sufficient necessary condition terrorism. People terrorized robbing banks makes scared deposit cash person doesn’t make action terrorism. Likewise blow bank oppose capitalist system even one ends terrorized it’s still terrorism.

Terrorism action + intention. would one thing shooter went intention shooting people place let people without masks. seems like guy got pissed couldn’t stay shot place revenge. that’s terrorism every felony intimidation, aggravated assault, brandishing also terrorism.

For brief moment, certain handful people, actually succeeded narrowing income inequality. Reduced cut hours wasn’t issue, automation wasn’t issue.

We make regular, monthly stimulus staple economy UBI. Whether people work not. 

No one would making less going back work- they’d making more.

Then, people would truly choice stay workforce health community’s health trust China's numbers Arizona reporting 0 deaths. Uhm, realize reason fine dining service jobs highly sought low turnover compared others, right? know think restaurant service real job, believe career ladder requires hard work expertise rise through.

Nah man, really come skill. ever managed restaurant know. knew exactly servers real studs, that's took home far money (10-15% more) peers. get Hallelujah I'm actually low key hoping that's case. that's comment responded said all. far unknown. Every major country pandemic response plan, especially China gone similar outbreaks before.

They knew do. However, political structure operating China prevented acting sooner decided cover outbreak initially.

That literally subject article. suggest read it. Back people would probably physically attacked idiots (100% rightfully). 2020 seems everyday, normal news. htink means *socially* tolerated. People like run fuck country, yet thrive. disastrous approach it’s result bad decisions bad messaging early pandemic.

Outdoor recreation safe, immune-boosting effects, replaces riskier activities like home play dates.  Closing parks actively helping virus know that, might validates rest lemmings fears.

At time Im also trying reconcile constantly shifting numbers see deadly virus is. It’s certainly worse flu, last calculations (at least CA) .5% case fatality rate you’re age 65. That’s current data clearly shows. think message flattening curve avoid overcrowding hospitals still seems relevant one conversation really needs go back versus “we’re going die” — science doesn’t show that. Wear mask get life IMO.

Edit: clarifying percentage remark. yesterday: 

Under 65 positive cases: 399,229

Under 65 deaths: 2,104 (1,514 age 50-64)

If every bit media eat happens agree stances things probably open alternate opinions.

You easy access world, use it. Ask questions people countries. Look AL Jazeera countries low bias international papers. see something critical country, find why, they're actually right getting angry defensive.

I military long time, I've lot countries, seen opinions America great, we're totally correct.

If anything time gave appreciation full shit everything be, important find really fed truth, asshole.

I loved military, love country, holy shit wrong side literally everything right now. We're literally kind place would previously sending operations change, bad. see everyone angry, places super critical, look find why, important.

Would trust Chinese vaccine? claimed 3 gorges dam would protect largest flood 1000 years danger collapsing start July. Back built western experts told Chinese build quality subpar steel bar welding standard. ignored calling racial discrimination. Home prices outpaced inflation years. They’ve gained enormously appreciating asset fault own.  need cash they’ll fine. Horrible take. Stop comparing apples estimates oranges.

This misleading two reasons. First, time period. importantly, comparing counting estimating.

Here's post wrote subject:
 doesn’t CDC base seasonal flu mortality estimates death certificates specifically list influenza may lead death causes, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. recognized many years influenza underreported death certificates. ... Additionally, deaths – particularly among 65 years older – associated secondary complications influenza (including bacterial pneumonias). ... counting deaths influenza recorded death certificate would gross underestimation influenza’s true impact.

Now COVID19, counting deaths death certificates people assuming numbers exaggerated. No, numbers *grossly* underestimated. 

If estimated COVID19 way estimate flu (using hospitalization rates estimate deaths) we'd find death total would far higher. Here's another CDC pneumonia influenza deaths subset total deaths associated influenza occur year, may 2 4 times higher complications also considered.

Compared estimates valencia oranges blood oranges, see outbreak far worse commonly reported numbers. ratio complications, US estimate alone coronavirus would 300,000-600,000. world's estimate would 1,300,000 2,600,000. Considering smaller timeframe, COVID19 could close 50 times deadly flu. 'napkin numbers', roughly [the minimum thrown scientists recent sophisticated calculation called infection-fatality rate, paired past months’ worth data, latest best estimates show COVID-19 around 50 100 times lethal seasonal flu, average.

People dying street morgue trucks actually there. CNN showing video bodies loaded truck agenda cause 'something' happen, people actually dying.  assume truth false cause looks like movie.  

I blame people now. blame April asking mortality rates, races people getting sick, thinking per capita rates means still go bar drink friends.

It apt show shock, sadness anger 100,000+ people dying, normal person trying convince bad enough family BBQ.  

A critical thinking person look news story research determine real not. know scientists are, work, form group opinion listen data adjust view.  People scared think things actually bad, grasp onto straws uphold view everything fine, media get you. 

People skip opinion pieces political reviews happening rely scientists collective opinion.  

I need Sinclair tell someone pissing leg. Oh I'm sorry, data derived 8 interviewees extrapolated 1 million detainees good enough you? expecting? Actual academic integrity? None really applies, argument whether conservatives worse. conservative, course aren't. see dnc fucking awful destroyed like GOP. change fact one party fight that's it. democrats say, direct opposition, means science fucking window. ""deep state"" ""the DNC run pedophiles"". see party's flaws, one example conservative leadership managed convince conservatives democrats rich people want take literally opposite. pedophilia problem rich upper class, political party. it’s time put politics aside work it’s now. would say miracle kept manifesting US long time. always amazed US somehow able keep crazy managed, checks balances seemed work odds. longer worked ...

Americans abused Constitution decades, turning caricature itself, propped stilts would crumble ... Trump came kicked away stilts. difficult psychopath, empathy cares nothing either America, Constitution, democracy, GOP, economy people. Noted dismissed Exactly! need law granting immunity anyone confesses self-incriminates anything contact tracer. Oh, understand. want to. virus coming sea food.  think possible community spread occurred SA testing ramped up. think testing massive part it, one highest testing per capita total tests continent. Look Nigeria, pretty dense country, especially around cities, 400k tests 40k cases.

Again, I'm qualified enough say that, feel combination density cities, incompetence citizens politicians, [lack good increased testing capacity leads surge cases. almost situation USA, except murderous 'politicians' - Trump DeathSantis come mind fact experts, like Fauci even Birx, administration refuses listen addition, overall economic mobility low

Jesus fuck UK even worse regard... bad don’t want . need start putting endangerment charges people covid things cause think it’s way people take serious Donald Trump president Puerto Rico Traditional Chinese.

Epoch Times.

And call proof? Yep! said another comment around somewhere, unfortunately simple injecting dead / inert viral bodies. go (I'm biologist immunologist, speaking extremely broad terms here) order trigger creation antibodies ""exposure."" ""hook us artificial intelligence interface"". 

honestly, would like that. makes smarter whatever. There’s big debate kids start school. don’t think talking point. research generally shows pushing preschool doesn’t provide benefit. isnt harmful, doesn’t provide benefit. looked first time someone mentioned SF poop. can't believe problem. would obvious solution aside addressing homeless problem budget nice self cleaning toilets Europe? mean public health, comfort, probably property value wants pay premium live poop city. put public toilets? Guys... US isn’t part WHO... Reply opinion Anyone Europe could use roommate? 

I'm male, 35, liberal, writer work mental health field. 

I get country scientists opined right based opinion data Bat Lady provided. None independent data sources. course would reach conclusion did. So, ""just flu""? Yeah, still can't believe huge public gatherings going past couple months. lived Texas years staggering many old friends talking Covid conspiracies. I've lost lot respect I've given trying talk sense them. They'll get reality check eventually. I'm sorry common sense caught sea idiots. According hospital bill, dads kidney stone removal would've cost 20,000 dollars. talked financial people hospital got waived since insurance 3 years, probably wouldnt car right now. 

Hes disability benefits due nerve disorder, still cant get insurance. American health system pile flaming garbage set top another pile money. meant note distinction ""US's claim China like"" ""what China really like"".

US ""China now"" actual China controlled outbreak effective lockdowns, wearing masks mass testing. US China getting 5-digit number infections day. Denmark, Netherlands ~30+ days paid vacation + paid public holiday.

Germany 30+ mandatory days paid vacation. 

The Bundesurlaubsgesetz (Federal vacation law) states work 6-day-week must least 24 days vacation.
In practice jobs get 30 days 5 day week voluntary basis however. really thought generation would value science facts previous generations. clearly wrong, never seen blatant ignorance futility young generation showing everywhere world. leaders tomorrow, idiots running amok. dropped /s people go still go places people aren’t selfish morons go too. Like grocery stores.

These morons killing people trying best stay safe.

Please tell can’t fucking obtuse.  motherfucking late statement. damage done obviously warned before. useless statement. please keep going 2020. Username tho Express opinion, trying do?? blame everyone One problem is, think “the President” shit. other, house senate full rich, lazy asshats thrall lobbyists. Let’s eliminate lobby’s random assignments real people house/senate. I’d fucking trust shop mechanic vote interest someone could afford run office. guy Texas’ Go ahead ask many cases Taiwan. working Chinese government? Yes Costa Cruises opening Mid August. wonder what's gonna happen Baseball rosters bigger NBA NHL still like half size NFL team.

And traveling... they’re playing within divisions (and 10 games opposing league division), they’ll mostly traveling 4-5 cities within geographic region. time Florida Marlins travel California, Colorado, Texas, anything like that. 

But yeah, planes suck wish teams like New York, Washington, Philadelphia, etc... would “personal” travel arrangement since they’re close. HA HA AMERICA BAD UPVOTE PLS thing unacceptable simply one can't make informed decisions.

You get make shit facts far I'm concerned.

I place swimming pools. cover might cost get earth dig removed, depending circumstances(if need pay pass on).

I cover first meeting.

Imagine walking people day begin digging going ""by way, 4k get earth removed"" without warning potential cost?

How one ever make informed decision system? That's part strategy. exhausted populace much easy manipulate well-rested energetic one.

That's one reason Trump something insane almost every week. desperately tries keep everyone looking new direction focus huge problems. Well, Spanish flu... flu? bad enough?  currently thread US providing coronavirus data time, data everyone else provided.

China controlled outbreak point easily isolate batch test zero asymptomatic/presymptomatic spreaders, US not.

Your beliefs complete opposite reality. It’s pandemic, people need suck up. one NEEDS FaceTime physical touch. Stop putting people’s lives danger personal preferences. JFC don’t understand people babies this. one says it’s easy everyone, it’s necessary. lol, outdoor, mask fine. Notice outbreaks attributed protests police violence. masks closer 6 feet apart. Yes pretty red geographically, population-dense areas pretty liberal. 2019, Lexington Louisville makeup 37% population, Northern Kentucky area lean left well. 

Having democratic governor anomaly. quickly checking past 10 governors, they've mostly democrat. I've recently started getting local politics. felt like lost cause before, Andy fucking nailed every way far. true professional cares people.

Also, even though Beshear great, reason Bevin really, really hated lot people. rightfully so, he's total shithead. Katrina earlier would ended bush actually come conversation, TBH. damn hard get mouth breathers even wear masks stand big fucking crowds gabbing like morons is, think focus getting point first. Literally bare minimum every country planet nailed months ago. 😉 Idk that’s asked He's certainly Jim Jonesing shit USA right now. Drinking covid hoax kool aid. Wuhan time even testing kits. Well starters, Europeans anti science   Yeah maybe try hold napkin long (30 stories) would nightmare many people touch buttons. appreciate taking time respond kindness. I’ll try get opportunity presents itself. Stay safe gonna get bottle stuff like $90 $300 tiny ass 1 oz bottle.

Was pain issues sleep fucked up, try wind 11 12 read stuff im wide awake till 3am. I'm panama city Pensacola. Busiest tourist season ever here. fucking insane. matter. Still winning.


In seriousness though, many, many us Texans want drastically different leadership direction state government handling this. know we're racing cliff, people actually power something straight give single flying fuck general populace. wear masks try stay home, cities like mine decided proceed in-person instruction schools. feel helpless. store employees provided pepper spray safety! Shooting bar assault weapon, typical day TX, thought bars closed? someone obeying Governor TX? GASP Wow great post. ignorant. Nature way forcing reality unto people. several reported us uk European Union. Honestly can't understand keep sucking money bank tell to. made hard cancel purpose. website allow opt out. can't opt phone. alone class-action lawsuit. tell charge anyway ""didn't tell wanted told."" conservatives bleat out? ""Actions consequences.""? it? That's true - Trump said deaths could reach 100,000-200,000 nothing. 
He nothing. 
Here are. already offices India. still huge workforce US. know that's huge concern Google employees. Maybe companies. Cue anti mask/freedumb workout rage videos. came back island camping. first time years saw trash bags left site, clearly stated 'carry in, carry out' park. spoke ranger, told that's second time day got reports trash left.

I feel sites implement reporting mechanisms, someone reported breaking rules, banned booking sites years. disgusting. think people work end rope. Pandemic rolling crisis affect us long virus gone. would sarcastic? I'm talking when/if reopen again. 5 months fyi.....  theory, bubble location matter. long bubble solid. help people more, help too. See also exposure studies suggesting much virus inhale role severe disease becomes, possible still got infected mask mask filtered chunk virus ended milder illness inhaled full dose. virus .3% chance killing someone age. That's risk I'm alright taking.

Don't fall trap thinking death negative outcome virus. learning disease attacks major organs body - heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, brain. One recent study showed almost quarter young Covid patients still suffering symptoms months officially recovered. Doctors know even symptoms abate. could facing entire generation people disabled Covid. Please get complacent. novel disease, yet know long-term effects, we're seeing far pretty worrying. Possibly, there's nowhere else live.

You either commit *no* physical presence all, kinda make current housing safe made limit contact people possible. lady behind desk PF busy looking phone care anything. won’t, shouldn’t. Forcing kid sit day unhealthy plain simple isn’t gonna work. suggestion create reward-based system make want learn. mom used money incentive get good grades. whatever think kid wants, whether that’s video game time getting prize something lol looking successful Taiwan defending virus. Taiwan Youtubers take videos outdoors without masks on.

They always rely Government. needs ""Sunday Numbers"" flair tag. pretty awesome! hope works. found American soldier got invaded 4 Americans. get accurate Monday numbers, ever, Tuesday ridiculously high number. reporting absolutely mess. I'm board this. saying anti-maskers get treated, absolutely medical ethics give treatment someone disagree them, know dangerous get! doctors tried use precedent giving care anti-maskers deny coverage anyone subjectively feel harming others? Even murderers get access medical treatment. 

Insurance denial, hand, great way punish without actually physically harming them. much hate American health care system want help insurance companies get even richer, floating insurance companies might great way get people pay attention. People care others' safety still care wallets. Northern US thinking, southern Florida thinking. It’s ‘easy’ lose weight. It’s ‘hard’ stay committed. 

April 11th episode BP control week so, control, mean borderline hypertension.

I 33 years old, 5’10” weighed slightly 200 lbs bad day. ‘fat’, pleasantly plump, dad bod, chubby, whatever want call. hid well, believed ‘looked good enough’. 

Talking doc, two choices; Get ready BP medication lose weight.

I decided lose weight. downloaded app called Lose It, tracks food intake. tracked intake, ensured stayed within amount calories allowed basic exercise, as; go couple walks day (morning/night) sneak extra walk two day time allowed. originally move goal around 450 Apple Watch moved 600, hit daily.

That’s it, that’s did. 

I 172-175 lbs (I’ve stuck since early July). 

For me, mostly food intake. would problem drinking soda two, eating bag chips whatever sitting questions asked. hard deny items? bet. However, days relapse eat like shit, that’s OK, ensure better next day maybe sneak quick walk jog. important part allow bad days pile up, twice there.

Use app (or app) look many calories things are, you’ll amazed much you’re consuming.

Swap soda sparking water, regular water. Eat high protein yogurt vs regular helps fill up. Countless, actual, real substitutes exist, need find like. thing save us vaccine. Otherwise whole world eventually get infected, matter what. kid scribbling wall. timeline world. sucks bit experimenting children Waves travel, man. travel. good lord. many point say, see, meet large groups, hoax social distance. Sad that' show lowest common denominator thinks. Yeah, hopefully one benefit pandemic reanalysis working America. sick leave, work home options. Maybe competition employers. ""Hey, pay guys/pay making also allow work home."" problem Facebook way is. Liberals people science left Facebook *en masse* filled void conspiracies far right politics. lost voice fight popular social media platform overrun **literal** fake news people actually vote. 

The damage Facebook 2016 nothing compared damage it’s going election. Watch, come September / October see massive amount anti-Biden nonsense popping Facebook it’ll sway scare voters. 

The left should’ve stayed Facebook fought misinformation battles voice fight. Supposedly larger group predictable humans are. US situation 40% people lock step one man, nobody knows going do. complicates solution space. Didn’t early studies say virus could live copper hours?  literally league  People spend £1000s commute, especially around Greater London. Salaries reflect cost. Without cost salaries look less appealing sure. company brought us back soon could. (former) boss said people work home shit lie it.....Except fact worked home projects got sent time office. think upset minions control. article goes detail.
 
Nothing twisted.
 
Nothing misleading. wearing “masks” Walmart US makes wear masks pandemic.  Yup, worst day March 30 (18.89%)

And really bad, 4877 people tested symptoms/were contact someone confirmed. others asymptomatic people get tested travel countries goes show laws way lax heard watched program it. people dying would say silly but...it's not. That's salaries work, though. firm's decision, shift whole labor market. WFH means there's lots competition jobs geographic location longer deal breaker, salaries go down. No, weeks behind testing due labs delayed due terrible federal response labs capable handling many.

Last week saw highest positive cases single day, slowing down? know sounds counterintuitive Forbes article saying thing. don’t get either. Maybe someone’s knowledge google searching better mine explain why. I’m sorry voters heads clogged garbage media cranks masses longer able think logically...I feel bad you. Yes know. He's awful throughout pandemic. Actually number viruses spread almost entire population. strains Herpes, HPV, anelloviruses. Nearly everyone coronoviruses, rhinoviruses, influenza.

Cov-sar-2 extremely contagious, mitigation/prevention done, could easily reach way beyond 20-30% norms worse? Tbh want real deal thats walmart. Regarding last paragraph. worries long term health effects possibility losing limb? Honest question. Swing!.....and miss. Woe there, never said anyone lazy. said can't keep $600 week forever. Many people starting go back work. situation mean situation rest country. 

I also never said $100 week cuts. I'd prefer slow drop benefits next 6-12 months jobs close normal, places allowed work. please realize jobs never return. Many people change careers, start again, go different career paths. ways make things work, federal assistance place, great time learn new skills help new marketplace. North Korea: actually DPRK , *Democratic People's Republic Korea* , true east Germany, also communist Dictatorship called ""German Democratic Republic"" think ""the Country call ""democratic"" less actually is. really carefull countries calling Happy Happy Freedom Land Dictatonia agree, USA nothing Puerto Rico  many people think actually glorify it? Loud internet people often small minority wonder people sang praises Vietnam's handling COVID-19 jump call ""draconian""? can't weapons designed nothing murder mind.

*I ReSpOnSiBlE oWnEr, nEvEr ShOt AnYoNe. IdIoTs GuNs* bad ""banned stores"" mean ""banned stores kinds"" inhale chlorine rest us getting tired inhaling methane gas shit! boggles mind people actually went trouble requesting block mandate. Imagine feeling strongly enough desire endanger others request legal proceedings. Sheer stupidity selfishness. masks automatically equal coronavirus? It’s best guess minimum wage adjusted inflation. It’s really
Possible pure conversion like see “how much dollar 1950 worth” calculators purchasing power actually kind nuanced. example it’s hard calculate dollar 1950 money housing insanely cheap comparison today. Hey now, dare political! Putting someone something love...total PoS would think, went whole video, see one staff member attempt deal them. Although it’s America dressed like Nazis, would afraid life. need AI algorithm implemented stores cameras spot noses suspend membership card. totally feel you. dad always like “then haven’t actually known anyone get it???” it’s like isn’t happening directly isn’t happening all, thought learned kindergarten. friends coworkers understand fortunately neighbors apt building huge outdoor parties social distancing multiple days week, can’t even go walk without crossing path. landlord course cares everyone paying rent, actual safety. it’s pretty unbelievable—before knew deeply divided nation every issue, it’s really hit home pretty much live completely different planes reality. makes hard go daily life without feeling insane. Yeah heard rumors, possibly untrue, party thrown well known family town. know area likely know last name, street named (where houses 800,000+). real estate developers, stone asphalt, etc... Oh yikes. Sorry hear :( It’s definitely preposterous! catch guy? incompetent police? Trump dog whistle terrorist attack (bombs shootup) refuses concede election.  Goal show us happen try remove January.  yes still terrorism even perp white. know agree treat like colony. would rather guys country nothing USA. know Michigan. Also illegal carry bar. strict beginning, governments hesitant stamp insidious disease curtailing individual freedoms.

An example social distancing Netherlands mandatory face masks. It’s talk, talk, talk...but backbone enforce. nervous feel bad happened US. stay way. major assets tanking, keep valuable one. further, last recession prices started going nuts, mortgage stay (for part) value dollar goes down, paying amount. right. Eff you, lazy made stupid decisions never got mine imma hold back money pay mistakes much better economic policy. agree, Dems great right now. one side *noticeably worse* other. best solution obviously get rid 2 party system, neither DNC RNC would like get rid it, one side much likely enact change. I'll give 3 guesses one is. voting, voting write-in protest step right direction.

It's hate centrists, disagree them, totally valid political opinion. ""both sides"" centrists can't stand. doubt that’s true, certainly Reddit tell it’s certainly true Canada perfect every way. 

But, it’s worth pointing poorly USA rates many metrics...it’s still often top cancer survival rates. part protects others getting germs, studies recently found face covering lessen amount coronavirus viral load exposed to, potentially meaning less severe symptoms get sick. would mean protected wearing mask! True data people peak physical condition. Kinda crazy guys rolling dice future earnings guinea pigs covid whatever. I’m saying it’s sole reason, I’m saying probably identified area significant cost reduction ran it, without COVID none would happened anything help realize bubble time. results phase 2 trials? compare oxford vaccine? would commute matter, expense? nice, it?

""Baseball weekend."" That's get. weekend. *facepalm* Think want, that's awesome. 

Direct statement. hiding anything using nice words. He's right. EU (GB) USA WAY fat average.  agree everything you’ve said entirely. 

I shot 10 years. gets drawing bolstering concealment safer reputation. trains shoot pressure, even though it’s clock, completely changes dynamic. think everyone carries mandatory 4 5 IDPA style matches pressure show still shoot. 

Standing firing range calmly putting rounds target leisurely pace little common tests CCW holders actually need. lol, I'm pissed off. money = food most... yes, expressed wrong way read whole post? know homeschooled entire pre-college educational career. highly educated parents chose teach - amongst things want learn public school (like babies come from! thought pregnancy impossible unmarried women!).

She absolutely horrified learned blackface overcompensated trying personally apologize every black student, professor, staff worker campus. mortified ended transferring another school end semester.

It's impossible know deliberately sheltered from. Teach kids become person grow up. place full reliance tourism. Things happen everytime something happens always panic.. even though plan they'd fine Wut’d u say 😡🐿 keep comparing NHL/NBA MLB? MLB bubble apt comparison. Could bubble break down? Sure seems unlikely. Given bubble worked like 2 weeks NBA, doubt need worry much. supposed backup absence something? made unsubstantiated claim, burden proof you.

With due respect, stating ""there food shortages"" hardly substantiated. size economy irrelevant, fact food grown UK accounts half consume; EU contributes 30%. think people going starving death, think lot people surprised appalled shortages common foodstuffs. Even without customs issues COVID surely already demonstrated shortages happen Yellowhammer report totally irrelevant seeing circumstances changed beyond recognition. Including totally different government, additional year prepare eventuality. 

You must living another world think government used additional year wisely. words Lord Buckethead, ""it shitshow"". whatever, go ahead live fantasy world unicorns prancing sunlit uplands, time tell either way. Let ask again: many human lives trivial you? Republicans pushing kids go back school want Trump wants, Trump wants kids back school wants everyone think everything fine back normal re-elected.  That's it. welcome stay safe, want trust We're never getting we? ever heard computer virus? Fascinating ill happen next six months rhetoric juxtaposed COVID. keep jar - nevermind Mine, Ruesch Mueller: Well done! can't sit back say nothing, never expect idiocy belligerence people already stupid disrespectful enough pull crap. can't even argue back coherently. never would've gotten anywhere them, standing others gets point rest world. America tolerate Nazis. Apparently Walmart someone tells acceptable, keep good work! problem bubble close friends may things I’m aware of. example girlfriends close friend met us paddleboarding last weekend. brought partner, mentioned briefly cousins BBQ previous weekend. contact tracing puts bubble everyone party, god knows they’ve spending time lately.

It’s hard like go see friends safe outdoor environment keep distance. treat everyone like virus point. afraid passing poor mother lifelong smoker. I’m afraid might get seriously ill worse catches it. friend mine bought house Portland, Oregon last crash like, 30k. might one. depends quickly get trial results. could well earlier enough data. went vote! Except course need people rent / buy bigger place home office, even space people go work. Pay probably go requiring workers workspace home. surefire way making dreams reality. Yes, Taiwan govt much better health care wise population large. question bad be. lot radiation Taipei already - example. measured various areas photos many antennas/towers. Dad friend doctor..always telling people sinus issues, etc...  want, I'll send via PM video and/or photos.

Well..I start COVID19_5G Reddit March...it's private moment. update right now. interesting me....I've done TON analysis / research...but send email people know, that. appreciate it...so want access...let know.

Projecting 5G overwhelm innate defense (Multiple factors) Taiwanese keeps COVID bay. 5G requirement get sick/die though...4g LTE+ long-term wi-fi/other radiation enough. 

This take varying amounts time per country / region. Depends scope/scale/timeline 5G rollout well. Funny...HK Japan turned systems recently...and problems....delay factor sickness / cases. Recent case rise may baked even without 5G...long incubation I've really upset hornet's nest. I'm getting stung RedBees!  

Must run away! less getting folks work later later as:
1) Make environment folks best work
2) Finding retaining talent HUGE challenge. part arms race attract retain top talent. True US catching fast. surpass deaths/population France next. US several times daily deaths Europe *combined* days (over 700 million population) - that's including Russia, worst hit current weeks. Florida daily deaths EU.

Initially densest international hubs got hit hardest, mostly likes around NY, Milan, Belgium, Madrid, London. 

Now much lower levels developed world, steam rolling primarily developing countries, US closest company with.

Before long US, population 330 million, deaths (currently 150k) Europe, population 740 million (currently 201k) spikes nearly bad US currently experiencing? right person life gives much strength even death touch you.❤ plenty time, Spain even done yet. Couldnt trumps administration manipulating numbers... know probably facetious pick 25 innings, that's even 3 total games. 

I actually curious, math. team played 3 game series plus two teams played 4 game series. That's total 46 games 414 innings. 

But, 4 games went extra innings ended 10th. first Yankees/Nationals game rained 6 innings. total, adds extra inning final count.

So season ended today games played, entire baseball season would lasted 415 innings. population forced take

And millions anti vaxxer's kids forced take somehow, count that. conspiracy theories already circulating facebook doubt. overly familiar Michelle Obama's lunch program per se. understand wanted everyone practice portion control, eat fruits vegetables. wish something would done supermarket level. shopped week yesterday $5.99 small carton blackberries....but $1.99 large bag potato chips.  NTA staying home. 

I personally would find trip Florida anything relaxing enjoyable right now, that's me, guess. 

It given would get sick got - household transmission happens, seem sure thing means. 

I would stay home sure. Ok found used 2 dollars lids Always masked..but slipped times.. would take mask off, car put again. ran hand sanitizer, times went store etc able sanitize.
 One things noticed also, going restaurant pick food, (Houston area) always packed. mean packed. nobody masks on, lots virus particle air, glasses/eye covering on, easily go eye. 
 safest lockdown. minimize stuff like happening got round testing done 4,425 tests 0 positives I’m sorry I’m sure follow you. Could reword first bit me? convinced til Goodell unveiled amazing plans NFL created assume based faulty logic article posted couple days ago. people idiots, that’s politics now. Imma honest, someone high school this, lunches degraded quality significantly, ended voluntarily making worse choices bringing food home campus lunch, eating all.

The program good health face, horrific student morale overall consumption, barely increase school lunch funding, simply stricter guidelines. I'm people wearing kinds symbols public. least know dealing with, never interact them. like self imposed scarlet letter treatment. spot shit heads mile away avoid them. still don’t get it. American citizenship isn’t American nationality. US language culture foreign Puerto Rico. Puerto Rican’s American Indians Raj British, Irish. point though, going stop flying lobster Maine do? think Summer 2021 reasonable expectation things MOSTLY SAFE across localities. Even immunocompromised peers flyer advertised Instagram billed event Liberian Independence Day party complete twerking contest free food jungle juice. Videos Instagram show people dancing, drinking smoking appears hookah inside clearing area, police received 911 call neighborhood resident said people left party broken residence damaging property. police said determined family member caller original party invited people back house.

Liberian Independence Day. Really. twerking. hookah. 

Can even find Liberia map??! Yea man, come on. Viral clash. see feel Gary Bettman NHL hands best commissioner sports. hoard masks medical professionals. everyday working people like chance get n95.. Nobody well economically global economy. thinking 20s previous century economies local (except empires, course).  biggest question happens people can't pay bills currently evicted? know eviction lengthy, multi-stage process, someone starts eviction *now* (or yesterday) wondering finish process despite new eviction protections, process started protection lapsed. 

If can, think we're still going witness sea evictions coming months. know enough subject know that's valid concern/loophole. true vast majority work comp claims involving substances cause long term illness. Asbestos. Carcinogens. sort thing.

But, things pandemic. get cancer long term exposure Asbestos, can't spread coworker. exponentially bigger problem insurers. Exactly, put down. He'll focused sucking chest wound killing. Also, NHL Canada See bullshit, pay people stay home avoid virus, shut good portion economy. better (far far) worst open. Get job, least attempt it. 

If decide actually going force people stay home, that's pay people stay home. 

A movie theater employee make 45k risk, Walmart employees make 25k risk every day. would awesome, could completely normal next summer, school year 2021-2022 academic year. question elect leader already developed semblance empathy ***before*** take office? suggesting Dr. Fauci Dr. Topol ""celebrity"" doctors like Dr. Oz, that's highly reductive, [suggesting Fauci recommended wearing 

This leaning towards Republican talking points trying put blame everyone else people actively spread anti-mask propaganda. Say shit HR people wearing masks. WalMart. Yup, replacement room. least yet

People working home would literally get mad unplanned meetings would happen naturally left convo. talking something walk hall make sense either NSC staff worked also learned news. don’t think payed attention CCW class. Thank you, guys rule! exact opposite, fact. care enough around want chance infecting them. Including Republican psychopaths give damn anyone themselves. likely, think, lot people next couple years going find like private equity full time lawyers lobbyists landlord. Hahah never Good luck herding cats. Developers interchangeable parts. dump experienced people team bargain-basement developers India, pay steep price.

And managers know probably already outsourced development work suffered consequences, WFH going make difference there. south backward fuck though. people elect literally sacrificing them, half still support them. were. Unfortunately lot countries around world pretending would disappear April reason. ringing alarm bells early loudly. Complacency set lot people want believe them. Yeah citizens would suddenly realize there’s virus immediately comply, everyone lives happily ever peace harmony. Lmao. Half country would revolt lose shit, even people would opposite gov asks, create one crisis top crisis. True story much want link read that. sounds insane...

Ninja Edit: I'll Google search myself. gave enough bread crumbs. Ironic Fauci Nationals game sitting next 2 people without mask mask nose repeat again: Puerto Rican American citizenship. see, definitely denied American citizenship. 


Something seems confusing you, another poster pointed already, difference nationality citizenship. Yes, sometimes overlap nation-state, [stateless (i.e. Puerto Rico).

Maybe make clearer: nationality Puerto Rican, even though American citizenship. can’t go wrong add enough good guys guns. See, good guys don’t psychotic breaks bad days. /s excuse works ask extra money goes. 

What I'm worth company change based live, based I'm worth. going cut pay cost living adjustment separate compensation salary cost living adjustment. company stupid think deep. rehire people one regular mean videos simply reporting numbers.

The link **.au**

And article said:

Historian Mary Sheehan, researching Spanish flu **Victoria** doctorate, said **Australia's** modern health welfare systems would ""totally foreign"" forebears century earlier. even know race suspects since didnt' read article. meant people trashy people. Well, much source clip. ridiculous defeatist attitude. nation perfectly capable handling epidemic. handled many before. failed time administration dismantled pandemic response team, ignored previous administration's pandemic playbook. 

The failure administration due ignoring successes previous administrations, formulated working pandemic plans years, successfully handled many diseases.

All happening predictable predicted. Face reality. failure leadership, failure patriotism among people blindly follow ignorance. employers can't use IQ tests.

Employers can't use IQ tests directly get result indirectly selecting based college (which uses pseudo-IQ test SAT sort prospective students). Nobody actually thinks students learn different material University Michigan West Virginia University. I'm still holding hope finishing trials mid- late september, approval/distribution october. even makes Nazi flags days? mean wtf! lovely human beings.! doubt servers actually there.

Server farms literally take acres acres space; barely need people actually run.

I'm really sure reason this, think widespread fear permanent WFH results worse collaboration communication. generally way permanent remote get hired way specific job roles (like OSS contributor group ironically hired time left work city wanted move to).

We're bleeding out. People dying. *need* shutdown get levels, work there. perfect solution variety reasons we're nowhere near right now.

Yes! able work home month April. May 1 back way cases back then. 100% job house. thing boss can't drop make sure I'm sleeping, guess. Last week brought us working home said something like, ""we it, great"". work second office see people main office, ever. boss comes month, maybe. two people (neither wear masks) get 3 walk customers week (who also wear masks). customers walk nearly always older people looking chat maybe one person month pay invoice.

So am. least knows can't take comfortable naps lunch breaks anymore! (For real, though, tired getting punch lunch walk 3 feet nice comfy bed greatest thing whole world.) Factual right. source svt. contact news archive. started teleworking 2014. gave security clearance stopped flying job site daily great. much loved job hated commuter flights every day.

However pandemic way businesses things set people well telework. Admittedly took year office needed productive, and, switch routine actually good productivity. 

So love it, I've talked feel like can't get things done office. miss routine, people, miss able get away home, feel can't properly separate home life work life (which mandatory matter are).

I think salaries take hit. Companies (I hope) reimburse work home office supplies quite expensive properly outfit office mimics would outside home. I’ll able buy house $1200?

We need stay home much possible 'I seen Barron Tiffany months, kids great isolating themselves' -Trump  betting foregone conclusion imo articulated published document anywhere? ""protestors"" wanting things way presenting unified front? bit confusing. 


Also, still heard /u/PinkPropaganda one actually advocating others take active resistance. problem programs instead schools using help kids get skinnier, excuses spend less money food. really drove people programs general. poorly thought real enforcement. responses asenine comment removed political comment remains? Theres concerted effort discredit international bodies using words like dreaded c-word probably preserve tax havens stay safe. couldn’t bear knowing that. I’m 28 good physical health. I’d likely fine. can’t risk chance pass without knowing, since may ever symptoms. Hell, could already it. Kinda wish would could quarantine get worry much. Besides whole long term problems - I’m convinced directly related much virus exposed probably right. I'll bet another one Hilary supporters red ball cap go apeshit wear mask run car get loaded weapon murder people with.  Right. Montana going anywhere near many cops place 83 times population. far less, far spread out. articulated point nicely. Thank you.

Countries asked override preservation instincts. one benefits except international business interests. work relatively large tech company. gone 100% WFH eliminating offices worldwide. Oh gotcha, realize comment sarcasm. People thread legitimately believe bar patrons armed stopped people dying. plan, playbook, supplies, that.

Trump ignored playbook briefing 2017, tossed team 2018, take steps replenish supplies expire time. It’s still fall I’m ok with. anyone asks yes I’ll absolutely take one it’s available. I’m done stuck inside. want normalcy back soon possible. think bubble realistically possible MLB regular season. would mean players teams would stay within bubble single location entire season. one going agree that. bubble works NBA/NHL they're playing playoffs bubble, maybe like month so? That's doable. Chainsmokers still around? I’m lost response this.

To quote Office Space ""Strychnine guacamole"". keep comparing NHL/NBA MLB

Because that's person replied did. tried compare say bubble working cases MLB different. cases, too. teams started playing interacting things started get bad say NBA NHL better even started? Let's wait players different teams breathing sweating claim bubble works. disagreement me. I’m working within system have, unable change it. druthers, things would much different.  mean people try. least see similar cases getting thrown out. many lawsuits going make Trump U look like BBB. Neither we, much larger threshold disastrous results   extension bonus UI benefits? Thats super American sentance applaud naturalness kind enjoys trolling people. people? wow... breathlessness difficulty breathing something always associated middle-aged &amp; older patients. getting fevers headaches &amp; body aches &amp; coughing started trouble breathing? Oh man. grandparents living. hope stay home. It’s hard say since spikes, like Japan Hong Kong, happened recently. understand large US population is. lesser spike smaller country could still actually bad, per capita. time tell. prove today though eradication practically impossible, 99 times 100 virus comes back (it even made way North Korea ffs. right tell lockdowns don’t work). need look sustainable methods mitigation covid? second part exactly wondering. Yeah help today, would least fair. money, need now! something common 1000 people died last six days. don’t live Texas anymore either. 


Did point? Trump: ‘The Wuhan computer virus dangerous, dangerous. We’ve tried UV, we’ve tried Clorox, nothing works. Wear mask people’ mean... probably yeah, given tax deadline July 15th. everyone filed already anyway. Racists explaining racists racist things funniest shit ever one suddenly remembering ""blowing bubbles"" jokes ? home owners also generally voted allowing new development time can, interest keeping supply low / demand high. nation's leading expert infectious diseases member White House's coronavirus task force says pandemic could kill 100,000 200,000 Americans infect millions. 

 

The death toll totally line predictions March... important note unionized. Without union, probably would fired already. Apparently care life likely mean care either. ER guarantee unless get know like.. Sounds like need divorce. Find woman cares life money/pleasure Promptly stopped 77 years age?  asked would provide straight apology women inappropriate with, said *wasn't sorry anything ever done*. That's psychopathic he's clearly closer dead apologetic. rampant video evidence touch-feely behavior - children less - he'd likely inappropriately touching someone soon let basement. 

Roy Moore likely guilty alleged him, reason believe otherwise. found guilty charges filed. while, denounced major conservative leaders elected one reddest areas country. Meanwhile, Biden leading nearly every poll constituents ho-hum sexual assault stuff. 

It's painfully ironic trying claim false equivalency ignoring one blatant. think I’m defending America something? history major college. I’m aware shitty America rest world. government shit.

I know politicians dogshit too. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez seems like literally one trying incite major change. rest start rhetoric fall party line career.

Politicians evil bastards too. It’s actually fault letting police get like this.

I understand politician much unless they’re dictator don’t stop talking let happen. Well haven’t left first wave COVID yeh together either support free speech, even assholes, free speech. can’t pick choose speech offensive.

That said, fully support couple filming, called bullshit. deserve ridiculed verbally accosted. deserve images posted publicly, everyone knows beliefs, hope employers decide want assholes working them. Wal-Mart chose ban couple, I'm also totally board with.

But draw line people calling arrested. day make *illegal* display stupid beliefs day go hiding, lot dangerous. would great assholes made easy identify. It’s kind running joke Europe UK Europe’s America. Well need infections like 6 months see long immunity lasts boosters needed.

So vaccine nov, April would earliest could determine long lasts. several moreonths innoculations. Good idea. going huge blow smaller companies. counting ever going back normal? Tf? countries fine brother law Google financial department admin losing mind. people really like going office. discussing family group chat he's devastated hear news. cop drop dead apple thrown them?
you let know.

cops usually propagate shit own. work tech company HQed Bay Area we're already seeing employees expressing interest moving lower cost living areas. moved Bay Area job work home there's nothing keeping crazy expensive area. HR currently rushing formulate plan deal tell people leave Bay Area going get keep Bay Area inflated salary. *”History suggests pandemic run amok cause death knells nation-states, lose total legitimacy they're unable protect citizenry”*

I’d say US well way here. real financial “shoe” yet drop. US definitely essentially 3rd world country. certainly systematic issues, equate 3rd world country ignorant, someone actually familiar like living 3rd world countries. US undeniably 1st world country, even well-off ahead 1st world countries. 

* US, people literally die streets everyone see.
* landmines children might step walking school, worry blown up.
* Political dissidents randomly 'disappear' families randomly 'disappear'.
* Citizens really worry walking neighborhood wearing wrong type clothing getting killed cartels part of. Yes African American BIPOC disproportinately victims violence corrupt policing US, bad compared many areas Latin America, example.
* Phone lines work.
* Electricity nation-wide randomly cut out.
* Amputees crawl remain bedridden life.
* Access reproductive care available, including condoms.
* People taught condoms work, 5-10 children way prevent so. 
* Abortion legal safe, even sometimes difficult stigmatized.
* Police stop people threaten steal harm unless pay bribe.
* Mental health institutions high quality, US actually values talks mental health much cultures international economies (just US Nordic country make worst, anywhere close to, 3rd world countries).
* huge portion population living shantytown shacks made tin wire bricks cardboard.
* Fire codes exist.
* Labor laws exist.
* Truancy laws exist protect children keep school kids get sent work day.
* Famine huge issue.
* US' wars last 100 years foreign soil, US citizens live fear bombed another invader country.
* Children free public schools. 
* Children access technology. 
* Government censorship low compared many countries. 

Being worse Nordic European countries *not* make US anywhere close 3rd world country, equating two really lot harm 3rd world countries, people living US 1st world countries forget huge issues 3rd world countries. ignorant. know trying say US lot problems, please romanticize issues 3rd world countries claim US one.  leading death America 2020 isn’t COVID. It’s stupid people stupid things. Well done America! don’t

Source: America projections back way higher this. think Microsoft can't added unless Apple would removed, unless they're dominating another market. Wait, fired? PR move. bet manager request wage makes sure makes missing hours. least should. logic, school child abuse. 

Not disagreeing conclusion, that’s poorly written law. theory may sound good you, practice drunkenly created dangerous environment. Great Rona Migration 2020. Yes that. got sleep mornings saved 40 minutes way driving (as well gas money!). also way productive work felt super guilty anything work related working. pooped clock well! dog happier, too!

You hit nail head, though. I've always reminded quote (from Simpsons, believe?), ""We've tried nothing we're ideas!"" many countries able go almost completely back normal now, well, guess too, without hundreds/ thousands deaths day. amazingly self centered viewpoint deniers have. become important **they're** infected. shooter large tf going say race known Fuck Kudlow. Fuck Mnuchin. Fuck Trump GOP Meanwhile I'm back office job TOTALLY FUCKING HOME (I two best months home) we're ""work office"" company. Fucking slime bags. spend yours? Atleast corrected someone clearly wrong, ranting... Seems like it. European sports make sense they’ve handled much better Americans. MLS two teams positives literally kicked competition. NBA still wait see phase. NHL look like geniuses going Canada. One biggest stores country, one shops there? Frank, meant viral video. everyone thinks computer virus. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Paywalled. Title could click bait. would know? Yeah 85 year old grandpa probably sharing videos Facebook hoax refuses wear mask 🤷‍♂️ Many, many unintended consequences, I’d say. It’s waterfall poop stage. sheepskin end Harvards name it. That's fair point.

I've curbside restaurants like crazy. actually kinda nice everywhere requires order ahead + pickup now, instead walking in, ordering, waiting. :) modern excuse always ""I pretending/joking"". 

They [pretend](http://chainsawsuit.com/comic/2017/05/18/its-very-subtle/) normalized stop pretending. Pretending also attracts actual believers, great recruiting. See: 4chan, reddit. shoot bar full capacity take 3 people come right.... Rumor going around twitter passed away. Sorry problems, wish well.

I nothing virus, wish went away tomorrow much anyone. reality is. saying gonna another year two someone else saying gonna end month change what's really gonna happen. part wearing mask, social distancing, keeping kids home school, I'm eating away retirement savings can't work. yahoos go around pretending like exist making even worse yet. interview success rate lower google cost anything apply google send resume, whereas applying harvard costs couple hundred? make giant application (oh also apply harvard 18 years old) kidding? ABSOLUTELY group business-class thinks COVID stupid go office wash hands going bathroom. people are, quite literally, worst. Two years careful husband stays alive worth me. Don’t get wrong I’m economic hit cities. 

If there’s many people cities office/tech jobs isn’t much need service workers like janitors, baristas, cafe waitresses, trash collectors, street sweepers, HVAC, maintenance guys, heck there’s huge percentage people going city every day even less car accidents less need first responders. 

Overall it’ll good thing adjustment period local city economies may already thanks covid

I heard someone say Covid pushed us easily 10 years future far technology goes working home Zoom. would told 15 years ago Zoom face face doctor house get prescription would thought crazy Yeah makes can't talk anything. That's part story. People buy neighborhoods like lifestyle neighborhood. raze 10 family homes build 100-unit high rise condo spot rapidly see change lifestyle.  increase population density also makes attractive retail start moving in. Traffic goes moderate high, roads get widened houses either get razed lose yards make way road. solution put leave home remove 'til get home. Exeption lunch work, remove I'm far enough building putting go back. make habit masking leaving home spares car pretty much non issue. Dengue fever flu. Fucking great See that's two minute break since close person 15 minutes break. split obviously kids safe. Good thing mouth breathers. 120 days fully recover. got time that?

My cousin got it. That's long took stop feeling like shit. includes 2 weeks hospital high pressure O2 O2 sat collapsed suddenly. Place bets.

I've got 1000 internet points saying 20k dead December end sight. making masks family friends deliberately avoid using eleastic ear loops it’s easy pull nose chin. constantly readjusting you’re mask, doesn’t fit. difference would 20.000 tests done? fair criticism would wasn’t scaled faster hasn’t reached 100.000. company going permanent work home coming meetings needed track things tax write-offs Nice know could one vaccine candidate end year. Well recommend it, would suggest people year. ""experts"" Dave Ramsey suggest 3-6 months. Suze Ormond says 9 months. Nerd wallet vanguard say 3-6 months. personally think Dave Suze hacks, although Dave's method work. 

I think say need 9 months year emergency fund, disincentivizes people save. big hill climb. 

Also, emergency funds really designed pandemics. Even 2008 meltdown, could still get shitty job. Nowadays, much. 

I tend agree though, people would better saved cushion, especially upper 10-15% incomes. Was? Venn diagram two groups circle. Honestly don’t think would allowed. “responsible” gun owners returned fire would drinking considered responsible book. already get paid driving / commuting work. That's really even *'personal time'*, time wasted getting ready work someone else.

Also keep mind, completely home, next step **outsourcing city/state labor costs even lower!**

Why heck would accept even less already do.

We screwed. momma says science devil real dumb ass shit. point report includes deaths week back great. break reported deaths day death occurring, great. try imply last days seen lower number reported deaths occurred days deaths rapidly dropping.

Can see problem here? takes days report deaths occurred, probably deaths occurred past days reported later! called censoring statistics anyone competent honest account it.  perspective, client pay travel expenses humble brag itself. matter cost, business, air travel hotels paid humble brag. 

Good though, whatever business in, worked way earn luxuries. Looks lovely! FOMO. That's they're there. 

Closed stores there's deal hunters packing them. might want either, feel order afford things want buy. Europe’s economy nowhere close fully operational right now. better job coronavirus did, “Europe good USA bad” isn’t accurate reflection occurred Also goes apologetics bad hey Florida's numbers yet high NY....

Maybe, maybe, media induced 'panic' keeping people home thus preventing number hopefully going higher? Maybe bit panic good thing right now? Yeah, normal people spectrum use hobbies way socialize. Even then, really. need make illegal home isn’t use. twice many peopleless homes homeless people. Yet get banned five years shoplifting. don’t see that’s business 

*scans bottle lube quickly self-checkout* wow distinct reason 14 days average incubation period 2-14 days, that's known months now. 

From CDC's Covid onset duration viral shedding period infectiousness COVID-19 yet known certainty. Based current evidence, scientists believe persons mild moderate COVID-19 may shed replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 10 days following symptom onset, small fraction persons severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised persons, may shed replication-competent virus 20 days. possible SARS-CoV-2 RNA may detectable upper lower respiratory tract weeks illness onset, similar infections MERS-CoV SARS-CoV. However, detection viral RNA necessarily mean infectious virus present. Based existing literature, incubation period (the time exposure development symptoms) SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (e.g., MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges 2–14 days.


What *has* changed study referenced CDC stating [most mild-to-moderate cases infectious 10 days following symptom new data released incubation period afaik, tbh reason sound reasonable me. research judge actually born, raised, went school Florida. would think someone sensible born elsewhere moved FL. 30k per month average. 1k per day average flu vaccine relative ineffective strain changes frequently guess strains circulation *next* flu season making vaccine. Covid much easier nail down. protect what's point even trying?"" That's scare-inducing part.

But factually correct. could take 0 precautions never get virus take precautions still get it. facts, opinions personal interpretations.

Suppressing facts order one's narrative morally wrong. article could included statistics tho. meant one guns *in particular story* would danger. points pedantic. Sounds like god fearing Christian man live area one wearing masks... do? open fire? lazy person. follow politics, understand it. like *idea* informed person, put work become informed. pathetic. I'd probably bubble division separately, four teams every location. need one field mini-bubble, game Saturday game Sunday. triple round robin (so 9 game season). Winner division goes 8-team playoffs, bubble.

There's ways make something work, definitely requires dramatic changes. Well, yes. figured part it. Isn’t one main reasons Silicon Valley salary high? housing costs? reasonable astute judge Florida! No, emotionally charged lawsuits aren’t exactly cheap defend either. Florida requires 14 day quarantine coming certain states. Check rules. read whole thing see basic idea shame someone get cooperation. That's came simplest politest thing would think of: ""would mind pulling mask please"".  sort leaves open possibility may forgotten. hand say something like ""covering nose required stop spread"" would perceived trying ""teach"" something annoying (as smarter them). way see American football working go flag football otherwise single worst sport spreading. Or... best. best spreading. top other. QB shouts play feet away everyone line. linemen within inches every breathing heavy, talking shit other, shouting formation changes. Med School? Good work, r/Chunkly. reddit helps folk hard times. Don’t forget; Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia well many Bahama island banned/restrict US tourists. Puerto Rico one places left go  Ok, much cost? CEO told CTO cut costs 10%. go back running recovering? Expect go fund soon Lol what?!?!? even remotely thing? Wow – even important – good training staff aggressive isolation quarantine. Plot twist: They're card carrying dems make Trump look bad. bad, bad dems. Horrible dems. worst kind people.

I know them. personally, personally. One great. came rallies could point one crowds. dem friend. others? worst. That's best plan doubt, country would never that. stimulus got, need spend it. Saying spend stimulus let local businesses die want rent mortgage freeze selfish. definitely sit right people working making people going risking safety make less money. Compared billions going rich people corporations little oversight, $600/week thing seems like even fraction scandal.

The answer punish getting $600, compensate people currently working similar living wage. published study heart damage virus.

If you’re professional athlete , can’t afford lung damage heart damage. You’ve basically described America, boiled essence. Yeah, least that’s understanding hospital work at. Also work per diem skilled nursing facilities well, patients sent SNF hospital die there, add SNF death toll. Gimme 50k I’ll hand-deliver one today Yeah, good. Hopefully population accustomed right behavior get things control again. ""wanted""...he backed ago. ""We constitutional protected right infect others""

Great quote. u/Tychonaut miserable covid truther trump booster, they’ll never see reason knew 100-200k atleast would die. much obvious looking charts.



We 5+mil die world wide over. US still phase 1. rest world ex Brazil India Russia starting phase two within next weeks. training results 100% compliance safety. simply exist people make mistakes. intent training reduce mistakes. We're ""back phase 1"", stepped back subset reopened businesses based combination new science rising cases. father pretty much seems like he's lost ability understand complicated ideas money like this.

It's like trying explain pays insurance would pay taxes national health care system. looks insurance goes ""well pay $380 month that, national healthcare system would raise taxes! cost billions! I'll pay poor people! must cost more!""

I also tried explaining would prevent damage long run purposely locking earlier, explained great detail straight rejected it.

I directly show countries economic data today sink in. think year gonna kill Black Friday. We’re going see evolution boomer holiday longer include typical crowded stores huge lines. retailers already operating set max capacity is, I’m certain won’t change come November cases even worse. predict us shifting larger cyber weekend instead, web-exclusive “doorbusters” typically expected in-store thanksgiving/Black Friday. Non-essential retail centers still busy days thanksgiving, I’m predicting online order fulfillment curbside brick mortar locations. gotta say, none makes mad. Black Friday garbage day truly encapsulates culture capitalism USA America problems, hope anybody says 3rd world country forced spend year real 3rd world country. Reddit fuckin annoying hyperbole surrounding america tough set

Your allowed planet fitness I'm going lie mate got 5 bullet points list &amp; one applied USA stopped reading.

The USA third world country. They’re probably going call people attending John Lewis’ funeral “morons” deserve die, btw. God writing article titles sub?

97% wildly out-of-context clickbait complete hearsay.

try keep science science, sans tabloid headlines. Florida Man must getting wiser age. gave birth 17’ $780 per OTC Tylenol hospital charged insurance. $75 bandaid even sounds cheap. forgot supply chain that.

Someone working overtime make CS gas producing go. Right oxford like 40 million doses ready producing day. Oxford says think get September mean out. Like everyone. Maybe 7 billion us. it’ll go places need right away happens hopefully solve covid problem good. 

This assuming works though. otherwise useless. source svt. Agreed, prestige network becoming less less valuable. Companies (lead big tech) really streamlining interviewing process, point multiple companies I’ve interviewed/worked feature automated first round interviews (like code submissions, automated CV processing, etc). agree great connect might really help find job quicker someone equal skills, lack network isn’t limiting may been. Oh, totally. Personal responsibility important, societies cultivate obesity much others. lifestyles heavily shaped live, going norm difficult. happen eventually. pandemic lasts forever. yes, think long haul, major restrictions place probably rest year restrictions place indeterminate time that. keep hearing people around talk like need hold ""a couple months"" I'm like, that's reality we're living in, unfortunately. lease ends August (my 30 days notice due tomorrow). I'm stoked told today get move bay year save ton money. Maybe every time try become informed every person talk yells bad side aisle lists thousand reasons hate rather explaining party Yes Also assumes space something like that. idea people like students citydwellers small apartments recreate anything even remotely close gym dwelling absurd. double sigmoid multiple peaks. still natural asymptote. Well unfortunately must come true they’re longer enforcing policy prevent violence employees. part brain believes someone who’s willing attack another person wearing mask locked life. Society place types “people”, genuinely think longer deserve rights im alright taking risk im part staying home. WFH do... feel mental fog sense lethargy

Are sure covid?? o.O Even Walmart wants nothing you.

...for year. sure votes. Party may outdoors wide open spaces easy social distancing, masks required, etc. Plus replying story 700 people, admitting concerned invite 15. retailers talking Thanksgiving, next day? one literally crowded shopping day year? would see hospitalization death counts. Part anti lock narrative long causing hospitalization increase really matter many people infected. information make concern less,

Heh, actually make one *more* concerned, means deaths result period past cases/hospitalizations lower, means expect even deaths happening right higher cases/hospitalizations get reported later.

Of really bad denialist talking points one even absurd usual. fact US testing rate gone significantly last couple days? looking data testing slowing down, might see escalation cases even higher 1-2 weeks, people see falling numbers virus serious anymore, looking number reported cases day.

&amp;#x200B;

If span week cut daily testing numbers HALF, long term effects could completely catastrophic. People would even convinced virus deadlier flu, reject scientists advisement masks physical distancing even more!

&amp;#x200B;

This would drive even cases cycle repeats again, people slowly realize seem many people alive neighborhood, streets, anywhere anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: forgot mention data, past 48 hours, US went testing 867,325 24 hour period, testing 308,395. Furthermore, seems 3million test discrepancy   can't figure myself. Total deaths three countries last week: 500 (most UK) declining, US: 5000 etc

159 countries 200 lower mortality rate. US mortality rate 5 times world average want move beautiful Bay Area. Seriously. worked outside week last week temp never broke 82. Went boated around lake berryessa Saturday Sunday rode bike across GG. parents back Midwest still dealing shortages like 7 grocery stores within couple miles house. company goes back aug 5th it’s mandatory. prefer office honestly I’m substantially better job WFH. 2 hours day riding Bart fucking kills humanity disposal makes pleasant human. Rent dropping SF houses east bay market like 5 days prices aren’t showing much softening. seems like people want Bay. SF.  Panic seems like thing works getting people wear masks &amp; socially distance. problem panic; finely honed survival mechanism evolved good reason. west LA... Much like people prolonging current crisis. Every day I'm thankful I'm Canadian. Oh imaginable, people enormous Type 2 error going serious pandemic. Even though event unlikely.

The last two US administrations problem imagining severe pandemic would do. scared heck them. wanna work Google, man. One day, one day Way ahead you. thing minimum wage stans seem understand companies operating costs can't magically pay people money nowhere. artificially raise cost labor company react - usually cut jobs. maybe able hire 100 people $10/hour - that's $1000/hour operating costs. pay $15/hour, still $1000/hour pay, they're going get rid like 33 people pay remaining people $15/hour probably also expecting make fact 1/3 less people helping work now. exactly higher pay help people lost jobs? That's something NEVER heard minimum wage supporter explain: higher minimum wage helps someone makes $0/hour (doesn't have/loses job).

But know ""magically"" pay people want to? government. see right - give everyone country $1200 nowhere. Raise debt ceiling, issue bonds, raise taxes, change interest rates, print extra money even - government KINDS ways adjust ""operating costs"" businesses don't. 

So trying pass buck businesses solve problem government handling? minimum wage all, universal basic income everyone instead.

And would give employees REAL bargaining power - fact work. Want offer shit salary bad job? thanks, I'll live UBI look better offer. want run company, like McDonalds, actually stay business, entice people work you, instead relying fact lots people NEED shitty job get by. Exactly, that, many people may essentially immune without ever infected - lot people seem understand this.

Just admit know something, keep fucking mouth shut, narcissist. confederacy lasted 5... recent response “we’re much larger country.” I’ve also seen “other countries aren’t testing much and/or fudging numbers.” seems like, article, police contacted homeowner, homeowner knew rented party. bigger companies like Facebook already informed employees keeping Bay Area salary move.

There's estimated 300,000 400,000 guns USA,. yearly average 40,000 gun deaths. means 10% guns ever even used homicides. ""Guns majority problem.""

Financial literacy doesn’t exclude spending, low income does. 

I believe primary intent benefit cheap labor, financial independence would allow workers ability negotiate compensation fairly. 

Currently, business benefits paying workers extremely little, workers cannot save either due lack sufficient income, lack financial literacy, lack ability due chronic insecurity, combination ""got"" virus.

* phase 3 trials test see product says does. case COVID vaccine, prevent catching, transmitting, getting sick exposure COVID-19 virus.

I suspect they're actually going make someone inhale puffer full virus, rather test COVID-19 infection rate across two populations, one injection one without... number people catch COVID-19 population significantly lower (hopefully zero) placebo group catches rate mirroring general population say vaccine effectively prevents infection.

What means *if passes trial* essentially *IS* vaccine.

In *period time* would able get shot would high degree confidence protect covid.... eventually go outside again.

I'm sure long trial would run - 1 month? 6 months?

Anyways - long story short - successful phase 3 trial would likely mean beginning end COVID isolation.

There's lot nuance *that* well. Politics, anti-vaxxers, pricing patents, manufacturing delays logistics distribution... would potentially spell end covid era.

Edit - important note I've read companies (I think oxford trial example) actually full-scale manufacturing vaccine phase 3 trial. *if* pass they'd close billion doses ready go day one. pass basically dump start again. think ROI even get $1 per dose they'd still track sell billion dollars investment million manufacture doses smart gamble them.

I live city full large tech companies, many shut offices plan keep closed rest year. Formally busy areas ghost towns business hours. many restaurants relied tech workers going lunch executives sales people taking clients expensive, alcohol-filled meals. none happening.

We also several large universities colleges brought tens thousands students city every year quite businesses exist serve students. students staying home cities can’t see businesses survive. Even landlords rent student housing going hard time - it’s like lot non-students eager rent bedroom sketchy ten bedroom house even nice apartment building filled students. put /s large part blame definitely internet. internet, scattered idiots could maybe convince friend two bullshit, idiots across globe collaborate little effort. prescribed Test, could say steroids... went planet fitness $20 massage tables, not? maxed weight machines lunker alarm pressed 2x ""looked serious"" still went helped stuff going personally...........

Kidding, statement appears Humans, specifically, 99.9% similar Chimps 96% similar humans. means chimps 400 times different other.

No... quite. viral genome concise, actively expressed important, whereas humans something like 2% known importance, much overlap overlap noise.

Turns kids straight didn’t work. heart goes workplaces mindset. I’m still angry months later it’s completely devaluing. say interesting see pans out. Yeah. Thats basicly read. thought maybe missed something also english good. informations also find interesting mostly numbers... examples like beginning worked... Exactly.

It's almost sunken cost fallacy point, would've sold back March saved loan payments would added nice payment *do* go back. Now, though, ""may well hang onto know sure."" Incoming Sweden nationalists zero grip reality hard numbers Except infectious diseases.

So mean “when present risk people, don’t care”. really should. Kind funny (and I'm kind idiot), saw story related pieces Walmart Dick's Sporting Goods thing year, thought nice hectic times employers giving people break holiday. even cross mind (at first) clearly CYA Covid-19. Somewhat restored faith humanity unrestored again. Democrats hold banning modern firearms, making rest expensive hard get possible, platform goals. awareness reality ""gun control"" trying strip us rights. rational reaction irrational attack civil rights. Google math China let independent credible scientists conduct independent investigation, I'll believe. credibility prime suspect. Ugh, horrible. went YMCA would absolutely died anyone made sort attention working out. alarm, though!? really awful. Also getting fat fridge 10 feet away times.

WFH better sort strict ""on call"" status extends whole work day. gap responsibilities, go run, lift weights, etc. hour gap enough run 3 miles, shower, eat one go.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, fridge close net benefit too. I've found several options easy prepare, nutritious, filling, instead junk I'd often eat lunch hour work.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost 30 lbs since COVID-19 even putting little muscle mass. believe things right working great companies everyone remote channels communication kept same. think things start break apart little people office. Conversations start remote people involved. probably come ways fix this. 

I think large population doesn’t want work remotely, either shitty space space work home. also kills socialization lot people. 

I think show it’s actually ok work remotely companies super forced acknowledge it’s ok employees make choice, can’t probably companies let make choice. really though? (1) eradicate virus, (2) reach immunity vaccin, (3) reach immunity, maybe, infecting enough people, (4) develop treatments makes disease serious. 1 possible world whole. 2-4 drastically different consequences. 2-3. same. Unbelievable, yet somehow believe it. Ugh. understand people reticent wearing masks gym, one place actually need able breathe without obstructions. People wear masks training specifically make harder breathe whilst exercising train body work less oxygen going muscles. 8ts difficult everybody.
Would probably make big difference cardio machines though unless unfit. 

Regardless, viral contagion currently big issue feel masks need worn whilst exercising, clearly is, gyms really closed. definition non essential. People got bored. Masks spring 2020. long ago sub worried would happen Florida also found it. Thank you! article, sounds like Target planning something like this. Damn, O's pace pennant... Ah, see. Makes sense. know Justice wanting retract it!

But that's still interesting kind opens worms. *believe* saying, still say intentionally speaking falsely...? I.E., ""masks work, wear them?"" one claim belief sincerely held (whether not), therefore they're making false claims?

IDK I'm rambling about, sorry. enough sleep. Spanish Flu pandemic lasted approximately two years, guess they're basing assumption of. things could mitigated (or least smoothed out) [a dedicated pandemic response started taking action 2-3 weeks earlier soon cases started appearing outside originated China.  Mostly result candidates pushing platform forward kicking screaming. [His anything progressive. *ironic* Yes driving &amp; flu-shots leaky efficacy (e.g. flu shot still \~50% chance get it, pass others). failed acknowledge dodged core call.  


How personally justify driving, going around street, when, ""probabilistically-averaged"", kill fraction people things? following recommendations justify putting others risk, correct? much probable-life comfortable take conveniences? 


I'm looking rationalizations make head; that. I'm asking you: probability, scenarios, kill someone, comfortable with? 


I personally know answer this. that's also go around asking kinds questions. disease causes blood oxygen levels drop sharply several days weeks may cause long term cognitive issues. obvious face one seems considered seriously. I'm sorry, employees able defend someone ramming them. two individuals cops, company. golf good though three kids money?

Have tried kids three money?  Interesting, I've heard estimates 20-25% range (which supposedly line historical data Italy Spain).

A lot assumptions assume *actual* cases something like 8-10x *confirmed* cases, think Florida Arizona crossed threshold week ago more. Well, since claim, provide sources, link Reddit comment even going click that. Show real sources might convince Eh, serious enough side effects wouldn’t pushed quickly. worst, would likely effective waste money absolutely correct. However, sometimes education falls deaf ears. told mother-in-law, type two diabetic, years diet unhealthy. never learned. Even gave specific examples helped learn count calories carbohydrates. didn’t matter. It’s like addiction. People ready willing change. think it’s long process. That's ask people wear fucking mask Jokes aside, famous place go food slogan menu ""The real reason here!"" addition that, Lou Williams lemon pepper wet wings named menu.

Granted, even going food, terrible optics disciplined same. less face time network co-workers

That's main worry, even cohesiveness issue. team worked together least one full year prior (or us) current WFH already seem worse acting team. particular, newest guy seems bunch issue since, perfectly fine office.

Other that, WFH fantastic me. Horrible thing happen young man. explain valve mask bullshit please?

I use [one wrong use?

Thanks read carefully see literally “Right” affected wearing mask. I've read reddit Anytime Fitness fight lose. ITT: people work home talking much money save people work home telling much money lose odds are: - 100% infect others around stupidity 

Where odds coming from? 100% people transmit disease least 1 person, invariably contract it. transmission rate varies considerably person person depends interact with. know literally nothing people data saying 100% infect people 100% end hospitalized

there's bullshit! 99%+ people contract COVID hospitalized. 100% sure someone going hospitalized coming contact 40 people? There's literally evidence current dead rate Corona US 3.4%. 

LOL. can't possibly believe that's true, right? comparing CONFIRMED cases (and confirmed cases) confirmed probable deaths. There's problem number one. let's forget experts estimate (based water tests serology) around 10 times many people infected. means we're looking .34% IFR. But, even still, 40% deaths came nursing homes hospices. account anyone outside nursing home (or anyone 70, go broader), looking IFR rates .1. treat morons? God good enough them?

They likely need treatment. But, deny treatment motorcyclists? That's risk far greater .1%. automobile accidents? People walk lower risk. Sports accidents? That's assumed risk. 

We treat people engage risk taking goddamn time. body choice. nothing conspiracy right now. insinuating federal government gaming numbers without evidence all! funny think Maryland's rise cases south. OC Maryland filled oout-of-state license plates PA, NJ NY. shit coming Rehoboth. friend owns triplex, lives one units husband, rent 2 units. tenants 2 units lost jobs capable paying rent, decided pay rent right now, NOTHING it. eviction moratoriums work many people wish would put rules around it. Marlins playing long game. Jeter mad genius. Get whole team infected once, get sympathy games postponed since enough back-ups available, head September team full antibodies, watch opponents drop like flies. recommend taking gap year can. college paid choice unlike k 12 Even countries strict lockdowns cases spike again, maybe problem lockdowns really good sustainable solution? Sleeper trains private cabins usually windows open. probably quite bit safer Sadly need weeks judge state obvious. wish could get good data still layed might actually still good. imagine lot servers situation, long going let someone unemployed without requiring look work? NBA shutdown 1 person one night. No, progun argument fall apart. Safety ancillary right individual self defense right people armed.

I wonder take antidote get bit snake? 

Or yknow take rabies vaccine get bit? Naa, better die rabies accept vaccination. Bill Gates, microchips, such.  Probably study Facebook University School Medicine. 50% massive exaggeration. gotta remember people loud make seem like bigger group are. Wtf op doin comments LOL Lots things considered public health attract negative attention. Smoking bans, seat belt mandates, drug rehabilitation programs, harm reduction programs, expanded medical care, even things like poverty assistance programs considered parts public health. Unfortunately lot money goes trying convince people public health programs suck shouldnt exist. Sweden testing groups priorities end May - meant health care staff people severe symptoms. sure, previous confirmed cases reflect true infection burden country. Sweden's ICU deaths peaked Mid-April going down. Since start June started testing also people mild symptoms Stockholm region - people symptoms too. say last month half tests confirmed cases closer reality is. However, limit certain groups wasn't, people sick weeks prior June also went get tested. ""backlog"" over, newly infected suspected cases would likely come tested - explain also drop confirmed cases. However throughout entire duration up-and-down behavior confirmed cases curve, curve ICU hospitalizations deaths confirmed severe cases going without change. would mean wave new infections correspond wave confirmed cases, rather end tail distribution. 

Now comparing Sweden LA county, one densely populated counties US. basically comparing numbers entire country one super high density small area wondering come confirmed cases higher? Well, already established - Italy Spain least, virus explodes clusters thus large variability larger regions. small region one cluster affect lot population, Sweden - regions spread example 25% population (that lived Stockholm region) affected region, rest Sweden much lower numbers. 

But also - throughout Europe see countries successful lockdowns suppression March April experiencing spike new clusters emerging. US March April states severely affected - NY, Washington sure others. states went lockdown, lot actually ""first wave"" yet order evaluate supression working many states actually controversial rules lockdowns (such declared religious gatherings ""essential service"" plenty examples Asia Europe significant risk high spread events). states reopened ones actually first wave well (even though still massive protests lot places) many ones first wave seeing surge. also complicated stop people one state travel another state - US states often size population single EU country EU lot restrictions unnecessary travel May. think comparison really meaningless - even numbers look similar, measures implemented different due circumstances countries. - time epidemic, time measures, different culture, different government, different geography climate - bet LA's houses AC running time year multiple studies increased transmission due air conditioning. Sweden even warm summer June, AC needed houses it. mean, fairness there's still lot know, I've hearing lot sources really spread way. 

Recent article [on want celebrate good news, may bit early celebrating. **One** week hard spin trend. number cases continues remain flat trend downwards (with level testing) next week, I'll feel confident Azar's confidence. then, I'll view cheerleading (which par course CNBC). 
 
Also, fear far many people hear wrong words wrong thing - learn NOTHING past, even recent past. like May, people saw curves trending down, they'll say ""Oh, good! pandemic over! rip mask head Applebee's tonight friends!"" way soon, two six weeks later (starting in, say, late September), we'll see people call ""third wave"" cases. Ugh. 
 
Also, Gottlieb cautioned “even states come down, states look like heating they’ll start offset gains making Sunbelt.” 
 
Get ready sudden surges cases Missouri, Iowa, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota. Time Midwest take new hot spot. shows cops racist, white. would left alone /s ya, major companies Also, played Phills, Didi plays, comment sub believed, Didi apparently kidney issues. Ugh Thing yet see economic fallout shutdown hit since there's quite lag input outcome. Since unprecedented there's way predict happen, think good. even pandemic subsided think dealing consequences lot longer. also- tf u work u fly job everyday? I’m intrigued that’s Reality liberal bias.  RIP internships frankly know single ""ARGH reopen!!"" person must physically present anywhere jobs. get work home want play time unimpeded others' peril.

Same every single ""send 'em school"" person gov't - single one sending kids back schoo'. kids mind get sick bring home. 

This one class (the ownership class) letting lower classes know literally care live die, shut go make $$$$. would think nurses ect make 31k year unemployment paying? Ew. Listen doctors cough gasp breath.  ? depends many companies compete hire employees.

Make America swole Exactly! one seems think people make 50-70k fucked Cold flu same. can't use terms interchangeably, can't bunch together. cancel payments bank / credit card? countries responded well inching back toward things were, I'm sure, though doubt remain completely unchanged. think US, though, major impacts going keep things ever exactly before.

* Many, many businesses transitioned work home model seen successful see cost saving model. expect office ever fully return was. potential drive industrial property costs wide spread enough, less gas usage/vehicle repairs/insurance costs/traffic. Less vehicular pollution. Etc. good stuff unless livelihood depends factors.
* Theaters already operate tight margins. AMC, largest theater chain, $5 Billion debt (prior Covid) said funds operate 2nd-3rd quarter assuming reopened. look good happen, even movies releasing *maybe* August, probably then. mention people go back right away. may see mass theater bankruptcies shut downs shortly here.
* theaters go, large budget block busters able make nearly much money. return send straight streaming, less theaters less money make per movie. We'll still get movies, 200-300 million dollar budgets could majorly shrink, along jobs go them. shrinks enough, fall budgets streaming services willing put per movie could yet another blow theater business. longer drags on, likely scenario becomes unless mega financial giant steps rescues them/buys theaters out.
* Many, many small businesses flat survive this. 
* supply chains lot things likely diversified. Solely production China shown risky. may come back on-shore, I'd imagine Made India places wages low could become much common thing. Supply chain resiliency actually good thing there.
* One would hope experiences would provoke long term overhaul healthcare system, probably optimistic point idiocy. 
* percentage population likely maintain level nervousness surrounding around large, un-distanced/masked crowds time come vaccine hits, keep business levels lower previously forecasted.
* Travel bans US flying overseas overseas flying US, along much limited domestic flights, definitely hitting Airlines. 
* Tourist attractions within US crushed may survive survive current model. Disney alone makes **billions** normal year across various parks. definitely hitting marks 2020.
* unemployment rate US June 11.1%. I'm sure number go down, lost jobs belonged businesses exist anymore harder hit quarantine. businesses fail going forward. leave lasting void time.
* four months we'll see what, any, impact within US political field.

I'm sure I'm missing lot here. virus mutates something vaccine-that-doesn't-exist-yet work against, people already Covid catch new strain, potentially go whole circus again. situation probably inch back closer normal now, see ever getting way again. big. Nice see setting stage companies follow.

Gives employees strength arguing continue WFH management insists well  but... President United States said we'd open Easter.

Is still thing? ""We're optimistic, cautiously optimistic"" vaccine work ""toward end year"" data prove it, Dr. Stephen Hoge, president Massachusetts-based Moderna, told House subcommittee last week, *AP* reported.

""I know chances exact right vaccine. thank goodness many others battling right now,"" Haller said.

a lot people cannot afford gym membership, time exercise, unhealthy foods usually way cheaper healthy ones. work 10+ hours day across two jobs feed couple kids home, extremely predictable people buy KFC McDonalds instead meal-prepping healthy nutritious dinner. lot people educated nutrition science either know plan affordable/healthy meals even want to. good see companies actually care employees. think necessarily *needs* done office, suffers inefficiency (and exposes possible points miscommunication/delay/failure) isn't. That's /s means No, entirely avoidable.

The strategies needed stop known since **14^th century** adopted world.

**Rwanda** managed take care it: **Dharavi**, biggest slum East Asia, managed it: doctor. knew every physician world danger December. trusted Chinese contain SARS. knew every physician world real deep shit, knew every physician world actions taken. trusted pandemic response plans prepared since 30 years would taken drawers enacted. know what? That's China did, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, East Asia. That's Europe – countries bit late, yet.

That's US did. pandemic avoidable. Confederate Rebels disease that's still killing though. Meanwhile China authoritarian mindset bettering “community” CCP, sacrificing freedoms using heavy handed tactics.  nowhere near level unfortunately. Yeah, wife go places without time, works it’s almost never time. older car goes, likely won’t replace one vehicle. imagine would slightly easier teaching child remotely lay hospital bed lol 100% true. even see Republican elected officials feel Trump things saying prior selected Presidential candidate. that, abrupt about-face started talking positively. like him, thought could use him. turns out, there's ""using him"" he's used well Russia, goal destabilize US. unless goal destabilize US, aligning Trump going work well you.

They refused bubble instead playing all, MLB pushed season anyway. remember reading America ruled pizza vegetable schools that's definitely long enough harsh enough punishment flaunting fucking swastika. probably told masks make hard breathe. Japan mid-February already this. Remember Diamond Princess transmission tourists Nara? right beginning.

Hotels signs everywhere regarding mask wearing (by staff). Many people street wearing masks. Sanitizer entrance many many stores. Masks incredibly difficult find, yet seemed everyone wore them. found masks final day, one package customer. - would hard time believing anything getting better states think another important aspect people talk bounce ideas lunch -- either related work otherwise. also learn lot engineers natural social interactions.

In general state programs, it’s hard get ahold actual human cannot helped website. maternity leave completely incorrect SSN papers first sent me! way access online portal since actual SSN didn’t match wrong one attached claim, took calling 2 days 300 calls (no joke) able talk someone change me. year Covid! can’t imagine slammed lines now. risk essentially choosing risk killing others, possibly family member Well that's interesting unfortunately nonsense totally wrong.

This must embarrassing you. brother friends it. fine 2 weeks. department public health called cleared quarantine. guess know better do? 

Some people may take longer recover, sure. painting picture everyone does.

No, points shit inaccurate. Even driving car risk killing someone, know we're talking covid here, end? Never go risk indirectly causing accident killing someone... South Carolina's numbers seem better. Fingers crossed. number tests (8K), % positive 14.6%. hope so. I'm Oakland I'm hoping see rent go down. judge BOSS! Whatever dumb fuck wrote article dishonestly conflating reported deaths (from weeks ago) lower death toll now.

No, dumb fuck. fact deaths delayed makes situation worse, better. numbers reported couple weeks (the deaths occuring today) even fucking higher. delayed reporting deaths masks true size crisis. inflate it.

Jesus fuck dumb shit article. Insert argument raising minimum wage here. think tech companies provide equipment. I'm software engineer pretty much every job I've ever worked given least laptop. point balance cost rent wait cost now. bought house $260k last year. '08 anything remotely go by, would able get similar house potential 2021 crash around $205k. Rent us though would cost $40k 2 years waiting prices drop. hope net $15k benefit worth renting 2 extra years gain plus equity? 

It's always whether wait prices drop, much whether figure prices do. Rents hold strong skyrocket people looking rent, landlords looking recoup money. things crash, bet ass loads people sitting cash waiting buy things up. Anyone waiting looking put nice 20% offer around asking price next year competing 5-10% asking cash. Maybe right great time buy, think fair look back years sulk. think it’s chain reaction both. Sam traveled Maine summer vacation fishing trip buddy, unknowingly caught COVID rest stop bathroom. Sam gave spouse Kelly hanky panky. Kelly talked neighbor Dorothy bit close spittle COVID flew lip infecting her. Dorothy quarantining well went stop &amp; shop car side pickup, COVID coughed credit card. Vita touched credit card rubbed eyes. Vita goes home family gives them. live local. AWS employee here; entire company us mandatory WFH guidance 1/8/2021 possibly extend depending bad numbers closer end year. really boredom, that's bit strawman-interpretation meant. drive humans consistent social contact evolutionarily-conditioned one. orthogonal boredom. That's like saying: *""if want girlfriend, watch porn?""*

You feel bored people, likewise, feel alone &amp; need social contact. really good adjective last one, though.

Or, businesses already re-opened, could forced close again.

Also, COVID-19 new virus. don’t know everything yet, death rate far thing concerned about. It’s true “only” small percentage infected actually die, appears consider long lasting health issues survivors deal with. still potentially cripple lot people rest lives think doesn’t pose threat you. “it’s virus” “it’s going kill people” mean free pass ruin people’s lives shouldn’t try wrestle infections manageable scale pushing congregate, party, re-open everything.

 totally right. 

My comments based fact “antibodies help ward infections,” people **could** get careful, cases show that. think exhaling oxygen pretty unique? interesting. know covid can't live carbon environment right? love pseudointellectuals live Reddit waiting something perceive falsehood. guess expected someone corona sub know human body functions.

Contagious probably means stay home right? I'm planning get vaccinated order prevent diseases. However, know Corona not. Would affected get vaccinated things Corona? actually liked working Thanksgiving got extra money found strangely fun,

Yep, biggest advancement history vaccines moderna vaccine makes phase 3. allow vaccines mass produced faster. note, Atlantic article large part based comment piece post discussing. mean wrong, really another source expert opinion matter.

That said, think I've seen opinions pushing we're underestimating risk transmission surfaces, I'd tend believe experts board this. interview Fauci experts weeks ago none disinfect groceries, although least one washing hands every time handled them, seems onerous wiping first bring in. Hard say. I’m really hoping looming threat flu cold season piling threat beefed covid wave inspire people stop crying start masking up. 

Especially since president finally started covering face holes public. Maybe people forget posturing showing superficial appeals personal liberty everyone aches sniffles becomes real hard tell whether you’re close contact covid.

But knows. pretty obvious what's propaganda facts. I'll give hint, epidemiologist right politicians fox news wrong.

For stage 2, also temporarily give back 6% salary budget. Departments vacant positions gave back positions temporarily cover 6%, without give back... furlough people.

Stage 3 another 6% salary budget temporarily reduced. We're yet, anticipated we'll go get there. we'll see.

Korean War footnote WW2 Vietnam, WW1 minor point Civil War WW2, Cold War lingering specter despite fact already ""over"", actually one things gripe since sort accurate even way old-ass materials indicated.

Having said that, technically span lot, one-sided stilted retrospect. Exact thing I'm :). think 

They claim 100% Sensitivity 99.6% Specificity, according local prevalence 5%, positive test result gives 92.9% chance actual Covid antibodies. Regional prevalence matters lot fewer people area Covid, likely antibodies got actually common cold corona-virus Covid. hard-hit region like New York City, test reliable (98.8% 25% regional prevalence), lightly hit area like Canada, test result less reliable (70% 1% regional prevalence). Take care! ""The big picture: 74-year-old Cain, co-chair Black Voices Trump, attended President Trump's rally Tulsa June wear mask.

Is place world, including individual states U.S. hit hard, saw things get better, rise level cases deaths exceeded initial wave?

It makes sense location would ""do better"" many vulnerable people already dead, people lifestyles likely cause infection already infected least immunity group.  think hit 70% infection dynamic least play part. Church masks optional service one required masks pandemic ended.

It's interesting level irresponsibleness see society.

They're outdoor services state restricted indoor gatherings 25.

We'd MUCH better position today happened. right, government could gotten away something like UK 80% salary replacement....think it, many people angry poorest underpaid among us making PUA salary. 

So institute blanket 80%-90% policy pay people weekly? will:

* longer paying scary poor people living wage
* spend salaries mid-level managers get laid employer salivates gov subsidizing six-figure salaries
* realistically charge toward 85-90% lockdown

which, according health experts empirical data italy, could stomp virus ^((im talking like &lt;1% infection rate, little chance multiple clusters existing around country, actually relax worry less rampant asymptomatic spread)^) less two months. Economic hardship? yes. LEVEL economic hardship uncertainty? i'd think wouldnt bad situation control 6 weeks ago...

No wonder yokels want pay taxes think government waste money. grocery stores converted curbside/delivery only. would made workers MUCH safer.

At outset pandemic, biggest grocery store chain (that Walmart) state temporarily suspend curbside delivery impossible demand. Orders would take *days* pick process, simply meet demand. took little get systems adjusted workable able restart service.

It's great idea paper, companies adjust thousandfold increase demand practically overnight.  think would happened first game World Series. play game 2 14 days?  sure mean. It'll go exactly like this. know either.

Im sure caught virus died soon definitely doomsday event..... TL;DR: ""overall COVID hospital admissions finally falling, rate ICU admissions roughly flat."" Agree hone get serious transmitted idiots rule like always think concern people heard wearing masks would slow spread would stop social distancing masks perfect lots people wear wrong rendering useless. said agree education messaging issue people wear masks social distance. Slippery slope Plenty countries seem able get numbers acceptable level Exactly. company sent us home March company-issued computers, phones, etc. would check inject let relatives inject me. doctor takes like 10€ 3min job mean stop wiping groceries lysol wipes? Thats pain ass. hit critical mass infected yet slow virus Los Angeles. We're paying price relative success controlling virus.

If look Sweden, hard-hit areas Europe, especially northeastern U.S., cases appear hit certain critical mass infected drop linear way. rough guess maybe 20-25% infected (real number maybe due asymptomatic cases never got tested).

LA County, bad is, still place 10 million people relatively low per capita case death rate. guess we're maybe 10-15%. hit infection wall yet virus starts run places go.

As much people throw around 70% number herd immunity, recent studies indicated threshold might much lower hidden immunity factors differences threshold homogeneous heterogeneous populations.

It's good question. That's answer. I'm authority anything collating information, though. not. Work company area - practically every silicon valley company heard salary decreases

The caveat leave, might decrease salary col might go way down. end hurt tech employees, adjustment probably equal col transfer I’m new employee confirm, remote environment sucks new employee. started job less month quarantine. barely time meet colleagues isolated houses. It’s put serious damper building relationship teams work with.

Plus, there’s convenience working home, think people underestimate value face face interaction white collar jobs. testing reportedly best 30% wrong (false pos false neg). Moreover, good moment take test. could exposed ten minutes later. Essentially meaningless, except BS politicians spew. **one** projection clearly implies possible outcome *if* measures taken. Nothing false headline. Maybe outside labeled BLM protest? Idk people would wanna intentionally fat, like Id imagine shit sucks. often enough justify two cars.

The point cost computing goes straight household budget.

My wife, kids, good enough teamwork planing owning one amazing car might better owning two nice-ish cars.

But really depends live. lived (rural) places every adult requires car. live now, though, requirement relaxed, core city built early 1900s rebuilt since. live Rural America, McMansion Territory, need cars -- that's expense comes lifestyle choose.

But what?

Even reason maintain multiple cars, still paying gas, maintenance, wear &amp; tear commuting -- something pay order job. similar principle cost maintaining home office. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m still going go outside, I’m staying house months. go walks. go beaches aren’t crowded. work yard. fires outdoors friends maintaining distance. 

People trying tell others stay indoors nuts. data reported states though, it? know, disagree little bit. choose work large extent. husband able share car years commute allowed it. chose companies worked chose bought house. are, makes hard see numbers really look like. Beginning May less 30000 week 14-17% positivity rate. 40-50000 point think we’d caught presymptomatics maybe could’ve sharper drop. 80000 don’t really make much difference except confirming cases dropping. Damn, wish worked Google. Fuck people. I’ve close assaulting mother fuckers know doing. AKA, God helps help I'm leaving 1bdrm Oakland exactly lol Weekend test numbers always lower. Yes, ""wake worse Spanish Flu"" shitty way frame - sounds like ""Yawn, worst pandemic last 150 years cares"" So... lockdown, wear masks, social distance, isolate known symptoms... nothing new people. chances dangerous side effect years road?

2. Yes, everything delivered. inside store since &lt;checks 3/15/2020. last in-person grocery store trip.
3. missed flu shot least 7 years.

Anything else? turn. Please answer questions. bodyweight things

If right, even simple yoga routine work everything plenty things realize there's comment! I'll hold breath formally announced, there's plan distribute it, people actually take job grade salary partially based job location/cost living. I'd definitely risk paid much say moved bumfuck that's better. now, work camp. aren’t borders shut? Estimate amount people smoke: \~1 billion

Estimate amount cars road: \~ 1.4 billion

8m/1b = 0.8% 

1.3m/1.4b = 0.093%

Covid far = 650,000/10,100,000(Resolved Cases) = 6.4%

If COVID amount cases people smoke cars road deaths would 40,000,000 55,000,000. Although estimate.

Edit incorrect % 0 active cases time.  fair, interned people based looks. would locking based upon decision typhoid mary. Won’t crowds Black Friday though? cancelling too?
Make make sense. Another way everybody gets virus. call herd immunity. countries cities taking approach even come close exhausting bad ideas yet. tried re-visit good ideas. hire remote competing computer programmers India. Bye bye salaries NBA right plan sure, players cant stop breaking quarantine. someone go strip club weekend. Someone get tempted, go out, come back infected. longer season goes tempting it'll get whole state open. OP's point people argumentive mandates good oftentimes, seems, sport it. item bullet list kind matches mask orders vaccination requirements. Otherwise, hey, want face degloved windshield, brains splattered across guardrail, eat early grave...I frankly huge problem it. wish would *not*, choice end.  difference damage ends you. take 11 family members god knows many innocent strangers process (generally speaking).  think people still questioning whether get once. Heh country garbage  ""Small gathering"" aka fucking party. Educate away guess count Americans slipping keep pandemic going rest world.

USA number one!!!11!! /s Nah Google understands employee perks, like free meals longer provided. Google also saving money feeding everyone. real threat salaries would influx employee pool talent less expensive regions. could probably cut engineering salaries half hiring people mid-west. Well im truck driver already know going automate job there's Unlikely. would incredibly hard justify unless already receiving stipend specifically commute. get promotions, raises, bonuses, etc. commute - (in experience) merit-based. Yes. Private businesses allowed enforce dress codes. ""No Nazi masks"" part dress code agree. think reason US gotten hit bad federal government really act all, left states. states fuck (like several have), doesn’t really matter well others much domestic travel work, summer vacation, spring break vacation, etc. look countries handled pandemic well (South Korea comes mind), huge immediate action national government, United States job all. BLM? Cops dont even need there. cops Republicans sending Portland. bully people there. Getting manageable level would ultimate step 1. 

After need actually commit managing it. requires lot federal direction funding, state cooperation, everybody listening scientists. think we're gonna turn ship around another 50,000 die? careful go. husband went late one night ran someone robbing cashier gun. like title states “It works - don’t care many people die”.

Even people could family. Even trails humans end (assuming they're successful) manufacturing distribution around world nightmare probably last months unfortunately Agreed. Think much know virus treat since 3-4 months ago. People going hold much longer, even get vaccine soon. Rebels? mean ""state's rights aficionados?"" /s I’m fortunate. already space work from, even though it’s gaming area.

Even better longer 400 mile per week drive minimum 1.5 hours car. buying lunch company cafe wear T-shirt’s gym shorts. I’m one load laundry per week instead three four. 


Electric bit home, much. haven’t needed increase Internet caps, change cost.  won’t. Could easily become FMAGA.... Ya sorry, sometimes forget moment mistake sociopathic capitalists actual humans. America needs end bullshit ""unity"". 

States like NY California paying (literally metaphorically) ineptitude South Midwest. country divided, hyperpolarized, hostile realistically combat major crises--COVID put full display. Americans face greater threat bretheren, time actually acknowledge perhaps split order. mean hes right. severe now. really need move point. find helps well keep grounded. consider grandparents high risk death social-distancing-decision make. It’s clear day outbreaks worse places reopened earliest don’t take mask wearing seriously. latest outbreaks completely uncorrelated geographically BLM protests happened. Put aside scapegoat WANT blame look facts logic said, think something able opt of. girlfriend works Yelp told two weeks ago they'll working home June 2021. case thing ill caring music nobody cares me. Sort sub “New” start clicking every Florida story one; read one. you? lot fuckin pressure Commi$$ioner $port$ really get US flattening curve showing decent progress - suddenly reopened debating do.  Given weight number 2 correlation hospitalization (age number 1 would shed years could) , able figure recommended. make masks mandatory, getting least moderate weight? Thank you!

I know how, misread something yesterday (I sick something, that's excuse, I'm sticking it) got head antigen test, research wrong test ever since.

Edit: NAA Test. get tax credit home office? Canada. extra costs essentially cover themselves. companies this. base average income live. sniffles bro!!! can't still play??????

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* United States government invaded country

First time?.jpg It’s 2020. vast majority Google employees (and employees ton industries, we’re honest) don’t need office get jobs done. physically present somewhere hardly requirement office tech jobs anymore. unlike anything encountered before, people could possibly get careful.

[Antibodies put way. punched nose, tried explain rational point likely would listen?

That's often state in. Seeing anyone tries counter stance 'the enemy'. Dr Fauci discouraged mask wearing first mainly PPEs scarce want people hoarding like toilet paper denying people healthcare. Everyone knows data huge liberal bias. Yeah... baseball players stand apart normally. Football players spend several hours face face huffing puffing bashing around. wouldn’t work unless sure everyone clean start game. hell lot players field sideline given game. Damn, win dumbest argument year. Congrats. Naw dude, guy already said problem infecting/killing others gain. actually feel bad right point. Thats cause Union merged pay productive hours rather commutes costs transport.  last sentence pretty key. diets. entire rest world Facebook, advertising, etc. it’s though we’ve got excuses. go google dont give damn :) fat  tell Netherlands somebody set protest DJ etc invited forbidden. allowed protest must keep 1.5 distance persons, expectation would possible. also BLM protest stopped 1.5 meter rule. Yea fuck them. Shame away. Accidentally spreading virus isn’t illegal figurative.

You lose money gamble.

You infect family see them. 

However, that's difficult social animal ingrained cope. crisis, likely want around friends family. people OH would probably applaud Obviously ....like Harvard? asked difference Harvard Coursera. top-tier accredited college offered entire degree online no, much difference beside prestige networking. moving goalposts. Media desperate tie everything racism. See: everything. odds are:
- 100% infect others around stupidity
- 100% end hospitalized

It matter hospitals full not. point wilfully refused take precautions, thus getting sick. that, morons spreading around them, potentially fatal results others. 

The current dead rate Corona US 3.4%. means there's high chance least one initial 40 die it.

Death rate: treat morons? God good enough them? gonna make claim going need proof that. different people right ""claiming"" covid deaths inflated people pressured call covid death. American would like know make mandate enforced supermarkets? 

I got back supermarket Greece masks mandatory 50% wore masks correctly, 30 % wore masks works rest wore mask Por que los dos? would sprayed second dude wearing mask also got 10 days suspension. agree sports non-essential. issue ridiculous amounts money surrounding sports... players, facilities, TV rights, merchandise, betting, sports bars, etc

They desperate revenue   shoppers even going able afford turkeys Thanksgiving, much less money go holiday shopping. Actually researching this; it’s possible. wouldn’t count it, personally  Meh, guns also extremely useful nonviolent situations. fact, exactly people trained apply concealed carry. police trained. best gunfight gunfight. unarmed populous compliant populace. familiar Lexington Concord? We'd united states Brittain without weapons.

Your fake equivalency is, ""this guy used gun hurt people, shold ban guns 150m lawful gun owners guns protect nut cases.""

Im gun owner due live. cars - cars kill people guns, alcohol cigarettes? Ban too? stop? adjourning May, state lawmakers tried pass bill would’ve protected schools liability lawsuits related COVID-19. bill passed House get vote Senate.  Doug Ducey asked Thursday would consider calling special session address liability issues schools. Ducey said he’s waiting see Congress “before make decision around next step.”

Unfortunately already speak better do. Like south beach worst people can’t afford feed kids, way sometimes. Single mom raised us, sometimes money needed bills. vice Cigs never spent money hungry. talking about? Texas always large number people dying pneumonia height summer. many scrimmages first game 2 days 0 new cases far Yeah say degree normalcy vaccinate vulnerable healthcare workers teachers (we 100 million doses upon approval believe correct I’m wrong) small amount leeway things would go PERFECTLY happen

I don’t really expect major change mid 2021 Funny baseball one sports could play ok mask... makes double down. confuse felling cathartic solving problem. think tried avoid causing panic react issueing sudden lockdown order. Despite proud run 99 day tranmit free, there’re lot idiots travelling. It’s better let go back home issue quarantine order base travel history. I'm Columbus housing market shows sign slowing prices much much higher I've ever seen them. I've decade Southern Cali thought hit real estate jackpot first moved. Everything super affordable got whole lot house actual land relatively little.

Now, good luck finding anything sub $250 that's decent whole rehab. important note time lot things different now.

1. work could done remotely
2. Eating restaurants less frequent middle class.
3. home schooling common young children
4. Daycare likely involve families trading favors, large group settings
5. Air travel significantly limited
6. Medical knowledge much limited

Additionally, think conclusion restrictions less severe bit limited - restrictions day-to-day might been, restrictions have. article linked, example, indicates mandatory quarantines (with fines failing report illness quarantine tents) restrictions interstate travel (including commerce).  also note states closed borders Victoria particular - seems area loosest restrictions, imposed latest, articles note often blamed bringing spanish flu Australia. also restored restrictions later on, including [closing schools later NSW, noted completely closed lot things quickly, lifted end february complaints strict, delayed re-imposing lesser restrictions cases rose sharply (and criticized well). restrictions continued much past march/april timetable.

I also can't find much way article claiming response spanish flu considered particularly good, even time period. shut game tipoff. Clearly cautious league. Seat belts, air bags, crumple zones, object detection, shatter free glass, traffic laws.

Masks, social distancing.

Just less dangerous mean careless 🙄 pro concealed carry, I'm curious think point is. I'd like details happened, little article, unhappy armed patrons there. suppose folks get medicine, groceries, home repairs etc. somehow, miraculously avoiding EVERYONE people like come contact with? There’s reason South Korea Vietnam (not mention Europe) much better us. US many citizens don’t view community world. Hyperindividualism order day.

Edit: emphasis added 14d old account Closing state borders big one. says could continue active outdoors mean.. you. Blind faith gets nowhere. Stop hinting right say it. Look, know people say that, know based (other really bad conjecture beginning virus). Sweden best example happens shut numbers look like bad flu season. fatality rate appears worse flu 80+, less flu 60. Maan, somone refer Google pls 😭 though? Insurance suppose cover rare catastrophic occurrences. Things 1 [large number] ailment problem [large number] people/corps paying 1/[large number]th (plus small fee) reasonable thing. 

If problem becomes common catastrophic insurance becomes prepayment system value minimized. would imagine nailed it. people wanna imagine otherwise we’ve got bullshit fat apologism people use justify inadequacies. 4.6% entire population actual thyroid problem could POSSIBLY make difficult lose weight. assuming entire 4.6% population obese (which surely many not), using back napkin math, still leaves 98 million overweight undisciplined Americans. It’s choice.  Alcoa definitely rich. meet small groups, physically distance, meet outside, wear mask, bring food. Lots options. sad need happen. talked said that’s okay Pffffft, like sensible person would move Florida first place. High-paying jobs scarce LCOL area.

Commuting win us.

But, work home, transportation costs go housing costs go up.

🤷🏻‍♂️ oh itll cheapen landlords realize nobody renting computing

I recently doubled ram wife 16 32gb. results AMAZING. Tipping service. tip waiters &amp; delivery people. going pick food taking back home, tip needed. Although good tip current conditions since restaurants can't table service. think wild suggest people condemned mocked basically complying completely shutting life year basically one weeks notice late March early April. 

And say someone wears mask literally everywhere works home days week. 

Like, able shut like upper middle class, upper class luxury. sobering truth many Americans option stay home entire year moment's notice. don’t understand concept. would ever WANT people get infected? It’s quite obvious bringing spread virus control leads quick return near-normalcy, letting people get infected saying “well bad” people die, suffer significant health consequences, go bankrupt medical bills. 

But even reason okay that, still terrible plan. let people get infected either get rapidly, overwhelming healthcare system, slowly time would get may well vaccine anyway. meantime life realistically going far normal.

Natural “herd immunity” modern age know transmission works save lives ridiculous I’m tired hearing it. Yeah reason fucked politically pretty mundane: corruption. climate change, globalism, increasing human encroachment formerly wild areas, expect Covid-19 first many exotic diseases spread like wildfire across globe. new normal. always easy, guilt trips quite powerful. paying $100 month gas, hundreds (or thousands) year upkeep, stress commute (or lost time) pay school care, forced need costs summer school. things would open $700/month budget I’d WFH full time (I’m IT) wife continued office. 

And benefit employer? could close entire building save money lease, utilities, security, maintenance, etc. flex hours take late meeting instead declining rushing home. take walk dog lunch better physical mental health, leads productive pleasant employee. 

The chief downside less face time network co-workers, co-workers spread state. still happy hour 2 people team home city. probably stupid question, I’m prone panic attacks want ease mind. possible trouble breathing symptom? Like absolutely cough, throat issues, fever anything? Negative. 2 friends isolated quickly get family sick. Everytime someone dies stockmarket rings bell. Rebels should’ve shooting enemies bats. Many masks longer stay nose. slides ear straps tight anymore. best masks tie behind head.  Remember got PPE order confiscated feds peak, get Patriots' owners fly jet China bring back masks ensure next batch stolen too? leader said much difficult children catch pass.. percentage classroom there? Edit: 10 % I'd prefer cardiovascular health top shape sacrifice I'm willing make. really think Americans still eat much meat should. used thought luxury. What's interesting events media focuses on. IIRC home office one things still without itemized deductions. rules counts rule people able claim anyways.  It’s gamble. It’s turning situation life death situation hoping upper hand hoping rational enough see it. Good point. implied defense tyrannical government policies. Maybe strike day. Get people’s attention. Hong Kong medical professionals strike. admit following super closely, understand anyone wears mask quarantines receives lifetime ban state Florida, logistics moving Miami Marlins quarantined players much. actually seceded.

They actually seceded. Yes. includes moralizing condescending... think we'll able pull off. :( January June 30, Florida reported 8,671 excess deaths, that’s double 3,650 deaths state attributed COVID-19. ( source: )

Perhaps call investigation instead. I'm done listening them. want anything disgraceful culture. Insurance denial won’t impact boomers though since pay government-given healthcare. Problem never really collectively locked down. way legally “evict” right? aren’t many us remotely support kind common sense gun control. 

Most people I’ve dealt with, asked “gotcha” question “well, civilians allowed rocket launchers?” answer mix “yes” “ya, two.” flamethrowers. 

The question would happen deranged maniac got, example, [minigun decided put back van unload festival doesn’t come folks. ""Food desert"" 

Delivery services, popular due COVID, resolve this, requires menu planning skills taught extra costs delivery service, either baked price added on. SNAP cannot used pay delivery fees, food itself, presents challenge families actual sick person. Absolutely shameful. I'm high risk group; hope vaccine available soon, cause people small rural county hate masks. think covid flu. Lol Maybe, maybe, freedoms. Maybe selling bullets.

One possible avenue socialization is... Starcraft 2 Arcade, social internet-based party games like Mafia - quite fun time time. think Starcraft 2 free.

Download: Info: = dancing sucking smoke (which personal cup tea), something. Hope helps. 'There's old saying Tennessee — know Texas, probably Tennessee — says, fool once, shame — shame you.’ Except it’s damn complicated 95% people.

It basic Thermodynamics weight gain, pretty basic self control habits appetite. last weeks I’ve gone able eat half pizza wanting chicken thigh, zucchini, water filling. took week really resisting urges eat drink more. property taxes considered regressive taxes burdens inheritors more. shifting burden tax-exempt entities like corporation cause tax burden shift consumption income taxes means working class gets screwed most. 

plus fact working class spend time money getting work getting back home dealing traffic, becomes another tax inheritors pay actually benefit another income stream them. 

the tax-exempt properties allowed factories actually needed production. pointless office buildings made illegal. tax revenue lost eliminating obtained property taxes puts burden back inheritors. Nashville past fall wedding. bars main strip unbelievably crowded. can’t imagine COVID compatible businesses. there’s going lot stories like around thanksgiving christmas.

COVID-19 Treasonists...You gotta pump up, rookie numbers. gives hope. 3 countries they're carrying trials 3 hit countries, hopefully means quicker results. Ideally countries would implement strict lockdown measures we'd beat globally sheer will, that's realistic. someone supervise they're remote learning?

When schools become day care? going endanger many communities rely schools supervise children otherwise can't? Sure depends, even ones equipment ""yours"" meaning ""if breaks, deal it"". understand, also unexpected headache people used ""my monitor blue lines, please replace"". baseball stadiums around many people hold?

Travel restrictions seem work pretty well countries like Taiwan, New Zealand, China, etc. He's going fed dead up. high volume retail manager years former life always refused go shopping thanksgiving principle. don’t care good sales cheap crap. Thanksgiving food/family day. Sorta. ton restaurants added online ordering due pandemic, others would annoyed calling ahead encourage now.

It definitely option before, suddenly much socially acceptable. wrote letter stating Trump Trump he’d fittest person ever elected presidency, Trump bragged weeks. doctor later admitted Trump dictated letter think good rule thumb politician is: follow money, look records. used hope Mitch McConnell redeemable, he’s repeatedly show us serves. I’ll trust gives reason to, interests ever temporarily align, accept help watching back. (It’s approach take senators rep.)

I’ve noticed co-opting language issues several fronts. least know people charge listen, don’t want actually fix things people tell problems.

Teaching US definitely faint heart normal times. Right now? It’s illuminating learn life thinks “I’d rather risk wearing ventilator” controversial selfish position. Since I’m past deadline resign without penalty, I’m using remains summer furlough lobby board make safety-focused decisions lobby union enforce safe work environment section contract. reason I’m asking yet boss made significant accommodations me. I’m autistic ADD, COVID absent lotttt. Like way much, person would fired... thankfully mom boss familiar challenges. also dropped ball important projects last year pregnant. Don’t feel I’ve earned yet. plan spend next months showing value remote employee, January I’ll ask. generally gives everyone raise every year January anyway, I’m college grad making $11 hour... stay flexibility love industry. Then, investigation proves fruitless, he'll attack investigators investigation investigation... enough go around. want shortage produced much vaccines work Oh see. Thank clarification :) might worst thing. employees use opportunity go live somewhere cheaper might still come ahead. Employers follow approach transparently. Philadelphia 500 new cases today, weeks 100-200 daily case plateau.

Keep eye potential new hotspot. suspect something blame fat acceptance movement. know person talking about, overweight get annoyed people make ""positive"" comments weight. experience might shed light seeing.

If fat, receiving end moral aesthetic judgement -- slothful, gluttonous, lazy, lacking virtue, ugly, probably also stupid. means everything around weight turns emotional minefield. whole issue weight loss would less complicated could drain swamp make health issue *just* health.

On occasions lost weight, there's one relative greets with, ""Oh! lost weight!!"" -- tone voice tell dog ""good boy!"" (She'll say even lost weight even I've gained some, suggests default mental image even fatter.) makes angry suggests weigh big part cares me.

Even remarks done tactful conversationally-appropriate manner, may stepped similar land mine. care person, please take hint walk around minefield. tell look great compliment shirt/tie/earrings/etc. suspect that's also usually framed around obesity instead unhealthy weights general. think amount people obese, realize it, take offense suggestions unhealthy pretty small. Even amount who'd actually encounter ""obesity kill you"" story change buy result. easy way frame story actually put ratings, clicks, profits danger. 

But imagine news organizations put emphasis fact fat becomes danger even people get overweight range. Let alone many people 'are' overweight range realize think they're danger. 

It reflects poorly lot different parts society. whole lot industries function essentially tricking customers slow painful death decades time. many industries complicit speaking taking sweet fast/packaged/junk food ad money. Biden primary Reade allegations turned credible. backlash would sunk him, Wiener, Franken also Eric Schneiderman prove, take trash - elect them.

If credible accusers, spoken out? We've two dozen Trump accusers, bravely took stand. claim ""likely"" dozens Biden exactly zero evidence back up. None. Zilch.

And yes, people Alabama - Moore's history rape came election. knew voting care. Millions preferred rapist Democrat.

Listen, would thrilled scandal forced Biden Bernie could nominee, happen. something dark buried Biden's past, would come long - he's government highest levels literally decades.

You're mad worst Democratic sex offender history movie producer instead president. Yes, want nightlife, shows, events. Wait minute.... Please provide much-vaunted evidence claim have, see unjustified assertions. much evidence based government lies continuously clue doing, flip flopping around without rhyme reason. Somehow people like continue believe trust them, seems much like definition madness. theory America successful quickly people got high supply per say. generations media shown told us best everything leader world. lot people country think existing born America makes special means accomplished something. watching tv day, eating trash never reading book makes great hey, American. half country that's curious, educated accepting others ever that's trying balance scum out. lived Florida 30 years. number thinkers state minuscule best. mean gloss deaths, matter much anyone, still find perplexed gotten reporting data prison outbreaks. seems like ideal chance get data transmission, ifr estimates, many people truly remain asymptomatics. Etc. tweet imply breathing himself? assume bottomdwellers teeth. Went work today. Found 9am dad positive Friday. wife's boss tested positive Saturday. 

When told HR, treated like dog told kept myself....?

1400 people work work? issues times. There's lot new construction $350K+ price range...for condo majority $500K. Investors buying rehab properties they're still cheap. really? sure smoke dust instead? weed come long way, plenty strains appease whatever ill facing. maybe nice indica blend body less head ya good. $40 reasonable developed countries even requires two doses initially yearly booster. I'm willing shell $80 year family member feel safe. actually big deal insurance companies almost always defend claim ordinary circumstances face bad faith action refuse defend insured claiming policy cover it.

As recall Bill Cosby's insurance company covered litigation expenses even though also claiming covered sexual assault claims.

By writing explicit exclusion, effectively eliminates insurance company incur litigation expenses would costly even ultimately actual liability.

Not defending insurance companies least force school districts factor liability expenses decide open. lot ""good"" policy happens corporation decides expensive risky otherwise. Sports provide tons jobs way people distract themselves, important.

Baseball's plan probably least realistic. 

NBA seems like likely work. end dumb americans ones common sense. possible, also going Investigate people Coronavirus never tested? addressing issues one angle? death injury rate much significantly higher... mass hysteria panic? Why? numbers actually good healthy numbers... death injury isnt ideal, inevitable cant go living lives fear hiding people preventable capability dying Cool man. Way bend backwards what’s already expected 👍 No, phase 1 2 mainly judge safety vaccine effectiveness. test antibody count phase 1 2 get idea would provide protection. phase 3 really test effective vaccine actually preventing infection.

You detect antibody phase 1 2 necessarily mean vaccine provides protection, could well antibody produced target introduced antigen nothing actual virus.

That's also conduct phase 1 2 anywhere, phase 3 must done place there's active outbreak. Hence Sinovac phase 3 trial Brazil. mean reflection America handling virus they're handling sports Right, you. Everyone's situation different. I'm tech geek, monitors actually use, literally server rack garage, redundant ISPs I'm unlikely unable work, onsite offsite backups, enough spare gear cobble together replacement work machine afternoon. I'm weird, lucky 2 isps available (even one shit) besides cellular satellite. He'll nine weeks. switched fully remote job (laid previous job) see benefit office 100%. lot undercommication going on, purpose course. People miss messages someone forgot CC slack them. Impromptu quick 10 min chats need scheduled advance IMO kind loses “in moment” idea talks. 

I love freedom working home. feel like teamwork emphasized, working office may actually beneficial. Lol yeah sorry scientists virologists health professionals said risk contracting covid blm rally protest protest lockdowns kn danger contracting spreading disease. 

Sorry reads bullshit double standard [Federal support build state local capacity manage new viral crisis fell 50% 2003. POTUS gets claim success stopping climate change passing M4ALL. Never mind.

The MurdochChildren’s Research Institute Australia conducting phase 3 trial using nearly 100-year-old tuberculosis vaccine. vaccine thought protect directly Covid-19 might boost body’s non-specific immune response. huge crowd, think chainsmokers anything them. Public education isn’t national. Try again. Anything distract failings. theory America successful quickly people got high supply per say. generations media shown told us best everything leader world. lot people country think existing born America makes special means accomplished something. watching tv day, eating trash never reading book makes great hey, American. half country that's curious, educated accepting others ever that's trying balance scum out.  understand Insurance boards dictate Liability coverage gyms restaurants must cover claims covid associated establishments. we'll see open insurance coverage cancelled. Everyone overreacting here. Texas completely expected. mask order (although much teeth, still increased compliance) bars closed weeks ago, lines plateauing cases. also reduced restaurant capacity halted elective surgeries again. Even orders generally much teeth, places seem comply positive effect. incredibly shitty here, taken governor months implement anything, least helping. need state officials get board. cases might decline like states had, especially many people resisting state, finally progress 2 months increasing cases. criminal anything pretend policies fucked state. sincerely wish did. Weed opposite effect me. It’s actually anxiety issues started first place... They've publishing research subject months - need wait.

Please link. aware international investigation Wuhan's lab conducted. investigate crazy bullshit 

Wait. already investigation? saying not? species naturally evolved lab got past safe guards PPE escaped species naturally evolved outside lab easily infected people unprepared.

The species native Wuhan. lab study bat viruses.

So Occam's razor points lab likely. know funny enough damn thing jumped pangolin

There zero ACTUAL evidence right pangolin intermediate species. conjecture, removed Occam's razor SHOWN otherwise.

We need investigation yesterday. Yeah. It’s ease access others random conversations help lot. don’t mind kids interrupting (colleagues often brought kids office previously). could knock someone’s office ask question.. wait respond slack messages.  could discussing something team mate would chime helpful insights. gone. get work done, takes lot effort time. Ugh. 

Also snacks - don’t miss much far much empty calories :/ Senate/unemployment post marginally coronavirus. swastica one, maybe little bit still racism culture war it. allow those, basically allow news politics posts entire next year, coronavirus fact daily life now. Seems bit broad sub. guess mods want main topic article virus. main topic articles coronavirus? answer no, post here. Would leave pretty funny mask bulge though Interesting question/point. Fauci TWIV couple weeks back, discussing that. brought point viruses present attack body systemically. Another words people get basically attacks organs opposed presenting some, much milder respiratory fashion. point virus/disease cause systemic problems often offer much longer term protection/immunity historically. theory tossing around. Permanent though, probably not.... 15-20% antibody testing, PCR. That's partly got 10x approximation from, antibody % roughly 10x PCR % Please civil. 

Death death, matter contagion killed not. fixed combination policy individual choices. high costs society.

The fact isn’t contagious disease actually makes dangerous. Contagious diseases tend fizzle out. Plus even got it, still .5 percent us would die later average age obese. difference 100 percent us could potentially obese. 100 percent us certainly wouldn’t die C-19. ceiling scale obesity problem far potential. I've WFH'ed years now, though I'm OP, answering similar-but-different situation: pay laptop, offer pay stuff like keyboard / mouse / monitor, offer benefits like stipend commuting (which get keep without commuting). Employee pays EVERYTHING else make WFH viable. I've opted choose hardware desk, laptop, since I'd rather blow tiny fortune making comfortable taking nice-but-limited-selection corporate offerings. afford it, $14 gas spend anymore every single day. That's savings almost $1500 / year switching 2 days / week office full time WFH!  know! temporarily furloughed couple months even expect qualify still job technically agreed furlough. yeah, turns qualify surprised making unemployment before. 

I felt kind guilty it, like somehow cheating system. I'm back work reduced hours due covid. I'm making less pandemic. I'm glad boost saved up. think reduced hours/ pay quite time. kids school Mrs. Obama’s meal plans went effect. hated food, said terrible. made lunches that. lunches made pretty healthy. still, idea didn’t work well school lunch became unpopular. But, it’s intention counts, right? Right - originally posted rejected posted source article.

I referring sources I've seen weeks downplaying surfaces much risk transmission. I'll still wash hands, try touch face, etc  nonsense restaurants sanitizing every surface that's risk seated downwind another table isn't... .007% USA population like 25k people, like many people die per month current rates. 🤣 WFH, I’d likely increase charging laptop cell phone. AC/heat already pets day long leave tv background noise them. world miss them. flipside flipside though successful situations. MLS Back tournament bubbled players gone two weeks without positive case: I'm sorry. thought posted article. such, assuming trying defend veracity article itself, nothing argue facts Reason prefers call doubt data collected.


I familiar Ross style ""questioning"" commentary Reason number Publications. always better asking questions providing answers. Oftentimes questions loaded leading.


It feels though positions political rather science-based, might appropriate subreddit. don’t follow UK politics would mind elaborating pointing articles? Although makes sense, still interesting know/verify. That's point.

To delay hospitals everyone else. think fair assessment all.

*Most folks want everything shut also want government provide stimulus payments directly people affected.*

No one advocating letting families starve suffer. work wastewater plant aside place 90% white males overweight. run regularly talking colleague said hell...you're shape person really looked around yeah...there's one guy pretty short he's still like 10-15 pounds overweight. 100+ healthy weight.  first guy escalated firearm. bad thing, part gun control advocates might point proof guns shouldn’t get hands. 

The reaction armed patrons 2A / CCW proponents point proof system working, giving much weight bad guy gun. Certainly, bad guy didn’t suck, could blood bath. man shooting AR-15 lit building outdoors get lot unanswered shots spotted accurately shot within lit building looking darker area.

Also, one monitor. year this? Assuming he's still around.

3 weeks ain't good That’s terrible.  know...have federal government use tax dollars help small businesses instead big corporations ""small"" businesses owned millionaires... process aside wanted know virus difficult one make vaccine with, usually coronaviruses notorious. RNA virus considered difficult.. wish someone could share realistic picture. Another milestone. Good job USA. Number 1 always. /s

Wish could come percentage deaths would preventable people gave fuck virus. think big tech end date end competitive reasons. could someone throw weights tough lift clear across room? Whoa there. “Spiraling” level drama never claimed, dude. overall increase gun violence. 

Just noting increase types incidents making news/social media much attention they’re getting dumbest thing I’ve ever heard Sounds like understand virus transferred care. someone works retail. going busy Black Friday. Back counting people store never busier. counting anymore people stopped showing up. know is, like hard get place people scramble get in.

My prediction pissed crowds (not able shop thanksgiving/having wait strict lines) even worse online orders sane people stayed home. ""What cost lies?""

Everyone rewatch HBO's Chernobyl miniseries. even poignant right now, science vs politics happening around world. Viruses always mutate virus doesn’t mutate often doesn’t effect efficacy vaccines development one best ones RESEARCH Masks slow allow hospitals treat patients without overrun. Billionaires acting like ya favor make millions stimulus packages. “$1,200 cover Christmas, right?”

Meanwhile slashing unemployment benefits $600 week $200 currently defunded federal aid. So... yeah... I’ve got $0 income industry (production) completely shut down... 

Pull bootstraps? Oh wait, don’t shoes Lot delusional people NV casino convention customers coming back pandemic resolved.  Yes, local state government things lowered bit. Although STILL gong get ""did nothing"" numbers anyway. at, 170k-180k already counting excess deaths? now?! can't even open gym Michigan. Sounds like need new job. It’s Tim Heidecker, definitely serious  handful them, maybe, mobilized idiots country. Yeah friend posted Instagram massive boat party yesterday somewhere Jersey shore. used think friends smart. trashed house party nobody came. Pfizer. They're type mRNA exhale pure carbon. Nope, actually exhale oxygen well. worse someone ignorant, arrogant unwilling accept fact ignorant, actually something little closer vacuous.

Most health practices vastly overrated damage, we're going bother going road can't seem grasp basic concepts breathing.

As recoil horror fact check yourself, delete comment knowing smiling. Hamptons. rules apply rich people obviously. sports spread - find incredible people willingly pay play cards casino right now. Everyone touches everything multiple times, players get moved about, everyone close proximity. 

Vegas casino employee union already saying tens workers/family members died. 

Can't understand people would willingly put danger, plenty people holidaying Florida right Like...using secret police pick people protesting dear leader? Macon area getting hit rather hard know. Emergency rooms full suspected COVID cases. Nice know care public's health, poor healthcare workers stuck working 12+ hour shifts daily. plus side actually developing vaccine using dead virus could prove effective long run. still long way go. besides, sharing vaccine means would share formula, physical vaccine. way every country produce batches. Yes American Christian ISIS types. Lunatic fringe. Traitors American flag country. 

Also, free speech fee country. mean yeah. rate looking next Summer soonest expect normal come back. :( Shit going get better country anytime soon!

 wish people stopped selfish science denying whiny assholes accept fact virus keep wreaking havoc everybody buys mask wearing, socially distancing waiting pandemic out. following new CDC recommendations. Im pretty sure trying put stop people requiring negative test returning work due testing already jammed areas. can't personally tell safe following new guidelines probably anything it. Found Ru's account. still agree numbers base fact reported Dr.Campbell lot pressure present idea lot people already gotten virus serological surveys always disappointing based random sampling. One serological survey NYC put 17% numbers put study USC California later shown credible.

You second question think estimated things Houston spreading 0.1-0.2% week population.  capacity probably think much take. assume need 60% population infected heard immunity, looking something like 60/.2 = 300 weeks, 5 years. think anyone would agree current situation sustainable 5 years. appear playbook, exactly. villain. He’s like chubby Snidely Whiplash Can't wait pictures year lol. both. Rebel inaccurate descriptor. work delivering smaller companies asking solutions shut office. think it’ll flow bigger companies 100% time 100% people. Especially since virus mutated now. It’s going spread. It’s virus. keep hospitals overloaded do. bought house may $289,000 2.75% APR, $1567 month (with PMI). 2400 sqft, 2 car garage, 1/4 acre, asphalt drive way, remodeled kitchen etc (pretty nice).

I already anticipated market crashing like ""we waited etc"", market crashes...

Big investing companies buy properties mass, rent out, since rate rent really go down. demand housing changed, afford keep has.

So first year, yeah, it'll investers buying frenzy everywhere.

Then.. demand houses sky rocket things recover, they're rentals... They're much market buy right, rent. demand houses go house end worth $350-$400+ k paid $289k two-three years prior. 


If trend continues, 200k, we'll refinance conventional 15 years much lower interest rate pay 5+ years early. Again, don’t disagree you. know firsthand least 10 people consistently say “idk polling ain’t me.” mindset prevalent area. 150,000 people dead

that's past 5 months... still got 6+ months 'til new president gets inaugurated..... granted much better treating disease now, comforting say least... I’d prefer nothing. community already tools. Downvote, hide, block. Herd immunity doesnt work antibodies last acouple months. wouldnt flu every year wonder havoc SF housing market.

If could move SF even one year - would save thousands dollars. I'm sorry. Jfc. Ah course, big muscles=dumb angry. Glad still clinging outdated stereotypes. Two actually. confirmed happened players team self isolate entering bubble spread rest teams. two left cases.  guess large companies July basically takes care school year. person school happen Fall 21, they’ll start bringing people back.

But parents knowing arrangements may suddenly need mid school year would quite stressful.   could start revolution eating rich What's justification much time online...?

Are ""mission critical"" ops type position? Spain asked come. economy done without them. Well bad thing itself, ways choose react bad thing causes bad things. fair argument make. always pro-vaccines general, it'll tough trust something rushed market pharmaceutical companies seeing dollar signs administered government wants everything go back normal ASAP. I'll bet Trump exerting pressure order something October November claim ""curing Chinese flu"" political win election.

I'm young, healthy, would definitely fine catch COVID, taking something unknown consequences avoid make much sense. Obviously there's herd immunity considerations worry about, I'd much happier WFH thing got better. Jesus absolutely one understands socialism country. They're pretty much compete opposite sides spectrum *by design*. Hitler literally hated socialism much redefined purposes. bewildering idea we're transitioning socialism fascism one fell swoop. happened under... Trump, too. Nevada definitely going hit hardest. help Nevada unemployment took literal months give unemployed people financial assistance. Basic reading ability helps enjoy agreeing initially asking clarification details. 

And asking clarification. Really drill-down. Get nitty-gritty. Find heart it. 

Once get point realizing they're launch full-on Blood Libel moment, get see really are. switch? Interesting situation. wife received positive test result Saturday, day started showing symptoms (loss taste smell). got tested today came back negative. contact positive case week prior showing symptoms.

Anyone similar experience? find hard believe contracted her, may understand contagious window disease. close contact last 9 days. Damn wish worked google would assume testing goods types viruses. Remember though virus breaks days surfaces (so goods Atlanta probably untouched potential contaminated person couple days already, even person unloading infected, he's touching every part unless he's sneezing it. part surface hit direct sunlight also inactivate virus quickly, too.

Once artillery comes out, there's little chance anyone able de-escalate situation. went labcorp today get antibody test told 1-3 business days. anyone done test actually got results back quick.

Fast food ends necessity I'm traveling, I've given Mcdonalds salads I've throw wilted lettuce cherry tomatoes tasted like verge fermentation. (And people live infamous ""food deserts"", travel food options everyday food options.) Big differences are: way less people, nobody travelling, actually proper bubble two hubs, Canada burning ground. wonder many members Black Voices Trump has. Well, fingers crossed, anyway. Overall, feel like we're enough, still hopeful maybe enough individuals enough collectively independently make difference.  Texas' deaths per 100k people 18. California's 21. Florida's 27.

The thing India spread limited major cities only. 
trave locations blocked public. Yeah agreed. Walmart terrible company many areas among options that's accessible affordable. Also want point out, people stood filmed assholes also Walmart shoppers themselves. healthy diet expensive one

There's tons healthy items also extremely cheap. Dollar stores often great way get spices similar cooking ingredients lower price. Store brand frozen vegetables typically around 25 cents per serving. Walmart sells potatoes around 32 cents per pound. also sell tofu blocks $1.44. comes 28.8 cents per serving delivering 7 grams protein. dry black beans get little gram protein per penny. single serving coming 8 cents. Brown rice even beats six cents per serving walmart. Eggs somewhere around dime per individual egg. gives huge amount work with. 

And yes, time factor. require stove freezer. one fairly easy combine weeks worth meals single relatively quick prep session freezing everything reheat later. another talking point guy's kind using (think r-w'ers). Anything discredit Fauci dear leader. Possibly - slightly high (140/90) BP checked last christmas, got bloodwork taken back end april make sure keto-diet depriving needed vitamins (I'm picky eater, part issue food), I'll something compare get done around christmas...

I’m sure there’s good programmers India countries, odds don’t save much hiring competent ones.

Ding ding ding. That's exactly works. Companies outsource India lured pretty powerpoint presentations promise huge savings, CTOs want outsourcing project checklist makes desirable. truth get pay for. want pay little possible, get little possible return. 

If want hire competent people, pay enough them. sure, cheaper local, except deal number issues, importantly cultural differences (also time zone difference turnover). successful transition outsourcing India requires layer people outsourced teams company, people experience dealing Indians. guess what, people expertise necessary cultural experience cost lot.

In end, either pay jack shit whatever service suffers tremendously it, costing shitton money long run, end spending similar budget getting decent quality return, stack issues manage. 

Source: years experience managing outsourced outsourcing projects several Fortune 500 companies. Happily back tech side things past 6 years, fuck management struggle. ton parallels 1918 pandemic this. President denying problem forcing businesses open. large contingent anti mask people. It’s astounding. bright side, seems people worse late. many idiots 1918.

A better public health solution would look like Venn diagram different concurrent approaches, working tandem allow healthcare function, marketplaces run, schools function safely, etc.

Rather shitshow USA due Freedom Life. people need reassess values. .3% generous depending source. looks like NHL one chance work... people think sign everything's magically ""getting better"".

It's people happy see it, usually they're happy see absurdity irresponsibility follows even slightly good news. everyone wants people keep commuting work. think much economy relies people commuting work working home 8 hours day. depends team sport.

I think hockey going well. 4 “bubbles” keep guys virus free. Plus, it’s Canada. think players treated well paid circus animals moment (leave game, back room) meh, make millions.

The MLB’s plan set fail. think NHL well. think COVID opened major opportunity business everywhere, employees work home. always option feasible. shat yourself, would like point me, literal commun-ist, place I've said this? think biggest mistake lot people think there's kind linear correlation hard lockdown fast virus spread, appear true. humans want control, want know Someone Something fix this.

Sweden high mortality, light lockdown. UK equally high mortality, even though locked down? Connecticut double mortality Sweden, even though locked down? lockdowns successful, others seem anything?

Clearly stronger unknown factors work here.

However, think lockdown LA something, clearly curbed growth. bought time, bought couple months. problem no-one seems idea time bought. shame took pandemic convince companies allow employees spend time families holiday. Scotland excess deaths weeks 12-29 931/million. England excess deaths weeks 12-28 923/million. Source: makes sense hires going forward. Applied retroactively, company actually penalizing someone choosing live someplace else. I'm god's gift (far it), company me. hiring contract, legal, still shitty. Otherwise, biased pay cut. Hardest whoosh I've seen while. think hit nail head. real reasonable alternative (or least one know of). American politics, right now, feels like 2 options: hard left hard right. Nothing centre. Nothing sensible. 2 polar opposite ideologies resemble fanaticism governance philosophy. 
Clearly need reforming society states. Especially culturally. racism states real honest conversation society it. side, feel solution focus historical retribution (as I've seen news laws proposed give financial reparations slavery). Focusing past never worked history. Never!

I agree honest discussion history (not states), goal discussion general improvement society (again, regardless gender, race, nationality etc). blame MLB players, professional sports league, positive tests determined wether play not.

MLB season cancelled four days.

For professional athletes especially disaster. long term effects minor case end career. much time compete earn athlete. sit plague year difficult choice.

For Olympic athletes even worse. Skip Olympics 8 year span two. athletes peak 14 15 years old. next Olympics over. late homie. 15 years behind. Plenty places tourist trap resort towns still cheap, though. Gonna zero cases day now. Trump said so. think retailers online year, good. honestly stop going stores Halloween New Years Day is. buy online really want something is.... risk long term organ damage infecting people? risk affect you. dumbest thing americans lying government actually done decent job handling this. arent even reporting cases anymore.

Shit's illegal bro. shows deadly Civil War was. population North stood 18.5 million... dumb statement! banning travel stop backflow cases. virus control country. Ban international flights get new virus clusters risk second wave. common sense. Yes remember catch ten times cases extensive testing. still long way go get situation early March. it? think fine people legally handguns, rifles, shotguns, like. long they're registered proper training. Never say guns bad. problem people, like yourself, immediately jump ""Mah 2nd amendment! bill rights!

So, keep simple outlook life. Continue watching Fox News. But, South rise again.

Canadian get issue wearing them. wife went grocery shopping yesterday around 9am, mandatory masks mandates government let alone individual stores. 

Yet I'd say least 40% people store wore masks wife included. Staff choice individuals tell people wear ostracized others don't, weird looks non maskers confrontations anyone.

We community sacrifices made keep virus check honestly slight inconvenience wearing masks completely outweigh consequences don't. really hope good folks south get handle next cold flu season... really do. Oh, that’s definitely right move! taken guard whole situation, probably would done same. Unfortunately, combination surprise, instinct, social awkwardness led shake hands stuck me. also sitting table restaurant (people joined table initially two us), didn’t really anywhere go....I lean far back seat could. thought going friend’s house low key pizza night (miscommunication ends) definitely would declined invite known we’d busy area people didn’t know. feel really dumb putting situation first place.

You: funded prevention Trump.

If hospitals overwhelmed, means everyone cannot get access care including people without COVID dead it.

If stagger cases, able resume care even lockdown much manageable.

It's kind like time management. break chunks much easier. Yes, always deaths. Yes, lockdown sucks. get manageable numbers. keep going is, there's going even collateral.

True polio, pandemic bigger deal

I comfortably arguing polio bigger deal pandemic happened Obama. suddenly Alabama Found hero Got keep $ Rollin cost think might want brush protective role antibodies SARS-CoV-2 unknown, antibodies usually reasonable correlate antiviral immunity, anti–receptor-binding domain antibody levels correspond plasma viral neutralizing activity. Given early antibody decay acute viral antigenic exposure approximately exponential,3 found antibody loss quicker reported SARS-CoV-1,4,5 findings consistent Long et al.1 findings raise concern humoral immunity SARS-CoV-2 may long lasting persons mild illness, compose majority persons Covid-19. difficult extrapolate beyond observation period approximately 90 days likely decay decelerate.3 Still, results call caution regarding antibody-based “immunity passports,” herd immunity, perhaps vaccine durability, especially light short-lived immunity common human experts field say paper SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

The idea antibodies don’t matter flatly wrong. Scientists look antibody levels reason.  certain antibodies correlate immunity,

Similar tests done SARS antibodies good proxy.

Yes, person without antibodies probably fight new infection covid easily memory cells, also spread it.

Yeah, great story parties. say used use ""We'll never get lost woods unless want to"" selling point dating, though. Jury still effective was. :)

Yes, carry radios. Communications bit tricky situation one tech folks spend lot time thinking - personally, I've found radio communications bit spotty cell phone reception closer areas cover (and, also, avoids risk someone finding something bad might happened loved one overhearing someone's radio), possible drop repeaters peaks required. state process standardizing SAR frequencies moment, that's point radio - able good communications task field, regardless original team, pretty important. We're also lucky enough also issued fancy P25 radios (think newer digital systems law enforcement uses) local office emergency management. They're amazing radios, couple thousand per radio, bit expensive us outfit entire team with.

In terms we're dispatched, team specifically dispatched one four ways: either directly county police dispatch country headquarters located (other counties states call request us), state police, national parks service, regional search rescue councils we're part of. 

This true every SAR team there, though. know self-dispatch. state police tend frown things like - capable search managers identify types search resources required request needed. Also, liability insurance carriers really want something like (and covered worker's comp insurance whoever report that, think). extremely controversial observation mayor Las Vegas would strongly dispute. anecdotal evidence justifies supporting hate bigotry entire group people? tolerant progressive you. eating dollar store popcorn watching. need completely separate hospital Covid patients safely treat people.

No don’t. wife neighbor physicians two major hospital systems seen relatively high levels staff catch coronavirus. hospitals 99% community spread, iatrogenic. Hospitals routinely treat infectious disease far deadly communicable without incident.

Wow, people must really love hearing shit music. two us, closer spreading misinformation me. said there's consensus lasting damages. You, hand, said there's ""very large % serious lifelong health damage"" disproven sources. 

One sources talks lung heart damage observed 12% HOSPITALIZED covid cases. First all, small proportions cases bad enough require hospitalization. currently estimate 20%, that's also based case data actually have, know moderately extremely lowballed. even high 20%, that's still 12% 20%, 2.5%. according source, 2.5% cases may result long term damage. even close ""very large percent"". also worth noting 6 months ago, quite lot better treating virus today then. accounts, real number almost surely significantly lower 2.5%. 

Your second source says know whether damage discusses permanent. 77% number quoted ground glass opacities, yes that's lung abnormality generally found healthy lungs, GGOs general often major issues usually heal time. source alludes saying ""don't always heal"" negative way saying truth, generally heal. 

Neither sources come even close proving statement there's ""very large % serious lifelong health damage"". One directly demonstrates low % (with contextual implications even lower that), states multiple times know sure truth longterm effects still unclear. one spreading misinformation. think alone. work 100% home. lot collaborations works (you need least 4-5 persons 1 project.

First months fun, everyone upset someone small mistake answer call people think working hard.

In addition, deadlines, half team ia extra push way easier ""leave"" early work home compared leaving office ""abandoning"" co-workers.

It's also way harder disconnect work. One lobby video games, gaming room office (I'm lucky enough entire room office complain...). want disconnect work play games friends, go back... office!

""Couple insisted getting covid wedding. "" well fuck GoFundMe take fund refund donors. kidding. 1000+ Karma points bigotry prejudice entire group people. Wow left sickening days. They're supposed party tolerance acceptance, yet pat back disparaging huge groups people ignorant.  happens states depend specific taxes fund governments. Nashville nightlife associated taxes likely supports huge chunk budget. Take away left gigantic hole can't recuperate.

“Every week brings new crowd potential set new problems far exposure control.”

A mask wasn’t typically seen lifeguard’s garb – now.

Many people across nation asked wear masks socially distance inside workplace coronavirus outbreak. And, lifeguard’s workplace beach – space seemingly subjective risk level – they, too, risk infected infecting others and, it, facing many expectations.

David Vaughan, South Walton Beach Director [**South Walton Fire District Station explained why.

“Even pandemic economic crisis we’re going through, we’re seeing comparable numbers 2018 2019 beach summer,” Vaughan said. “It literally business usual. means thousands visitors every week – whatever degrees taking seriously heeding message beach safety social distancing. try provide service protect guards. It’s cycle potential exposures. Every week brings new crowd potential set new problems far exposure control.”

South Walton Fire District Station 3 provided lifeguards ample personal protective equipment includes mask gloves, Vaughan said.

“Any type patient contact, they’re required wear masks,” Vaughan said. “We’re encouraging wear masks times, we’re requiring wear times.”

Masks water don’t mix though. run issues guideline conducting water rescue operations, said.

“In cases, conduct business usual potential exposure reporting monitor guards made patient contact,” Vaughan said. “We don’t use PPE conduct water rescue. can’t wear paper mask you’re water rescue. People trying come solutions across industry, best knowledge, that’s breakdown.”

And that’s Vaughan wants locals vacationers part preventative measures.

 

“The method we’re trying emphasize people red flags double red flags makes much germane keep beach safety warnings flag system,” Vaughan said. “Listen lifeguards they’re telling put others risk. beaches open panhandle, we’re grateful fact job right now. asking people respect personnel.”

Social distancing changes procedures, too.

Isaiah Boyd, beach safety officer – new position lifeguards supervisors –said limited public interaction.

“That includes pulling towers back beach less interaction public coming down,” Boyd said. “We try stay away boardwalks lot traffic.

“We’re used close, personal interactions, we’ve resort bullhorns spread messages using lot whistling – trying maintain social distancing beach normal preventative messaging interactions,” Vaughan said.

The lifeguards also undergo health checks every morning, Boyd said.

The District send lifeguards home potential exposures self-reported potential exposures, Vaughan said.

 

“I’m happy say none guards come back tested positive,” Vaughan said interview Thursday. “We haven’t contact tracing required significant loss work force. always subject change.”

The lifeguards also become diligent cleaning procedures, Vaughan said. armed COVID-19 specific cleaning agents use deep clean vehicles beginning end day periodically shifts.

They also wipe lifeguard towers.

“We leave towers overnight,” Vaughan said. “Unlike Pensacola, they’re covered, lockable shack type towers; they’re aluminum frame towers sit beach. know public access overnight. We’ve incidences vandalism, theft towers.”

One biggest adjustments beach wheelchair service. Before, person could go one five wheelchair accessible regional beach accesses request assistance lifeguard parking lot, boardwalk position comfort beach within 100 meters lifeguard tower, said. ready leave, lifeguard maintained control, grabbing wheelchair helping back parking lot vehicle, said.

“To continue provide beach wheelchair service, we’ve resort lend wheelchair instead lifeguard controlling that’s liability issue,” Vaughan said. “Immediately return – don’t mean insult anyone – wipe next person use it.”

Beach Safety Division Chief Rich Huffnagle thinks working outdoors gives lifeguards advantage people work hospital emergency medical services setting terms preventative measures, said. He, too, said masks mandated patient contact.

 

“For lifeguarding, it’s big issue inside,” Huffnagle said. “The thing is, course, can’t wear masks water. that’s we’re doing. may change, right now, follow CDC guidelines. part they’re patrol, stay 6 feet apart people.”

In terms extra sanitation measures, thinks “open air environment” helps.

“They wash rigs everyday anyway,” Huffnagle said. “The ATVs bring beach washed daily come beach.”

The majority beachgoers comply social distancing now, too, said.

“You see families together, see lot less big crowd congregations beach,” Huffnagle said. “For part, groups staying distanced other.” Biden far lesser two evils agree probably get huge systemic change him. think changing senate much important right that. get trump changing senate would almost bad.

I think generally things like previous comment kind dangerous convincing people election matter Biden bad. Again, think Biden dramatically transformative candidate we've proven need, think he's highly electable, probably important right now. think sanders would gotten lot cross votes Biden can. needed get trump out, current priority #1. guess good programmers YouTube tutorials instead working place then. least Texas gets credit corrections. feel like number states leave official counts reflect high number pneumonia deaths time. see corrections anytime soon. Surely hand full people erroneously notified account record number cases. ""Don't make turn plane around little shits!"" TN, GA, FL contending worst governor award. Mulroy said employees novelty stand self-quarantining since grandfather tested positive. said due guidance Lincoln Speedway, ""they close grandfather understand risk.""  
  Anyone attending races Lincoln Speedway, including vendors, required sign waiver accepting health risks attending large event since track reopened end May.  state restrictions due coronavirus pandemic, outdoor gatherings Pennsylvania limited 250 less people. state requiring individuals wear masks ""any indoor spaces outdoor spaces people unable follow social distancing."" People may fined comply.  
  asked majority fans attending races wearing masks, said ""the ones want are, ones want don't"" declined comment further.  
  asked races Lincoln 250 fans attendance, Parrish also declined comment. could easily say global deaths overcounted.

And I’d argue you’re wrong. Regardless, that’s exactly included US data. you’re conveniently ignoring. also ignored point smoking bans, Many people would died soon anyway

That’s psycho logic. Easy say people. Harder it’s you, people love. seriously hope work nowhere near public Mortality rates already back normal world.

Nobody learns kind thing unless they're looking though. Places like Arizona, Texas, Florida willfully jumped cliff following selfish, inept, ignorant leaders.

Not disagreeing states, California also really bad outbreak right now. 
 
Conservatives point California's outbreak, liberals point Texas, Florida, Arizona outbreaks.   
 
It productive conversation.  Instead united fight pandemic, America divided arguing leaders worse.  reality Republicans Democrats, failed. need neoliberalism capitalism save country. Temporarily need able get everyone tested every week test positive stay home month get sent food money.

unlikely. someone really say every comment. Like get it, hate God, stop trying ruin others’ days. agree. shall continue inadvertent lifelong boycott Ralph's.  Masks perverts criminals, considering neither, I'm never wearing one again. wearing masks distancing problem? Yes post screenshots show stupid really is! right along, know?? Everyone finally see, PROOF smart time Filthy Jedi scum! ralph employees held higher standard police since ralph employees essential workers get full hazmat suit? Preprints research want get quickly use general population (hopefully). scientist, I’m fence practice useful. 

Normally, peer review happens scientist submits paper scientific journal usually entails paper sent journal scientists confidentially evaluate methodology article whole. provide comments journal (if some, almost always do). journal decides reject paper outright (they also peer review well think isn’t good study doesn’t fit scope journal), original authors need make changes, article published. 

As imagine, peer review important takes longer getting article immediately done preprints. So, preprints need warning tell readers article “rushed”, will, still needs undergo peer review (i.e., non biased/partially blinded evaluation scientists). article discusses droplets , distances, time air, bioaeorsol, discusses 6 foot rule close (especially someone unmasked). 4.5 meters better distance, sneezes much farther.

Any indoor area infected masked, risk infections based time exposed, airflow, lack ventilation, quality ppe mask eyewear, etc. 

Unmasked, One sneeze multiple coughs + talking get it, although good ppe gear reasonably protect you. Oh problem go fund mes general ! Ive donated friends medical emergencies! guy doesent deserve ignored advice Wait, UK HIGH ranked testing now? That's hell turnaround. That's fair, factually American think important thing remember weekends usually severe lull reporting. Happens every weekend ignore much evidence contrary 1. thing gender pay gap. kidding think is.
2. capitalist country, illegal pay differently based gender, race, sexuality etc.
3. reason difference (ON AVERAGE) men choose different jobs, likely ask raises, likely take risks. Women (ON AVERAGE) choose lower-paying jobs saty home look kids. Yeah.

At least long time. made bed, they'll lie right higher right live.

lol what

rights arent kind heirarchy. There's never one right always placed all, deductively constitutional amendments, freedom government restriction is.

Yes, rights balance public vs private interest. wrong dont know say profits productivity drop 20% clearly problem crazy high costs software engineering. Fire US programmers hire cheap indian consultants. Literally every place ever worked dollar amount employment contract. Pay ""indexed region"", hard fast number ""pay may change based on"" excuses attached. salaries *offer* may indexed region, new hire Iowa may get less new hire California. current employees salary taken away move? never seen this.

Where's line? live someplace could literally halve living expenses moving town half hour's drive away. did, would Fortune 50 employer right cut salary since living expenses expenses much cheaper? also get tell place currently live expensive, move town 45 minutes away cost living cheaper?

Again, everyone quick make excuses company makes literally money stealing personal data reselling it? gay republican holding true values, says lot guess. Yeah right course going get preferential treatment. really think they’d treat like normal 78 year old? probably private room view held Closer Something like 100k small businesses already shuttered good: estimates could lose half small businesses. *looks awkwardly Nascar first ""sport"" come back* Weird way spell traitors  
Both countries need re-frame obesity epidemic national security issue

Lol, like I'm rereading trying figure found much? feel like read tone type in. meant neutral tone, sorry comes across abrasive. rich able stay home limit exposure... They're also able afford high quality health care. rich people die this? Sure will. numbers showing poor suffering more. cruel counterproductive, republican. like time, Clever! Fauci also said he's hoping vaccine 70-75% effective, so, people get they've vaccinated, and, long combination vaccines continued restrictions get us place COVID dominating every facet society economy. mentally ill and/or homeless people, addicts, flock places like that.

Add ""Florida shuffle"", scam lure addicts Florida (and warm climate areas) widespread Wikipedia lack basic medical knowledge utterly horrifying yet keep commenting complete nonsense. know nothing all.... Gotcha, worries. also replied phone without knowing exactly comment mine replying thread. Masks absolutely something mandated. meant comment generally people fine accepting whatever ""authority"" presents them, without investigating merits information. masks, yes masks conspiracy. Anyone thinks much absolute moron. First need understand behavior political beliefs aren’t based logic fact. think lockdown policies exacerbate poverty, starvation, death far coronavirus pandemic. say want sacrifice people coronavirus, point advocating lockdown, sacrificing people certain people live. saving lives aggregate; passing death along marginalized people. 

You seem engaging points I'm making, I'm sure value continuing one-sided conversation, say know think one lockdown, time it'll work. What's definition insanity attributed Einstein?

California one strictest lockdowns America unable slow case growth entire time.

Speaking truth. distant cousin works fancy wallstreet firm derivatives trading, along pretty much traded (no pun intended) potential family life $$$$$$. Saying tinge jealousy though, we're similar age guy already owns Porsche living Tribeca studio (the floor ceiling window, view manhattan, doorman sort). He's nice guy though, lets stay free studio whenever i'm town business vacations. I’m aware Texas far done phase outbreak (I’m Europe thank god). 

I’m guessing 15-20k deaths Texas back single deaths/day. that’s I’m talking about: response poor, that’s yet obvious number deaths since 5k/30M doesn’t even require crappy handling pandemic. Spokane here, thing neighbors 😒 misread ""Doused"" thought well sounds like weird way deliver vaccine disgusting. right endanger community. soccer people play whole game masks on? definitely requires breathing baseball. really excuse guys wearing masks, MLB seem prepared ALL. Arguing money summer plan virus.  Good bot. like women like like Coronavirus antibodies costs come from?

You get letter. We're suing you. Ok fine. what? basically ignore trial provide something? Speaking centrist, Democrats much better

Edit: claim centrist officially I'm apolitical. Politics general shit thing discuss America needs abolish shite system Trump level hague stealth bombers battleships something him, Bolsonaro stealth bombers battleships thus can't force hague back down. Well blame government Dominican Republic . closed late elections late March . It’s shit show ever since . week re-closed see videos last week closing . Shitshow I've seen overall, seemed focused patients, COVID-19, lockdowns case, things like working water breaks helping too. think study exclusively talking areas uncontrolled local transmission things basically back normal life. statement sums feeling quite sometime. Thank verbalizing thoughts. interesting thing they're still reporting death certificates CDC, stall tactic anyway. death certificates might show COVID, might not, unless completely stop issuing death certificates able hide ""excess deaths"", CDC tracking months anyway.

I'm going watching stat pretty closely states getting hammered right largely South.

Interestingly, could see could used long-game generate Trump talking points. kept saying ""test less"" numbers would better. bet we'll see play regardless testing. Report less &amp; numbers look better. somebody even partially functioning brain points real deaths way higher, Trump say, ""The thing true countries"" make comparison official numbers New York California vs. Texas. point actually dig stats bit understand that's dumb comparison, lie stick regardless ~~expert~~ nerd says. Staying home doesn’t make end. stage USA isn’t going happen honestly countries. Honestly people home means you’ll hit herd immunity threshold faster it’s “over”. lots people die get vaccine soon compared would’ve happened locked  embarrassed California want, least give world Donald Trump Hey, Trump say virus would disappear summertime.... We’ll agree disagree. Unless two like ‘stepbro/stepsis’ tight, think you’re way base. 

Either way. stay there, he’s wanted. Orlando maybe two weeks low tourism... it’s packed idiot tourists now. Short time? pretty steady 4 year dive. swear amount betting website i've gotten getting reported ....

is part algorithm ? probably administration defiant. get wrong, I'm sure numbers good, doubt they're much worse last time. see decrease taken serious measures control it. nation-wide coordination planning. testing, identifying, isolating contact tracing. require masks social distancing, minimize non essential activities. US, wildly control completely chaotic response. state trying figure whatever hell want. Supplies (including tests) hoarded even scalped. disaster leadership. Thank real feedback. didn’t work hand sanitizers enough original plan. Everyone else managed call crazy. friends recommend goggles wear invest pairs myself. mean, ok, sure. share Walmart cashiers starving children Somalia? you’re going arbitrarily say money person X generates much them, give person deserve create, arbitrary like  2020 playing like origin story every episode first season sliders. point truly believe meteor would cause mass extinction heading towards Earth Americans would still find way politicize it. mother-in-laws “quarantining” included visiting random hotels around state 20 closest friends planning cruise later year. insisted sending kid daycare part time didn’t want “all germs.” She’s carrying “all germs” don’t weeks covered. It’s frustrating. Containing work people still moving around. HEY PATRICK Tennessee ""We knew getting into""

This placed next names, attempt admitted hospital. well-said. impacts easily measured numbers negative ones reopening soon people ignoring dangers. mean positive impact people show respect value life real. mean don’t care bad sounds it’s damn truth I'd like throw shout-out Governor Tom Wolf keeping us near bottom list Pennsylvania. case it? This.

But America another level this. gun available time, also culture around want Gemany establish.

Imagine feel need post picture guns placed around newborn child, weapons wedding picture. 

At point time think culture around weapons much problem available angry depressed scared. culture makes think weapons solution problems first. Boris speaking Africa: ""The problem charge, charge more."" want breakfast. Man Falling Down. Fight like man felt need crank money siphon 60 past 4 decades beyond me. really, doctor got awarded. Check source. escalated quickly One simple trick! know don’t trust public schools anymore. Flu season lasts 13 weeks... Covid took six months match death toll. recirculate, constantly bringing new air outside. I've read 50/50 mix recirculated air filtered. That's reason think would better room building people. incredibly well ventilated. It’s impressive found 30k Americans weren’t anti-vaxers Oh correctly people see either nose exposed wear chin. pull breathe every minutes I'm Rochester-area native living west coast jealous you. Trader Joe's *almost* decent substitute Wegmans, covid line get always half hour long every grocery store SoCal garbage. that’s fucking infuriating Good way putting it, ty. Sucks part Australia. live WA everything almost back normal Flu. look Y/Y ""increase"" pneumonia deaths too. increase correlates exactly start pandemic. We're talking least hundred thousand US alone official.

It's stretch think novel virus confusing doctors. would making progress all? Horses still horse things. Lawyers jobs can’t chase ambulances chase supermarkets scam emoji beans!? hell people trying politicize face masks? Wear mask stay home, choice. See infringe freedom all, dumbasses. general agree, bet guy goes OK gamble. informed consent process look like?

A health care worker absolutely walk process, risks, let know supported encounter risk, etc. This. this.
I've seen said people part beginning usually ones work group project, too.  axe glad l virtual. However, get 1st grader sit computer day. Many clubs ""club owned"" guns use training novices.

When wife first applied got first class treatment. paper work could show ownership papers revolver intended import, showed owned gun rather long time.

The reason import teach wife shoot, compete medals prove active competitor. twice Canadian Jr. Champion, events ""junior"" events allowed shoot adults.

My wife quite easy, never held sort gun hands, ever. required take safety course directly supervised shooting, usually men club realized actually better were. hope.......... No. real concern pepper spray want. impossible know believe engage brain use critical thinking. Obviously use word it’s terrible **outcome** *compared countries similar size*. think obvious phrasing. 

That’s say death isn’t terrible. That’s something completely different.

The response Texas officials authorities may bad, number 5k per 30M (yet) shows it’s bad. Places “good” responses seen worse results that.
What’s currently bad Texas it’s means over, even first wave. like 300-400 million guns America. What's difference point? gun deaths Chicago 100% preventable? people hours cut anyway. I’d rather help everyone potentially leave someone behind 100 percent agree though also dont need store ammo weapon place. F Also lonely old folks died home apartments still found yet. good thing guns protected people! Thank God 🇺🇸 No, fools go underground build incompetent network spreads sorts illnesses quietly throughout society.

We actually need exact opposite talking about. Force fools access best care available. #ScienceFail Surely see they'd feel way though. Someone warned nonstop months something knowingly claiming know they're getting into. they're taking beds resources people actively seek virus. top they're risking health medical workers taking care making much harder everyone else get medical care. think someone cast street idiot certainly understand people numb self induced suffering. mean, telling person it’s fault need find hobby really isn’t fair either. Sometimes conversation giving concrete solutions instead listening relating. Introverts/ambiverts like problem shutting computer long periods it’s different people. It’s likely isolated hobbies don’t work nearly effective social hobbies people like this. They’ll find alternatives bored, doesn’t mean alternatives/hobbies necessarily make feel fulfilled person afterward.  Cops busy beating peaceful protestors. immune compromised driving long distance, would consider making bathroom stops hardware stores like Lowe's Home Depot. always seem deserted spotless. Like everyone forgets need poop hardware store.

I've stopped driving dog they're dog friendly come worry misguided person smashing car windows ""save"" her. Still gotta vote. Biden pulled leftwards increasingly progressive base. Like COVID-19, flu cases symptoms. severe mild. asymptomatic flu cases well. learned Jiu Jitsu basically 100% defensive.
Some stuff learned actually pretty funny pull someone yeah best weapons running.

Nigerundayo smokey! infinite number points ""can't even gun sport"" ""multiple people sitting given restaurant likely carrying guns."" prefer right gun, transport must locked case home gun range. simply need carrying gun property reason, legal consequences anything happens massive.

A guy US shot walking towards car rammed protestors. open-carrying semi-automatic (legally, far know). cops let guy ""standing ground"" even issued statement murder victim ""went looking fight found it."" apparently open-carrying makes fair game murdered, even pro-gun jurisdictions. ridiculous false right twisted - cops stop legal gun, dead. get kind argument gun, dead. Might well shoot everyone sight case. Insurance make 100% whole deductibles rate goes up. one eat financial loss due violent destructive crime. 

Also, great ignored points. Guess tell transgender friend works Marcellas got jumped coming home people believe right legally carry pistol defense taking safety courses going background checks. men attack group, fight gets beat shit gun, that's win eyes.

Your ideas defend bigotry hate people say this. know, find really sad. Trump spent last 4 years trying get rid anything everything Obama presidency. Except detention camps. Apparently that’s one thing thinks Obama right. Majority black patrons bar. watch video? way equivalent, many reasons. starters, banning substance similar shutting society. true! I've shot woods asshole trying intimidate me. scary AF too.

However, never get draw quickly enough someone advancing knife less 20 feet away. get stabbed lot get shot off. Yeah I'm kind guessing folks may lot underlying health conditions. imagine asymptomatic people. Time another revival pray intubated. Pass cup around folks...! Similar thing happened AIDS. Reagan said ""those boys brought themselves"", pal Rock Hudson died it, problem.

There's chapter one Michael Moore's books gives prayer everyone say prays politicians families struck disease (and problems endemic America) way politicians actually give shit social issues, directly affects them.

It sounds cruel, rare highly dangerous condition, someone close president one cabinet getting condition could best thing ever happens you.

Always found interesting concept. say America country suffers that? Reading comprehension issue you. Quote said America suffers issues.

America lot class, race sex issues exist safer countries like Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, etc robust safety nets militarized classist racist drug war prison industrial complex creates poverty crime. Weed legal Netherlands. many people get criminal records become poor result, leads crime. countries also homogenous many divisions formed along racial lines America going back centuries causes much poverty drives crime. Usually means enough testing too. did, went mexico last week... made nearly 6 figures laid off.. mortgage jumped 2500/mo 3100/mo May. less 5k bank now. make much money extended time, expenses start increase dont see pandemic horizon.

I feel sick.  “Most Americans”

I hope case media amplifying crazies. 

I think Americans actually understand fat kill sooner reduce quality life. lines advocating fitness shaming obese blurred. controversial speak topic general.

I promise we’re stupid. reasonable American make good evening news. Afaik Texas legal carry bar. really hard testing safely. 

1) EVERYONE WEARS MASK TIMES. fucking ridiculous people get this.

2) Keep students 6ft apart.

3) Keep numbers rooms down. 

4) Open doors windows possible.

The problem ACT (and SAT) want spend money deal this. already lost bunch money canceled tests spring summer, hiring training proctors would cost money.

Billion dollar corporations really fucking suck. Eviction moratorium without mortgage extension (not freeze pause bullshit makes pay everything back front end once) going force lot landlords sell. see one hell real estate price dump. American mentality + legal assault rifles = world laughing despairing time. would dragged store. That's total cases. Florida beating NY active cases weeks. look state country Florida would 3rd world active cases. beaten Brazil India 10.5 69 times population Florida. people think highly themselves. wish could up-vote 100 times. sick entitled weirdos.

Meanwhile, here's latest case/death charts Texas, running 7-day curves like that, wonder people fearful idiots. Knockouts shit hole bar Louisianians evacuate, get cosplay plague rats? model may fucking us situations like this. dont even act ONE country lot time. state like country governors power states defy presidents...what point ONE country? O.o  teacher idea answer this! developmentally appropriate young child learning computer day. can't wait safe schools reopen! hate this, still know distance learning right thing now. feel parents young kids. would say take lots breaks. Computer lesson, build blocks, computer activity, drawing, on. Read them, lot! Fingers crossed vaccine good treatment. Right, I'm sure International Criminal Court friggin Hague know genocide is. Americans lack self-discipline feel way. slight lifestyle ""feels like forever"". live instant gratification lack buckle get things happening actually missed resignation. True, U.K., but, things happening world, leader opposition U.K. resigning mind. Thanks clarification. 

Also, avoid Google much possible. One time last summer Tony Blair PM. enough beds person gets turned away, mean counted?

Not trying snarky, serious question. cops bad, especially whichever bastard cop related close to. Wait puerto rico USA? americans protesting americans? problem packed strangers bicycle day long there’s appropriate music focus good percentage others celebrating similarly. 👽 Exactly, believe fairness, that's exactly minimum wage bad idea, takes power away employees. Without it, provides self interest workers employers. sub shop road starts paying $13 hour, may lose workers shop pay $12, means worker go owner say ""hey, sub shop B paying $13, want $14 I'm leaving."" Eventually sub shop chose paying shutting down. want protect livelihood staying open, worker wants protect getting paid best wage can. minimum wage reason increase pay every shop paying $12 dollars, never worry shop street doing, dont worry employee finding paying more.

The ""people selfish government create fairness"" argument propagated politically privileged quells looking fucked system government created. appeases poverty making feel like part group working interests thus need work system individual level think someone power them.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: grammar couple sentences Every major European country hit way NYC though; hit hard, lost control regained it. stories unbridled success here.

Florida, Arizona, Texas etc. even attempted control situation meaningful degree well late.... something even benefit time makes decisions atrocious. ~~was~~ fat"" eat cafeteria, go church, hit bar occasionally, visit mom dad, girlfriend, etc. Even bubble, possible, would bust quickly Oppression? telling get speed ticket that's another sign oppression too.

Wake there's global pandemic going on, need wear mask. Again... know doctors do? hey wear mask? Again, medical workers wrong wear protesting masks working?
Answer questions.

What talking about? country hospitals full people respiratory problems could help everyone. Even healthy individuals died 30ies!

For me? me? expert subject! epidemiologist, dedicated life knows epidemiology sure. opinion important, context.

You're antivaxer too?!

Listen, wearing mask least problems please people risk get infected you. die wearing mask, someone else could you. Wearing mask sign altruism, selfish nonsensical Society go on. There’s guarenteed vaccine treatment. neithet happens, what? can’t shutdown society waiting something may never happen. 0.26% death rate virus end world. went Mexico last week, bad baseline policy, that’s holding accountable additional lives community they’re putting risk costing direct result harmful, selfish acts. It’s fact used “retarded” pejorative rather word comes capsule form 'burp' taste whatsoever (unlike Omega 3 pills!). buy different dosages. brand I've using 600mg per capsule take twice daily. seen zero side effects one know side effects everyone's body different! big one hadd powerful institutions saying hiv wasn’t big problem hadn’t killed many people reused Francis’s words “you tell many people need die tell need take action “ Calcasieu, too? know little Look anecdotal case proves worldwide discussed measure!

I mean cool wife taking care guns, ignorant think that, everyone else follow guide lines... New Jersey gonna New Jersey. Focus gratitude have, that's good advice even normal times. obviously isn’t going enough, extension eviction moratorium something, least. good guys guns? 

Also isnt illegal serve alcohol someone gun possession? pick masked superhero (or supervillain lean way) we'd like fuck?

If so, I'm calling dibs Captain America Zorro. Well one one time someone got pissed get started blasting. Coworker's kid going back person classes. Granted Catholic school small class sizes, still... (in La.) MIL almost shot day quit job told man come gas station without mask. Dude came back gun luckily one customers foresight watch locked door. manager really broken it. Vietnam taken virus seriously. Trying imagine kind response United States.  Good thing top start Illinois group 50 considered ‘okay’ since phase 4 good. im glad got pepper sprayed Ah yes, exercising right protect rights force necessary makes us ""part problem"". dumb cunt. impossible school person classes online classes. players still need attend classes. Interesting article. maybe try make later tl:dr. Sorry lf anybody expected it. little bit complicated shorten many maybe interesting info sometimes time consuming bad english. Stay safe hestitate read full article.

Edit: nice get downvote that? tl:dr wanted?

Edit2: Thank helping out. think 1-3 nice observers different opinions masks try make stop idk. Really confusing sometimes. thx. need more. Agreed. But, premise thread wrong deaths increasing.

 
But, point 2, NY - 88% patients put ventilator died! 88%. death rate ICU patents really high too!

Experience curve kicks in. Trial error. know treating patients, death rate went due things. But, people still die. get it, people realize telling that, making people party, since people want party \*before\* lockdown starts again? I'm saying that's be, that's people are, moralizing complaining change it. good ruler know move people, complain. White House recommends inject liquid. take 600mg morning 600mg evening. also take NAC positive role ADHD management, YMMV.

You check r/supplements information, ask get varied replies! Great I’m gonna wonder they’re going fuck money again. they’re going take forever asked re-entersend information. know could’ve charge taxes year could’ve come even owe try steal someones TV none happens. I'm guy best anybody know make sure ok. somebody breaks house family threaten safety stepped world bets life means jack fuck all.  right free speech, also right listen. New Zealand Trust issue? Florida's statistics concerned, boat sailed long ago. I've read whole Bible NIV (New Internation Version) New Testament NCV (New Century Version) uses simple vocabulary, makes easier read. party event socially distancing Instagram pictures people going parties ""picture worthy""? I'm speculating here, course. wonder seeing pictures happening people photograph time. Maybe mix both? Maybe I'm boring ( maybe, am) much take pictures since March think big part staying adults stepping reasons range commuting work care-giving, visiting bars nightclubs even disturbing instances of Covid-19 parties deliberately get infected.

The article even mentions two reasons going work care-giving work least partially. two reasons really imply ""bored quarantine"". Two things like others. There's way us really know sure many caught method think ignore fact young adults less money less insulated economic damage generally speaking. people survival, like not. 

Care-giving also good point. beginning, grocery stores frequently shopping elderly relatives. limits stores put place means purchase took longer go multiple stores. Grocery delivery really improved since longer could caught then.

It seems like people going young adults tired quarantine leading infections ignoring possible confounding variables. pay 2 seconds lip service best. going bad places dumb enough open schools problem vast majority people can't handle much nuance. Loosening restrictions? Great, everything's over, let's go breathe other. \#believeallwomen ?  understand fatigue. We've working home three years baby. past months hard there's almost nowhere go. community center,no play dates. playground. us, him, Lego pond road. School coming we're excited worried.

And suffering Olympics. someone else might worse mean people entitled feel like crap depression. Beautifully put. understand. People repeatedly shown listen anything greater good. Bolsonaro still tests positive know nation shut down, there's real penalty people wear mask. Yeah know might get sick others might end hospital, without fines, arrests, clear cause effect people understand wear them.

Hell, even loss major sports working careful regular melatonin use suppressive effect thyroid. Anyone hypothyroidism take melatonin. take often, get bloodwork done twice annually monitor thyroid levels.

Rice basically carbs. standard human gorge carbs unless physically possible due scarcity believe conspiracy hide numbers deaths? win days, lose some. lows highs seem weird especially looking averages.

But low numbers I'm guessing also reporting issue Yeah, human nature pretty awful regardless side on. Reality fun, confirmation bias even worse. Aber bitte schließen. 
- den Tresor  people presented option of:

a) small chance dying covid living socially, maybe killing many older road like ""patient zero""

b) chance dying social boredom

they pick option a). would know? one. crashes hard, generations likely throw people generation one bag black sheeps whole society.

To fair, hundred years ago, spanish flu pressure, people felt similar flu proved lethal. second wave still coming. People thought gone, went lives bang. Door opened wide open, inviting uninvited guest inside. Psychological fatigue dangerous whole society. care person gone sickness still there. safe space already occupied anti-maskers tantrums haircuts Costco. GUNS!!! USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA!!!! matter time start unironically shared crop idiots see facebook feed. Sweet home Alabama Yes saying cops bad fucking stupid.

So black people bad cause represented crime, absolutely fucking not, need change something better cops altho change gonna need come outside. Lizzo? I'm bit confuddled. According people who've seen concert operatic powerful voice dancing well, two hours. I'd call healthy least cardio-wise, heavy weight-wise wonder much actually impacts health go nationwide tours perform like pop star (more sometimes) two hours. Anyway, really hope meant Lizzo I've typed mean, wanted open seats.... people need put jail house arrest first time refuse comply measures. Fair enough. 

I really think harder lockdowns coming unless start see explosion numbers say 1000 plus next week. know Melbourne lockdown different there's actually surprising number people supporting lockdown despite what's seen media mask use easily 95%

In saying though, heaps movement activity compared first lockdown. That's English first language. believe meant ""couldn't de-escalate"".

In English double-negative, (sort of), important here. US reaction healthy initiatives: GoVeRnMeNt CaN’t TeLl Do! RiGhT fAt! MuH lIBeRtIeS!!! funny thing this? last couple years people Barcelona bitched non-stop people traveling city party generally good time. English Spanish Trump sit watch India get number one.

Democracy Hong Kong! Taiwan number 1! :-) absurd. can’t imagine anyone actually think Reddit karma meaningful way assessing anything. Reddit full emotionally stunted, resentful pseudo-intellectuals. people clicking arrow someone doesn’t share correct Reddit opinion doesn’t invalidate opinion. Moderna pumping dumping. giants like Pfizer JnJ stay quiet. Lol.. u say hong kong govt cares people? Wtf Government can't anything, no. 1st Amendment say Damn thing society's recourse though. However, society stifled action due litigation. Even looking someone 'wrong' could probably get sued nowadays. Cubs fan here, I’m hoping team forfeits tonight rain league don’t come through.  isn’t working. he's pulling gun denied entry bar already full, thinking family either.

Why think family? imagine pandemic happened 2007 2014. different response situation US would be. ? highly debated -- means predominant threshold Well, technically, that's rapid way lower bar's occupancy. Millennials: ""WTF nothing like Harry Potter?!?!?1"" moron went looking confrontation Would guys say it’s safe fly? friend invited go Denver October charlotte since flights cheap.

edit: thanks guys response. I’ve decided go anywhere anytime soon later haha. It’s risky I’m worried mom specially since get would fall me. Thanks guys stay safe 😷 They're still gonna get evicted end though. Moratorium enough. need rent mortgage holiday. They're hoping mess takes place election. True, guess wouldn’t work unless they’re forced wear masks times. suck still make comment quoted less stupid. low-effort ignorant. Looking username though, makes sense.

Moderna coming victorious would big we've never mRNA vaccines would breakthrough many reasons. want get back normal ASAP continue part spread anything continue stay home 90% time matter badly want to. We've got finish line sight. We've made far, keep going little longer.  Nope Singapore, every fucking one wearing masks properly too. want fuckers deported tbh instead upset college charging full tuition online classes, would rather complain people concerned community spread? Dude allowed guns ever again.

Uhm.

Do realize radical understatement here? don’t think good news means “is done with”, especially you’re talking people Reddit. I’d say there’s far doomers real life. There’s difference skeptical positive headlines posting doubts world ever again. stop former start latter actually sound like OP talking about, seem want virus continue. you‘d share mindset people here, seems. There’s ton doomers Reddit, there’s lot people real life careless pertains virus. Who’s right? It’s probably somewhere middle, always is. world going go back normal. life going tumultuous then. don’t think go back normal still here? waiting anarchic Mad Max dystopia inevitable time get virus die? don’t see point going actually think things can’t change. Beg differ. 150,000 already died. One de-politicize it. I’m gun owning CCW instructor spare time.

I surprised patients wear masks in. recently went day surgery doors hospital patients dispose PPE wore (cloth masks, N95, gloves) get temp checked, COVID screening questions, wear mask gave us (surgical), keep throughout (well, took surgery GA, woke new one).

One reason type people customers.

The guy also wearing Trump shirt surprise. Oh boy. Matt Shea part extremely fringe group gadfly evangelical Protestants little connection vast majority Christianity even evangelical Protestantism matter. beliefs seem taking certain descriptions Jewish military organization tradition Old Testament prescriptions future actions despite quite clearly line Jesus's teachings New Testament.

Violence warfare almost entirely verboten Christianity since inception, something caused Roman Empire view weak cretinous. Many denominations completely reject military service. unless St. Augustine postulated ""just war theory"" late 300s sort violence viewed acceptable Christian church, carried legitimate government authority. St. Thomas Aquinas's later refinements war theory also require war defensive behest legitimate government authority.

As such, even accept role warfare Christian context, Christian tradition maybe Protestant Reformation (weird things started happen central authority Pope rejected, early Anabaptist uprising German Peasants' War, quite Protestant groups ended opting even pacifistic positions Catholicism) rejected notion guerrilla-style militias lying wait purge impure society. Best way know get tested fact people even allowed bring guns bar absurd. Alcohol guns mix. assume one else take business risk either, schools stuck mean dead assume, living it?

Thank husband serving community. Gotta honest, know argument is. saying post accurate intentionally bought Nazi flag (which much act requires make decision rooted racism). arguing whim, arguing intentionally made mask Nazi flag, repeatedly deliberately want showcase flag, another act steeped decision rooted racism. weird hill choosing die on? Big Farma  Florida become voice reason. weirdest timeline. Litigating costly though. one saying shouldn’t get help mental health. mental health plummeted whole thing.

I've seen lot posts IG lately fatphobia. Yes, exist, assholes like tell people they're fat whatever. also witnessed fat people complaining romantic/sexual rejection like... Excuse me? sex prove I'm fatphobic? anyone going criticize way like tall thin black guys? anyone going criticize blonde short guys blue eyes? No, get fuck away distorted views people feel them. Surfaces less likely transmission. Death rates function two things. First, offloading cause death onto things like pneumonia complications. second, death rates lower infection rates higher.

Death rates reported 4-8 weeks death itself. Confirmed cases couple days. imagine two hypothetical cities 1% death rate:

Date| A's Infected| A's Dead| B's Infected| B's Dead
---|---|----|----|----
5/1| 100,000 | 10,000 | 100,000 | 10,000
6/1 | 150,000 | 15,000 | 200,000 | 20,000
7/1 | 200,000 | 20,000 | 400,000 | 40,000

If deaths reported month later, reported deaths 7/1 15,000 City 20,000 City B. look like 0.075% death rate 0.05% death rate B, making look like B better despite literally twice actual deaths.

In practice, even messier takes roughly 20 days progress death. yields even larger time difference deaths infected counts, making look like worst infected cities even better. However, death rate instead climb rapidly healthcare system exhausted. 

Basically, deaths tolls date. new infections today become listed among dead mid-September. century pandemic

Yeah way figure often *that* happens. Whilst true, remember frame that, many things unaffected by, hence hasn’t done anything them. leader fixed problems unrelated us, would better country. much fixing issues rhat affected good, ignores issues don’t affect him. You’re NTA wanting keep community safe. 

I’m scientist, would think exposed one person exposed lot people still safer exposed lot people exposed lot people.

That said, also don’t entirely fault wife wanting take vacation destress, either — stress also bad health, hasn’t seen dad while, completely understand she’d willing take risk. 

If she’s set going, send plenty masks / gloves / hand sanitizer gently remind stay 6 feet apart others use common sense. way educate adults messed too. US media sensationalizes rather teaches (ex. Japan media) way process information, headlines vs substantive, keeps masses understanding ever-changing situations. Right world around seems view academics less(er) light prevalence success without academia uber-liberal stance campuses taken every front, would restore respect. highly recommend political comedy movie Dave starring Kevin Kline Sigourney Weaver. well meaning lookalike stands lousy us president becomes comatose *exercising* female staffer...  Oh ok yeah.

It's inside business, basically Fiefdom Zone. customers feel comfortable running building might barred completing shopping starting scene way violating infraction may even run afoul local laws. 

Not mention, folks try run store may lawyers know good ones could tied court case long time trying take stand folks like this.

And since there's healthcare country, idiots armed dangerous, customers know protection medical bankruptcy taking stand injures them.

On top that, customers know store continue bar idiots life, even ran day's inconvenience idiots, maybe week store got nationwide pressure. store caters everyone, matter crazy, seems sizeable base crazy store took hard policy stance crazy they'd lose much business.

Thus, Americans cowed taking stand wherever are. take energy decide document looniness spread word hopes someone eventually something it.

People won’t trust health officials keep changing guidelines. wouldn’t shortage PPE everyone wearing mask beginning less virus would circulating. would also mean less people hospital. Also, wouldn’t shut economy people dying suicides overdoses lockdowns. could prevented let everyone get proper masks. don’t think cloth masks truly effective otherwise aren’t made properly. cloth masks worked, health professionals would able wear work. people still catching COVID wearing mask think it’s wearing wrong type mask.

When make wearing mask mandatory take away something important lot people that’s free will. Rarely see governments change laws change back crisis over. People tired restrictions lockdowns stubborn wearing masks. fed conflicting information trusted health officials told us. Don’t call people stupid it’s professionals suppose trust failed public conflicting information. knew beginning masks work still told people didn’t work.

Wait wrong marky mark movie they're still working...I understand makes anyone look bad. WTF! 'left' want better control people like owning guns. issue gun ownership responsible people obviously person responsible.

Just weeks schools must open across Florida, numbers new cases hospitalizations due Covid-19 surged.

On July 16, state total 23,170 children ages 17 tested positive since beginning pandemic, according Florida Department Health. Friday, number jumped 31,150.


That's 34% increase new cases among children eight days.

And children Florida requiring hospitalization. July 16, 246 children hospitalized coronavirus. July 24, number jumped 303.

That's 23% increase child Covid-19 hospitalizations eight days.

During time period, death toll among children Florida went 4 5.

On July 18, Kimora ""Kimmie"" Lynum died Covid-19 complications, according state health department records. 9-year-old girl's family said Kimmie known pre-existing conditions.

The surges child Covid-19 cases hospitalizations come amid rampant debate whether children return classrooms fall, continue remote learning.

They also directly contradict US Secretary Education Betsy DeVos' claims children ""stoppers disease"" ""don't get transmit themselves.""

Researchers South Korea found young people ages 10 19 transmit virus easily adults.

And White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx repeatedly said scientists still studying quickly children age 10 spread virus, many stayed home away peers peak months pandemic.

But numbers new cases hospitalizations rising Florida. test positivity rate among children gone up, -- 13.4% 14.4% July 16 24, according state health department.

The test positivity rate children particularly high Martin County (25.3%) Miami-Dade County (19.6%).

But state ordered schools physically open next month. districts, means sending children school soon two weeks. parents, educators, doctors edge.

""I understand need opening schools,"" said Dr. Andrew Pastewski, father medical director intensive care unit Jackson South Medical Center Miami.

""Kids need develop, need grow, need learn, need develop social skills,"" said. ""However, we're surging right now. would think opening surge right time.""

Look, I'm staying open idea COVID causing long-term damage large number people (large enough change public health strategy), I'm yet see well-designed, statistically significant study confirming it. really postpone everything like November *vegan* protein shake truly sorry, family would've followed safety practices. family members may infected people afterwards.

....is wrong Covnitive problems seen even mild cases. virus causes itself. Please provide scientifically validated sources claim origin virus Wuhan Seafood Market.

Even Beijing authority claimed case. Much better, would coordinated federal government response. Hillary would definitely coordinated testing response national level instead starting patch work free all. way would undermine governors public forum like Trump actually knows constitution says apply political pressure (e.g funding). Probably biggest CDC NHS would lot less internal fighting happening covid even happened. also wouldn’t quite severe trade war diplomatic quagmire China. Chelsea Clinton would definitely deciding policy decisions.

Messaging would consistent across board.

But everyone knew Americans lied much can’t tell difference COVID19 flu. Well, attitude.  Great news wonder many suffer long lasting effects virus, rest lives. think case 2009 swine flu pandemic, also H1N1 virus.

I haven’t read Spanish Flu affected young people older people, still don’t know made Spanish Flu known first wave Spanish Flu wasn’t deadly, second wave, thought spread widely mass movements soldiers due war, mutated strain virus. sounds perfectly reasonable. all. Also SCMP China propoganda outlet, HK outlet. doctor even thinks back November. horrendous “cold” almost sent hospital twice. spent month October Hawaii week getting back started get really sick.

McConnell framed also protecting teachers, nurses, doctors unjust lawsuits face novel virus, frankly, sorta get. doctor nurse sued Covid-19 treatment unless it’s blatant malpractice. Teachers forced back work shouldn’t penalized follow state regulations either. that’s entirely separate issue business interwoven _businesses_. even equate protecting understaffed under-protected healthcare workers businesses proves much we’ve monetized healthcare.

And it’s insidious shitty thing throw down, know it. fighting business protection garbage, democrats painted fighting welfare teachers, nurses, doctors could victimized United States fairly lawsuit happy, especially economic collapse. 

And maybe I’m interpreting wrong. I’m means great understanding grand scheme politics, feels intentional. Like, again, Republican party uses working class vulnerable people shield corporate ass-patting.

Oh there's work everyone scared getting virus? Welp. Sorry, frankly clue talking keeping vaccine found today

Many vaccine candidates already would take months trials

Many vaccine candidates already months trials, handful stage 3 trials many months ramping production up

The promising vaccines already mass-produced hopes least one many months get people vaccinated

This accurate statement entire least year out

From article linked above, Pfizer vaccine could approved distribution ready many 100 million doses October. That's hardly guaranteed, entirely possible we're months, year, then, herd immunity response guaranteed everyone still risk

Herd immunity basically factor two probabilities: effectiveness rate vaccine, likelihood virus encounters vaccinated vs unvaccinated individual (which basically many people vaccinated). vaccine works produced, there's reason believe herd immunity cannot long past trying control quarantine virus. People need rethink future working look like virus stay years. I've got friends pharmaceutical industry saying thing.

 dear leader believed masks took virus seriously, they'd putting signs lawn saying

They'd militia insignia masks, they'd put truck nuts them, they'd talking minorities speak English follow message put masks, travel get together huge families spread virus. that's guy told do, tables turned sham freedom.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* vaccine found today would take months trials, many months ramping production up, many months get people vaccinated.

Moderna already started phase 3, AstraZeneca start phase 3 next month. beginning manufacturing next month anticipation expedited approval begin early November. one gave anyone permission protest

Well, technically, constitution did.

But yeah, people see armed militarized police, tear gas, tanks, guns, arrests, beatings, disappearances, etc directed protesters?? Even though right duty protest, government much giving ""permission"". ^(I bet lot working service jobs) **wish** ^(they could stay home still get paid.)

Edit: feel stupid get /u/gabriak trying communicate. must demand protections. must let known treated like 2nd class citizens.

That's meant right? I’m sure question asked lot, masks help people? 

EDIT: Yes, downvote asking genuine question. guess add 1) Wear mask time get house, 2) Know masks effective. It’s like I’m sitting bashing mask wearers saying fail work. Ffs  works market truly free government interference employers fear negative market impact treat employees. live world rules made rich, behooves act manner benefits political dogs versus working accordance market. people sense, could easily change market ourselves, would inherently look best opportunity refuse work sub optimal conditions. every person goes works McDonald's 7.50 hour another reason McDonald's interest raising wages. worker abuse, say thing, every worker comes works conditions another worker proves employer need change ways. Like US ignoring deadline submit data WHO? Texas turning people away die homes? Florida categorizing deaths pneumonia? 

If US/UK whoever fuck time point fingers, got time actually work problem. aren’t that? nice appeal authority. listen big pharma lords. oppose like now. Use public shaming...

Right. That's we're need law abused time.

Okay. think ever brought up. mean, ***you*** brought up. one saying ""we need make laws stop this"". Public shaming banned stores good enough. Better alive disappointing Dad dead grieving.

The police state real. Lick lick lick! Exactly. wasted lockdown enough tests early on! result we're better position (economically speaking). Tearful salute HK multiple times, live there...but read SCMP stories quite regularly. sure ""aisle""...gotta link story it?

The 14 days came China...and that's incorrect. 

But stories videos multi-month (as far know). Maybe I'll make Youtube video it. raw stories video editing skills it. honest first line/ necessary employee got time make pay stimulus check think include extra use risked lives kept food..health care..protection..ems..delivery rest table. knew dangerous. enough evidence reasonable person conclude dangerous, school board epidemiologist staff assess risks.

Valid question I’m really sure anybody knows answer. Technically efficacy masks *begin* fall percent infected rises whatever percentage reduction transmission masks provide, even breakpoint they’ll still continue useful, albeit decline.

But good luck trying find percent effectiveness everyone agrees on

Edit: u/Commyende pointed out, technically physically equally effective throughout pandemic, guess meant terms total number cases prevented, prevent smaller actual number cases approach herd immunity threshold since average people wouldn’t benefit mask % chance though? clarification, generally viruses evolve *less* deadly makes likely passed on. That's good. gonna dumb though. Don’t forget vitriol violence towards people go back retail service jobs make dogshit wages.

Darn got Nazi Flags... Meanwhile know $500 billion slush fund GOP gave went people immediately. Wow it’s almost they’re social age group chance me, care less effective vaccine proof concept platform they’ll use make real money rather stay unprofitably low margin business vaccines.

If pick trial, wait traditional vaccines reach p3. Sounds like healthy marriage...

I'd talk wife. Edit: Yes, fatality hospitalizations issue. consequence starting point conversation. occur result spread, occur spontaneously. 

&amp;#x200B;

I completely agree levels sickness. think hardest part virus different perspectives people approaching problem from. main issue comes response fatality. people see fatality hospitalizations honestly care. certainly people opposite end spectrum play long term health impacts fatality true problem facing right either issues.

The issue spread. Asymptomatic, Mild, Moderate... great people get suffer like others. fact overwhelming majority people handle virus quite well almost distraction major issue Covid. successfully mitigate spread virus without necessary precautions. since completely unafraid effects virus bodies unwilling protect vulnerable. Beyond that, impact workforce large swaths people workplace forced call simultaneously even continuously problem businesses.

Look baseball microcosm schools instance. 14 members organization get once. means 14 bringing home spreading family members. giving friends on. 35k+ Americans die vehicle accidents every year. Despite licensing program, it’s actually safety standards forced OEMs NHTSA keeps deaths even low. lot effort put designing cities roads force drivers safe things well. prove raising national speed limits also increased number accidents severity well increasing greenhouse gases produced. 

As far guns concerned, 80% gun owners live rural areas 75% gun homicides occur urban areas. majority gun crime committed minorities drug and/or gang related. suggest gun crime, like crime, driven poverty rather lack training. 

So example training certification largely useless example imposing training certification ignores real problem. 

But let’s take one step further. gun crime committed stolen otherwise illegally obtained weapons. gun crime related poverty, mostly poverty caused targeted racial oppression. gun control measures targeted gun crimes preferentially target white Americans. gun control measures would little affect gun crime primarily targets minority Americans. 

Gun crime isn’t special category crime. It’s unique way exceptional. It’s crime. crime, gun crime effectively reduced reducing *poverty*. But, reducing poverty means ending systemic oppression minorities. dirty secret America majority Americans don’t want that. 

So get privileged white people talking training certification that’s real issue. Instances like OP rare terms gun crime. Using edge case justify “solution” ignores problem is, word, ***stupid***. it’s accurately precisely described ***racist***. 

Instead thing statistically linked crime general gun crime specifically, you’re choosing solution backed science solely helps white people. 

The mental gymnastics white “progressives” perform avoid admitting racism become quite sight. You’d save lives increasing driver’s licensing standards traffic enforcement ever would training certification gun ownership. You’d reduce gun crime reducing wealth inequality ever would training certification gun ownership. But, first option affects personally second option reduces systemic racism actually oppose those, choose solution *appears* egalitarian avoid admit you’re racist narcissist. recall video Trump says something effect ""Diet Coke? never seen skinny person drink diet coke.

We fucked everyday possible continue make things worse, still plowing ahead wrong path hopes end right spot. going happen think hope normalcy next spring gong take months flatten curve see drop need get mess. avoid popular parks (Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, etc), still TOOOONS amazing national parks aren’t popular. Also, state forests also great (I guess depending state). I’m PA, plenty amazing state national forests here.

Also, even popular parks, you’re avid hiker like myself, you’d able take longer trails thus less likely come masses people. Yellowstone lot crowding tends happen big “must see” areas like geysers, hot springs, overlooks half dome. Since people probably see things, won’t see 6+ mile hiking trails :) absolutely worthless comment. countries problem? Well good thing let us know! suggesting move? control idiocy others making things political? Thanks! We'll get right work that. fact, think that?

What said tantamount telling poor person ""don't poor"". Gee. think stretching pretty damn far ends. guy got bar fight escalated, that’s bad enough. Let pearls go.  current economy? going hired couple years anyway, plenty time figure out.  still people 5 states wouldn’t it. know it’s tempting. that’s like hopping enclosed space travels potential hotspots picks travelers over... seems recipe disaster.   indeed hopeful thought.

Well. Done. got good laugh outta me! Whether goal achieved distinct question goal needs be. Opening borders necessity long term. That's point. Gov Abbott going shutdown state. I’m sure specific foods, Canada countries certain ingredients banned stricter health codes. say “good food”, mean “food tastes good”. 

Food companies US add unhealthy ingredients make foods addictive US one obese countries. agree mostly say. issue lately ""obese people endure complicated bouts COVID"" completely true. Look news programs showing latest casualties. Eight ten obese. That's risk I'm alright taking.

How fucking selfish. risk isolated catch pass others. Yes! people inherently selfish. Unless give mandate something, many won’t 

The idea “personal responsibility” ever going work America places laughable. way get people take seriously strong government response.

Unfortunately, states federal government seem care so...here Probably Q. seconds matter police minutes away. That’s works exactly. Large swaths mammalian genome code basic machinery life animals require live. share 80% genome domestic cats 60% bananas. even small difference DNA account huge differences species. Raw percentages misleading laymen.


Two within-species birds share larger differences chimpas humans big exception. probably reasons broadly true species makes fact misleading. Humans, specifically, 99.9% similar eachother Chimps 96% similar humans. means chimps 400 times different other. 

This opposed Chimps vs Bonobos, 99.6% similar other. 10 times different chimp bonobo chimp, chimps bonobos considered different enough distinct species within genus. said, Chimps bonobos interbreed humans cannot. Genetically speaking, clearly separate genus even close evolutionary relatives us. reason closest *living* relative species genus died interbred us. 

To say humans treated species chimp BS. entirely different genus evolutionary history separated 6 million years. It’s basically throwing finger science genetics taxonomy. 

Now I’m saying anything Jared Diamond one claim technically scientifically inaccurate. don’t know anything else author. strict buble *Canada.* Scientists even know even get covid Canada think it'd impossible properly. Like, deal people post satire people imitate others number problems?

It's fun think about, think possible. Well dammit can’t lick people what’s point? Well then, thank goodness one got hurt everything a-ok! /s weekend spoke friend posting bullshit masks Facebook page, told, ""You're getting played."" Aaarrggghhh. dropped link 70 articles support mask wearing. doubt make difference, least tried offer real facts. 

The problem disinformation spreading faster Covid. read piece conspiracy theories Mexico, everything Covid sent U.S. government using quiet dissidents. fake cures rampant well. think Facebook biggest offender, paying people many clicks--and wild-ass theories generate lot clicks journal articles. SCUSE THOUGHT AMURIKA He's probably going feel shitty. make people currently depressed feel less shitty? mask effective wore way... response ""that point""

It's legitimately thing telling one drive drunk could kill body, respond ""that's point""

These people told prevent spread global pandemic, go, nah fuck every one else around me. One might say ever getting older... work [well known international telecom company] I’ve WFH since March. There’s reason us office. entire team remote prior Covid. curious see gonna respond. contemporary open floor concept office isn’t practical  almost like thought virus would disappear aggressive screening staff. trust Fauci  Remember March CDC saying worst case scenario 200,000 dead. reduced 60,000 assumed Americans would follow medical advice. Pepperidge remembers. distinctly remember seeing video effect. Could inventing it, though, memories fickle like that. Checkmate confederate flag supporters. give another example virus infection recovery lead immunity vaccine does? far I'm concerned non-essential (literally everything food, shelter, water, electric, etc.) shutdown virus controlled like countries. Learn cook, learn mend clothing instead buying new ones, learn life skills. Biology trumps economy whether like not. takes one sneeze infect someone (or group) asymptomatic transmission occurring better let whatever happen happen pick pieces later. Pfizer aiming September approval mRNA vaccine. could well beat Moderna first one.

American hubris finest. people fail understand masks work minimize spread, yes, 100% effective.

People extremely false sense security thinking wearing mask turns superheroes wearing mask makes turns murdererers. absurd. Short term memory loss? None measures implemented properly. half-assed. Maybe rust belt? OK, every death tragic. school principal man's logic little Karen campus regularly since March

So keeping schools closed would prevent exactly how? died *with* stay home learning. single life lost one many.

Yes is. happens every day. Particularly pandemic. stop all? number one job schools day safety.

I would suggest change education. 

I see emotionally hard take risk. using single death person even campus school reason make sense me.  may reasons, one. way solve violent crime within African American community solve underlying social issues create opportunities. imprisoning folks things people skin colors would gotten away much easier.  logo looks like they're branch Tesco.

Yeah tried upload post linking video: ""Dr. Peter Hotez: White House running misinformation got removed ""political"" posts CNN apparently legitimate source now? link video interview Hotez uses exact words.

Meanwhile TN, saw highest number Sunday cases ever, 3100+. previous record Sunday 1900 range.... could say things looking here, good way 😅 cases, deaths. cases always directly correlated number tests can't base anything number. Japan's official number little 1,000. bad country 120 million. can't lean much official deaths ""with covid"" either method counting deaths vary wildly country country even city city. Mostly wildly exaggerated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then excess mortality rate, shows deaths causes. interesting look at, also take account effects lockdown measures, stress related fear mongering media well. true Sweden excess mortality rate higher compared previous years, guess question becomes, worth it? Personally I'd take dangerous freedom safe tyranny day, own. Stop spreading misinformation. City/county mask mandates went effect 3-4 weeks ago, Ducey re-closed bars, gyms, waterparks, etc. recently extended closures. 

So concrete things put place could well explain downward trends participate Medicaid supplemental income.

I idea. That's good. Federal Medicaid SSI paid federal income tax. payroll tax like Medicare SS Retirement Puerto Rico receives funds programs pay much pay income state taxes

Join club. states income taxes well. Puerto Rico alone. Sales, property, capital gains well. hate paying pay Medicare yet get funds rest states.

Medicare paid via payroll tax. Everyone lawfully employed US pays rate. Outside state run hospitals, states receive Medicare funds doubt Puerto Rico either. treasury directly touch funds -- except ""trust fund"". CMS, patients, providers. monthly premium residents NY State, PR, beneficiaries chose live France (even though can't use it). doubt Medicare Part coverage unique PR different _every_ state tied residency. every Part program evil.

Also, think reimbursement rates everywhere. aren't, I'd interested finding more.

Maybe thinking Medicaid? paid via income tax PR residents pay get funded state say, get information?

Just read news budgets. Something like quarter PR budget _federal subsidies_. like many states, PR utterly dependent Uncle lRS spreadsheet shows PR's contribution treasury lower _all_ states. $3.5 billion. lot less state Maine even though 1.2 million PDF shows 2010 Puerto Rico receives $21 billion feds. Table 1 page 27. state got.

The bottom line PR puts billion Treasury (almost none income tax) receives +20 billion back. income tax funded state. Plus PR receives full slate federal services: Postal, law enforcement, customs/immigration, defense, etc. Oh, one service jurisdiction need -- budget oversight board. 👍 AirBNB rental. cunt

It’s worth listen. go girl it’s time employees defend think simple answer. people told something, tend want it. oh man, tell CANT something, bet ass theyre going try best it.

the general public complete idiots. worse part people ive talked adamant wearing mask, taking precautions, etc, people 40s +. meanwhile friends (mid 20s early 30s) recognize serious everything stay safe. I'm curious means city living though. I've seen many people say things like ""Permanent WFH jobs mean move cheap house cheap state commute!"" uhhh... LIKE living city office get personal interaction every day. home day suburbs sounds like literal hell me. mention economic impact lockdowns social distancing long run need vaccine eradicate thing ASAP nuke ""tip hat"" Governor Ron DeSantis Florida whose incompetence single handily killed MLB season. Please throw Republican Christians pot Christians elsewhere world. us hold education, science history (it really odds religion, Adam Eve metaphor) high regard.  Got link? Yea new millennium. way know would carry over. nonsensical overkill.

Unless disease spreads sufficient percentage population, every time re-open spike again. So, play wack mole take rational approach Sweden took. Banning good,.... would preferred public ass kicking. states publicly reporting numbers also sending data HHS HHS agency receiving numbers point? Florida data always seemed little sketchy seems data trusted? sites like rt.live covid exit strategy able provide numbers projections? Local businesses take hit though. cafe middle downtown metro area one biggest money makers office workers getting lunch business meetings establishment. That’ll huge loss you. think it’s also worth stating lot jobs people google jobs one easily home instead office. don’t think signifies worse seems, seems like smart move avoid risk without huge effect work done. absolutely factor I’m sick articles assuming asserting it’s parties socializing. age group think called back work restaurants, bars, hotels reopened? 

My roommate (mid 20s) works front desk boutique hotel. Guests frequently come lobby maskless asked put one respond “there’s one here.” “No one” meaning one else paying here. fact bellman, desk clerk, bartender, fuck them, right? see similar behavior grocery store people social distance customers even try employees. 

“But could quit they’re concerned.” Yes lose right collect unemployment well health insurance. That’s option majority workers. 

Our country reopened expense poor retail hospitality workers. message sent loud clear spa weekends sip paint important health. Millennials taking virus seriously government employers are. Weird Al needs hired music this! ;) smaller companies this, we're mil ARR 25 employees. remote since 1st week March, save building cost nobody endure 1/2+ hour commute downtown. good many ways, people need person interaction well, there's nothing ever replace person creative sessions. Imagine trying play band that's remote, hideous part haha. ain't complaining, hated sardines commute rush hour, never felt right. realize high school total 1000 students probably another 50 teachers/administrators/staff result 5 people dying. doesn’t include deaths students faculties extended families. banks fault time around, Covid-19. completely polar opposite housing bubble 2008 banks handing loans like candy. Generally corporate positions long list job requirements qualifications greatly reduce supply qualified applicants. take precautions, go way around people, nerve start gofundme pay foolishness self-centeredness. Unbelievable. don’t remember telling us socially distance/wear masks/stay home feel like it. half-assed fucking effort stay line measures phase 1 restrictions lifted. Oh yeah people decided walk streets pretend there’s virus. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ It’s transparent pastor trying paint portrait media wasn’t big deal. 

I would bet scum hold another revival shut even another positive case “it’s flu.” Wear freakin masks! believe spray cheese banned here. used know guy who'd always bring back case went America. sure wine pair with, though.

Do really think going test contact trace way this? deal.... inmates ""die"" Federal Prison. die reach hospital. inmate death prison last thing administration wants deal with. think lot companies looking hard hybrid now, i.e. come work kick project couple days, WFH two weeks. office 2 days, WFH 3 days, staggered staffing, etc.

Most office jobs seen pretty minimal impact productivity, turns out, commutes people screwing around online/chatting colleagues, workers truly ""worked"" 40 hours week anyway. WFH means get crap done, available on-call meetings, otherwise basically paid retainer fee knowledge ability ramp immediately project. virus stayed amongst ignorant, I'd agree. Unfortunately, willing die social time also engage essential tasks (often sans mask), like getting food going doctor thus risking spread vulnerable populations. Shouldn’t filed anyways? get W2 file right away, takes 10 minutes One year long enough people relocate entire family. Unfortunately. Right. people say panic it’s inherently bad thing? drive street enough reason panic. Look around. average people take advice all, they’ll take top. don’t anyone top. Gritty national icon anything, think initial predictions wildly higher given still knew little. remember reading March Harvard epidemiologist said 40-70 percent Americans would get infected, time believed death rate 1.5 percent. 

So like 3 million people. people money spare (WFH folks) spending either. They're using pay debts, saving it. last stimulus check dumped straight car payment. impossible put number perspective without average age victims. Lives lost isn’t telling figure life lost. people prefer live much lives possible die. “Was”?  forget commuting cost, employees bear work-from-office model.

My wife work. one car per job. work-from-home permanently, would need one car -- would different requirements cars currently have, would *only* used family transportation. It’s programs, it’s subsidizing corn wheat and, stoping companies putting corn syrup sugar everything, focus whole Foods school gloried carbs carb sauce side cookies chips. Get physical activity schools, outdoor time etc, give parents break get vacation time school actually hang kids cook instead everyone rushing around picking fast food freezer meals. lot kindergartners don’t fucking recess like all! company meetings finance person keeps saying 'we saving lot money office' CEO ends quick 'no discussions reopening yet'.

I hope places allow permanent part time remote. I'd love hybrid situation (once things back normal). Yeah, place end september, pushed back end december, 2021. Hope get permanent option corporate positions? Surely could find plenty people jobs significantly less. supply demand work there? mean snarky sounded. Usually block people snark back me, appreciate patient response.

I hope doesn’t happen course. seems inevitable swear God, every time come see people behaving way, I'm reminded mind numbingly STUPID people are.. Take fucking history class! thought bull riding illegal? aspects bull sports banned? Lol, Trump care kids school online only.  right, SARS-CoV-2 potential infect 40-70% global population, called february AFAIK adjusted since: Tom Clancy’s division become reality lol There's evidence result herd immunity opposed straightforward reasons: mask mandate, mobility still reduced 15-40%, closing restaurants/bars. happy talk make feel better possibility another wave.

Evidence showing modeling either. Take look tail death curve AZ compared NY YYG model cited. long flat, meaning sustained elevated transmission, quick up/down get lockdown supposed herd immunity threshold. Look, mortality rate great. disease spreads stupidity helped caused inept leadership, thousands die thay mortality rate need to. see issue staggering numbers?? Sadly I'm one cant drink water anymore.  husband got cirkul tolerate flavors water intake much better nowadays. surviving coffee coke. Yeah, basically fear mongering. Good luck.

Some roles see viable WFH, great majority pose huge leak risk longer WFH continues higher odds security compromise. majority tech companies aren’t anywhere near valuable likes Google, Apple Microsoft, there’s greater risk involved lot local company. Technically efficacy masks begin fall percent infected rises whatever percentage reduction transmission masks provide

I'm sure follow. Let's say masks social distancing reduce transmission 50%. R0 3, M+SD would reduce R 1.5 population immunity. population 33% immunity, R would 2 M+SD, 1 M+SD. either case, M+SD reduces R 50%. Even R 1, M+SD cut half, hastening decline disease. things continue way been, might end like Jonathan Swift's Modest Proposal, poor people start selling babies rich eat. ROFL. fuck....

I'm usually one them, certainly getting COVID vaccine. (I also think I'll start getting flu one regularly help prevent community spread, issue thought much prior year.) singling Gen Z here? great company! 

Can ask pay WiFi costs incurred wfh? imagine it’d less commuting maybe something discussed/worried about? another Spanish flu ever hits - much less anything worse - I'm truly terrified developed world virus kills 1 400 people - maybe 1 10,000 people 50 - causes level panic, going something serious strikes?

Yeah, makes think virus apocalypse films optimistic since factor scale corruption, incompetence, malignant ignorance exist real world.

Thank you! hope staying safe Australian article.

But Aussies get taught Australian mythology too.  Maybe pulled kids school find old man pedo. would amazing! going okay knowing may caught virus passed onto someone greater chance dying? That’s I’m worried about. me. parents. older couple grocery store. elderly neighbor see passing. Sure use caution around others, never know. thing spreads easily. demonstrate act masks. Saying would turn USA nazi germany. reasonable yeah thats say. Sucks chicago. phoenix thousands people literally 95% people wearing masks. I'm surprised thought chicago would smarter it.. don’t see working home productive part long run, moment it’s working minimal distractions. Can’t go out, can’t see anyone, don’t many options besides something home actually working. 

In long run life goes back somewhat normal, don’t think people productive home. ugh sad true. i’m starting seriously struggle isolation able see family working. job 100% face face. sure could come back. feels hopeless. Rest peace. Mardi Gras pretty early year. Covid barely getting talked US point. remember sense dread back then. Sounds like faith. found examples it, telling 100% impossible someone break home? Also dont ignorant sheltered european thing think reason american violent crime lmao. stand head shoulders average westernized country. industry coming back there's vaccine. So... I'm fucked. 

Also, us got laid feeling positive experience &amp; likely go back. think they'd hire us back probably know there's resentment. Honestly think killed damned corn subsidy it'd huge start. Problem that's politically impossible long rest country lets Iowa first primary. I’m Canada, well went Walmarts US. different experience. Also good food that’s banned Canada. think it’s worth visit one day yeah definitely middle night. Rest peace. Lots pay lip service popular. instead try boil frog ""public/private"" partnerships sort work hiring for? promise people looking. I've unemployed since May I've looking (even 3 interviews), hired anywhere yet. I'm sure case lot people market saturated people like looking jobs. 

Not everyone unemployment looking handout would love know industries actually hiring right now. sucks unemployed reliable income (it took two months get unemployment first thing pay bills price rent. knows another check come in). wrong suspicious graphs showing drop numbers started going white house instead cdc? Eh, varies wildly based district even specific teachers. glossed 1-10 me, 11th grade teacher nearing retirement already enough points so. 

He said fuck it, curriculum bullshit, spent entire year teaching us Nazi Germany, including preceding decades, complete clusterfuck Balkans. think first time many classmates actually seen real photos mass graves...

It's still indictment American education system roll dice quality pertinence education nevertheless great teachers scattered throughout country. employer (worldwide quarter million employees). big companies know what's medium/long-term, moreso government political wonks television talking heads. Regardless, highly doubt they’re making decision based energy bill. shelled 1000’s covid costs. Oh jeez. NHL fine. They’re strict bubble system.

The MLB isn’t attempting sort bubble system, makes great preview NFL season (also bubble) look like.  heard thing stop bad guys guns good guys guns. one Dallas guns? bad guys stopped immediately? ""Hope"", nothing else left. guy still alive, he's got going him, least COVID like AIDs people natural immunity it? feel like would work till people less expensive states willing work remotely less. fact disinfected market discussed multiple times article. 

If hadn’t disinfected market outrage criticism would significant. 

But disinfect it, outrage criticism must done cover up. 

At point definition “the wrong thing do” seems “whatever did”. this, lots people would go work sick, using public transportation spreading whatever infected with.

People still workplaces allow it, provide sick days, people want use time off.

It's shame. story includes everything shitty America. Public outrage focused difficulty getting drunk, sports bars, ~~idiots with~~ guns, science denial. Boy, surely easier call people inside Planet Fitness ""working out"" anyways. :) Really. Also Hospital Authority announced salary freeze doctors, nurses medical workers time... Probably end pandemic. Unfortunately UK USA far alone comes many fat people. population obese rare all. Masks help ton, even convey user protection reduction infectious dosage. honestly say they're worth time energy? see cities spending much compliance measures outside police (who duty anyways) issuing fines responding calls.

And also, literally economic regime would require significant portion population physically present work. I'm trying appreciate points, countries implemented decentralized public health response COVID-19 came side fine. young Mainer trying buy house Cumberland county, makes sad. interesting account diabetes obesity well.

(Where source diabetes obesity stats? I'd love check out!)

But sure trying show me? 

My point Sweden looked ""a failure"" outcome locking down.

But compared several ""10 million"" countries lock harder, badly. throw Quebec well 9 million 5,600 deaths.

The *overall* point presented clear vision would happen country shut fear used scare us locking down. legacy instilled fear still us.

Flooded hospitals. Mass casualties. Dead streets. Disaster.

And Sweden shows us *was simply true*.

As matter fact, vision materialized *anywhere* world.

It possible go Covid sensible moderate measures come side ..

""5 people dying every 10,000, casualties last stage life"".

 .. also protect economy disaster.

So general point. Sure Sweden didnt well Finland. 

But interesting ""If dont lockdown CORPSES STREETS"" become ""If dont lockdown might well Finland."" amount would comfortable killing me. work pandemic truth nobody gives enough fucks life, give fuck theirs.

You something point there. seem like lot people yell everyone else stay home save lives, they're perfectly happy letting delivery people supermarket workers work, sit home still fed entertained.

""Don't kill grandma!"" 
""What dude delivers food hundred people day puts risk?"" 
""Bah, fuck him"" vote comment want. Gathering large groups people pandemic deserves Darwin award. Doesn’t reflect sports congregate players people less suggested social distances along masks? Let begin end discussion...you don't. test like crazy every last person it. act results tests meaningless. Also, ratio tests/infections significant, absolute number tests tests per capita. see banning Walmart acting like Nazis, we're actually becoming real Nazis?!?

/s sadly comment actually makes lot sense lot people think like that. Severe COVID-19 caused excessive NF-kB driven cellular immune response. causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced, order kill pathogens establish intracellular latency, SARS-CoV-2. However, chronic, excessive production ROS damage, ultimately kill cells, leading disease. NF-kB driven response also closes receptors used pathogens enter cells, also lead disease, prolonged.

Obesity associated production immune system cytokines, interleukin-6 TNF-alpha. cytokines activate NF-kB driven immune response. Therefore NF-kB already systemically activated obese individuals, additional activation caused virus lead life threatening crisis.

The act wearing swastika racist symbol. intent behind wearing matters. Hollywood actors automatically turn racist put Nazi costume. They're separate purpose aside racism. Much like couple video, they're wearing swastika protest symbol. They're racists, they're really fucking dumb.   No, Puerto Rico, per Supreme Court, ruled many times Puerto Rico US merely possession.

This pandemic whole different animal 1918 flu. isn’t flu- it’s neurological inflammatory disease. much lasting damage moderate severe cases, may discover another decade, younger adults age. likely less death immediate timeframe 1918 flu. also, remember much advanced medicine. 1918 technology right now- every person hospitalized died- would death rate be?? 

Sorry, I’m rambling. Remember estimating 140,000 dead end July? LOL BRAKES. Yeah went nightmarish nothing course two weeks? Still want kids schools pandemic want parents/workers making demands. 

I genuinely think they're pushing kids three reasons.

1. live rule ""keep defense"". Right-wingers (and many Democrats support and/or appeasement) constant attack years. Obvious things do, end allowed essentially real opposition party. 

2. parents get back work, they'll distracted society's unraveling less obvious. fail, pandemic rage, people too. 

3. want system remain intact, they're going wrong way. Look Trump's offensive making leftist look like terrorists. [Since 1994, there's one known fatality hands yet they're trying label terrorist, keeping people defense, never progressing. They're scared death leftist uprising. crumbing capitalist society result people developing left wing mind set. know idea socialism rise. Republicans Democrats support NDAA Patriot Act. 38 million people lose home, overwhelmed streets. cliche quote Marx, ""they're gravediggers"". Google seems FDR-Keynesian desire sustain system. seems rare among ruling class days. Deny want. Believe Biden's regressive policies want. empire decay, workers cannot keep afloat much longer. Keeping kids school, wanting help parents makes gravediggers. extrovert. ... mental fog sense lethargy slowly driving crazy. 

I'm introvert feel fogginess inside however many days been. little complicated that. Same. remember like one part weird passage (I don’t think allowed talk stuff saw test) Yeah security high priority tech giants. Every room hallway entrance places like Google/Apple require badge door, security physically present high traffic areas cameras watching areas aren’t. Google employees even track digital footprint seeing places badge been, like logging breadcrumbs. 

Tracked population, privacy screens every device, rules words cannot use outside certain geographical areas social circles, etc. rules everyone follows. can’t even work project google bus filled googlers interest security, doubt allowing people permanently work projects anywhere want Google’s security interest. 

Not saying might solution this, big advocate permanent WFH. Apple known WFH reason, much stricter Google. don’t see shifting permanent WFH anytime soon, least roles concerned. fat? wandering around hospitals without mask.

No. knuckle head owners kept gym open refused shut even getting arrested blame honestly. watching things happened recently US, feel safe, scared too. mass killers using guns bombs knives? Ok simple questions:

Why 99.99% people wear mask atm supermarkets elswhere?

Edit: cause people scream ""my freedom"" atm most? lockdowns, masks on. those? Uncle Sam goddamn. Yeah 40% people follow Trump doing, model definitely work. well made lose breath ;) *Shooting intensifies* way that... overeating mostly.

You see bullshit studies claim NYC healthier places, fail note research done... observing people malls midwest (mostly older people) vs. people walking around lunch hour wall street. 

Wall Street highest concentration world mostly younger, white males way average 6ft height people.  Yea course going observe obese people malls noon.  ignore large groups people work neighborhood industry obsessed young blood long hours. Walk around parts Bronx time see there's huge percentage poorer people eating McDonalds instead $12 salads Sweet Greens. Economics, genetics, come play here.

But overall poor diets. Portions insanely large US. dinner portion US easily 2-3X world considers meal. seen degree wall 10x ration approximation start spread. certainly hold new york found 15 20% population infected. 200% infection rates :). Pretty long odds there. 1, dont kids. 2, dont friends kids(mid 20s), 3, kids coming over, lock case closet, brought back leave. Finally, plastic holster release mechanism designed let kids able open it, easy open know how. real question whether Marlins Phillies going lose two weeks quarantine. even pretend season teams going dropping weeks time?

It competely mess whole league weeks.

Working home hesitate more, goes way around. manager hard time telling without reaching out. Yes I'm aware limitations BMI. cut-off clinical obesity 30+. opinion, percentage people BMI unhealthy level body fat, versus competitive bodybuilders?

To put another way, context entire adult US population; would say many people bodybuilders, many people bodybuilders?

To thinking you, here's free article: says cut-off actually *too specific*, meaning people meet cut likely obese, people meet cut-off also obese. Imagine defending Nazis. deserve punched face . I'll top trust issue fact 18 anaesthesiologists UF Shands covid going party. So. There's that. UK think actually made changes.

USA ended disaster. Call local board health, don’t read this, it. don’t know Minnesota states point require quarantine state travel (which exceptions.) example NY, NJ, New England kind banded together form superstate that’s travel within. say flew Boston Miami...you required quarantine 14 days stiff fines non-compliance...the tough part enforcement. Thus, call local board health. Anything boss says try’s talk insist email. almost certainly can’t legally fire this.

Like, yes, positive thing, really make better opinion anything. handling pandemic UK pretty bad overall. Johnson going ""it good overweight"" almost effect whatsoever. mean Japan 500 new cases day now? Sweden one highest deaths per capita world? no, doubt expat like living Vietnam, given tragic number deaths happening countries. Also number cases 14 Da Nang. Clearly plan working hospitals totally overrun right now. Must nice caring overwhelming amount death suffering fuel idiotic political tirades. must real easy stick hands ears one affected.

At least stop pretending care lives others.

Nobody talking permalockdown. need lockdown numbers manageable, clearly evidenced countries right now.

Case point, petite RA, illness almost nothing lifestyle. always people live unhealthy lifestyles live long, healthy lives. doctors telling many common, deadly diseases, like heart disease diabetes, unhealthy lifestyle unhealthy weight going significantly increase chances getting ill dying. like smoking two packs day likely give lung problems live old age. Besides mistaking outliers norm, people also mistake ‘healthy’ younger people success stories. 25, even maybe 40 look friends bad lifestyles, may get impression ‘everything fine’, decades later, things may much fine.

This might explain tachycardia people /r/covid19positive experiencing maybe? Good news is, SARS patients issue eventually recovered. thing I'd concerned scarred lung tissue severe patients recover. problem many African countries too.

Someone going around mocking weight, fat shaming. opening certain places ready working cardio. things incredibly difficult outside gym like deadlifting/squats/bench press. everyone uses gym walk treadmill 20 minutes leaves. Outside home gym hard work certain muscles sufficiently get certain point. Contact tracing far seems show much bump protests, yes, source zero new infections. Even so, fair evidence efficacy masks worn general public hairdresser incident, one 2 infected hairdressers serving 140 clients result new known infections. Everyone masked. Combined emerging studies suggest reducing initial viral exposure may result less severe disease, seems like even small attempts reduce risk really public health impact. That's part folks deliberately ignoring risk annoy far least try.

Since folks probably also backyard parties refusing wear masks stores, also hard know they're getting infected events elsewhere, also means extremely high likelihood someone crowd, probably several someones, infected. going popular Reddit, people actually like getting house interacting others face face.

But maybe reality, yeah, 20-25% whatever number captures people likely spreading likely infected (whether they're people like cab drivers meat packers people partying whatever). Whereas majority population people like me, go every weeks buy groceries (wearing mask, using hand sanitizer, staying away people, etc.) low chance spreading infected.

So guess thinking ~70% numbers based society functioning normal whereas 20-25% numbers accurate based society schools closed many social venues shut lots people wearing masks practicing social distancing. serious question people field, chances success virus ? coronaviruses general difficult ? thoughtful link/ comment/post do. far read, 'quick' vaccine solution look doable. hope treatment (not vaccine) near future (means early 2021-mid 2021) hoping many years.

Business travel sucks, people think glamorous 95% time spent dingy conference rooms, eating dinner people despised, working alone night room, sitting airport lounge waiting airplane. truly confused lockdown. signed March flatten curve, expression heard since April. information released virus rarely straightforward either carries doom gloom message tries downplay virus. Millions lives affected virus, lockdown, both. Jobs lost, schools closed, many businesses suffering. Every attempt re-open met spike cases, outcry return lockdown. 


So end? point willing accept people die?

That sounds like great way spreading covid. That's silly fucking argument. messaging initial lockdown incredibly botched- sold politicians 2-3 week ordeal overemphasis reducing hospitalization bubble.

A new chair would nice though. multiple problems...

1) regular anti-vaxxers vaccinate

2) know much Trump would strong-armed FDA approve vaccination claim 'victory' elections

3) Rational people want least wait year see side-effects vaccine. 

Any three ideas go viral would. report issued, read it.

Dude read fucking journal. They've publishing research subject months - need far International investigation.

We investigate crazy bullshit people want believe understand genetics viruses jump species lab get spread lab employees outside lab.

Occam's razor. species naturally evolved lab got past safe guards PPE escaped species naturally evolved outside lab easily infected people unprepared. labs leaked SARS 1 before.

SARS leak lab either - fuck wrong species bat virus native Wuhan.

You know funny enough damn thing jumped pangolin bat facts matter crazy nonsense?

The crazy nonsense pushing refuse believe natural event. Something understand crazy slightest clue viruses work.

Maybe international investigation lizard people to. boss lives Ohio. Fully thinks Rona hoax. Said go away election. didn’t even try argue. I’m sure discover mistake soon enough. wrong.

Which diseases reached herd immunity humans? go back ""regular"" life still see friends go eat mitigating risks contracting spreading virus. I'm running major stock problems is. I'm constantly getting substitutions orders. going enforce it?

My county/state mandatory mask mandate, Planet Fitness go sign upon entry states required wear mask unless endangers health.

The end result like 70% gymgoers wearing masks half masks noses exposed. reason tip go food? Well, one might ready. long think take make hundreds millions billions vaccines?

And, happens teams outbreaks? 

Maybe rest MLB makes weeks without outbreak. probably another insane scheduling shifts need made.

What there's playoff break? going make team forfeit? Suspend playoffs?

This season clearly going hole.

It's absurd point. can't even go games. Struggling like going cost money take lot effort maybe good broadcasts. think that's right. Getting flu recovering confers immunity particular flu virus. annual flu vaccines different viruses every flu season. Umm, actually cant wear mask.

American dream: 7 figure hospital bill. Soccer mostly happening Europe, there's roughly 20 times less new positive cases per capita compared US. Every major western European country bar Spain posting better per capita numbers American state. one bullshit tickets ever written yes, that's meant. China something bad, mean let Trump get hook. bad ""dream"" became nightmare trump. dick-nose people I'm seeing actually real proper surgical masks, least surgical style disposables.

Because people stopped going free Sweden lockdown economy expected suffer badly European neighbors would ever done practically?

Yeah, know, pretty much impossible. realistically physicians need asses people risk vaccines first, practice wrong thing do.

I guess maybe persuade wait.  Maybe Trump show leadership follow crowd people think need vaccine, smart considerate ones get crowd realize self-defeating they've been? Among millions infections, confirmed cases reinfection. don’t feel like you’re genuine. Lol coffers deep enough understand viruses work? need host. Since hosts tendency either eliminate infection cases die, virus needs hop new host continue propagating. cannot find new host, dead-end it. Well, golf, fuck wants watch shit? Trump became president. great question. presented claims family members would like time resources respond back with. Well, that's darn shame. sides ass.

RBG last another term, regardless who's office. listened first part phrase ""...to flatten curve"". second part ""to get cases level contained widespread testing contact tracing"", never still doing. going away either \*that (\*like every developed nation doing), vaccine (which may never happen), herd immunity (which likely involves millions dead).

This country seems landed hoping door #2 willing accept door #3.  150k dead - see disaster. good source state excess deaths? That's lot people 😮😯 must really ""cool"" host. But, can’t that. infringes freedumbs! He's another American trying push blame America's failings someone else. pathetic. put layers mask, since one mask keep nose completely covered. bootstraps ffs!! concept would fine Europe think timing right US... masks social.distancing, least test players regularly. bad news everyone. getting votes unfortunately right.. Coronavirus something live probably forever, like seasonal flu.. Vaccine take another 6 months develop test take 6-12 months deploy general public. Granted everything goes well vaccine works lasting immunity, likely return ""normal"" summer 2022 life already different likely never return normal life accustomed sounds insane me, 6 grocery stores within 15 minute walk. I'm suburbia, hardly Kowloon either.  sequencing full genome RaTG13 lab’s sample virus disintegrated, said. “I think tried culture unable to, sample, think, gone.”

The subtext article clearly ""Wuhan lab caused COVID"", there's sample, could it?

Just propaganda bullshit. know 100% certainty China lying? No, would pretty big surprise highest population country world (and country first transmitted virus) remarkably low numbers. seems pretty obvious they're making attempt cover asses. extent one knows, news agencies sides political spectrum show high likelihood something fishy going second largest GDP gave 86 million compared US gave nearly trillion (893 million). China though, everyone else. Look contributions country, public info. I'd love US spending everyone else pulls weight too. 

As US finding cure, know answer. assume countries trying buy much cure found. US large population large amount money. Every country trying procure much vaccine people can. necessarily ethical right reality that's limited US. think people wearing nazi flags they're educated? think they're owed love compassion? think feel-good movie? 

historically, complacency like never worked terrible idea. Something tells rarely deal bigotry meaningful way No, there’s 3 might available (unknown) capacity may may effective We're reddit.

Heart disease, neurological problems, organ (i.e. liver pancreas, kidneys) damage. Covid keeps giving.

I would really like see study like young children.... send school. That's bold statement theoretical vaccine. want see Raiders-Browns game. ask shortstop ok.  /S think he’s enjoying role tiebreaker. Roberts might powerful man country right now. deciding split decisions.  know Florida old Yankees go die, im guessing live far North know snowbird is.  Older relatives sometimes trouble technology. family’s case, stepfather able download app video chat us, mom’s dementia keeps understanding (her family) screen it’s tv show.

We gone twice masks sitting 6’ apart outside visit. engaged animated visits, nice. visits push back stepfather’s invitations visit inside. (Sigh.) owns genuinely believed moronic conspiracy theories virus hoax engineered democrats ruin Trump’s re-election. feel like people believing propaganda dangerous people simply don’t give fuck. rug really tied room together, not? today, recruiter justify lower salary saying job remote. skills &amp; expertise aren’t less valuable don’t need put pants. Probably nothing trumps announcement time getting Americans home eh? joke fact published scientific consensus seems overarching issue 


That diminished trust institutions capable work love north-ish/East jersey things fine here, south jersey retarded. depends cheap compensate employees internet, electric, permanent work home setups. stuff usually paid companies. family parties stupid, seemingly frequent COVID. want see family too, end goal us alive healthy time next year. Every get together without mask risk. already know several people tested positive outdoor get together. It’s worth it. real issue even called They've explicitly stated they're reimbursing food expenses. withdrawal football? attendees charged. state wide mask mandate enough right now. deaths reported daily WEEKS AGO. Tests taking WEEKS come back results. need shutdown proper one.. mask mandate help 3 different types vaccines entered phase 3. moderna vaccine mRNA vaccine. traditional vaccines may better way vaccinate using pandemic trial new technology. Oxford vaccine sub unit vaccine believe. parts virus whole virus. Chinese vaccine using whole virus killed. second two traditional ways making vaccines 3 entered phase 3 imagine make decision January likely virus still problem then. use data make decision one, three them.

As hard develop. tricky question nobody really knows. Viruses like HIV hard develop vaccine whereas vaccines againsts viruses like smallpox eradicated disease polio virus close eradication vaccination. previously vaccine developed coronavirus bit unknown. 

One thing suggests vaccines may work hospitals using serum recovered patients treat sick patients. part serum could protect coronavirus would antibodies. three vaccines showed antibody production response vaccine anitbodies could protect virus monkey trials. hopeful vaccines provide protection might mean milder disease rather complete cure.

The reason people think might work viruses would hope cytotoxic cell response. vaccines developed good inducing these, developed vaccine HIV. But, mentioned, antibodies seem providing protection disease definitely reason hopeful. again, nobody really knows clinical trial results out. lot things look great phase 2 fail phase 3. terms “a human dying”, equally tragic.

It’s clear worth place human life ability work/create wealth someone else.

So what’s cut age stop caring old persons life? retire? reply makes 0 sense First time I've heard anyone realistic end. bunch fucking idiots. Israel infection rates July 25th, 2020: 1,203 new cases. Adjusted population (by factor almost exactly 36) 43,312 cases per capita - US numbers day 67,413. spreadsheet might bit off, post it. hope end Black Friday. Employees deserve Thanksgiving Day Friday off! entertainment personally willing say oh well got paid.. families right?? whole data presentation mess entire time regardless who's control. Media reporting consistently confuses idiosyncrasies ambiguities data gathering/reporting actual trends; actual trends scope impact difficult pull noise obfuscation seems almost one data geeks Twitter even trying.  That's good know -- thank you! Ok daged tho? believe odds dying, even young comorbidities, something like (0.01%), still orders magnitude higher ods anything happening due vaccine. put mask That's really cool love job! feel honestly, started new job last october got sick flu, covid. Took sick time pretty immediately, totally understand feeling. Thankfully kinds opportunities show well doing! nailed last sentence, even joking

Being fat simply undisciplined- period Where’s say mask? overreaction/biased reporting? Whatever correct word is, portraying hoax ([A hoax falsehood deliberately fabricated masquerade truth. distinguishable errors observation flagrantly disingenuous. Yeah. US showing less deaths Texas. Depends fat are. I'd prob get tested... Keep calling lender. Also look assistance programs run state. Good luck. clearly far worse Swine Flu show one? Stop protests stop spread ""Kaaaaaaren... tell keep flying front ways... ain't missing damn NRA celebration"" Red Rover Red Rover

Can 9 Non-Covid Marlins

Please Come Over? Decrease. Anything everything done fabricate ""response"" climbs saw last month. Federal funding testing pulled, HHS taking data collection, changes morbidity counted. thought Poe's law specifically text format ""because open. duh"" time hear excuse, meager best. Around half US voted trump. tells everything need know. Comparing worst pandemic century belittle sacrifice way. 

The fact casualties well century ago compared suggests they're important, opposite belittling. haha fucker know feel parties LMAOOOOOOOOO GET LOAD EXTRO

Alright, read first sentence again, voice Bane Good. 2020 Honestly, too. I'm kind ashamed generally, pride solid level discipline self-control. reason, cant bring bare minimum WFH. soon I've done bare minimum, there's much stuff I'd rather doing, like sleeping cooking getting errand done playing video games. Whereas office none stuff option although sometimes might fuck browse Reddit rest day something, lot times I'll go work beyond simply nothing better there's nowhere take nap.

Tbh think I'd WFH whole career point, I'd nowhere near I'm now. Add Oxford that's 3 ready end year. love fed govt asks pretty please cherry top close bars. don’t ask shit want go city mow citizens federal agents. would looked \*more\* like SARS1, exactly like it. would tested traced starting January. would reduced case load way European countries did, relatively safe now, like are. Here’s concern football. Linemen, given enormous size weight, fact high risk? 

Edit: reference Vince Wilfork type bigmen 1% insignificant number. 

That's almost 2 kids per grade kid's elementary school. stopped lying could outlaw self defense, yes. That's popular position, suppose one option. good news many kids hospitals time school starts, kids attending classes room socially distance! total win! Nice job, Florida! urparentshouseinoregon1928 going damn thing stops protests. going TWO months people large parties streets 100s smashed together daily. half assed forces EVERYONE social distance wear masks. Something something elderly responded badly intensive care different care preferred humane reasons. I'm guessing testing limitations actual spread. positivity rate coming areas still pretty high. definitely something weird going numbers. MLS issues since they're outdoor sport well... soccer basically lot running around 60 minutes 90. games Orlando bubble, lots testing, positives since beginning tournament (two teams withdraw 24 fine), games 9:00 am, 8:30 pm, 10:30 pm. think they're lay blame obesity high number deaths, rather governments failures. Although believe obesity would significant factor death rate, also perhaps better time go ahead national health drive. Tell garbage government. No, really, I'm serious. want part US get choose. makes sick. Geobkocked. Aaaaand schools closed. Who’s say kids won’t long term heart damage? 99.99% chance happen. suggesting go lab say test positive get counted positive official tally? 

That’s dumbest shit ever heard. dinosaur bosses work tech need 'presenteeism' assured shit getting done, strutting around like bigshots. learn word ""usually"" means. That's people didnt like it. personal problem praised like highlight carrier. also praised diet even though openly said exercising eating 1000 calories day. height incredibly unhealthy shouldnt promoted especially music artist lits young girls follow Fucking love it! husband's job literally made everyone department pick *one* day week going come office work, continuing wfh days.

NBA okay well? see stuff bubble pass home page, seems like infractions caught time? Don’t expect see happen......the cost workers far high. Yup. BIL solid tech job that's letting WFH permanently. sold house (got asking price 24 hrs.) moved couple states away closer family. Much lower cost living, commute, steady job, WFH. win-win, baby. Cheers! I'll look one. last one saw Henry Ford one one felt far scientific. know anything one. indoor dining going perpetuate coronavirus need hide November. Like, I'd feel fine dandy. Moments later, I'd get chills I'd feel draining fatigue hit like brick wall, accompanied heavy breathing. Like could sitting chair, perfectly fine, I'd stop take deep breaths wipe sweat forehead, usually lead lay bit. Sure, sneezed coughed could almost *taste* ""cold"" ""flu"" taste, know mean. Really, initial symptoms would come go would ever slightly less extreme flu really hits sunbelt hardest December-February. won’t fix anything. Landlords often use rent cover mortgage. area expensive, don’t blame landlords. Taxes mortgages higher high-demand areas. NYC anywhere else East coast means it’s 1 Tuesday night sleeping hours ago. Canada always things right smh  investigate weekly deaths Florida much higher average?


Or hoping Snopes hire cracking internet hoax? Looks like learning suppressing information work. need start sharing number people ICUs. apologize, correct. I've made fool myself, I've also learned something, I'd say came ahead. :) Hah. optimism. literally behaviors 1918, despite hundred years advanced tech-wise.

Yes do, system much fragile susceptible disruptions.  can't trust Florida's numbers either. Fundies religious fundimentalists. edited original comment. Found this. Yeah really sad. think really needs mindset change difficult make. typical day need eat normal amount healthy food. every meal eat going amazing, even though amazing meal available (amazing much pizza fried chicken body hold followed ice cream half hour later).   
We also need re-do lot food supply. Everything fucking processed modified. try diet Whole 30 entire 30 days see 80% grocery store ""no-go"" zone. Two players accidentally broke bubble, Richaun Holmes stepping past ""campus line"" get order GrubHub, Bruno Caboclo broke it, leaving room initial quranatine. 


The Clippers players, due players leave bubble due family emergencies(this allowed, they'll need quarantine again), available first games. However, Clippers guard Lou Williams left family emergency, proceeded go Atlanta strip club, posted Instagram it. Literally first sentence **get good climbing**. Get good means starting somewhere good. Anyways would stupid get self defense training reading online forum instead practicing something irl like cardio climbing. Outside death, deserve every negative thing coming way. Nazis Trump cult certainly group deplorables Hillary talking about. Oh sure. I'm trying frame guys heros. come situation gun shot at, I'd least consider shooting back. 

In reality, I'd probably freeze and/or try hide. I've never even held gun know could live lifelong guilt would come taking life, even defense own. carry gun. go bars. go anywhere absolutely pandemic, etc.

Your life sounds lovely, though. gunlessness speak of? I'm starting make list potential relocation options...  say anything that? I’m pointing Federal agents Portland justified legal actions. 

Don’t straw-man can’t put actual argument. Yeah. Watch marketing hype boost share prices make politicians look like something. thanks im feeling better now! im really sorry :( feeling? think lot people wont care directly affects them. it’s selfish or, know, phone, tablet, second computer. seems foolproof /s people stupid.
