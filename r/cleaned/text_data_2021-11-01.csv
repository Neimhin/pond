Could explain advertised cost since charge government insurance provider. city Tokyo alone 14 million, single city alone higher population 46 US states. 

Japan's entire population ~126 million land that's smaller California population almost 40 million people. 

If anything lot harder control, people packed smaller area. vaccine affords sterling immunity worst outcomes (ICU, death), largely result adaptive immunity serendipity unchanging t-cell epitopes.

We also booster appears ward ""mild"" yet potentially arduous illness Delta (and associated transmission) great extent, mainly keeping antibody titers high.

So fuck CDC still fussily tweaking booster ""eligibility"" criteria (higher-risk work settings, BMI thresholds, mental illness) vaccine want every adult child take? 3rd dose vaccine exists plentiful supply &amp; downside beyond feeling like crap next day two? 

Why make adults eligible broadcast simple, unified message: ""Everybody get vaccinated, everybody get booster""? Easter 2023? sorry loss. Eh, lot liberal Americans place too. say European cautious pandmeic. hope they're recommended, I'd doubt it'd legally required long term. People treated badly fat. it‚Äôs good either claim it‚Äôs healthy overweight. see shift people consider healthy weight. many people risk group CV19 due heigh weight think not.

A Mediterranean diet cheap healthy. 

Millions poor Indians eating cheap healthy food everyday, without becoming overweight. sure, want standard American diet gets expensive, especially meat.

But general would say, everyone made food home, would easier eat healthy. never found first place.   long abide local rules, \*you\* want. feel bad wearing mask not, whatever makes happy. mask still reduces risk risk others, risk small.

I wear mask indoor public spaces cases; exception I'm going eat inside restaurant (since take off, anyway). Even then, lifted. Masks still required lot countries high vaccination rates. Well video linked featured writer isn‚Äôt party member elected twice National Assembly, highest body Cuban state, you‚Äôre saying patently untrue.

If nickel fat people told weren‚Äôt fat, muscular, I‚Äôd rich man. least I‚Äôd like $20+ today. Fun coincidence- too! got booster, ü§û something better nothing guess?  sure, starting decriminalisation drugs.

I think banning sugar going help. people always make food. really want sugar, get it. need help deserve deal addiction. interesting passage article. first time I‚Äôd heard it‚Äôs mutating rapidly flu. 

An unexpected change course SARS-CoV-2

So sudden, looked like SARS-CoV-2 mutating quite rapidly. Last month, Kistler colleagues University Washington published new metric measure quickly SARS-CoV-2 evolving adapts living inside humans. Kistler first saw value, shocked. ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2‚Äôs rate adaptation remarkably high right now,‚Äù says, ‚Äúlike roughly four times higher SARS-CoV-2 seasonal flu.‚Äù

Remember, flu changes fast people vulnerable year.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think SARS-CoV-2 stop adapting,‚Äù Kistler says. ‚ÄúIt may slow down, viruses evolve adaptively tend keep that. don‚Äôt tend hit limit evolution.‚Äù reward bad behavior? Start punishing them. Ban unvaccinated people age 18 without medical exemption flying outright. Start making events vaccinated only. didn‚Äôt want should‚Äôve done right thing chance.  Thanks, yeah I'm worried it. asking general question - real worthy concerns.... bad case flu first week March 2020, stayed home one day. whole week. shudder think many people infected then. never Alabama boys call Eric Two-toes now.  Highjackings one passively accept anymore. decades, guidance comply fight them, let go plane lands.

When highjackings turned 'let's make plane flying bomb', rules changed, people going sit back let happen. look 9/11, took three flights people figured let happen.   FL 2,770 dead per 1M pop.
PA 2,461 dead per 1M pop. Good point! Hadn‚Äôt thought that. can‚Äôt get see doc. that‚Äôs I‚Äôm self employed single parent marketplace ignores us. There‚Äôs affordable plan me. Oh thanks! Sorry error. thought upstate rules. Thank help.   Navy, ship San Diego provided three dumpsters. Food/general garbage, cardboard, metal. told uncertain terms anyone separate put correct dumpster would punishment.

I walking pier watched garbage truck load three dumpsters truck. using sticks mandates. Still nose swab around nostrils, don‚Äôt go past bone. 

If you‚Äôre UK swab tonsil well. think overall people quick dismiss actions mean little COVID. Whether 10% reduction 50% reduction, think impact something grows exponentially. hard ultimately quantify does, really easy people say screw it. said masks earlier. almost like Reddit love labeling things TSA security theater get chance... see backtracked later. masks protecting others. took months, science became clear masks protective qualities.

The way see people took COVID seriously ended least problems. mean always focus best solutions. China many Asian countries engaged lot security theater including mass spraying sanitizing roads, sidewalks, etc. mindset. might useless small impact, willing go whether lockdowns, mask wearing, sanitizing, testing, etc. shows willing get job done.

Here Reddit actually good portion America, see people hyper focused highlighting things work. Masks great example, also temperature scans. net result something overwhelmingly prevent COVID, treat like dumbest idea ever. kind ridiculing safety measures really got portion population that's still anti mask anti vaccine.

To culture mindset handle pandemic. illusion safety, see kinds industries situations. That's definitely I'd recommend, sounds like J+J plus MRNA booster offers best protection overall. sold 66% company 2016 rest two years ago. 

Major asshole sure though

That said new owners chief lobbyists last year raising federal minimum wage also assholes Shibuya like every year Halloween. 
The ward tried prevent last year successful, big turnout chaotic normal lot people still showed up. increase police presence well. 

There probably barely increase cases though. Thank you. still nose, mouth, what's different? swollen lymph nodes arm day depends department. Heard NYCHA (the dept. manages largest housing projects country, might even world) getting crushed mandate. obviously poor people already troubled. worry departments going get f'd forever see. got Moderna seriously knocked 24hrs wondering I'm planning getting booster someday. least 3 moderna shots probably offer strongest protection. thanks info man.  Im hearing 1 month unpaid medical leave. still vaccinated it‚Äôs classified voluntary separation ( aka company take quit ) It‚Äôs different    We've months carrot-offering get people inoculated. time sticks. NY actually mandates masks everyone 2 older daycares, nursery schools, K-12. article COVID. food-bourne. nasties are.

Stick done health insurance companies. vaccinated another $400 insurance per month. get needles arm. percentage known respiratory cases covid majority framed terms covid - another way say covid vaccine stops 5x hospitalizations immunized. Costco exactly way part, grandmas grandpas also consider trade offs reasonable.

The cost avoiding person (indoor) gatherings enormous. Humans social creatures many parts country, outdoor gatherings possible much year.

Most people don‚Äôt want mask forever. people don‚Äôt want avoid indoor dining forever. include elderly.

We reduce disease burden things improved vaccine technology improved ventilation.

 Ventilation something tech improve today, expensive (on societal scale‚Äîa home HEPA filter actually quite reasonably priced).

We focus tech solutions, painful NPIs. Clearly let know you‚Äôd like make bunch wagers. That‚Äôs point. Could also inactive ingredients changed ones used today deliver drug tested using stem cells? Husband got breakthrough cases. got booster last Saturday September, STILL caught tested positive October 21st. kid got school everyone house it. horrible. youngest eat 3 days coughing hard gasping air. Even vaccine, thought head going pop off, sinus pressure bad.

I'm expecting baby April I'm hoping that, one way another, there's herd immunity poor kids go back isolating protect baby. Oh fucking god sky news Australia abhorrent. really. work made us submit vaccination proof. enforce this, get people vaccinated, magnitudes valuable people half assed wearing masks stand next day pretty severe fever aches j&amp;j, I'm getting Moderna booster sometime next week. expect terms side effects? Anyone boat? I've seen cases come unvaccinated people, vaccine completely prevent infection transmission reduce noticeably. enough people vaccinated virus easily transmit anymore see raw case count drop low numbers anyway, saw late spring early summer. helpful professional probably even trying People nowadays young remember happened incident. remember shoe bomber (after shoes), lady baby liquid bomb components (no liquid brief PENS), rest.

So reasons, start immediately 9/11 shoes thing liquids... effective? Idk, responses take away options attempted attacks caught. Same, babies likely risk time possibly forever unless maternal vaccination turns particularly effective. AFAIK pediatric studies go 6 months. previous dean gifted wife daughter vehicles university bankroll. feel like could better.  China needs pay reparations.   allergies Covid? needs happen often.

Currently S√£o Paulo State (45 million population) 3.202 hospitalized COVID (1.556 ICU). months ago 31.1k hospitalized (and 13k ICU) also less half USA population. can't stand seeing anyone say bad things America like this.

Will vaccine still effective even though im delayed getting second shot? higher risk bad side effects? Unvaccinated adults, yes.

Unvaccinated kids actually lower risk symptomatic illness vaccinated adults. think players, fans    Wow. think one thing husband her.

Probably best go ahead marriage. account says restrictions forever. It‚Äôs broken record spouting worst case scenario fact. SII producing 220 million per month

Bharat Biotech producing 55 million per month set rise 100 - 120 million December end. 

Biological E set produce 100 million per month 

So add total number vaccines produced year, comes 220 \* 12 + 120 \* 12 + 100 \* 12 = 2640 + 1440 + 1200 = 5280 million doses 5.28 billion doses. 

So yes, 5 billion easily achievable. SII shall also producing Novovax number set rise further.  Children low risk covid, risk unvaccinated covid less vaccinated adult. can't keep making children wearing masks day end site, plastic barriers, social distance, live fear, risk 1000 times less risky senior.  never flu, children, covid much riskier flu. Yes, covid riskier, taking death hundreds year children covid vs flu vs hundreds thousands adults. big difference. irrational fear mongering point, gonna cause children much problems. example, obesity problem children skyrocketed COVID policy, kill long run covid itself.   Similar equating carbon emission talk tangible environmental reform. TSA security theater because, guess what? *They stop bringing weapons explosives onto fucking plane*

I don‚Äôt know many watched sun Comedy Central show what, use fucking critical thinking makes fucking sense.

As someone Singapore, clarify number imported cases (be Vaccinated Travel Lane otherwise) currently extremely low, compared \~3k+ community cases see daily basis since September. fully vaccinated international arrivals may exempted quarantine still take one two PCR tests upon arrival, say current surge due comparatively lenient border controls.

 Instead, would attribute differences Japan Singapore following:

Although 84% vaccine-eligible population completed full vaccine regimen (mainly Pfizer/Moderna), country seen large waves infections deaths prior vaccination programme subsequent reopening due previous Covid-zero approach. (The previous ""wave"" April-June 2020 mostly contained foreign worker dormitories.) such, vast majority country still relatively ""Covid-naive"". 

Meanwhile, reopening June-August already nearly six months elderly asked get vaccines (February-April). know antibodies obtained vaccination may decrease time, badly timed reopening affect quite number elderly, higher chance becoming severely ill dying due multiple co-morbidities (e.g. advanced age, long-term illnesses). Breakthrough Covid infections also struck quite number families, unable set aside spare room Covid-positive patients self-isolate home disproportionately affected Home Recovery Programme due living close quarters. There's logical end date mask, still mandates even vaccines availible half year. Covid never go away permanent endemic, either end masks now, end masks arbitarary date later consider risk ""acceptable"" (but people still dying covid entire life) wear masks anytime public rest life. hidden options. Since Covid life long, mandate masks now, there's logical reason can't literally mandate entire life, that's way live.  want live life afraid something 0.01% chance killing vaccine, fine, stop forcing rest us. 6/1 Yes understand food desert is. it‚Äôs still USA, get anything delivered nearly anywhere.

My interpretation last two years attest high exposure work/school. university told us email students count boosters along faculty staff. context, vaccine mandate puts us 98% vaccinated (limited exceptions cover rest), in-person class sizes capped 50, follow DC mask mandate. Also, DC high vaccination rate.

If situation counts high-risk anything counts.

Because according WHO, every booster given rich country takes shot away people Africa, something. Well CDC can't exceed FDA approval.

And FDA advisory panel threw hissy fit ol Joe announced everyone needed boosters them. ""prove independence"" voting boosters everyone. fine, also thought ""sent wrong message"" vaccine efficacy unvaccinated, mostly agreed rich countries boosters (obeying 3 month moratorium asked likely dragging feet much anyway).

Then approved 65+ FDA reminded recommendation could rejected called unofficial straw poll incredibly broad categories everyone else seemed like compromise avoid public health implications overruling unanimous advisory vote.

Introduction 
A total 34 U.S. state governments imposed moratoria water shutoffs March May 2020 ensure equitable access water COVID-19 pandemic. However, end 2020, moratoria expired, millions people exposed risk water disconnections. study examines linkage water equity public health provides policy recommendations improving water access health equity. 
Methods 
Event study used analyze impact water shutoff moratorium COVID-19 daily infection growth rate daily death growth rate April 17, 2020 December 31, 2020. data collected state level. model controlled mask mandates, at-risk groups (percentage Hispanic population, percentage essential workers), percentage health insurance coverage. 
Results 
During study period, water shutoff moratorium place significantly lowered COVID-19 infection daily growth rate 0.235% significantly lowered death growth rate 0.135%. addition, comprehensive moratorium covering water systems (public private) significantly lowered infection growth rate 0.169% significantly lowered death growth rate 0.228%. 
Conclusions 
This study raises attention importance water equity need government actions create uniform protections water shutoffs across states. comprehensive approach water equity protect health safety communities. also doesn‚Äôt mention death rate. way run public service ‚Äî life saving public service

Right, best way run life saving service would first responders get vaccinated. United States, [this chart total Social Security recipients shows noticeable represents COVID deaths. Given size Social Security system US, that's ""holy shit"". natural immunity!"" worth losing job over.

Apparently feel differently. live US, I‚Äôm seeing people change minds, albeit slowly. I‚Äôm going remain hopeful people continue so. definitely case UK. restrictions lifted sharp increase cases many places NHS seems brink collapse. swear whole separate cultural hangup masks that's separate ""muh freedom"" BS. reasons sated out-loud masks place ""freedom"" one many. There's people claiming cut oxygen supply claiming somehow cause get infected germs over-and-over claiming (I love one) *God can't see face.*

In America bad people wear masks. People rob banks, stagecoaches trains cover nose mouth. treated suspicion fear. SE Asia there's ethic humility shyness wearing mask kind universal ""please leave alone"" signal people respect kind. America stirs something deep us that's visceral going beyond logic reason. People anti-mask consciously know fear masks make ""freedom"" arguments others lieu whatever deeper subconscious shit can't voice.

We also read lot facial expressions focused mouth eyes. common thing Americans greeting ""smile reach eyes"" see much elsewhere. can't facial expression mask on. mention S. Korea vaccinated 70% population. majority people vaccinated less half new infections breakthrough's, that's win vaccinations  Yea, Unfortunately seems 71% vaccinated Vermont even close herd immunity. Thanks information. usually outsource tech work lack vaccination risk factor developer dies gets sick covid. chime say Texas changed dramatically worse past couple years. I've loved state would defensive let's say 5-10 years ago. I'm also looking get here. People got extremely selfish mean. I'm hoping everywhere got like pandemic suspect I'm wrong humanity gone shit whole. where's George Costanza sack need him? satire dude mean writers Constitution slave owners? learned students Aristotle? Aristotle also justified slavery?

Yep, dedicated society guys. rich society is. Tbh, see virus becomes endemic manageable countries opening up? China's econmomy badly, citizens generally travel around within country.

I suppose main caveat that, countries built immunity infection, China's population going relatively susceptible covid diseases inevitably open up. There's something older generations raised makes think admitting wrong anything makes appear weak. would rather double wrong show they're strong opinions changed. grow parents view, that's tend grow well. think we're starting move away viewpoint, slow change.  Exactly. pandemic ends people stop treating like pandemic. it‚Äôs just, well‚Ä¶ unusually high number people dying. experts pretty mystified too. One theory I've heard lately virus Japan mutated way makes unstable unable spread much. It‚Äôs people twisting constitution much like people twisting religion.   it? Someone picking lost shifts overtime rates. point people virtually idea vaccines work, understand difference effect, would say no. Maybe years clinical trials widely published results (yeah, cant google exists now). mind you, that's case they'll alive years. level ignorance frankly alarming here. think probably happens, still might bumps think they've ""pretty good"" people like Fauci making decisions someone else PR background communicating decisions people. Let's take hypothetical scenario parent August decide sending 5-year old kid person school Kindergarten homeschooling. would base decision [CDC guidelines K-12 

A parent can't read come almost anything actually keep kids getting infected. Schools require kids crammed together without masks times like lunch can't redo ventilation systems. CDC's first bullet point also stating utmost importance kids face face school, COVID mitigation efforts come second purely based priority. also use lot weasel words like ""should"" know able actually require anything, states ignore guidelines CDC publishes.

In general though, even read that, majority things parents control pie sky ideas written someone obviously children schools right now. Maybe misunderstood term soaring?Does mean something different US? would use describe describe case numbers increasing fast rate. may case European countries definitely case UK........ think novavax better accepted? thought we‚Äôre waiting antivaxxers die off? point reach herd immunity masks come off. live Bible Belt. I've heard grumblings un-vaccinated people pissed get shot lose job. One guy said came close quitting thinks economy edge right great time look work new guy company always gets ax things go bad. know couple people going pursue medical exemptions we'll see far goes. know vaccinated people (including FWIW) grumbling still feels like giant reach I'm fond employer calling doctor getting medical information me. work remotely norm industry. heard employers like they've wanting mandate (to avoid higher healthcare costs) want employees angry them. employees angry Biden employers completely fine with. aways money, nobody cares alive.

Glad agree lying data. covid already island ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs island, keep easier‚Äù argument doesn‚Äôt apply.

Ofc without incentive, imo whatever gets stragglers finally what‚Äôs needed incentive wise. Wyoming.

Why? know people went party? baffles me. know monoclonal antibody treatments Covid? They‚Äôve news; doctors ostrich strategy dealing pandemic. one states implied, agreeing point. Yeah that's silly! heard number people vaccinated grumbling it.

Misuse sick leave terminable offense. let‚Äôs say open 10k cases per day. cases obviously rise 10k, close point? 1300+ deaths day US, still, I'd say 80% people grocery store (just outside Philadelphia) wearing masks. wanna wear one, do. majority thankfully sympathy unvaccinated (and risk kids low) going let ruin lives restrictions. keep burning thru small smaller population till gone minor pain rest us care. read hing reported none companies involved cell line say came from. countries left strict rules using tissue abortions. 

Which raises odds donated tissue miscarriage. puts squarely organ donation territory, one could argue refusing it, gift given vain China state news knows trust.  58 percent whole population. 68 percent eligible Gonna run sick days real fast. ‚ÄúGet move forward. never happened. shock much never happened.‚Äù -Don Draper...

Seriously, realize start getting back stop anxious. I've made effort get back harder I'm happier 2019 sad ever 2020. stopped giving shit clear best way live. Well put way, seems pretty obvious. company sets deadline prior Dec 8th. even arent done yet still weeks. friend works place method. don‚Äôt know reminded guy used work ‚Äúsick‚Äù days row‚Ä¶ apparently kidney problems something. don‚Äôt think remembered/realized company wide walking challenge watch automatically uploaded steps. getting like 12k+ day days ‚Äúsick‚Äù out-walking everyone challenge. furious work out. confronted said laps around house never got trouble blatantly lying. eventually get fired sadly couple years later transferred different dept couldn‚Äôt take working POS anymore. think people know felony and/or think they'll get caught. companies thousands tens thousands employees. Microsoft example government vendor 100k employees US. There's way HR department manually checking every single card right? Misleading headline.

‚ÄúRoughly 2,300 members New York City Fire Department claimed sick show work Monday city's COVID-19 vaccine mandate municipal workers went effect. 

All city workers required received least one dose vaccine October 29. City leaders suspect many roll sleeves feigned illness avoid disciplined failing comply health requirement. Roughly 9,000 municipal workers put unpaid leave Monday failing meet deadline comply COVID-19 mandate, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said.‚Äù Here‚Äôs memorial firefighters died nationwide:

[COVID 19 firefighter  Achieving one thing, maintaining length time another. may made sense temporary policy country could get population vaccinated, viable long term policy. home county virus dead October 2020 July 2021. counties briefly snuffed multiple times. 

The challenge prevent coming back in. tried. residents coastal islands New Jersey tried sealing 2020 without government support. 

The protocols mass testing completely foreign American society. far know done. goal simply verify ""no one entire group covid"" price per sterile swab $0.20. Think ""every person entering workplace"" ""every person entering store"", ""everyone came church Sunday"". small number asymptomatic people fairly easy narrow could be. Regardless finding carrier groups fully negative relax. 

Airplanes fairly easy. Swab everyone boarding. airlines like reassure travelers. test protects destination city. plane loads angry passengers get quarantined. 

Motor vehicles much difficult swab. highly disruptive traffic like toll station. Commercial traffic commuters would test weekly sides border clear. 

Some technologies like sewer sampling sensors could facilitate rapid response covid19 slips through.  narrow ""someone neighborhood flushed covid"" expensive give everyone PCR test. Sniffer machines also tested may much less invasive nasal swab. Kaiser private.

I use home tests get back us, come $30 each. go Canada work can‚Äôt find acceptable test 72 hour results aren‚Äôt $150. Working Media means shit health insurance. Best schedule meeting today, cdc director sign tomorrow, right? spreading around, catch COVID even safe. 

If always going spreading around, come time susceptible hospitalization/death it.

You comment myopic. ""i'm fine now, therefore always fine"" really shallow thinking. FDNY union bosses deny sickout vaccine mandate.    completely useless, high precision either.

Besides recordkeeping issues (was dose 1 dose 2?), there's also matter population statistics used compute percentages amazingly precise. 

Vaccine tourism (people visiting US elsewhere got shots) may also factor. easy talk big game. also easy arrange ""not sick-out"" sick-out.

When deadline comes mandates it'll handful actually follow through. like NYPD: understanding point article. It‚Äôs winding months. article, like things related pandemic, extremely late.  people see wrong character flaw vs opportunity become better. There‚Äôs nothing wrong wrong, it‚Äôs grow human beings. That‚Äôs thought. really similar viewpoints, story much aligns own. I'm pro-vaccine anyone wants recommend people need it. trust immune system comes covid, data says healthy people age 27 basically get hospitalized, rarely. yeah soon 3rd booster shot reality, Israel already case coronapass valid without booster shot. 

And comes coronapass, minister health literally stated national TV restaurants, gyms never able ask someone coronapass sort, thing ever happen government allow it. 6 months later reality, people barely bat eye. Consider lucky live Sweden friend. currently can't go gym, restaurant, cinema bar without test every single day. soon change german system negative test wont sufficient anymore. Basically I'm excluded society whilst I'm healthy be. 

And true hard productive conversation people Reddit. real life I've open discussions people people never aggressive online. Right there's lot polarization going here, pinning vaccinated people vs unvaccinated people. Blaming everything unvaccinated people, reality way nuanced. clue cause don‚Äôt monitor anymore vaccinated. allow get booster, get booster. continue go work live life. It‚Äôs safe say, rights China. thought vaccinated quarantine exposed long symptoms. could ship Antarctica moon someplace, I'd okay vaccinating them. really care health anymore, spread disease others. hope gets better soon. Yea poor vaccine procurement huge let down, vax supply suspect Christmas we'll 95% vaccinated 12s ü§û

*sigh*

I need move Australia. part pisses off. tried ask nicely threw temper tantrum. we‚Äôre sick coddling adult children. I‚Äôm ready move past this, yet petulant whiners refuse let us. Except public health officials don‚Äôt think way. long number cases deem concerning, restrictions stay. Even cases aren‚Äôt metric concern. I've checked three major retail pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid) today far, still allowing appointments booked anyone 12. Maybe approved CDC, they'll update site scheduler allow it. Personally, think attitude ""You whatever want be"" attitude mixed with, ""You gotta gotta yourself. Fuck rest"".

America's attitude culture devolved individualism self preservation stewing everyone else over. Idk got bad, seems things are.

Personally long sense togetherness community. dont even anymore. interesting polar opposite America China

In America individuality personal freedom essence existence, China social harmony stability taught accepted important personal freedoms  disagree. stating ""start point"" same, mean comes scenario get there. tad large size TBH, thought, first use beginning sway different direction.

I think olive oil helped Either guy shoved lightbulb butt colon good idea.  think something. locales, mask mandates stay CYA local health officials untill 100% unfollowed, forgotten about, quietly rescinded. ... I'd like jf unvaccinated nutcases would wear masks too. get Depends live. Pzifer vax / pzifer booster. husband felt practically nothing booster. feverish, achy night shot #2, didn‚Äôt get #3. totally fine.

My side effect really swollen sore lymph nodes arm pit shot arm. I‚Äôm 72 hours it‚Äôs going away now. painful really, tender sore weird feeling. Husband didn‚Äôt get all. Individuality.

We ingrained concept personal freedom = caring ones self we're indoctrinated become narcissistic selfish assholes day one.

I guarantee significant portion population even know social contract is, huge part formation constitution. inalienable rights, rights bestowed upon us birthright, participation cooperation society services all. That's *lose* certain rights privileges convicted felony, broke social contract.  booster hitting like ton bricks compared first two. headache chills didnt sleep well all. people reporting side effects though YMMV Inaccurate data doesn‚Äôt mean government lying hospital beds problem. Based nursing sub patient medical personnel ratios insane. want work there... Like what? evidence prove it‚Äôs wrong? think two things. One, significant number pro-vaccine people also pro-masking, OK masking care enough actually show protest it. And, two, even areas high vaccine uptake still nominal mandates certain circumstances not-insignificant chunk population fully vaccinated largely gone back normal done quietly without fanfare ignoring remaining mandates. longer mask 95% time places would strictly masked year ago, also care throwing one particular business strictly requiring it. would say describes me... took everything seriously, triple-vaccinated, longer masking someone asks I'll throw one want jerk.  *vague platitude little article* 

Top comment! Lol anonymous people get mad reddit, care. want everyone get vacced, choice now, vaxxed booster shot, would rather live Republican state, dont wear god awful mask, despite liberal nearly every issue. hate wearing masks much.  broke leg 2 years ago, would rather go wearing masks another year. know tolerate more, I'm one them. I'm happy taking trivial risk covid unmasked vaccine booster, wish overlords would let me. bad I'm basically stuck here. Hopefully nonsense ends so. think Delta surge, expanding slower rate (a pyramid rather huge spike) due high rates vaccination populous counties. whole picture mystery sure. Tourism up, overwhelming numbers. Ah, sorry. read wrong way around vaccines around months months mandates started popping up. shit-for-brains excuse, then? yeah, think cops wanted firefighters! Now's chance! Story stress ‚Äúessential‚Äù workers face DAILY

Sadly, one employee snapped couldn‚Äôt handle preassure getting complaints customers dont want wear mask, demand close customer service, million nonsensical covid reasons.
- employee immune compromised.

On day, anti-vax/masker thought would good idea joke employee still social distancing, calling weird, paranoid, fired, demand better customer service, etc. Sadly joking manager (me). response is, job keep safe. anti-vax like stating employees fault paranoid baby towards person fully vaccinated dont need mask.

I responded back something along lines ‚Äú person severely weakened immune system higher chance contracting dieing covid-19. put hand‚Äôs stranger essentially says ‚Äô Trust im vaccinated ‚Äò without garuntee safe. anything keep selves safe like social distancing fireable offense dont get interaction want.

We improved state yes, threat still there. everyone condition respectful. asked.

Come without mask dont surprised protective measures, come expecting fight dont surprised pushback.

Covid-19 doesn‚Äôt disapear got shot. threat community thing individual thing.  meant large majority still unvaccinated Moderna booster initial J&amp;J shot. got around 6pm morning felt little sore hungover. noon progressed fever, chills, fatigue, bit nausea. could operate well enough get lunch took day work early nap dinner. mostly clear next day. mask prevent onward transmission vaccination does.

This patently false. Vaccines reduce rate infection viral load breakthroughs occur also lead faster viral clearance. *far* effective reducing transmission mask. effects shot previous two. first two sore arm ever slight fatigue 2nd. shot made tired next day (my shot 1pm previous day). felt slight nausea, didn‚Äôt really want eat, sore arm (more fore. Lasted days) slight headache that‚Äôs all. really transient though gone 24 hours. dad got moderna first two even lighter mine stronger response booster fatigued days ran fever went away.  Sounds like apply job running TSA. Thanks.  wondering many Americans think died yesterday many new cases??  don‚Äôt think anyone knows exactly CO surging right now. It‚Äôs probably combination things: relatively low vaccination rate, colder weather driving folks indoors, relaxed attitudes due pandemic fatigue, possibly population got hit relatively easy previous surges. Fdny probably applicants department. leaves solution. red flu Down? We'd wipe thing overnight! tests = cases = COVID eradicated. Checkmate, liberals.  Two weeks stop spread. anyone describe experience symptoms boosters? opportunity take tomorrow also exams need prepare for/take. really want deal symptoms studying taking exams. 80% adult population partially vaxxed need move away case numbers metric move toward hospitalizations something defining.

The vast majority breakthroughs super mild. at-risk populations getting third shots. It‚Äôs metric case numbers year ago. get analogy, it‚Äôs quite right scenario would argue mask prevent onward transmission vaccination does. maybe, rather using seatbelts, better comparison might turning lights night? Yeah, I've noticed that. doesn‚Äôt. people threaten sick protest mandate. 

Injuries sick never been. Funny, back kids argument ""finish peas; kids Africa starving!"" we're supposed opposite shunning elective booster vaccines, another perishable commodity. flu never went away. actually kills thousands people year. Covid eventually become less innocuous we‚Äôre lucky, stuck anti-vaxxers countries don‚Äôt access vaccine. evolves virulent strain fucked. list words phrases auto-modded here? Sometimes post comment gets flagged can‚Äôt figure even said would cause it. never said I'm fine always fine. simply said I'm concerned future infections - I'm not.

If time ever comes I'm immunocompromised, take different precautions. unconcerned future infections mutually exclusive. Especially state health likely 30 years future going family history. many months get vaccine mandate. Therefore must fear. Becareful saying here. board crucify lol. yes, agree. Right now, I'm secretly rooting anti vax side win. got vaccine, got booster, want get back living, right now, pro vax side trying stop that, anti vax. vaccine mandate members parliament, sack. I'm that. look around thread people pulling random numbers many deaths ‚Äúfeel‚Äù had. Replace ""vaccines"" ""preexisting immunity"" find people disagree. point. Even Australia abandoned Covid Zero. It‚Äôs realistic places larger Taiwan. going start protesting vaccine requirements children attend school? military requirements? 

When morons realize vaccine mandates occurring since 1776 especially George Washington? country doomed stupidity. Yes...it's toxic muddle scientific rigor, political maneuvering, clumsy attempts social engineering turns that's crazymaking counterproductive. plays right hands cynics claim government feckless arbitrary, use undermine scientific consensus. Appreciate response! Makes feel better, easy get wrapped worst case scenario mindsets. far smell taste sticking around. 3-4 days feels reasonable. one happy. media already done damage. pro vaccine people even entertain idea body's immune system capable fighting covid, people get covid survive fine. anti Vax people belive covid hoax. go forever 1 side snaps. Covid entered Taiwan , even USA. Test-Trace-Quarantine, root virus anyone wasn‚Äôt contact continue lives normally. Vaccine make even easier wouldn‚Äôt need lockdown. 

Taiwan going relax boarder restriction soon. quarantine program continue , ultimately combat infectious diseases. ""on hold"", certainly normal either. People keep talking ‚Äústart living.‚Äù don‚Äôt get it. never stopped living. family stopped somethings replaced equally enjoyable things. Life never stopped. agree, risk contracting always non-zero number. I'm wondering number need hit us still wearing masks distancing finally feel comfortable easing boundaries. sing weekly group (fully vaccinated) people includes many elderly; can't say ""I'm confident I'll get mild case I'm infected, I'm throwing masks away hugging strangers now."" sure would like start feeling safe again. (PS hug strangers pandemic pretty sure I'm going start even if/when.) Unfortunately states Australia abandoned Covid Zero now. two biggest states, NSW Victoria essentially resigned living covid latest outbreaks became uncontained.

SA QLD still relatively Covid free, however already announced plans open christmas. WA (where live) still Covid-Zero holding reopening (And restrictions within state except hard borders wanting travel states) although rumors open around Feb, premier taking patient approach things may delay far June wear mask; I'm stopping you. I'm tired wearing subway every day hours end airports planes. Yes, it‚Äôs purely matter ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell do‚Äù, think holding force mayor cancel mandate score win Republicans. happy threaten community safety petulance.  Fuck carrot, stick. (Sorry. anger isn‚Äôt directed you, anti-vaxxers.)

Either offer blanket condition anyone got vaccinated, don‚Äôt offer all. shouldn‚Äôt incentivizing ignorant selfish asshole paying people it.  immunity one shot brings someone lot closer safety someone two shots safety someone zero shots. spent moronic amount effort focusing one shoters rather people skipped vaccination altogether. Makes sense, indoors. happens three weeks? Get Covid somewhere outside country? Nah. It‚Äôs good transit. Amount dipshits past would open air sneeze tells I‚Äôd love masks permanent public transit. ehhh changing mind experienced personally? naah me. I'm looking info give family member.

I two shots Pfizer eligible third one now. cases test. mouth God's ears. hope similar experience! Otherwise, idk I'll go boosters going forward. terrifyingly ill. given likely COVID (before testing available), far worse shape J&amp;J shot. Care elaborate?  Pilot gets drunk gets bar fight coworker stupid shit. can't blame company preferring careful sober pilots. Haha! shocked got message asked ok concerned redditor reached concern. numbers could call needed therapy nonsense. Like, thanks reddit. Wonder it‚Äôll work time.

I'm sorry loss - think right give single shit wellbeing smooth-brained drains society. choice take vaccine not. ridiculous thing ask all; literally half planet one dose.

I'm reasonable accommodations work catering toddler logic pandemic continue reasonable.   mean want them? working job glorious reason? course want 20 get pension. job. dangerous job. 20 fine mentality. Yeah. :/ talking restricting interstate travel, I‚Äôm talking quarantining close contact known cases. BASIC combating infectious diseases, yet nobody bother it. 

People keep trying complicate this, need trace known cases , quarantine close contacts , test contacts find known cases trace. Even allowing slippage due people dishonest, root virus long time. method known , it‚Äôs proven work , nobody bother  Get lawn whippersnapper! back day... :) Since firefighters paid taxes, makes socialists, right? Otherwise they'd go work private EMTs. large portion population telling heroes simply job chose. me, respect something earned given, seems many feel way ...and yet tons people issue accepting masks pre-vaccines telling YES, problem inconvenience lives. 

You course want hear that, easier assume people issues masks wacko Q anon political reason. Found HR executive, everyone! You‚Äôre friend, matter many pizza parties throw. mask (gaps) fit. masks (and surgicals) fog glasses pretty bad, (like Dr. Puri KN94's) fog all. 100% correct.

Typically good pay, plus pensions start 20 years employment. I've known retired 50 got rich, keep getting paid covered insurance. Oh even get started. switched contacts 100% issue, especially wear masks outside sports. 

Everyone tries give tip soap glasses, anti-fog spray, whatever, straight lying. Nothing helps. injured FDNY it‚Äôs referred medical sick leave. one called CVS, Walgreen, Walmart, Rite Aid ( Cal ).

They clue.

So sure get shipment anytime soon. could wrong.  would hope could simple effective strategy winter. 

\- Focus solely vaccinations

\- Set requirements federal money flowing. Examples

1. Required Medicare coverage (or treat COVID covered non-vaccinated people). gets 65 crowd
2. Requirements colleges receive financial aid
3. Requirements federal workers contractors

After wonder choice vaccines masks. heading pre-delta, need little tighter mandates. Yes except Taiwanese we‚Äôre 100% wearing masks 100% time.  Lots places give much PTO. Calling ""sick days"" might bit misleading wrapping PTO options.  get new vaccine doesn‚Äôt long term (years) studies done

Wrong misinformation. 

So vaccine mandate. arent argue good faith kindly g f y. cavalry coming, decisions predicated something near steady state. me, particularly got booster, prompts accept bit risk, mainly I‚Äôm comfortable now, I‚Äôm basically saying won‚Äôt several years, maybe forever.‚Äù

This perfectly sums attitude past several months. way world now, foreseeable future probably beyond. still staying home, avoiding activities, etc. point, better prepared essentially rest life. could case much change long, long time now. may less scared 3 years today. like jobs ""force"" wear clothes ""force"" work get fired. Pathetic. oh no, cannot infringe ‚Äúpersonal liberty‚Äù even one bit nothing done even lockdown. 

I understand throwing ""personal liberty"" quotes, literally law restrict travel states US. major component Australian restrictions never going possible here. went vaccines.gov tried every single non mainstream pharmacy mainstream stores like CVS Walgreens don‚Äôt live yet. managed find locally owned pharmacy hour appointments. Yes - barring medical reason.

They made using animal products, one used animal testing development (astrazeneca) - think religious exemptions given. bet never even thought visiting Taiwan , restrictions not.

I October 2019 loved it, want go back see more. long quarantine arrival.  I'll worry drunk drivers getting accidents holiday season. large indoor crowds (ie: concerts), I've mostly resumed ""normal"" life since getting second shot. I'm getting booster Friday expect continue things enjoy winter long. wear mask certain indoor situations, overall figure either vaccine going bolster immune system won't. indications worked fine. 

If city surge winter, I'd mask often, that's probably limit daily routine changes I'd make.  remember people making arguments wearing seatbelts helpful dangerous accidents. Eventually ton actuarial data make seatbelt laws. 

People don‚Äôt like change constrained, won‚Äôt accept evidence.  day getting worse lol. See new edit. one forced anything. choice get vaccinated, choose to, they'll leave. Jobs ""force"" make choices like time, usually one protests them.   Hey problem. good day. school kids, No, always segment population vaccinated due medical reasons. school kids, Yes, always segment population vaccinated due medical reasons help protect kids. ...jesus christ, hope trolling. also depends state. CDC CDC director likely support today.

My state two additional layers shots go out. states none. worst case likely Th/Fr.

Pharmacies likely able give pediatrician offices, depending supplies allocated. kind COVAXs fault, though. Bill Gates one biggest supporters COVAX repeatedly stated TRIPS waiver persued. COVAX never supported TRIPS waiver real damage movement drawing attention away main problem subverting activist energy. COVAX failing deliver promises predictable start matter accountable anything. Sure, good, I'd argue harm. 
 
How much article read?  replied wrong person. blame old age stupidity.

EDIT: what's worse replied right person misunderstood comment. Duh.  job?  could go try make them. No? China administered 2B doses far. target population less half billion they‚Äôd 100% coverage already. get poster said ‚Äúadult‚Äù population, age distribution isn‚Äôt heavily young. 70% adult population (whatever consider adult) closer billion half billion. point view living Colorado. lot rural counties mixed Urban. Northern Colorado regional hospital services surrounding states. walk grocery stores almost 50/50 mask compliance. feel people care anymore. state surrounded deserts better time dealing first waves. drive around areas like covid longer here. least that's people treating it
There lot people aware covid taking serious. pretty much mixed bag around here. Donated making criminal offense, puts poor people justice system nothing solve problem. rich skirt away scot-free like always poor (those typically less education, less access resources get vaccinated) suffer most. Please, ICUs full enough, need add burn victims Yeah, family members &amp; friends plans vaccinate kids; really frustrating. 

Any idea full approval 12-15 year olds come? good friend moving goal posts getting kids vaccinated finally settled waiting full approval, believe either. freaked poor kids pandemic, get vaccinated, pushing anti-vaccine husband vaccinated, vaccinated. nice protected (allegedly), extend protection children - one severe asthma allergies. Since Mexico would interest keeping people quarantine would keep illegal migration minimum too. like America couldnt enforce security borders wanted to. since live Europe think illegal immigration problem little bigger deal dont think would terrible keep borders closed 3 weeks. since neccesary registered infected state may even neccesary enforce closed border. neccessary collective good human race outweighs needs couple hundred illegal immigrants. get anyway easily found almost empti streets prosecuted.

Its funny think completely closed border 2 countries unthinkable option death suffering millions people world wide acceptable. use example: super nasty car accident wake operating room surgery fuse two vertebra keep paralyzed. pull airway tell surgeon, ""are ALIF TLIF procedure, I've read Facebook questions need research make mind.""  Oregon go Western States Scientific Study Workforce governor's office/OHA. 

For Moderna boosters took extra day steps. likely same. This. work home laptop I'm feeling 100%. lives lost, maybe less perfect code written it. I'd prefer put somebody else life jeopardy feeling best day. one job really want bring A-game.

I feel like it‚Äôs duty children society, part reduce harm all. Vaccines don‚Äôt cause long term side effects outside couple months chances minuscule they‚Äôll develop reaction won‚Äôt resolve short term.

The challenge wild infections detecting much protection still it. get really expensive compared vaccines.

From article:
‚ÄúAt time, FDA-authorized approved test providers public use reliably determine whether person protected infection.‚Äù guess I'm lucky. get drinks, expense Uber. Hey, look, another person obsessed idea COVID kill absolutely victims, allows him/her ignore point!

Dude, *give condition* order lower chances getting condition later. That's idiotic.

And decapitation nice, colorful way illustrating that. importantly, chosen because, unlike natural COVID immunity, decapitation actually reduces chances ""reinfection"" 0%. So, analogy shows optimistic wishful thinking pushing natural immunity superior still nonsense.

I could put mathematical terms.

The expectation random variable sort ""average outcome"" variable. Formally, integral x*p(x) dx sum x*p(x), value variable times probability getting value, summed integrated depending whether continuous discrete.

For example, I'm baseball team, 20% chance score 0 runs, 20% chance score 1 run, 20% chance score 2 runs, 4 runs (this baseball runs distributed, I'm giving simple distribution make easy illustrate), expectation value game .2*0 + .2*1 + .2*2 + .2*3 + .2*4 = 2 runs. played 100 games, I'd get average 2 runs per game, I'd expect get close 200 runs total. Expectation values useful looking random variables lots draws.

The expectation value serious COVID cases among vaccinated people less 1. (This reasonable assumption, given every damned study vaccines have.)

Suppose ""natural immunity"" confers perfect protection disease (it doesn't, pretend does).

The expectation value *exactly 1* case! (And symptoms worse, unvaccinated.)

Mathematically, exactly decapitation example. People cut heads expect number decapitations lives less 1. People *do* chop heads get certain number, 1 decapitation. one fits, exactly, *best case scenario* natural immunity.

And still worth it.

And reality expectation value COVID cases via natural immunity greater 1, whereas less 1 vaccines.

Very simple math. Saw post morning remind vaccinated people still spread COVID.

Vaccines work, work better masks. inject UV light bleach something. trick. risks likely higher mine ~40 major health issues. 

But let‚Äôs honest: us it‚Äôs matter if, it‚Äôs when. try want, endemicity means it‚Äôs going anywhere.  shocking revelation. No, not. thoroughly proven common knowledge TSA beyond useless. cause way damage simply existing, destroying people's properties (through negligence otherwise) straight stealing stuff money   Breakthrough cases childhood cases still frequently damage IQ sense smell.

At least 20% people experience viral anosmia, virus, never fully recover. viruses high 34%. We'll see Covid goes.

IQ loss unhospitalized cases still high.

How future whole generations Covid survivors dumber can't enjoy flavors look? Good restaurant industry? Good health people enjoy sweet, salty fatty? Good jobs progress?

Pediatrician saying there‚Äôs need hurry get kids vaccinated covid 19. Covid 19 complications healthy children less common flu. suggest wait additional vaccine studies.

But there's many non-tech solutions would make people's everyday lives better too. Universal paid sick time, example, would help many young people avoid going work places like restaurants they're sometimes serving elderly. stronger culture looks coming work sick instead celebrating sign ""hard work"" ""dedication"". fostering culture people least wear mask personally they're feeling sick go would help protect others without something everyone do.

I'm trying clarify, first time I've heard someone received two doses considered fully vaccinated. pretty stupid question. major news outlet Australia used word multiple times neutral factual news story. consider maybe word different meaning Australia?  would prefer people stay home sick. would far effective wearing masks. Covid far transmissible. last years basically one year want call boosters, sure. Yeah, need end game risk populations. remaining isolation accordance CDC guidelines (we outdoors stuff now, though), zero messaging risk people live ever supposed re-enter society. get ""get vaccinated"" ""if risk, follow guidelines unvaccinated"". There's ramp.   author Atlantic article hilariously hawkish bat talking China. essence said ""America fucked we're everlastingly fucked, China used 'brutality' control pandemic!""

It's like dog, China done half bad America, would've lost 1.5 million. Let sink fuck in.

China reporting 5000 deaths. normalized mean you? Congrats! safe two weeks second shot. Don‚Äôt change habits yet.    thanks... right well business expense - problem solved! Yes!! illness droplet spread people gross. Omg  Cure boredom, least. I've traveled east Asian countries. Mask wearing norm. People wear masks sick wear air quality poor. wear masks time. want wear mask rest life, it. try convince anyone normal anywhere. Exactly. Maybe plexiglass won‚Äôt much covid, sure would appreciated worked retail terms customers sneezed coughed you. One girl knew woman sneeze face coated mucous. Keep plexi IMO.  article seems less saying,  
""AY.23, variant predominantly seen Singapore, found Sarawak.""

I know might Asian studies really filtered English speaking world yet something, I'm aware convincing evidence AY.23 actually worse regular Delta. 

The prevalence AY.23 subsequently AY.23.1 Singapore makes pretty odd graph, variants able really demonstrate growth advantage country well developed Delta wave already, far see.  
Malaysia's graph convince there's advantage AY.23 either.  So‚Ä¶ fluorescent light bulb suppositories?  It‚Äôs nearly enough. Setting standard clear goal would wonders. Say 80% must vaccinated lift restrictions. Hospitals low capacity, cases stable increasing. bad republicans anti vaxx part cult personality now. article right idea, half nation sane.   Nope. Australia.

However, ""rooting team"" means something completely different. China red herring, india one likely horribly undercounting deaths tune multiple millions   care eligibility. walk get shot. $$$$$$

Simple that. still think there‚Äôs going 2025? also talk closing bathrooms? Uh‚Ä¶ yeah. one really irks one-way arrows.

So actual mandate then.  two weeks though? /screams void/ FYI using ""immunocompromised"" lie result getting full dose Moderna that's got first time (and got Pfizer, get another Pfizer). immunocompromised people get 3rd shot, booster shot. Moderna 3rd shots 100ug like 1st two, can't mix match like booster shots.

A lot people say they're immunocompromised specifically that's want, aware case wanted half dose booster mix match. ""Good News"" Yes is, there's added billing modifier also assessed illness... cost thousands  Florida also need share numerous teachers support staff schools died result failure vaccinate lack masking. Scary. *sure* eligible? media made criteria seem narrow is.

74% adults qualify BMI alone... thin, then...

-Any mental health issue including depression ADHD

-Current former smoker

-Any substance use issue (any marijuana use, alcohol use BAC goes 0.08- typically 4 drinks skinny guy, 3 woman)

-High blood pressure

-Asthma

-Diabetes

Then still qualify medically, qualifying job also defined broadly. Basically unless work home stretch definition cover it. interact unvaccinated people, that's qualifying job.

You take look data (both totals per 100k people)  US is, since we're depraved nation. local celebrity say care 50 percent population dead. That's bold statement, way people think. could make fortune patent body fat vaccine! hidden options.

""Russia moves CDC's highest risk travel category""  Almost guaranteed CDC meeting started yet. Ok technically correct hospitalizations one group kids verses.  risks ridiculously adult risks point ain't worth worring either them. Thats meant talk about, correct, one child risks lower other, small fraction risks groups. hospitalizations, deaths. Deaths numbers really start skew.  Child deaths high hundreds since COVID started, making risk dying covid less risk drowning, really put risk comparison. contrast, 700,000 unvaccinated adults died COVID, 8000 vaccinated adults died COVID USA. mean, chart sent sets children floor everyone else well above, that's hospitalizations, deaths numbers skewed even before. keep mind, infants 6 months, even best case probably never get vaccinate, protecting kids young standard low risk, reason ever remove restrictions.

The pushback I'm seeing lately highly vaccinated liberal areas people embraced masks early pandemic, longer see need point universal mandate. needs metrics place, end point places performing better due high vaccination rate, still strictest restrictions.  clear, companies currently corporate mandates. Biden order relates private businesses 100+ employees released OSHA yet. IfYou see, cause disruption
in working area. visualize
this, would make changes areas
and make disruption placement for
the Employer, possibly.  Europe US failed basic trace quarantine. USA even failed get people accept masks necessary lockdowns. done still fails maybe point. stands country pursuit continue able keep covid impact minimum. I'm sure longitudinal data encourage behavior shift. perspective data denier easy construct new roadblocks enforce existing ideas, even light new data.

I could much see someone presented long-term data simply state something like, ""Ok, *who* conducted research? Vaccinated people agendas, trust it."" Covid-19 pretty much endemic point. Sweden basically moved returned normal living. understand stance vaccination stops spread prevailing one. I'm going go depth arguing post probably gets deleted. leave saying science effective vaccinations limiting spread long effectiveness last seem crystal clear. 

 clear however vaccination primarily something protection. based decision whether needed protection looking countries statistics. looked people age. Also fitness maniac. working entire life top shape. Used close elite level rowing. Yes everyone get sick risks still vary greatly depending fitness level, obesity, underlying conditions etc.

 That's Swedish governments website tracking Covid-19 deaths. scrolling bit page diagrams male (green) female (purple) number deaths various age brackets. 

 Yes risks death Covid-19 well going post bunch statistics link. enough one posted. China seen subsequent waves infection like South Korea Japan? Every single nation actually tests significant numbers seen multiple waves. Either China testing, somehow found magic solution prevent additional waves infection country has. arguing second, would love know secret is. zero COVID. small island nation strict restrictions. unrealistic expect example US maintain nationwide strict restrictions. matter discipline. Nobody anything wrong starting live life again. safe effective vaccine turns COVID common cold. moved 4 years ago. colorado.

It's 10 level Android level. So, let's begin. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair compare Taiwan say US continental Europe. many reasons Yeah I'm Boston, SOON walk bar entertainment venue theater stops. weekly bowling league, hundreds people there, one wearing masks entire evening walked in. everywhere, people functionally stopped pretending follow mandates. science based, rational, logical approach beating virus. never reality nationwide. Indiana back height governor issued executive order mask mandate, day one county police department issued statement refusing enforce mandate. 

controlling virus via government mandates never going work country, Americans value personal freedoms helping neighbor. Taiwan achieved local zero covid experiencing outbreak summer. said outbreak also successful maintaining zero covid well. 

It‚Äôs possible , it‚Äôs doable, it‚Äôs done. western nations simply lack discipline it.  fair never specified Easter. doesn‚Äôt end. stop caring. care lot less,‚Äù Jennifer Nuzzo, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, said asked pandemic would over. ‚ÄúI think people, fades background lives.

This right now. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated booster mental health really starting feel toll pandemic. Cases figure good it‚Äôs going get it‚Äôs time start living. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll 100% ready dive back everything I‚Äôm ready forefront mind time. giving shots kids nah? think 100% everyone get vaccinated I'm yet willing accept mandatory masking might permanent, really think be. employer ask sort permission. asked vaccine card (pics front/back) it. entirely new work industry require sort vaccinations never now. kind uncharted territory me.  %  sorry, sounds way much like ""natural immunity"" people recovered COVID make. good reason science rejects concept COVID. solid data efficacy natural immunity, 6-months post vaccination data shows reduced effectiveness preventing COVID. 

The whole point vaccine gives us known baseline immunity, start going back normal. 

If six months since last Vax, ""boost roost it"" everyone's sake.   Alot people deeply denial this, conversation going point. Fair enough.

I live Canadian province people get three weeks year one, four year eleven. (And more, course, employer offers it. get five.) That's good question. depends overtime rates. assume person unpaid leave pay group people OT cover shifts OT pay 1.5x hourly it'd 50% more, 2x hourly it'll 100% more. know going OT rate services NYC though. becomes cheaper replace though, doubt get away replacing ~20% shifts fire stations.  think OSHA say whether employee eat restaurant time. know coworkers resumed social lives, particularly high risk age/health, work enclosed environment next long hours, might make different decision precautions even employment someone less risk. yes, societal level yes, care. individual level, go get shot already Yes lot bad mediocre doctors. hospitals across country still ridiculous hydroxychloroquine azithromycin treatment long dismissed used NYC. Yea definitely agree you. I've working 6 times week long time eat healthy take care body. also taken vaccine I'm scared all, I'm scared division government creating. people hold hostage saying get vaccine risking others peoples lives dumb/shit person.

Ha. something divisive think America going stop making issue? best thing many decades really tear nation apart allow leaders please busy fighting amongst ourselves. pandemic likely issue decade more. That's flu pre-covid. given day fewer 1,000 department member would sick, said.

I'm OP, OP's point correct. **numbers** July *almost* target level reach open up. See posts thread Fauci Formula advocated since March 2020 -- 10k cases daily US (30 per 1M residents). current all-pandemic CFR would 160 deaths daily (about 0.5 deaths per 1M residents), bad bad year seasonal influenza (60k deaths annually). 

You'll read said *almost* reached target July 2021. Since actually reach target, unrestricted yet -- people impatient wait actually reached target decided stop caring. saw result.

Since CFR trending down, Fauci's initial case number may able bit higher, high depends well control spread, apply treatments, agree acceptable level COVID deaths. March 2020 10k cases closer 200 deaths 160 August 2021 (the last time saw interview used number). So, 200 deaths target, 12,500 cases daily low enough.

Sadly, we're still seeing almost 75,000 cases daily (225 per 1M residents) 1,300 deaths (3.9 per 1M residents). COVID care feel it. stop spreading tired complying. reaches target levels either put work get wait years burn world population. company's name Merck. experimental drug referring molnupiravir, works causing excessive mutations mRNA virus. mutagenic drug. would far cautious giving drug children giving appropriate dose mRNA vaccines. fact, vaccines, general, undergo significantly rigorous testing safety efficacy drugs. take long term vaccination risk children short term treatment almost available?

Either way sound selfish that's sad.  4 death rate 0-1/million/week, order magnitude less UK even Denmark's death rate third UK's. terms cases per capita, think UK least 3 times high.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* executive director two multi-sport games used TSA-style screening procedures. failure rate significantly higher found tested staff, failure rate type pedestrian screening almost always going higher layman would expect. 

The problems twofold. Firstly, removing aspects screening program currently place fix known vulnerabilities (for example, bans liquids) problematic, leaves road map future attackers successful operation. Item bans (pressure cookers, etc) actually highly effective, unlike X-Ray screening, prone user error. 

Secondly, X-Ray screening process flawed process preventing weapons getting onto aircraft, still centerpiece effort keep air transportation safe, better methods exist.

Eliminating effective methods (item bans) keeping least effective (X-Ray screening) recipe disaster. Failures RvB simulations result 9-11. Failures run RvB simulations result 9-11. I'm sure TSA made reforms disastrous report, newsworthy, represents low end modern pedestrian screening accomplish. Anyone know follow today's cdc meeting? Waiting pins needles 415 ET.  prevailing thought everyone eventually infected covid, adverse outcomes mitigated vaccines? Oh god poor girl. absolutely foul!! 

But yes agree, there's reason get rid it. nothing else sneeze guard hey, customers becoming crazy hostile have, also slight obstacle someone trying get physical.  though, UK (like US) much higher ICU capacity, UK weather bigger storm.

Did mean say Germany? UK pretty low list, well Norway Iceland terms ICU beds per capita Denmark little ahead. Finland Sweden little below, near enough beds make much lower vaccination rate much higher number cases. Germany provides interesting comparisons. They're barely behind UK vaccination, better terms deaths (but good 5 countries mentioned), that's probably less spread. Germany US similar case numbers similar hospital capacity, US 4 times death, probably far behind US vaccinations. US still death even UK despite much lower case numbers. mix match however want. J&amp;J, mRNA booster probably best. say Moderna best, either one fine.

Workers fighting against/telling workers plays right corporations‚Äô hands. appointment Monday sounds like approval gets completed today may chance moving faster. Either way, kid I'd look local places already scheduling appointments. Hospitals scheduling Friday afternoon earliest slots think lacks needed context. 

For pro vaccinated, context many believed people would get vaccinated mass. moved hoping campaign could convince people choose vaccination. simply waiting vaccine mandates move needle. 

I'm sure boosters available, people would willing move on. 

Lastly, last year, things equal I'd love mask culture exist flu season. would work people chose mask felt ill living people ill. think masks really limit freedom much all. Obviously works people willingly feel infectious. we'll likely never it. me, cold flu last year great, I'd willing live masks trade off.

I‚Äôm sure academy‚Äôs list looks like NYPD, know typically couple thousand people would like firefighters NY. 

These anti-vaxx firefighters always move rural podunk volunteer firefighter. thought referring city general wanted zero cops specifically know works union specifically, work unions unlimited sick days. Calling ""sick"" common union practice. basically unofficial strike. So, data completely useless now? last heard 7 days negative test, 10 days without test. country lost collective mind sucks. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated started experiencing symptoms. Felt like mild cold. tested positive today, keep eye things. see putting mask putting life hold way. Get rapid test.

But yeah, first dose keep somewhat protected. respiratory disease. Try pass anyone else. Yeah, discussion recently.

They're still working records try consolidate first second doses. second doses counted first doses, knows counted boosters, I'm sure counted first doses computer systems updated appropriately.

This still pretty new fast moving government workers. also avoid becoming pregnant taking pregnancy test. UK definitely outlier terms strong wave. Denmark, example, 29 cases per 100k. UK 61. reference, United States 22 cases per 100k.

Importantly though, UK (like US) [much higher ICU UK weather bigger storm. Well I‚Äôm Canada. province 750k population 90% shot. summer finally opened course started getting cases.

I'm boosted ready enjoy holidays little worry. mean say access clean water actually helps people stay clean sanitary? knew? I'm fond employer calling doctor getting medical information me

Why would happen? work, uploaded vaccine card image third party (CLEAR), gave permission verify COVID-19 vaccination records state database, that's it. employer strictly got yes answer access info time. Heck, PCP even one gave vaccine even know. show vax card. rocket science. According CDC, **101% people age 65-75** received least one shot 


Wait?  right thing right thing, want attention. got first dose Pfizer 3 weeks ago second dose scheduled 2 days, today feel runny nose, bit sore throat mild chills (no fever tho). worried? one dose Pfizer keep safe?

Sounds like judge know little risk associated vaccination, much risk associated remaining unvaccinated. Also, wish they'd apply logic force general lives actually lost continually. UK, Europe basically. 

Restrictions got eased they're heading winter. 

Hospitalizations rising course, places like UK, COVID remains one 3 main causes death. else going figure I'm vaccinated not? 3rd parties access databases without consent person vaccinated? somehow consent got vaccinated?  Vaccinated, still got covid supposedly responsible concert venue checking vaccine status door. guess staff attendees checked, someone forgot roadies band members. Sigh. shit sucks hope none vaccinated folks deal it. Also, get moderna can, stronger longer. Cultural difference. Americans value individuality. Eastern nations value collectivism. Got booster shot last night 7pm really bad nights sleep feel like utter poop today. 3 Moderna. Got flu shot week ago also felt bit shitty day so.

Nothing perfect life whatever % increase protecting translates protection I‚Äôm willing do.

Of course not, outsourcing verification parties automated process much possible. example, majority Microsoft's US employees Washington State California. states state run vaccine databases allow easy verification third parties. examples third parties CLEAR, Qualtrics, OneMedical, etc. state, Oklahoma, immediately shifted $154mil covid funds massive dumpster fire county jail Okc, pushing use build new jail.

I've got going me, nice. unclear moment whether US got Delta whether similar UK peaks troughs. UK Delta journey US. fact UK got vulnerable vaccinated whole meant able cope far. Hopefully boosters also help current situation. find hard believe authoritarian state control public health measures? Really? So...what's point? risk going away, vaccines make really non issue vast majority people. KNOW likely serious side effects, take precautions. want breakthrough infection even though mild, take personal precautions, majority people care get sniffles days, basically go back normal. damn near impossible prove short term stay home. situation UK shit? Well yes could shit. quite yet. understand opened way did, realise situation exactly planned. High case numbers summer hopefully ease pressure winter. That's going say going incredibly hard winter NHS - will. every year anyway year worse most. hopefully pressure eased due high number infections summer. course may completely backfire - know yet - case letting rip UK. Keep mind lot 42% people also children 12. Eh, vaxxed American one vaxxed states nation I‚Äôd much rather there. much would like unvaccinated pay treatment point big issue. real problem, though: creating perception safety encourages unsafe behavior. net win safety measures significant effect (like masks), they're ineffective marginally effective (like sanitizing everything), false sense security create easily outweigh safety benefits. half moderna still 50 mcg, greater 30 Pfizer. Protection seems function antibody levels, seem proportional mRNA dose. 

One possibility get ""first shot"", possibly different state. Full Moderna without hassle asserting bogus health conditions. decided misunderstand purpose then? [Taiwan's Vice President start pandemic real, Johns Hopkins-trained epidemiologist, guy Hollywood Upstairs Medical School. That's sort like loading pick-up basketball team NBA player. They‚Äôve done now. intend forever? Even robust vaccine program, return old life Covid *will* enter country.  get that? public school education required foreign language courses, every 5th grader taught world geography.

That said, I'm starting wonder true though. honestly think anything change till see in-person protests US cities still imposing mask mandates vaccinated people. ""pro science, enough masking enough"" protests happened meaningful scale big US cities yet. Maybe kids get vaccinated month? Idk. funny, heard (on Reddit, probably) head tilt ""sup, dude?"" know somebody tilt acknowledgement nod.

COVAX may one worst examples since AIDs crisis. organization lofty goals, they'll never come close vaccinating world. way ever happen intellectual property waiver allow enough manufacturing vaccinate world. Many products wealthy nations rely develop produce vaccine, well rest healthcare response, comes poor countries. Unfortunately, IP laws many rich people obtained increase fortunes. Specifically, Bill Gates, major funder COVAX. dunno. I‚Äòm doctor. can‚Äôt say makes much difference. know I‚Äôve told.

For example disease proof natural immunity *is* commonly accepted substitute proof vaccination, check measles. UC Berkeley (to pick random organization) requires proof immunity lieu MMR (if actually measles, mumps and/or rubella, cannot find records past doses One blood titer measles, mumps, rubella showing evidence immunity titer results show evidence immunity, still required get outstanding doses vaccine(s) indicated above.

We can't yet use antibody titers COVID purpose correlates immunity known disease.

3. Root phone install Adaway goodies. even know works anymore since rooted phone 5 years. recommend honestly.

I recommend Option #1 that's use. Yeah, geez. takes 1 sick day every 2 weeks? 

Or put another way, taking 23 sick days per year average (based 261 working days per year). That's insanity!! issue mask mandates feels like we're punishing people everything right protect people done single thing protect others since pandemic started. make wear mask bunch anti-vaxxers believe bullshit read Facebook vaccine choose get it. That's choice, they're going learn live (or live) it. make wear mask protect them.

made mad....but continued tons people died  Hope they've got good bank accounts. Afroeurasia even. What's weird they're still 70% adults. mean sure that's far better countries reason higher China holdouts well. how? figured strict lockdowns they'd done vaccines, apparently not. figured would mandate go door door. Exactly. Instead stepping making room next guy, would rather people die. know exactly type talking exactly right. think heroes despite fact refuse take life saving vaccine protection themselves, comrades people help. Foolish stubborn idiots!   get there? Well get way go measles Spanish flu plagues. Get vaccinated. sooner get vaccine babies toddlers, that‚Äôs real laws take place. Like always ‚Äúmust get certain vaccines even go school‚Äù 
HISTORY EXACT ANSWER ASK. read history book. Educate yourself. Yeah, event offered help Halloween event it...didn't go well. spent effort covid precautions let everything else slide. hot mess never dealing again. benchmark change (from 400 cases 200) without real acknowledgement transparency solidified touch DPH Lightfoot front. That, plus justification cases rising parts surrounding states. 

I'll really surprised mandate lifted anytime March 2022.  Good you, lot people uncomfortable, obtrusive, hot, makes work and/or activity difficult. 

The point whether difficult (because people is, others isn't), whether *necessary*. would forced something least mild inconvenience, regional situation indicate necessary? lot people highly vaccinated areas wore pre-vaccine complaint, important question needs addressed. thousands lined take thier jobs. grateful jobs have. They‚Äôre ridiculous. say that, China looked data coming countries concluded otherwise. Taiwanese used wearing mask covid even word, many would continue wear it‚Äôs good hygiene long after. many place already don‚Äôt mask mandate except large indoor space. 

That USA politicized wearing simple mask biggest farce whole covid pandemic.  given day 1 11 firefighters calls sick? seem high anyone else? Yeah, even bother going event required mask social distance even vaccine, especially outdoors. sounds striaght 1984. would rather take trivial risk live like that. Occasionally go things like work, pay me. event paying making go, ain't going. horrible way spend Labor Day.  many people forget actually living requires risk. die day anyways, remove risk life, remove reason live period. hope goes away like flu.

The flu never went away. That's flu shots every year. endemic. Dating harder, socializing harder, communicating work harder, working harder. Almost everything enjoy harder. I‚Äôd argue fussed masks aren‚Äôt fun people. reckless attitude contagion spread US too. Consensus covid control lot harder get torrent misinformation internet  Same. Rural too. county moderna. Nearest Pfizer hour away pharmacy. close children‚Äôs hospital unfortunately side river state vaccinate state. we‚Äôre hoping pharmacy allow appointments ASAP. One mine high risk, still virtual schooling. doc gave us clear school she‚Äôs vaccinated, crossing fingers find something sooner rather later. would never force policies others.

Edit: choose associate keep distance choose to, though. ok. risk assessments, always have. Major pharmacies already announced they're receiving them. lot places give flu shots young kids usually like 0-3 crowd something like serve. able book appointment morning 6 year old Saturday morning, excited finally able get another family member protected.  explanation interdimensional boomers.  leopards went hungry day. that's ok you, force policies others. extraverted person described absolutely worse virus.   Trustworthiness come whether message makes feel warm fuzzy inside today. infer several things him, too. First off, probably Republican. likely supported insurrection January 6, subversion democracy general. probably thinks women [should arrested (by private citizens) probably think immigrants deported, it‚Äôs totally okay Russia owns America.

On hand, may less costly China pursue strategy, feasible countries :/ think pretty accurate. entire group friends humble, kind, happy apologize, always want learn grow humans. course kink news people get people see it. Kids get vaccinated. 

Everyone get vaccinated eligible get one time want to. 

We‚Äôre gaining natural immunity choose get vaccinated whatever reason. Cases don‚Äôt matter anymore, it‚Äôs hospitalizations 

I think getting rid mask mandates soon new year hits, getting rid everywhere. point, we‚Äôre 6 week mark kids get vaccinated, even 7-8 weeks then. time reintroduce start seeing fully vaccinated end hospital bad rates 

At point, mask mandates protect children try keep transmission keep hospitals non overwhelming level 

Now step one going completed coming weeks getting vaccinated, step two doesn‚Äôt matter. Because: natural immunity they‚Äôre gaining helping us. Less people end hospital later. 

The anti vaxxers won‚Äôt get vaccinated time soon, maybe even years. There‚Äôs god damn way I‚Äôm wearing mask years it‚Äôs protecting people don‚Äôt care. Also spent week Paris managed catch Covid. Outdoor dining people watching street wonderful preferable eating indoors. literally exposed toxic shit around daily basis vaccine bridge far... That‚Äôs semantics. mandate vaccine. Insecurity Friday earliest vaccine clinics allowing appointments pre-scheduled kids CO. ""Laps around house""

He beatin off. Yes mean Taiwan wearing masks every day next ten years means ‚Äú0 covid‚Äù

That real question. point stop wearing masks become ok covid flu. live fairly big city far place I've found appointments open children's hospital. main vaccination site appointments starting 8th, regional sites start 15th tell. I've said months ago got downvoted hell reddit counselor police called me, really plan indoor dining ever again. miss it, bother much 5 months feasible eat outdoors takeout. also plan masking indoor public places forever. lucky enough work home day, go shop, inconvenience wear kn95. I'm excited get booster month (and every time tell necessary), ex smoker puts higher risk (apparently even active smokers wtf), choosing careful. Covid changed way interact w world permanently, me, ok. wind getting second dose? find interesting referring someone vaccinated wearing mask (which kind line CDC guidance) anti-vaxxer. It‚Äôs criminal want government say medical decisions pandemic that‚Äôs largely control city. people clapping last year hypocrites it‚Äôs disgusting. already got vaccinated, protects far mask does. accept 100%, I'm going use every NPI book diminishing returns chance maybe stops mild breakthrough.

The point like keeping requirements indefinitely. want officials transparent reasonable thresholds removal. think going group people keep maximum precautions rest lives. example group person event Labor Day weekend required proof vaccination, social distancing, masking 100% time almost exclusively outdoors.

They single covid case kind miserable event. left blinker lol. kidding grandparents snowbirds. Welcome home. safe! understanding, I‚Äôm scientist, no. read virus mutations happening vaccinated, chances vaccine-resistant strain coming rare. I‚Äôm sure someone answer succinctly. 

What know covid stay never going away. Vaccines work phenomenally well. vaccinated people little risk covid. Life going start resuming fully vast majority people. variable asking someone experienced mostly useless. got 3 shots, 1st two absolutely fine. 3rd knocked ass day (combined flu though). wife opposite, first two knocked ass days, 3rd, nothing.

I would hold test, can't know. it! thing covet weather. UK still much better US terms vaccination metric. Portugal done phenomenally. bit disingenuous use comparison, UK sits closer US Portugal. still somewhere middle.

But exactly article author think we‚Äôll freeing so? Easter 2025 visited LA Seattle SF?  Getting downvoted coronavirus saying we‚Äôre gonna permanently masked perplexing many people advocate permanent masking.

Also underwear bomber 2009.  got current security theater. New detection methods result include milli wave scanners, pat downs.  employers backwards. really don‚Äôt like binary discussion masks is. One big area that‚Äôs forgotten requiring masks highly fully vaccinated settings, many municipalities still mandate. disconnect public health officials‚Äô desire prevent much transmission possible conflicts higher levels risk tolerance general fatigue broader population, questionable diminishing returns policies.

The area concern health authorities largely aren‚Äôt setting transparent roadmaps strategies removing mask requirements shift constantly, cases creating thresholds aren‚Äôt possible achieve effectively leading indefinite masking policies. lead worse compliance lower trust. me, driving 10 minutes north gets city, going 10 minutes opposite way gets deep south. *KNOCK WOOD* need care ‚Äúmaximum efficiency‚Äù they‚Äôre letting vaccines expire? get 4th another time. definitely don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs studies saying doesn‚Äôt much 6 months, maybe maximum efficiency tho.

Tuesday, similar committee advising Centers Disease Control Prevention meeting say. (The meeting streaming expected, advisers recommend vaccine agency‚Äôs director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, signs off, decision would likely ease worries millions parents buttress United States‚Äô defenses virus winter Walensky made brief appearance meeting began, noting day ‚Äúone many us eager see.‚Äù Germany's good too, look actual ICU capacity, Scandinavia trouble also generally high list. That's point; countries ICU capacity liberal.

In terms US's higher death rate, yes, lower vaccine acceptance western Europe. That's probably biggest factor. Another could also Americans well, uhm, healthy.

EDIT: Also, there's distinct possibility lot cases going undiagnosed US. variety reasons, Americans may less likely seek testing care develop symptoms. think happens, headline read, ""Firefighters swore oath protect public killed instead"" earth about? going play 'what ifs' day reason discussion. job call get information health without OK. database vax records US. record people card. Agree. 

And J&amp;J recipient received Pfizer today feels really good both! Well never flown two year old.

But yes, big change people, especially people working day them. Ask surgeon -- 12 hours surgery, first thing they'll walking take surgical mask.

That's why, instance, Scandinavia get rid -- [even (let sink in).

It's easy dismiss people causing scenes Walmart flight childish *they childish.* cannot reasonably said Finland Denmark's governments. hold two thoughts time: masks suck wear reduce transmission, true. even require doctor's note unions always guy (usually jokingly referred as, ""Dr. Summeroff"") write notes them.  misleading?? pro vaccinated, context many believed people would get vaccinated mass.

Polls clearly showed massive anti vax movement. dont know people shocked this. anything, far people got vaccinated expected. I'm ok want keep wearing mask, would even support permanent legislation making illegal public places ban masks. completely hate mask, someone autism spectrum causes massive sensory claustaphobia issues. think trade slighlty increased risk covid, flu, colds etc vaccination even booster shot worth wearing it.  time quit forced us, death risk vaccinated people less typical flu season, especially booster shot. risk death hospitalization unvaccinated child even less vaccinated adult. Therefore, logic mandate masks now, always mandate them. risk unvaccinated adults much higher higher that, made dumb choice responsible consequences choice, us. rest us permanently negatively alter rest lives protect wont even protect themselves.  Exactly. 

Which think (also?) focus educating people. 

I idea time one greatest contributions life propaganda module GCSE History took 15. Thank this! Man many times going discussed. Like enough enough. Zero covid already question world march 2020, didn‚Äôt want admit it. countries don‚Äôt completely impermeable borders takes send country lockdown one single case, we‚Äôd locking permanently. would completely unsustainable. basically fact, there‚Äôs amount discussing change that. UK lifted restrictions July. see uptick hospitalisations graph since point, fortunately anyway like peaks prior vaccines. helps puts things graph shows case Playing corporation's hands generally good thing, successful employer makes happy employees; unsuccessful employer makes unemployed people.

In case, thread firefighters. municipal employees, corporate employees. 
Building prisons good way pay back prison corporations bought seats first place. 36% unvaccinated 330 million people (if you‚Äôre talking US) still lot people. Nah. simple really... Intelligent people opt vaccine / boosters. others, aside immunocompromised people, they'll left enjoy liquid lungs. rest world, vaccination rates still 30%... that's need help. virus continue mutate. follow similar viral pathology become less lethal. 

The bigger question world handle another covid - SARS viruses watch decades. Changing climates massive migrations cause disease without doubt large pandemics. Sure, maintaining zero COVID rest world completely infested hard. However countries acted proactively would far easier nearly many imported cases. Got it! Thanks! That‚Äôs completely true. Vaccinated people become ill enough hospitalized rare number even die. 

Wearing mask isn‚Äôt much ask protect members parliament staff. shmucks assume update would check state sites, too. That's found one kid second dose completely protect elderly. worries. It‚Äôs big story city workers fighting mandates protect public. Yeah would imagine FireFighter kind job leave, got bunch applicants right door.

Its job looks easy enough, tie years school it, known great pay/benefits amount school required get it. reason believe miscounted worse cases there's lot evidence suggesting proactive combating COVID. 

Let's clear; people posting China overrun COVID xenophobic conspiracy theorists. 

PS: Admitting China handled COVID well mean support anything else China does. know, citizens actually listen science care general well-being rest society. No. great jobs. Awesome benefits. plenty sane people would love jobs FUCK dumb trumpy anti vaxxers. Let lose jobs stubborn dumb dangerous stupidity.  It‚Äôs absolutely true vaccine protects everyone hospitalization. idea think elderly people poor immune function would completely protected vaccination. society vaccination rate, looking death rate covid, Covid. Vaccinated people mild symptoms catch Covid. literally easy put one on, burden nonetheless.

It's hot, makes face break out, hurts ears (loop tension), makes singing, extended speaking, aerobic exertion taxing. also nightmare eyeglass wearers; constant fogging infuriating.

It impairs human social interaction draws cues facial expressions. perpetuates sense wartime footing: Things OK may never OK, bright-line goal like vaccines sight. Whether that's true not, oppressive psychological weight carry around reminded of.

There also sense deep fatigue unfairness--that people sold masking vaccines arrived, dutifully right things, goalposts moved, they're asked sacrifice promised return normalcy holdouts give fuck anyone else.

The untimely advent Delta enhanced transmissibility drove much goalpost-shifting, course, human nature personify blame seek human scapegoats possible. That's meant. loads liberal Americans seem lack understanding situation making children vaccinated, everything fine there'll nothing worry about. also see everyone talking protecting family care people get it, really make sense since Covid particularly dangerous individual level. effect health system always about. Karma thing. something want reprimanded. strong immunity! Stay well.  Great news! sweet union jobs up! Nobody, that's averages work. sick 2 weeks sprained ankle fire, average looks exactly 1 day week, every week. Humility rare culture emphasizes hyper-individualism, petty egos, always right.  based couple firefighters I've known life - 23 sicks days (working average) taken several chunks due injury. 5 6 injuries year necessitate roughly week recuperation. couple injuries need couple weeks off. 

Its important remember they're far higher risk injured job people are. also can't job they're nursing certain types injury, could inhibit physical performance sufficiently put lives (or firefighters civilians) risk. Sweet, thank really appreciate this. strategy generally ‚Äúoh cold‚Äù approach figured would also appropriate here. Looking forward bouncing back behind me. Source ones calling vaccinated already? OK. DOCTOR, preliminary reports said 1 Pfizer better 1 J&amp;J, put ease. COVID would act booster (super booster ways). Stay well! understand it, 35 put leave thousands still active exemption appeals waiting decision. 35 number representative situation, passed around makes good headline. vaccine supposed completely protect hospitalization, third booster shot introduced. vaccine protects virus, danger point. you‚Äôre going mention minuscule chance get hospitalized, it‚Äôs even less chance die. going let decimal percentiles take away peoples bread families table? That‚Äôs horrific. There's like 8000 NYPD, think, requested vaccinated, they've done paperwork clear point happen if/when requests rejected  doubt Union would allow things. vaccine supposed completely protect hospitalization, third booster shot introduced. vaccine protects virus, danger point. you‚Äôre going mention minuscule chance get hospitalized, it‚Äôs even less chance die. going let decimal percentiles take away peoples bread families table?

Barring unexpected vote, mostly likely outcome like boosters, Wallensky sign tonight shots begin tomorrow morning, places possibly taking afternoon update internal policies systems.  also possible running burning buildings living results higher normal rate injury requiring sick days. like boosters, websites probably working bring live shortly approval. I'm going keep eye normal ones later afternoon. article read earlier I'm lazy find said meeting 4:15-5pm (EDT presume) guess point. you‚Äôre already hostile without discussion

Fuck ""DiScUsSiOn"" bullshit. nothing change minds point. dont want discussion learn real facts. want delay, cry whine, get several steps could‚Äôve taken prior this...

Yeah, geez. takes 1 sick day every 2 weeks? 

They probably take month every couple years breake bone, inhale much smoke get burn injury. LOL you‚Äôre making claim literally evidence all. Show study demonstrates vaccination effective preventing onward transmission universal masking Admitting wrong anything unacceptable. They‚Äôll literally lose job it. almost recommendations whether get booster? I‚Äôm 23, got 2 doses Pfizer March, immunocompromised. Every time look up, see ‚Äúyou may eligible booster blah blah blah‚Äù

I don‚Äôt care eligible, already know am. Boosters available area anyone vaccinated 6 months ago. want know YES, get booster, NO, not. benefits? improved immune response compared didn‚Äôt get it?

It seems like consensus boosters aren‚Äôt immunocompromised ‚Äúlol idk, maybe get it, maybe shouldn‚Äôt‚Äù true. endangering vulnerable person may rescue otherwise encounter job. elderly person poor immune response due age; immunocompromised person; child.

The number vulnerable people NYC likely high. Hi, J&amp;J March 2021. horrendous reaction (had COVID March 2020). got Pfizer yesterday AM. allergic reaction 20 min in‚Äîjust neck rashing hives little. doctor gave Benadryl. Cleared quickly sent home. I'm 31 hours shot. trying jinx it, fever, etc. yet. Went lunch cold feel little bit chills (so odd). Hoping best! WAY better J&amp;J far....

Guessing foregone conclusion. kid's school district already scheduled vaccine clinics. Holy shit, I'm sorry hear this. really heartbreaking people turning backs relatives friend able comprehend voice reason. hope lose anyone else, talking eventually come senses. Words cannot describe I'm hurting many people situations. ""it's criminal want government say medical decisions""

I'm guessing woman....

‚ÄòFuck people‚Äô doesn‚Äôt solve problem. Personally, I‚Äôm pro-vax, maybe discussion heard.

They're public servants claim comfortable rushing burning building save people, yet they're unwilling get perfectly safe vaccine protect people.

This 100% political. nothing lofty ideals claim upholding. Capitulating entirely unwarranted, politically-driven bullshit right path take caving essentially antivax stance could cause big problems something dangerous COVID-19 inevitably rears ugly head.  sociopaths country previously thought cases dropping good indeed, wondering tests still finding infection? 

Not paranoid, mutations, covid become ""invisible"" current method(s)? They‚Äôre endangering one that‚Äôs vaccinated. Saying ‚Äúfuck people‚Äù what‚Äôs making two thousand public service workers go strike, you‚Äôre already hostile without discussion. 

There several steps could‚Äôve taken prior this, raising insurance rates, making wear mask times test least twice week, sit meetings higher ups present would explain week aren‚Äôt getting it, give logical reason, debate made healthier fashion. steps could‚Äôve taken, instead went 0-100. That‚Äôs heavily disagree with.  There's also kind ethical question much effort vaccinated people put protecting people simply refuse get inoculated.

[Zero point online vaccine finders kids? local pediatrician doesnt know getting can‚Äôt speak accuracy number, keep mind day day firefighters pretty physically taxing-extremely long shifts call punctuated sudden racing door deal emergency situations, dangerous remember party relentlessly criticized Obama like 3 people died Ebola. Interesting see US liberal politics shift relatively anti-mask default (obviously quite different reasons). eventually move past hot button, I'd curious see academic chronology stances taken shifted throughout COVID, relatively limited view seems like quite rollercoaster.  thought obvious, headline make sound like firefighters actually sick, skipping work. really asking? can't tell.  know online vaccine finders pediatric distribution? got back Halloween party. 12 us, vaccinated, unmasked social distancing playing dungeons dragons. good time. go again...  Personally, I‚Äôm pro-vax, maybe discussion heard.


No, fuck people. endangering public getting vaccinated. discussion had, want keep jobs sweet pensions, need get vaccinated protect everyone around them. true zero symptoms Pfizer booster. even sore arm (which first two doses). everyone's different. Oh, that's surprise. knew 2 day conference, thought vote would tomorrow. I've recently start wearing glasses cause getting old sucks, I'm hating masks more. annoyance wear glasses. they're fogging glasses making harder see. I'm sure glasses-wearers done 2 years. disagree. shot. Going harder reality airborne transmission would mean acknowledging incessant reminders around handwashing face-touching ‚Äî relatively good advice normal flu season ‚Äî ineffective fighting pandemic. People feel lied to. Trust plummet.

They basically saying ""trust plummet keep saying something that's obviously true"". Public health officials seem terrible pop psychologists. need stick communicating best scientific understanding (and ideally confidence level knowledge held).  Masks restaurants security theater. Wearing mask 30 second walk door table taking second sit protecting anybody. must live somewhere that's crowded. Either city somewhere quite city still crowded like San Jose, CA. Unfortunately they‚Äôre still clogging hospitals, contributing healthcare worker burnout making difficult others get care. Interesting. implied consent guess. Definitely nothing explicit. vaccinated sizable chunk population. happen.

We're 1.6 million now. G20 declare also help vaccine manufacturers poorer countries. unfortunate side effect scientifically based discussions tend hostile willfully ignorant. 

By means, alternative preventative treatment coronavirus par currently available vaccines - please share peer-reviewed papers discussing it.  know two mutually exclusive.

I'm outdoors I'm wearing mask unless situation I'm close quarters someone prolonged period time. arizonans ""Hey 49th 57 ain't bad!"" /s

Fingers crossed! one said anything virus becoming weaker. immune response become stronger.

Covid ""strong"" infecting adults never exposed (or vaccine) before. Within years, anyone like Earth (with possible exception remote tribes).  think right. protect *you*. wear seat belts drive speed limit noncompliance means get fined? real horse shit 2000 many likely vaccinated pretending fit dumbass friends. I'm sure many claim kind hardier constitution something well knowing likely catch lessoned symptoms. stupid hill die on. N95 mask equivalent, cloth cheap surgical mask mask unknown origin dubious protection? masks same. didn‚Äôt die covid, statistically he‚Äòs group anti-vaxers want belong to‚Ä¶  understand unions fight garbage like this. say mandatory please give us pay. Sucks pay people get it, worth fighting for. know excess deaths covid? think makes little start making numbers think different official counts. 

Either way, would do? Following approval, able search appointments vaccines.gov filter age 5-11. flip side black people safer ever since bunch cops working. think give consent register card tools.  Confirmed deaths actual deaths number.

Even based excess death numbers (which still undercount total), we're far 700k now. That's job Facebook never be. 

Frankly think we'd better Facebook never invented ""news feed"" kept friends status posts (no public figures etc) are.  son‚Äôs pediatrician won‚Äôt getting vaccine all. said try pharmacies health department. I‚Äôm start checking health department websites appointments. live super rural town I‚Äôm surprised won‚Äôt able get easily. require people wash hands? proven reduce spread illness. one's crying restriction personal freedoms run around dirty hands, it.

Given way people talking handwashing start pandemic, clearly lot people *don't* wash hands. :-/ Actually, poor countries would much rather manufacturer vaccines medicines. Broadly speaking, they'd like independent possible. developed world that's preventing would undermine leverage them. I'm happy find sources angle wish look issue from. second Moderna shot April, got booster past Friday. Feeling invincible rn  Exactly, I've certainly tried think ways help. even organized vaccine drive low vaccinated areas. lot effort cost resulted fewer 35 people getting vaccinated.  Yup important point. Well, nitrogen air blue least. easy wear mask. understand anyone anywhere it. I've wearing 18 months still bothering me.  booster, waiting days weeks problem bad idea. 

If first second shot, wait. Noice live California, apparently one stricter states. time mandate deadlines hit group whether police, firefighters, hospital staff airline employees like this. Better 99% vaccination handful people follow left cold. Buh-bye! people understand Constitution well understand Bible swear by. They've usually read bits pieces either, anything. Lol posted yesterday kids' pediatrician associated hospital vaccinations started taking appointments already. would suggest going route starting point none places I've found taking appointments yet. may change next day two though.

**IF** region live [High transmission **THEN** everyone wear mask public indoor settings.

**IF** region **NOT** High transmission, unvaccinated people wear mask public indoor settings.

When ""do nothing"" every location 100% open restrictions anyone? Here's crazy idea, try first step first? I've noted elsewhere thread, every time hard target set clearance states municipalities create methods meet target without actually reducing COVID spread. Less X positive tests per day? Stop testing. Less COVID deaths average? Code everyone ""Natural Causes"" instead. long people like interested actually anything COVID problem long time. go back bridge next thread come ""whatabout?"" endlessly. IMO, there's selfish sentiment America breeds narcissism. Narcissism also louder humility notice much. Question, live two others we're late 20's fully vaxxed. roomie tested positive Sunday night. roommate quarantining getting tested daily via rapid standard tests. long quarantine going still testing negative every day?

No idea unvaccinated people actually either, though. I'm really worried get office without really seeing anyone. Grabbing lunch supplies fridge time ever risk crossing paths someone. problem is...you get breakthrough infection. number Americans dying Covid weekly still dwarfs 9/11.

Downvoting Comment?, Wow! Australia DID. outbreak earlier pandemic, locked down, got zero covid could open again. decided 2nd outbreak since considered vaccination effort sufficient. 

Zero covid always doable, fact vaccine came along probably cost less overall reckless abandon attitude USA has. People choose it. So, bottom line, shots 5-11 start assuming everything goes expected?  Honestly though I'm rural guy heart. really fit big cities country, grew rural area I'm comfortable here. Covid certainly interesting though.

Thanks, really hard get username signed up. Technically CDC formally issue approval likely happen tomorrow next day. states additional state approvals. Plus wait vials physically become available, since reason can't use regular vials vaccine.

It's got small growth advantage Delta.. much step-up Delta Delta Alpha. I'm sure wires got crossed amazing surprise! think pandemic largely control.

Would nice keep way, eh? helps remember vaccine one time thing happens body initial appointment. Administration start whole, systemic story--which part need multiple doses time doses body job. Sleep deprivation, hangover, hayfever day matter much getting shot body start work. Wearing mask preventing someone living life? That's realistic? uncomfortable 8-12 hours day already done right things,

This literally children think, though. people aware pandemic?

In theory suppose state health agencies might also give approval sort expect also formality. That's opinion, one that's outside realms reality. Especially considering wear entire day, industry masks make difficult, like every form education.

To go limb rarely scary so, simply exhilarating fun. possible sick got shot last minute dealing side effects? That's possible. I've found definitions line and, ignore use synonym ""flying"" found several variations ""increasing rapidly usual level"".

""New cases"" chart rate increase. people getting COVID higher rates almost nation planet reasonable adjective ""soaring."" Except people using loophole keep job remain unvaccinated.  people say think masks uncomfortable then, instead saying punishment, preventing living life? Yeah, missing whole point trying make completely unrelated one. 

No one saying masks work prevent spread, vaccines make masks irrelevant VAST majority vaccinated individuals. data breakthrough deaths, death rates highly vaccinated areas shows clearly.

So **yes** masks largely protect unvaccinated people, immunocompromised. That's true statement, efficacy masks *in general* relevant. Tdap, MMR, Polio, Hep B, Varicella, Tetanus.

That's pretty standard every state, one politicized like nothing it. What's weird saying masks punishment preventing people living lives, lol. absolutely true lmao. im dutch, even cdc equivalent doesnt fully acknowledge benefits masks much does. US isnt outlier here.

I think trying make adjacent point choosing die hill subjective therefore think easier make stand on. 

Kinda weird tbh.   Unfortunately, poor children likely parents bought misinformation may keep unprotected. would workman's comp sick day. Finally! thankful 90 years now, Tucker Carlson's great grandson interview anti-vaxxer 2109 pandemic say, ""wHaT 2020s gErMaNy?!?!"" state waiting Monday, know kids go school vs nice weekend... Would interesting study comparing herbal antidepressant St. John's Wort, since known anti-inflammation anti-viral properties.  California list required immunizations: Tdap, MMR, Polio, Hep B, Varicella, Tetanus. like adding one would radical. radical states, also required similar list immunizations nearly century would take steps oppose one more. 

What really surprised, schools require seasonal flu shots. would think would reduce student sick days quite bit. schools loose funding student absent? 12 even option unfortunately, hopefully it'll get updated soon. Someone finding masks uncomfortable inconvenient completely based reality. new shocking information find people wearing masks 8 hours day, they're working out, they're trying teach, perform, million things hindered masks find hinderance annoying inconvenient. 

You're caught nonsense opinion refuse see dozens people thread alone said supported masks necessary, always found onerous. 

...and yes highly vaccinated areas without mask mandates pumping thousands deaths day. statement straight hyperbole. 

It's unfortunate can't see that.  Although vaccinated, don‚Äôt understand someone needs vaccinated pick garbage‚Ä¶ Probably working system get OT pay. Call sick another guy covers shift getting OT pay repay sick call someone else gets OT pay. Save Daniel 6mo-4 year olds. Cringe Lmao that's benefit. Still sucks kids.

I'd gladly wait 2 weeks still live suburb 90% 12 1 shot school district requiring masks weekly covid testing. point, factual data months, fk them. patience idiocy. Let's end shit pandemic. Agree still lot learn. I‚Äôve simplified view antibodies provide quick response vs T-cells taking days ramp up. Delta much contagious original came time antibodies levels dropping. 

But booster uptake low vaccinated people still spread virus, makes herd immunity impossible. I‚Äôm getting booster every six months I‚Äôm told otherwise turn Magneto There's lots folks capable firefighter get denied position every year. accept 100% people pass physical. non-issue. fire department get healthier. may good opportunity others wanting join Department. 

Granted Union needs stay it. Local FD Unions caused us Volunteer Firefighters loads grief, calling us Scabs excluded getting ""dues"".  Ah, right, thrown Moderna Pfizer different wait times jabs.

We also littler kids hope 2 approved soon well! 88% 12-15 age group vaccinated county I'm feeling really optimistic location. Save release vaccine 2-5 year olds. Gee, hope unvaccinated firefighters don‚Äôt regret giving sick days‚Ä¶they might need soon. OP said masks protect unvaccinated. wholly untrue. Please stop spreading misinformation. Masks work, cited source. Saying like wearing mask mean work.  wife fully vaccinated already while. 2 little kids (2yo,7mo). understand correctly, covid unlikely hit hard kids. old vaccinated also unlikely covid hit hard. Then, put vaccine developed speed light little ones? I‚Äôm antivaxer (I actually hate guys), refuse vaccinate kids vulnerable developmental stage something fkn clue causes long term. Please try change mind. Thnx Lol you‚Äôre vaccinated need consider virtual gatherings. Get grip. thought meeting Friday?? pediatrician's office, hospital partner with. harsh lockdowns, contact tracing, quarantine centers necessarily probable still possible.  FDA strangely hesitant recommend third shots. Israel gone recommending everyone data says greatly reduce risk infection, explicitly consideration FDA because, idk, FDA apparently trying prolong pandemic? Welcome reddit, specifically provaccine subs looked closely brigaded antivaxx spam report via reddit cares bot. Nah, know me. know type people complain masks torture can't wear them, though. Shots arms 15 min sooner! please love God nice people administering vaccines

For real. got booster CVS week short-staffed. felt bad, nearly canceled offered reschedule, pharmacist sweet fit (I waited patiently course). one customer picking script kept making comments unfortunate short-staffed. ""I understand one wants work anymore!"" FFS, say employee anywhere. someone worked retail pharmacy, employees likely severely underpaid overworked. could even filling front ring up. imagine poor tech/cashier like ""Yeah, nobody wants work get paid, lady"" head, totally ignored comment. Just... don't. Lol, never nonsense dismiss subjective opinions based reality. That's gaslighting.

I called pediatrician‚Äôs office (useless)
Very large children‚Äôs hospital (we make plan approved‚Ä¶)

Finally got large research hospital, started taking appointments today.

Call around find someone knows plan. What‚Äôre going run sick time? report that, FYI. late dad brothers retired FDNY. 

You test, pass, make cut. many per class. Top class makes it.

Nepotism really apply, far getting job. houses work at? Influence probably helps, there. Pfizer booster shown [95% effective compared two doses Side effects similar second dose. makes absolutely, 100% worth it, question. Thanks! hadn‚Äôt seen hotspot map. That‚Äôs helpful.  OK, fire people  royally fucked mean they're lying dead lol, could even less we'd locked like them, lot infections happened even knew going  TIL kids 5 don‚Äôt tell causes much stress. probably vaccinated. It‚Äôs logical factual fallacy say masks never go away - they‚Äôve already gone away. Bringing back cases ridiculously high smart also measurable longer needed. seen experienced, yes. much harder time getting vaccine first go around. That‚Äôs problem lot people , hear word ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù automatically assume talking boarder restriction, I‚Äôm really talking local , domestic trace-test-quarantine program almost certainly continue even boarder completely open entry limits entry-quarantine. Thanks, that's strategy far. tiring know right thing everyone around makes feel like monster. vaccines protect everyone, that's entire purpose. sure told masks effective even aignificant effect vaccinated population, (and you) incorrect. Yeah, really get either. Deaths much lower either. 

If guess, never saw bad could been. vaccines introduced intense wave possibly could gone much higher Delta. 

Like however bad now, know much worse could been. There‚Äôs like 10 year wait get NYFD. I‚Äôm sure won‚Äôt issues getting new people Sounds like might job openings illegal immigrants coming jobs Americans want do! /s intentionally missing point make unrelated argument. Masks necessary, made discomfort inconvenience (and yes, uncomfortable inconvenient) something overruled necessity. 

In many places high vaccination rates, masks *no longer necessary* thus discomfort inconvenience ***also*** necessary. 

So disingenuous stating *no* downside mask mandates noise, intended dismiss entire argument whether mask mandates necessary enough counterbalance negatives come with. love stance basically ""Not problem people die fires, they're asking us something horrible worth saving guys anymore."" true, coordinated, multi-nation lockdown like proposing would required many previously-unthinkable policies. 

One total military enforcement US-Mexico border, absolutely zero tolerance illegal immigration. practice, would probably ominous sounds. really price would prepared pay?  It‚Äôs easy say ‚Äòfuck people‚Äô.

They given numerous chances, plenty time, tons data. point willfully endangering public. hard dialogue could actually impact perspective.

There dialog had. fractally wrong answer get vaccinated get fired. end. people‚Äô doesn‚Äôt solve problem.

You're right, firing does. tenor comments panel strikingly different FDA panel ‚Ä¶ happy that.  There‚Äôs really nothing do. Vaccinate kids try ignore rest. can't wait new government take effect mandates. also total bull employers unable protect employees. Currently, someone unvaccinated allowed restaurants, clubs, museums, movie theaters, allowed Christmas markets... go right ahead spend nine hours closed office together. makes perfect sense. There's even vaccine mandate doctors nurses.  Nice. Way set good example. Yes US much higher % serious cases, suggesting they're finding mild/ asymptomatic cases like UK is. free, easily accessible testing facilities whereas believe testing availability patchy different US states. Breast milk contains coronavirus antibodies, study  Anyone know easy get booster CO? pretty much available walk-ins? Wearing mask isn‚Äôt much ask protect members parliament staff.

Yeah since it‚Äôs never going away you‚Äôre getting ‚Äúwear mask forever‚Äù territory. go get vaccine instead. You‚Äôre wrong, messaging place. You‚Äôre young healthy, don‚Äôt *need* present.

Yes, *if*. seen evidence of, since specified ""sick"". another popular sub can't mention get automodded ""Purely political posts comments removed,"" highest post 34 police officers vaccine mandate. I'm really confused story getting things right.

Here link article discussed uncle retired police officer US. beyond greatful benefits pension. able retire full benefits pension 50 work part time.


I pharmacist able retire student loans I'm 80 rate. ungrateful idea good it.  makes sense grueling work, firefighters mostly EMTs drive big trucks assist people fall strokes. actually huge issue keep spending loads money highly trained people rarely needed purpose. definitely batch fit people fight actual fires, I'm sure paying pensions 40 years necessary could continue public emergency responders squeeze private companies charging thousands ambulance rides. Good  is.  Yeah.

A friend sis ex working City Montreal. Started city funded summer camps 15, continued city employment. Seems time summer camps counted pension, retired 40 full benefits. Crazy. guess it‚Äôs time get song called fuck fire department?  job wear one day, 8+ hours straight, every day? Yeah, really care. good!   Wearing clothes office even ballpark choices getting new vaccine anything listed. They‚Äôve watched people die virus make rounds houses. got vaccine 2 weeks ago dire need remaining people get shot. Look numbers compared control. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated mandates first step more. I‚Äôm giving 6 year old child shot even though it‚Äôs approved now. study done 1800 children that‚Äôs anywhere near enough. Yeah high school friend dad 50, retired Firefighter.

At time, makes sense. fit 50 20. situations teammates life risk, want someone 100% fit. Self-validating, entitled ignoramuses. generation NYFD don‚Äôt resemble 9-11 heroes much. That‚Äôs sounded like read article. CO never delta surge mask restrictions dropped. Weather beautiful summer people outside/windows stayed open, etc. 

Now weather getting cold quickly people congregating indoors. 

The highest rates rural counties never vaccinated high rates. bunch fucking cry babies. stuff sorries sack, mister!!! bet there's plenty relatives quitting together too. Oh 1000%, meant terms categorizing leave. NY lose job, benefits pension.. give in. Seen pandemic. I'm already seeing headlines like ""Kids dropping like flies getting poked"" stuff like that. there's heart attack medicine it. counteract information? want get kids vaccinated, I'm surrounded people think Satan designed thing...   Hopefully kids reasonable parents too. isn‚Äôt true all, they‚Äôve already shipping out: 

‚ÄúThe White House says millions vials Pfizer's lower-dose vaccine formulated younger children already begun shipping health care providers following Food Drug Administration's authorization last week.‚Äù

There‚Äôs confirmation fact started received providers. Whether specific provider preordered taking appts may vary they‚Äôre ready go.

Source: want man get vaccination like big boys. emergency use authorization could still go work sprained ankle, wouldn‚Äôt fighting fire. like feeding it. fat body. Like kindling. So. you. issues finding moderna booster, helped find appt day city, give shot (no pun intende..well maybe little intended). Keep mind it'll end week shots going arms see danger death time, something simple like take vaxx prevent unnecessary senseless illness deaths. 

Not really getting sympathy. Depends want, believe considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks 2nd jab? would give additional week leeway.

We got almost 2yrold well we're probably staying home christmas either way. think going see sweeping mandates schools across country. know California plans enact one vaccines get fully approved various age groups many states even talking it. fact decent number passed laws explicitly prohibiting schools requiring COVID-19 vaccination. RN, happily dress Daniel Tiger help give out. that's frustrating. Even Dunks. run time 4 seconds. always forget outside Boston...you go indoors without mask.

&amp;#x200B;

Our numbers worked for. around 10+ years rate like flu. Boston always masks? honestly know anymore. still see people bikes walking outside...like huh?

&amp;#x200B;

I think people brainwashed way far left. Ya luck here. Hopefully soon. already get appointment? Well considering many arsonists firefighters with, think it'll long catastrophic event hoping happens. sure check children‚Äôs hospital one. first know open appointments CO Someone reported depressed redditcareresources almost immediately posted this. Thanks caring guess? Report report report. doesn‚Äôt matter whether child smaller larger kids age comes vaccines, experts said.  important factor give young child medication like Tylenol wide variation weight infancy throughout childhood much drug could toxic.  optimal vaccine dose, however, dependent age tailored minimize potential side effects. small 5-year-old large 5-year-old immune systems ‚Äúfunctionally similar,‚Äù said Dr. David J. Rawlings, chief division immunology Seattle Children‚Äôs Hospital director Center Immunity Immunotherapies Seattle Children‚Äôs Research Institute.  children 5 11 age group ‚Äúhave really robust immune system,‚Äù added. means get lower vaccine dose 12 17 age group still produce number men... older female neighbor Eastern Europe, lost 2 relatives due COVID vaccinated still refuses vaccine. I'm curious see uptake ends being.

We know [polling minority parents say plan immediately vaccinate 5-11 year-olds. top that, we're approaching 6 months availability 12-15 year-olds age rage still less 50% fully vaccinated. Denver level 1 trauma hospitals entire Rocky Mountain region. People getting flown Nebraska, Kansas, Wyoming, even Dakotas. regional issue Denver bears brunt of. Thank science scientists! think hard time reading, ok, sometimes difficult see screen blind ideology.

There two points made.

1. Masks effective keeping people safe vaccines. Vaccines orders magnitude better preventing spread serious outcomes.

2. highly vaccinated population, masks negligible mitigation move needle much beyond base vaccination, Especially considering masks without distancing (which one anywhere) sufficient prevent spread. guys think schools add vaccine mandate? I‚Äôm really curious. Pretty sure people thread even believe statement, much less obvious. read based weight immune system's maturity.  fuck wrong you, know goes firefighter? least 3 years school, that's low end. Merkel left yet? Good. NPR article said goal ASAP, realistically, widely available 11/8. keep checking. peds office keeping list interested kids, maybe too. I've refreshing major pharmacy sites luck (though I've heard they're scheduling areas?). think there's least one hoop--the CDC director needs give final approval, definitely going tonight, probably soon. also read needs approved state-level states, unfortunately find one source made claim. close... feels like Christmas Eve. hardly focus work today! Lame. order fully vaccinated Christmas, need get first jab Nov 11th next week. really hope expedite this. seem real hard masks buddy. pretty clear even people embrace find annoying inconvenient. sure trying prove wrong, weird hill die on. local specialty pharmacy. opened appointment slots last week pending approvals. things listed proven track record extremely safe site number studies past decades them. can‚Äôt said this, I'm fully vaccinated support everyone‚Äôs right not.  holdouts, anti-vaxxers kind problem: Lots people bother getting vaccine never experienced horror pandemic way did. 

In general, people simply can't learn experience others... firsthand. Growth cycle leafy greens around 50 days. First harvest post flooding coming soon drive prices back down. essential grains there's national stockpile utilized. going even harder end long COVID still good data vaccinated.

We're capable adapting social methods improve public health. People protested wearing pants, using toilets, wearing seatbelts throughout history. something I'd worry about. help sleep. weight? I‚Äôve got huge 3 year old hope so, would nice see!  true see drop non-Covid deaths things like 'being run car Covid' would count towards Covid death rate. seeing that? ask got appointment? I‚Äôve tried looking, seems nothing popping yet around me. right 58% fully vaccinated.  Hopefully brings us closer 70% including fact currently 66% already partially vaccinated. vaccines already shown less effectiveness delta. Vaccines also wane least antibodies created response vaccines wane immune responses remain.

Vaccines 100% preventing infection, illness, hospitalization death. 

Masking decreases likelihood 
infected know now. It‚Äôs easy addition protection. Mix much want. 

There really good reason think mixing would cause issues. get matching chicken pox flu vaccines, Covid vaccines much different. I'm missing point. People using hyperbole: claiming wearing mask punishment, literally isn't.

Still missing point. missing point. People using hyperbole: claiming wearing mask punishment, literally isn't.

People saying masks inconvenience, difficult, feel like punishment subjective opinion. disagree personal opinion, dismissing completely nonsense. anywhere West, silly argument unless Taiwan.

The entire NE high vaccination rate blunted Delta spread, kept death rate hospitalizations manageable throughout surge. That's entire point. disingenuous saying masks punishment, masks putting life hold, etc. simply say like masks ok thousands deaths day would honest.

Now throwing around hyperbole? highly vaccinated areas thousands people dying day, entire delta surge. Massachusetts 7-day average 10 people, Vermont 2, Maine 7, vaccines kept suppressed supposed to. I‚Äôm also forced get finger prints done, forced get TB test, forced get physical, forced go updated vaccines work education. Sorry lame excuse. It‚Äôs totally safe, mix match formally approved couple weeks ago reservations.  Easy enough? people think firefighter easy job lol? I‚Äôm expert anything don‚Äôt know firefighters personally, job looks hard fuck incredibly stressful times, little know. case? Maybe depends upon Colorado live Denver metro.

I know sure accept walk ins, I'd surprised accept them. might worth giving call first trying next time go grocery shopping something. Fwiw issue yesterday lots podcast addict. I'm thinking unanimous, Walensky issue approval today rather tomorrow. ""concerns"" warranted ""no"" votes, go time.  places started signups early waiting till CDC's signed completely. states may also require governors sign well. I've waiting word Oregon OHA's site seems say state receiving vials get distributed Kate Brown signs off."
