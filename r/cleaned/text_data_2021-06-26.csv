0,2021-06-26," thought common head cold last week, realized Friday (yesterday) head clearing, still couldn’t smell. Went test sure positive. wear mask pretty much every public places even though I’m vaccinated. sure got sure hope taste smell comes back. symptoms ones feared getting COVID. Damnit!  get it. must. since must, might well make it. fully vaccinated person get sick variant original strain. news. people keep masks doctor's appointment, literally one dentist's appointment? even everyone fully vaccinated, wouldn’t virus continue mutate since still infect host vaccine little symptoms? given young compromised people?

I feel like virus can’t go away since still infect vaccinated host ability mutate infect another. always constant vaccines booster find way eradicate it. agree. take says seriously saying bring back masks. Delta Omicron Gamma Epsilon. Yep, smart kids wanna live grow die mommy daddy's mental instability belief fairy tales Fox.  Yup! interesting read. Thank sharing! factual? feel media’s pounding generally traditional cold symptoms (sore throat, runny nose). Regardless, don’t feel bad, didn’t know it. delta variant similar common cold's symptoms. least know, vaccines effective deaths. get sick covid, even full vaccinated. No?

I'm Brazil seems I'm living another planet, I've heard now, get sick also transmit covid, even 2 doses. there's study that? Well...at least Brazil, always information...

I heard people usually less chances getting covid, fully vaccinated...less chances mean chances... one vaccinated countries world going back masks? end day? end literal day kids responsible health, wanna get vaccinated, complicated Children rights civil society. guardianship parents considered, either legally ethically, extend infliction harm either intent omission. 

Refusing vaccinate children abusive. ""responsible"" mean beat kids. mean fail obtain appropriate medical care. provide food. No. imagine good it. still providing service feel like commenting last 18 months? specified recommended based local vaccination rate? vaccines main purpose never prevent infection, decrease severity disease. 

No purpose creating vaccine. There's part conveniently left out: San Francisco city workers required vaccinated coronavirus vaccine receives full federal approval. means full fda approval Emergency use Well every person catches chance create variant. social distancing masks need continue. link currently seem broken cases straining NHS, could say. could say something high level deaths hospitalisations. cannot said certainty, early wave.

However, saying link cases hospitalisations/deaths broken, false. easier term use.

Saying link two less significant correct.

Comparing absolute amounts matters (in comparing definition ""a link""). one trend following another. R 1 means Canada failing contain Delta. ""looking good"", idea. guess aren’t gonna move then. Gee thanks China sure don’t want chance either way.  antivax, ascribe corrupt motives responsible enough want get vaccinated young age. Ultimately, better citizens are. accounts like 99% cases country plus initially GI symptoms appears common delta plain ignorant think that's abnormal behavior. I’m immunosuppressed got Pfizer vax April. contacted doctors get antibody test doctors said cdc doesn’t recommend getting antibody test get negative results despite protection. went Compunet got test anyway came back negative. Doctors tell don’t need third dose I’m taking chances. I’m continuing precautions. really don’t want die immunosuppressant. also uncomfortable teenagers going around parents, even parents wrong allowing teenagers receive vaccine.

Why uncomfortable? exactly legally allowed get vaccinated? year masking going leave everyone susceptible ordinary colds, flus upper respiratory viruses normally float around. I’ve talked fully vaccinated people thought Covid past week turned anything ordinary illnesses seasonal allergies, none tested positive. What’s rush get rid masks? received shots side effects except sore arm (first shot much worse). fiancé bad side effects first shot stocked second like doomsday coming (tylonol, gatorade, pedialyte, mary jane). waited 72+ hours side effects kick never did! Guess makes superior two BSc's (one bio), MSc, progress PhD, work biotech, research antibiotic resistance, involvement clinical trials.

I love people subreddit pull totally irrelevant credentials leg stand on, amusing. Could anyone tell AstraZeneca vaccine still effective 16 17 week interval doses? know 12 week gap showed good immunogenicity, happens interval increased? friend delay second dose concerned whether she'll still develop immunity. Thanks Hospital admissions gone 130 day 180 per day. 

Wave 1 peak 3100 per day, wave 2 peak 4100 per day.


Patients hospital gone 1000 1200.

Wave 1 peak 19,000, wave 2 peak 34,000.


Patients ventilation gone 130 230.

Wave 1 peak 2,900, wave 2 peak 3,700.



Just put perspective onto increases. next shot needs better reception People 16-28 need precautions they're vaccinated. government letting get vaccinated, expect unchecked spread continue. potentially miscalculated? CDC could well recommend masks, again. many would listen… lot students expressed confident parents making informed decisions unwillingness vaccinate children.

On hand students express arguing parents want vaccine. 

Shit unfortunate... Unlikely, symptomatic illness reduced cold like never happen. lot anitvax folks caved vaccine basically mask mandates lifted sort trade off. think they’ll slap mask back dreaming. 

Is wise? knows. say good luck getting compliance. Canada they’re strongly recommending Pfizer Moderna second shot got AstraZeneca first. know got Delta variant? N95s available hardware stores now. wear good mask.  Time retarget mRNA give boosters!   
  
Ha Ha Ha, like happen.  say BS. 50 never heard vinegar chemical. sure enough chemical. Even 50 still learning. Delta wasn’t dominant 3 months ago. sure state keeping accurate numbers? given AZ 12 week gap (reduced 8 Delta) instead Pfizer 4 weeks. read comment point made vaccinated people likely feel, selfish, sorry phrased badly going what's going heads actually half adults infected fully vaccinated, like 25%. 50% unvaccinated children, 25% unvaccinated 


Super good point test picking virus system seeing many asymptomatic. I'm sure curious we're going need rethink automatically using PCR tests people showing symptoms. really news? Haven’t known vaccines aren’t 100% effective? stupid headline saying “somewhere earth, someone get struck lightning morning February 23, 2026” *some fully vaccinated people may still get sick exposed form Covid-19. don't. card Excelsior pass (from New York State). Nasty little prions. Cherry top data looks good vaccines also significantly reduce rates transmission.  sample size one. Great. They're 100% effective, vaccine is. 90%+ people effective definitely good thing. Problem people won’t fully understand little knowledge medicine. sometimes way able fully explain language ordinary people would understand. 19 year old brother mild COVID. it’s mild, recover easily? Neither “fact” perspective “fear porn” perspective match article we’re commenting on. article basically saying vaccines little less effective variants still pretty effective important protective barrier us. mentions death whole article it’s relation people unvaccinated.

I don’t always like CNN article seems pretty reasonable. Far fear porn. ignore dad makes fun wearing mask leave house. I'm fully vaccinated wearing mask minor inconvenience compared increased risk catching covid, matter small. get code Empire Pass New York State stop freeloading backs immunized. Russia do. Electronic, though, printed. Got vaccinated Switzerland received paper certificate QR code could import app (although that's ease use, app offer anything paper doesn't).

The certificate compatible EU DCC system, July it'll recognized EU countries well. get notification aware logged NHS account. think fairly recent thing  BOY hear that. US celibate months. Well it’s flipping bird. I’m going abstain archaic rule written 1983 updated. literally go pharmacy I'm super ill. I'm gay... Thank NyTimes protecting secret..so helpful... ""But secret Elizabeth, 17, rising high-school senior New York City, keeps hers""  rapid test? waiting room..? Yes get code online North Dakota? Yep. card place date injection. uncle virus vaccine vaccine kicked ass too. Seems like damage done first time Previously, raise hospitalisations casualties delayed 10-14 days date infection raise. Next week two tell. won’t allow Men Sex men donate either. Neither Gay bisexual Men.  don't. US, Pfizer. simplistic little card CDC, that's it. I'm guy deleted post, thread changed mind.

If friends family still rationalizing fear, gentle, know there's truth whole 'benefits outweigh risks thing'  


My fiancee really go wal-mart afternoon got first doses moderna vaccine. honest two people replied thread, allowing someone's loss go vain personal reason, Thanks Reddit!  
proof: partner got first moderna shots fine, nothing sore arm bit headache once, able function three days now? Today much better yesterday Everytime got bed nauseous, face felt fire looking tv computer made want throw up. Also super hungry nauseous great. Hoping I'll back normal tomorrow lord looking forward next one... still get mannn I'll anxiety attacks done with. never build proper face mask manufacturer supply whole Australia export anyway.  Benefits still outweigh risks. get infected Delta would suck. benefits vaccination I’m less likely die.   UK do, NHS app Hell cant even donate blood area need weigh least 50kg lmfao. Never even close anemic, thats metric go with. got lung injury made cough blood week lasted year bleach. cleaning shower took three breaths air, decided strong, left. smell bleach. smell it, hurt you. Dang, that’s disappointing. hoped vaccination would stop stuff like smell loss. Anyone else double vaxxed get smell loss, recover quicker usual timeframes?

But knows, maybe would serious case vaccine you’ve got mild case instead 🤷‍♂️ Glad it’s nothing worse mild stuff! true, also true?:  Covid deniers whole level stupid. There's reasoning selfish entitled whiny fucks.  I’m pretty sure saying thing… Oh man sorry cult part. Good getting boy there. say worried, made claim transmission happens equally places, let's see backup that. Question : sick? Yet again... zero evidence. Unless asking take ""investigation"" NBC sort credible source, absolutely insane. realize googling something copy pasta clickbait headlines prove anything, right? one vaccinated Israel sick virus (-immunocompromised people). taking extra precautions. Getting first shot late March required reserve time slot CVS drug store 40 miles home one way. needed twice required return store dose #2 total 160 miles driving this. complaining, explaining getting vaccine easy earlier year. tests usually ordered qualitative quantitative. Qualitative gives yes/no answer, like one got. Quantitative gives numeric value. tests run different ways different costs well different false positive false negative results.    vaccine 95% effective getting covid 100% effective preventing death. second one really important stats. WTF even normal reactive antibodies? 

I got Sinovac, choice Indonesia best jab one arm, 80U/mm, whatever denominator is. 

My docs 140U 240U, say. Pfizer people West 2,500U afaik-but ianad. think 50U minimum, know.

Anyway, hi current terrifying global epicenter COVID pandemic. see evidence this, homie. Mask on. Yup, got fully vaxed April, got positive covid test. Luckily mild, thought allergies, ""super rare chance getting covid vaxed"" seem rare me. still wear masks day. Perhaps weren’t Emperor. is. So, ya know Maybe including single doses, rather fully vaccinated, vaccination goals greatest decision. think people complaining masks upset reminded pandemic they're desperate ignore forget.  Says guy afraid getting vaccine. know know Covid “actually killed” [nearly 4 million people past 18 months. currently 1 tell me, strong immune response be? I'm almost positive nurse give shot second time went. First shot sore hurt next day, second shot feel needle go it, feel vacine go absolutely effects next day. able tell 1 shot? misinformation. ought ashamed yourself. opposite parents says know, every vaccine ever released studies long term effects first TOOK YEARS THAT. Still, humanity living see another day. time many morons expressing faulty opinions digital landscape amidst pandemic. Cheers Vaccine records usually kept state don’t follow state lines. crossed state lines showed walk vaccine, would reason refuse. Give time. People need vaccinations go school join military. vaccine eventually join ranks measles, mumps, rubella. FYI Ab tests screen Ab nucleocapsid protein virus, vaccine us making Ab spike protein. words, could negative result covid Ab fully vaccinated never covid. Make sure check run test specific spike protein. Nah he’s real deal zero side effects either dose. reason, worries even lol Right. vaccinated March / April, caught covid June. that’s totally unexpected. vaccine significantly reduces, eliminate, susceptibility catching covid. **greatly** reduces risk hospitalization almost fully eliminates risk death. It’s horrible it’s making people think vaccine useless, that’s simply TRUE. Wearing masks choice ‘new normal’ Americas. aren’t going back old normal. would non reactive mean you’re susceptible getting virus? have, enjoy idiot purposely makes pandemic worse. hope see reflected Belgium well, although haven’t announced anything. don’t get it. mean got covid separate vaccine?  product contains chemicals known State California cause cancer birth defects reproductive harm.

At least hand waft going try. sounds like dumb question, hand washing still emphasized messaging it’s spread droplets aerosols? keep germs spreading minimize burden health system?  Many infectious disease experts predicting quite covid going become permanent endemic disease like colds flu are.  realistically go personal life without ever contacting another human being. go grocery store. People deliver food restaurant house car window. Amazon give pretty much anything else would need. find plenty WFH non contact jobs. wanna quarantine, ball completely court. Made chuckle. Thanks internet stranger :) knew vaccines supposed 100% effective. never time go back ""square one"". meant make it. Accept mortality. No. dont think will. far. act like Trump saying ""Shows won.""

Hate tell ya, stay kids grow up.  need vaccines!! shots !! Lets get shot every week!  state less 30 people Covid hospital week. That’s mask rules gone since CDC announcement. I’ve certainly noticed quality life socialization improve since maskless become normalized again.  Stay home then, force life us still want actually live. banned spreading misinformation beyond me. *constantly* misrepresent data. take Tylenol? I’m also vaccinated also wear mask, nothing fact Covid killed 0.000000437% 17… seem lost ability think critically like look data vaccine efficacy, hospital admissions, fatalities related metrics, make informed decision realize “no, it’s alarming”.

You to, know.  61% right total population 71% eligable. Alberta young people provinces lots unvaccinated people. Also   urban areas like Calgary Edmonton bring provincal average. High level believe 19%.

Isreal brought masks back Alberta going none.... Ahs provincal govenment really done great job controlling covid. faith them. donated time received someone else’s results. Also almost spread among unvaccinated one dose well.  Precisely.  time restrictions end. Vaccines highly effective. choice saving yourself.

I vaccinated, still wear mask. Delta variant broken mRNA vaccines cases. intend one those.  Idea picked up?? think it’s mainly masks don’t protect you; protect people around (unless courses you’re wearing n95). covid don’t wear mask spread it, don’t covid wearing mask protection eh depending type mask makes difference. know covid airborne vaccinated worried get good mask. It’s risk point. 


Also lot people getting sick there’s exposure well everything. immune system isn’t use it.

Work preschool year see immunity increases second year... seriously impressive. No, I’ve completely unsympathetic towards propagated incorrect information.

I provided easily understood evidence saying incorrect, find want. Yet continued argue, needlessly pulled academic history. quite funny, actually. ""Civilized enough"" kill hundred thousands allowing COVID pandemic run rampant. think spelled ""Barbaric"" wrong. don’t think wrong. It’d explain Ontario example drawn reopening (we got lot AZ first shots following mRNA 2nd shots takes time) care ""sounds like."" Yep! 100% agreed. ""Well done daughter!""? I’m saying making choice protect high risk people. painful fuck read. Learn use commas correctly.   surge would inevitably involve delta variant. 60% *one* dose coverage enough control B.1.1.7. UK. Alberta wouldn’t experience kind surge without variant involved.

Considering mRNA vaccines highly effective Delta variant, I’m sure surge would matter majority vaccinated people around them. Plus, Quebec Ontario likely get near exceed 80% coverage. Even Alberta vaccine hesitant, doubt would plateau 65% fully vaccinated, last checked least 69% Albertas population least gotten one dose. live country PVP enabled ""Or seems"" yeah cant say blame couldn’t find details status tested positive. Read 2 articles neither went details. equate combo immune anywhere. natural + 1x mrna 10x-20x studies antibodies 2x mrna prior infection. read stories well, would really like official data. Watch Vincent Racaniello videos. Totally calms down. Start beginning chain. person needlessly condescending? You! thinks saying linear relationship cases deaths means they're uncoupled? You! insulted intelligence needlessly? You! yet nerve ask i'm pulling credentials? massive hypocrite! extremely wrong, conducted horrendeously.  boat. got mad didn’t “consult” him. knew would want 12 15 year olds get it. did. So, asked them. wanted it, didn’t pressure all. three us fully vaccinated now. worry husband Delta variant. vaccines years doses.

It's tested, fine. Yes, like stated, commendable thing protecting people, replying post stating young people making choice don’t want die. sound like saying enough worry about..

The Delta variant virulent deadly before. would say 324 deaths would plenty get get shot considering reported higher level penetration illness younger populations prior strains.

I think 600,324+ reasons get done tell mom dad.

In fact, firm belief President issue executive order indemnifying health pros administer shots child asks. think displayed media governments, talk number need safe, herd immunity. people likely think well said good, reach many percent vaccinated safety threshold. talk vaccine like miracle quick happened, everyone must Trying real hard get ahead variants get first cold since (can’t really remember) I’ll probably same. Ya that’s true, although it’s risk given low efficacy one dose delta variant, safer bet ancestral variants. Glad eventually returned normal, thanks heads may store. appreciate surprised crazy possibilities virus! Except we're already rolling second doses. I'm getting mine couple days.  Vic, NSW, Qld, NT WA, bloody heck weird, though, arm hurt first dose (AZ) second (Moderna). Might needing again. COVID-19 today spread NT WA, doughnuts days last year I'm boomer signed soon eligible. Younger family anti-vax. Checked arm magnet. leave fast enough. That's hope! Would really suck reach herd immunity end year I'm sure.  TRANSLATION: wearing masks life! study 4 years soda drank today? matches experience closely. struggled put words 'off' smell (parosmia), artificial smoky exactly it. Weirdly get things mentioned also peanuts, citrus, cooked pasta.

I'm glad got full smell/taste back 6 months. 4 months post-infection now. young people lowest vaccination rates. Paywall 

Welp least title sums issue well enough............. hope people work got Pfizer, included. felt symptoms worst weren’t particularly healthy (overweight, smokers, sedentary lifestyles). sore arm two days all. I’m pretty active don’t smoke I’m wondering there’s correlation. October Pfizer shipments arrive bulk. Everyone knows AZ second best waiting PF. October we'll rapidly make gains vaccination.

Once reach x% they'll start privileges vaccinated lockdown. I.e. fully vaccinated comply stay home orders/wear masks. persuade even more.

The NSW premier already said reason privileges vaccinated current lockdown low %. expect situation different % higher. much unless willing face parents risk getting kicked house (past 18)/other types punishment (no allowance/WiFi e.g) 

Which chances many age willing do

Heck fokes threatened would kick house shots would either, would happy it? Gosh no, sometimes age gotta stomach bs, wether like You’d surprised. Covid call center nurse here. call positive results patients fully vaccinated, get confused able infected virus. don’t people equate vaccines cure. People pay money ""vaccinated"" russian liquid. thing need know quality. Hillarious. started wearing mask work winter 2018. work healthcare get 3-5 colds every winter moment saw first patient flu like symptoms 2018 decided mask March. I'm going continue every year, especially since found kn94 masks rub mouth. cold since 2018 flu since 2015!! I'm sure get cold year (I young child) least cold come bring home cold work possibly infect whole family. radio station wrong don’t think anti-vax movement necessarily boomer thing. sure see COVID back November vaccine lost taste smell. lost 15 days came back stages. prepared comes back things won’t smell taste awhile. 
After month taste smell came back fully, suddenly eggs, peanut butter, onions tasted smell super bizarre me. corrected two months that. prepared bizarre smell things happen plan immunity disease lacking vaccination option? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣 fReEdOm Good them. Parents idiots. Oh wow, actually SHOCKED! said first shot pretty nasty previously infected COVID-19. Maybe wife exposed?   Agreed - they'll keep borders closed forever snap lockdown indefinitely case that's way achieve elimination outside vaccination. Vaccine supply manageable, hesitancy zero COVID strategy/low transmission long term problem.  places requiring it? Sorry that. vast majority people get Covid mild zero symptoms anyway, even unvaccinated. So, vaccines fine, evidence helped case.  Hospital patients higher average population people unable medically vaccinated. worth making people jump hoops prove Seriously. WTF?

The US enough vaccines various companies - enough vaccinate people times (as ""minimum herd immunity threshold"" ""every-effing-one""). Meanwhile, country neighbors cannot buy vaccine within next months US scrouged market clean.

And now, bloody Americans vaccine hesitancy? Damn Variants! There's still medical religious exemptions. I'm okay medical religious. yep. everyone vaccinated important. means new variants hard fucking time existing.  Every year benefit open enrollment work, sign form stating tobacco user, otherwise I’d charged higher premiums.

Do COVID vaccines. Cover COVID related medical expenses, charge people higher premiums they’re vaccinated. 

Every warning unvaxxed far *might* happen. *might* get sick. *might* die. *might* asymptomatic infect grandma. *might* this, *might* that, nothing virus sure thing they’re willing take chance. let’s make something sure thing - increase premiums decrease paycheck. maybe finally tangible consequences getting vaccinated they’ll finally change mind.

I pretty optimistic next year personally lookup places like Israel, India, US.    get third shot? really need protect child cannot get vaccine yet.

I really give shit wearing little mask face but, eventually, feeling everyone came across public closer animatronic Chuck E Cheese show real person got tiring. I'm introvert. Lol wow.. Guess people going go back caves again. Many emerged, many refused emerge even vaccinated talk variant. 
To own, makes traffic grocery shopping easier rest us Idk civilized letting hundreds thousands people die is. acted lile china response pandemic wouldve lasted fraction time think requiring vaccination perfectly reasonable requirement colleges insurance, exemption you’re otherwise immunocompromised risk group vaccinations. Even insurance companies lobby it, I’d hope aren’t physically able vaccination aren’t penalised it. entire reason mandates herd immunity people protected without vaccination Me, parents, grandparents, several coworkers got covid way vaccine one coworkers ended hospital oxygen.

An interesting benefit Covid prevention common colds flu way down. also hate apparently liking wearing face mask every single hour every day means absolutely 100% means voted Donald Trump got sick dog 2nd shot. know got antibodies. High school biology ftw Teeth cleaning health thing cosmetic lol mask restaurants one biggest security theater bullshit maneuvers I’ve seen yet.  get this, we? correct.

Edit: get joke majority bother getting vaccinated though, even they're parents forbid it. Actually likelihood dying extremely one hundred percent. Disability insurance then. Long hauler swine flu, chiming in….I wish gotten flu shot year sure! 

Fully vaccinated still wearing mask indoors, everywhere. area 50% vaccinated, 5% still wearing masks.  Don’t forget people know someone COVID turned fine weeks time. swear social media makes death sentence. roll eyes point  risk, benefits may outweigh risks people desperate need vaccine. better allow want get jab banning completely risks.   cares though, isn’t pushing lifestyle everyone else let be. Maybe prefers introverted lifestyle. 

Now people calling lockdowns shit get bent Unfortunately plenty people get kids MMR shots either  Frankly don’t give fuck anymore. Screw masks, open everything back let nature takes course. vaccinated strong shall fine literally started hospital January 2020 Florida.

Kinda scared. Think see doctor got source weird picture TV screen?

Yep. I'm guessing 1st grade elementary school requires proof shots. Thanks good tips. uncle partially crippled leg polio, 70 now. got hear lot stories rampant diseases back then. dad also leg braces polio kid.

And bunch anti vax coworkers friends age 45 I'm fed excuses. think boils justification needle phobia. point look rate vaccination among teenagers young adults, still lot unvaccinated gotten it. Many countries require vaccination yellow fever.

And expect large number countries require vaccination Covid-19.

COVID dangerous elderly, would choose to? Taipei, June 27 (CNA) Taiwan reported 89 new COVID-19 cases Sunday, confirmed two previously reported cases involved highly infectious Delta variant disease, according Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said CECC press briefing cluster infections around country one main focuses disease prevention efforts, including one Pingtung County.

The cluster Pingtung originated woman grandson recently returned Taiwan Peru.

Of 12 COVID-19 cases cluster, eight people infected confirmed Delta variant virus, according new genome sequencing results Sunday, Chen said.

Because remaining four cases cluster relatives infected Delta variant, likely also infected variant, Chen said.

The Delta variant COVID-19 first detected India, ""most transmissible"" variants identified far, according World Health Organization (WHO).

The Pingtung cluster involves first locally transmitted cases Delta variant Taiwan, government quarantined 173 contacts patients well stepped vaccination efforts area.

Of 88 domestic cases reported Sunday, 41 New Taipei, 33 Taipei, eight Tainan.
Taoyuan reported three cases, one reported Hsinchu City Pingtung Nantou counties.

The source infection 60 cases identified, 26 investigation, two unknown sources, CECC said.


There also one new COVID-19 case originated outside Taiwan, involving Taiwanese man 20s recently returned Austria.
The nine deaths three men six women 40s 90s, passed away June 22 June 26. chronic illnesses, according CECC.

To date, Taiwan confirmed total 14,634 COVID-19 cases, 13,200 domestic infections reported since May 15, country first recorded 100 cases single day since beginning pandemic.

The number confirmed COVID-19 deaths country risen 632, except 12 recorded since May 15, CECC data shows.

(By Chiang Yi-ching) Parents see kids extension themselves, therefore something control, gross. Kids come yes, individual person. Vaccines work! Saying cautious protect kids, people can't vaccinated, help prevent mutations anywhere close anti vax. Please tell logic anti vax.

The USA bad public messaging covid. moving goal posts scientist learn something new virus spread. science works! Saying covid officially specific date ignoring new evidence really looking science. figure actually manufacture first, seems massive stumbling block.  Oh yeah, small businesses close? people went crazy even killed lockdowns losing livelihoods? easy condescending live developed country either cushy remote job get generous unemployment benefits. happens waitress somewhere Philippines earned maybe $300 month covid support old parents income? Fauci saying people take masks they're vaccinated. WHO. Get boogeymen straight. Absolutely. PHE stated recent study roughly 1k individuals 88% effective delta, Scotland similar study approximately 19k individuals stated 79% effective delta. I’m sure percentage accurate, yes course good news good vaccine.   I’m Pennsylvania. also lift mask mandate tomorrow. I’ve got 3 10, including newborn, reopening things stressful us.  one point can't neglected though children 12 still high risk contracting covid since they're eligible vaccinated. parents want resume social &amp; extracurricular activities summer problematic distancing &amp; masking mandates previously employed spring longer effective. families still huge concern there's clear guidance avoid Delta variant without isolating bubble. particularly true live regions lower vax rates &amp; escalating cases. survey shows majority black people heard Tuskegee scandal, even live long way away. black people heard Tuskegee *more* likely willing participate drug trials, suggesting huge negative effect trust. Perhaps take-away well informed people likely take part drug trials well informed people also likely heard Tuskegee.

Sadly people races likely believe false statement black people injected syphilis part scandal. thought too, honest. Nice relevant analogy.  mean Pfizer 96% effective hospitalization, know there's ton hospitalizations either. course Delta potentially deadly elderly, vaccines remove lot risk. 

88% much different 91% found real world Alpha (the current strain). Definitely! think that's hard fast rules difficult. Things different place place changing every day. Lol that's going get everyone especially US. Sorry say kids get un-vaccinated own. There's much civilization beyond making vaccines 88% effective. prescriptions exactly pharmacies filling infectious diseases?

I time inclination list infectious illnesses treated variety pharmaceutical drugs, throw few, let's start strep throat, certain types pneumonia, various types cold flu, etc. Doctors commonly prescribe medications treat symptoms - like decongestants, cough syrups, etc. - even can't treat actual illness itself. first day going pharmacy knowing COVID vs. going anywhere else?

I mean, people know indication, lots them? Lol I'm glad people know super responsible COVID, lot people aren't, know plenty people tested positive COVID proceeded go pick shit COVID primarily spread pharmacies obviously.

Nobody said was. keep trying focus COVID, again, comment replied specify COVID. exchange went follows:

""I basically never go place higher average concentration sick people without mask - hospital, doctor's office, pharmacy, etc. Probably grocery stores either."" (sick people = specific COVID.)

In response: ""Especially pharmacy ER, literally 100% chance you’re exposed."" assuming mean exposed [to COVID] reading exposed [infectious illnesses kinds].

Nobody said COVID spread primarily pharmacies even likely catch COVID there. said ""literally 100% chance exposed"" pharmacy ER. necessarily agree specific number, yes, insane think likely encounter sick people ER pharmacy versus, say, movie theater mall. Thank sharing experience. 
That really disappointing hear logic based argument shot “regulations met.” US high, extremely high. many countries EU UK similar vacination rate. Annoyingly massive vaccine disparity states US.

For example;

U.S - 56%
UK 62%. takes time go countries statistical sites see, US pretty much par countries extremely high compared countries allowing US citizens travel them.

[vaccine 88 percent effectiveness would still one better vaccines ever created. protein vaccine think similar Novavax.  clusters vaccinated health care workers associated Delta variant

There single outbreak event infected 11 healthcare workers, 1 required oxygen.

But damning vaccinated population across three hospitals, Delta variant associated greater transmissions HCW compared B.1.1.7 B.1.617.1 (mean cluster size 1.1 versus 3.3, p=0.03, Extended Data Figure 1). clusters non-Delta infections comprising ten clusters Delta variant. Importantly, median Ct value B.1.617.2 Delta variant infections 16.5 versus 19 non-Delta (p&lt;0.05, Extended Data Figure 1), consistent higher viral load vaccine breakthrough infections Delta variant responsible. vaccine responses HCW subsequent breakthrough measured appeared similar responses control group HCW test positive SARS-CoV-2 subsequently (Extended Data Figure 1). already wearing masks going parties. Nothing change. fill gaps that's good enough. Let's say, vaccines places like Haiti, Nicaragua, etc. Every bit helps . you’re vaccinated reading statistics breakthrough deaths yeah pretty sure country. may politics affecting viewpoint preventing thinking rationally short list sensible ones I’ve heard:

1.	The vaccine approval absolves companies responsibility side effects. suffer rare life changing unforeseen side effect vaccine, zero possibility compensation family.
2.	Known vaccine side effects downplayed (Heart Inflammation Blood clotting example). Personally I’m pretty sure experienced heart inflammation first dose Pfizer pressure center chest intermittently like two weeks went away. 
3.	Policy makers calling unprecedented “vaccine passports” authoritarian measures, sets true conspiracy theorists believe it’s part global reset plan. 


You governments threatening people losing jobs, ability travel, ability send kids school etc getting vaccine one legal responsibility for. That’s recipe historically real government driven horror shows. Try stress! Things getting better every day I'm sure industry back running full steam soon. lockdown US small outbreak, people would riot streets…oh wait. cases occurring kids (because large numbers adults vaccinated), vaccines moving population effect reduce cases. think careful jumping conclusions. isn’t yet evidence show variant circumvents vaccines meaningful way.  It’s another log covid messaging dumpster fire 

There sort hysteria concerning every variant that’s emerged far . Remember “sense impending doom” Kent variant. ? United States got mosquito bite bump cases bottomed . 

Normal people can’t “see” study variants it’s various health organizations relay message reality say whatever want won’t know heads tails . official says without evidence, vaccines won’t stop delta plus everyone supposed jump ? 

I’m sorry know ton good push get undeveloped world vaccines COVID they’re compromised. still eradicated polio without vaccine mandate I'm getting story. Also vaccine even fully FDA approved, mandate vaccine gone process? issue US seems handling now. fully believe things open people need return normal life, strategy keep transmission low? Yes, say vaccinated matter, does. unvaccinated end filling hospitals provide perfect breeding ground even vaccine resistant variant. unlikely efficacy drop 0 modified shots produced, still something need avoid. Pretty much endless evidence. few:

1. Long covid... Yes, can’t reach enough immunity morons population alternative? morons don’t care safety measures like masks anyway infect people medical conditions soner later. dug little bit Public Health England put study saying Pfizer vaccine 1% effective Delta previous strains. vaccination even effective considered ""immune according Cuba's health authorities. Let's see independent studies international bodies say. effective say, awesome news many place can't afford Pfizer Moderna, slow vaccine rollouts Cuba need sell vaccine someone actually industry expertise mass produce them. Wearing masks like wearing seatbelt drive car social distancing like driving 15 MPH roads. Social distancing big deal hate grouped masking. Considering Sinopharm/Sinovac vaccines hovered around 50-60% efficacy original strain begin with, wonder countries participated China’s ”vaccine diplomacy” handle potential new wave Delta.

Good thing, anyways, Pfizer/Moderna jabs seem okay still Novavax trials seems promising thus far + would offer mRNA-hesitant crowd alternative + vaccine easier store (I think) cheaper produce didn’t determine safe, determined rate blood clot incidents low enough worth continuing distribute it.

That’s rub really. long vaccine harms statistically less people Covid always best policy decision. There’s element utilitarianism play here. oseltamivir still effective covid19 now? country still give oseltamivir antivirus covid19. read journals oseltamivir isnt anything covid 19
I’m considering whether change oseltamivir inosine pranobex/isopronosine post insinuates wearing masks going solve problems past, really didn’t. It’s comes little anti-vaxxy. think people holding getting vaccine going mask up? think mandating drive people get vaccine cause people see light give already have?  witty commentary clever comebacks wish happening aren’t happening. Get log internet bit, may find bit happier far less sour things happening around don’t understand. They're realizing rules parents set unnecessary. teens ""breaking rules."" reminds friend getting state ID behind Mother's back believed signing away life giving government consent ""butcher"" son since registered organ donor. think (and public health officials) also learning smarter ways lockdowns. non-triviality mental health toll become pretty apparent everyone point, needs planned around entire sceince world bashing sputnik properly made, 3rd stage tested, rumors live virus. much controversy confusion sputnik also enough public information readily available public surprise common folk trust thing.

Furthermore, one thing info available vaccine, another easily digestible. even abstract article sometimes confusing dude never read anything remotely connected bio science journal.

I know took time understand it. people time, patience. 

It complicated many.  real world study J&amp;J's performance Beta. real world study Beta AZ. Every vaccine maker less useful lab study PR reasons. said wanted 300k cases day. say that? standard nasal tests test delta variant too? say cities sky high rates. They're good comparable Western European countries reach rates 90%. I'm vaccinated too, continue wear mask, want positive example around me. 
 
One greatest determining factors whether people wore masks people around wearing masks. want *that guy* seen encouraging around *who yet vaccinated* okay go maskless. Because, course, isn't. 
 
I view people wearing masks small-minded, petty self-indulged, since can't bothered minuscule thing help around them. According Cuba. 

More vaccines always good though, hopefully success rate stays optimistic work analyzed impartial authorities. struggling. Deaths new cases US lowest point since beginning pandemic March 2020 still falling sharply despite states opening lifting restrictions. vaccine 90% effective Delta variant 94% effective standard variant. Half country fully vaccinated almost million doses per day still administered. vulnerable population (the elderly) 88% vaccinated. 

You need afraid, friend. Gotcha. Edited! Increasingly, frustrated teenagers searching ways vaccinated without parents’ consent. found way VaxTeen.org, vaccine information site run Kelly Danielpour, Los Angeles teenager. 
 
The site offers guides state consent laws, links clinics, resources straightforward information Covid-19 advice teenagers engage parents. 
 
“Someone ask me, ‘I need able consent vaccine clinic open weekends bus route. help?’” said Ms. Danielpour, 18, begin freshman year Stanford fall. 
 
She started site two years ago, well Covid. daughter pediatric neurosurgeon intellectual property lawyer, realized adolescents know neither recommended vaccine schedule rights. 
 
“We automatically talk parents teens opinions issue,” said. “I decided needed help.” Ms. Danielpour wrangled experts help understand vaccination consent laws, recruited teenagers “VaxTeen ambassadors.” 
 
“I want teenagers able say pediatricians, ‘Hey, right,’” added Ms. Danielpour, gives talks conferences physicians health department officials. 
 
Elizabeth surreptitiously got vaccine school pop-up clinic. 
 
After administrators boarding school informed parents would offering Covid shots, mother gave permission. father forbade it. Upset, Elizabeth consulted school nurse, said could vaccinated without approval both. Elizabeth researched state laws, learning wasn’t old enough consent own. 
 
She showed anyway. worst, figured, school would turn away. 
 
Apparently, took note mother’s consent. Saying nothing, Elizabeth stuck arm. 
 
Now pickle. school requiring students vaccinated fall semester says father begun warring administration issue. Elizabeth afraid learns vaccinated, furious tell school, discipline deceived vaccinators, stain record applying college. 
 
Gregory D. Zimet, psychologist professor pediatrics Indiana University School Medicine, pointed irony adolescent legally prevented making choice strenuously urged public health officials. Developmentally, said, adolescents 14 even younger least good adults weighing risks vaccine. “Which isn’t say adults necessarily great it,” added. 
 
In many states, young teenagers make decisions around contraception sexually transmitted infections, are, noted, “in many ways complex fraught getting vaccine.” 
 
Pediatricians say even parents vaccinated wary children. Dr. Jay Lee, family physician chief medical officer Share Selves, community health network Orange County, Calif., said parents say would rather risk child Covid get new vaccine. 
 
“I validate concerns,” Dr. Lee said, “but point waiting see child gets sick good strategy. no, Covid like flu.” 
 
Elise Yarnell, senior clinic operations manager Portland, Ore., area Providence, large health care system, recalled 16-year-old girl showed Covid vaccine clinic school Yamhill County. 
 
Her parents oppose vaccine wanted get without knowing, could legally Oregon’s age consent 15. teared saw shots ready home, able return night without alerting parents vaccinated. 
 
“She extremely relieved,” Ms. Yarnell said. 
 
Isabella 17-year-old daughter Charisse, Delray Beach, Fla., mother refuses grant permission vaccine. Asked wanted shot, Isabella gave stream reasons. “A lot older people family risk catching Covid possibly dying,” said. “I want get vaccine around them, they’ll safe. go friends again, won’t much risk either.” 
 
Although doctors trying instill vaccine confidence parents well patients, there’s much parents object. Recently, Dr. Mobeen H. Rathore, pediatrics professor University Florida medical college Jacksonville, told patient whose mother refused consent couldn’t get Covid vaccine turned 18, three weeks hence. 
 
“She got vaccinated birthday,” Dr. Rathore said. “She sent message saying birthday gift herself.”

As Parents Forbid Covid Shots, Defiant Teenagers Seek Ways Get Them 
 
By Jan Hoffman|Jun. 26th, 2021 
 
Most medical consent laws require parental permission minors get vaccine. places easing restrictions Covid shots others proposing new ones. 
 
When mother Florida teenager blocked getting Covid vaccine, 15-year-old uninvited friend’s party continues feel excluded many social events remains unvaccinated. 
 
Teenagers keep sorts secrets parents. Drinking. Sex. Lousy grades. 
 
But secret Elizabeth, 17, rising high-school senior New York City, keeps new buffet adolescent misdeeds. doesn’t want parents know vaccinated Covid-19. 
 
Her divorced parents equal say health care. Although mother strongly favors vaccine, father angrily opposes threatened sue mother Elizabeth gets shot. Elizabeth keeping secret father, also mother, mom plausible deniability. (Elizabeth asked identified middle name.) 
 
The vaccination children crucial achieving broad immunity coronavirus returning normal school work routines. though Covid vaccines authorized children young 12, many parents, worried side effects frightened newness shots, held permitting children get them. 
 
A recent poll Kaiser Family Foundation found three 10 parents children ages 12 17 intended allow vaccinated immediately. Many say wait long-term safety data prod school mandate. many teenagers eager get shots see unlocking freedoms denied pandemic, tensions crackling homes parents holding hard no. 
 
Forty states require parental consent vaccination minors 18, Nebraska sets age 19. (Some states carve exemptions teenagers homeless emancipated.) Now, Covid crisis, states cities seeking relax medical consent rules, emulating statutes permit minors obtain HPV vaccine, prevents cancers caused sexually transmitted virus. 
 
Last fall, District Columbia Council voted allow children young 11 get recommended vaccines without parental consent. New Jersey New York legislatures bills pending would allow children young 14 consent vaccines; Minnesota one would permit children young 12 consent Covid shots. 
 
But states marching opposite direction. Although South Carolina teenagers consent 16, doctors may perform certain medically necessary procedures without parental permission even younger children, bill Legislature would explicitly bar providers giving Covid shot without parental consent minors. Oregon, age medical consent 15, Linn County ordered county-run clinics obtain parental consent Covid shot anyone 18. According National Conference State Legislatures, tracking Covid-related bills, states, including Tennessee Alabama, working legislation prevent public schools requiring Covid shots. 
 
The issue consent Covid shots providing fresh context decades-old legal, ethical medical questions. parents disagree, arbiter? age children capable making health decisions determined? 
 
“Isabella wants friends getting it, doesn’t want wear mask,” said Charisse, mother 17-year-old Delray Beach, Fla., asked last name withheld family privacy. Charisse fears shot could effect daughter’s reproductive system (a misperception public health officials repeatedly refuted).  
 
“Isabella said, ‘It’s body.’ said, ‘Well, it’s body you’re 18.’” 
 
As legal debates family arguments unfold, administering vaccine pharmacies, clinics medical offices trying determine proceed young teen shows Covid shot without parent. 
 
“We may legal gray zone vaccine,” said Dr. Sterling Ransone Jr., family physician Deltaville, Va. health system, parent send signed consent form teenager vaccinated. Covid vaccine authorized emergency use, health system requires parent present patient 18 get shot. 
 
Marina, 15, lives Palm Beach County, Fla., — who, like others interviewed, asked fully identified — longs shot. mother says absolutely not. subject open discussion. 
 
And Marina excluded social life covets. “Five friends throwing party invited me, said, ‘Are vaccinated?’” said. “So can’t go. hurts.” 
 
As pandemic ebbs, teen social circles reconstituting based vaccination status. “I see friends posting social media — ‘Woo-Hoo got it!’ — see them, ask things like, ‘Where been? traveling lot? sure don’t Covid?’ sucks can’t get shot,” Marina continued. 
 
1/2 elders could hunker watch tv. drop food essentials doors. Yeah, mixing vax number like month ago case number. Wrong one. weird, watched Trump rally last night something conversation giving Deja Vu. 

Ah, that’s it, it’s old, old record player repeat feeling. Try new argument, one’s dud. studies large datasets show vaccines working. enough data make conclusions. possible data wrong, sure, reason think right now. Yeah know smoking. beginning pandemic vaccine 88% effective we'd pretty stoked. going spread mutate people get booster every years similar flu, effective can't mutate fast. Eventually might get vaccine targets spike protein resistant mutations. Link please? data? correlative transmission analysis? so: Transmission analysis proof Delta contagious, harmful, deadly, vaccine-resistant previous strains. Delta displacing previous strains (which believe true; that's mutations work) proof dangerous. term “anti-vax” used culturally reference resistance vaccines. we’re changing term mean hesitation towards vaccine existence made aware change. slap together variants booster bam: done. That’s whole advantage mRNA vaccines: new RNA segment shows seems concerning, slap concerning mutation mix. assume 351 mutation approval gets through, end like flu vaccines inject ~600 people, see results approve there. large US extremely high rates high quality vaccinations compared pretty much countries point? never said wasn’t even said exact opposite, thanks trying talk villainize me. Meanwhile Colombia, vaccine rollout slow masks gone away first place. attitude kills elders, logic don’t think deeply means example it'd given cohort 105 people get COVID, expect 5 vaccinated. Obligation. gives vibe choice whether follow not, choosing piece shit Corona Mary! Close, 95% efficacy would expect 105 cases, 100 would unvaccinated people. despite immunocompromised insanely healthy individual receiving vaccine.

I certainly discount underlying medical conditions. legitimate reasons people worried. people see medical professional plan care accordingly.

But vast majority people, vaccination non-event. I'm sorry one extreme issues, still extreme minority. I'm frustrated. year half living pandemic, difficult patience people care anyone themselves. mean better straight talk right safe go crowded club gym without mask cases low vaccine effective, might change future. tailor recommendations case levels.

Mask feel safe place. dont think mask anything fully vaccinated though. whatever puts peace mind, it. Precursor climate lockdowns. future.  There's much done anyway. People goi g wear masks rest Covid's existence considering appear going anywhere anytime soon.

I happily take special precautions around people like asked, eventually everyone wants get groceries without mask. even library library India different? :) Yes reading beers cigs friends.  That’s entirely case. They’re really pretty similar J&amp;J performed better variants clinical trials though wasn’t quite good AZ two UK study (but maybe 2% different). Also J&amp;J’s effectiveness increased forward day 57 compare numbers day 57 J&amp;J numbers actually better two dose AZ. 

Regardless though won’t large number 18s cause spike? rollout plan like US use Pfizer? also required employment. Nearly every job requires least occasional interaction people. want get hired USA, show proof legally work. Make must show proof vaccination well. refuse, ineligible unemployment. Same! Socialised larger group people first time months, got cold first time year. forgot horrible colds are. guess porn plain hiding family avoid confrontation/chores. even library options really open up. purpose youthful rebellion. test credulity parents unbelievable beliefs.

What's Beta anyway? fading largely restricted Africa? anything makes scared India's actual numbers were. amount people vaccinated? Please link heard that? know UK, many countries Europe mandated ban visiting people. countries really enforceable (for various reasons, legal), do. E.g. Greece issued pretty hefty fines people visiting others even higher fines hosts. I’m poor Mixing vaccinations bit risk it? think studies completed yet showed safe effective, maybe I'm wrong. decided UK information say would work. justification needle phobia

The needle vaccine tiny even kid hates needles barely noticed shot. maybe publicize this. super easy shot get. steaming pile! Safety trials approvals though would look straight eye tell point start accepting risk life again. 

Stay locked indoors forever agree. dare try make rest us live fear we're vaccinated. 

The rest us continue lives fully vaccinated.

Covid going anywhere accept live covid like flu. 

H1N1 still around Spanish Flu. Covid same. Even Singapore changing tune moved away covid 0 live -
 Control freak parents much? Get tp first Yeah. barely felt first one go in. quick. sore. second one hurt. injected slowly. hurt like week after, kept waking night even. also got Pfizer. What's positivity rate? Nice fresh! Sure, sure, there's special layer crazy legal (or practical) guardians prevent kids right thing.  people likely die covid vaccinated, obviously deaths going vaccinated people Plus beginning biggest wave yet Delta spreading, going convince many people undecided getting vaccine, thinking skipping second dose. 

To stop delta, need 80%+ people fully vaccinated, think happen 12 cannot receive it, yet. vaccine uptake 12-16 year olds quite low. mean ethically speaking. Consenting sex consenting medical procedure (like vaccination). Don’t forget new line Novichok perfume! Jesus fucking autistic comment says can't contact sports? Rugby, football American Football playing grassroots competitive weekend... Kids can't consent.
That's logic says 13 year old boy can't consent sex, even says consents matter can't sex kids. Even 16yo boy consents vax, consent binding parent needed consent behalf. 


That's medical services kids work situations around world. Parent agree medical procedure kid, otherwise medical personel right procedure.   think way big dick. Yes risk low, people, could infect?
This big problem pandemic. douchebags would suffer, would ok. decision consequences. unfortunately doesn’t work way. I'm waiting get invite. Oh yes sir, yesterday biggest migraine pain muscles joints. Still happy tho :D It’s analogous telling scientist gravity makes pen fall *upwards*, scientist pure nonsense. like telling anti vax person vaccines beneficial, anti vaxxer deep hole bullshit can’t even see light top anymore. Maybe you, also become carrier spread cannot protect it.

I work supermarket. public large. avoid getting sick, also took many precautions prevent that. hope precautions also helped prevent others getting sick me. Consensus effects felt much second dose, hang problem involves engaging conversation. want to, I've gotten better conversations brick wall. people generally want engage meaningful discussion someone outside group since might, y'know, cause actually think. have, vaccine rollout going pretty well Yup “young people” young vaccinated. anti vax person magnet arm test coin surprisingly didn’t work claimed happens random times random people. Personally think 50’s vaccinated restrictions lifted. 

I’m sure international travel true reality vulnerable vaccinated.

But concede point impact young. 

Coming two years enjoying life, finding love figuring life horrible them. unmeasured damage mental health too. plenty volunteers trials various Covid vaccines candidates, adverse vaccine effects tend appear within short time, months years.

In addition, stage *100's millions* people taken various vaccine candidates. rarer side effects occur range 1:100,000 rarer discovered.

So certainly thoroughly tested, waiting couple years Pfizer trial wrap (for one example), potential utility booster doses least one larger trials.  Yes issue lies people don’t get vaccine vaccine kids, think virus hoax continue merry way sending kids school spreading virus. Side effects really rough

I appreciate may bad reaction, think helpful generalize like that.

The *vast* majority people little side effects. RKI slow declaring new virus variant countries, Portugal added 11 days already data Delta variant circulating Lisbon. True, point I’m trying make sane argument change anti vaxxers opinion. spreading anti-anti-vax Facebook might… understood new numbers Germany, Finland Denmark, current calendar outdated deliveries moderna around 130-150k/week starting second third week July. indeed 200 august. see. Maybe Belgium passed extra doses Moderna order let countries get extra share. zullen zien. Technically, living also guarantees death, sure damnest prevent long possible... least smart ones (and without crippling mental illness) do. course wont stay Lisbon, already everywhere Lisbon.  argument doesn’t work since anti vax people think vaccine guarantee death. I'm optimistic. states vaccination rate ages 60+ surpasses 80% 

The majority Germans age group 45 65 ages severely affected covid infections. Thus hopefully willing get vaccinated.

We 44.4 million first shot. Ignoring vaccination minors far getting 75% adults (52.5 million) much further. Extrapolating numbers, expect weekly deliveries Belgium Moderna 100k doses per week July, 200k August, 250k September. **Jun. 27, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

No. It’s joke. Maybe tasteless one, parents risking kid dying severe health problems entire life, don’t think there’s need tact here. not? don’t faith Modern medical science, wrong Job anyway. Go work natural healing yoga studio.  able get vaccinated without signature legal guardian old people, old enough seen pre-vaccination epidemics (first vaccinations delivered 1960s, think) know many children siblings succumbed illness everyone vaccinated against.

Helps take mind needle think getting eat favorite food immidiately afterwards Yeah, risk miniscule either way, get push get vaxed - end hospital anyway one else super curious whole 'reading' library thing about? Looking big picture - yes, better donate. would argue would make public health sense donate vaccines instead using people less 40 years old.

On hand, would really unfair vaccinated people could travel easily young people would year two get vaccine abundant every country, even low-income one.
Young people already one year stolen them, repercussions reperations mental health issues older folks caused upon people like friends, would controversial Vax old people. vax young person died covid anyway, creating image person could hurt covid government protecting person, reality people young unnecessary lockdowns 450 days without consent.  dunno, worth hassle me, especially since need 2 shots, like can't even get right one go young person feel like sacrifice ourself boomers. actually need find job get things done can't staying home like retired person.

It's less dumb calculated risk. too, though thankfully arent entirely anti vax? refuse get covid shot say tested enough dont know long term side effects

not arguing ever works, always try point getting covid isnt exactly FDA approved dont know long terms damn thing either Yes, exposure sites times places someone infectious. contact tracing teams identify, isolate interview cases use inform public.

Here's current NSW map transmission. look like much speed nature cases worrying. Plus spread across country last days   Side effects really rough. vaccinated now, informed well would react getting vaccine, would second thoughts. colds rhinovirus that's everyone sees right now. Covid patients getting hospitalized one thing common, vaccinated. Fully vaccinated hospitalized odd exception exceptions always dealed with.

Well, that's reassessing usage is,   wrong. Corticosteroids “always” used temporary immunosuppressants hypoxic Covid patients. used wide variety medical purposes, varying dosage, schedule, etc.


I mentioned steroids used treatment minimally needed. related covid treatment.


You misread wrote assumed I'm misrepresenting information. Chill Science q: viruses develop resistance vaccines mechanism/process natural selection bacteria develop antibiotic resistance? behave differently?

I remember reading someone somewhere say works differently can't find I'm sure exactly look ground truth. 

Some people talk existence vaccines means guaranteed evolutionary pressure virus develop resistant strain want understand true is. Someone super laissez faire lockdowns tomorrow explain serious new Delta variant is. family fully vaccinated time now. live state average vaccine rates. 


Should going bars restaurants now? parents 65+. swear every time think making progress news taking ten steps back. Masks even full MRNA vaccines? I’m gonna kill parents go bar stop family dinner? Israel way they’re talking, seems like Pfizer vaccine isn’t shit Delta variant. 


Please someone followed closely please give truth. Vaccines recipient. Go Toronto! Don’t fucking stupid. manufacturing exactly snuff.  Great news. might become available countries South America places can’t afford vaccines. 

Also uses different technique, thinking new techniques might seeing vaccines diseases future.

The downside requires 3 shots two weeks apart. logistics outside Cuba might problematic—though hope not. never going binary scenario. seems likely highly vaccinated areas still outbreaks, means peak lower time due higher higher immunity. mention starts looking like vaccines need reformulated, fairly straightforward do. South good position. also care chose this.

There's much do. 98 95 increasing chances 2.5x, could indeed call 2x less effective certain perspective, nevertheless risk may still low enough. guess like half empty vs. half full glass. I’m thinking we’re gonna see increase vaccine uptake late Summer Early Fall (I.e September-Thanksgiving) two groups people:

1. Vaccine hesitant people finally decide get there’s 4-5 months general population availability major side effects, concern flu season possibility “twindemic”. 

2. People fence haven’t gotten shot yet since it’s mandatory work, decide get see relatives Thanksgiving Christmas safely.  can’t. 

Start people *have* work matter what. (Hi, I’m one them.) Hospital workers there. Public safety workers, police, firefighters, paramedics, show up. Agricultural workers show food isn’t rotting field animals aren’t starving. Everyone supply chain gets food agriculture plate show up. Pharmacists. Plumbers, electricians, trades, stuff still breaks fixed. Truck drivers. Factor support industries, truckers need gas, pharmacies need medication shipments. large portion country *can’t* lock down. That’s didn’t work first time. 

Now consider people got little freedom back. even ones planning big vacations, Average Joe realized half-assed “lockdown” much missed going gym. You’re going need real goddamn emergency take back cause resent politician responsible, right? governors going real careful walking back reopening. They’re going need strong justification, don’t one point. I’m tired people care anymore. Enjoy ventilator! may actually willing pay that... Stupidly poor uptake would much better title. 

I don’t see gap. implies discrepancy two things. Whats really concerning israel go data dashboard, see towns seeing new outbreaks many people vaccinated outbreaks occurring towns 65, 70, even 80% population fully vaccinated. evidence back statement it’s mainly conservatives?  That's vaccine effectiveness calculations work. 95% effectiveness mean 5% people going get sick. people realize this... People short memories  ol' ""news"" headlines over. circlejerk haha stupid _____ want. much done front. Hopefully time one reason another changes. enough people close relatives died. COVID ""hold beer"". Yeah, understand mechanics airborne disease transmission. (Your hypothetical model bit oversimplified since infectee contact one person, perhaps instead hundreds thousands people walking around big city attending weddings flying aircraft. people vaccinated helps, stop anything.) 

I also know large fraction population needs vaccinated vaccination program work. know reputable authority thinks 40-50% kind magic threshold highly transmissible disease longer spread. people talking 80 90% depending contagious organism is. Delta variant 2x contagious Alpha variant, way. Future variants may come along even worse billions people continue incubate virus next years (though sure hope not!). 

And course, worldwide, number people vaccinated date 10 15%, take several years make substantial progress this. seen, big outbreaks countries rapidly spread home countries small number months, especially travel restrictions, social distancing, masking eliminated. aware article UK right? referencing England, regions UK crossed threshold yet. Apparently left bit confused!

It part continental Europe, continental Europe. separate entity. 


'Europe Half adults 30 given covid vaccine' implies half adults 30 Europe given vaccine, far case. That's I've trying explain many people understand 95% effective 95% covid patients unvaccinated. Also ""surge"" like 100-200 daily cases. Compared 10,000+ daily cases peak. think something highlighted wonder long covid circulates undetected population starts show up? find hard believe cases linked one person bringing accidentally.  Yeah I'm thinking, things taste like now?

My symptoms pretty mild too. tiny fever day, basically common cold symptoms week. lung issues anything like that. lethargy afternoons.

I'm also somewhat young (31) quite healthy. Considering people catch asymptomatic, I'm actually unlucky lucky. Either way, condolences father law. Unfortunately, dumb people take others Lots Darwin awards handed next months... maybe years lol america disaster messaging wise. Follow rules year this. told two weeks slow spread, weeks, months... got vaccine it’s still enough Israel UK

I don’t deny CDC came recommendations masks blue based science vaccines effective cases low. think likely happen places without high vaccinations see increases . Thankfully there’s less people less density areas compared cities virus spreads insanely fast short answer would politics Brazil worst India people use sort excuse get it. one person family decided can't really explain why. I'm happy got it.  exactly endgame that? low cases need us able unmask? body evidence pretty much suggest vaccinated individuals extremely low risk carry transmit virus? know accidental. proper authoritarian leader knows always keep peons state controllable fear. doesn’t hit right COVID people take months number 66% got story UK counts everything mild depression full blown can’t move -  COVID scary strange shit bruh Use commerical pharmacy. experience registering kids typing birthdate web form. check ID pharmacy, teen necessarily state ID. Get adult accompany you. Yes, that’s literally said comment. political movement vaccination, however, almost entirely conservative one. live Florida want die everyday. count? little ironic 
And, yeah, really think Alternative link: wait, point that? mean get it’s great people get vaxxed contest site inoculate day middle pandemic, sake holding record, don’t get it. Many stupidly still think hoax. I've hearing odd effect women's menstruation, gives parents hesitancy, especially teens going puberty. Heart problems boys. lot media coverage it, almost non-existent. Yes, understand efficacy vaccines, really know long term effects be, shit like swept rug reeks conspiracy. J &amp; J shot, example, one no-profit vaccines, scapegoated victimized, others causing slew side-effects praised pushed media. balanced - causes distrust. agree you.👍 Exactly. certain number people hospitalized even die flu every year, flu vaccines far pretty lukewarm numbers. 60% *good* year. 

People fully vaccinated Covid significantly safer Covid people get flu shots annual flu, including risk hospitalization death. 

As long severe illness control, we’re good place. panic stop. us too. vacation plans next month, whole family vaccinated then. Hopefully one-month wait LOL. I'm guessing \*that\* quick eh?

Also, time new strain comes, think US Covid-19 much control? Cause hope new strain happen time soon! hope comes, it'll sometime next year everything pretty much gone back normal. ""As long resource sustain it""

Relevant line comment I'd initially replied to.  ones delivered bilateral agreements. countries US donating vaccines receive covax. correct. CDC also tracks breakthroughs result deaths. 750 June 21st. would expect someone support position one way  Ohhh see you’re saying. reading comprehension fail end. bad. So… basically looking say “of course not”? ages people? understanding happened Israel vaccinated people tested positive, asymptomatic. People fully dosed identified widespread testing, symptoms... zero % symptomatic, hospitalized dead. whole point vaccines. People still going get Covid, outcomes going far less deadly vaccinated people. important remember see serious efficacy drop, fairly straightforward rather quick alter mRNA vaccines (I know others). IIRC 3 months turnaround boosters arms. like antivirus computer, would expect update point. things stand *this moment*, data yet suggest necessary.

This say mitigate transmission. jus we're exactly ground 0 pre-vaccination. necessarily need limit transmission *any cost possible* anymore. CDC political figure head. Carter changed disease control something controllable beholden political interests. people working cautious now. Basically expect CDC speak last. Well, experts shouldn’t make announcements like “it’s ok vaccinated people go without masks life like before” then. don’t wait making statements freely? perfectly fine safe, wearing mask fully vaccinated. fine science changing seems policy people aren’t great understanding society moves slower virus spreads. removed masks prematurely possibly take people willing throw back on, particularly warm weather.

I reading gains life expectancy last decade US wiped last year.  Good vaccines improve better things get  military dictatorship controls spread information country. automatically non-credible. 

That's they're lying success happening. means much false information spread, hard tell what's true what's misinfo. That's putting hands credible sources important, actually good say need know sure.

I scare you. taking look contact tracing find biggest spreader even exceeding restaurants etc. private gatherings.

The US even try enforce restrictions before. states put advisories lesser certain number people over, certain number households house, cops never sent ticket people many cars driveway.

I definitely see real restrictions politically tenable right now. Perhaps it’s due vaccine demand vaccine shortage? 18+ sign increased demand think weekend especially supposed one bumper periods. Long term it'll probably combo flu covid vaccine uploaded vaccination information PCP, showing Janssen. thinking blocker give Pfizer Moderna. hadn’t update records, could called scheduled “first” vaccination.

NEW DELHI—As coronavirus cases rose rapidly across India April, 70-year-old woman died home eastern state Bihar. rapid antigen test Covid-19 positive, lung scan indicated viral pneumonia “possibility Covid infection.”

But Shila Singh’s death hasn’t counted among India’s Covid-19 toll.

India officially recorded 390,000 coronavirus deaths, families lost loved ones, health experts statisticians say vastly undercounts true toll. Families like Mrs. Singh’s left struggling get compensation states set Covid-19 victims.


India’s undercount also left huge gap world’s understanding impact Delta variant, health experts believe helped drive one world’s worst Covid-19 surges April May. India first detect highly infectious variant, hopscotched around world. fueling surge U.K., expected become dominant variant U.S.

An accurate count Covid-19 infections deaths “a important part understanding big threat new variants are,” said Christopher Murray, director University Washington’s Institute Health Metrics Evaluation.

The institute’s modeling suggests true Covid-19 death toll India exceeds 1.1 million, close three times reported number. Dr. Murray estimates scale undercount similar countries Latin America Africa. said institute estimates India detected 3% 5% infections due insufficient testing.

Murad Banaji, mathematician Middlesex University London tracking pandemic India, estimates country’s real death toll could around five times reported figure, based partly mortality serosurvey data, shows presence antibodies population.

The undercounting infections deaths problem world-wide, even countries widespread testing. World Health Organization said last month global Covid-19 death toll could two three times official number. problem, however, particularly acute developing world, access healthcare coronavirus testing often limited.

Health experts point number issues led widespread undercounting India. One hospitals turning patients away April May rapid rise cases overwhelmed healthcare system. left many people die home without tested Covid-19.

At time Mrs. Singh tested positive, family tremendous strain disease, according son, Neeraj Shekhar. tested positive five days earlier, Mrs. Singh’s husband two teenage grandchildren tested positive day did.

To qualify Covid-19 compensation payment 400,000 rupees, equivalent $5,400, state requires report certified lab, time taking days process. family got test strip lab indicating Mrs. Singh positive rushed doctor.

The physician, Dr. N.P. Narain, said ordered CT scan told family take Mrs. Singh hospital condition worsened. “At time probably didn’t think would need proper documentation,” said.


With multiple members family sick, Mrs. Singh’s condition deteriorated rapidly died five days testing positive. family could use state compensation pay nearly $1,300 medical bills racked caring family members Covid-19, said Mr. Shekhar.

Health experts say many Covid-19 deaths gone uncounted among India’s vast population rural poor, little access healthcare Covid-19 testing. village Sirondhan northern state Uttar Pradesh, example, Vijay Pal Singh said 38-year-old wife, Mithilesh Devi, fell ill last month fever struggled breathe. Mr. Singh said took village clinic several hospitals district, none available beds testing kits.

“She died home, gasping oxygen,” Mr. Singh said. death wasn’t included official Covid-19 tally, added.

At least 30 people died village late April early May, many suffering Covid-like symptoms, according villagers social workers. 47 died two neighboring villages.


Villager Dharamvir Singh said one two people died almost every day worst weeks second wave. says believes four members family infected. one tested.

“The official numbers, least village others close us, totally wrong,” Mr. Singh said.

A senior official Uttar Pradesh government said underreporting Covid-19 deaths, state doesn’t plan revise update official death tally.

Mr. Banaji, mathematician, says central government tended praise states low death counts castigate higher counts incompetent. “This narrative success failure centered fatality numbers dangerous,” said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office didn’t respond requests comment. India’s health ministry said government regularly emphasized need robust systems monitor report cases deaths districts.

Some states cities India revised death tolls criticism politicians judges, experts say adjustments fall far short. Maharashtra, home financial capital Mumbai, weekslong effort added 8,000 deaths official tally. capital city New Delhi also revised infection death counts, increasing 44,000 700 respectively, midst second wave April.

A recent investigation state Bihar found nearly 4,000 Covid-19 deaths, raising toll 72%. included deaths home, well private hospitals health complications related Covid, said Dr. Sunil Kumar, Bihar state secretary Indian Medical Association.


To death counted, families produce test results certified lab confirmation infection healthcare system—but often, like Mrs. Singh’s family, don’t required paperwork. Dr. Kumar said treated patients died suffering common Covid-19 symptoms, families couldn’t produce positive test deaths weren’t included recent count.

“The figures could higher based seeing,” said numbers decent... high actually ^(crybaby) it’s really infuriates me. actions keep restrictions us. seems end finally horizon, new narrative 'delta variant, delta variant!'. hard blame conspiracy theorists point. risk contracting Covid vaccinated minuscule makes sense vaccinated people return normal life. here. pull mask people come within 20 ft. already said dense people absolutely fucking idea individuals older immunocompromised, stop trying dissuade people getting shot. part problem too.

You seem suggesting covid live mucus membranes long enough great enough quantity cause positive test, able invade cells. mechanism continuing test positive post-infection different - genetic material cells continue replicate small quantities. can't find research supports suggesting, would appreciate share. Yeah gotta take care teachers , get . I’d go far offering early full retirement teachers compromised certain age.

Again , problem ever changing metrics . first classroom safety measures, lower levels infection community need teachers vaccinated kids need vaccinated we’re bogeyman variants they’ll perpetual stream . It’s racket unions it’s leaving public sour taste certainly would not, study used israeli data set months ago. quick study US excess mortality numbers adjusted factors unusually low flu deaths shows US published figures Covid deaths indeed short actual. egregiously so, figures available US health officials hiding anything. like realities reporting mid pandemic imperfect. Doctors crunch going set aside dying patients perfect previous day's paperwork. everyone makes hospital, expresses concern symptoms die home ""natural causes"".

Historically retrospective analysis pandemics epidemics wars famines rely first population census excess mortality figures. Less forthright reporting political reasons one many reasons official numbers might thrown off. virus deadly, would lot reasons people get vaccine. Risks vs. benefits, that's it. younger age categories, risks vs. benefits balance 60+! you’re fully vaccinated it’s safe anything according CDC Noooooo. fact 750 breakthrough deaths significantly lower run rate flu trapped pandemic mode nothing politics.

Glad seem recovering, gives hope. hundreds thousands? We’re talking country billion people poor sanitation abject poverty, countless many die without ever seeing hospital doctor, simply get taken straight cremated. could easily well million excess beyond reported numbers. We’ll never know full extent it.  Kappa seems immune evasion, spread easily Delta, right big issue given still large numbers vulnerable people.

Once get close herd immunity (which going while, given high transmissibility Delta large numbers unvaxxed people), variants antigenically distinct (and descendents) like Beta, Gamma (and P clade variants) Theta get turn. reason think natural immunity less effective one vaccines?

Very unfortunate visa holders, however. Anti-covid idiots brigade sub haven’t noticed good job many people reddit singing praises 4-5 years ago. say vaccinated need wear masks

They never said go without mask, make choice.

I choose continue wearing masks, science says yet. 97 year old great grandmother survived covid like boss dose vaccine. Y’all still believing bullshit? lol far I've read measurements example asymptomatic covid people. numbers true got covid actually suffered symptoms.

It take bit dig up, try find study you. recollection hospital system Israel participants PCR tested reasonable interval, gave good confidence people experiencing asymptomatic infections large. Aus contract make 40 million az.

They donating 20 million. 

Current vaccination use aus like 6 million mix az pziler.

But many second doses need delivered.

Most likely Oct az used aus. Dont u think past year evidence based studies interventions took long? People objectively dumb selfish, ones anyway. could saving lives instead they're complaining people are. 

As pre-2020 pandemic plans, science evolves. That's works. Scientists thought people would selfish right thing, China tested waters showed us could it. Many lives saved NPIs that. Risk mad cow disease? Absolutely overblown, mask effective. Everyone wearing masks super effective. wearing mask still reduces chance getting lot. short ago, posted German government's delivery estimates various vaccines June July: EU countries get vaccines equal shares relative population size, estimates used basis estimates countries well.)

**In light Moderna's announcement week deliver anticipated July, updated estimates German ministry Health:**

For **July**, expect 1.33 million doses **Moderna** vaccine per week (instead previous estimate 733000 per week).

And apparently Germany expects receive 2.57 millionen doses **Moderna** per week **August**, 2.95 millionen per week **September**. 

---

If figures hold true, would significant boost, numbers top sizeable Pfizer deliveries.

As noted before, long-term predictions J&amp;J (quality issues), Astrazeneca (reliability issues). German article linked claims German government received deliveries allow distribute 5 million doses Astrazeneca 1 million doses J&amp;J state governments next week. seems regular, weekly deliveries, one-off came (with aforementioned issues still ruling future predictions).  I’m confident education data analysis better yours. It’s basically degree. You’re blocked now. time aggression. lol found one wild!! Sadly places like PNG need vaccine hesitant

Also lots nations infrastructure treat rare serious complications az. Indonesia 5% people fully vaccinated, going **really** bad upcoming weeks. upside prioritized health personnel vaccination campaign, maybe least medical staff able work without catching COVID mild symptoms - even COVID breaks vaccines, usually little symptoms far easier ""bear"" COVID, vacinnes far really high effectiveness hospitalizations/deaths caused severe COVID. problems sleeping thinking get offered J&amp;J.

You're blatantly ignoring basics viruses vaccines work selfishly return ""normal"" life.

This really tells everything need fully vaccinated, that’s safe you’re gonna get.  get cold - chances young healthy, given good chance asymptomatic begin with

Did know people asymptomatic mild cases still end long -term covid damage? Read day someone who's sense taste fucked coffee tastes like dirty dishwater. know eventually there'll variant current vaccines effective against?

You're willfully ignorant impressively short-sighted. vaccine silver bullet. Asking continued caution vaccines roll really asking much especially since we're expecting kids able vaccinated couple months. us stuck inside others would like leave homes feeling safe well. hey, ok *shallow, horrible person* guess much concern you, right?

We've lost time, wtf makes special? updates blood clots linked J&amp;J vaccine? already received shot know extremely rare find weird hasn’t update since early May. Im really wondering much cases are. OK, I'm doctor scientist researched lot covid vaccines order understand also able discuss details anyone afraid vaccines. way understand it, companies make clinical trials 2 groups. One take vaccine take placebo. monitor groups set period time test suffered severe symptoms covid sides. take percentage group compare them. results less 100% means group got vaccine also got covid severe (needing hospitalization) ones got covid placebo group. true vaccines. prevent infection, compared unvaccinated people x% effective preventing symptoms.  
As far I've read measurements example asymptomatic covid people. numbers true got covid actually suffered symptoms. turns mRNA vaccines way better ever anticipated.

...with higher incidence side effects, double required doses, complicated logistics, less durable earlier variants (the South Africa study).

anybody depending 'reasoning' social media hivemind make medical decisions consequence loved ones think real hard things. current vaccination rate, vaccines used mean ct significantly better uk 4 weeks ago began spreading quickly.

The uk similar rates right ct, slightly fewer second shots, less effective vaccines. weeks it'll significantly ahead ct, wayyy ahead USA.

I think new England fair better uk now, there's reckoning coming unvaccinated populations elsewhere. nothing similar, so, blink remain little evolutionary opportunity rest us endure. agree everything except take months develop. idk know mrna pfizer vaccine made *hours* finished gene sequencing like saying people wearing seatlbelts die car crash...  think posts SARS1 MERS, also coronaviruses. Pain heart LEFT arm bad news... sign impending heart attack?? Xenophobic? Reddit really something lmao Time mandate it, think. time fun games passed. part society forced to.   Truth faulty logic? try less concerned randos think medical history Sickest patient I’ve far vaccinated HFNC FiO2 80-90%. 80 years old, completed vaccination appx four months prior catching Covid. came high flow, also ended suffering bowel perforation.  True. extra point blood donation test antibodies created vaccine. may antibodies virus vaccinated (mRNA) person may still test negative.

For example, Pfizer vaccine two antibodies home self-test (I participating health study administer home self test monthly), IgG IgM — show antibodies one them. Apparently, credible data publicly available, yet, effectiveness Moderna vaccine Delta variant, many credible sources reported effectiveness Pfizer AstraZeneca Delta, including UK government: 
     
""• Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 96% effective hospitalisation 2 doses"" 
""• Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine 92% effective hospitalisation 2 doses"" 
      Well honestly no. 
Why? would know flu. know I’m sick, take necessary precautions keep others getting sick. (Staying home, staying away people) 
COVID hand don’t know you’re sick sometimes. asymptomatic, mistake cold, always precautious (for now) 
Not even trying protect taking necessary precautions (6 feet, wearing mask, getting vaccinated) would feel horrible found anyone recently near died.

So I’m trying best cautious still pass anything would still feel like shit, know nobody perfect 
If I’m living carefree boom someone drops mistakes I’ll feel terrible good ill, U.S. least, ship sailed. Well, that's pretty xenophobic, I'll shoot Omega (the end). I'm sure saving really terrible variant last letter Greek Alphabet. repost. Yes, something else I'll continue future.

And note, oddly suspicious many people wash hands...I'll leave thought lol. losing smell pretty serious. come back? 40% fully vaccinated would put China closer top vaccinated countries, lol.

TEL AVIV—About half adults infected outbreak Delta variant Covid-19 Israel fully inoculated Pfizer Inc. vaccine, prompting government reimpose indoor mask requirement measures contain highly transmissible strain.

Preliminary findings Israeli health officials suggest 90% new infections likely caused Delta variant, according Ran Balicer, leads expert advisory panel Covid-19 government. Children 16, haven’t vaccinated, accounted half infected, said.

The number cases Israel relatively low global standards. new cases Covid-19 rose 200 Thursday around 10 day June.
Israel reassessing Covid-19 regulations moving open society economy following multiple lockdowns last year.

“The entrance Delta variant changed transmission dynamics,” said Prof. Balicer, also chief innovation officer Israel’s largest health-management organization, Clalit.
The Delta variant, which first emerged India late 2020 and also known B.1.617.2, detected 70 countries. 

These so-called breakthrough cases—defined positive Covid-19 test results received least two weeks patients receive final vaccine dose—are broadly expected Pfizer vaccine highly effective 100% foolproof, according Mr. Balicer.

Israeli health officials optimistic even variant spread, evidence countries U.K. indicate vaccine prevent large increase severe illness hospitalizations plagued country’s health system previous outbreaks. Israel recorded five severe cases past 10 days, Prof. Balicer said, whether emerge early tell.

Those exempt mask requirement included children seven, people disabilities prevent wearing mask two workers work regularly together. government canceled indoor mask requirement 10 days ago dropped preventive measures running one world’s fastest vaccination campaigns. 80% Israelis age 16 received two doses vaccine developed Pfizer German partner BioNTech SE.

Israel early test case effectiveness of vaccine outbreaks last year one point gave one world’s highest per-capita infection rates. Since start pandemic, 840,522 country’s 9.3 millions citizens infected, 6,429 died.

Israeli health officials said highly contagious strain likely entered country main international airport, near Tel Aviv, system meant vet every new arrival testing overloaded recent days amid surge foreign travel.

On Wednesday, government delayed allowing foreign nationals enter country tourism July 1 Aug. 1 reimposed mask requirement inside airports.

“Our goal moment, first foremost, safeguard citizens Israel Delta variant running amok world,” Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Wednesday. I’m KF94-er way, mostly find easier talk cloth masks. 

That said, I’m thinking face face - phone whole different story could see structured mask messing mic. 

I’m getting second couple days don’t know I’ll land area reaches herd immunity. 

I’m mask outside unless it’s super crowded/on anywhere indoors (it’s still mandated city anyways)...but antibodies infection rates near stay low? I’ll prob always little mask pouch purse, pop public transit crowded spaces. miss lipstick “not catching colds viruses” thing. recently said fully vaccinated people can’t get sick. don’t know ass elbow I’m believing damn thing. I’m vaccinated won't. Think many preventable diseases covered. people crying storm acting like one understands hard you. hard us. adult.

Straight up. Foaming mouths even *suggestion* continued mask use. shopping couple stores today denier-heavy area. Maybe 5% mask use. Almost kids masked despite current variant dangerous kids fact still understand long-term covid damage. ""But kids die!"" Yeah, could survive getting hit car too. might also end unable walk rest life. almost death consequence.

It's pathetic. They're willfully ignoring basics *any* virus works. Idk hell hard connect dots (making numbers sake argument):

* Vaccine made, 95% effective
* Time passes, virus viruses do, mutates
* vaccine 90% effective new variants
* Time passes, virus mutates &lt;---- stumble

After undetermined amount time we'd strain vaccine 85% effective against.. rinse repeat vaccine near useless hopefully develop new vaccine.

It take half brain cell see current vaccines remain effective future strains. can't make simple tweak vaccines get everyone's arms instantly. Shit takes time. 

Try point get bunch jackasses saying, ""Oh studies say vaccine still pretty effective current variants!"" Keyword gloss over: CURRENT. vaccines effective might good idea continue reduce transmission better vaccines made current ones remain effective virus gets chance mutate.

It's piece fucking cloth. God damn wish energy get pissy something petty. ""Oh I've sacrificed year, woe me"" fucking have. Suck up.

You *really* can't imagine someone shopping *cold flu medication* might likely *cold flu* someone shopping for, say, gardening supplies? citizens mostly remain unvaccinated

For example Moscow, never problems vaccine availability, lot people vaccinated. Mostly, because:

\- one cares

\- lot people trust ""untested"" vaccines. Sadly, parents among them, though anti-vaxers vaccines diseases.

\- lazy

Now measures (making vaccination mandatory jobs, requirement vaccinated live dormitory, requirement negative PCR vaccinated sit bar/restaurant) introduced encourage vaccination.

Besides, Delta variant. personally know several people fell ill vaccinated. One COVID earlier, recovered, vaccinated fell ill again, severe lungs damage. Welp year dodging covid delta variant finally got me! feel fine however feeling guilty going gym, shops, work week since thought stomach bug/mild food poisoning first 3 lateral flow tests negative. Florida oddball due many tourists too. TVA really needs get Variants control Also, normal, non-Covid times, Northern Hemisphere summer Southern Hemisphere winter flu season. still really rare. Great, sounds good, returning normal. Colds normal. Bring colds.  research either finishing molecular biology major, sign PhD spend years working field.

I get car analyze likely think get car accident day putting seat belt. put every time fucking stupid to.

Cant really live locked forever vaccinated possible way increase immunity past need go back regular, though still take precautions swear journalists write stuff getting worthless every week. could done Johns Hopkins study US. Lupus get free antibody tests. Sounds realistic… That's perfectly valid, different question. 

Not everyone double vaccinated chance yet, ""I've got mine, screw everyone else"", otherwise line drawn ahead you, one risk?

Israel interesting choice - they've reversed position masks due Delta. think they're finding insignificant.

Lamentably, Americans largely uninformed misinformed due extensive propaganda campaigns, even news outlets nearly exclusively propaganda. result, many people misconstrue inoculation immunity, thinking cannot get transmit virus. Worse still, many others outright care health others, willfully put others danger disregarding safeguards precautions. long time country rid virus, likely lag far behind others. got vaccinated still take reasonable practical precautions sake others around me; hope enough others similarly care enough same. think meant they'd still wear mask time work, want risk away work two weeks. someone say effective vaccine? think states care much majority people mentally decided covid over. Work back normal, states opened restaurants full capacity.  state started push vaccine verification first question would get why. People sub write Will

""Please bury mask want catch virus""  Yes is. 54% increase 18,000 28,000.

And ""link"" broken - fact, average deaths increased around 50% last 7 days well. current 16 deaths daily may seem like much, thing exponential growth numbers get large real fast, even small base. long Covid?

I believe concrete data yet (and I'm curious know well), think probably safe assume similar hospitalizations deaths - risk dramatically reduced, completely eliminated. UK large used AZ vaccines probably less effective Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J. J&amp;J one dose handed NYC subways times it’s counted one dose it’s really considered complete. Also NY number believe including 18 group. mention like 1400 cases 300M shots pharmacy likely grocery store though?

Us fellow 3rd world BRICS country failures stand together proudly.  Girlfriend got sick cold recently, came home work wearing mask confused. didn’t want get sick, appreciate.  Well peak reached certainly come there. matter much. be. do, mid-40s UGHHHH. People like never get mess.

The vaccines working wonderfully. 

Every single delta case Israel that's fully vaxxed showed symptoms. Something like 40% new cases fully vaxxed people.

Vaccines prevent serious disease, stop ever catching it.

Stop hysteria.

Covid us forever. always new variants like flu.

Even Singapore accepted live covid can't covid 0
 must accept risk society again... Life without risk living, mere existence. Seems vast majority. Fingers crossed. first tasteless coffee. Blech. already know vast majority cases among unvaccinated; need state that.

But headline still false. Cases doubled, percentage cases delta doubled 4-week period. Since total cases dropped substantially timeframe, clear delta cases risen all. also said young healthy people get vaccinated. Well, guess ones spreading covid breeding new variants now. someone small children....yes...yes is....and sucks.... Somebody told get vaccinated research. 
In mind like ... research that’s got vaccinated. 
Anti Vaxxers boy tell ya lot children actually summer school right now. person. many school districts made masks optional kids staff. teach summer school. I’d say less 5% students wearing masks.  one cares, won’t cause mass deaths among vaxxed. No, isn't. even close lockdown - link cases strain NHS broken. Preach. helping paranoia Pfizer shot take... issue hbv vaxx.

It makes frustrated medical professionals explain everybody, legally required study/disclose. pandemic, think ton people clued kinds subtleties widely ignored now. 

To explicit, every single vaccine, finish ""normal prescribed vaccine regiment"", certain percentage people yet protected. cases, another shot identical vaccine later date would improve chances protected amount. smaller set cases, test see immune.

Here example pet peeve mine action: regular yearly flu vaccine 40% - 60% effective 60% guess ""strains"" correctly year. goes low 13% effective guess strains incorrectly like occurred 2014-2015 flu season multiple strains H3N2 made people sick. question yet find answer: got yearly flu vaccination, waited 6 weeks, got vaccination AGAIN, would it: A) cause side effects want, B) nothing, C) decrease chances getting flu year? cannot find answer anywhere. I've asked several doctors, know. can't find anything online it.

Here little information: different flu vaccine formulation people 65 years old. google ""Fluzone High Dose"", difference contains four times (!!!!) amount antigen (the inactivated virus promotes immune response). people older 65, results getting flu ASTOUNDING 24% less time! stay here: one get say 63 years old life tended weaker responses things like hepatitis B vaccine? honestly idea. 

I kind excited new mRNA technology applied flu vaccination. article floating bold claims may may come true like mRNA flu vaccine last multiple years much effective current flu vaccine. Time tell, lot stuff gets thrown there, 10 years later come market. parents got COVID last week fully vaccinated. Fortunately symptoms mild. Someone Facebook group I’m service industry selling fake covid test results. Who/where report to? I’m GA matters. bottle DayQuil verify. do. meant say don’t easy access them. Glad someone said it. surprising entire year people dying unrelated causes reported Covid deaths, simply tested positive. 

News media sucks ass Virus gonna virus. politics around frayed kind collective action real effect, regardless successful containing country, we're never going true ""normalcy"" contained everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever going prevent another surge. We've granted break time want enjoy it. Please this. Unless medically trained make informed decision reading study this, any, take risk, matter small perceive be. end though? always new variants, covid disappear. majority vaccinated, back normal. 

Just hold weeks. Sorry. That's going cut anymore everyone wants vaccine offered one. 

Of new delta cases Israel, 40% fully vaccinated, none showed symptoms.

The goal vaccines stop serious disease, stop ever catching it.

At point start accepting risk life also accept covid stay forever, like H1N1 still today flu Spanish Singapore starting realise covid stay. I've got disagree, things may looking good look overall number cases.

But looking Delta cases Ontario, staying roughly constant (R equal 1). loosening restrictions R exceed 1 Canada start following UK trajectory. Canada definitely woods yet. comes incentive. community transmission basically zero, there's compelling ""what's me?"" case persuade people consciously choose take something may kill them.

If virus running rampant, would change ""what's me?"" case. long cases remain low, lot people want it. people posted results anti body tests infection zero, everyone different.


Also, read vaccines? said they’re way effective virus.

Israel major outbreaks… go figure. said no. got first shot, 3-ish weeks later, got another first shot. I’m guessing I’m one. Yes thankfully issue resolved peacefully. States actually listening residents' concerns.

It hard believe would happen anyways, something scale would take year many already anticipating return mostly normal summer. point government say “ok point vaccinated problem, moving on.”

Sure, COVID illness causes measurable costs public institutions like state hospitals economic production. wrapped four years Donald blabbing stock market every day, clearly federal government business ensuring continued economic growth - minimizing impact dangerous virus getting vaccines arms interest.  pretty much every state allow simple opt MMR ""religious reasons""? Nah. Life shit. worth living Blatant misinformation. delta outbreaks India, UK, Canada - surprisingly seems flying radar US. wide open United States, gotten lucky far delta? doesn't. one older millennials hoped prayed would loose lot bigotry stupidity older people died. didn't, stuff generational. Sure, acceptance shifts time goes on, plenty younger people believe hate.  Charlottesville march local campus.  older people. collage students, 2017. kids compared me. shit fade away, taught, learned behavior. can't sit back expect go away, option atleast vote. active shitbirds. let once, got pile young tiki torch (Not-Sees) marching pride screaming killing Jewish people anti facists. ALWAYS vigilant fight friend, hate stupidity knows boundary.

Sorry fix get auto banned. Blatant misinformation. does.

What people seem fail understand infections it’s probability game: Even both, person next wear mask, person next spreading virus, could end infected - it’s unlikely. Adding little distance significantly reduces probability. One person removing mask increases probability, removing mask increases lot more. healthy immune system decreases probability.

If person spreading spreads low dose (i.e. contagious phase almost over), immune system may prevent infection within even noticing (or becoming contagious yourself).

The thing probabilities multiply extremely low probability 7 billion people, could still thousands dieing.

That’s why, pandemic situation, things would considered paranoid non-pandemic situations. simply don’t want responsible someone else’s death (or suffering e.g. long Covid) ended bad side low probability. They're built every house here. Also they're bidet shower heads use, bidets smol seat looking thing

Wiping ass plain paper messy imo got pair scissors. Getting pretty good now.  may sound dumb 2 digits amount new covid cases gor whole country seems exaggerated new lockdowns put place. Oh please don’t protest quit, ever find group overweight pyjama pants wearing idiots?! /s I’d interested hear disagree one bothered explain 🤷‍♂️

I’m one redditors insult disagreeing  school classroom classroom. even think choice.

We day spent drawing reading everyone took turns getting injected.
Don't know now. Everyone felt safe, got lollypop whole school year protected once.  Well two consenting adults word antivaxxer, can't imagine issues. You’re good mom what’s best Keep working it! get there! Maybe also include tapping therapy use PTSD? ""If survive!""

You asked answered question

Dear Lord save us antivax rhetoricals   That's employers doing. (Yay boss!) employer, everything could make sure employees (and customers) protected could be?! lol...we’re debt high degree education ya fuckin puff.

We’re annoyed, because, are, about, way many, commas fucking original, comment.  really think that's correct.

The 95% efficacy rate indeed mean vaccinated people trials 95% less likely contract virus, meaning cases estimated 95% lower among vaccinated group compared control group.  Woah didn’t know couldn’t donate blood asthma. asthma too. Confirmation bias much? used heroin, vaccines. times changed goes Reddit narrative 'old people bad, kay boomer', prepared downvoted. needed back horses done whatever took secure mass early supply vaccines (ended Pfizer Moderna importantly) addition going hard AZ.

Going pandemic Australia capability manufacture single non-mRNA vaccine time CSL Melbourne. Even debatable change Novavax given lengthy process change production. really weird see life time 'being hippy' purely far left thing, far right thing.

Time sonovabitch. feel like make law vaccinated 2022 pay double tax/get pension contribution get passport taken can't travel.

Pretty simple, medical exemptions would exempt.

And covid, injections.

Can't claim benefits, child support etc etc unless got date medical record.

There's reason ever decline jab that's passed tests. Flu, measles, covid. want protected everything. read somewhere highest immunity recovery dips 8 months roughly vaccine slightly higher. I'm trying Google theres hundreds pages discussing vaccine recovery comparing two, find post link  That's I'm going stop wearing mask even pandemic completely over. Getting sick virus sucks. ""Long lasting effects"" like dying COVID? Like living full, productive life? say flu shots? Sure, I'm arguing vaccination, rational point hesitancy people. think parent young male age group might wait little bit see happens data collected.

I treated pericarditis serious heart issues past year however first dose Pfizer await second week two.

In Australia different conversation, risk getting Covid much lower; potential negative impacts vaccine relatively much likely definitely impacted take-up rate (amongst issues).  pro-Trump - assumed anti-vax - cohort young boomers gen x.

You'd person people would downvoted asked questions AZ blood clots earlier year... shit. 100% effective vaccines don’t exist. feel like certain news outlets passing old science sensationalism. used believe thing young, that'd it'd go away. Life proven so, wrong though.  good news extremely widespread vaccination already happened bad news unvaccinated hospitalized. Irresponsible ""seeding"" social media deliberate fear-provoking headlines stop vaccines. BMJ article says: get shot. benefits outweigh risks. you’re 3 minutes haven’t enough. Well right course, think comparing apples apples.

That 7.3% total cases, subset young men, typically see far lower symptoms Covid. may still worth considering vaccines.  Yeah, looking back things, trust 15 year old make better medical decisions mother age, (for reference, I'm 36 STEM-y, back (though obviously less) mother is... not).

Plenty teens better able make better medical decisions parents Netherlands even vaccinate boys rubella (at least use to), girls girls ever risk complications (actually fetuses) boys risk outweighs benefits...  want circumvent paywall, see: Or, website regularly read, think subscribing website.  It’s essentially like nerves repairing themselves- don’t freak suddenly shit gets weird think you’re clear. Make sure you’re done virus eat super clean exercise ton. Also couldn’t bring eat couldn’t taste- hit point make super healthy protein shakes. making protein shakes almond milk, spinach, kale, carrots, banana, protein powder. drink get good nutrients way  Hey France, Wanna buy meth? made lol. People don’t think COVID19 real? That’s true vast vast majority. 

I think answer reason communicable disease causes lot hysteria, public health authorities tuned this. terrorism, causes relatively deaths, yet countries spend enormous amounts fight it. opioid epidemic killed half million Americans, response mild lawsuits companies know full well products hit black market. Nosocomial infections kill 100k Americans every year, despite preventable. Non-communicable disease kills far away anything else, there’s effort tax sugar remove escalators promote exercise, etc. Yet COVID19 we’re willing drastically limit freedoms, shut businesses, obligate mask wearing, spend money WWII (in constant dollars). contrast pretty striking disease mostly hits people near end lives. eg opioid epidemic + obesity much bigger impact American life expectancy COVID19, makes US developed country world see life expectancy flattened even dropping starting around 2014. that, collectively shrug. get fact? Facebook meme? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ""the benefits vaccination still clearly outweighed risks.1""   could written small details. Also decided cold began treatment that. Could smell stuff definitely lost good day two. point began googling whether could even get covid new variant fully vaccinated February. Everything seemed tell no, must cold.

Cool. didn’t get tested. I’m beginning feel better cough lingers. made entire pandemic without covid test. reason point since feel 90% better? also worth noting many localities made illegal cover face. obviously counter robbers such, still law. covering face deeply ingrained society, says something hide. would make sense common stores sell masks, covering face? UK

The UK tons tons unvaccinated people due structured vaccination program, stratified age. Yeah, see mostly Gen X millennials refusing (though still minority both). Admittedly, know ton older people besides family, ones got vaccinated. pretty sure vaccination statistics less back too. don’t think California allows religious personal exemptions vaccines…or apply minors?  Well, COVID cause myocarditis. exact frequency unknown, even current studies wrong order magnitude two (Hubei reported 7.3% COVID patients suffered myocarditis) vaccine still considerably less client hospital months came legs amputated due tp complications. It’s worth risk.  People 20 35. North America least. vaccinated people getting sick 

Vaccinated people turning asymptomatic colds worst, breakthrough infections types COVID. concern always unvaccinated. That'd mean admitting lied serious virus explain said immune caught it, he'd never :/ dug deep cares way image saving people's lives Aw, never know. factory careful materials anyway. 

I wish knew fanning tip kid searching house source foul smell zeroed brother's sneaker.  think statistics available far specifically measure incidence long covid vaccinated people. hand, know longlasting effects covid kids infected affected they're older.

It’s precise enough state percentage population vaccinated. need also contextualize type vaccine. Chile used mostly Sinovac, doesn’t work well mRNA overall especially Delta. UK’s reliance AZ also issue. Yes, AZ prevents hospitalization death Delta, less apt preventing transmission mRNA shots. Hence cases UK.

For countries either two mRNA one AZ followed mRNA (Canada), far less transmission Delta examples cited. 

The vaccines work. curb spread prevent deaths/hospitalizations, though, mRNA leads pack.

This might (hopefully) changing, study done 2019 found bodies highly cross-reactive influenza strains, current (as 2019) vaccines target correct immune response, end play whack-a-mole influenza strains.

Teenagers seeing extreme higher incidence myocarditis post vaccine extent fully understand many teens hesitant. I’m really sorry hear this. hope guys eventually sort out.

I’m super glad got vaccinated.

In reply situation: boomers country pretty highly vaccinated comparison younger people (greater 70% least one shot large numbers getting second shots day). older someone is, likely vaccinated. Yah, except parents reasoned position wanting children vaccinated COVID teenagers still minors. Completely inexcusable setting methods teenagers circumvent parents consent. ones risk vaccinated though. 

Children certainly catch it, think people protest Timmy 8 years old getting sniffles? admire optimism fear misplaced. *their* life, care comply. Without state enforcement, cannot required many state governments opposing reasonable health measures hope that. allowing large events like are. God save mild cold MIGHT get vaccinated... Lol, we'll get right 🙄 Many unvaccinated people countries vaccines still scarce. Even want can’t get jab. people immunocompromised sick need visit hospitals specialized checkups equipment. Lot people edge cannot get time get symptoms from
The vaccines. 

Show little heart man, doesn’t cost anything. good people edge can't imagine prospect masks lockdowns. totally understand reactions.

Unfortunately probably much choice. things come go cycles virus become endemic hopefully sooner later. Everyone tested heavily, problem someone newly exposed something may yet developed detectable amount antibodies. waiting period give time antibodies develop. basis vaccine available people use judgment want do. Many stores kept mask mandates April May anyway. similar dheese strain. reading wrong, rather reporting vague confusing. infections Israel among unvaccinated. vaccinated test positive largely asymptomatic. symptomatic mild symptoms. mRNA vaccines still work well. 100% like vaccine still hospitalizations deaths. least one person gets it! Thank would humbly suggest public policy imagines effects global pandemic remaining isolated individual regions part got us mess. sure getting much hate here. fair points. reddit, respectful people opinions different own. case live. said DIGITAL! heck would use paper day age anything secure. sure EU surprise DE issues, 200k fax machines still government usage Probably drive either. Cant dealing get licence government prove qualified drive Viruses mutate, that’s nature work

Surely cannot expect whole planet keep following lockdowns/mask mandates/forced testing distancing every little mutation happen rest peoples lives you? 

They might well say forget goalpost forever without mandatory vaccinations, propose do?

Il answer you; nothing. return normality, unvaccinated unfortunately become ill.  future going masked. Working remotely become norm. Mass gatherings annual foreign holidays longer things.

&amp;#x200B;

People throw fits moan, keep safe stay alive. worse things way anyway, check climate... You’re right vaccine effective wrong everyone going safe. small percentage vaccinated people still going get covid. Also lot people still aren’t vaccinated.

Everyone allowed access objective facts behave see fit themselves. don’t plan putting mask back don’t doesn’t mean everyone else feel way. people pre-existing conditions might choose keep mask little longer. added /s. stopped never stop wearing mask.

👍 thing endemic  Oh use alright…. Probably won’t work imagine. 
If ever OSHA chance shine show need being, time! 
How faded shadows? 
Or, perhaps heard / seen doing. make sense relation public health pandemic? reflection vaccine rates? prescriptions exactly pharmacies filling infectious diseases? going pharmacy knowing COVID vs. going anywhere else? COVID primarily spread pharmacies *obviously*. spread people hanging people, period. scared pharmacies, scared interpersonal interactions. not. debate single vaccine not, definition, “anti-vax” movement. Nobody debating vaccines flu, mmr, rabies, tdap proven vaccines. People allowed uneasy new technology without grouped far outliers. It’s frustrating part today’s culture sort nuance differing opinion automatically accused idiocy OP added /s. stopped never stop wearing mask. saw countless stories vaccine passport falsifications Germany. literally piece paper hard fake. sorry! bad situation. turn hospitalizations deaths go up. protests like people fall line save lives. Especially considering 150 million people US alone unvaccinated, including children 12 under. Unfortunately sorta does. cannot convince population take mask mandate seriously, enforcement compliance low. ""Why making speed limits apply me? I'm good driver, I'm low risk causing crash!"" referring random scientists CDC? dictating public policy messaging exactly job. information comment, read entertainingly written book “The Premonition” Michael Lewis really research far viral particles spread restaurant. assure you’re protecting anyone wearing mask 10 second walk restroom leaving eat meal; germs constantly spreading throughout entire restaurant eat anyway. People conveniently forgetting mention majority (I actually think smaller sample size, all) vaxxed patients completely asymptomatic.

Someone feel free correct I'm wrong public wants dictate effectiveness mask mandates interventions contain variant. Health Experts useless public turns them. Yeah right 

At slightest mutation gladly ringing alarms 

Fact still telling fully vaccinated people mask distance proof despite virus extremely rarely effecting people jokes supposed funny? nothing fully vaccinated Canadian here. Apparently yep.  pharmacies places medications distributed sick people thus makes sense people given time could likely infectious illness. serious question? Like understand certain places much, much likely higher concentrations ill people they’re literally designed ill people? number TINY put context.

Exactly. People know use brains. know doctor got Covid Sept. took vaccine Feb still got infected May. know common catch covid even getting vaccine natural antibodies due infection know thatfamily personally sad state children intelligence parents. live middle long state well, see happens. everyone  agree, though [the Novavax protein subunit vaccine may strong gets approved. issues guidelines world, CDC US. necessarily contradictory say exact things.

Also, viruses ""ever mutating."" really mean anything automatically dangerous. matters specific ways mutate. even think choice.

Unfortunately, [plenty allow exceptions religious reasons personal beliefs. symbol Ł anti-vaxxed Facebook badges say “I’m part control group, that’s right!!!!” proud. mean whatevs, control group literally suckin wind. going stay perpetual lockdown due ""might"" happen. Jesus. Ladies gentlemen 

We got em

(Nice see people still sense humor here) hmmm understand sentiment wants government tells do, cases would agree, vaccines, nope! Get damn shot Plague Enthusiast! Masks meant protect others you, others.
When that's said, agree home made masks mostly shit compared surgical masks. vaccines 88% effective Delta. good effective vaccines get us back normal? broken body gone within week. Stop overdramatizing getting vaccine care neighbors lol I'd rather Google.  Vaccines precautions. Masks like putting finger leaky dam, worked paired social distancing. 

Vaccines like actually repairing crack cement. suggesting take additional precautions placing fingers cement ""just case"" fails, what's harm right? 

I'll pass, thanks. ""Freedom, patriot, assault weapon firing automatic gunfire sky, eagle screaming mask suggestion"" Anti-Communist Duty would work folks would better position stupid :( Vaccines powerful perfect. provide almost (but quite) perfect protection hospitalization/death, strong protection getting sick all, transmitting virus. know vaccinated people much less likely spread countries conservative new evidence accept. Young people getting strokes vaccine remotely significant amount. fact can't even find reports them... myocarditis rare rarely serious. 

They far far likely getting strokes Covid (which still super rare talking tail end tail end here), stated professor study rare occasion serious vaccine complications: ""it important remember side-effects rare, much less common cerebral venous thrombosis ischaemic stroke associated covid-19 infection itself"" Alternatively, family state almost nothing, state live one strict. like believe kept freedoms like sort caged animal. don’t heart point continued bust ass working shit wages, got enjoy working home, making liveable wage, working myself, finding new skills, getting delicious take-out isn’t Applebees, fact still choices things lockdown ever living “free” state. Also got covid. Luckily everyone fine-save lack taste probably even less common sense. Kinda deceptive - states low populations people live places. South Dakota, half population lives seven (out 66) counties (Minnehaha, Pennington, Lincoln, Brown, Brookings, Codington Meade). North Dakota, half population lives six (out 53) counties (Cass, Burleigh, Grand Forks, Ward, Morton Stark). making law fine, retail workers already scared enforce mask mandates covidiots also tend gun carrying jerks, people injured killed trying enforce them. 

then police get involved, may good results….or there’s law enforcement officials flat say refuse …. enforce. 

good times, usa. we’re already gonna lose people south / rural areas high resistance vaccines. new normal means sporting events, concerts, indoor dining, movies, theatres, museums, haircuts, gyms thanks! J J decently effective Beta studies show Delta less evasion Beta. Probably somewhere around 60-65% effective. going wear mask rest life protect people every contagious disease there? point risk low enough masks needed. US point. Yeah always wonder people like 1941 would saying ""that's tried invaded covering lights night avoid bombed going live it""

I'm saying covid bad idea either things go back normal couple months give sad. Maybe countries opted Made China vaccines stupid people obey another lockdown. Lot people vaccinated lot people care all, including me. as? Username checks Frame way left right jump it. That's science works. possible family truly unreasonable, also worth weighing fact humans hilariously terrible intuiting meaning statistical findings. Often ignorance manifest fear know enough know understand full consequences actions feel equipped answer questions realization brings. UK one prohibited vaccines health grounds UK health regulator says theres chance vaccine harmful kids health virus unethical vaccinate boost herd immunity.

I'm sorry double vaxxed, people choose get vaccinated kids never get vaccinated can't wait forever. countries letting US citizens (even lower cases US) US letting people in? really seem fair. got vaccinated didn’t cautious. two doses fine, particularly vaccination rates around high, need caution all. Mostly enough data yet kinda like know long last. likely yes time see enough evidence people do. cautious said vaccinated good vaccines wont anything past mild. lived Russia would hesitant take anything government put too. fear mongering live life.

And that's we'll struggling COVID much longer needed to... Surgical masks prevent spread. 

N95 protect user.

Unless mask getting seal around face, protecting you.  So, viruses mutate...there another another another variant forever. family followed rules eventually move on. vaccinated continue wear masks public, that's on. Micromanaging public going work point. Folks mentally exhausted. COVID’s peak death wave November February/March. Confused get “no abundance death”, unless you’re intentionally ignoring facts. share optimism. lot folks contrarians. flat earther flight attendants. US running low medium numbers while. weekly new infection numbers FL edged little. states like Missouri definitely hit bottom turned up. think rates get high before, enough people never got sick vaccinated zero resistance keep going quite time. Nearly (99%) people sick dying unvaccinated, far. nice see OSHA get involved lol. 

The problem, we’re going see, there’s going tough fight governments mandating drug EUA Exactly. making shits giggles. They're looking data analyzing it. I'm fairly certain people work appreciate findings either. Looking reactions news makes wonder people would handle bad medical diagnosis. Denial help solve problem. hope people would deal problem head-on whatever survive. Yes, it’s fear mongering article, frankly. keep cowering fear. fact don’t want go back normal even vaccines crazy me. 26 people hospitalized covid Israel. That's negligible amount. God! report Government tracking us using Facial Recognition way trick wear mask. California OSHA going still stricter workplace requirements got shouted match federal rules CA reopened 15th.

Federal OSHA delayed delayed releasing workplace mask rules became moot. hope consider therapy older. comment parents still there. much damage.  ""issue"". makes America great. Maybe problem along focus hand washing good ventilation? Narcissistic parenting damages kids. largely agree global sentiment, since crux conversation individually behave given reality context country becomes highly relevant make informed decisions. 

The US plenty vaccines adult one point chosen to. risk calculus different place like Tanzania access vaccine barrier safe behaviour. don’t even try you’re saying.

Was really difficult wear mask? I'm anti mask even little bit. I've complied every health directive since beginning pandemic best ability. I'm opposed continuing wear mask vaccination drive continues. end sight, combination vaccination harm reduction policy.

There's less 100 active hospitalizations entire province 8+ million. active cases since March 2020. can't keep wearing masks social distancing years. certainly can't. Would health insurance even cover someone deliberately refused free vaccine face global pandemic? kids 12 congenital heart conditions, pulmonary disease immunocompromised things like cancer.  People refusing otherwise think attack rights. rights? know. right infect others potentially deadly virus? know.  Looking rates vaccination 12-15 year olds US least, wouldnt expect major effect vaccines available kids. I'd guess well half get vaccinated. Everyone seems worried Delta Plus. next significant mutation high vaccine environment... Yup. think people followed advice correctly realize many people (in United States) not. slightest. hard work people preventing spread un-done real time almost equal size population insisted carrying lives ""normal"" possible. Australia right it’s called “lockdown” people handled kid gloves reason.  can’t really compare putting seatbelt injecting something stay body can’t take back. Let alone one made year, long term testing, idea long it’s affective for, warnings fda heart problems. matter? Pfizer Moderna meeting demand highly effective vaccines. still decent amount countries reliant Sinovac, Sputnik, j&amp;j, AZ. really holding towards 90% effective scalable manufacture distribution become key tool fully ending pandemic. Patriotic Duty. Get Jim Carrey promote mask. worked almost 30 years ago. changed, though?

That goal avoid overwhelmed hospitals. One dose common vaccines provides 90%+ protection hospitalized delta variant, anyone wanted significant risk able get shot months. Tbf, people really protecting

My nephews young vaccine, I'd them. friend mine bazillion health issues, even vaccine 100% protect serious symptoms covid. I'd protect others like her

But really fucking want lmao, hope become necessary Wanting life back sixteen months isn’t selfish. know people (legitimate, diagnosed) anxiety experience panic attacks, especially people victims violence lives. 

And know people refuse believe it, depending mask employer enforcement body requires wear actually difficult people breathe. part purely anecdotal, leave office early day got point legitimately couldn’t breathe mask (work theatre, wear KN95s). don’t know mask combination something else, whenever wear masks longer say three hours nose clogs throat begins dry. believe not, I’ve become far sympathetic people claim masks make difficult breathe, particularly elderly vulnerable groups.

Edit people say it: yeah ventilator 1000x worse, odds ventilator fully vaccinated significantly slim. think vaccine good Western ones. soooo feel way. It’s exhausting make case thick family members get vaccinated. point, die, die. Obviously places still serious outbreaks high death count. But, we're talking locally, death toll covid many places HIGHLY reduced. 

My county 28 people die covid last month. course, that's tragic, 550,000 people, would hardly call it, ""huge"". 

I'm going wear life jacket Michigan tsunamis Peru. want convince Republicans, call Patriotic Duty something like that. “Coworker looks funny makes uncomfortable” - lawsuit, hostile workplace, Fire Employee !

“Coworker refuses get vaccinated, coughs others thinks it’s funny pandemic” - deal it, snitching trying cause problem, go find new job then. 🤬 conclusively found vaccines stop contracting covid? thought research pointed opposite. likely contract covid, would mild disease. WHO: Keep wearing masks. ride yet. 

The Public: pandemic going end Jan 2021, right? 

WHO: *stares pensively*

The Public: RIGHT!? hope brings much needed light issues people suffer chronic illnesses face. chronic pain disorder still put happy face work 40 hours week. Many people apply disability denied spend years appealing it. It’s awful process people don’t know unfortunately live themself. it’s opposite updog hockey reference? *cries maple leafs fanbase tone* get vaccine protect me, got protect already. pretending like options get vaccinated get COVID lead confusion. somebody really worked system mind it, weighing ""keep I'm doing"" vs ""get vaccine."" 

The parent comment talking people antivax, hesitant. Pretending like really irrational stupid help understand them, they've got different risk calculus. wish TouchID. Hate Face ID. authoritarians love authoritarianism. WONT SOMEBODY THINK CHILDREN “assumption” incident likely took place (=the emperor decided voice opinion roundabout way) voices concern public health fallen deaf ears government bulldozes way Tokyo 2020, repeating mantra it’s going “safe secure” event. [A quote news Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga insisted Olympics Paralympics held safely, regardless infection situation country without specifying achieve goal. lack explanation Olympics take place drawn public criticism.”

It suspected PM Suga believe Olympics give better chance keeping job. believes public opinion negative holding games year, don’t understand personally. that’s experts think. example, [Foreign Policy article titled “Suga’s Olympics-Sized voice casting doubt whether games really go ahead, bad Suga like-minded. voice comes respected figure like Emperor, NEVER speaks government’s policies (such Covid response), it’s problem them. “I hope unlucky*

*This junk article valid research*

Not large enough sample size, *not even close*, objective parameters, data peer reviewed even *close* substantial enough peer review. Useless, anecdotal evidence.*Not* research.

And yes, absolutely correct. Actual, valid research support anecdotal findings. I’m denying happened, friend mine contracted B.1.1.7. minute exposure; it’s research, like friends situation cannot conclude *anything* it. Vaccines stop contacting covid. Also mRna vaccines work, never variant fully get through. point vaccine stop hospitalization death. also drastically lower viral load spread much two vaccinated individuals. Spread extremely rare.  ""exposure site"" mean least 1 confirmed transmission place, mean ""someone likely infectious""?

They try keep risk minimum local mass vaccination site, windows always open chairs kept distance, everyone needs wear FFP2 mask (similar N95 mask). also check temperature go in. I'd hope even someone infectious getting shot there, transmit disease others. tinnitus got worse first moderna shot got worse second one I'd kill myself, decided get it. lots people tinnitus position me. I'm sure tons people outside Tinnitus community bad reactions well, significantly worse sore arm, want experience reactions again. Yet mean 5% protection all. That's really annoys anti vaxxers believe 5% end protection all. hospitals bad thing. want hospital workers thinking they're fine passing covid patients.

I doubt it, vaccination sites report supply outpaces local demand. make difficult keep current rate vaccination. We've worn mask official necessity grocery stores even end point continue least flu season. cold longest time life. Masks awesome!

Also fully vaccinated cautious before, feeling little saver though. mean born 1945 1965... country move to, dont mind sharing. countries mind? No. highschool students gen x parents.... dont wanna get vaccine , pay damn hospital bills also swab test take on. 

A friend mine proud all
the free rapid test take weekly job workplace require vaccine negative result rather believe shungite crystal protecting covid.  actually figure, Kudus center current delta variant surge, 5000 fully vaccinated health workers (mostly sinovac also AZ) say 350 got infected. 350/5000 around 7%. Good. immune system needs viruses bacteria. even bother Reddit. People biased downvoted oblivion. Sad really. 

I get Republican party made stupid move endorsing non mask wearing, plenty people middle left hesitant get vaccine. 

And fair, last year blame people losing faith honesty integrity scientific communities inability keep medicine scientific. impact side effects trusting government honest risks main issue I've heard people circles complain about, mixed freedom choice, believing risk vaccine outdated rewards. Lucky nobody know crazy enough outright deny covid exists thinks 5g mumbo jumbo. Quite ironic 'breakthrough' mild symptoms, vaccine still working good level It’s manageable thing far, bad thing. First everyone vaccinated, increases odds aggressive variants running free. importantly, many vaccinated people catching scale increases chances resistant mutations. would go step stop vaccinating teens younger put vaccines use covax. uh... Probably looking women, least exclusively. argument delay vaccination teens younger focus vulnerable around world?

What risk age group? know extremely low right?

Would better donating vaccines covax?  Good grief, please stop trying assign particular generation. Stupidity, ignorance obstinate ass transcends generations.

If want lay blame, put social media people sticking magnets sweaty sticky skin. It’s conservatives vaccine hesitant.  Yikes...here go again. Active cases. rate increase 55% per week.

Hospitalisations deaths also increasing. % cases resulting hospital death significantly reduced compared previous waves. Welp... LET'S TIME WARP AGAIN! cases Russia caused Delta variant CoviVac fact tested it, Sputnik tested earlier variants

Yeah, there's nothing done it. Besides, since Sputnik widely used data effectiveness new strain gathered rather quickly (although, think, rather complicated need sequence viral samples patients determine strain they're infected want see works particular strain). equivalent data coming phase 3 trials, still comparison made. side effect strictly age based vaccination bands even high percentage population vaccinated still creates environments basically immunity. People 20s still best partially vaccinated UK. Thank positive posts past months. They've inspiring!

I wonder, think Delta (and Delta+) variants become big problem Florida already fully vaccinated? Behind paywall That's even hippy. That's mainstream bullshit. Depends context. 60 corona pandemic, get anyway. 


If measles vaccine children, example, 2 deaths 2.5 million would mean vaccine would withdrawn. stat telling think is.

It's telling elderly vulnerable people's risk profile similar young healthy people. That's huge win means lockdowns needed. None guys even asked questions. started pointing fingers. There's whole laundry list, much crazier others tells us elderly vulnerable similar risk profile young people. great news, vaccines working.

To understand stat need see broken age compared previous waves. difference stark.  happened across [this helpful site helps teens identify relevant local laws regarding getting vaccinated I’m expert, vaccines side effects medical complications first year? 

I never heard lifetime new vaccines chicken pox HPV...and got vaccination option. cases double deaths double. always case matter many people vaccinate.

The question % cases result hospitalisation. long low enough stop health care overwhelmed lockdown.

Evidence far hospitalisations massively compared previous waves. Way perpetuate generational stereotypes. significant cause positive test result, still seem evade immune response enough cause severe disease. bad thing. crazy kids! Trying protect permanent lung scarring... Baby Boomers, born 1945 1955, higher vaccination rate born after.plus parents teenagers likely Gen X. comment senseless. Reddit, nobody secs goes reddit 3 months nothing.

In seriousness, believe there's burden proof that. gay guy say sex, he's good donate. Since advantage mRNA vaccine tech developed produced relatively quickly, wait ""upgrade"" vaccine actually accounts Delta class virii...and, then, act like vaccinated (use masks, social distance, etc.). Paying fake certificate instead inoculated free.

Strong galaxy brain vibes here. heart attack possible symptom (severe) heart inflammation. probably others commenting wore masks diligently year. purchased 3M N95 masks N99 masks use whenever entered hospital airport high risk place. point I’m vaccinated relatively young healthy. Im sick wearing masks numbers plummeted feel completely safe wearing it. may get bit sick I’m exposed that’s risk I’m willing take. never going 100% away I’m going wear mask forever. don’t think it’s selfish want go back relative normalcy taking necessary precautions throughout pandemic. Right, well case, know far back cases might started 1919, maybe months sooner, sure known, checked wiki officially says...26 months actually...not 18...(and another poster said 3 years...maybe included original/random cases widespread.)

Point is...original dates listed 26 months Feb 1918- 2 years later April 1920.  bulk probably ending months that. So...March 2020...to like May 2022 would put us spot. Also maybe back many people get sick major wave, many later wave, instead people isolating access masks, sanitzier could get things delivered home etc. may bigger chunk still uninvected...vs then...so ...its gonna take time people either get vaxxed get infected. why...between actual time putting us MAy 2022 take date range, and...we still lot people unvaxxed/no immunity social distancing...means....its likely gonna months surge fall/winter esp un-vaxxed communities. (And even vaxxed people getting mutates delta becomes dominant so....masking essential like...right actually, capacity rectrictions fall/winter, probably full lock-downs unless mutates even worse.) much hope again. main cause shitshow much people doesnt believe covid/ doesnt wanna follow health protocol. Many stupid people here. Though agree government needs disciplined rules enforce them. Im glad family vaccinated. wait till see Lambda Max Pro Ultra Plus do.  is. Yes based ""honor system"" lol Wild. small number cases ridiculous number contacts. Like hair salon cases 900 clients. Time get airport drivers vaccinated! kids serious allergy parents aware of, kid remember?

Can vaccination centres handle sort event?    Standford month last year stopped. may gotten expensive. would encourage ppl donate.  Moderna deliveries pathetic sign vaccine authorized, waiting decent vaccination rate younger age groups.  91% Sputnik V reported Russia themselves. They're exactly known truthful. Culture funny way. seen ONE life Denmark saying like it’s “gotcha”? vaccine ever going 100% effective everything.  Side effects *may* rough, they're also **temporary**.

Shit like exactly problem. People hear nonsense like think going damn near kill them, reality day two feeling off. studies show aren’t risk? I’ve seen studies talk adult reinfection chances nothing one way kids. sister wants go Lisbon, Portugal soon (from US) couple months. vaxxed 2x, 50's underlying health conditions appears situation Delta variant getting worse there. 

My mom freaking going, seems like cancel, what's opinion? risks? 

My understanding fully vaxxed relatively safe however medical system may overwhelmed COVID patients one medical need COVID may difficult get care. sure risks. hearing mostly CDC Fauci? getting frustrated poor performance CDC country. keep jumping gun downplaying things! FFS. common, say one unlucky ones vaccine lottery?

Pneumonia anosmia two big fears COVID, say, anosmia fear since seems impact far people know got COVID.

I got Pfizer March, would suck longer “safe.” Good point deadliness. IFR matter much contagiousness &amp; hospitalisation rates get extreme enough. Hopefully vaccines keep bay &amp; prevent overload. woman going scary time? There's nothing productive getting scared. 7 months ago, farts (and bunch things) smell like nasty burning rubber plastic. think actually gotten worse. long covid mild case didn’t energy anything 4 plus months. I’m also interested long covid reoccur fully vaccinated person. don’t want go thru shit ever again, yes I’m probably cautious. I’m county shitty 44% vaccination rate 65 yrs old. Im sure theres enough public political pandemic never over

Yes will. become endemic. get 3 whole paid ones employer, plus 75 dollars. Still almost everyone refused. :( seems likely. arrogant naïve thing say. actually think stupidity exclusive single generation whatever generation belongs somehow immune human condition. Don’t fucking dramatic, it’s hardly dangerous young people.  Meanwhile state hospitals reopening covid units. going long year midwest/south. Indeed. EU's 300 million-dose order AstraZeneca vaccine greatly help COVAX since still effective vaccine, par mRNA vaccines two doses. hope UK also able donate substantial amount late Summer. Maybe, also lot unvaccinated, so......

(1/3 population like 100 million people here...unvaxxed.....) imagine probably similar hospitalizations/deaths - risk dramatically reduced completely eliminated. huge majority boomers fully vaccinated. Even good, bad thing seems virus continue circulate even everyone vaccinated probably require us vaccinate ourselfs really long time gets lesser mutation. September deliveries admittedly late EU since first doses administered mid-July adults. However, useful use adolescents. mean yeah that's true absolutely people see vaccines, given several alternatives *no* deaths per million, health authority would ditch AZ favor urgent need get population, especially over-60s, vaccinated. didn’t see said can’t transmit fully vaccinated. agree. Generation Jones (end Baby Boom) almost died measles toddler. sugar cube saved classmates experience polio outbreaks remember seeing kids braces wheelchairs patio nearby hospital.

I siblings vaccinated first opportunity.  Non gated  So, let ask straight. going another 2 years lockdowns wearing masks delta variant? This. Probably time entertain idea living virus. one seems want come work 

I 180 hours sick leave 160 hours PTO. try take 4 hours leave get call regional director pressuring come least part day asking work weekend dire need seen slums India? Dirt everywhere. something soil, going caught poor population. “Free” don’t count ensuring harassment Red Cross hounding donate payment.  Thanks! I'm glad got something this.

I think variants matter much yet. do, we'll designate strains. Wow that's wild! tried looking commenting, came empty. Thanks reply. Ok... Yeah does. deducted part article: 


“It ubiquitous found soil air..” 



I’m sure Indians aren’t pushing faces dirt, cases home/factory growers working soil. doctors prescribing steroids even mild cases Covid, people wanted medicine


I haven’t heard read anything related this. Mild cases wouldn’t hospitalized, would they? effective treatments known. 


Well yes, way 18 months now. meds helped others don’t. I’m pretty sure doctors worldwide reassessing specific treatment. problem steroids given case don’t help much harmful (hurt body’s efforts fight Covid, well make vulnerable pathogens like fungi).


This said, article said well. given limited dose, limited time, Covid patients hypoxic.


Well yes that’s steroids always treated. 



What exactly adding first sentence haha Also, AZ recommended younger people, current target vaccination campaigns Europe. AZ diverted countries still need yo vaccinate elder. accelerate vaccination many countrues, good.  you’re vaccinated, it’s perfectly acceptable say it’s you, return regular life. That’s vaccines do. Can’t live fear cold point! advocating mask wearing covid need heads checked, I’m guessing accounts bots anyway, take care body, rarely get sick, didn’t get covid I’m fully vaccinated, obesity mental health crisis country, masks solve problem.  Dude never said falls short. falls short compared Pfizer Moderna. bit less effective Pfizer Moderna reducing symptomatic infection.(70% compared 90% roughly). difference bit less effective effective  didnt say masks affected it, fact said I'll continue wear them. would require reading. 
 
I spent time year worrying risk family. affected mental health, thanks ur useless input. Mac, so, u dont worry paywall 'Reader View' article. sure access windows device. realize generation (yes, I’m boomer) saved polio vaccination revered hell Jonas Salk considered vaccine godsend? kids, vaccinated smallpox, whooping cough, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella? know us, right? personal favorite Redditors post things like ""I care virus I'm done virus"". Look, get people want life go back way March 2020 virus work like this. 

I expect many containment measures US either, many states banned mask mandates.   respect IDIOT! endangerment ridiculous! Jenny McCarthy took antivax sentiments mainstream, got many Xer Millennial moms board. need rude assume done research. 

I done research lived thru P1 making mockery everything achieved year prior. 
Added yesterday country’s chief medical officer - speaking different variants - stated Delta variant indeed transmissible also results serious cases showing hospital follow - deaths. 

We talking thread unvaccinated children. US yet really hit recent variants thinking different seen effects first-hand. Particularly unvaccinated population. 

There people thread saying 50 vaccinated everything go back way before. people experienced 30s 40s comorbidities suddenly getting gravely ill dying large numbers. No, AZ fall short. Stop spreading disinformation. Nobody knows sure russian government banned real vaccines there. commonwealth requirement protect fellow man. 

I'm removing government benefits people refuse contribute healthy growth communities. say “opposite”. “Vaccination plus masks, vaccine enough 'Delta Plus'. need make effort short period time, otherwise would lockdown.”

This take home.  weird. sister-in-law, millennial, get Covid vaccine equates flu vaccine. believes since flu virus strains change often effective. Trying explain wrongness thinking like talking toddler. wikipedia links vaccination

I think I'll stick healthy biased ignorance tyvm read quite time, IIRC exposed prions get sick quite time.

Of interest concern prions passed one person another surgical instruments, even though properly sterilized.

Again, read since sometime 90s, anyone reading knows please correct me.  don’t know yet still transmit infected delta variant, unless proof haven’t seen. think it’s unlikely it’s serious unknown big implications. No...afaik. Fauci said contagious virus ever seen career, exception 1 other.  (not corona mentioned well-known virus par most...contagious ever seen life. Also sure mean deadly...in terms risk per patient, overall...but given contagious ends killing infects more, so...its killed far too...if actual risk per patient 1 case vs 1 case, sure, perhaps too.) doesn’t make sense, must hidden factor influencing results. top head could UK started vaccinating elderly first, elderly naturally higher mortality rate infected virus. data skewed towards higher mortality vaccinated (elderly) population.

Would worth look deeper patient data. know publicly available source raw data (age, vaccination date, variant, etc) data analytics it. pandemic never every country anti vaxxers

It’s unreasonable expect responsible majority continue live life restraint support selfish assholes. Let get Covid. don’t care you? states dropped masks requirements vaccinated. think Boomers debunked shit ages ago.  And? Right USA every single person two dosed walking inside places without masks probably gotten sick virus... Every single one. know why? Cause magically barrier around us cause got vaccine. still virus system antibodies fight never know virus cause asymptomatic. test every single fully vaccinated person goes gym without mask I'm guessing 90% come back virus... point spread asymptomatic... Getting sick problem severe cases that's problem. gonna severe case unless vaccine immunocompromised. what’s consensus delta variant? wife fully vaccinated haven’t wearing masks that’s CDC said fine. 

But delta variant, I’m reading saying wearing one?

What’s everyone’s thoughts mask wearing delta variant you’re fully vaccinated? Probably negative, exposed due buses least one person infected. Hence, fuck people. Lol -6, discussion allowed, beatings continue everyone ignores reality gets vaccine matter personal risk factors are! ""Do research"" - new war cry stupid Qpeople. position healthy children previous COVID infections risk re-infection complications? Please share studies referencing. Yeah would help. Yep. husband's boomer parents progressive get going door door signing people get vaccine also volunteering vaccination clinic weekly “Follow science” turned “ignore science listen broad general guidelines CDC meant cater lowest common denominator”. get CDC taken position everyone matter must get vaccinated (plenty “I swear COVID February 2020 tests!”, people). someone call crazy following advice son’s pediatrician seems based reality, fucking crazy. simply forgot mention people vaccinated yet either chose ( personal responsibility) young teenagers, young adults little chance go hospital (especially longer time) die.

LoL  Last saw regarding Sputnik Russia claims completed successful trials showing near 90% efficacy papers published disclose actual data. yet see anything released another county regarding good vaccine actually watching one extremely close track trusted published numbers are.

Last saw, J&amp;J around 85% effectiveness preventing serious cases require hospitalization death around 65% prevent infection overall. information may dated since kept extremely date one.  sure. people “doing right thing” protecting idiots won’t. us received vaccine returned least semblance normalcy, protection won’t part they’ll own. feel bad can’t get vaccinated live areas low vaccine uptake, feel zero empathy turn nose vaccine and/or refused inconvenienced year vaccines became available. I’m SC outside Charlotte, everyone vaccinated need mask inside /s. could start taking dogs heartguard, given devotion Ivermectin.. don’t understand vaccinations mandatory get coronavirus f out? lung cancer vaccine  Sure vaccinated, ain't putting life hands vaccine, masks gloves me. DFW area would get vaccinated...  Indeed. that's takes get reluctant it, I'm willing go along that. God save yourself. what's interesting UK compared USA, enabled flight restrictions Delta infected country, much faster USA.
I think USA cases climbing soon. Yep especially South. way single Governor reimplements mask mandate effective vaccines available. Seriously 600,000 deaths year half perpetual doomsday enough convince people get vaccinated, raising alarm variant month sure hell isn't. Ya, Cuba world renown medical Field along Russia China.

Delta/Delta-Plus Variants (plus whatever new variants even know yet!) going disproportionately going hit denial mask-wearing social-distancing vaccinations most. One might say also true before, think effect going greatly magnified compared earlier.

So 3 barely inapplicable examples, neat. Glad see place tiny degree comfort lives around global pandemic nearly 4 million people died, really showing true colors buddy Yeah Cuba, biotech/healtchare industry insanely good considering little resources easily rival first world nations think media trying manage expectations. still many people one shot shots, probably trying temper “its over” drive continued push vaccination. 

Read summary article; UK seen 50% increase cases. Delta variant may well create another wave. variant transmissible lead severe disease strains U.K., Delta variant accounts 99% new COVID cases, according Public Health England.

A couple surprising statements there. know sure delta causes severe disease? it’s already 99% infections UK? seriously impressive. figure also makes roughly 10% shots given Ontario yesterday, crazy efficiency one site. good thing Leafs still need arena!  course injury death rate accidental falls high, live gravity. gave pill exact statistical chance death would want take it? It’s one thing exist chaotic system shit happens another consciously choose take risk.


The reality J&amp;J/Astra Zeneca vaccines killing people. It’s small number people relative amount doses administered, it’s less deaths Covid would size group people died consciously chose get vaccines.

 
[J&amp;J vaccine blood clots deaths Zeneca administer vaccines could considered irresponsible given availability vaccines without risks.

There’s historical precedent relatively rare conditions leading vaccination halt:

“In 1976, concerns United States possible influenza pandemic involving virus similar deadly 1918 pandemic strain resulted large-scale vaccination program entire country. Approximately 45 million people vaccinated 10 weeks became known “swine flu vaccine” [16]. US government abruptly stopped vaccination program swine flu cases detected outside military base disease originated unexpectedly high number cases Guillain-Barré syndrome reported vaccinated individuals. vaccine estimated caused approximately one Guillain-Barré syndrome case per 100,000 persons vaccinated [17], resulting 53 deaths [18].”

“Guillain-Barre (gee-YAH-buh-RAY) syndrome rare disorder body's immune system attacks nerves. Weakness tingling extremities usually first symptoms.

These sensations quickly spread, eventually paralyzing whole body” say keeps out, slows giving health care opportunity flooded almost July. Every American access vaccine months. 

Eventually, let people take control lives decide risks worth taking.  Australia less 5% population fully vaccinated. Probably try get numbers fast. ""Delta Plus"" adds mutation Beta (S.Africa) helps evade neutralization vaccine previous COVID infection. said, appear spread efficiently - much like Beta (only 2% cases US Beta). also ""Alpha Plus"", added K417N mutation previously contagious variant (Alpha-UK B.1.1.7), take hold anywhere either.

I've played enough Plague Inc. know Covid causing much illness would jump vaccine fast.. know great, I'm hoping improvements.

EVEN randomly selected, knowing vaccinated cause behave differently. That's setup needs double-blind experiment two groups randomly selected neither participants experiment conductors knowing shots administered.

Holy shit one frustrating things right now. can't make long-term plans certain things know pandemic turn worse again.  that’s fine, remember science said overwhelmingly likely outcome completely fine.

Cases low, hospitalizations declined almost guarantee would pushback reinstating restrictions

Around March April lot talk cases might surge variant circulating time - believe Brazil South Africa. Yes, cases went awhile eventually came back down. Considering rural areas mainly people haven’t vaccinated, shouldn’t spread much among them

The problem guys saying bringing back mask mandates fair vaccinated. that, can’t base everything cases - base hospitalizations deaths There’s way say wasn’t. Except - evidence comes out, looks engineered. way around.

End date. Went hike! hike better! :-P can't transmit fully vaccinated would different?  It'll significantly faster first vaccines. vaccines 100% efficient preventing death, 

That statement comes various trials (of tens thousands people each) nobody vaccinated died COVID-19. (In trials younger cohorts, nobody vaccinated developed serious COVID hospitalized).

It's IMHO irresponsibly optimistic thing strip ""100% effective"" context since obviously going remain perfect extended much larger population tens hundreds millions. children adults, I’ve seen studies show suffer long covid.

Doctors scientists can’t predict future. cases rising deaths staying low thanks vaccination likely scenario, showing yet Israel. think least 3 weeks away data possibly showing true Israel. explosion cases started 8 days ago (and low starting point). lag deaths cases always larger that, fact even increase, cases still 1/50th winter peak. Assuming equal ratio cases deaths, based today's cases, one daily average death.  sore arm side effect I've ever had. TLDR vaccines working, people get vaccinated, higher proportion cases breakthrough cases hypothetical world absolutely everyone received less perfect vaccine. Although death rate would low, everyone died would fully vaccinated. Yeah would say watch CDC says. Also, pay attention state local health departments depending located USA vaccination rates differ pretty wildly. suspect likely happen (and Fauci commented well) under-vaccinated regions USA see increases Delta variants, whereas regions high uptake likely see very-little increases hospitalizations/deaths.  Took week smell taste come back. month two things still muted bit everything back normal now. back January year. isn’t really point. Boomers highly vaccinated age group every country. agree need straight talk, need adults charge thing, need proactive.

Fully reopening taking away mask mandate populated state governors celebrating end Covid literally Delta variant beginning spread opposite proactive. Older people that. young families want spend time around pool guaranteed sun. around half unvaccinated children.

This key. children vaccinated late summer, much better degree control. Hopefully Pfizer Moderna roll updated vaccines time kids. Good, listen ignorant anti-intellectual people exist. may loudest, that's smart Fauci longer trusted. Find another. stupid ott rhetoric help convince anyone. I'm sure well aware chances death covid age group negligible. child wore mask years Covid asthma allergies. mask provided relief conditions. think people might continue wear necessary comfort. know I'll wear one least cold flu season.

It nice cold last year. one talks fact, pretty annoying see many articles antibody levels drop dramatically months that's everyone needs booster shots soon. Either extremely ignorant journalism straight fear mongering Well careful new strains developing though. dont want constant new outbreaks. It’s depressing. need straight talk. shit what’s getting me. handle masks play safe longer. don’t want promises made prematurely. I’m 40 feel like I’m stuck generations. Xs think I’m millenial millennials think I’m genX. feel like parts both. 

I think uptake generation definitions pretty bad actually classifying people makes sense heard well sure chose Daily Mail opinion piece. Anyway, long short argument is: ""because change spike protein – allows coronavirus enter infect human cells – radical enough make vaccine completely ineffective would also, almost certainly, extreme make virus non-functional.""

Cimavax proven mortality benefit even studies structured provide positive result. hype. Exactly. Like, virus mutated visible looks like swarm bees? I’m hard time this.  Kids age 12 already get vaccinated Israel. mostly private gatherings easiest contact trace first place? normally can't contact trace fleeting contact public, except Australian health authorities cases case caught CCTV. Im area vaccine day. Uber free rides, services going door want it. get COVID get sick….well don’t give fuck

I say long hauler since 10 months ago. Someone knows shitty life survive it. seriously, stay unvaccinated see free patriots. exactly. time spent developing vaccines getting safety data. vaccines severe side effects show months shot. rule safety issues pretty quickly. time waiting enough test subjects get infected seeing long immunity lasts. vaccinated people, yeah. change fact Delta gets foothold unvaccinated population, we're gonna see lot dead people, would say ""be pretty."" Yes, “Sounds great—can’t wait peer-reviewed data” standard response time. Next question? spending 7 days costa rican hospital. put faith ""world health rankings"" weren’t required, wouldn’t fly mask all. since it’s required, won’t GUY wear mask. choice, bet wouldn’t wear mask plane. possible fluke. Remember whole airborne/aerosol thing? One case cited evidence covid spreading one hotel room another door slightly open. presumably OG covid. apparently happen regularly transmissible, well entire world would've gotten herd immunity hard way.

Lol people downvoting Australian health officials saying though bc sounds scary. Trust science, amirite? number isn’t true; please read clarifying coverage Strange. I'm 33 male originally Norway, high risk conditions (that I'm aware of), got first shot today.

Was quite surprised receive notification week. appreciate feedback I'm trying wear little face possible. never double masked never will. EXACTLY. Fucking a. convinced cousin get vaccinated Delta. think needed vaccine young, healthy, survived covid already. Told Delta, got shot immediately. I’ve fully vaccinated longer wear mask except business requires it.  Fox entertainment company. argued court journalistic integrity apply year, Darwin. kills quickly people gone straight covid denial vaccination.

You believe it, exists, problem unvaccinated people. Unvaccinated people *should scared.* vaccine never truly 100% effective, pretty darn close

*If* 45% figure correct (I would like see source), one reasonable explanation could deaths still happen among oldest frailest among population. age group *not* vaccinated, especially UK hesitancy low supply high. Relatively many vaccinated die unvaccinated.

That contradict vaccine high efficacy deaths. Without vaccines, current daily deaths could well 10x even 100x current amount. mix mRNA vaccine 2nd dose.

Edit: grammar  Ah, its, revealing information without express permission would gross violation privacy act.  literally said thing detail. debating? 😆

I originally commented someone claimed (and later deleted) article created spread fear, disagree with.

Anyways probably last comment. Basically, think article value gives us facts individually respond however see fit. ""x% infected/hospitalized/dead vaccinated"" stat really drastically different implications depending many people vaccinated long.

The US media CDC field day crowing number months making rosy possible misleading, namely even looking infections among vaccinated lead hospitalization setting timeframe way back late 2020 cases, almost one vaccinated. Almost one minded bad stats favor vaccine though.

We're going wean people number inevitably climbs US simply people vaccinated longer. Efficacy metric people (sometimes) understand think stick that. Probably every country relies Sinovac, Astra, Sinopharm, J&amp;J (any vaccine non mrna) probably need rethink strategy.

The latest official guidance coming Chinese side 85% domestically vaccinated herd immunity. that's based significant access Sinopharm's higher efficacy efficacy eroded variants. herd immunity hit +80% vaccination rates, really chance countries never get covid spread.

Abdala definitely breaking new ground tech interim results Cuba promising. also going magic bullet (like pfizer moderna) stretch. Abdala 3 dose vaccine third dose 28th day first dose. Efficacy also measured 14 days final dose. longer vaccination timeline huge challenge, terms getting people back two doses terms logistics. suspect we'll see lot infection spread due premature celebration (just like surge Mongolia due people celebrating Sinopharm, also 28 days first last dose). Ya look cancer vaccine......... pretty much anything bad could happen school likely kid getting severe covid. likely both. new variant 2 protected vaccines. real question someone protected natural immunity got Covid back November. masks walmart like banning assault rifles. prevents almost none actual problem. can't requite shot. matter govt media telling you, people taking shot. i'm also getting tested covid symtoms. got anti-body test antibodies (which provides REAL protection) matter people like care shot. tried Czech Republic too, reason happen gun depot terror attack revelations basically ended relations Russians. kids vaccinated. Still shitty small number want vaccinated can’t. true, many people like got shot ditched mask. Saying catch covid blatant lie. affected covid, still catch it. Low likelihood equate statistically insignificant CDC would state statistically insignificant. don't. state less likely. Geezus, good luck that. Maybe see get box labeled ""PORN.""

The amazing posts see reddit people survived bad parenting and/or evolved way beyond previous generation, somehow.

I got kicked house 21 best thing ever happened me. Last year, covid treatment free. Insurers shifting back, though, expect continue. course, first thing party ""personal responsibility"" declare bankruptcy escape debt.  arsed mask, arsed vax, can't arsed pay. feel ban immunocompromised arent well protected vaccines even first strain much less new ones kids arent old enough get whose parents wont let them. ability get vaccinated refuse point. It’s deaths. Kids adults. is. get vaccinated. Tell people government cover covid treatment choose get vaccinated hospitalized. Let em fuck around then. Oh well. problem. uncommon wear cloth mask N95 less obtrusive style statement. Designer cloth masks popular many seem less intimidating. US government ignoring plight veterans forever. expensive treat. doubt we'll see long covid sufferers. happen relatively quickly. US likely 200+ million combined vaccinated natural immunity. 50 million go! schools. found several countries remained extremely low frequency ... evidence strain currently expanding country.

Also, 200 cases one death since April... honestly sound like spreading fast.

Delta Plus something keep eye sure, new variants are, everything know far implies Delta big one. least now. Well done Cuba. makes sense people celebrating ""x% infected/hospitalized/dead unvaccinated"" headlines US proof vaccine works. CDC media really running it. people confusing efficacy (the proof vaccine works), even military official saying vaccine effective trials based stat among DOD.

So surprising people alarmed even 25% infected Israel fully vaccinated.

The real issue ""x% people infected covid vaccinated"" stat needs context meaningful, including percent general population vaccinated long. all-in-one figure like efficacy. lot less energy everywhere correct misleading stats long pro-vax. said south would rise hoping didnt mean this. Duh. I’m sorry…can tell see person getting infected video? What, exactly, look like? *waves fellow Austrian 🇦🇹* Yep like places reinstated lockdowns told us couldn’t holiday gatherings- ship sailed. get taste freedom told go back restrictions? Yeah, happening people. That’s exactly fully vaccinated people do. Anyone says anything else isn’t reasonable listening emotion rather reason. Tl;dr true precautions place.

Interesting part outbreaks occurred schools, leading closures.36,37 Significant secondary transmission SARS-CoV-2 infection occur school settings **when prevention strategies implemented followed.**36 outbreaks occur school settings, tend result increased transmission among teachers school staff rather among students. Israel, high schools closed less two weeks reopening two symptomatic students attended in-person learning, leading 153 cases among students 25 among staff members, among 1,161 students 151 staff members tested.36 Importantly, prevention strategies adhered – including lifting mask requirement heat wave classroom crowding.

It goes state transmission school less community precautions followed.  Agreed, need indoor mask mandate ... especially given easily Delta variant transmits. There's multiple cases Australia people getting brushing past person crowded store restaurant. spread 5-10 found European generic version law yet, Austrian version specifically includes SII version: Good guess saw edit. Thanks understanding. really trying stay positive. moved mom Dad’s couple years back got married little bit emergency fund case something bad happened. 6 months marriage wife gallbladder removed medical bills basically wiped savings we’re still paying expenses day. 6 months lost jobs COVID start square one yet again. We’ve also cars repaired multiple times course past year, scrounge money pay repairs. recently pre-paid next months rent money saved Qapital savings app, could peace mind first August. 

People definitely suffering way us don’t want ignore blessings have. It’s fun you’re living paycheck paycheck, constantly waiting something else go wrong. 

In mean time make ends meet I’ve working Amazon past year. even signed temp contract expires end July. 

So I’m praying get job back happens. 

All frustration extends much tired wearing mask go Kroger read wrote again. *lot* factors involved. Like: ventilation systems reliably clean air within comparatively short period time.

Then, there’s also fact things precautions: plenty areas probability one single person even spreads virus specific restaurant given week way 1%.

And it’s like breathing virus molecules give infection. There’s minimum dose depends individual immune system.

Also, studies Germany according neither schools, restaurants, movie theatres significant spreading events (on hand, schools seem currently major issue UK, it’s issue one study one area one time doesn’t mean cannot become problem later). time, proven chains infection people meeting privately, families living together. I've often used WWII example: rationing, blackouts, etc rationing food ... fuel rubber ment people really drive far much war. Yet American people manned bit help war effort.

Meanwhile today can't even get people wear bit cloth face. Agreed! faith science people! Yet they're probably pro-life. fucking joke, that's expected people. Sounds right, remember fully vaccinated oldest first, 'full vaccinated' group disproportionately old vulnerable 'single shot' group massive, 'no shot' group youngest. Raw numbers meaningless without context. think context age distribution vaccinations, fully vaccinated likely older partially vaccinated Vaxzevria AstraZeneca, it’s AstraZeneca made EU approved EU.

You thinking Covishield, SII version AstraZeneca.  It’ll dumb Eu doesn’t amend green pass to
Include it. incredible explanation, couldn’t appreciative took time sunday share information me. cancel wedding twice COVID we’re finally scheduled next month get married, trying informed possible understand expect July. Cheers mate. good news dont need 100% effectiveness. Life always involves risks, vaccination dramatically reduces risk level mundane things already face every day. parent young children biggest concern. understand chance death covid children low i’m willing take risk. also little information long term health impacts children. It’s also frightening know child severe reaction covid medication given adults covid aren’t meant children. Hope vaccine gets younger 12 soon. Long covid asymptomatic spread far need high quality studies data. Don’t @ me. find anything new data, article pure speculation. US mask wearing thing global cases That’s happens country governed kleptocracy whose strategy holding power reduce trust, pushing line everyone governs crook. hope right too. Semantics yeah sure Delta biggest drop efficacy, Beta reduces efficacy much (75% vs 88%). Politics nothing it. responsible people cannot vaccinated. no, it’s magically US, people don’t give shit anyone themselves. I'm talking potential future situation US many states low vaccine uptake, agree UK fine due high vaccination rate clear vaccines protect different variants. vaccinated definitely go back normal accept corona good. 99% effective anyone immunocompromised could closer 0% Agreed. always possible manipulate data achieve required efficacy. Even peer reviewed. fact numbers guarantee accuracy. However real world data proven efficacy numbers resistant immune, vaccines good, perfect. hell saying people fully vaccinated people still need mask socially distance? Like get public transit airports hospitals saying CDC says fine? quite. example would work room dense virus would guarantee infect 100% unvaccinated people. That's really likely occur practice, suppose sake argument ""covid-guaranteed-or-your-money-back"" room. yes, 5 100 fully vaccinated people catch covid. it! Somehow, Reddit got crazy, rational statement helped lot. faced fears, made through. hope people realization namely, vaccine negligable level risk compared guaranteed 100% chance bad time coronavirus itself. way needles stuck hospital, visualizing '2 tiny needles' versus 'a dozen big ones IV get ER' really helped get it. wanted say thanks :) tried talk Arizona Coronavirus sub, got automodded reason I'll try here...

I'm almost opposite situation you.

Myself grandparents people entire family got vaccinated. grandparents said they'd get thinking like, calling something already trying get appointment.

My parents, aunts, uncles, cousins — one actually _wants_ shots parents let — great aunts uncles, people I've never met heard — none get vaccinated. 

Most never even acknowledged COVID exists.

My aunt uncle Phoenix actually _had_ COVID time last year. Thankfully require hospitalization, think that's proof ""it's flu"" refuse get kids vaccinated. kids afraid doctors medicine there's way they'd try go get own. Maybe second shot didn’t make feel like got hit fucking train dropped 6 story window people would get it. I’ve feeling worse ever years since getting second shot Friday evening. Good quote put “Since Israel 85% adult population vaccinated, even 90% vaccine effectiveness Delta variance, one would expect among adults see infections among vaccinated unvaccinated sheer relative volume,” said Prof. Ran Balicer, founding director Clalit Research Institute director Health Policy Planning Clalit. “People find difficult understand. say, ‘If see many vaccinated people infected Israel, vaccine effective.’ case.” live south, haven’t chosen this. fiancée, friends, coworkers, fully vaccinated months, supported local efforts expand vaccinations. say holier though message, way remind people people stubborn doesn’t mean stop efforts increase vaccination rates. home, way (financially emotionally) leave it. We’re ones like either. keep supporting organizations politicians assist increasing vaccination rates rural south whenever can. I'm corona sub lol. can't escape pain. glad. Israel reported single COVID death *weeks*. easy scare people statistics context; accurate say “Israel’s cases gone 900%!!!” means cases went 14 day 140… well that’s serious it? reporting 8000 per day months ago. 

Same UK, case rate gone percent, death rate practically nothing. Small surges cases among unvaccinated partially vaccinated, breakthrough cases, always something anticipated. chronic pain disorder still put happy face work 40 hours week.

That's worst thing it. tedious, stupid tasks rich asshole lift finger save life-- also pretend love it. Feigning gratitude exploitation is, many positions, important part job. love commenters use US based site user population majority US based get bent shape discussions US focused  Care cite source number? that’s still exceedingly rare, couple fact it’s easily treatable Uh no, that's incorrect thinking I've trying explain. scenario true double-blind trials placebo vaccinated groups size behave similarly. Given 100 cases covid, many vaccinated depends HEAVILY much population already vaccinated, can't indicative vaccine effectiveness effectiveness change vaccination progress (ignoring possibility variants.

Republican Senator state threatening cut funding state health department daring push kids (and kids we're talking teenagers here) get vaccinated website. Cuba dumpster fire many areas, public health vaccine track record actually pretty strong. way along. reference link? seems crazy without context. Ehh. stories better discussion IMO. joke one California’s incentives $50 grocery voucher. *Delta enters chat* also made video call actually went get shot. least way know actually went. wants grown she’s scared anything own. try push independence it’s working slowly. lol.  means attend event there's 10% chance contracting covid vaccination, 0.5% chance contracting covid. value nothing many people vaccinated population. amount protection provided whether 1000 vaccinated 10M vaccinated.

In contrast, half covid patients vaccinated, quantity affected efficacy vaccines many people vaccinated. would much alarming happened 1% population vaccinated, versus 99% population vaccinated. correct tends 70-80% range aged 12+. almost sure herd immunity threshold.

However, substantially slow spread keep hospital capacity check, especially given likely hospitalized also likely vaccinated. Experts predicting big outbreaks threat healthcare capacity areas level vaccination.  know, Finland makes constant business across border Russia, major trade partner us, benefits cross-border traffic way greater risks. instead get population vaccinated asap help vaccination effort behind border.

We also can't block citizens moving across border due constitution.

People become way oversensitized issue. know, life without risks earlier. Heck, fight Russian pandemics way COVID, mean HIV-pandemic. Finnish old men love go Russia fuck cheap prostitutes. using comment whenever someone sub spreads misinformation Israels decision . Thank you. Yup, 73% people 65 Missouri fully vaccinated. percent people 18 years old Missouri fully vaccinated 48%. lot potential new victims there, spreading around quite time. free ride unvaccinated, gonna get sick eventually... already COVID, help them, get twice assume Delta definitely hit people already harder vaccinated. wanna say saw posts removed great work. reporting similar headlines future. Thank fighting vaccine hesitancy creating sensationalism! Clearly, ""Free Chick-fil-A"" way get people vax. Whether worth tenable maintain disease-preventative measures available different question measures are. guys say manage diseases. want know prevent disease, work them. think worth it, don't. 

If viruses mutate, arms ""moving goalposts""? disconnect corona Vax, vaccinations give kids (DTaP on) work *perfectly*. 

No kids get whooping cough, except unfortunate ones anti Vax parents. tells us regular people threat real, shots work. lizard brain says ""get vax, sick. Vax, get sick."" Simple. 

The corona Vax appears different. ""No Vax, wear mask, probably get sick, might, even we'll fine, unless we're old. Or.. Get Vax, still wear mask, still spread it, still might get sick, get sick less bad, unless new variant, probably ok, maybe not."" simple straightforward. 

So us regular people confused. think Vax ""cure"", think ""prevention"". confused exactly ""preventing"" still get it, still spread it, still wear masks.. school-aged children well raise interesting point. 

All things equal hit 80% fully vaccinated return school personally would surprised masks still mandated them. 

I hope I'm right I've wrong many times before. Wow……imagine getting mad organization simply trying tell found. 😂😂😂 mom doesn’t want get vaccine scheduled appointment 👍🏻 I'm sitting eating lunch MD browsing subreddit. state emergency officially 3 days, restrictions end. mask mandate ended month ago, except public transportation such. 

Still, half people Lowe's came masks come on.

Seems people taken ""if vaxxed mask, fully vaxxed wear one"" message heart. British News Network: England Delta Death Count: 117

Unvaccinated: 44

Single-Dose: 23

Fully-Vaccinated: 50

&amp;#x200B;

Very small sample size still scary. 800 persons track them. hiccup. myocarditis seems one scare stories press loves much. incidence low, far, every case cleared treatment NSAIDs. one telling parents that. That’s 4-6 months after. Going fall, smelt burning like everywhere. I’d compare electric stove heating that’s smelt time. Luckily that’s changed little bit. I’d say smell like 95% back. border closed foreign tourists travellers. Finns, freight, people living Finland sure cross, permit given good reason. Correct I’m wrong, thought accounted something like 90% cases? Hospitalization &lt;300 many people dying. Seems like it’s entering it’s “endemic” phase understanding. either go back normal lot cases deaths, continue living restrictions. think countries people accept COVID-19 stay wether like not.  [The Pfizer vaccine actually effective delta children 12 still high risk contracting covid 

They also low risk getting seriously ill get covid. not? think roving group 4th 5th graders karate robes instill fear. doubt true case numbers positivity rate low that's least good see. ASTM level 3 surgical mask cloth mask force good fit way go. I’m going frank you. Standing getting physically abused emotionally abused easy. cannot expect everyone that.

Either went though similar callous never went don’t really understand due lack comment comment given pause. Northeast region still seems lead vaccination rates, Southern states like Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina dragging feet 40%.  wasn’t saying saying lot parents treat kids part control insted another separate person unemployment talking US, UK somewhere else? weird lifelong disability even register folks. there. realistic chance hospitals overflowed current vaccination rates demographics highest risk serious issues vaccinated. absurd. Transatlantic travel minimal effect economy. Terribly sorry inconvenienced, there's *pandemic* on, know?  watching news countries already receiving vaccines donated US, schedule vaccines delivered countries? Narrative?? real world, story TV. Perhaps paid attention science might better understanding (dumb).

Current restrictions really limited, nothing stopping living life, unless getting upset minor inconvenience (selfish). Fully vaccinated people could always get sick Covid, variants not. Honestly doesn’t sound like CDC backtracking masks much saying small chance still catching Covid even fully vaccinated. fully exposed self front CDC, get s\*cked people? really want VARIANT jacket Loki wears second episode, maybe even continued news covid variants. Makes realise covid stay forever form another seems heavy anti-vaxxer influence sub wasn’t around 6 months ago. push back bullsh*t gets downvoted now. Depends vaccination rates community. 

Major urban centres closing 70%? Pretty much, yeah. (Although there’s harm taking additional precautions, that’s personal choice). 

Places stuck 30%? much. whole ""pfizer better AZ"" narrative another symptom american exceptionalism  Israel numbers down. Canada numbers down. USA numbers down. Hospitalizations far much lower. data indicates dying hospitalized unvaccinated people. know say. going manageable disease. going ""zero cases"".

Edit: tribulation over. Enjoy life. I'd say there's **lot** nuance here. elaborating bit said page: 

There different types antibody tests. There's basic one drug store (or ordered online) says Yes/no antibodies. others give quantitative readings. former tends accurate. 

It's almost like recommendation behind double masking. people it? No, might find uncomfortable risk tolerance higher that. you, purely public health stand-point, look it, obviously double-masking better single-masking. Good see moving quickly vaccinate 12+.

Indoor mask mandates sensible precaution keep Delta better understood. True, would add even small percentage vaccinated catch virus FAR likely mild case significantly less likely hospitalized die. 

So yeah, vaccines awesome, super excited get second dose Monday, it’s still worth exercising basic precautions common sense. benefit so?

If get done relatively inexpensive free, feeds data back system know breakthrough infections.  reason slow buy time vaccines available distributed. literally reason bother. clue invoiced like 18xx forwarded employer Literally yes, virus can. Look happened Spanish flu pandemic, people complaining symptoms today point affected economic productivity. seasonal flu virus get today, became endemic. get mono there's high chance also long term symptoms too. according supposed go back wearing masks, social distancing, avoiding large crowds’s? feeling, hope I'm wrong, we'll find AZ vaccine effective enough Delta variant prevent large-scale outbreak UK. know mean deaths, many people going hospital though. She’s already vaccinated. sure ruins suspect would. want able attend conference career options strongly depend...

(In Norway btw, issue: vaccination age slice, turn simply come yet, clear come time.) I’d love go back see discussion prior pandemic unfortunately Reddit doesn’t make easy jump certain date. exists degree cross immunity coronaviruses. Lots countries high(ish) vaccination rates already found J&amp;J (one-shot) useful order vaccinate people difficult get hold of, likely miss appointment second dose life-circumstances.

Those include refugees well homeless people. also women hiding abusive husbands possible moving safe-house safe-house lot.

Maybe TGA believes J&amp;J approved might become useful months time. Australian government suddenly realises marginal groups society would benefit J&amp;J, Canberra get hold batch then, least wait regulatory approval.

Although, I've heard, general rule Australian government really care much needs marginal groups society.... relative locally related. Here, would completely unrestricted week, new daily Delta infection cases increasing +40% per week, nightclubs fully open, tourists filling tourist spots again, etc. urge Americans take Delta seriously, we're similar vaccination levels, ripping place. depend God &amp; immunity... That’s literally says all. 

The UK seeing increase cases month hospital death rates followed trend. One month enough time started see increase going happen. 

The article said nothing vaccination regiment UK uses ineffective. Heart attack heart inflammation different though, they? hope joking. would drink alcohol getting vaccine mess immune system response?

You're supposed drink alcohol like 48 hours lol second shot awful. One worst experiences life. worst didn’t last long though. six hours. headache lasted week, ease. relief felt though, two weeks… feel like w/no mask etc. like life back normal… amazing feeling. don’t want again, necessary.

My whole family, mom &amp; dad, teenage boys, brother, aunt, uncle cousins nothing sore arm. Pfizer Moderna. took Moderna, honestly, think you’re gonna extreme inflammatory response like me, you’d probably get either shot. Since many take minor side effects, handful sides experiences like mine. vaccines wildly effective? 

Just aren’t actual magic armour, doesn’t mean don’t offer superb immunity, well beyond anyone’s original expectations. 

The variants eroded efficacy *slightly* ie percentage points, that’s all. article say 2-10% people take covid vaccine seroconvert.

On hand, we've seen high rate seroconversion even immunocompromised patients.

Vaccines work. Reddit large proportion shut-ins compared general population, many enjoyed moral highground last year. want give up. I'm curious. health conditions (if okay sharing)? reactions/severity vaccine? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* must missed anyone saying vaccines 100%, headline news here? FFS. Interesting. Thanks! Also figureheads compelled make sort recommendation. they're faced difficult decisions - recommend masks initially, look happened run food/TP. would hospitals can't procure PPE affect death rates hospitals can't treat people.

But people interpret recommendation masks work. 1 stupid study summary conclusions match methods. Perhaps recommended cloth masks initially, may still run N95s. eventually settled logistics control - confiscate horded PPE, bar N95s Amazon, etc came reasonable masking recommendations.

Not easy decisions.

Then political monetary influences - pushing expensive patented treatments like Remdesivir downplaying effectiveness alternative treatments like HCQ Ivermectin. also making stock market investments.

Compound cut corners, albeit necessity reduce total deaths, vaccine safety testing. Rat studies cancer patient studies show harm LNP, lower risk disease, are.

Then irony echo chambers. pro science crowd ironically calls educated others dumb/crazy fact they're less informed research data someone may risk averse actively keeping abreast studies, findings, risks. side coin echo chambers actual crazies, also lazy educate course like self congratulate spread nonsense within bubbles. Really, 90% people clueless relying second hand information intuition. selfish tho? months prior vaccines people like think grandma lmao grandma vaxd narrative think 12 year olds. 

everyone needs vaccine gotten one, need go further.

sounds like people enjoy nothing do, want feel bad want people locked too. Sorry life worth living, do. latter think flu less dangerous older people like survive bias. Flu around knows long, people vulnerable flu already passed young age. Combined multiple infection/immunization life time, older people today immunity flu. covid, nobody immunity, impact greater vulnerable people. 3 kids every year sick sept-November.  passing virus around. 

Normalizing masks sick brilliant idea adopting that. totally get people tired masks we’re sending kids school sick we’re going work sick we…two things definitely doing…we wearing masks. exactly try tell unvaccinated patients. 

Is going prevent getting COVID 100%? No. allow mild flu-like symptoms opposed ventilator. Agreed, slight distinction “out hospital and/or needing extensive ongoing medical care”. Obviously bad hospital, still massively compromise quality life throw major wrench healthcare system. 

That said, vaccines amazing holding well thus far variants. Would like see data vaccinated individuals happen get virus likelihood long Covid, signs point less likely vaccinated individuals too. 

Second shot Monday baby, can’t wait! mean may? preventative vaccine, prevents going ICU get sick... read vast majority people get vaccine develop antibodies. Blood tests antibodies could particularly valuable immunocompromised, however. Hm. Weird way? weird weird make sub common cold? He's talking everyone else saying there's link heart issue jab Effective severe disease = hospitalization  
It mean shielding people getting covid. millions doses specific age group he's talking about? wearing full face respirator p100 100%safe inside yeah, can't speak well without shouting . Thank you! support I’d choose severely hungover over, rather second shot
Side effects endured. Although I’m one family go though did. job finally offered recovery time off, got mine. course, said way I’d put again…. probably will, given enough time vaccinated people end susceptible variants. weeks June felt worry free, mask… like old times… amazing. I’m starting feel tad anxious though. wish people would get vaccinated…. numbers stagnant, variants seemingly breaking mutations. feel like trend, I’ll wearing mask everywhere again, near future. hope not, it’s looking good. Yep, like Asian people community I’ll wearing mask get sick on. I’m fully vaccinated longer prophylactic however (unless mandated local regulations). done part reduce likelihood vector, fully understand vaccine 100% effective. It’s reason get flu shot every year. 

If people want wear masks 5% - 10% chance vaccine failure fully within rights course! write ""all known variants?"" highlighted Delta variant original post. use word Delta front variant time said variant, misrepresentation?

The irony hope winter, I'm completely wrong right. Vaccinations protect Earth Delta. Nothing worry about. said, I'm glad I'm wrong vaccines impossible develop year less. mean, private insurance, likely can. yeah, sure hell beats feeling shitty 30 days more... Pretty sure everyone knows this, thanks. cases rising FL time 2020. It’s stagnant now, better rising! relative. state restrictions since March. would huge protests still restrictions. Fair do's, I'm speaking Englanders, London protesters statistically :) Yeah, ""resigning breaching covid guidelines"" excuse shift focus away real scandal. right acceptable risk. ain't yet. Hell even half America vaccinated yet. Many societies wearing masks ill/exposed illness DECADES. 

COVID challenging commonality asymptomatic transmission (which much, much less common flu common cold). 

As such, masking crowded places low vaccination rates and/or spike infections need fluid, variable decision, one would hope sensible, community minded person would consider vaccination rates higher/infections lower. Alrighty, you’re getting cringe. Good luck there. ✌️ drinking alcohol losing sense taste best thing COVID Dang, got haha. Touche. would too, always remember Walensky’s “imminent doom” never came. Walensky emotional trusted. It’s disgraceful American public especially women seeking authoritative positions.  countries vaccines accessible plentiful another lockdown makes zero sense. I’m giving way life asshats cousin shared bullshit Facebook. 

I part 15 months dining inside, visiting friends indoors, working home, wearing mask ultimately getting vaccinated first available opportunity. 

Pandemic guy. says article believe disconnect case numbers hospitalisation/deaths. 


Did read article?  weird sub common cold coronaviruses.  Delta 3 &amp; Knuckles concerned government extending unemployment time, laid since June important thing focus since benefits run dry. Thankfully, I’ll back work Wednesday finally. 

I knew wave going on, wasn’t main focus time. first airborne detector seen reach commercial status. wonder adopted applications throughout world. data consulted seems actual scientific backing. interesting. wonder insurance basically say ""we cover treatment disease could prevented vaccination, unless breakthrough case"". would hope CDC continues make evidence-based decisions unlike Israel. dumb 

Funny mention that, considering think pushing syringe someone's arm requires amount resources taking sample, transporting sample, testing sample, recording results providing person tested. 
    
I realize think know talking about, don't. also might killed somebody flu (like unknowingly handing autoimmune compromised person). concerned then? Genuinely curious. got first cold since pandemic started frankly? I'm chillin point that’s true still reintroduced masks. Who’s say can’t happen here?  I'm Canada antibody testing here. request doctor. Great idea. totally going ask doc check titres next appointment. 

I imagine they’re yet equipped check COVID vaccine titres (or maybe are? Genuinely idea), good thing keep track of. People always assume 100%. super unrealistic.

It far likely like polio. gone, large majority world, gone. enough people mostly immune, FAR less likely mutate.

That need shoot planet. Delta Variant fucking joke  agree experiencing anxiety/paranoia yes, taking break news good idea, remember sternly telling mom times past year really rough her. However, I'm surprised able notice second wave last winter, essentially shut city again, work sent back home again, governor sent emergency text alert phones (that weird), bunch people knew caught it, even avoiding news, able avoid that. mom crohn’s 20 years well feels exact way. Gross people sub use people pretend care stoke fear Highly recommend dentist office well.

Once get going whole office one big aerosol bath everyone that's seen. gross withdrawal syndrome terrible.   Good. Give citizens less privileged countries embrace them. 
The boomer Karens Kens refused get immunity delta instead. Stores carry items people buy. answer question people didn’t buy them. 🙄

Is anyone else seeing guy completely ignoring I’m saying? Would love know “escalating” determined bot whatever say lol.

Expletives, imagine.  almost 95% efficacy 100% efficacy?

Where vaccines widely available numbers way, way terms infections deaths. U.S. 200,000 new infections day holidays, we're 10 - 11,000.  3000+ deaths day, ~300.

Aaaaaaand...

99.2% deaths unvaccinated people.

GTFO antivaxxer propaganda.

The vaccines safe, effective, modern miracle.  sure. point is, America. 100% guarantee try, point lobbying it. 

Covid treatment hospital absurdly expensive. Many people spend weeks there, sometimes months.

I also zero doubt colleges require vax 2ish years. like require TB others.  math off, 30k cases one week away. Another lockdown within 3 weeks almost guaranteed. know magic shield, though? still get seriously sick long term implications like lung scarring. 

The Delta new cases per day increasing 40% per week, despite vaccinations date. nasty. We're barely restricted normal life, normal life things, holding weeks majority population double vaccinated yet get least single vaccine dose reduce risk life long implications great hardship, really. ""feels reals"" would've caused public health infrastructure collapse centuries ago. experience j&amp;j vaccine:

I (27 F) covid January, extremely mild. 101.5 fever went away never came back taking 1 Tylenol. really tired eventually developed annoying dry cough nothing terrible. got j&amp;j shot yesterday, woke morning feeling fine besides arm really sore. getting bed got chills grabbed thermometer read 99.7 degrees. Popped advil took nap feel perfectly normal! Boy needle hurt though... peak 60k cases day

They likely past peak, likely continue experience smaller waves Covid runs significant chunk morons whose chose get vaccinated one receives donation, gets immunized?  please keep us posted symptoms? Also, don’t mind asking… old you? think flu less dangerous older people like survive bias.

eh, think survivor bias really it, like either never got infected influenza immune system weak fight off. Influenza would extremely dangerous novel pandemic strain popped up, entirely possible far worse covid, covid clotting/blood disease means attacks body differently flu. worse older people could function multiple factors, survivor bias, immune response influenza, fact heart lungs naturally get weaker get older, disease causes blood clotting attacks cardiovascular system possibility much severe one hits primarily respiratory system. covid, nobody immunity, impact greater vulnerable people.

That's true. Covid cross-reactivity antibodies OG SARS/MERS, well couple milder corona virus strains circulate every couple years. immune response strong covid flu, incorrect say one immunity working antibodies prior start pandemic. older people today immunity flu

Yes, true, however populations covid hits hardest influenza even remotely close it. Like, we're talking covid several orders magnitude deadly 65+ range given influenza like, .8% age range covid something like 25%+

It's explainable people cross-reactive immunity new flu strains (although, like said, that's significant part it). Hi captain strawman, sorry I’m opposed evidence based policy really think value swift action absence evidence. evidence comes adapt accordingly.  teenagers died COVID since vaccine available died myocarditis. Myocarditis easily treated nsaids usuay resolves without long term effect. understand grand strategy immunity vaccination. matter vaccine supply. government backed AZ unfortunately turned good. quickly pivoted Pfizer bulk deliveries arrive October.

They can't start marketing campaign open vaccination ages right would create demand product yet.

When Oct rolls around, we'll see program ramp 100%. SMALL chance says, misleading title honestly haven’t time get vaccinated totally cool wearing mask everywhere. Kinda sucks vaccinated people it’s false sense security now.  It’s absolutely good right now. government refused total lockdown instead implementing “small lockdowns” certain neighborhoods. good news guess they’ve recently ramping vaccine distribution. sister got second dose Sinovac 2 weeks, everyone family fully vaccinated. Hoping hit 1 million vaccinations per day soon. how, whom. anti vaxxers, go something smarter, like kick pissed pit bull terrier scrotum he's eating.

If normal people - give wikipedia links vaccination find extremely selfish political game putting lives risk.

Why give doses population? There's nothing wrong Sputnik, works well, peer reviewed safe.

So stupid....  masked lockdown even realize hit them.

Nope, go let tons people get sick die like throughout pandemic. Thank you, defiant teenagers! Universities definitely not, understanding uni still planning distanced learning next year Makes sense, sorry hear that, massive layoffs job well, thankful spared. Glad able get back work. Things rebound well. Pretty sure schools universities open now? confirm. I'm novavax trial currently covid. absolutely floored me. think I'm worst still feel dreadful. Private insurance **heavily** regulated federal state governments it’s like whatever want.

However I’m sure covered laws. probably hasn’t come now.  may regular old bacterial pneumonia. mom years ago. week hospital ~2 months recovery, fine now. Didn’t realize able go class “minor inconvenience (selfish)” restrictions left? Wearing mask? It. Is. A. Piece. Of. Cloth. I'd mask (hell, even double mask) forever saved even one life. Anyone unbelievably selfish. as? Haha tell 5g internet amazing work getting taste back, though? would much worried smell.  [This Sounds like spewing bullshit authoritarian propaganda.   true US Americans donate blood lot people donate get tested things HMO charges? seems like one made facts me. Isn’t STI testing HIV testing free US?  got covid 2 weeks first dose Pfizer. think second hand fully pfizer vaxed adult infected son. think sick heard clearing throat (allergies huh) one day tummy issues. felt fine throughout bad day every days. Congested, better. Lost sense smell, better. got tired, terrified remembered symptoms came went quickly uneventful. Truly tired one day, great. (but honestly comes goes.) got dry tickle throat came went. went second vaccine dose, full 3 weeks first symptom actually felt even better then. 

For smell thing, challenged smell specific things times day could find sense smell slowly coming back. lot things smelled rotten first second day soft smells avoidable. fully smelling within 4 days. bad. Btw, smell liked hummus toast best hummus weird texture gets roof mouth salty little sour. Peanut butter, wasabi, etc would probably work hummus house. Anecdotally think mostly older gen x thing, lots people across spectrum.   No, not. actually pretty narrow-minded assume problem goes away dying single generation. ingrained cultural problem. blatant lie.  1/16,000 young males likely go substantially identified risk.

Still worth getting vaccinated, perhaps one others better option. rate, antivaxx concerned side effects. case hospitalised,  small number deaths. Myocarditis reduce life expectancy due impacts later life.

(233 -12)/3.62m = 324 people age 18 died covid since pandemic don’t think much worry course type death sucks Okay, Crazytown, that's enough outta you. know method signing vaccines, feel like kid wants one, knows best. Look government wanted sneaky shit advertise it.. Mhmm that's cant make media arbiters truth like made be, social media allowing one thing said pushing views people break echo chamber. end vaccine fanatics, people dont trust it/ antivax  Um...back school pal. need look cases within specific, impacted population.

The rate specific age group males way way higher that. Looking 1/15,000 more.

FDC already adding disclaimer mRNA shots saying myocarditis pericarditis possible.
I think likely start recommend vaccines 30 shortly.  That’s fair. mean, think media pushed type thinking. Using key words phrasing click bait worthy headlines. experience people read headline don’t bother read article. try educate much people want hear want hear.  friend got months back sense smell still 100%. sure common though. Doom always coming next two weeks people Also look people contracted covid beat it, immunity vaccine give still get vaccinated, must, probably makes people think fixes stops everything news rolls Delta, plus relatively unknown efficacy vaccines variant, let’s play hypothetical game.

What happens leads another wave lockdowns/“country shutdown” again? Dreading thought, anyone feeling comfortable prospect advance?  Dude really thought saying something cool 💀 can’t read Hebrew translation great.

It’s vaccine, man. One safest scrutinized vaccines ever created. someone’s 12+ kid going way get COVID-19 vaccine without permission, kid expressing desire inoculated dangerous infectious disease. Don’t boomer. realize doors dentist's fucking airlocks. gf's took months come back perfectly fine now. happened March 2020.  Let's real, biggest culprit along private unmasked gatherings.

I know true not. Plenty people go work jobs can't done front computer home. Mid-40s understand. throughout ordeal, though, there’s attitude “those people old it’s bad” lot people. We’ve seen lot statistics reported. Poss people felt ill first ( mostly AstraZeneca) could see reluctant get second. knocked lot people six days. 
I Pfizer, ok first. terrible headache tired second.  know it’s easy fall nihilism “back square one” isn’t happening. stayed holiday inn express last night? continuation wearing masks even vaccinated people important. Even opinion. vaccinated people going contract Covid, allow mutate transmit others never die keep mutating.

At least non vaccinated person gets won’t able transmit near much vaccinated person sick home hospital. old don’t mind answering  w.ho. ignoring ivermectin. said taken outside clinical studies.  continuation wearing masks even vaccinated people important. Even opinion. vaccinated people going contract Covid, allow mutate transmit others never die keep mutating.

At least non vaccinated person gets won’t able transmit near much vaccinated person sick home hospital.   stay long? guessed it, die Can’t seem find source one Twitter account handle’s say so. Would like source data find one. COVID going anywhere. like people get flu shots flu still goes around, people going get COVID shots COVID still goes around.

So silly. real virus profoundly disturbing lack critical thinking.  Hey, that's awesome. used, hard plastic paint mask. last one stop spreading anything. I'll need restock used last couple know still hard find.  think shown vaccines significantly lower risk transmission. even vaxxed person gets it, symptoms, fight spread wide.

That always thing drove spread covid, people contagious know it. Mask help one best ways stop transmission. continue constant fight Covid don’t. New vaccines, boosters every year continue mutate even vaccines.   often wonder move put economy public health. Ahh, could please share data store types Covid spread in?  like there's fucking force field separating exam rooms everything else. air. Yes higher concentration infected air exam rooms themselves, still travel mix air rest office. Gotcha, thanks taking time. Probably  Covid-80s/90s Well that’s wrong, fully support masks I’m electrician works medical jobs. wear N95 masks certain places within 6’ anyone. don’t think construction worker hated masks can’t help you.

I believe masks still best defense virus truly best way eradicate it. masks, vaccinated people still continue get transmit it. Sooner later mutate vaccine won’t effective. constant vaccines boosters children immune comprised people can’t get hospitalized.

/r/qanoncasualties/ I'm sure think science changed since right back provide recent source? Sorry hear that. would situation mostly same, get 3rd/4th dose another test month later. Maybe change doctors ask fears. vax March, get boost brand? nailed congrats, except kids 12 Delta mucho Grande delux industrial strength!! actually city I'm from. Fairly regularly too. really. colds aren’t caused Coronaviruses realize that, believe US around 90% insured. among 90% concerned this, insurance cover it. Obviously doesn’t help without insurance, people advice didn’t involve insurance. It’s great see country finally acknowledge high vaccination rates, data supports return normality, zero coronavirus neither realistic goal possible one highly interconnected modern society.

*Every* Zero Covid country saying since beginning. Honest question: world objectively better place wore masks things like shopping stores indoors? can't make norm, whether there's pandemic? I’m fully vaccinated, deathly afraid getting second first pretty bad. long hauling Covid knew second would hell. terrible envy (like rest family) great. Baffles Fauci whoever won’t talk vitamin D. many studies connecting deficiency &amp; outcomes real answer is: talking ass   4 year research soda drank today? cereal? Others research you...you need one understand it. WSJ saying fully vaccinated. put another comment “clear cut” ~~arms hands~~life since last year. Viruses care believe them

They'll still try kill literally says opposite post. Delta plus effect two dose. get sick like viruses probably get severely sick. like alpha gotten sick roaming around without vaccine. magical barrier around us... viral load matters. Asymptomatic cases show tests testing people. never know spread either. might reaction kinda good thing cause stay home. So, last sentence person responded to? Thanks.

I recall, years ago, poor kid dying Diphtheria parents refused get vaccinated anything. parents live rest lives. know it’s race evolution. know best. I’m even angry mask social distance again.

I cannot another lockdown; would Hell.

See another comment thread definition Hell. Single dose essentially unvaccinated since haven’t enough time immune response build True, 80% vaccinated people amount cases 20% unvaccinated ones, suggests vaccine cutting raw case numbers around 3/4 (admittedly, given low case numbers far difficult draw firm conclusions), could still make pretty big difference even get much vaccine affects transmissibility get it.

And suspect least unvaccinated 20% could probably vaccine, would help. Given woeful level protection afforded Sinovax Sputnik 5 variant hit especially hard. Indonesia seen first hand amongst health care providers. What’s Deez ? /s seen data this, I'd bet there's strong correlation Israel people religious people vaccinated.

So bet places strongly religious people places outbreak going mostly happen. hope so. Kinda sucks people got vaccinated vaccines first started rolling hitting 9 months soon countries start finally welcome tourists again. “Thinking covid all” bit exaggeration. people know sheltering place avoiding gatherings?

I’ll rephrase. people significantly altering lives due covid anymore. witnessed people COMMIT MURDER mask mandates before. matter opinion 

[Michigan University matter hospitals begging people wear masks people see scientists enemy pushing demonic agenda strip freedom

Many people care someone close dies nearly dies vaccines US problems variants mRna vaccines never will. why, report actually Chinese Russian vaccines effective variants. title left out. people. understanding FWIW evolutionary pressure viruses evolve ways evade current vaccines. makes intuitive sense, since larger population hosts case variants infect vaccinated people, mutations ""successful"" evolutionary sense.

I know much seeing moment, since people worldwide vaccinated date (about 15% believe).

Apparently best thing Coronavirus vaccinate everybody overnight, existing virus population nowhere go also opportunities mutate. worst thing slow rolling vaccination program, there's large ongoing population people breed different variants virus try replicate vaccinated people.

This one things worry since seem headed direction latter type program, especially considering planet whole. Bioterrorists gonna bioterror guess United States, people dying covid intensive care unit still ranting hoax. Delta variant brand new pandemic though, despite lot rhetoric “well people said covid Jan-March 2020??”

There’s really reason believe Delta looming monster set us back square one. Unvaccinated people problem, know currently vaccinated protected. That’s huge. 

I’m willing change opinion presented new information, it’s definitely looking like time ring lockdown alarm bells right now.  live US already practically over. kind self-centered thinking reason we're situation first place.

I think people realize 4,100 is. That's 10% capacity typical MLB stadium. start baseball season, stadiums restricted capacities, many still allowing around 10,000 fans in. might've watched game back April said ""Wow, look people stadium"". 4,100 still less half that. Across entire country.

In terms money percentages, imagine $330,000,000. $4,100 0.00124% that. Let's bring manageable number people probably used to. $10,000, percentage 12 cents.

It's said humans terrible comprehending big numbers (Like everyone surprised find million seconds 12 days, billion seconds 31 years, etc) they're bad comprehending tiny numbers.  Um, people know absolutely still thinking Covid, regardless position vaccines mitigation measures.  Mutations happen. fact life continue happens since there’s 0 scenarios thing eradicated forever.

UK Portugal, high vaccination rates high Delta prevalence, numbers increasing fast. countries, Rt well 1, UK cases graph slope almost vertical.

And countries EU, deceptive case numbers low, reality number Delta variant cases doubling every 5-14 days.

There clear trend, prediction going easily surpass previous peaks, hope I'm wrong.  wore mask year half cases deaths spiking everywhere mask wearing compliance 99%. got 2 doses mRNA vaccine millions others cases deaths plummeted. I’d take boosters wearing mask, public least. 

Wearing mask home family close quarters better wearing 5 minutes Target. This, Tampa bay horrid right now. Ah yes full year half minimal social interaction depression still people unreasonable upset things going slowly even get vaccination Yeah, would great anyone could provide actual counter-argument instead clicking little ""shut up!"" button, lol say dystopian definitely fucked up. information effect two shots variant? I'm still wearing mask, sanitizing hands, really going much anywhere aside work to. vast majority town (tourists included) seem think going maskless cases climbing. I’m personally looking forward Delta Pro Max variant. Personally, think vaccination (barring medical exception, course) mandatory employment US. lot companies already this. 

It sucks might come threatening people’s livelihoods, that’ll certainly get people butts. Accessibility huge issue considered you’ve said, lot pure selfishness can’t think way around save strict vaccine mandates. Moderna Pfizer vaccines problems variants. Nither J&amp;J Russians Chinese vaccines mRna vaccines. Imagine caring little welfare child, choose vaccinate deadly contagion. 

There’s lot said needing pass test order allowed procreate. Nah fam good. No, far less successful spreading. anywhere near contagious Covid, would run wild, despite killing bunch people. lack empathy kids people can't get vaccine awesome!  Vulnerable teens absolute *last* vaccinated, CDC won’t actually update info all. groups much higher incidence severe side effects vaccination, still insane amount, way closer 1-5% range 0%. average completely healthy people getting first, but, they’re also large exact type person higher incidence vaccine since see healthy fine. We’ll never reach herd immunity least America.  could right, sense mask mandates dropped many states, Delta variant spread 5 seconds simply walking someone mall. (and likely spread vaxxed unvaxxed vice versa) So...if states re-enact mask mandates...you could looking wave big worse last time. possible current lack guidelines. Russia though right? less 12% vaccinated 2 doses. No, needs long enough spread. it, waste resources, far virus concerned, due immunity. would long-term better virus kill more, would encourage people kids replace dead, people infected. Great news ! hit hard early pandemic. know what's really gonna hurt young child? Getting Covid dying. Yes. going back US going dealing years antivaxers petulant children don’t want wear mask Even won’t care. I’ve lost count number people said something effect “if give rona elderly dad gets sick dies, well he’s good life”. lot people, especially southern US, lost parents close relatives changed bupkis refuse to. 

Sorry OP. may right live wrong entire planet. Fox News needs sued oblivion shit. Millions going die propaganda. Well that’s it’s imperative ensure widespread vaccine coverage. Given slightly lower efficacy, probably prevention infection would lower, sterilizing immunity induced still almost 80%, know asymptomatic vaccinated infections transmit drastically less. Fully vaccinated feels like can’t trust community keep safe same. Guess I’ll continue mask even mild case Covid lifelong effects.
What children can’t get vaccine yet? Sadly might biggest victims chances shutdown again? pharmacies go ""literally built sick people""? Every pharmacy basically whole store pharmacy attached. Hell, lot grocery stores pharmacies almost every store country sells counter medications. So, tell me, special pharmacy makes much likely encounter infectious person vs. grocery store, Walmart type store? Last checked, every prescription medications efficacy standard infectious diseases. Maybe, maybe Tamiflu, colds, hell bothering go pharmacy?

What I'm saying is, concerned, better concerned lot places pharmacy ER. better concerned Walmart grocery store wherever work. makes sense...like effort get vaccinated get things shut down, people losing jobs, etc still need lockdowns?

Can’t blame Yes, exactly. think people heavily invested believing vaccines create kind magic bubble around prevent anything bad ever happening you. There's nothing wrong wanting true, start making plans basis, there's going crash.

Certainly human immune system effective purging pathogens body, certainly vaccines great way stimulate ability. think anything hundred percent effective (and effectiveness Coronavirus vaccination likely drops time passes).

There somewhere blind pessimism blind optimism need be. Yeah, countries generally want felons country. block even taking vacation country. Regardless felony charge is. Exactly. vaccines incredibly effective protecting hospitalization death Delta, like every variant. Sure, Delta vaccines offer less technical effectiveness contracting (which fear mongering articles state)... vaccine prevents getting seriously ill it. gives shit technically catch asymptomatic mildly sick days? 

We want prevent bad outcomes COVID - hospitalization death - vaccines remarkably effective variants, including Delta. mods anything clamp doomeresque posts? need Follow rules year

Well everyone followed rules, everyone everyone got vaccinated could would lot better place. anti-vaxers/maskers non-rule followers really screwed everyone furthering spread contributing creation new variants. can’t take shit anymore!!! want fucking life back. know it’s WHO’s fault, mutations happen, adjustments made faced new circumstances. fuck man… I’m exhausted. nothing new, covid vaccine bee widely available like 2 months US. agree used stockpile donated. Make enough available vaccine hesitant change mind highly doubt many vaccine hostile change minds. No. didn’t two years lockdown mask wearing anywhere US from. sure think would worse since extraordinarily effective vaccines. initial lockdowns, places US lockdowns, we’re early established treatment vaccines.

I'd happy bars also check along ID help enough delta variant. mask wearing UK transport/stores/etc, cases rising exponentially. reason weren’t strict complained. happens UK, Australia, Canada, Peru, etc. happens completely submissive unarmed population. precedent that's century  I'll honest, especially summer, real desire sit inside restaurant. I'm much happier outside anyway lol It’s Twitter. Lots clips news segments Australia health people saying contact tracing showing case.  Would ok people allowed travel enter certain building (eg sports arenas, train station, anywhere lot people) refuse vaccinate?

Freedom choice mean freedom consequences. different anywhere else? People always pressure oversell achievements. Cuba despotic government believing shows effective American propaganda been. welcome skepticism type shows age.  J&amp;J March. worried data coming out. go get mRNA vaccine “booster”? Yep, saw doc couple years ago mentioned constant exhaustion mild depression. Vitamin supplements amazing. mean, I’m running marathons don’t go back bed two hours getting either. true. directly CDC website today: 

Children &amp; Teens

Although fewer children infected COVID-19 compared adults, children can:

Be infected virus causes COVID-19

Get sick COVID-19

Spread COVID-19 others

CDC recommends everyone 12 years older get COVID-19 vaccination help protect COVID-19. Widespread vaccination critical tool help stop pandemic. People fully vaccinated resume activities prior pandemic. Learn child teen fully vaccinated. Children 12 years older able get Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Yeah sure. That's Delta Plus found India, UK US several countries weeks first identified. transmit easily. makes sense.  28 year old rational male, im scared get pfizer alternatives link pfizer/moderna myocarditis. Misread, however cancer EBV accounts 150k deaths year globally, 3 million. Get nonsense. original goal even vaccines something around 70% effectiveness! held getting FIRST dose June. waited blood antibody test became readily available- negative, went get vaccine.

I fully vaccinated everything else child, vaccine past ten years receiving HPV vax 9th grade, again- means get flu shots. 

I never thought twice vaccines before, thought everyone got them, I'm planning getting second dose. 

1st dose efficacy something like 50-60% two weeks, feel confident level protection, either infected I'll infected less severely, fairly healthy otherwise, I've never afraid infected naturally first place. I'm still holding tiny level natural immunity possible, even vaccine immunity, feel pretty okay that. efficacy comparable efficacy vaccines, like varicella years- I'm much protected, too.

I probably taking boosters unless discovered massive change pathogen need completely different vaccine. fact MRNA vaccine whatever phase me, contents- want take something need negligible level benefit. Correct: gay bisexual men disproportionate risk getting HIV least US. like people travel areas malaria wait 3 months donate departure. person higher risk exposed something harm recipient, need take extra precautions. That's honestly sub. nasal vaccines end working out, would still work you? hope something least drive infection feel safer future.  nice. sure downvoted, yes, work vaccines started years ago… current iterations less year old obviously comfortable enough take it, it’s new vaccine minimal testing. here. grades suffered school, wore mask 8 hours day August May. literally caught covid thanks grandfather (who complained masks vulnerable 3 categories) working stupid marines like wearing masks work. kept school nearly month half, almost graduate, coughing fits every. Single. Day. *five months.* 

I got doses, follow store policy ask masks, that? I'm gonna hindered nutcase anymore. want go sample honey. Yes part reason got tested.   Also wanted know case spread family.  looks like isolating kept catching cold.  probably would isolated much pre-COVID days. Thanks deciding meaning life person internet thought it. decided it.  Maybe winter consider it.  wondering immune system practice.... Mine comparatively easy. scheduled J&amp;J shot, Sunday local NFL team’s stadium. took 2 hours start finish got line get parking lot. stadium half hour live. family hit cycle - husband older son got Moderna, younger son got Pfizer.  I’m going 7 months it’s still back completely, coming back very, slowly. Seems like scaled production now. When/if countries say can’t go without electronic vaccine passport, that’s rubber hit road, IMO. Might federal instead states though (but I’m Canada don’t really understand US system well). die!?? Sorry hear m8. Oops gross mean: husband's reaction? see reason go back isolating, opinion kept people safe. teenagers side effects whatsoever.

Edit: sorry, one sore arm. would easy hide. I'll try make short. Covid last fall. Never lost sense taste smell, hit like severe sinus infection, along chest burn shortness breath. lasted week done. January comes, receive first dose Moderna shot, second dose beginning February. Followed guidelines T. Wore mask, social distanced, insta cart, whole bit. terrified virus, felt best protect family. 

About month half ago, woke one day could breath save life. chest felt like someone lit fire there. cough terrible. knew exactly was. got COVID AGAIN, time worse. Two weeks go by, finally get get x-ray precautionary reasons scarring lungs. dont smoke cigarettes, I'm 30. PFT week see lung function is, terrifying one knows long term effects this. definitely variant hit me. When's divorce? Yes, yes, Florida  Quest Labs supposedly one too. I'm going see doctor order covered insurance. I'll try get anyway. I'm fully vaccinated (Moderna) take Methotrexate autoimmune disease able suspend treatment get vaccines. get respect deserve based actions

Totally agree. add point, also feel ""unconditional love"". think love ever unconditional. subject ridiculous conditions (e.g. child cis-het, child fat, etc.), reasonable conditions totally fair game (e.g. child decent human discriminate/abuse others). No, don’t. archive: Booking tour bad.  WHO:
“'There yet enough evidence use vaccines COVID-19 children make recommendations children vaccinated COVID-19. Children adolescents tend milder disease compared adults”.

Yes, part reasoning limited doses, you’re sharing information. crazy, pretty sure math probability higher based local exposure rates, difficult track you’re actively testing, also testing methods differ place place timing results vary often take days. Testing tricky. So. Many. Variables. got covid march 2020 bed ridden six months , couldnt breathe well. Still brain fog actually interested knowing, two studies pretty good   will, three month deferral last sexual encounter. Women sex men sex men, also deferred three months. course, that's still long time abstain sex.   Another problem honor system (for masks) fairly certain many unvaccinated dishonorable going indoor establiishments, unvaccinated children are. utterly empty platitude  polio 100%? bad were

People think second dose side effects ""bad"" idea bad covid19 effects be. people contract covid19 exhibit symptoms similar Alzheimers patients...  2nd shot April? both? know gave covid?   Probably passed “OMG maybe kid covid!” hate reddit hivemind seems think we’re targeting *permanent* elimination covid. We’re not, would fucking stupid. We’re keeping till we’re vaccinated, taking forever badly government buying vaccines. Cm mean basing covid vaccines SARS? Surely developed longer year. opinion treated Dr John Campbell needs replacement I’m willing bet that. would hope would case, school districts done far stupider things. don’t remember ever told 100% effective. risk always part life Why? don’t care think, don’t care think. What’s end game here, change minds become science deniers? Buy conspiracy theory de jour? It’s going happen. seem fragile need persuade. strong man stands convictions silently. try it.

Edited add: children dont natural immunity, fewer ACE2 pathways. you’re going regurgitate misinformation least know you’re saying. find interesting SF pushing mandatory vaccination. city offers quite bit freedom choice many inhabitants. disagree requirements, definitely sf grain. WHO, imagine, worried vaccines anybody.  Hey Yeah, people getting vaccinated right fucking nuts.

Side note crazy we're talking ""only"" 88 percent? It’s 88% effective Delta variant. 25 vaccinated individuals introduced Delta variant 3 would likely test positive. Whereas without vaccine protection extreme likely contract Delta variant. 

I’m hearing symptoms worse aggressive earlier strains Covid.

Continuing wear mask around others, sanitizing surfaces, habitually washing hands still good idea.

Vaccination best way fight variants mutating. unvaccinated eventually see higher higher death-tolls. shit.  me. Worst cold I’ve years. going back wearing mask public again. worth getting sick. Crohn's makes anemic, take really potent medication, that's double whammy able donate.   hope get much-needed rest thank service community. One thing pandemic confirmed even smallest, minimal sacrifice much way many people handle.  what's suggestion? work? get vaccinated, wear masks, isolated fucking morons party like nothing odd going on? get point fair us responsible... Lucky .My arm ached like mike Tyson prime taken bite it. Lots insurances already take stuff account. Try get disability insurance real medical problems like MS, etc. almost can't unless rich. People right wether wear mask not. would anyone ever pass that? 

If wear mask weak immune system, simply want hide face, maybe allergies feel helps, maybe keep face warm. wonderful reasons wearing mask. fully respect decision, let’s forget TWO WAY STREET. end something called parosmia, complete distortion smell. things like chicken, onions, garlic, fried food, beans smell taste like vomit. covid back January lost sense smell completely, got back February and, weird thing, developed parosmia second Moderna shot April 18th. people say usually develop around 2-3 months covid, still believe spike protein shot something it. pretty good last 8 months, totally buggered vaccine rollout absolutely shite handling quarantine good combo. took niece get covid shot.(covishield dose 1) Shes 19. mom went police. India. imagine shit show. showed receipt get vaccination let go hours harassment. thought would loose job boss congratulated me. 

Someone told mom daughter able get pregnant took shots. 

Before ask.. already expressed interest getting vaccinated. That's took away cell phone stopped pocket money. mean mom. 

She went get shots parents home. mom work dad 'reading' local library. 

All eye opening experience. I'm dreading day really gets married maybe fails give grandchildren. happen. Nothing life guaranteed. mom would come again. Lol replying someone primarily concerned pharmacies ERs ludicrous. Look much spread occurs work, places worship, weddings, etc. really think 400,000 cases day mostly pharmacies ERs? I'm going go hunt data backing damn obvious bother with. Proof positive vaccines work. Although careful Delta. Yeah. complaints. that's me. 

Bye! see Darwin joke time sub, I’m really biggest fan.

Realistically, vast majority people catch Covid die it. IFR something like &lt;1%, much lower subset people (young folks) lowest vaccine uptake.

We honest folks risks. Yes, probably won’t die Covid. get vaccine protect grandma. avoid real risk long term effects. — though probably won’t die Covid — it’s nearly free way eliminate risk.

I worry overstating risk (which Darwin joke kinda implicitly does) get vaccine skeptical people need reach completely tune us FOXNEWs talent became advocates vaccination would go long way toward helping close gap. 
 
Or even avoiding ""Fear Uncertainty Doubt"" reporting topic would help some. Well slow something like covid seems time potential carriers wants medically at-risk kid, living since April 2020 vaccinated.  Oh yeah. obviously assumption set population i.e 50% vaccinated 50% not. trying define 95% efficacy. Covid endemic now. rest lives, like flu, common cold, etc. highly effective vaccines combat virus. readily available anyone wants many parts world continues rolled places well. 

We two options: wear masks forever, lockdown, close heavily restrict businesses forevermore, live fear return normal lives. choice yours. 

I choose latter. 

The science speak settled. choice whether return normal life yours. truly ends decide does. decided already life returned full normal. go eat, haven’t worn mask month, spend time hugged loved ones. I’ve vacation planning another. two weddings coming up. 

You’re welcome continue living way best works you. part world live in, Covid-19 don’t care says, I’m going back living way last 16 months. Medical care Cuba pretty widely understood meeting first world standards. would surprised results borne additional studies. evidence coming Australia seems show transmission Delta variant happen mere seconds, walking past someone. yes, places like grocery stores definitely require masks that’s case. been.. been? That’s whole point everything that’s done know 

I work healthcare wear one anyway people underestimate much environment affects them, much peer-pressure actually involved decisions.

We keep vilifying trump voters, vax-hesitant people, calling fools, reality help bring back reality normalcy. 
We function environment daily information digest. people fools, function different variables. Compassion understanding way get people back side.  
Hope everything gets better South man, I'm sure lot people going accept vaccines get vaccinate autumn! I’m going throw - thought fatigue related covid, months after. Turns out, vitamin deficient. don’t covid effected not. might worth checking. Hope I’m seen “that person” making random suggestions.  wrong waiting 15 days? fact people get booked good fact don’t wait months even better. Washington gets involved reluctant people be.

The best way get vaccine compliance simply allow services institutions use daily require it. 

If need vaccine get hired next job, you’re going get one even reluctant. part government needs stop generous covid unemployment. People don’t want work mooch system, means don’t need get vaccinated. Covid infects differently viruses (via ACE2 receptor). symptoms might similar, areas brain affected, causes different. example, one study earlier [found megakaryocytes, aka Bone Marrow Cells, brains COVID patients That's never seen before. lots research needs done, hopefully new treatments help everyone w/ PVF regardless cause. Wait til there's Epsilon variant emerges US understand scholarship different universal free education, right? I’ll frank well without going background. world hard place need look yourself. Staying taking never get easier you’re people abuse you, going change to. trying prevent inevitable places low vaccination rates also mostly places much lower mask adherence first place. Reinstating mask requirements going extremely unlikely point. She’s pediatric dentist. Seems government can’t do. 

These folks nuts. quick realistic way bring back mask mandates cases like grocery stores.

Is actual evidence outbreaks driven brief interactions stores, though? requiring masks certain businesses (like grocery stores), seems likely effect marginal.

We know (from contact tracing) bars restaurants major contributors spread. would right us close down, ruining many lives, mainly help people refuse help themselves?

As long hospital capacity threatened, new restrictions (beyond limited mandated masking, which--who cares?). N95s readily available people cannot get vaccinated vaccine might sarcastic talk people needing vaccinated getting old. Yes that’s clearly best solution going happen?

I would *much* prefer vaccine passports and/or mandates blanket restrictions affect vaccinated. see clear trend though variants becoming slightly infectious, slightly transmissible, slightly better defeating vaccination. Nobody knows, reasonable expect trend continue. 

It's fine decent theory provides optimism, safest pragmatic approach assume clear trends continue ready appropriately adjust. reply fact, yes, hair?

(Your mother's behaviour abusive. hope fine)  don’t see issue waiting 15 days. need to. Watched TV. Check Idiocracy idea Delta variant can't tackled vaccine that's 88% effective wrong. know coke gives electrolytes? never research it. never went 4 year college it. Go argue me.  went go check sick covid us would come back positive. like shield around us randomly cause vaccinated. tests still come back positive even low viral load. yeah 99 people vaccinated ""sick"" virus asymptomatic I'm guessing. cares case? can't spread actually sick. agree solutions, none work.
None least far compliance goes.
Even many people originally followed guidelines gave up. obviously biggest reason CDC giving everyone green light go mask less drop social distancing. Yeah sure honor system, let's real. Like DLC subscription lol go time crowded spaces. Great insurance. wallet back up. Smug non-Southerners pretending shit stink, name iconic duo health..is actually pretty strong.

Debatable, given often highly manipulated. even recognise saying towards Korean Chinese people daily?

I tend think East Asian countries less racist USA simultaneously. spent 15-6 years Korea, I've got hear read fellow Koreans say Japanese especially, Chinese - rivalry (or dislike dare say) ingrained society really bother people whenever say pretty racist things (especially hard right turn Japanese politics 2000s). also reflected systemic racism. know 50 Koreans applied one Japanese college, every one got rejected? 

But less racist America western countries way physically threat you. punch kill Korean Japanese Chinese. Again, East Asian countries tend much safe. pinball geek, headline confused second.    Pfizer/BioNTech surely greater global impact thanks huge manufacturing capacity resources, great another effective vaccine use. Especially impressive since Cuba nowhere near combined resources Pfizer, BioNTech Fosun (together funding got German government EU).

Also, assume Cuba share whatever can, seeing much contributed international medical efforts previously. Exactly. Thank you! This. 8 year old nephew got COVID recently sister brother-in-law law fully vaccinated. never got sick symptoms constantly around him. quarantine prevent spreading others children course. lil nephew got incredibly mild got clear health department everyone unquarantined. terrified tho. poor sister stayed night checking breathing constantly measured temp. still little cough though. saw off, Bugs Bunny style.   Subscription model. idea saying. continue follow guidelines rules. u want guess. shit thing USA get big problem ahead. Delta Plus variant likely become dominant variant needs masks well vaccines. That’s fine. don’t complain many us want stop providing taxpayer provided medical care people won’t both. chose risk tolerance, wallet back up.  quick realistic way bring back mask mandates cases like grocery stores. 

Another possibility somehow ramp testing nearly everyone get tested daily. 

All sarcastic talk people needing vaccinated getting old. Yes that’s clearly best solution going happen? would guessed?! base formula vaccine made different location different name, requires approval. Vaxzevria made SII, even stated article itself. many vaccines Cuba produce year? rather take 93percent 2 shots Vaccine. Still wear mask required. anti mask rather wear choice. sure read Delta Plus, whatever else current switch. Looks like expect thing change-up regular basis.

Remember Reddit experts insisting mutations make viruses less deadly time, Coronavirus error correction would slow mutation negligible concern? go? Interesting. Delta becoming dominant strain? contagious? Cases Portugal less tenth February. vaxxed absolutely fine go. “Public Health England” source news used mask alone 80%+ effective regardless variant simply nature much removes air.

No matter happens terms vaccine efficacy symbiotic viral infection (secondary infections covid like India started seeing), it’s effectiveness doesn’t change since doesn’t discriminate particular particles.  Use real source reputable news agency. place try promote Youtube. Final warning. made week. wrote rewrote reply multiple times. changed tone almost reply. struggled hit send, knowing rarely change someone's opinion internet. proud you. easy face fears, even harder admit fault. Thank much part solution.

Please help friends come conclusion. Everyone sick shit. one wants live Covid world. one wants polarization. Let's end together.

Thank you. hope so. sure would nice they’d release information updated study showing current real world statistics. Haha problem friend. academic history career entirely life science based, really consider development vaccines massive achievement life science world. That's hate subliminal anti-vaccine, doomsday junk I've seeing lately. figured I'd take little bit time set record straight dispel misinformation I've seeing lately. vaccines work. They're effective many scientists good work make sure that.  That’s different producing distributing vaccine. way prevent Yeah I’m looking forward boosters future Dude better pray girl produces children lol. mother daughter ends unable children, would probably kill rip balls something. cannot believe people upvoting Awesome post, thank this! point part planet, variants dangerous... advice would apply country low rates vaccination may also apply country relatively high vaccination rates. tailor advice account countries &lt;1% vaccination countries vaccinated global organization. would say listen CDC state/local health departments advice proceed USA, specific situation country specific certain regions country (because vaccine uptake pretty variable depending USA located). So, masks may needed point Alabama maybe Vermont % vaccinated (just random example, I'm pointing fingers particular places).  See going happen. Ontario going 200 cases daily soon (our peak 4300 April)

So get say 50 case increase due outbreak, headlines read COVID SURGES 50%!!!

50% small number, headlines grab people. Good pointing out. mRNA enough good.

But point Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna arguably best vaccines covid currently exist. really, us strong digital security those. repeat ""the vaccines highly effective"" over, change fact barely half US population even ""half"" vaccinated. 

This like battling opioid crisis repeating ""not using opioids get us this."" strategy.   going rest lives point pandemic become endemic like others, soon thought. 

We're year half thing, pandemics lasted average 4 years Earth. Also less 20 deaths per day last wave seeing upwards 1600. Let's mention either. That's thought Yeah no. Fuck that. Thank Especially since people unwilling take basic precautions experience minor inconvenience. guess phrased way discrepancy vaccination rates South(and Midwestern states) vaccinated areas country.

Not even choosing extreme opposites, like Vermont Mississippi, 35% difference fully vaccinated population, there's definitely bit difference. Even California(~49% fully vaccinated) Georgia(~35%), that's big gap. 

And gap even noticeable look single doses distributed. 60% California least partially vaccinated, versus 42% Georgia.


And concerning thing vaccination distribution divided 2020 party lines, exceptions. tells unlikely FDA approval sway significant number people states, whereas might bring numbers bit states. 
If Trump family getting shot persuade them, kind scary feels like nothing will. universe things pretty normal Ontario right now? Holy shit. Can't wait wear mask outside month nobody Romania wants vaccinated sister’s father law died covid Jakarta. time placed icu, dead. 

Current situation critical. Hospitals full, ppl treated outside, oxygen running low. We’re fucked. 😔  much, what’s variant you? Health Authorities / Governments / Media start explaining difference similarities ""Long Covid"" (LC) Post-Viral Fatigue (PVF) far understand any. 

I doubt sufferers truly struggling treating LC something unique different PVF seems far disengenouse. PVF even one size issue, everyone crippled, cases people recover time. 

We run risk permitting Governments neglect people severe PVF result viral infections. think, epidemiological standpoint (and could wrong), virus deadly (like ebola instance), widespread.

The fact COVID kills 1% people infects is, believe, large part reason able spread throughout world.  using includes children aren’t eligible like Psucadese. Even entire globe vaccinated mutations still happen

That’s nature 

It’s realistic expect people live rest lives fear like go back lockdowns I'll become crazy. can't stand shit anymore tell levels too? Levels important. Ill never forget video... There's ligma greek alphabet, dude... Yes, make assumption underreporting cases also assume underreporting deaths. Social interactions, social cues, conversations, meeting new people, romantic connections, business negotiations, ability identify criminals, probably bunch im forgetting. One major cornerstones human communication making evaluating facial expressions.

Imo using things arguments wear masks limited periods time pandemic dumb, talking masks forever protect general illnesses, dont think reasonable all.

Yes might save lives, could also save lives requiring everyone wear helmet walking street, could save lives outlawing personal automobiles. baseline risk alive everyone needs accept. might get flu, might get car wreck, might slip fall bust head open. Got em people know, worst side effect female collegue (late 20s) dragged low fever week getting J&amp;J.

Everyone else common arm soreness little else. happened awful. hope everyone hygienic respecting personal space coming pandemic. Sputnik turns well variants. 90% Russia hesitant get vaxxed. mean sure prediction low number; might peak last winter large, might think infections begin take vaccinate kids, might something uneven vaccine distribution mentioned above. said: model course wrong.

The important thing vaccinated, well protected. trying convince everyone know vaccinated get shots ASAP die pass disease someone would like vaccinated cannot be. guess, considering I’m expert really don’t know anything. I’d guess vaccines last longer sheer amount spike proteins, natural infection might broader due body antibodies parts virus besides spike protein. Maybe best sentence structure ambiguous me. ""Give us Pfizer, going vaccinate all))""

I hate shit much - educated people know better. government always send mixed signals, they've created reasons people trust them, really people know better. Sputnik perfectly fine vaccine, widely deployed world, tested Russia, safe efficient original Delta (the developers claim ~85% efficiency Delta). Maybe good Holy Pfizer, still much better non-vaccinated all.

It's entirely irrational. search Kovivac vaccine - another Russian vaccine. far fewer research Sputnik, scarcity, many believe better. tell virus stop mutating instead UK Israel, 80% adults vaccinated. Aaaaaand fell it... looking praise something? I’m vaccinated, don’t need one anymore. people don’t wanna get vaccines readily available that’s problem. mom boomer vehemently antivax. got first dose Friday told mom yesterday quit talking 😂. Username checks out, guess. Pay people vaccinate kids kids get it. They're linked - sequence genome every single case Australia, many months now.

This aids contact tracing considerably, get two separate cases confirm they're closely related. Combine epidemiological link (visited hair salon infected worker) there's virtually way came elsewhere.

Covid genuinely circulating Australia outside rare outbreaks. agree, it’s tricky issue. government could consider incentivizing rewarding people get vaccine withholding people dont, like requiring air travel, boat travel, receiving reimbursement government funded services, etc. isn’t completely true. variants show reduced vaccine effectiveness (especially one dose two dose regimen), none evade vaccine immunity entirely. agree ignored, seems bizarre blame ""moving goalpost."" new variant. thing changed. weird like ""well, circumstances different, already declared COVID plan year ago can't update it""? Must nice. Ontario 80% fully vaccinated still wear them. Agreed. yea, I've reading, immunity seems last natural infection vaccine. Though feeling may find vaccines offer longer period immunity.  Ah yes, USA, longer part whole planet. Ligma balls lmao  It’s based rates every country currently vaccinate adult wants them. They’re around 60-75%, less don’t count ones gotten one dose Saw npr well. line speculation vaccines became available MN, starting getting them, CDC quick make statement vaccinated people safe indoors others are. governor soon stated ending state-level mask mandates June (70% vaccinated not). puzzled statements indicating exactly vaccine would protect could still spread virus vaccinated. truth vaccine mean 'you're good pandemic over', simply massive tool work toward ending pandemic. reality still get ill vaccinated, high probability hospitalized dying. also learned later limits chances transmission most-likey. Far facts actually learned digested politicians removing mandates guidelines 'move on'. little alarming IMO. point pay attention World News.   overall message UK Israel pretty positive vaccines 80 percent effective doses. Israel may mean need get kids vaccinated lift mask mandate. 

It important prevent sustained transmission variant (eg case load thousands continue spread vaccinated individuals) produce strong pressure increased immune escape. see happening something need done — booster shot, indoor mask mandate, something. calculating death rate death/cases cases higher drops death rate. pay taxes?

The government told anyone get vaccine. They've begging, telling. Well, US anyway.. Young people still risk. Maybe death, certainly sequelae. Plenty stories healthy young people barely climb set stairs without getting winded, w/ brain fog. 

They still die, too. infect people around them. people low risk, unvaccinated, spread people high risk cannot get vaccinated. difficult concept grasp.  one defiant people. I'm little older teen, got done second year college, towards end got vaccinated could keep qanon cultist grandparents aunt safe since work retail. found somehow, kicked house finals weeks. Thanks guys lol still wear mask go stores. mask doesn’t bother me. I’m fully vaccinated point don’t care others do. mask doesn’t bother me. makes think 1/3ed global population refuse vaccination? data coming from? make up? What's variant?  getting vaccine ultimate example comfortable life. privileged person say, ""no, want it."" Good luck that. Again. Regardless breakthrough cases, almost one sheltering place anymore.

The fact still get sick you’re vaccinated *common sense.* news certainly reason panic. number TINY put context. country relying heavily Sinovac Astra Zeneca, I'd pretty interested seeing data Cuba. Yes is. CDC science lab. arm federal govt managing disease control. job political (political = management society people).

Unfortunately can't stay home. I'm forced back work high risk despite vaccine. Fucked CDC  use argument stay working home Corona Mary gets vax fucks hell off?  big factor poverty 

Although it’s odd richest country one biggest obesity problems. think bigger problem conflicting goals FDA/USDA: (a) ensuring food health &amp; safety, (b) supporting US agriculture. Taxing sugar, regulating use HFCS, reducing subsidies corn, discouraging processed foods, etc, run counter mission promoting US ag ag exports. dislike use “defiant” gives idea kids breaking rules something wrong.

They nothing wrong. dystopian litmus test. Same. People think it’s good vaccine it’s freaking mRNA guess didn’t pay attention bio class flip flopping they’re making decisions based new data? Again? one person. NSW cases stem limo driver. Queensland cases leaked quarantine Alpha variant. there's miner NT caught Brisbane quarantine another traveller spread mine, hundreds workers spread across Australia. three different sources. 

Delta variant R0 5 7, single case become hundreds couple weeks. That’s fair point definitely good argument specifically healthcare workers get shot regardless previous infection. 

Good news natural immunity seems effective vaccines preventing COVID. Obviously nobody know long lasts I’m hoping good news front vaccine make efforts keep shape/boost immune system.

I baffled idea calling gap it’s referring decision participate available preventative healthcare. article shifted thought “the gap”, access, gap choice, less discounted, vaccination status increasingly function free will, risk disease prevalence tracking along that. clear, Bro? Houstonian here. young kid. still treat everything pretty seriously. go office week though relax bit still try wear mask can.  Yeah kind headline that? What's wrong ""new"" someone decide original? Will
Need vaccine booster shots year that’s big deal Ah shit, go again.

Edit: fuck 13 min cool down, made one comment mods. want circumvent paywall, see: Or, website regularly read, think subscribing website. It’s crazy it’s easiest thing put mask on. don’t understand big deal. put fuckin pants leaving house what’s hard wearing mask. 

I bet mandated pants people would probably freak out. sequenced contacts perfect match. transmitted them. CCTV camera evidence good source data comes contact tracing. Maybe interacted somewhere else low probability.

Unfortunately junk really happened, transmitted less 10 seconds. Maybe exceptionally contagious time, none wore masks help either, maybe close breathed breathed out, knows?

I hope unlucky incidence. easy, think would see 35-60% increased attack rate, would see 350% guess. Yup, sitting home reading Reddit Would like speak manager Covid? putting piece “clothing” shopping idea fucking, you’re definitely wrong. Yes, arguments assume covid pandemic issue individual level. point opening sentence. 

I think important question whether COVID pandemic not. Great people spared, course, overall impact globalized society stop global case numbers dramatically reduced.

A building collapse still catastrophe even people saved. say problems. efficacy decrease bit variants, Delta biggest drop efficacy. super vast majority catch covid do, require hospitalization, I'd rather still risk catching covid. I'm concerned long term consequences vaccine. 1.5 years, trial participants definitely followed, blood work, looking patterns things prevalent vaccinated people, seeing that's vaccine related, would heard now. I've seen death suffering covid done. already bad luck virus left permanently injured, messed ear balance system, worry lot covid might body unique immune system makeup. Yes abundant proof much contagious substantial immune evasion. Check data published Public Health England. Thanks. almost back normal end summer. said also deal years trial going take long. hospital went committed extreme number instances malpractice made vaccine side effects exponentially worse nearly killed right well. want past.  Same, don’t want help idiots anymore. Outbreak. It’s already pandemic. Joe mama face masks don’t even work well. cdc came study showed peak pandemic, masks reduced cases 2%. adverts show horrible shit go ICU. It’ll people bothered ‘inconvenience’ see people easier time choosing less inconvenient thing taking precautions getting vaccinated. 

Similar campaigns worked smoking, Covid.  used buy surgical masks Walgreens. wonder influences inventory.. don’t particularly large Asian population still high mask wearing area.. Based reason (it's time public health treated Black Americans callously, famous. Plus bunch reasons tied poverty ruralness race), usually cited significant factor 
  happens hate stupid people so....yay? Call mask safety. dont see problem is. vaccinated believe safe now. live life dont pay attention antivax I’m really sorry must going right now. Best luck, good you. vaccinated? fine. problem thus far fine one going fail could J&amp;J enough data say. far problems. report saw think NYT referred number doctors 60 remember correctly contracted covid fully vaccinated Sinovax believe stated 10 died. I'll try dig article. kids right. Well, them… I'm really sorry. hope better soon! Plus, misleading since case numbers dependent much people testing. know fact tests widely available near beginning pandemic. case count 20 today actually much lower case count 20 year ago. Well, we’ll see happens, suppose. I’ll start panicking feel like need to. wait till Delta Plus variant gets foothold. course do, Covid actually kill them. Deaths lot obvious cases. course going unreported nearly degree. level would looking nearly 3 million excess deaths US. 32% reported persistent symptoms here, details symptoms. one talks long covid asymptomatic infection. wish saved ones read instead upvoting. There's evidence though. People mostly focus possibility death long term effects also scary. Delta Plus include Siri? debate single vaccine not, definition, “anti-vax” movement.

*facepalms* Thanks dude. Things hard wife lately. work cruise industry, it’s last industry yet get back business. 

The Disney Cruise line test cruises next week. I’m crossing fingers we’ll good go I'm glad I'm one noticed agree currently, way. I'm sorry husband. wish anyone. worst part people hate admitting wrong. need teach children humans think avoid baseless conspiracies. ends decide ends. term adopted? tip? Get lube prepare get fucked government virus 99.5%+ survival rate? live country? it’s US. Ya thats unfortunate, much that.

This targeted people sub always spreading misinformation make seem vaccines ineffective, usually using fragmented data, straight lies poor quality sources context. Regardless, you’re vaccinated around well, variant doesn’t pose greater threat you, data shows. evidence J&amp;J effective Delta. enough countries use vaccine us know efficacy. Right, data Israel super confusing, failed mention people FULLY vaxxed (2 doses), asymptomatic etc. would pretty important know🥴 hopefully find soon low numbers still important talking vaccinating children similar probability dying vaccines covid

I'm pretty sure number dead children vaccine much lower (if any). official source saying they're comparable? I’m vaccinated too. I’ve still really vigilant masking sanitizing kid can’t get vax yet. 

I’m also Texas…..so many anti Vaxxers here. highly area-dependant right now. Look stats county get idea community spread. News going focus places outbreaks. 

My partner fully vaccinated, children young. However, feel completely safe going unmasked community spread less 5 per 100,000 per day (for county, would mean 25 cases per day, well weeks now). feel safe going masked community spread less 20 per 100,000 per day. loosely based CDC's travel thresholds, feel like adding last 28 days every day, go per day weekly average.  You’re getting downvoted agree part comes things like alcohol tattoos. comes covid shots specifically though, parents preventing kids getting shot punished. indication Tuskegee significant factor? see might be, people mention asked vaccinated?   Yeah, I'm starting think Corona first types diseases. Every years, another major disease appear. Even putting variants aside. I'm done shit. course people eat headlines decide take drastic measures reason (my family included unfortunately), worry long going take significant chunk people come reality latest data showing vaccinated people spread variant unvaccinated. So, kids employer forcing back office (either literally veiled threats pay cuts) seems kind potential liability reckless behavior. Bottom line: don’t really enough data fully understand delta it’s risks yet. result research results regarding Pfizer efficacy delta variant:

“Delta, first identified India: Real-world data shows vaccines highly effective variant. recent analysis 19,543 people Scotland, Pfizer's vaccine 79 percent effective preventing infection delta variant. Research Public Health England suggests protection may even higher. study, released May 22, found Pfizer's shot 88 percent effective variant two weeks second dose. 
Finally, separate study 14,019 people England found two doses Pfizer's vaccine 96 percent effective preventing hospitalization delta variant. “ What’s disaster messaging? disease evolving messaging correct spreading United States that’s starting change. 

The Delta variant already another variant (Delta +), regardless situation original Delta variant, leaning ever closer vaccine effective due viruses mutate unfortunately disease getting dangerous faster spreading dealt last year half. 

I don’t see doesn’t end another lock despite’s people protest can’t happen again. Seems like it... Everytime close done seems something different warn us really bad say it. Mandate tested developed ones pushing vaccines lockdowns. “Requirement” “government order” anything except words designed elicit opposite effect. ones made better available cloth masks and, opinion, surgical masks. designed approach n95 quality. This. many idiots. ""like"" wearing mask either understand why.

People need understand actual oppression vs minor inconvenience. Montreal's going come back way behind take record Toronto. Eric Ding douche probably smiling ear ear now. new apocalypse threads create twitter Unfortunately, live area less 50% vaccinated. vaccine widely available now, but... ::sigh:: point worry yourself. can't fix stupid. gets sick gets pretty I'll that's choice. Jeez. thing ever over? real idea impact initially asymptomatic covid infections point.  suggesting brain damage occurring large portions infected.  lets get back ""normal"" asap cos...some us getting antsy? question whether vaccines effective. question whether COVID pandemic over. 

Those two statements become tautology enough vaccines everyone wants vaccinated.

The gives global guidance, CDC gives US guidance. US vaccine effective unless injected gigantic fraction world's population. happened yet probably several years.

No, highly effective individual gets vaccinated. Vaccines work individual level, impact scale benefits aggregate too. things inventing vaccine nothing, injecting 10% 20% world's population little.

It drastically changes outcome 10 20%. Yeah, student like this. He’s based personality teenage edge lord, straight said “it would probably smart get it, reputation uphold.” makes sense. trying prevent infections mutations masks would help. Seems like care yourself. Sure, we'll see happens. don’t however need let leave home. remove society. should. Yeah nobody purpose fuck you. nobody learned anything last year half. least vaccinated population masks enough, never convinced anyone wear work chemotherapy time. got ""He's good guy"" ""I breathing issues (now pardon smoke out)"".

I can't imagine go better facing health challenges. severity Beta Gamma ever properly determined? COVID hasn’t stopped all. I’ve public since day one active first responder. 

Having 6 asymptomatic people able spread virus don’t typical self limiting symptoms dangerous. ill, stay home couch rather public spreading crud others don’t know you’re ill. 

So no, won’t staying home myself. feel unwell, absolutely stay home.  use bypass paywalls. Well, two weeks now. That's fully vaccinated.  things mentioned either settled still investigated

So known unknown. settles it. really hard say, seems likely. also think comparing covid flu sort hopeless comparison. Flu dangerous children ~ 16 younger, covid dangerous everyone else. biggest difference however covid probably around 5-6x contagious/infectious flu is, even younger ages covid going kill people going infect more. 

Also, covid sort weird disease initial strain relatively mild compared others similar profile (SARS, MERS, etc) waaaaay contagious. lead believe last June thinking it, covid likely evolve dangerous/deadly rather evolving less dangerous/deadly like many diseases do. reason diseases deadly, start deadly people, causes disease die quickly. covid however, already airborne, limiting factor spreading actually sick makes people since even though spread asymptomatic individuals spread nearly well get sick cough/sneeze/etc. 

This was, is, still biggest reason opening schools in-person classes vaccine available age groups. biggest vector virus population relatively insulated previously (in case, young kids) becomes reliable, wide-spread transmission vector, virus going evolve strains spread efficiently group ones take dominance spread. insanely stupid thing going put bunch kids risk. entirely possible get vaccine rolled becomes seriously dangerous younger age groups, take bet losing serious consequences. 😂😂 Yeah israel fucked, averaging 0 deaths per day. Yes, taken account, admissions deaths lower point previous waves, although first wave modelled due lack testing. take aren’t knowledgeable person 

So, heres Sky News article, easy enough even least aware individuals understand, read get that, maybe you’ll able get PHE data.  kiddo 4. They’re walking Petri dishes IMO, freak well. think social distancing people going much

Less international travel.

Asian countries still get bad flu seasons 

Mask help data CDC sharing 'facts'. might want evaluate numbers Israel UK, two vaccinated nations Earth, declaring 'all numbers going down'. checked like deviated septum?

I made mid 30s anyone freaking told symptoms. *bruh*. 4k smells

Or burnt tf nose ignore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ definitely know I'm sorry deserved break got cut short. We're(in Ohio) pretty untouched delta far, I've enjoyed able take mask relative safety such. Although crowded somewhere, still get complete anxiety crowded room think that's going away anytime soon.

Although I'm ready go back hardcore safety precautions Delta starts rise here, gets really bad again. I'm holding tiny hope doesn't. Go home you’re drunk variants, *all known variants*do pose challenge vaccines. *a lot* data this. Ignoring that, like are, foolish. Yes know. don’t know I’ve ever seen number samples sequenced NYC. I’m sure it’s small it’s likely number samples every week. Better yet, stay strapped yourself. quit Covid, quit got caught affair.

Crossing fingers I'll able go Austria September (they announced they're open vaxxed Americans, we'll see changes delta). guidelines less 9 months since fully vaccinated. They're country I've seen 9 month rule.

I got doses March I'm good September. I'm thinking beyond that....what happens 9 months? us fully vaxxed individuals suddenly become persona non grata? understand boosters *may* necessary, boosters actually become available, 9 month thing surely change, right? Two weeks ago UK SAGE estimate peak current wave exceed 20% peak first winter wave Nov Dec. They've blown well past estimate. No. think will. I've never experience system: prevents moving traveling? get passport? immigration rules target country? share mine Bill Burr's take this. One us!

In recent study England (pre-Delta) tracked secondary attack rates (if get sick, many people spread to), found receiving least one dose reduces risk getting someone else sick 50% - 550,000 residential households UK January March 2021, overall SARS-CoV-2 secondary attack rate 5.7% household index case received least one dose Oxford-AstraZeneca 6.3% households index case received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 21 days testing positive. contrast, overall secondary attack rate households unvaccinated index cases good information know people decide risks want take public family settings. Especially, people families young children cannot vaccinate. gone asking arguments vaccine telling people side effects temporary?

Half *adult* cases vaccinated adults, generally mild/asymptomatic.  half cases adults; rest largely unvaccinated teens.

Context here: people wander around maskless, nothing going on, yes, maybe. otherwise equal social distancing masking, worse last wave imo, but...even 20% peak...would 50-75 thousand cases...per day....which would be....very bad, 5x worse now. 

Also, Gottlieb tends downplay things, model also usually lower actual cases deaths, constantly adjust deaths cases later things get worse. Maybe 25-35% peak, was...the worst corona peak world besides India's recent even half 20% that...would extremely bad, 50-75k per day...would worst numbers world seen...again. thread covid. lots viruses one could catch. yes fucking idiotic say places literally built sick people likely sick people them. Oh agree vaccinated people able go unmasked, think emphasized lot unvaccinated people need keep masking public places mixed crowds. course, real way monitor this, least way Americans would accept, companies ripped mask signs free-for-all.

I personally know unvaccinated people ditched masks, who's going stop them? Nobody. There’s wonderful thing called “data”

Example, 50% infected Israel infected fully vaccinated.

According Public Health Services head Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, Wednesday night 891 people diagnosed coronavirus last month, 50% fully vaccinated. Health Ministry director-general Chezy Levy clarified last 99 infected people age 16 fully vaccinated 39 not.

Scott Gottlieb bit news: world study lancet showing Pfizer vaccine 79% efficacy preventing infection *all* infection (both symptomatic infection) caused PHE data showing protection hospitalization *higher* Delta Alpha, efficacy symptomatic infection 79% *including AZ (which lower efficacy) Pfizer/Moderna remain highly effective Delta. vaccinated, concern you. opinion every reasonable public health expert well, it’s supported robust data. would great misinformation surrounding would stop sub.

All saw making reactionary decision based extremely uneven distribution vaccines worldwide, Israel taking precaution based low amount cases. wish wouldn’t adopted negative term “mandate”. doesn’t help convince people right thing do. is. i’ve following everyday lately people really running getting booster zero official safety data person cat avatar told to. obey rules road. dare tell drive certain speed one direction road. /s Bro talking about?

No work.

People like seem forget perfect example this: stitches.

Stitches remain place fully healed. open stitches, get infection.

So. right thing. Close borders, lockdown, remove oxygen non stop fire.  ivermectin... Yeah that's choice. want protect children they'll deal consequences.   countries required certificate vaccination work/school, I'm pretty sure anti vaxers would second shot didn’t make feel like got hit fucking train dropped 6 story window people would get it. I’ve feeling worse ever years since getting second shot Friday evening.

I understand. moderna second terrible. Sickest I've felt while.

But symptoms, bad are, gone tomorrow.

Covid ruin life. older sister used like that. Really hard core anti-vaxxer. Took almost 20 years finally snapped it. wish knew changed mind close. daughter know vaccinated til 20s promptly went &amp; got taken care got COVID vaccine. Anyway, relate. sister one Y2K people thought would mass hysteria bc computers. bunkered forest tons rice &amp; beans called everyone family say goodbye stand seeing everyone else care. really thought gonna die. said like around dead people. get call. Around 2003 kinda wandered back anti-vaxxer.
So... Yeah. get like think there's anything do. really bizarre feeling called dead person. particular case really, sad getting vaccine dangerous especially new delta strain. empathy family. must awful. analogy somewhat accurate, many, many people anxious afraid, doesn’t sound unusual put like that.   measure wait?

Bookings open 18+ now, appointments far future?

This weekend many vaccination centres walk-in vaccinations, many turned away?

I get article saying, student areas least immunity, really say much extra needed actually finish job (or least satisfy demand). turns manufactured virus, hold people accountable pain suffering caused! Who’s me? totally unacceptable going through. Stay strong!!!

You stop thought process.

This wasnt engineered virus. We've cusp pandemic for, well, century now.

The people hold accountable leadership countries (like USA, Sweden) actively nothing thousands citizens died. already vaccinated almost 24% (according bloomberg) population local vaccines.  This. Sadly, need stop hoping something isn’t going happen, figure minimize damage otherwise. related note, continuing call people stupid isn’t going minimize damage. understand statement? wearing kn95 mask time, protects also prevents spread me.

Maybe thinking masks valves places mask requirement taken seriously allow first place. felt fine shots, zero side effects. Sorry reaction did, it’s universal.  course, measures designed reduce transmission aerosolized virus particles.

I think probably big three things focus are:

* Moving indoor activities outside much possible (easier summer good weather).

* Working hard improving outdoor air exchange indoor spaces things absolutely can't moved outside (an HVAC problem may expensive time-consuming implement). 

* Getting people wear actual N95 hi-fi masks close quarters, rather things like surgical masks cloth masks much.

This would wish list. actually really important appreciate it. Years ago went bout depression turns severely vitamin deficient. take daily recommend everyone brings feeling depressed state consistent least. restrictions since March aint going back. It’s cases airport people infected large numbers people virus airborne. Lol straight talk telling based available data 

You know data says?

The delta variant highly transmissible, concern fully vaccinated. That’s it. That's is. Almost new cases folks vaccinated, alot young folks among them. elderly population already got vaccine. surprise hospitalisations deaths low. course, one forget hospitalisations deaths lag behind infection. even so, bad before. Yeah it’s possibility always remain mystery now. went WFH pretty early weird cold going around office got. It’s possible covid.  may never need masks lockdowns again, may need many times

We may ""need to"" lock many times, never happen. Republican governor ever agree it, lockdowns work states Democratic governors neighbors too.

The CDC took (I think) rather sensible position saying vaccinated, certain things (almost everything) safe, masked unmasked. data supports this. mRNA vaccines, particular, still ~90% effective preventing symptoms delta variant), 96% effective preventing hospitalization, even better preventing death. case fatality rate UK delta variant 0.1%. Fauci, Osterholm, Gottlieb, Jha said CDC's decision right call.

The CDC made individual choice, sort option people decided vaccine passports/mandatory vaccination (which much smaller infringement upon rights lockdowns, might add!). risk cannot vaccinated continue take precautions.  N95s readily available Cases right 10x lower last fall, expected rise, help protect people cannot vaccinated. Hopefully 2 months start vaccinating kids, help even more. could variant super infectious cause serious illness well. end, new variant dominates creates immunity mild infection catch lucky break. SARS indeed disappear own. Viruses high mortality rates successful infecting lot people - like Ebola SARS. 

The main takeaway double vaccinated doctors nurses exposed higher regular viral loads still dont get sick. main fear transmission still dont know much vaccines stop transmission. Dont panic folks. Looks like numbers UK. producing lot data Pfizer, they/Canada employed one shot strategy delayed (by months) second shot. overwhelmed Delta restarting precautions, today.  might become available countries South America places can’t afford vaccines.

Singapore Airport data shows, absolutely can, especially people vaccinated one dose. data also showed significant transmission fully vaccinated cases. reliable contact tracing system results solid.

I doubts full vaccination reduces transmission. question much, esp. Delta variant. Stuff stay open, wear fucking mask slows spread.

I'm fully vaccinated. There's reason wear mask. fully vaccinated people, slow spread meaningful way wear mask.

The spread currently overwhelmingly due unvaccinated people, fully vaccinated people dropping masks.  occasionally compel eat friends faces off, boofing vaccines provides significantly protection delta variant.

Worth it. Would boof again. Saying better get side effects vaccine covid convincing argument me. quarantine time lifestyle. Going groceries walk secluded place.

I expert guess Janssen vaccaine better safer think. ""husband forbid it""

That's man needs good divorcing.

Not terrible decision making, also thinking forbid something. you’re *fully* vaccinated, meaning two weeks past second dose (or first J&amp;J though I’m sure Delta one) no, really don’t worry much.  I’m expecting US try delaying return international travel avoid outbreak Delta (or Delta Plus) big enough warrant major new restrictions. 

A return social distancing US right would fruitless exercise, since states need (I.e Florida, Missouri, Indiana, Georgia etc.) won’t circumstances, serious states like New York Michigan probably enough people vaccinated Fall avoid surge double down, reinstate heavy restrictions. Efficiency*

🤔 enough supply total two dose coverage end July- interesting see, I'd bet Alberta alright. good choice gone great lengths beg AZ there's news stories. find Sarah Moran's story interesting one early examples, 36 needs IVF. worn mask month... seems like old normal me. What's new? Nothing. show something phone safer think that's problem. phone's always anyway. everyone US gets this. something Red Cross doing. Well really want get jab 2 I'm still going think   Yes, boyfriend probably appreciate dry spells though haha get vaccinated protects death. But, what’s moral grounds continuing wear face mask vaccines freely available (where am)? Sincerely asked. obligation save won’t themselves? understand folks cannot vaccinate compromised dealing pandemic way, God bless them, continue way. People lockdown again, simple Hell yeah fkn love cocaine NM I'm pretty sure entire US, ""only"" 3 months leading donation refuse donate principle knowing that. raised differently

I hear time response? mean raised right. may seen right best back things change. grow learn better.

I raised differently, I'd never raise children way. 

Children rights may trust 8 year olds know what's medically best them, actually make informed decisions care greater number teens certainly capable consent immunizations. 66% infected people get PVS, made up. goes far beyond dire bad predictions. Masks forever thing. People need accept now. Hugs. I'm man. want old life back. I'm less hopeful round vaccination enough get us this... Pay attention Alberta... lifting pretty much restrictions July 1st! bogus comment

Cases hospitalizations floor provinces, appreciable growth delta variant. Yeah that’s definition peak here. ditto. need get teeth cleaned eh...no one sees them. mix, seem get all/most back depending severity. However, discovering loss smell comes actual brain damage parts brain senses.  wearing piece cloth face prevent living life? wearing shirt cripple you? sniffing air going tough No. people don’t even feel anything. *gasp* People still potentially spread despite asymptomatic. Wearing mask prevents spread. Hey anti-vax parents, jeopardising kid's health, also robbing childhood.

Teenage angst listening satanic music dropping acid, seeking healthcare, fucking morons. Variants? Like Loki? immune response also causes symptoms, fwiw. feel symptoms despite covid eradicated body, could families immune systems little aggressive. mostly asymptomatic? likely means vaccine something Yeah dating years ago...
It upsetting things changed coworker bedridden 4 weeks still occasional brain fogs 2 months later. Get vaccinated, folks. Crazy anti-vaxxers Yeah well hospital staff beyond done people refuse vaccine catch it. emotional trauma rage covidiots use beds, staff equipment needed problems. “May” isn’t enough detail help modify behavior. Canadian here, despite slow start (which extremely critical of), Canada vaccinated stunningly fast rate. likely exceed 80% uptake higher eligible populations, full two dose coverage expected end July. far, individual provinces, hospital admissions driven ground, many provinces reporting rise admissions number weeks. good chance Canada one vaccinated countries world end July. far, Delta outbreaks suppressed even major cities targeted vaccinations.

Right uptake lower younger population, likely result vaccinations opening later them. I'm judging you. I'm trying give examples demonstrate that, personally, right life-saving vaccines akin rights starve rights sexual orientation. I'm parent lived perspectives teenagers case. late February 2020. Hot coffee still doesn’t taste same. Iced coffee reason taste same. It’s odd thing That’s I’m thinking likely. Wait what??? May ask state? Except 20% young adults Finland gotten one dose.

And change fact could still spread 17% population fully vaccinated. Nope. ACA insurance companies *cannot* that.  one abide another lockdown, rulings would ignored impossible police . 

The majority population double jabbed. Locking kept us safe, jabs keeping us mostly safe fear element gone. restrict business, one stay away friends families now, destroy economy people meet anyway? health minister published data june 17th June 23rd. period 37% covid deaths fully vaccinated sinovac. concerning, however:

-They failed mention age diseased health status

-It's full-on winter here, expected diseases contributed covid's lethality

-it's 6 day period, small draw conclusions


Nevertheless, still bit concerning. guess would expected much less fully vaxxed deaths Lulz, didn’t already false sense security?  Saw coming. Whew, worried he’d mildly annoyed. Concerned huge upgrade.  wait can’t donate inferior lungs? True. 20% common cold cases due general. Every environment different. seen think ""general"" applies people like everyone people like you.

Going eat indoors restaurant vs. eating outside big difference choose one risk lot lower. Wearing mask along vaccination also going keep safer.

Vaccination safe get. still continue reduce risk ways Okay. Thanks. much Whac-a-Mole instead looking crystal ball find one coming get us. Yep. bad can't give 'em Mary Mallon treatment. thought MASK mandate intrusive...  problem wearing mask public (even outdoors) I’m selfish piece shit. unfortunately country (the US) is.

Why correct followed health guidance Fauci CDC 6-9 months ago, say, calling masks, distancing, hand-washing, etc., correct follow people organizations say *if vaccinated* need wear masks, socially distance, etc.? following guidance make us ""selfish pieces shit""?   This. Fuck assholes I'm wondering curevac could trail 3 doses regimen. Maybe better efficiency think rest world going cause Statistically insignificant, accurate. Lmao variant man made drug ramping up? Cuban expats Floridavote GOP petty retributive anti Cuban policies. GOP pro normalization, could lose Florida elections. Imagine living Israel told don’t wear mask indoor 10 days later to

Heaven forbid stay flexible new information available. Every month there's new super deadly mega covid strain we're gonna go back lockdown over, end month clear vaccines still work doctors treat like covid infection. 

By mid July going stop hearing Delta big panic whatever covid special is. would make room new companies report truth  second part post completely agree with. 

As first part post... underlying conditions can't get vaccine need protect (and would wear mask around need be). access vaccine choose take (the vast majority non vaxxed US) need careful understand get covid going rough. I'm point I'm going go way keep safe anymore. part keep safe vaccine something stake: now, health truly choice. get vaccine, fine. Period.

 700 people died delta variant fully vaccinated. Statistically, likely die cow delta variant vaccinated. needs change change stance, right I'm seeing something I'm going change life again. point, recognize statistics compare are. Oh, I'm double vaccinated pfizer quite time now. dislike fact attacking coke True. problems told allowed whether listen not. people Isreal actually got vaccinated accurate. Severe illness much less likely kids. vaccines pass body within days. inactivated vaccines capable causing infection, would seen now.

From I’ve heard, safety trials vaccines faster shorter usual. usually see long immunity vaccine lasts approve it. Since immunity COVID needed short term approved emergency use. Safety issue. Sounds good me. 

I feel bad poor medical workers bust asses idiots choke death ventilators. say thing Moderna Pfizer first released data, prior peer review? data equally impartial. get vaccinated accepted risk. simply nothing do. Less dumbasses going forwarded. Interesting. figure from?    Again, breathing covid. assess viral titers every infected individual. Someone test positive virus, nature PCR tests, transirent titers negligible low, far, far would constitute infection transmissibility. may test positive hour, next hour. HIV example relevant someone life whole life state.

Also, I’m sure you’re aware PCR test pick spot infection viral material many weeks months. consider people infectious?

And I’m sure you’re work covid patients given knowledge relevant experience, research antibiotic resistant bacteria. I’m well aware functionality PCR tests.  I’m concerned realistic solutions. can’t ban private gatherings require masks there. Really best thing require vaccinations check status entry places, neither going happen either. least masking public places it’s easy switch flip.  sure downvoted. clearly informed CDC could relax fully vaccinated. Responding new information (Delta variant) changing behavior back cautious stance makes sense- heck? state actually going reopen 6/30 even though might reach 70% till 4th July. Kate Brown (our governor) announced Friday. Forever 69% It’s option.  stressing take first shot offered.

It’s done based knowledge immune system works vaccines themselves.  may small risk it’s large believe fact repost information already presented I've pinged mod removed post respond modmail. I'm wearing mask fucks decided want get news Facebook take vaccine. people getting vaccinated begin going wearing masks. sure know though, it.

I PhD Biology, want play credentialism games, I'm actually qualified comment most, probably including you.

I know tell you. data showing pfizer vaccine 88% efficacy Delta variant: That's single digit percentage decrease COVID Classic.

And guess what? agencies, also staffed biology PhDs, MDs epidemeologists (like CDC), saying this. Expert agreement always 100%, making appeal authority great argument.

Tell me, point vaccines 88% effective, 96% effective serious hospitalization death, can't get back normal? 

Not mention article talking Russia abysmal vaccination rate second-rate vaccine, yes, need vaccines (in short term) there's way get numbers time.

Yeah, gloom goes around southern states low prevalance Covid too, particularly atlantic coast. midwest appears place country facing upticks moment, everywhere else either dropping still flat.  Yeah I'm Georgia 35% vaccination nearly 100% people Kroger without mask. I'm adding information. Take fewer children sick COVID-19 compared adults, children infected virus causes COVID-19, get sick COVID-19, spread virus causes COVID-19 others. Children, like adults, COVID-19 symptoms (“asymptomatic”) still spread virus children COVID-19 mild symptoms symptoms all. However, children get severely ill COVID-19. might require hospitalization, intensive care, ventilator help breathe. rare cases, might partners investigating rare serious medical condition associated COVID-19 children called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Children (MIS-C). yet know causes MIS-C increased risk developing it.

Walk club street midnight weekend, see they're absolutely banging.

I disagree it. No, perpetuating ""false positive"" narrative. test positive coronavirus, even asymptomatic, need assume infectious quarantine. 

If ""breathing in"" covid could make test positive without infection, people like work around covid day would testing positive every single weekly test lol. work like that. anti-vaxxers going show city hospitals, though, rural areas enough beds. patients decide bankruptcy get medical debt, leaving city hospitals deficits. pink-tinged people mock cities city hospitals, saying *their* area fine clearly urban areas control.

I'm sick shit. Epidemiologists predicting months us 20 40 years. hope December/January got 60% vaccinated, could achieve herd immunity, right variants started emerge. Herd immunity would require 90+% vaccinations, never happen post-Trump world. Thanks, ya dicks.

Now they're predicting Delta variant gonna kick asses fall, wise THEN? Nope, proud. likely, end pockets immunity areas constantly recurring flare-ups. patterns even obvious far, wise THEN? Nope, never happen post-Trump world. live liberal college town 70,000 single case 2+ weeks. Staying bubble much can. mean far simulation, honest truth none less.

My question end ? What’s “safe” environment?….There’s going strains crap foreseeable future… you’re vaccinated you’re protected there’s scientific evidence says otherwise. There’s always health risk somewhere something. 
 
I don’t want “that guy” don’t think people want work least traditional sense they’re using covid avoid it. I’ve watched outside threshold teachers going back classroom got moved numerous times. 

If don’t feel safe classroom it’s time look new line work. Education critical gets great questions reasons upset, none blamed protective device takes almost effort wear, actually helps prevent things you’re justifiably mad about. height summer Delta taken over, particular areas low vaccination rate. kidding me? many industries struggling right stay afloat, especially tourism sectors. 

Like said, developed countries, gotten vaccine can. Thats you. problem restricting entry's based vaccination, corridors need open up. Yes, though tests won’t tell variant  1000 times YES except rare cases. biotech standpoint Russia China much stronger Cuba. Cuba lots free healthcare compared economy much extra money put research. Yes, since May ages 12+ Again, there's choice people here. fine ask me. ""brain damage occurring large portions infected'. ok sir think one them.  Delta going variant hits conservative Qturds rural areas denying COVID exists going ugly. 

I live one areas basically self imposed lockdown foreseeable future nobody (maybe 5%?) wears mask public maintains kind distancing. business usual.

Yes do. even remotely agree think thing. kids forced wear mask school September I'll eat hat. Yes, irresponsible. That's removed clickbait, is. people would describe civil rights movement defiant. used value-neutral term. hit 80% fully vaccinated, think mask mandates thing?  whole thing social media. grey areas anymore comes opinion. saw many times 2016 2020 elections. either believe exactly believe horrible human deserves death threats. goes pandemic. got vaccine think others well, extreme restrictions would never support government forcing people get vaccines want. called murderer views. partly agree that. thing is, Americans low end income earn lot terms purchasing power Americans, say, 100 years ago. American 75th percentile earns lot than, say, Portuguese percentile. deference low income Americans lost cultural memory feed - less countries. folks couldn’t even tell turnip sweet potato, much less one. live Asia low income folks buy cheap produce wet markets. must well 50 different cabbages, mushrooms, tubers, fruits. People can’t afford beef, know work cheaper ingredients. I’m also struck way American cooks cheap eats limited skill level. It’s mostly short-order burgers, fried eggs, BLTs, etc - things anyone could learn afternoon. Whereas Portuguese cheap eats variety complexity regional styles typical cook. skill level much higher, reflects population skilled overall regardless income. “food deserts” low income American neighbourhoods due lack demand, inability supply. 

To clear: obesity universal problem, countries like UK 5 years “behind” US. plenty sugar-rich countries worse US (eg México, Kuwait, Indonesia, Fiji, etc). Everyone slowly losing cultural knowledge feed themselves, mostly processed food cheap, poorly regulated, ubiquitous. No, taking painkiller sort vaccination affect vaccine. know also stay body, around year, long term testing, cause heart problems?

Hopefully govt leaders learned something prevent another wave. less scary sounds vaccinated unvaccinated people Israel.

“When asked many new coronavirus patients vaccinated, Levy said ""We're looking rate 40 50 percent,"" said figure concerning.” posted article clarified misinformation included:

I got it, ended hospital. One nurses it, said mild cold.  bring Martial Law. hair. medical health public health middle pandemic. Vaxzevria vaccine, Astrazeneca. SII facilities made approved EMA, mostly never sought approval doses never meant distributed there.

If anyone remembers goal EU's facility raid months ago 'millions hidden doses' found, many SII, fully declared. I'm haha. pandemic blows. lot pain hope amounts better prep next one. reap sow. 95% Efficacy means risk getting Covid reduced 95%. Simple. know didn’t ask, might want look vaccine efficacy delta variant j&amp;j Pfizer. understanding Pfizer provides protection overall (79-88% delta), J&amp;J around 60% (correct wrong going memory, believe around 60%). 

Sorry can’t help regarding side effects, tell know multiple older people 65+ Pfizer reported little side effects. tested positive covid past, might get stronger immune response thus side effects, nothing severe (worst body aches chills fatigue potential fever). public health issue many teenagers (and many adults) equipped decide own. far many sources fake information there.  
I personally would used wording Lyllytas did, make final decisions kids' medical health adults. would assumed control child. entirely, killing keeps human focus much much lower.

Anecdotal evidence: ""“scarily fleeting” encounters roughly five 10 seconds people walking past other""

Maybe irresponsible sentences next may imply related. otherwise, news article reporting events happened. **WILL** BE. many people hospitalized though indoor mask requirement 2 days ago. way fully stop mutations globally mandate vaccination actually carry vaccinations quickly enough. never going happen.

Scotland study states vax 79% protection delta BIT concerned (for elderly fully vaxxed family members), hoping vaccine effectiveness similar alpha delta. I’ll feel better even data comes regarding hospitalizations/delta/fully vaxxed.

No. I'm saying approach virus decimate stupid. I'm saying one approach better another know, I'm epidemiologist. Thanks keyboard warrior, appreciate advice. 

I certainly feel red-pilled. 

You leave stuff professionals. one using yeast express protein, Cuba would mind manufacturing countries

Also tranditional aluminum adjuvant, patent wall Nothing like wiping portion future generation current one exist without masks caring others right? Pharmacies grocery stores Walmarts still pharmacies.

This whole ""places sell cold flu medication likely people cold flu them"" thing really weird hill die on, you. Funny anti vaxx propaganda Russia pushes west hurt Russia most... least terms % vaccinated. Also, Russia's infection death numbers total lies - official death toll like 125k reality well 400k 500k now. People wear masks get vaccinated. really sucks vulnerable I'm tired entitled opinion *I* live bubble. protect them.

I got 2 Pfizer shots scheduled get recommended boosters. I'll wear mask places request it. I'll diligent calling working I'm sick. 

That's it, though. continue living abnormal lifestyle handful people feel normal. care, even people care. 

It's worth it. Vulnerable people still continue order takeout, delivery, curbside pickup. one forcing attend weddings funerals, many work home opportunities exist now. 

The medically vulnerable probably much lower risk stupid today. There's good data PPE behaviors effective, something stupid pay much attention to. notice way always select people posting articles commenting sort junk, despite overwhelming evidence contrary.

It really seem point, many people still post comment completely irrational obsession/fear covid point cannot rationalize notion negligible, acceptable amount risk is, covert anti-vaxxers, people extremely adverse social interaction/leaving homes desperately trying find ways justify it, nihilist/doomsday/misanthropic individuals.   probably wearing masks next year way virus acting considered defiant lot simply different interests parents.

I got literally told problem…

I literally family. therapy long time. Oh yeah, sorry. Thank pointing out! That's true, J&amp;J trial run South Africa time variant circulating. since around 3 months started. waiting decent vaccination rate younger age groups.

Everyone know age bracket first dose given Pfizer. booked vaccination friend slot next day. idea Australia model works long term. Getting vaccinated prevent virus spreading, seen current UK case. Let's say vaccinate 70% population, rest want it. What's next? let loose ravage rest 30% country, case numbers never seen before? continue strict lockdowns community spread, long 5 years?

In Europe vaccinated everyone wanted, probably let loose bad previous waves. honest barely contained before, much change regard.  3 hours discussion :(… guess good thing virus finally behind us know us Curse you, defiant teenagers! post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

It seems like Beta contagious, unable spread exponentially ""light lockdown"" conditions. also fully vaccine evading, okay-ish vaccination rate, fails spread – even pretty mild measures remaining. Makes sense.

The vaccines something like 80% protection new Delta Variant. There's always risk 20%.

But risk severe enough symptoms get hospitalised around 4%. 

In UK 10% hospital admissions Delta Variant fully vaccinated, two thirds patients unvaccinated, ineligible (so mostly young people). 

And deaths patients age 50 fully vaccinated.

Proof despite country largely reopened, cases dropped.

Even vaccinate 70% country here, still leaves much Europe Asia unvaccinated. CDC acknowledged fact - albeit public transportation despite allowed wear one almost anywhere else. timing announcement political like suggested - could still right call.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Really? Non friends got covid problems except minor change smell. seen mid thirties anti vaxxers, think not. yesterday, urged everyone resume mask-wearing social distancing. think find CDC given bad advice yet again, though hope wrong.

I continuing wear mask indoor spaces crowded outdoor ones time being. me, like continuing wear seatbelt even got car airbags. harm done, hopefully good.

By way, different kinds masks. ""Surgical"" regular cloth masks heck lot protect airborne viral particles exhaled others, N95 masks do. Wearing latter something feel comfortable crowded indoor spaces, regardless whether people wearing masks not. CDC made decision based evidence vaccines US protect Delta. Nothing changed since then, protected. people seem think end goal eradicate Covid. way - least short term. That’s vaccine 100% effective. that, virus circulating year globally.

Even got every single last person vaccinated domestically, there’s still many countries haven’t vaccinated anywhere close level been. That’s problem right there. certain point, accept certain level risk live lives many Americans across country doing.

really ? variant increasingly becoming vaccine resistant

There sign vaccine resistant variants. Anti Vax boomer thing. among supportive group 85% support. Gen Z twice likely Anti-Vax even would make worth getting vaccine mask go eat go drinks friends? see another friend smile? also challenge try wearing mask 95° 100% humidity amusement park. want die. mask nothing like t-shirt suggest disingenuous. Wowzer. Shouldn’t everyone tested heavily though? Seems extremely presumptuous towards community people necessarily players sex fiends, regular people ‘more diverse’ sexuality. saying. Seems bit biased me. Thanks explaining though. ""Polio Pioneer,"" one guinea pigs testing Salk vaccine. got it, placebo. kid neighborhood polio.

Obviously, I'm big fan vaccines. anti-vaxxers idiots. Sinus infections, too. sick three weeks last month sinus infection (no, Covid).   Mysoginy get downvoted. U.S. vaccinated unevenly.

Predominantly ""blue"" cities sky high vaccination rates. 

Predominantly ""red"" rural areas low vaccination rates.

Delta going hit cities hard, people living going continue live normal.

Delta going ravage countryside, people living oppose restrictions reasons opposed vaccination, people also going continue live normal.

We'll see goes. Experts seem universally believe another peak late summer/early fall *and* peak roughly 20% last fall/winter. Went pub weekend. number blokes still nort washing hands disgusting. co worker saying much same, yet dude like month Covid, still 100%. Wears mask religiously though. UK. generating narrative 'we're still safe'. us taken year, wore masks, put health line jobs got shots, line told. We've done everything supposed to, might wear masks protect people wear anyway. 

The facts covid vaccine incredibly effective delta variant, got shots much going fine. Greece make better winter vacation flee snow instead sweating summer?  millennial. [This still relevant times come. effective attaching human cells researchers said spike proteins result natural selection genetic anything scientists could Another someone seeking engineer new coronavirus Louis Pasteur. Born 19th century. Made vaccines, found good. Thousands people him, investigating field.

Millions people meantime vaccinated living quite longer before.

Thousands self researchers go flat earth 5g,vaccines microchips injected.

There nothing research, discuss underlying tech created years. like took month paint painting develop paint taken decades. one thing observed people got infection first wave August September get infected second wave supposed Delta variant. risk death isn’t risk long covid unknown long term effects. Covid could take sense smell destroy kidney you’d still live. stupid, nasty, baseless comment.

I'm front line boomer, every peer know get vaccine fast enough. Tell 26 year old friend stroke one week diagnosed COVID personal family history stroke, pre-existing conditions, vaccinated time. 

Also tell 33 year old friend hospitalized stroke like symptoms two months COVID due inflammation brain known cause prior history. 

Oh tell 29 year old patient prior history illness hospitalization ended ventilator two weeks barely survived due COVID. physical therapy due muscle loss. 

Tell 29 year old marine veteran pre-existing conditions hospitalized two weeks requiring 15L per minute oxygen. 

I could go hours I’m people personally know took care nurse peak COVID. please, go tell dangerous is. I’m sure hours hours experience dealing sort thing. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* OK, English first language, pretty much telling. can't since knowledge. go listen epidemiologists tells vaccines good, nice guy France figured XIX century.

I'm sorry putting clearly. is: darn freck 'investigate' 'research' formal education field. Granted, geniuses *made* formal education nowadays (or used to/should be), asking reddit.... surprise: n guy :)

So... Leave coke alone. gives me.... Electrolytes! Beta actually escape, Qatar data showing 75 percent effectiveness compared 80 percent Delta. However Delta infectious. 

As world becomes vaccinated though future variant likely emerge able bust vaccine demonstrate sustained transmission. It’s weird didn’t even think vaccine found first one. concerned (it’s someone close me), happened someone else kind know like, wait minute, fuck kind coincidence this? thing think allergy. know it, 13 remember.

I think bigger concern precedent sets. children allowed make medical decisions solo? capable informed consent? They're lying probably. I'd shocked get approval people find another excuse. half still get long covid. Death isn’t risk. Vascular organ damage risks too. Plus might long term effects don’t know effects could flare later life like chicken pox shingles. 

Everyone get vaccine unless they’re immunocompromised. Kids disobey stupid parents here.   It’s late outside schools employers requiring vaccine. 2022 

By end 2022 may herd immunity COVID may forgotten already. 

Let's see happens COVID first implement authoritarian nightmare I'm certain abused misused governments.  Efficacy* good. vaccination opened 18yrs?  sure J&amp;J specifically, general side effects worse younger robust immune system is. None 60+ people know side effects. haven’t found credible since January 2020. information  *always* spreading misinformation sub, **is research**

CCTV camera footage PEER REVIEWED DATA. Data indicates delta ta secondary attack rate 35% greater relative Alpha, according latest PHE data. irrelevant, fear mongering article based zero scientifically valid data.

I implore stop posting spreading junk. It’s quickly turning anti vaccine, fear mongering propaganda. No. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED Idk daughter getting info obviously wasn’t me. She’s 19, longer ‘make her’ get vaccine. became open 18+ urged make appointment. I’ve vaccinated since March. said would never did. Finally enough. One day work, asked pick Chik-Fil-A. asked made appointment. said would. said couldn’t bothered get vaccinated couldn’t bothered pick food. said ‘you can’t make get it’. said ‘no, don’t help ways either. ‘ $10 here, $20 there, pick food, etc. 5 minutes later got screen shot appointment. Lol complain hard ""precautions"" ""lockdowns"" US can't even compared countries got shit together bit get off-topic, also seems heavy overlap people taking action COVID people opposed anything address climate change. might deal consequences, 23 year old will. look they're looking me? everyone developed nation seem be, us USA. hospitals started get overwhelmed deaths went up, many people said faked scare people. Indoors crowded outdoor places masks help. Outside general limited need mask possible hold 2 meters distance. tottering edge relaxed COVID-cautiousness. think I'll put change pause bit longer know Delta variant going play out, especially areas low vaccination rates.  Haha fuck article… even read first sentence title?  checked...he went Bay Area Montreal. bro LMFAOOOOOO feel preventing child getting life saving vaccinations purpose considered child abuse. hear saying, hate go there. Empowering state and/or corporations forcibly inject chemicals everyone's body seems like horrible power place (what's next thing inject?), something that's going really infuriate people worried government/corporate overreach already (in many cases good reason). 

The covid vaccine would become vastly politicized already is, become rallying cry big chunk population either genuinely worried sees political power trying exploit it. decision making process strange adherence cult mentality... chances probably higher think. chance getting sick vaccine much much lower? know breakthrough cases delta variant, pure risk spreading (considering risk contraction first place low) lowered 50%. 

Plus, community spread places almost nonexistent now. county (population 550,000) fewer 15 new cases day week now. Probably NY CA lockdown again, though rest US probably not. Europe could potentially see lockdowns again, though probably localized last year testing possible figure small area lockdown rather whole country. That's ignoring social factor though. virus deadly, even long incubation period, people would take precautions, would stopped sooner. member dental field, also likely lose job. would think recirculated air environment, combined lack masks higher viral load delta variant would mean particles potentially larger droplets would linger air longer. fleeting passerby could’ve potentially inhaled significant amounts viral droplets he/she walked traced footpath carrier was. Officials Germany assume need vaccination rate 90% + eliminate delta. country ever reach this, point wait everyone get vaccine offer let natural selection decimate stupid. US death rate went people protesting state capitals, armed automatic rifles, threatening shoot legislature unless mandates restrictions repealed could go Denny's.  

Public sentiment useful non-radicalized environments. we're opening based Alpha. I’m vaccinated, mask inferior that. mean, could go back 300k cases day everybody wearing masks that’s really want teacher OH&amp;S commitee(which imagine local version OSHA) ruled measures taken workplace follow government regulations sufficient making work safe. teacher submit work refusal mostly based high community transmission fact students returning school sent home sympyoms without tested. committee voted grounds refusal oh&amp;s worker came said school following government required work unreasonably unsafe. I'm sure different everywhere, imagine similar ruling would apply offices, unfortunately. read article WHOs fault. vaccine 90% effective protecting Delta variant cases dropping everywhere. Ignore fear mongering live life. Law. Call law people know don’t wear they’re breaking law Anything lowers viral load good thing. Even get delta variant mask less severe. still injured car crash even you’re wearing seatbelt airbag, difference make? don’t want wear mask. I’ll wear it’s necessary. 

I’m vaccinated. It’s necessary wear one. still funny? People simply aren’t convinced Covid kill them, especially people 20s-30s statistically unlikely even hospitalize them. fight Covid really hurt rush back office work, sometimes coupled threats, Delta variants running rampant USA. crazy quick exposure result illness. Goodness. Yep. I’m Georgia. Outside metro areas vaccine hesitant/refusers make large percentage people. There’s little done convince them. You’re fully vaccinated? correct, common bad faith posts conveniently leave 80% Israeli adults fully vaccinated. base rate tilted significantly toward vaccinated populace data coming Israel actually reinforcing vaccines working real world--even Delta--about well previously thought.

As fun analogy: know 90% cancer patients right handed? guess far safer left handed, right?!  Guys. It’s US. minimal breakthrough deaths. don’t really care anti vaxxers die I’m wearing mask again. Let fucking die.  Feels like ferris wheel Fucking covid man    Fucking headlines going click. still carrier vaccinated, so… difference make od population vaccinated, cases matter hospitalization. US go by. Vaccines stop contracting covid. stop serious infections keep viral load low. can't really infect others, especially vaccinated. I'm fully vaccinated followed every rule. spreading virus. I'm going go wear mask show else call though? ""Requirement"" sound better, can't call ""Recommendation"" going enforced   hospitals low-vaccine-uptake area fill, patients sent high-vaccine-uptake area hospitals, reducing capacity respond populations' needs. hypothetical, happening *today* Colorado Delta outbreaks rural counties sent COVID patients Denver. 

Regional, national, *global* infrastructure designed efficiently re-route around places based upon vaccine hesitancy -- supply chain issues earlier waves proven this. auto industry's current manufacturing problems visible, perhaps, dozens industries effected. 

The US longer global leader vaccinations, slipping list passing hour. 

There need panic, *pressing* need make implement plan.  New Brunswick here-we’ve strictest policies Canada pandemic, vaccination rates climbing every day, seems like it’s paying off!  Mass compliance infinite resource. gave year's worth squandered it. I'll take vax boosters problem, pressure private business require blockchain-verified vax status enter maskless. rest Midwest suggests Missouri part Midwest. south mason dixon line. know something called natural immunity due previous infections. Vaccinations thing causing numbers drop. Say 50% get vaccinated 30% limits infections significantly cut transmission rates. India 5% infections second wave people reinfected delta. low. numbers trending downwards *just about* everywhere (assuming US). Two dose vaccines “highly effective” Delta Bay Area public health doc quoted saying fully vaccinated fine unvaccinated “hosed”.  vaccine isn’t 100% it’s much better unvaccinated beast. may think booster 1-dose J&amp;J. right bigots too... willing help community contributing herd immunity allowing covid continue mutate think amazingly selfish shallow think good way filter types people life. Could explain again? get vaccinated risk not, say, 5%. room 100 fully vaccinated people, 5 test positive (but may symptomatic asymptotic). LMAO @ ""Corona Mary"" really tho. They’re still gonna happen they’ll eventually get here. International Air travel global trade spread new mutations everywhere since happens daily basis, there’s much else still get covid vaccinated mot serious symptoms death, also report talking places Chinese Russian vaccines. effective variations. Moderna, Pfizer vaccines problems also J&amp;J either. would socialize them. Doesn’t make sense one bit. got safe covered. people right make choice whether want protect not. Thank this. sub recently become cesspool due misinformation. Get vaccine live life. point deserve it. checked mistress aight, solid 7/10 worthy affair. dude low standards tell. told wipe hands using restroom too. get it... things ""I know what's going happen 5 years""

... think we're going see steady-state covid infections. model infinite series there's near 100% chance 5-10 years they're going catch covid massive health implications. complex. 

Tell obese person stop drinking coca cola red bull cure knee pain, laugh ignore you. 

Tell stop eating farmer John's sausage links (including kids) - may get annoyed ignore you. 

This virus fucks weak. Weak mean dumb able lift 50 lbs box. 

My mom used weigh almost 500 lbs point 200 lbs able survive pandemic continued working before. 

I'm 33 feel like shit. working out, eating like shit. Eating like shit = average American diet, sorts cultures - European, Latino, African, Indian, Asian on. I'm grateful impacted covid need turn around soon. 

I'm CONSCIOUS life.  Yeah efficacy rates getting versus getting it. instances 'getting it' same.

Pretty much low efficacy vaccines still high (in 90-100% range) preventing serious illness/hospitalizations death. yeah, half people getting vaccines may still get virus, vaccines reduce chances becoming seriously ill dying almost nothing.  Oh agree. I'm one people stood antimasker rally gave everyone two middle fingers. Latest figure 43% dead doses. kind makes sense: still older people dying covid, older people double vaccinated quite now. Caveat: still small numbers. growing.  Thanks. try! I’m she’s got it’s difficult road. think cared less basically corona free while.  US even minors given right part privacy aspect matter health insurance. part minors parents' insurance, procedure/vaccination run insurance parents recieve itemized copy bill telling exactly done. see you’re doing. I’m 42 years old never wore mask public, I’m sure never either, Covid started. won’t future. flu, probably won’t going out.  50% infected Israel infected fully vaccinated.

Problem americans basically statistically illiterate read ""50% vaccinated get COVID anyway"". Exactly. live TX governor basically said ""we're leaving individual responsibility."" anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers cheered said ""he's finally side."" seem forget individual responsibility point means going get sick possibly die (or end long term health issues) vaccinated. absolved responsibility point. get sick die, say ""not fault...we left individual protect themselves.""  don’t care point. sympathy me. chance prove failed. South literally embarrassment US. I’m flying next month definitely wearing disposable paper mask. vaccinated great. good parent. How? That's abysmally low. What? No, enough virus system test positive, virus replicated inside body ie acutely ill covid.

People get ill vaccination lower viral load (the virus replicating effectively antibodies stopping it), less severe symptoms, shorter duration illness. factors, less likely unvaccinated ill person spread virus others. course less likely become ill first place. remember naive notion plainly get ""two America's"" (heavily vaccinated pockets living almost normal lives vs unvaccinated areas massive amounts sick people) reality finally sink people right thing get jabs.

But we're partisan living other's echo chambers, message get through. I'm sure someone accuse echo chamber, that, believe sick/dying people truth rise partisan thinking. alas... happen.

The unvaccinated keep spreading back forth create variants eventually break current vaccines. Boosters possibility course, it'll take months roll out.

I've fortunate enough live heavily vaccinated area, enjoyed feeling safe bars restaurants, can't shake feeling going slide back real soon. legitimate exception I’m fully support bending backwards people. It’s Karens dropped Highschool think smarter actual experts … don’t actively wish harm death on, also don’t think going way help people taking seriously. Especially say shit like “I don’t need vaccine immune system.” Well ok then, good luck that.  ...and theeeeeese people wearing mask protect Delta variant steamrolls unvaccinated fall.... Nearly-expired vaccines still good. batch expiration date later seen actively used Israel.  I'm saying average anything. uncommon   Ditto. I'm asusming mid 30s? Covd hit hard? I'm vaxxed lot relaxed did/didn't mask. Delta strain got nervous, masked again! Darwin enters game bring doom  article explains, worrying sounds. still mostly older people dying. since older people basically vaccinated UK, means vaccinated people die. mean... going disease free forever. get cold flu future need go out, mask up? Sounds good. wish didn’t wear one all. want something less obtrusive possible. I’m worried.  really followed enforced unless like insane party. Well they’re still stupid deserve called that. South Korea? Mine SK... Don’t know guys constant fear mongering people pop anytime sliver bad news potentially bad news gets old. you’re vaccinated - don’t afraid live life. don’t mean rude anything, it’s CDC says safe. vaccinated Pfizer go restaurants, theaters... zip code pretty good mask adherence (when requirements place) also vaccination rates lower parts county. mask mandate would definitely help governor state made illegal local officials put one place. Individual stores could course put mask requirements back place doubt happen. *hmm*

It's easy 92% efficacy pandemic almost over. I'd use N95 mask fly vs cloth. Yeah, may actually cause bit problem. There's stories NL KLM flight attendants got Janssen US layovers (back still severe shortage here), able register green pass system. actual issue.  area one those. Vaccination rate abt 26% rural counties. clinic already busy last June hospitals saying full January, numbers highest. Every nurse know talking walking out. burnt out. couple surprising statements there. know sure delta causes severe disease?

Scottish study says Delta causes hospitalizations: Oh yeah, would get 2nd shot regardless mind it’s choice getting getting 2nd shot choice getting 2nd shot getting real thing eventually.  correct. timing interesting though, 4th july tends fill hospitals people fuck around fireworks drunk.  
Plus record heat driving people indoors know PNW ain't built lot central air/good ventilation. Covid seems getting opportunities go round it.   assure population would follow another mask mandate. People it. UK people fully vaccinated two doses though? Everything I've read says different strategy states. Yeah, could live that, especially concerns private property.   completely unaware PVF whole ordeal. Wonder people aware, going forward. No, inactivated vaccines ""worse"". Even worst vaccines would end pandemic month could dose everyone, though. weaker vaccines much less sterilizing immunity vaccinated sometimes still transmit virus (and delta effect magnified happens mrna too). Going take while. world falling apart many things put hold trying save nation. United States falling apart. Public Health Services head Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, Wednesday night 891 people diagnosed coronavirus last month, 50% fully vaccinated. Health Ministry director-general Chezy Levy clarified last 99 infected people age 16 fully vaccinated 39 not.

I dont understand numbers consistent mention after? Shouldnt infections fully vaccinated much lower? misreading numbers? Sorry idiot question  way definitively say that.

And yet, stop either.  thought plain old Delta bad.  get Delta Plus!  New, improved formula! Improved killing machine. call smarpid.   Yes. officially, jury still came jump idiocy conclusions. Personally trust corporate brands, make scratch. way know sure.   link numbers? states less one percent die fully vaccinated. Masks invulnerability shields. try putting mask 10 month old. say leave let great god Darwin settle things out. Well, there's still dual citizens may vaccinated countries. would work btw?"
