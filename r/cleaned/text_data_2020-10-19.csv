(This still theory, btw; need testing.) 

I hoping something could protect ourselves, it‚Äôs (possible) measure infected diminish contagion. Victorian love American pervision freedom, believe freedom accountability government democratic action make sure support interests, Daniel Andrews done media conference everyday past months, started independent enquiry pandemic response, seeked parliamentary approval certain lockdown powers. Freedom individualistic American conception government action infringes rights, health group important consideration ignored bc individuals think freedom means whatever want without consequence, support conception freedom drunk driving immoral, smoking hospitals immoral.

Its tough time decisions tough. think cases pop city everyone change behavior real quick. live WA currently feels like COVID exist remember back March/April felt like nuclear holocaust something place DEAD, people saw super paranoid keeping distance etc even masks pretty common. 

I also hope future cases start popping cities lock roads earlier keep city, Melbourne could locked stopped getting regional VIC. WA locked road network 20-30 new cases per day kept Perth, literally leave Perth unless essential purposes, fizzled super quick never got regional areas one exception small outbreak Kimberly due someone bringing NT. requirement understanding global economy vote, become president matter. Also fact replied comment makes think truth it. pure nonsense would replied would keep scrolling. good day! :) Good! Modern trains good air conditioning systems temperature controls either windows good windows. Let‚Äôs follow Laos then, even better New Zealand. 350,000+ signatures, plus one me. least looks like finally fixed website's flaws. know KRudd moments, goddamn miss PM. hell outside weather? specific weather mentioned that‚Äôs -87¬∞ F, far range safe humans exist in. you‚Äôre realistically caught weather (which doubt really are) you‚Äôd better taking shelter ASAP die hypothermia. literally almost exact thing happened me. almost never enough room it‚Äôs well ventilated. That‚Äôs problem. Screens probably won‚Äôt help much. really wearing masks. Restaurants bars biggest contributor starting new infection clusters. really shut bars reduce capacity table size restaurants. Sweden supposed big personal responsibility? Surely trust citizens learn use mask properly then. can't ways you? think blessing children asymptomatic. Consider alternative. worries. Also I'd point UK first publicise challenge trials - say done China were, meet accepted ethics standards. UK ""typically slow"" respect all. Lmao that's locked Oops sorry meant positive. Deleted minus. Depends interpret excess deaths define ‚Äúpreventable‚Äù deaths. Given deaths occur continuum, positive excess deaths one period must followed negative excess deaths absent permanent structural improvement mortality rate.

Given know spread Covid Sweden (i.e. spread aged care homes). likely occurred bringing forward deaths near future April/May. 

A similar effect currently seen US recording coronavirus deaths 3k-5k per week excess deaths slightly average trending since peak. matter time excess deaths US turn negative. Gonna people actually read articles chugging mouthwash Sorry, can't hear freedom lack cases state due people actually following advice. wearing soon Sweden. wait

Lol people saying since april.

Any time now... lessons U.S. learn? Don‚Äôt vote guy called hoax still denial even caused super spreader event family contracted virus. Don‚Äôt vote guy still plan openly shits scientists. Thanks explanation üòä üëçüèª Try 8 months! Everytime we've hit target reduction daily cases turn reduction restrictions, goals get extended restrictions remain. think worry eating ordering food solely due transmission employee sneezing food wiping runny nose etc.? people dont wear masks buses city probably try stab throw off. Yes packing bars restaurants wearing masks whenever possible. wearing soon Sweden. wait Sorry Homer, work invite in. problem course.

Shops use distancing staff well, screens toward customers.

Offices, many less crowded least people work employer make sure enough room. 

Collective transport, that's one areas totally agree you. crowdy hours people wear masks there.

I think FHM:s monitoring situation tracing showed large amount cases environment would take action. Amen Tough man. rooms booked hotel could coherently explain mask policy pulled them. Ended rebooking motel style hotel worked out. There's got economic benefit following guidelines, clearly also loss. Whatever. worked spain france.  that's learnt wonder country fucked. Yeah, noticed numbers hospital lot higher UK's. numbers level UK st April. UK increasing patients hospital every week though. I‚Äôve trouble believing seems like smug explanation, past year/4 years things really wore but...seemingly contrarian strong motivating factor people Uncontrolled diabetes age body ten times faster normal. Sand paper blood. cut infection servers. It‚Äôs absolutely working practice. servers restaurants, people buses, workers stores wearing masks. Restaurants reduced capacity. Bars shut. get infections control. That‚Äôs works Rest world: YEAH DUH! Free die preventable disease. **YAY** Boo hoo. Read ignore science. love mask nose bit. That‚Äôs probably infuriating mask. couple dozen reinfections 40 million cases y‚Äôall act like it‚Äôs like 90 percent chance you‚Äôll get again. caught back May happily living life going bars friends also caught awhile back. I‚Äôm living like hermit vaccine comes out. r/agedlikemilk We're going contact shit it.

I genuinely think going hang around like 5 years, ever completely go away. I'm saying practice herd immunity, COVID one long game catch destined lose.

People simply going able wait thing out. 40 million people infected. like 8 billion people here. live part state. locally, many problems. local hospital full capacity (I think), talked one person know either gotten sick enough admitted, known someone died. Everyone among conversations either quarantined known someone get quarantined. Also every local hospital capable care covid patients, get sent larger hospitals counties away.

I quarantined past. affecting elderly nursing homes so, community whole still argues effectiveness masks complains mask mandate. argued daily pretty much given commonplace. Yet would guess roughly 40% people wear mask Walmart. 

It's aggravating fuck watch happen. pandemic hit smaller towns ""first wave"" over. Even hit hard. country seemed improve, covid snuck smaller communities. really seem affect elderly. weird consensus problems big cities like NYC, even Kansas City Denver matter. level partially true. problems, shit gets blamed many excuses. Rather take seriously, many people choose blame others causing spread virus. think one know got sick, won't. get pissed great grandma dies. become hypocrite blame worker nursing home wearing mask exposing relatives, wear mask first place.

I probably could explained better, go. Sorry wall text. roommate literally invites friends decides mask wearing doesn‚Äôt matter inside. need new place live! leads us back question -- really ""too expensive"" eliminate virus? Given cost ""living it"" be.

Also, expensive who, going pay cost? comment sums r/coronavirus pretty well haha people think that's serious doomed. People get things blame this. Lol, seriously believe you? People speak government ""President Life"" disappear never heard again. Wake up.  Christ, voice reason speaks. THANK SMART. I've distancing wearing masks start people give shit it. awful, right thing do.

But that's test we're going through, it? still right thing even suffer it?

Thank right thing. Links:  Great study. Everyone sub likely choose simply ignore conflicts beliefs want admit wrong. peronist always lie 2018 handcuffed 15 year spat police officer Melbourne Australia, female officer punched face directly after. police said complaint made

2019 man punched face confronting said almost ran car. smacked head skateboard, buddies chased around shopping center after. Cops wanted charge me.

You tell standard equal force is? Nah ‚Äî he‚Äôs worm. morally-bankrupt sociopathic worm, worm, nevertheless. Asia China. South Korean never done full lockdown. mails classified mails parts classified. Wear mask. Listen virologists epidemiologists. Stop whining. Adapt. Feel current president üò£  learned GGO years sgo showed scan lungs infected Corona Virus - different strain (but, know looked deeper identifying Corona virus). severe asthma, wound hospital 10 days fully recover year. pulmonologist concerned, follow scans make sure decreasing went away. public transportation? Think it, bus / traincar would evacuated. hear boss music? China. Given human rights record, I'd amazed hadn't, although public results be, can't say.

That said, challenge trials necessary begin vaccinations. Depending size trial, may something along lines of:

* 50k vaccine group, 50k placebo group
* vaccine group, 22 developed disease three months;
* placebo group, 439 developed disease three months;
* vaccine group, 44,000 tested positive antibodies trial;
* placebo group, 1,000 tested positive antibodies trial.

(Completely made numbers, course, definitely target). example above, would already know odds infection reduced 95%, antibodies maintained 88% vaccinated three months. would extremely effective vaccine benefits giving population would clear.

A challenge trial would useful telling level exposure might lead infection, level antibodies offers sterilising immunity prevent positive test results future. It'd help design future vaccines implement future processes ‚Äî could still confident delivering vaccine general population would reduce transmission Covid extremely large extent. Shocking, know, right?! 


/s Why? wear mask follow rules implemented?  direct threat aggregated assault common law, many cases actively tried. virus generally understood potentially maim kill victims. hospital instructed security team alert police effect arrest cases coughing threats.

The combined elements coughing someone saying ""you're sick now"" ""you Covid"" suffice ironclad probable cause arrest. Absolutely woods time? No, concede right that. 

But China, New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam prolonged periods success, even successfully stamped surges again. They're showing done daily basis. China's economy already growing again, air travel exceeded pre-pandemic levels. 

But suppose delusion. Lol. Good luck bruh I'm this. whole r/coronavirus sub full virtue signalling neckbeards consider heroes staying inside playing League Legends day, expect message get them. Still, nice see someone speak honestly. Wow: really? posting bad little Rhoady‚Äôs again, pretty darn good mask / distancing compliance yet cases per capita shot past TX FL ... think it‚Äôs lack testing?

Supposedly flattened curve leads, due lack overshoot, reduced total incidence. Rodents usually spread plagues. Experts say told/allowed say. knew lot science said lie, people (almost all) would believe knowledge complicated scientific field.

Don't trust anything blindly. Bill Gates either new Moses new Joseph Goebbels, except time jews whole world. actually serious? posted evidence posted purely insults... got joking, right? I'm exhausted. Funny go-to insult always high school sit kiddo

I never said reduces odds 70%. hey, we'll also normal spring imo new treatments coming out.

You obviously lack social skills give sources hate conforming. google: ""Fauci vaccine efficacy 70%"" ""how vaccine efficacy work"" Yeah likewise, best luck! Florida, mean sincerity! 

Here Denver, we're looking around country like WTF? 

The governor came said private parties fueling spread. Well, shit. wear masks everywhere go, bars &amp; music venues shuttered.

It's madness.  give shit. amazing almost predict future understand scientific process? Every ER feature, photo used show medical professionals NON MEDICAL GRADE MASKS.

Why medical personnel equipped N95 masks now? What‚Äôs stupid? think people paid enough live? Okay, then. I‚Äôm proudly stupid. Probably course! I'm happy helped. Communication definitely biggest thing trying establish openness really really hard depending raised. people want partner happy healthy willing make sacrifices that. long open feedback bad time, good. always able clearly define I'm upset hours days after, partner adjust say ""I'm upset something, I'm sure exactly yet, put topic aside come back I'm ready?"" middle argument nonsense (bc argument never exactly what's bothering me).

Can't believe missed this....Jesus. 

Lift like life depends it. does. actually useful personally. seen figure posted people saying dangerous flu idea getting from. Makes sense now, quoting crude mortality comparing case mortality.  No, doesn't. every age bracket saw ten-fold increase likelihood seeking medical care, would see exact results even identical treatment. 

I'm board idea treatments getting significantly better. studies good first step finding much. cannot give us accurate number.

Even going hospital earlier overwhelmingly likely reduce mortality. could figure much tell people, likely see doctor? trust msm social media report anything accurately.

Now post source showing stat contradicts argument sudden irrelevant discussion??

Come now... COVID Tracking Project‚Äôs Hospitalization information:

[Total currently hospitalized broken see hospitalizations sharply increasing ‚Äî like spring summer peaks. generally test exposed could yet enough virus positive test. need quarantine 14 days exposure negative test day 2, 3, 4 could mean nothing.

Quarantine, test symptoms cluster need surveil. many people good intentions but, frankly absolutely idea talking , clearly never worked day Nursing Facility life. state battling largest staffing crisis LTC industry ever seen, due incredibly high exit rates state. near impossible find qualified staff Covid-19, let alone now. midst crisis Governor slashed reimbursement rates facilities already struggling immensely, push agenda. literally immensely cut reimbursement companies providing care far single vulnerable population pandemic. 

Almost every facility rapid test machine testing multiple times week. seen residents test negative hospital come doors hour later test positive moment do. people need care. supposed do? 

And, people saying facilities care profit. Respectfully, speak yourselves. family facilities worked going 11+ years literally pandemic plan adopted state's CDC passed facilities far competent anything could come own. contained cases 20+ facilities prevented massive lose life due extremely dedicated team every single level. personally witnessed executive staff ""family owned"" corporation working almost 24 hours day since February protect residents. 

I'm sure get downvoted oblivion, irks deeply see group "" nursing homes awful places"" mentality thrown around. long-term care worker fighting every single day protect residents, thank do. Careful, still 2 months left 2020 Y. Pestis become resistant antibiotics... That's averages pandemics work. cases rise deaths.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* still fast timeline look vaccine development throughout years. mathematical substitutions question gives us: ""why Americans care think? think reasons Americans care Americans?

What spreading resources? CDC study March showed 38% hospitalized 55 years old, half ending ICU.

Irrelevant stat. care fatality rate, % people ICU. Young people infected much higher rates represent much higher portion many factors consider back 1918 would negatively effected outcomes today.

Not really. overwhelming majority COVID deaths people really old. chances dying virus go 10x every 15 years age. young demographics early 20th century would almost certainly primary factor hypothetical. 1918 pandemic would also significantly less severe western countries occurred today reason.

I mean really even need guess here. There's plenty countries limited medical technology young demographics experiencing catastrophic death rates. Yea.....did say like that??? course, Sweden never wrong sub believe much transmissible aerosol either those, virus thrives hotter temperatures well colder temperatures. would evidence need say it‚Äôs seasonal. evidence I‚Äôd happy see it, too, honestly, cuz going know would happy learn something new. even it‚Äôs really enough evidence, don‚Äôt think.

It‚Äôs one dies flu summer, it‚Äôs influenza virus harder time warmer months infecting people destroyed immune system, along diseases like pneumonia harder time well. 

The fact fewer people catch die flu summer winter product heat driving people apart cold driving together. anything, expect virus **more** seasonal people enclosed spaces = higher transmission rate. seasonal generally entirely virus transmitted. long it‚Äôs host appropriate temperature it‚Äôs fine, regardless time year. Deaths go according virus spreads.

My point that, yes, lot people die flu winter, people still die summer. true covid, simply higher baseline death, don‚Äôt really know baseline yet hasn‚Äôt enough time know. Eventually COVID deaths track along flu deaths, valley peak according seasons year, curve much higher axis.

What seeing *novel* virus far trying climb baseline countries desperately take measures try get even close baseline.

Also I‚Äôm epidemiologist anything. Don‚Äôt take word it, maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Oh, mean ""Corporate America"", oh, I've gone BS! Present Companies taking $$$$'s can't lay workers want repay $$$$. end day virus killing us, stupidity. wear fucking mask Plugging, it‚Äôs thing get alcohol poisoning really quick. Less one death day? Yep, work State required masks. would say good 30-40% shoppers (high volume warehouse club) masks halfway give dirty looks remind please pull up). wear mask 8+ hours day...at point nbd sometimes forget even on. We're nuts cleaning. new store I'm at.. morning prep done fucking dime, everything cleaned perfectly. I've worked lot kitchens, attention detail Chipotle intense. Hail corporate all, really appreciate level cleanliness, someone comes home fiance's abuela. clarify, reply someone would say person offered ""thoughts prayers"".  

Saying ""thoughts prayers"" someone also sarcastic way saying, ""Frick off"" ""Who cares?"" ignore know powerless. Revolution soon inevitable continues People debunked lies countless times thread alone. much longer going project? also word it:

- Lockdowns kill virus

- economy brink collapse SARS-1. 

Which kind relevant given COVID's proper name SARS-2. recognize username - appreciate you! comments going unseen. Must nice. countries, like China, require Chinese trial base approval that. 

What mean? trial china, chinese company somewhere else? They're testing vaccines countries. People world sick this. point can't even really blame anymore. Like yeah still reckless asshole part problem... we're SEVEN months now, end sight aside murky idea vaccine nobody still tell us actually coming save personally, impact it'll whole situation. partying acting like nothing's wrong March April May, yeah full tilt human garbage. October. Every day gets ridiculous less less realistic ask people put lives hold long, especially end date still. 

Personally I'm still holding strong part, also feel ever-increasing tugging corners mind take life back, like damn near everyone else seems done. still last months more, longer feel like pass judgment broken. 1,500 people rural ND town. 3 adult costume parties happening various local bars. feels like pretty high non-essential list, know. rally Mosinee, outside Wausau 3 weeks ago. around 5k people probably masked up. psychopathic son rally Rothschild week later. outside Wausau. many people infected area pointless political tours? ran White House lynch mob amount death destruction he‚Äôs caused. .....you can't fix IGNORANCE!!!!

trump's speech patterns starting rub you.  live bumfuck PA people act around here. There's reasoning either, end calling communist time. third time I‚Äôve seen news posted hours. 99.9% survival rate you‚Äôre 50 business fine. see didn‚Äôt mention customers lost automobile accidents. way significant abs concerning amount COVID 19. Wondering perspective told people would 500k 1mm ‚Äúdead‚Äù customers. It‚Äôs odd you‚Äôd even say that. guess really resort name calling rational argument survive here. thread really proves out. Anyone know good source explanation seeming weirdness statistics websites? example, US death total case rate something like 2.66%. EU death total case rate something like 3.99%. initial thought US testing people unlikely die. hold look tests per population.

Plus, infection rate much higher (1 39 vs. 1 102). guess trying see explanation (was curve flat, virus spread vs testing available, etc.). yet, still ‚ÄúRepublican stronghold.‚Äù also, bady, world pariahs, country us anymore, becaue COVID crap. You‚Äôre also ignoring many people die diagnosis countries wait times see dr care. Many die even diagnosed treated. deny coverage time. another childish reductionist view. 91.5% American insurance. Stop garbage false framing. Good lord Saying something make true. beyond wrong 'facts' months ago. post comment removed

But hey tesla moving CA covid human safety. travelling?  Could sign pandemic fatigue. Feels read post every day weeks away darkest part pandemic. still try vigilant wear mask use hand sanitizer go out. work remotely see small group people know thing, wears me. consider that:

Even lock downs, people drove lot less, traveled less, worked home, deaths accidents went way down

Even little masks, less interactions means less cold / flu viruses usually also kill lot people.

Meanwhile causes deaths, like overdose, probably went up, all, society slowed down, usual deaths lower, means excess deaths Covid even pronounced actually are. Mine use Hydrogen Peroxide, air tool, sign waiver basically saying believed sick sue got sick. Hasn‚Äôt year yet. Makes sense pickup, ever see delivery driver. \*WAS\*...that's past tense. making shit now. Bottom-line, open wild, mask requirements gone back loose. relatives living video chat daily showing like. STFU things clearly unaware of. Awesome! take vacation Vietnam right now? No? normal countries closed world. Another two-week lockdown, another, another Five years still want one times. get easier time, took forever get there. Ok that's even talking about.

As long considerate others, cool. fun. Yea...the article Wis Hospitals live Wisconsin, say Wisconsin, know dumb idiot MFers everywhere! wonder Herman Cain white(his soul supremacy white), someone would cared/took note died. maybe fact phone kept sending txts people thought really die! Please show scientific evidence pointing covid19 seasonal. Observation says otherwise hope right.

So June would one worst times covid19 escape Melbourne, whereas escaped october, likely would considerably less spread. cases rising every country? 

They One thing effectiveness perfect masked society social distances effectiveness masks current world worn imperfect humans avoid social distance.

All measures various effectiveness levels varying successful implementation imperfect ~~morons~~ mortals. 

Not everyone socially distances cases degree. everyone washes hands according guidelines patience reach every part hands, fingers, palms, back hand, thumbs, wrist, etc.

And on... compliance 100% mean throw away measure. one important, hence ""Swiss cheese"" model shared last people need hear listen. wonder much covid would kill 100 years ago, without medical advancement. Oh believe know, goverments tried give inmediate monetary aid people impossible due lack logistic (I direct family Peru know much clownfiesa became first, seeing lot people needed didnt appear database yet ""wealthy"" ones do), Im blaming population (that said NEED day day informal work bring money families) government acted exemplary fast... saying countries high numbers ""despite strict lockdowns"" lockdowns werent properly followed, fact, little actually manage helped lot overcharge health system earlier months. Health 20-somethings exposed absolute minimum possible viral dose necessary infection...

Sounds super generalizable. thing going work, bf can't work home 3 days week stupid seeing colleagues wearing mask half time. really let ones work home, well work home. would also mean less people stacked others metro bus. 

But no. wrong her? geez  FTFY: Minimise risk, don‚Äôt let fear overtake life take simple easy steps help lower transmission like washing hands keeping distance wearing mask. boomer neighbors (in Minnesota) drive drink party everything open. family indication all, make difference. watched father suffocate death lung disease teenagers, none siblings taking kind precaution. mother even taking proper precautions literally drowned lungs filling blood fluid. Every one high risk (thanks shitty genetics).

God fucking forbid someone tells do. Glad noped fuck earliest opportunity. I‚Äôm seeing JHU 12% Well yes, people generally die every day.  would issue trump called Mexican Virus beginning. might get it. Boston already. Trust me, people people act stupidly. Asian countries taking mindset seeing COVID long-term issue. Keeping borders closed part ""marathon"" mitigation. France might beat us it. hell 6+ months shit people still get it?

I fail understand stupid Weird thing say. Ever since list debut summer , don‚Äôt think ever less 30 states , majority , list ... studies? Please provide source. people still believe Corona hoax? geez...  People refusing wear mask saying body choice. proceed freak say thing wearing mask. Yeah aren‚Äôt number 1 cancer, close, number 1, it‚Äôs pretty much statistical tie anyway top ten. Though counts treated, United States denies coverage time. aren‚Äôt counted deaths...yeah, ok system. evidence indicates we're getting started thing. Awesome! Hope recover fully time well. realize mask on? ""Thoughts prayers."" He's good job keeping small businesses going this.

I guess depends consider well-being. Considering pre existing conditions I'm age range least likely die, let worry myself, I'll let worry yourself, thanks. time, every day stay locked thousands black brown kids starve Africa. yet point out, privilaged work home crowd quick dismiss this. 

So much Black Lives Matter. Apparently, deep down, really lot liberals  It‚Äôs right way move!!

Give everyone sick Covid questionnaire. 1. believe covid-19 hoax? answer yes, tell can't treated. Make examples people warning others. Same, remember virologists guessing 6 times many cases country back knew, would around 100.000, looking numbers likely closer 250.000, even take account treatment improved people spend less time hospital ICU back then. *absolutely* way! not? matters.

You absolutely right, disagree why.

...they'll sync week..

nobody says ""the tracking sites"" update time. I‚Äôve work home dad since February. I‚Äôm incredibly lucky (overwhelmingly exhausting) opportunity time. longer people don‚Äôt buckle hell start taking seriously, longer I‚Äôm stuck.

Even give going see Hamilton year... ffs people make sacrifices 'We've fighting war long never considered strategy intentionally losing get with.' human occasionally omits words? I'm Chicago I've hearing quite bit recently discovered existed last spring - forced apartments March - June. part fairly well spoken explains what's going perspective, awhile she, like anyone else, stumble words. never advocated wearing mask outside can't distance, because, well, would silly unnecessary. nice day I'm fly United Friday little scared new study airplanes makes feel bit better. I'm planning wearing mask goggles, face shield sure I'll wear it. plan eating/drinking flight, hoping I'm making super dumb decision. countries scolded ""opening early"". Ireland kept one restricted countries Europe time absolutely result everyone else, worse. 

This already shows expect achieved lockdown media disservice showing true horrors

Not surprising considering complicit mess contradicting lies masks onset. really anti-social asshole least anyway better chance vacccine saafe, becasue Biden would pressure finished, readly. Maybe federal agents identification it. seems roll now. Seriously many times people need told this? It‚Äôs real. It‚Äôs hoax. Lots people died even will. Jesus H. Christ I‚Äôm sorry hear that! It‚Äôs hard. feel virtual counseling? haven‚Äôt personally tried listen lot podcasts I‚Äôve dated ads businesses like betterhelp.com... people scared, maybe pre-existing conditions, mean blown proportion.

That's much better going rally almost nobody wearing mask actually participating anti-mask protest. say effect virus acts. act does. Democrats absolutely behaving way Republicans practice. Old Republicans go w/o masks say believe work gather groups 4 5. Young Democrats say believe masks hold parties go bars 30+ people, far conducive spreading virus. ignore one pretend big deal condemning other, delusional. I'm 100% ontop situation right stay home got shut republicans 25% capacity. Many sheriffs said refuse enforce mask mandate. mean companies make lot money labor slaves US prison system, takes away jobs people could paid least minimum wage for. hear lots bitching illegal immigrants taking jobs, one cares 10 million jobs go prison slaves instead regular workers? That's well there's point scared it. another one life's risk factors. Minimise risk let fear overtake life. sounds like they'd live that. guilt price pay? This
Is
The
Way. kind treasonous asshole would say that? Oh yeah, commander chief. Got source virus primarily transmitted droplet particles vs aerosolized transmission? masks recommended HCWs, particularly high-risk situations,


Yes, healthcare workers working sick people can't socially distance sick people wear medical grade retention, reuse cloth masks poor filtration may result increased risk infection


In words, wash cloth masks. Hot water, soap, hang sun dry, iron hot iron Wait,most hospitalizations? Dont worry stop testing virus deaths hospitalizations go down!! What....it work way?? Oh hey April's anti lockdown talking points know role super-spiders spread infection?

Crap, super-spiders Australia! bad US blew load mitigation techniques. could see NY California taking steps backwards, try telling US close back again. holy cow flaming stupidity, sound like anti-masker seatbelts

You can't measure metrics claiming attributed seatbelts, understand US population DOUBLED since seatbelts mandated? means double number cars (actually even since everyone seems car now) double pedestrians. Speed limits way higher. visibility cars especially SUVs dramatically reduced. Cellphones, smartphones massive distractions. 

The factors endless instead blame safety device prevents flying around car. Okay then. logic guess think masks cause people get covid. kids' orthodontist office already rinse mouth mouth wash 30 seconds start working braces. started allowed reopen past spring. virus cares, how? first noticed months ago. new TB largely problem Western Europe US.... Self reported ""always.""

I'm pretty sure ask mom ""always"" wears mask, would say yes. 

Except hugs kisses grandkids helps elearning indoors family hours time.

But yes course wears mask goes grocery store, (a low risk place 35 minutes) say yes, ""always.""

She's wonderful generous person seems think can't get family large family. visits outdoors tell put mask on, often wants sit inside instead outside, reaches hand. sweet person yes, *reports* extremely careful isn't. Also, countries like Peru Argentina locked god-knows-how-long. STRICT lockdown. Yet, cases still control. makes think approach China would work elsewhere?

Ummm, yes did. So, I'll play game bit even mask denier.

Masks perfect. [They one layer knock transmission percent every layer, greatly help stopping disease. easy layer implement, certainly easier mass lockdown.

Masks -- cloth masks, procedure masks -- shown reduce spread, even stop every aerosol. shown hospital populations (Mass Gen hospital alarming rate health care worker cases started requiring everyone entering hospital wore face cover). shown city populations (NYC estimated that, lockdown reduced infection rate most, masks contributed additional 7%). They've shown national level (Czechia's getting everyone make cloth masks helped greatly stopping Spring wave, much people stopped masking/distancing/taking seriously hell Fall wave).

So, yeah, masks general effect reduce spread. They're perfect, let perfect enemy good. Sort like H1N1? Shocked tell you. Shocked. ""I live fear.""  it‚Äôs become actual debate topic election cycle like climate change every year. hope last pandemic next one won‚Äôt nice (something contagious deadly Ebola) possibly severely punish anti-maskers, maybe point they‚Äôll evidence they‚Äôll need put mask whatever best method protect virus. aerosolized virus particles referring small appreciably ""blocked"" mask. MAY help reduce viral load referred sort blocking mechanism like suggesting. upvoted regardless positive said masks met flurry upvotes. Right. 

So Sweden defined failure deaths year aren‚Äôt lower year preceding 5 year average. Canadian here, living US since 1997 first time 23 years wish never move here...If Trumpvirus gets reelected retire early move back Canada live sister's basement...half country insane ! addition masks 100% effective, self survey includes people (think cover noses) wear mask wear improperly. Always also subjective mean different things different people. coworkers ""always"" wear masks, also know fact take desks. people recognize want admit careful could Shielding, lockdown, answer. one time immunosuppressed ‚Äòmight‚Äô actually pay me! graphic referenced support position. Respiratory droplets much larger wildfire smoke particles. virus smaller, carried media saliva. reasonable assume ""wildfire smoke"" standard particle size. Many factors determine amount size particles, proximity source. reason firefighters wear bandannas neck gaiters (as well various types masks). yes, better mask carefully fitted properly worn. mask may perfect mean benefit.

\- tightening councils, says Anders Tegnell press conference Tuesday afternoon.

For several weeks now, Uppsala Region wanted opportunities make local rules conduct reduce increasing spread infection area. recently last week, regulations changed week possible so.

#### guidelines

On Tuesday, news came stricter general advice applies Uppsala County:

* Avoid physical contact people live with.
* Discouragement arranging participating parties similar social gatherings.
* tightened general guidelines also include various activities shops, sports facilities workplaces.
* Avoid using public transport public transport.
* employer, encourage staff work home offer staff increased opportunities so.
* important continue seek care needed.

The advice valid Tuesday 20 October 3 November, effects measures evaluated, time also extended. **But question local lockdown,** Anders Tegnell believes.

\- going restaurant, feel free so, family hang with. Try reduce close contact people normally hang lot, ie live with.

#### General spread infection Uppsala County

This so-called¬† *cluster spread* Uppsala County, although cases infection linked individual gatherings according Public Health Agency.

\- see increased spread of¬† *society* ¬†in Uppsala, says Anders Tegnell.

The Swedish Public Health Agency introduced recommendations entry exit Uppsala region. counties may also receive similar guidelines future.

This lockdown restrictions going difficult new measures, described Bitte Brastad, chief legal officer Sweden's public health agency, ""something regulations recommendations,"" come fines violations.   went stage 3 quite bit. wasn‚Äôt fast enough.

The reality it‚Äôs bad disease, initially made right call cautious novel virus, longer novel, need open up. Italy, Spain, Belgium, UK deaths per 100k. There‚Äôs fair swath EU lower: Germany, NED, France, Greece, DEN, Switzerland. way, way higher Norway Finland, culturally closest cousins. numbers Milan (in city) pretty low first wave, cluster neighborhoods nothing crazy.

The hospitals overwhelmed becuase received patients rest region.

The numbers seeing Milan worrisome, people havent' fully realized yet. lockdown needs happen worldwide. China strict lockdown. China become powerful nation world countries flail economic collapse hundreds thousands dead. 

You can't healthy booming economy hundreds thousands dying hospitals collapsing sheer amount patients flooding hospital doors way media talking vaccine, causes fear population.

-Challenge put quote serious trial, like... why??

-Infect volunters, like something fear, actually putting dead/weak virus body, like vaccines work. absolutely horrible hear, hope make it. responding someone presenting two things choices. locked homes. active summer saw friends family safe conditions. guess ""locked home yEaRs"" follow guidelines.

I can't believe still argue black white thinking, people really inflexible creative. problem thinking bubble bubble What's supposed mean? luggage people pushed plane refusing wear mask donated charity well.

But suppose idea would humane less legal PR nightmare airline heard yesterday CNN MSNBC; every mask wearer saves country $3000.00, average. Let's wear masks! remember started, cruise ships EVERYONE got it, cdc like hell it‚Äôs airborne! trump knew, pretty sure, CHINA shutting 12 cases know something dont Every state charge tests, I'd say depends. neightbour 16 tested weekend symptoms. Results came less 24h. Nah leave up, deserve condescending incorrect stat. Highest Population Biggest Economy due big state geographically doesn‚Äôt make Beat State country. Now, actually love California, ton friends there, spent lot time including month stretches. wanted argue it‚Äôs best state, I‚Äôd focus natural resources, beauty landscape, geographic diversity. 

However, policies put place mostly state government decide things people people can‚Äôt decide like. many Californians don‚Äôt like either. many fact leaving. mass exodus, probably not. homelessness, high taxes, over-regulation, high cost living, etc continue, people leave higher higher pace. 

California feels like decision point. double current path take gamble? listen reason moderate views little bring state back former glory. 

I‚Äôd love hear views Californians, guessing Reddit want double take gamble. maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Well... They're pretty new company. went public years ago. first years existence, researching platform. went public, karhesr biotech IPO ever. need brakes already broken.

*taps temple*  First say per 100k go hundred like doesn‚Äôt matter. Denmark twice many deaths Norway would correct. Would Dad 70 years old Diabetes Parkinson's count high risk? Would able get early? others said, want get vaccine soon can, plan cautious reasonably possible then, recognize I'm high risk group atm, mainly concerned wellbeing. Many chance gets early? jack‚Äôs complete lack surprise what? last years Covid-patients ICU hospital. Incorrect, scenario spoke face face attacker, within couple feet scenario proposed, ao either attack get grabbed

So... I'm sorry hear exposure, hope okay.

What I'm talking general public panicking, I'm sure know. wonder many staff members also Covid. masks even 2% effective 10 doubling periods virus, less two months, expect 20% fewer cases overall. empirical evidence areas high mask compliance suggests effect pronounced. Japan, instance, case study effectiveness masks without implementing extreme lockdowns.

Choosing wear mask effective suggests one well understand exponential growth. Choosing wear mask health agencies changed recommendations face emerging science suggests one simply ignorant. I've noticed local gas station Kansas City. 3 people one without mask face dicks showing. Another two wearing another pulled down. go alcohol spot, may really desperate. people media need make distinction, don't. Thank you. former FDA chief Trump administration said country longer pandemic backstops. Sadly, current argument anti-maskers using besides ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hoax‚Äù using Fauci‚Äôs early stance masks March so-so solely didn‚Äôt want healthcare workers probably NY any. changed info asymptomatic spreaders arose. think also use WHO‚Äôs CDC‚Äôs similar stance changes masks virus itself. Unbeknownst them, science community always learning virus studies done it, yet sadly anti-maskers interpret changing minds/stances loss credibility. I, too, remember back January didn‚Äôt even think virus could go human human yet, much progress info virus came about.

Every time go essential stores, I‚Äôm relieved 100% staff wearing one, 80% fellow customers wearing one wearing properly, pretty much stores won‚Äôt allow people without masks. stores usually length journeys outside don‚Äôt tempt fate restaurants, movie theaters, bars, etc. make sense. 

I know there‚Äôs probably feeling fatigue some, we‚Äôre almost there, soon vaccine announced, we‚Äôre home stretch may clusterfuck uncertainty distribution, unknown feeling person doesn‚Äôt mask vaccine not, 100% capacity opening places, vaccine truly effective, length effectiveness, etc. see commented tossed deleting comment.

Whoa life carrying like normal? can't that! study first RCT cloth masks, results caution use cloth masks. important finding inform occupational health safety. Moisture retention, reuse cloth masks poor filtration may result increased risk infection. research needed inform widespread use cloth masks globally. However, precautionary measure, cloth masks recommended HCWs, particularly high-risk situations, guidelines need updated. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs correct? six layers.  studies done far fewer layers bet don‚Äôt like either. It‚Äôs almost like chosen live way alternative, whatever might be, worse. That's feature. gets cold Russia, fire keep warm. Almost like people die pandemics. wanted point 33% difference excess deaths reported peak months now. People argue reported Covid deaths, know variate lot countries nowhere near trustworthy stat. Still 389 deaths instead 578 per 1M fairy tale. would actually easier would probably save lives start throwing people plane parachute.

Can't close Swedish border? Please Canada closed American border 


Sweden tried thing, know benefit hindsight, failure long run Nursing homes like consistently understaffed. Covid made jobs difficult. People quitting jobs trying hire new people nursing home incredibly difficult normal day, pandemic exacerbating effort. 

Being understaffed stressed means proper protocol followed, working continue work nobody else replace them.

Woman 2- ""Why?""

Fucking seriously? Gotta love morons Midwest. It‚Äôs hard man, I‚Äôve using nicotine since teen (I‚Äôm young adult now) it‚Äôs hardest thing I‚Äôve ever tried do. family doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm kind alone. know benefits outweighs cons honestly struggle everyday. tips someone like me? So, even enough treat China? genome sequencing phase III data readout less year, that's mindblowing :) Or, could deliberately take someone's life deliberately threatening lives others, lie asleep feeling justified so.

It funny threaten someone's life, THREAT, threaten mine friends' family's right remove threat existing (if feel real threat).

So problem reaction. fool made threat danger first place. People play games people's lives. Sorry Jimmy, that's whataboutism. That's taking blanket statement logical conclusion highlight folly statement. Haha. That‚Äôs thing I‚Äôve heard day makes sense. Lol indeed correct. kinda knew downvotes chance :) edited clarify statement, wasn‚Äôt talking you. Exactly.

Compare cases arid Arizona (note dates temperate Illinois Well true certainly helps That's remarkably roundabout way saying ""if consign lot people die, might free sooner, even though there's plenty evidence reinfection possible."" 

Its callous, might kill lot people let run rampant, might well benefit so. Hey man...it's freedom dam sheeple /s Fucking BOOTING that's term that's supposed used. much respect antimaskers mass media. I‚Äôm sorry say makes sense comes support. can‚Äôt bothered. actually quit months right whole pandemic kicked off, reading couple headlines like months back got brain fixated started smoking again. feel good quitting recommend putting thought head. It‚Äôs hard get right mentality successfully quit again. stroke reading this. Someone posted recently (past days) TX stats reporting off, could that: late adds, hospitals / labs reporting, etc. 

Some said didn‚Äôt trust numbers remember thinking that‚Äôs true lot states, including mine.

A lot PhD candidates going pouring stats decades come, analyzing happened here. Well might true good testing back point still stands it‚Äôs still getting pretty bad don‚Äôt need act like cocky asshole it. residents tested positive along ‚Äúan unspecified number staff.‚Äù feeling number low, would specified it. Another article said unlikely. knows, therecis much conflicting information. definitely airborne see someone coughs something touch rub eyes mouth nose could spread. Pretty sure America.

you realise FI, SE similar also different? Shouldn‚Äôt Johan Carlson scapegoated then?

I dont know think maybe smoking yesterday bottle super glue accidentally exploded mouth guy would remove mask every time needed cough, 

Wow!!! done challenge trials it? know Oxford hope start January (slow ass UK usual) God knows we'll get it! city locked hard people actually fucking told to. pretty much fully open cases months now.

So stop lil whiny bitches bit, problem. sure? I'm looking numbers China showing positive 0.7% Jan-Sep

Each quarters are:

Q1 - -6.8%

Q2 - 3.2%

Q3 - 4.9% don‚Äôt believe anything. hope Finland succeeds curbing rise.

It seems bit strange talk ""history"" pandemic still ongoing event. History usually written fact. know people planning traveling families vacation Florida Winter Vacation. Whats important. Staying safe, fun. Hmmm Yes, inheritance rights many countries one example. Plus, they're one vaccine manufacturer. could reasonably expect 2 3 come stream.

There balance struck - get close herd immunity minimal social distancing effective track trace virtually guaranteed, half population vaccinated. less vulnerable half population also little risk.

The question is: China vaccinate half population spring, better using soft power vaccinating neighbouring countries thereby opening protecting borders, vaccinating less vulnerable, lower priority half population next? agree, especially India overpopulated mention watched vice documentary years back issue waste. People still squat middle roads defecate (usually older people). mention improverished people, afford healthcare? Yes, right. I'm *sure* there's absolutely relationship all. /s Reinfection thing.

I'm trolling. legitimate question. many people need die care enough institute mask wearing reduce number? Since seasonal flu kills 30,000 people US year wear masks help saves lives I'd conclude threshold acceptable deaths least 30,000.

That say, 30,000 people dying every year enough deaths us care wearing mask that, masks would greatly reduce numbers disease like flu. guess I'd ok letting 70,000 people die flu seems alright. I'd say 80,000 people die, institute mask wearing. 

What you? AstraZenica Johnson &amp; Johnson currently shipping requirements -10 0 F, flu vaccine. Moderna bumped -20 F. seems likely Pfizer may able bump requirements well continue testing!

Lol. I'm wondering test tampon mouth now? There's lot unpack I'll try keep brief possible (and happy someone wants correct details - barely 7:30 right coffee yet). 

First thing already experienced lock-down prior second wave back April May. superspreader several events lead lockdown happening think late July late week later 700+ cases deaths double digits. say I'll include measure included first lockdown second, second. 

The second lockdown required following: 

* Mask wearing mandated
* curfew created one allowed leave think 9 pm 6 
* 5 km movement zone - people could go 5 km home unless work another legitimate reason (and permit) 
* Could go buy essential items (food pharmacy items) day, one person household could go
* could exercise outside home 1 hour day, 1 person household

Our first lockdown also following brought back:

* could leave home four reasons: Work school, care caregiving, exercise, food essential items
* can't visit people (friends family), can't socialise outside. 

I think it. There's lot items like fact states closed borders us, even Regional Victoria Metropolitan Melbourne ""Ring Steel"" around it, police preventing people going without valid permit. 

As payments - Federally brought payment furloughed back March think was. $1,600 per fortnight. due expire September, Melbourne going were, extended (other states still access think really needed since they're mostly opened anyway). Instead, reduced $1,200, still, least getting something.

Locally, State Government realised problem people sick leave, casually employed. outbreaks retail, State Government introduced immediate payment think $200 people needed tested isolate. found positive, could receive payment $1,000. can't remember specifics though. People prove leave entitlements receive it. 

So, yeah. get little defensive people (maybe they're vocal minority) go way we've run things here. look around world see avoided something utterly disastrous. still lost lot people unfortunately, key making sure hospitals overrun. far many friends family nursing know would go measures. people annoyed State Government, blaming second wave (they charge hotel quarantine resulted super-spreader event security guards cleaners following proper procedures). feel short-sighted since ultimately people caused second wave. 

This virus joke. hope months' time, also prove Melbourne testament idea following guidelines rules prevent catastrophic effect health care systems, let alone aftermath economically personally. virus. Viruses go away. Thats basic HS science class stuff. situation would good add fuel fire like WI they're simultaneously opening [emergency know internal Aussie quarantines, but...  

If go back NZ, 14 days NZ (More refuse take test). They'll required pay stay left certain date. provision exceptions - due issues past they'll getting exceptional. 
  NZ citizen resident liable charge if: 

* currently overseas return NZ period less 90 days; or
* leave NZ regulations came effect (12.01am 11 August 2020) return later date. **includes people returning New Zealand travelling Australia (including quarantine-free states territories).** beaker bong - it‚Äôs thing. US different. put everybody ICU, mostly families'/patient's choice. know that's money protecting lawsuits. meant Europe, mostly. largely doctor's choice. Cases rejected due futility, one bats eye.  government scared right wing terrorists, that's I'm guessing Yeah get bad. know 3 people age sick couple days fine.

I know still get severe case die odds I'll probably fine. Compare grandmother substantial chance dying infected. Around 300k year date expected number total deaths causes.   Thank much talking me. It‚Äôs helped feel confident going encourage mitigation practices, I‚Äôll also try best patient encourage see friends...just precautions too

Again, thanks talking me, kind stranger really takes stop COVID US, people want hear that. chart great! 

Btw: Anyone know heart attack line chart looks like peak beginning end years? quick web search see anything related that. Fair enough, hard track conversations thread based sites. one major qualms recently arguments carry different threads, posters, conversations. easily manipulated. Hmm, know. sure one would determine data. got text asking help fight mask mandate. give up. Minds cannot changed point.

(I'm still voting, give trying convince people take covid seriously) right now, we're going see meaningful impact vaccine months. vaccine could approved, even first doses roll highest risk, notably, health care workers, rest general public offered vaccine, we're talking well second, maybe even third quarter next year.  new magic drugs coming, contrast what's said. Even find monoclonal antibodies helpful, treat very, small percentage people might get infected.  add up, we're still long haul. And, somehow, got general public understand that.

I read California isn‚Äôt going complelty reopen coronavirus ‚Äúeliminated‚Äù and...well...they waiting looooong time get stop wearing mask distancing? SNL called Trump's gatherings Covid Giveaways accurate 

I can't imagine healthcare professionals feel watching Patient Zero spread deadly virus they're watching people die daily. would depressed livid. Well, hospitalizing 3x people now? sure be.

No, Realism style thread.. abundant concern public mental health, declare food &amp; surfaces safe.

But actually, one tested real-world conditions looked tracing data. course normal vaccine. New Zealand achieved *semblance normalcy* taking COVID seriously. hey can‚Äôt find good answer online, i‚Äôm 25 living parents, tested positive covid past weekend, got test done yesterday results came back negative. they‚Äôve coughing almost nonstop since friday, say besides feel fine. haven‚Äôt shown symptoms. CDC guidelines websites say you‚Äôre sick need seperate quarantine rest family, it‚Äôs 2 1 decided made sense quarantined room.... they‚Äôre using bathrooms kitchen masks, disinfecting anything, they‚Äôre expecting disinfect everything since i‚Äôm one doesn‚Äôt it. feel lost. doctor told yesterday even though i‚Äôm negative stay home 14 days straight safe, understand feel like i‚Äôm constantly exposed here. doctor aware live two people tested positive told ‚Äòkeeping you‚Äôre doing.‚Äô least Dr. Merkw√ºrdigliebe exactly scam? controversial, fucking stupid totally ignorant reality. What‚Äôs like waste time sub trying shift narrative Bezos Buffet? accept, reason comment teared up, people taken pandemic made issue divide us even already were, words one family pulling one best things I‚Äôve heard long time... especially many us haven‚Äôt able spend time loved ones fear spreading them. nieces young, together spring break, went home state went lockdown week later... March. cases surged, went surge. Even though talk everyday, miss desperately, know miss us. dad asking, even though knew answer, thought could get together Holidays. knew couldn‚Äôt thought maybe putting Universe, would change things make happen... Thank comment, instead feeling like we‚Äôre dealing alone, connected us thread called family ‚ù§Ô∏è much higher ‚Äúturnover‚Äù previously? No, haven‚Äôt. Many hospitals across US (and increasingly EU) near maximal/post maximal capacity. 

I agree need social safety net take care people. We‚Äôve needed one since long pandemic. 

Much like you, feel powerless enact changes. However, certain death poverty, unfortunately choose poverty. floundering. Let's quit anecdotal reasoning two year-old results bubbles blame. Here's [the latest MULaw According results Q19, people (56%) asked state approve least somewhat Tony Evers' handling COVID pandemic. would surmise people, approve actions, willing wear masks happen live near Kenosha County (sorry, saw post history made typo). Yes, I've driven rural Wisconsin. grew one one WOW counties born another.

It's divided state. Alabama north, others like comment, knife's edge easy demonstrate.

edit: also, sorry see edit, many states would red cities suburbs. think that's kinda lame point make. farts.... ""1-887-Karz-4-Kids, donate car today!"" weird GOP corruption go hand hand. Lmao I‚Äôve given plenty sources don‚Äôt like feeling dumb. Maybe topic isn‚Äôt since you‚Äôre poorly informed. Check worldwide cancer survival rates country long takes get stent heart attack country. far best it‚Äôs weird think otherwise. Link without paywall: http://archive.is/8ngMi That's called moving goalposts. :D ‚ÄúFeel free find information saying vaccine work sure won‚Äôt go 2022‚Äù. 

If really nurse, you‚Äôre educated better this. EVERY LIFE COUNTS. Thats havent taken mask 6 months. bioterrorist. too. stationed GTMO Bay, Cuba long prison facility. spent year really difficulty extreme isolation. Maybe wear PPE comes along dealing covid patients, they‚Äôd understanding. 

But highly doubt would change anything. national public health campaign fucking godsend.

The fact public health politicized unconscionable. Public health partisan issue. whole thing dumb. panic panic created bigger panic far bigger underlying public health problem necessary. 

It way. new point American history giant corporations actually ones taking health safety employees mind government is. Maybe, see good thing. Germany minding situation reacting accordingly. permanent solution yet, I'm saying Germany's approach permanent solution; I'm saying Germany's policies meant friend moved US Germany able live mostly normal life year Germany got shit together virus hit, poised continue keeping shit together new wave hits it. manage cover mouth carrying cross? bad would need be: Definitely primarily opportunistic disease. high risk kids, students, working age people think mid point moves toward limiting contact sometimes services, long public health harm limiting services needy seriously considered. primarily (but entirely) opportunistic disease kills old ill workforce, weakness Covid failed exploit. 

For example - Rather programs test workers elder care facilities daily, use testing resources college students athletes next risk. Rather programs help elderly avoid others want, sent young people flooding back family homes forced grandparents childcare roles, heightening exposure. Rather programs get older workers service jobs UI payments alternative job programs, spent much money sending mostly young service workers home (which really makes sense you‚Äôre certain you‚Äôll eliminate disease time people go back work). Uhh that's weird, channel watching? look deaths population really vary much. We're track break 950 deaths/100k first time almost 30 years. We've 750 deaths/100k 10 years. Good. time. emergency, long informed consent problem it. see mention wearing mask, cared much. 

Did attack berate people behavior given societal okee-dokee well? sure downvoted. sure simple. also ofcourse mean kn case handled properly. Every one infected sounds like lot mishandled. certainly right especially times (but also before), shortage healthcare workers. Nice armchair-psychology. tell attempting force round peg square hole right now, though I'm sure going believe me, obviously belive figured couple comments forum. I'm demanding compassion much simply what's best long run. started ignoring social restrictions month ago mental health never better. life track makes perfectly happy, thank much. would suggest pull head put dirt realize know nearly much think do, especially people. insanity rural Wisconsin (and American) originate this. people 30's late 50's experience griping about. 

In fact, they're people gripes. Fair enough. flip side people sensitive pandemic. Pretty sad controversial statement. many people defend paying workers literal charity... sure think elderly vulnerable don‚Äôt deserve protection. ethical core thinking comes play. death point. Even don‚Äôt die ‚Äî yes, young people died COVID‚Äî contract virus could spread someone get really sick. Unless live sealed bubble, people grocery store, coworkers, family others come contact vulnerable. don‚Äôt deserve protection? Covid truthers commenting gung ho killing old generation go bar watch NFL game without restrictions. Also death arguably worst thing happen contracting virus. could end hospital get slapped $100,000 medical bills discharge. he's UK, every reason angry Minister Boris Johnson advised Anders Tegnell, man behind Sweden‚Äôs decision impose full coronavirus lockdown, rejecting tougher new restrictions United dangerous Tegnell is. He's satisfied fucking country's response, wants drag countries him. reopen virus comes back like everywhere else. article go find striking Vietnam, also three closest neighbours (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia) low mortality cases.

It's interesting countries close Yunnan province China - major bat coronavirus reservoirs exist.

Is anyone aware evidence populations countries may higher rates pre-existing immunity could arisen high levels infections closely related coronaviruses? actually work software development. algorithm used wrong, way worse simple calculation error. l would hire you. know noone would.

I upset salary yoyr fictional job. find frustrating always seems class dunce giving everyone probability lessons thread. Stop blaming schools shit IMO. Individuals need take responsibility actions. can‚Äôt always shield Everyman blaming higher entity none us power change. change though. Focus fixing little things bigger things follow. huh?

people taking ZERO precautions COVID much likely get therefore much likely die. know article says. point people failing even easy basics like mask wearing, social distancing. Although since uncontrolled community spread, people avoid nonessential outings. going bar really, eating inside restaurant really important right now. case numbers really need come weather gets really cold, holidays, influenza season really kicks gear. Employees must wash hands ""Just Say No.""
From failed USA War Drugs. People want wear masks spend day COVID unit. thing smoke. basically telling medical people fuck off. Dude love good conspiracy theory it. Donald Trump would never show hospital without semi serious reason, Could crumble strongman image (lol). finally agreed taken Walter Reed aides convinced better potentially taken stretcher got bad.

Edit: also complete control news cycle, fully aware one month quite long time go election plenty crazy things happen shift narrative. ‚Äúhospital staff repeat plea every day half year disheartening‚Äù

Did catch 60 Minutes interview Dr Fauci wife? wife asked really sick responded without second‚Äôs hesitation repeat thing over: public health measures. 12.4% positivity rate? 

How Lombardy doing? I've seen couple nurses social media outlet name. one particular thought cute profile pic mask eyes making pouty lips. made several comments masks also stating rhat icus filling up. know rhey are, they're making state fairgrounds make shift hospital. know works. hope really nurse. I'm mortified think could nurse need intensive care, total dingbat. Wow, really gonna repeat March clownshow again. 

Can't wait new round clapping. course didn't, articles exist ""99.4% PEOPLE INFECTED RECOVER"" scary headline gets clicks. media gonna focus outliers worst case predictions keep fear driven gravy train rolling. There‚Äôs definitely high CBD/low THC weed called hemp actually buy online cause less .03 percent THC. use anxiety/depression research definitely added benefit. utter bullshit, telling resort puff piece foreign paper half year ago find example. even telling think person literally tattooed mans face body way representative. said, pathetic. Alabama Midwest?

[X] Doubt know McConnell held filling ton federal circuit positions Obama could stack courts Trump. way circumventing states rights (which matter party charge, apparently) legislating bench. know, stuff love project left? watched happen state Trump-appointed judge struck Democratic governor's shut restrictions, lol we're case rise up!

They know time running base-wise, they're positioning gerrymandering courts install much power way out. part frustrating talk people realize big deal 2014 2016 terms voting choices.    Tuberculosis, tragic is, new disease human immunity know almost nothing about. also cases part world live. grasping straws, best.

Now, want ask care people parts world, common: do. I'm politically active systems impoverish global south. notice 7 day moving average doubled low July around 500 1200 per day early August never got back low? Misinformation conspiracy-based extremist beliefs biggest threat humanity today capacity null serious issue overtakes us know big bill would be? would rather take chance death. go again. sad nothing seemed learned months prior suffering. Tragic perspective. last sentence perfect. biggest reason infect old people. honest. Trying repeatedly panic everyone exceedingly rare events end getting tuned out. bar restaurant lobby incredibly powerful

Source this?

I get comment upvoted. Bars restaurants HUGE portion economy, people need pay bills. 

This comment chain general kind stuns me. upset people putting personal responsibility people actions? starts paranoid blaming people littering instead blaming companies?

Do blame business problems life take responsibility actions all?

Your comment scares me. Anybody There?.... AZ covid icu nurse here. Welcome club. kept seeing Facebook posts family/friends living Midwest thinking overblown. took months make way there. always people don‚Äôt won‚Äôt take seriously. even nurses think it‚Äôs scam ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù. People fucking stupid. bright side, numbers go down, seeing bit uptick again. really think mask mandates helped all. wow hyenine helps would knew No. higher level antibodies helps molecule helps virus. money fix everything. still got thrown streets, isolated everyone, lost jobs careers. need happen first place sure give everyone check make forget ever suffered  Sorry frustrated. Also kept mask way longer sip. He‚Äôd basically put less off. I‚Äôm sick people mask thing. Sad true test see people still believe super elderly people claim 100. understand metrics used get said? selected biased source lmao that‚Äôs ok. best hospitals world, United States top 10 country. Yeah, beginning, ""bubble"" supposed people lived thus choice around. whole idea everyone building socializing bubble part virus keeps spreading; many people exist TOTAL isolation, one person gets virus necessary trip grocery store, instead virus staying amongst one family, spreading whole ""bubble,"" many also probably necessary activities spread virus beyond bubble. least Likely die vulnerable unhealthy old people live nursing homes. Something like 40% people 35 type underlying health condition. everywhere. Vaccines also suck weak immune system. Healthy people receiving vaccine would better since they're ones tend active society. Vaccinating frontline workers elderly bad start, they're everywhere small portion population. would still restrictions mass gatherings need masks til rapid testing amps significantly everyone easy access vaccine. country constantly compared best performers? Also bottom 10% silly world doesn‚Äôt testing reporting infrastructure needed calculate accurately. Sweden excess deaths probably reported. Thank insight infected meat processing factories seasonal workers live quarters several people one room one complex often provided respective company. clarify. üòä Yea...but kids RURAL WISCONSIN that. Hell, half teachers dumbasses like them! want decaying non preserved corpse dumped onto Mitch McConnell‚Äôs lawn trebucheted dining room. hear guy redpiller ignorant says ‚Äùyou care people peoples health normally now‚Äù ‚Äù obligation worry that's real world works‚Äù can't believe US..err mean UK... unsafe vaccine development. can‚Äôt believe many still think covid like flu.

Of course, screamed void, country collectively lost mind. 

So I'm supposed take winter utterly cut human contact? think so. could always wear mask wash hands.

The issue choice wear mask. issue choice others wear mask choice business mask-required policy. Common knowledge among who? Sources? Hi like username ‚ÄúWinter still coming, mean, uhhhhhhhhh....‚Äù Big oof. Can't say expect though, every time walk around city see packed pubs restaurants. like COVID exist anymore. Please don‚Äôt pull ‚Äúmuh long term damuge‚Äù card Ill using convenient ‚Äònot feeling well‚Äô excuse avoid family functions year suspected. precisely get complacent vaccine eventually come (which probably even happen Spring, Winter), return immediately back normal. going back normal. sooner accept this, better.

It's pretty well shown virus really going eradicated vaccine. might work months, back square one.

We could've eradicated virus. Instead, chose let burn. might one worst click bait headlines i've seen... least today. used computer programs see molecule could bind specific protein SARS COVID-2 virus  *Stephen Smith voice* ....what think. wearing mask places 1918 got beaten. ‚ÄúPeople tired Covid, want left alone‚Äù... 220,000 American lives would disagree Well that's awful.

Do mean think option let hospitals overflow? get something wrong? 

A lockdown would good Belgium. one month 2 months depending number cases, relieve lockdown contact tracing well change. 

If lockdown done well little cases end. allow people country unless absolutely necessary (no skiing, please) ok then.

So, conclude measures effective stopping flu effective coronavirus? coronavirus certainly *did* come Southern Hemisphere. reddit, much thought doesnt go comment people beong neglectful others well being. understanding nations US rushing approve vaccines record time, spite risks.

American politics cash perverting scientific process globally.  Trump's agenda impacting Americans.

Nurses vital job unbelievably appreciated, however, job isn‚Äôt diagnostics. It‚Äôs amazing every single time one interviews it‚Äôs doctor it‚Äôs nurse. Youre computer programmer doesnt know calculate percentage? Seriously?

And thats one mistakes made. looking forward literally health condition anyone gets vaccine blamed said vaccine.

Eats bacon every meal last 40 years heart attack? Must vaccine. Yes do, distract fact result incredibly small even multiply 100. Louisiana's governor Democrat actual point here?  Yeah , Covid convinced one reasons people aren‚Äôt taking seriously we, society, divorced death process it‚Äôs easy emotionally distant well. news reports showing it‚Äôs like literally suffocate death COVID, would lot less dismissal 210+k death toll. need shocked complacency, big time, ways one.

I‚Äôm ICU nurse Houston worked Covid. mentioned husband morning maybe jump plane contract work home state Wisconsin help out. But, really think need stay Houston feel it‚Äôs coming back too.

Context: hospital located Marathon County - county 135k people. one two major hospitals serve county. put bluntly, many people recording frequently deaths.

* Case count tripled past month 1k 3k
* month ago, avg. new cases per day less 10. 100.
* Nearly 2% population COVID past month.


Total 3% marathon county population COVID. comparison, NY state, one worst hit, 4% population infected. current trajectory, Marathon county worse infected rate NY end month.

Dear Leader said Dem Hoax. winter coming save us all? thank first responders protectors disregarding sacrifice sake convenience .... sounds American. It‚Äôs travel, it‚Äôs measures too. Everything coronavirus mitigates flu risk, pretty much.

I mean hell even people sick flu never wore masks outside countries *might* taken work. Friends would come bring soup something. much anymore. flu symptoms, stay away people like never before.

This flu season may well demonstrate bad coronavirus could get unmitigated. say flu season say 20 times better usual, could roughly say whatever coronavirus time could easily 20 times worse. since it‚Äôs infectious. also science based field

Seems case every pandemic/epidemic except SARS, good enough me. Absolutely! Sorry advance wall text. Governments health organizations around globe pushing [similar easy-to-digest precaution PSAs]( One model ""The Three C's"" message describes three types activities avoid:

* Closed spaces (ie. close quarters indoors)

* Crowded spaces (close contact many people)

* Close-contact settings (close-range conversations)

The risk highest factors combine, indoor party indoor dining. lack masks hugely compounds risk well. 

I believe structure originated since adopted internationally [the many US cities/states (such [LA](http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/docs/protection/ReduceRiskInfographic.pdf), [Florida]( [Hawaii]( similar model ‚ÄúThe Three W‚Äôs‚Äù, instead discouraging particularly risky behaviors instead encourages protective behaviors:

* Wear mask

* Wash hands

* Watch distance

Once again, party indoor dining distancing poor masks donned greatly increases risk.

This model believe originated [CDC]( [fairly well-adopted]( US lesser extent elsewhere.

These messages course greatly simplified easy dissemination remembering. great generalized rules safety. slightly detail, charts ranking risks certain activities (ex: [1]( [2]( [3]( [4]( caution med-large gatherings indoor dining particular extremely high risk, whereas small distanced outdoor gatherings mask usage fairly low risk. [They stress avoid]( activities [as much possible]( [take ample precautions minimize risk]( participation unavoidable.

For even directed recommendations based kind activity, [the CDC made page choose activity read mitigation recommendations]( social gatherings consistently recommend outdoors well-ventilated indoor space outdoors possible, heavy mask usage, ample distancing. course, page going assumption already weighed risks decided activity appropriate unavoidable. weigh risk whether activity even attended [see page here]( You‚Äôll note indoor spaces many people wearing masks call ‚ÄúHot Spot‚Äù risk, whereas outdoor spaces distance masking dubbed ‚ÄúSafe Spot‚Äù.

Overall, private social gatherings particular, risk increases significantly event indoors, larger people, maskless, long duration, and/or loud conversation singing. general, feel many people still diligent public settings opposite private settings. Contact households risky. doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs stranger family member. Private social gatherings [have noted]( [fueling outbreaks]( [spread beyond event attendees]( wider community. Social gatherings risky attendees community large, foregoing simple precautions throwing fuel fire.

The president fox literally using years media fear mongering manipulate people. 

When president says ""Media always says crime crime that, we're safer ever"" he's literally wrong. Media that.

It‚Äôs risk tolerance imo. 

If certain number folks vaccinated, point reach threshold projected deaths within society‚Äôs risk tolerance. 

That likely around 100,000 deaths year US think, fair amount, lot flu.

Once numbers point, think ending restrictions entirely essential.

Edit: hypothetical world 55 could get Corona, would within risk tolerance right based danger people.

That case, obviously, don‚Äôt think vaccinating younger populations necessary reopening. It‚Äôs vulnerable getting projections around 100,000 death mark. I‚Äôm sure would. They‚Äôve worked hard convince whole thing liberal hoax isn‚Äôt risk. moved Aus UK :-(

But really depend measure it. like recent CDC study saying 85% covid patients wore mask.

I'm much concerned 79 year old grandmother high blood pressure getting vaccine. react people drinking/eating train, otherwise wearing masks? 

Wow, stances really polarised then. idea they‚Äôre contrarian purpose. Initially resistant idea felt like ‚ÄúWELL, I‚Äôm smart‚Äù rationalization kinda understood people meant it. cdc good enough maybe stocks better Wallstreet . think something-- although experiment would pass ethics board.

And probably stated directly, lol, let less crankiness ooze comment. Careful, gym bros might hear even SUGGEST indoor settings safe come fight you.

...Speaking experience. agree indoor air I, too, barking since earlier year. People wanna hear it. Exactly they're probably piece candy Exactly 20 people dead single day Hyderabad floods.

Idaho like drunk New Hampshire comes belligerent ""personal rights"" proposing them, simply removing vehicle. Yup it‚Äôs reason SF became epicenter Spanish flu pandemic back then. less tests lockdown, less cases?! pretty simple need shut airports tall piece plexiglass. ridiculous number tourists flying US every day. known sample size, requirement report results central database, possibly get estimate proportion population may infected.

What's smug explanation? Yeah, giving elderly diabetic mother deadly disease would incredibly sad. That‚Äôs socially distancing. Useful, also disquieting, especially unknown virus.

4. Aggressive test contain eradicate nearly eradicate. evidence mounting case, transfer indeed occurring.

I live hot spot nationally, minutes week prevent debilitating illness seems prudent. leave lockdown cases again, lockdown less tests getting done, therefore less cases..... never ending game? see trend? familiar Sweden, describes Swedish attitude toward government perfectly. asses. There's difference public private trust. face wall caused lack private trust, generates enormous public trust. thought said boo agreed publicly shame That's big difference. adviced to, Swedes would mask once. I'm saying. even ""blessed swede"" many like point out, good enough compliance make **guarantee** work. !remind 2 months see stays like country really going drain. many countries choice, would say true basically European countries least.

Norway Finland definitely marathon well, ever relax vaccine found, likely resurgence cases. better initial responses, resulting less total deaths, right less position Sweden. mean... bioterrorism though...  understand simple elementary school science, need defend politicians. Lack social distancing cause recent uptick cases Europe elsewhere. cause lack social distancing driven different factors. 

I would like suggest cause one spike one part world caused one thing. another spike another part world caused different thing.

The recent uptick Spain France caused reduced social distancing. Perhaps brought fatigue (or sometimes unkindly called complacency).

The uptick Chicago similarly caused lack social distancing. Though time cause lack social distancing **a change behavior** due weather. 

It drop temperature cause spike. drop temperature drives people inside lack social distancing. turn causes rise cases.

Stop focusing temperature cause. realize temperature causes changes behavior - change behavior precipitator less rigid adherence social distancing guidelines. Lol no. I've friends coming going thos whole time. one got sick, one freaked out, ya'll need 5o chill think would overly aggressive to, know, defend bioterrorism. know infection rate would Europe nobody wearing masks? answer is, course, - data anyway. usually boils what's necessary what's not. Class necessary. grocery store too. doctor. going eat pick take home necessary thing. That's personal opinion anyway. know someone ICU two months almost died bc corona. still dealing affects it, hearing story enough make stay home can. Yes would say evidence strong holding things equal masks reduce infection rates top evidence reduces viral load. Also importantly evidence causes harm. would nice wait rock solid study don‚Äôt time that. year's Hunger games getting creative Except Finland never went complete lockdown. Yes, restaurants bars closed, example restaurants still allowed sell out. people continued working normally, lockdown sense people understand lockdown. Let's realistic, even planes atm(with masks) friggin bad idea. thing called money need pay food bills. Maybe get Reddit start life find it. regular humans. I‚Äôm misanthrope. heres actual data showing work  sure data accurate? compared Pneumonia deaths Florida via CDC WONDER reported 2400 2018, whereas total Pneumonia deaths Florida far year reported 2600. Stupidity eternal. Holy shit, right. Technically, bioterrorism. wish fucking mattered right now. dangerously, malignant stupidity run rampant US right now. president idiot followers care. view informed history anything else faintest whiff 'education' something sneered at. 

Until dislodge government, going keep getting worse. Winter beautiful year round. It‚Äôs brown, white, grey. hate sun summers.

I‚Äôve whole life too. ran blizzards I‚Äôm active winter weather nice. despise summers. delusional? Nah fuck Joe. state marathon sprint like fact life. truth is, marathon. end marathon, choice. 

Saying Sweden can't things Norway Finland really pathetic excuse. really absurd argument. masks wont work used improperly?

And since people use properly work? case screwed. 

At pace run ICU capacity 2-3 weeks. 1 week already 'cashed in' current cases like way think take personal responsibility infect loved ones, family, rest society. 

I would compare everyman's right, Freedom roam laws. allowed access, camp land except private gardens within 70m house. 

That means free roam people's private property camp two nights. Everyone learns take responsibility damage people's property, restore everything leave. ""do disturb, destroy"". sense personal responsibility, means willing accept live society‚Äôs established standards individual behavior. 

Put jacket cold.

Don't destroy people's property.

Don't spread deadly disease others. valid approach. act like shit, I'll act like smell everytime like shit. Separated roommate early July gatherings (albeit others houses). gonna get worse winter colder area. Make move feel better. practice means real life.

Thats spread Covid-19 two countries mask mandates. would never support another lockdown. virus really scary enough justify lockdown tell people it.

Most teachers parents elderly. Distance learning still option. really worried it, fall one risk categories, keep kid home still person classes week, stop going? bode well personality, no. That‚Äôs evidence anything People subreddit love advice loners friends life. want everyone miserable, lonely, depressed like them. Yes please. Preferably spiked boots. Nah dude that's absurd argument. Masks work used properly. people cannot use masks properly therefore virus spreads, fault masks, fault PEOPLE. basically saying condoms work people want wear sex. absolute nonsense. 



Maybe people stop acting like mental toddlers issues. heres actual data showing work assesment current state science population-level mask wearing? Would argue ""strong""? question whether evidence against. whether evidence for. question only: evidence (population level - important context here) mask wearing \*very strong\* not. need kind techno-authoritarian (or least get ready accused authoritarian).

There cult ignorance United States, always been. strain anti-intellectualism constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means ‚Äúmy ignorance good knowledge.‚Äù - Issac Asimov make sense. that's problem days. People seem lack common sense. saying Tegnell stubborn change methods short sighted. could possibly know hes afraid future situation rather shorter?

Science built falsification mark good scientist actively looking evidence disconfirms hypothesis trying craft experiments reflect goal. However, often meet scientists exact opposite learn recognize signs pretty quickly. They'll pet theory they'll incredibly confident validity theory disconfirmatory evidence massaged still fit without real change worldview. One way learn recognize people simply rate admit wrong. Someone never admits wrong either savant manages predict world entirely correctly stubborn fool cares pride divining accurate picture reality.

It quite obvious start Tegnell kind scientist, way spoke things chose present arguments. example, early on, estimation IFR pretty different scientific consensus fine, scientists allowed different opinions, telling present things acknowledging IFR estimate time intrinsic uncertainty Sweden's response would change IFR presumed different number. anti-lockdown contingent scientists IFR figures drastically lower mainstream presented IFR rock solid number key cornerstone arguments and, importantly, focused confirmatory studies suggested IFR correct totally ignoring evidence IFR figures could totally wrong. It‚Äôs CDCs place advise ordering anyone. 

Masks good thing. Authoritarian unconstitutional over-reach not. guy's jerk hotel culture problem right now. every employee enforcing mask mandate, always situations like this. takes manager ready bold mandate enforcement, knowing loss business hurt feelings along way. think point friends life outside internet. think need look that. sit restaurant since March. definitely get takeout, leave tops go orders, way going eat. church. lot (Tennessee) services without masks they're singing. Stay home people! streaming online! know, right? almost like put /s reason.

The joke killed lot people, therefore coming close immunity. Can't infect someone dead.

R/woooosh  sfu shows work practice someone Scotland, don‚Äôt claim her. Here‚Äôs works practice I‚Äôm guy Enforces face coverings airport. You‚Äôre Welcome. Why? whole point mask mandates seem universally stop Covid-19 practice. Even theoretically do.

I claimed studies say work? Seems like lot new agencies purposefully trying draw attention away fact class/money issue rather issue facing certain ethnic groups. similar small study (Ireland) good all.. include elderly vulnerable front line workers? studies show work practice well Airlines throw anti-mask passengers plane mid-flight! 1K day state population 1.75!!!

doesn't take math genius figure BAD obviously.

You seem understood gist argument here:

""It matter work theory, seem work practice.""

Since keep posting links.  change strategy perhaps, flexible policies rather stricter policies. S. Korea, health authorities try trace infection routes known cases. established cases infection occurred people wear mask wore improperly. Q3 Vietnam 2.6% already Show 1 study shows don‚Äôt work prevent spread Covid eradicating virus within country, less closing borders. helps New Zealand, Australia Taiwan islands easily control borders, China huge resources could implement draconic lockdowns (something would unconstitutional illegal Sweden).

It worked well them, honestly think would work Sweden. cannot simply close EU borders vaccine found, huge initial spread Sweden meant would significantly harder eradicate within country well.

The optimal strategy differs different countries, depending different circumstances resources.  It‚Äôs approved scientific editors Ok smart guy. people work restaurants shops? Offices? Take bus. everyone lucky able work home. Vietnam China? China -0.7% Jan-Sep. Vietnam 2.12% Agree. Thats news feature journalist, even study. Rona DeathSentence, running mind. Good job, Floridians Yes, efficiency mask wearing compared nothing question. 

It's complex situation, none research proving mask wearing extends protection much beyond keeping distance. well keep distance.

""if can‚Äôt keep proper distance"" - practicing social distancing, suggestion: go home! prestigious scientific journal world see advantage masks public transport (not use right now), otherwise right. What‚Äôs office? know what's scary, moderna never product come market this. China island? Ehbooks ISLANDS Right away think South Korea's approach considered no-lockdown. Taiwan's well. think effective TTI (Test, Trace, Isolate) programs. amazing terrifying type anti maskers everywhere world. country, may vocal, seeing vast % people roaming streets without masks. confronted, would ask complainer mind business.  researchers, SFU‚Äôs **Department Economics**...

Yeah. Look, can't make wear mask, don't, get respect treat change consequence. every country island. Schools closed children 11 required wear masks, that's why. France suffers chronic under-investment education, means classes ages overcrowded, poorly designed buildings little ventilation. even made protocol case infection school lighter. children catch school, give parents spread work friends on.

Meanwhile, life China, Taiwan, New Zealand, large parts Australia (among places) returning normal. hard parts effective strategy, suffer marathon grind.

(I really understand anyone would call humans beings herd unless deliberately condescending, prefer referring population immunity strategy.) 

After articles started claim population immunity actually governments *secret* strategy point government told head virologist get change ideas spoke publicly again. 

That would end worst part, many articles warning people believe population immunity hypothesis instead Denmark something like full month getting spammed immunity hypothesis, followed note bottom corner section government brushing off.

Urbanization = overcrowding, Sweden's case especially amongst big immigrant population likely live extended multi-generational families one roof. partly financial partly result housing crises big cities (especially Stockholm), meaning people come usually stay families can.

These things well-known people live Scandinavia.

Sweden well-known much larger population asylum seekers compared rest Nordics too, group risk living overcrowded conditions multi-generational households.

We know hot-spot areas hit Stockholm first wave primarily immigrant-heavy suburbs, read potential infected areas Stockholm (in Swedish - hardest hit suburbs shown table 2 familiar Stockholm know they're known housing poorer immigrants). page 12 say correction age/gender people born Somalia, Syria, Lebanon Turkey overrepresented data.

I'm saying immigration differences sure reason local variation - related phenomenon immigrants areas tending poorer general working jobs can't stay home from. I'm saying potential *hypothesis*, one variable amongst many.

And I've already given plenty potential variables - hypotheses - explain local variations spread different countries/regions curves look different, state fact since I'm researcher future studied depth years. seems like decided one thing (lockdown = good) working backwards prove this. that's science works.

And say ""Topeka, Kansas rural, city"" well, Topeka Kansas surrounded rural areas, city, boasts 125,000 residents 62 sq miles. county 1.3 million residents, 453 sq miles, county 7x larger Topeka, population density 186,000 residents per 62 sq miles.

Of course, always possibility one myriad bat species host, quite unlikely given infect cats, dogs, ferrets, etc. humans. Presumably would able infect bats infected bats. 

So quite clearly rather strong adaptation humans occurred.

The exact numbers useful anyway compared change numbers, approximation could useful, long trying campare numbers another nation. back ventilators, immunosuppressive drugs help improve outcomes, antivirals, antibiotics prevent secondary infections like bacterial Pneumonia.

The point 1918 population people 70, given rarity person die untreated COVID unless several comorbities 70, there's absolutely chance outbreak we're experiencing would anywhere near severity virus killed 2% population planet infecting third them. completely ignoring vast majority critically ill COVID patients people way average life expectancy 1918. COVID compares 1918 pandemic similarly seasonal flu compares COVID. We're talking virus order magnitude killing potential, killed people younger, populous demographics much higher rate elderly. vacuum, yes. consider totality situation though, benefits diminish costs build time. 2 week lockdown vs 8 month lockdown present different values fully considered. Schools reopening + cold weather driving people inside.

NYC saying back March. October. Nothing going change hits every state realize bad is. states hit hard back sadly find hard way real, listened.  ten times higher. 

Using CDC values IFR age (scenario 5, current best estimate) 2019 census values population age gives following estimated deaths 100 percent infection rate:

Age 0-19: 81.6M x 0.003% = 2,449 dead

Age 20-49: 126.6M x 0.02% = 25,926 dead

Age 50-69: 80.38M x 0.5% = 401,903 dead

Age 70+: 36.6M x 5.4% = 1,976,576 dead

Total: 2,406,854 dead

Population IFR=0.0073 =0.73%

If IFR numbers accurate, 209k covid deaths implies around 28.4 million people already infected. (It's bit higher now, numbers couple weeks ago)

Note herd immunity vaccine would around 67% 2.4 million number, around 1.6 million. 

Of course uncertainty IFR could go better treatment could go things get run. wild claim. That's simply true. Completely, 100% false. entire post.

Please point even single place herd immunity advocated Danish authorities, head virologist SSI matter SSI. idea bordeline media listening certainly major. claim ""many people Denmark still claims goal everybody get infected"" wild completely unfounded.

There's reason restrictions introduced cases began rising September Rt well 1. wanted herd immunity obviously that. recently today Danish Prime Minister said disease serious necessary keep close eye developments. Fortunately, also reported today, Rt currently 1. Denmark restrictions testing every single full test center 0-day waiting time.

SARS-CoV-2, causative agent COVID-19, uses viral Spike (S) protein host cell attachment entry. host protease furin cleaves full-length precursor glycoprotein two associated polypeptides: S1 S2.

Here, used X-ray crystallography biochemical approaches show S1 CendR motif directly bound NRP1.

My summary:
In March April, hospitals slammed first wave, lot people died. peak, admitted 1422 patients two-week period late March early April). that, late April May, curve flattened less 200 patients per two-week period. staff also lot clinical experience. Outcomes improved. spreading fatalities longer period

Isn't much better? First, people live longer, second improved treatment protocols death rate lower, third vaccine comes infection rate much lower. thank Donald J Trump network lickspittle toadies ongoing lack leadership every area, masking, hygeine, social distancing, promised improved testing contact tracing. 45=death know, positive news allowed subreddit. Blatant clickbait. It‚Äôs always clear it‚Äôs never going away - it‚Äôs bringing incidence death rates level acceptable risk. Yup Paying them. Coronavirus? Never heard it. Since pandemic still ongoing would call cherry picking.

I think several reasons, top mind order:

* Winter vacation week Sthlm one week later neighbors (probably biggest reason initial seed, said ten percent population traveled outside Sweden spread weeks, Alps popular destinations)
* Custom self-quarantine upon return
* Late increased public testing
* capitol region basically holds half others countries entire populations
* Dry Tinder-effect
* Softer ""lockdown""
* Slow response
* Idiots :)
* whole mess misinterpretation on-site examinations
* Older population (can't find source now)
* Stupid super spreader event Sthlm - Swedish Eurovision
* System failure elder care - untrained temps working hour without PPE language barriers, care facilities home care, going home home.
* Self-government/decentralized regions comes health care
* PPE stocks (Hi Finland like best preparation world)
* Immigrants hardest hit, least beginning, countries comparison. Probably mixture bad information government, cultural differences like closer contact, social gatherings poorer/living several generations household.
* constitution/Sweden Sweden.

So think closing elementary school, pubs, gyms, hair dressers, libraries borders. also weirdly anti-science.

Arrogant Greedy White Citzen didn‚Äôt like ideal.  don‚Äôt like predictions like this. already know world gone sh*t. even slight chance things won‚Äôt bad would prefer believe abandoning hope. don‚Äôt need dire warning. already that. Officially depressed eat, much less online school. Fuck year. It‚Äôs taken EVERYTHING me.  already online grocery shopping pandemic?  
I think makes bigger asshole? /s

For real tho way thinking pretty reductive. Claiming people utilize online grocery shopping value life someone else‚Äôs bit misleading. elderly people pre existing conditions. Sure valuing life bad ? nurses doctors working 12-24 hour shifts want extra hour rest instead shopping. 
What go grocery shopping dad ? saying life less valuable his.
It‚Äôs reductive . That‚Äôs all. don‚Äôt disagree it‚Äôs privilege think many people sorts privileges doesn‚Äôt inherently make bad people. agree people desensitized death process, issue predates COVID. 

I'm uncertain, though, showing visceral images media would much effect. think COVID deniers would write fake news, cherry-picked images one two hospitals. remember Redditor linking study one threads something along lines difficult get people alter behaviour close loved one personally affected tragedy.

Our lives changed worse thanks fucking pricks. hope got Covid suffered have. thought might crap sitting traffic brand new car...My plan light fire driveway probably husband home.  barking wrong tree fan Keynes...

Yeah, one us actually knows economics. I‚Äôm expert, read fun took macro micro college enjoy subject area.

To quote Nobel winning economist, Keynesian now.
 
Your derision Keynes demonstrates ignorance ideologue nature, like creationist shitting Darwin.

You could acolyte Austrian economics ignorant much short timeframe cheat fiat, already 9 months even felt bulk economic impacts yet.

Then guess short time frames longer 9 months. EU nations lot say US states though, end financially stable countries trying block debt meant help harder countries.

Indeed, weirdness referred to. EU countries run currency way US literally can‚Äôt control supply debt enumerated in. cases, can‚Äôt run u f money.

It course become near valueless like Zimbabwe Weimar Republic goldbugs love endlessly. I'm saying literally going lockdowns end time, timeline end know look like.


Ahh, grasp word endlessly commensurate understanding economics. 


Laters, it‚Äôs mildly amusing. would mean Covid already killed war US history. 300K cause mortality. So, flu, heart attacks, strokes, cancer, etc. official figures, COVID something like 3rd leading cause death US (beaten heart disease cancer). 300K flu. people still think it‚Äôs flu hoax. remotely understand cognitive dissonance necessary ignore cold hard facts. I'm saying same. I'm saying precedent ""even saves one life"" set people indirectly time strongly declaring follow government orders keep others safe. precedent apply pandemics. it? precedent set us complying ""even saves one life"" ""even saves one life virus"".

Excellent pandemic response. bigliest. assessing relative risk

They're not, though. relative risk indisputably higher throughout pandemic, least many parts United States. They're opposite assessing -- they're ignoring reality. also find posts negative impacts lockdowns popular...  Kinda makes feel like governments claiming okay hit people stomach, long recovers afterwards :/

Still coherent plan going US. mean least Gov‚Äôt told stand won‚Äôt want die medical costs treat it. new cases states looking like countries total though? current number deaths around 0.13% global population. death counts inflated incorrect counting, makes IFR even lower that. It‚Äôs Fairbanks. place I‚Äôve seen staff wearing masks Home Depot Lol, imagine thinking wanting interact rude nobody like literally zero benefit means must long safe space.

You matter. resolve whether sentiment led people turning vote. course, logical people emerge safety increases availability vaccines. However, right now, safety _decreasing_. States setting records new infections. 

You certainly walk back house fire hotspots still addressed professionals safety picture clear. probably great time walking fire rapidly spreading. herd immunity look like every nursing home. live upstate New York, rural people Trump followers.

Hmmmm, decisions decisions......

(Note, going Disneyland) yeah, imagine outcry society that's protesting keeping old vulnerable people inside...

btw, check link us % cases ending hospital oer age group: see, gets pretty bad. yes, last group much, people from75-84 occupied quite lot beds.
afaik,situation US quite alarming, not? yet, quite old people ending hospitals... could searched see icu numbers exist, I'd expect support line reasonong Check worldometers website. They've got chart US lots different helpful numbers comparison, well chart countries. Vermont 3,119 cases/million 93 deaths/million. That's good gets US, New Zealand 377cases/mil 5 deaths/mil. NZ safe, *you're still US*. Vermont also relatively low tests per million population, would indicate likely many missed cases states. state gov also probably website detailing cases county, specific area might less cases state average per capita. People also travelling soon holidays, increasing cases country.

If hang outside masks on, totally fine. Masks proven effective, ventilation proven effective. go inside use restroom, make sure people keep masks well, safe. know friends engaging avoidable risky behaviors like going restaurants parties wearing masks close others, okay. Generally, people wear masks avoid long-term indoor activities, get it. get it, going get them. get it, asymptomatic pre-symptomatic see them, wearing masks hanging outside likely still safer going grocery store. Also get flu shots make sure everyone see also gets them.

I think needs assess means ""living life"". much social activity need thrive? out-of-home activities feel needs? risk factors either you, would either likely bring virus work infect overweight 50 coworker? cutoff local infections would make feel unsafe? number another? kids going back school area, there's likely increase cases already happened.

I'm trying argue either way much, long able stay home mental state affected? two find compromise zoom calls friends family? Online board games pretty fun well. one friend couple guarantee other's outside interaction? Would willing make pact see other? Still outside masks course, would safest bet social time without increasing risk. NZ Vietnam done extremely well minimal lockdowns maximum mask-wearing. get couple higher quality masks (KN95s available inexpensive), increase safety individual interactions. 

It's two take information that's available decide come agreement, everyone's needs different mental health relationship weight well. clear zero risk feels like much you, ask two work together (and really good effort you) find ways satisfy needs also keeping comfort level, find end date re-evaluate restructure behave?

No Thanks. Yup. Also isn‚Äôt bunch mouthwash basically alcohol kills viruses bacteria anyway? bet thing airborne ü§´ need soften! Although think majority subs redditors crowd gets this. preach brotha! delayed, waiting publication peer review journal. Interesting though leaks results. year mid March places US. little less half year. 

Look know feels like forever guys not. 7 months year, one year two years. understand feels way feels like forever mean is. Many respiratory pandemics fade 18 months peak everywhere once. vaccine coming. hang on. think anything indoor HVAC would spread virus fast. Many HVAC cant handle efficient filter like HEPA Funny, made laugh, dunno it‚Äôs stupid not. leave important questions like know alls Australia New Zealand keep fuck idiot seppo Back May 2020 going again.

But nm, we'll keep whatever we've last 7 months. Lockdowns appropriate long time period(or second time) need economy survive virus dangerous enough convince everyone stay home accord. anything also work reduced afforementioned reduced Herd Immunity threshold.

To point 3 specifically points copied(i realize old stats current positive total 110,000) utilizing current IFR ~0.5, estimate Mississippi ~600,000 cases Covid, 21% population. Probably upwards 10,000 day peak. little higer close US average.

It would really nice statisticians giving suggestions beginning rather politicians 'masks effective' CDC. Easter like China lied. common thing would facing upper nightmare. remain positive looking wuhan, first real re-outbreak thats really virus does. solutions covid worse problem? death rate 0.00057%, 3 million flu cases even vaccines. twice many cigarette deaths covid deaths.

If employee earns normal hourly rate / hours, employer must pay anything outstanding.

There ""up to"" involved. honestly think vaccines 300+ million citizens produced rolled instantly??? vaccine mean everyone time, hence masks prevent spread amongst unvaccinated... clever.

Take precautions would bad flu season, live life. Youll get one day, youll try assault someone, chances youre american theyll fucking shoot questions.  course, one get say NYC, come bunch excuses like ""they many cases everyone immune"", ""just wait winter, saved summer"" etc.

The fact is, NYC one world's worst outbreaks anyone knew virus state/city testing capabilities. city shut solely business closures, leaving people's civil liberties tact otherwise (unlike AUS, IT, ES) brought outbreak control 2 months.

We'll see winter goes, think people eventually need admit initial performance re: Covid determines whether successful not. follow-through, like Melbourne, NZ, SK. Lots places dealt things well initially failing already failed subsequently, like California, Canada Germany. Personally tried nicotine gum success patches really seemed help. used weeks took away impulse smoke broke habit. good like three months til got weak-willed. Youre stupid fuck, bet like punching people think bully! know price victory is, I'm going enjoy win Lord knows city deserves &lt;3 


(also, lol NewsCorp forced admit something positive) I'm sorry hear this. feel you. wrestling right ourselves, one side family taking COVID deathly serious, side basically going full ""Covid hoax"". Unfortunately, basically family vs. wife's family, wife's family ear I'm controlling/borderline abusive trying keep away family, argument stickler masks extended indoor hangouts.

Stay strong, friend. We'll get this, side hope remember cared politics friends family's lives. Pfizer maybe slightly ahead expect tell effective sooner. November date meet 2 month safety data FDA requirement. Moderna expecting tell effective mid end November. It‚Äôs right though. know pandemics are. made movies wrote excellent historical scientific books them. China made lot mistakes - tell fact it‚Äôs country largely incompetent people - there‚Äôs whole cultural thing lie job pretend know figure - pulled off.

And USA like - people keep screaming everyone stop stepping dicks absolutely none even care, they‚Äôll anyway yolo. talking  Attempted murder first degree. Terrorism. Assault. There's reason get convicted three these. Ill fuck anyone lays hand me, one right touch ever do, youre responsible happens next. Except not. pretty well shown virus really going eradicated vaccine. might work months, back square 1. work restaurant/bar last two weeks seem like everyone forgot pandemic. I'm making great money... get fucking mad! Stay fuck home people! course dont want boss lose restaurant. üòÇ Seems like general consensus isn‚Äôt even consistent modes transmission airborne admit cloth mask minimal impact.  Americans, absolutely. 

And that's whole lockdown mandate versus lockdown recommendation debate regards Sweden might moot. Swedish health authorities came consistently urge voluntary lockdown voluntary mask wearing, they'd probably get tremendous compliance. Yep, that's pretty much I'm seeing too. pull intersection cars around Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Florida, Tennessee, Iowa, Missouri, etc. (are ones remember seeing). 

College students back definitely part (happens every year around time).. usually dramatic high number. unfortunately live blood red swamp-theocracy state work. Nashville metro, mask wearing times past, still half. restaurants bars open devices capacity, etc.  
I NE corner state/tri-cities area week ago. Virtually one wearing mask, restaurants packed day long weekends, parks playgrounds packed people crowded together. businesses enforcing mask usage, etc. give shit. ''hoax'' still. Knoxville too, half one way, half other. Surely Jesus come save becomes actual problem (I'm sure local presumption). Florida resident suggests scaling back governor Martime unions traditionally weak due industry decentralised. strong maritime unions USA El Paso funeral homes brace bunch money business tick up.... Unless live China one countries made deal vaccine option anyway. CDC run Trump appointee.

And shows. I'm sure work, maybe kinder method might put $100 deposit board, wear mask entire flight, get $100 back. otherwise money goes charity. would imagine vacci action proof would required start vaccinating. Personally think good thing. Crazy people think achievement. Lockdown worked - spread stopped temporarily - life resumes - lockdown 2 months?

It's vicious circle, obviously stupid nonsustainable way handling virus. can't wait see handle third wave. we‚Äôre it, let‚Äôs debate whether gravity exists not, too. 1) would love source that
2) 30 reinfections 40 million cases, really concern
3) T-cells b-cells give immunity, actual presence antibodies. Also I‚Äôm powerful man world earth words people stop anything whatsoever. It‚Äôs stupid argument. keeps saying ‚Äúthey called racist‚Äù said said that. Like little girl. Cases surging Sweden too. stayed lower level longer curve different time-period. Oh holy shit, y‚Äôall paranoid. literally said don‚Äôt know Victoria, know studies I‚Äôve read. It‚Äôs political whatsoever. Excuse me, 1 punch kill, guy almost ran wrong side road, told ""watch going dickhead"", went skate shop, way shopping complex saw confronted me, told almost ran over, told shouldnt skating road(through carpark mind you). walked away 3 times, punched face told piss off. smacked head ran, mates chased around shopping center after.

What would expect punched me? Scary headline fact hospital staff repeat plea every day half year disheartening. Yet people would find surprised facing virus like ""I thought joke"".

And guy loudest voice like ""everyone make it, worry"" infection almost come outside, means staff members brought in.

Or visitors. allowed sate presumably nursing home outbreak. Well wrong, deaths cases Sweden much lower pretty much everywhere Europe. Getting buses mixed bag even driver wearing mask. vaccines might ready several months, even go everyone least year. going take long time vaccinate whole world, that's taking account millions refuse completely. Honestly, want screenshot comment write dissertation attitude. 

Let ask, ever complained men‚Äôs mental health issues taken seriously? live North Carolina. Thanksgiving outside grilling. Reserving picnic shelter. Separate tables family. Mask socializing. Similar risk getting groceries takeout...we live that. 

Christmas going difficult. cold people hang outside long. make fire, everyone huddle around it. think Amazon gifts delivery Zoom Xmas. Yes, really be. We‚Äôll looking Summer Fall next year. combine availability mayyyyybe available year, distrust government, time takes spread actually measure well it‚Äôs working long (never mind six different versions it), we‚Äôre still long time. ourselves. mask filter valve Indeed, argument. masks used Asia cases, isn‚Äôt necessary masks reduce spread. said earlier. working theory (studies) seem translate working practice. Need studies prevention high-risk household contacts. Volunteers, evidently.  That's logical fallacy. fact is, never shut down, less deaths many countries enacted extreme measures.

Lockdowns clearly prevent deaths, preventing deaths always main goal. scary thing may countries look 6 week's time eg UK. much apples-to-oranges comparison. used Denmark, Norway, Finland comparison. :) soon get food drink plane mask think need expand airport security checks include psychological evaluations.

There reasonable explanation excuse kind behavior. Seriously - person get melt flight? Let alone one caliber? WHAT? Exactly, opposite exist either... Free last, free last!  Trump concede power decides launch nukes Mexico. is, el pa√≠s always sets titles like that. Since data provided weekends every Monday get numbers twice high regular weekday. Monday though highest number cases while, previous Mondays staying 31k. never said proof working. responded claim country telling myth working. studies I‚Äôve send evidence. would increase infection chances sadly made right call Germany, considered ""impossible"" backtrace cases, regardless infection rate.

Gotta love easily give up. Homemade masks filter coronavirus floating aerosol form. There‚Äôs evidence back suppositions. interesting nothing fails help terrible situation? Keep learning, Sweden! shows mask usage France, Spain Italy par Asia. together recent covid case data raises question wether masks effective, something else makes Asia stand Europe. dont see problem unless uni different country area high positivity rates. Read article, says phase 3 trials begun 40000 Russians. testing vaccine indians Russians Yes, could public random encounters couple social circles, could input high sensitivity overall transmission rate.  pull mask I'm chewing swallowing pull bring actual food drink mouth. guess would really hard enforce though. think faith common person. handle mask proper care (Not nose, touching it). 

But mostly engage riskier situations wearing mask. real risk could possibly negate positive effect masks general use (Not certain individuals). looked archives: learned China news late January virus transmitted aerosols, high transmission rate dispersion, transmitted people feel symptoms, standard control measures failed. April, detailed case studies spreading locations roles transmission modes.

That's got Western publications virus spread now. post this, reddit numerous articles stated exactly that, claim so. 

Perhaps also believe Q-anon story aliens taught Hollywood drink brain juice children?

Or selectively ignore science fit demands? wall face... need marketing team! That's point though. Situations masks worn situations spread quite low anyway data referring past 72 hours. Title kind misleading. recently flew British Air great. One guy near kept pulling without hesitation they'd tell put back on.

Canary Islands, 77 cases, currently 100 health system continues pressure patient numbers rising

FERNANDO SIM√ìN, DIRECTOR HEALTH MINISTRY‚ÄôS COORDINATION CENTER HEALTH ALERTS

This record number infections day ‚Äúbad sign,‚Äù according Ildefonso Hern√°ndez, spokesperson Spanish Public Health Society (Sespas). qualified view: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see happens next days. European trend going sharply upward several large countries, United Kingdom France, already surpassing us.‚Äù Spain, continued, cases rising, ‚Äúthere regions low moving toward holding steady, Madrid also holding steady. Catalonia coming days, along Madrid Andalusia, determine general trend.‚Äù warned: ‚ÄúThis virus really difficult; still lot people susceptible continue spread.‚Äù

Pedro Gull√≥n, member Spanish Society Epidemiology, pointed Spain has, time, high incidence phase rises falls. current wave, added, appears ‚Äúmore consistent time‚Äù ‚Äúwe doubt see rises falls lot territorial differences.‚Äù explained: ‚ÄúIt appears reach maximum cases fall; go plateau rises falls; rise.‚Äù

Fernando Sim√≥n, director Health Ministry‚Äôs Coordination Center Health Alerts (CCAES), said Monday night presented latest data, Spain progressing ‚Äúas well would like.‚Äù Last week government‚Äôs chief epidemiologist talking stabilization pandemic Spain. yesterday called incidence ‚Äúvery high‚Äù said ‚Äúa small rising trend,‚Äù similar registered rest Europe.

However, Sim√≥n underscored rise cases Spain slow progressive, dynamic countries multiplication cases factor two three question two weeks. ‚ÄúI would like think go slower,‚Äù said, taking granted infections continue grow. ‚ÄúIt expected rise incidence winter, don‚Äôt take account prevention measures.‚Äù

According Monday‚Äôs report, 459 Covid-19 related deaths detected last seven days
Fernando Sim√≥n also expressed concern hospital figures. risen rapidly, mean ‚Äúthe health system continues pressure [patient numbers] rising, problems mean.‚Äù CCAES director explained age range biggest rise incidence detected 10 19, pointed high detection level positive cases, 40 45% cases asymptomatic. fatality rate continues fall, added, currently 3.5%, compared 12.3% seen start pandemic.

‚ÄúWe tired now,‚Äù said Sim√≥n, reference restrictions number regions place months. also called individual responsibility, citizens comply rules ‚Äúwith even greater care‚Äù winter approaching. This, said, would ‚Äúavoid other, restrictive [measures] would bigger social economic impact.‚Äù

The cold weather, epidemiologist Pedro Gull√≥n explained, ‚Äúcould see us take activities indoors, greater risk, apart also increasing number cases similar seasonal diseases, flu winter respiratory viruses, could overwhelm primary care system laboratories even share symptoms Covid.‚Äù

If nobody saying this, discussing article debunking statement? used one tenth budget US military, could feed house every single American citizen month two months would take finally end disease within borders nation. could done taxpayers money - already given away - used fight war Covid, instead buying broken planes Boeing.

Two months serious effort would take, likely less. nations already achieved - New Zealand Vietnam, example. 

America surely cannot wretched pathetic cannot equal Vietnam New Zealand, it?

Can it? Sweden fully 10 times worse direct neighbours Norway Finland due lax measures. think anyone using Sweden model things. I'm wearing mask someone else dramatically walk avoid bend away waist, scrunching face. I've noticed puts people majorly least I'm able somewhat publically shame them.  means probably less 30%, prevalence food supply workers low time. soon high risk people able take vaccine, done caring virus.

You really not. dangerous way thinking. ... ith number deaths meaningfully different average preceding 5 years. 

Source this? understanding excess death rate Sweden largely *returned* normal, mean significant period excess deaths substantially expected. 

Regardless, Sweden's *official* Covid-19 death count puts per capita performance world's bottom 10%. Sweden prosperous, developed nation. 

So even death stats year average purport, rather saved preventable Covid-19 deaths Sweden could decidedly *better* average year? That‚Äôs chain logic Anders Tegnell, Sweden's state epidemiologist, said ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù believe masks could make ‚Äú**huge difference**‚Äù fight Covid-19. 

This true though? said help, situation location sufficient proof would make difference moment. Mask debaters love mask debate.



They've convinced things simple elementary school science would prove wrong. proudly spout like intelligent thought. Male line Stiller forgetting lines Duchovny improvised retort!&lt; masks everywhere

They masks parties, work &amp; home, they? Yeah. It'll get approved monetary gain. Remember oxycontin marketed non addictive? think read last sentence post says both? barely mutates severely proofreads genetic code Nice try, nobody stupid enough fall it. fuss nothing achieving 'herd immunity' natural way - letting people die millions. fuss about, anyone reading comment would know that. know that. attempt failed. Oh wish people would Midwest.

You can't even get half idiots live wear mask.

I live apartment building 41 units way. got elevator months I'm terrified. wonder study sink source control. Man, took 6 7 months try enforce this. absolute mad lads. testing million people day, that‚Äôs highest we‚Äôve ever tested claim masks work country using masks low infection.

But Italy, Spain France using masks high infection proof?

Well logiced sir. Germany actually pretty good I've read far. Gesundheits√§mter (local health ministries) consistently reaching every known person contact confirmed patients figure symptoms not.

The Robert Koch Institute details here: German think website translated youre phone. china brewed virus months killed millions could grow economy rest world struggles. Shit luck every state apart Victoria, dunno large weddings though. think there's law hugging friends, long done outdoors. article talking refusal people wear masks; nothing actual effectiveness masks. article also 3 months old. science knowledge almost nothing, question.

If know agree virus enters lot nose, mouth etc. covering help? 

We also agree saliva carries virus others, cover help? labs run 40,000 tests day Belgium can't keep up. takes 2 3 days get results backlog... longer 'conspiracy theory' :) need treat China, treat front line vulnerable first treat next line, virus reduces get vaccinated herd immunity develops New Zealand Australia (including problematic state Victoria) halfway there, they've (continuous) lockdowns significantly less 8 months. point is, take serious measures, hard measures, adequate period, resume life approximating normal much earlier. Check China, Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia, etc., etc. 

Milquetoast half measures get perpetual lockdown experience. I'd say Sweden's response arguably king half measures (probably window dressing veiled herd immunity strategy). Surprisingly, inordinately high preventable deaths earlier, Sweden fairly well recent (and hope continues.) absolute latest signs indicate possible beginnings resurgence, media even Sweden considering actual lockdown type measures now. 

I think Sweden adopting lockdowns would put end debate whether earlier measures correct appropriate. studies say masks don‚Äôt work. magic recipe according Reddit: long, hard lockdowns + masks everywhere. 
We seen happen Italy Spain. help, wonder? ‚ÄúSerious‚Äù mean body ache. Chill. both? Arizona-based website's flu chart look like seasonality. virus less infectious summer, means less initial viral load means less worse outcomes.

The reverse going true head fall winter. Uh live Asia. never shut down. didn‚Äôt need restart. lowest infection rates. wear masks. know considered assault spit someone. mean hit back considered self defense get trouble? Lol every year flu shot. Nothing new. 4 United flights recently. people masks every single one. watched flight attendants entire conversations couple guys without even mentioning masks chin/forehead. one case people still boarding really could've removed plane. 
A people saw; one guy would remove mask every time needed cough, two ladies conversation would pull mask speaking, one lady ate sucker entire flight mask never on. 
The thing United make announcement keep mask enforced all. That's good article. mention masks, say may important electronic medical records Perhaps important element Taiwan‚Äôs deliberate, systematic use digital health key avoiding massive, economically ruinous lockdowns effective testing, isolation, contact tracing control viral spread. Taiwan‚Äôs innovative electronic health records system made possible country‚Äôs swift, targeted response Covid-19. Although system designed stop pandemic, nimble enough reoriented toward one.

I wish people passionate sacrificing privacy robust electronic healthcare masks.  REDDIT. Brought constant fucking virus propaganda. get it... wear mask Trump evil... almost getting bad Twitter except bunch anonymous hairy eared weirdos wish could pullup. Sweden 4 times many cases Finland lockdown. think use ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù bad wording. means Sweden virtually real lockdown without mandating one. 

Tegnell even boss agency certainly minister. He‚Äôs state epidemiologist. Swedish ""strategy"" managing people much COVID-19. well good mandate demand mask adherence people still suck difference make?

Work have, want. üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ masks working myth perpetuaded health authorithies make scared people leave homes restart economies affected countries.

The Swedish position masks work all. (Obviously since used health care settings)

Its staying home works better masks. American style social credit score? :S Folkh√§lsomyndigheten != Tegnell ... yeah :( is, misunderstanding he's saying.

Nobody denying masks *work*, terms technical top pandemic expert claimed ‚Äúvery weak‚Äù evidence mask wearing society effective.

That's context, far seem like outlandish claim based we're seeing. Critical thinking involves questioning sources information, something people subreddit.  ""herr derr Fauci rules! Stay home stay safe!"" ignore everything else cuz like miserable want everyone else too. No, it‚Äôs 10x bigger don‚Äôt know percentages work. üòÇ post political? literally citing happened, matter opinion. question not? 

At least trust American company. really need remember put /s!

I'd still say goal getting young people infected, method would better. would lead goal reached fast minimal damage rest population. need kill manually then. new trend studies say stuff like, ""7 23 times likely""?

You mean giving range account different variables instead giving single meaningless value? work Idaho time co-workers masked customers. keep trying tell masks ""stranger danger"" situation. 

I exceptionally grateful door office keep closed stay masked day. cringe make public appearance help resetting password something. literally worst get called cover receptionist few. go mask face shield like I'm one taking seriously. 

Of states work pandemic, Idaho sucks. you. Unfortunately going run hospital beds process. Enjoy flu/ covid season, freeman! Schools closed. Restaurants go pick up. Bars closed. Gyms closed. Otherwise pretty status quo. Grocery stores packed. businesses still open person due 17+ industries allowed open ""essential business"". restrictions enforced people visiting eachother. Assuming Biden wins, see another quarantine come February? I'm thinking like that's given. Assuming wins course. mean that? feel like every time someone attempts show reality, get ton people crying ""fear porn"" media ""alarmist"". Truly amazing time alive. look like this

10/21/2020: FL new cases per million: 130

10/28/2020: Nothing new report, we're fine, ol' ol'

11/4/2020: FL new cases per million: 750 agree disagree Ireland doing? sore throat inflamed tonsil. manifested within 12 hours friend largely symptoms: sore throat, slight muscle ache, fatigue, headache (though I've headaches on/off weeks) yesterday briefly noticed slight wheeze taking masked walk outside. saw indoors enclosed location four days prior. Think get test? I'm staying isolated apartment regardless meantime. Anyone else glad US once... think can‚Äôt really make point hasn‚Äôt also failure basically every level government. I‚Äôm trying say government state local administration handled anything well, I‚Äôm saying locking country fully point unrealistic would keep covid someone traveled US another country, point would probably right back community spread. populous clearly interested wide scale masking. complaints still can‚Äôt seem find good ideas. 

Why much armchair quarterbacking? many ‚Äúfairy tale‚Äùtype rhetorical threads ‚Äúthis buffoon politician‚Äôs someone side president none would happened.‚Äù

It‚Äôs old honestly matter political slant is.

The ‚Äútruth‚Äù you‚Äôre told relies solely two factors... look party‚Äôs current approved narrative is. 

That‚Äôs what‚Äôs dangerous, FUMBLINGS BUFFOONS! don‚Äôt care side you‚Äôre governing politicians wear team‚Äôs logo made many mistakes team, shouting suck solves nothing devolves conversation. 

It‚Äôs almost like, there‚Äôs team rooting COVID win perspective reinforced. 

I see sports fans time. Punching stadium parking lots instead walking together, interested others‚Äô perspectives. 

No. yell ‚Äúyour team sucks‚Äù ask constantly respective broods ‚Äúnobody likes team right? idiots right? know best right?‚Äù 

Jesus wonder nothing gets done. 

A bunch us going around screaming ‚ÄúI‚Äôm helping‚Äù middle fingers anyone opposing political perspective helping. 

Context erodes immediately face facts threaten narrative. Whatever narrative is. Why? can‚Äôt keep context still hold political beliefs. It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúNew England Patriots suck‚Äù better team like. 

IT HELPING. 

Ever stop think minute COVID seems downstream politics COVID information awash party‚Äôs approved messaging??

It‚Äôs reason paralyzed. can‚Äôt find common ground. Why? 

It means put work find common ground ‚Äúyou‚Äôre ok working racist nazi‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre ok working old man late stage dementia‚Äù since juicy chunks sensational nonsense fueling campaign efforts politicians used audience. 

Don‚Äôt believe me? Watch this... 

1.3 million people die year automobile fatalities completely beyond control gruesome fatalities never used campaign reduce amount time spend behind wheel. reinforce driver safety mandating testing awareness reflexes. We‚Äôve never required mandatory vehicle safety inspections make sure compliant. fact doesn‚Äôt even get mentioned. peep. Something completely within control. Deaths - orders magnitude - gruesome tragic escalating flu survivability rate 99.9% anyone 50. 

This matters, you‚Äôve finished reading it‚Äôs already gone mind utility pointing another team sucks right? inconvenient context ignored let‚Äôs move on...

This hysteria real. live head firmly rooted sands political party‚Äôs battle cry help carry crusade whatever f*ck means seek find common ground people dwell somewhere zone common sense, courtesy decency without single political figure giving direction.

If you‚Äôre brave, peek behind curtain opposing political party‚Äôs messaging. You‚Äôll see vast majority hospitals county nobody them, remarkable change operation all. 

Yes stories ‚Äúbad‚Äù exist watching get used like pawns hate others stories us afraid of. 

Find common ground around you. Work together what‚Äôs right what‚Äôs politically expedient IMHO. ü§úüèºü§õüèΩ it‚Äôs coincidence you‚Äôre parroting fellow conservatives also calling ‚Äúdraconian lockdown‚Äù? Surreee. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs learned from. Actually could definite possibility I‚Äôd forgot about. don‚Äôt exactly type ‚Äúsummers‚Äù allow consistent outdoor socialising.... mostly clicks. literally protests it!!

Have tried Zoom? Trump refusing promote one single damaging things happened. could even made money it. ICU, Ventilator, Death damned Oh sure! denigrating nurses. wonderful, intelligent people incredibly difficult work. mom‚Äôs nurse! It‚Äôs mind-numbing clearly know better flout masks yet anyway. still remember Binaca burn cinnamon flavor. deleted realised posted 123 times. Apparently well received r/science. either side obviously meant world population. hope tests count flu covid. general consensus point? Gradual restrictions vs lockdown everything? Yeah, whole bunch states screwed Agreed. Busting Ouija board shrooms, candles mirrors salt incantations, getting proper scared Halloween, feasting Thanksgiving, binging substances Christmas New Year‚Äôs it‚Äôll fun. thing protests going past months, many heat/peak pandemic.  irresponsible. 


BUT studies said contribute infection rate outside helps reduce risk ALOT, even protestors packed like sardines, yelling often maskless. sure fully buy many people do, knows, may right risk low outside, feel need odds 100% things life are. 


As said, irresponsible view (especially people socialize higher risk) ""get it"" confident op family get covid due wearing masks outside Yes agree 7 months people wired last long without social interaction.

 People quarantining careful going start reaching think blame them. Shutdowns politically poisonous might provoke armed reaction, that's bad Step mom moved nights got extra $1 well. That's already night shift location. wrong? Ideally people would neither enormous burden. still know ton people wash hands using bathroom wear eye protection using power tools. state GOP lost lawsuit yesterday trying strike Democratic governor's mask mandate.

On grounds? state nearly unlimited powers deal public health crises see fit. power manifest executive (governor, president, etc). 

I know absurd rules would judge strike down, truly difficult overstate that. Question everybody: think people know posting pictures surrounded people bars events? Oh damn well know they're sitting restaurant eating way early diabetes, they're laughing anyone walks mask on. frustrating.   Exponential growth exponential way majority states people get fucking clue. Barring Charles Koch somehow changing minds government response think pretty unlikely end well. realize we'll one vaccine, right? positivity rate good indicator testing effectiveness. 
This reassuring, finally good news.

Any idea cases going down? tracing getting better people afraid &amp; careful now? something else? Source, troll? Yes know, older people likely suffer younger people. fair isolate older people. need careful respect elders risky things giving virus. scared, relatives great, beginning hang outdoors, masks, eating drinking...  Hillary golf, runs satanic child sex cult kills eats babies DC pizzaria basement. /s Yeah it‚Äôs pretty bad Quebec. brothers business shut tried kill himself, many people lost jobs working . don‚Äôt know people 225,000 0.00057% population.

Lol, isn‚Äôt genius. .00057% 330M 1,881. üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You might want revisit math percentages. also causes nothing overwhelming majority cases. also worth risk go help people struggling community . plenty initiatives trying help, like fiid banks. Though much people worrying starving kids maybe need hands. Yes truly good news. Pineapple pizza affront humanity. last time flew March, right everything started hit fan. first leg Delta flight, re-organized seating, spread everyone ""premium"" cheap seats added social distancing. next leg, piled everyone back, leaving seats empty... two us claimed row, others same.

To credit, attendants say anything new arrangements.

We flew back United, even got bumped first class asked politely. mixed bag matter fly seems. No, understand all. Apologies. made comment co worker txted ask set covid test. guess it‚Äôs beginning Ferrer noted people 18 49 account 58% new COVID-19 cases county. 

What terms percentage population? would bet 18-49 age group makes nearly 50% LA population, it‚Äôs probably slightly represented.

Edit: 20-49 year olds account 46% LA (city) population. Add 18 19 year olds you‚Äôre virtually 50% population. 

So 50% population account 58% cases? notable, considering that‚Äôs going primary age essential workers. Republican majority, surprise surprise. cant remove politics US bc admin treated polticial crisis, public health crisis. can't even stop politicizing something simple wearing masks. Unsurprisingly death toll reflects that. 

Perhaps time get cronies like Scott Atlas picture let actual experts try salvage situation. title means ""record"" highest reported number (as new record) Could find coworker. Thats thinking doing. husband essential one coworkers child age ours. We've considering making bubble since work together anyways risk seems same. people stopped traveling. idea working well Europe North America. bring collapse riots common thing time goes think deeper that. Democracies judge leaders objective performance, judge perceived performance [it's well heroically fixing problem showers glory preventing problem brings disdain.

Oh please. constant poo pooing democracies really getting old. 

First South Korea, Japan Taiwan fully functioning liberal democracies. like western democracies. 

Second, western democracies problem making sacrifices first second world wars. made way sacrifices ever today. 

Third China, country definitely democracy, also played perception game. China covered virus long time.

There plenty signs virus likely emerged sometime China aware covered November became difficult ignore. claimed came nowhere. 

Fourth seeing Western countries, specifically United States, cultural (not political) trend emerged 1960s authority. emerged intially hippie movement civil rights movement evolved something else. 

Western Society gone 1920s many times. Usually [crisis bring society conformist direction eventually breakdown conformity becomes oppressive toward class people. I‚Äôm Los Angeles county lots clients nurses MAJOR hospitals inside LA.

They told don‚Äôt see much corona virus patients ones die elderly severe pre-existing conditions.

I wonder Reddit articles dont reflect reality ... Restrictions happen instantly. Aid not. live unicorn magic land. 10s millions children poverty compare hundreds thousands people. 500k people die cigarettes year. care them? im illinois governor expected announce rollback restrictions again, since early summer. full lockdown, going back shutting certain industries limiting interaction. there's threat 'we'll continue amp restrictions things go way want to' ‚ÄúWinter coming‚Äù cringe kindly ask say stop fucking right 3 weeks instead piecemeal crap appeasing babies can't civic duty month it'd done now.

It's people refused anything first place (and continue so) making prolonged.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* PAY Sweden sees sudden zero cases every weekend, report it. Trump woke feeling like haven‚Äôt alienated world enough yet covid deniers dying? like young people catching spreading old folks, may may deniers. covid deniers among young less likely die it. luxury deniers.

Right group likely get coronavirus least likely die it. gets guns marches around public threatening violence anytime there's anything like happening?

Not Democrats. I‚Äôm saying real lockdown unrealistic asking would look like. agree many places classified essential may essential early summer lockdown. would see resolved? make classification essential not? job, manufacturing company, essential? industry certainly is, without people essential may able get paid accurately. Then, essential, manager?

It‚Äôs shitty situation without real solution. want say ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù help us, that‚Äôs cool, trying determine exactly would entail. nothing, seriously doubt Biden elected COVID goes away instantly.

Because anyone complete moron. I‚Äôm also science based field wearing mask following recommended precautions since started üòéüòé almost like marijuana medicinal. Ruling class sacrifice million workers let stock market die. Florida lockdowns. government intervention state effort reduce deaths. they're still better New York without lockdowns. I‚Äôm simply stating old information well received first time large number clients. Pretty much news older week gets removed sub. really want spend time stores necessary though? understand aren‚Äôt major source, given many Karens Todds wandering around refusing mask continue spread public picked party went Target. also saw post I'm going get Trump discussion you, whether masks effective nothing Trump. I'm hand washing good hygiene, always good regardless whether pandemic not.

No, opinions carry weight choose ignore science. Forcing mandates serve cause division already divided society terrible idea. want wear mask go it, moan people act like science regarding ineffectiveness masks, is. fucking ridiculous lengths FHM goes justify inaction.

Its ridicoulous lengths willing go show Sweden bad light.

I'm sure something back viewpoint time....

ETA: guy spent months spring/summer claiming Swedens deaths going looked like Sweden hiding remember homemade graphs everything. live Wisconsin. Last weekend went restaurant/bar pick take parents. guy stopped door told something face pointing cheek. genuinely thought nice brushed mask thinking something it. kept insisting still something finally took mask look it. goes ‚ÄúThere go, keep damn thing go damn fun.‚Äú 

Some people special breed stupid. instead calling heroes

Didn't Republicans Michigan actively sling slurs one anti-mask protests? call ‚Äòheroes‚Äô don‚Äôt want hard work endangering them. Ditto service workers meat plant operators sucker working ‚Äòessential‚Äô job sign spinner. People need stop buying blatant propaganda. Right, SVT reported it:  unwilling accept data New York beginning pandemic different data completely reopened Florida today, worth arguing with. Incredibly, many PSAs ***following EXACT strategy 7 consecutive months now!***

Simple rule life: working, try something different. people messaging PSAs following rule. Wake sheeple, Big Local Restaurant Big Farmer's Market trying get bow corporate overlords think hospitals normally like?

People die time....?

These people, old weak everyone else said already: recommendations. 

Allow give personal reflection. Swede, thought initial response way lax Swedish equivalent CDC, called FHM. close everything down? Pull hazmat suits? Weld doors buildings infections? I‚Äôm half joining. 

I thinking something could fought couple months really hard restrictions lockdowns. super critical handled here. 

As time passed, learned appreciate time scale operating at. FHM said along marathon, sprint. someone told March would restrictions recommendations year, would told exaggerating doomsday person. lot. 

Not anymore. 

The long term view sustainability recommendations restrictions key. doesn‚Äôt matter much hard lockdown first three months open everything up. virus find eventually. Better measures flatten curve rather try eradicate virus. Better measures people accept couple years, rather months. It‚Äôs classic optimisation game really...

But really interesting part. ‚Äúlax‚Äù recommendations restrictions really made treat virus respect would harsher measures. Thinking FHM downplayed crisis made buy face masks, hand sanitizer, protective goggles, even couple hazmat‚Äôish suits. kept kids school worked 100% home. Didn‚Äôt see friends family. 

If hard lockdown month two fines, outdoor exercise police street, would probably careful today, almost 8 months thing. 

Just rambling reflection Swede living Sweden times. move now. :-) Oh crap! one, too! Looks like ""*Negative imaginary Internet points entered chat*"".  

Hee hee hee! Anecdote time! hospital area number traveling nurses filling out-sick original staff. regular nurse makes like $30/hr. traveling nurse makes $90/hr. 

They want test regular staff to. Tried get frozen broccoli Costco wasn‚Äôt available app offered... popcorn. Luckily able decline wat. vegetables, guess? say ""safe"", think we've found common ground. stated, everyone needs find best way maintain semblance normalcy. Yes, know people would yell eating inside restaurant, love so, I'm always keeping aware test positivity rate area. soon hits 5% I'll stop. Nothing completely safe right now, trying achieve safety exercise futility. Title bit misleading could make people think masks worn everyone, 1918 flu ""eradicated"". Truth Flu mutated became one various seasonal flu viruses circulates every year. Could huge HIPAA violation since obviously can't trust people use properly. stay home instead?

And course, trust stay home follow FHM's recommendations law... unless mask involved, case they'll suddenly ignore FHM's recommendations can't trusted...

It's fucking ridiculous lengths FHM goes justify inaction. I'm sure Swedish great read recommendations directly Swedish source filtered foreign media slanted towards viewpoint agree with. Silently, that... Yeah, getting someone else deliver groceries putting virus burden someone else. one system would net benefit curbside delivery employees it, since would store anyway regardless choosing shop there. Bullshit excuses. second thought watching Saturday Night Live Shhh...

Don‚Äôt spoil joke. Either way comes regional festivals ... Brace folks not. fact.

and feel sorry people. help anything. I‚Äôm going say - people deny virus exists impede recovery jailed. Dang! Minus nine! Looks like ""*the train downvote city entered chat*""   

Hee hee hee! Ask anti-maskers they're comfortable big family parties exchange wearing masks. literally We've got around 2000 new cases 21'000 tampons, little less 10% positivity rate. 
About condition, giant mess. live Milan, tested contact someone later found positive COVID; first all, go own: nobody called me, friend, private tampon around 10 days ago, never, ever called Ats, public health service regarding COVID. 
So yeah, went wait 6 hours get tested. 6 hours packed lot strangers waiting. embarassing: everything disorganized. disappointing, pathetic. 
Our numbers bad compared others, disorganization Italy always serious issue, still is. feeling sorry till last sentence. fan demeaning sexist. That's fine. me. I'm following gut instinct one, telling take precaution, will. sure things extra precautions (not even COVID) necessary, still minimize risk. Everyone's risk assessment precaution-taking different every situation.

Taking extra precautions thing believing science take precautions. wiping packages groceries come home harming anyone (it could help) whereas people believing masks effective different story harming others following guidelines. Bottom line: taking extra precautions could help, taking less precautions could hurt. discipline shit? Can't sell ""what learned military""? Reminds dead possum house one sine reads ""killed covid!"" sine reads ""blm, Biden Likes Miners!"" every time hear blm think sine's, like song can't get head! wish could take seriously, Americans ignorant jackasses we‚Äôd never able come together country beat virus WH: 'Nope, part plan.' update? Sad thing people arent paying attention taking seriously now, wont hospital staff asks to.

In city friend who's girlfriend got COVID. symptoms convinced didnt it. gave two best friends symptoms, went back work day getting positive test. lost respect thought heard this. Dumb ignorant people piss off, around. kind people tired wearing masks dont care reality situation. havnt paid attention case numbers since ""lockdown"" happened. moved lives. lack ppe something Trump could fix (even competent).

[Man people short memory. says states secure medical supplies, federal government outbidding states confiscating supplies House adviser Jared Kushner‚Äîwho, head government's coronavirus response, told Trump governors were¬†exaggerating¬†the impact outbreak‚Äîis making similar arguments. told reporters federal stockpile emergency medical supplies¬†wasn't states residents anyway, saying one press briefing, ""The notion federal stockpile it‚Äôs supposed stockpile; it‚Äôs supposed state stockpiles use."" thought politicians bad influence. article rather sparse, tell us much historian's methodology. see claims make corrupt. decent salary protects corruption would say. would worried free... Request denied. going wear outside dare cops something it. Cops want nothing mask. great American, freedom wear mask. works best all.

Apparently despite months bullshit FHM, Swedish people really *can't* trusted follow recommendations.

At least, that's FHM's latest argument... Wind absolutely change surface temperature. think people blow hot foods? oxygen temperature you‚Äôre blowing changes temperature temperature differentiation. Yeahh theyre overblown!! help epilepsy normal arthritis, help stabilize parkinson's tremors, dementia. epilepsy dont really know helps correlation able act similarly protein would help neurons brain act normally instead getting overactive, may also helps Parkinsons tremors. Neat stuff Good news? early tell Even time emptiest, cringiest gesture thanks. might well country started handing resin plaques people. want thank worker give money PTO. GTFO Kendall Jenner Pepsi activism bullshit. Florida currently better deaths/day NY: Florida deaths given day New York since partway June.

You continually ignore confounding variable New York hit hardest beginning pandemic. They've better since. I'm even going try argue anymore clearly reading struggle basic statistics literacy. ever heard pretty big place called ASIA? many asian countries use masks consideration others. It‚Äôs taken global pandemic us inconsiderate Americans realize wearing mask common practice, even over. Fuck off.  yep. move, take anymore. plus winter sucks. women are...built. Swedish government afraid Swedish people would ignore recommendation maintain social distancing even wearing mask?

I reject basic premise lack recommebdation towards social use masks fear. wish people actually cared others, beyond scope. reality happen often, interferes comfort convenience.

As species easy time sight mind.
Take phones example, know plenty kids suffer build us still them. Maybe donate dollar two cleanse soul change, call change. us, children, friends families children.
Same logic applied here.

I'm saying high horse, I'm like everyone else. Wisconsin resident fox valley here, getting ridiculous. work small business STILL tell least 5 6 people every day put mask walk in, cause apparently can't see big bright sign door. Sick college kids sneaking quarantine go bars parties. SHUT EVERYTHING PLEASE.   never said otherwise. Halloween causes influx ER trauma patients, too. Concerning already strained facility facing covid case increase, plus usual Halloween spike Clearly source Reddit even reading post. rest case. Jerome Adams also said coming week would ‚Äúthe hardest saddest Americans‚Äô lives,‚Äù likening projected loss life ‚Äúour Pearl Harbor moment, 9/11 moment.‚Äù

The problem said April 5. Wisconsin roughly 200 covid deaths month.

So, maybe person dying every night hospital.

I believe that's norm hospital. Yeah guys super weird. want everyone make money billionaires die. There‚Äôs two choices He's troll says alarmist crap start skeptic circlejerks. MTG Pokemon cards thank much welcome go mask free want comfort home. public, wear mask indoors, outdoors cannot maintain 6 feet distance.

Behavior public always subject regulation interests maintaining safety order. let drink vodka park naked. mean people sub? HUGE authoritarianism certainly reject quality science fit pre-chosen narrative. Meanwhile company based Wisconsin longer enforces masks locations across Midwest, WI. 

The whole state needs quarantined like, weeks ago. Lol walmart subbed half gallon sour cream instead chicken last time ordered. like....fucking what?? Krajci health minister, prime. CBD absorbed surrounding tissue? Ingesting CBD would close could get OTC forms? kinda time line taking here... mean eventually everyone dies. odds anti masker dying covid pretty damn low would expect die anytime soon.  Even reddest parts Wisconsin vote 25-40 percent Democratic. live alongside people happily infect them. want russian chinese one tbh.  
American-approved seems kind sus cuts regulation vaccine safety. JSON-line Exactly, case missed there's thing called coronavirus that's killing people. would absolutely effing raging medic (I obviously), hard work, sacrifice, seeing people DIE watch, many it‚Äôs incomprehensible, people aren‚Äôt taking thing seriously. I‚Äôm one making claims, show things normal soon vaccine might work comes out.

I also never said ‚Äúthrough 2022‚Äù. I‚Äôve read, it‚Äôs going linger then, especially people like popping bullshit. hilariously accurate way describing sub thinks people approach pandemic. liberal agenda right? Swedish government afraid Swedish people would ignore recommendation maintain social distancing even wearing mask?

I thought Swedes could trusted follow recommendations? state Illinois, get military hiring preference state jobs. entry level jobs state government pay almost nothing. all, many veterans jobs, seem understand rules best: 1. Read cannot do. 2. Read do. 3. Figure gray area allows get job done. Yeah, honestly, long term economic impact scares most. silly. archaic language, meant race man human species, gender.

They men time, negatives positives entails. Deniers take proof they're wrong spin proof they're right. It‚Äôs October. 1.1mil deaths. he‚Äôs still saying it‚Äôs serious. imagine like listening pseudo intellectualism like Joe ROgan Jordan Peterson. r/woosh never switched back probably never will. convenient less agonizing going market. *clears throat* 

LET‚ÄôS

FUCKING 

GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO guidelines unsustainable.

Humans social creatures harm done keeping people cooped home.


Coronavirus severe, however severe burden medical system. Maybe ""Making America Great Again"" ""Making Americans Willing Wear Masks Again."" Lol, literally one employees gets sick working, authorities find place business go extra mile ensure safety workers, shut down. business wants shut days, that's huge loss. reason corps taking seriously pockets, better believe still give actual damn well working man. Hes acknowledging old goddy boy enough protect him. loser. Cheersgiving* narrative shifts blame young, wait till stock market takes hit boomers get hit 401ks üòÖ Hellofend.com site company Thanks sharing that. Unfortunate administration strict clock rules.

I guess pandemic everyone bit sensitive. say though, European countries hard lockdowns ‚Äúdid correctly‚Äù say sharply rise locking again? sounds like didn‚Äôt matter would position right now. yes people feel hopeless they‚Äôre losing lively hoods struggling keep homes put food table every time lock again. It‚Äôs really fact get assistance government. can‚Äôt keep locking without continued assistance federal government.  I've read exact opposite. Seems lot conflicting evidence yet forcing people wear masks many good reason to. Surely conclusive effective would much evidence contrary, hey people sub want accept w/e self-worth seems hang belittling others. I'm sorry life hard you. demanding compassion even willing give yourself. believe struggle real, constantly discarding disrespecting others never let feel less alone. problem worried about, begin with? I'm going keep exchange going use attack groups people sympathy for. seems like maybe feel like thrown life away. therefore life meaning. hope find respite. Good luck. reason MIS-A (C)? Read text know it... Imagine watching stuff happen every day hearing President call hoax. Can't imagine anger would feel. Well...not really dumbest die infect smart. guys winter weather already?

It's always winter Thanksgiving there?

Never Tuberculosis killed 1,500,000 people last year. didnt care? mask? something like 5 cases re-infection. statistically relevant. let summer. Thanksgiving going kill 10,000+ would avoidable summer decompress. socially point. beginning tried to, viable go 6 months 2 years social interaction.

It may viable some, many. husband seen anyone else person since March. weekly hang outs friends virtually, occasionally we'll people come say hi windows, that's it. many supplemental ways connect people, major issue keeping this. Inb4 anyone screams ‚ÄúNo one saying that!!!‚Äù Fauci said numerous times now. people think that, obviously meant guests. swear, people try misinterpret things.  Nah making false claims evidence. Sigh, hear waiting test cause felt little iffy yesterday... going work unless I‚Äôm sure. Gonna week pay complete ass. hospitals need put start putting bodies outside everybody see least something symbolizes it. I'm seeing argument hundreds thousands need die give food-insecure kids aid several months save both. ""I'm ok that"" isnt substantiated reasoning. wholeheartedly agree points. going question FDA's review, think actual experienced independent regulatory review experts job.

I think academic pediatrician going know find data discrepancies vendor data transmissions source documentation. pediatrician going understand good manufacturing practices see vaccines manufactured properly review shipment logs temperature excursion issues. pediatrician well versed code federal regulations regulate human experimentation?

The FDA review end results trials, audit review data even generated first place ensure statistical conclusions even trusted.

If 30,000 participants, FDA spot inspect hospitals clinics around world ensure participants real data made everything conducted properly ethically. know small team going manage something like that. Lol, blaming schools? like blame government.  


I see people hating schools/institutions Asia countries. contact sports governor banned them?

Schools safely reopened proper precautions, sorry children's school reckless busing contact sports. veteran myself, you‚Äôd surprised little anyone really cares served. might well even put served infantry resume doesn‚Äôt necessarily apply field(web development), can‚Äôt really say it‚Äôs ever helped tangible way tell.

Sure, get discounts like 5% certain companies, family doesn‚Äôt bring girlfriends/friends. Personally, would rather forget myself, point told means much employers people general served; it‚Äôs really make feel better themselves.

At least, that‚Äôs always figured it. Like, someone saluted came feeling good patriotic. that‚Äôs far meeting relationship anyone gone based around time service. It‚Äôs distant memory impacts life little good, even try use experience better life (get job instance).

I often hear college grads say diploma feels worthless can‚Äôt get decent paying jobs. Well, that‚Äôs exactly feel. Even though led fire team, took care 4 soldiers beneath me, earned medals commendations, passed hundreds inspections, etc etc - seemed apply military itself. Nothing (except learned myself) transferred real life. ""But never seen nothin' like you"" Yes chaotic. rushing decisions without considering impact.

As said, idea, realization. could really cause harm. hope companies provide paid drive tests.  Anti-maskers documented reported health insurance providers denied coverage. horror stories start coming financially crippled refused wear mask virus go away. One thing Republicans understand threat losing money. also lose priority event hospital capacity running low. world healthcare, biggest objective reason don‚Äôt publicly funded universal healthcare.

When ‚Äúprofit‚Äù motive get CEOs take massive pay, meaning less care, hospitals insurance companies deciding provide life saving treatment, leading worse results, quite literally see.

Profits belong things, healthcare. Remember suppose October? :( dad told two nights ago masks work. Yep, riding whole thing small city apartment, super fun, let tell (rolls eyes). Right, concerned different cause death every year right?

There pandemic every wear mask social distance every flu season?

Covid orders magnitude deadly flu, yet still stay home I'm sick flu season wash hands go way tell people eat better obesity heart disease kills?

People care about? Yes, absolutely do. worried last year? Oh right, nothing, news!

There new disease outbreak last year killed 200 thousand people 7 months. Again, silly, changing worried based new information rational human behavior. dont sure, gives idea locked since March. find curious states open usual wonder virus running rampant They've even taken antebellum style new [OO hall going plantation, ya know! geographic/cultural issue though. easier find mask compliance educated urban areas rural Arkansas, instance  Eau Claire here. fine well. I've made much aware state whole throughout pandemic honestly shocked majority state handling things poorly considered Mississippi/Alabama North. EC area atleast handling things well. Great mask compliance, Biden signs everywhere. people know doctors ‚ÄúUrge people take coronavirus seriously‚Äù 

Been saying since March fucks. half-assed theory (read assumption) feel like long enough *haven't* experienced COVID close lost lot fear default. lot cases think *because* cautious beginning *didn't* close encounter.

A lot people know super cautious serious beginning really started slip let guards down. anti-mask, ""but muh rights"" protest thing... think they've slipped false sense security without even fully realizing it. Vigilance hard keep working feels safer become less vigilant. agree far worse different reason. Covid one wants coughed gain anything coughing someone. HIV STD, horrible would knowingly infect people, unless rape least problem transmission disease actual act. Ignorance, like fact sooooo much smarter they! lol read article hundreds thousands 30 year olds got virus quickly recovered. It‚Äôs clear day American culture gone sour point people literally don‚Äôt care happening. else said? Unless start death parades, every casket wound neighborhoods, I'm sure people understand it. Flu season California started yet. Give two weeks start another two see results. might wanna start even thinking visiting grandma Christmas. **We must clap louder.** keep thinking every time raise order magnitude infections raise probability successful random mutation thwart current group vaccines arrive.  world better place less Wisconsinites ( count Madison Milwaukee). kidding, kind of. point evidence there. people want keep pretending thing, fuck die. 

The bad thing takes one idiot life undo right things do. like drunk driving accident, rarely seems drunk driver die always car family die. understand difficult smooth brains you‚Äôre saying wrong. I'm really looking forward winter here. live small apartment friends already getting frustrated trying figure hang safely can't outside (not everyone even access good outdoor space - balcony example 6x9). Last weekend plans canceled due weather I'm afraid moving forward that's going case often not. never said poor reading comprehension. said hopefully better repairing helicopters reading comprehension. Anyone else finding literally impossible find therapist right now? needed therapy basically entire life could kind afford first time year, trying get therapist 6 months success everyone booked people depressed covid everything. I'm end fucking rope way making things better. know do. Brazilian cases deaths falling ... Hmm. you‚Äôre going get one, local stores near already selling out. It‚Äôs going next big shortage gets colder. No, isn't. told 2 weeks stop spread virus. somehow turned even vaccine enough people?

Give fucking break. friend mine works state department health absolutely said avoid big box retailers. Yup murdered people cold blood. biggie ‚Äúmuh bizznesses‚Äù dollars lives lulz nurse Wisconsin working hospital. confirm. Saw death last night. western world, probably start year, everyone able get vaccine April. hear? 30 year old recently died coronavirus! could next! (No, read article stated 380 pounds, smoked 2 packs day diabetes hypertension) linking things remotely say claiming.

And nah I‚Äôm going ill-informed Redditor says looking get people killed reason. laughably wrong 

Do always argue bad faith cherry pick data helps ignoring actual facts situation? county supports healthcare large rural area north. They'll get patients far north MI border. That's way goes northwoods. grocery stores checkbox turn substitutions Well then, doctors nurses Wisconsin must lying then... lot country dumb lacks empathy. actual mothers risk, would ok sending classroom? lawyer said ""no one dies virus anymore."" Trump would done equally good job control press testing. Think could accomplish second term. kidding me? Daily Discussion posts? Anyone even gives slight indication taking even minimal precautions, acknowledges virus ""just flu, bro"" immediately downvoted oblivion. weeks ago made small comment Daily Discussion post asking people still wiping groceries whether still worth continue so, immediately got like 10 downvotes without even response.

On posts, yeah, opposite, visited people actually invested tracking spread COVID, simply whine much hate lcokdowns. still going on, mostly city 2,813,503 ""militias"" burn anything down?

No. example DJT got inaccessible healthcare: work hospital, remdesivir typically reserved sickest patients. However, it‚Äôs effective earlier stages, isn‚Äôt enough give everyone early stages hope fight give later stage. Trump received remdesivir extremely early case, played role keeping alive allowing recover faster. It‚Äôs leveled. It‚Äôs back upswing article title says ""Wisconsinites Still Staying Home."" infers they're supposed saying home. 1. elderly do, could focus without restricting rest population. vulnerable poor children, whenever govt tries control economy like now, massive economic contraction throws far vulnerable suffering.

The government isn‚Äôt controling economy. lockdowns ended months ago. economic contraction lack consumer demand consumers don‚Äôt feel safe, shouldn‚Äôt. 
 would participate things open. govt close bc wouldn‚Äôt close own, otherwise need restrictions.

States re-opened theaters August theaters closed voluntarily people weren‚Äôt going see movies. lack demand product. support effort destroy lives saves.

Then support measures get pandemic control. ignoring going prolong health crisis, prolong economic stimulus save millions children suffering (probably increase inflation money go straight big corps)

If business closed business owner doesn‚Äôt customers, expect get short-term funding from? I‚Äôm still understanding think telling people ignore pandemic going fix economy. Epidemiologists driving policy decisions bc idea economies work collateral damage leads suffering.

We currently living looks like epidemiologist driving policy. country, least moment, impossible. literal magic wand could wave put nets place, would happily so, reality moment, nothing going change immediate future. issue HIV/covid deaths counted, control either. question account excess cardiac/ respiratory/ CVA deaths we've year. Considering virus likely us long time, like eg. flu, 2 deaths day really much seeing coming years, even vaccine? consider many deaths related flu per year, COVID-19's higher mortality rate, seems pretty stable, considering Sweden long-term strategy. That's really article saying. article specifically says:

""'COVID could causing diabetes scratch,' said Dr. Francesco Rubino""

""'We could dealing entirely new form diabetes.'"" (For reference fulminant Type 1 discovered 2003).

""This year, doctors also seeing people without risk factors type 2 diabetes - older overweight - experience diabetic emergency exposure COVID-19.""

If causing diabetes scratch, would mean traditional biomarker cues would present. Therefore article title misleading, ""misly"" chose say. Additionally, well 300 Endocrinologists signed onto study, would take mean seen one case... also reported since April, two cases (father son) described article August July, respectively. cult leaders say masks work - sheep plot kill. Nov 3rd can't come close enough. There's big billboard Stanley, Wi Trump advertisement literally says ""99.99% chance die"" COVID. fucking astounding... could possibly severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus jumped species transmissible human human. However suggest true source SARS-CoV-2 stretch. Lol guys calling us ‚Äúanarchists‚Äù now? Also, cared poor long lockdowns. Exactly. better rest us staying home. worried, stay inside rest life. Literally one cares ""heroics."" idiot! Vaccine candidates using different technologies. I'm expert can't describe works, know possible approved vaccine may elicit stronger immune response natural infection would + get benefit risk death diarrhea.

&amp;#x200B;

I would find sources immune response thing I'm trouble finding keywords google it. news weeks ago. Flu numbers wrote announced historic lows you‚Äôve said remotely true. Get Reddit learn something please  make vaccine useless then? reports, tests, virus right? 
Funny Florida still highest death toll whole country. Trump Republican's tag line election ""let em die"". I've quite nurses store wearing masks properly, several wearing masks all. handful nurses spreading misinformation social media town well. Nursing students particular downright hateful local social hubs (our radio network FB pages, local websites, etc) saying shit like people jist need stop sheep, etc... NURSING STUDENTS, future nurses part healthcare system.

Overall I'd say nurses amazing, reaaaaally gotten bad live, sheer volume toxic nurses community absolutely staggering opinion. Especially work, feel like I'm walking eggshells helping them. come highly conservative town struggles racism ignorance (I can't move away currently, get chance) gotten much worse COVID. Here, racially-motivated violence going up, employee business assaults going up, nurses spreading misinformation public, Premier almost completely silent gutting healthcare system last 5 years. I'm exhausted frustrated even know do. alcohol consumption relevant tested beforehand? Oh go ask celebrities unprecedented access medical care novel drugs still development?

None reported anything like nothing like privileged view pandemic- 

That view nothing ""privilege"". logic. seen many public personalities get Covid none lingering issues.

I personally know several Covid cases none hospitalized lingering issues. 768 recovered Covid cases city 400,000 people. experiencing permanent effects would worthy local news story, right? news likes find stories like that. nobody saying know whether outcome rare enough time hasn‚Äôt passed determine long term risks?

Would say thing vaccine? dont know kind outcomes possible enough time hasnt passed determine long term 20‚Äôs I‚Äôve witnessed friends die alone isolation can‚Äôt even hold funeral them- it‚Äôs old ill dumb dumb

How many friends died Covid, alone isolation? knew stupid drafted QB first round. I‚Äôm sorry grandfather, I‚Äôm glad get see hope truly isn‚Äôt last time. mom 85 lives alone 4 hours away me, sister close won‚Äôt able see holidays neither take COVID precautions do. mom went back church reopened sister‚Äôs kids living life like pandemic SMH. Except modern hospitals built literally operate around 70% capacity. They're within line currently.

Also, headline clearly deaths, capacity. Going start outsourcing space, pile getting big. Maybe Russia willing help. honestly give shit, least hub stores work at. Kid calls sick threw go total lock mode. That's morning lol 

We constantly people stores checking stuff. Big Ten Football returns! Co's paying people quarantine got Govt $$$$ pay back lay anyone off! Mechanical ventilation 10K day.  realize winning election doesn‚Äôt magically make go away right? It‚Äôs going Mondays low testing volumes Simply call life protest BLM, automatically making safe covid. Follow science, people We're heading fall winter cold dry weather respiratory pathogens spread efficiently. top lot travel congregate settings due holidays. people give shit Florida. Idiots death us. April 5th- 1427 died

April 6th - 1525

April 7th - 2271

April 8th - 2211

April 9th - 2149

April 10th- 2282

April 11th- 2070

April 12th - 1760

* Numbers Worldometers

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So 7 day period, 14,268 people died. majority concentrated greater NYC metro area.

9/11 killed 2,996 NYC, DC, flight 93 crashed field PA.

Pearl Harbor killed 2,403.

The week April 5th April 12, Covid-19 killed 14,268 Americans, double amount people killed 9/11 Pearl Harbor, ***combined***.

So exactly wrong... let rephrase.

Can considerate others take virus seriously please? 

That's front line health workers asking long time now. Ugh need sarcasm. add quotation marks cite said it. think missed point. emergency act stretches month time Canadian law. No, Emperor Trudeau cannot likes, extend 30 days time. number 1 ranked 27th world comes patient outcomes terms efficiency. embarrassment system kills tens thousands year.

Again understand ok dead Americans long CEOs take billions profits absolutely reason. thought weird vaccine edible. argue science? Wisconsin? There's huge difference Madison and, say, Crivitz. Federal government action required. like trying prevent global warming using plastic bags. Literally propaganda. means make prisoners work pay. Because, like, they're good prison. guess. Yup, that's exactly wife's family later summer. Nobody knew anyone tested positive summer, got complacent careless. Sure enough, fall arrived know 5 people family contracted virus. Luckily, none severe symptoms high-risk due complications, still definitely downplaying things like big deal. Sto male :) Yea....I guess......but get sick go sit house week come thing. None people even goyya ""semi-bad"" sick yet......  Charities allowed exist system, yet access hospitals limited allow treated. profit hospitals take care everyone. hey keep
Trying conflate two bad faith argument, sure don‚Äôt sound dumb s/ elected President doesn‚Äôt power even wanted to. Thanksgiving? That's depressing. Outside medical staff, don‚Äôt reusable masks it‚Äôs fault wearing disposable mask week straight mother (very high risk) thinks numbers WI false cuz ""she talked someone Froedert beds full"". chooses believe nothing happens outside Milwaukee. General Kenobi! Texas: tread me! (unless I'm teacher, minority, poor gay, okay) we're going start guessing effects peer reviewed studies done? people getting fatigued restrictions. still wear mask prone going taking risks. factually incorrect. Ok lot apparently 

Do get two sources provide contradict other? could still 100k extra people dead US alone.

That shouldnt acceptable.

70% great still need large percentage population get vaccinated. neighbors several big parties backyard last months. hire bands come play. Rent bouncy houses. last weekend set several tents backyard, imagine limits airflow. number cars lining street, volume hollering coming yard, clear intimate bubble get-togethers. cases rising every country? 

I think study reality masks (in dumb imperfect humans put chins, touch them, use enter restaurants/bars/cinemas take off) crucial. 

One thing effectiveness perfect masked society social distances effectiveness masks current world worn imperfect humans avoid social distance.

Masks without social distancing saying ""I'll drive 300 mph OK, seatbelt"". Doubting real-life effectiveness masks current world saying ""Hey, seatbelts guarantee die, use seatbelt drive responsibly"". incredibly stupid idea noted article ineffective. 

It seems governments waking fact vaccine anytime soon ""Wait vaccine"" strategy losing one. People recovered covid got months later Yep......""OshKosh""...hahahahahahahahahahahahaha Never Forget trash publication trying spin negative way. lifting restrictions many elderly would gladly take chances virus forced isolate another six months. also legal implications. illegal prohibit citizens leaving homes, even 70+.  least implemented curfew, 10PM virus really dangerous. Russian coronavirus vaccine gonna concentrated Smirnoff, it.  wish people actually cared fellow citizens They're already exposed, supposedly? so, longer need PPE. problem, problem. problem president fox news. obvious. even know many people get long term affects covid yet. 20% people test positive require supportive care. 

It shown people never needed supportive care suffer effects. many people effects unknowen get concrete numbers would require phyiscal entire population.

So basicly 75% majority deffinition. play odds like that. Absolutely free markets quickly become filled first movers gatekeepers shore position collude others within market root exclude competition. free market ""free"" 1 nanosecond. Markets always regulated, government businesses within, businesses within little incentive friendly competition consumers.

Do know first movers shore position? Regulatory capture. that's exactly happening now. Natural monopolies Many major government regulations place due really shitty behavior corporations past. 

Exactly! Corporations make money, pay officials get laws passed protect position. 

Oh wait, saying something like ""government reason still work sweatshops"" wrong. Massive increases productivity work sweatshops. Outlawing gave us fewer choices, end needing anyway. Willie nelson approves Even Union friends MSC contracted ships given shaft. reliefs (more usual lol) easy way make ship it‚Äôs US port. Yep...the morons going make continue. nobody tell anything Leader dumb them!!!  Honestly... deserve it.
Back spring already great helped us out, time completely blame letting get hand again. debt sure. minty fresh OVERFLOWING hospitals death rates. know people get that. enough savings live time, that's definitely sign privilege. Many many people barely scraping take face face jobs make ends meet. Trump, Fox people depending Facebook news issue, period. gotta pretty high unprotected butt sex though  No. called lockdown exhaustion. 2.5 months able move 200m house. protect family (masks, washing hands, limited social life). Big government restricting movement. Sorry, sorry. sustainable least. Now, live parent's basement, easy bring simplistic reasons. answered question hospital capacity. sure responded rudely taking position. mandate

do tell outside buildings mandated? since airborne walk people sickly breath outside people wear masks? hanging isolation. bother getting tested son started feel better. husband mostly better, sense smell still gone. 

Here 14 days isolation last contact. Last contact 10 days husband's onset symptoms. 24 day home quarantine. I'm going stir crazy. That's people, risk/elderly vaccinated Spring see need lockdown/social distancing policies Jinkies! say ‚ÄúSee! vaccine prevents serious disease skinny, healthy 20 year olds!‚Äù realize cheeky Africa's response part good. Several countries within continent done fantastic job reacting COVID mitigating effects great success, example get recognition deserve news.

Rwanda COVID deaths per 100K population: 0.28 

Sweden COVID deaths per 100K population:  husband runs electric utility Northeast basically critical storm response roles. initially looked trailers like bring storms instead rented entire floor hotel. Also effectiveness masks wonder Catholicism dwindling. Good Job! 7 months hospital staff still need say that. Fantastic. wasn‚Äôt much mitigation social distancing going Brazil! 
 
Why say it? big events, shops open long time, cinema, travelling went large amount, nightclubs, almost 100% home office done.. say much mitigation social distancing Brazil? Oh? statement made exactly? don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs enough justification challenge trial. lot ways challenge trial might *better* non-challenge trial, fact non-challenge trials still over-powered even limitations.

The challenge trials might give us interesting data disease course (in young, healthy people), already plenty cases contact tracing know date exposure disease course.

I don‚Äôt see extra data challenge trial would speed vaccine approval process, given efficacy data would still available long necessary follow-up period vaccine safety durability.

E: Part reason current Phase 3 trials focusing symptoms they‚Äôre primarily focused preventing COVID (the disease) rather infection. Given coronaviruses work, there‚Äôs good reason suspect vaccines won‚Äôt prevent infection protect disease. agree regularly testing infection (and don‚Äôt appear be), don‚Äôt think failure justifies challenge trials - simply required closely monitor participants. Remember , (northern hemisphere) lot sunlight past 6 months people spent time outside. 

It's possible get surfaces seen yet unfavorable environmental conditions. damn late...
doesn't CDC check what's going countries helps there? live Texas everything opened. People middle ages fighting plagues smarter this. Women MN, like place, come shapes sizes. come faces stunningly beautiful exceptionally plain. generalize population millions women demeaning sexist. 

Ironically, beliefs generalization, especially negative generalization, OK ‚Äúfact‚Äù deserve pity. want swirl around imagination. seems fun there. ü•≥ Megadeath? Wisconsin resident here, live city hospital article in. also travel state work.

I mask up. house except groceries, picking carry-out, necessities, since lockdown March.

I see lot masks about, always good number maskless well. disheartening, thought better this.

Also, recently denied service gas station wore mask in. eastern part state. Damn shame much ignorance. idea. wondered same... 500-600 ppl biggest capacity venue I've seen... Maybe going sports arena something? would think going on, though suspect right now, $ pushed treatment vaccine studies.
Edit: Guess article already posted since removed. searched didn‚Äôt see it, whatever. matter anymore. urging pleas going work. Covid fatigue, along course president politicians downplaying virus encouraging complete opposite doctors stating means nobody going listen. Probably SF like Yah, Dallas ‚Äúspike‚Äù University Park spike parts town early September. SMU there.

Here‚Äôs hospital‚Äôs model pretty accurate. last slide concerning, say least. Slides 7 10 show location spikes timing lol no. also extreme real world. Even folks work finance think regulations medical devices bad. 

I mean, come on... think stupid is.  Currently, comment, 220 thousand people died Coronavirus US alone. Death extremely certain disease. may personally care, risk, affected - remarkably callous Malthusian way understanding present situation. High rates infections combined even low fatality rates certain death many people (220k far US, exact). even begin address non-death related harm disease. hem haw misinformed (I work medicine, fyi), think don‚Äôt care humans dying. 

Here‚Äôs news report overwhelmed state hospitals current Midwest (the story 4 days old post): excerpts:

* ‚ÄúOur hospitals getting overwhelmed,‚Äù Republican Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said week. ‚ÄúThe dramatic increase infections put integrity health care system risk.‚Äú

* University Utah Health System, one largest hospitals state, reported ICU 95 percent filled, health systems parts country forced relocate patients bed staffing shortages.

* Indiana, state facing ‚Äúcritical ICU bed shortages along personnel shortages‚Äù according Chief Medical Officer Lindsay Weaver, three weeks Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb removed Covid-related restrictions. Officials put call volunteers help fill staffing shortages hard-hit facilities near Michigan Kentucky borders.

And on. Again, *you* might care frontline medical workers driven towards literal PTSD, others (as selfishly should, want doctor verge mental breakdown?). think hospitals nearing 95% capacity effective 50%? need go ER, COVID otherwise, hospital going prefer? 

Like honestly, argument here? It‚Äôs better people die economically disadvantaged? 

Like, we‚Äôve come terms earlier point need safety nets mitigate damage caused quarantine-like measures, doesn‚Äôt absolve *not killing fellow man*. That‚Äôs nice hear. Based math that‚Äôs $1,800 $1,900 net upper end non-college degreed jobs. Hopefully wife stay healthy pandemic. Salaries expense eat profits. Learn words next time, embarrassing yourself. know could still get infected, right? Swimming cold water may help dementia.

Sadly late anti-maskers. original title misleading. article used ""major economy"". matter. Omar comes knockin' wants remember decades ago Binaca huge trend. Everyone spraying classes. Maybe it‚Äôs time bring back ‚ÄúBinaca Blast‚Äù! much herd-immunity.. true respiratory viruses. Still bad covid could you. hunt marters seem corona regularly. Yeah would cause kidney issues. sugar cause kidney damage. One could argue sugar doesnt mean diabetes correlated, unchecked pee sugary sugar fuck entire tract since amazing bacteria like warm house decked luxury food Friday SEPTA commute last week, dude wasn‚Äôt wearing mask all, another woman coffee hand mask around chin...for whole ride (common anti-mask tactic). conductors didn‚Äôt anything, probably know people crazy get violent ask wear mask. long term damage? terrifying? recent history, European nations used existing state total war other. Capital cities bombed oblivion, factories left, mass death. couple weeks without restaurants hardly doomsday comparison? think anybody thinks going eradicate virus done once. point country stage tracking tracing gets small percentage cases, ""the cat bag"", could way get least parts cat bagged. doesn‚Äôt gov step tell transport companies can‚Äôt that? tbh cut amount trains buses here. Everyone wore masks. one believes anyone caught transport here. trace every infection Bert closely here. Almost restaurants,bars, work can‚Äôt wear mask home. Now? That's political that's muhfuckin fact dawg Sorry, comparing abortion wearing mask? way parse this, staggeringly bad comparison trouble believing someone would espouse it. Also inpatient covid cases beat covid deal pneumonia simultaneously. Afterwards take awhile get pneumonia. course pneumonia cases spike BIG time year, likely next 2 3 years reckon. Implied? came right said it. implied exactly said. Quit trying put words exactly are, weirdo! Yeah.. could recommend masks cover mouths noses, that'd great. gonna like two weeks Italy month shit. know disease never disappeared? Every single one except smallpox lasting immunity Covid19.

Does reinfections really prove could also immune systems built equally? Could little both. get argument achieving successful nations equitably global scale massively tough proposition. way forward clearly shown. Failing follow simply failure us need whatever region we're implement similar successful strategy. 

I think rather trying achieve uniform success world once, region try succeed area, control Covid-19 spread borders, achieving stable success, seek export support guidance remaining world trouble spots. 

I hoped United States would've taken leading role this, sadly, given U.S.'s advantages, may one worst pandemic responses entire world. CDC 2 months right ship show back bone win back reputation. trust company? elbow strike lot good side jaw well, twisting head rapidly potentially fracturing dislocating jaw. much less likely miss throat strike strategies be!

California add water supply means used put fires water grass.

Texas roving bands Regulators, armed dart guns fire anyone wearing mask.

Florida vaccinate one person, declare virus beaten reopen everything. Covid-19 deaths immediately drop zero deaths Covid-like symptoms explode.

Hawaii make cocktail it. insane. obtain 5.5 million antigen tests?

I wonder experts think this. certainly slip radar, momentary sample people could infectious hours testing. also impossible complete wipe virus anyway.

But testing entire country certainly yield interesting data. would nice wait rock solid study don‚Äôt time that. 

Oh completely agree fact evidence strong mean mask mandates automatically somehow ""wrong"". act also weak evidence downside small risk high, I'd say places mandate masks done. 

The Swedish FHM seem terrified potential downsides mandating masks, e.g. public transit companies would use excuse packing buses trains fuller, people would less risk averse wearing masks. I'm sure evidence \*that\* happening weak! mostly lack perceived faith government calls lockdown, wrong proven countries New Zealand.

What saw people generally supportive temporary restrictions mandates (such wearing face masks) public health. Even UK, public support implementation lockdown incredibly high March April. could implemented restrictions 2-3 weeks earlier save thousands lives.

What kept government pushing button people turning them, rather business economic focused approach governance. way rest country acting, one bad quarantine leak away too. there's plenty cases people skipping quarantine, largely luck moment  Good you, sure quarantine get it. Since covid yearly thing, sure get vaccine 4 years safety profile super decked out.  Nice cherry picking. Ohio 6ft away someone work wear mask. I've heard schools allow students well... top see many people public wearing masks wearing nose. surprise numbers rise. Yes, usually bacterial pnemonia two weeks Covid. immune sytem debilitated. That's it. evidence done worked. Everything else speculative. accepting vaccines. take chances virus. Hot damn time flies ADA would prevent however.

Same effect, different law. [Lena Minister Health Social Affairs.

[Johan director-general Folkh√§lsomyndigheten.

[Anders [State FoHM.

[Anders deputy state epidemiologist (also seen lot press conferences).

[Johan former state epidemiologist.

And [Annika basically started whole herd immunity-rumor saying looks like that.

Something worth point also Sweden [ministerial Masks. new religion west. think get less hostile reaction kicking crucifix Christmas mass. family support, even you‚Äôre sick going work every day, you‚Äôre allowed say ‚Äúenough‚Äù job. It‚Äôs called responsibility, right one other. suggest top health officials lie say ‚Äúit‚Äôll fine, everyone go fun. hard people want, nothing bad happen.‚Äù know - hospitalisations much higher one region another, despite similar infection levels per capita, effects could to:

1. severe disease;
2. Older/more vulnerable populations;
3. Greater testing region fewer hospitalisations.

There seem evidence 1 2, go-to assumption would 3. That's it, talk new normal politicians pressed get normal. suspect media pushing agenda, let's make big enough deal still restrictions X cases people start questioning to.

It's umm, we're fucking pandemic.

From WA leak quarantine going blow like Melbourne did, packed work places venues, people paying attention social distancing etc.

How's economy this? snarky, I'm genuinely curious. masks really work though? People China wearing masks long pandemic still spread like wildfire. Lets hope so. took one mistake Melbourne city shut almost 4 months counting. Tegnell, unfortunately, likes hyperbole. bit like certain president. least media likes make soundbites taking whatever hyperbolic thing says longer context, focusing that. controversial longer context, could avoided saying ""very weak"" said ""not strong yet"" - would non-news. 
He careful expresses think. Well, data shows long term immune dysregulation. I'd love see data 6 months recovery etc. 
There also another pre print drastic reduction natural killer cells well ""recovery"", I'll add find it. definitely was, even testing negative COVID infection, deal post covid pneumonia. medical DRG all. fuck guys there??? Feel free contribute discussion anytime. went two crowded flights (160+ boeing 737), everyone mask least 30 people let noses out.

Something worth point also Sweden [ministerial Yes. drop 700+ day 1 isn‚Äôt seen anywhere else Western world. Poor community compliance basic public health measures led strained hospitals. Huh. can't believe still pushing reopen schools. disaster. 0.06 taking cause death rate. fatality rate contracting covid.  honest, Florida close boarders. many people states going Disney... Disney open first place. Japan, already culture wearing masks sick. Also, state-of-the-art trains. 6 Spanish flu pandemic ended. I've telling friends years ""communism"" failed idea that's proven Cold War failure. Dispassionate centralized control, energetic/desperate workforce, command economy, political repression, homogeneous ideology, may violate western philosophy human rights situation requires broad unified effort towards given end, system far effective one based US-style diversity thought action.

Some people think ""communism"" dead idea states still practice realize it. wrong. No. You‚Äôre duped. You‚Äôve fallen victim fear mongering. Plenty research there. gotta find want live fear show willingly. Like servers restaurants coffee shops? Excess deaths turning negative may result pandemic control efforts positive effects areas mortality, flu incidence, travel accidents. failing stop preventable Covid-19 deaths ""made up"" saving lives elsewhere. simply lives lost lost. said, evidence covid causes time. agree parts successes learned implemented. don‚Äôt think strategies easily implanted EU works want work unless whole union would decide members going work it. Eastern Europe could probably stomped beginning would help running wild Southern Europe? doubt mind cases rise reopen. question contain contact tracing. Yep Melbourne 750 cases day 5 million population took 100 days Bubbles like ""I'm telling confidence tell anyone else talk hear me"". That's effective people's bubbles are. 

Everyone thinks exclusive bubble there's always one family member friend tight people publicly private never washes hands, socially distance, wear mask, etc. Basically asymptomatic that's worth. Czech news, found English version yet. Slovak news would ""direct source"" nations connected almost first-hand (we understand others' language fluently anyway).

Summary:

There mass testing everyone Slovakia using rapid antigen tests. compulsory, upon testing, receive official confirmation - anyone found public without confirmation next ten days fined. essentially imposes 10-day quarantine anyone willing take part - people go outside anyway get tested. Children age 10 exempt well. 

20000 medical personal needed, med students encouraged help. Army organize effort 5000 testing locations, happen Oct 30/Nov 1 Nov 6-8. Swipe deep nose, 15-20 minutes wait results spot. Pilot project week 23-25 Oct chosen areas test feasibility. get date based first latter surname. 

My opinion:

Way go Slovakia! happens, really show ""test ourselves"" hole.  It‚Äôs good I‚Äôm waiting someone interview maskless Magatards ask support Mexico wall. since course do, bam, immediately compare two things. Interesting, think younger people tested Spain? idea. what? Tell everyone, ‚Äúfuck it, it‚Äôs good, everyone go it‚Äù?

I think explain consequences encourage many people possible take risk. would stupid to. year ***so far*** it‚Äôs 37,000. expect we‚Äôll easily exceed 40,000 Dec 31 ‚Äî so, previous 18 years combined. 

One could reasonably surmise pneumonia deaths caused Covid. Like working restaurant? Spread high going get vaccinated? think im going wait im age 70+ vaccinate. Like deadly disease, vaccination, elderly get wont worry catching covid others right? pneumonia hallucinations week March antibodies. May related possibly. Would recorded Covid death, likely. good news two reasons:

1. man survived (yay); 
2. Despite mild symptoms, hospitalised treated. means that, even taking account mildness symptoms (i.e., immediately life threatening) benefits treatment (remaining years life, etc.) still able get triage, meaning must adequate hospital capacity there. Massless--that's take huge dump go eat. covering help?

Yes. That's good \*hypothesis\*. thing science take hypothesis test it. that's easy things, harder others.

For particular hypothesis extremely difficult measure effect, many parameters can't control (even things like weather could affect control period).

So reason strong scientific results yet, bad hypothesis, really really hard test. 

And note mean wrong mask mandates. policy based pretty weak scientific evidence that's completely understandable want err side caution (for example). much hoax conspiracy stuff Norway either, despite soft lockdown spring mask mandate Oslo's metro buses. 

It's likely high trust government common Nordic countries general think.  average joe likely 3 months away minimum.

It almost certainly not. vaccine likely begun distribution widespread vaccination absolutely going occurred. Wouldnt stimulate Chinas economy since instapots made China? Chinas economy growing? citizens NY-NJ-CT lock independently.  way Governors issued order. Well, face could kill someone currently, so...yeah.

When's last time someone killed abortion another? Maybe need learn current Swedish politics. 

If want learn one thing (and one greatest things): Sweden isnt' politics all: politicians calling shots (the relevant authorities are), politicians normally \*allowed\* interferw government authorities here.

To translate US circumstances (ignoring state vs federal thing): CDC called shots lockdowns mask mandates overruled e.g. Secretary Health Human Services, Governor. really expensive base amount industries tourism travel sector impacting, counting emptying cities, said plus helping rural communities form another public booting like Simpsons Bart go apologize Australia?  live small southern suburb US, wearing mask makes pariah. block contactless curbside trick treating - get regular trick treaters, it'll kids live anyhow, we're planning set self-serve treats front half dozen kids. still get feel like they're holiday, least! Yeah, never able forget still walk alongside you, even over. hard recover revelation fellow men abusive narcissists, exists sizable portion people would probably HAPPY get physical altercation someone asks wear mask hurt someone. 


Gonna hard forget this. Humans kind garbage. Ah, absolutely right. precise there. course published leaked, knowledge.  haven't. autumn - higher spring

Unlikely. confirmed infections are, probably actual infections. basically everywhere - lack testing early days means number actual infections much, much higher knew. countries people frequently wear masks got control much faster countries not. talk ""spreading like wildfire"" China, fact virtually eradicated virus, cases outside epicentre Hubei.

Also, mask wearing norm pre-pandemic. minority, existence minority mask wearers made easier become culturally accepted.  worth. recent flight United, masks enforced flight attendant going aisle every 20mins checking everyone.

Unfortunately, noticed constantly remind people masks worn throughout flight give masks people acting dumb. glad nobody jackass made big scene it.

The flight packed. like moronic, yeah. articles would rather see universal framework EU. live Copenhagen. Cooperation Sweden Denmark crap. 15000 people commutes work countries day. Malm√∂ - Copenhagen 30 minute train ride. New Zealand, Australia Taiwan issue? 

Denmark closed borders people worked here. probably good call since big part healthcare workers (better pay Denmark). see two countries working instead together better? places like Europe. idea Asia.  Dark humor teacher. oh r*ndian. never change point testing nobody aiming elimination virus? 

To slow spread. identify target isolation infected people minimize broad policies isolate everyone. pointed hugely significant differences forced Sweden 10 times per capita Covid-19 deaths Norway. 

Are differences? Sure? reason massive difference pandemic response death rate? chance. Sweden's health authorities chose actions (and lack thereof), results clear see. Whatever cost us, working class pay back costs. children children's children end paying back. super rich carry banking offshore paying penny tax. Well, fair.  killing 50 million people fizzle out. suppose could add black plague list too. wiped world, stop. list whole bunch deseases achieve herd immunity vaccines. Like polio, measles, chicken pox. Chicken pox even gives almost lifetime immunity. particularly common desease reach herd immunity own. without vaccine, argument flawed point stands. Also - much like US - extremely localized first? remember reading region south complaining lockdown cases all, Lombardy overwhelmed. assume concentrated right now. saw somewhere else. Might Alabama newspaper article. Said 65% infections occurring family friend gatherings. mean 7 months ago admitted lying assholes go hoard every mask sell eBay 100 times worth? Leaving masks healthcare workers?

There's dozens recent Fauci statements saying work choose ignore. 

Try getting news somewhere Facebook. read Event 201 see anything wrong - Gates say wants depopulate Earth? even conspiracy? people (my workplace etc) actually know much what's going on. know X amount died, X severely ill general countries performed lockdowns ridiculed. live medium sized city there's much people mall always is. people sphere support Tegnell &amp; co still get live lives, well informed understand situation biologically economically no, simply manage numbers. probably testing late November, maybe. probably depending one work bitten twice shy.

Yeah it‚Äôs great case numbers down, we‚Äôve before, everyone seems get amnesia about. Unless tracing system improved time around we‚Äôll back situation second lockdown.  Yes. sneezing, quite seldom, talking next food without masks, incorrect mask handling, nose wiping. working hot kitchen environment, many people get runny nose. Also, many restaurants enforce correct mask wearing kitchen outside customer view?

Look video intended demonstrate hygienic mask wearing - one minute, four times mask touching, one nose change views decent study test results customers diseased kitchens serving raw food published.
Not cooking would help much food assembled afterwards. well duh, never know who's vampire. Graph: deaths) 1) proven length immunity know coronaviruses (the 4 cold-casing ones);

2) fact appears lot reinfections COVID already; and

3) drop-off antibodies happening lot quickly something like original SARS. Maybe figure reinfection problem. based on:

1) proven length immunity know coronaviruses (the 4 cold-casing ones);

2) fact appears lot reinfections COVID already; 

3) drop-off antibodies happening lot quickly something like original SARS. Hey guys, heard things called masks...

Maybe wont get sick wear them? GET WALK! Flights. Boats. Quarantine. Weak points always. Hopefully lessons learned states shared already mistakes repeated. know puts risk autoimmune diseases? Getting virus. 

So concerned getting one (and suck: three), get annual flu shot one comes out, get too. That's start.  Okay who's going run special day cares? Who's going pay them? long someone dies covid case kid brought home daycare guys start bitching shut down? there's daycare near live? 

It's easy spout bullshit. much harder come actual plan. injecting it. yes, that's study talking prove people keep throwing around here. people Melbourne seem handling masks social distancing time fine. wish friends would video chat me. Nobody know wants anymore. want meet person, which... thanks.  go outside, 2 meters apart, wash hands, work home, wear mask. 

It's complicated. 

Jackets also needed -10C outside, law though.  conveniently ignore part they're supposed continue wear masks socially distance small, home get togethers. think count something home. southern germany hardly ever see people without masks. Honestly, people ""forget"" wear masks mostly immigrants experience. germany home wide variety people cultures holds true area. saying general comparison bullshit everyone pretends Nordics exact prerequisites: 
SE much inequal, economically socially, leading bit segregation. Guess high mortality. Yep, information govt reach well, including ""infamous"" suburbs. 
The health care system, ""free"" also privatised honestly underfunded. lot deaths nursing homes, lot failure there. 
NO DK much centrally governed Oslo Copenhagen easily dictate rules, Sweden lot competence local ""regions"". 
Historically FI different relationship national tragedies 2nd World War, SE luck relatively untouched calamities (Estonia one, different kind), therefore preparedness much worse SE - see lack emergency law calamities (that war) em.

They part can't stop Covid own. Like fucking neighbors keep 20 person+ bonfire? Like great, outside, happy, they're also literally touching pack next fire, breathing other.

3 times last week.

If you, reading this, sort thing, guess what? helping propagate virus go away, no, immune outside. obviously going sort psychological trauma. Airline travel never easy comfortable begin with. hope nobody aircraft gets sick gets help needs 151 people ventilators sounds catastrophic. I‚Äôm surprised many hand. This. always pay doesn‚Äôt gov step tell transport companies can‚Äôt that

I'm sure (for example even legally possible). hey going hard enforce. people get angry violent fast. It‚Äôs almost go looking fight. understand domestic flights. Like, seriously? can't go 3 hours without eating? wonder country fat. don‚Äôt understand piecemeal recommendations wear wear mask.

I wear mask time except eating drinking home. living saner country people used wearing mask. Simple guidelines wear mask, wash hands, avoid crowded, confined spaces enough people follow. about? year vary average. case actual count per capita Covid-19 deaths Sweden. actual count nations *successful* pandemic responses. difference preventable deaths Sweden could've saved implementing actual, science-based, successful strategy instead musing herd immunity taking pathetic half-measures appear following herd immunity strategy Swedish health officials mused hard about. Thank you. I‚Äôm favor reckless obviously human requires social interaction. We‚Äôre training trip Mars. think people crazy really expect people isolate months. country? trying put words exactly are

Freudian slip illiterate? two dates mean everyone tested both? great. also completely meaningless unless enforcement. Lol, would use cattle prod cow person wearing mask? problem Social media full everyone who's making money working minimum wage job, watching Netflix playing video games day getting paid downvote comment like yours. That's kinda irrelevant. may cheaper restrictions. Currently we're facing tough situation Europe. Winter coming, numbers going up. Meanwhile vaccines antigen tests sufficient amounts still 2-3 months away. 

That's wonder got tests from. Hopefully they've validated properly. you‚Äôre telling completely preventable deaths occurring years equal similar number per anum basis covid-19 caused year? 

I wonder outrage actually, 10 million tests bought, testing twice (to lessen said ""slipping"").

and news, tests bought South Korean manufacturer SD Biosensor. Would Indonesia, etc., capacity build manufacturing quickly China though? Fixed. Thanks. table extremely confusing perhaps I'm reading right, suggestion 40k people died pneumonia 20 years, flu alone kills roughly 40k every year? Rinderpest also eradicated

And diseases fact disappeared. quite ancient epidemics strange sets symptoms cannot matched precisely modern disease. presumably indeed came went.

This one likely stay long time though. need 5.5 test.

1-2m enough. odds 62 residents could A) avoid infection B) get infected time, close enough 62 test positive?
 
This awful hard understand. lax something could spread every single patient avoid covid till now? U can't see feel might kill you. Please wear masks really amazing... wish way parents pass knowledge others need it. 

The closest thing manage trying best dang aunt BFF‚Äôs kids nieces nephews hubby‚Äôs siblings - since I‚Äôm child, neither hubby mentally stable enough parents. hard enough time depression is. They'll likely give neighbours recipe, think already deal Indonesia that. Nope, shitty cousin law asked several weeks ago ‚Äúopinion‚Äù masks. standing next elderly mother I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúdo believe virus exists?‚Äù says it‚Äôs severe ‚Äúthey‚Äù say is. 

I asked believes people really died virus says believe die it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly old people sick people‚Äù. told ‚ÄúI wear mask love family I‚Äôm worried awful would feel one get sick‚Äù (including mother neighbor). 

After got done telling opinion non-mask wearers shitbags went tell recently flew plane worn mask ‚Äúmight consider wearing one on‚Äù. Threatening let people go back work see families cases going force people lie hide symptoms. 

The victim blaming opposite effect curbing pandemic Found article Taiwanese website Chinese. found English article yet.

Meanwhile, several exported cases Taiwan, local contacts Taiwan also tested found negative.

It seems false positive case distracting issue. authorities would disclose positive result immediately (might false positive), others would re-test several times confirmed. (accurate slower). tried asking someone wear mask place it‚Äôs required reminded rules. told threatening manner, ‚ÄúThen make wear one, b****!‚Äù understanding generally better time use air purifier HEPA filter since thats kinda like giant mask clean air trap particles. shutting vents might necessary evil AC old-fashioned. info, though, secondhand source. I'd love challenged learn more. youre going die couple hours without water jfc change mostly switching national recommendations regional/local recommendations. lockdowns coming, unless would call Sweden back April lockdowns well. live long without human host. can't live long term surfaces.  


That's NZ dealt relatively easily. foolish. 

http://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2020/10/study--mask-mandates-shown-to-significantly-reduce-spread-of-cov.html needs controlled; China struggled, put box. Trump screwed royally world paid price. Forgive fools deny science; ignorance bliss. High life! Come baby lie me! Wear mask üò∑ Yes is. already sent  80% asymptomatic, show symptoms mild, probably actually people catch lose fear. got mind changed ""that sucked, 'lose year life prevent it' level sucking want vaccine want vaccine could hurt me. safe ill take it. idea gets abused power structures want force treatment.

What ""power structures"" could possibly VOLUNTARY dating website ?... want (before hand) agree design/rules. one would forcing anyone part this. ""You tell healthy person looking them. top end, people healthy diets, regular exercise, good stress management glow.""

Bullshit. There's lot people hide things like STD's etc. Several months ago, comment would upvoted moon back. local news channels air walkthrough floor infected patients? Everyone film signs hospitals agree etc. USA news stations done yet? one Italy aired first hit hard EU scared living piss think people states need hit sort reality locally. giving people illusion ""you whatever want long wear mask""? educating use mask properly?

People drive car recklessly believe seatbelt protect them. Actually Vietnam accepting tourists moment. really country (whatever meant be) back normal Well explain people means investigate source rather seeking fast-food versions knowledge?

I mean, fair enough negative someone happen interpret negative, want everybody able tie shoes meet someone know it, mocking trying teach hell lot slower showing it, think so? Whew, almost make /s. 

The issue individualism freedom come responsibility part responsibility individual collectivism national crisis. anti-maskers want benefits without tolls come it. Problem disaster nature going repaid one way another. gonna enforce this? see spike right here:  talking point they‚Äôre indoctrinating with? care others well hoping restrict spread virus ‚Äúbasement dwellers‚Äù like Biden isn‚Äôt constantly tweeting conspiracy‚Äôs claiming windmills cause cancer people say he‚Äôs ‚Äúhiding basement‚Äù. Interesting. Except many deaths entirely preventable. Exactly. Prolonged lockdown whether light hard one psychic toll, hard people follow rules everyone knows logically correct human nature tells us opposite.

Afaik lot second wave eg France due people undergoing hard lockdown, afterwards socializing working without social distancing. That's also glad know swedish recommendations would place regardless second wave happened not, really normalizes need work socialize responsibly least another year think removing them. We've got LEAST another 50k deaths us winter over. obesity heart disease rates roof. I'd venture say 40% Americans exercised last year. Covid much larger health crisis starting show. distance wear masks want, people America keep dying. 45% initial wave (adjusted CDC numbers) seniors care facilities. We've still got untapped ocean pre existing condition riddled people ready croak. damn articles headlines, every day here. Time go something else.. used protection It‚Äôs first time hear countries behind Iron Curtain called ‚Äúcapitalist‚Äù. Communist experiment turned way did, that‚Äôs one way assume responsibility.

I agree fact nature doesn‚Äôt submit human control. It‚Äôs recent ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù created. Humans long we‚Äôve around mercy nature, droughts, fires, famine, disease. gone shopping years, even Pandemic, order everything Amazon. Also, probally greater 80 thousand, could see hundered thousand day then. Goddamn. Hope loved ones stay safe sane dealing that. somebody Florida feel pain. Nah wait times really thing. cancer go front line, something way less serious go back line. go based medical need, money.

Tens thousands Americans die year due lack coverage. addition countless lose homes due medical bills.

These things simply happen elsewhere, get better coverage, pay less. Lots protesters wear masks 

Regardless, comes think actions putting people serious risk. do, enjoy music champion social justice home online effectively (even effectively IMHO). Mass majority festival goers protesters largely chose go events social community experience aspects anything. People ready get leave homes prioritize risks others; opinion, understandable heat pandemic truly thought virus going incredibly deadly, concern rescinded since course worry still far over. Wow. It‚Äôs sad see lightly people taking this. life, lives others, risk. really can‚Äôt wrap head around ideas people refuse wear masks.

I‚Äôve heard number conspiracy theories ‚Äúour rights‚Äù points went wearing masks. 
It‚Äôs unfortunate people choose ignore science exchange beliefs desires. finance called sweating asset trash publication trying spin negative way. lifting restrictions many elderly would gladly take chances without seatbelt forced wear seatbelt another six months. also legal implications. illegal prohibit citizens driving seatbelt, even 70+. What's IFR virus? done complete 100% two months shut back March. would lot less worse economy year plus partial shutdown/decreased business due virus still large  Oh, trying downplay situation there, pointing people also stupid. Stay safe warm!! I'm concerned guy, hope heart get damaged It‚Äôs fucking October, u really STILL need reminder? add this, components PATRIOT missiles literally manufactured part convicts working People say virus disappear election used Trump flip side, many would others kill considering population increases density? Speaking Missouri, Governor Parson's delt COVID? Even sinch tested positive, heard nothing. okay? Also, Governor Northam COVID case? South Korea, although ""eradicated"" COVID, achieved success level high surveillance would impossible implement States. thought anti-maskers bad, wait till pro-privacy people come woodworks. Ah yes, governments around world never bad things. even did, past. They'd *never* take much power give back days... right? That's I've always coughed. Yeah, option farm. ""Perfect lab conditions"" pretty much food storage. ‚ÄúHow dare change opinion new information comes out!!‚Äù People die everyday everything corona big deal. Total fear mongering Coronavirus ward = long term care centers I've literally heard 3 people cough 8 months. normal breath cloud? pandemics nearly well documented though. Average time spent hospital COVID-19 positive patients decreased drastically since start pandemic, current deaths far likely confirmed cases 2-3 weeks ago. ""liberty justice all"" live constant state fear? likely around 100,000 deaths year US think, fair amount, lot flu.

100K well flu kills every year. 35K died last year. worst flu season since 2010 killed around 61K according CDC.  remember ""bodies street"" verbiage, followed precisely one hospital full. I'm told I'll able resume normal international travel, I'll take chances whatever vaccine throw there. need national strategy virus. Stop making actual heroes expend energy fighting mass ignorance.

Drove bar country overflow lot full. doubt masks there. infected many passengers? Ooh rather uncivil. Tsk tsk 20% people test positive require supportive care.

Those people test positive. many people gotten COVID, notice, suffering effects?  least live FL, message get tested unless symptomatic reason believe came contact someone it. Also, feeling mildly sick, stay home. 757,000 cases FL far, hard time digesting there's least 200,000 people still suffering long-term effects + contracted asymptomatic cases felt nothing time feeling ill effects.

The numbers i've seen supporting long-hauling either anecdotal involve sample sizes &lt;70 people. Family member mine hospital going 3 weeks, another got losing sense smell.

It's almost like thing affects everyone differently. obnoxious serve purpose. dude Italy literally agreed mask usage low, yet want toss anecdotal data. really give shit think, I'm simply telling obviously numbers going means something changed. could be? Perhaps correlating common anecdotal evidence lead us fair conclusion suggested anyone assume happen people become tired wearing masks start think things getting better. go troll elsewhere. what's worst check lockdowns working, blame people complying hardcore enough instead assessing flaws lockdown policy.

fify! Ask November 3rd. Sounds bit patronizing No, not. wear mask, basically telling nurses fuck right off.

They feel way every flu season technically. 30,000 people US die every year then. guess 30,000 deaths acceptable number. start wearing masks for? Diseases kill 30k per year? like 80k? people fall camp Trump did. life threatening, recovery week two. shocking. preventing interstate travel plane car last spring big mistake. Thanks. far good. much hate working overnights cause get see much. work directly general public making money make money lost job. hope family staying healthy. long wearing masks, preventing surface contamination. Thank you!  many due lockdown measures? First World Countries give citizens health care, government keep hospitals running without needing maximize profit illness death. You‚Äôre missing point entirely. somebody comes house basic work aren‚Äôt spending time hanging around chatting them, much less eating around them. masked different rooms times. fact even kept windows open air circulation. 

Contrast hanging around friends family aren‚Äôt typically exposed to, you‚Äôre likely spending hours close proximity probably eating makes mask wearing impossible. Eating around Thanksgiving table, hanging living room watching sports TV (possibly involving shouting depending company) etc. high risk activities. one person group Covid, particularly among subset people likely spread virus, everybody room significant risk. 

This actually happening right now. higher risk behaviors explain hospital talk reopening covid ICU. 

(Also wasn‚Äôt new blinds, it‚Äôs newish house blinds actually I‚Äôm sure neighbors sick accidentally seeing us naked lol) Implying would read peer reviewed study sort ""strategy"" that, exactly? nurse local hospital says test positive asymptomatic still work According upvotes, seems do. state masks required. see customers remove mask talk, hang nose out, grocery store..walmart.

Employees too..some hang schnozzle out.

So ..yeah wear two masks,,a kn95 surgical mask it. others put risk, Still though...2 3 deaths, like freaking Sweden, good lanes freeway opening Flu doesn‚Äôt typically spread asymptomatically, you‚Äôre sick it‚Äôs assumed won‚Äôt go spread germs.

Covid spread asymptomatically, don‚Äôt know sick spreading it, hence masks. isn‚Äôt rocket science.

And know what? you‚Äôre sick cold public wear fucking mask. send people say fake. insane. think Spanish Flu dangerous affected healthy folks most.

People quibble Florida, North Carolina (ha!), Georgia (are fucking kidding me?), Ohio, unless Biden wins one states, whole election turns Pennsylvania Arizona, Biden MUST win both. 

The thing is, states Republican legislatures. state legislature ultimately responsible sending slate electors Capitol January 6 elect President. 

If Biden win states OVERWHELMING margins, legislatures refuse certify results send slates electors. 

And it: shitstain 280, Biden 258.

When Pappy falls sick, take behind barn put two eyes.

Heck stop that. EMTs carry guns see someone accident likely make end suffering there. Six people care. sympathy anyone thought fake gets surprised caught it, Like fucking dumb believe real loved ones friends dying it. Whats gonna take finally take seriously? isnt ""china virus"" worldwide virus doesnt give shit race are. Darwanism thing. strongest prevail weak perish. comment saying everyone caught victim natural selection, I'm speaking fools outright refuse take seriously call ""fake news"", people knowingly gather crowds, go Trump rallies ect without consideration anyone else. also subjective. population dense area rife virus also newsworthy. cons Oregon say thing Portland Hell yeah, got me. 

That hard story listen I'm saying everyone, even majority people, get reinfected. However, let's look know far:

- people lose immunity, take months so.

- majority first time infections happened past months, exponential growth sucks like that.

- absolutely way knowing many asymptomatic folks get another asymptomatic infection. could theory third round covid never know it.

Therefore, partying crowded bars 'already' got sick May, like previous poster bragging about, dumb irresponsible. Yep discovered 6 year old conspiracy theory, good job.

Can‚Äôt wait see CDC endgame nefarious thing planning ‚Äúfake pandemic‚Äù they‚Äôve somehow convinced entire planet help with.

Wow smart! know care truth. crisis exposed selfish American people are. People care impacts directly. *Thank do, no, one thing ask make safer.* CPC powerful government decided say ""no, fuck noise"" lockdown country general lockdown Wuhan watertight quarantine never previously seen human history, thus able suppress outbreak.

I'm big fan China's response next guy, China also took two months decided lockdown Wuhan. Remember whistleblowers? end, infectious dose required. Even virus cultured surfaces, enough needs enter body even become infected. Bottom line physical distancing reduced time contact others effective measures.

&amp;#x200B;

This mindset. mask never considered alternative physical distancing. need workers rights do.

odd, thought I'm sent prison give worker's rights, ... well, sent prison. therefore, longer free. work way live? Wait. got stopped everywhere US it? Trump reason still covid rest world doesn't!

""In retrospective analysis **Stateville penitentiary malaria challenge studies** conducted US military...""

You note entire article refer China all. Look much discovered since covid began. death rate significantly lower now. 

The 2nd wave one major damage back then, would found better treatment. No, actually. notion people suddenly started empathy people March 2020 media said absurd.

You don‚Äôt look cigarette smokers 60s say ‚Äúoh ***NOW*** care lung cancer?!‚Äù logic pretty asinine. newsworthy Excellent comment.

""Desperation nod"" -- fixed it. That's shame. Public school seemed go get shitty along went. Probably bad kids worse shit older got. completely true.

Because restrictions, millions children dying starvation, millions elderly people also suffering lack medical care, death undiagnosed cancer, depression stemming isolation family members, much more. Thus, restrictions hurting people age groups nothing delaying inevitable trying eradicate virus never go away. fuck think refutes wrote? WEAR MASK. say anything wearing mask? really think making refutation? Maddow actually played clips videos article, show yesterday. part draw attention ongoing issue. Unfortunately, people need see videos probably watch Maddow. trying though. take vaccine scientists say safe, nothing else. really bizarre situation.

People chant ""there evidence widespread reinfection"", possibly stop massive number people start dying reinfections possible ignore anymore. 

Yet reality anything story absolutely evidence, lasting immunity coronavirus. humans, mammals.

But infinite wisdom? course assumed beginning COVID infection confer lifelong immunity. Spanish flu ravaged stronger immune system.   
Covid death toll skews heavily old people Aliexpress where?

It's clear tens millions tests avialable need put dent pandemic. Spanish Flu would likely kill far less 1918 ventilators, antivirals, vaccines various strains influenza would save lot people back then.

Smallpox eradicated effective vaccines/ treatment regardless.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc's AZN.L COVID-19 vaccine trial United States expected resume early week U.S. Food Drug Administration completed review serious illness, four sources told Reuters.

AstraZeneca, developing vaccine Oxford University researchers, seen frontrunner race produce vaccine COVID-19 trials put hold investigate illness. Early data large-scale trials United States vaccines Pfizer Inc PFE.N Moderna Inc MRNA.O expected time next month.

Vaccines seen essential helping end pandemic battered economies around world claimed 1 million lives - 220,000 United States.

FDA ‚Äúhas come conclusion drug regulators including MHRA,‚Äù letter states.

The Health Research Authority, helps regulate UK medical research, say letter sent immediately respond questions it.

An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said communication company ‚Äúcannot verify content,‚Äù referring draft letter study participants.

‚ÄúWe also cannot comment pending FDA decision,‚Äù said.

Transverse myelitis, study volunteer believed developed, typically occurs rate 1-in-200,000 people, Offit said, would unusual see trial 9,000 individuals.

Other viruses including cause West Nile polio trigger condition, physical trauma.

Ok, Smallpox novel virus today still characteristics smallpox still around, would much better controlled monitored, would help isolate infectious prevent widespread transmission outside developing world, still problem, much like TB still Plague? Yeah hygiene knowledge antibiotics make something would probably pretty well handled rich countries, way across globe.

You know plague still exists right? couple cases pop US every year since bacteria Y. Pestis endemic rodent populations southwest. Even less developed regions, save notable outbreaks recently Madagascar parts Africa, still far less deadly virtually pandemic potential treatable modern antibiotics. Yersinia Pestis mutates becomes antibiotic resistant much like several strains TB recently, that's another story, we're talking word today, world bacterial infections already evolved immunity towards can't count vaccines exists due disease existence, would take time develop one, covid. 

Yeah, yearly flu vaccines confer immunity dominant commonly spread strains influenza viruses given flu season. Hence Spanish Flu came today, population would pre-existing immunity towards due vaccination similar strains influenza, much like survived Russian Flu Pandemic late 1890's natural immunity towards 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, younger adults alive pandemic didn't. Yeah I'm sure really cared flu deaths ran ventilators influenza year area. I'm sure get flu shot every year protect community.

It certainly super interesting see society pulls pandemic kinds innovative ideas get sparked. 

I one.. would love see kind ""dating-website"" service built configured around ""medical-testing"" (IE = wear kind bracelet required go testing month etc). potential dates would full access Medical status. people may scoff (and nobody would force participate). think would interesting way saying: ""I take health seriously I'm willing transparently show clean health record dating"". 

So many dating sites full fakers scams people deceptive.. opposite (people open/transparent) might potentially really work done correctly. 

I mean.. there's already sites like ""dnaromance.com"" genealogy sites like GEDMatch. really hope staff found ""ignoring virus safeguards work"". US invaded Iraq, town tire store ""Support Troops"" plastered everything. Banners store, pamphlets advertisements, even yellow pages. went years. One day, called asked manager. told seen years-long support troops wanted get involved. asked best way that. said, ""I'm sure mean."" - ""In ways support troops."" hemmed hawed finally told feeling sentiment. Oh, okay. nothing. Thankfully Halloween one holidays wearing mask big deal. think everyone grasping hope beat covid masks social distancing naive.

Riiight. Except countries successfully beaten it: New Zealand, South Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, HK, Japan, etc. expecting rapid acceleration week. one week expectations. obese old president probably got medical care none world would ever get entire life. random old obese dude would probably still hospital dead I'm pro-masker is, comments like he/she posted migraine headache.

So, we‚Äôve gotten people aren‚Äôt taking seriously others ask take really seriously drop ball coming together. agree, empathy needed sides. also think pandemics don‚Äôt take sides. beginning end thing right around corner, course people play doom gloom left... right now, that‚Äôs winter vaccine distribution do? feel bad people took seriously can‚Äôt get ventilator more.

Sums America's attitude * care happens me* Nobody thinks vaccine going widely available end year. Even optimistic Q2/3 2021 That's funny. said something different last time responded me. Keep digging buddy. That's Florida's self reported positivity. John's Hopkins example calculates consistently 10 percent 2 3 deaths day according worldometer.. Yeah, r/politics 'circlejerk echo chamber""..... Ok

Shocking go sub conservatives find echo chamber. concept!! country many people talking getting infected lot faster reach population immunity instead spend time fighting virus. People behave weirdest ways, touching railings biting fingernails.

I seen someone cough candy giving children. 

I became slightly disappointed human kind that.. Key Roche isn‚Äôt working coronavirus vaccine, it‚Äôs partnering Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. potential treatment. That's thing, I'm not.

That's personal intimidation young order follow lockdowns isnt useful scientific. However, time they're safe people surround - old carry another disease. even though second group follows correct guidelines, that's ultimately sabotaged non colaboration first. time also forget ultimately rely affected group live: they're workforce, composed health professionals, essential services, service provides modern condition life (entertainment etc). need people, even think don't. private life separated community, bound together. People west, mainly, failing see that. I'm banned sub suggesting weed legal bc MODs sissies. Nice try though. not, rank bottom world comes per capita infections per capita deaths.

Despite horrendous laissez faire response economy nonetheless tanked much Nordic countries.

Which shows even higher infections deaths, even mitigate economic impact.

A terrible response pandemic through. facts facts. want 'flatten curve' anyway possible

Which we've done. social safety nets place continue way people want continue 'flattening' curve. What? Lay drink bot. Yes, fully advised risks choose participate greater good. reputable sources? claims? Okay. switched back March doubt ever go back shopping store unless absolutely necessary. still buy meat fresh produce person local places stay big grocery stores. wish deadlier seize and/or block purchase threatens British supply.

It Oxford‚Äôs research made possible, country‚Äôs. suffering virus. basically immune. virus force closures, governments do. 0.05% half trivial cigarette deaths, double that. care number 3 times that, justify children suffering. Millions poverty trivialized Um. Yeah. are, man. go home laundry stuff. Sorry blows everyone‚Äôs minds I‚Äôve never seen US hospital offering laundry service.

 pandemic real, wear mask.

 Republicans like ones politicizing pandemic. Okay? that‚Äôs case people continue lives normal anyway, vaccine not. cheese supply going interrupted? Regulatory review specific process skill set nothing practicing medicine. can't plop bunch academic doctors expect know AUDIT data level FDA. may experience MEDICAL review experience REGULATORY review. BLA submission actual safety efficacy results. 

Would project managers code reviews trust developers? would get independent developers code review?

Most doctors understand GCP, GLP, GMP, GDP, etc. unless ton industry experience experience running clinical trials.

How tell FDA job zero experience knowledge actual FDA review process? ever looked final CSR before? well versed code federal regulations human experimentation? doctor reviewing cold chain custody temperature logs vaccine shipments? doctors know review electronic trial master file? 

Did know FDA conducts inspections pharma /biotech companies, vendors used trials, drug depots, randomly selected sites running trials make sure data sources trusted? safety review group going look journal article rubber stamp statistically sound?

I state I'm reviewing FDA ensuring accountable. would like FDA held accountable reviews. intentions good execution poor.

I would recommend two options. 

1. going run secondary review, actual independent inspectors job. former FDA inspectors know find issues clinical trial design, documentation, data issues, etc. Hire safety review group. guys regulatory professionals often doctors well. know issues trial design operations look for. 

2. second option would recommend hire external independent team audit FDA ensure following processes bullshit approving things based political pressure. There's point reinventing wheel bunch amateurs who've never done something like need make sure people damn job. Send team review review process make sure nothing skipped made up. agree covid vaccines like Schrodingers cat? They‚Äôre either effective effective completion phase III trials. Based current numbers, sub-Saharan Africa incredibly well.

 wonder whether perhaps genetics play. I'm Political Scientist support message. Masks indeed work wear them. Trust Scientists, trust doctors, trust nurses. What's point turnout electoral college still decider? Americans still act like everyone's votes equal. Hillary got almost 3 million votes Trump still lost. live certain states, votes eventually mean nothing. Democracy ass. Slightly topic, work lab issued scrubs working lab. go store get gas something wearing scrubs work, everyone avoids like leper. actually way I've consistently gotten 6ft berth. like ask police deal crime take shortcuts consider whole minorities dangerous arrest people 'look suspicious', police attacking society supposed protect even think job.

It turns body immune system often imperfect society immune system. No, can. treat everyone respect per default, prove deserve respect. Living US, happen 2 co-workers Poland, well educated. Since pandemic started, strongly believed young people go immune, Hydroxychloroquine cure Asian style lockdowns destroy economy left, thus targetting Trump. Fuckin‚Äô FIBs wrong 382,000,000 caught COVID recovered/died. actual number cases 8,467,520 COVID deaths 225,000 makes CFR 225,000/8,467,520 = 0.0265%.

There valid arguments lockdowns comment pure misinformation. Well covid far contagious regular flu. 

So neutral way wording 'measures reducing spread covid, far effective reducing spread flu.'

Source: I‚Äôm sure don‚Äôt think elderly vulnerable people don‚Äôt deserve protection. far economic impact, people participating economy don‚Äôt feel safe enough. support efforts get pandemic control get point feel safer. support stimulus keep businesses afloat public health crisis resolved. line accusing epidemiologists throwing children poverty silly unproductive. smoking commercials Nice hear fellow svenne! think Tegnell corrupt?
The negative deaths nothing worry about, something happen crosscheck records. numbers somehow really would show excess deaths anyway. honest knowledge safe effective vaccine would massive psychological boost.

What talking study published today journal Physics Fluids shows answer much depends whether cougher wearing mask. kind researchers found cough cloud person wearing mask 7 times larger cough cloud someone wearing typical surgical mask. cough cloud 23 times larger person wearing N95 mask. old people would wear masks dying. Hey now. us dumb. mostly people smaller cities rural areas mask wearing. Even pandemic wants vote. Nah, normal coming back either way. Like virus isn‚Äôt major threat people, what‚Äôs stopping going back normal? want people follow precautions, dooming glooming life going back normal isn‚Äôt helping. tested positive today.. see happens Makes think lyrics positivity rate - counties less affected spring Southeastern PA - several 15% 20, . agree due lack cohesive national testing strategy, really going hard truly quantify impact dust ground settles several years out.

This obviously false - please source outrageous claims.

The real issue US EU companies moved manufacturing China. Unlike first lockdown fines applicable people refuse break parties.  Umm...an exceedingly huge number people died suffered polio smallpox never shut either. Polio ravaged America decades... What? ""It bad though"". Ok? ok millions ADDITIONAL children going poverty now? problem extreme restrictions lead unneeded economic damage hurting people now. 

ALL saying reaction saving small amount old people worth causing millions children suffer. Yeah basically except totally undermine social fabric society. Helps one nations world covid 19 decisions made politicians. Yep. 2 rallies AZ yesterday, masks sight. Today AZ reported 1040 new cases shy 8000 tests. Surely rallies help! /s Lol. 

If think so. agree, also might like different uses. dont notice major difference ingesting topically, ooo boy game changer.

Might want pay attention snarky bullshit. Well scientists tell ""There virus ski resorts. People get infected spread infect people"". 

And go ""WOW really need places spread virus stay running MAX POWER"" fucking dumb. could! we're busy overthrowing every government tries that! I'd imagine there's small overlap this

The people wearing masks think thing hoax misrepresented attempt attack hateful right wing lives. calling medical staff heroes... often crying crisis actor assume it‚Äôs Subway, they‚Äôve easily worst chain I‚Äôve seen. went get sandwich Arizona May nobody fucking masks on, staff customers. eaten since pandemic started, it‚Äôll probably long time based I‚Äôve seen. restaurant didn‚Äôt take seriously doesn‚Äôt deserve cent money ever. went High School Wisconsin, nobody spent time surprised growing become unexpected idiot. then, damage already done.

We hate governor. voted him. fight court seven months. supported public health mandates attacked. still care accustomed following law. toting guns getting irrationally angry suggestion wear mask. Hell, we're probably testy people wearing masks. plurality people I'm speaking may dispersed throughout state, maybe encounter us near Illinois/Wisconsin border much. we're here. majority? Well, judging 2018 gubernatorial election not. opposition majority either. 

You're letting idiots define state they're loud arrogant. That's want. 

Wisconsin shithole state. fighting still becoming one. We've fighting uphill battle becoming one ten years. People like Illinois say struggle easy so. matter you? view Milwaukee people like outside get call gameover. Perhaps GOP win seats get veto-proof majority going redistricting negotiations, hang towel. Right now, we've got someone Tony Evers bring parity back redistricting make obvious whose voices numerous state.

tl;dr: wrong

2018 gubernatorial 	Tony Evers (D): 49.5% vote 	Scott Walker (R): 48.4% vote. Guns right. shots fired one killed injured gun marches. Compare BLM protests people killed severely injured. China makes everything - make anything US anymore. 

So either Chinese crap, NOTHING.  Jesus. entered period virus getting worse time people frustrated fatigued (so may/may ignore SaH SD). Trump cronies want downplay, deny shift toward herd immunity resulting overwhelming infections, sickness death. era live in.

Don‚Äôt forget vote!! Disagree Ireland locking down. Use every mitigation method first.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* thought Fauci didn‚Äôt lie necessarily, yes approached horribly beginning. reasoning prevents spread spreader meant wearing masks rather thinking they‚Äôre useless. really didn't. states mask mandates anything resembling proper lockdown. opinion made things worse got downsides deeper lockdown still allowed virus spread. Right second wave! would imagine anything lesson viral load helpful! everything done zoom. know way labs access research labs zoom, let know. Exactly Telegraph, afterwards lot news outlets, called ""Sweden considering local lockdowns now"". Pure clickbait. Empty platitudes teeth behind American way. minty. Right?!? thought common sense haven‚Äôt outbreaks linked planes? yes, Swedes forever either. think get little stronger (new rules literally came Uppsala) make sense go strong right spread mainly young people, ICU low, deaths low etc. 

Better needed imo. rich people rich countries busy comparing numbers (Aproximately 250 people die Swezen every day, 2 covid) much worse catastrophy happening poorer countries.

This mean lockdowns bad lockdowns scale. dont think lock Ivorytowers anymore thinking ourselves. 

This also doesnt mean lockdowns cause suffering poor countries, would probably happened anyway. 

This report UN paints horrible picture.

I‚Äôm wondering heard covid doesn‚Äôt spread food/touch, also heard need wash hands so.. contradict right? confusing reading title Perhaps slightly misleading interpreation headline writer, assuming scientist quoted meant immunity ""only"" antibodies.

What's point that? look curve various countries see lack lockdown prevented Sweden flattening curve sooner, thereby prolonging first way leading higher death count. Or, compare [NY's trajectory would say that's fault train operators serving beverages. put quote serious trial, like... why??

because ""challenge"" literally doing. 

the idea find ***SMALLEST*** viral load trigger infection.

LIVE, WILD, ACTIVE.. none attenuated shit.

this vaccine trial.

&amp;#x200B;

this ethically questionable.

DELIBERATE infection. none double blind placebo trial crap maybe get approved regulators ethics committee, studies start January results expected May 2021, government said.   controlled doses virus,** aim research team ‚ÄØwill initially discover smallest amount virus takes cause COVID-19 infection small groups healthy young people, aged 18 30, are‚ÄØ lowest risk harm, scientists leading studies said briefing. Yeah, that's I'm sitting computer nightly, going pub. Dude... reason Peru Argentina way big numbers even tho (or least Peru) got heavy mandatory lockdowns simple, ita ""lockdowns dont work"" ""the virus spread anyway"", many people dense areas DIDNT CARE, oh god, literally preffer affront cops fines obeying lockdowns (in initial months police force overwhelmed could make people obey fricking army joined)... Also, China's approach wouldnt work, effective, fact one effective methods solve problem, done country government total unquestionable control citizens ""rights"" infection hasnt spread naational territory. Duh doy spreading disease I'm Ireland totally get ""rapid accelation"" line since hit us like that. cases doubled last 14 days. 

October 1st example 442 cases day, gradually rising. October 14th 1,095 cases per day. October 18th 1,283 cases. 

Once rapid acceleration starts, shoots fast. wear mask time outside house still maskless gatherings outside people household ""always"" wearing mask. people ""always"" wearing mask people forced back work school chance someone maskless social circle getting sick higher. Except unconstitutional legal quarantine. NZ many problems own, don‚Äôt take reddit gospel considering ones praising never even there. course could. That's mere existence vaccine, widely administered, enough lift restrictions.

But sheer number people vaccinated mean need take trust, because, we're done vaccinating, virus unlikely encounter enough vulnerable people continue spread. 

If 80% people vaccinated, vaccine 80% effective, mean get 36% cases - means infected person transmits 36% much. 10 patients would infected 12 people, infect 4. Then, 10 patients die get better (hopefully latter) 4 sick people instead 12. them, 4 sick people infect 1 2, on. 

Once numbers reduced combination social distancing vaccination, virus struggle return large numbers. pisses nurses come store wearing masks wrong. think people would know do. Keep up, then. Right up. guess Swedish lockdown looks like. hope effective guidelines. Yes, surge deaths initial wave could avoided early lockdown. What's argument? time voting.. This. 74% controls always wear mask Comparing March irrelevant. Well never know widespread disease was. 

Israel locked 2-3 weeks seems gotten outbreak completely control controlled doses virus, aim research team ‚ÄØwill initially discover smallest amount virus takes cause COVID-19 infection small groups healthy young people, aged 18 30, are‚ÄØ lowest risk harm, scientists leading studies said briefing.

They also treat volunteers Gilead GILD.O antiviral drug remdesivir soon infected

Clearly scientists leading study concerned ethics, think found reasonable compromise trolling ;)  
I found wording interesting/a bit ominous. fines would need sort legal basis. Who's saying Sweden failure? I'm not.

All spikes period, fyi. look curves, Finland Norway got flattened early lockdown. idea ignoring lockdown biggest difference higher death rate amongst elderly 2020 expected.

You can't really say expected measures protect elderly taken early on, unscientific, basically picking choosing basic data confirm biases

Yeah, let's ignore locking meant Sweden prolonged surge compared countries did. almost though data corroborate something get answer comparing out-of-context numbers matter might wish it.

Why explain reason took Sweden long flatten curve then? None reasons gave relevant. Emergency meeting.

We really embarrassing country. Yep. could've better prepared for, ramping local production January.

(And didn‚Äôt get sick, opens whole new barrel fun: COVID-19 works way, people disease recovered could wind picking ‚Äî spreading ‚Äî novel coronavirus despite symptomatic.)

2) reinfections 40 million cases, really concern

That's correct. sequence strain vast majority people. 30 million cases, MUCH smaller number. even then, reinfection strain count proof. 

Here's basically saying: people died traveling, 19 died going space back. Therefore, space travel safest way travel. 

Do see problem?

3) b-cells give immunity, actual presence antibodies.

Not necessarily true, never proven COVID (or even SARS coronaviruses) death toll growth explosive harsher strain took hold. dare anyone angry prime social lives cut short. Everyone able stay home play video games indefinitely like me!

/r/averageredditor ...current Swedish governmental restrictions make mandating lockdown infeasible.

Actually, illegal. Lockdown prohibited Swedish constitution, specific: ""The instrument government"" 2nd chapter, articles 6-8. read yourself. ""Laws"" section find constitution PDF.

To change needs two acts parliament general election between. didn‚Äôt question that, questioned mask bearing actually catching covid. Yes. ""old news"" 7 months ago. 

It really maddens depresses little changed. selfish stupid people been. feel like president administration telling elite donors bad actually saying essentially harmless public motivated sociopathic tendencies involving making money pandemic using political gains. held responsible response criminally. Ugh....

All pandemics history ended natural herd immunity. I‚Äôll give three guesses perpetrators political leanings. Mods keep removing posts lmao subtle suggestion super elderly person recover concerned? What's point articles keep circulating? still comparing covid h1n1? Danish mix p‚Äôs b‚Äôs time. Maybe lot spelling mistakes. friend called Tobbe gets mistaken Toppe time. I‚Äôve never heard anyone called Toppe Denmark. 

Maybe sent paper beer review? accessibility enough computers household, lack internet unreliable internet. multiple go overs material breaks call-in times channels radio stations. TV radio stations wide accessibility zoom classes much less draining-I hate zoom calls also work sipping whiskey? Seriously. would make feel better work bar. Thanksgiving coming. usual day Thanksgiving shopping rush. Christmas. New Years.

You think 2020 shitty year? get worse. takes one asymptomatic staff member super spreader. Staff interact residents including medical care, help activities daily living like dressing, bathing sometimes eating. ask staff given N95s wear? Probably probably surgical masks. 

It's easy see spread. Many staff members also work one job, maybe even another nursing facility. 

This ""protect elderly live lives normally"" garbage. staff would quarantine residents infinitely, never coming home children. That's thing. absolutely worrying much. control think government has? benefit see getting this? 


Government general successful citizens healthy, happy, peaceful. everyone's best interest eradicate deadly viruses, vaccine important step process. right vaccine final step. plenty people cannot get vaccines plenty people refuse vaccines. take combo vaccines, masks, distancing, avoidance eradicate this. No. not. Slovakia, agree mass testing, way intend. want polling places(e.g. Schools). really want room hundreads people :) positive now, ia big chance afterwards.

We wait results, together people. someone room positive(this antigen tests, could mean healthy), then?  combination tight fitting N-95 mask cheap goggles prevent/ limit viral particles entering mouth, nose, *and* eyes (which thing). 

That leaves skin surfaces potential vectors entry body, hence sanitizer washing shit often thoroughly... worth arguing people, continually move goalposts. ""Oh, bad"" ""No Child Left Behind"" Sweden still bad. Killing public live completely worth it. Shit. need get job Target. I'd set life week. think people able smoke gasoline pumps?

Yes, real world he's going ""re-elected"" instead. start playing footage COVID-filled ICUs hospital. People saying goodbye grandma Zoom fucking iPad. 16yr old soccer players ventilators. Nurses doctors breaking down, crying, quitting.

literally lol Businesses self determine whether need stay trading, make reasonable decision. Wales, anyone work home required law, retail shops etc close retail customers, could stay open deliveries etc, there's load requirements kinds stuff.

Factories: Basically, come whether make essential, whether decision stay open could reasonable. That's obviously massively subjective, report, even anonymously, think decision stay open unreasonable. access support help stay afloat decide stay open rather send home, would _fairly_ good reason that. Yes, also ban visits elder care centers lifted recently. restaurants adhering social distancing rules close. actually restrictions well, mostly built upon non-enforced recommendations. mean, doesn‚Äôt help Scott Atlas, new head White House coronavirus task force, tweeted, ‚ÄúMasks work?

Also keep mind essential campaign appear strong sick. 


Why hear it? Part Trump's overall strategy life stay top news headlines, done that. multiple important stories since diagnosis, since publicly showing signs struggling COVID news cannot report it. calling heroes 

At point they're hostages. Meaningless interactions

AKA: living life

The weirdo site fucking sucks  UK lockdown. pretty common March there‚Äôs still tons people flying regardless - every flight I‚Äôve packed there‚Äôs full lots local airport. It‚Äôs like airports ghost towns anymore responsible regarding people encounter.

COMMUNISM! SOCIALISM! LIBERAL HOOEY! 

""Freedom"" means right infect whoever want! tread me! research! 

/s case.  literally teach class 20-something college age students whose lives currently fully normal, go off. Wow text quoted doesn‚Äôt even appear study INFLUENZA. Relevant: Worst camel ever wish people would stop taking masks interviewed giving speech. often see someone pull mask soon microphone put front them. Please keep masks people see speaking mask normal. Ok whatever...üòÇ Yup. sooner realize this, better be.

The sunk cost fallacy kicking slowly people realizing gave lot little benefit. either dig demand lockdowns realize made mistake understand end coming time soon, time move Asians shorter average though still debate? people keep needing told work? baffles me

Totally, sadly confusion inconsistencies advice start.

The understanding face covering reduces amount transmission.

Therefore normal person attending store transport might exposed particles via eyes mask still prevents majority form entering effective entry point.  

Assuming viral load theory correct could exposed smaller amount contract virus.

A good confirmation mask efficacy, 2 American Hairdressers CV19+, cut 140 peoples hair. 

Customer workers wearing masks one customer got Danish municipality L√¶s√∏ got first corona cases weeks back. Right it‚Äôs upper half Danish ranking municipalities 558 cases per 100k. 10 cases absolute numbers. 

It‚Äôs island around 1770 inhabitants. *is* nonsense. user seems like one redneck freedom-lovers care others' safety. become disappointed vaccine we're magically back ""old normal"", self blame listening people like *me* trying warn them. Whatever‚Äôs profitable Plenty countries crushed cases tiny amount. worse second wave. trouble imagining returning Ohio well. Gov DeWine said whatever needs keep people safe, think political gumption close essential back (not without things getting *really* bad). really perfect storm; major surge starting head traditional cold/flu season, lots people pandemic fatigue kind giving ('ve noticed drop mask compliance last month 6 weeks), socially interactive travel-heavy months year around corner. Gah.. look Ireland shows unsustainable is:

A six week period Level 5 restrictions cost exchequer region ‚Ç¨1.5 billion, cost 150,000 jobs, T√°naiste said.

The combined cost three government schemes - pandemic unemployment payment (PUP), Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) Covid Restrictions Subsidy Scheme (CRSS) ‚Ç¨200 million per week.

Asked financial impact measures, Taoiseach said would funded borrowing, acknowledge long term impact significant. ‚ÄúWe year, next year. need vaccine next year,‚Äù said.


However, Minister Business Leo Varadkar said figures could impacted failure businesses, would also affect tax revenues. Mr Varadkar told business leaders done ‚Äúnothing wrong‚Äù recent months. ‚ÄúIn fact, you‚Äôve done everything right,‚Äù said, adding decisions taken last night driven ‚Äúneed reduce interactions occur adults different call em face bras...when see people nose sticking wanna say ""pull face bra up, nose showing!"" Nah. think so. Judging comments 200.000+ excess deaths caused COVID, think deniers rethink views. Unfortunately... going rough winter understand exactly masks do.

my point remains valid Keep parroting lies. Except I'm it. dont issue control? government represents business community. Businesses controlling you? Yes won‚Äôt end Protecting vulnerable allowing widespread community spread totally viable solution though. /s Guess shouldn‚Äôt prevent deaths then? bother hospitals? That‚Äôs stupid argument sounds. dying, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd cry another tune. pipe cunt. virus long term data. mention one overrun hospitals like happening Wisconsin. wear mask quit tough guy. Probably outlying somewhat isolated area. Nothing happened months. Everybody let guard down. everyone got infected one got it. 

Exactly experts saying would happen. Didn‚Äôt China this!? single person questioned pointed absurd numbers.

160 million tests 85k cases!? people get even know survival rate near flu is.

Hey let's destroy economy. Wtf seems good news makes shocking compare countries listed. compared globally considered variables would see response fairly middle road. Give paid sick time bring healthy staff proper PPE. that‚Äôs constituents want? Unfortunately social media spent past 6 months crowing vaccine unsafe president trying get re-elected reap sowed. ya know, rest world past 9 months. That's thing it, there's option. really pissed people somehow blamed Governor Cuomo New York killing old people something. Like complaint him. would like do? enough people want job people need care Check much wild life biodiversty cotton kills. polyester acrylic made.

People want save environment, would rather plastic-clothes transported thousands miles instead wearing fur made country.

It achieved new kind crazy. *they're NY wont lockdown overrating first NY lockdown. exceptions everything. parents work insurance never work home exceptions. like concept, maybe without ugly spiritless modernism common nowadays. actually read emails, secret know? 

Anyone read bunch collegues discussing immunity. discussing immunity type pandemic would youre job. No, I'm pointing mask debaters want argue Covid-19 small flies masks problem. argue things 100 times smaller, CO2 oxygen atoms, can't make masks. People work to. Suddenly break room (not including eating, duh take that) office everyone takes mask like we're unable catch cause work together something. government? sounds like nonsense I‚Äôm almost camp maybe regular cough flu something recovered said corona sympathy would heroic recovered boost stock Regeneron insider trading‚Ä¶ going *drive* buses?

If rule goes effect, there‚Äôs going severe shortage transit drivers many medical conditions excuse masking. read part said Juuling aka smoking putting air? Dumb response virus spoke Spanish better believe they‚Äôd masking up. also close sports arenas shut colleges secondary high schools? still 50 person limit gatherings since March. obviously needs strict organization separation people. Summary Imperial here: mention study experimental lists point, difficult ascertain far along ethics etc. register interest however. don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre allowed drink train. coffee. People compare Sweden countries time positive manner Sweden. I'm presenting side. Employees still forced worked. 

What option there? nursing home. residents need care. aren't. problem blind assumption lockdowns effective reducing total fatality, rather spreading fatalities longer period. True analysis pandemic properly done years now, current data indicates lack correlation lockdown severity fatality given period. 

People want think that, ""doing something"" better than, ""doing nothing"", reaffirm initial choices despite evidence contrary. Mostly idiots spread disease you. favourite bit downvote positive news regarding COVID developing countries. 
Like ‚Äúthese people poor malnourished. aren‚Äôt dying already?‚Äù/s

None seem realise morbid obesity ageing populations proven responsible greater mortality rates. Interesting - thanks response. must nice stupid Yes, totally agree. ""fear"" sentiment often yelled community people wear masks. live fear, wear mask reason wear seatbelt. I'm stupid. That's honestly bad upper end. antibodies tested. Thst doesnt mean isnt immunity response. Article headline misleading. Good argument. Why? mean like new Zealand, Australia, South Korea, sever othe r countries done? Yeah..impossible..let's give up. 

Also, masks social distancing reduce spread.

What talking about? Yeah apparently. thought population Sweden. Still per capita could bad measure compare comes numbers far away absolute terms still small. 

For example grandmother's home municipality 1 infected last 14 days. means 44,9 infected per 100K inhabitants, bad cities. person infects 1 person municipality paper looks bad based per capita number Oslo.

So yeah take per capita numbers account sometimes absolute numbers better indication. Still Denmark worse Norway, Sweden dwarfs corner rest fall winter. Uh...it‚Äôs right among worst world still. point? Sweden didn‚Äôt save economy people still died, would have. reckless. luckily effect face masks marginal. Behavioural changes keeping distance limiting travel contact moments key reducing spread. snowed yesterday. thinking!? Cool, literally **zero** ways knowing many mild infections 1918. know majority people infected influenza days mild symptoms much 60-70% people completely asymptomatic. 

If numbers, hard numbers based testing, pandemic I'd wager they'd look similar.

In 2020, ways testing diagnosing people even single sniffle, mild infections show it. likely people 1918 mild cold- like illnesses actually H1N1 Spanish Flu, mild cases. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm estimating anything ongoing pandemic, we're still thick it. actual numbers statistics yet written discussed argued rest century. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back February early March, testing capacity bother testing anyone already hospital confirmed exposed it.

We zero ways testing people influenza back 1918, even realize caused virus decade later. Yeah hear medical friends say sick 3 days big deal. Crazy affects people differently live Wisconsin one cares. single one us. Well yeah, there's covid too. healthcare worker 100%. empty praises heroes even faded. sad dirty ""Heroes work here"" sign outside hospital entrances. Meanwhile, people politicians continue disrespect healthcare workers ignoring science downplaying media. 

I working 50+ hrs weekly staying away everything like responsible adult since March. watching collegues getting burnt fallen sick, one dying covid. hard watch news nowadays boils blood. Congrats, 4 negative pressure rooms end one medsurg floors. ordered 6 pack last week got fucking O'doul's beer. bet picker hootin' storm. turn tables. Definitely on-shoring better idea, moving jobs back Australia countries India. others been, ill informed moronic. this, lying taking resources away need fooling idiots like you. People like net negative society. agree, challenge trials help us find whether leading vaccines safe effective (in preventing severe disease), especially since Phase 3 trials deliver preliminary data soon. would need another justification, determining effective vaccines providing sterilizing immunity least 1.1 Indian Ocean tsunami. Ikea furniture fairly simple put together albeit time-consuming. Seems immunity + mutations answer articles read. Descendents 1918 flu still around today. Good luck getting conservatives care countrymen women main problem majority countries handling virus pretty poorly, travel Australia could spread again. life expectancy 1850s like 40 

that's half children died. Good job !

But reading lockdown dragged months, I'm happy live Europe lockdowns seem tolerated.  Starring Pauly Shore I'm sorry find 220k dead (and counting) boring. Maybe try different sub?  give ideas. That‚Äôs conclusion one make wanting downplay everything people spread virus get people killed.  dismiss situation feelings many, many people hasn‚Äôt affected lives negative way (yet). personally, thing changed work home (a plus IMO) see friends family less often different ways (outside/with masks). think it‚Äôs OK recognize affecting us different ways us traumatized. Agreed. could someone writing article includes numbers comparison know accounting population? would take work research world populations years, divide calculator. common, point wonder often intentional, people seem notice it, think important.  bad part young people surging area causes spike weeks later. study drew conclusion. interesting factor deaths. Homicide seems increased throughout country, least 24% compared last year. That's least 3,000 extra deaths using 2018 15,000 homicides.

So can't get help, can't take available steps better mental health without feeling like everyone thinks I'm terrible. wish stronger.  Maybe could mean testing people sick anyone asymptomatic?? That's guess part though way essentially burn yourself. Tell me, nonsense comment could construed anyway debatable argumentable? Ya made shit joke substance. 

Only thing gleemed can't argue. ya double downed embarrassed further. would look actual scientific evidence think themselves.... Oh. Yeah. 

Understood. 1.3 million automobile fatalities global statistic. 38,000 number US. rate declining since peak 1937.

Meanwhile COVID officially killed 6 times many people US (8 times go excess deaths) anything declining. 100% mask compliance people wearing correctly: unbelievably, yes! hardware store, no, neighborhood supermarket shockingly good compliance lately. hardly see anyone since visits off-peak brief. Since masks aimed reducing droplet transmission, view cleanliness mask issue. self checkouts cleaned open I'm one first use them. Plus wash, wipe, repackage quarantine item reach house. Supposedly major transmission risk anyway. usually avoid baskets grab bag checkout need capacity. Since I'm giving extra attention items home, worry unduly someone touching picked up. many. medical advancements done wonders keep people alive longer put death ill. 

Most people dying Covid today old already ill would alive 100 years ago.  Australian New Zealand approach definetly working far better many countries. Europe even though new restrictions, fairly poorly enforced followed all. Yes like China North Korea.. apologize. me, question ""traumatized what?"" middle mass global tragedy also rude. hard feelings. Yeah flu, bro. H1N1 least.  
50 mil killed least lot holiday get togethers florida happen outdoors, sure extra gatherings bring extra risk. That's big one. Everyone spiking. Winter telling. different virus, virus we're dealing right fact carried transmitted bats, I'm pretty sure currently bats carrying it. walk around snot inside mask. great reason, happened today gross literally cheeseheads. brains, cheese. also going summer months virus naturally spread slower. 

Queensland looks lot like Alberta BC reopened. provinces declared second wave. California too. know lot us totally holed September due heat ash, October, outdoor activities alive well. First think nurse. think am, hope I'm paid well? think got correct. Sounds like you‚Äôre trying project random hatred towards Trump know lazy anything? It‚Äôs total non sense take people enclosed car make walk street people.

It‚Äôs ^this^ sort thing single handedly causing people say FUCK this. don‚Äôt know single person didn‚Äôt take seriously first, wonky Simon says rules wearing otherwise worried people. That‚Äôs we‚Äôre testing now. statistic you‚Äôre looking approval for? 

If so, you‚Äôd prove people 50+ disposable income. 

If do, yes, COVID-19 death count would heavily skewed towards demographic disposable income. 

And important exactly? might missing something. Many conservatives indifferent deaths unless know someone died. coronavirus even bad flu. Looks like great news. seems like Australia New Zealand managing Corona Virus far better European countries. flu infectious viral infection, pneumonia caused factors, mainly bacterial infection lungs. (ie infectious). caused viral infection that's less likely, mild. Even medical advancement can't prevent deaths hospitals overflowing people refuse care. point, know virus transmitted by/to many different species, including wild animals. know bats, example, host/carry/transmit virus without ever becoming sick themselves. also expect made freezers exist years frozen objects, bits ice.

Even manage achieve state 0 humans active cases covid, eliminate animal population environment? cost monetary.. would take significant damage environment (and risk, since may well encounter much dangerous new disease poking around). Plague, ebola, polio, rabies, MERS, many dangerous/deadly diseases still us they're endemic animal populations. think would seen schools HVAC main culprit. much. so-called medical advancement completely ignoring insights discovered Spanish Flu, notably fact take patients outside sun, death rate greatly decreases. focused drugs miss lot things make pharmaceutical companies lot money, like high doses vitamin D3. Angeles strictest lockdown entire nation due Newsom Garcetti.

Maybe that‚Äôs reason see cases moment? cares much rich tory cronies. Would 4agher spend 7 billion SERCO track trace rather proper NHS one.

The answer fairly rare like accurate long term symptoms reinfection.

Does happen? Yes, percentage cases total population, no. Don‚Äôt get form tax relief homeownership benefits? GI Bill type stuff? away* oops People STILL understand death rate increases infection rate. 

Say 1% population contracts it, manageable within healthcare system 5% people die (.05% total population). say 3% population contracts healthcare system overloaded, people start dying homes hallways hospitals lack care - 10% death rate that's .3% population dead. 6x people dead.

Made numbers, yes, illustrate principal. Yesterday wondering OurWorldInData going handle suspiciously timed private lab negative tests data dump.

Tragically Sweden hardly alone failure, seem one repeatedly held kind ""surprising"" ""success"" (while conveniently ignoring prior death tolls). Great, need 8 mio FFP2 masks per day now? realise country saying ""Use FFP2 mask mask mandate""? Germany suggests using OP masks cloth masks. Yes absolutely ditto nations responses I'd guess phones, pen &amp; paper quite effective, least cooperative population, reasonable resource scaling policy enforcement quarantine measures. Regional lockdowns

Regional recommendations* problem forgetting discovering there's 6month immunity happen there's vaccine even objectively can't say still massively overwhelm also strictly approached social distancing + mask scenario proper social awareness. idea simply fix shit. like yeah help, sU inevitable incredibly naive dangerous long term idiots wearing masks short term first generation candidates seem working. find candidates unnecessary unethical.

The virus widespread enough test vaccine. 

I don‚Äôt agree someone inhale lab made version virus cure know long term effects. It‚Äôs unnecessary wrong. 48 downvotes, comment removed still think right everyone else wrong. Check.  Yeah, say want... it‚Äôs true. lancet highly reputable disagrees you. point?

[Read transcripts round COVID denier. acknowledges exists need protect vulnerable letting young people live lives. he's ignoring experts. link example opinions highly qualified university professors scientists.

As far ‚Äòstudies‚Äô go...there number show homemade face coverings (research terminology switched ‚Äòmask‚Äô ‚Äòcovering‚Äô also) used absolute last resort situations even thin basic surgical masks 300% effective. homemade dirt rag marginal absolute best scenarios. Virtue signaling. Nothing more. Seems easiest solution allow boot passengers complying mid-flight, no? Good!! There's reason think can, fact, help prevent getting infected (PVP-I) disinfectant  lived Texas see vast majority wear public. choose home friends may another story, mask utilization extremely high DFW area. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mention speed said transportation best results? anyone know travel regulation outside country? might need water burn there's uncontrolled spread

like European continent? uncontrolled spread? I'm sure areas China problems detailed, some. They've succeeded despite issues. Sure, nations autocratic police states, demonstration achieved, nonetheless. 

More practically, seems successful ""free"" nations followed strategies broken 2 categories depending situation: starting measures early enough there's already real outbreak area (like Taiwan), already dealing major outbreak playing catch-up. 

If starting early enough, mask requirements (even per citizen distribution quotas like Taiwan), aggressively ramping testing, implementing effective TTI program seemed work. 

If already got outbreak, hard lockdown seems shortest path back controlling virus. scenario, unless essential job, commuting anyplace duration lockdown. without essential jobs, cannot work home would need subsidized government lockdown. Essentially lockdown-duration UBI. state Victoria Australia got recent surge control 100 days, probably could better even stricter. wonder 6 8 weeks would do? 

At time, government gear coming lockdown. Working good TTI ready, preparing stimulus bolster economy, mask mandates ready, etc. 

DO RE-OPEN SOON. think New Zealand set standard determine OK re-open. nations re-opened earlier paying mistakes. 

If EU can't coordinate strategies entire region once, individual countries even individual regions within countries execute strategies. 

Will pain go lockdown? Certainly, balance would almost certainly better protracted waves infection nations currently suffering. would likely cost less beginning end well. Yeah NY still problem taking bus guy gets mask coffee hand. Bus drives tells needs wear pulls holds saying coffee. sits perpendicular eating drinking 20+ minutes mask on. nowhere move super uncomfortable. eventually put shouldn‚Äôt even allowed transit way. another guy shortly decides hoodie enough holds bus 10 minutes arguing holding hoodie mouth enough stops. People really inconsiderate selfish say one side politicized mask usage? really blind? Well, one citations article guess presume say that. So, can't go grocery store, unsafe. SOMEONE ELSE can.

Let's call attitude is. lostsoul2016 privilege. many severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronaviruses found, yes RaTG13 closest known ancestor SARS-CoV-2. seems likely miners became ill SARS related coronavirus, know people tried say evidence RaTG13 modified, leaked WIV. stretch. SARS related coronaviruses endemic horseshoe bats. likely happened stated. guys got infected SARS virus, possibly RaTG13, transmissible human human, infection died miners recovered, died. types things happen often, ie avian influenza. Traveled recently Florida, San Francisco, Alaska Airlines. Masks required times, would admit anyone board plane without mask, even infant children.

This needs standard across airlines imo. Yeah yeah yeah, constant refrain proven true months past prime. uh, what? Free Market literally means market sets PRICES goods restrict buy whom. 

But absolutely set product quality standards. testing approval MEDICAL industries no-brainer.

By extreme definition, ZERO free markets anywhere - form anarchism capitalism.  Good lord that's still cringe inducing think about. So, vaccine way, makes eradication via lockdowns even attractive. Trump say? /s Gosh, word happens new disease enters propagates among susceptible population. One outbreak kills million people globally first 9 months first year. One becomes 3rd leading cause death US. One first US death reported right around first March. Oh, tracking outbreak since January, debunk wierd March thing?

China reported 4.9% gain, Vietnam reported 2.6% gain, Taiwan 1%. New Zealand suffered 12% loss (because economy tourism dependent) projected remarkable 11.5% recovery last quarter. whole ""lives vs livelihoods"" always false dichotomy, good pandemic response good economy even care lives all.

It heartbreaking real struggle. means that, even 10 months pandemic, still managed fully grasp situation.

The direct fatality rate Covid one part problem. much bigger problem relatively high proportion hospitalized patients, threatening crash hospital system rather quickly let virus run rampant. That's lot positivity country.  Swedish exceptionalism think lockdowns necessitates right wing views? Number deaths continue stabilize going down. ffs...seriously? -_- unacceptable. care Republican Democrat. terrorism. raise small militias amount guns US worrying.

Yea, tough chance. immigration policies make Trump look like no-borders anarchist. applies Canada. WI working office since late May. one cares. wear masks correctly, social distancing non-existent.

I need validation. I'm stating simple fact. I'm done. Same. pandemic used drive north pick stepson occasion. Imagine car full black children watching horror pass Obama effigies hanging trees billboard-sized signs Hillary beheaded. It‚Äôs normal there. Northern WI makes weep humanity. mine closest ancestor Sars-CoV2 found, thus far found anywhere else. provides interesting clues, although thought Sars-CoV2 RatG13 diverged many decades ago. master's thesis found, thought miners died fungal infection. calls desperate measures. Break jazz hands! dude look around *Jason Garrett entered chat* collectively strike? want see something crushing? videos back interviewing nurses, medical staff, etc. 

People who, everything normal, already working extremely important hard job.

But pandemic twice so. seeing breaking hard watch. 

I wish could find vids cant seem able to. brigader skeptic sub lol chances go see mass runs grocery stores lines get hours long--especially staff start getting sick there's less people work registers.

Back April, local store getting picked basically minute opened--people would line 5 AM, come doors opened 8, load cart cart cart like Supermarket Sweep. Curbside delivery booked three/four weeks solid.

And minuscule amount actual spread. social philosophical issues don‚Äôt pertain topic hand, don‚Äôt right perspective. You‚Äôre asking hand outs, don‚Äôt talk pay, pull boot straps up. problems problems you‚Äôve made mediated stopped thinking. /s

I‚Äôm sick ‚Äúindividualistic‚Äù mindset doesn‚Äôt want generalized, live generalized collectivist nation together.. point can‚Äôt find single spot hasn‚Äôt corrupted humans planet, maybe people understand individuals beyond scope thoughts. collectively irrational animals want keep living peacefully together need understand individualistic mindsets healthy hold high moralistic standings.

I dont see speak would ridicule lockdown. seem ignorant insensitive. can‚Äôt find anyone irrational upvoted here. check place everyday I‚Äôve never seen conspiracies denial upvoted corrected 6k excess death number year far

'No matter slice it, lack lockdown end costing Sweden +/- 6k extra deaths **during peak outbreak**.'

That clarified comment previous reply. Never said whole community spread surge already ""locked down""

Yeah, look difference curves then. think explains difference trajectories countries? - Brought British Council Untourism link things claim saying stuff aren‚Äôt.

Still ranked 27th world every measure.

Yes, four weeks ago *seemed* like Sweden going get second wave. fact Tegnell taking victory tour media crow it.

How'd work out? arent wearing mask 24/7 literally killing grandma bother wasting time, kind care others around them, interests. Maybe he'll learn hard way might make less selfish person doubt even would make better person.

Far many hoaxers anti covid people today. clear, mask talking about. seen reports isn‚Äôt ideal hospital use. can't imagine anyone wanting teacher, even covid. adds another level messed-upness. top that, teachers Texas can't strike without risking everything including pension. WTF?! know side care poverty people dying COVID. saying Wisconsin, things get really bad recently. People bubbles think happening are. hitting different states different times (though rising everywhere due second wave).

Wisconsin getting bad second wave even started, really desperate there. Nope. abdominal cavity.  insane. obtain 5.5 million antigen tests?

You order china. privatly month ago, cost like $10 test. ""Biden listen Scientists!""

-Donald Trump Yeah, good hospitals turn people away let people die can‚Äôt afford profit motive = ranked 27th world healthcare.

Again get it, don‚Äôt care dead Americans. People really bad estimating risk, part 80 kabillion. No, risky demographic group.  know

There 1.5 billion cases swine fly 2009. 40 million cases corona. recently Lincoln County shocked find not. One. Single. Mask. Being. Worn. Everyone maskless. Ridiculous.

/s We‚Äôre also coming holiday shopping season. don‚Äôt see Black Friday happening 80k+ cases day. would anyone public pay loans, especially Cali taxes mess even more. owes lot money loans taxes kill everyday. say Vietnam like 40 covid deaths total. It‚Äôs really fact get assistance government. can‚Äôt keep locking without continued assistance federal government.

And yes, agree. failure levels. fact insufficient help people enable actually lock properly definitely one aspect failure. far evidence proving efficacy masks reducing transmission virus droplets aerosolized particles. mass use masks combined proper pandemic hygiene education curtail spread virus. Simple factual. latching onto early studies confirm biases. Deniers complicit infections death resulted virus. something psychologically fucked head persist denying something simple wearing mask. Right wing brainwashing serious problem society. Impossible media spinning saying increase fear compliance. like half century rate apparently handful doctors/nurses decided live covid, people die, die, yet majority still saying need take seriously?

Conservatives Corona: Pro-Choice Honestly...‚Äùmuddle through‚Äù basically pandemics work. media machine set maximum pandemic scare.   They've emphasizing case numbers without context justify wrong actions since beginning. 

It's anti-science shitshow.   Lets see trend numbers ICU capacity day day.  Nobody show it.  Nobody shows graphs deaths per million per day either... cases. True. Maybe agree strict bubble seeing anyone outside family? avoided ""nonessential outings"" since March?  grocery shopping online? friends' families' houses patio beers, etc? Never went hiking?  Never little road trip?

I think that's really difficult many people.  either risking COVID actively damaging mental health. That's going easier choice people 7+ months in. I'm glad everybody Reddit perfect followed every rule 7 months next many months years, but, something many people going choose able do. risk COVID scary anymore point versus alternative definitive loss time one life get live.   different threshold everyone. Yeah, I'm trying imply excess deaths high, trying insinuate due COVID. believe true. simply saying deaths excess previous 5-year average really 1:1 count COVID deaths, firmly believe best metric have. can't know things we're made aware them.

Except know country apart authoritarian 100% mask usage rates. Seems like bitter get input fight virus personal vendetta Dr. Tegnel. Understandable, still think grammar syntax important, especially insulting somebody based perceived lacking mental faculties. Missouri logged in. healthy 27 year old can't work covid fuck sure! I'm getting frustrated Aspirus' attitude need step practice preach. September, Wisconsin pace 599 car accident death 2020. Coronavirus deaths - 1,624. Stop driving! healthcare worker always rolled eyes ""we thank essential workers BS"". BS folks holding signs social distancing masks sight sometimes.

And cut pay shortly too. dementia alzheimer's stay rooms quartined. Also cannot restrain them. must Illinois Sucks we're capable handling 6 months ago. Death rates plummeted. Doctors know treat virus much better (our obese &amp; old president kicked 4 days), PPE widely available, &amp; ICUs ramped capacity. Testing still ideal, they're easier get &amp; improving every day.

Risk mitigation needs continued get finish line spring Picked good year start flossing mouthwashing every day huh It'll depend.

If walking quiet neighbourhood, mask serve make uncomfortable. walking big shopping district many people gather, yes that'd situation wearing mask optimal. Wtf, I'm 19 near anything like that.  appreciate optimism, share it. 

This comes 2 states: PA AZ. republican state legislatures. Biden win OVERWHELMING margins state, legislatures simply decline accept results appoint slates republican electors.

Does matter from, given whole mask debate still ongoing.

You sound like trying argue study supports.

Surely information helps get message posted.

Reddit seem post made anyone else. situation got better though? deaths way peak? Yeah, it‚Äôs bad here. live one liberal areas country, I‚Äôm still shocked see _every day_ around here. One kids talking classmate classmate‚Äôs yard. 10 feet apart wore masks. classmates mom came home said kid, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need wear mask‚Äîshe‚Äôs _friend_!‚Äù Like, what? virus doesn‚Äôt spread friends?

Local bars restaurants decided (with local state government‚Äôs support) everything‚Äôs ok long people eating drinking outside. _throngs_ customers outside. masks, social distancing. 

I won‚Äôt even mention staggering number people don‚Äôt understand mask mouth _and_ nose effective. 

We made huge mistake telling people wearing mask protects _others_. don‚Äôt act like care _others‚Äô_ health. ""Find Martyr, Solution"" -U.S Hand-picked yes, cherry-picked no. roundtable supposed forum discussion, equitable distribution representatives various viewpoints topic. describe 3 academics roughly similar outlooks roundtable intellectually dishonest. panel, convened give DeSantis justification pursuing form top mitigation efforts.

There lot kids need school. kids parents working anyways. sped kids getting services, risk youth foster low income kids continuing fall behind well peers. ill say again, families hunkering home, theyre essential workers going exposed since March.

I'm high school teacher tell staff ready go back, months ago. ready jobs help kids better futures. What? Per capita stats independent total population size. cases crushed bigger ever. It‚Äôs 2nd wave new american way. always like friend. please explain think so. Scandals happen often they‚Äôre longer scandalous. I‚Äôve covid free whole time. 100% sure several comorbidities. leaders cult tell wear mask - sheep follow. exactly. recently decided visit friends (2 families total) halloween (we used get together pretty much every month covid) everyone kept masks on, stayed outside, share food (host separate packages everyone) people ate stepped WAY side ate putting masks back joining group. REALLY feel different good time. choose focus what's different miss good stuff. lessons learnt irrelevant near future. help us next pandemic. one. (The lessons learnt start pandemic, learn live it)

I constantly read smart things Asians West.

The Chinese instance test entire city find positives, isolate positives.

We could also West - would huge help make areas virus free - also local businesses.

ALso Chinese test everybody entering country, isolate positive.

In west, let anybody come infect away sick lol.

Those 2 things really rocket science.

Also masks. know minimize contagion indoors. low fruit use indoors. something got done couple weeks, takes many months. OMW store buy mouthwash aisle 10.  mean, people called parents kids murdered Sandy Hook crisis actors also calling people afflicted working help COVID-19 crisis actors, too?

*shocked Pikachu face* Again, 100% train operators. Movie theaters never problem telling people bring drinks, train company tell people beverage can't see getting mad people drinking them. shitty person.

(Proud take bot hit one.) thousands traveling nurses fly situations like this. work medical facilities nearby get staff augmentation. work nursing homes state surrounding states staff want overtime pay. apartment complex small roughly 25 building, 6 apartments each. 3 Floors, 2 apartments each.

You could easily get 2k people larger complexes, taller buildings smaller apartments. wildly scream fake, spreading ignorance Wisconsin Alabama north. still go shops week (walk dogs daily etc) I'm place active community cases months. 

I'm risking it; potential long term side effects worrying, suffocating death. there's evidence mutating. want it.

Ps: even though active case imports freightand travelers coming home active hotels quarantine clusters. that's spread Victoria lock down. question that's plan though? Like try nail time time abhorrent act quote pan out, people grow tired even trying. point see something like greeting maskless supporters discharged hospital, held days COVID-19, people bat eye surprised anyway, ignore it. What???? That‚Äôs personal opinion dipshit  

My source myself???? I'm talking PA whole. areas spiking. Notably rural counties. Eventually naysayers either thier minds changed, die. matter time. Like monkeys typewriters scenario. fake article. nurse melissa resch works cna colony oaks care center. Unfortunately, people physically feel sick spreading this. part problem \*is\* still low wages poor work environment.

COVID spread group home husband works someone feel sick time, forced take multiple jobs multiple group homes. Even though employees ""responsible"" -- going partying anything -- basically group homes connected via employees working multiple places. still country two still think it‚Äôs important wash hands every 5 minutes wear mask. course worked 1918, Spanish flu managed infect one third world's population, killed measly 20‚Äî50 million, overrepresentation people 20s. could much worse without. Amazon barely operate Ireland lol

Yup, right now. think going big breakthrough. Looks like touching face. believe *motive* - sad reality many health officials started telling public masks effective. 

It crazy.

Actually, one incident - head US National Institute Immunity Allergy (?) admitted podcast Week Virology, withheld advising people protectiveness masks protect supplies health care workers.

...of course done that, people would started using face covering, end f'd public lies. Wishful thinking, vaccine. *It was, indeed, warm up.* SICK employees shouldn‚Äôt forced work. You‚Äôre special one aren‚Äôt you

Source? appear article. Please source claims, special one. Wait trying ask haha? asking we're test case Illuminati? Well go around telling us would they? that's absolutely ridiculous. 

The state Premier, Dan Andrews moving restrictions along match amount average daily cases, amount cases unknown origin (community transmission). one point curfew 8pm, 5km radius, 1 hour outdoor time, on, point lot restrictions lifted. curfew limit time spend outside (to exercise, shop, go work get health services), radius 25km, hairdressers businesses starting open, etc. can't go city boundaries, can't go restaurants pubs (no shit), probably gonna change 2nd November (and depending cases maybe even 26th October - average 5 total unknown cases 5). Can't hang groups home visits still, that's entirely reasonable - spent months hard lockdown nothing, we're going aggressive suppression.

The overall goal living life normally 2019, virus existing background, like rest Australia.

Edit: Also course fucking constitution, American constitution, culture's America either, matter Liberals wish for.  agree expresses himself. scientist PR person politician. probably never course deal media. Especially foreign media. Swedish media much focused Clickbait headlines comes serious things like pandemic, war murder. (regarding celebrities lovelifes horrible) means that! don‚Äôt expect others to. Japan. Mask compliance hovering around 80-90%, still really widespread testing (to keep numbers oh-so-precious Olympics next year), seem somewhat right it. mainly majority people actually give shit society well-being others. Shoot, thinking total cases (ones recovered, ongoing deaths), bad. people smart reason still mess :(  Mine get washed boiling water every use. get people reuse due Uncle Jake's sacrifice allowed walk store without mask. God bless soul. /s mean thats kinda overstating role temperature checking controlling pandemic. us taking seriously way anyone else implementing measures accordingly, measuring temperatures.

but bringing though? people seriously refusing/not believing temperature checks US? really. Turnout great equalizer comes ratfuckery. Turnout extraordinary right still couple weeks election. entire country locked one predetermined period time suppress transmission literally ***everyone*** followed guidelines time, may chance...

If keep letting things happen/ decided regionally, we'll playing whack-a-covid foreseeable future one region might get things calm down, another region sees explosive outbreak, region closes late, people seed virus back original region, rinse repeat. Yes sad get long flu long virus complications virus catch. People talking ""long covid"" make seem sort phenomenon.  Elimination = local spread virus. sure mean deaths. average age Africa around 20. could endemic might even know. They‚Äôve clearly educated themselves. It‚Äôs like Fox News Sinclair still claimed cigarettes causing cancer whole swath country believed it. would see protesting cigarette ban airplanes restaurants way masks. It‚Äôs ignorance irresponsible media intake. NE ""rural"" Wisconsin walk ""Bars"" would think Pandemic. People bar-stool bar-stool carrying always, bartenders wearing masks even. people little independent know, got little""don't tell do"" them, soooo, try tell do, they'll likely opposite(ever know work people like that? HAVE). needed LEADERSHIP, maybe local elected Officials little average IQ level would think. Well, Kewaunee Co Sheriff County Nurse made aware this. County Nurse concerned asked I'd called Sheriffs Dept, Ummmm, NO, enforce anything! Sooooo, morons need leadership, people do? Sheriff KEWAUNEE CO writes weekly column Free Paper. written articles every week, about? USE Hi-BEAMS WATCH DEER ROADWAYS! Mayor Algoma Wi do....put Political sign frontyard(NOT Biden) went grand-nieces BD Party least 5 Family members caught virus(his current wife cancer treatments lately)......its BLIND(dumb?), leading dumber around here......you can't fix IGNORANCE!!!! Lol
That sums article quite well. right. Kids great virus, like kids live anyone else could possibly spread virus to. teachers support staff may put risk. Send 'em back! Minnesota nice thought young people supposed progressive science shit. wearing masks? Big tough non mask wearer. bad ass, flexing reddit. Dont ass wear mask rookie numbers son. excluding deaths, yes said right. spoiler...they won't

At least certain political party's supporters won't. least they'll huge assholes too. sounds like recipe mutiny and/or piracy. people died Trump would look bad election, come back life November 4.
  
The comment sarcasm, last night kids basketball game, 400 miles nursing home, nearby family forced wear masks, loudly ranted Covid19 hoax would go away election.  
  
I inlaws Philippine village evidently locked bamboo huts make Trump look bad. Yea made mad hear. dad 66 years old. Wow talk cognitive dissonance. ‚ÄúWho would sign kind temp work?‚Äù simultaneously claiming ‚Äúwhat options there, residents need care.‚Äù buckaroo? think Sweden criticized harshly lockdown measures enough fact basically euthanized elderly people. Maybe. it‚Äôs uncommon see similar outbreaks nursing homes illnesses like norovirus c.Diff know airborne. Additionally, even leak, know virus naturally occurring - man-made. naturally occurring, come species, means species infected spread it. claim animals cannot infected spread virus make sense.

Unfortunately know that, also, idea talking about

It's rare happens

Though course serial passaging achieves much easily consistently. Everytime read headlines like feels like read,""Mother feeds hungry children""

Why news?

Sadly, though wrote sarcasm, many, especially supporters right wing media express repeat sentiment every day. excess number includes known covid deaths. amount probably indirect caused strained health care, although deaths flu traffic believe clear number exactly covid. Living Wisconsin like deep south. literally overhead old lady saying covid disappear election.... So...your argument take virus seriously enough and, result, got infected...and want people follow example? Ok, Captain Big Brains. clearly don‚Äôt understand situation ground Ann Arbor. school issuing mandates. county issued school‚Äôs wishes. point school committing taking role enforcement. making moves allow students attend class remotely. Ahh. Fear mongering finest Covid flu - subtract flu deaths total determining number.

Also, keep mind ""flu"" deaths, least USA, ""flu PLUS pneumonia"", seen pretty clearly [their death hospital really prepared thank God.

Customers would constantly smirk us mock us, co-workers always told us take off, even found sick employees literally linked paper response comment tested bunch animals animal successfully infected chickens. Stop. Plague still around, hardly great outbreaks anymore. Italian here:

People plain give fuck.

1/3 uses mask correctly

1/3 uses mask nose

1/3 uses mask chin/arm/doesn't even mask

It's 1/3 reasonable people 2/3 dumbfucks, around italy.

We country fucking morons. believe patient confidentiality. hospitals ventilator patients one room together. Even someone consents filmed, doubt doctors would allow patients could recorded even accidentally. 

Otherwise we'd seeing videos countries open less politically divisive covid, like Canada, Italy, New Zealand. everywhere, patient confidentiality taken seriously. 

We get one leaked video Italian hospital way back April, believe. forced work there.  get new employees work there.

You're special kind stupid.  Nothing fear here, president said so! f wrong people can't use legs special ramps. 

Sorry, wish body retained water like normal people. I'd probably alright liter flight two hours. Anything longer, stay employed, I'd struggling. follow rules place always put mask right back on. People take advantage happens policy. look emotional support animal nonsense. clearly seen massive amounts research showing cats (all species cats) minks infected transmit virus, dogs infected less likely transmit?

As claim bats cannot work reservoir, fact checked claim here's research might want look into. seems bats likely viable reservoir ferrets, another animal mentioned, also become infected virus replicates fairly easily them.

Additionally, even leak, know virus naturally occurring - man-made. naturally occurring, come species, means species infected spread it. claim animals cannot infected spread virus make sense. fair, hospital capacity threatened, lockdowns seem way quickly get cases back down.

That's time make sense imo. Wage slaves thanking benevolent corporate autocrats generous. I‚Äôm losing hope fellow Wisconsinites.

I don‚Äôt get it, fucking mask stay home often can. hard it?

Instead, get incles trying hatch plot kidnap Michigan‚Äôs governor. you‚Äôve got CNAs running fight clubs pinching old people. nightmare. someone said another thread, encourage virus infect anyone trumps fault.

What virus dealt early on. Letting drag out, allowing numerous get sickened, also counterproductive economic growth. Obviously though, hindsight 20/20 live now. It‚Äôs choice two those. using starting point, reality like don‚Äôt protect grandma, economy tanks anyways, takes longer recover, even kids die long run, grandma died too.

The interesting question happens vaccines like flu vaccine, protect people all, reduce severity illness others, leave millions year vulnerable, many thousands die. quickly human society say ""eff it,"" go normal lives? Maybe year? 7x larger compared wearing surgical mask, 23x larger compared wearing N95 mask. Younger people generally less severe case disease. understand CDC study back late July found 1 5 young adults back normal 14-21 days testing positive, sample consisted sought care. There's many infections young adults never sought care asymptomatic. 

Right young people represent large share COVID cases. anyone severe case results debilitating injuries, elderly suffer worst it. 

For young people infections, less injury death. old people less infections death. 

While young people still take precautions wear masks, biggest reason infect old people. friend group memeing hard anyone year, really looking forward big party, we've accepted going happen.

True. assume it‚Äôs sampled somewhere population, it‚Äôll virus given whole study group it‚Äôll missing natural variation. Given SARS-CoV-2‚Äôs relatively low mutation rate, may matter much factors, also highlight need geographic diversity Phase 3 trials! What? I've gone multiple times. BC ferries outsiders part highway system, transport people Vancouver Island, several smaller islands mainland. one going accept ""new normal"" another full year besides basement dwellers sub.

So true lol. Basically everyone know ready go back normal realize precautions form control masses, people older preexisting conditions always high risk susceptible disease. see extreme anti-covid precautions lasting much longer another year well. Furthermore, even vaccine covid still exist like flu people likely catch winter months immune systems weakened, like flu. what's really sad we're 8 months pandemic states testing 5 per 1000 residents. states highest positivity like Iowa &amp; Nevada less 1.0, whole slew others 2 per 1000. virus disappear test, despite Donald says.  Whats survival rate qualify go ventilator?

Probably slightly worse, last ditch effort. get paid based difficult replace. many interested travel nurses bet. ‚ÄúIf work hard succeed.‚Äù plea take virus seriously though - instill panic. California allow anyone get it. King Newsom said actually read first two three posts thread. dont label me. Possibly research viral surveillance purposes. would small segment population anyone thinks small amount *confirmed* reinfections proof rare probably quite wrong assumption. MIS-A/MIS-C happens virus cleared, probably not. needs virus present ADE. patients active infection crash get much worse. According news report saw, happened July cause death released days ago. news report didn‚Äôt mention whether passengers crew contact-traced contacted. suppose anyone may infected would already gotten past danger time. Still, rotten situation, around. ‚ÄúThese results provide information degree COVID-19 deaths might underascertained inform efforts prevent mortality directly indirectly associated COVID-19 pandemic, efforts minimize disruptions health care.‚Äù bourgeoisie get feel like heroes watching Netflix nice homes?

I love ""shut nonessential businesses!"" people never seem want shut entertainment options. Surprisingly, Netflix run handful developers working home. could certainly bring covid cases eliminating entertainment, no? Nothing, want it, there's nothing yall it. Sure, virus care. virus thing.  

But one advantage people virus people see numbers assess relative risk.

The people ""are this"" assessing relative risk deciding reward moving forward lives outweighs risk virus. privately owned BP. people I've seen KTs wear masks, thankfully. like everybody video either 90 900 lbs. exactly scary most.  neighbors actively ‚Äújoke‚Äù wish catch COVID get with. seems attitude many people pleas healthcare/scientists falling deaf ears. Eh, horribly bad reputation mostly due Protestant propaganda reformation.

Well, systematic burning libraries, non-Catholic monasteries, sacred sites centuries, excommunication and/or persecution long list notable scientists, philosophers, various free-thinkers Europe even centuries. mention modern-day stance things like evolution fetal development literally countless billions dollars pour anti-science political movements every nation world. 

But hey, least admitted wrong excommunicate Galileo saying Earth centre universe - 1992. smoothbrain take Yea Sweden &lt;5 deaths day last 3 months lockdowns, masks, less total deaths per capita US. Meanwhile clue many Chinese people really died Chinese people still dying.

 China centrally planned economy - order go back work, go fuck back work. that's wanna go thru life, thats good you, please stay far away me. Meanwhile US cant even get public school teachers show without teachers' union flexing muscle.

Hopefully, America balkanizes, choose live centrally-planned state live free state. doctors might experts fields study none experts virology epidemiology. Therefore, real base stand global viral pandemic. 

I'm view would similar listening hiring electrical engineer build bridge. Even though electrical engineer went similar schooling one would hire one build bridge. They'd listen hire civil engineer building bridges entire professional career. Sorry there's nothing extreme it, attacking strawman. replying want ""you way knowing products defective"".

I'm proposing that. I'm proposing watchdogs tell products avoid. Hell, watchdog could even government, although think they'd less effective it. change i'm proposing government stop using *violence* products like (by throwing people make cage). could publish list products like, walmart could brag carry govt approved products. difference someone *wanted* buy something unapproved, still could (edit: legally). That's called ""freedom"" concept Americans claim familiar, confronted it, tend react disgust. one day decrease, can't draw conclusions that. Based polling numbers, pretty stupid plan, yet doubling it, calling Fauci ""disaster"" cases hospitalizations every day. Tons states taking much nuanced approaches recommending.

I love armchair r/coronavirus experts I‚Äôve heard arguments used across Mid-West, well parts U.S..
In New York, terrible surge cases back spring really helped shape seriously virus taken. Complete ambush. One week I‚Äôm going school, next week everything gets shutdown everyone around panicking. nine hundred deaths per day together constant ambulance sirens ringing day night, felt like nightmare. It‚Äôs situation one wants relive. 

Pandemic Fatigue growing concern days, it‚Äôs depends effectively government enforcing law.

I hope Wisconsin doesn‚Äôt go hell. course, taxes suppose funneled business interests. visited r conspiracy *still* convinced whole thing hoax masks dont work. Come Kansas/Oklahoma/Missouri/Nebraska. pay attention, probably get flipped least once, probably several times day wearing mask. might want research 'tampon' English, lmao I'm 34 experienced zero tolerance shit high school. beyond joke. hope changed better now. Yeah much better dead. rent, bills nothing. usual dying, could easily less people dying people would follow simple guidelines.

How many deaths need prevented wearing mask social distancing worth inconvenience you? happened everywhere things first bad. Travelers flocking ever outbreaks getting paid big bucks.

Knew people quit hospital positions take ‚Äútravel‚Äù gigs city making 3 times much money. vaccine comes anti-vaxxers dont take say then? Lockdown exhaustion? problem lockdown large parts UK summer hence high figures, infact government actively encouraged people go restaurants August subsidising meals. 

What's craic personal attack me? I'm 32 detached home fwiw. ""it is"" specific antibodies, IgG neutralizing antibodies spike protein / Huang‚Äôs team found ADE phenomenon tended occur level antibodies blood relatively low. patients large amount antibodies, job neutralising virus.

This affect vaccines people recovered severe COVID.

This explains course disease severe cases patients get much worse bodies initially start produce antibodies.

This make Coronavirus like Dengue.

Pretty sure reported vitro back like April I've known months. Support positions risk associated them. father served Navy ship peacetime lost 2 people: one routine training exercise one simply disappeared never found; assumed fell overboard.
You sacrifice time talents people go school accumulate experience advance careers.
And many army failed course history support systems place provide food equipment needed. Without people like military work.  Yes, lot sure! Without access even oxygen- would much higher fatality rate. Almost seems like bailing people like brother makes sense bailing airlines again. would sOcIAliSm though. Tell guy Russia think hero. need unlikely even opportunity get it.

However, phase 1/2 results peer reviewed. phase 3 peer reviewed results way, vaccine.

In addition Sinopharm using proven inactivated virus tech. order milkshakes, wait mean order milkshake discuss gets live! New Hampshire pretty well compared places lump us potato heads. Well wanna go anectodal experiences, see mask usage rather high even made mandatory open spaces Yeah nations president; supposed leader country; saying people tired covid. I‚Äôm sure people dying hospitalized tired it. Whatever means. Catholic Church always supported science, still does. They've contributed money resources field astronomy organization that's ever existed, contributions field medicine definitely nothing sneeze considering Church far largest non-government provider health care world.

Catholic Church and/or members instrumental introducing university system, genetics, Big Bang Theory, scientific method itself. Many prominent Catholic thinkers pointed understanding world God given us important way growing closer Still true or? 

The highest number COVID-19 deaths reported among aged 80-90 (2,456 fatalities), followed aged 90 (1,541) aged 70-79 (1,272), October 19, according Sweden's public health agency.

That makes total 5,269 deaths among aged 70 older, 89 percent Sweden's current total COVID-19 death count.

And sentence article sound negative: Sweden, nationwide coronavirus lockdown never implemented, wants ease safety restrictions aged 70 older allow ""live bit normal life.""

But nvm post history shows emotional topic. understand thats okay. Everybody weak spot get emotional.

Stay safe friend idea gets abused power structures want force treatment. 

You tell healthy person looking them. top end, people healthy diets, regular exercise, good stress management glow. oh thats target shares went today . good news It‚Äôs minimal dose virus lab, even virus active world. 

This prove disaster volunteers get long term health effects. don‚Äôt trust I‚Äôm going post arguments every time news posted. trash article full lies make stuff up. even projections done FHM predicted rising cases hospitalisations   somebody done interviews web software devs, confirm service something would directly help get job. basically scan resume see worth giving phone screening. get phone screening, rest interview process entirely skills. even care went college. Hell, care finished high school. code, code. whole Galileo ordeal example Catholic church sticking ""settled science"" bit zealously. Biden Animal Crossing town. :) rest upper midwest spiking trends going wrong direction wrong time, handful people dying every day Wisconsin going grab much attention. headline regarding people taking critical care beds may impactful. would ever listen science? Septa tried enforcing/requiring masks back like April within like couple days someone filmed maskless person getting thrown bus posted social media went viral bad light, quickly changed policy they're enforced.

IIRC, person getting thrown bus black, there's definitely racial bias viral post. extension neither proven wrong? guy links article CDC June, time surgical n95 masks difficult come healthcare professionals, saying yes virus transmit aerosol medium mostly spread droplets? There's reason flurry petitions concocted renowned epidemiologists scientists. true. brother jumping around travel nurse making bank last 6 months. He‚Äôs contract taking home $4,800 WEEK. Half living stipend taxed either.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs 4 days week it‚Äôs 3 one week 4 next. Well, they've probably working years, hope so. vaccine comes publicly available I‚Äôm done wearing mask That....doesn't seem like reliable definitive source.

It's official Iranian state news agency even web design 90s woudl think Johnsoon getting COVID would elevated thinking more? Free school lunch? means parents care. 

              Paul Ryan rules essential critical care units already full

This key. Remember flatten curve push? let people freedom hospitals going fill need clamp again. 8pm, almost entire month, clapped towards them! /s California takes almost 40% taxes that‚Äôs fucked  taking much bail us out, relief bill gave big tech, small businesses barely got Wisconsin person here, shared message main Bellin Health Appleton Facebook, proceeded uncle also lives Wisconsin, tell quote, ‚Äú Stop listening tyrannical governor, liberal funded hospitals.‚Äù responded said, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling stop listening science?‚Äù course gave overused line flu worse.  **but count fucking 1.5 BILLION? days later. first day infection, swab register negative even infected (false negative rate 100%). virus replicate body next days, accuracy gradually improves, false negative rate drops 20% around 8 days exposure, mores start rise again.

Wow.  That‚Äôs actually good point. shouldn‚Äôt care Islamic extremism either considering rare event is. disagree...

Covid still thousands young healthy adults needing ICU treatment intubation. 

If happened 1918, young healthy adults would need intubation today option likely succumb disease.

I think would disproportionately effect younger healthier adults like Spanish flu did, think death toll Covid, happened back 1918 would comparable Spanish Flu. Here's terrifies me... small chance they're correct flip senate seat cycle!

This country deserves full reboot. Dont know covid-19 flu different? think elderly significant co-morbidities vaccinated, need reckoning relative risks everyone else. lot discussion 'long Covid' focuses non-specific claims vague symptoms. Ireland's health service atrocious clue handle spending. new children's hospital Dublin cost ‚Ç¨2.2 billion. Burj Khalifa comparison cost ‚Ç¨1.2 billion. Honestly Irish government health service claim even semblance competence beyond me. Oh, wanted kids brush teeth before, even sink purpose, bringing back, giving mouthwash, waiting swish spit new thing. SIL nurse local hospital, works respiratory ward. suffering PTSD, many deaths, part broke people alone. Normally family dying nurses room. nurses ones holding phones pads families could say good bye. One family , father Albany NYC dad lived son didn't. dad released told son got home. dont get letter saying infected thousands may followed. may even show symptoms never knew passed 20 people. unpleasant news, unfortunately significant. 3 billion higher would estimated, there's doubt millins left out. $1200. Seriously government offered money person got vaccine, likely would result large number people getting even read first comment thread nah. Gov Newsom California held briefing yesterday announced strategy group manage rollout. Based 1st hand knowledge high confidence initial doses arrive Dec Jan, limited high risk hospital/nursing staff caring covid patients. rollout general public happen spring possibly summer next year, next fall worst case scenario.  deaths matter though, question say numbers false inaccurate lies.

It could 1 million would hear story. agree everything said Yikes don‚Äôt understand topic all. Thoughts prayers üôè That's still wrong. Wind -40 degrees cool soup -80 moving air. cools -40 faster.

The faster cooling used approximate cold feels human perception. 

When wearing wind break, wind still -40 insulting layers beneath keep difference temperature insulated one another.

So no. Moving air magically make colder. Go stick thermometer outside, wind one sheltered. temperature. 

All say, synthetics cold feeling. also crack break down. ever cracked coat gloves? have. never occurred natural leather fur me. wonder christmas ads much different year, COVID thing? Republicans like ones politicizing pandemic.


He casually states blaming one political party 100% Seems detailed others OK  1918 pandemic woman said [ nose goes Ya pointed flu.

I don‚Äôt think flu absolute maximum risk Americans comfortable with. 

As learned year, though, limit. think limit around 100,000. Could less. No, said thing. said CA independent body review effectiveness safety. Yeah, MKE Madison took seriously. moved Waukesha county, even 5 minutes Milwaukee county border, night day. Everyone Milwaukee masked super cautious. Waukesha, however, could give flying fuck masked (barely) go store restaurant enforcing masks. guess agoraphobia new friend old people give shit give pneumonia-prone wife reason end nightmare. sucks balls. never eliminated; animal reservoirs cannot kill every bat planet.

It actually not, different virus whatever bat progenitor had, lab leak direct zoonotic transfer hypotheses least maybe trick treaters year?  10 years younger experience haven‚Äôt, anything they‚Äôve gotten worse years since there. Americans good english journalism pay anymore Founders practice preached? No. George Washington wealthiest guy country. writers Constitution kept slaves. 

That said, we‚Äôve slowly painfully wrought nation something closer ideals. ideal *All Men (and Women!) Created Equal* still matters. Striving goal still counts something. coming weeks millions American men women going vote. 1776, us wouldn‚Äôt allowed that. 

So we‚Äôve changed better. we‚Äôve got long way go, starting pulling industrialists government. stands, NASDAQ States America. promote democracy using illegal smartphone application countries like Cuba &amp; Ukraine, turn around disenfranchise goddamn citizens right -[ *rant redacted due blood pressure alarm*] like Communism supporters say. See Monkey1Fball's comment forget border closures! no. read RESPIRATORY VIRUSES spread Go movies? Fuck lol. Pay risk death disease. still sell food? people even masked watching movie? Cool. need go bar movie theater good quality life one wants pay attention it‚Äôs actually way. wrong, masks making safe, people touch masks middle maintain proper hand hygiene, sweat contain viable virus.

If right, mostly aerosols, safe, masks reduce aerosols (while nearly preventing larger droplets). Same. never worse choice candidates year whiskey? able force people work, pay work, provide protections enjoyed workers.

If want prison labor, get behind that. needs optional, needs pay actually money get out, need workers rights do. Yes. Let's start undergoing massive testing employees huge changes administrative work home we're swamped patients. This'll great use time Customers mind stepping dead bodies eh? Florida tried crap hundreds teachers quit. states actually care teachers beneficiary great teachers year live grandma? homeless shelter situation? Either way, good careful around vulnerable people you‚Äôre cooped 24/7.

You try go outside sometimes though. Don‚Äôt need wear mask outside, clearly need fresh air. picture lab coat, holding science bong saying this. Baseball cards used fun kids, investment valuable play with? hope don‚Äôt run medical workers dying also Covid disrupted schooling. need treat right let live wearing masks social distance!! anything? social distancing means ""shut down"" lot businesses viable social distancing.

You really can't cake eat too. Either go ""herd immunity"" (kill million people) fight virus aggressively, meaning indoor dining, high capacity events, indoor entertainment, gyms, partying - lot normal life *simply incompatible* pandemic response. Even things banned, margins tight lot places LOSE MONEY open social distancing, closed. Hmm. almost seems like ""highest level lockdown"" working hospital admissions low. Crazy. shit. flu would kill too. provides us condemnation non-scientific approach confirms NZ's approach correct.

Why NZ's approach? South Korea Taiwan? Japan? Rwanda? Macau? Singapore? HK? countries taking successful scientific measures STILL community spread COVID. may mass outbreaks COVID gone. going claim also followed science they're good NZ? First all, I'm ""latching"" onto anything. cite sources conflict interest bias, tend 2020. nothing left right wing, leave politics it. people, indeed psychological issues make wearing mask extremely difficult. People PTSD, anxiety, claustrophobia, mental illnesses find wearing mask difficult. going say people bad something can't control? There's also people physical illnesses like eczema suffer physically wearing mask, yes many valid reasons wearing nothing right wing ""brainwashing"". people brainwashed ones treat science like religion grasp idea science opinion mask wearing simple people like want everyone believe. Eh, horribly bad reputation mostly due Protestant propaganda reformation.

They actually instrumental maintaining advancing knowledge Middle Ages west - vast majority Latin works come directly church.

The worst aspects church really start pop late Middle Ages early Renaissance. even mostly reformed within century century half mostly accepted science. founded religious orders formidable scholars present day, Jesuits.

And say non-religious person - Catholic, Christian. interest history generally feel church gets sorta bad image, especially countries (or were) predominately Protestant (including countries redditors - Anglosphere) Oh threw dumb hypothetical vaccine effective enough head vaccine efforts expecting 80%-90% efficacy Fauci expecting 70% efficacy. That's enough thus argument wrong Yes do. One first mandate high usage. hate Governor point they‚Äôre collecting signatures recall. üôÑ system ""capitalist"" system. modeled right capitalist state, substituted high concentration wealth high concentration power. think difference. trade authority wealth day long ""marketplace"". human organization past centuries marketplace. work x Volga industries buy litters vodka.

What private ownership ""capitalism"", deputized authority land/building, please, within guidelines set authority deputized you. Whether commissar granted authority supervise operations factory, farm, owner (based contract state rights obligations are) makes little difference.

The education system guided submissive soldier central authority, side famous wall. systems far true democracy (true equality - economic political) previous centralized authority system replaced. fact worse, centuries ago freedom depart city walls live own, today freedom. Even oceans free international passage revoked states claimed right hundreds miles offshore lease oil industry. Individual freedom myth keeps societies powerless, unorganized disorganized, within cannibalistic system markets.

But humans dumb malleable, nature easy submit domination. ecosystem collapsing accelerating pace know it, late raise heads say no. best well kept secret decades, even among academics deny involvement sectors research. realize happening invisible, field specialty, industrial state sponsors access media, able make sufficient noise heard. attempt make noise squashed like bugs windshield. forget ohio

No, I'd rather remember Ohio. Rural Kentucky? last 5 times tested symptoms. places require symptoms missing huge demographic asymptomatic carriers Yes, ""best scenarios"". Staying outside, even bit crowded, poses threat. course not, would think would agree fighting social Justice worthy cause outside compared music festival. Plus protesters wearing masks sounded like nobody music festival wearing mask but, don't......?  work office occasionally go storefront grab something. Sine we've opened back up, I'm constantly watching co-workers repeatedly tell people put masks put back put nose. feel like co-workers baby sitters anything recently. ridiculous. Well unless governors shove em nursing home pull family members first extreme Reddit, friend. see mention wearing mask,

Almost like something people going on. Like countries Japan already *did* care decades.

Oh no, we're going adopting responsible hygiene practices result covid. bunch hypocrites. /s know would help? Saying mean. stop shutting down. Im using NY test case-

What policies would needed fix there? 

Alternatively, nationwide policies would fix situation?

You telling ""we shouldve dine countries done"" im asking specific policies referring would made virus longer issue like countries. 

Tl;dr countries, specific policies. best cancer outcomes world. even know you‚Äôre saying type it? understand metrics study using make claims? nothing care given. I‚Äôll say money paid issues related outcomes. Simply put best outcomes illness world. Oh sure thank profit system vaccine comes next month. yet best lot holiday travel northern hemisphere, add pandemic fatigue think could still substantial influenza season here. Time tell. Practice preace. lockdown's working people this

The virus care people ""over it."" insane need talk giving virus right messaging brand appeals enough people stop going dying. Well said!!  Gaslighting kinda requires talking specifically person, wasn't. Look up. get it. selfish people hard. die follow restrictions, yet, ignore them, someone else might. That's murder. premeditated that. Gross negligence. better government behaved. Pick whichever side want, reality it. YOU. worry, they'll ship patients liberal cities complain incessantly normal times, overwhelming hospitals even we're decent job responsible. life KC STL. sweden white white countries good. whiter gooder. Therefore strategy good taken seriously. magnificent. Wow November already worn first mask. god love living world existence virus political opinion Na ;) Italy mask mandate high compliance 6 months.

Just like Spain. 

Made difference. 

Universal masking largely ineffective. live Appleton (drunkest town America also cases). group friends ask go bar. world. people stop dying take said though. reasons gave you. someone said another thread, long time ago, ""I'm starting think virus can't reasoned with"" quite, people bitching two hundred bucks ain‚Äôt gonna change life don‚Äôt quite get either. It‚Äôs two hundred bucks didn‚Äôt now, do. I‚Äôm essential worker got, lemme check, zero bucks bonus risking life work make sure everybody else work home safety. ain‚Äôt much, 200 bucks something good paying out. Everything said may October either lying way optimistic. earliest time vaccine could proven effective late November. wouldnt expect vaccines general public spring perfectly line initial 12-18 month estimation last January. Night shifts worth $1/hr extra unless skin condition makes stay sun times. completely backwards schedule $8 day extra? Huh, well girlfriend ER ICU nurse LA deals COVID patients nightly. held iPads loved ones say goodbye dying family members can't visitors dying alone, seen firsthand kind psychological damage causes. 

Are clients telemetry nurses ?? polls please found people saying hoax, though. best, I've people think overblown media government, strict lockdowns shutting businesses best strategies dealing crisis.

I think either stances unreasonable, worth hearing opinions, no? Yes do, lol

Just like people dying nursing homes news

""this people could die small breeze dying droves like every year""

Okkkkkkk?

What imagine hospitals like? they're profit goal capacity times. Anything else would wasting funds staffing

And considering difficulty diagnosing respiratory problems fuckihg idea going on. always hear drastic reports. wish could see more. Especially texas hospitals prepped didnt really overwhelme I'm going take claim overwhelmed somehow time make cute video regarding it, overwhelmed. ‚ÄúI take responsibility.‚Äù Here's thing. Corona stay, YEAAAAAAAAARS. Time cope fact move lives. 95%? planet? New blinds important spending HOlidays Family? find funny everyone thinks activities need/want acceptible others aren't. ask spending Holidays family 10 pegs new blinds. live people get tested symptoms? even live Southern Hemisphere? get opinion? Bullshit. Show pictures videos. Exactly. I‚Äôve customers come telling think coronavirus isn‚Äôt real it‚Äôs harmless common flu don‚Äôt get everyone wear face masks wearing face mask means we‚Äôre controlled government stripped freedom. 
And there‚Äôs classic ‚Äúyou know wearing face mask won‚Äôt protect you, right?‚Äù 

Like, YEAH, KNOW THAT. Wearing face mask meant PREVENT spreading it. happens tell please put face mask. boggles mind there‚Äôs many people taking seriously. live WI people straight assholes covid. look news article based WI see crazies think know better anyone. think many people going opt vaccine 20% effective. 

Also R0 pretty tough measure accurately, different methodologies leading vastly different numbers.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* thing is, weak evidence FHM's recommendations regarding social distancing effective (the number daily cases evidence not)... yet it.

Why recommend both? Hey now, democratic governor might flip senate seat cycle! Kansas got major dose Trumpism 2016 form recent governor began rejecting it. Well, least area around Kansas City... Wichita entire rest state different beasts. KC area pretty blue. doom gloom, ""can please decent human being?"" True, Sweden elderly people. mean largely agree. example. Conservatives like claim they're changing minds see news, they're influenced media anyone. get fined I‚Äôm excited PHOSP-COVID study, it‚Äôs look severe enough COVID admitted hospital. really need large study random sample individuals diagnosed COVID, preferably selected time diagnosis, tracks percentage people diagnosed COVID develop longterm symptoms. virus doesn‚Äôt care reason about. Nope, didn‚Äôt even say was. No. attacked people causing issues sure it‚Äôs not. bringing home, bringing school, grocery store. completely real people stop dying pandemic society, fed already, care. Absolutely ridiculous held due red tape incorrect format results. Whether that's fault AZ FDA, either way someone pulled finger much sooner. people dying forerunner vaccines showing promise, can‚Äôt people vaccinated stage 3 trials go on? know someone died covid personally, likely know least one end 2021. want set reminder let know year? true. Hospitals controlled environment people tries take face mask twiddle hair help them, nursing homes not. addition mentioned makes outbreak home tricky deal with. Best thing get service 20% trulieve. Oh guess pay treatments Monopoly money. Kind dumb statement you.the drs make money, nurses staff. hospital doesn‚Äôt turn profit plenty people work do. Also maybe look much pay board members. really sad, feel bad you. Yes? US media never talks covid free nations actually managed Sweden big herd immunity? cases sucked ass compared Norway finland? know exactly volunteers exposed. track symptoms (if any) immune response t=0. understanding current Phase 3 trials frequently testing test subjects know someone infected if/when exhibit symptoms, control subjects show antibodies later. DeSantis recalled. clearly give fuck Floridians' health well-being. stub picky toe might well get keep every 2 hours. Instead changing doing? That's kind crazy talk turns would disagree. sentiment there, that's good. Language matters. Well live populated area country Government deemed dangerous put highest level lockdown, yet hospital admissions lower last year. course vary depending region put point every hospital going overwhelmed, doom gloom stories nothing cause dear panic. again, that's everyone loves sub. upset about? get virus, time show positive test ? day get days later ? long last?

I've COVID fuck's sake. Thanks people like give shit spreading around. I'm blocking you, bother responding. There's clearly getting I'm done wasting time narcissists. Maybe exception New Zealand maybe Australia, whole lot mask wearing social distancing going Southern Hemisphere. really optimistic. alarming segment population US refuses wear fucking mask slightly inconveniences them, guarantee people assholes refuse get vaccines, too. can't force people get vaccinated, many stupid, selfish Americans refuse literally anything common good know ever go away. also know mean ""pandemic fatigue."" People sick tired covid restrictions going make pandemic end sooner. fact, people opposed idea restrictions many places acting like pandemic all, causing cases spike. zero hope country all. couple steps short wondering whether there's better way make sure citizens one richest nations world spread resources ways reduce stress anxiety basic human necessities. LARPer are. fun wasting life away. anyone want go fucking movies right now? Tegnell's face used stencil tattooing IMHO cultish mentality. know public health figure treated similarly. ‚ÄúEveryone loves him. Absolutely. That‚Äôs is. He‚Äôs popular,‚Äù said Tove own. good pitch woman. anything wrong that. 

What takes win contests different takes conduct breakthrough scientific research. mean? much higher

Sweden: 585 deaths per million
Norway:51 death per million
Denmark: 119 deaths per million realize poverty going create social destabilization coronavirus? People poor lock down. People going enough buy groceries Right, concerned different cause death every year right? wear mask social distance every flu season? go way tell people eat better obesity heart disease kills? running around telling mothers smoke around kids health risks due second hand smoke? staunch advocate seashells, posting car forums safety telling people wear could die? Nah, probably care things level care covid. worried last year? Oh right, nothing, news! I've already started putting message we're holidays person. safe.

Granted, mom in-laws deliberately unsafe. mom go work couple days week, caring elderly grandparents (and grandpa died last week, caused heightened exposure bit). in-laws ever go anywhere see anyone, technically safe... *us*. 

But safe them. husband essential worker There's active outbreak work right now. job bit unique spends majority time office setting. interact coworkers public person frequently, there's way around it. manages safely can, know exposure risk lot higher.

The last thing want unknowingly bring gift COVID holidays.

Instead, I'm trying think ways virtually ""gather"". Maybe dinner together Zoom. Maybe private Zoom sessions daughter grandparents cousins open gifts. Maybe planning special activities (like baking session, paint night, game night) inviting family/friends. 

I hopeful next holiday season things better enough gather safely. Taking one year ""off"" something insistent protect together next year. happened early June. One day case number tripled stayed months. creeping back again. literally, one day suddenly wham - triple cases. IMO suffering correlates economic restrictions. yes people suffering pandemic bc govt makes impossible start business unless rich lawyer. govt licensing careers keep new workers out. reason people China way poorer. pandemic extreme govt control. Thus extremes poverty. No. thought NY problem happening backyards. 

Now, well, backyards, neighbor's problem, theirs. That's good point actually. wonder going ahead? ‚Äúscared straight‚Äù program people think it‚Äôs hoax. take tour coronavirus ward see still doesn‚Äôt care. virus f‚Äôs everything can. glad scientists studying it.

Yup, guys right, vaccine right around corner!!!! That's interpreted hairylikeabear's comment. thought complaint science journalism communication--that study looking specific group people (those still reporting symptoms well infection) reported study general population likely confuse people rather inform them. brakes, derailed, fire...

&amp;#x200B;

Idk Lightfoot, NY State well NJ, certainly lighten up... Restaurants allowed reopen, schools, businesses long followed precautions lessen probability another explosive outbreak. 

Idk, maybe definition ""lighten up"" different mine... can‚Äôt serious. pandemic ends cases deaths start go down. virus eradicated there‚Äôs chance happening. think people going keep restrictions lifestyle vaccinated wasting year lives already, another thing coming. Estimated immunity would reached around 55% - 80%. reinfections happen. possible Vaccine.

You can‚Äôt answer questions argument. sure close borders people. friend living there. wants invite brother needs bring lots documentation proving really related. would chance going now.

Also worth noting Taiwan much less connected countries European countries do. two additional issues I've noticed.

1. people believe fatal think tell friends it. tell looking sick, someone sick last week ""safe"" category.

2. people regard life compelled thinking safety loved ones debilitating effects (lethargy, brain fog, strokes, etc.). 

So example mom would ""rather die"" treat friends like sick. believe fatal, bad risk assessment developing new habits. also want offend friends ""sure"" sick, think would know exposed. Idk I‚Äôm taking it. Would literally strap good luck that. Switzerland readily rising too. Extremely unlikely. would massive news. Feel free dig sources.

Polio perhaps? Still little bit left. Covid break 1918 factors today would much impact. ventilators back then, drugs control fever, means alleviating damage done ones lungs happens young people pandemic well old. 

&amp;#x200B;

So people would survive Covid pandemic, medical interventions terms ICU vents, would faired far worse 1918, that's I'd argue Covid would deadly Spanish Flu happened 1918 Human challenge trials starting 20th January UK prior getting stamp approval. could imagine program set end Feb go well care homes first blocks. Whoever made decision needs meet consequences. outright lying regarding health information harming nation far worse however think helping beginning.


People bought every mask available shelves regardless. whole thing surreal, telling people masks work desperately pleading masks. 

And I'm implying medical workers gotten them. contrary, government able step confiscate/forbid public sale n95s (while paying slightly market price) rerouted hospitals.

What's horse game? must change this.

Fawkesjitas. This. Say want mask mandate nice walk place worry (much) half people wearing masks. become non-issue lets get business. article CDC June, time surgical n95 masks difficult come healthcare professionals, saying yes virus transmit aerosol medium mostly spread droplets? There's reason flurry petitions concocted renowned epidemiologists scientists calling bullshit. Also asked people 65 don¬¥t test stay home 10 days. hospitals completely empty letting docs nurses go revenue. Oh, great you! surely celebrating Thanksgiving Christmas in-person. Good luck calling police :)

And family? rise overdose deaths due poverty shitty handling pandemic. Daycares, schools, neighbors kids. Depends area. truly essential workers working in-person, everyone else covered weeks, we'd done immensely better did. Instead, fast food open, even office considered essential architectural surveys commercial businesses (so we're construction adjacent). really essential giant fast food chains opening locations right now? not. get work home, everyone ""essential"" office job able allowed to. Plenty people forced work office despite ability work home, illegal company deny WFH.

That would reduce total number kids needed watched. would single parent home, others would both. families parents essential workers would able bubble single family, daycares schools could open extremely limited capacity leftover kids young, healthy staff precautions, could lot outside time even safer. would total vectors infection massively reduced. many obvious options would reduced impact pandemic start, country decided businesses ones needed money, everyone essential worker, individuals decide whether they're get COVID local bar friends claim they're hanging people. annoying coworker tried convince CV even bad flu, die pre-existing conditions, it‚Äôs basically joke. Like came whole page filled numbers stats shit took everything tell go fuck tell someone doesn‚Äôt common sense, like Trump supporting coworker. Sounds like make Target's hiring qualifications, worry it. actually didn't. agreed another poster lives Italy, anecdotal, that's observational valuable shitty example. point 'cases already rising' slippery slope say everyone already using masks. already going remove it, likely means people starting relax caring private settings really monitored even situations monitored, probably pretty loose. act there's literal police force watching every single person case. Enforcing masks culture people's attitude less actual body making happen. People give time relax feel obligated wear high death counts around them.

You data say enough. fact, studies show masks protect. much protection differ greatly across mask worn, type worn, clean, etc...but acting nothing really poor attitude. simply shrug shoulders say enough, that's harm good. mask reduced spread 20%, say would worth ask everyone public areas indoors wear them? mean, seriously? hit certain number people believe lives spared worth it? say anything reasonably lowers spread performed feasible. Wearing masks simple. People fucking tired get that, man already...it's pandemic. sounds like much fun.

OKay point virus still going spread. idea going stamp silly heck mean post labeled initially struggled pandemic started planning use Instacart. 
To pawn shopping someone else seems callous 1%er-like. 

Then actually thought it. 
Let‚Äôs say 1000 shopping purchases made given day given store. 
Our baseline purchase made 1 person. 
So, store see 1000 unique shoppers. 
Let‚Äôs add 100 Instacart employees. 
We say able make 4 purchases per day, contribute 400 1000 unique purchases made. 
This means able displace 300 unique shoppers. 
So, 600 regular shoppers + 100 Instacart employees total 700 people shopping store given day. 
This means 300 less potential carriers interacting others shopping. 

If think way, makes sense pandemic control perspective. 
This isn‚Äôt even considering using Instacart providing someone income.  one hand, think UBI would actually help GDP make economy healthier.

On hand, know people bitching ""its enough"" buy latest iPhone ignore anyone gives financial advice.

This whole ""you deserve given everything need live, even absolutely nothing valid excuse it"" idea boggles me. UBI like $300 month US. number helps people stay afloat, especially they're trying advance lives (school) fall hard times. (unemployment) UBI number lets everyone latest iPhone.

None coworkers, none neighbors, barely anybody community taking seriously. girlfriend wear masks apartment complex we're ones. hell wrong country? Walmart always nasty. sort argument can't nice things. nothing, black white, either or, us them. Getting virus control shorter term sacrifices shown long term benefits economy - check China see mean. think US prioritize personal freedoms China claim aggressive control measures (even lockdowns) going lead millions children starving political hyperbole. I'm fan lockdowns aggressive testing programs.

The US extraordinarily high obesity levels. Crazy high. precondition much severe Covid case. Sweden much much lower obesity universal health care access bascially healthier nation begin 

So distinct advantage get go. US media simply refuses discuss obesity epidemic ravaging national health. COVID skeptics come onto Daily discussion thread comment stuff like ""I hate lockdowns bro"" ""I wish bro"" instead visiting posts contain actual news.

I've kept kid remote handled it. staff quarantine kids still allowed school. Even one sibling got sick, others still allowed go school unless got sick. People supposed quarantined stayed home school work, still went games events. yeah abundance Covid Cathy Carl versions Typhoid Mary. Banned flying lives fucking island.

People die every day primary lesson learned Vietnam. state Texas yank certificates, destroy retirement savings, immediately hire bunch $10/hr subs point schools say ""See? told public education work!"" much reinfections really happening...we need brace another onslaught around world. masks vacuum work? Yes.

Do masks reality work? No. 

Why? 

Because people wear masks enter places take (restaurants, bars, cinemas, etc...).

Because people wear masks wrong way (aka chin diapers).

Because people touch masks (even health officials like Fauci guilty so!!!!).

Because people think forget social distancing long wear masks absurd (hey, let's go rallies, concerts protests, we'll fine standing next long wear masks). 

Sweden smart prioritizing Social Distancing instead giving people illusion ""you whatever want long wear mask"". gaslighting, lmao. I‚Äôm psychopath wanting continue life 9 months government jack shit combat issue. Cringeeeeeeee

Ugh one going accept ""new normal"" another full year besides basement dwellers sub.

!remindme 1 year basically I've seen lot people know. Ok? virus attacked people age group would more? still doesn‚Äôt early. Love hospitals prioritise money Countrys‚Äô health

#What actually happening:

Target + walmart + whoever else mass firing mothafuckas new old attendance (they previously said dont come even slightest bit sick) minor ""infractions"" amid pandemic, businesses quite literally big fail due shrunken job market, throw bullshit HR packages news attract LITERALLY ANYONE. need people push freight christmas. happens every year. sure live, made ‚Äúappointment‚Äù CVS within 15 minutes flu shot done cost me. Normally allowed film hospitals makes sense. 99% would died anyway bro Lmao never California Funny disappeared that. Almost switched accounts temporarily less embarrassing one keep spreading anti- science bullshit ü§£ Gottlieb Pfizers board, may agenda speaking truth. Nothing happen white house trump takes seriously along republicans. pretty obviously enough. order protect vunerable people enough give vaccine vaccine doesnt give complete immunity.

You give enough people virus cant spread. take next summer optimistic scenarios. everyone US aged 18-49 caught COVID we'd herd immunity (probably) tens hundreds thousand deaths. infections far likely missed group 50+ crowd. account 120%+ share infections definitely good thing. lockdown hurting people doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt also care people suffering Covid. doesn‚Äôt either situation. 

Probably annoying thing anti-lockdown people entire argument relies false dichotomy. talk shutting forever one talking about. opposed death free world lived pre 2020? Lol Much like climate change deniers, call 'we need evidence' hollow. already overwhelming evidence efficacy masks prevent and/or significantly reduce much evidence satisfy ignorant? Would want it? everyone definitely go store last minute items .

Its cool safe guarantee. Good luck Florida time leader cases per day deaths per day, think we‚Äôve calmed bit we‚Äôre getting ready explode it‚Äôll snowbird season starting pretty much (all old/Rich people migrate avoid winter)

So stay tuned, Florida‚Äôs probably gonna rise top 5 number soon (we zero restrictions right now, bars open, don‚Äôt wear mask, basically virus doesn‚Äôt exist) He's got don‚Äôt get people can‚Äôt drink home like normal alcoholics.

K. South Korea, HK, Japan beaten virus continue living restrictions quite time. HK South Korea tail end dealing ""third waves"" they've bee successfully dealt with, they're category places like Taiwan NZ. Places like South Korea HK Taiwan Japan Singapore similar mindset Sweden, restrictions made long-term. Furthermore, Asian countries treating virus like kind game ""beaten"", disturbing attitude I've noticed among Westerners. cannot BEAT virus within 7 months; NZ Australia keep borders closed God knows long, really think that's possible US? get numbers lockdown kept borders open, we'd spot EU now. kind venue hold 10k people wedding? That‚Äôs nuts. already proven wrong. Personally think best solution coughing lift collar face cough shirt (if dry cough). Yea, NY saw first hand crippling disease be. Nassau County would hear ambulances drive office, sometimes upwards 30 times day. constant. im even close hospital. bad whilst whole country taking serious. can't imagine going look like weeks, nothing shutting anywhere, cases rising exponentially. could looking 100k dead/month mark end year. I'm sure leaders want people panic either. Ouch! Past negative half-century mark! Looks like ""*downvote rocket moon lifted entered chat*""   

Hee hee hee! 2 hours still respond guy, shocking (/s) easy, again, original point peoples' anger people leaving house, per article responses here. Masks pretty simple thing everything do.  judgment activities I'm trying work through. anti coronavirus walk Vancouver. masks, idiots walking blocks shouting ""wake up"".

Worse donor perk ever. People die every day regardless corona, get probably look countries seperately want know them. UK found site, seems data: think anything wrote contradicts person replying to. completely agree assessment think solution guy/girl said: needed strong leadership. stupid fuck saying afraid covid spent hundreds thousands dollars treated.   Hospitals can‚Äôt stay open aren‚Äôt profitable

Someone tell non-profit hospitals. problem HIPPA laws disallow this. footage get leaked foreign hospitals. Alright one u/DeathRebirth I'm going waste time explaining you. Read care Last heard restrictions bars? Seated etc? function essence phrase always best translated as: ""stop criticizing wars.""

Not true! actually also used mean ""help us finance wars!"" Congress learned could rename wars ""Military Conflicts"" relinquish power go ~~war~~ military conflict President, finance debt. Boohoo Right-wing America completely fault this. you‚Äôre severely depressed can‚Äôt hug people issues need sort out. doctors saved trumps life violated ""do harm"" clause hippocratic oath. Anecdotally, friend senior college, says everyone knows knows several people tested positive. college offers free testing current students several get tests least weekly since convenient. meet time time, outdoors, takeout, 6 feet apart. However, says gets invites house parties indoors kickbacks, without masks, turns down. However, one friends know seriously cold, there's that, least. mentioned start outbreak?

I'm sure many still fact Dr. Fauci others said masks needed, even prevent public panicking keep healthcare workers stocked masks. Ok. got point wrong. Nice point gas exchange. Another respiratory system 150mL dead (rebreathed) air sinuses bronchial tubes seem survive fine that. mask would add marginally that. Breathing effort effect notice personally. swear, like old school Communists trying hang 1980s (I'm old enough remember era).

As saw then, failed systems eventually fail. may take awhile though.  said common knowledge. theory crafting There's vaccine dipshit care March covid apparently infection could pass people?

It's not. one that's currently spreading world-wide high mortality rate does. Epidemiologists telling 7 months. ignore trained professionals?

Side point: mentioned 85 years old... clear, death rates really start dropping significantlhy start looknig people 65 even then, half 10-year bracket get 35. majority people die COVID-19 elderly, they're FAR ones dying. around two thousand Americans 25 35 died disease, despite measures taken, we're entering fall resurgence. Right. CBD good things, THC good things. Getting 'high' call negative side effect patients, still medicate THC specific medicine treats specific condition hand, (in case) PTSD. They're equivalent. beginning pandemic masks used, social distancing encouraged, medical knowledge treat individuals COVID there, etc. ignoring countless confounding variables. people refuse even easiest things like mask wearing social distancing. Condolences loved ones. Brutal lose parents once. never know try! I'll conduct experiments see report back.

Undoubtedly true like treat troops Lol incorrect, cdc state Wisconsin. You‚Äôre soooooo bad this. Retreating another lie see name human decency dont think happy people dying.

Getting virus stupidity different story. dont want die, dont feel sorry get taking basic precautions. couldn‚Äôt even say goodbye grandma, nurse sit tell family loves couldn‚Äôt even handle phone call. customer line told statistically you‚Äôre unlikely die told grandma apart statistics treated like said weather shit, even ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù ‚ÄúOh old she‚Äù

So....as long huffing puffing near others, need confined!?! 

I'm sports...as athlete get think many physical, social, emotional, etc. etc. etc. benefits. big risk COVID spread, halting athletics important thing. Example: Getting ready locker room possible spread environment. 99.9% survival rate you‚Äôre 50

So heavily skewed towards demographic disposable income? Wow almost like selfish people majority demographic America .  quite right misleading title. small change wording definitely makes huge difference intended meaning, quite different article. 
The article merely says diagnosed positive Covid 'some time September', certainly specific, husband died Sept. 28th. 
My condolences family. :( I‚Äôm Wisconsin want everyone states spiked yet understand numbers coming every neighborhood bars restaurants packed high school / college person learning. Ye warned. March again?  - 441 27. 27 deaths

You probably missed **468** overdose deaths 8 months, unfortunately around **700** overdose deaths 2020, comparing **441** deaths 2019.

San Francisco coronavirus death count **133** now. would think they‚Äôd get nicer location. graph take account fact world's Europe's population past much less now. Whitehouse superspreader event outside. realize poverty going to

That's interesting theory, ultimately one that's unfalsifiable. numbers. nurse 100% correct proved don‚Äôt care dead Americans. respect funny. read black plague... something like 40-50% Europe died. 

Yes... almost one every 2 people dead. People thought end world looking countless dead people piled streets. mass graves. 

Fast forward 2020... Americans think end world bars theaters closed need wear face covering everywhere go. estimating number people die COVID without treatment. vast majority cases go untreated, back February March, nearly went untreated, even hospitalized treated ways mainly ineffective. first time friend told ‚Äòsono smart‚Äô wanted die Sadly, might actually work. Absolutely evidence posted supporting claims.  frankie immune covfefe-45 Hurts millions others' mental health. hurts small business owners close lockdown commences. Yep. still people denial train, they've seen coffins buried NYC.

I take ""hurry vaccine"" sake it, I'll lining standard tests completed things look OK. BNL references always get upvotes. 100% sound triggered, basic question. can‚Äôt handle hard questions don‚Äôt think would fit plasma physics world. Look back beginning convo, tjat cna(not nurse) liar gave numbers proved it. Grow child Rona Parts!  OW mention modern-day stance things like evolution

Must big backlog considering sub 1000 people ICU. didn‚Äôt: still economic collapse dead people.

Sweden expressed remorse plans listen scientists going forward. Sensational. news media incredibly toxic. base claim IFR much lower beginning on? elderly care think indication broader problem though, like money savings leading corner cuttings poor (or ill thought out) routines. think IVO Socialstyrelsen recurring complaints/worries many problematic parts elderly care didnt seem get adressed inspections.

FHM little 'fix' that, charge directing supposed operate - actually tell operators sort ""do needful"" (sry meme wording \^\_\^) order keep virus spreading within facilities. think bit misdirected, understandable since FHM public front times.

We also forget many operators successful quickly mobilizing adjusting routines virus. glad see least one bigger private stockholm among them. case still looking data back opinion found one. historical plagues poorly documented best, deaths would've essentially good guessing. Even records century 2 ago inaccurate. Sweden constant flashpoint sides. Whether method horrible great idea remains seen pandemic yet. entire plan take damage start receive less later.

Currently looks bad, death rate 5-10x high neighbors similar economic downturn. hoping they'd much higher amount population immune (I think emails said thinking around 40%) exposed populations Stockholm show 12%.


Very early may appropriate toy method. quickest vaccine world ever produced what? 4 years? 


But ask you, would anyone pursue herd immunity strategy likely months away several viable vaccines deliver risk populations?


It seems downright malicious. shit needs stop.  Republicans.  Came say exact thing Woah that's insanely different Colorado. People fired friend's restaurant *not* wearing mask.

I really recommend can, even feel like nothing worth it.

But anyway good luck! discriminate age,"" Resch said.

Why publications continue spread misinformation? well documented Covid-19 discriminates much age. Yes. Piss sealioning. daily screenings plus sovereign nation set rules. real question is, Garfield eat? Hopefully someone dresses TSA agent really sell security theater Yes Lucky. find duds Facebook dating lol agreeing you. Reddit source matter fact information. heavily slanted biased. ""I refuse get sick child tested solid week illness, even though know there's crisis, assume getting tested make white people dislike me.""

Correct. Racism blame. ...Not sure blame way think is, though.

Non-pacific-island-Asians, according article, mentioned one ""groups regularly face discrimination hospitals"" ... therefore US society racist Asians? That's literally hilarious piece shit article says. one even ever insinuated non-Pacific-Island Asians get tested. health advisory merely include people regularly face discrimination Hospitals. may well true person wrote article care.

""Hate crimes increasing"" according article, yet article name single hate crime, relies harkening back early-1800's railroad building inequity talk discrimination.

I'm going pretend Asians faced discrimination America before... comes COVID-19? lmfao shut up. head. janitor life might difficult janitor. always white people hate you. guess remaining question have, you‚Äôre willing discuss it, whether information heavily influenced two factors: living low - covid area, socializing couple individuals outside household.

Local conditions absolutely affect risk. Areas high case load, quickly rising case load, areas high positive rates (anything 5% indicates significant numbers cases missed) much higher risk areas things much control. places ""levels"" restrictions. risk drops, restrictions drop. fortunate live area relatively good shape, things considered.

However, low risk mean risk. Diseases like COVID19 spread exponentially, meaning single outbreak quickly spread become problem extremely quickly. Diligence needed even lower-risk areas. true [Vermont rather well US however ""by US standards"" low bar clear mean safe. Currently [every US state ""yellow"" (med including Vermont. ""Yellow states need **keep social distancing mask usage** (emphasis mine), yellow green states continue testing contact tracing.""

This kind disease gets control quickly, seen. imperative maintain diligence follow advice health organizations. I, too, live yellow state fooled thinking safe forego basic safety measures. health organizations advise safety measures mean benefits directly way. trying make life terrible. people want disease control exactly live freely. that, advise safety measures public health experts understand disease spreads. may seem minimal layperson may actually cusp disaster again, exponential spread gets control outrageously quickly.

That said, IMO desire meet small gatherings understandable likely acceptable risk given robust monitoring low caseload VT. However, still important diligently mitigate risks. friends/family already significantly increasing risk meeting indoors sitting closely. However, sometimes weather space availability make closed indoor space option. masks come in. Masks last resort. alternative social distancing, final safety measure distancing possible. still try maintain distance ventilation space possible, least wear mask. really quite effortless essential they're already significantly increasing risk meeting closely indoors. really understand resistance masking.

Finally, want address point couple individuals outside household.

A lot people think, oh, I'm meeting one two households, that's lot. outrageous concept; done done well. [It's even issue people think ""social bubble"" term lightly. means combine households households. Everyone needs [agree risk mitigation socialize unmitigated Unfortunately, practice, many people form multiple social bubbles simply abide guidelines. completely defeats purpose puts everyone risk. Multiple bubbles means [things get connected literally opposite bubble supposed (which create isolated social circle people). Even visiting ""[just one connects two thirds households. may think, oh, people, reality even people connects entire community puts everyone risk.

Now say argue in-person socialization happen. contrary, think socialization immensely important. However, safety oneself community also immensely important. believe balance reached people simply maintain appropriate safety measures. Limit gatherings frequency size, maintain distance ventilation, wear mask consistently. high-risk action taken makes mitigation factors even important. close contact required masks/ventilation/limiting time even *more* important already. enclosed spaces required distance/ventilation/masking even *more* important. see many people willing accept one high-risk situation (one 3 C's) reason decide one high-risk factor means protections dropped. boggling exact *opposite* needs happen. risky activities unavoidable mitigation factors much important keeping risk low. Again, socializing problem, complete lack risk mitigation problem. hope girlfriend able recognize really really needs maintain safety measures much possible going choose socialize in-person. ""done"" pandemic mean pandemic done. Best luck! Nope. state Queensland reopened July. vigorous contact checks someone tests positive quarantine community spread begins. exception New South Wales, almost states minimal cases. reporting 1000-1500/day peak. It‚Äôs almost like nature identifying stupid people killing smart people trying really hard keep idiots alive becoming casualty process. live alone?

Yeah sucks folks live alone. Pods friends similar risk profiles needed. fair, initial viral dose matters people already sick, residents positive. negative staff members ones concerned point. needed terribly long time, could somewhat afford relatively recently. Honestly though, think worth work beg someone help. can't even get see regular doctor weeks months advance. None worth it. Lets see results Los Angeles strictest lockdown entire nation due Newsom Garcetti.

We apparently one worst outbreaks ratio high (say 80%) normal times ton people admitted ICU beds created it‚Äôs still full. 

The interesting number perhaps occupancy divided peak emergency capacity. that‚Äôs also bit misleading since last beds peak scenario might worse (less staff, old equipment). It‚Äôs tricky report meaningful way. Again, I'm trolling. know saying seemed absurd point. absurd question legitimate one answered. broader implications. Like level severity government able mandate mask wearing? ask also answer question interested hear people response it. 

Also, I've heard people say ""even saves one life"" sets dangerous precedent. creeps out. sets population accepting slightly government control next time because""of ""even saves one life"" mindset even need severe COVID. stay home quarantine people would quicker accept it. Laws making punishment breaking quarantine severe would supported majority obedient citizens staying home. Also, less people break quarantine faster virus goes away quarantine ends. sets dangerous precedent control power you. Like set major rule game rule favor. quarantine buddy anytime soon :(

Serologic conversion enough least compare asymptomatic/undetected case rates between, exact disease timeline (for healthy young adults given minimum SARS-CoV-2 exposure) would nice seem critical enough justify challenge trials own.

The larger Phase 3 trials necessary anyway I'm seeing challenge trials make path safe, effective vaccine faster significantly likely successful. infinite wisdom? course assumed beginning COVID infection confer lifelong immunity.

And since best risk assessment/management muster, seems pretty clear don‚Äôt cognitive capacity spare. Yet, us difficulty navigating crisis also likely become infected. neurological consequences COVID infections unlikely improve ability deal complexity, ambiguity nuance. So, even though current ability mitigate risk leaves lot desired, may represent local maxima foreseeable future. think many voters around next election followed advice I'm nurse Wisconsin, confirm. Please wear mask. trust people online? land sale...... Reduction what? Literally expected efficacy 70% probably even higher.

agreed,
Until someone sneezes/coughs/clears throat.

Then mask utterly useless. infection almost come outside, means staff members brought in. Transmission staff proliferate testing least twice week even happen. It‚Äôs scary. nursing home many people simply aren‚Äôt viable unless large corporation lots money. That‚Äôs terrible excuse, imagine spending 1600 percent disposable gloves month doubled price. let‚Äôs factor masks. let‚Äôs factor gowns. There‚Äôs additional labor included screening.

Thank that. I've pneumonia multiple times last time just...didn't fully recover. eight years yet, seem like improving slowly. gave hope residual problems actually go away. (assuming entirety society hellbent giving everyone else covid fails). know nothing Ohio‚Äôs politics mask wearing family say: throw kids schools it‚Äôs inevitable they‚Äôve exposed someone else‚Äôs cooties. It‚Äôs exhausting explaining kids masks friends don‚Äôt wear them. easily see mask fatigue setting in. zero sense nuance. anti lockdown perfectly compatible left wing ideaology. looking statistics angle count cases per capita, ignoring fact larger populations means access-points virus spread.

Like China?

Also argument makes sense. larger population alone meaningless, unless arguing average person US contact different individuals average person Singapore? highly doubt makes zero sense discount population density factor given way viruses spread.

It factor, although studies place main one. Also, dense Stockholm, heavily discounting dense cities Norway, Finland even New Zealand seems like decided one thing (lockdown = good) working backwards prove this. that's science works. Also constitutes ""lockdown"" important too, closing things might help closing things could unnecessary even make things worse. complicated situation trying find easy answer for.

This argument vacuous. factors posited would make pandemic worse Sweden *much more* prevalent New York:

- Much higher population density? Check. 

- far bigger proportion population relies public transport? Check. 

- higher % immigrants? Check. 

Yet, New York managed flatten curve much faster Sweden. explain that?

Regardless, see trend varying degrees almost every country went early lockdown versus ones didn't, namely Sweden. outright dismiss trend choosing bury head sand reality lockdowns help getting outbreak control quickly.

Ironically, factors listed worked Sweden arguments lockdown would helped Sweden deal initial closing things could unnecessary even make things worse.

Good, give examples lockdowns making things worse then. time whole thing gets over, feeling surpass ww2 case. Still wanna distance wash hands impaired fact Tegnell taking victory tour media crow it.

- They‚Äôre likely going focus young, healthy volunteers ‚Äúminimize‚Äù risk, means data higher-risk people (the people need data for).

- Infection rates high enough 30k people non-challenge Phase 3 trials still sufficient obtain hundred infections necessary efficacy determination well end trial.

- Phase 3 trial 30k participants still necessary determine safety look rare adverse events. (at least) several-month follow-up period also still required determine longer-term protection adverse events.

So challenge trial won‚Äôt reduce sample size time required phase 3 trials, trials already giving us more-than-adequate efficacy data. challenge trials useless dangerous stunt.

Edit: It‚Äôs worse: first challenge trial isn‚Äôt test vaccine - it‚Äôs determine minimal nasal dose infect people SARS-CoV-2. subsequent challenge trials use minimal dose testing vaccine efficacy. That‚Äôs decent telling efficacy *a minimal exposure* may generalize larger doses probably overestimate efficacy. Lol cdc state Wisconsin? You‚Äôre idiot obviously  *Florida left chat* AAAS EurekAlert! responsible accuracy news releases posted EurekAlert! contributing institutions use information EurekAlert system. people pay attention happening NY? Boy keeping hoax going right election day! /s long lived China say conviction?

 Cause everybody know lived told scary stories made decide even travel there. Two living US now, btw. similar note, hospital pandemic floors rooms act negative air pressure prevent kind spreading well. know 90% people killed car accidents wearing seatbelts? misleading. So, Trump still virus? What's that? feel like whole thing kind came went. seemed REALLY sick awhile, one talking anymore? Probably, Im arguing Sweden right moves, Im arguing comparing directly neighbours wrong since there's alot differences. won‚Äôt. dad flight SLC recently someone sat behind whole flight without mask. guy talking one wear masks everyone goes ahead gets it‚Äôll magically gone. Dude really trying make case herd immunity 2020 advanced medicine science? 

I'm guessing anti-vaxxer? Oh yes. Bring pesky alts downvote oblivion look right. Oldest trick book. 9 months US still hearing taking virus seriously 210,000 deaths. muh immune system contest there. cooked stored properly safe. However, lot many touch points dietary workers meal times greatest exposure something coming singular source nursing home. CDC cannot legally order require masks anyway. One careful note difference privately owned transport, open public transport owned public. Airlines broadly set terms, price, service, risk- example, think might lose airplane hijackers, ban guns carry-ons, despite 2nd amendment rights. Similarly, viral spread inhibits consumer participation service, think solve problem requiring masks. Anyone catch it, anyone die. Percentages maybe, die ""The hospital treating COVID-19 patients ranging age 20s 90s, said."" 


Literally line right quote... get booster Mind 133 days attempt remove community transmission, flatten curve.

we also lot factors state borders rely outcome. Covid antibodies half-life [2.5 Unless whole world gets vaccine around timeframe, sorry, Covid us rest human history. didn‚Äôt ask help. help offered kind insulting. didn‚Äôt appreciate it. 

I‚Äôd rather receive help insulting help. many cases found people taking sip water plane? People die every day kinds causes.  know, see person responding isn‚Äôt exactly rational/stable. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôd rather argue about. stats make rest world's strategy look like failure. That's *really* Sweden failed, demonstrating empirically cost/benefits draconian lockdown measures. plus side, remaining ones reached herd immunity undetermined period time go back normal without letting virus dominate lives. good job around, really. economy suffered much surrounding Scandinavian countries, death per capita much higher. strategy completely failed. following Sweden's case, I've much focused country (US... YEA IK) they've 100k cases 6 thousand deaths, they've used masks lockdowns....

I failing see failure is. Yall ACTUALLY tried slow try stop spread. dumb? miss something? Viruses higher death rate spread population way Covid does, kill incapacitate host, decreasing chance spreading others. 

Specify viruses referring responses precise. Still good know viral load indeed make difference whether someone dies not. Oh that's nothing. Nursing homes Canada decimated. lost upwards 40% residents. transplant here, it‚Äôs ironic people ‚Äúfighting‚Äù freedom wearing mask generally suppressing freedoms don‚Äôt like (alcohol sales Sundays, gambling, abortion, etc.). Shit. search broken... again... So, like trolley problem, choices saving hundreds thousands lives, someone's early political calculations affected. never happen, even proper lockdown first place. People month. literally right wing militia ""storming"" city capitols demanding end lockdown mask wearing. Trump saying would magically dissappear Easter, 6 months later he's hospitalized COVID. complete joke point.


And we're getting worst it? Buckle even Spain France although record numbers cases  that's works. 

a) young people contact old people.

b) 'herd immunity' via exposure misnomer. extreme large amount people die process. 

you want 'flatten curve' anyway possible vaccine suitable treatment mitigate much death possible. UV light still penetrates winter time. Yes it‚Äôs less intense, unless you‚Äôre close Arctic Circle it‚Äôs still present good portion day. South Korea also basically island I'll send thoughts prayers next month news dead denying masks work APFBA acts like know you:) good news, virus controlled. Australia continent, larger feat.  BTS trust Florida, delayed numbers make seem like well try drive tourism traffic again. Probably helps substantially fewer people flying previously, because...no one wants tube full recycled air airborne-driven pandemic. Planes one initial ways spread back March/April. Vaccine side effects pop first 72 hours. 100,000 people already vaccinated fine trains running live air circulation system. sure air gets filtered circulated air outside train trains ever got retrofitted filtration systems, gets nervous. dare expected inconvenienced mask 30 minute flight /s It‚Äôs possible live fear still responsible regarding people encounter. There‚Äôs need cower this, people still need exercise caution. Stop whining freedom sportsball. second lockdown *expected*!  ideal model lockdown removed community transmission 

and chance third wave another hotel quarantine scandal recently royal commission done it. Faucci lie us then?

They want shortage limited ""Cupboard Bare"" PPE years build age health, it‚Äôs nothing worry about. We've hearing summer yet... tactic, too. I‚Äôm non-confrontational, dramatic af attempts steer clear anti-mask idiots. Vote early can.

Buy supplies need afford. Try stretch beyond 2 weeks, though perishables make tough. Limit trips.

Mask can‚Äôt avoid public.

I pray nation coming weeks; welcome accept faith yourself. We‚Äôre one family need part pull this. least spreading entire flight. proportionally, no.

On hand, plainly obvious lockdowns work flattening curve Sweden could avoided many deaths ability even political motivation so. ""Coincidentally"", cases started jumping back 500-1000 day range several weeks schools partially reopened.

If someone saw coming... True masks like masks tuberculosis. takes awhile generate enough aerosols typically masks awesome slowing stuff. might able stop portion particles incoming well fitting mask usually dose reduction strong one pushing stuff

Possible things happening:
- Best: 90% develop antibodies, kept long-term studies found, low levels, 10%-20% get again
- Worst: Antibodies mostly protective. reinfections still quite seldom even scenario, recognized months come.

Other effects:
- people chronic infections &amp; flareups.
- people IgA antibodies wane fast produced all, allowing reinfections, severe lung disease.

Call governor Andy Cuomo. fix it. /S Nothing!! special case makes wonder, even obtaining first sample order genetically sequence? cannot imagine countries storing millions used kits. thought maybe person hospitalized severe Covid might save sample many cases show mild cases least first time symptoms wouldn‚Äôt hospitalized. wears mask office? That‚Äôs bit overkill isn‚Äôt it? Especially everyone else enters wearing mask... masks mandatory what? Bio-terrorism. dang bullshit mink farms work Devil people say clue part chain minks are.

1. Mink eat leftovers meat fish industry. minks, get rid waste somewhere else. 
2. Mink fertilizer ""organic"" therefore used ""organic tomato"". 
3. Mink corpses burned bio-fuel, guess is? Green energy. wanted that? Well, go.
4. Mink fur billion industry furs mainly bought customers China Russia. Western countries close farms, farms move ... guess what, China Russia. much control animal welfare here? Well.... wish horror stories animals, well go there. forget Corona originally started?
5. know US, least Scandinavian fur world's best expensive fur world-wide get good fur? keep mink happy well-fed fresh food. Scandinavia STRICTEST laws comes fur farming means minks live pairs/communities, toys, cave, fresh food fresh straw. that, can't sell fur. farms OPEN visitors always visit them. 
6. Finally: cows milk comes caged well. Pigs caged. Egg hens caged, eat reason people think different. fashion industry one worst environmental factors today, plastic materials polyester/acrylic using petroleum oil produce. Cotton worst ever crop terms amount pesticides water cotton fields kills wild life biodiversity mink farm ever done.
7. Fur lasts 20-50 years naturally degenerated nature. better way combat fast fashion, I'll gladly listen. 

Yeah... lets close it, feel good let future minks suffer middle nowhere China Russia wear feel-good-polyester made China. sure activists make Chinese government change mind animal welfare..

**If support fur: buy it.** 
**If want best animals: Let's keep farms West.**

It sucks real science coming helps us understand world always coopted garbage Facebook posts.  still talking me? still know enough virus make kind declaration... *What happens notice people complying good experience spring, complied with, must consider solutions, says Anders Tegnell.

Especially female similar sized larger man, going get grabbed, dragged ground, hurt. questions clarifications journalists:

*How councils Uppsala differ usual councils?*

It tightening advice, says Anders Tegnell. excluded councils Uppsala may apply regions. pressure healthcare causes FHM introduce local restrictions Uppsala. see increased spread *society* Uppsala, says Anders Tegnell. thus so-called *cluster spread* , even though infection cases linked individual gatherings, Tegnell explains.

FHM chosen introduce recommendations entry exit Uppsala going **restaurant**, feel free so, family spend close time with, says Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist, Public Health Agency.  Anders Tegnell, relevant close restaurants public activities.  general advice establishment want **new advice stores**, Anders Tegnell says:  first place, important make possible people keep distance, example letting many once, clear markings make easy possible actually create new chains infection.  FHM clarified ""physical contact"" tightened Uppsala councils interpreted? physical direct contact (skin skin) socializing referred to?*

This raised press conference. Physical contact corona context skin skin, enough close other, one meter quarter.

\- type contacts entails highest risk infection type contacts want minimize Uppsala much possible, says city epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell.

*But general council keep distance, difference?* *(for local restrictions Uppsala ed. note)*

\- difference point clearly certain activities quite obviously difficult maintain type distance. make even clearer difficult impossible carry party without ending close contact.

\- Instead general recommendation keep distance, also point number different activities know difficult keep distance see spread infection type activity.

*What know role super-spiders spread infection?*

\- person certain context become super-spreader. collecting information country seen many examples super spreaders Sweden, says Anders Tegnell.

*What happens notice people complying restrictions?*

\- good experience spring, complied with, must consider solutions, says Anders Tegnell. Capitalism working attended.

We quite literally looking extinction level event humanity......

But dollars though, right? well covid hits nursing homes there's much higher chance residents wont make given age underlying medical conditions. important covid kept nursing homes Wow must nice live seem surprised this. not. predicted along happening. happening across country now..not states April July...this far worse before. gotten flu shot, might wise move so. Unlike many, husband stayed home (in Florida) intend venture Biden elected instituted measures get control...see next summer, maybe! taiwan, South korea,Singapore and...many countrirs There‚Äôs absolutely evidence covid spread food. friend works there. said half staff tested positive. 

Employees still forced worked. Positive Staff members paired positive staff. That's objectively wrong statement. serious comment? literally following governor's guidelines. cautious regulations area. governor great serious since march, trump talks shit time. 

As long following guidelines see evil I'm allowed kick inconsiderate sub humans wear masks. Got it.


/s Im Colorado area uptick state travel. Like every car another state. Yet 5.2% positive rate least average US. conspiracy theorists back: cloth masks integral *protect others* you. 

Cloth masks marginally effective preventing inhaling infectious particles meant 1:1 PPE substitute high risk situations. 

That said, collective (""herd"", will) benefit large portions population wear masks. sound like problem solution. long exactly think ‚Äúthey‚Äù spent calling racist? take hours days time? Also people? ‚Äúthey‚Äù names? quarantine protocals. aunt worked nursing home 90 patients died Covid early on. didn‚Äôt adequate PPE, kept working floor caught it, too, almost one else would help. She‚Äôs 60. survived, retired second could leave good conscience. They‚Äôve studying vaccines long. That's works, initial claim FHM pursued herd immunity based emails. burden evidence arguing position. also mention emails moon made cheese either, mean say FHM believes moon made cheese there's evidence opposite. bit Weird took like 150 years germ theory widely accepted come conclusion worm pleases orange Daddy. That's exactly what's happening too. Rural NW Ohio going ""hot bed"" long. kids school went back hybrid 7-12 next weeks several confirmed cases. 

I give school credit, great job considering dealing with. girls tired wearing masks constant hand washing, hated remote learning. taking school, obviously kids wear masks bus, girls ride bus long time afternoon, they've already day(also, they're making drivers wear well, understand, seem unsafe me), easier everyone go grab them. typo. also deaths recorded to. arguing arguing official numbers 4 million ""absurdly"" high 330 million people. Land border closed, flights still happening countries visit another country must quarantine 2 weeks immediately. Coffee? 2020, year - called - civil rights turned rights expendable privilegies. 

A year due process discarded sentenced politicians punsihment homejail without commiting crime all. 

Poor bastards there. aint approaching well. Next month I'll taking first flight since COVID-19 started. I'm looking recommendations mask wear flight. suggestions specific mask purchase air travel? Also, goggles worth buying purpose? boggles mind government whose measures cases 0 stood watched infections growing 10 times record daily infections first wave. Yes perfect world would, need get groceries abd medications sometimes. N95 (valveless) would best dont end contracting flu top covid don‚Äôt spew everyone since spread bioaerosols breathing. missed Melbourne. See get decried idiot science denier 
I think might wrong always seen smoke particles larger covid droplets (my source 


Even construction work face fitted mask concrete silica dust that‚Äôs way bigger covid particles. 

If it‚Äôs spread airborne don‚Äôt see mask help all. 
The health agency‚Äôs done 180 expect everyone follow advice unquestionably wear mask obligated don‚Äôt think *much* impact stopping someone catching covid there, says ""Coronavirus hospitalizations Texas..."" I'm beginning envy Sweden.

They back normal life. 

Great job.

Meanwhile, cases surging Europe. Except entire almost year we've studying it. ‚ÄúSlavery‚Äù.

These guys union probably making ludicrous amounts money. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry paying bills‚Äù lol ru 14 Dr. Hotline one best folks follow this. business politics.

This disturbing think about. No, haven‚Äôt heard before. masking forever now? Fudge. getting data? understand concerns. points covered last response. Still participating hct challenging decision many, many potential risks. absolute understand some/many it. point widespread virus enough - covered. statement first Generation working - covered. Still points absolute valid concerns substance. sign up? 

What potential impact accelerating development one additional vaccine? 
We manufacturing supply chain capacity produce billions vaccine doses needed across globe one vaccine. Accelerating development one additional safe effective vaccine even couple days could save thousands lives. 

Measuring exact impact difficult. currently uncertain many people COVID-19 affect worldwide speed impacts felt. Possible outcomes shaped interventions like social distancing, capacity health systems, potential drug treatments, many factors. vaccine may come infection peaked effective pharmaceutical treatments blunted COVID-19‚Äôs impact. clear COVID-19 continue alter daily life effective vaccine fully deployed. 

While estimate deeply uncertain, give sense scale vaccine‚Äôs impact, suppose daily confirmed COVID-19 deaths remain July 2020 average around 5,000 per day. additional vaccine could avert 25% deaths, speeding vaccine development by: 

1 day saves 1,250 lives
1 week saves 8,750 lives
1 month saves 37,500 lives
3 months saves 112,500 lives

I think 38k people signed want help end earlier less victims. deaths covid. Starving people. Jobloss. Longhaulers. Think bad things covid brought. All. maybe end suffering earlier. Maybe Impact worth try. know get accepted trial loose health life. things worth risk. They've actually introduced new law recommendation today (or maybe yesterday) get power limit numbers better. numbers trains, shops, gyms etc. 

I think help corona start preparing better laws future emergencies. 

The good thing whilst can't force anything happen, people listen recommendation made. Certainly I've personally seen Swedes listen recommendations Brits listen laws example. track end year death count line average previous five years.

The countries mentioned track end year death count lower average previous five years. matter slice it, lack lockdown end costing Sweden +/- 6k extra deaths peak outbreak. Well apparently Texas DFW lot Texans wearing masks. Ok? understand issue. want use knowingly defective ventilators?

Oh fine, catches fire supplies oxygen, nothing worry about. Headline unnecessarily gloomy.

With vaccine we'll get thing finally control, eradication goal. Quick summary:

* Saline nasal rise deactivate viruses. 1% baby shampoo does.

* Listerine equivalently formulated mouthwashes amazingly effective deactivating viruses. Hydrogen peroxide helps some, nearly effective. think great move, still could tell people's comments fb üôÑ. people difficult? Agree point one died family‚Äôs scenario. jagoffs 

GTFO Steelers fan üòÜ cases eliminated yet countries, think handled pretty well. First imposed lockdown, tracing testing done. heard friends, citizens acted discipline cooperated government regards guidelines. topic, remember younger wanted live US, now, go even give free ticket. think China deliberately lying numbers, saying friends' experience. people showing symptoms

These people even go out, like first ""rule"" Sweden: ""Stay home feeling sick"". went county board meeting two months ago, 10% board 70% attendees masked. Six weeks later, ZERO board members masked 2 attendees masked, including me. felt obviously branded politically wearing mask. attended business, left immediately piece done. rural county southwest Ohio. voted everyone line masked (hopefully \*is\* sign branding) ventured shop afterward shopkeeper told could take mask microbiologist (really? cause looks like shopkeeper) masks help, furthermore make sick reuse them. noped out. discouraging. Yeah, Nordic countries also seeing less deaths previous years measures taken. fact Sweden excess deaths egregious. Laobaixing don‚Äôt fuck around.  Like already said, vast majority DFW least wear them. wanted keep PPE hospital workers. Well done, look like closest comparison Singapore, opened earlier plan full opening end year.

They vigilant though, continue control measures contact tracing still necessary. stay home suggestion. logic applies novel coronavirus ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hah, doubt it. could pick actual epidemiology... freedumbers wearing masks? Surely realize vaccine stop need masking distancing..... It‚Äôs probably different terminology. N95 3m american manufacturer. NIOSH approved masks. assume Europe certification org this. Basically need mask filters vacuum sealed face. Could like inject it? maybe shine super bright light it? know, inside... STABLE GENIUS! There's statewide mask mandate, I'm sure talking about. wearing mask treated like domestic terrorism. No. government says can't sex. lockdown relaxed restrictions uncontrolled spread again. Rinse + repeat vaccine ready. 

This bullshit. Cumulatively people wearing higher end masks (specifically people showing symptoms high risk) everyone else (healthy people asymptomatic) wearing cloth mask work. Studies surgical/cloth mask show offer protection much 70% compared 95%. doesn‚Äôt account tue cumulative effect may higher everyone wearing face covering. Fellow same-birthday buddy! Instead usual trip go see college friends, sat home played video games day met one friends hike following weekend. ideal, made hopefully (yeah, our) next birthday standard super! Schools open. bubble burst. I‚Äôd think learned lot handling foreign media knew February. I'd consider option #3. still need vaccine order get end, otherwise keep aggressive controls place forever. go back 1st October (since lag), excess deaths compared average 2015-2019 (with 2019 lowering average lot). know 86% elderly getting infected successful. possible use eliminate China Australia. got first day zero 725 cases per day August due continued lockdown. Soon, countrywide elimination. agree Europe can‚Äôt though grade school bus driver would stop bus make threatening gestures wooden paddle. air marshals days? that's good thing! playing devil's advocate here, access emails, can't claim proof herd immunity emails.

 However, totally agree. way US could adopt strategy public voluntary compliance. possible. flew southwest 1.5 hr flight
Although middle seats open, several people eating whole flight wearing masks properly eating. Flight attendants jack shit walked aisle 20 times never said word them. Pissed much.

Although love southwest let's say YMMV. need ruthless masks. User almost nothing still much

Twice much still 10k deaths Germany, something would call ""not much"". keep mind discussing dozens reinfections. 27 million documented covid recoveries.

That's like saying 8 billion people, 19 astronauts died going space back. Therefore, space travel far safest form travel. haven‚Äôt heard uk govt mention recommended masks. ""Freedom"" American means self centered asshole rejects science decency [MFW scientific understanding SAAAAME. birthday early April lockdowns first kicked SUCKED. least bleach I‚Äôm contact tracing time Biden would take office, months away whole thing (unless something goes wrong vaccines). Maybe even less since hopefully things start improving incrementally months following vaccine. would almost foolish incur cost time investment setting full scale national contact tracing program final like 20% thing. CCP democratic selecting promoting leaders. fucking criticize politicians China, cannot call overthrow CCP. There's big difference Americans ignorant understand. un seem take quite serious. Berlin seem fail willingly.

In general states negligent ramp personnel summer would never end. suspect Canada it'll similar flu vaccine rollout, larger scale. GoC already stockpiled enough supplies vaccinate every Canadian 2x, one big concerns. provincial health boards already logistics place flu vaccines, think (hope?) it'll fairly smooth, though obviously larger scale effort. still, take months, first rounds probably going high risk people. 

For comparison:

For flu vaccine Ontario, ordered 5.4M doses population 14.6M. first shipments went FAST, they're easy get, available town. half dozen spots within walking distance home offer flu shot, walked lunch break weeks ago get one pretty quickly. complaints specific pharmacies clinics stock, see Shoppers Drug Mart map two near right now, count pharmacies clinics area. Basically want one right now, get one, may require going different location.

As healthy adult comorbidities, I'd expect able get jabbed around March got December. Probably sooner people unwilling get first round, going way less travelled area town. virus going it‚Äôs stretching routine right now. keep pointing (apparently vain), good reasons generally takes years run vaccine trials.

And due money effort needed find test subjects.  takes actual time see happens given test.

You decided COVID-19 trials faster virus freaks out. that's viewpoint based upon dread, based upon scientific reality.  You‚Äôre completely ignoring hospital capacity. 4% one state could lot worse 5% another depending local healthcare system Nothing 100% except complete isolation, masks reduce risk transmission lot.

It's stupid people want ""reopen economy"" anti mask. want economic activity 100% pro mask. Cool, make sure wear mask. likely, yes. nothing changes who's office go another shutdown. US country Oxford/AZ running trial yet resumed pause last month? seem rushing buy stock, raises important geopolitical/human welfare concerns, regulatory process seems faster similarly developed nations parents live Wisconsin. One adjacent metro area, one little bit town. 

They‚Äôre smart. haven‚Äôt gone eat since March, wear masks, I‚Äôm pretty sure dad wears goggles bi-monthly Costco run. Every time talk either them, they‚Äôre frustrated neighbors co-workers don‚Äôt take seriously. 

It sucks live Petri dish, it‚Äôs Petri dish doesn‚Äôt good options food delivery. They‚Äôre fucking thing hard-mode. know. lot said, said going around regarding coronavirus baseless rhetoric people planting flags around. wish people would go source look raw statistics. hospitals crowded, people dying, death rates overall way up, masks reduce blood oxygen healthy people reduce radius significant aerosol transmission much less normal 2 meters.

It's debate. bloody numbers, math scientific facts.  Private militia legal Michigan. idiots guns cosplaying SWAT. continually ignoring basic statistics? Here: current lockdown regulations across country, no, Florida better New York.  It'd impactful ill looked like mask violaters - young, slender, White. observation, naive. hospital located Marathon County - county 135k people.

It surprise also taking patients surrounding counties, many hospitals makes crazy people talk transferring Swedish model without talking really high level people pre-existing conditions lack universal health care. Youve already edited comment correct one several errors.

You correct fact wrong multiple orders magnitude becauae literally dont know calculate percentage.

There least two errors making also


You obviously programmer making six figures. Youd fired long ago innumerate.

Quit bullshit. stupid. can‚Äôt source unknown. think majority population guesstimate based risk factor vs want enter society without government telling socialize. higher ups well aware people tired this. aren‚Äôt gonna forever it‚Äôs doubtful they‚Äôll another year. Yeah maybe next year we‚Äôll wear mask baseball game something, virus isnt concern governments. can‚Äôt ask sources everything loose estimate best (and even epidemiologists tell that). look relatively predictable nature people. Hopefully, user children. generally shitty response sea generally shitty responses. Gotcha. 1. elderly do, could focus without restricting rest population. vulnerable poor children, whenever govt tries control economy like now, massive economic contraction throws far vulnerable suffering.
2. People would participate things open. govt close bc close own, otherwise need restrictions. 
3. support effort destroy lives saves.
4. stimulus save millions children suffering (probably increase inflation money go straight big corps)
5. Epidemiologists driving policy decisions bc idea economies work collateral damage leads suffering. Thanks, yeah, I'm familiar lot I'm fan post pre post war American fiction. I've also read lot theories TB thought inspiration concept vampirism. people theorizing making assumptions brotha. I‚Äôm arguing population prevelance IFR.

Talking think happen population vaccinations start rolling doesn‚Äôt require source Great article goes *why* people admit it: cultural taboo public dissent Ugh sorry lol hot zones around NYC, rural areas better, lower population density helps. cou tey work together never end... country even tried doctor scientific study prove hospital grade masks work. 

Now make less tests everytime number newly infected goes much.

It glorious world live in, bad fatalist care happens it. K, physician, explain extra deaths US/ world experienced since pandemic started. 

You're needed back little conspiracy sub. I'm even sure whether user troll genuinely believes say. either case shenanigans unforgivable. god-damned wall text china 80k cases 2 months beginning pandemic whilst video's citizens making rounds showing people welded buildings. citizens yelling lie staged photo op showing china getting ""under control"" spraying everything. 

you one people taking face value. bet.  funny 20-30 year olds going pay long term price virus stands almost chance killing them. Oh, that's one thing gonna comment that...

Carry delusions. Spoiler: won't.

Recently talked someone who's father suddenly died couple months ago Florida. father diagnosed COVID.

The son, 40s, stated dad *happened to* COVID died.

He said ""we hospitals overrun like made big to-do about!"" since wife nurse (outpatient non- hospital). said yeah governor locked shit down.

He also said ""Well Florida, they're open fine."" say ""Just depends cost willing pay...""

Some people genuinely struggle basic logic. That's Imperial. nonsense living Dear diary.

Bro I‚Äôm giving theory using critical thinking. Great much. Homeland security use excuse. agree. But....wait department Homeland security spin people got shots wearing masks helps flu well. get downvoted, get upvoted. Wow one learns. Common assumptions wrong CovId (like things), yet people keep pulling asses. I'm naive. Let's try avoiding personal attacks. federal government failed us, people want avoid mass death disability.

It would've easy provide aid, national mask mandate, still use targeted closures. 10s millions children live poverty every year, now, deniers never said anything. can't get haircut join cause. Brigaders skeptical subs. must banned! overturned though? Yes, read that. today news piece NPR contact tracing found risk low. masks. leaving hospital working COVID patients day going grocery shopping still wearing scrubs? know could toss garage bag stuff sack leaving hospital. watched news first time long time shit not, segment segment dead toddlers. Nothing related covid... old repeated stories toddlers died 1 -2 years ago various circumstances.

Nothing new relavent. know thought better idea covid news. risks? Maybe swishing sip around mouth, tongue, teeth, etc. part state well entrenched superstition myth-worship. area kid died parents thought prayer alone would save treatable illness. I'm surprised all. Absolutely. They'll get paid $3K-$5K per week so. fiancee travel assignment like $4K per week plus accommodations nice hotel full month. much greater chance national plan thing.

He create national plans day long......but enforced. Look example cities mandate masks....ok that's good. But, local law enforcement (Sheriff) enforce it. happens Sheriff's refuse? Tbh see lawsuits handed mandating enforce it. 

The people strip Sheriff power/make want do.....are state supreme court judges.  case followed them, *zero* forcing Sheriff's anything this. Why? Court dockets backlogged nearly year, plus state supreme courts simply care. 12 people died Covid yesterday wisconsin. person liar. ethical send people wars kill maim? Gonna gone summer ass. Winter covid19 wave come. Lol exactly expected response. something proved said (of would speculation), would put shut up.

How often ""common knowledge"" wrong far CovId? times count. know covid does, work physician. 
Now mention symptoms covid 19 please enlighten us... 
A coronavirus Positive person asymptomatic counted covid, even relatives around... again, covid syndrome symptoms. 
By logic, VIH(+) persons counted AIDS? No. 
So yes, numbers hyped. Yesterday lady work told ""H1N1 killed 40 million people make big deal that.""

For reference, know actual numbers, estimate H1N1 worst year 150,000 600,000 deaths. those, 12,000 US. 

Another fun fact: lady charge custodians cleaning sanitizing buildings!

Where fuck people getting ""information?!"" Thank brave volunteers! whole sub deserves respect.  it? illustrating overall risk. 0.02 seems like really small number justify insane restrictions. read article let guess.... two weeks away True true fuck purity gatekeeping bullshit. New facts cause change behavior anyone care think world revolves around them. Would travel nurses easily agree work COVID-infested site? increase risk even people getting sick? PPE would help, people would spend 12 hours per day site, even best PPE could fail them. Maybe understand internet works, proof still there. smart one, buddy? someone Wisconsin confirm. go away. data demonstrates leaders listen scientists get shit control, getting shit control get back semblance normalcy. Gotta love guys think virus bagged tagged tougher people them. hubris plain entertaining point. hasn‚Äôt virus dealt early on

This always said here, even hindsight America‚Äôs perfect pandemic response?

We're even Thanksgiving yet... brother thinks fake. sends articles constantly. thinks Covid exists one dying ""near death"" anyway.

His latest thing flu rates southern hemisphere super low, somehow must due conspiracy make Covid rates look higher keep tourism shut down. 

Ironically, I'm physician actually care Covid patients. pretty much stop talking him. guy (or Girl), could cut trimmer.

TBH days little issue single mirror.  Wait, people die causes??? Well I'm primarily concerned covid deaths particular moment cause occurring extremely high rate. wear masks!

The pope wore white mask service Rome Basilica Santa Maria Aracoeli. Previously wore masks car taking weekly audiences Vatican.

He come criticism, particularly social media, wearing mask general audiences sometimes coming relatively close contact visitors.

Francis, 83, attended service Christian leaders basilica, including Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader Orthodox Christians.

Simultaneously locations Rome, Jews praying city‚Äôs synagogue Buddhist, Sikh, Hindu Muslim leaders also prayed peace.

The event took place number people tested positive coronavirus risen steadily Italy past weeks.

There also relatively small spike Vatican, four members Swiss Guards, elite colourfully dressed corps protects pope, also tested positive COVID-19.

The annual event started late Pope John Paul Rome‚Äôs Catholic Community Sant‚Äô Egido 1986. scaled year coronavirus pandemic.

The pope took mask read address, leaders spoke, put back finished speaking.

The pope part one lung removed illness young man native Argentina. sometimes breathes heavily climbing steps.

Justin Welby, Archbishop Canterbury spiritual leader world‚Äôs Anglicans, attended event could COVID-19 restrictions. think it‚Äôs hysterical sad whole group brigaders skepticism subs pushing narrative daily questions thread. sad group people Actually restaurants actually really following food safety laws, every time, would wear masks also, got this. server, took class. rarely see everything supposed implemented ‚ÄúBro, it‚Äôs fine now. Football everything‚Äù Yes. there's still risk that, sure, there's evidence sweat spread covid. Items like barbells someone might touch face/sneeze hand, touch, could risky. Hand hygiene touching face important, still get infected way. 

But yes, safer gym people masked vs gym people unmasked conditions same.

I work 6-7 days week, still worth risk inside gym point, personally. Good year lots hiking, too. Lack argument. Ok. People U.S. claim kinds restrictions lockdowns. get mad businesses requesting mask usage. big part problem spreads waves, many places people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs serious wave isn‚Äôt yet. they‚Äôre half right, wave isn‚Äôt yet. hits they‚Äôre instantly overwhelmed. Yeah think govt restrictions hurt poor. relevant again? Local Bowling Alley filled capacity every weekend. Wear mask walk door. Take party night inside. cant understand. Yeah, anything entire world trying avoid much contagious virus. Students going overseas allowed get vaccine. confirmed locally super alarming efficacy determined, students using justify following covid rules, definitely part large scale study phase 3. Emergency approval apparently super easy connections pay it. TLDR? think 9 months mess, that's problem, longer mine. Adults capable making choices. feel cannot afford catch virus, power you, stay home. restrict social life longer. raised wage minimum wage workers only. make anything higher minimum wage got increase all. bullshit, honest.

They putting much jobs right now, more. 

My husband food beverage manager one and, especially beginning people buying tons food like crazy, workload was/is ridiculous. nothing significant show it. all. GOP controlled legislature passed lame duck laws Scott Walker way limiting power Governor. Basically neutering incoming Governor, Tony Evers. tried challenge laws, conservative leaning State Supreme Court upheld laws. 

Even so, seems doubtful they'd done anything specific public health.   SK Asian countries wear masks...they HOST things. media never ever cover it. SK's covid response even great btw. best goes Taiwan China. SK middle Japan worst. know bad Season tickets Packers, becoming available. It‚Äôs crazy took plague anarcho lockdown skeptics care poor. Lol projecting we? method definitely helpful development vaccine smoking weed everyday since March , ive Covid free read back, answered question, conspiracy doc. RemindMe! 1 week ""rapid acceleration"" Hospitals can‚Äôt stay open aren‚Äôt profitable. That‚Äôs silly statement. You‚Äôre alternative hospital don‚Äôt. Results challenge trials pretty apparent quickly Germany implement 9pm curfew past weekend cases skyrocketing? guess something lost translation.  US means ""ok, that's nice, refuse ass something help."" population prevalence high enough don‚Äôt need to. population prevalence isn‚Äôt high enough need to, there‚Äôs generally pressing justification challenge trial either.

It‚Äôs extra stupid they‚Äôre going focus healthy people risk infection lower, exactly people LEAST IMPORTANT study vaccine.

And what? efficacy portion Phase 3 appropriately powered hundred infections, it‚Äôs still necessary follow recipients months check longevity protection long-term / rare-event side-effects. challenge trial can‚Äôt reduce necessary time portions Phase 3, reduce necessary sample size adverse effect monitoring. 

There‚Äôs literally nothing gained! know darkest part &amp; look back stats &amp; reports? Also worst part may different depending city/country. people. Btw, actually seen Robbie Parker video? He's laughing gets character. pretty fucked up. Professor Sir Stephen Holgate said ""COVID-19 caught us surprise. experience gained personally wider environment important lessons learnt virus, society ensures best prepared cope future."" 

Professor Holgate gives insight recent Government report created 37 experts request Government‚Äôs Chief Scientific Advisor potential new wave COVID-19 winter. carrot asking people nicely

No.

A carrot's *positive reward*. thing get X. ""abstract X"". Not, I'll ""reward later"" definitely ""your reward punishment"".

The stick's *negative reward*. it, I'll beat you.

This neither. ""do say, neither reward punishment, except theoretically circumstances punish people disobey even obey later date"".

Not sure difficult understand. saddens me. I've seen trend non-believers saying ""well everyone dies"". We've spent long time medical history trying prevent unnecessary deaths think exception matter?

 understand relate concept. 
 
 hear often tell never go doctors again, take medications, get surgery everyone dies right? Would feel child could prevented? car accident side road bleeding would want drive wave ""everyone dies""?

 understand people can't take things seriously care fellow man.  know meant numbers. numbers small. never answered number big enough justify mass suffering? really sorry upset make much money you. Developers known way analyzing systems. calculators. write algorithms make processes run quickly. design software architectures solve problems purposes. developer see full picture.

We're gerrymandered fuck right now, legislature largely GOP.  Governor Evers kind make mask mandate ""toothless"" lack better term otherwise GOP Legislature would created shitstorm left us absolutely mandate installed back spring.   Legislature convened something like 180 days.  GOP crooked fuck, Wisconsin testing ground areas country. Really think current protesters festival goers analyzing things level  Wow, survival rate go ventilator really low continue miss point. That‚Äôs true. avoid main page contains data facts. *Sigh*

Where say live Kenosha County? 

And obviously, impossible represent entire state whole. But, multiple comments specified, Wisconsin *bad* wearing masks. anything, letting liberal bubble Milwaulkee bias personal experience. 

Just Tony Evers skirted thinnest margins *not* mean popular. ever driven rural Wisconsin? seen racial, political shit put billboards everywhere? seen deep ""No Bullshit Trump 2020"" signs are? 

And also, severely misinterpreting statement. said clearly, Milwaulkee Madison, state would red. 100% true Outside counties surrounding big cities, Walker like 65-35%. C'mon, sing song. Ruin days getting stuck heads. That's ok big bro, know big bros need safe spaces. honey YOU""RE anti-social asshole yikes Yep, even such, 10-15% people infected TB go active form disease. others latent infections always present bodies may triggered active disease later variety factors.

It'll interesting see Latent TB react if/ infected Covid-19.

Edit: cursory [Google  Makes sense. Especially type alcohol. always like scientific community actually puts well researched article. time often find saying, duh, people need know alcohol kills covid? I've self isolating room home past days.

A lady supermarket coughing deeply. sounded like YouTube videos covid cough. wearing masks next day, headache.

The first time, ran away another aisle. comes around behind another aisle notice coughs again. ran gave scolding look way out. Okay evidence disproves research responding to?? Probably not, lol GAS Swedish position masks work all. (Obviously since used health care settings)

Swedish authorities actually reprimanded fired doctors nurses insisted wearing masks defiance Tegnell's mask Swedish authorities actively discouraged people wearing face masks, said would spread panic, often worn wrong way, provide false sense safety. doctors insisted wearing mask work reprimanded even fired. People already marched streets, armed assault rifles. one stopped them. saying pseud. I'm saying that, given record handling virus, there's zero reason doubt pharmaceutical developments similar quality. accept there's working vaccine coming ü§£ 

I‚Äôm missing anything. Expecting every business ‚Äúhave (excess) cash savings,‚Äù demonstrates don‚Äôt know many business models/industries operate. we've making effort reduce rate deaths since dawn human history. article says people getting infected traditional biomarker indications (insulin (2), GAD (3), IA-2 (4), zinc transporter 8).

""'COVID could causing diabetes scratch,' said Dr. Francesco Rubino""

""'We could dealing entirely new form diabetes.'"" (For reference fulminant Type 1 discovered 2003).

""This year, doctors also seeing people without risk factors type 2 diabetes - older overweight - experience diabetic emergency exposure COVID-19.""

Lastly, would guess Asia fulminant Type 1 seems form disease much prevalent Asian communities unknown reason. unknown majority cases occur Asia, one study find (using 3 patients) Asian.

Source things article: T1D 25 years. Worked Joslin Center Diabetes. friend  ok sorry, said 'prescribe' see used synonymously 'advise' - agreed, wonder drug sleeping, super neat science coming covid affects well! would lockdown something becomes like flu? Every weekend company! üñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï. dont support people supports hoax. Covid 19 fucking hoax. Cut fear mongering pieces shit. 140 per day.

If 1-in-10 dying novel disease even exist year ago, might problem.

But you, mean particular. problem numbers. understand magnitude apparently. Oh get looking terms profit people dying. makes sense. nice big mandatory fine like drunk driving boot 14 days big fine 2nd offense. suggested march really plan way forces people meet indoors? indeed somewhat dampen enthusiasm idea. thought would setup drive-through/walk-through points one-way flow well-spaced people outdoors - considering involve army, fair amount ""field"" infrastructure available. likely new infections 4 weeks ago still 4k per day. Almost every highschool world like lol. highschools offer way freedom countries around world. culture politics dumb af. anything lack authoritarianism causing this. think China's free thinking helped control pandemic?

To beat pandemic need strong authority obedient citizens citizens care deeply harming other. Americans give fuck either. even mean allying pandemic?

The basic fact matter China beat didn't, fucking stupid.

They're pool parties large gatherings economy running everything fine now. getting nowhere all. Let's try save lives see goes

Except that's ""the west"" doing. one goal western government ""save"" economy. people die, that's life. Uh huh.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Regardless political stance, GOING GO AWAY CONTINUE IGNORE IT. SHIP. EITHER STEER CLEAR ICEBERG RAM IT. THANK HOSPITAL STAFF WORKING THIS. don‚Äôt understand links saying, troubling. Wisconsin good shape right now. really believe people censored alternative viewpoints? I've always censorship personally. been. I‚Äôve seen group friends year birthday. wore masks stayed good distance apart. 

There much individual, who‚Äôs correct stuff, physically do. still forced go work outside current job, people want keep Economy going. Yep, trust Russian Chinese vaccine more. Try honest here, it‚Äôs 85% that‚Äôs optimum operating occupancy hospitals. people died, stop lying please Anyone trusting China's numbers anything, deaths, cases, GDP, ANYTHING, complete moron.

The great thing Chinese numbers *don't* take face values. One thing looking foreign supply chains depending China (for production selling market), imported covid cases data neighboring countries (ie, Korea) understand data points one big fact: China recovery *is* real.

So now, either continue call ""Chinese bots"" facts align beliefs, start demonstrate critical thinking half brain. choice really, reality facts care personal beliefs. Omg thought masks work. Twitter YouTube told didn't. /s ""Have right lonely nights?"" Like PM already did. someone could save Wisconsin thanks :) hair inside walmart scary.  Okay, guess surprised moderate based personal views.  least pretending otherwise. Someone told grad school LOL! 75 year old uncle got Covid. terrible health history several cancers strokes. Honestly expecting pass years now. Covid basically cold symptoms. hospitalization required.

I known several positive cases. None required hospitalization.

Most people get Covid *dont need* kind ""best doctors treatment"". pile next cliff keeps getting blow wind nothing come Trump's crimes gross incompetence. voted shit governor agree benefits, comment sarcastic led on. see advertised many varying ailments.  got arrested trying kidnap governor. think irrelevant healthcare system US? benefit hindsight, years time would absolutely surprised learn covid deaths/increased associated mortality already *half million people* US right now. History going look back year weep. like brainwashed one worst subreddits site We've flattened curve ü§∑  Ugh..... No, haven‚Äôt

Outside handful places situations (most notably, New York early brief period Texas places), absolutely flattened curve continued entire time. Anyone telling otherwise lying you. healthcare system large fine, bit stressed. 

I cannot speak EU, won't. US flattened However, certain death poverty

""Certain death"". feel coming honestly, lied know fact form fiction. overwhelmingly likely fine, even high risk segments. young-ish healthy, odds death fall nearly zero. 

I'm going pretend serious disease needs managed, calling certain death hyperbole max. Islamist terrorism heard World Trade Center attacks 

I'm trouble making connection. Islet auto antibodies mainly diagnosing Type 1 Diabetes. help diagnose T1D insulin dependent (yet). 

Fulminant Type 1 Diabetes also autoantibody negative, means markers commercially used test type T1D currently. doesn‚Äôt mean autoimmune involvement, haven‚Äôt found yet. 

Yes lot learn covid19, jump conclusions particular virus causes T1D (especially ‚Äúnew type T1D‚Äù) stretch. 

Most likely triggers autoimmune process like F1TD is. doesn‚Äôt typical T1D markers, also could F1TD given abrupt onset. causes T1D know. F1TD new subtype it‚Äôs course completely different, fast rapid deterioration fatal unless aggressively treated. 

With viruses, surprise trigger different types inflammation response. people want know particular virus higher risk triggering disease it‚Äôs unlucky individuals. 

Like measles cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis years recovery. like Coxsackie B virus causes myocarditis.  exactly studies report, media give headlines. would misleading gave min, max, average depending agenda exactly moderna made theirs. Honestly live America sad also funny time even though havuube

When idiot like trump telling people virus bound get problem

Not people believe 

Then people act put mask for

Sure, thanks invasive meddling do-gooders activist judges. pandemic every year.

So concerned people dying pandemic? orders magnitude less deadly flu, yet still stay home I'm sick flu season wash hands vigilantly.

Yes, *right now, moment* (it's like 8 months) is, time deaths things probably concerned about. care about? Yes, absolutely do.

So people care screw off? That's selfish attitude have. many people dying obesity people care about! fight *EVERYONE!!1!* (Did get right?) Lmao typical redditors, downvote away someone says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre funny‚Äù upvotes galore toothless centrist posts don‚Äôt say anything posts people clamoring fear, shaming people hanging groups 5, fear mongering permanent organ damage bullshit.

You can‚Äôt serious think it‚Äôs rational side that? One side wants prevent protecting vulnerable healthy build immunity keep economy going, feed starving children. side wants completely ignore damage wide sweeping shutdowns causing poor working class people around globe sAvEs LiVeS! Yes, shutdowns save lives, covid least, never mind ***children*** developing countries literally starving 84 year old uncle Jim live 87. surprising Neenah, Appleton, Oshkosh, GB currently fire covid. number bars people flat giving roof. Also, you‚Äôre interested pre-panic planning exactly question, look CDC recommendations pandemic flu Obama era. Even flu projected kill 1.8m people, CDC plan recommended closing schools 12 weeks due harm school closures cause. panic, schools insisting 12+ months closure. dodged question completely. Fail. No, understa analogy.

The reason works people tested reinfectipn (which requires testing g dor strain).

A small number small small sample. 300K+ 

US typically \~50K pneumonia deaths per year. today 210K, including least 110K tested COVID. Oh, Texas...  tested morning party days beforehand, allowing people potentially contract time? think US going for...the election! almost mentioned UW college towns among Madison/Milwaukee sanity bubbles. Yes, wonder over, still way WFH grocery delivery ever Covid. Fwiw chipotle noodles town places feel totally comfortable getting food from, good guidelines Honestly headlines saw March May. fact keeps repeated people we're nearly November shows there's hope idiots. Balls steel willing (or serious need money) one specific hospital? Live let live need credit strangers fighting mundane internet banality Well, new strategy current administration looks like gaslight everyone claim infections *good*. (And DeSantis batshit stupid.)

It's consistent deeply unethical, untenable, pseudoscientific theory supported fraction scientists think herd immunity reasonably obtained *letting* everyone get sick - except, somehow, magically, 60 risk factors. policy given. vague idea somehow putting elderly people isolation, something. 

It's kicking away order avoid responsibility massive humanitarian disaster Trump Covid response. I‚Äôm ‚Äúanarchist‚Äù I‚Äôm also trying support billionaires?  report it, can't catch ü§™ implication obvious.

Playing stupid obvious really playing, it? mean, losers suckers anyway

^/s we, 'Americans general.' like this? isn‚Äôt numbers game? doesn‚Äôt elected president ever want change numbers game? That's happens leaders take serious shit seriously. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Wear mask. People died every fucking night entirety man kind. Good lord must live place constant allergy hellhole. Everybody sus here. Actually economy barely forecast contract year pharmaceutical industry (one biggest industries) hope so. I‚Äôm really ready normalcy. ""Sexy singles area"" said nation loud clear March /April Massachusetts.. lot people mocked us. hit early responded.. suffering gave states BLUEPRINT suffer, overwhelmed. never life ashamed country year. Good luck Wisconsin, wish well.. working healthcare right awful I'm guessing Canadians mocking Americans reason Draining swamp like promised. covid counted, that‚Äôs headline. 

Excess deaths? person tested positive anytime life still count covid death. Simple. Whatever. They've less honest reporting months. surreal. Whenever consider human stupidity, remember double Texas Florida. already happened. So, kill several hundred thousand Americans keep several million American kids going food insecure (see below) arguably months, economic damage already done increasing spread offset improvement economy anyway? agree happen, US supply exponentially funding UK article/OPs comment highlights (1.3 billion US vs 88 million UK). entirely correct. literally tried kidnap governor murder cops audacity say ""please wear mask"".  point cut family. can't respect need stay healthy (and desire potentially infect them) deserve respect time. need added stress people willfully ignorant, belligerent it, life. downstate repeatedly ignored governor's orders screamed ""we're chiCagOOO!!!!"" 

well, happens. morons. Good bot nothing, seriously doubt Biden elected COVID goes away instantly. says mandate masks nationally....yeah right. Even did, much bureaucratic red tape resistance nobody comply whatever he's selling. No, props. could probably time. congratulate trying preserve workforce. either high-risk, high-risk chosen take vaccine. 

Yes. Ah, fatalism. basically saying:

*""Its end world, anything even make attempt avert it""* seems like joke didn‚Äôt land well, record want say way offended joke. Please don‚Äôt punish u/chrisms150! could use little humor time! I‚Äôve literally exact scenario family member coming something read COVID webMD, found particularly consoling weird way silly, end soon globally. never end US even vaccine out. work room without windows recycled air work site. wearing freaking mask whole reason work office full time full capacity long acknowledged high risk environment spread. Even pandemic, one got sick, got sick, flu made rounds among us last winter. want spend day ass refuses wear mask find tested positive 2 days later work go positive covid 19. Period. notice subreddit mostly doom gloom ""we need lock harder"" come daily discussion there's healthy amount rational discussion skepticism way we're handling things. reason disparagement? healthcare staff wear scrubs grocery store. see frequently everytime infuriating. never allowed happen again. they‚Äôrenon brink happening Europe, means could make way across pond soon could? Grammer nothing intelligence. mention 75% time phone autocorrects wrong spelling, half time dont proofread hit post.  work multi billion dollar fast food chain. dont take seriously, fuckers are. They're stressed gills. I'm friends regional losing mind lately. many changes new procedures. love quote ""I went school manage restaurants, never took class pandemic."" That's happened eliminate slavery, biblically-approved system labor management. know death effect COVID.. right..? consider grocery shopping relatively safe. brief. go non-crowded time. self-checkouts even come within 6 ft anyone touch stuff. Plus location near 100% mask compliance grocery. seen anyone maskless months. would comfortable social bubble people go grocery occasionally. Montana got first winter snow.

Scrubbing surfaces scrubbing it‚Äôs mess simple minded people Yeah :( suffering really breaks heart. corporations making billions bourgeoisie mouthpieces telling every one that... would suffering without restrictions? Honestly know 100s millions children compares hundreds thousands old people. Call old fashioned?

The ULTIMATE irony causing death virus. even virus 100 times deadly would still consider genocide innocent children. reaction news Bangkok Tokyo, epidemiologists Imperial College London released study estimating virus spreading beyond Chinese borders, 4,000 symptomatic people Wuhan.

It's asymptomatic transmission accepted 	‚ÄúEvery province China got infected within month [of Wuhan outbreak] [their official case counts] generally settled triple figures lockdowns harsh,‚Äù said Dr Fisher. ‚ÄúDiagnoses weren‚Äôt made everyone staying home. People mild cases probably spread couple people family also mild cases virus burnt out‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚ÄâWithin three four weeks able unlock things.

This assumption sounds like ""This flu"" comes from. Assuming 10% cases identified. would reduce mortality rate China reported (1%) flu (0.1%). Never mind lockdown alone stop coronavirus. Oh sherrr mean always empty gestures, oh medical staff dont enough PPE, low pay, overworked. Guess clap 7pm show heroes call essential workers nothing fundamentally help them. thing Vets, let us day stand ""support"" troops see insane sucide rates, mental health problems homelessness. yeah standing 1 min national anthem enough. show make feel better without actually anything. You‚Äôre getting downvoted, feel like correct. can‚Äôt totally shut us length time. mean one works stores supply chain? so, get trouble classifying ‚Äúessential‚Äù workers live? happens lockdown ends stores anywhere stocked multiple weeks?

If beginning isn‚Äôt ‚Äúa real lockdown‚Äù real lockdown actually look like you? He‚Äôs saying months. We‚Äôve also cases going months. really anything news, clickbait headline. taking away pen taking away first ammendment rights. Sweden 2 3 deaths per day,
They good! true Georgia country state. 20 states reaching new highs every day state new low 12 days ago 1000/day, +200 probables day. worth local article sure coming houston weird. Back April took stock non-perishables realized could make weeks without go store...meals would probably get little weird could it. Since we‚Äôve eaten frozen stuff cupboard things like noodles soups. told husband start grabbing extras non-perishables restock supply. feel good probably 4 weeks food needed...it would tuna packs frozen veggies week hunker necessary!  read recent article New Statesman(linked elsewhere sub) correctly, understand mean good experience people following recommendations. consider majority deaths due failure eldercare government translations minorities (whom work lot service professions) rather people following recommendations. 
  
I agree wording problematic clearer though. It‚Äôs negligent asymptotic don‚Äôt know virus. need national testing program. This, right here. president? thought child emperor. wear see-through mask days. Gotta enjoy looking smiles expressions. ""liked"" hospital workers. know can't see humor life.

I poking fun poster responded kind.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize assumption, correct. worldwide forum, respond such. totally get that. depends lifestyles &amp; locations in. speak &amp; act &amp; family. family already poor &amp; living rural. much changed us. fewer social obligations, money tighter, less, we'll make do. miss elder friends &amp; family, I'd never forgive got one sick. said, stay home. $15/hr $200 bonus? get wrong, that's great props Target, but... I'm sure it'll fully top 401k. ur gonna stop raw dogging strangers internet federal government understand this. run man doesn't, political party values loyalty leader else. different President power, they'd listen experts. different political party power, they'd remove president one listened experts found. 

The current situation came one man want listen anyone political party interested best followers. think Japanese wear them? used Spanish Flu decided liked aesthetic Reports, records  Sweden screw up? numbers look good Arguments like anti-maskers exist  I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs instances re-infection may mean it‚Äôs simple ‚Äògot I‚Äôm immune‚Äô virus. large number observers (including many sub) predicted thing, us called ""muddle-through,"" gradually declining compliance enthusiasm restrictions activity. none possible. seemed like obvious path on, remain on. decent incentives yes independent id like point out:

Charlottesville 


The MAGAbomber



Armed protesters Michigan showing storming state senate get haircuts play golf


Militants area recently getting arrested feds plotting kidnap Governor Whitmore 


Kyle Rittenhouse

... wasn‚Äôt. 
They minimal restrictions like 0.05% population died half care home 30% suffering dementia 

How failure constantly moving goalposts there‚Äôs mass graves collapse healthcare strategy sustainable long term. learned word show Boston legal lots Swedes skiing Italy, much bigger seed neighbouring countries clear lockdowns outcome would much better. Yes per capita people died northeast south. means either:

- less infections south, sucked treating it

- infections south, resulting deaths

In either case, suggesting south managing COVID better northeast. county awesome imposed mask mandate two months. Cases dropped, put #Responsible campaign dropped mask mandate 9/25.

Cases gone 500ish active time 950ish active time month. watch numbers creep every day. insane Aunty decided back measures taken UK worth people able live normally. sent propaganda grandma grandma starting question everything. apparently handful doctors/nurses decided live covid, people die, die, yet majority still saying need take seriously? According her, outliers listening to. grandma sent arguments come frustrating. One genuine arguments Asian countries like South Korea less harsh response lockdown lot better us, failing note everyone already wears masks matter course, slowed spread virus massively. put Aunty hurting anyone, I'm genuinely worried influencing 75+ frail grandparents. ""People die"" ""People dying"" always bad argument. [This Yeah that's happens robots socially forced rather market drive minimum wage Smart guy.. lol. GLOBAL pandemic continue? No, current restrictions asinine. Yeah, that's gets me, lack empathy fellow man.

I even imagine would feel, discovered infected passed people. amount deaths could end responsible huge.

But facing kinds people, stay strong, keep wearing masks, keep social distancing. what's right world, even people (wrongly) appreciate it.

Stay strong, people. still lockdowns circuit breakers?

I agree - painful watch, can't understand ball dropped many countries. Sadly, type thing puts fuel fire conspiracy theorists: ""if big deal, anyone anything? See! They're locking us control us"" True guess could say teachers, doctors, dentists, basically anyone obtains degree.  dad seat fully reclined guy's knees entire flight. could shoot coronavirus.

The problem also many people cold normal flu (for enough vaccines) also tested symptoms same.

Schools still open many people still requested go office company despite pleas government work home.

The mistakes made following:

* People allowed go vacation brought virus back summer

* Virologists ignored say government's decisions

* Contact tracing joke virus started spread

* Schools opened September many schools take proper measures.

* Restaurants bars remained open numbers rising.

Sums Americans. Thinking virus suddenly disappear, get mad restrictions idiocy first place.  


You never asked whether one brainwashed.

That speaks alot EQ, IQ.

In years, chapter history textbooks disinformation American government Coronavirus pandemic. Yeah, massively sue UK. would tut heavily inappropriate behaviour. 20% smarter 30% dumber world would 100% better. say dont boot transportation lock up, considered ""Bio-terrorists"" seeing refuse wear masks protect population. Treat like scum are, thats me. glad old windbag fucks off. Hmm, that's fair point. know /r/COVID19 little bit keeping things topic would great. seemingly hard people envision pulling mask down, taking bite whatever, putting back place? Certainly risk minimal, near zero. people places used them?

Serious question here, facetious. I'm Japan, wear time allergy season anyway, we're sick normally. constantly see people restaurants that: pull off, take bite, put back. annoying? suppose, already want wear one first place, bad. Yep, working farmers last month southwest KS one around even thinks Covid. guy working told (not joking) everyone school families already. asked meant tested said, 'nah, everyone's sick, we've point'.

Then later week lady working grain elevator got Covid, came back like 4 days later said felt better. There's distancing, masks, nobody even thinking more. think done completely overblown. Rural KS fucked areas end getting hit. small population numbers things keeping safe now, meetings, restaurants, bars, football games going (with supposed regulations, ones one follows), there's going lot small towns hit over. problem statement ""natural selection"" affecting others innocent, stupid people. Lol see there.

What odd coincidence. naive measurement.

You can't look many died virus.

Deliberately absurd proposal no: Let's kill everybody. optimal outcome since nobody died virus. measurement indicate people died virus compared neighbours (assuming strategy properly carried out)

This blatantly absurd obvious measuring successful approach complex counting many died. case also used deliberately absurd method handle pandemic, important thing absurd method *would work* given choice measurement.

What ever action take deal pandemic side effects. need consider side effects end cure worse disease.

Of course might remain unconvinced above, let's continue second problem measurement. fact simply can't know every factor affects spread pandemic. looking complex system interacting interdependent variables. Saying anything success particular method given simple measurement (number dead people) misses fact factors play besides hard lockdown chose.

It would work could make sure infect people.

AKA get 10 K young people isolated place somewhere, infect corona day 1 let 21 days later negative.

That way they'd get infect people.

Just keep till young people gotten infected it.

The way it, infecting everybody else, spreads virus. Well, experience ton people rural KS wear seatbelts either. least choice really affect others much like refusing wear mask does. Good bot. pretty much pattern Ezekiel Emmanuel predicted back March, would waves lockdown, reopening locking again.  restriction need people actually follow wearing freaking mask times necessary. alone, we'd much better per basically every study available. We're heading Winter, flu COVID season, need careful ever. Like not, we're pandemic. like not, vaccine release instantaneous magic bullet. Winter means holidays lots traveling ripe disaster. vaccines take decade develop fully safely, matter tests trials we've ran, real idea well going work scale. do, next year, need diligent, sacrifice, wear freaking mask. 

Do know Japan fine despite stringent lockdown measures compared rest world? commonplace, common courtesy, wear mask feeling well. built culture. big nuisance easy thing we've turned left right battle, science versus idiots. probably makes much sense GOP. Prepare bill re-banning CBD. Yep nothing happened *yet*, think proves never will? What's like living lala land?

I've heard, baseball weird anyway. confirm, I'm Uber Eats guy. nobody talking suicides overdoses shot roof last 8 months live NYC partner nurse busy hospital Brooklyn. confirm, hardest saddest week life. grew Nola watching hurricane Katrina destroy home city TV 8th grade. argument makes sense. larger population alone meaningless, unless arguing average person US contact different individuals average person Singapore? highly doubt that.

Yes, arguing that. Bigger populations = super-spreaders. ultimately people spread viruses most, people interacting small social argument vacuous. factors posited would make pandemic worse Sweden *much more* prevalent New York:

We're comparing Stockholm New York since different cities, would like comparing apples oranges. even able scratch surface comparing - need take many factors account. Comparing Scandinavian countries easier since they're similar. point even they're similar they're identical, taking differences account vital going compare properly.

This one-size fits all. can't decide one variable (size immigrant community) impacts spread compare immigrant sizes different countries point blank. immigrant % *indicator* specifically *within societies*, side-effects *in community* (such overcrowding, multi-generational households, translation issues, sometimes lack trust authorities culture specific immigrant groups) - **those** things impact spread. never look one variable alone either.

Many people also tendency pick two cities compare provide favourable results (confirmation bias), assume correlation = causation. mistake done masks, saying East Asia uses masks good numbers means masks = low numbers. That's science works, that's typical mistake confusing correlation causation. What's needed truly compare countries thorough see trend varying degrees almost every country went early lockdown versus ones didn't, namely Sweden. outright dismiss trend choosing bury head sand reality lockdowns help getting outbreak control quickly.

What even mean? entire point flattening curve overload healthcare, Sweden's case aim create sustainable long-term plan hope overload healthcare even ups downs vaccine arrives. know quarantines used contain disease, yes, costs too. there's nothing really imply Sweden's case amount would looked different locked like Denmark did. Norway less strict lockdowns fewer excess deaths Denmark. Why? factors play here, easy comparing B point-blank.

Sweden whether locked would still huge death count amongst elderly spread people essential jobs - paid-by-the-hour employees low income security worked one nursing home would dared stay home sick. failure elderly care system would existed regardless. fact workers also predominantly low-income immigrant-heavy suburbs hotspots outbreak also explains spread elderly homes. That's really bad luck. right beginning pandemic, Sweden locking prevented this.

So again, trying oversimplify complicated give examples lockdowns making things worse then.

Aside mental health issues increases poverty poverty-related (and obesity-related) illnesses? increases abuse/malnutrition children kept school (not mention impacting future negatively)?

Not mention fact proven spread outdoors barely ever happens, indoors dangerous. ideal certain countries made people cram together home like sardines (therefore lessening overall health Vitamin levels - something shown promise helping COVID-19), time banning outdoors taking walks park ""essential"" (this longer done, countries beginning).

Not mention forces not-tiny part human population always ignore rules/recommendations, ""forced"" get together socialize indoors instead rather outdoors, therefore increasing risk spread. Accepting reality always people ignore rules pragmatic, actions people needs taken account determining strategy. plan strategy ideal world everyone acts 100% correctly time. realize people wearing masks, social distancing, washing hands ever, right? Yeah, measures work. absolutely predicted.

That isn‚Äôt main argument though, all.

So, what‚Äôs point posting useless links? Worldwide Smallpox, wtf headache absolutely awful. I'm glad got mine god damn prepared go home instead work. embarrassing leave! Safe, ok. Effective? saying? LMAO Fuck maskers.

All sacrifice lockdown turned shit.

Fuck all, hope everyone fucking die point. Indeed. Mitigation could successful could protect elderly surged among young. Evidence date can't (or perhaps trying). Nonetheless fixed case count, younger cases better. Bonus: pleasant make someone fresh breath lol. farmers let crops rot. Restaurants closed buyers. Government could've subsidized crops used subsidized food provide basic meals. screening, first point contact, outside contractor. State employees building tested.

When pandemic started refused test people called sick visited key locations - tested confirmed positive infections new locations could added list. 

They're concerned appearance preventing disease. trusted numbers we're given while, negative deaths? They're retroactively removing numbers likely classify covid deaths correctly. Worth pointing leading expert Dr. Osterholm (CIDRAP) correct March bold vocal airborne certainty, warned months Nov/Dec horror, also months (a) warned masks likely protective uptake virus [savvy science surveyors already know this, fact almost guidance face coverings rooted source emission reduction] (b) expressed grave concern folks mistakenly believe protected virus uptake wearing face coverings therefore behave misguided, over-exposing manner, potentially making matters worse.

Please, point direction reputable source says going end everything NEXT YEAR, like suggested. Right, that's point - line allows soapbox judge others, OK even though living safely either?  guess 5% positive tests?  state-wide county?  someone Wisconsin go restaurants dine-in, friends' back yards shopping grocery stores? better them? heroes disrespecting them

This everything. military, teachers, police, etc. love pageantry throwing celebrations ""heroes"" make feel good actually *doing anything* people roles. live one states need valid excuse vote mail Covid risk isn‚Äôt valid excuse. Early voting opened they‚Äôre reporting minimum hour-long lines many places far. looking forward it. dunno, says seemingly wild shit sometimes Last year, bunch kids died flu. died got virus chain transmission throughout society, absolutely nobody blamed shamed made feel bad it. Everyone accepted fluke occurrence, virus gonna virus, life, etc. social contract around infectious diseases.

But now, changed. Suddenly, way around. I'm responsible everyone else around me, responsible turn. reasoning, everyone wearing mask nazi grandma killer preferably thrown jail anarcho-capitalist extreme.  pretend represent mainstream free markets capitalism.

If want try convince people extreme take economics, fine, expect anyone else buy bullshit. seem correlate anecdotal evidence scientific evidence that's dangerous conclusion. 

Let's wait see Danish scientific study reveals. always wear mask crowded places I'm open-minded enough hear results study without bias. looked everyday week London 14-17 degrees. even going higher 0 week here. :( Stay safe Canada support troops black lives matter same, wanna look like good people could really care less Strange find video's nurses scrubs protesting street twerking find people collapsing hospital waiting rooms dying overflowing patients.  favorite metal band cut pay shortly too.

Wife works hospital Wisconsin one co-workers tested positive. Since co-worker can't ""prove"" transmitted contagious patient, they're denying quarantine pay 2 weeks. Oh, they're denying request PTO well. 
 
This employee health scolded getting test *on dime* outside work hours concerned. Fuckin ridiculous. signs affection

Yeah people support dystopian hellscape lot calling for. Texas schools : must...

Texas teachers : fuck you. Training?

It requires lot discipline doff PPE properly, day day out. are. company brought everyone back office beginning month feels like someone would die us get sent back work home someone lost loved one, saying them, well, government mess up, unnecessary, father could alive, mother could alive, grandmother could alive, that's untrue. frankly, mean.

Governor Cuomo U.K. clap üëè week get pay cuts agree replies. 

Also, outside Madison Milwaukee areas, first wave. state wide plan governor lockdown stages reopening repealed right plan place months back. nothing statewide mask mandate people pointed also contention. Closest thing take bladestorm. Even worse: locking down, obvious lockdown's working people this/have become aware risks chosen balance caution liberties, locking again. AKA Ireland.

You might well tell beatings continue morale improves. never 2016. Kemp stole Georgia, Scott let Florida hacked securing voting machines.

I dont think things improved since then.

It's going take Texas going Democrat believe Trump win again. We're aiming herd immunity vaccine feels like dude protecting could die it. Like people even get fever thing doubt that- people dumb enough turn ""wear mask protect people"" political issue, they'll gladly give everyone COVID get TV 100 bucks. Yeah Karen wear damn mask people need hear message sounds like teacher Peanuts. They'll take seriously directly affects them. older brother goes time refuses wear mask, claiming isn‚Äôt ‚Äúafraid Kung-Flu‚Äù. don‚Äôt know reason people like this. isn‚Äôt good justification. They‚Äôre enrolling young, healthy individuals giving minimal doses SARS-CoV-2, it‚Äôs going overestimate vaccine effectiveness also telling us anything effectiveness higher-risk individuals. unless we‚Äôre willing throw vaccine safety long-term robustness window, we‚Äôll *still* need Phase 3 trial sample size time frame before. time saved, sample size saved unless try use extremely unrepresentative study push skip Phase 3. let guess, 10 years old. Except seem eradicated virus locally China. may brutal undemocratic methods it‚Äôs hard debate effectiveness seems EXTREMELY hard hide outbreak pool parties clubs open. Hahahahaha haha Wisconsin heavy lockdowns?  mean age death? 70? want people able make money themselves, that‚Äôs support right small businesses operate. works assumption vaccines exist protect individual community.

It entirely wrong since vaccines *do* protect individual, vaccines rarely ever 100% effective. supposed though, enough people take vaccine, get herd immunity. risk people take vaccine, herd immunity happen we're going end thing.

That said, society go normal despite that. Oh definitely. Tons bars restaurants near live shut down...places forever probably replaced national chain over. fair, claim won‚Äôt end 2022. said vaccine beginning end pandemic ‚Äî everything completely normal soon vaccine comes out. Also, certain I‚Äôd call CNBC Baltimore Sun credible sources I‚Äôll give read. Thanks linking. aware regulatory body imposes restrictions industry, fact setting prices? may explicitly say ""you must pay $500 car"", say ""you must include 2 airbags"" airbags cost $250 each, indirectly they've set price $500 higher. rocket extreme definition, ZERO free markets anywhere

Of course government always wants complete control everything. omnipotent though reach total. Black markets unregulated, definition - ignoring regulations, black markets anymore. statement simply true. can't fathom anyone could anything without government's permission. voluntary interaction government keeps nose of, anarchy. government still exists. never able instill sanity population unless somehow diminish power right wing media machine. Finally! I‚Äôm NE rural WI literally come say stuff. state sort microchasm rural counties around country, gonna multi year project getting Right....older people WAY risk...so discriminate based age.. 

Anyone die. likely die though China confirmed live covid frozen food Yes, people talk creeping fascism places, look lockdowns see fascism staring square face. allowed go 5km home? idea free citizens Western democracy would tolerate thing even worst dictatorships time haven‚Äôt enacted. Oh, ends justify means, guess....... think right, like everyone says deaths lag, lower infection rates. think read somewhere 20 million people could qualify front line workers. Even got vaccinated first day, would still take couple months effect felt like people going get infected next day prevented.

The good part vaccinations start, they'll keep going effect felt strongly every subsequent day. Good every post Sweden threads always removed really make feel better discount humanity 70+ year olds risk. really problem, I'm younger grandparents already dead. aunt undergoing cancer treatment, friend sickle cell disease, cousin's kids raised grandmother could die ... I'm sure mind going partying like everything normal. would never want sacrifice something important Wearing clothing that‚Äôs either come straight infectious hospital going one huge contaminant risk. Walmart Home Depot superspreader centers. mean, kick vaccine hopes pants too? reacted better almost information 90% countries - vast amount information available, mostly ignore miss change something stupid lol.

The virus Europe, yet kept sending people ski holidays places scientists KNEW virus, infected half Europe like that. fucking dumb that? Maybe it‚Äôs time stop fragile. We‚Äôve become accustomed getting want constantly unable function even little degree discomfort. much misinformation propaganda article, insane! Funnily enough, mention help governments gave citizens...  concluding paragraphs:

 

Still, researchers might never sufficient data justify ivermectin‚Äôs use widespread administration continues Latin America. drug‚Äôs popularity ‚Äúpractically cancels‚Äù possibility carrying phase III clinical trials, require thousands participants ‚Äî would part control group therefore couldn‚Äôt receive drug ‚Äî firmly establish safety efficacy, says Krolewiecki.

Tbh things normal spring us make sacrifice skip holidays anyways difference don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs epic gamer moment like doubling step, numbers half be. Masks make cheeks itchy .

I look around state (no, I'm saying one) honestly everyone best appropriate precautions getting along life. everything perfect? No, calls lockdowns answer. took 4-5 months thing start one guy China become worldwide pandemic. long exists world, thinking hide houses couple months everything fine pure fantasy. looking vaccines, approving emergency use. Big fucking difference. sure EU follow proper procedures clinical trials approval. President power that. blatantly unconstitutional would struck minutes. Oh believe me, annoying anti-maskers I‚Äôve met actual, real nurses. It‚Äôs horrifying. know that. comment add anything discussion. subverts main idea. 

Just like ""not cops..."" ""not men..."" took long break place followed crazy people here. probably missed good too. nursing home, 1 year live average without COVID. come places die. ""We need stop saying 'avoid \_\_\_\_ like plague', because, turns out, that."" Indeed Except it‚Äôs people already passed reproductive age dies. 

No Darwinism play here... Yes, literally not. pen.

You tried avoid civilized debate, pull megaphone starting shouting you, would response go get megaphone? rules can't use megaphone first place? agree end sick. may even symptoms yet they're spreading around. I'd rather live world wear mask go outside never ease restaurant ever again. True, go away right away, least Biden, much greater chance national plan thing. survivor, think time. caught early March spent 38 days Hospital (16 days ICU Ventilator). 

I'm thankful every day (for long list reasons).. especially medical Staff Rehab etc helped guide back full health. 

The biggest repayment give responsible health, exercising, eating right spreading word. Covid-19 Minecraft? another conspiracy trying link Bill Gates Microsoft Covid? mean like dumbass governers ? Tbh always felt like fighting fear mongering States** already secured almost third AstraZeneca's one billion possible COVID-19 vaccine doses **pledging $1.2 billion promised vaccine doses every American Operation Warp Speed plan, multi-agency collaboration led US Health Human Services, aims accelerating development manufacturing medical countermeasures COVID-19 delivering 300 million doses effective vaccine January **the UK contributed ¬£84 million** towards vaccine, per report. Boris Johnson also secured 100 million doses, Britain could left behind US regulators give go-ahead first.

I realize US paid much money toward Ox vax development North South Dakota would like word. getting crushed right covid way red proud anything it. denialism wanna party lmao way military treated. ""We appreciate hero's go die."" I've read plenty people blaming China (and WHO) preventing flights country. I'm sure seen arguments made. seen either paying attention straight lying. 

Why think travel US say, Vietnam, China, New Zealand right matter? virus well controlled places US global hotspot. Countries around world knew virus severity confirmed mid-January. team dedicated doctors look round clock treatments available regular people. fair, folks like Racheal Maddow showing footage like longest time, recently summer. Hope still that. Oh god thought radical parents side bad seems worse somehow  consider fear mongering? currently 225,000 dead Americans virus. That‚Äôs fear mongering, that‚Äôs reality. info right main page, there‚Äôs excuse COVID denialism sub. Came douchy predictable. Comment. Thanks disappointing me. nurses low paid. People start taking coronavirus seriously leaders start taking coronavirus seriously. Thee never clear present danger public health Trump administration. Vote OUT! Ope. Tell folks says hi. Umm.... Death easy part. overwhelmed living. covid deniers would die homes problem.  Classic psychosomatic symptoms. PTSD, essentially. less real symptoms, hasten add. Yeah even founding fathers believed that, make mention 50% population. US population: 382,000,000

Covid deaths: 220,000

382,000,000 / 220,000 = 0.00057591623

I sorry actually 10 times smaller Someone still work there. residents die quickly take care them. Good luck finding temporary replacement COVID infested job site short notice.  Wississippi resident here. confirm. state GOP lost lawsuit yesterday trying strike Democratic governor's mask mandate.

Yeah. YESTERDAY. 

The GOP state awful, even judging GOP standards. gerrymandered us shit back we're at. Sicker, poorer, weaker. hate GOP white hot fire one thousand suns.  I‚Äôve part clapping balcony every night 7:30.

Economy still collapsed hard neighbours, cases neighbours, larger per death anyone, first wave lasted longer, took way longer get control, lost control quickly, etc. 


I go day every way Swedish approach failed, main problem Swedes need drop ego learn wrong.  point people allowed fight die. get working vaccine good luck can't waste hospital space. Problem solved. Life precious. go play. Finding people work nursing homes hard enough is. finding new employees right thing do, easy sounds 13 56 times surprising might think. defence Peruvians Argentineans, besides irresponsible people, also happens many cases big chunks populations work informal economy, day day income much room (both figurative literally ) follow safety guidelines, without access state benefits funds, since work informal economy. That's I'm thinking. 

What happened workplace almost perfectly indicative know virus. 13 people, 4 asymptomatic (the 2 youngest staff 2 middle aged healthy, including me), 2 severe cases (both eldest, mid/late fifties), rest running spectrum uncomfortable fucking miserable. 

Mercifully, one staff super high risk dying covid. 0.0057% chance dying disease

Stop spreading misinformation. death rate COVID-19 *far* higher 0.0057%. know it. &amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

they stopped whole fucking program 40 MILLION doses administered.

In 1976 small increased risk serious neurological disorder called [Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome following vaccination swine flu increased risk approximately **1 additional case GBS every 100,000 people got swine flu vaccine.** 40 million people vaccinated swine flu, federal health officials decided possibility association GBS vaccine, however small, **necessitated stopping immunization** issue could explored. I'm hosting one drinking getting tested hand masking shoes weird. course worked, that's never hear pandemic many hospitalizations result many covid deaths? overwhelming hospitals. think bothered read anything past headline. Go back read article pay attention numbers hospital beds talking about. Round 2 getting started.

Canada, could get losing hockey fight. *massive* insult. Wild animals belong cages. weird younger people getting covid good? weird older people getting covid good?

just ""worse"" older people catch virus, mean good younger people catching.

you're weird. Yes, every day 30k people die hunger around World (6 times covid) - already predicted least 450 million people around World fall extreme poverty it. Using solutions cause huge economic crisis end cause way much damage covid (and even super clear effective - examples countries like Argentina Per√∫ locked long time big effect, Sweden less followed similar pattern European countries lock down).
There success stories course like Taiwan, New Zealand China, either isolated countries shut borders early case China huge police apparatus enforce pretty draconian rules, stage probably late look anyhow (virus widespread effectively contact trace get effect closing borders) say nothing intelligence, shows certain amount thought went piece text.

You realize inaction non-science based response rest world, right?

If countries acted NZ successful countries did, something completely feasible practical, would 'exception rule', saying goes.

The economy still bad Covid still control, lockdowns ended months ago. movie theaters reopen August closed nobody going. long people don‚Äôt feel safe, virus keeps spreading causality list keeps growing, economy good shape.

How people live fantasy land? virus gone away own? number patients ICU Wisconsin, according state's data 200 rising 800 rising hospitalized. death rate according Johns Hopkins climbing since low mid-September tripled since then.

How many would like see dead take seriously? complaint sloppy journalism surrounding COVID, negatively impacts ability average person understand topic. It‚Äôs important people access accurate information, science-illiterate journalists butcher studies (or likely parrot people‚Äôs bad interpretations research) renders impossible. hit bus, too. went festival... part problem. Absolutely free markets quickly become filled first movers gatekeepers shore position collude others within market root exclude competition. free market ""free"" 1 nanosecond. Markets always regulated, government businesses within, businesses within little incentive friendly competition consumers.

Many major government regulations place due really shitty behavior corporations past. ton precedents shitty behavior, worship corporate overlords invisible hand infallible deciders quality fairness. Plenty examples contrary. headline sensationalized. People die every day almost every state US around world covid. 

I would rather know deaths population basis, age condition people dying, patients underlying issues forth. masks social distancing rules swine flu. also 40 million laboratory-diagnostically confirmed cases, however certain every disease true number cases exceeds that.

Furthermore, swine flu variant flu knew treat less start susceptible neuraminidase inhibitors. 

This case Sars-CoV2. far deadly (swine flu death laboratory-diagnostically confirmed cases: 18.5k, Lancet published study later estimate 150 575k deaths) already twice six times number deaths alone Covid-19. key difference 1+ million deaths laboratory-diagnostically confirmed. Again, true number deaths exceeds that. 

What want say swine flu incredibly contagious. Lots lots cases well documented (due estimated range 700 million 1.4 billion cases). Sars-CoV2 even effective spreading unchecked. R0 value swine flu/H1N1 around 1.4/1.5, Sars-CoV2 around 3.3-3.8 unchecked. Well give us 2 unique ways make changes it, foresight. We're reddit discussing that. ""THIS UNCONSTITUTIONAL WONT WESR DAMN MASK!!! IM SCARED VIRUS""

Okay, go lick public door handle.

I DONT WANT GET SICK

............ wholeheartedly agree. comments focused flights, thing many people take best times, public transit, thing many people still taking daily!  numbers article seem match stated source. I'm sure difference lies. shows Iowa rolling average around 21% I've found studies used anti-maskers actually say masks work, describe improperly used. Rather pass advisories like, ""change mask often"", ""distance even mask"" ""cover nose"", becomes part conspiracy narrative. Lol 4 people me. us concerned bout covid v responsible. thought pull it. 

Thx though That's trials chosen. They're chosen areas high infection. Trials focus Europe. Makes sense trial virus summer Europe infections low. good, think 700. hospitals lot time prepare. ready, would horrible use resources. would mean lot illness suffering. point bring R0 1 virus eventually peter out. R0 \~1.5 that's bad exponential growth, mask \~20% effective vaccine \~20% effective R0 got 1 really don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs leveled 2-3K 80-100 deaths day No, it‚Äôs facts. think exponential growth cases deaths good thing heading flu season, well doesn‚Äôt make sense. Where‚Äôs news coverage ‚Äúoutpouring grief‚Äù outlets spent huge amounts time covering back 9-11? 10x deaths EVERY MONTH. Feel like media least culpable governments downplaying. significant percentage population, either breeding culture, idiots. don‚Äôt to. quit. go work place take seriously - nurse hiring gangbusters. commute car (used nbd). reason change clock like 7 mins shift. go early remember clock in, get badge violation. clock early, get badge violation. really dont time change work. work, spent twelve terrible hours getting ass kicked (figuratively, usually) patients, families, providers, management, PCTs. I'm pretty damn sore tired, want go home. change shoes that's get are, grew county either go Marshfield Clinic Wausau basically health needs people especially serious.

Yep every single one us cowering fear parents basements worshippers beloved commander chief. look twitter feed every day determine level fear. No, cant living fear assessed risk levels looking data, great president told us feel. Pay attention post histories demonstrate we've left years.

You've figured everything beliefs reading one reddit comment. wish perceptive you. Welcome internet Ahh, gotcha. Well shit, then. definitely take patients hospitals. So, bed utilization counts include counties.

The infection rate likely accurate county. feeder hospitals least intake stabilize patients. They'll send Wausau critical needs can't handled locally. miss 220,000 fellow citizens coffins? become political issue many politicians want give Trump credit fast tracking vaccine through. vaccine ends pandemic faster. Given things like civil unrest food insecurity third world, faster ends better. Fortunately scientific consensus side sooner! Lol described US system bad allows tens thousands Americans die year. get it: profits humans.

The Military service loses hundreds billions year. Healthcare same. Oh grow up. toxic attitude far ""holier-than-thou"" bull spout. Deaths lag cases. Don‚Äôt want hear champ society, label someone hero essentially saying sacrificial. 

Soldiers heros, send desert die. Supermarket employees heros, shut fuck risk health minimum wage job. you? Yeah.. remember watching TV Covid-ward (after getting ICU). News saying average Vent-stay 1 week even that, 80% people make it. 

So 16 days quite .. uh.. amazing turn around (I hate using word ""miracle""). know credit except Doctors Nurses body fighting back. Pretty crazy 16 days ""ICU Deliriums"".. 

Not something I'd prefer go ;) Yeah us don‚Äôt go party. Speaks volumes priorities are. Oh yeah, no, they're open, come on, DUP going budge that. Gotta get evangelicals warehouse looking churches! Wow, that‚Äôs pretty bleak situation. Hunker careful there. sucks. live security guard let grocery store without mask. also monitor capacity, there's usually socially distanced line get in, store never crowded many people inside once. Gotta say appreciate precautions they've taken Yea fuck off. two kids 3 stuck inside 24/7 opposite easy, especially state two hot go outside summer.  seem like Swedens politicians certain officials health agencies trying keep public image voters, working well.

These decision made politically independent agencies Sweden [ministerial illegal Sweden. people experts pandemics handling pandemics, guy good rhetorical skills public full idiots elected. seem like good person. trickling down!! time go swing dancing, matter ""over it"" are.

No shit. Finding single partner similarly pristine downstream risks ""going swing dancing."" That's whole point. 

Unsure one wants hear that. personally don‚Äôt agree mandates like either. I‚Äôm gonna kidnap politician. I‚Äôm gonna most, grumpy it. people‚Äôs kids. Good lord.    vaccine approval beginning end pandemic. That‚Äôs wide sweeping claim ‚Äî feel free look information coming experts, scientists, Pfizer, Moderna... quite easy find using simple google search :)

It‚Äôs shitty year. It‚Äôs OK cautiously optimistic. I‚Äôm newly reformed doom gloomer, lol, nurse person risk group I‚Äôve always taken virus pretty seriously. Come dark side, join cautious optimism! proposing solution help that's going take 1-2 years instead giving aid, mobilized months?? arguing false premise. trade-off asking kill several hundred thousand Americans keep several million American kids going food insecure (see below) arguably months, economic damage already done increasing spread offset improvement economy anyway. Thats prolonging suffering fail provide aid killing hundreds thousands marginal improvement next 1-2 That‚Äôs weird way saying N95 mask reduces cough cloud 95.6% surgical mask reduces 85.7%.  Basically masks work advertised. Capital runs US UK. care people die long make money. Oh [have seen Read actual verge report. 

They received $237 Million dollars WI taxpayers already.. 281 jobs. one building turned warehouse. still getting support WI GOP Trump move forward. feel like there's large disconnect showing people dying, bodies piling up, front line medical works broken exhausted people brought in. Perhaps, media dealing horrors genocide, Vietnam War, Auschwitz more. Perhaps many Trumpian anti-maskers, better yet, Trump go hospital that's overwhelmed covid cases preach 'It's bad' motto front live news crew. can't even handle information may catch virus, attitude towards humanity prove much debilitating. sincerest condolences. Communist dictatorship least one advantage societies freedoms comes limiting spread infectious diseases? least two factors play: one tracking people already two severe penalties following rules, however arbitrary disruptive. Verge yesterday released [massive goes excruciating detail much massive clusterfuck deal inception. people Wisconsin apparently fucked *decades* much money state lost continue lose. function essence phrase always best translated as: ""stop criticizing wars.""  fear misread. said much agree most, right that's enough. selflessly, selfishly either.

I'm sure praise searching for, especially ""bubble"" potentially 30 people, get giant pile shit.

But personally, thanks one giant piles shit. Really. appreciate it.

Probably let bare minimum respecting emergency guidelines go head, though. Kinda hard [the state Supreme Court literally countermands emergency public health Enjoy summer remember happened Northern Hemisphere weather changed. Hopefully science offers solutions then. Okay, remind come vaccine. Still waiting!! first interim analysis vaccine's efficacy happen 53 people entire study get symptomatic Covid-19. significantly fewer vaccinated people unvaccinated people among 53 cases, company may deem results sufficient seek government authorization wider use.

Literally nothing proven even studied humans yet, yet headline talks like vaccine already created, redditors usually read article leads ""Yah vaccine Boyz!!!"" Imagine state sued mask mandate GOP complaining people taking seriously. course they're GOP playing games actual human lives. Yes! media disservice showing true horrors.

no, media trying get sued fucking oblivion violating HIPA. Anit fucking truth!! mean, think okay ""that guy"" raging pandemic personally think parties completely begin with, maybe depends person they're living. area fairly responsible successful friends family similarly cautious. prioritize safety community still manage socialize within restraints. 

You're right possible environment heavily influencing usage. frustrating see people refusing compromise shred normalcy sake safety even experts pushing heavily safety. one says socialize. say take appropriate precautions socialize. boggles mind people would prefer throw away essentially precautions. guess we're poorly we'll living far longer places. people arnt Covid skeptics know disease ~.5% IFR average age death ~80 might worth shutting world always send poor? know saying: going complete panic vaccines work promised.

You chill out. already evident vaccine needed contain virus, medical treatments continue improve.  stuck head vaccine-or-perish, clearly isn't. sobering thought. think, could many vote ,but support someone like Trump. makes think country great always thought was... sad. hope best Social media mistake ......unless look act like us. it‚Äôs like shitting pants face. 

The problem there‚Äôs consequences pulling mask.

About shit car whip pants off? Well mess car.

Pull mask sneeze? problem...the whole thing hoax anyway.

Edit: read cough brain saw sneeze. thing, guess coughing might like peeing pants Dude, halting basically in-person social interaction ""a little discomfort."" realize comment may misconstrued; live California isolating distancing wearing mask whole time. cannot tell 7-month absolute nightmare idiocy misinformation made depressed, anxious, angry. Terrible exactly *needs* **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**.

In many ways doesn‚Äôt go far enough however, often even people wear masks wrongly. fault own. happens. reason task force specialists monitor masks worn correctly. spread communities work.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. obviously includes anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

Their children perhaps slightly less conspicuous symbol masks ‚Äî something identify real risk result raised enemies society science.

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people ‚Äúenemies‚Äù progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. task force mentioned easily adopted work. individuals employed federal government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress.

Obviously people willingly violate new mask law separated society ‚Äî good society, well good. dealt humanely fairly. like Nazis. individuals simply separated families society moved safe place time being. perfectly humane fair. safe places seek educate evil ways harm world. re-educated returned society. course repeat offenders dealt little harshly. 

But benefit. Eventually individuals proven menace society danger security state, permanently removed. done humanely, key done good collective whole. system really space individualism. selfish attitude exactly got us trouble first place.

So selfish activity controlled aspects society, especially economic realm. Individuals allowed hoard cash. progressive tax policy course help redistributed, aid less fortunate. cash hoarding outlawed, banks reason exist. probably done away first. People run banks identified enemies state placed camps see error ways returned society. course allowed enter advantageous position, somewhere near base, reduced manual tasks help greater good. Needless say also special insignia masks identifies part dangerous class individuals.

Business owners stripes receive treatment managers banks. course understanding welcome opportunity make amends society. However will, protection, removed society.

There measures taken vis-a-vis bourgeoisie brought much pain unto country. tackled later.

**The important thing 100% fucking law leave house without wearing mask.**

Frankly require wearing even home even you‚Äôre alone. simply strictly outlawed public. Anybody caught flaunting important rule dealt harshly. Penalties enough. Imprisonment, indefinite period (at least year, five even ten years) first time offenders. exceptions, appeals. Second-time offenders sent top secret camps permanently. camps degenerates repeat violators laws. security reasons limits small group security professionals special clearance. Red Cross international organizations allowed anywhere near premises. make sure harmful individuals kept sight mind. fair, correct, proper measures taken people willfully go public without masks. lefty idiots. know. Righties lefties complete fucking idiots: reddit shows us every day. Please show anything linked remotely supports claims made. Blindly linking CDC doesn‚Äôt mean anything.

And followed full convo I‚Äôve linked plenty studies. Please don‚Äôt ignorant. ""this public health emergency, hell yeah we're national mask mandate. Fuck freedom.""

Italian swim team‚Äôs preparations Tokyo Olympics crisis 10 athletes testing positive novel coronavirus.

The Italian Swimming Federation says world champions Simona Quadarella Gabriele Detti among contracted COVID-19 high-altitude training camp Livigno Italian Alps. Olympic champion Federica Pellegrini already home isolation testing positive last week.

The total number swimmers national team test positive least 13.

The others are: Federico Burdisso, Martina Rita Caramignoli, Marco De Tullio, Stefano Di Cola, Sara Gailli, Edoardo Giorgetti, Matteo Lamberti, Alessio Proietti Colonna, Simone Sabbioni Alice Mizzau.

The federation says swimmers asymptomatic staff members tested positive.

The training camp suspended team placed quarantine. Literally one virus. work New York City everyone thinks it‚Äôs hoax. Hospitals empty. Please use brain stop cowering people rule Democrats? know actual anarchists hate Dems right? Jesus holy God. thing stopping anytime soon.. *are* trolling probably trying waste time fatiguing lost job due pandemic extra energy waste.

I've asking question flu since pandemic cause one actually gave shit influenza knew deaths.

Maybe 30,000 acceptable everyone else me. would happy wear mask public 6 weeks bad flu season whatever number health department decides suggest it, since literally takes effort. trolling wrong person I've already interested influenza mitigation. H1N1 2012 awful


Mask mandates problematic people constantly sue use courts decide state government actually issue mandate half time struck down, addition government health officials receiving death threats harassment, one high profile kidnapping plot. People big babies.

I trust scientists make call, I'll follow whatever recommend. want save life one child ask us wear masks 4 weeks save idgaf, works me.


I'm glad pandemic normalizing mask wearing people like want avoid getting spreading influenza looked social pariahs wearing mask. big social cost, people terrified store mask February. literally ran away cause abnormal.

We also need prepared influenza pandemic that's coming next. Yeah. That's definitely going happen. Hopefully trial run allow us mask earlier instead confused 6 weeks wearing masks dem states. Love leave it! = turn brain whatever say, criticism ineffective people take schools, offices, bars, restaurants private gatherings. Please show peer reviewed study.  create closed group? That‚Äôs last spring. essentially quarantined together separate houses. 7 months lockdown counting, we're still square one. Absolutely nothing changed.

This utter failure, would plainly evident too, animalistic fear death blocking activating couple neurons neocortex allowed work home? mean issues labor owners companies centuries long detailed antagonism. whole notion work family, friendly workplace nice PR, actuality, important ability generate profits. 

Global pandemic get long term changes body fully understood yet? problem! keep working, can‚Äôt let fear overcome us, even means permanent scaring ! boss needs new sports car. Perspective everything. grandma found depression fun childhood young know poor was. I'm clapping corona. shit outplaying us. like difficult, commitment undeniable. Life expectancy lower back due much higher infant mortality rate. little blue bubble happen La Crosse area? Went school there. mentioned UW towns post, someone else brought Eau Claire said handling better surrounding areas too. Nah that‚Äôs myth.

So summarize support system costs worse results ends killing tens thousands people wealthy people money. 40% people 35 statistic seem right whe 33% American adults age obese. people marching guns BLM protest they'd immediately shot arrested cops.

Why people say lmao

We've *seen* happen we've *seen* get shot. upvoted reddit bunch 17 year olds like ""Hmmm, yeah right"". Indeed. give shit diverse long intelligent pragmatic. literally matter color person comes idea long good one. two scientists pic look high fuck lol Nope, sorry! Wonder vet starts testing rats ?  


This thing going get interesting live alone? 300k already died US take excess deaths account. take least 6 months get vaccine enough people optimistic case.

If vaccine improvement strategy would likely futher 300k deaths 6-7 month period US. 

If reduce figure 70% get 90k deaths.

Since likely follow optimistic case, 100k deaths basically calling nothing. CHAZ again? apart China, NZ, SK etc obviously Ummmmm kidding? it. wont room hundreds people test, like room hundreds people election. sad, feel you. I'm guess. i'm terribly missing anyone particular, seen many folk last 8 months, I'm finding relaxing more. letting child play neighborhood kids, accepting invites get togethers outside ... need buckle again. Yes, true general, really case. there's also South Korea, Australia, Japan, Slovakia, Norway, Finland, Taiwan, Singapore, New Zealand, Hong Kong forth. least developed nations going grain. Ironically probably less, people average younger healthier, vulnerable/aging demographics covid disproportionately affects would smaller without modern healthcare.

It's effect we've seen subsaharan africa countries hardly even notice there's pandemic average age populations 17. fox sinclair's new affiliate - dead toddlers tierras lucky allowed so.

(Sorry, Italians, vi voglio tanto bene lo stesso.) read wrote, also friends outside. warning specifically referencing indoor gatherings. 

People going get together groups indoor Thanksgiving dinners next month hospitals going suffer it. hope I‚Äôm wrong, course. 

I‚Äôm much person calling lockdowns. think schools open clearly prioritized bars. people rational here. Getting together indoor groups masking distancing aren‚Äôt possible bad idea, full stop. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre arbiter phrase ‚Äòcertain death‚Äô means? arrive 8 million? line you‚Äôve drawn? 7.5 million die without lockdown, avoid one? Again, point? amount death okay you? 

There hyperbole lying tell statistics many people dead, share news hospital capacity. quite literally think it‚Äôs it‚Äôs hyperbole care 220k dead, I‚Äôm sure else view stance.  Thank service...

Thoughts prayers...

I‚Äôm sick it. Well considering DOJ investigating certain someone politically interfering work scientists ensure vaccine ""safe,"" sure. need - good line came ring fenced contact tracing getting people supported isolation. Well, government could provided support citizens chose to, spent time downplaying actually trying respond it. going important generalize trend northern hemisphere. Social mobility much higher, viral measures taken lightly. Another reason flu season--a lot flu patients put presumptive covids. testing severely limited, fog-of-war scenario primary respiratory pathogen going presumptive. mom currently ICU due COVID. would allow taped shown everyone meant one else feel I‚Äôm feeling right now. isn‚Äôt true. fact less deaths US pandemic past 10 yrs. 

People die everyday general. heck less deaths Covid Covid suppose increasing deaths? percentage people infected die? Oh less 2.5% Wait! That‚Äôs less flu?!?!?! 

Nurse = propaganda = antiTrump  never closed schools. don‚Äôt wear masks. they've taken extraordinary measures far beyond typical cold flu season. Sweden banned public gatherings events 50 people back March. Universities schools age 16 closed summer. Lots businesses implemented recommended response working remotely possible. People heeded need social distancing public health guidelines. Life far business usual there. Hey that's morbid, funny! What's adding up? According studies cloth masks, they've shown increase infection risks. studies prove mask efficacy include fabric masks. peer reviewed RCT show fabric efficacy. Would like sources want side cloth mask science deniers? wearing correctly though? biggest denier know told couple weeks ago ""I thought heat would take care it"".  reply was, ""maybe did"". yep Taze well goes show extant rot America. But, equal others. course, far better we're instead ignoring problem leaving everyone fend themselves.

I'll tell what: put Facebook post looking dance partners got 20 likes found someone dance with. work home, neither us comorbidities, lives younger school age son, live alone. 

I think people reacted well pretty clinical risk profile &amp; appetite. Risk stratification wrongthink. 

The resolution shall named, feels like hit job, pretty explicit separating folks out. pushback ""It's possible"" hotels apartments sit empty. 

SMH OMG translation error made much sense :D making shit me? I'm bringing jacket umbrella case moron. Covid give intelligence morals, far recent research seems suggest say would like flipping switch there's reason hundreds thousands Americans dead counting there's 35 deaths Vietnam.

Like deliver food people's doors free ffs. Nah we'd rather dump food euthanize livestock. Solutions exist except profitable owners die instead. That‚Äôs funny New Zealand did. Vietnam double digit deaths. restrictions actually work people smart enough follow them. Meanwhile delivery arm, Shipt, slashed workers pay. saw order day TWO shops deliveries, paid whopping $6. .....and even year. 

Look timeline pandemics. last multiple years. COVID-19 even around 1 year top 15. Right restrictions 25km limit radius, retail still closed can't people (unless they're part single/intimate partner bubble) catch outdoors people another household (max 10 group). 

During longest stretch lockdown (stage 4), 5km limit radius, social bubble allowed one hour day. think safe say restrictions relatively lighter now. 

We may getting restrictions lifted weekend well think safe say conspiracy theorists wrong :) Born raised Wisconsin, Madison home 10 years week ago moved Denver. speaking brief experience, everyone seems way respect care versus even Madison (though find mask wearing pretty good too). Totally recommend moving somewhere better (and legal weed ;)) can, wonderful! Good luck. arguing that? Diverse intelligent thought exclusive. 6000 12000 beds, definately 6000 12000 nurses. Moreover, critical care patients much different needs stable ""med-surg"" patients. That's kicker. double capacity window dressing, tough spot comes staffing, especially critical care. think companies pay minimum wage, prisoner get prison. kids spouse grandparents whatever tap pay. Otherwise get (with interest) get out.

It gets rid financial incentive put people prison, employ prisoners instead workers. ""reward,"" people going prison. Heck, could even see money tapped bit towards prison food bedding/clothing, would capped well regulated. 

In US sherrifs get keep whatever portion jail meal budget spend (as in, pocket personally, get budget). imagine sort food people get jails. Clinical depression runs mine, feel you. I'm almost 30 know degree it, less immediate family (which pretty thankful for)

My occasional swings can't get bed whole day really gotten worse quarantining. 

I wish society could show little compassion people like woman, instead making us vs thing. stupid shitty life together months ago called 60 therapists got 1 call backs.

I've tested 3 4 times insanely easy. people LA need take tests often. scientific/medical community us huge disservice telling people Jan/Feb/Mar masks effective.  gave politicians cover needed propagate BS. extrapolate existing data.


Also, multiple exposures virus since whole pandemic started nothing happened me. even gotten positive test. covid contagious 48 72 hours show symptoms. also extremely infectious easy imagine staff member catching spreading many spread many symptoms appeared. driving WI last week; stopped Dells solely gas bathroom break place stopped signs requiring masks, staff inside didn‚Äôt masks correctly, guests entering leaving restrooms masks all. didn‚Äôt child ready wet pants would‚Äôve gone somewhere else. far worst state drove managing masks. couple people passing outside issue. Large crowds though little risky say. know dude. proper lockdown? fill gas tank 3 months. proper lockdown before, sure hell nobody wants one now. feel like idea ""proper lockdown"" lives far off, ethereal place never cross paths reality.  issue employees *who tested positive* forced work. First wave* WI GOP Sued remove mask mandate. Took away gov powers. They've 10 deaths age 20-29 March going ""normal,"" generally free fair election, I'd agree you. going that. 

95% chance shitstain cronies steal successfully. holidays guarnteed suck. people think wearing mask sign weakness also think wearing bulletproof vest sign strength courage.

I guess they've conceded can't stop bullet 'tough enough', stop virus? time election. live SE Virginia. *Everyone* wearing masks, except one random white guy Wawa everyone else glaring daggers whole damn time.

Masks fucking work, period.  shooting daggers solve situation? SICK employees shouldn‚Äôt forced work.

2) Also tested lot used condoms found things inside could get people pregnant - therefore put condom inside anybody want get pregnant.

Unfortunately, see lot attention-seekers trolls making argument 1. I'm going assume hope argument 2 less common. they're troll, better directing attention towards them. They're best simply blocked unacknowledged. sad know Trump knew severity coronavirus January intelligence officials. know Trump's 'we got this' type attitude got us here. ""All men created equal"" local media it, international media too. There's reason article exists. Yeah that's problem. way see people need arrested biological warfare. mean, all. logic mind blowingly dumb. Masks proven reduce chances getting Covid. drivers direct correlation automobile deaths.

Fuck covid-19. think kind people deny virus exists going go get booster shots every months country public healthcare? add up, we're still long haul. And, somehow, got general public understand that.

We *do* understand though; there's growing resistance lockdowns/restrictions. going away, temporary measures like claim, rinse repeat moving goal posts actual *goal* people's lives put hold livelihoods evaporate. too.

Do live apartment shared air? Dude I'm SE Wisconsin Madison Milwaukee every bar town open staff members wearing masks. reads like article straight 8 months ago; fuck still here? lung portion removal makes questions lack masking. somewhat less comfortable stand wearing mask? important alternative cover like PAPR lungs already somewhat screwed?

Basic math. people still treat like numbers game smh FDA EMA submissions inspections biotech companies.

It's loophole intended. prison sentence included forced labor considered cruel unusual, considered slavery. idea text 13th amendment banned practice nobody wrote ratified 13th amendment thought ban misplaced. day prison workers huge amount work pennies day. know US huge prison population.

Unless prove actually commit crime, they're reason. war drugs blame Americans say (think boomers) still support widespread criminalization drugs. oringally alot race days crotchety old people think ""the pot"" legal. 

Also, many states allow practice forced labor still huge prison populations, would contrary generalization. 99.99% means 1 10,000 die. 99% would 1/100. accurate known estimate like 99.5% (1/200) It‚Äôs like ‚Äûdon‚Äôt Party Bus lane!‚Äú

Simple logic says R0 4, 75% R drop 1 herd immunity reached (though may still coast higher final prevalence). estimates R0 spring high 11. heterogeneous method infection likely means herd immunity point lower, idea much lower.

I'm tired hearing people say well pandemic fatigue want go back living normally. us get back, lost job permanently nobody worth working hiring right much risk. wearing mask living normally anyway. reduction 70% seems obvious me. source showing actual reduction would interested seeing it.

In fact, promising sources claims werent you? give youre it. car breaks take mechanic, mayor local newscaster.

Disclaimer, epidemiologist, grad student studying mathematics similar used epidemiology. Shut fuck wear mask. pandemic gonna reach proportions thing left would us isolate room scratch walls. said number cases Sweden quite low second wave. lets look per capita cases 2nd wave Europe moment.

Fauci: U.S. ""two weeks away rapid surge"" coronavirus cases statement was: vaccine development distribution take years. absolutely factual. opinion - literally scientific fact.

Your'e obviously right COVID vaccine development moving significantly faster normal vaccine sheer scale development efforts - huge number competitors trying find vaccine, removal/streamlining usually slow steps (eg. multi-year trials), blurring steps (eg. starting Step 4 Step 3 finished), etc. NYT article linked goes good detail that, series super interesting interactive graphs great visualizing shrinking timeline actually looks like. 

As noted comment, NYT article notes accelerated timeline COVID vaccine -roughly 18 months - would fastest history. worth noting 'almost there' mean 'almost population'. means almost ready enter review potentially distributed sometime future. IIRC either AstraZeneca Pfizer said end November potential window vaccine ready review, would amazing. However, rolling vaccine getting general population would take far longer. 

In case unclear...my opinion not: ""it's time face reality: ease restrictions forget vaccine never come!"" opinion is: ""telling people stay isolated human contact widely available vaccine unrealistic irresponsible, ultimately know access vaccine, effective vaccine be, whether need boosters/multiple doses."" presumption unconditional freedom uniquely Texan. American. maybe playing report tennis. asymptomatic. like protesters U.S. calling draconian lockdowns, whining months. COULD SEEN COMING??? Lmao always week away. people think credibility left? question mask efficacy subreddit. credibility sources claims bear consideration questions efficacy masks. boat. holidays fun. thought people getting reinfected 4 months Weekly rapid tests 25% population literally would get anywhere near working. Even 100% testing fails shitty people (throwing COVID parties continuing positive tests) Sweden bigger Scandinavian countries, densely populated cities Scandinavian countries, far greater foreign-born population Scandinavian countries (a known risk group, vastly overrepresented cases countries).

Not mention fact Swedish holidays 2020 predated ones Scandinavian countries, meaning Sweden likely got greater spread virus begin with. Stockholm one biggest travel hubs region, unsurprisingly big outbreak centre region. 

Let's also forget fact Sweden unusually mild flu season 2019, higher death rate amongst elderly 2020 expected. top iceberg. countries identical, controlled experiment. 

Your mistake comparing countries point-blank ignoring dozens ways countries differ 100's interacting variables determine spread. unscientific, basically picking choosing basic data confirm biases.

There's reason many people say it'll take years truly get understanding different countries COVID-19 responses - studying variables making sense takes time. something get answer comparing out-of-context numbers matter might wish it. ""People dying every night""

Really, Sherlock? want ""Control"" result instead ""Cloth mask"" result, need wear medical mask 30% time. think everyone grasping hope beat covid masks social distancing naive.

Just sayin. got bus morning completely forgot wash hands.

Masks be-all, end-all! 

Just today showed orientation job signs everywhere saying social distance, yet wanted us sit elbow-to-elbow! Why? think masks 100% effective! BULLSHIT. wear mask wash hands use hand sanitizer mostly, SOCIAL DISTANCE. WAY many instances lately people think wear mask stand ass! NO! WRONG! GET AWAY ME. nice man ! I've also cut drinking alcohol fatty foods pandemic body ngineered shave munchies ! (xcept ice cream blue) whole point vaccinating at-risk people healthcare workers reduce actual death rate move lives disease. 70% mean 70% people die. means terms immune response, 70% immune response body. considering low death rate, actual death count much lower. blows fucking mind almost 6-8 months later we‚Äôre still making 0 progress towards beating virus states. Sorry family help vaccines approved U.S. yet. one likely approved U. S.. companies done first strongly tied Europe.   Nurse here:

I used PLEAD people early days. public legitimately KNOW thing was. felt awful poor souls landed ICU. victims.

*This message brought sponsors, Burnout, Compassion Fatigue Mild PTSD* I‚Äôll argue lockdowns actually anti-progressive widen wealth inequality within US across world realize interpretation actually worse, right? said ""all men created equal"" insist including women that, they're lying even people equal included males. Either way, good look them. Saw post yesterday, it‚Äôs true.
After finally beat virus, every nurse country, many others, going strike BIG TIME. Although adviseable, wish Big Brother-esque reality show showcases realtime hospital scenarios make people aware really happening ICU and/or ERs (with patients‚Äô faces blurred out, course). hoaxers need slap-in-your-face reality check. think that's bad news SinoVac 

It's actually great news misconception. point phase 3 efficacy, safety. give people vaccine wait people exposed virus evaluate effective is. certain number people exposed, look data. FDA also requiring median 2 months safety data phase 3, primary point phase 3 efficacy. oh, stop it, r/COVID19 


(just kidding, always call bad studies) ""you're"" generic ""you're"", specified towards particular.

My comment ""Ah yes exactly HIV become less damaging past 40 years"" directed comment ""the less damaging variant gets dominant."" 

If anyone going claim general principle viruses less damaging variant gets dominant, one back up, specify - ie COVID-19 less damaging variety becomes dominant, Coronaviruses less damaging variety becomes dominant, Single Stranded RNA viruses, less damaging varient becomes dominant, etc. Thank God. least getting paid somewhere closer worth risk lives shit. Exactly. Sweden common consensus FHM really dropped ball elderly care high immigrant areas, lot preventive measures could done. otherwise FHM fairly high support general strategy. Yes, Vietnam also acted super early, quarantining whole areas soon found first cases (this possible politically West early, back January February anyone taking virus seriously labelled crazy conspiracy theorist, chance politician close borders quarantine whole regions still chance working). Using Vietnam approach virus widespread longer feasible, would basically mean total lockdowns everywhere (if close specific villages/towns bring food outside everyone inside locked, continent-wide lockdown need make lots exceptions essential workers means lockdown effective. mentions liberal democracies much less effective enforcing draconian measures police states) 
Also climate probably something it. exceptions like Brazil biggest deadly outbreaks areas around 10-15 degrees (Celsius) - Europe pandemy almost receded summer coming back force temperatures started drop. Vietnam indeed quite proactive fighting disease, countries like Thailand Indonesia anything different many European countries did, yet spread virus relatively limited there

Not mention Cambodia 
beginning acting like actively trying spread virus country (prime minister letting one covid cruises shaking hands everybody show there's nothing fear of, allowing many Chinese China still hotbed disease etc)

There's also case Japan theory bad situation (oldest population World, super densely populated cities, similar climate Europe, one earliest spreads outside China, following typical recommendations - hardly test anyone, shut anything - even want cancel Olympics late, thing really masks) - yet affected mildly.

And Southern American countries many cases implementing super strict measures yet much effect.

So think easy say exactly countries well bad. correct say - Vietnam/Taiwan fine Americans concerned Covid deaths generally Americans believe universal healthcare. could infected RaTG13 act ""pasage"", giving ability infect humans easier union? ensure health safety? enough, obviously. Maybe time change. hear local Facebook comments death rate low like less 2% die cares. don‚Äôt get   Literally heard someone say ‚Äúwhy nurses pretending heroes. Theyre not!‚Äù Yup. People naturally selfish. That's way is. people Reddit point Vietnam China shining examples things run would screaming bloody murder actually live governments. fair, two Nordic countries, Finland Norway bit better Sweden moment. two, Denmark Iceland worse. Iceland lot worse. :-( Thanks reply. appears fat fingered original question deleted going edit question, obviously need learn controls better Reddit browser client. 

Anyway, actually disagree lot saying. think always reasoned approach look things objectively try glean reality multiple sources. relate anything history, daily news. registered Independent, think neither party comes close answers. tend fall right-of-center certain topics, left others.  friends different political philosophies multiple topics too, never understand people comfortable aligning one. also try demonize people, make sure understand positions make cogent responses. 

When younger used conspiracies, read books like Behold Pale Horse William Cooper, listening Art Bell show every Sunday evening. found started focusing reading history conspiracies became less interesting reality things seemed even worse, cases substantive real lessons learn proven abuse performed people governments, etc. 

While give credibility Pizza Gate Q Anon conspiracies, still think bad things happening children everywhere society want root address. knew guy worked law enforcement software based around issues stories would make toes curl. concern conspiracies like get way substantive issues hyper focused addressing times. Like say, need believe either know bad things still happening want address things fast possible, whenever can. 

Anyway, initial curiosity born interest lost 2 uncles Covid months ago. older got retirement home. 2 friends getting destroyed month. hyper distance runners, little shocked impacted harshly. Statistically mortality numbers area seem coming down, staying infection rate. know hospitalizations ICU, we'll see continues. Hopefully mortality trend continues see parallel course two.

I appreciate thought detailed response. often engage online, always appreciate two people reasonable discussion things agree disagree on. 

Now, stock tips? Daddy needs new AMG GTR :) comment reminds friend says light cigarettes matches heard matches toxic chemicals. ""no shit"" realization. YET Americans, thinking pandemic revolves around them.

Health Minister Salvador Illa today confirmed possibility studied, stressed would require support regions opposition parties PP.

Madrid - 20 OCT 2020 - 15:14 CEST

The Spanish government considering introducing nighttime curfew across whole country, bid bring coronavirus infections. executive believes, however, would need state alarm given option would give legal framework limit fundamental right movement way.

The possibility confirmed Tuesday Health Minister Salvador Illa Socialist Party (PSOE), pointed fact European countries considering curfews. political discussion restriction arrived today, however, Madrid regional government ‚Äì headed conservative Popular Party (PP) coalition Ciudadanos (Citizens), propped far-right Vox ‚Äì made clear morning open curfew region, particularly badly hit pandemic second wave.

Sources central government said today would go ahead country-wide curfew agreement among Spain‚Äôs regions ‚Äì which, like Madrid, led PP. part, Illa today stated reporters move would imminent, studied.
-

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important know PP would willing give support this,‚Äù Illa said reference state alarm curfew, speaking press conference weekly Cabinet meeting. ‚ÄúA decision made. evaluated studied. made, important know political position PP.‚Äù minister added discussions party issue.

Illa warned ‚Äúvery tough weeks coming,‚Äù regard pandemic Spain, called fresh support parties. ‚ÄúIf going,‚Äù said, reference curfew, ‚Äúwe need state alarm want know willing support me.‚Äù

Article 116 Spanish Constitution describes three legal categories emergency situations: state alarm, state emergency state siege (in Spanish: estado de alarma, estado de excepci√≥n estado de sitio). first situation implemented Spanish government outset health crisis March, paving way one strictest coronavirus lockdowns world.
-

The government implement state alarm ‚Äì spring, earlier month Madrid region ‚Äì needs support Spain‚Äôs lower house parliament, Congress Deputies, extend it. March, government ‚Äì center-left coalition headed Socialist Party, junior partner Unidas Podemos ‚Äì found support opposition state alarm. backing ebbed away crisis deepened, emergency situation eventually lifted June became clear executive ‚Äì lacks working majority Congress ‚Äì would support needed prolong further.

The political challenges face government terms curfew similar. Madrid regional government said open curfew, want state alarm. government believes possible. One option request citizens remain home midnight 6am, actual curfew, police powers enforce rules, would necessitate state alarm, government sources insist.

Illa also confirmed Tuesday central government would renew state alarm Madrid, due expire Saturday. central government still unaware exactly PP-led regional administration Madrid weekend bid contain second wave coronavirus. morning, region‚Äôs health chief floated option curfew, returning previous raft measures confined residents 45 basic healthcare areas ‚Äì administrative divisions contain one healthcare centers. literally headline time thing changing state know people won‚Äôt take vaccine actually make difference. Vaccines approved use based review. finish clinical trials not. Taiwan shut borders even flights chinas wuhan region. force everyone quarantine track every single contact difficult Europe due free movement privacy rights. apotheosis ridiculous Milanese corporate-speak. love much hate it. Fine, guess I‚Äôll put mask Yeah, kinda like call teachers nurses first responders heroes; easier give people lip service, tell they're amazing use political talking points pay well actually treat like matter. old soccer players ventilators.

Seems haven‚Äôt really learned anything we. Well, systematic burning libraries

Yeah, except no, really. Again, drinking ton propaganda. Catholic Church worse organized religious group time.

They burn libraries. purported burning library Alexandria fictitious - seriously, look - great burning due religious intolerance. simply put real thing, really happen. position essentially non-Catholic monasteries

Source? time think sacks cities - *default* behavior **everyone** world time. city surrender, taken siege, standard 3 days sacking it. common across cultures - Catholic world, Orthodox world, Islamic world (c.f. Mehmet II's conquest Constantinople), etc.

Now, **did** see increase religiously motivated attacks reformation, tended happen religiously divided areas (think similar partisan divides modern day) tended perpetrated Protestants Catholics.

Before see occasional bit religious violence, none really stand exceptional compared similar cultures similar geographic areas. Middle Ages (and early Renaissance) brutal time, Catholic world particularly brutish, sacred sites centuries

Again, aside isolated incidents (like Charlemagne Saxons), can't really think happening often. rate higher comparable nearby excommunication and/or persecution long list notable scientists, philosophers, various free-thinkers Europe even centuries

Again, overblown. saying great - par course geographically nearby cultures. could killed heresy apostasy Orthodox, Islamic eventually Protestant world easily. really stopped west 30 years war (which essentially destroyed Germany century) Europe, Protestant Catholic collectively said, ""religious violence stupid"" became massively secular.

Galileo really put house arrest expressed beliefs contrary Pope did, put house arrest wrote book character called ""Simplicio"" (equivalent, essentially, Simpleton) put Pope's **exact** words said character's mouth. I'm saying pissing Pope good reason go jail rest life, publicly insulting extremely powerful ruler 17th century? That's pretty much going par course, light sentence. that's pretty much universal. idea free press infancy time period. That's Catholic thing, that's humanity thing.

The vast majority scientists excommunicated persecuted. again, straight myth.

Think many thinkers 1000 1650 (when religious violence pretty much ended Europe):

Rene Descartes, Tycho Brahe, Nicholas Copernicus, Roger Bacon, Da Vinci, Hildegard Bingen, Albertus Magnus

What great thinkers persecuted? we've got Galileo - I've pointed really dumb thing insulted Pope directly. Anyone else?

The one think Giordano Bruno, burned scientific ideas his, due religious views had. I'm defending action all, far tell, fairly isolated incident. Executions heresy common. tick 1500 1650 so, Giordano unfortunately around absolute worst part period religious violence.

I want clear - saying Catholic Church perfect - pre-modern institution, means incredibly brutal modern sensibilities. particularly **more** brutal contemporaries mention modern-day stance things like evolution fetal development 

The Catholic Church never expressed position contrary evolution, ever. issued one support 1950.

I agree beliefs fetal development stupid based 19th century pseudo-science.

So again, point Catholic Church perfect - I'm freaking atheist god's sake, I'm definitely making argument - argument particularly brutal cultures consistent contact with. huge preserver knowledge 500 CE 1500 CE, reformed themselves, they've terrible organization - want point out, still disagree substantially on, atheist, fairly liberal.

You've blown argument. economically sustainable lock down. 

It's viable *not* lock down. get right? How's business going go half million dead customers? million? guess took snapshot current situation, numbers change people exposed.

Influenza viruses survive long outside hosts viruses, particularly covid, spread far hosts speaking, coughing, sneezing warmer environments summer. top that, much people residual immunity towards influenza viruses due infected previous strains, well availability flu shots breaking chains transmission.

Covid contagious, survive longer outside host, brand new virus people little immunity towards. completely resonate need socialize. absolutely do, too! That's choose wear masks times meet outside possible. need sacrifice safety measures social. ways significantly minimize risks associated socialization. reason choose wear mask social situations? really minimal ask provides lot protection around you. know unethical doctors/nurses would never this, maybe made psa saying start running beds find intentionally flaunted social distancing guidelines, treat you. Scare people acting smart. Damn, get it. Yes this! far 70% replies contain insults. 

I wear mask. wash hands. You‚Äôll find something personal. Here, I‚Äôm overweight, usually helps people - don‚Äôt try namecalling?

Do anything add good ideas based common sense common ground. Anything. K-A-R-S, Kars 4 Kids! town hospital closest live. Covid spreading like crazy large amount people respect others comes masks. Disinformation masks going around since day 1 people resent governor actually trying mask mandate. Nothing's enforced bars wide open. city's school district opening Nov. 2 going get worse. used proud town pandemic really made realize awful dense people be. Whenever get covid, since seems guaranteed point, hope underlying conditions kill me. Nearly 90% capacity? normal? seems bad. yesterday 36 people died Covid-19, seems growing exponentially.

Imagine full BOAST know Generals, Doctors, Scientists SCIENCE .... FFS carrot asking people nicely kindly wear mask prevent spreading virus family friends. 

The stick family friends catch virus die. care about, say, Islamist terrorism heard World Trade Center attacks news? goddamn bizarre kind gotcha, somehow caring things learn sign hypocrisy. see. anything goes narrative you‚Äôve fallen crap. yet ‚Äúwe must listen science‚Äù argument hear. Well, he‚Äôs Dr science. 

And emotional argument doubtful best. may know people MULTIPLE health issues. Per CDC true number CoVID deaths 6% recorded number. means it‚Äôs highly unlikely 1500ish people know multiple died solely CoVID. 

These people would died flu result susceptibility see.

By definition, involves reduction standards justified urgency.

The way speed approval process extent cut corners.  reasons vaccines require years testing. TB took time gave infected time settle affairs come terms fate

Gave time spread another person too. shot aid background looking facepalm-ish really sells article... didn‚Äôt answer questions.
Bu lack argument, Who‚Äôs conspirator here?

Again, i‚Äôm denying virus. answer questions referring topic... answer isn‚Äôt needed. reading UN website - indeed concerned economic food security say anything specific restrictions blame, ""the covid-19 crisis"". also appear stand suppressing transmission key. missing?

Is comment China somehow wrong? China's approach getting virus control first appears working wonderfully black white maybe call political. Claiming choice saving grandma saving children, between, feel bad calling political hyperbole, that's is. hope lottery system like Contagion.  would exciting. Yea....... hemp legal crop production except state level legalized Farm Bill 2018. Also, trying stump me, smart knew anything. CBD legal 2018 derived imported hemp, AKA Canada. similar tobacco Cuba always legal, purchase final end product. 


Also, fuck spice research chemicals, that's result failed war drugs. can't compare Delta 8 THC also legal Farm Bill, derived imported hemp. one thought time. go. Stop helping them. Darwinism taking care it. I'm kinda starting like idea, smart people stay inside, dumb people get wiped virus. Balance :D 


I know horrific, making light devalue it, help people cope. understand statistics realize wrong are? believe country/government cut regulations vaccine safety. ""the hysteria real"" says man hysterics asked care people muh cough needs FREEDUM!!! standpoint commonly touched surfaces large amounts sweat? *A virus cause infection goes away 14 days infect nose picker.*

The chinese whistleblowers said million chinese infected already January west still infected syncope presenting symptom Covid19. Let's try save lives see goes, guys really stop trying *ally* pandemic make political gain, making look (even more) bad. There's also much community immunity Influenza due people immunities previous strains well flu shots.

Not mention 60% people infected influenza asymptomatic/ mild infections cold-like flu like. There‚Äôs literally nothing fallacious one argument comparisons better made comparable countries.

You‚Äôre comparing apples mustangs bud. solution keep doing? going change govt day (or ever opinion, seems designed like that). support local businesses employ people. She‚Äôs nurse operating average optimal capacity hospitals sub believe negative info find lmao They've given emergency small number individuals. Thats approval. Chinas able contain outbreak better country world thousands brilliant chemists biologists reason doubt vaccine development I'm conspiracy theorist. Really fucking cognitive dissonance going sub there? that's huge wall text anti-social asshole

 antisocial:

contrary laws customs society; devoid antagonistic sociable instincts practices. 
""a dangerous, unprincipled, antisocial type man"" Quick math? Quick? Ive checked poat history youve making claim least 3 times past four days.

Thats mistake due ""quick math"". Thats innumerate larping software developer. somehow still worse America You‚Äôre acting like one either atm little bro lol Donald Trump US, lot supporter base believe virus real, real threat, believe wearing masks, etc. polarizingly politicized mask wearing actively FIGHT wear masks, order keep everyone around safe. America Country gonna dumbed hard another 4 years moron, RUINING YOU. hell lot need sounding loud alarm bells right now, you, Country gonna take long time recover political mental damage Trump caused last 4 years. fucking piece shit turning people one another clue would able get vaccinated. I‚Äôm sure anyone answer it‚Äôs vaccine approved. father‚Äôs age, preexisting conditions, place higher risk group. ""conspiracy"" Trump administration openly talking it?

And pharma company saying flat going sell ever gives green light first. Talk blackmail. Yes. Study study proven masks work significantly reduce transmission. They're perfect, one public health measure is, including vaccine. would personally take risk I'd rather work outside home anyways, given state economy, see reason shut gyms require enforce mask use. safer anywhere everyone covers snotholes. say implied otherwise? want shut businesses employ families need money. nations 100s millions starving bc people consuming investing like before. That's hate oppressive restrictions. go back normal - there‚Äôs evidence suggest won‚Äôt melodrama. certainly need take precautions, develop vaccine, give probably twice long anticipated us develop immunity, there‚Äôs reason believe 5 10 years time won‚Äôt back normal. also tens millions working class baby boomers verge retirement best interest mind. 

Housing market, stock market, investments tumble, even short period, couple years away going lives unable to. 

I can't count number people parent age (59-63) can't stand trump scared shitless may happen personal timeline Biden wins. 

People scoff 'silent majority'... sadly something this. important young people get vote. think went DJ Trump he'd slightly endearing Yep. point? Nobody safe. First targets vulnerable immune systems, turn mutates target rest. way current Phase 3 trials run, think way knowing whether vaccine recipients exposed become contagious ill enough show symptoms. demonstrate vaccines effective preventing severe disease challenge trial test viral replication shedding would worthwhile IMHO. lot easier monitor 100 people 15000. Video call dinner time. Hmm would rather see decline bit thank you. That's reddit you. Reddit hates america choose get it, cares? get vaccine, people refuse get don‚Äôt matter. That‚Äôs issue I‚Äôm going back normal life. going keep wasting youth people especially vulnerable worse conditions and/or death older people. don‚Äôt want get vaccine, think we‚Äôve done then. ICUs first come first serve. perfectly ok deny ICU bed 85 yo even still free beds. reasonable hospital 85 yo covid get bed time surge even free beds. REAL man.  Good him.  men sacrifice like women children lives. 
Sad thing men days willing this- actively things endanger women children lives- like sending kids school/daycare wives work.  
If man think way- humanity favor get sterilized. Please remove gene pool. go look study yourself, here‚Äôs Cheers thanks  Public service messages shift grim. Make stomach turn. Every time get ""you're lucky job"" makes want scream. 

Words empty platitudes. person commute deal COVID lab work every day. Wow weaponized stupidly. Smallpox polio natural selection decided let neighbors die preventable diseases. 

Natural selection mechanism behind biological diversity justification inaction plague. What's new trend studies say stuff like, ""7 23 times likely""?

I read one morning cigar smokers ""4 12 times"" higher chance getting throat cancer, one day used ""8 20 times"" likely breast cancer study.

This isn't, never appropriate way report study results, suddenly sort irresponsible reporting seems widespread blessing. Yea poutine overrated. know multiple people died COVID, idiot. send link looks like partisan blog targeting hicks live middle nowhere know anyone. real covid death counts excess deaths year year. Dewine limp dick piece shit fly work last week, first time since Covid hit. moron 4 rows ahead reminded keep mask on. takeoff refused keep taxi back escorted arrested. exit plane re-board... get (for safety reasons). 

His actions royally screwed schedule day - come dude, agree wear mask even check-in flight. Screaming ""Land Free"" even make sense private transportation. Idiot. Ouch Freedumbs rights listen scientists. disgusting virtue signaling imaginable. get fake caring others nothing supporting policies cause millions children starve. 

So average r/coronavirus user, ask this, would cut dominant hand cure 82 year old's cancer (I'll add never never met never meet person)? non dominant hand? 

Children literally starving death policies extend lives already way 2 3 years. can't genuinely answer yes question, moral high ground think do. Hi Torrent! Gee that‚Äôs surprising! Kansas: state tried kill teaching evolution schools twice 20 years. bars go drive past regularly costume parties year. Never Canada I‚Äôve heard, life‚Äôs pretty similar here, except we‚Äôre less cold, don‚Äôt serve Poutine Maccas ""He'll listen scientists,"" Trump said Biden maverick Biden confirmed Twitter. Vote! It‚Äôs pretense deal hypocrisy. Like rapid tests taking daily White House. According another thread, it‚Äôs almost half staff, still asked work. Challenge trials nothing new, discussion (particularly UK, whatever reason) months. guess convinced higher ups OK. noted China military personnel regularly, COVID. Without permission, obviously.

If math, chances someone demographic catching serious case -- particularly vaccine provides even little benefit -- tiny. Basically level car-crash-driving-London-to-Glasgow. Instead killing people, virus made peoples dick turn pink purple polka dots, alot people would regularly wear masks. wish didn‚Äôt stupid shit like call pot stores essential infrastructure workers stay home üòÇüòÇ Yes know. mention regards study posted link to. current path sacrifice close 1 million Ireland would like word you. They're pretty much joining Melbourne. Sad, it? agree CDC. recent experience: returned Memphis Orlando Frontier airlines. Walking airports announcements keep mask times. 

At gate Frontier announced must wear mask times.  Failure comply travel canceled escorted airline. also temperature checks. Vented mask banned. wearing vented mask provide another mask. happy Frontier's approach. 

I disturbed packed plane was. flying Orlando Friday, many children. Families vacationing Disney. WTF!?!? parents noticed monitoring children using hand sanitizer. 

People complying social distancing sitting gates waiting board. move family 5 sat directly across me. mother pulled mask talk family sitting behind them. kids preteen early teen took mask off. Everyone chatting away. got shock, moved. 

There one walking around airport enforce rules. Rant over. well that's weird. flu shot isnt stored/transported -100\* temperature. don't. feel sorry poor people take care selfish idiots die. could kill without hurting anyone else would encouraging it, cheering on, even. world needs fewer people like them. Unfortunately, there's lot collateral damage. smart bot. Context political. Yep idea limit spread clusters. someone got sick stayed 5km bubble, easier contain. it‚Äôs upped 25km stop everyone city gathering hot spots. sounds like terrible idea likely lead deaths Californians wait additional round regulatory review FDA approval.

you speak State California full luddites, cutting edge, internationally recognized, medical research facilities. 

UCLA MED

UCSF necessarily mean qualified review pre-clinical data, toxicology, manufacturing/CMC/QA data. much clinical trial experience academics even have? much regulatory experience have? Approving drug vaccine goes way beyond reviewing journal article. understand data integrity? ensure human ethics preserved trial conduct? going perform site audits clinical trial sites around world make sure data real validated like FDA would similarly audit?

the thing need look vax University California doctors going take. hoax bros Yes better alive food stuck box alone free 0.0057% chance dying disease Maybe weather makes corona spread easily places? 

The people indoors, spread get seems. Now, maybe, lot others home stay-at-home orders (including boyfriend--library manufacturing/shipping). think even virus significantly worse fatality rate, would done thing low-paid workers, usually health insurance ability afford level healthcare. Yes us knew months ago wish people would realise impactful consequences death. Maybe death rate slow, stats serious implications. Exactly. type person stuff need locked away saying stories video coming NYC start this. people don‚Äôt learn unless something happens them. clear outlier. people mentally capable severe isolation like that, privileged enough able so. Right, here. go without mask, period. Better safe sorry; especially knowing people passing closely lot, even outside. Omg virtuous Supreme Court even corrupt SCOTUS What? That‚Äôs true all. hospital philly suburb 120 Covid case one time April. 9 right Yep Trump holding super-spreader rally events help push top. fucked. President still wearing masks got it. saying nation afraid even though literally got best doctors treatment possible. Something average person NEVER get LoL. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre Wisconsin. People *really* big rights owning left. swear wasn‚Äôt Madison Milwaukee, Wisconsin would reddest state is. 

They *hate* Governor mask mandate. fought courts 7 months. it‚Äôs upheld, guess what, people still don‚Äôt care accustomed defying law already. going it, every single anti masker drives pickup, gun, aggressive tell wear mask. 

Wisconsin shithole state  ""How you?"" came looking Lance Archer comment!  Yes, yes are. Please ignore ignorant people. Anything keep held accountable. Nope Doesnt matter! happening family! /s Agreed. lets get straight serve beverages go tiny room use bathroom. That's stupid Can't save Wisconsin Wisconsin. completely hopeless moron believing CCP's numbers nothing tell change that. literally can't help dude. Nothing change fact moron. ever going top 1% suffers temporary drop portfolio?!?!?!?!?! somebody pleaaaaase think 1%ers?!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!? took long Real life darwinism people assume India forced do? 
That can‚Äôt lockdown won‚Äôt able vaccinate majority 2023  Take it, duh.  Interesting approach. Soft lock down, businesses mostly affected schools still session. kind like it. We'll see successful are. Although officially mandatory stay home order, government uses terms like ""we're asking people stay home,"" knowing full well mass non-compliance thing it. raised pay dropped people's hours. Family works making less per paycheck now. can‚Äôt ‚Äúdo New Zealand‚Äù uk USA you‚Äôd need complete shut Melbourne style excess 6 months. 

New Zealand Taiwan acted fast managed get rid virus early stages, uk us millions hundreds thousands active cases that‚Äôs happening said vaccine? Long lasting immunity occur, already shown. Sounds like end world me. People noticing months ago smokers ‚Äúseemed‚Äù get infected anywhere near rates non-smokers. It‚Äôs good studies finally coming out. 

Smoking bad. kill you. Even doesn‚Äôt causes problems. I‚Äôm smoker right plans quit vaccine available even though originally planned quit Thanksgiving. Saving comment! virus spread water droplets air. droplets recirculated inside stores buildings. Always wear mask inside unless going around/passing close people outside much point wear one walk. republican, see much protesting violence, screaming dems lost last election. talking group cant say good game... lol number one rule...  Seems bit thin - like perhaps could added summer? I'm perhaps that's reasonable number. would people, make effort actually litsen people information might help? Instead effective snowflake, whining crying ""muh rights"". People fucking stupid, run around yelling smart chanting "" smart, smrt"" feels like forth country otherwise keep tension high. problem everywhere. actual nurses? Wearing scrubs indicator. supply room clerk wear scrubs. Let guess...they're 85 years old. It‚Äôs feature competitive cyclists drive bodies edge complete systemic collapse training racing. shouldn‚Äôt look event evidence coronavirus dangerous problem even young strong. athlete position particularly weak vulnerable infection. Don‚Äôt kill grandma sub unironically thinks millions children starving growing poverty worth grandma living years. seems like make winter, done, experts believe vaccine widely available March, soon nothing. Surprise, don‚Äôt care. Taking away gun, taking away right self defense.

It's taking megaphone I'm using shout face 10cm away.

The reason feel like need gun defend yourself, let fucking idiot who's angry taking parking space one too.

If warzone, gun. I'm rally, give back megaphone.

If stood street chat, where's need either?

If civilized debate, pull megaphone starting shouting you, would response go get megaphone? rules can't use megaphone first place? We've got similar restrictions currently place north border too, differences: Bizarrely bookies open though cant life see seen essential. Sports North border, actually bit air Executive cant agree anything. schools closed, whereas south they're remaining open now, would question long given side border we're starting see fairly significant evidence fair chunk spread via schools (1,500 cases directly related since August).

We'd better working together entire island thing, given Westminster bit useless right now. DUP would throw toys pram sulk suggest though. I‚Äôve lived MN 67 years. It‚Äôs MN passive aggressive.

WI lot traits. way get link posted fifth sixth time seem forget videos. didn‚Äôt forget videos, batshit. one ""flu"" every year scientists try predict strains vaccine shall work. high mutation rate leads many different virus versions likely never able ""control"" flu. moment hint tested vaccines work versions SARS-Covid-19 ‚Äì way better chance here.  everyone still obsessing lockdowns months even places like NY using localized response? think government trying flex control needlessly, would hope overall goal eradicate disease as, best case scenario takes many years, likely happen.  lol, surprised all. Obviously someone failed tell beloved, decades old, iconic restaurants going business county lobby!! 


(I pro lockdown science following person, think, \*insert lady math gif\*) mn, Wisconsin Minnesota nurses talking shit virus, gov Tim Walz reaction virus, masks, ‚Äúoh no, kid miss one football game hanging someone day prior tested positive.‚Äù

I live Colorado felt like fell Alex Jones hole went home. literally told someone one point, ‚Äúyes think I‚Äôm smarter every nurse know choose listen expert epidemiologists, know I‚Äôm smarter field,‚Äù thought nurse sister redneck, Jesus freak, church, nurse friends smarter dr fauci entire cdc who.

I appalled went home summer I‚Äôm sad happen, I‚Äôm glad really ignorant people learning lesson privileged assess never learned think right. He's type person directly affect him, care. He's young healthy, care. Today irate old man come place work. wearing mask clearly irritated seeing staff wearing masks. policy arent supposed let customers without masks, manager soft coronavirus situation let us toss people comply mask policy. I'm trapped behind counter making man's order, starts rambling 50 CORONAVIRUS dead means doctors liars thieves. boss still refused toss apparently ""regular good guy"". I'm currently self quarantining looking new job, disgusts little people care others. Also, Covid spread quickly without international flights. Proving idea talking about.
