0,2021-11-12," thought headline alarming. Know one less trapped. can't see rest us, we're here. dread coming weeks, knowing numbers start keep rising Thanksgiving. 2,000 cases highly dense country 50 million. Seems pretty control me. Man Arch Deluxe good brief lifespan It’s bold strategy, Cotton. Let’s see pays them. zero twenty gazillion deaths caused vaccines!!! Partially vaccinated help. See Europe right now. Sorry delta made mRNA vaccines three shot regimen.  \*picard faceplam\* UK Trendsetter comes shit Covid policies. bucking trends. That’s exactly feels like. went first times since 2019 week Halloween. Wore n95s whole time literally nobody else anything. make sound reasonable! Except that's works. example, many people overeaten point making sick, drunk alcohol point throwing getting unpleasant situations, stayed way past bedtime hated next morning, stop again. giving people way much credit. 

Also, average white American anti-vaxxer concerned medical abuse government, know first thing history did, care think groups people affected. wish way vaccinated people rural states like Alabama could band together create vaccinated community help move vaccinated area. want Alabama bad. don’t means leave doubt will. idiots screaming rights infect people don’t seem understand care immunocompromised rights too. Me, too. like imprisoned someone else's misdeed.  Well day late.... treatments HepC take 8-12 weeks, people don’t take medication HepC ever rest lives, detectable virus bodies, don’t progression organ damage disease.

If that’s considered cure, *what fuck is*?

Also, whether people still disease general population doesn’t bearing whether cure exists. cure poor distribution it, that’s separate problem.  Dear God. Huntsville area too. work local hospital wouldn’t believe amount unvaccinated idiots still won’t get it. coming around, wish they’d fire people already. words. I’m high school math teacher. lies detected here. Republicans use dismantle Obamacare further. 6th wave? point may well stop counting. fuck’s sake, order persons vaccinated. Eligible unvaccinated populations ordered house arrest comply. Exemptions course person anaphylactic contraindications available vaccines, reason get vaccinated. Exemptions issued certified allergist file approved exemption chief medical officer. Surprising. hope keep up, predict may backlash. 

Thing is, people shopping, stretching legs going work...it's going much. many chances transmission. 

Certainly prohibiting going pub, restaurants, salons, entertainment venues, etc. help...that's NY doing.

But really want hit hard? Make work home reduced pay. cousin math teacher he's anti vax. assumes people due diligence ""research"". “+33% meat”  point driving sports car drive speed limit? Freedom, amirite? /s  badly administered well. kept downplaying critical situation China start pandemic, late act. Surprised he's still holding position. fired long time ago.  Vaccinated not, 2 outcomes, either catch don't. Thus 50/50 odds catching different unvaxed. /s Humans horrible time understanding ratios, percentages, statistics. 

An easy example whole 99.5% survival rate. ones argue good odds likely wouldn’t play game 1:200 chance dying… even though it’s probability. 

But statistical “paradox” cited prove stats just… tough. 

Birthday paradox, monte hall problem, potato paradox (I understand one completely yet STILL blows mind) **FEEL** wrong basic statistics prove otherwise. Yeah, checks  really odd think every person world would ok injected something dont understand. would think thats human nature. Like stomach ache ate something think made stomach upset dont eat again. even nothing it. comes discussion humans simple oh people educated stupid. real fact human beings know shittiest things other. combine lack education mis use authority within government powers kinda makes sense. you’ve 3 shots, go live you’re life. You’ll fine. You’ve already done part. Many us trying still stuck mask mandates. I’m also plane every week, cannot fucking wait fly without masks again. Hey now, I’m awful math illusions deadly infectious virus COVID is. don’t think it’s math issue, it’s critical thinking inability recognize accurate sources information issue.   thought South Korea controlled?  misinformation spreads everywhere people generally come around. bad math Dude shut up! Yes absolutely Vax detoxes work. Go get shot we'll detox right you. legally get Vax card. Yup detoxed vaccine right body dose. Yes sir! Shocker wealth gap, need substantial wealth tax it’s late. vaccinations work! let idiots die let's take masks move on.  I've never understood slider.

I remember first appeared locally (limited-time Burger King?), something like ""3 burgers $5!""

Boy disspointed ""quarter bun"". Maybe try ""Thousands bad events vaccines? There're hundreds thousands deaths COVID!"" US procured doses back June additional doses days  im pretty sure saw commas post maybe wrong. Sadly think right. communities ravaged liberal boogey man known ""*Climate Change*"" forced reconsider values.

Florida coastal Deep South battered ever increasingly strong hurricanes persistent flooding. Drought already hitting ln-land Georgia regularly summers too, causing water rights disputes Tennessee.

Texas simply seasonal temperature extremes make unbearable live in. Nevermind access clean water. Might good oil natural gas, farming ranching.

The Plains feeling temperature swings, sure, people resilient weather built homes/towns handle it. They've seen crazy shit, going regular. However, dependent ground water irrigation feeding cattle. aquifers drying up.

The Rockies water issues well. Snow melt can't counted consistently face incredibly hot seasons. Good luck raising cattle farming. Maybe mining towns make it.

All folks leave folks become refugees. try play ""We're Americans!"" Ignoring prior calls succeed throwing temper tantrum liberal policies gay marriage, healthcare, taxes, list goes on. They'll hate fact looked upon ""The Locals"" whatever bastion society end in. take years integrate, humility set in, many refugees lost vast majority wealth dirt poor. Then, maybe then, they'll reconsider shitty views equality taking care society whole.... Since news… it’s common sense. think 50 million people US died past year? might noticeable I’d think. Well, like title article, bad math. Alberta Variant much lower chance contracting virus. Fewer hosts means less transmission less chance mutation. course breakthrough infections occur rare. Hmm... Interesting, honestly idea then. chills first night, headache next day, fine that. least, two weeks heart thing. Sorry happened him! ""smarter people less likely get sheeped idiots"" huge shocker

I wonder big grant research proposal Isn’t big part problem poorer nations distribution rather supply? understanding big obstacles regarding remote communities, areas undergoing civil strife, possibly biggest, storage transportation problems MRNA vaccines need ultra cold refrigeration short shelf life room temperature. Withholding boosters communities ready waiting won’t solve problems.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

I think anything explain her. intuition says ""thousands big number"" ""1% small number"". I'm double jabbed, vaccinated help prevent spread? That's part plan. cannot tell many people bad math. 99.8% number comes deaths overall population, deaths infected population.

Minnesota here. high vax rate high cases. test positivity rate around 9%.  20% people seem masking, required. Well there’s something everyone isn’t lol Yes, especially start vaccines kind happened time virus exponentiality really starting manifest... people denying people died covid pre-vaccine conveniently claim people dying today due covid vaccine, virus. wait, people *not* dying pre-vaccine? *head scratch* matter happens, truth virus kills must danced around eternity. Keep dance, integrity-challenged, zero-ambiguity-tolerance death wishers.

Articles need stop reporting consolidated vaxxed+unvaxxed death rate. Instead, publications report separately death rates vaccinated unvaccinated, people see stark difference without awaken cognitive miser type mental labor beyond 2nd grade math.  Right -- UK week ago, last week less cases week prior. also seen many antivaxx post link study shows “natural immunity better”. Except study actually says vaccine enhances natural immunity. point out, downvote en masse.    saw thread thousands upvotes calculated odds dying COVID using ""CDC"" numbers. denominator everyone population, people gotten COVID.

This bothered since day one. “survivor” I’ve never covid? No! can’t include people never covid mortality calculations. 

And AZ specifically, earlier week surpassed 0.3% entire state’s population dying covid whatever number conspiracy nuts clinging doesn’t even apply we’re beyond already. AZ’s case fatality rate 1.80% whole little lower due current surge cases. drill demographic subcategories, CFR 65+ 10.53%. That’s 1 9.5 seniors. senior population whole we’ve already lost 1.22% (1 82). guy. Urban MN here. Boosted last week. Masking everywhere. Stay safe!  Well, personally, don’t want part 98% survive suffer Erectile Disfunction. Yeah see problem that.   covid numbers mostly undercounted.

That's claiming lol know based upon fact I'm healthy individual, health experts suggested people age immune system job (not around alot people time) get booster. I'm looking random stranger convince me, original comment said I'm confused public health messaging entire situation. making quite assumptions original comment, I'm done talking you, thanks. needed study this?  Bite bullet go out. You’ll fine. it’ll shake fear again. everything supposed do! Enjoy  least Shenzhen, we've back basically normal since March 2020. 8 deaths, 587 cases since beginning population 14 million. think least Shenzhen numbers reasonably trustworthy large expat population would hard hide proportionate cases there. know anyone gotten COVID. Certainly deaths. can't speak data rest China FWIW think Shenzhen pretty legit see numbers come out.

No lockdowns anything like that. one month Delta came everyone got tested week done with. Mostly vaccines, masks indoors (basic surgical), contact tracing (check-in QR codes places), thermal screening. We're pretty far behind comes FFP2/N95 masking, indoor ventilation, filtration protocols etc- things never got point.

I almost everyone know vaccinated- local Chinese ones, two. think strong also one gets side effects terms fever soreness might help compliance.

I seen sign aggressive surface disinfection fomite mitigation measures since early days- although know frozen imports checked. Chinese scientists still pretty firm cold-chain potential vector (but obviously factor aiming COVID-zero).

I almost everyone know vaccinated- local Chinese ones, two boosters. think strong also one gets side effects terms fever soreness might help compliance. China whole 84%, sounds right based social circle given old young would it.

No vaccinate mandates, know two unvaxxed locals (both VPNs active Facebook interesting data point) QR code says unvaxxed, seems non-issue.

As far heavy-handed stuff, messages go get tested Delta came pretty firm- like 10-minute wait neighborhood testing center. big deal. nothing really draconian, occasional reminder pull masks going malls such. Things may vary elsewhere nothing really crazy come across feed since early days.

While understand place China model COVID mitigation West many, many reasons, curious Shenzhen handled it:

[STUDY DATA SHENZHEN, CHINA, PROVIDES KEY COVID-19 transmission COVID-19 391 cases 1286 close contacts Shenzhen, China: retrospective cohort COVID-19 infection status, prevention control strategies among people entering Berlin, rapid antigen tests free *daily* basis. People get tested daily fun, time needed negative test within past 24 hours enter store. people got vaccinated, testing sites got less busy, government cut free testing. course, that's right started getting cold, clubs reopened, schools reopened summer, delta variant began spreading vaccinated populations. are... smart. better prepared. US take notes. Smilver Smurfer  Yep, live highly vaccinated area everybody still wear masks public buildings. stressed getting booster - really support people worldwide getting it, boosters need it. immune compromised neighbour certainly happy it.  like dummies point areas almost everyone vaccinated (90%+) make nearly half hospitalizations.

they wrap heads around idea 10% pop makes half hospitalizations, means they're infected 5x rate. can't go something like now, soon third dose Moderna (the effective vaccine!) antibodies high they'll ever be, comfortable enough it? 

And comfortable enough, weather nice enough sit patio? Holy cow. shouldn’t forced work them. Props committed vaccination despite adverse reaction Y’all making want cut science funding no-shit studies are. Vaccines definitely reduce transmission, bring enough victory declared bug.   danger level particular individual, society whole.

We know unvaccinated risk catching it. They're higher risk spreading it. They're risk hospitalization. They're risk dying (across age groups). know virus spreads across largely unvaccinated population overwhelm hospitals result people need care things (not covid) getting care need.

I think getting tested sick enough need medical intervention. Unfortunately people who've got ME/CFS tried vitamin protocols. say alleviate anything, bit simplistic unfortunately. seems there's damage way cells process energy (mitochondria). trials run third doses 6+ months: 6-8 months, pfizer trial averaged 11 months. shown extremely effective compared two doses.

The point Fox requiring employees people they're bashing requiring. know say without getting flagged political. really need worry third dose. Convince friend get too.  Exactly point, needed time research!   r/noshitsherlock Maybe general lack understanding use percentages - use them, compare them, etc. Two examples:  


1. understanding apply: remember US states started hitting point 1 every 1000 residents (not positive cases total residents) died COVID. standard response heard ""that's less 1%!"" Like....yes, is. helpful determining personal risk dying COVID, good job conveying overall impact disease country hundreds millions people. 
2. using correct denominator: looking risk adverse reactions vaccination, people pull percentage calculated increased risk someone get vaccine get COVID. But, odds getting COVID well 0, even literal Antarctica. So, baseline unrealistic, especially since nearly every reported side effect vaccine reported much higher rates people contract COVID. shit. I'm surprised getting sued every episode. Yes. soooo much. 

I live area hit 50% Vax rates yet everyone acts like covid gone. vaccine mandates mask mandates nothing wouldn’t mind stupid much weren’t fucking.

Basic math tells mortality rate SIGNIFICANTLY higher that. I'm going brother go math get date figure around 1.5%-1.7%? That's alot...I mean 330,000,000 Americans right? 1.5% Americans die thats 4.95 million 1.7% die that's 5.61 million.

Fuck difference two .2% something like 600,000+ people. 

Hell 5.6 million poeple like Chicago LA (city limits died)

Also sure 1.5% die

But MANY MANY MANY suffer long term affects. I've heard numbers high 7%-8%. 

Then look vaccine numbers vaccinated nearly RISK GOES AWAY. though. Americans prefer beliefs facts. Functional illiteracy somewhere around 20% mark US.

Part young earth creationism maxes 6000. Combination fuel mixture set toward 'attracted conservative media' angle. Fundamentally, Fox *as business* business essentially tell customers hear. wag dog effect happens conservative media much top-down hierarchy talking points push operations, they're also vividly aware audience reacts aim min-max optimize that, too. 

The fixed point something like Fox always present least challenging take subject framed simply defined problems solutions clear heroes villains. Next that, Fox keen parasocial relationship effect something often gets lost people really paid much attention vile hateful crap hosts spew 'others', pretty much equal measured fraternity afforded viewers. least superficial level. 

The funny thing is, conservatives even refute really. fairly open fact seek adhere 'conservative news' 'conservative' spaces. also assume everyone else functions way anything conservative space 'liberal' space default.  French got around calling Royale Cheese. know fuck quarter pounder is. someone who's worked lot service industry confirm people bad math. people trouble giving right change calculating tips idt understanding statistics work. forget purpose poisoning us population control end population obedient easier control.

Because killing us sheep went got vaccine trust science, instead rebels fought surely result easier control population. even realise got infected (no symptoms). 

So vaccine job? wrap heads around idea 10% pop makes half hospitalizations, means they're infected 5x rate.

wouldn't 9x rate?

if 1/10th population (P) = 0.1 * P

and hospitalized rate R^unvaccinated . amount hospitalizations unvaccinated people = 0.1 * P * R^unvaccinated

if 9/10ths total population (P) = 0.9 * P

and hospitalized rate R^vaccinated . amount hospitalizations vaccinated people = 0.9 * P * R^vaccinated

and amount hospitalizations equal unvaccinated vaccinated (unvaccinated people make half = * P * R^unvaccinated = 0.9 * P * R^vaccinated

the total population cancels * R^unvaccinated = 0.9 * R^vaccinated

multiply sides = 9 * R^vaccinated

or could theoretical. say 100 people total 10 hospitalized, 5 unvaccinated 5 vaccinated

the rate unvaccinated people hospitalized 5/10 (or 1/2 50%)

the rate vaccinated people hospitalized 5/90 (or 1/18 0.555...%)

the rate unvaccinated people hospitalized (1/2) nine times rate vaccinated people = 9/18 friends friend pizza place argue waiter cause think pizza could cut odd number slices.

It's really frustrating hear people gloating getting vaxxed saved planet . get vaccine protect . vaccine's job / purpose . ,not ""care"" others.

I thinking anyone got jab . feeling happy something remain alive .

 Yet ,somehow, world declaring otherwise . kind heroism (???) ???   already place german states  states, since news reported Alabama television station, mentions data Alabama. I’ve explain someone graph ‘number deaths’ isn’t going even vaccination. Blame media politicians. Covid information public 99.9% garbage, noise even outright lies. bad math core problem media constantly reports studies misleading way possible get click bait headline. remember burger chain releasing third pounder burger flopping americans though less quarter pounder burger.


And tools fractions, you?
1/4, 5/16, 3/8, 7/16...
Those ar complicated maths careful dosage, easy get confused youre sick. Hope feel better soon.  know made assume feel special anything else along lines, know me. I'm definitely entitled anything definitely one give shit planet. chose *not* children many reason big one feel confident efforts save ourselves. planet fine btw, least Sun burns end life, us animals go extinct act (and maybe late anyway). surprise me?!   must lucky, even highest breakthrough infection rate reported 1 100 that's generous virus is. pandemic issue planet / humanity facing. tons problems people care . news anyone. 

How come people get vaccine ( save themselves,not planet) suddenly considered ""the responsible ones "" ""the ones care "" whereas unvaccinated might well burn hell ?

Why applying distinction areas ,or done far ? People buy one car example contributing pollution. People end hospital failed properly take care health medical system suffering. People shop non stop thus depleting earth natural resources.So many examples . 

No, instead get vaccine automatically belong ""good ones"" ,you proud looking greater good feel entitled condemn ones refuse get vaxxed . keep contributing destruction planet ...

I find narrative hypocritical people brainwashed believe got vaccine ( big deal ) sort heroes ""others"" deserve die . 

I fully vaxxed yet humble . feel special . 17%*  said “No questions asked.”  empathy?

What empathy kids mask day school?  Well everyone know vaccinated none gotten breakthrough. told times, ""smart"" tradeshows came Vegas, gambling went down. titty bars always great though. Cases Illinois rising again...the reinstated mask mandated done much appears.  Russia Europe? coworker told boss giving 110%. outdone, another coworker called slacker people team giving 120%. responsible adults care welfare families society not. 

This true.  Yes. case prior boosters vaccinated. Western Australia case numbers outside quarantined new arrivals plateued zero April 2020 remained zero ever since occasional blip.We restrictions seen mask worn four months. make bottom numbers multiplying fraction top bottom. add.

1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6

The easiest multiply bottom numbers together since multiplication commutative (2x3 = 3x2)

It's useful algebra awkward fractions decimal well ...or msm cant go 10 min without lying yeah i’m worried peers math class   way!!!  /s case.     lie one ask. specifically ask eligible. don’t think chance, it’s sort thing I'm surprised downvoted oblivion.  quite lucky virus lazy comes mutations, already several candidates even better vaccines - work future mutation virus. yeah, good portion population consists anti-vaxxers - means pandemic last far longer people think. end pandemic, two things must happen: current anti-vaxxers died already children got vaccinated, like Polio. take two generations least. course must keep vaccination rates high time zoonosis - forever.   im trying use logic - 60-70% seems dubious herd immunity - thats 30-40% without protection.. get sick. herd immunity model work?

so people hanging spreading more, makes sense. person w vaccine still gets covid 100% herd immunity,   LPT: Buy 2 tickets! OMG We've solved lottery!      also ears see articles prove vaccinated DONT lower chances infecting someone.

&amp;#x200B;

This article says vaccinated previously found vaccinated people infected alpha 73 per cent less likely infect unvaccinated people. would imply 'strength covid' person affects spread it. lets say 50% covid u cant get someone sick 80% can. sounds dubious im virologist. way see symptoms come higher covid sickness levels. - example coughing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is so, knows?  There's living normally again. Stop liying yourself. virus stay regardless    studies prove vaccinated people DONT lower chance infect person covid?

&amp;#x200B;

I see studies showing lowered infection rated listed curious another lottery cheap buy fantasy better life daydream days.

People generally know odds slim none choose optimistic seems likely change lives winning action could take.  Yep, I'm talking quite bit paracetamol. Helps bit fever comes back. guess I'll live week so. Thanks advice!   America bad That's point making. takes months roll vaccine there's 1/3 population get infos Facebook refuse get vaccinated.  awhile age range access, I'm terribly worried it, shots, plus Covid shots. reaction vaccine pretty miserable. Arm pain bad broke tears times work, plus severe flu like symptoms. Fortunately 2 days first day off. Arm pain bad felt like inflamed rotator cuff, two days really even take shirt. 

The reaction odd, expected reaction since Covid, never reacted vaccination like that. even time 5 vaccination shots once. Covid hit harder expected. essential worker able shield like others could. 

But I'll still get booster, one researches, safe vaccine, far important have, yes I'll reaction again, well worth protect others. TBH, goes right head break decimals. ask fractions yup.... Durrr answer. Hah. understand fractions 8 years old (back day) matter many pizzas father drew. took violin lessons: 4/4 timing 4 beats per measure, quarter note 1/4. 4 *quarter* notes per measure! *Instant* understanding.

Edit: fact weaponised idiocy great tag line Facebook. Take upvote.  Yeah, children suffer horrible damage every vacation, too, right? Children die. many adults simply calculate IFR number children 12, deaths. think number acceptable, think unworthy discussion. Also, enough time prepare passed without anything done. vaccines, look USA. Right now, enough data reasonably assume rare, yet undetected side effect nearly much harm covid.

Edit: typo taken Tylenol/ Paracetamol? help lower fever. Cold compresses dabbing damp cloth also helps water evaporatjng cool you.

Don't nebulise water,I'm pretty sure would irritate lungs cause coughing. Steaming great loosen phlegm, bowl boiled water towel head. add eucalyptus drops bit Vicks too.

I think meant say news definitely article. gives fuck Oxford comma? gives fuck grammar Reddit.

You must hate reading Faulkner wish possible spend even one day working kids one one teach basic things they're missing. know time help students individually many would pretty quickly understand improve. teach high school algebra. 35 kids 50 minutes, 5 class periods day. literally time world help bring lot work individually. frankly impossible. makes sad see kids know like describe. try best help them. 

People say teachers need paid that's fine whatever really really need (for us actual learning students) fewer students. options wind costing money second students actually benefit learn. sell 1/3 1/5 make money idiots non-idiots alike received Pfizer. zero problems definitely recommend hesitant due fear. never understood models optimistic forecasts continuing decline cases, etc several months

There’s going winter “surge”, though likely much lower total severe outcomes US saw last year pre-vaccine 

Might also less “wave-y”, oscillating spurts decline rather continuing build towards eventual peak decline Good, Though hope plan attack. think ""paradox"" badly worded. Imagine this:
I aero chocolate bar 50% air weighs 100g. crush let air bubbles. much weigh? Obviously still 100g air weighs little. potato version we're told density solid no-water potato. Therefore can't get answer without little information. Assuming dried potato density water pretty big assumption imo. saw something research showing percentage Americans think chocolate milk comes brown cows, things surprise anymore People getting sick. sick admitted. ICU patient hospital seen rapid increase last weeks. still backlog normal healthcare we’re room for. 

Demonstration digital pass 5G networks mostly though. Fox viewers likely believe falsehoods. gullible nature, that's Republicans love 'em.
They love uneducated.  Oh man, hate needles. managed learn stress beforehand, go state nothingness during, think ""eh, bad"" after.

I've got basically vaccinations available needed travel work Corona. Can't wait booster. I’m Australia, wanted point shouldn’t bashing yanks little gem: fight guy coronavirusdownunder told 2% death rate “basically nothing” said fact 1 50 people died sad, called every name sun (including dumb liar fear mongering) didn’t believe 1 50 another way saying 2%. days really hate here. easiest way say is, Americans really dumb. .017 that's reason. record believe someone right refuse get vaccinated, think choice consequences.

Theres practical benefit vaccine mandates. Every single country/state/city/company/whatever announced form vaccine mandate saw large spike vaccination rates. leads believe actual number antivaxxers much smaller think lot unvaccinated procrastinators.

I live Canada. province need show vaccine passport go restaurants, movie theaters indoor events. Teens need vaccinated participate extra curricular activities school. 85% eligible population vaccinated (5-11 year olds yet eligible Canada). Last year time still businesses shut allowed visit friends family indoors (so Thanksgiving Christmas gatherings) knew heavier restrictions would come Christmas. year everything open fewer cases much fewer hospitalizations deaths. steadily lifting restrictions managing sick point deaths per day.

Go ahead look Canada's statistics compare places like Texas Florida seemingly efforts made control pandemic. Go look many people died last 6 months. come back tell vaccines something encourage mandates. Would cause absence immune reaction virus's antigens. mean, immune system would recognize threat...   Math teacher: get act together, 80% fail class.

Someone back: Ha, even many students class! Right, we're still vigilant black death Spanish flu even though vaccines those. Part impression we’re often comparing two different things: 

Vaccine trials measured reduction **symptomatic illness** (VE = 90-95%), - especially regions robust testing protocol - we’re finding lot asymptomatic breakthrough infections, creating impression vaccines weaker. Trails didn’t measure directly reduction clinically diagnosed infections 

With said, combo Delta potential immunity waning reduced symptomatic *still high* 80-90%, still preventing ~95% severe outcomes, lower rate infections (50-60%?) Victoria anti vaxxers basically locked everything anyway! I’m Netherlands despite 85% adult vaccination rate, also highest numbers since start whole disaster, hospitals overburdened. Despite 15%, unvaccinated majority hospital. obvious solution everyone wants responsible adults get lives; question is, feasible enforce? doubt it. hope hell works well move direction targeted lockdowns unvaccinated. dubious it’s going enforceable. Personally would take moderna situation, unless prize heavy burden financial situation. got moderna 1st 2nd shots months ago.

I tired yes, gone..  EU also rich fuck.  Ah, funny coincidence, posted paper Topol referring: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection deaths among US veterans 2021

As see survival also decreasing (Fig3). Awful soundtrack aside, break down, America China more-or-less equally uncaring rights, freedoms, safety. America better selling it. blame ,I would done sooner . Vermont used low transmission rates record new infections daily. vaccination rate apparently 85%. What’s going on? “60 percent Americans Level 2 below, almost 30 percent Level 1, meant struggled even two-step calculations.” hear parts Russia finally mask mandates police even enforcing fines arrests yeah, used ""general public"" instead ""journalists"".    RECEIVED Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen
You eligible booster are: 18 years SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection deaths among US veterans Although breakthrough infection increased risk death, vaccination remained protective death persons became infected Delta surge. July October 2021, VE-D age 65 years 73.0% Janssen, 81.5% Moderna, 84.3% Pfizer-BioNTech; VE-D age ≥65 years 52.2% Janssen, 75.5% Moderna, 70.1% Pfizer-BioNTech. Findings support continued efforts increase vaccination, booster campaigns, multiple, additional layers protection infection.

On waning vaccine effectiveness among US Veterans time Delta wave. Across ages; J&amp;J vaccine decline; reduction protection vs deaths isn’t basically republicans want? Destroy school system, except elite, turns keeps people stupid continue brainwashed republicans seen truly awful are? 0.2% 7.9 billion 15,8 million people. Chuck E. Cheese, you? It’ll never gone. flu pandemic 100 years ago people still get day. disagree kid's experience (fully vaxxed btw). Apparently. 

Again, actual fuck. Hey now. love playing Mega/Powerball goes high enough. buy days number result day dream I'll money. 

Those rather excellent day dreams. Worth price Mega/powerball ticket. lol tests show psychosomatic real thing though don’t know guys, I’m thinking maybe spent less time school talking “*the mitochondria powerhouse cell*” time talking basic life-maths. chances winning infinitely higher buy ticket don't. Yup, us toddler get vaccination, probably turns two Spring.

We're cautious year ago, still, over. thought mom pretty sensible, pandemic I'm afraid tell vaccination get long hauler virus, covid. I've cold. main concern too. bronchitis weeks short breath months, cold. sucked. Maybe attention long hauler covid help long hauler viruses, too. tl;dr: living covid long-term brings risk of

- vaccine immunity escape

- transmissibility disease severity increase result evolution

- coronaviruses may capable persistence host low replication state 

- reinfection

- longer-term impacts immune system yet unknown…we concerned risk lasting immune dysfunction damage. 

- long covid - e.g., brain organ damage. science always universally agreement, last month become really clear: third doses absolutely crush transmission severe disease. effect even larger young people.

Public health always lagged behind science pandemic. credible argument universal third doses need first doses poor countries, sadly rising even worldwide daily doses  disagree. absolutely challenging read comprehend it. However, nothing ever good inside echo chambers. don’y know we’ll ever fix that, though. Exactly opposite area.0 People always saying “well we’re still pandemic”.  sad necessity explain basic fucking fractions grown-ass asults. obsolete triple vaccinated wear KN95 everywhere. You’re best protect yourself. mental health okay completely isolating world? Depends restrictions are. seem like common sense. places indoor mask mandates places high vax rates. basically means can’t go bar restaurant. That’s far onerous TSA people handful times year (and that, always get precheck). Sadly Americans, sadly maths - history too.

The UK suffering lunacy too.    Yeah, rural NY essentially Mississippi. Go get it. protecting yourself. protecting others increasing immunity symptomatic infection doesn’t surprise Eh, vote 4 years propaganda takes advantage brains plant agenda exercised polls. rinse, repeat. think simple explanation healthcare system sucks lot people. people access regular physicals could get established gp could build trust with, maybe they’d less susceptible types conspiracy theories misinformation. 

Being asshole elitist types people doesn’t solve problem. Two assholes make situation shittier.   Yeah came say I’m sure expect country bunch people think 1/4 bigger 1/3 4 bigger number. went school learned fractions yet still many people don’t get this, it’s wild much really put school system vs people wanting learn material though? 

I grown adult friends still use wrong form “their”, “your”, don’t know put apostrophes show possession. 

They’ve learned stuff multiple times. went elementary schools. Yet never put effort learn kids don’t put effort adults. don’t think “the school system failed them”, they’re lazy don’t see point learning correct words. really spread care about... thing around long long time. hospitals full, that's real problem. Thus, get car accident, there's room plague rat covidiots packing hospital brim. needed keep delaying childrens vaccines.

Even responsible people like trying “get life,” still waiting something protect youngest isn’t reliant strangers’ judgement. It’s exhausting keep hearing it’s fine death rare among kids. that’s thing we’re worried about. Get Brian! Morans  Last flight took 9/11 Europe, gf brought 750 size bottle wild turkey plane flight attendant bring us glasses ice 100% cool done openly. Imagine trying now. It’d like lighting smoke subway something haha  much lower.

Delta = double spread + double hospitalisations.
 
With many antivaxxers states, basically point last year without vaccines. winter going catastrophic.

Without bidens mandates would even worse. Every unvaxxed 50+ person one potentially blocked hospital bed. fully vaxxed people can’t spread virus catch themselves?

This can't. matter likelyhood.

A car working brakes driven sober driver still crash. However anyone moron would understand they're safer car one without brakes driven drunk.

Something 100% perfect highly beneficial. I’m fully vaccinated Moderna, plus booster. wear mask anytime I’m forced go indoors. don’t eat inside restaurants. Currently isolating Covid. I’ll fine. feels like cold even particularly terrible one. I’ve felt way worse many illnesses. able smell taste unpleasant. 

The point still it. Don’t know how. do. it’s reminder difficult continue society also stop cases. Even heavily vaccinated population, cases. Plenty them. good news vaccine, I’m zero danger severe outcome basically sit bed another days feeling like crap. Whatever. I’ve sick before. I’d people test immediately come house every 2-3 days after. rapid tests good telling you’re *infectious* right now, aren’t good telling you’re *infected* could become infectious later. 

Congratulations caring/reasonable family. Fucking well said mate. Using perfect words, putting nice places. New Covid variants turn infectious deadly.  I've never understood this. ""restrictions"" far less say TSA security yet nobody ""over it"" comes airport screenings... way life now. Expect booster shot like flu shot every year. Wear mask coughing sick. Deal like adult. Adapt. land eternal non-vaccinated, really.    work. probably preparation full lock politicians know it. No. Nice try, say point.
I specifically addressing fact vaccination children almost available time, number infections age group skyrocketing. this, never point time protecting would appropriate now. even account virus mutation, happened time last year giving birth Delta variant. boosters good going get. Throw vaccines school age kids really good going get winter.

If kids 5 looking ahead things next winter going better now.

People willing hold line thought clear exit. sizeable population Germany ignore too. didn’t even need put COVID beginning title. I’m awful math don’t fall nonsense  Fine, make messaging “get boosted”. cases can’t metric, never surges cases. Forever. vaccine development decade. It’s tested administered year half billions shots given. It’s shown overwhelmingly safe. people don’t want end. longest 14 days life. Although lot expected back early September southern states case load started decreasing. Honestly thing holding back right lack adequate protection treatment long covid. know risk things like flu flu much easier avoid transmission infect people rate feel like that's fair comparison. go years without contracting flu minute drop precautions like masking I'm guaranteed catch covid. I'm happy low-moderate risk activities vaccinated friends family, masking getting regular boosters now, pre-covid normal like travel, eating restaurants, large events, masks happen family known done combat long covid.  Bashing Americans popular right now. Getting long covid ""fine"". vaccinated decreases chance becoming infected halves chances long covid, great all, delta wave rages vaccine efficacy declines, would imagine chances long covid increase. Happy boosted point. refusals increase education funding tolerated longer wish future nation. Father law told studies existed. 20 minutes later sent 30. said couldn’t understand them. 

Brother said same. FB it. sent studies. claimed dumb redneck couldn’t understand them. asked running mouth didn’t understand. stopped got vaxxed. victory???? It’s denial, hands ears humming. hate news getting mad/downvoting try ignore it. know much pound Spain still burger ""Cuarto de Libra"". name burger us lol basically implying society reopened vaccines? Oh they’re awful math. alternative interpretation, course would 90% rate refers triage vaccinated people - 10% get admitted hospitals. /s (just case) see: die hey, others won’t stay home necessary it’s alright. allow posts singular individual. includes posts someone hospitalized, dying testing positive. think error, please modmail us.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  many times I’ve visited Fresno county coming Bay Area, I’ve noticed friends region conservative spew misinformation vaccine. 

I best convince there’s much do. I'm sure masks huge factor here. live Phoenix, AZ area masks essentially non existent since March 2021 CDC released no-mask guidance. April August, 5 months, cases stayed relatively low despite nobody wearing masks. Two 50% coupons make free - stumps 8/10 people. People blindly believe covid misinformation definition cognitive dissonance  That’s almost disorienting.

Meanwhile, Dr Topol refute article says please. make mockery yourself.

Clearly problem vaccines, reason? Tell us don’t think vaccines effective safe. People underestimating much Covid spreads even vaccinated. looks like everyone needs booster top.  horrible person  100%! hardly see grocery workers wearing masks here. ICU beds dwindling can't get mask mandate. Washington post garbage “through it” always look like, unfortunately, becomes endemic. pandemic part already over. Infections stay permanent part way life, like cold flu. places U.S. adults eligible 6 months. don’t see downside - boost will. You’ll feel safer even don’t actually need be. wrap heads around idea 10% pop makes half hospitalizations, means they're infected 5x rate

I met Harvard student fell logic trap (the topic talking nothing vaccines, math behind talking idea). 

Anecdotally, I'm grad student studying biostatistics. turns average physician really quite awful statistics. bad average Joe, still really bad, unfortunately.

It's ""dumb"" people can't stuff.  Definitely true. stubborn parents part problem. However, think they're result problem. feel like learn ""it's stupid meaningless"". way solve helping generation grow well educated parents care it. takes time fix definitely hard stubborn parents.

""We need XYZ fix it"" always easier actually XYZ practice. 

You get two types parents unhelpful. One parent thinks old way things best (because learned way usually brute force memorizing) another parent thinks reason learn old matter (usually learn themselves). fight different sides education. One fights good established teaching methods fights newer better learning methods.

The common thing usually enough time help educate child themselves. one best way tell child successful. parent parents able spend time educating child involved process.

This gets work life balance grind daily work responsibilities prevent parents able though. So, education suffers culture overworked adults. Teachers parents alike.  Tourists coming look pretty leaves. sister complains every year. illegal health insurance companies make profit. Costs going regardless burden antivaxxers, even vaccinated. breakthrough infection August vaccinated April. told surprised. think vaccine helped lot. mild symptoms. Worse thing fatigue. Walking mailbox winded me.  Maybe tell virus violating hippo laws go away?  REGULAR VACCINE THO lol  encourage vaccines can't ways. Either take personal responsibility, don't. can't rage government attempting protect you, expect government save confronted personal choices.

I get people trust doctors run hospital moment actually get sick.  Probably vaccine mandates workplaces guess There's lot testing, there's lot cases can’t fucking wait fly day Thanksgiving :-/   You’re literally responding nothing. protect them, closing schools even damange. There's really much choice. Last month, went two events, sponsored organization, agreed abide local/county rules. statewide mandate, masks required both. first event held San Francisco, attendees could even enter building without proof vaccination; recent negative test accepted. One week later, second event held Visalia (Tulare County), local covid measure small sign posted entrance building, essentially said, “We trust attendees self-monitor act accordingly.” someone there.

Please describe it. tried shooting virus?  COVID numbers going due colder weather bode well time year weather colder. cormobidity spread others deadly makes sense isolate according utilitarian economics. mean understand THOUGHT would add 2/5, explain pie slices not, quickly able get no, 2/5 actually almost one. Think it, 2/5 less 1/2. would adding anything 1/2 make less 1/2?

So blame initial reaction, blame RESISTING corrected. Practically, better option there? Personally find making restrictions hospital even less palatable, inevitable action taken. don’t think legal problem lockdown people choose vaccine. might pretty impractical enforce though.   unvaxxed spread said. article isn’t talking locking anyone neither I. point always consequences, sometimes serious ones, spreading disease. case it’s making choices consequences choices. “liberties” infringed. Vaccines new, kids can’t even get public school without them. parents’ rights infringed? 

Not sure even talking point multiple kinds vaccines available people choose nearly half population successfully vaccinated without major incident. hope Randy go partying Micky mouse Cambodia. Wow, numbers gone way since last time saw them. fantastic! rural. Buffalo NY area (Erie county) 50 cases per 100k - April '21. Winter surge last year peaked 72 per 100k. 

And like vaccinated rate low. 63% fully vaxed, almost 80% adults 1+. Nah doomed. going stop spread odds (the vacinated) fine. panic man get this. practicality sake, I'd people test leaving home travel. rare chance test positive, much easier get flight drive quarantine home, opposed arriving family's members doorstep trying quarantine people. Obviously run dilemma testing positive staying somewhere else Yes, that's correct answer :-) OMG TOO. wish lying....  know answer, raise hand They've free pandemic, made free incentive people take vaccine 3g rules actually knew talking head even modicum scientific training vaccinations would know vaccination actually prevents disease 100% time.

the fact vaccine might fail keep getting infected likely keep dying pretty much vaccines promise well

I know tend lazy talk vaccination making immune short sloppy way really saying what's going protects killed disease frequently even keep getting - guaranteed vaccine

the proof vaccination safe effective graveyards community children dropped like flies diseases never hear anymore. answer question really modicum population every living individual almost immediately birth, every individual fighting cancer, every individual already compromised immune system, every individual comorbidity can't vaccinated.

the history vaccination speaks literally biggest Boon health humankind history humankind

and would like get back normal unknowing could please go get vaccinated (just like needed send Little Johnny school), would great part TX big activities outdoors now. We're pleasant weather weekends. Sunny 68F people want outdoors. holiday family gatherings start, people congregating inside homes, unpleasantly cool winter weather drive people indoors again. indoor gathering drives spread think.  adjoining state different roles?

Is public health department call would willing give vaccine without parental consent?   talking may well form law passed legislature. case here, among issues, Biden cannot backdoor via § 655(c)(1) plainly provides, lawfully enacted, ETS 
must: (1) address “substances agents determined toxic physically 
harmful”—or “new hazards”—in workplace; (2) show workers are
exposed “substances,” “agents,” “new hazards” 
workplace; (3) show said exposure places workers “grave danger”; 
and (4) “necessary” alleviate employees’ exposure gravely 
dangerous hazards workplace. noted past, 
precision standard makes difficult one meet. See Fla. Peach 
Growers, 489 F.2d 130 (observing OSHA’s ETS authority “requires 
determination danger exposure harmful substances, 
danger exposure; and, exposure danger, grave danger; 
and, necessity temporary standard, emergency 
[temporary] standard necessary”).15
(a) frankly understand anyone who's vehemently arguing vaccination can't seem understand use pursued stringently science...

they're absolutely effective protecting public health proof graveyards everywhere world

the proof increasing life expectancies dramatically changed vaccination various common deadly diseases became norm

I simply understand people afraid vaccine that's actually fact-based somehow worse vaccines

the adverse reaction rate right vaccines everybody afraid of?  Ahh thought moderna reduced pfizer stayed 50 piece research we're notably missing comparing cellular response second dose versus third. really hard measure, apparently. data showing better post-infection outcomes third dose versus second - summary third-dose data Israel (which considerably ahead everywhere else vaccinating general really interesting collection data US, shows trends we'd expect. Hospitalization rates J&amp;J continue drop entire 8-month measured period, moderna remain low even reliably compare - even breakthrough case rates clearly start rising couple months initial vaccination. days ago one talking that.

Yes vaccination.

No masks. restrictions. 

The. End. screenshot post that? Lol what?


we're talking people who, variety reasons, can't vaccinated mass vaccination protects creates herd immunity - single best way protect society epidemics, like one that's gone pandemic well. immunity wanes sometimes little 6 weeks. people get covid mutations emerge.  actually, now, end covid anymore end mumps, whooping cough. may go stay, probably forever. Pfizer gang here. got booster week half ago. Tested positive 4 days booster. Zero symptoms, like think it’s booster. Agreed, however parents get involved say kids need learn simplest multiplication tables problem. going tell generations individuals learned sudden old fashioned needed. That's whole point article, poor understanding math issues dissonance regard masks vaccines. Source another strain? politician country tweeted day 44% people particular ICU vaccinated. follower thought meant 44% vaccinated population ICU. People kind enough explain omg. received Pfizer booster (Chile) 2 Sinovac doses. felt groggy kind dizzy first couple days post booster, wasn’t bad all. drank lot Powerade seemed help. colleagues felt like sh*t tho (but it’s still worth it). Yay T-cell memory! Antibodies wane time, bodies still remember virus fight it.  Pretty much nurse friends incredibly unsympathetic currently ICU/etc COVID. They'll tell day, ""oh yeah 2 people died COVID sucks them"", even bother anymore. 

The thing complain prone/supinate obese patients they're heavy need tons people help. got sneaking suspicion problem introductory statistics class college 2001. girl raised hand asked professor explain slope is. asking reminder formula, literally even WAS. chorus arose around ""yeah! that?"" literally stopped whole discussion y-axis x-axis stuff means.

I'm surprised we're facing even worse situation.   masks, quality kn95, kf94, ffp2, n95 masks fitted well good seal Unless we're Children Men timeline... explain room full bankers amount people buying Powerball ticket lower chance winning it. increase chance might share winning. Took way long. Get booster bitches, get'em whilst gettin' good. article also specifically states long COVID 100% real. competition, whose suffering real, psychosomatic organic. looks triggering mental illness stigma. Yeah, us elegible AZ booster Chile. got Pfizer one 2 Sinovac doses. That's still 15% unvaxxed, plenty room delta thing   Mate argument absolute saying spreading disease cool according Typhoid Mary story everyone spreads disease punished, including you, vaxxed individuals.

COVID going away, gonna spread point, guess lock preventatively contain spread. work pharmacy boy let tell patients lose minds doctor switches strength medication keeps dosage same. 

Legit last night lady 100% sure giving wrong medication. taking one 500mg pill day switched two 250mg pills day. 

I use tutor math really patient informative could be, stubborn could see convinced telling truth.   Fucking A. also child age group news blows. mean, he‘s wrong. downvotes? rural doctor‘s offices might currently get appointments far 4 8 weeks, don‘t want get vaccinated „event“ city. shoved booster mid December, „we vaccinate Wednesday now“. Amidst surge, mind you. Wednesday Germany day doctor‘s offices open till noon. used 'Okie Day Park' Mooney Grove, road Kaweah Medical Center. think need describe happened there. Clearly, alternative absolutely nothing. misread well, work Aussies almost messaged them. context:
This about, understand, tests testing stations pharmacies.
Those popular Germany open free till around 11th October. 
Right now, even unvaccinated, get ""free tests"".
My employer legally obliqued hand two tests every week.
Unvaccinated personal, alot client contact, take document two weeks.

Not sure think doctor /physician covid tests free well, medical indication could covid. symptoms 4 days everyone kept saying got Covid lasted longer 1-2. third person explain to, stopped would change subject.

Moderna well btw. First shot one got me. Second one sore arm maybe hour two. Unfortunately, part reason trust trained licensed people never successfully taught get basic gist scientific paper even basic understanding biology science general work.

Like, trust anyone particular, people trust ones show work help understand what's going based basic working understanding bodies diseases work.

Without baseline understanding of, know, virus whatnot, people completely lost. downplayed pandemic Russia too.  


Under counting cases deaths. 56k reported Covid deaths last year, 362k excess deaths last year. 


""Everything control"", ""handle pandemic better countries"", etc, days/weeks setting records deaths. E.g. economic forum St Petersburg. 


Lifting measures prematurely. Etc, Etc. 


Downplaying giving mixed messages Russian people too. Also worth mentioning peoples mistrust government too. Fact 1:
You’re 10x likely die Covid don’t get vaccine. 
Intuition 1: 
Probably 1 3 get Covid winter nah, give ‘em monkey wrench instead   Yeah nobody writes ""1/3 kg"". write grams less 1 kg. that's hard imperial system, thing ""millipounds"". Uhh, option JJ recipients, shit?

Source : jj march.  Back preexisting conditions thing, decided tough wait two months care, conditions starting policy wouldn’t covered 10 months more.   Transmissibility rate Delta, estimates 90% whole population including young children would needed fully vaccinated herd immunity effect. think different reasons:

1. Babies 2 tend really much close contact anyone outside household. Two daycare preschool usually start. 

2. know, babies cannot catch easily (exception childbirth, seems infant cases come from*) cannot spread easily. They're also less likely serious illness die it.

3. fuck ton vaccinations already given ages 2-18 months. might limitations give vaccines, kids 5-11 received many vaccines, worry body reacts (babies especially changing immune system)/how effective vaccine be. Two year olds get quite vaccines many infants basically one shot every 2 months first 12 months 18-24 months.

4. babies eventually get covid vaccine I'd imagine time they're old enough they'd probably already fairly close two years old, maybe 1 1/2... point would probably easier wait 2 years old.

I completely agree point SD end pandemic, certainly stage Germany right (all time high hospitalisations, deaths, ICU occupancy worldwide fucking #1 New infections!) especially asked pushing legislation moment.

This 100% pure Gaslighting since neo lib party deep brown economic leaders here. also one huge improvement yet come: widespread vaccination children.

Corralling bunch unvaccinated kids together indoors every day school sending home expose families everyone else come contact great way keep transmission going even high percent adults vaccinated. Especially since breakthrough cases likely exposure high, eg. live case (as many parents do).

We’ll still manage living virus years come. things aren’t finished getting better yet. kids start getting vaccinated, see improvements, things get easier manage.  Hit Science Based Medicine look articles black salve. Yeesh. I’ve burnt year now, it’s gotten point almost don’t even bother asking patients they’ve gotten vaccine point.

Yeah feel like 2-5 yo get shot pretty much last hurdle let nature take course.  thinking: tell stay home, supply government job 'ol laptop desktop, pay percentage salary (significantly less). allowed go anywhere, locked homes, must slave government change ways. (I think it'd save government *tons* money long run. 

When they've enough, get vaccines, either get old jobs back, gov't help find new job. 

Done. know much positive is, believe last fall winter (and going forward well) covid really big deal places ample vaccination. Merck Pfizer pills seem promising treating covid home, change game. course there's still worry mutation makes vaccines whole lot less effective. believe me, I'm trying make excuses antivaxxers. Vaccination important tool this, can't help feel sorry countries without monetary means get vaccines Americans let batches go waste. want talk privledge, that's privilege right there. anecdotal, I've noticed major cities suburbs NY far likely people still wearing masks businesses still requiring masks. travel rural parts, that's mostly door now.

Is enough? clue, probably plays part slowing things cities addition vaccine rates booster rates.   Home sweet home. country based? Next - China offers Africa doses nothing... (for exchange trading preference) Correlation causation. Russians really good math, educational system fosters good command. misinformation rampant killing even people there. unwillingness trust authorities, I. Americans nationalities seems common factor. I’m sick anxiety all.

I want go eat inside restaurant friend mine next weekend. I’m triple vaxxed Moderna he’s double vaxxed Pfizer can’t shake anxiety people restaurant probably vaxxed area live in. 

Ugh. know probably okay. But, mind keeps telling get sick.

God, hate this. want go already. Answer: Vermont United States.   concede it’s dangerous large portion society, yet still think vaccine mandates necessary appropriate? Why?

To clear, trying antagonistic. genuinely don’t understand thinking Jack's complete lack surprise.  agree lot PCR tests UK triggered LFTs. heard kids who've Covid recently symptoms sufficient get PCR positive LFT. surprise there. point isn’t getting people change behavior, it’s get people care enough make politician doesn’t prioritize non-starter, pressure corporations stopping it.

Unfortunately half country doesn’t give shit, there’s pressure either.  West Denial Virus, heard savagely coined Twitter. conclusion required study They’re also terrible retracted MATH+ protocol.  UAE got Moderna booster today pharmacist told side effects set boosters faster second dose, fast 3-4 hours. take it’s worth. 

Hoping right, though. Moderna number 2 sent fits vomiting worst headache I’ve ever full day starting 12 hours injection. Six hours dose 3 far good.  What?? None us wanted catch Covid. seems many people someone would have. around people active cases Covid mask (I did) never got pre-vax. So, no, want Covid; do, however, think studies like this. 1980s, A&amp;W tried sell America 1/3 pound burger price competitor's 1/4 pound burger. People buying it, research, found Americans thought 1/3 *smaller* 1/4 3 smaller 4.

[True   count reverse psychology? Get vaccine take supplements “detox” that’ll teach establishment pro-vaxxer disguised anti-vax start lol yet meet antivaxer gets flu shot distrusts covid shot. Nobody ""done research."" pick ""facts"" suit world view. 

I ask one antivaxer got tetanus shot. ""Oh yeah. to. work outside. important get it."" Uh huh. 50lbs overweight cough hour every morning clear lungs, covid threat you? Sure thing, buddy. F G!

Was wondering ""undo"" typo headline! experience here! Except cramping woke night like starting period went away sudden began. I've seen shocking number people right insist JFK — guy proposed Medicare, VRA — would republican today. Almost always argument solely based quote.

I never tell like not. certainly seething hate like basically modern president party.   shit Deer... im worried deer human jump u.s. point. people advising positive test think asymptomatic covid skip booster.

i'm pointing asymptomatic covid cannot counted anything.

you get booster. Thanks info Lol, study needed? Yeah still answer wanted catch it.

I really assume would catch depends details public exactly. like sure thing.

After vaccine probability getting severe case way down... might never get it.  Wild Turkey, turkey, Wild Turkey. Alabama resident here...

Me, parents, siblings, cousins, uncles, aunts.. vaccinated. got vaccinated last spring.

Last living grandparent(he 93) actually died weeks pandemic became full fledged. funeral last event bunch people us to. oh god, shes jail rn I'm talking skipping vaccination, vaccinated. I'm talking public health experts advising talking confusion public health messaging, thanks Australia people vaccinated long 6 months entire population scheduled booster. TBH people get it. Seems lot countries finding surges scrambling boost. Hahahahahaha 

Hehehehehehe

This funny.

Edit: /s

Edit2: really RW nutjobs would rather destroy families, destroy communities, destroy country, destroy everything would let libs win - greatest fear, death poverty People mistake possibility probability time. I'm sick seeing ""well vaccinated people catch spread virus anyway what's point?"" bozo, person vaccinated greatly reduces chances happening. scale one person lots people. Get vaccines important? Silver kill bacteria, help comes viruses. took silver kind vaccine SARS-CoV-2. news article German him, stating suffered organ damage - safe assume took high dose.  think promote idea. Vaccinate everyone “detox”. Yeah, works, that’s ticket yeah. I'm vaccinated, still get tested every day I'm showing office(2 days week currently). huge deal me, mean I'd rather know covid office, well people office. test positive, leave, management knows. going open office back September, someone got covid management decided postpone opening office back everyone. feel like negligent company want test employees, safety issue people. feel comfortable going office knowing people getting tested every day. swear there's group sadistic Muppets somewhere playing game ""what's outrageous thing make plebs believe / do?"". sure ""give math"" quite accurate. combined teaching high stakes test result people thinking math totally arbitrary nonsense without sort underlying rules patterns used broadly. astonishing commonly people (even strong grades) would complain questions test covered class supposedly... Could never tell talking about, apparently presenting problems different way made brand new problems. hi all, questions vaccinated

I got vaccinated (1st shot) couple days ago. got shot left arm, woke yesterday numbing/stiff pain right hand (around pinky ring finger). today worsened, cant lot simple task like vacuum dish's without little painful. someone suggested fell asleep hand night, sure thats bad luck lol 


anyone experience similar heard such? Hahahahha probably developed argyria silver, give person long lasting blue skin usually associated organ damage. 

Another interesting fact, silver actually anti microbial properties, heavy metals, called oligodynamic effect, so, guy might reason ingest silver, completely unfounded actually science behind it.


Ps: I'm doctor, advocate ingestion silver anything else, sick, see doctor. call 2% increase sky rocketing? Vermont doing? article, US whole averaging 50% less cases per day 2 weeks ago...  sure study needed done. Yes, I'm curious history behind origin ""hostpilization"". Get poke, give poke! NeWs WaTeR wEt!!!! Ba Dum tssss Also, mathematics plural therefore abbreviated maths. experience, Americans one them; math. anybody think borders could closed again? would last resort? Manitoban here, measures joke. 

The youth still another month vaccine and/or testing requirement takes effect, requires one dose. might make tiny dent transmission end year. 

But mostly, spreading largely one region pockets abysmally low vaccination rates (lowest 25%). also happen current political party's voter base, government refuses anything effective region almost singlehandedly overwhelms hospitals. travel industry, vaccines mandated? actual likelihood vaccinated child stunted social skills fear everyone around follows adult life? Orders magnitude likely.

*Citation fucking needed
 matter many times try minimize “just piece cloth” talk teachers actually ground. 

It piece fucking cloth fuck teachers ""on ground,"" I'll continue listening scientists, thank you. capable traveling, know? Natural infection unreliable, particularly healthy 25 year old caught asymptomatic COVID. could mostly worthless stimulating immune system. studies average natural infection better vaccination, average age studies 40 average case symptomatic. Studies also show wide response range antibodies natural infection. There's reason believe younger people predominantly respond via innate immune system rather humoral/memory system, asymptomatic infection young person may form little humoral response. asymptomatic also possible high cycle count positive PCR false positive rapid antigen test.

So infection may boosted immune system, may done absolutely nothing all. booster reliable administration known antigen produce much metered response human immune system, bypasses innate immune system much reliably lead formation memory B-Cell T-Cells.

(This also reason allowing people recovered skip vaccination dumb idea -- look case Bill Phillips thought recovered COVID caught nearly died) one country, no? say way MI trending downwards?  never end? Statistics hard. people think chance winning Powerball. focusing cases, outcomes. Focus decreased hospitalization death among vaccinated people get vaccinated. Talk positive outcomes antimoctobial antibodies improved outcomes people seek treatment. Talk upcoming antiviral fewer people die. 

The premise flawed needs change antivax talking points misinformation stems less critically minded thinkers completely ignoring base rates. Saw common argument people citing UK data ~65% (depending random number use 60 70) deaths vaccinated. ignore fact majority deaths elderly, population 95% vaccinated. 5% unvaccinated age group making ~35% deaths fit narrative worldview. Lying giving devil. 
God forbids Covid shots. 
Aparently Satan wants healthy. 

Steal cookie jar blame kid sister. replace toner cartridge work; leave next guy. two types anti vaxxers. making money selling snake oil, fooled. money makers straight scamming people. rest sharing detoxes 'protocols' genuinely concerned about, expect degree feel vindicated. base rate fallacy place. people try correct them, waste time trying educate morons/trolls Facebook.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  “over” mean you? Wow! went confusing system giving real fast. I’m surprised anyone gets passed crawling days. Lol good belly laugh, thanks! Alabama here. gross understatement actual case. typical ICU 35 50 beds occupied coronavirus patients given time, typically one three vaccinated.

I admit dismayed surrounded fucking idiots. stay away churches football games keep distance supermarket, stay reasonably safe.  Especially current guidelines politically based, scientific.  surprised face -_- may slight benefit mixing, probably enough sway you. may simpler stick Pfizer. You’re [in influential literally everywhere! even good math drives crazy constantly see people equate .02% 2% .002%. Like, how?! 😵 Shocking real irony Facebook, posting, poses much greater threat liberty “microchip”. many capitol rioters prosecuted information Facebook. don’t think anyone, anywhere arrested using evidence embedded microchip￼￼. Got tested today, Walgreens saying “delayed action required” test? Isn’t point get results act sooner later? It’s hung insurance shouldn’t absolutely delay processing. McDonald's problem Arch Deluxe. see people compare virus 99.7% survival, .02% mortality rate, 2% mortality rate.... begin realize people understand decimals percentages represented equally matter adding . % whenever wherever want.  Reports STD increased COVID-19. How? Why? No, definitely must believe hundreds thousands people lying.

They may conscious belief, may smart enough understand implications beliefs.

But whole narrative controlled elite working media, COVID-denying news sources would easily turning interviews hundreds thousands health care workers saying ""no, overwhelming outbreak hospital hospital I'm aware of."" Vigilante ""truth seekers"" would trotting funeral home workers, grave diggers, police, shrugging saying ""it's business usual, seen uptick deaths.""


There 500,000 deaths US 2020 2019. average yearly increase deaths previous five years 100,000. 

Hospitals funeral homes every state reporting exhausting, overwhelming numbers body counts.


And yet single conservative news source able show evidence none true. believe wants governments share stockpiles poor countries. quite logical jump ""our ancestors committed genocide"" therefore ""this vaccine government surveillance tool"" evidence ""it could happen...maybe."" I’m Alabama, high risk, haven’t able get booster yet due steriods, WANT OUT. hate people. I've always thought virus likely permanent hides body. One main reasons think everyone willing infected fucking stupid short-sighted shit. standard response heard ""that's less 1%!"" Like....yes, is. helpful determining personal risk dying COVID

... period months... get infected repeatedly, personal risk keeps going up. also terrible risk assessment 4% positivity rate. Iowa still twice that.  walked Costco, appointment, yesterday waiting wife shop (she got booster J&amp;J already). Told marked high risk work office full people (not lie). think places care.  Ok, countries cases going people refuse get vaccinated ;) theory stupid/uneducated/contrarian people everywhere, US that's struggling this. Working retail years pretty enlightened fact long Covid. This! saying forever. Granted, often say ""It's math,"" clearly part problem. Could part due Israel's contract Pfizer using population experiment efficacy statistics?  lot us also warped view what's considered ""healthy"" least America. We're used seeing people guts forget practically 2/3rds us overweight obese. seem like see overweight/obese abnormal, look around, everyone fat must normal. it’s matter time big business gets ahold it, it’s natural path capitalism fever 102 need go hospital    Lol. Hhahahaaaa awhile always sharing percentages lottery rates. 

Like unvaccinated, buy powerball ticket catch covid today, 9 million times likely die covid win Powerball. unrelated, got pfizer booster Wednesday got absolutely knocked ass. well first two doses, either.

I concerned mRNA vaccine leading misfolded protein causing prion like diseases blood clots Good. Fuck fucks. dislike government mandates much next guy making stupid choices affect everyone else get mandates. Tired cowards.  They're bad math, they're bad reading comprehension well. famous one share link along saying ""Masks work!"" except, that's link says. says protection varies kind mask have.  


a lot posts conspiracy subreddit incomprehensible unless already conclusion mind. that's kind fuck up. They're arbiters truth, sifting information find wisdom. already answer, work backwards find info fits think. essentially giant r/iamverysmart none joke. Propaganda?  Ahaha jesus can't believe news, water wet, bears shit woods... 😂 Tbh, Europe deserves everything happening right now. conspiracy rich powerful poison rich powerful first line it. harp whichever metric suits purpose. math issue. mask mandate hurt. fair have, slim none have... Get third dose move on. first doses delta. problem hospitals?

I agree vaccination rate almost certainly helping low hospitalization rate.

But hospital system suffering, make mistake. year half pandemic, largest medical facility really hurting staff. Nurse staffing rough pre-pandemic gotten worse since then.

There's great Seven Days article (non-COVID) patients waiting MONTHS see specialists staffing saying US using COVID vaccine hurt people. used vaccines hurt particular group people US. history get forgotten people effected wasnt long ago. makes hard get truth properly one trusts source.  can't see getting booster stops poor nations getting vaccine? Omg that's good  Texas slightly fewer people dead COVID California does.

And ""slightly"", kidding. 73,249 Californian deaths related COVID-19 vs. 73,113 Texans. long, though - Texas surpass California dishonor matter days. 

But due difference populations, raw numbers, said, misleading. works 1 539 Californian deaths vs. 1 397 Texans. feel like audience understanding exponential growth gut level big problem talking people pandemic.  always like ""why scared virus 98% survival rate"" line

well ruth means go school meeting 100 people covid... two making home. think correlates well actual cases happening. really blowing NEK (oops... I'm /r/vermont... means Northeast Kingdom). happens area lowest vaccination rates. 

I think uptick populated areas may related young, unvaccinated kids school well waning vaccination efficacy (they really open booster shot eligibility everyone).

The tourists largely interacting locals outside public areas maybe family/friends might staying with. also nearly month past peak foliage, yet cases still going up. White Castle went straight 1/18th.  mention quantitative data.

""I trust government"" - makes COVID deniers crazy conspiracy theory relies hundreds thousands people participating hundreds thousands (or millions?) health care workers hospitals, nursing homes, doctors offices across world would lying seeing large volumes COVID patients dying. 

having discussions lot family, believe hundreds thousands lying, believe handful lying working media push propaganda suppress/drown ""truth"". comes Fox/Blaze/OANN, one else stand globalist/socialist (depends talk to, sometimes both) media tell truth.  little basic statistics would nice. require vaccination work go school? would much simpler enforce this.  rather close schools? would much damaging children.

No vaccines approved yet 12s. ""How tall you? 

I'm 5""11.

Wait, height base-12? Nah, time give maths.""

Yeah seems like real progression really sucks ADD another virus ADDS deaths ADDS chances death lol Eventually we'll many viruses we'll born die right away 😄😄😄 s/ go straight 1/8th, call ""The Ocho"", give free dodgeball every meal purchase. We're testing plenty. There's much virus circulation. likely.

There indoctrination university education, social media...oh man. familiar /r/QAnonCasualties? shit rips families apart.   Ok totally understand Thanks this. lot people missing this. Vermont uniform state demographically. counties vaccination rate much line rest country's average. Covid vaccines affect every country planet though. Maybe, *maybe* US could conspiring. every country too?   Last week, witnessed argument two users Facebook. One corrected someone else's percentage (they forgot multiply 100 convert percent), lady went full snob saying correction wrong. specifically discussing local infection rate per 100,000.

Here exact quote person can't math thought you’re arguing you’re even correct. Welcome country represents days. Ridiculous!

And another user, trying explain ""correct"" way finding divided 100,000 .004. Math hard. I’m saying you’re wrong, equation calculator saying wrong. It’s 100,000, 10,000.

She left decimal form. correct answer 0.4%, geniuses kept insisting 0.004% know convert percentages. almost posted /r/confidentlyincorrect never got around it. I've seen stuff like happen repeatedly course pandemic though, always either super basic math done wrong, wrong equation entirely, math person *way* oversimplified. guess: children fueling this.

Yes that's one part it.


The highest case rates still found least (overall) vaccinated counties lot factors play addition, anti-intellectualism feeds making seem people don’t know care stuff much valuable contributor “discourse” expert; CONCERNED. exhausting. Epsilon real named variant.  First detected California, even, significant part late 2020/early 2021 surge southern california.  Largely replaced Alpha february 2021, and, like everything Delta mostly sunk without trace. got vaccines Saturday morning, started chest pain Monday afternoon. Humans can't resist peddling snake oil. indoctrination surfing one's social media feed university education? ""qualitative quantitative"". Examples include:

""A ton people getting fake positive COVID results hospitals make money!""

""Pretty much nobody know even gotten it, let alone died it!""

Equally frustrating people want talk they're logical rational.  feeling Ireland might going way. We've already 2G since July seem like enough. low infection rates relative states whole time, could factor. unvaccinated population wasn’t exposed now, it’s spreading time vaccines might wearing off. According worldometer's 7 day trend :

Cases - 12%
Deaths - 4% Yep. Florida here. got booster tonight. Can't trust one around vaxxed masked   Oh cool, get version! Millennials ages 25-40 suspect great number already teachers. scandal IP upheld people died. Vaccines freely made anyone capacity.   jab way covid one way prevent syphilis.  Add magic blockchain dust baby, got shitcoin going. friend, would say people don’t play poker.

Know hold them, know fold them, know call bluff. 2% LOT people comes death rate, too. annual flu nowhere near that, that's one deadliest common viruses, considering put much time, effort, money developing new vaccine every year. cardiovascular standpoint, bad. 5.3oz 4oz pretty easy understand :troll: Hasn’t like half US caught already? did, loss smell taste week. that, upwards 150 million people?

Using number mine comes survivability rate 99.53. 

Doesn’t take conspiracy theorizing see governments across board making bold power grabs face relatively harmless virus. 

I say relatively harmless smallpox Ebola would TRULY decimate populations...  contact tracing applied ""vigorously"" Chicago. obv. much out-of-area attendees. I'm sure actual number infections higher 300 plus. But, 90 percent attendees actually vaccinated, spectacularly high.

I've Lolla can't even get people gates timely manner many years Chicago? Live Nation problem, Chicago problem. Although Chicago might want concerned crowds size gates people passing waiting get in... 👏🏻 fuck 👏🏻

If know anything justice system, I'd assume made up. totally believe 🤦🏻‍♂️

Did end getting thrown out? Feels like MULTIPLE paths appeal I'd fight broke. get you’re saying, individual citizens EU. don’t deserve it. Ok sign away rights dotted line, know “greater good.”

Old enough remember 9/11, old enough remember gov. overreach justified face “grave danger”.

Look us 20 years later, people literally begging government govern harder.  Yeah, sure part “better” part figures into... like Christians Maybe real vaccine embargoes imposed along way. 55% deaths post Vaccine. nearly 21% since May 11th, american could fully vaccinated. pay treatment. insurance went 20% anticipation unvaccinated ending hospital. compelled take *any* medical procedure, however slight, invasion bodily autonomy. Many people believe bodily autonomy human right, us believe inalienable right endowed Creator.

I’ve worked two years caught once, mildly. I’m talking exposed dozens positive-tested individuals front-lines supplying hospitals equipment. Maintaining strong immune system good way prevent many illnesses 🤷🏻‍♂️

A plastic face shield easier alternative doesn’t violate bodily autonomy. Used one while, I’m fear mongering. There’s thr Bro…it’s almost 2022. There’s access US close 4-5 months. 

Those who’ve succumb covid last southern surge/current northern surge plenty chances get vaccine (apart kids/immunocompromised/physical access etc) whole interaction fuming Imaging media stop debunking treatment, instead pretending try hard dissuade people following it, way sounds like remedy works.  Man, trying explain people buying amount lottery tickets equal odds guarantee win probably taken days life.   Ok politics aside, speak experience “essential worker” that’s blessed financial prosperity madness: logistics sector struggling employ enough labor. 

If get enforced cripple supply chains. That’s one-day Amazon delivery useless plastic consumer goods - it’s delivery life-sustaining equipment hospitals across country world.  Americans: learning algebra statistics? never need it!!!

Same americans: *proceeds math incorrectly* Tests free symptoms. POC tests symptom-free people get certificate prove eligible enter venue limited tested vaccinated. Paying encouraged unvaccinated vaccinate. Alternatively simply allow natural selection occur.  ""I mean obviously difference opinion."" Holy shit, that's terrible.  *Study: Fox Viewers likely believe *insert random thing* Falsehoods easier comprehend first think fact 1kg potato material 1 kg water equal 50% water. Back 80s, Burger King Burger Bundles. adorable! loved them. actual fuck? I'm fully vaccinated can't get booster yet due 6 month rule. impose another lockdown includes vaccinated, adhere it. bioterrorists refuse take vaccine accommodated government way. loved ones likely got mean you’d run exact problem like 1/3 kg steak vs 1/2 kg. problem it?  Much harder politically (and physically) force people medical procedure (even injection) imo  like tell people chance winning Powerball approximately whether buy ticket not, doesnt really help.

Telling even chance winning, would play every week next 550,000 years, sometimes gets through. Yes. person fine fly. basically every subject. really feel news like recent ones Singapore (unvaccinated people paying treatment) step far. government feels strongly vaccination, mandate everyone it. that's possible legally, I'd argue lockdown circumventing law. possible legally politically unpopular, care want political points.  Someone work gonna get 'cained winter, guarantee it. Anxiety induced hysteria self perpetuating problem originally triggered illness. That's really sad actually  agree, try get bogged arguing that, even conservative best-case statistics, it’s *STILL HIGH*. agree data, point means. guarantee none anything 0.1% death rate regular basis. Double 1/8 burger charge $1 1/4 lb burger dislike government mandates much next guy

No Video games, maybe. Something learn gut level. Plague Inc? anyone would need calculator figure tax tip 5, 10, 15, 20, 25% bill ..Jesus fucking help us area.  know threshold seeing bodies piled streets, bet lot less *50 million*. Jesus Christ Agreed. currently live country adults wear masks public spaces. Like get fined you’re without mask yet unvaccinated 14 kids don’t? someone previously living states, makes zero sense. Sometimes I’ve resigned reality may always wearing masks certain situations poor education public health officials people seem defensive masks like them? Also, I’m convinced public health experts even know they’re talking anymore regards mask usage needed. told May fine wear mask. delta surge declined, what, we’re political theater now?  used called 4chan large chunk vaccines readily accessible country share sentiment      Germany McRib also permanent menu least last 25 years so.  sent Email. paper old people without internet. “ban together” assume vaccination rates made actually much lower. presume they’re also triple vaxxed also? understand fear. vaccine scared bring something parents older higher risk. However they’re vaccinated it’s abundantly clear COVID isn’t going away. think many waiting COVID “over” things like go movies, eat inside travel that’s going shake out. live it, best, take healthy risk assessment. triple vaccinated, you’re going fine low chance risk parents. writing .02¢ instead $.02 ugh Luckily terrible math skills countered desire stay inside goo goo gah gah Literacy un-American vast majority epidemics outbreaks zoonotic origin. I'll genuinely amazed covid isn't. 'armless   I'm 9 hours post Moderna booster. Arm sore slight bit feeling lethargy. Time tell get time around.  That's debunks pretty much conspiracy theories: can't rely people shutting fuck up.

Yep, Earth flat. Billions people keeping secret. Sure.

It's bad stupid people can't funny, instead they're also dangerous. I’ve always thought this. It’s reason creationists can’t grasp scale universe—once get billions, eyes glaze over. means nothing. sheer scale billion vs million fucking insane. it’s wonder idea life developing slowly randomly billions years without god directing beyond them. think it’s silly imagine life developing nothing don’t understand fucking long timescale discussing. No, fucking Precambrian organism didn’t suddenly sprout legs one summer’s day walk onto land turn primate within days whatever. Millions upon millions years tiny little actions quirks piled create us. 

And size actual observable universe??? shit bakes *my* noodle relatively intelligent imaginative. Again, wonder people tune never inquire it. personally find comforting know one speck absurdly large tapestry existence, could see de-centering humans certain cultures religions could discouraged.

Bringing back COVID—the idea couple people millions experiencing sort side effect vaccine, versus almost million people US *alone* dying COVID already seems beyond people grasp. Main character syndrome strikes again. Nothing real unless it’s happening observe it.  win math! Would interested guest slot next week's Joe Rogan show? talking governments organizations. Studies lie falsified, otherwise report results. Lol. Dude hardwired ""a quarter"" meant 25 something. 25 cents 25 minutes.

Our education system work. use tutor people introductory course math college. learned quickly reason lot understand current course never really understood basic things math ""passed"" courses high school.

I ended teach fractions division most. commonly memorized enough get really understand fundamental parts it. 

The amazing thing never anyone sit really explain it. stupid people. Many ended seeing single day making feel dumb explaining stuff embarrassed ask help really helped.

They would actually understand Algebra Trig college classes usually stuck connecting things never learned well enough grade school.

Some people know know noticed lot due education system leaving kids behind.

Anyway. End rant.  beginning lied. country done studies get different results. one country says natural immunity lasts longer another says immunity vaccine lasts longer one says shot works variants obvious lie, contradict claim science changed would less problems stuck one set lies.

They make declaration claim fact truth got damn clue. Considering starting business selling foam bath formula, $200 dose, claiming un-vaccinate covid vaccines. also label separate formulas Pfizer, Moderna JJ. Support measles, dtap, polio, etc, coming soon.  think that's pretty much guaranteed point. hit 1 million late next year. doubt lockdown feasible European country point, restrictions don’t seem strict enough mitigate spread anyway. NZ, VN maybe Australia like that, delta creeping basically every country masks part everyone’s lives least extent. *sigh* Yes, *people* going out. **But responsible adults care welfare families society not.** get May June, Florida clearance COVID. badly wanted go antiquing! Well, guess what...I'm triple vaccinated wear N95, damn - I'm going thrift store tomorrow! it. One grand foreigh inside store grocery closing time clinic (work), resurgence. ... seriously worrying somehow. literally basic maths. Classic example black-and-white thinking plagues society. 

“If it’s this, that!!!” conveniently left paragraph then. Every test shows normal organ function researchers running tests detect abnormalities. Anxiety literally thing left process elimination. organ function normal blood tests normal psychosomatic hypothesis perfectly plausible.  Hey covid monstrous fever, make ot go down? also history bronchitis, lungs starting act up. recommendations? considering 'nebulising' water humidify lungs throat. preventable   Good point, that's 10% completely unaccounted for.   30 per 100k current hospitalizations 10-20 deaths per day, mostly among older and/or unvaccinated residents. vaccines definitely work prevent severe disease large number cases still strains healthcare system need preventive admission make sure get right treatment. Yeah right - it’s 50% hospitalisations means amount hospitalisations 10% unvaccinated people 90% vaccinated ones - yeah unvaccinated 9x higher risk. swear, want kill us all.   Thanks this. Huh. called ""Omega"".

There's 85% us got jab, still suffer due remaining 15%. anyone point helpful science based sources talk people take vaccine?
I going actively seek confrontation comes conversation want know talk (gently) refute arguments. depend are? UK say maths, US say math, etc? I'm Swedish eat burgers. They've commercials saying 110 grams, 90 grams 150 grams. think big Mac 2 times 90 grams. deaths hospitalization rates like 85% vaccinated? period masks even social distancing Netherlands. lasted months infection rates all-time high. Yes, numbers dependent initial potato amount. started 0.5/49.5 potato water, get 98% would 0.5lbs potato 24.5lbs water. 

This assuming amount potato cannot change, amount water can. head hurting reading this.. surprised number hits 1 million sometime next year. travesty. pass cost onto them? refuse vaccine safe effective, cost government $10, instead end costing thousands hospital, public burden choice (not even counting onward spread others). pay externalized costs. chance win (among millions chances to) Forget survival rate, consider hospitalization rate cost hospitalization. average cost COVID hospitalization around $20,000. Insurance cover plenty costs insurance government cover, mention pain discomfort wasted time. 

Assuming there's 2% chance hospitalization, really want play game there's 1 50 chance could lose thousands dollars? flip coin 5 6 times, get heads tails, get bad flu lose couple grand.  Thanks sharing data! first glance, think vaccine type (same Pfizer Moderna intervals) weather extremes (one worst things living Singapore hot humid weather throughout year lol). 

One hypothesis heard significant wave prior current one, population nearly zero previous exposure virus might help compensate lack efficacy vaccine infection. 

Another recently, testing even asymptomatic cases definition ""breakthrough cases"" broader think parts US (i.e. get tested symptoms). might also dovetail nicely fact vaccines reduce symptom severity folks may mildly symptomatic vaccination asymptomatic vaccination, picked routine/contact tracing testing. countries places dont wear masks anymore? makes sense.

So could weighed 98 lbs 49 lbs 98%. 

And 99% could weighed 99 lbs 49.5 lbs. Math equity BTFO  Probably help common motivational phrase ""give 110%"". California see 6.9x ratio might confounding variables might skew it. type vaccine make difference Singapore? Perhaps weather extremes make difference? know California worse winter time last 99% 100 = 99/100. 
98% 100 = 98/100. 
98/100 = 49/50. would even implemented ? yep. nailed it.  Government numbers. Probably like 4000-4500. Excess deaths 900k, [The I, Moderna Flucelvax. Gawwwww, shoulders sore! hey, side effects! Awesome! That’s gonna dawg. Cuba enough vaccines. Maybe U.S. donate end almost 60 year old embargo/blockade declared violation international law Charter United Nations almost 30 consecutive years UN General Assembly.  trick realizing reducing *weight water* 1% reducing *proportion water weight total weight* 1 percentage point.

It plays mental shortcuts related percentages changes. Usually think 1% change adding taking away 0.01 something, really that's question asks. Instead uses percentages describe ratio water weight total weight - indirectly non water weight - changes proportion one percentage point (which changes ratio 1:100 2:100, 1:50). Zero math skis required see 98% Feb. 1** wishing visit public places like bars restaurants prove inoculated, recovered virus medical conditions prevent getting vaccinated.

Yup, solid matter change makes us need remove much water small change %. starting 99% water part, 99lbs water ÷ (1lb solid + 99 lbs water) = 99lbs water ÷ 100lbs total = 0.99 99% water. go 98% water need remove water. 49lbs water ÷ (1lb solid + 49 lbs water) = 49 lbs water ÷ 50 lbs total = 0.98 98% water Wow, *some read*! images raw. cases near level (in Florida) month ago. least trying contain it.

Even third dose promised lasting 95% immunization, would need vaccinate around 85+% total population get herd immunity, that's best best case scenario. Statistics mathematics related analyzing real-world data.

**UPDATED 12.05AM** | Added context heterologous vaccinations Thailand. 
 
The Health Ministry defended decision endorse Covid-19 vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech preferred vaccine administering booster shots people previously received Sinovac vaccine. 
 
Moreover, also unveiled proposed plan would see vaccine recipients eventually get Pfizer booster given green light National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA). 
 
Nevertheless, still possible Sinovac vaccine recipients receive either AstraZeneca vaccine Sinovac vaccine third dose approved NPRA medically unable receive Pfizer shot. 
 
“The Pfizer vaccine recommended default priority. Data study Thailand shows same. 
 
“Therefore, go Pfizer unless medical contraindication. course adenoviral platform AstraZeneca Sinovac given considered physicians. 
 
“This something already experienced rollout cannot Pfizer vaccine subsequent allergic reaction given Sinovac. 
 
“Same issues here, go Pfizer first,” said Institute Clinical Research director Dr Kalaiarasu Periasamy press conference Putrajaya today. 
 
The press conference comes amid widespread vaccine hesitancy towards Health Ministry rollout Covid-19 booster shots, especially comes heterologous vaccinations Sinovac vaccine recipients would get Pfizer vaccine booster shot. 
 
“Heterologous” boosters refer giving booster shot different type vaccine used primary vaccination, opposed “homologous” boosters vaccine used. 
 
Health Ministry director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said Sinovac AstraZeneca submitted dossiers apply respective Covid-19 vaccines used booster shots, undergoing review ahead Drug Control Authority (DCA) meeting Nov 17. 
 
To date, Pfizer vaccine vaccine approved used booster shot NPRA DCA. 
 
It currently prioritised healthcare workers, senior citizens 60 years old, residents long-term care facilities, people 18 years old comorbidities, finally people 40 years old. 
 
It later expanded include pregnant women frontliners. 
 
Sinovac vaccine effectiveness plummets 3 months 
 
The boosters administered six months person completed primary vaccination series, except Sinovac vaccine recipients eligible booster shots three months second dose. 
 
Kalaiarasu said Health Ministry Recovam study found effectiveness Sinovac vaccine wanes significantly period. 
 
He said study found vaccine 76.1 percent effective preventing Covid-19 infection period one two months full vaccination, plummets 27.9 percent period three five months full vaccination. 
 
For comparison, study found Pfizer vaccine’s effectiveness drops 88.7 percent 68.0 percent period. 
 
He also presented US data show Pfizer vaccine’s protection Covid-19 infection wanes age groups except 12-15 years old, although four months follow-up data available age group. 
 
Similar Malaysian study, showed effectiveness high 88 percent first month full vaccination falls around 60 percent within five months. beyond five months, effectiveness drops 47 percent. 
 
Protection hospitalisation remains high least 88 percent effectiveness, Kalaiarasu noted US employs narrower hospital admission criterion compared Malaysia. 
 
He said people hospitalised Covid-19 US generally require supplementary oxygen worse, whereas Malaysia also considers risk factors age presence comorbidities. 
 
Kalaiarasu, chairs Vaccine Selection Technical Working Group, also presented data ‘mix-and-match’ studies abroad. 
 
He said data Thailand shows Sinovac vaccine recipients given heterologous booster either AstraZeneca Pfizer shot, produce high levels antibodies would protect Covid-19. 
 
Thailand one earliest countries introduce heterologous vaccinations Sinovac vaccine recipients hundreds healthcare workers became infected despite full vaccination July. 
 
In terms real-world effectiveness, said study Chile saw two million Sinovac vaccine recipients get either Sinovac, Pfizer, AstraZeneca booster. 
 
This found increase vaccine’s protection infection hospitalisation 56 percent 84 percent respectively, extent increase varies booster shot given. 
 
The effectiveness Sinovac booster shot increased 80 percent infection 88 percent hospitalisation, respectively. 
 
The figure 90 percent (infection) 87 percent (hospitalisation) Pfizer vaccine, 93 percent (infection) 96 percent (hospitalisation) AstraZeneca vaccine. 
 
For Malaysia, Kalaiarasu said Recovam study look effectiveness booster vaccine rollout preventing Covid-19 course year. 
 
Viral video ‘outdated’ newer data 
 
Meanwhile, Noor Hisham address video circulating online top officials urged caution ‘mix-and-match’ vaccine regimens. 
 
He said video recorded July evidence heterologous vaccinations still unclear, situation changed. 
 
“So, scientific studies now. far, rollout booster shots namely Pfizer-Pfizer-Pfizer Pfizer vaccine recipients; Sinovac vaccine widely used Malaysia, use Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccine. 
 
“This give better effectiveness 90 percent shown Chilean study. encourage Malaysians: given appointment booster shot, find 40 percent turn appointment. 
 
“We advise come forward get booster dose,” said. 
 
Previously, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin warned uptake booster doses low, Covid-19 hospitalisation rates increase. 
 
The warning comes months-long decline Covid-19 cases Malaysia starts plateau, Noor Hisham urged better compliance standard operating procedures avert surge cases. sorry, closing schools protect children Covid completely unreasonable. cause damage Covid ever will. public health officials many countries say. RSV flu concern Covid.

Is 100 deaths whole US? that's scaled Ireland, means saying stop education 545,000 children prevent one person dying. death unfortunate, reasonable close schools prevent it.

They applied EMA later. Even then, many countries start vaccinating next year. maybe give all, since pose enough benefit them. See UK's impartial vaccination advisory committee endorse vaccinating 12-18 year olds. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I asked realized pregnant fully vaccinated, said also still believes prevent people able get pregnant.

After couple questions regarding became pregnant (which obviously response for) began get defensive dropped it. people insist stupid. r/Iamverysmart  guy telling story obviously drunk.  Really, going make vaccine thing?

Imma head out.  worst part proud bad math (and anti-intellectual). Internet hugs... thankful choice may right available future people distress Fear. Wrongful promises politicians. Lack understanding scientific concepts.
Unfortunately vaccination might enough, non-pharmaceutical measures like masks still needed. people think vaccintion pandemic over, unfortunately isnt. Theres misunderstanding vaccination rates. 50% good 60% on. allow unlimited spread 20, 30, 40% unvaccinated still put huge burden hospitals vaccinated person stroke issues finding quick treatment. CDC quite clear masks even vaccinated incidence higher 50 positive rate 8%. people really think chance? No-one know really expects win ever. like fantasize sure. Well duh ... Lol. 

These situations always make feel Ralph Wiggum 'I'm danger' meme. seems slipping. think combination fatigue, older people got first shots seeing antibodies drop off. hear unfortunately could issues application?

Stopped caring honest.

Had covid back 2020, got vaccinated meantime, ready receive booster available.

What else want us?

It’s happens right spends 40 years denigrating education system create idiots easy control.  Except kid (and others) isn’t yet eligible vaccine don’t really care much happens unvaccinated.

I care enough overwhelm hospitals point loved ones can’t get care non-COVID conditions.

So finally get endemic phase COVID masking helps lower transmission rate.  both. Delta ton virulent wildtype. need antibodies fight off. Israel's studies shown 10-20x improvement third BioNTech shot compared two. CFR Case Fatality Rate. calculated number reported deaths number diagnosed cases. generally gives overestimate mortality due insufficient testing due lack tests (early day US), getting tested due minor symptoms, even knowing tested individual essentially asymptomatic. Due lack availability tests spring 2020, CFR NYC around 5-10% whereas closer 2%

IFR Infection Fatality Rate. ideally calculated actual deaths actual number cases. trick part knowing actual numbers. Looking excess deaths/all cause mortality used estimate real number deaths shows anywhere pretty minor count US large count Russia. actual number cases estimated checking antibody levels population. tricky one really needs get truly random sample population studied. Blood donations frequent source data excludes young old design large subsets population choice. young old tackled specific studies schools nursing homes try fill data, still modeled value end day. brave, cannot say would've committed vaccination severe reaction.  know misinformation spread, reality CDC Biden said, get jabbed wear mask social distance get sick afterwards, CDC says need wear mask social distance one mask, 2 instead. German know could navigate/find relevant info, I'm curious someone point data showing cases/deaths split vaccinated/unvaccinated current wave.

I found article , snippits:

*""According Robert Koch Institute, incidence hospitalizations unvaccinated COVID-19 patients 18 59 currently four times higher vaccinated ones. patients 60, it’s six times higher. ""*

*While jabs significantly lower risk serious illness death, don’t fully protect infection. soaring case numbers, risk getting COVID-19 also rises vaccinated people.* 
 
*""The growing numbers also increasing pressure vaccinated people, portion breakthrough infections miniscule,"" Dr. Falk says.*



What I'm looking info tells us much wave winter effect wave that's still primarily driven unvaccinated whether sign impending collapse vaccine protection. factoring virus once-off pandemic goes away.

Now endemic pretty much comes back every year 45% positive test within fully vaccinated that’s 7000 (7200 exact), almost 8000. 
So that’s 7200 within fully vaccinated, 8800 within unvaccinated group. But…. vaccinated group LOT larger unvaccinated. take entire population, including kids 12, around 73% vaccinated. means 27% population 55% (symptomatic) infections. see problem?? 

And even though lots breakthrough infections, generally mild cases require hospitalization. even vaccinated spreading much seem think do, would huge problem everyone vaccinated. 

Because look hospital admissions gets even worse, especially ICU, 80% unvaccinated, unvaccinated 27% population. BUT… roughly half unvaccinated group children aged 0-12, extremely rarely admitted hospital, statistically irrelevant. staggering 13-14% population making 80% hospitalizations. 
There percentage fully vaccinated end ICU, that’s absolutely true. everyone vaccinated would 2/3 less ICU beds taken COVID patients.    says sorry infecting someone. Exactly this. Minnesota became dotted line (""highest recent average cases per capita"") NYT [Cases graph, expect see.  enough info provided vaccine efficacy getting infected. Glad Singapore playing safe yet J&amp;J 52% protection deaths 8 months recent study veterans. produced effective, long-lasting t-cells fared much better. (Pfizer/Moderna 90% 8 months two doses still). Right!? mention 2% people die COVID, someone 2%. Yes, odds you, someone, someone could you.

This happens time odds given anything. ""Well there's 95% chance true, basically fact!"" No, 5 times 100 true all. all. better terms Covid, fact. Nice chip shoulder there.

40k cases fine, people arent getting ill large numbers continue life normal. asked smaller; 3 100, 8 100 that's .03 .08 represented decimals. Problem is, vaccines aren’t 100% effective - fine, they’re still great! - looking vax/booster/infection acquired immunity figures, scale *effective rate* - much overall protection conveyed 

So population say 70% fully vaxed may ~60% effective population immunity. Add another say 20% prior infections, still leaves 20% susceptible symptomatic illness (higher infection), enough generate wave kind

Add public’s fatigue restricted behavior, virus gonna virus, least one cycle quit Twitter last night misinformation rampant. Every news tweet COVID least dozen replies misinformation, getting me. Twitter needs something it, it’s bloody mental. America plenty vaccines available, well masks,and tests know works,but instead ignore ""live best lives"" watch ignorance headed way months..
Most country pathetic. didn’t need “at math” portion title. looks like deaths 13 per day spite opened completely. Without vaccines number would probably triple digits. False equivalency. Faux News pushing doctrine American's heads decades. No, one side 90% lies hypocrisy. Afaik people get infected covid spread regardless symptomatic asymptomatic, test positive virus spreading body.

The true immunity spread immunity asymptomatic infection, body prevents infection taking root first place, pretty hard attain vaccines.  Yes educational system allow kids held back failed districts. Huge disservice kids. result kids make enough effort understand work. would say lack common sense way much confidence mixed hint ignorance. bad math spreading misinformation. perform well. general guideline stick whichever one already got possible. prefer switch, it’s fine, you’re going gaining losing anything anybody discern juncture. Fwiw, half dose moderna still almost twice dose Pfizer, sayin. Certainly, metric convention would 330g vs 500g versus using fractions. Signed $5 recurring. Easy enough.  Oh yea. Another British trait good old times hundreds years ago. always think better countries entire world. Hahaha.

About 40,000 cases, 200 deaths every day. fantastic. Keep up! Can’t transmute water potato’s…yet


have met Irish Jesus? …***willfully*** awful math.  
That’s kicker. headline two words long. think least optimism things getting better based vaccination rates + previous infection, I'm beginning think perhaps experts predicting overly optimistic. many people this, gathering etc. guess we'll know couple weeks Thanksgiving. Get vaccinated. Get New York, Pennsylvania several parts region, rural counties appear driving state-wide numbers, metropolitan areas -- including New York City -- holding somewhat better. Last year’s autumn wave also started rural areas eventually engulfed cities. However, many Northeast cities since outperformed rural areas vaccinations. top that. Substitute teacher here. 7th grader tell 1x1=2 . Told 1+1, still said 2. calculator. Told broken showed answer 1. 
9th grader 2x3 LAST WEEK needed calculator. quit job 15 years reasons. Yes country doomed.  cut 18 pieces glue pair back together. Considering better countires entire world im sure get info from. restrictions whatsoever absolutely danger things going wrong moment. plenty ways express it, burgers US tend listed fractional pounds.

One favorite burger places named “8oz burger bar”, far exception silly convention. best part folks confused ordered huge half-pound burger unit conversion even harder fractions. here. Vaccines stalled around 50%. Mask wearing adults stores 10% nearly nonexistent teens children. overwhelming attitude towards children masks always ""kids exempt"". local events activities taking place distancing, full crowd capacity, masks optional. overwhelming attitude ""if concerned, wear mask get vaccinated, rest us care"". result hospitals, urgent care clinics, outpatient imaging centers, freestanding emergency rooms running close capacity Covid patients people post-Covid complications. Yes let’s blame Americans stupid gullible leaders nothing stop spread misinformation hateful rhetoric pumped 24/7 since Reagan got rid Fairness act. America needs 2/6 burger understand Many Americans awful reality. math. people get mad people simply say see uptick cases deaths winter I'm little confused Eric Topol's claim couple days NYTimes media misinforming people saying ""unboosted"" COVID vaccines still offer strong protection severe COVID. I've seen breathless reports waning protection general infection, impression protection hospitalization/death still quite strong.

Looking NY States COVID dashboard track breakthrough cases/hospitalizations/deaths pick notable drop symptomatic infection protection, decline protection severe incidences. 90+% effective hospitalizations without major wavering. 

A quick search pulls study Pfizer published Lancet:

*""Vaccine effectiveness hospital admissions infections delta variant ages high overall (93% \[95% CI 84–96\]) 6 Topol considers simply getting COVID ""severe"" situation, otherwise know he's about. get impression scrolling feed he's basically ""3 shots bust"", fine want folks get boosters, feel he's crossed line.    Same. My. God. actually living Idiocracy already. great idea many levels! 

Unvaxxed likely get seriously ill covid 

Unvaxxed likely catch spread covid 

No jab? OK enjoy four walls home.

👏👏👏 Told didn’t know long term effects /s WTH? No. cannot go crazy. vaccine booster 100% protective magic shield. vaccine's job ""prevent serious illness hospitalization"". Come journalists, please. two years now. Certainly learned little bit effectiveness percentages vaccines actually now? mean stadiums full people ? cause surge  Got it…hopefully story cause Alabamians (why isn’t Alabamans?) get vaccinated. would complain two mortality rates different numbers significant figures - needs 0.99975 compared 0.99950. Also need error bars p-values. Yes, people know basis math. bar used work at, people would ask draft beer would say, ""a pint 22 ounce?"" people would blank look face say, ""the bigger/smaller one!"" received beer would say, ""oh smaller (when ordered pint)/larger (when ordered 22 ounce) thought!"" clue ordering. would ask, ""What size pint?"" Anecdotal evidence evidence, unfortunately. proper studies show rate 10% ""consistent production port shut downs?""

What talking about? Anecdotal evidence evidence, unfortunately. proper studies show rates around 10%.  half hospital cases Finland already breakthrough cases. Notice however means normal hospital care, ICU. ICU odd individual vaccinated persons.  gone. last two words sentence seem somewhat superfluous.  weather? gotten colder compared rest US ? know Fall pretty warm northeast. people aren’t going get vaccinated… living means rest us move safely live continue roll dice. 

We can’t keep holding everyone back protect people won’t protect themselves. assume politics. I'm you. Good. Let's stomp virus end winter finally live normally again.

A realistic sentence would ""Let's stomp virus end **decade** finally live normally again.""

[See infections entire sine wave keeps going on. seeing Concerts bars packed, winter see surge question whether another variant will
emerge make worse. could left ""at math"" Yeah think point, haven’t already it’s matter time. like odds get it. know problem seeing numbers rise. partly it’s refuse allow folks control live. They’ve made personal choice risk assessment made mine. think idea still going sort collective effort, well, places USA ship sailed. Nope, got that, too. joking Apart wants go ahead get it. didn’t adverse reaction first two Cut center edge. Eight slices 11% one 12% Big bummer thanks sharing. guess want breakthrough COVID. Or, could continue taking sensible precautions transmissions high. Western slope, Mesa County, high daily positive numbers, around 100 per day. Nobody cares. Vaccination rate 51%, may go little higher kids getting vaccinated. play expected value you’ll eventually come ahead! basically Texas/Oklahoma, California.   I'm sorry, current Zero Covid policy? topic conversation.

 Identifying sequencing virus problem US anyways, common simple technology, developed mostly US. problem conspiracy theorists.  great academic example is:

- There’s disease affects 1 100,000 100% fatal
- test 99.99% accurate 
- get positive test. do?

The answer tested again, you’re 10 times likely false positive actually disease. 

{{How many tests needed 95% confidence rate left student.}}  Exactly - oz sounds small, pounds sound big, order half pound burger, might order 8 oz burger without realizing size. problem fractions - know ratio (or calculate ratios) - eek. ""hardship"" fraction people, compared large Chinese population past also find hilarious point! true Covid declared endemic, means point it’s stay. Tho course won’t always stay big threat daily lives, it’s getting eradicated. concerning “living normally”, I’m pretty sure developed world kinda already reached point outside maybe show covid pass eat restaurant fly plane. Tho ironically know I’m thread Austria putting unvaccinated people lockdown. ""Double quartered"" implies 1/8 even 1/16 since quarter twice. McDonald's website called ""double quarter pounder"". Jesus write police report 🤷 YES! 6 months, get booster. I'm 25, health conditions, second shot date also April I'm getting booster tomorrow morning.

CVS deems eligible 6 months. ""but 35 bigger 8"" nothing mattered, think ultimately care reason fix cuz knew afford real lawyer.  Ok confused responded post risk age group citing days, thought intended reference rates. Yes, lot people overall. would say groundbreaking unimportant different things. 

If something done half many people die certain procedure treatment course, probably important enough people know consider it, even overall numbers small. hundreds thousands procedures, still many people surviving. play waltz  masking reasonable, one social distancing anymore. popular beginning pandemic, months everyone said fuck shit. fkn stupid, governments organizations going wake start recognizing natural immunity level least immunization vaccination. Policy far behind scientific data now, frustrating. I’m looking deaths that’s huge number it’s sad. understand per 100,000. Thanks. Yet another example destruction courts Heritage Foundation working Trump. Vaccine mandates settled law. do. 

You're claiming people buy lottery tickets vaccinated smoke drive they're bad math. based nothing prejudice.

I sometimes buy ticket, I'm getting third pfizer shot end year... Well broke, yeah, took deal got 6 months felony jail time. 4 years continuances 3 different public defender's gave up. Public defenders give fuck. timeframe China noticed, identified, reported, sequenced virus, figured dangerous began lock Wuhan down, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence 9 states US 1.1%. Worse yet, every time brought-up, people still argue 1/4 bigger 1/3. I’m curious know percentage Colorado infections breakthrough. Colorado done pretty well vaccine, relatively speaking, there’s still roughly 40% unvaccinated. That’s lot folks fully susceptible. Younger people better immune systems, covid vaccines protect longer period time, top less often face severe infection. Waning happens faster older people immunocomprimised. Boostering might become necessary longer time period older people. evidence gathered, follow CDC advice. situations even younger people adviced get booster now: Get booster. BMI 25, ever smoked tobacco product even once, depression anxiety qualify.  basics, always easy me. Understanding cooking measurements also helps. mother taught basics cooking young age. 

And holy balls, scale. scales literally work mention bosses (at least good ones) know employees hard time grasping put charts employees.

I've people ask ounce amounts (ie 8) attempts confuse get 1/2 pound issue. Plead out, public defender yes worst lawyer imaginable. also ""forgot"" tell court date warrant arrest one point skipping. people know hesitant vaccine think dangerous getting COVID itself. Statistics absolutely standard part education country calculus. get high school diploma without basic statistics course. It’s almost like poor education leading large amount problems US facing spouse MD basically mindset. I’m still thinking terms never getting Covid point impossible — eventually I’ll get it, like cold thanks vaccines boosters. ...do know posted? Well actually, A&amp;W recently released [this instant classic] pleasure, happy help. good majority people know dreaded math high school. one pretty good it. People would care took free vaccine I’m tired making sacrifices people refuse protect I’m going stop. confused booster guidance. 30 years old got Moderna vaccine back Feb March. parents 60 got booster week. wondering go ahead get it. state (GA) released guidance see Cali Colorado authorizing boosters adults 18.

Any clarification would helpful. story always amazes Well said. actually common core math trying rectify, teach concepts kids aren’t learning algorithms without understanding why. lot people grew algorithms make fun it. 🤷‍♂️ (See investors presentation) that’s exactly want hear 🙄 This, “And week, sparsely populated Kings County, one California’s lowest vaccination rates, one state’s highest per capita COVID-19 hospitalization rates.” later this, ““We kind feeling like forgotten area California read that, statewide, things improving,” Gary Herbst, chief executive Kaweah Health Medical Center Visalia, told Times. “It’s like we’re almost different country, even though right middle state.” 🤔🤔🤔 No, spreads Facebook algorithms foreign troll farms.  top head, vast majority US, UK, Albania, Macedonia, Eastern Europe. simply getting booster shot sick got 2nd dose. can't healthy get sick vaccine laid week. think probably combo vaccine hesitancy level exposure high risk situations. People age still gathering socially, unlike younger groups protected much.

Also, accurate way look data deaths rates per 100,000. Why? (This question you, politicians) speak (and loudly) 13 hours day clinic wearing KN95 mask. find idiotic lower one's mask cramped bunker. (Sorry, Prime Minister, thought smarter.) Singapore, guys pretty much everything right handling Covid honestly sucks guys get put high risk section, there’s countries didn’t handle well put “safe” list. I’m stunned jump 50. believe see ages HCA sub. Except Colorado. getting absolutely hammered right now. They’re trying figure out. 75% article pure BS. read 40%. ""One Australian Facebook group 6,000 members... promotes multi-level-marketing spray product seller claims..."" 

Of course, MLMs involved. hun wants sell products. No, no. double-*quartered* pounder: one-pound burger cut quarters once, cut quarters again.

Pre-cook weight. Well using previous comment jumping point post, yes, use 50 cutoff instead, somebody younger 50 lower chance death 1% average. wondering sounds like received day? Idk sure though. Might save lot hassle putting decimals instead fractions. It'll hurt inside. Maybe even cost little printing menus. wow, amazing many kids made adulthood without grasping this. :/  read Australia saw tag Europe like something wrong need commission studies. could told conservatives lack critical thinking skills.  Belgium traveling around within Schengen. People still wear masks, number goes day. Honestly Europe could barely tell pandemic still digital covid pass checked enter restaurants. that’s places like France, Belgium, Netherlands experience. Netherlands less others. Finland week covid pass checking all, barely masks worn outside like public transport. Masks always recommended never required. frankly tired people legitimately scared act saviors mankind sorrounded selfish herd. Last spring everyone legit thought pandemic well. Plus district vacinated kids required quarantine. Abstract 
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected 231 million people globally, 4.7 million deaths recorded World Health Organization 26 September 2021. response pandemic, countries (New Zealand, Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea others) pursued suppression strategies, so-called Zero COVID policies, drive maintain infection rates close zero possible respond aggressively new cases. comparison, European countries North America adopted mitigation strategies (of varying intensity effectiveness) aim primarily prevent health systems overwhelmed. recent advances understanding SARS-CoV-2 biology, increasing recognition COVID-19 beyond acute infection, offer perspective long-term risks mutational escape, viral persistence, reinfection, immune dysregulation neurological multi-system complications (Long COVID). guess 80% population COVID antibodies end winter. Either vaccine infection. staples It’s okay, think we’re little Lloyd Christmas sometimes. is:
the probability randomly picked person given population addicted heroin 0.01 percent (the base rate). person selected heroin addict, 100 percent probability person fresh needle marks arm (the sensitivity element). However, also .19 percent probability randomly picked person fresh needle marks arm even heroin addict (the false-alarm rate). probability randomly picked person fresh needle marks addicted heroin (the posterior probability)? 100% effective solution right ready go. expect states follow colorado recommend boosters everyone next weeks. children incredibly low risk Covid missing education significantly damage. one get first two shots? Colorado checking in. running ICU beds governor refuses introduce mask mandate would protect unvaccinated weeks. He's pushing boosters qualify booster moment? e.g. 6 months since second dose

I'll add masks unpopular he's running re-election next year. *sigh* critical majority people died pre-vaccine too, tbh. politicization pandemic mitigation meant almost half country refused mask up, maintain social distance, isolate without mandated. even mandates, compliance awful country; mostly along political lines. potato paradox problem high school math competition went (yes I'm nerd) im glad say got right :) 100% this, also ton state wide restrictions even now. belive Illinois Oregon state wide mandates, sure even immune potential election consequences.

There county local level mandates while, expect lot drop mid terms well.  Freshman Stats class one first problems professor covered. small odds winning lottery be.   Honestly Europe handling whole ordeal , coming.  Delta became dominant variant (in US) July and, since then, deaths unvaccinated Americans. direct answer question is: ""The overwhelming majority them."" 

Source: metric tape measure invaluable things like hanging pictures. Figuring proportions snap metric, much inches. bet can’t even understand ***Percentage*** is. keep using meme ***low chance*** dying COVID is, trust “immune system”. put quotes even clue immune system works. little late almost 2 years pandemic… minimum, Pfizer lower doze general, AFAIK Moderna booster lower doze vaccine original 2 shots. Still work doctor make best health decisions you, go it, bit luck bad originals.   price 1/5th? *More* value!  Good much better me, happy now? isolate  never going gone. dealing new respiratory virus join circulation viruses flu cold. adapt fact means going accept toll virus take. mean let healthcare system collapse. flu average kills 10 -60,000 Americans per year. Add another virus higher mortality rate going expand healthcare capacity accomodate it. OP spreading misinformation.  selling 3/9lb burger, homage said don't. opinion spread bc feel safe go anywhere see anyone That's everything possible contract it. ffp3 masks closet come handy. ffp2. Can't wait booster. enough. I'm still hoping complete ban unvaccinated air travelers. Want fly? Take shot. Goddamn we're stupid society. also masks. third time I've gone Hell-mart two years masked people cashiers. Even worse, 2 employees wearing loose neck scarves.

The one time went pick Covid test someone, guy said he's rather wearing mask. 

There's 100 bed facility went 2 positive 15 3 days. 

The denier, anti-vax train sat station time. every year ailments kill tens thousands. vaccines boosters well underway hopefully avoid horror last winter. can't seriously expect people however put restrictions indefinitely. fatigue absolutely understandable. not, least shouldnt be. ideally, government wouldve stepped earlier enacted smaller measures like masks, social distancing, better enforcement qr codes, wfh, etc wouldnt reach point, least quickly. fifth sixth time dutch government waited last moment intervene, things arent going cut it. shouldnt keep needing lockdowns, also wouldnt knew meaning words 'proactive' 'exponential growth'. feel like part guidance tobacco use… it’s like, dude don’t qualify yet go get ten dollar pack smokes, chief one up, take two puffs throw away. give rest pack smoker go get booster. Even ten bucks it’s great price third dose haha. rare? Massachusetts. Let's real. I'm double vaxxed, N95 masks indoor places staying butt home. work rn. Brings mind old funny Letterman joke: 

“USA Today come new survey: Apparently three four people make 75 percent population.” that's say lies, damned lies, statistics. Coronavirus misinformation spreads easily US government counts getting run bud shot cops ‘covid death’ 

While rest world counts ‘deaths covid’ like sane people Funny took forever act Covid thinking China transparent infection numbers. 

They called pandemic, vs acting like contained China Yes I'm saying, that's people approach it. assume anything. CDC link says unvaccinated around 13 times likely die covid vaccinated. Hey, ask glue pizza. I've heard people basically say like god planted fossils test us trick something. they're questioning scientists explanations necessarily, scientists fundamentally misunderstanding issue. Like imagine world actually created 6000 years ago powerful god. would theoretically possible god trick people age fossils, right? story, scientists collectively knowingly deceptive, also wrong. Green Hornet's sidekick (Bruce Lee) Kato. complicate simple example, many people think “survival” means get you’re fine get normal life. chose ignore many people get virus left long-term effects (some serious).  winter going terrible Europe. Talking sick dead. Greetings Netherlands. like idea slider I'm always wanting try smaller portions different things. works best got lots options. liked Arby's sliders could choose roast beef, pepperoni, turkey, etc. it’s national shame embarrassment. def surge winter.

People see this, that's problem.

People embarrassed ashamed.  They're rEaDY GeT BaCk NoRmAL. waited 2 hours line freezing cold get vaccine later told us dont vacs, fuck country theyre wondering noone wants vaccinated.
and putting free tests behind paywall another facepalm. ""The main lesson is: Move fast, move hard.""

If only. hard imagine virus lethal enough would spur U.S. government, least, adopt approach. Maybe airborne Ebola? Oh no. enough Texas/Oklahoma Texas Oklahoma?  I'm saying customers are, fact, responsible (both morally causally).  

There’s one article. throughout Asia, China included, ports factories capacity anywhere close 100% due COVID outbreaks, COVID policies and/or energy shortages due shit Chinese energy policy. personal choice lead people getting sick possibly dying. ....Wat? know terrible math, damn! *THAT* bad! heard warm cow dung mild paste rub chest detox kept 48 hour period. Oh Oh, hope start trend! think salient question “will vaccinated people give sh-t see winter surge?” based behavior I’m seeing answer “no”. Which, right wrong personal decision one think unless variant emerges truly renders vaccines useless, extremely deadly kids, something similarly shocking, vast majority USA moving (and good sized swath never cared day one add there). places seem political hold line, especially election year approaching. Hell even NY governor talking getting rid school masks mandates kids get shot, etc., state serious Covid opinion. clear, I’m seeing, I’m advocating anyone live certain way. No, covid misinformation spreads many Americans awful.

(I say it, I’m American) forget poor reading comprehension too. Assuming #s right, issue *have* pick 1:200 game 1:3000 game, seems pretty obvious one pick. reference, men age 45 women 52 already playing 1:3000 death game year (pre-covid):   Here's good read like context. hamburger seems made jump plate bun last decades 19th century, though site transformation highly contested.

I've told take nsaid, cause history lung issues. I'm respecting dosage too, 3 per day fourth fever getting high. Yeah it’s two years. much time u expect ppl hold on? wear mask got vaxxed im taking liberties days 52.8 billion U.S. dollars spend military 2020 nothing free tests since start pandemic? travesty.  “I’m vaccinated believe it’s personal choice shouldn’t mandatory” Republican code “You stupid it’s important live”.
If really cared people would actively push vaccines. 8th grade math teacher, understand completely. First, USA, dedicated math teachers teaching elementary students. many teachers teaching elementary school students fundamental concepts understand well themselves. Secondly, time get certified math teacher (7th grade state), teachers beholden many different standards taught assessed, time go back address fundamental elementary concepts. So, give calculator fractions decimals understand algebraic concepts required NEVER get good understanding fundamentals!  Wow much shock Except Russia large portion population unvaccinated government handled public distrust. chance winning buy ticket, buying one fine understand dropped cash entertainment that's unlikely return profit. problem expect return... another scam dummies. líes spreading get soon. frustrating! Gosh. almost like need stricter laws unvaccinated.  Exactly this. Functional illiteracy bigger problem shitty math skills.  way prevent this! unvaccinated die recover, decreasing risk towards general population time, right? 😉🙃 Delta dashed hopes achieving heard immunity: R0 high, going happen. I’m hesitant get booster rough time moderna shots. side effects lasted 2 months ended seeing several specialists ongoing dizziness muscle issues. 

I don’t regret getting vaccinated I’m going thorough consultation doctor getting another jab. Nah, put 1 1 together. It’s 11. That's really huh. Extension closed border policies, wasting millions following bad science, promoting conspiracy theories regarding virus origin. minor hardship pipe dream goal zero Covid. Big true, took 40 years come idea? technically true, recommend living one's life philosophy ""hope best, prepare nothing"". fact **a** chance valid ticket. people routinely fail understand mechanics droplet spread masking… it’s complicated people simply refuse cannot grasp it. truly befuddling. pisses most. Every anti vaxer personal knows spouts shit like ""id fight die country/rights"" etc yet putting piece fabric somehow much..


Im done feeling bad them. Agreed. US 81.1% adults 79.2% people aged 12+ least 1 dose. think see stronger community resistance towards end year, numbers convert fully vaccinated stats. numbers even better northeast able keep delta surge control, previous alpha surge winter. Mask everyone, least end year... keep covid transmission crowded indoor public locations control.   got Moderna, too. second shot horrible effects lasted 11 days. keep scheduling canceling booster appointment worried going again. reaction worse actual bout COVID.  always taught metric imperial school. COVID one hate bomb. way kind others expense, something they’re willing do. Games

If something like happens, I'll blow brains out. Everybody know LA says bars normal walk mask. I’m sure places enforce it, it’s show. way worse nyc, bars packed. Doubt we’ve forgotten bad was, maybe we’re reasonable here?  anyone suggestions could help 15 year old get vaccinated without parental consent? One kids friends wants vaccinated mom allow it. Oregon law 15 year old need parental consent vaccination, however seems applies doctors administering vaccines pharmacies. local pharmacies I've contacted say need parent them. could obviously pretend parent seems questionable... 

Going doctor concerning went doctor would medical records mom could find out. another doctor would likely see without parental consent. We're also concerned showing insurance info her, insurance claim filed, mom could find it. 

Any suggestions might pull off? went war 9/11 . Yet remember time basicly 9/11 day due covid.  Moderna *Covid misinformation spreads many Americans awful. government organizations lie guilty falsifying reports, Fauci openly admitted lying claims good.

 extensive NBC training military, much idiots telling public contradicts training military biological agents common sense says lying things, claim vaccine works new strains vaccine works need make new vaccine new strains maintain protections one reasons new flu vaccine every year, also KN95 masks like class 1 body armor, worthless point blank help longer ranges, words contagious person standing beside infect mask help farther away 6 feet far enough, actual viral rated filter wear hard breath also putting mask beard facial hair work. happened 20%? What's study showing vaccine efficacy drops 91% 0% day 211 (pfizer 0% 211, vaccines around 45-65% 6 months)? Huge swedish study. still preprint, lancet (#6 ranked medical journal world--meaning, easily discardable research). outlier? data have? Dose Five: Gain superpowers expected   ...or incapable critical thinking, like Aaron Rodgers. Help I’m stuck reCAPTCHA loop can’t get D: Thanks They're rEaDY GeT BaCk NoRmAL.

And alternative exactly? Kidnap anti-vaxxers torture basement finally break decide get vaccinated?  Controversial opinion here, would gladly support safe fake treatment ""detoxing"" vaccination meant people children got vaccinated.      borderline child abuses (if cannot count full-blown ones) human rights violations ""minuscule"" you? person allergic vaccines basically can't live must vaccinated buy food, seek medical help access essential governmental services?

Hundreds thousands people died US alone. Nearly 150k American children lost parent. difficult wrap one's head around numbers, scale tragedy immense. imagine stressful child parent quarantine two weeks, infinitely stressful lose parent CoVID-19. simply can't compare two. level suffering US entirely different level China experienced Zhang Zhan, reporter first exposed Covid disaster Wuhan

It's terrible government locked up. However, expose outbreak Wuhan. went Wuhan *after* outbreak became common knowledge (1 February 2020, week lockdown began) pretty uninformative vlogs (and got confrontations medical workers, refused comply infection control measures, like temperature checks). watch vlogs judge think faults failures made governments Western countries reason believe China better job, think again.

China orders magnitude fewer deaths per capita US Europe, people's daily lives far less impacted. rightly criticize Chinese government many things, there's question handled pandemic better US Europe. US literally lost population entire state. Muslim invaders killed many people, you’d better believe Republicans would furious.  dub Quarter Pounder Theorem really called?  mean spreading disease? I'm fully vaxxed I'm aware still carrier thus really go anymore. saying unvaccinated sole reason virus spreading. They're absolutely not. Everyone spreads it, vaxxed not.  “We’ll never use algebra calculus statistics probability,” said.

They didn’t killed them. **145.6 vaccinated cases per 100k** week 10/24, median age 46.

**559.6 unvaccinated cases per 100k** week 10/24, median age 35.

**4.1 vaccinated hospitalizations per 100k** week 10/17, median age 73.

**39.6 unvaccinated hospitalizations per 100k** week 10/17, median age 58.

Breakthroughs aren’t driving surge, unvaccinated people are. 71% fully vaxxed\* problems 3 Pfizer vaccines.  effectiveness month booster tested positive. Luckily symptoms bad. like bad cold. Still recovering.  Glad triple vaccinated. can’t just, know, make vaccine.

So, happens people require boosters every 6-8 months, happen vaccines can't made?     No, spreads many Americans stupid hell. lot restaurants enforce taking mask tables only, people L.A. mostly comply remember bad was. We've lost 25,000 people hospitals morgues overflowing last winter. one wants see again.

Just someone ass take mask they're supposed mean everyone will, people's cooperation means less transmission. Please post links Discord server. check official Discord server menu tab.

Colorado never really delta surge. Honestly summer people rarely congregated indoors Colorado, makes sense. Masks mandates etc pretty much dropped. 

Weather finally started getting colder month ago, that’s cases started rising. 

I expect vaccine requirements restaurants/events soon. Based personal experience, it’s pretty loose ny  Covid misinformation spreads many Americans awful ~~at math~~

Oblig. FTFY one week since received third dose Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. received booster show slightly eight months received second shot Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. 

With three shots, fatigued, sleepy. second shot gave worst side effect, followed third shot, first shot. know said KNOW how. guesses got thought? kind mask use? long booster caught it? post-viral illness that, stop trying degrade lived experience based “I took pre-med courses once.” biomedical system destroys vulnerable people. Everyone know double-vaccinated one person breakthrough case. group us even stayed together AirBnb sick covid(+) person none us vaxxed caught it. Perhaps mean thoughts free constraints objective reality.  Sorry, said western NY State “Anxiety literally thing left.”

That absolutely untrue — fact something can’t detected limited testing methods biomedicine doesn’t mean it’s psychological origin. ridiculous I’m sure can’t even actually believe that. 

This myth confines millions people, disproportionately women, lives stigmatized suffering. source much medical neglect abuse.  You’ll also smaller viral load vaccinated, helps lot preventing spread.

Because even though don’t understand it, least familiar them, one trying change something.

Weird. good chunk falls Biden CDC well. well may end Trump adjust quickly. studies different. one South African study closely mirrors one.

Realistically likely never know. many studies used 15 days J&amp;J best 58 days. Many early doses given immunocompromised people slow burn nature seems better B cell response vs straight early antibodies would leave effective people decent immune systems time less without.

Given easily get booster get whatever doesn’t matter much point. LMAO yes Sounds like something *you* discuss *your child's* child psychologist.

Anecdote data—the data support claim masks harm kids. UW said already million. bad America isn’t following footsteps :(    walk around freely? so, what’s point mandate, theater? blame people like Rush Limbaugh instills fear distrust experts listeners. FEAR.

Get vaccinated. Vaccinate kids. Stop hand-wringing people can’t control. stop reading clickbait CNN. zhan
Lmao, serves right trying harass contact tracers. May rot jail   Thank you. number I'm interested in. Sure great people one shot and/or natural immunity, know that's enough. Also look state state numbers get clearer picture pandemic. We're right track, problem enough people onboard train. end school masking Jan 1st then? Lol numbers don’t lie true. barely find police streets actually, arrived trouble, find murderer, whatever, say checking masks.
I guess busy throwing drugs, torturing beating people. grossly overestimate importance US rest world. people outside country give shit Americans do, think say. number rounding error, best.    repeated unfounded claim yet another time, believe you. Good info. Awesome! ended hospital week third. knew would happen eventually mymast cell issues, grabbed every goddamn antibody could get meantime. keep getting boosters, might give try. difficult tell someone something GED. Typically mean dropped highschool point get basic Math, English Language skills.   literally generations soldiers. waning days Trump administration, mid-November early January, United States experiencing equivalent deaths COVID one 9-11 happening **every day**. take account many died. Yeah important number. We’re anywhere fucking close herd immunity Imagine United States? 

You’d revolution stupid hands. Nooo....keep wiping arse ...or die ..simple  think implication infections disproportionately impacting Hispanic communities, seems accurate look dashboards.

The recent Last Week Tonight segment misinformation points foreign language media channels targeted reaching audience particularly vulnerable curious much impact communities.  got Pfizer booster afternoon got mine Rite Aid week ago, asked pharmacist qualified. said ""I'm obese."" (borderline, counts) apologized ask all. 

My right arm sore flu shot left Moderna booster - gotten Pfizer seven months earlier. Here's hoping mix match works well.  Go ahead get it. I'm 20s got last week I'll visiting family soon. like there's shortage right now, lots people GA refusing get vaccinated anyway.     That's right. safe. glad live Australia home state (NSW) well 90% fully vaccinated (over 16s). bad Delta outbreak June accelerated lagging vaccination programme (thanks lack supply, hesitancy) we've got cases 200-300 per day yesterday recorded zero deaths first time since August. heading summer. medically exempt taking vaccine? put lockdown too? Either way disgrace arithmetic correct. reading comprehension logic problem.  make stupid choices, someone else tell do. get used feeling you’re dumb enough get vaccinated face overwhelming evidence you’re likely life full dumbass decisions.  well-qualified numbers. 

More saliently, [57% US population fully got Pfizer March first two, flu vaccine August, Pfizer booster yesterday. Feeling like trash today, like first two, I'll whenever new boosters approved.

I'm still disappointed *carry* keys can't stick go. Clearly dislike gov mandates Fair enough
Thx sources? think lot people regularly get tested job (my dad’s pilot &amp; whole company vaccinated everyone still gets weekly tests) precaution (i’m school pretty high transmission rate while)  I’m little dubious claim hospitals can’t handle current patient load, may able continue increase sustained period

*Generally*, healthcare system work though 10% increase patient load short period without sacrificing basic care. Now, baseline vary greatly jurisdiction based capacity, level care/insurance provided, population age, etc (in US roughly 200 patients/100K, +10% = 20/100K)

Given last 18 months, hospitals may seeing burnout &amp; reducing staffing levels, leaving less slack system surge, potential flu season rebound worry top COVID increases

The tl;dr - despite downvotes above, I’m “just let rip” guy. also need focus matters: cases hospital usage, setting thresholds level “tolerable” requires intervention Especially Trump  There's thing bad math. Math difficult practice understand concept. Unfortunately way education system works students slower learners (not fault, everyone learns different paces) held back federal funding statistics concept child left behind, pushed bare minimum pass arbitrary barrier says passed, without taking account much student actually learned. Math like building blocks need strong foundation progress, that's happening, they're focused inflating graduation numbers. 



We need get rid notion someone left back slight child, focus learned much know. Doctors might take MCAT multiple times pass, lawyers BAR. end day, end that's important. thing K-12. Nope. first Sinovac dose felt slightly groggy arm felt little sore. second dose little bit uncomfortable. got Pfizer’d felt effects described above, lasted couple days. brother Pfizer’d Sinovac side effects almost nonexistent. work colleagues rough time though, remember, it’s worth 😄

My mum received AZ booster Sinovac side effects kinda rough tho. dad received AZ booster according words didn’t feel anything, however, loves play tough dude xD Nice  fact dead proof work great.  Vaccine doesn’t work well everybody thought? Everyone's got 5G now, huh? still remember commercial them. really adorable. it’s really violation international law, maybe nations put US it’s people trial     seems NJ isn’t really spike. numbers gone compared low July seems numbers platoed job, freedom  Probably start framing economic problem well. Tell people global supply chain rising inflation due covid. Maybe help understand need get this. r/nottheonion 20 months.  
we'd need hit years fully understand long term effects certain time restaints (the economy) . actually appears misjudging severe things could get long run, specifically protocols put place last year okay, worked decently December Delta variant hit December really spread every corner mid summer late protocols worked longer enough. Eastern Europe Balkan states disinformation rampant, largely came eastern Europe, United States, great example differed older groups took vaccine US, disinformation Russia elsewhere convinced older groups Europe take proven vaccines, can't explain away blaming US.  terrible, prolonged side effects first two doses? us worried (I recognize it’s vaccine per se, course, antibodies generated problem). there.  
As red part oregon washington. Conservative af. Glad left. US always amazing place - leaders scientific research simultaneously abundant non-scientific belief like cults. guess following trend super surprising. VT transmission rate 5th worst US now, death rate lowest 1/3rd nation. ""Living covid"" mean weathering regional outbreaks flood ICUs victims long enough people vaccinated. Also, VT, hospitals still refused vaccine. problem solve eventually. duh?  I'll leave here... find similar site stabbing yourself. quite amusing. completely expected, guys. Don’t freak out. days get colder, people North tend congregate indoors since weather less comfortable. people indoors means spread. Nobody anything wrong; it’s natural byproduct climate. 

The thing happened South summer, remember? Case rates rose everyone freaked out, it’s weather becoming unbearably hot outside, people congregated indoors. saw pattern last year. mean besides lamba strains wanna sweep strong enough? 
What offshoots delta like UK ? 


Look numbers, even numbers real people collecting data hiding it, show plateau sudden increase. would take believe danger? realized, count deaths COVID California, that’s like 25 9/11’s. OKC Tulsa great food music scenes. rural areas I've seen like developing country. Tbh, prefer San Antonio Austin Southwest cities coast.  Yeah,
But describe bunch places.


I've never Oklahoma, online reviews brilliant. bad? What’s point? relate high COVID numbers? Utilitarian debunked Visalia absolute worst Mexican food ever life. fact able stay business told needed know Central Valley. Empathy fatigue, thing.  eh. numbers feel misleading whole people 1 shot. Back august high degree (in upper 70% believe) 1 shot. lagged long time, recall. due reasons:

1. J&amp;J recipients

2. People got 1 shot pfizer/moderna called good. 

3. J&amp;J recipients wanted get pfizer moderna get official permission, understandably lied said unvaccinated start pfizer/moderna courses. 

4. People responding Israeli data boosters understandably lying saying unvaccinated get third dose.


numbers 3 4 probably account million. also explains whole 80+% US least one shot misleading. 

Not say hopeful. something like 80% covid patients unvaccinated, 90+% covid deaths unvaccinated. Part lull right might due limited immunity crazy record numbers seeing (sick unvaccinated people.)

Once immunity wanes, get vaccinated (because they're type wear masks socially distance either) another round getting sick. unusual see either:

1. people getting vaxxed see covid offer natural immunity beyond months (unless something changed seen)

2. repeated covid cases (at least hospital level) wind debilitating start de facto social isolating energy leave home. 

or

3. rolling dice (especially debilitated first go-round) poor results die. 



So yeah. interested see hospitalization/death numbers maybe 6 month range last highest range delta hospitalizations/death. Again, insist making choice, accept consequences. actually making choice count others carry consequences choice.

I personal choice, deciding money.

If decide distrust doctors telling vaccinate choice, trust pump body full medicines get sick, actually skeptical medical science, acting like dick, thought would pay consequences, you. I’m right you. got third shot week half ago - tested positive four days booster. Virtually symptoms (taste tad weaker like two days). vaccines work. entertains people loudest trusting people right thing ones least likely right thing themselves...

Arguing bad faith become hallmark GOP. 1G means tested vaccinated also live rural area get appointment booster vaccine day call doctor. friend got booster vaccine bus bigger city. guess really depends live first time read crazy waiting line/time since vaccine became available everyone. They've probably seen way friends family get seriously ill. got booster 5:30 pm, woke middle night feeling little unwell. later woke around 8 worse symptoms. feeling better around 3 pm. Don’t need study that.  best advertisement comes someone else's lips.  say think fair would put kind burden already vastly burdened healthcare workers. Paper, 2021 beds"" meaningless number

Why? can't help new patients nowhere treat population took seriously.

I know lot people reddit believe main reason people get vaccines Russia, one living here, I'm sure among top 5 reasons people reluctant take jab here. list would be:

1. Recent decades taught people trust government general.
2. lot medical staff want get vaccinated advise patients to.
3. Non-coherent politics towards vaccination. QR codes already introduced summer, suddenly everything cancelled (because oncoming elections) whole story forgotten now.
4. PR handling Sputnik vaccine awful (just look name) - rushed claim ""we first vaccine publicly available"".
5. Western vaccines approved Russia.
6. Really awful controversies surrounding another vaccine -  93% 55 older numbers little info February might changed little vaccinations.

Yes people multiple comorbidities risk factors. Thing is, lot comorbidities, many pretty common (like obesity).

Covid dangerous young relatively healthy individual, entire population still going see many thousands deaths could prevented vaccines. There's noneay know whether going 1/1000 30 year old dies covid. Today world’s least surprising study… give explanation wanted booster give anyone feels like willing walk where? mRNA technology saves asses. Moderna currently phase one HIV vaccine (!) - HIV WAY problematic human immune system SARS-CoV-2 ever be.

Apart big cities, California Texas Oklahoma. good news vaccine, I’m zero danger severe outcome basically sit bed another days feeling like crap. Whatever. I’ve sick before.

See get monoclonal antibody treatment. help clear infection. tendency consider outcomes action (omission) less severe action (commission), even result severe equal action 

This really huge one consistently gets ignored (possibly easier satisfying call people evil stupid).

Humans generally feel worse something bad allow something bad happen. trolley problem perfect example this: lot people feel allowing lots people die worse killing people. probably major factor behind opposition vaccination programmes hurt small number people (through side-effects), save much larger number people. Lord gives Lord takes away. Lord gives again. fu*ck wrong Lord? couple people know breakthrough infections mild symptoms (sniffles body aches) got tested abundance caution. 

I aunt uncle caught it. Uncle vaxxed, aunt isn’t. sick almost two weeks, nearly hospitalized, monoclonal antibodies said tired achy couple days. 

The vaccine mostly prevents hospitalization death. Which…is important. Lol remember risk age group tiny unless really serious underlying lung issues. get J&amp;J booster. Pfizer versus moderna much different; pfizer's slightly smaller dose moderna booster dose. smaller dose marginally better people 30 anyone worried side effects. larger dose probably better older healthcare worker. I'm pretty sure that's made comment. Yeah, cousin promptly developed type 1 diabetes virus child. Must anxiety. /S stayed masking minimal contact still despite vaccine, I've watched numbers tick fast people thoughts immune. unvaccinated blamed they're ones mostly occupying hospitals catch it. They're ones catching I've seen job double vaxed seniors boosters still catching vaccinated family Okc here, nope, fresh room new cannabis dispensaries, coffee shops, mega gas stations, covid overflow tent camps.  wait get booster got Pfizer March covid August? I’m thinking waiting January 2022 I’ll returning in-person learning 4 days week. assume I’m pretty protected right I’m thinking waiting months get bang buck. Moderna vaccine Moderna booster. Zero problems. also wonder people focus statistically insignificant portion people reactions vs people died lingering significant health issues. seems like disingenuous comparison. Like talking rate fall 9.8m/m2 talking hit head falling feather falling manhole cover. relevant, hey… thanks, nice overview. data support saying, specifically regard type immunity lasts long time? making sure verifiable point rather working expectation reasonable model understanding (not wouldnt helpful). date delta. Don’t show unprotected.

Yep. bring knife gunfight. Delta play around. think someone crunched numbers Delta infection almost twice likely result hospitalization someone unvaxxed. 

Unfortunately, Delta, one high circulating antibody levels avoid infection (it reproduces fast). several months, antibody levels fallen. cellular immunity takes several days ramp exposure infection --- vaccinated people higher viral loads test positive. main difference vaccinated person clear infection much quicker much less damage someone unvaxxed memory B cells kick gear start cranking new antibodies. [NPR interview NIH Director Collins thinks little funny delayed vaccine rollout several weeks ordering Moderna pause sample insufficiently racially diverse.

Absent specific reason think there's valid biological difference, that's something address post market follow-up emergency situation hundreds thousands per day dying. covid impacting POC reason delay trials let even people, disproportionately POC, continue die perfect racial representation trial. political decision, medical one. There's little difference black white people immunological level, race predominantly social rather biological distinction. 2-3 weeks politically correct sample cost thousands lives.  boosted Moderna-gangster, wonder getting massive systemic defenses ""on alert"" might best way go. definitely nearly worried booster. mean sure, wreaks havoc nose, soon mucosal various immune responses vaccine necessarily produce. massive systemic inflammatory response immune dysregulation, thanks vaccine.

What's take it? Waves really need looked state, FL looks different WA, example. end scale, pleasantly surprised went Costco saw N95s KN95s (even KF94s) ever before. rest wearing ""surgical"" masks, wearing cloth ones. Nobody going entirely without mask, although couple people pull send text message.

Many people N95/equivalents older, still encouraging see many (it's also Costco; people careful everywhere). city/county (Portland) pretty well, though much rest state. might something people city careful. get covid getting vaccinated? Nope , referencing central European countries including Germany though could easily breeze poorly executed vaccine mandates lack thereof really hope allow soon. Schools full covid Croatia. older went two times online 10 days month someone class tested positive.  hospitals go back letting people die easily treatable ailment due lack space like couple months ago, far personal decision. won’t open boosters individuals, expect? Moderna original 100 mcg, moderna booster 50 mcg, pfizer booster 30 mcg. That's amount mRNA dose; different lipid outer shell might different uptake rates certainty moderna booster still bigger dose pfizer - likely. also neglects mechanism masks working effectively, everyone wear keep particles mostly ourselves.

This also similar cartoon always post guy putting chain link fence keep mosquitoes. betrays complete lack understanding masks intended virus spread. also great keeping face warm 👍  Yes US: developed best vaccines &amp; acquired fasted…but vaccination rate lowest advanced tried denying science, reality, experts, calling everyone names?  Like Spain Portugal like 95% vaccinated? appreciate that, thanks so. Maybe gift end year. Yeah, would fine that. already happens life insurance - pay higher premiums smoker. sure works private health insurance. Ah, good ole Get Brian Morans sign ye old Fark days. hear you! I’d much rather kids primed immune system via vaccine exposed CoVID (which obviously bound happen point). worry much acute infection, long term effects virus might them. Obviously still learning virus, concerns seems changes brain matter obviously lots reports neurological dysfunction following infection. 

I read somewhere wanted make sure administration covid vaccine didn’t interfere routine childhood vaccines… kind confused it’s made abundantly clear co-administered flu vaccine things like TDAP. Victoria anti vaxxers basically locked everything anyway!

Oh, take surveys entrances now? fairly consistent data: one- two-dose regimens drop efficacy *against infection* fairly close 0% number months. time efficacy *against severe outcomes infected* rose period.  number months varies significantly vaccine dosage age participants; may also vary initial dose interval.

This study particular looking Sweden's first round vaccinations; [8% second doses 6 months ago. likely include mostly really vulnerable healthcare workers, we'd expect show slightly faster waning studies general population.

None means anything bad vaccines general, means need 3-dose regimen Delta. case every vaccine too: even measles, originally single dose, changed two doses separated *by 3+ years*. Polio 4 doses spread 5 years. we're middle pandemic rush things, means inefficient vaccination push doses close together use large dosage.

The way efficacy infected rising even efficacy infection drops first set doses indicative immune system works. Initial vaccination creates huge response antibodies flooding bloodstream mucous membranes, small unrefined cellular response. antibodies wane cellular response continues refine. Giving another dose refined raise cellular response well bring antibodies even higher initially were.

Get six-month third dose. already done part.

That's little short-sighted, think? also lot migrant farm workers undocumented folks valley. kangaroos Vienna really annoying! know many boosters needed. Several childhood vaccines come multiple spaced doses; one 5 doses.

In sense, right. Social distancing going end pandemic. Delta highly contagious. endemic, reservoirs animal populations, course humans around globe.

Social distancing help protect hospitals overwhelmed. that's it. Social distancing protect anyone infection. disease going leave us. Everyone unvaccinated, vulnerable eventually going get it. Social distancing might time shift someone becomes infected, that's it. going disappear. number infected, number mutations occur.

Only vaccination prevent infection. long vulnerable hosts, disease continue spread.

Social distancing bought us time vaccines. fail, worked great. ineffective ending pandemic. put /s next time Breakthroughs raise immunity, though actual efficacy comparison. Personally I'd plan wait 6 months breakthrough. outside risk always low. exactly problem: public health officials ignoring experts large part pandemic.

We've battled lot health issues son two. watch people nonchalant young children, meanwhile still live lives somewhat bubble. vaccination can't come soon enough ages. way around. everybody bad math it. However know someone vaccinated, buys lottery smokes, pretty sure they're bad math. see.

What follows shows clearly you’re selectively listening agree pretending it’s consensus.

The CDC group best scientists world. CDC offers guidance carries much weight opinion associate professor emergency medicine University California, San Francisco even associate professor Harvard T.H. Chan School Public Health—particularly neither people positions *making policy*. answers given NPR, *not* policy guidelines, putting people's lives reputations risk here's, may fact come different conclusions skin game.

The evidence benefits masking schools reached consensus, presence counter-opinions dies negate “Fuck teachers…I’ll listen ‘scientists’,” isn’t significant disagreement among them, represented NPR article here. 

This article represent ""significant disagreement"" among fact downvoted stating scientists interviewed article said speaks volumes.

I downvote dipshit. truly living life without limits lol yes y'all is. circling back trying undermine already difficult accept.  
You're asking stranger internet ""know"" already believe.  


it's right, hope correct numbers increasing reality. hope dominant strain replace delta yet ferreted out. hope wrong since already decided am, must pleased.  
Now let's see reality follows expectations. think booster would kick fast. takes couple weeks build antibodies. likely never be. estimated number herd immunity 70% entire population. However depends vaccine, population distributed.

I want say percentage fully vaccinated people inflated, isn't, look people vaccinated, starts paint different picture. populous states like California, states Northeast, tend higher vaccination rates people.

Even inside states, like state New Jersey, 67% vaccinated, communities higher covid cases others due lower vaccination rates communities.

Then look states they're even less vaccinated. really we're going see covid turns endemic, even eventually surpass 70% number herd immunity, communities reached number really see herd immunity.

Other states Alabama, Mississippi, West Virginia, etc see covid continue ravage long time unless something changes people decide get vaccinated. Bruh know.😂 I'm talking ass, I'm Oklahoman, born raised. German chancellor government representative Bundestag. could never wander far overall desires majority. chancellor, vocal proponent following scientific evidence. coalition could done things differently/better could see future, made difficult choices best intentions win all. There’s one problem though. large number parents (around half) said don’t plan vaccinate kids. actual benefit likely hopeless impasse country feels like rip bandaid point. everyone wants vaccinate kids done end restrictions let chips fall. Otherwise waiting for?  Jesus christ we're doomed we? Let start I'm sorry loss genuinely am.

The issue one shot though immunity full immunity time lost quickly. folks getting one shot going back second (which happening) acting vaccinated putting high risk also potentially spreading virus.

So there's ""zero protection"" one shot, useful strategy. know. go burger king.  Wish could feel optimistic, live county 52% fully vaxxed; 57% partial. People neighboring counties come shop, vaxx rates lower.
In stores, maybe 10% shoppers masked. figure folks vaccinated, assume 50%+ fellow unmasked shoppers vaxxed, don’t believe masks/social distancing, possibly still think Covid hoax.

I’m still wearing mask, got second J&amp;J couple weeks ago. I’m still cautious crowds, debating whether go less crowded early movie showing holidays.

This one counties home first big Delta surge June July. many people still denial boggles mind. many, religion, think.

""You that"" mean ""that banned"".  work field. see mental ‘illness’ negative. (Not appropriate refer mental distress ‘illness’, we’ve discarded model.)

Heroes, like. *so* thought Jules. meh ... vaccinated, even without booster, probably OK; boost immunity even more; getting booster Jan perfectly OK.

There needs certain amount fatalism means preparing waves instead trying head off. agree UK's decision drop restrictions earlier; think spare big winter wave, imposing restrictions period low transmission really much help transmission gets high again. means people enjoyed life less restrictions re-imposed. cover shit like insurance. yeah 2 people died COVID sucks them

[Farr's suggest outbreaks tend symmetric: cases start fall, generally predict future reading past.

However, scales operate, seeing multiple outbreaks playing once, definitely optimistic. That’s good point - also kids Also contract virus, duration illness lower unvaccinated thus contagious shorter period. 

There's also chance shed fewer virus particles thus less contagious unvaccinated person I'm sure that's studied yet. What's difference? initials mean? Vermont's vaccination rate 72% overall. barely 70% threshold thought minimum thought needed way delta variant happened. Post-delta lot epidemiologists think around 90% vaccination needed delta much contagious.

We’re vaccinated Japan though. someone went public school US, surprising.

The US public education system build foundation rote memorization standardized testing. emphasis test scores graduation rates. explain anything works, give enough pass tests looks like they're good job. 

If smart enough figure anyway, probably end even worse since need inhuman patience keep ""showing work"" step step things simple 2x+5=9. 

I almost failed math class 6th grade. reason? kept getting F's could produce correct answers super simple one variable linear equations without rearranging paper. led rather awkward meeting guidance counselor math tutor surprised discover reason failing nothing math. 

I personally learned math playing video games (specifically MMOs RTS) anything else college. Nope, people refuse totally idiots, I'm sorry that's totally black/white thing covid highly transmissable diseases. fine can't take conditions have, afraid refuse vaccine drop sympathy me. people vote brains Netherlands, 45% positive tests within fully vaccinated moment. Since hit 16k+ daily positive tests last Thursday, almost 8000 tests within vaccinated population. must add, test people show symptoms. amount vaccinated people spread virus likely higher since test mandatory vaccinated individuals. 

6x less likely get covid might still true amount breakthrough infections staggering. Works ways ? Oh. My. God.

I'm going remember talking stupidity. hear you. can’t stand antivaxx people initial reaction “Oh, great idea, long overdue”, something rub wrong way human rights sense.

I’m hoping coming emergency circumstances needing handle pandemic general governance precedent. don’t think approach would fly everywhere... work meeting everyone get tested prior flying since county free accurate tests, 24 hours rest hotel rapid test well. 

Personally, date boosters / vaccines careful think risk pretty low comfort level. 

Nothing perfect depends comfort level.   Thanks! know applies specifically Americans. Besides, think entire premise flawed. takes elementary grasp math see McAnulty’s initial statement self-evidently unbelievable.

That's refuse enter insanity vaxxed people - good Vs unvaxxed - monsters.

and higher 250 dying per day. grand total deaths inability wear masks, get vaccinated, control resulted 60,500 deaths *this summer*. 

Our hospitals system brink collapse,

You know many times called ambulance someone suffering COVID lung, many condolence cards signed them.

You would see bedsores ICU patients faces grieving families. 

You'd every time nurse cried closet.

How callus foolish estimate me? 

Do *any* compassion 760,000 died, feelings rest probable 1 *million* next year? 

Why members public turning psychopathic narcissists care one pleasure?! 

Go enjoy steak, cocktails friends. use human beings cannot compassion rest humankind. may treat them, part them. Yeah, think story entirely true either. failed reasons.

It'll course less nobody got boosted, boosters going turn daily case count 80k 10k deaths crater 200. Breakthrough cases/deaths *not* main driver current plateau/rise.

The leader ""lib dem"" (rather neolibs) party went record claiming social distancing measures ""proven ineffective"".

This country lost.   lot people would agree booster brand would effective taking mixed dose different vaccine ""booster"". inherently safer less likely 4th dose requirement future. Hence around 40% people bother taking mixed booster shot. Yeah agree that. Lots letters left Greek alphabet. Good stay safe best can. ‘Math?! ever use school?’ - says many ‘merican classmates.    vaccinated much less likely vaccinated die.

Are sure? already proven vaccines' efficacy infection transmission virus even close stated originally. said vaccines protected 95%+ rate. Now, vaccines' protection % already fallen \~20%. Cases dont mean shit world covid endemic guaranteed catch point, think risk weighting tilt towards kids building immunity first controlled inactive vaccine opposed unknown dose live virus. wish weren’t conservative. 45% positive test within fully vaccinated that’s 7000 (7200 exact), almost 8000. that’s 7200 within fully vaccinated, 8800 within unvaccinated group. But…. vaccinated group LOT larger unvaccinated. take entire population, including kids 12, around 73% vaccinated. means 27% population 55% (symptomatic) infections. see problem??

How everyone talking vaccinated vs. unvaccinated looking ICU positions taken? Since beginning, known large majority people taken ICU covid least one underlying condition, like obesitas lifestyle-related conditions, resulted hospitalization. Somehow decided relevant anymore, want much vaccinated people. (So need point everything terms vaccinated vs. unvaccinated!) 
\[The answer posted another account thread below, also somewhat relevant post. least information.\] 
Which clear indicator anything. 80% need test, unless want themselves. 20% NEEDS test, even show symptoms, want go enter public building, go drinking, go dinner, cinema, museum, go gym, go partake public event. 
In theory, 8000 positive tests 80% could come 30,000 tested people, 8000 positive tests 20% could also come 30,000 tested people. 
The 80% much less likely go testing, even symptoms, 20%. even go take test comes back positive, change 'green check' corona app, gives access aforementioned places events. masking also protect vaccinated grandma heartattack cant treated local hospital full. breakthrough cases, people immunocomprimised. world isnt black white.

You could younger person, fully vaccinated, go out/party several times week. Alcohol lowers immune response group one gets Covid odds getting Covid much higher due constant exposure.

Or making shit up. Well question year it. get people realize they've systematically conned lied sources trust? know, that's really tough question. 

Getting people think critically people ideas trust really hard. Especially thing becomes fundamental part identity. lot times specifics particular beliefs longer matter they're held they're true, rather they're held signify. like getting Christian think critically Trinity. Nobody really knows Trinity is, could possibly exist, yet rock solid foundation Nicene Creed hundreds millions people blindly recite element faith.

Unfortunately lot antivax conspiracy thinking around COVID become article faith. believe course government lying you, believe statistics government reports? convenient way poison well ignore contradictory information want to. Presenting evidence arguments they're wrong usually work well. Instead going MUCH depth affair addresses root causes are, emotional state, readily accepting falsehoods lives. 

Many people believe wrong shit COVID, they've critically examined evidence. they've become convinced charismatic people learned trust them. Showing people evidence they're wrong often results doubling down. getting people wake realize they've conned lied hardest thing world believe they're ones finally woken broken free. shit tough. studies suggest mix n match mrna vaccines best, personally wouldnt care get pfizer moderna, since free choice get pfizer.  article recently booster rates low high vax areas, could reason. vaxxed folks antivaxx areas rushed get boosters protect neighbors, high vaxx areas seem comfortable neighborhoid protected. makes think isnt true

The reality number daily new soon, lot people Long Covid diagnosed ME/CFS meet criteria:

 - persistent fatigue worsens exertion (physical mental) leading post-exertional malaise, additional symptoms, orthostatic intolerance, cognitive impairment unrefreshing sleep.

The vast majority people ME/CFS viral onset leading diagnosis.

Some people Long Covid meet criteria issuss organ damage, persistent loss taste smell predominantly Covid thing (but happen viruses). seems different subsets Long Covid. really term used describe post-Covid complications, vary widely. makes sense. wonder they'll go back one day study deaths see real cause not. mean, literally everyone hates TSA? thought airport screenings popular opinion. lockdown people comorbidity then? likely end hospital clogging system.

When decide group get rights restricted merely possibilities get absurd outcomes.  widely accepted unvaxxed spread more. Plenty data this. google search. I’m going spoon feed studies. Netherlands, 45% positive tests within fully vaccinated moment. Since hit 16k+ daily positive tests last Thursday, almost 8000 tests within vaccinated population. must add, test people show symptoms. amount vaccinated people spread virus likely higher since test mandatory vaccinated individuals.  less likely get covid might still true amount breakthrough infections staggering.

No, test people show symptoms. Anyone test. believe boosters Getting booster afternoon. got moderna originally vaccinated. get (I choice Pfizer, moderna, J&amp;J). pharmacist says doesn’t matter, feel like maybe might opinions. double jabbed, vaccinated help prevent spread?

One effective ways preventing spread testing symptoms, ventilate indoor places, including home, staying home symptoms. However, least countries, privacy laws, positive test results allowed linked status people's corona app. people taken jab, access place, even tested positive virus. them, 100% dependent responsibility.

Besides, always recommended option keep immune system high getting enough exercise keeping eating, sleeping, thinking drinking habits healthy.

But, I’m sure lumping together unvaccinated, careless, covid deniers people triple vaccinated want go bit more. mean they’re sociopath.
