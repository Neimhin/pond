0,2020-06-23," almost certainly haven’t saved lives, fact much weaker position now. 

They certainly saved lifes people would ICU bed COVID19 left spreading uncontrolled, bought time better understand COVID19 properly treat infected moved rest population closer vaccine.  

I‘m German perfect consider reaction government quite sound. haircut speak of? 

My new mullet would like word. Washington, several counties track overflow people refuse proactive. Instead claiming wearing masks “unconstitutional”. I’m starting wonder they’ve ever even read constitution idea segregate old young, let young get infected build herd immunity, old would able come again.

Short story, many older people (unable fully isolate months) got infected anyway killed couple hundred people 60 higher desired. wife RN major hospital USA, wishes leave profession, due shit colleagues treated. gonna hit 5 year mark leave, go smaller clinic, VA. wants get back actually caring patients, current pandemic, way U.S goverment handling it, mental health deteriorated immensely. mean, federal goverment intervening taking medial supplies via stealth, places actually needed it, really fucked up. Speaking financial misinformation, guess haven’t heard deficit spending. Here’s Wikipedia article. Read  batshit crazy think virus isn’t going eradicated time soon it’s sustainability prevention measures important long run? I’d say shutting everyone indoors virus goes away far insane idea. Ask California. Exactly I’m deeply sorry enraged hear lost family member damned virus, isn’t sort contest know, doesn’t make distress/frustration less real. insane Disney World wants reopen weeks

If think point view, makes sense. parks large one largest sources revenue company, point making millions per day shutdown. get shit done, *need* parks open raking money.

Right they're billions debt industry would say, hardest hit entire corona virus. can't show movies theaters like Mulan, probably banking huge hit China. cruise lines shut right nobody wants even travel right anyways. part company alright Disney+, long term, dont see well unless get shit together content.

So perspective, must desperate hell open back already. new debts pay keeping company going whole thing. make right, dont think opening back period, makes sense think point view. Archive link: heatwave likely hit extra hard elderly care year. Several municipalities lack emergency plans measures taken deadly hot summer 2018 ineffective ongoing pandemic virus pandemic.



More 600 people died result heatwave two years ago, according calculations Christofer Åström Umeå University. researches health risks high temperatures.


- 2018 became alarm clock many maybe prepared enough, says.


This week, SMHI warns high temperatures large parts country Christofer Åström believes heat waves hit even harder heat risk group corona virus: elderly underlying diseases.


- One thing makes difficult one measure many people took 2018 ensure least one cooled-down room, often gathering room, elderly. premises used many residents isolated rooms anyway, says Christofer Åström.


Much common heat wave advice applicable virus spread therefore another summer like 2018 could consequences, according researcher previously worked behalf Public Health Authority.


- think would much worse now. advice heat wave, example WHO, looking cooled premises shops, shopping malls like used fans. Things advised now, says.


#Lacks contingency plans


When National Board Health Welfare evaluated summer 2018, became clear may difficult municipalities handle several crises parallel.


The authorities' data also show approximately 15 percent municipalities lack contingency plan high temperatures elderly. Despite this, difficult draw conclusions hot summer mean, says Stina Hovmöller, Head Unit National Board Social Affairs.


- know prepared handle combination pandemic high temperatures, says.


- also know prepared, adds.

#Tegnell: Fans important


The public health authority's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell concerned elderly care's ability mitigate consequences heat wave corona pandemic.


- Everything place already covid-19 must continue place gets hot. like measures prepared gets hot place, says.


- possibly crash think solve that, Tegnell continues.


In 2018, many elderly care businesses purchased fans cool off, Public Health Agency warns using common areas, corona center spread longer distance. However, fans still used rooms, according Anders Tegnell.


""Most homes air conditioning place today, fans important,"" says.

#""Quite logical""


Also, many homes air conditioning common areas particularly big problem despite importance physical distance, Tegnell says.


- say anything air conditioning. think that's good. sit distance always time, says.


The state epidemiologist also believes much solved common sense, example WHO's advice seek cool public place heat wave.


- typically example little sensible. quite logical good advice time, says. fair country much rush reopen DeSantis. Monkey see monkey do, single state waiting cases decline reopen. Effectively making lockdown pointless first place. 

Proper testing widespread use masks wouldve better imo. apply EEA well? went 3 stores yesterday get supplies. got dirty looks one wearing mask. Im 25 cancer already low immune system explain everyone. even turn fb amount back lash get saying wear mask. say people get beat it. well die... die... thats thier mentality think anyone feeling good. Still, right Sweden undoubtedly better countries. course, stupid draw types conclusions country whole thing probably far over. like said support listening experts even goes current thinking sucks. I've cancelled everything life due virus. hang friends play pool music, quit going gym, wife longer meets girlfriends coffee crafting, step-daughter lost job moved back us, pulled son soccer, golf lessons, swimming, play-dates, go church anymore, go restaurants.... probably move small, relatively safe town Houston keep job pay cut, (if get laid off) pay exorbitant rent, live around bunch infected people can't bothered safe. feel lucky least pay bills now, know others can't, selfishness everyone taking seriously getting nerves. wanna get sick, gente... That’s works. comparison would there’s terrorism gunman running around choice stay home leave. It’s called assessing risks taking Delaying rent help, I'm versed enough research know whether rent cancellations viable easy way alleviating would I've seen least one city do: CUT CHECKS think US funding European economy...? Dafuq? clearly never Tokyo. Comparing NYC joke. People complete opposite ends spectrum terms respectfulness. Everything systematic/clean it’s incredible. lots articles immunity levels populations... couple come quickly bookmarked- 

 

 

Here India estimates came mentioning 20% + immunity population Delhi redacted 1.3% given 2 days later (ICMR-  ). search reddit give many more. figures range 3-12% depending location severity infection typical articles opposed early optimistic efforts 20+% range saying data inconsistent leads confusion. “Manipulation” wrong word. first""

So... ""economy first"" actually ending bad economy. that's propaganda

&amp;#x200B;

absolutely false like one complained people speaking Spanish Spanish food restaurants. Spain. US ranks countries like Belgium, UK, France, Ireland deaths per capita. NY allowed covid postive patients return retirement housing would among countries lowest numbers across board. 

It make Trump less orange moron idiot factual data. fact, exactly tendency hyperbolic misinformation directed helped win last time. Please again. One frustrating things it’s late. Texas would simply shut everything “fully” right now, could stop worst happening. 

Just doesn’t seem like TX government interest all. brown phase? live New York say absolutely 100% efforts lockdown saved lives. reason areas, significantly lower infections, facing wave 1 ineptitude attitude fake lockdowns nothing.

If people could honestly HONESTLY social distance might gotten entirely. people can't. that's there's ""first wave"" going. I'm glad live NY right yes got destroyed, actually something curb spread sit damn better position right now. lockdown worked here. Ask failed others places find answer. True.

Neither data coming Bolsonaro government.

Pick choice. Ok dipshit. I'll play. 

OP said (paraphrase) states seeing major rise cases

Squealor aka Dipshit replied (quote) 
""Google Arizona Trump rally. bunch people tightly packed 0 masks.""

See Dipshit...right there...you blame rise cases rally. reply wrong thread, Dipshit? 

Going rally protest right simply poor judgement downvote want saying it, downvotes rewrite laws physics rules Biology. 

Now FO. you. Conservatives Liberals...different perspectives stupid. scientist sound like damn good news. No, get wrong, reckoning this.

They hid rest world far long. result. abhor way dealt initially. sure. forgotten least.

That said, right now, control. I'm saying.

Also, tbh, initial response Italy more... forceful, would hell lot fewer dead people.

Forceful in: surround red zone tanks tell people stay home shot. geez lousie........check facts ,,,google Dallas Dallas County, testing, covid 19....bhah blah blah

so care testing jeopardized light Trump's well publicized comments Tulsa Phoenix refuse acknowledge association? Noted.

other us care. alot us believer word Trumps' mouth trust minions act interest public. fake til make Canada 90% full would time low  friend quit job gym SC reopened earlier month, felt opening early. Unfortunately right 2 employees already tested positive. Oh yeah...the riots. That's thing core reason we're vulnerable Commercial real estate implosion even Fed blowing money US states intended slot autonomy, buy nowadays almost entirely dependent federal gov critical piece story - sheer size medical center 90% capacity unreal. Texas children’s opened ICU adults it’s gotten bad. obsession going back office fucking annoying. sure wish Florida would considered New Yorkers, brought many first cases entering summer vacation period longer reporting delays possible.  However, less educated less able isolate. Think people deliver groceries, packages, work yard, clean house, watch children, etc. None work home, like many degree. Yep. lives (Tri-Cities, WA) respected. case count rising Benton Franklin counties even local orders, mask-wearing far common. Hopefully, helps. many American deaths enough you? work manufacturing. I'm watching idiots various companies go bars entire teams getting infected together. creating supply chain production issues place. 

There absolutely reason bars open anywhere country right now. Yes, pulling stops ""American Democracy"", season 45. lot people fear show going get cancelled. friends real estate lol. 70's Patriots lot good players, thing held back awful owner, Billy Sullivan.  extremely cheap let lot good players go era free agency.  Robert Kraft owner then, would Super Bowl two. brother going doctor?

Sorry. think brother qualified. mostly masks. ""gains"" strict lockdown would wiped overnight people started interacting without masks. Slow testing! Complacency kills. know you’re infected now? yet another datapoint argues anti-lockdown crowd's suggestions Sweden particular would avoid many (very real) problems come stricter lockdowns. true lockdown domestic violence goes up. However, ALSO happened Sweden *real* lockdown, strong *reccomendations* distancing, working home, etc, etc, etc. Apparently soft NPIs worst worlds way: strong enough bring outbreak control strong enough provoke social problems associated lock down. 


It would interesting see comparisons Nordics this. [Finland actually reported DECREASE child instance. IIRC domestic violence whole increased Denmark. Everyone focus us deaths even mild symptoms really hard deal let alone work through.
Plus considering USA offers sick pay. even breadline amount like £90 ish week uk does. going really tough people.

I suspect going ping pong across USA vaccination released achieved destroy ~20% economy

Source? Highest GDP I've seen ~5%. covid snake oil ideas, one dumbest. Misleading! INMO inexplicable used misrepresentative figure reach conclusion.

They based percentage total cases healthcare workers. percentage healthcare workers got infected. Two totally different figures two different implications.  I’m Texas want get out. EU mental? Ah yes let’s punish entire people 1% rich ass government corrupt.  mean, everyone vote - absolutely - lived New York State thirty years, one's vote ever counted ever solidly swing state.

And see videos people yesterday locked voting centers?

Voting _very least do._ Dying old people vote. show every two years, can't think politically active. Slight caveat. would still watch total cases, along side percent positivity. Even hospital capacity ok, concurrent rise percent positive total cases means rise asymptomatic spreaders pre-symptomatic patients, may predict increased hospital strain month line. There’s risk, sure, lower you’re careful take put mask. E.G. it’s loopy type, touch loops. You’re inhaling part. Person person spread confirmed late evening 20 Jan. people already begun buying N95 medical masks medical alcohol, even goggles, case. live, masks sold early next morning, people pharmacies acquire apparently got sold entire market.  spoke deaths though

Interesting Muuhhh frreeeedddooomm! comment "" [Six campaign staffers working Tulsa rally test positive can't believe still happening. realize he's killing people would otherwise vote him? ""

I expect apply standard protest. Could imagine could hibernate. Honestly would made everything much easier. intents purposes, might well EU. Nothing change end year terms travel (until borders closed) nothing changed. 

Also offsets Spain lying. tell /s implied

Based exactly?

Either step get caught crossfire. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Good. Europe need Americans. I'm fine refugees immigrants country us. Wearing mask protects wearing one live country currently experiencing 38.4C highs (101F) 100% humidity. 

That combination literally never measured anywhere earth. Probably daytime high temperature + humidity morning?
Still, cannot imagine living environment. compare turkish sauna. Murexit go hospital 5 miles road. honest , noone could save india happening probably. huge country people whole USA live poverty cramed slums dont basic needs , clean water , hygiene. people work HUGE cities work spread middle (is right term??? ) class . cannot close 3 months like europe . would lead even deaths. 

To honest anything 50k cases daily 1,5k -2k deaths india probably still control. India one thing working could factor worse anywhere else world - 50% INDIA population 25 years old. law systematic racism deeply ingrained American society stopping people color reaching levels white oppressors. given Trump's attitude comments, need wonder why

Got it, need worry facts, assumptions fueled anger good enough.

Carry on

🙄 drive yourself, think fine. Flying though... seems really risky. Originally planned moving LA area east coast(to make stronger pursuit acting) August, seems like bad idea now. Canadians poutine. /s

Poutine good carne asada fries better.  Apply thought process something else, say gunman terrorist.

""Don't worry, terrorists killing vulnerable, best leave it"" 1% means 1 100. 

.1% means 1 1,000. 

.01% means 1 10,000. 

.001% means 1 100,000. 

[In state \(AZ\) 78 deaths people 78 x 100,000 = 7,800,000. population AZ 7.2 million.

And diseases like flu around result syndemic everyone concerned fall.

tl;dr stop bullshit. They’re flu pneumonia! Ever Yosemite? valley zoo. science back Sounds like great plan. Hope big cities follow suit. NYC large enough need get rid displays entirely cost. Yeah true swing Trumps way 2016 knowingly lies shit admits progress COVID vaccine US Canada?

I'm currently gathering data, send answer shortly. Please lookout message. *would’ve

Go Canada multiple studies. 

Either way “heard immunity” proven viable isn’t actual strategy. It’s surrender fantasy. large family gatherings happened people saw thousands idiots streets screaming BLM figured bother restrictions

thanks BLM said God lazy! article states sure Long antibodies last. read could month article says could months couple years enough info m! read it! Yeah, individual localities figure want balance budget. difficult city workers getting laid off. 

I grew city limits, popping still option. May suck can't celebrate way we're used to. NYC antibody numbers feel alarming, given Bronx might lost 0.3% population already. antibody count 25% there, virus meaningfully dangerous US population everyone thinks (consensus seems around 0.5%, that's using populations like Iceland might meaningfully healthy) wanted know list hospitals capacity. said hospitals capacity. answer, need lie upset it. expected Trump lead horribly, exceeded expectations.

And also suspect (and fear) things going get lot worse ever get much better.

Trump’s leadership atrocious, expect get drastically worse out.

How bad impact country remains seen, it’s hard see Trump sinking even lower, lower still, still lower - gets desperate angry situation. Since, all, **everything** ALWAYS him. really passes ""apocalypse scenario""?

Electricity water still running. Food still supplied. great war, huge destructive event, massive death toll unknown virus.

It's bad flu season (that still numbers counted flu season count ended months ago).

When go start shooting people secure food source raid costco deep freezer water, apocalypse.

Not stay indoors several weeks government China want tell world fucked released disease citizens. sucks European-American. dad supposed fly netherlands visit parents second wave hits country. planning 2 week quarantine got I’m hoping don’t outright ban going coming US. Also sucks got American citizenship could vote upcoming election might work terms traveling europe. makes sense. add idea know success looks like. California locked nearly three months. wasn’t strict China countries strict could get considering lack social/federal support have. Anyway, days weeks went by, clear beyond locking time feasible plan forward. locked neighbors Arizona partied on. assumed, soon started open Arizona starts flooding bring infection them. Trump treated virus like PR issue instead public health crisis. never chance United response without option least focus control. It’s either/or thing. both. Lt Governor Texas said that. Statement 1: Human human transmission scientifically Statement 2: virus spread highschool dropouts equate Statement 1 Statement 2

This asinine rebuttal. No, millionth time, Dr. Wenliang Li arrested, called local police station spent 1 hour signing form, acknowledging wrong claim virus SARS. 

Irrelevant. could tea party. timeline what’s relevant. That's China informed regarding virus. time, China faced virus may may transmit ppl, may may legal, could well ""just flu"".

So might flu, contagious, might contagious. Great. Also doubtful claim given fact despite month alone information took week public scrutiny China admitted transmissible humans. absolutely wrong claim SARS scares ppl. Furthernore eye doctor released patient's test result... even patient.

Maybe that’d damning wasn’t actually SARS 2 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Wuhan government incompetent. leaders refused pay serious attention local CDC folks. CDC folks reluctant put careers line (e.g., doubling swear bosses thing legit) -- also know whether something serious not

Usually people dying that’s indicator seriousness. don’t really believe Chinese doctors public health officials don’t agree. find funny westerners put high standard Chinese governments -- allowed make mistakes. Yet ppl lenient governments.

I don’t see that’s relevant we’re talking address it, you’re one conversation excusing governments failures. support suffering hundreds thousands people go abroad start new life?

Why wrong make better life oneself involves moving different country. Getting residency citizenship multi-year process, travel restrictions harm thousands people finished process. I’m quarantining in-laws suburban Massachusetts I’m really upset people wearing masks outside Yes!!! Thank you! Damn he's dumber originally thought. That's insane think happens super famous super rich.

It's irrelevant super famous super rich. He's really really good tennis. mean he's super smart rocket surgery anything. People need stop listening random celebrities listen actual subject matter experts. US citizen wish say 2 things
1. us sorry
2. fair Crowd stands excitement become winded standing Rona must sit back down. parks closed back March, reopened. second shutdown it’s campgrounds. learn **ACTIONS** **CONSEQUENCES!!!!** I've said too! want follow ups prison reports said almost everyone asymptomatic. stay way? Seems like perfect environment actually able track data yet I've seen follow ups. Contest credit card company. airlines give shit help card companies give shit fight us. study you’re referring doesn’t good enough methodology make inference Going fine... everyone part wearing mask.  Painful, smart decision. Wish lived country government treated citizens like living, breathing, feeling entities. Lousiana nutshell. find bizarre continually attacking someone trying save lives best can. want angry, angry Trump knowingly lies shit admits it. Three little kids always leave little free time gardening great. garden fancy like years due nurseries like normally would be, still really peaceful work nice outside. 

I spent $0 impulse plants probably need though unlike years least there's that. breath smells like cat food gonna pretty big clout. Historic. ranting tiger blood. remember assuming going dead months, right now, seems straightened out, gone sober, good. Hope holds. “Wear masks, courteous. world isn’t you! It’s 9 million us [New Jerseyans]”.  Lol great quote governor US, cognitive dissonance charts. hear one breath someone talking numbers really bad another state proceed talk good thing everything opening area surely things getting better, willfully ignorant fact community spiking well. wonder mass exodus SF residents counties plays role. live one Bay area resort town work another. story places vacation homes. Rich people terrified city right actively buying properties less dense areas already one hunkered since March. Yeah understand it’s hard form new habit. Took it’s important staying healthy keeping clean bathroom. Almost makes sick thinking shit particles flying air flush, hot shower turned hot air mix particles float around🤮 Exactly, mean sounds inane. Basically it’s saying try climb top that’s risky. prob like 20 bucks.. literally said that's thing happens. jobs authoritarian dictatorships. Yeah. I'm south shore coast. Lots beaches. issue hundreds thousands people work study America stuck outside risk losing everything due restrictions.

Bottom line, travel restrictions wrong Trump 2017, wrong countries it.

Coronavirus cannot excuse rip apart people's lives everything they've built restrictions (either lockdown restrictions, travel restrictions). Except what’s even crazier Universal isn’t even making money open. laid hundreds theme park employees today attendance dead 😐 seen American fiance since August, I'm afraid get see year. going tough. way, invested lot production facilities. record breaking production invention. Bill gates helped donate billions set large scale production. don’t believe data say definitively immunity wears off. 

I think verdict still that. Taxpayers money? Correct I'm wrong state income tax Florida? also mythbusters episode tested hot air hand dryer vs paper towels hot air spread crap June 24, 00:00 (UTC+9)

+51 confirmed : total 12,585

20 imported

31 local transmission

+0 dead : total 281

+22 declared virus-free : total really like titles news agency.)

Quarantine procedures ports revealed loophole seen cluster tied Russian ship. Port workers exposed unknowingly. I'm south shore coast. mean, data shows positive cases going roof Texas I'm sure much fudging going on. There's definitely jurisdictions overwhelmed volume. I'm scared :( Social distancing doesn’t really work much it’s essential people interact come contact various reasons needs. Many East Asian cities never luxury social distancing, people packed metro even height pandemic, virus never spread uncontrollably like US.

**The key success reducing transmissions really everyone society wear face mask....** guess think vaccine within year? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nope, protests. I'll take half million people arm arm coughing tear gas 2 weeks people spread beach weekend. people care anymore coronavirus back March everyone cared people don’t die needlessly? happened? want add know herd immunity thing yet, humans build strong immunity corona viruses.

Plus thing i'm worried long term effects 1, 5, 10 years line? already know there's people recovered 6 months infected.

What triggers strong immune response coronavirus causes common cold similar dengue fever see lots people immune disorders fatalities coming 5 years. world leaders everything. instead re-investing country, believed taxes theft “trickle down” economics sure thing whole time wealth gap widened. don’t deserve shit. Train really, really hard. says never asked slow coronavirus testing

So Trump good guy all. another month it’ll bring us ankles. blame them. CDC said death rate 0.4%? well said. exhausting, like said, going be. Yeah, one thing hear bosses refusing let nurses wear masks, might frighten patient. Frankly, would scared doctor nurse wearing mask. It’s weird that, right?! Definitely rather wear mask end ventilator. Yeah see that. That's plan -- stay inside people can't help go get sick, get infectable population.

I've mostly seen older folks about, though (while driving town rare trips grocery store).  near Natick today paddle boarding (nice socially isolated, reserve pay net etc) beach first time seen lots people without masks here.

Maybe 20% people beach masks crowded ad fuck.

All kayakers paddleboarders wore though.

It felt like somewhat lower income crowd beach, still shocked. Please fuck rest us. Well I’m glad went October then! vaccine within year, way anyone live like years  Make tik toks. know. Im happy either stay home

Don't know white supremacy bigger health risk CVOID right now? going streets protesting we're ending racism forever. Besides, police killed 14 unarmed black people last year COVID killed 31,000 black people. police basically committing genocide long wear mask completely protected. Privileged idiots. really hope US-Canada boarder open up. We're well way things control guys, well, stuff going on. made huge shopping list, hurricane prepping, long shelf life non perishable food plus stuff freezes. TP, cuz I’m taking chances lol. Planning holing long  don’t think so. flu vaccine shortages, went people high-risk groups first (age, pre-existing conditions, healthcare, etc). imagine it’ll similar rollout vaccine. Well, happening, I'm stuck Yep. This.

My Italian exchange son go change J1 (student exchange) visa F1. he's stuck. mess know what'll happen. Oh no! feeling Britain Canada would start considering inane proposal well. taking place months Wuhan lockdown ended last April. Florida. women fired fudging numbers came information going surpress positive cases deaths next week get Stage 4 reopening.

But ""it's flu"" crowd say see...cases down..it hoax we're back square one idiots yet people Florida still elected him.  regional. Western get looks wear masks within passing distance people think. Although people take theyre chilling parks etc others arent close by. Freedom thee. American. smallish hometown elderly mother still lives cases go low 10s hundreds basically overnight town's subreddit, politely reminded people socially distance, wear face masks, limit trips home essential food shops first response ""I'm free person I'll want!""

Like, really? response toddler tell take bath. exact thing. grown person middle pandemic behave like that. enough absolute human asswipes like there, that's everything non-essential must shut down. People like ""muh freedom"" Jerkface mean can't use common sense can't cooperate adult manner can't maintain low level business activity absolutely bust ball COVID everything infect thousands give shit anyone themselves. literally ruin things rest us.

No world immune types, least places like New Zealand realise morality zombies walk among us force compliance everyone's safety. places like UK, USA, Brazil... attitude ""freedom"" important lives nothing say convince simply shut things much possible month, quarantined anyone ill contain possible outbreaks immediately, life could mostly return normal. no. keep flinging shit around faster cleaned fucking fit everything's covered shit. trillion. Billion. Stay strong. know hurt right decision. live italy, even though reopened precautions, go probably go months checking in: wife welcomed first child April, absolute height infection here. we've doing:

- Stay home much possible. think give up, that's remind working, stay more. 
- Wear mask go - includes hikes walking street - unless absolutely certain come contact anyone else. Even still, bring one case.
- use hand sanitizer touch anything public. especially includes come supermarket/Target/Walmart
- Wear mask go out
- avoid anywhere people group up, especially indoors, much possible.
- Wear mask go out
- wash hands change clothes get home packed indoor place like supermarket
- meet people, family, etc., keep distance share food, etc. 

Basically, act like global pandemic vaccine available! complete nonsense live EU. people live know anything eu policy keep commenting it. weird. get brain damaged every time see posts 

# [Money Printer Go Houstonians, city *is* world. Honestly USA given tracing month pandemic.

At point pick tracing would need test entire populations like China think that's happening. testing capacity without defensive protection act, privacy concerns would mean many people going refuse test even free. 

Trump basically pushing herd immunity strategy without stating it. EU travelers travel US? need yellowstone volcano eruption get X formation mini prize read list? one _very few_? Surge!!! Yeah they're constantly exposed hope PPE measures protecting them. keep patient everyday. I'm grateful work home.

And yeah aerosolization word. Thanks replying. 5 million tech workers? Silicon Valley 250k.... Man, I'd love asthma break. kind soul sucking dependant meds Blast border 1850s cannons spears? Lol different systems think need look beyond presidential role, seems need clean house layers government. 
So many politicians years perpetuating broken system gain. forgotten supposed represent whole society parts pay them. fair, testing widespread now. Three months ago practically needed doctors signature get test. Many places offer PCR test anyone. 

There still limits testing. One test sites Dallas line cars 3 blocks long hit daily limit tests 11am. labs analyzing tests much capacity, samples tested within certain window places still lot excess deaths, hiding purpose. Look increases pneumonia deaths - absolutely see seasonal spike summer. That’s hide them.

There also excess deaths non-COVID patients. nurse UTSW reported (unofficially) patient coded died ICU rooms full. Victims car crashes serious injuries happen daily basis able get care need COVID patients filling hospitals. kinder surprise June.. wonder July bag

Yellowstone Volcano eruption earthquake still grabs No, stop developing critical thinking. Yes sure one rally thousands protests going every day. bad overall ignorant society apparently let politics emotion drive decision framework rather science good old fashioned common sense. Protester cases peak week problem it? know hate trump patently true. plenty complaints EU, one example : know waves hit country. kills lot Sweden first, lot less second third, vice versa Denmark, work. number sick, dead, bankruptcies, debt, unemployment... lot factors consider. calculate years saved, cost years saved, poverty rate, etc.

We put price tags everything, including lives. also need think intangibles like vacations taken, weddings missed, schooling lost, freedom denied.

America founded 'life, liberty, pursuit happiness.' Saying one three good North Korea China decide. America. We'll take two three keep three three. Yeah, may cost, we've fought good fight keep way. Freedom free, people take freedom types give back. Jeez, Europe conglomerate federal states, pretty much like USA. picky, feel free continue without me. Ciao. wonder could tracers call well known advertised number that's easily recognizable, like (777)777-7777, also prevent scammers using it. States ban American citizen coming country major changes Politics/views virus spreading virus. really hope Europ don’t let US / Brasil people in. allowed, 2,5 weeks quarantine testing. 

Last advice would close Inner state travel. Sorry US states really tried best controlling spread, locking down, force Mask use. Others done opposit don’t let theme ruin hard work others done. Stay mess. man, healthdata.org projection says NY 19949 beds needed 13011 available peak. know I'm talking lmao Good thing really, keeps annoying Americans Home infected... Honestly thats fair. break toys want play yours. biggest fear long distance Canadian I’m US dumbasses making situation worse, restricting leisure travel lot longer necessary. It’s shitty time. even TRIED thoughts prayers?? find claim article cite. fact explicitly state US currently qualify due metrics EU uses decide allowed isn't: disruptions caused ban, European officials involved talks said highly unlikely exception would made United States. said criteria creating list acceptable countries deliberately kept scientific nonpolitical possible. Including United States now, officials said, would represent complete flouting bloc’s reasoning. said United States could added later list, revised every two weeks based updated infection Maybe. going different case case basis. Expat migrant differ overall goal motivation moving one country another. So, went „best world“ „#20 one single country“ one post. Why, thank you. hair long clippers, short DIY scissors. give months, it'll get long enough reach trim. It’s rogue, uncaring federal government. really. states hit hardest early on, like ones mentioned, actually better took seriously. States like Florida currently lot new cases every day states like New York. right

No. lack fully functional track trace somewhat problematic, there's functioning parts there. 

Most things still open certainly life 'resumed' way appears US. 

The biggest problem, could overcome little leadership UK, lack mask-wearing. Lol. making ridiculous false statements base does? Best test slaves first. got tested, get COVID-19.

#TrumpLogic

/s death stats, actually far worse per capita take consideration EU. yes, obvious talking EU comparing USA North America. we? exactly happening. Governors basically choosing keep job feed family sacrifice thousands people don’t even know.. hmmmm Pretty sure individual masks logged, record bought maximum number 3 masks week. way buy masks would buy people bought masks, would leave without masks, one Korea willing because... people educated understand masks necessary. perhaps could borrow ton people's IDs look like visit bunch different pharmacies.

But since pharmacy going give max 3 masks per week, quickly becomes unsustainable worth time investment. country longer problem resellers. stared counting economic unions countries idea fuck give go Thanks clarification! wonder reason certain people want wear masks. literally know say besides ""get out"". Trump: DECLARE WAR COUNTRY EUROPE! 
soon fired WH intern: Mr. President, can't say declared war expect anything happen.
Trump: say it, declared it! EU would still allow citizens go US well situation, yeah?

She isn’t able come due family reasons anyway, hopefully others take advantage situation allowed live Houston I’m community facebook groups. lot fighting whether it’s effective wear masks lot people talking they’re gonna “stick man”. shit sad. Yup, airborne transmission 100% fatality rate bottom barrel. also everyone 600-lbs Life ends up. know, checking blindly Worldometers equal knowledge right? Thanks Trump.  see excess death statistics Europe  Herd immunity happens years years (which includes many deaths along way), vaccine made big enough percentage population takes it. immunity, without vaccine, literally ignoring virus letting people die it. Cool thanks - good info people know Since counting continents countries? job, impeachment removal office. Also, one % end ICU stays two weeks, need 4,6 million ICU-weeks. sure capacity US is, doubt done year. Yeah. Seems like pretty shitty political move pretend exist ignore 4 months election day. think thinking resurgence fall could get elected sprung again. Either way, see people ever forgive kind ball-dropping. agree u lives equal sense. now, death rate among younger folks low well. 

Also considering known health complications brought severe coronaviruses general (lung scarring respiratory damage) unknown long term complications sometimes reported field. sure long term health impact even motivates hundred millions exercise more.

why fuck think lmao

I remember remarking coworker March ""this bad China shows we're fucked, literally optimal political system apparatus place keep control they're still getting slammed"" Dude I'm even upset. want set record straight. definantly want guy think making light affliction. Take grain salt. agree need mask social distance CA numbers:

5200 deaths - 2700+ nursing home. 300 Jails. means 2000+ deaths state 40M. breakdown CA: Deaths COVID aged 18-44 Caucasian : 22. unspecified underlying condition. dont even know underlying condition. IFR 50 0.05. 

Same Black peron aged 18-44. 12 deaths. ( Blacks arent affected much news says CA) .... Hispanics unfortunately disproportionately affected. Data says transmission happens home lot LAtinos live together lot.. 

I think need wear masks, stay informed use common sense. Breakdown IFR age range health take necesary precautions start Memorial Day weekend? seemed big re-opening. Shiiit I’m 5’6’’ living never see anything concerts. embarrassing thing barely pee urinals cuz they’re high, mention hard use furniture here. Whenever go back America feel lot taller despite still short haha educated thing say fools rampant Facebook. . sometimes go read posts, like wading brain sewage
 
The evil evil part wants catch Was. 1000 new cased yesterday. shops open since last week country unified full lock down. waiting see cases spike reopening relaxing. Poeple could wear masks overall. pubs still closed still taken seriously. close pubs UK joke. really. cant remember last time stamped travel. use face scanners now. Holy shit galaxy brain level eugenics. Rethink morals dude. Right, dumb fucks laughed idea travel ban. Called stupid shit it.

Why can't dumb fucks use brain? Whether worked found done. 

Brainless fucking mutant. Contact tracers calling know anyone supermarket know phone number. need tracing app notifies I've near infected person, better yet, notifies I'm getting near one. Well guess fulfill promise American people. dem, gotta admit I'm wrong. Big difference Swedens healthcare system danger overloaded. Hope Trump go reciprocal ban. Want go US next year. clue, older sister keeps telling get 90 day fiancée since she’s obsessed show MD Anderson tussle top five cancer hospitals US every year. That's it. said Europe original comment, EU. population Europe 746M 2018. death stat cities would much lesser EU countries Land free baby! problem 80 year old probably 10 year life expectancy even lot risk factors 5 years. would consider few. second problem may still young people particularly sensitive COVID-19 without knowing. infection kept low, individuals protected infection runs rampant get infected also lot younger people dying. 7th? comon, got 50 states, ain't even past quarter yet, clam everyone fine /s #OrangeVirus Oh yeah. Coworker. say 99% confidence 

I rarely go anywhere(pregnant fiancé) I’ve super careful.  work tiny office 4 people including me.  Last Friday one went home feeling sick, come back Monday sick. decide fuck this, I’m going back home work like state (and office) reopened.  2 days later, start feeling sick gets positive results. 3 days later get positive results along 3rd coworker 

So make long story short, yes do; work. don’t high risk job, sit computer exact shit house I’d hate shoes. Probably sucks watching house burn fire extinguisher hand told can’t use Welp. American living UK I'm probably going get fucked. Brexit may actually help here, getting really fuckin dicey That’s quite bit different referral Mayo Clinic, stated. falsehood.

for 3rd time - QUOTED ORIGINAL web link Mayo. Jeez people, read spreading false information required get tested simply ok right now

I quoted 4 day old info, asked BETTER info have

The OP discussinng title ""looks like"" HUGE infection rate Azm right? see people makein ""holy crap"" comments level ""understanding"".  I'm responding pointing 1/3 positive rate (as far public data says days ago....) people ""already showing symptoms"" 

IE ""general public""....

I give :)

Cheers. working covid-19 vaccine open avenues towards researching vaccines coronaviruses there? high US make 'the best *world*'. Let's fair, US known exemplary healthcare. said safest place home, poor people get back work. happened Delaware today?! Yea Canada working cansino. still don’t know try get hands oxford though. Interesting. whole situation crazy. Hopefully everything turns better year now. Texas opened soon. shocker. entire story really weirdly handled. ""**Two hair stylists coronavirus wore masks. 140 clients. tested, none got sick""**

That's true. 1 Hair Stylist sick, infected co-worker. Fortunately seem infected anyone else. second coworker infected first, time. can't say ""no one infected, except person infected"", make sense. quote deeper immunologist said picture long-term effects beginning become clear, saying believed around one 10 patients hospitalised disease would “quite persistent problems”.

1 10 hospitalised different 1 3 infected. Lots different numbers plausible fundamentally educated guesswork, headline taking absolute worst possible figure find. Speaking which, Germany probably manager Europe. Everything go wrong.

But american people dont care people die accept select like care. dude seriously need stop talking much ass read fucking history facts. America Canada intertwined *neither* nation would fare well cut ties.   

If talking never centralized economy, developing trade (say, let's go back sometime things colonization, globalization even existed). technology shit. we're talking bare bones situation, US Canada would thrive own, *just like before*.  now, couldn't.  

Stop acting like America end everything. guys would completely fucked without support nations would. Hence term ""Global Economy"". 

Also go fridge nothing American shit. 

Fucking what? Lmao. people know, included, buy Canadian products. purchase Canadian dairy, sugared shit US. 

My fridge stocked nothing Canadian products, Canadian owned stores, Frills, President's Choice products. Canadian franchise store, owned Canadian citizens. Loblaw coporation Canadian. 

There Krogers Wallgreens here. brand shit stores. 

How ignorant world you? Aside food, shit, like ours, comes fucking CHINA.  mean long smell normal, there’s mold, aren’t stale etc shouldn’t harm way new infection rate graphs like rocket launch. positive test percentage rate double national average. today governor announced initiative put decals participating restaurant windows good behavior... Oh turn tables Lighting one honor u/candysupreme wouldn’t mind, could describe does? mean, make harder breathe? use inhaler more?

Kudos wearing one anyway! thanks you. Shhh careful, Reddit like disrespecting white utopia shithole countries? guess 3 months figure shit asking way much Congress. 

What bunch shit eating turd burglars Man, hoax really convincing, huh guys?! Please get help :/ answer half questions land border still closed knowledge. fly US Canada though. can’t get Canada different country people take ivermectin? give horses dewormer says eat... honestly curious, snark intended. wish didn’t smoke last pot day.

My hope come true prediction cdc advises 3 hours patients dentist don’t good ventilation! Haha laugh, makes take masks off. Lol Plus lot Americans seem understand delayed gratification.

Yeah see every 4 year. quite uncanny. Duh People money live closer together. can't afford places nice big lawns shit. difficult understand folks. also probably working service jobs asshole bosses WFH. *raises hand* haven’t seen Irish girlfriend since April. expecting soon. Booked flight yesterday fly two weeks....that’s definitely happening. Reasonable prudent exist Florida. Warm winters positive I've seen. Hurricanes suck too. remember guys literal specialised task force dealing pandemics got scrapped Trump (the person yet run successful business) ‘doesn’t like paying people aren’t anything’.

Let sink fuck in. Plus trumpy retaliate with? 2020
Sucks Good old adage “power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely” Florida tried ban people NJ plates entering couple months back. made sense since big outbreak here. I’m staring think NJ close border Floridians since we’re pretty good FL unmitigated clusterfuck. could thousands Hawaiians whose income depends tourism, right?

Not break bad thing plan place either slowly bring tourism back otherwise help wise move Hawaii's leaders. Genes high iq downvote dawg Wtf lol... wow Amazing right quick point fingers protesters... crowded rallies, bars, restaurants A-OK 1 hour delay fetching comments.

You make good points elsewhere, clearly much learn viruses. Hello people hope good quaratine. I'm ask questions:

1. many cases worldwide?

2. many cases USA?

3. many cases Illinois, USA?

4. many cases China?

5. many cases countries?

6. many deaths worldwide?

7. phase vaccine currently?

8. many factory plants open worldwide(if cant answer dont to)

9. many people outside everyday town? form government impossible implement isn’t “pretty great” form government  mean, party support Hispanic children cages so... would say par course. double capacity using existing facilities.... hope arrogance going fuck figuring utilize Jerry's world Agreed.

Nothing really closed first wave 1918 pandemic quite mild. less disappeared summer. problem fall wasn’t reopening soon, ignoring lethal strain arrived overseas. you’re going make historical comparison, second wave comparable initial outbreak.  means currently fix end date. soon US gets control end. example two months. Congress? Trump listening warnings? Congress problem. Write representatives. That’s did. also made simple comfortable masks don’t hate wearing them. 🤣 EUnuchs People flocking Massachusetts education staying going since 1600s. like sort new thing. 300+ years significant factor people reacting present circumstance? raise interesting question. guess first glance either want pay privacy concerns related study.  hear ambulances running circuit outside window take seriously boy Europoors biggest chip shoulders. vein balding heads starts bulging obsess 'murica every 8 minutes sound like beginning horror story! said gentle mate lol scary I’m glad happen, I’m somewhat glad see global stance taken US here.

The people keep downplaying virus ones responsible this. enabling president party make shit decisions leading international change US. 

As someone U.K. want see US thrive. watching across Atlantic last 4 years fucking painful (not like we’ve hot either...), especially last year though division COVID created. actions consequences, one consequences. one people never took lockdown seriously complained quarantine laws state; well done, responsible isolating America another continent, unprecedented circumstance. *points Antarctica* “this continent right here, sir” Yeah, trust president let us know bad... seems like solid strategy... literally run hospitals themselves? Bahahaha! kinda forced masshole driver unfortunately. try going hospital sick people are?  could go wrong  much compensations companies workers EU currently… completely understandable, wait long enough couple us hightail here? Unnecessary human suffering... Everything’s bigger Texas!! Life expectancy potentially begun make significant nosedive...

-America Thanks. Worst case say no. wait till hear accents! would protests anyway - we've seen black people murdered cops. 

But agree likely much larger given many work. city massive protests continue weekdays, definitely would smaller people jobs. Yeah. always ask people age parents. Goes heads time. economy first people also mysteriously people likely blame virus Chinese conspiracy boost economy crash world- understanding detrimental effect virus like country economics.

China lost global faith, sure great plan destroy west, America needs open save economy, even opening crash said economy destroys bonds countries don’t want get sick again. 

Meanwhile continue subscribe divisive politics, threaten protect way armed violence necessary.
All need complete clusterfu ck arm citizens pit removing body authority... 
Oh fuck. 

Why Americans think Chinese even need conspiracy bring down? They’re better job themselves. Better candidates opinion. pull ICU data directly Texas Medical Center API. online.

Current use 1207 1330 beds 90.7% ""normal capacity"". thread about. TMC surge capacity 2207 beds, listed unsustainable involves triaging gets ICU, counted calculating % capacity.

 Maybe argument whether unsustainable capacity counted not, idea got 2800 from. That's \~27% higher maximum emergency surge capacity doomsday scenario. makes absolutely sense would ""warning"" threshold. say let group natural selection continue take place. Deaths soaring numbers. absolutely, especially free testing services protests accurately capture transmission. 

Just imagine, massive groups people, sweating, yelling, perspiring, choking tear gas, rubbing eyes pepper spray month. course going spread, even supported thousand ""health officials.""

American good state right now. cant tell do! I'm uh goddamn murican!.

 Really even bother asking point? Cant let everyone die ones live inherit better earth? You’re oxygen thief living rent free. think underestimating time takes exposure illness along. Maybe extra week 14 days average, upper limit. Bankruptcy might best option, consequences significant describe.

Do authoritative source segment funds bulk premiums? Yeah. Lol. Dude knows someone went Holyoke. 

The seven wonders world - great pyramids Giza, Denny’s, hanging gardens Babylon mean, I'm sharpest knife old cutlery drawer myself, that's darn tootin' anyone know reliable scientific studies researched rate infection asymptomatic pre-symptomatic people? I've trying research found studies... studies I've read far, seems like guessing game still. So, think still unknown... People die. Like not, almost everyone died terrible health likely would died sometime soon anyhow. Theres moral compass issue. Death happens. guess staying house bc many people killing cities. That's moral question. /r/liberalgunowners happy welcome you! got firsts tax returns years ago, couple target shooting firearms nice practice too. boy scout, shooting 18/25 clay pigeons 14, I've always loved shooting 😁 Zero deaths luck. think there's anything special number. better report would biggest nations _low_ deaths (say less 10 so) There’s million reasons mask wearing little kids ineffective I’m glad hear someone expertise know saying something, governors aren’t listening teachers it. Wow, 2nd age 20 death I've heard 2 days complications. child heard age 0-9 group ""But hydroxychloroquine, works. take it. probably take it. works. Let's hope works. nothing lose take it. I'm going take it. I'm probably going take it. Everyone start taking it. Combine Zpack, ignore warning labels. know I'm talking about. CHINA!"" one fucking day. horrible. many people. point, case OP posting 2 year old article say ICUs filled past regular flu seasons, virus fLu 

But maybe misinterpreted OP’s intent. rate Arizona place go holidays... surely they’ll achieve herd immunity unmitigated spread. prevent spread deadly disease. yes, prevent death. I’m shopping thats covid infected people going. Boris Johnson same. kind sad people first world country need affected directly get shit together. Sorry dumb question, can’t lot increase reported cases related better access testing? good site tracking full hospitals state are? feel like would much better indicator bad things vs months ago feel bad TX FL residents particular. governors tossed jail way they've handled shit put people risk. ignored information already states like mine M

It's fucking absurd. understand Italy Spain poorly - first outside China little information work with. Hell, I'd even understand NYC since first US spread surprisingly fast. However, places put right measures knew bad. Everywhere else? Fuck it, let's nothing. Maybe specific schools look data applicants per spot fewer applicants per spot vet school versus allopathic medical school. course could go carribean medical school osteopathic medicine school data doesn’t back claim normal medical schools tracker shows counties cities highest per capita infection rate?

&amp;#x200B;

It adjusted testing per capita, anything shows density infections stays date?

I've done research believe living least top 5 place, course news cover frustrating. bother evicting? going get move start paying rent?  Huh. would’ve figured mostly Mormon state would good following orders, would ride relatively well. That's encouraging! hope show vote! argued invasion Fallujah. talking ass. afraid say that. Sorry, president can't understand helping people help well. brain garbles wanders get helping people part. know masks dramatically drop spread.

While true, masks also turned kind ""shirts vs skins"" team designation politicians. Stupid fuck. give examples?  get Theranos mess people bought hype. that, he's seemed pretty honorable throughout life? Oh, that’s nice, least. keep increasing restrictions. wear mask, even outside, within 30 feet people. Making healthy lifestyle changes seeing benefits (like fighting Covid) would take year two. 

Also, healthy people get virus rate unhealthy people. Health come play (but always) dying covid. USA’s IFR higher countries mentioned?

The main difference US countries containment spread virus. “reopen immediately” crowd cannot understand. cannot force economy good businesses open pandemic. That’s cool death rate still .0041 fuck witb fear mongering lmfao Taiwan great nation. proud. Yup, dates set stone. always ""no earlier than"" there's spike, proceed next phase. data dependent. incredibly good reporting analyzing data; daily portal one best I've seen, look every state region work. I've tracking local cases looking local hospital admissions, too, give idea city doing. things wish would better increasing testing (though made easy protests thankfully) tracking reporting recoveries. party done everything show incompetent are. TX FL getting exactly voted for. Anyone arguing hospital workers even wearing masks part problem here.

Of course are.

So much stupid really outdoorsy person. keep thinking 12 mile trail run though. Sadly real back reported times time gone Florida need go full lockdown. know test tracing mask wearing closed places helps bring Rt bellow 1. local government incompetent care.  too. Unless it’s illegal immigration, Chicago gun violence, something view threat. they’re willing show amount brutality hear gun control evil 2018 bad flu year - good reminder sometimes even “just flu” major problem. suppose question is, hospitals change anything better prepared year? Check fine print!! I’m pretty sure still go student exemption. 

There’s always way. Don’t give up. :) literally don’t believe happened New York real can’t happen Texas don’t “live top use subways”. It’s dumbest shit I’ve ever experienced.  It’s like politicizing heart disease something doesn’t make sense. love reading threads realizing everybody seems story absolute moron know absolute morons. Birds feather that... Well better president suggesting people drink bleach shove flashlight throat. context _Michigan_. Florida never actually closed. protests create spike Corona? 3 weeks since started. Rioting =/= protesting. system shit always shit real change. hOt wEatHeR kIlLs vIrUs Australia New Zealand leaders. think makes huge difference. Yes understand thousands (perhaps millions) speak of, always thought virus even getting cold flu alongside could become comorbidity. Imagine really bad case bronchitis covid. Even mild covid might exacerbated additional strain system overall. combined strain lungs multiple things top covid cannot good. Makes wonder would happen otherwise young healthy person mild case also catches bad case something else top that. company Houston. It’s posted door “you must wear mask enter” people look sign stand door still ask wear mask. instructions corporate “we mask police” know —safety. notice got yesterday compared don’t want us confront shoplifters. Yet wear one entire shift. It’s infuriating. one Moody st? inevitable confused political leanings. Florida Man Edumacated Fall quarantine New Yorkers (in NY) came Florida spring. Seconded. Holy shit wife hardcore. really heard CFR-denominator problem yet? Everyone talking since Feb...

The ""cases"" numbers almost certainly lower real number people dealt virus. asymptomatic cases never tested, lighter-symptom people never tested, people wanted tests get, false negatives / bad swab technique, real ""risk ratio"" ought much bigger number denominator.... i.e., lower final result.

(Also deaths truly Covid19 possibly well, especially global stats / countries like Brazil could lot uncounted deaths, believe less undercount... Deathly ill people likely get tested lightly-symptomatic people.)

Now, depending ask, ""case undercount"" could 2x, 10x, 100x. CFR ratio comes 5% death actual tested-case numbers, correspond real fatality ratios 2.5%, 0.5%, 0.05%. call **IFR** (incidence fatality rate), number takes account *all* probable real cases tested/proven cases.

Note: lot incidence numbers come corners political bias (those want re-open economies want portray fatality rate low / less dangerous, want claim cases wayyy undercounted).

So measure many people *actually* infection swab-test count probably undercount? ""antibody studies"" come in.

Here's one real death-rate test seems believable me: [In early May, NYC seems 20% antibody rate (number people Covid That's 1.7 million population. time, NYC 18,574 deaths. So... *real* death rate (the Incidence Fatality Rate) would roughly 18k / 1.7m... *roughly 1%*...

In Iceland disease necessarily less deadly rest Europe, one countries tested **massively**. [""the country aggressively testing virus—on per-capita basis, highest rate denominator actually real sampling population, undercount represented ill... That's got 0.5% CFR... IFR CFR probably diverge much all.

There [other anti-body show similar sub-1% fatality.

TL;DR... **You cannot use Case Fatality Rates (deaths cases) derived main data trackers covid cases, estimate many people would die everyone got it.* use denominator *studies* actually try determine real incidence Sars-Cov-2 population... results far point around half percent one percent. lot people think many health officials focused flattening curve start pandemic. people thought overwhelming healthcare system goal, therefore everyone would eventually infected. flattening curve really minimum goal. Reducing containing spread larger goal. 👍🏻 Try conversation rural conservative town. Half doctors surgeons kept telling people socially virus big deal, spreading fast, and/or people safely go work. eyes PhD someone ""can't handle real job"". Try talk people epidemiologists, virologists, environmental health follow except say ""well matter look **doctor** said!""

A weeks ago, friend showed video facebook 20 people bachata classes (that's *very* close contact dancing) included doctors nurses ER. go latin dance classes together, mad studio closed decided shifts. protective equipment, time critical shortage tests patients long delay results. ain’t happening, babe. control. We’re fucked. I’m California go see 100% compliance masks. We’re still explosion cases right now. It’s fucked.  suppress numbers, even suppress reporting overwhelmed hospitals, eventually cannot hide stories people really going on. outdoors type person? Backpacking, camping, kayaking fishing go-to relieving stress (as long away others). Getting middle nowhere feeling sunlight, breeze sounds nature gave us big push stay-sane department.

Added bonus take lots pictures share get back - something else think/talk family friends. one likes driving, we’re actually quite safe look statistics serious accidents. 

Perhaps learn drive aggressively paying attention. Magic rent checks, yes. Honestly, this. love fairly wealthy town Texas I’d say 30% people wear masks even less practice social distancing. Going back old hometown (of incredibly conservative poor) honestly say going 2 different stores one wearing mask (besides employees) 50~75 customers. town 1 hospital surrounding 30-50 miles it’s going get really bad really quickly. way, seems like ignorant people self-selecting die darwin style. 

In another way, ignorance often infects many innocent people.

Ignorance is........deadly. Recent study Stanford University , isnt first, states covid IFR 0.04 percent. likely die car accident. Also Avg age death world wide 80! 96% deaths comorbidity. facts downvote away Nancy's. Seems msm fear mongeringing works planned folks here. People also considering nurses quitting. stepmom works absolutely fed terrified they’ve treated people aren’t taking seriously. Many quit. Yes, nurses, point realize people don’t care hardship going fall you? 20 million cases already USA lesson learned would really dangerous overall scheme. run president already Gen Mattis. Come on. DeSantis decide OK admit wrong start rolling back lockdowns not. Many people run government don’t give fuck people. Anyone claim expert.  make true. person doesn’t want anyone community catch CoVID19 I’m much protests.

I think change pushed good, spread bad.

And fuck rioters. area Minnesota food desert, lost doctors offices well pharmacies. going devastated CoVID19.

I make clear think rioters protestors group. First NJ, NY MI done best whole thing

Second all, see plenty PA plates Jersey Shore. bout everyone stay corner sandbox nice summer. Fuck that, make fun something control, like unfortunate understanding science public health safety. Hmm think could faked. Also regardless, people start making fuss mandatory vaccination interferes freedom. Ultimately live somewhere intelligent people understand herd immunity, won’t problem. dumb population. Protests anyone? 🙄 many, best bet would finding local EDS fb group best w/ doctor lists finding specialists EDS-friendly. Look “Denver EDS” “Denver zebras” whatever - join one many EDS support groups search city. much support resources online, truly lifeline practical terms. virus could actually saved got re-elected. get us it. peak predicted somewhere mid-July mud-august. daily number cases easily surpass 50k day ""Maybe leave alone, leave us alone..."" father young kids desperately hope want believe article don’t see how?

Kids obviously live adults aren’t likely catch adult it? dont remember Mr. Corona coming leftist shill. political career would ruined people knew politically motivated!

/s Yeah example pat, usual ""you gonna die sacrifice I'm ready make""? According Google

Europe: 9.24 Million Cases| 4.61 Recovered| 477k Dead

USA: 2.9 Million Cases| 740k Recovered| 123k Dead

To says Europe worse response, thoughts? little faith would've thought Kill yourself. hope. article posted March used representative current state. pulled quotes article, helpful actually timely enough relevant case would mislead anyone didn’t check see outdated info is. 

I don’t know meant not, provided false information using date info. Yes, requirements March, we’re late June now. They’re longer true relevant current trend.

I’ll assume accident. careful, though. We’re learning disease rapidly. Sharing outdated info current fact doesn’t help anyone. happen 2 week quarantine

Oh, sweet summer child. genetic immunity disease mostly kill people childbearing age?

Even diseases like measles kills lot kids never resulted natural immunity. Dumb. staters still travel Hawaii access properties (fuck selfish rich cunts)—they quarantine. God hope judge assigned culture warrior ala Barr citizens without exception pieces shit. slow indecisive act early appropriately. American can’t wait travel abroad again. That’s fair. I’m sorry idiots right now.  stay home.

and afford that? Yeah, shit. Thanks proving point lax US immigration law comes foreigners special talent education coming taking jobs US citizens compared every developed country. Every developed country much stricter criteria comes foreigners coming working put citizens first. 

I know, I’ve tried move country even master’s degree legit field (unlike degrees like philosophy women’s studies) enough. Yet US let 40 million illegals 6th grade education less legally lets hundreds thousands others year lesser degrees own. shit needs stop. 

But especially needs stop pandemic applaud countries banning travel foreigners country right now. Don’t forget citizens. Fuck them. ""Can speak experience (from Ireland), would usually say something like "" ""Ah sure sure""
Sorry that's read.lol. relative mine travelled Dubai NY month ago. two years. believers science USA apparently believe long politically convenient since suddenly suspended belief order support mass gatherings people support BLM.

México cases risen nearly badly us, people conscious loving ""normally"", mean they're making 3 hour lines godamn beer, gonna get way worse. situation Joe Rogan scale? still going full Eddie Bravo wearing thinfoil hat back panicking *laughs 9nm* Fuck Americans. Hope get killed. absolutely agree last part. annexation Canada endgame. New state motto: “Look me!!” #KillAllAmericans Good luck. Arizonan entire office save one hoax camp. truly believe numbers aren’t “real” media trying hurt Trump. never even got work home. It’s miracle haven’t sick yet given surrounded absolute morons daily basis. Karens even went far find speakeasy hair salon operating lights weakass stay home order. We’re fucked.  Fun facts

The Texas Medical Center 2 square miles, employs 100k people, 8th largest business district US.

It's largest integrated medical campus US - would Cleveland Clinic.

The TMC comprised 60 different medical institutions, non-profit. So, massive, entirely labyrinth in-patient facilities geared take COVID patients. Although 9500 inpatient bed capacity, shabby. Well Europe even sectoral lockdowns permitted leave area countries even locked people homes except grocery shopping.  live S. Utah weather AZ. 109 today. wore mask last week high 90's issues. Today 109 burned face (I wore blue hospital mask type). part bends nose, left burning red mark. outside 10 minutes unbearable burning hard breathe (and never issues breathing mask before) . wear mask mom serious health issues see going hard, politics not, people wear masks 100-115 outside like AZ, Vegas region suppose close 110 next week. Don’t want non whites running around masks we? Oh mean reopening protests? serious covid, come ok bunch protests something happen country? Compare US South Korea’s “curves”. Bear mind countries first confirmed cases date. look difference two countries responded. US could kept spread contained actually generated public morale, federal government acted accordingly didn’t antagonize public along way. wag finger emphasis. people listen. anti-vaxxers country anyway

Then I’m talking country. US, people surveyed 40% would get vaccine covid invented. There’s way vaccination becomes requirement going club lol. expect blood antibody tests people walking door? most, make requirement return school work, people US fought back too. Well fact mentioning ring bell many there. It’s similar San Diego. Need doctor’s referral insurance. percent positive rate averaged 3% several weeks.

If think 33% positive rate normal, you’re wrong. insanely mind boggling high. 

Even March couldn’t get tested unless Wuhan Italy hospitalized Covid symptoms percent positive peaked around 18% San Diego. AZ’s testing rules capacity far better that.

Your hospitals capacity, % positive rate 33%, I’d guess case doubling rate cratering 5-7 days. Even shut state today, you’re looking cases increasing exponentially ~14 days - hospital system crash. 

I almost want say may God mercy soul, instead I’ll say better hope federal government, New Mexico CA help medical staff supplies fly rest country try bail out. call Silicon Docks reason... UK response much, much closer France, Spain Italy. initial cluster fuck, total lockdown. statistics also similar. care downvotes long people (including bhakts) going links connect dots eventually take precautions.

Every single additional safer human important society large obviously human kins. Peace. Canada's one tenth USA GDP population, one twentieth covid cases deaths, much lower crime rate per capita, greater press freedom, higher rank happiness. integrated state, effects regional stability global politics would immense. Omg totally right. would definitely get tested situation. Tell ""Covid exist"" Lukaschenko Belarus. Problem lousy authoritarian leader problems become tenfold instead getting resolved. See also North Korea could one richest countries world read stubborn leadership. Former (thank god!) Arizonian here. lived Lake Havasu City confirm location earth's scorched asshole indeed there. No, retaliate trolling. 

We like it. New Yorker, seeing many people sub others talk building wall around NYC keep us leaving, would livid didn’t block people coming in. Especially fled Florida height pandemic city. great. Lets see works contract trace many people infects kills. Jesus yo. okay? wall mate, country either.
I thought bit rich ""mass immigration, open borders"" EU, shut borders right quick soon there's trouble. Yep, totally agree. 4 upvotes two awards; comments.

Who hired viral marketing?  This! I'm Australia government advice visit neighboring suburb 'an outbreak'. 

The 'outbreak' suburb less 10. number restrictions even low numbers, e.g. cannot 5 visitors home attend big church services. see US UK opening seems utterly crazy. I'm sorry I'm this. Lol I'm bored late party bro. Maybe next time. resident AZ, amount people see grocery stores without mask absolutely ridiculous. I’ve also seen many people know going together without masks social distancing almost everyday. Ever since restaurants stores opened people think it’s okay go without precaution. amount cases low initially carelessness others, even risk contracting virus. get people tired staying inside, care safety health others, myself. It’s big sacrifice make take necessary precautions. Exactly, thank you.

I think lot people taught scientists come conclusion intuitively false.

I see someone commenting confirmation bias following scientific process, Temporary border closures pandemic impact fundamental human rights? you’re seeing thousands people gasping air deadly disease rampaging country.

What greater overall threat? That, itself, absolutely, 100% take precedence.

Not mention, covid19 even worse minorities, statistics. It’s actually even greater threat racism ever reins aren’t taken it. ask travel essential? Noone US wants go Canada lol, think highly Fauci fucking cool. aspire bad ass. Yeah problem staying outside enjoy air, totally safe, problem restaurants hotels people gather. fairness Yosemite could go ""who gives fuck"" cause person catches virus probably gone time show symptoms, guess stay two weeks. California governor running Yosemite would probably use considering advantage run ""visiting Yosemite best thing pandemic"" campaign Yep better hit 200,000 first end year I’ll ashamed call Floridian Thanks better get it!  Ooh spitting straight facts. Nit aven argument sight wtf PCM? u guts face saloon man miss travelling. Pre pandemic I'd plane every week whether holidays work. I'm getting long haul flights anytime soon. Please dont say forever. appreciate safe eventually would like go Europe. IDK. Data seems suggest unlikely die it?? :( much love barber, didn't.

I bought gadget cut own.

Not good, practice makes perfect next time. right Texas medical center? according Wikipedia that’s 21 hospitals heart Houston. Fuck. Really? would cool.   fail understand globalization think big companies use internet buy/sell products. Anyone would think New York first city experience, hear way many New Yorkers talk it. Wuhan? Milan? New York do, examples it? exactly authorities Wuhan Milan did. denied problem long, took heroic measures little late.

This comment criticize anyone. merely point simple reality: masses people everywhere *learn experience.* Without experience, resist leadership except persuasive authoritarian. love ones advocating safety smart like wearing masks labeled “dooomers”, idiots going like nothing’s wrong real ones bringing doom everyone NY NJ also. hardest hit states really handled well turned around. would someone this? I'm interested. Wow great worthwhile post People kind issues rare everyone wore masks even factor According Reddit, anti-racism protest spread virus. fact, safer going protest Wal-Mart. dont even need mask, provide one you.

Even though 50% North America otherwise refuses wear mask do, stupidly wearing noses. virus specifically said wouldn’t infect protesters racists mall restaurant OMG, hospitals 80%!

We 3 months prepare, 3 months medicines help, 3 months get shit together. 3 months.

Hospitals 80%, means prepared.

Get head, prepared. you? woman. no. Back work last week, nobody follows rules. Shit gonna start closing back weeks Piggybacking provide source: depends place. places taking seriously decent work, blow dryers, ventilation, one person time, masks face shields, waiting room. 

I personally going, hair straight manageable. judge anyone hair that's difficult manage different situation. I'm probably going year. advancement vaccine lately? surprising though, given many places take similar steps similar times, whether they're ready take steps (wrt letting up) Honestly probably better get bed available buy 6 months worth frozen food go outside Jean-Claude Van Damme point simply EU acted like perfectly responding entity virus, responded US haphazard way countries thing US done, states acting own. fact wanted look EU countries supposedly tried best shutdown, like Italy find high percent population die well 0.057% Italians died thus far even worse Sweden. simple fact EU model perfection suffered lots deaths ran hospital beds, US lose people turned away hospitals lost saved.  worth allow ""liberal elites"" w/ ""college educations"" tell anything. 

/s lockdown mate Ahh, fair enough, bad! they’ve said, protests driving numbers decent bit real damage people going back work. 

Outdoors masks low (but still possible) chance catching dangerous place small-ish, enclosed area air conditioners. Aka work environments. So... 2  Texas 2000 hospitalized Covid 2 weeks ago. 4,000 yesterday.

That said, rapid rate technology advancement, using ability replace man hours machine hours profit tool already rich, societal shifts advancement benefit society whole. profit Zach De La Rocha said ""Fuck G ride, want machines making em"" Mass gatherings contributing covid spread? would thought..... 

And thought America putting pandemic hold protest. US states notorious taking long possible report death figures, one really knows excess death count USA. You’ve got trolling right? refuse believe anyone stupid Lmao deep learning it? I'm Aussie. insult NZ - that's job siblings Yet people still complain masks say cause corvid spread faster. wouldn’t call allowing 1,000 people cancelled. April, U.S. President Donald Trump pondered injecting disinfectant could cure coronavirus. Vietnamese suggested remedy scientific basis Facebook, would lasted long government censors. presents double-edged sword local controls media.

Doesn't sound like pro Trump prose I've trip Galapagos scheduled August (I booked June last year) finally got ok dive charter move trip 2021. Wish best! Everything bigger Texas. Including death tolls. Really? 'covid lockdown' trauma? Bitch plz. Tell people developing countries spend decades without access clean water sanitation, constantly feeling civil war, brutal climatic conditions, tropical diseases etc etc. Truth is, 1st-world middle class lifestyle created millions incredibly 'soft' people bad dealing hardship. I'm counting among those. ""i can't breathe"" totally different meaning said people sad reality 😢 state Texas. wants. one power wants Dear Leader tweet them. Also, airport control, quarantine, random checkup police.

 Local Lockdown one case found. Army bringing food supplies locked.

Exactly done restrictions new arrivals country general population. bought time still saves lives could lost we’d even reckless. Think way. Texas almost worse new York, even though NYC much densely populated co-workers like this. I'm health safety office I've trying institute mask policy company president vocal masks ""don't work"" really hard convince people. wear mask whenever leave office try set example, nothing far. another lockdown going get crazy. soon hospitals full majority people loved ones dying home care whole country going pop off. going barricaded houses shooting people get close. never choice lock down, couldn’t right thing without catastrophe. trump admin absolutely destroyed response. said, Asian countries lot going far public health initiatives go. tend lot less individualistic cultures, authoritarian governments, etc. Comparing us Asia work well. Comparing us Europe closer fair. again, you’re missing point. hear subreddit many people died, people aren’t they’re supposed doing, wear masks. 

You don’t hear recoveries, don’t hear empirical research results, don’t hear people treated ventilators. requires everyone’s cooperation

To what? Staying inside vs going isn’t going make vaccine come faster. I’m dense, yes. guess what? don’t give damn anyone else nobody world cares anyone much say do. say care people died you’re lying teeth bet anything didn’t know personally. This. Exactly this. Honestly, govt anywhere could've prevented happening India. 
But atleast death rates lower end thank goodness. Fingers crossed hope stays way. order mask (pun intended) 

Always intend puns. Aussie here. love US direct family there, moment pay let people there. Honestly it’s shitty situation matter side you’re on. 

I believe residing countries they. could treat case case basis. know they’ve allowed foreign citizens travel work places like UK agreed self-quarantine upon arrival. We're guys right lockdowns *because* actually upped testing even higher amounts able produce initial peak we're showing lower rolling average last several months time, whereas several states reopened even proper testing capability, pointing places reopened also testing lowering averages weeks/months already. dealing massive protests civil unrest, people make political statements actively ignoring masks huge numbers. deal fire home judging neighbour stops extinguishing his. Hell, even friends Europe saying reopening seems bit quick, family around world affected countries still see benefit strict quick, early shutdown long term growth economy instead dragging along open, close, open, close instead like seeing Florida, that's pretty short sighted view.

Florida Texas never handle it, decided reopen, hitting record highs weekly, way seem think ""well *those* guys it! too!"", least understand ways situations comparable ways different even considering that. Like said, stop fighting fire kitchen cause neighbours fire out, deal shit first. area hard, great, keep mind guys open borders states totally control, highest percentage infected developed world, lowest testing percentages per capital recently still near bottom percentage, dead last.   employee hired straight college last year tell didn’t feel safe coming office needed work home still, (which fine; uncomfortable/anxious regarding Covid responsibly get work done hit goals I’m cool it) told following Monday went bunch rooftop bars weekend..... Literally who? dont understand mixed messaging stands legally? announce simultaneously cant claim unsafe work? get groceries delivered really try make food stretch. literally think it’s worth physically going get groceries many people regard safety. Texas medical center like small city “hospital”. wearing outside work past week, 10 hour days 85-90 degree weather plus humidity. sucks cant handle wearing mask guest dont go places imo friend doctor Dallas complete denial whole thing. don’t get it. people wearing masks show disapproval Donald Trump, current government employees clamming up.

🙄 Oh man, I'm sure. Thats real coin toss know try it. adore Epcot.  dont think debate efficiency. Yes work.

The question whether compulsory people freedom choice matter.

We usually exactly strict followers facts science. know smoking kills yet smoke. know unhealthy foods yet eat bacon. something different. preferences choices. people prefer freedom safety. included.  Imagine looks like Asia Europe. We're already 3 levels deep ""I told so"" tree. fuck Alaska mess social distancing? I've found Americans, anyone else, desperate avoid reality problems people face systematic. need individualism strong one, Independence Self-reliance championed core American virtues even systems place become hostile ideals reflected reality. 

People downvote want true; likely agree something hearing multiple times, am. care made Victor Von Doom point issue look statistics...you see OMG 90% tell pre-Covid baseline is. little digging reveals currently 26% 90% Covid cases meaning even without Coronavirus hospitals run 70% capacity. (somebody better stats run actual number get point). privately owned profit Healthcare system run maximize profit means prepared things like stress system limits. mean, you’re literally article saying one hospitals one biggest areas Texas filled capacity. It’s sensationalist it’s true. That’s good. like they’re seeing record spikes state anything, looks like responsible move make /s also best PR machine world. Tell Trudeau wear blackface tonight. Health officers lied get medical workers PPE, worked excuse deny medical workers PPE administrators could get bonuses. simply cherry picking city compare country, makes sense all. cherry pick city Sweden show even worse time US. want use NYC maybe eliminated deaths caused Cuomo forcing nursing homes accept infected people, cause 75% deaths NYC. would put NYC level Sweden. one liberals wants ignore huge mistake incompetent Cuomo. People rural areas state beginning go neighboring state laxer rules want eat restaurants stuff. It’s deeply disturbing. Omigod shhhh. keep thinking we're nice they'll keep coming. We'll embrace tattered survivors plague, dude. AFTER. get Maple Syrup Weekly memo? We'll build wall snow make Alaskans pay it. Winwin, sledding epic. think left revealed world everything political matter space couple weeks viciously condemn peaceful protest wish see opening society versus violent BLM protests subsequent looting vandalism followed defended ""necessary"" ""racism currently bigger virus covid-19"" society. 

This un-redeeming damage anyone still thought left centre western societies still believe act good faith. China refused allow quarantine home sent positive patients clinics right away. America went draconian was. eat Canadian every single day.

Wealthy people make poor choices - ever hear Bernie Madoff? Systemic poverty due lack access training, network support needed economic mobility. It’s like someone Maserati disgusted got finish line faster guy foot - going direction, one’s effort gets lot effort other. Europe lot people, no, many places US uninhabitable. many ones huge cities (most obviously Phoenix). population still follow though. NY Times showed freezer trucks outside hospital Queens, along video government officials saying New York problem, people seem care. governors even saying 'We're New York City' sense would unaffected, let alone pockets population. think lack trust confidence higher institutions cause that. Whether fault institutions general state country there's opposition authority probably something studied. clicking link looking links URL would show YMC (texas medical center) major hospital network. you’d spread much possible feeling better? Man saw preview message h notifications phone thought gonna lose eye rolling hard many states center outbreaks super red already Florida well documented hiding/fudging numbers. percent U.S. adults said they're ""very"" confident, increase 14 percent since early April, 55 percent said they're ""somewhat"" one five, survey showed, said they're confident confident protect virus.

I'd imagine 27% find no-mask folk. Seems ""somewhat"" confident would likely wear mask.

Frankly think unusual. ""Somewhat confident"" mean lot things. would definitely check somewhat confident, would like saying

""I understand safety guidelines follow them, can't account others.""

So I'm ""confident"" insofar ability control protect virus. I'm ""somewhat"" confident distancing mask on. enough say absolutely happen. believe Facebook said won’t offer salaries remote workers live cheaper areas.

one thing think much Silicon Valley taking data gathered around world, services used around world, monetizing that, funneling back one small geographic area.

And there, good bit gets sucked local land owners landlords form high rent high real estate prices. 

It would lot better country money spread bit more.  stories pictures overcrowded NY hospitals one factor convincing New Yorkers take coronavirus seriously. stories pictures overcrowded Houston hospitals convince Texans same? anything do? Conspiracy theories. Yep. full lockdown. live HCMC went nearly every day food, exercise, etc. Everybody wore masks socially distanced one another. Basic practices still practiced today hand sanitizers face masks. varies business business really.  Better shut country again! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Stop peddling snake oil bullshit.   got one! asthma attacks, rarely. point even albuterol inhaler. usually attacks morning, get like 4 hours sleep. morning attack used oximeter- 87%! recovered 97% fairly quickly put number felt lol. don’t let Americans ones Netherlands, Switzerland Luxembourg. Oh, taxhaven. 

Apparently Ferrari technically Dutch company, along whole Fiat-Chrysler group. Absolutely ridiculous. I'd say long thing starts effecting lot people's families point actually start seeing deadly virus Slow testing!!

He’s joking guys, cmon

Women girls Sweden reported marked increase pressure pandemic.

Now, Equality Authority tasked improving information violence close relationships honor-related violence.


The increased isolation home due corona virus increases risk violence, according Equality Authority.


- easier violent practitioners check contacts victim taking. Social isolation time online also increase risk children subjected sexual abuse digital media, says Lena Ag, director general authority.


- difficult say exactly situation looks like today. judging everything, situation worsened, continues.


Women girls Sweden reported marked increase pressure pandemic. April, cases abuse women reported close relatives compared month last year, according figures Crime Prevention Council, says Lena Ag.

However, points early conclude due pandemic.


Alert reports young people suspected dangerously ill also increased several municipalities. Equality Authority assigned task identifying developing ways working municipalities disseminate information violence close relationships, well honor-related violence oppression.


- Recently, clear demand increased support among municipalities, says Director General Lena Ag. Great job Canada. 

Must Cuomo plan acceptance skepticism required: fact declining funding 2 testing sites Dallas. simple fact. Call county health department.

why? well given Trump's attitude comments, need wonder why. another reason executive fiat funding agency stating loudly. seems likely petty bureaucrat agency decided emulate POTUS thereby garner Trump's favor putting citizens risk. never safe. learn live virus instead hiding it. Lots countries testing per 100k USA thier numbers going down. Testing problem all. title, wish people stopped editing things internet points.

A total eleven staff department Helsingborg's hospital tested positive covid-19. first case identified early June.


Nearly 100 people working current health care unit may exposed infection, according hospital manager Harald Roos.


- applies categories personnel, service personnel doctors. tested 30 staff eleven tested positive, says Harald Roos.


Which department affected?

- privacy reasons staff patients, want comment it, says Harald Roos.

#Sick patient cause

The infection believed come partly patient admitted ward, partly staff infected outside work. total, two patients, addition staff, tested positive corona. Helsingborgs Dagblad first report affected department.

- patient admitted without symptoms suspicions infection. patient may infected staff possibility staff pass infection next patient. What's tricky even asymptomatic people get infected, says Harald Roos.

No patients infected that, according Harald Roos.

- period, extra care taken patient-close contact, used oral protection cases visor, says.
""It important observant""

Harald Roos believe hospital way failed.

- think see it. suspicion verified, lightning-fast action taken, think done well limiting patient-close contact distancing oneself ward. Unfortunately happen, certainly unique Helsingborg. important thing extremely observant quick, says Harald Roos.

At end April, section hospital partially closed half personnel force fell ill covid-19. department Ängelholm Hospital also affected virus. today reports outbreak one Malmo's hospitals well: earlier week bacterial outbreak yet another hopsital: times Swedish healthcare. :( Tell Daniel Shaver. one lives near houston.... believe many people screaming wear masks... believe anything government control act probably quarantined upon arrival 14 days Atlanta metro checking in. Pretty good mask adherence low income minority areas. Pretty good among seniors. Middle aged whites wear masks though. Hell saw post someone timeline FB stating masks ineffective wearing masks actively make likely get sick. bunch people comments agreeing! Ok AOC hidden agenda?!?

I'm happy see couple people 700ish day wearing gloves handling money many people deal daily Jesus. money important staying home safe. many elder people driving making trips. big question soon get public. least UK government listened scientists.

Proud Bay Stater right now. wear mask protect others inconvenience, even call that. I’m sure wearing mask labeled big pain it’s literally nothing guess everyone’s different. That’s whole thing, everyone cared enough people outside one simple trick spread virus would halt 85%

Something tells someone like doesn’t know think anyone outside you, though.  Something tells might survive it. There's Fax Email Email Fax EHR system.

ARGHGHGHGHGHGHGHG made post there, [but here's article it. referring immokalee similar communities. may highest case rate earth due living working conditions. I'm sure they're spreading infection away immokalee not, case rate insane. seems insane world bought unproven idea, first used authoritarian state 1.3 billion people, without consideration costs sustainability policies. 

Now we’re seeing wave countries locked early, didn’t eradicate virus, face true first wave much weaker poorer position. almost certainly haven’t saved lives, fact much weaker position now. achieved destroy ~20% economy people’s livelihoods. 

The blanket support lockdowns, general “something must done” attitude, abuse vilification people said otherwise sub honestly pretty embarrassing. hope people reassessing views. done strict face-masking distancing beginning. lockdown first achieve anything except make people sick tired lives controlled virus. Damn that’s shitty. Guess can’t go uncles wedding France. blows numbers trail starting July 4th weekend.   

FL can't afford shutdown summer state government go broke make unpopular decisions.  happens state income tax revenue dependent tourism/sales tax revenue replacement. Ah see, thanks can't get link work computer.

What happens Sept/Oct?  Second Wave? *their. Also may want piss others may asking money soon. Donnie really fucked acting sooner convincing people masks bad. joke world. sith deals absolutes, Anakin! Death rate former cases completely irrelevant comes ""should open country not"".

And I'd like know source (not Trump...) behind US testing more, believe likely, much doubt order magnitude (per capita) higher. don’t blame them. also said never kids. People really need stop analyzing trump says like he's normal person. God dammit.

Am interpreting charts wrong (Texas) start trending downward cases middle late May? We’re really sure protective are, two hairdressers south positive cutting 40+ people’s hair managed pass them. wearing masks! pretty-good lockdown start screwed us. People stayed homes month, looked around empty ICUs said, ""Why hell bother that? I'm gonna go lick eyeballs!""

Now we'll lock (maybe?) people say ""Why hell lock down? got better own!"" arguing gloves work people stupid use correctly, two different things. us favor don’t procreate ADDENDUM: FUCKING GUY WANTS PAY HOSPITAL BILLS GOFUNDME.

Not take away much asshole guy clearly nobody deserves get saddled medical bills Maybe put 24 hour call? requiring employees live onsite, dont think tell go restaurant open work. think wise soon enough, choice.  Yeah guess heat isn’t gonna stop huh.   keep tell delivery people - ""just put there, I'll get it."" try walk hand stuff off.

Seriously, want put inside gate leave. I'll give great reviews that. logic I’d warrant guess you’d see similar numbers Hillary. watching Bill Burr special late last night said choices racist literally Satan. I’d bet sentiment isn’t uncommon.  didn’t even know shit still happening. Fucking facepalm Iowa! can’t get stopped least stay home much possible couple weeks 4th, wash hands WEAR MASK!!! Printing money isn’t going magically solve problem what's comparable? fact single study 1918 using crappy data (there's kind) showed correlation, mean locking everything implies vigorous rebound later.

In 1918, large cities quarantines/business restrictions, instituted hospitals already overwhelmed. attempted blanket shut whole states little sign virus locations. There's zero reason expect 1918 pattern, even accurate, hold. China makes virus, unleashed people, contains virus locking country, wait US screw containment, make cure money China already said giving away free vaccine developed.

Cool story bro. group pro-lockdown group likely able financially fine group risk. 

The group least support lockdown one least likely financially fine group least stays risk. 

So perfectly foreseeable  opposing masks? 1.2 million people permanent lung damage

why think would aware this? makes think anyone aware yet? think every recovered patient getting regular lung scans? 

From tell based what? live Ohio, almost never see anyone mask. Ohio kept case increase almost everyday like month, really wanna know becuase keep testing amount people. don’t know don’t cases here. Especially considering 1,000 plus kids high schools got back senior trip, almost groups covid positive. hey it’s senior trip it’s whatever right? (/s needed lol) quite unfortunate. hopefully wake people start voting guy purposefully ignorant sociopath, hold breath. Lockdowns absolutely worked Northeast US, Europe, Asia. fact longer shutdown absolutely destroy virus give time set robust testing contact tracing cause less economic damage wildfire disease.   levels debt we’re throwing heap may choice matter . minor league farm teams makes lot sense!

It’s US didn’t enough information, it’s didn’t act information quickly decisively trend continued today. Hence US among nations struggled handle coronavirus. true!  sanitizer incomplete coverage.

Hand Sanitizer approved alternative method almost every hospital hand washing available. (except norovirus, C-Diff Cryptosporidium ) Gloves - use either hand washing sanitizer regardless gloves treating Nobody sanitizing washing hands touching items store, poor comparison say gloves would problem ungloved hands wouldn't. 

And many people touched phones driving cars wearing gloves false security gloves somehow preventing Covid catching on? 

You might know cross contamination, majority people wearing gloves certainly don't.

I paying attention watching people gloves posting outside supermarket ambulance. (place park impending calls) would say almost never see people using gloves properly. 

They saw us wearing gloves call, see us changing gloves time, seeing wipe every contacted surface either Lysol bleach every call. I'm janitor, seems like great news me. Yay, neutralizing antibodies! tired “free money” nonsense. It’s tax money pays literally everything. tax corporations haven’t paid taxes past decade? maybe little oversight transparency trillions already allocated Covid aid money gone spent? lot money went corporations plenty bank. know going happen money?

Personally, don’t want see dead people streets. But, maybe that’s it’s going take people finally take seriously? knows.

He's said since nobody listened, bring up? killed significantly larger portion U.K. public compared past several years deaths time year.

I care doomers ever brand labelling seem refer to, pure facts.

Virus killed people would normally died normal times, lock U.K. many would died could easily half million people 2020. get much harder realise got impact that.

Of course economy important keeping shut also kill people, that's U.K. opening up. Carefully ... 

Because careful see rise infections cause localised lockdowns... Sure bad young people forget virus spreads like hot knife butter, knows many people get infected product.

And people live too, can't expect locked houses ever...

The sooner virus goes better -
Absolute fact,

And people like downplay actually answer questions bring new argument debate anyway actual legit problem society. Right line height protests. 

First memorial day idiots, blm marches. ain't time mass gatherings -they played stupid game we're reap stupid prize would praise said 3 months ago... 120,000 people died. He's still jackass. percentage accurate literally used percentage situation prove totals important percentages. Like would that?  Well maybe saved money instead buying luxuries like smartphones, etc. fact people live paycheck paycheck shows immature financially. Good study recently correlating education level level concern covid. article stipulates ICU usage barely normal, Covid patients making small percentage overall usage. vast majority scheduled surgeries, normal occupancy load around 80%.  Thank you. completely normal temperature right now, I’m going isolate week safe side. symptoms pop i’ll get test. sucks don’t car, sites within walking distance don’t even know they’d humor me, one wants take potential covid patient car get test I’m sure. if? lol They're stupid, they're greedy. mistake bullshit stupidity - know *exactly* doing. Thinking mistakes born stupidity helps excuse horrible actions complete disregard American people. 


Say me: GREED KILLING AMERICANS!!! Unless somehow stop new people entering, haven't. Wait wave 2 Read said fox news guy visited Houston first time last August. city unbearably hot humid day (I finally understood Americans consider air conditioning necessity) traffic terrifying, everybody drove super fast every car humongous pick-up truck.

But people super nice, chatted us ""just because"", everybody seemed super welcoming patient us whenever messed up. Even cashiers first-ever Chick-fil-A took time explain everything was. city, course, without feeling constant... pressure ? speed? hurry? cities like NY. 

All say, guys deserve better. Best wishes yours, everybody city. 33% horrible, means there's lot bad news coming. C'mon people, learn! soon that. People attended ~~rally~~ intimate townhall gathering caught starting feel slight symptoms, obviously ignore (because know would embarrass Dear Leader). still need come terms getting tested, actually test, wait results come back. Nope, I'm you. understand people think things public go store get haircut. understand avoiding contact people right now, cant understand someone might get antsy sitting inside 5 months straight, idk tell you. age 50? chances 99.9% nothing happening. way of.slowing thing down, geez, think, think.............. America like Brazil India. unlikely reaches 1 million, however USA suffer country end this. Huge reason: we’re fucking fat. half America clinically overweight. 1/3 America legit OBESE. 2500 deaths daily year, let’s say marathon, we’d 2 miles left. 

However, won’t need get fall/winter, simply won’t able handle many sick people (not Covid, common cold insanely bad last year, record number deaths) there’ll be. many hospitalizations. wonder people understand many doctors beds? want say everyone thinking....this isn’t brightest moment Plenty people work need to, survive. paid living wage, go bankrupt die without employer health insurance.

This system made want pay businesses get nothing return except bare minimum promise make destitute next 6 months? No, statements uttered (and oft repeated) opposite known true. Including last one. That's 65% people either retired, work home. 35%? They're ones broke fuck homeless. Exactly. 180k october say. So, throwing numbers, consider two extreme cases, model assumes everyone get october ( know not, follow ) means 0.05 mortality. assume 10% total population get october assuming 0.5 mortality.

so however model set mortality expect something 0.05 0.5, realistically close 0.5 Wich end world ( expecially cause initial numbers showed something around 2% ) still something way worse flu wich order 0.002.

would settle debate ""it's flu""? Dude cases spikes higher ever.

And what... 2-3 weeks?!? Yup, ""former two latter two"" equals four. little dots quote indicate words omitted brevity. Report customers whatever business working through. shit unacceptable. lol DOJ sued state crying can't shut travel. state said FU, pandemic  doubt screw small businesses recession local, state federal government going need economy flourish else even fucked. Paywall. spend money, that's tax revenue purchase, that's tax revenue becuase business kept someone hired paid payroll tax support business. Trickle economics real Good.
Reopening never happened. Burma, Liberia or US suppose. Varies lot area neighborhood. Around parts Raleigh Chapel Hill, mask order people wore masks grocery stores visited, many people wore businesses, almost none neighbors wore backyard get-togethers. Outer Banks - great enforcement masks social distance businesses largish crowds unmasked people anywhere wasn’t explicitly enforcing it.

I friends less urban towns towards mountains much higher percentage people nothing social distance mask up. 


Personally, absolutely party summer worth potential five six figure hospital bill (or risk passing parents) me. wouldn’t attend wedding either unless sister’s. long. want see Mickey getting swabbed. literally way Disney open. US pace hit 40k today.. said told slow testing.

They said kidding, course.

He said kid.

He ends funding testing.

He kidding deadly crime us.  Root-cause would completely feckless media, allows muddled messages hostile foreign propaganda spread, confuse easily-confused. “hurr durr fake news” shut fuck up. bet political ideology anti-mask fucking point. stop deflecting bullshit. I'd rather return lock state zero cases F-N time! Well.... it’s looking good ! Brazil shit show Let's boycott reopening. Really? jackass wanting attend large family gathering deadly, highly contagious pandemic? 

Nice, I'm glad I'm brother! Collins coward lapdog. enables evil doesn’t appear steering ship. ""discredited"" hiding truth, exposed. tried destroy her, yet failed. But, want believe SNOPES (lol) wikipedia. Oh well. I'll leave fantasy. hard feelings. 

Dont worry replying. us know truth happenning. others...choose believe powers be. I’m saying everyone pursue medical degree anything... realize, we’re wired way. realize know I’d really suck sales/marketing position lol 

However... rather heavily focusing mitochondria powerhouse cell HS... think it’d beneficial redefine biology curriculums theres emphasis teach basics infectious diseases. Bc frankly eyes twitch anytime someone says “Im going doctor get antibiotics get rid virus”

Edit: basically, think people would take seriously they’d sense virus spreads. Fuck that, we're again. NY’s peak definitely horrible, also lockdown help stem tide, doesn’t look like FL right now.

Even we’re much better job protecting vulnerable now, get sufficient level spread virus, won’t able effectively isolate high-risk individuals. Let motherfucker burn... :D

Most sanitizer around 70%, stuff burn... depends live. I’m located Chicago, beginning enter next phase reopening. Ah, thinking along lines Italy everything grocery stores closed. 
I feel worst workers small business owner/operators mess. rock hard place. Can't stay home income expenses continue, can't work without risking lives families. Regardless, fuck big businesses making people work needlessly without protection. 65%? Would even help nearly 1/3 people purposely listen political reasons? going give even money corporations stocks go Oh please elaborate. good. /r/vintageCOVID Yes, lockdown needed get cases low enough level could contain sick contact tracing. Also, use time build testing contact tracing infrastructure. locked harshly enough, community spread basically died. China worked. Wuhan China getting back normal. Hell tested WHOLE 10 million person city like week find remaining cases. nothing, kick shit road total half ass lock down. stomach US tell people stop whiny bitches stay inside meet people. government programs freeze economy mitigate disasterous effects shut economy. didn't. AA quote of: ""Half measures avail us nothing"" really feel like applies here. can't half measures. mean shit. ICUs intended used typically run 80% capacity. You’re going percentage number. capacity typically taken scheduled surgeries, seems case here, stated article. worse comes worse, reschedule surgeries ease overall load ICU. love avocado toast.

from mars. reason worry, take care yourself, rest, drink plenty water, eat healthy, would cold. Watch symptoms get worse, maybe get tested available. lots things make feel way, vast majority nothing worry about. Mask wearing like condom wearing.

You wear condom want put baby inside somebody. wear mask dont wanna put deadly contagion inside somebody.

 Everybody knows condoms help prevent unwanted pregnancies. Anybody brain see mask wearing help prevent virus spread.

 Yet plenty people still go around raw-dogging shocked find they've got child support due. reason think treat masks way?

Ironically, people think condoms given teens encourages sex, dont want kids educated reproduction ones think God save people 'rona ignore science.

I'm *soooo* surprised ~125 days Election Day America, cases 50% 2 weeks prior 620 death low. average 930 deaths per day adds another +116,000 deaths total 240,000 dead Election Day. 

I wonder it'll take America get serious containing virus. then, least Florida, passing buck continued local governments. Didn’t get ass beat neighbor dispute yard? OPs wording, mine. literally already one challenging black white classification. seem remember reading accounts doctors nurses early less sick people became sick quickly. 

The article also said something people admitted preexisting conditions. giving lot people false sense security. Yeah see think way see wedding bigger event pandemic. lot innocent people trust science adhering guidelines impacted this. deserve this.  Yeah, can't see lot public support lockdown. everybody wants pretend responsible, say support lockdowns cases spike, push comes shove people going different opinions constitutes spike trigger lockdown. 

counts across US spiking right now, see lot call returning lockdowns. find somewhat misleading. reading article says 97% capacity, covid cases make 27%. sad hear many people getting sick, article makes sound like majority ICU Covid cases that's truth. concerts, gigs, galleries, food exploration, wine tasting, classes

You can't home. China, country locked doctors whistleblowers speaking whilst tried cover pandemic lmfao? water treatment run local government? private company government funded mechanism? private altogether?  scariest catching ""between lines"" messaging sometimes heard experts talk dire warnings. stuff said scariest  NY, NJ, New England good job declining numbers while. 

It's shocking states follow done worked. got paid twice amount money made going work staying home. life time goal never leave house. never want quarantine end. going WorldoMeter reporting. reset around 9PM EST main tenets political platform creationism climate change denial, end up. Read article. She’s saying actual surge lower, she’s saying cases saw working places nurse less severe. It’s anecdotal sure, also makes sense. know lot COVID April. Hopefully helps treatment outcomes. 65% Americans stupid af survey accurate. Doubt tho, probably asked bunch kids. people didn’t want it. made comment weeks ago got slammed Reddit saying masks mandatory. crowd say, ""They must weak immune systems. family always strong immune systems. We're fine."" Officially, Houston 'area' 2000 beds still available 173 ICU beds.  guess try find them? Maybe 2000 accepting Covid local hospital North Dallas 13 beds (non-ICU) set aside Covid positives full. period time thought looking good, northeast seemed leading way places spiking false optimism Lol say refugee. Herd immunity starts 250 million cases US. got long way go. Also, immunity wears 3 6 months... so... yea. new normal. Common cold coronavirus. Immunity last, we've adapted suppressed many generations living together. Yeah, seen girlfriend since August. gonna visit Jan, got delayed April, cancelled, there's end sight. Houston one biggest biggest hub medical care. scary. couple days weekend (when reported cases typically lower because...weekend) enough call downward trend? Okay then. healthiest state.

And that's safety protocols exist, people can't always trusted make safest decision. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Prez taking denial route. probably lung damage. COVID appearing disease lining blood vessels. Damage organs occur. would access vast outdoors single family camping harmful thing? advocated since day 1 pandemic everyone wear **face mask** public especially travelers entering US early days (just like East Asian communities ubiquitously do). It’s really **common sense** responsibility protect neighbors getting infected. Yet, 3 months virus ravaging across **United States**, trump still **refused sign national mandate** everyone wear face mask public premises.  Hypocrisy seeing aren’t Sweden LOL  Good. don’t deserve visit. combination things, expected. Italy locked first foremost, population took seriously. know higher trust government institutions, really case US areas saw initial outbreaks people really kinda 'freaked out', lack better term. Washington State took seriously, New York metropolitan area well. areas north east corridor seen similar, though concentrated done similar. hit close home areas Italy, population took seriously.

Next got adherence medical advice, including social distancing, hand-washing mask usage. Social distancing especially seems less adhered to, likely due combination initial distrust conflicting information CDC / federal government economic realities people simply safety net protect working. 
 
Finally think geography freedom mobility. area majorly effected Italy size Florida control, close borders lock seem able contain it. US vast administrative complexities, competing ideologies governments, internal borders easily closed. virus difficult contain travel brings new population center spread even return originated, starting things again.

We talked lot early SE Asian countries success containment, mask culture great contact tracing without doubt determining factor, many island peninsula nations. Singapore 2 3 roads airports. South Korea DMZ, one militarized borders world. Taiwan small island nation limited airports. We're seeing similar things New Zealand benefiting easily enacted isolation. I'm sure we'll see similarly US Alaska, Hawaii probably Puerto Rico benefiting isolation rest world. 
 
tl;dr: adherence trust medical guidelines social distancing mask use, ease success self-imposed geographic isolation tobacco covid? Jesus people's vaccine. incredible 21st century many people know nothing health. Pakistan? right home, family, politicians right usa. never really considered danger conspiracy theorists family now. aliens, fake 911 attacks, illuminati etc, plain awkward embarrassing, I'm completely sick stomach can't even look family members anymore let alone listen another word them, much less president. One hospitals work started keeping surgical masks one room told use one per day. totally unsafe hospital personnel wear ONE mask per day given remove put back several times per day. unsafe. people place exists america. bet lot never ocean much less outside u.s. I'm sorry hear :( hope well bud Please keep bald daughter safe trying times Nothing really announced yet. borders closed except NZ residents citizens currently. talk opening Australia create trans Tasman bubble nothing announced. I'm guessing borders still closed months yet. something need focus America ASAP: **HERD IMMUNITY**. exposed TON people initially virus made way population like seasonal flu. Italians touching/hugging time got hit hard first wave.

I'm personally advocating even wearing masks, quicker people exposed virus play entire population better long run anti-bodies. take responsibility, course government one that.... would “We done best tackle virus reality it’s brought nation knees,” Redfield told House energy commerce probably going spend $7tn one little virus,” said US “used capacity have” confront pandemic “the critics there”. really shame way. I'm looking go Europe soon, living Thailand much trying get back soon possible.

For reference, Bangkok mid January. EVERYONE wearing mask... Well, everyone tourists is. long layover Taiwan, thing true there. Understandably lot general air pollution, MASSIVE uptick virus. Near full compliance even government restrictions.

I get back states, SEATTLE. one taking seriously. Mass misinformation, half hearted quarantine, political name calling, lack cohesion, 50 cent army driving even opposing directions, yadda yadda yadda.

Now, game ""maybe Sri Lanka sounds nice."" Shrugs shoulders\*

And want come complaining. got hit waaaaaaaay less hard people financially, parents remote ranch love at, fight safety family race due color skin. much understand lucky am.

More so, I'm upset people missing out. low income businesses dependent tourism. Juniors/Seniors college get find Europe - chasing olive skinned fling damn good olives. buddy Sak recently slipped disk sleep firm mattress concrete slab.

Ok, last one travel restrictions, could buy softer bedding, least walk exercises make sure he's eating usual Mama's Chang... C'mon Sak.

...

Types ""Thailand travel"" Google news umpteenth time\* tell stock market mean, pretty dubious individual... Looks like reopening going well  site? WOM 863 67 Delaware (which far back April include probable). economy stomps EU powers combined. economic powerhouse comes close China.

10% higher isnt quite ""stomping"" true short term, mostly equalises time. large population longer term true within reasonable error range. people resign allow law tangle up. American public comprehended rogue ness experiencing.. fuck wrong you? doesn’t even live represent Orange County! lives/represents Lake County! understand getting at. addressing vitamin deficiency. expect blacks UK dying greater rate share population US primary cause, expect average greater rate vitamin deficiency given UK gets less sun US (and especially given larger fraction US south even sunnier).

You'd also expect trend (to probably lesser degree) Asians, happening.

So, vitamin deficiency alone inadequate explaination. hope second. actually genuine question. also answered tweet. lump USA Russia Brazil led 2 tyrants! fitting.  news. Water wet second wave new hoax.  guess covid prophylactic super drugs work. ask refund NY hotbed NYC health department encouraging people go go eat Chinatown avoid xenophobia even Black Mirror could predict  refuse understand health crisis tied economic crisis. don’t solve one without other. Unfortunately, it’s state’s decision federal government. certain people (elderly, disabled) vote mail certain situations absentee ballot (eg, students, traveling overseas). vast majority people states cannot vote mail. sarcasm? Well, acceptance go *before* announcement? US Brasil banned 2020 abismal response. 

Rest world likely resume normal activities July able adhere social distancing rules wear masks. free? APH tests email address physical address (not even proof address, address). Entirely free questions asked. 

Looks like CVS requires proof insurance, SSN/proof address lieu insurance. also free. Seems like lot hoops jump through. medical doctors success disinfectants light? Maybe leaches bleeding patient. Well seem pretty sure! *you* know even *one* unnecessary shutdown? R/Covid gone wild Munich seems like likely candidate them. rent already high enough here... feel Good luck. bets even convince family change let alone hick Joe road.  It’s funny top posts r/coronavirus Texas Florida, none want talk California leading pack....weird. wonder  honest, thought CDC career civil servants US, plus millions medical professionals, would grab emergency horns put great fight.

Then... second week Feb., like ""what!? USA still tested literally 400 people?!?!"" 

and downhill since then. knew matter time... Coronavirus doesn’t generally confer lifetime immunity.

Look dealt Polio. actually did. single hospital group amid metro area still plenty capacity, rest lower impact concentrating COVID patients small set hospitals possible.

The nature exponential growth means still extremely concerning, dire seems headline.  allow fly over. would stop lot Americans coming in. sobering reminder transmissible COVID 19 is. comparison flu reproductive rate 1 meaning average transmitted one person one person. 12 20 people party infected one person. Delaware added 67 fatalities (including probable) far back April. Yes, that’s bullshit people trot justify love Confederate flag. It’s utter nonsense. rebelling really great (I know occasionally warranted, like slave rebellions various Caribbean islands)? Oftentimes it’s downright idiotic, rebels usually lose. People diabetes heart condition mess within 3-4 days infection. may want drive hospital, examined given prescription. want wait 5 days get results back, getting meds. Well, *is* pretty much last December, since 3 us caught cold. 🤷🏽‍♀️ That’s I’m talking . I’m also thick haired curly-headed dude. Got girl payroll buzz cuts 😂 markets Morocco, apparently get better deals think rich American. Canadian university student go to. Yeah... yesterday. Today another 3200+. Damn good point right here. Yeah, would spend like$1000 per day family risk getting killer virus also risking lives others? Theme parks go like mass gathering. There's way safely. hope petition works. Great point don’t see made believe anything people say face value. Everyone wants excuse go outside others agree. peaceful protesters gassed photo opp. prefer dictatorship. would apply everywhere since cant block US world rest even. 

If theres vaccine, real possibility, whole world would go infection. ‘I’ve done death toll America president.’ Oh u know... well we're kinda short those.... great economy everybody money... science reminded us natures control.. us humans God complex issue.. invalid reality. 

Long story short. US ill prepared actual pandemic. planned politically powerful ad rich make it.. lol Hi I'm twelve understand implications employment systemic level. really expect learn Northeast could learned China first, learned Italy?

Something tells learn. Good Hawaii.  It’s bummer, though, us small window next phase life planned travel experience world. part life least kids lives don’t allow anymore. 

I agree you’re saying entitled middle aged women, it’s disappointing young person too. afforded others virus. Fuck corona virus. hear ya man, ticked too. daughter born bald, really young. seem problems English language, sane mind would see statement defence Nazis. Maybe Nazi bias made look stupid.

Or maybe ignorant clue Dritte Reich still laws murder. Nazis broke rules knew. That's tried hide Holocaust even population. Predicted who? vaccine going go testing. People need getting vaccine work sicken kill them. several labs trying come vaccine. None yet. God snowflake baby response serious topic. Illinois here. We've *remarkably* well decreasing cases, spread word Chicago's closed, Bean hates selfies, ate pizza stay away, thanks. Yall never really got peak, I'm convinced places got peak better long run. Sweden may come saying many died, doubt see big second wave realize money doesn’t actually grow trees right? know it’s possible run out? know taxpayers burden paying back right? guess fucking not. people would rather die risk small chance dying rather losing everything well able provide people depend selfish idiot. fact think printing endless money solution baffling. Even California I’m already ran ask Federal government money. Use little brain. privileged sound.  see someone opened another door Apocalypse Advent Calendar. lol think wet markets something that's new China? hospitality industry complaining about, though, even toothless quarantine causes vacationers re-think travel plans.

The pandemic enough lmao people dumb don’t car, knowledge aren’t testing sites drive through? That's problem things grow compounding rate weeks lag time. Hopefully surge capacity actually exists reality paper, plan, chart. Heh, figured. hard know sure people's internet. Jesus fucking christ. need shutdown again. thought already widely known accepted. someone sick course they're going contaminate surroundings even asymptomatic still carry bodies therefore still shedding known?! Conjures quite image either way emphasize it... OMG 10 EXTRA DEATHS PER 100000 PEOPLE GOOD THING LOCKED WHOLE COUNTRY RUINED HUNDREDS THOUSANDS LIVELIHOODS EMOTIONAL WELLBEINGS GOOD JOB happens rely federal government, NY governor took matters hands, stockpiles tests, ppe, hospital capacity round 2. gave states head start, apparent heed warning diagnosed social disorder? Cuomo manufactured strawman could call “ preposterous"", ""anti-American"" ""declaration war"" ?  news, 2+2=4 administered US Historically, areas bathroom 1918 pandemic seriously recovered faster economically.

Turns people dying, people grieving, scared people? Bad economy. 

We absorbed scared people bad econony failed account two, trying pretend normal. joke practical wait there's zero percent chance kids get virus school. absurb wait long eventually need accept risk start going back school. wait little longer, take lot precautions, school start back up.  funny I've heard older co-workers trendy thing 70s 80s? we'd kept it. Texas deserves it. saw one girl get elders boyfriends family together Father's day like actually something cool. shes nurse 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ wow, deep insight. know 6yo could deduce historic numbers Good point, thanks that. arguing all, wanted clarify $2,000 everyone else see. Ha live 20min away munich, less suburb. Mostly sure saw life plane.

If come send dm share suggestions Tourist filled interesting places. example 

Until stay safe really hope stay also happy/positive 🙂 important saving lives?

1) believe lockdown save life, reason support lockdown.

2) believe lockdown create deaths, reason lockdown.

3) care many dies fallout lockdown per SBIII post above. children die due malnutrition famines yours, lives somewhere important you. lockdown chance increasing odds grandmother grandfather survive *if* happen get infected, death handfull anonymous children okey.

Which one you?

I guess people third group, virus personal, could someone know. selfish option nothing trying save many life possible.

When would surprised lives lost due lockdown order magnitude higher life lost COVID. Oh okay apologies I'm sorry. saw link marked NSFW. watched 30 seconds, watch more. Take care internet friend! I'm anxious see plays out. Trumpets know see think he's winning again. want see fallout. Also originally NJ, bit jealous right I'm NM state taking seriously surrounded morons  Wholeheartedly support this. Americans hell-bent getting infected, let's wait bit they're dead imune.

I'm sorry, know that's cold hearted, we've made many sacrifices let go hell now. Florida wasn’t massive disaster month ago. curiosity, 1st wave Texas severe? LOL... nice try, clearly 22  25 maj–söndag 31 maj 2020**

What date say started again? Oh, that's right May facts correct that.

I do, thanks... perhaps correct *your* comments remove glaring errors.

EDIT: Wait... saying compared different days due week numbering system?

That's even deceptive. Eastern coast Virginian here. path control. stagnated steady level across state, due Northern VA decreasing (later phase entrance) areas like Hampton Roads increasing, balancing cases robust 500ish days now. Meanwhile, masks 'mandated' yet less less people wearing them.

We move phase 3 July 1st. Yeah! People look bright side 123,000 Americans dead, ICUs capacity Texas, Arizona, California, [life-long health beginning understand! NYC biggest protest crowds country (I've crowds well 10k people here), every day nearly month now, numbers continue drop. really starting look like outdoors+mask practically prevents transmission entirely. even close sadly. virus triggered diabetes herd mean us dumb dumbs businesses curbside delivery. Gyms instance. really know solution something. Better unit taking damage, tenants using utilities aren’t paying.

The rent offer inclusive, utilities provided. afford units sit empty, utility usage unpaying tenants.

I’ve got two evictions lined ready go next month miss rent, fully expect will. Unfortunately people afraid already taking necessary individual steps. people seem concerned pandemic keep going public without masks social distancing force another round shutdowns. Wow. Crazy. Sorry hear you’ve go through.

Because I’m getting frustrated people’s “it’s problem” attitude, since ran across many posters reddit share concerns, created sub people taking “staying home” seriously. 
Would mind taking visit, sharing whatever insight may feel would helpful us? could also copy&amp;paste replied - helpful me. would appreciate it. Thank federal government hand waved pandemic individual governors states.

That's exactly point. That's find horrifying.

This issue addressed individual states lose alliances small groups states. consistent nationwide approach start.  haven’t trying make vaccine coronavirus decades. SARS died MERS infect enough people development continue. extra $600/wk ends July 31 Thank you!!

EDIT: TMC (i.e. Houston), correct? OP comment implied numbers state. Obviously OP, idea might found info? mention Cuomo held press conference every day 100+ days keep New York residents informed, calm, safe.

As Houstonian, we're lucky Turner Hildalgo forefront, Abbott continues fuck everyone over. could probably count one hand many times he's held press conference implement proactive changes compared counterparts.  best conjecture topic immunity period 4 months year. Yeah kidding ... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* major texas cities % vacancy now, numbers trending way Houston. Statewide, hospitalizations increasing dramatically, trend holds urban centers Texas, even quite severe. 

As Texan- yikes.  Fair enough. Oklahoma near 500 cases past 24 hours population 3.5 million. OKC Mayor said concerned death rate goes look moving back phase one reopening. doomed. ok thought may happened lol. What's petty nationwide strategy states rise fall without consistent approach. $

It's always money. reopen soon? money. people charge health experts recommending? Money. system broken? Money. working home last 4 months successfully reason bosses want us get back office week 7/6. One coworkers tested positive recently. also found yesterday uncle cousin hospitalized tested positive. I’m Los Angeles. sure we’d rush go back spikes we’ve working fine remotely.

Edit: want stagger staff 50% capacity office alternate days. We’re small open office space 25 people total. Idk. Still seems risky me. stop testing problem go away Hmm, MAGA hat wearing rednecks. Sorry, right. 75% Americans want trump. 
Notice, want mean vote for. still vote someone want. Also, contact tracing outbreaks linked protests yet. far, restaurant (undisclosed, working them), party, military base IIRC Houston 4th populated city United States. think safe say no, neighboring cities cannot handle surge. Looking balance sheet, I'm sure there's another option People neighboring cities commute Houston doubt they’re better shape. Fauci testify yesterday re: asked diminish testing? odd /s Thank you. hope keep spreading word. understand hard convince Americans good thing protect person next them. business handle open pandemic, can't work home, still profitable? look community see restaurants, movie theaters, simply can't generate revenue needed half capacity social distancing rules. 

The problem surviving short term.  agree.  However long term doubt many businesses survive let drag on.  We're even first wave.  Locally we're relatively lucky since cases mostly concentrated Latino families adapting crisis propose business deals hardest hit demographics frequenting establishment?

We've become short sighted society fights limited resources.  need long term goals resources available get us there. guys sitting pretty November South still reeling pandemic, yall get Umm lots people. People aren’t soulless. Came scorpion bowl got low-rent alcoholism. :( today? also applies brexit emotionally drained shouting people incoming disaster

But hey, good news yanks, sell us dirty chicken $$$ don’t starve death. get food poisoning sell us drugs even $$$ Lol. Keep disgusted. could care less. like can't win. They're responding critique black community mask wearing disproportionately affected others white privilege likes ther- one example POC twitter said feel uncomfortable wearing face masks due systemic racism, feeling unsafe heightened profiling. people stated lives would risk black individual forced wear mask. Petitions started 

This exception place. Also exemption place examples like disabled. effort inclusionary catering loons depending see it. 

I think insane given pandemic affects everyone let's pretend voices black community campaigning . Nobody forcing anyone wear wear masks. They're simply giving vocal groups saying unfair race exemption would already 100% open coherent science based federal response. get elect unqualified dumbass. Reap sow. Would like nation-wide consistent national strategy instead? surprised already (or suspending re-opening?)

My province suspended elective surgeries back March 18 (resulting postponing 3,500 - 4,000 surgeries per week). one surgery (scheduled end May) cancelled time ""indefinitely"". However, based capacity numbers started staged re-opening early May first stage including regular outpatient/day surgeries, started moving non-urgent inpatient surgeries well (I know someone got hip replacement earlier week). still running reduced surgical volume though watching numbers importantly, hospitalizations ICU bed use, determine need scale back point. scheduled go couple weeks, hoping people stop idiots around like see - currently trying avoid everyone avoid postpone surgery again. wary company Civicscience. engage traditional survey based polling, rather, Internet-based. See Wikipedia greater detail. looked comment seems CDC talking situation population low number actual infections, case small number false positives could account half positive results. doesn’t mean tests always crime pays close eyes imagine gone

Reality relative anyways lol  Looks like winning. would disagree assessment nothing changing.
 
We agree recommendations health experts changed much, all. events preceding 4 5 weeks certainly brought change movement behavior people. saying while, ""reopening"" anything except stop payment bunch welfare never wanted hand first place. Expect run honey buns  matter many stories someone reads, end take action directly affects them. Please do. american, terrifying shameful US handled response covid. fear life lives loved ones. wouldnt want endanger anyone else shortcomings leaders country. high US unemployment numbers again? Corona dollars good money anyway. 
:) admission virus cure running free hospitals? enough shut hospital  Japan. non-Japanese American permanent resident, example, can't come in. non-citizen Japanese ancestry permanent resident, come in. Racist af. Though also one highest rates volunteerism. NH people constantly volunteered time things community. [A I'm sure use somewhere. surprised hope airlines got keep tickets money.... thats probably happening aint it? passengers tested positive previously Pakistan. persons probably travel together, sat different rows. Pakistan low test numbers compared population. could indicate high number unreported cases Pakistan.  Yeah tiny. Population lower California. Also European countries unite stepped on. Luckily Canada live next economic Gargantua US. Military subsidies take care attic. complain alot one ever listens lmao completely irrelevant nation. Guy work, day today nonsense “fake numbers, anyone dying covid”.... Ah gotcha, allowed municipalities create laws mandated mask use, illegal before.

But yeah, Arizona clusterfuck. Houstonian, im fucking pissed Gov. Abbott treated entire thing state.

Our curve never decreased, flat apparently cause enough resume business fucking usual. pace worst affected city country.

People stupid scares shit sure agree (having lived PHX 7 years) definite ""flu season"" got colder November Feb/march-ish... scientific numbers this, anecdotally pretty clearly counter ""flu-trend"" area, would appear ""warmer weather"" theory kinda shot (also see every southern state hitting new highs) referencing something? ""Those rookie numbers."" - USA, probably  Yes, difference. Sweden politicians listened scientists appointed handle pandemics. national science based leadership. wish someone would step neighbor said sister dying go would soon opened back up. People idiots man. Oh see, that's kinda funny. must read first comment said actually blame... deny hes free blame whatsoever state also isnt true. goes governors states. curve-flattening thing. hospital systems get swamped. know whether guy wanted make special testkits personally think CDC botched testkits brought US knees. Unfortunately US history anti-intellectualism. really taken medical side recently Good. Turnabout fair play. USA: rookie numbers. number goes ICUs packed capacity can't treat people. course deal absolutes. Sith. magically work aren’t racist Trump isn’t involved! think mainly, Americans, truly witnessed horror death wide scale. like teenagers. Feeling invulnerable.  We’re even scared Covid-19. pretty scared. terrified concerned. Concerned enough take precautions. don’t we’re scared. That’s play immature mind. unfortunately, we’re witnessing story predictable, beyond ability change it. 

The graph tells crystal ball prediction. Spiking cases today means deaths two weeks month. little little, corpse corpse, come around taking seriously give respect deserves. humble us. Remove bravado arrogance currently display. Start wearing mask nose. Worldometers testing  dead it. civil unrest resulting mass unemployed receiving benefits. people may even place shelter rate. free find better country.

Throw dart map. Try avoid Somalia. go. Mass gatherings seems popular moment USA. fuck, get hangnail gotta take nap respect Roger’s decision wish well. disaster I'm self quarentining, let go Tomorrowland 2021!! noticed nobody entire post mentioned little gathering Houston. largest ever occurred, yeah get real mad suggest best way advocate cause swear used drum bit. Oh wow, real life fence sitter. never said they’re virus. said accusation alarmism aren’t damning light fact SARS 2. live around Houston, times go out, maybe 1 5 people wear masks. Genuinely disappointed. Scandinavians huge egos. don’t take criticism well. experienced first-hand living Scandinavia. People like don‘t travel anyway. selfhate? Look lot protesters right now. Typical mindergarten response.
„you can‘t that“, „i didn‘t want anyway“ If* ?!? bunch fucking morons. seem still acceptable people office right full control lives?!? I'm trying start fucking argument. genuinely want know!! I'm 34 divorced father 1 got fired 10 year salary paying job Houston. Acceptable??!! Selfishness entitlement. They’re ‘too healthy’ wear mask. weird find warm feeling kind comforting? Kinda like blanket face... wonder nephew sleep without blanket head... bad back nothing's changed.  cure, treatment.  Neither Lightbulbs, bleach, hydroxychloroquine, prayer effective treatments even slowed virus.  masks, distancing work everyone given things .  worst case us upon us again. kind haircut takes 15minutes?! Sorry you’re downvoted, second part correct, least. hospitals social media policies bar video patient care areas. Whoever posts risks fired... argument course action best stopping spread virus worst economy? shit. nothing said. I'm referring large group people refuse wear masks social distance demand everything opened back save economy. took actions reduce new cases like people almost every country seeing record cases every single day countries effectively eliminated new cases. fair seatbelts protect YOU, others. Wear mask protect least. NH here.

Get red plated brethren Laconia, please. right time 2 weeks Floyd's protest ! predicted mass gatherings would increase spike Uh, what? original guy wrote two absolutely asinine sentences, little relation other, excepting absolutism.

First, 330 million Americans, least 2 Americans value community individualism. Therefore, indeed situations Americans value community individualism. fact, many communities America! WOW

Second, 44 countries Europe taken measures federal, state, local governments taken US. US failed dramatically many ways, US lot learn Europe implement things learning Europe, Vice Versa.

Basically, America one big ABSOLUTE unity everyone thinks acts way, we're angry other. OP like 130 upvotes dumb fucking comment guy called -4. 

Idk even wrote out. certainly would tail end virus matter what. vaccine, amount social distancing would gotten us acceptable level. certainly could better is, near end. local protests also largely showing people wearing masks. shown keep virus rate down. doubt protests If* bunch fucking morons. seem still acceptable people office right full control lives?!? I'm trying start fucking argument. genuinely want know!! I'm 34 divorced father 1 got fired 10 year salary paying job Houston. Acceptable??!! think Abbott give order. He's already taken drastically different tone started giving press briefings. Jesus Christ hate living US  envy Fauci. put Trump's BS say right things placate able semblance able job right. Man must patience saint.  Weird... Florida’s Secretary State public record could look “Business Name LLC” Secretary State business search site verify ownership?? literally takes maybe 30 seconds literally anyone google company US Silicon Valley interesting case everyone super cautious (in contrast rest US) one plans work office rest 2020. result, housing prices falling SF Palo Alto, rising outskirts. People planning close enough office come needed, willing pay premium prices commute daily.


Anyway, would surprised tech relocates different hub instead becoming disperse. Unless coronavirus eradicated Europe, see happening vaccine comes out, can't risk big meetings without backtracking progress that's made. still good news workers outside Silicon Valley work remotely, see tech centralizing another city result this. (But knows, could wrong.) problem hospitals overrun choice:
At first let virus spread deny it.
Then let hospitals overrun, nothing. 
Then left start telling people go home die die.
All point censor news, even comes point everyone know someone died hospitals rejected. 
At point panic people sort shit refusing leave home go work running states helping spread virus showing hospital semi automatic rifle pretending cured however would still point understand headline title?

being asymptomatic means sick actually showing normal signs sick fact feel ""normal"" still SICK therefore still get symptomatic people get side effect... THATS LOGIC  You’d think someone running president months would want virus controlled possible. wondering won’t places test travelers land let quarantine test results come back? Italian, obviously glad country got better. Congratulations even Spain France. talked much here, managed keep virus control. Uh oh. friend mine studying New Zealand. school closed classes online, came back home US save rent. hope get back New Zealand. Two weeks, zero, like miracle. Believe me. [A I'm sure use somewhere. like watching Jonestown massacre real time, involving hundreds thousands dead people.   know she’s gotta get work man would scared shitless closeup work. Introduce yourself...stranger more! wee bit exaggeration Sweden nothing one giant ego. think wrong. J/k!!1 Ahh, peak American idealism one post. Ok let rephrase that...


We're better Michigan big cities taking seriously. 

Now could convince everyone home town that's there's hidden agenda REAL we'll golden. press blasted Trump asking slow test rates fact Fauci says fake news ? conspiracy theorist, probably information slow come out. tend believe although ""man created"", virus probably incubated lab. got out, everyone rushed cover like said, penalty fucking like China death. This. 

If think much, that’s probably enough. 

My perspective ER PA: Same. first wasn’t usually drinking getting drunk, would quite bit beer throughout day, every day. Like one lunch, one work, couple end night. I’m focusing health, losing weight, limiting two big crappy light beers Wednesday nights. thank you! saving comment. looked it. news saying reached surge capacity yet.

""As Sunday, 82% current inpatient beds 84% ICU beds use COVID-19 patients. "" Jamaica
Wtf even that. find ""Islam=terrorist"" mentality many Americans stupid. Like Christianity fucking weird tiny 35 million country rich...
Just Europe guess. 

Why braindead people like allowed vote. cases go states reopened? thats already happening states, ones gonna bet that.

Good, least going blame NYS Cuomo. Phoenix/Scottsdael: testing people mayo clinic orders (?)

this based linked website, says:
""ScottsDale: MAyo Clinic Patients written order Mayo Clinic correcting false part commen

are really, though? :)  

""no symptom, test"" common requirement test. even agree link provided....  know arguing :) believed them? Shame you. Canadian here. I'm building wall. Let's see Yanks like it. They're bringing best, all!

(Just kidding, love Americans. Well, them.) can’t go can’t go French say C'est la vie. Oh man 90 Day Fiance??? Prove thought May maybe things winding down, getting scared again, things going look like April, even WORSE now, New York City Seattle anymore, multiple cities across many southern states. getting Contagion movie terrtory now. kind twisted concept world people turn work they'll get shot ? still living 1900s people slaves ? America leader military resources. literally lead world nothing else matters. Maybe oil production? fair, think gen X folks also dealt shit also lacked opportunities parents had..i think post-boomer Americans pretty fucked. Gen Z may fucked all, though wut? There's evidence undercount. someone dies, they're gonna find right then. need find cause death. anything deaths overcounted. median age death 82, there's many thinks people could die corona. think death rate 0.26% reguardless think CDC got right half total deaths attributed four states strictest lockdown measures (New York, California, New Jersey, Illinois). Understandably, population density plays major factor. said, cases, could've done? Mostly remote learning parents take children homeschool. one sis! can't cure stupidity. Including cost living. family moved Massachusetts, God, find housing costs needless taxes insane. 

Seriously, excise tax cars seems like great way incentivize people buy property New Hampshire Maine register vehicles address. Look Seoul compare NYC.

Asian countries like South Korea already experience handle pandemics swine flue 2009 first SARS pandemic 2002-2004. compare NYS bit unfair, mention CDC warned east coast states virus actually came Europe China. Check flu deaths. I'm snarky read flu preferred cause death likely COVID deaths. follow it, worth looking curious enough. shithole country. yet people still leave lids up. good them... I'm sure States would like close borders backwards States can't unconstitutional Sorry dude u dont deserve :( good points, especially taking measures home. know includes, think following: opening windows, cleaning regularly touched surfaces often (door handles, taps, counters), limiting contact unwell household members even isolating home, wearing mask unwell space another person. 

That's really interesting Sweden! Anecdotally, noticed COVID patients looking generally sharing homes least 2 adults. interesting see data side this.  Personally feel sympathy working bothered masks. still think wear them. really, fuck entitled bitches want unnecessary services wearing mask. even mask wearing individuals keep making numerous unnecessary purchases, therefore voting dollar. Telling businesses profitable stay open force workers showing governors opening acceptable. that’s US lost probably international headquarters. Thanks, “re-open economy” BLM protestors....hope enjoy layoffs. Move. ""Not allowed wear masks!?"" hope first person catch COVID lawyers up. Hmmm. thing happens piss shit particles toilets. Nothing special H-1B slots allocated 2020 actually filled April part ban affect anything year. Mis information it’s news look symbol tyranny sign burst laughing 😅😅😅 Bravo! Let's rid covid together. Unity division. Let's go! believe said ""Dont go unless need go out.""

It's pivot exactly strong language. need go detox go crazy? I'd hesitate use word ""hardcore"" 

Either iron makes wonder drank 16 years begin with. Well he's going hell letting people die evens out. I'm Texas, realize paralyzed. Even going yesterday's total deaths, top 18 states, 6 Northeast (this excludes Delaware updated figures include past deaths made #1 day). Even wanted make arguement states keeping pace due population sizes, go 29th largest state (Connecticut) find 6 Northeast list. ""first wave"" saw couple months ago that's keeping lot states top still, population sizes. taken lot long fall top spots new cases (so recently new deaths started reflecting yet), can't see deserve praise. can't believe argue idiots masks...In June. pandemic 120k dead way 200k. lot people willing pack events general shit direct conflict scientific data, compensates lack population density assume. argument complex greedy sociopaths.

If it’s inconvenience don’t care. starting get scared cities going look like July. could seeing Multiple April New York Cities then. thanks death wishes guys

Holy strawman. confirm. happened somebody know. idea became Kim Possible see one single benefit it. Power Bottoms Trump outlet store. Hahahahaa get life bro. called opponent monkey 2016 elections expect? guys decompress Corona news overload? Netflix? Video games? Exercise? Gardening? wondering found effective get mind things bit. Could use way distract hours every night wind down. Trump rally held state lowest covid numbers recovered. Florida mostly good numbers except Miami area protests numbers went up. Oh No...



Anyway... you’re going make claim antibodies last month link reliable article otherwise don’t spread misinformation Amen, brother. visit them, make sure outside. Socially distance wear mask. That's relatively low risk. hope pulls through! I'm good right here. Kept reading comments love good cringe. Bye hun! reflex respond see word 'china' anything word bares relation it. He’s paralyzed. I’m probably going hell joke chills fever, mostly slept first 3 days. Horrible headaches. mild cough, lost taste smell. week said feeling better tired, recovered pretty quickly that. father law brother law currently lives remained well entire time, interestingly enough. Exactly. Family gatherings deathtraps.  New Brunswicker (Canada) checking in.

It's pretty well enforced here. Though granted small province easy check people. 

Upon entering give address going self isolating at, phone number, information. 

They call random intervals check you, someone (not sure person happening anymore due higher volume travellers) come check person without notice. 

A friend mine even got call 11:45pm, 15 minutes left quarantine. 

If answer be, fined (I think 100% sure though) charged quarantine act. Go back the_donald DeSATAN Right? asthma kid seemed ..go away awhile? last year came back vengeance. idea caused come back I'm thrilled it. I'd still rather annoyed mask ventilator. national parks closed = federal shutdown, said wouldnt happen lol mean? stay home order, closed schools, closed business, flattened initial curve well. ICUs never 10% capacity full Covid patients, compared New York covid patients alone accounted 100% ICU capacity. initial reopening beginning May went well really spike cases. point much recently, passed threshold activity allowed rapid spread virus. Anyone one good lockdown, wait long enough, reopen means virus won’t come back dead wrong. New York keeps opening, give two months thing stops looking like Texas small degree herd immunity got first wave. options ask everyone nothing vaccine out, causes immense amount suffering right, try gradually find middle ground. Texas long time, many people let guard True, germs shit get touching face. Speak yourself, article. 


EDIT: Also feel really bad people AA. really wonder coping this.  research it! encourage researching IMO Baker keep lockdown going, make state unappealing tourists. Like, least summer. bet universities bring money tourists anyway, make sure shit unfucked fall. I’m saying I’m going Disney, wear mask around. Honestly, doesn’t bother much. It’s certainly driving force discomfort heat humidity. feel much warmer back face. 

It’s something I’ve gradually gotten used to. Keep mind 70s March slowly steadily increased temperature. It’s one things get used to. I’m sure August you’ll able tolerate lot longer. enough trump admin rallies tulsa Another example outbreak family gathering.

Primary transmission seems family friends gatherings lot time indoors spent.

Stay fuck home. give fuck others? EVERYONE gets virus! Well simple 0.5% really function acts age obesity stats.

So country like Uganda might super low percentage. 

Places like Iceland seem hitting 0.5%, one wonders much fitter population is.

The Bronx astounding 0.32% population mortality already. actual mortality rate 0.5% would 60% already sick. antibody tests implying anything close number. fuck UN CCP infected world. wife got tested work rapid testing. 6 day backlog eventual testing rather rapid. countless countries way better did. New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, etc.

None countries share border New York.

Canada tested traced start. Trump hamstrung American response. entire outbreak went undetected middle March actually millions cases Northeast USA. ‘According article read’ - random redditor ... reddit nutshell. you’re linking peer reviewed articles reddit pure entertainment. it’s anything like hospital walled covid units help prevent spread. halls also super quiet, visitors. ER got people rooms quickly possible prevent crowding waiting room. really full busy, walking halls eerily quiet. Neck neck CT per usual. Excellent work. selfish idiot. 

__No. HONEST man.__ 

If cower fear flu-like derivative illness - lock home. That's much control EVER rest us. 

Good luck enforcing face mask idiotic rules __PUBLIC places__ less. 

Business Federal/State buildings one thing - parked outside youd notice half people taking immediately existing places. regularly observe Home Depot Stop Shop Post Office. half way necks get stupid building pull immediately after. Except crop sheep keep even driving - people hope

Again want cower fear go right ahead. enforcing face masks. cops going do? lock us jail wearing stupid masks? go around putting masks us? arent many cops many jail cells enforce nonsense mention law suits __violent__ push backs surely follow. cop friends assure arent paid enough put lives health line enforcing face masks PUBLIC places

__Whats next - Governors edith color underwear, bra types, sock color__

GTFO 

p.s: Dr Brix Covid19 task force explains numbers FUDGED. 

FREE 
YOUR 
MIND says moderate concern. guess we'll see deal weeks. Wanna bet? done throughout states Australia. It’s feasible minimal land crossings states, obviously pretty difficult US state like NY. works. Australian states free community transmission life almost back normal. WA live, Saturday almost restrictions public gatherings save large sporting matches, almost zero active cases. countries problem spend time money educating citizens, people go create value work US. US temporarily benefits workers invest resources training people immediately start producing value them.

There's certainly fine like h1b1 abuse terrible they're good enough get visa. Oh reddit think now. shiver lol. Fuck dude party's missed it. Mexico spot Covid response America. Also future Mexico unsure current party still charge Mexican government. Houston. could see Dallas, Pheonx, Miami, etc getting like also. Also military jet flyovers too, forget!!! Protests consequences.  Many companies (oxford too, think?) say September could month, everything goes right Well yeah, that's EU works Ha goes half economy That's inflection point is. live epidemic within state, mean 60% magically stops, that's start slow down.  get people can’t 70% can’t us baffling. know someone makes $500k+ year STILL lives paycheck paycheck. Save damn money you’re making it! results get google articles useless junk. think way American news media handling would that? find conflicting information, psycho op-eds next almost every day. 

That footage would helpful. much doom gloom love lead with, comes war, show caskets coming home. definitely trying keep people spreading this, that’s see range fact nonsense. They’re trying make buck. occasionally get real news through, keeps everyone watching, clicking. That's bad set choices, although read India plenty food stored, hopefully starvation issue. lump UK that, people took lockdown extremely seriously. 'fuck everyone else I'll want' attitude manifest all.

Lockdown started weakening government's messaging around became muddled confusing, people care. Sounds pretty pathetic given big talk leaders free world all. going election. Ah yes, test them. write pneumonia deaths. Easy plan.  L
- Best Regards, EU citizen Vermonter here, please stay away. rational response rural state numbers way down, tri-state people buying houses sight-unseen little escape houses. need right now. nflate many US hospitals leaders field niche specialities handling specific conditions/procedures better general, they're Even were, ratings taking things like accessibility cost i

This true, study also takes consideration success rate treating certain disease, avoidable deaths, prevention factors.

So yes, even isolated hospitals deemed particularly good something, far able offset flaws systems, accessibility one. Canada live, total lockdown since March. weekly grocery visits, one person per household. Social distancing, parks closed, retail closed, etc. It’s strict. active cases province things started lighten bit. gatherings 10 people, means children play again. Parks reopened. Retail coming back online. 

But still can’t cross provincial border freely. property another province apply go there, strict quarantine two weeks upon arrival, strict quarantine upon return home province upon arrival home. month qtine told. herd immunity requires maintaining antibody levels long time.

Evidence maintain antibodies 2-6 months (not years!) growing. Yeah, killing people burning bodies pretty effective. they're outside dumbass Yep protests bound cause second wave. Yup, literally thing yesterday. TN things increasing bad-bad yet made big ol Costco run (only store town actively requiring masks) plan spend next weeks leaving house get mail contactless CSA veggie pickup. Stay safe! also family friends globe. lived 5 countries 4 continents still speak people weekly account job. don’t see stuff media keeps droning about. lockdown harder longer almost everyone talk to. Singapore’s draconian, well, second one was. Canada’s bit strict while, seem pretty much right now.

But generally people taken seriously almost everywhere talk to. don’t see “stupid American” trope every day life. fact, state, contact tracers speak tell almost half state’s cases come one particular certain minority community won’t say don’t want promote fear community, let’s say isn’t picture picture stupid American anti-masker.

I think looking news bad, US big country, many places done good job many countries Europe, Canada, etc. never hear places news reports hotspots. furloughed doctors good news. time gone forever. isn’t like people stopped getting sick. scared get treated prevented treated hospitals shut elective surgeries. give another week 2? either corona poverty mate. Can't Americans travel say, Canada fly there? True, crimes states low, iirc also nabbed Germany know anecdotal small, one clients guardians heavily political telling friends love idea Trump running 2016. Now, said pretty much openly mocking interest voting him. She’s 60s actually telling one best things Obama young she’s tired seeing old white men power. 

It seems like, small local levels, tide turning whack job. silly think keep everybody ICU share Covid duh. That’s freedumb course. assume you’re joking. Hurricanes require mass evacuations, opposite staying inside. Entire regions road one time, sides freeway dedicated evacuation. Hospital ICU patients evacuated too, means hospital near enough needs suddenly lot open capacity. protests? People trust experts people obvious political motives. wish virus would target stupidity self-centered morons. Yeaup individuals loudest room emotionally validation feel smart without work learning things. Surely meant ""2/5""... kill mean lasting impact... cool, plenty rural hospitals open beds like Tyler Midway! ship active COVID patient 4 hours away, Greg Assbutt got figured out! hospitals overwhelmed, lockdown happen. 

No won't. even need lockdown, need mandatory masks public. Fauci said need them, pointless, he's backtracking. Everyone still thinks masks protect others wearer. fucked truth own. last forever, maybe another year so, protect whatever survive. hyperbole. studies start coming showing even asymptomatic people lung damage permanent issues everyone wailing streets, acting like surprise. test sites Dallas line cars 3 blocks long hit daily limit tests 11am.

Why set website online registration like that? stupid allowing people line get tested pandemic. I'm actually going test today accept walk ins, pre-book allow one person check area time. People moved room get tested there's waiting room. great worry getting COVID waiting line see COVID. remember people saying, oh warm weather kill virus.

Except, gets warm, many us go inside AC. virus loves cool, indoor spaces. nd quality healthcare combined. think Americans would agree average American’s access healthcare abysmal, don’t know correlated quality healthcare, someone able get it. Could elaborate?

Every time I've mentioned study, Americans argued ""yeh maybe super accessible, still GREAT"". 

I'm claiming yourself, valid argument anyway,m especially comes disbelief something giving granted without backed evidence.

Accessibility one aspect study, mortality-to-incidence ratio certain diseases another, mortality cases death occurred context hospital another etc.

This study way. introduction worth look tables, see US success treating diseases stellar.

On top consider poor coverage vaccination, huge gaps quality areas another, low performance prevention, low score conditions result death, mediocre success rate conditions more.

So, yeh one could claim ""the hospital XYZ AMAZING"", add ""if disease certain list, specific doctor happen site, belong certain income bracket, etc"", why?

The bottom line US healthcare system still ranked around 30th. fucking amazing US residents believe be, quality offset poor availability (if want focus two elements disregard others), clearly doesn't.

The sad truth sick could choose teleport anywhere treated, would pick, order, Iceland, Norway, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Australia, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, Andorra, Ireland, Japan, Austria, Canada, Belgium, New Zealand, Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, Slovenia, Singapore, UK, Greece, South Korea, Cyprus, Malta Czech Republic. East, say ""only death cure stupid"". guess that's that. husband's cousin straight-up refuses believe exists. wear mask, social distance. Another relative stage 4 cancer same, even protect small child. tell brother UK try shock believing, nope. doubling down. yes, brother actually it. developed weird rash fever cough went away. That's...incomplete. Lots places Feds absolutely could step mandatory mask wearing choosing to. Airplanes obvious I'm sure leadership. country politically polarized one side said sky blue, side would argue not. That's probably well. all, United States currently dangerous country world (although Brazil making bid distinction). stop harassing Trump little feelings getting hurt What's sad people think fucking fake. Culture never set.

It's frustrating hell ever give up.

Take break take care need remember, Goonies never say die! really going problem traveling abroad then, there? fucking kidding me. Thousands people stood shoulder shoulder worse thing could done. wait generic versions made countries come out. might take extra month two generic versions released, cause countries need ramp manufacturing production, gives extra layer vetting. Dunno. I'm fucking idiot made r/Masks4All back March. 6, 7 figure year people really seemed able figure one though. I've failed quite bit. well, can't really bothered. say pretty good attacker though, especially 19 hour old comment clearly either go profile directly scroll new minute straight get here. Don’t compare rest world Americans. Americans make everything politics. what's plan 71% non covid ICU patients get COVID patients? Kick ICU let new COVID patients die? right thing resign. placing party public safety shows unfit govern.  wrong. keep economy closed amount jobs lost would catastrophic. already seeing surge demand fostering kids people can't afford feed Trump basically said this. wants show beat coronavirus election pesky tests keep getting way good victory story. wasn’t. worry, doomed together Imagine week 4th July Walk off, Texas. couple days ago New England less new cases 4 5 FL counties. trick get sunk lol Yeah, could bit extreme. considering circumstances, predictions realized, fact markets time highs... right would really best time sell make sense, unless money invested tied livelihood significant percentage overall wealth. IMO, feel like risk piled time highs well. don’t mind I’m wrong, better safe insulated pandemic leaving well “leadership” US Federal Government. man damn times said? WEAR MASKS can't buy wrap damn shirt around mouth nose get control get back semblance normal. Personal opinion, federal government already resorted (legal) piracy states? Remember seized masks federal reserves

Intra-piracy, ahoy! economy work. Let them. Things adjust needed. there's anything positive take pandemic we've learned lakh is. Bull lmao. Yall still believe Rona hoax? Okkkk Meant joke, long answer would long first wave firstly: essentially meshing count infected normally would multiple waves one instead, numbers ridiculously high, dwarfing subsequent waves. Secondly, large number infected recovered first wave would gain form immunity, introducing certain level herd immunity community would help reduce risk contracting virus subsequent waves.

What happened 1918 highly mutable flu, gives higher potential becoming virulent time unlike corona virus, generally mutate much short period time. already addressed exact subject comment study published American Academy Advancement showed change points spreading rate affect confirmed case numbers delay two weeks (**median reporting delay D=11.4 days** plus median change-point duration 3 days)

Protests began May 28, continued highest rate first *seven day moving average* number new COVID-19 cases increased **1269** **June 11** **2408** **June 18**, 2020

The beginning protests, May 28, + 14 days = June 11, beginning week **rate** new infection **doubled**.

I wish wrong this, hate tell people horrible facts, scientist know feelings bearing truth. It’s times like make thankful live Washington. heart goes everybody Texas/Arizona/Florida, seems like guys hit real hard. Stay safe there. Yes without COVID ICUs good shape handle adding patients. COVID people heart attacks, car accidents falls nowhere go. isn’t COVID takes 100% beds, it’s takes extra beds away.

The article doesn’t explicitly say it’s referring Houston metropolitan area hospitals scaled to. I’m Hawaii trying discourage people coming mandatory 14 day quarantine person coming outer island. includes island residents visitors. people trying find, report, violators arrested abiding obligation committed came here, far least 35 people arrested violating commitment, visitors also residents. themselves? husband cuts hair, cut (I wavy hair regular stylists don’t know cut wavy curly hair area). Germany, informed later turns one staff civid. take phone number everything. there's US everyone rights go people's rights. Time estimate losses US done Trump last time, economy stopped. Nobody saying wear mask house. public around people inside buildings. tried implementing plan reduce testing bring numbers down? folks pretty high think got chance working. tries find short term course, something lasts 6 months year, could allow stay student figures work situation? Education it’s expensive US perhaps could find something also helps career wise. 

I friend who’s US issue changing visa status. makes sense: fewer tests done, fewer positive cases found. Soon enough US 0 testing 0 covid-19 cases daily. 

As Canadian, hope Americans nice pics Canada because, rate, border open awhile. Hoping Canada same.  American married Italian living Italy here: marriage entitle residency Hungary, would entitle able enter country freely reasons family/residence. don’t think issues there. United States Clown ass country Nah need test less. hospital Galveston bad infection literally send home getting overrun Covid (and stuff) patients.

I also hospital last peak, even full quarter rooms available Covid.

It's **extremely** bad, right now. People recognized yet bad round going be. Spain here. Mandatory indoor spaces apart restaurants etc. Also, mandatory outside 2m distancing possible.  step start screaming people? Cuomo flaws, got every day demanded help afraid say hard unpopular thing.   protests made cases explode. Simplest explanation guys smart join EU! see many countries leaving future. healthcare welfare system taxing everyone oblivion. doesn’t increase wealth, it’s making everyone equally poor isn’t even great.... Workplace keeps Covid cases low try hide it. hope company goes flames Great. Guess won’t visiting family first child born thanks absolute mess US response. matter time what? one people still live for, thank you. People like motivate others stay strong succumb idiocy selfishness. Y'all better surprised ""indefinitely"" ends meaning indefinitely. surprised cheering taking away freedom movement leads coming back. “One best rated Med centres world” country ranked 29th HAQ index... 🤦‍♂️ okay european countries fuck US? Got it. also feeling like lungs filled hot lead coughing break rib ain't fun even get bad enough put vent. noped read flu bro started urging people know mask kick ass flu years ago led secondary bacterial pneumonia early 40s. fun. reccomened even 'just flu' level illnesses, suffer greatly reduce chances freaking mask?

BTW smell something horrible wearing mask co2 killing else dr nurses would dropping dead surgury sterile procedures. probably bad breath. dental hygiene game invest breath mints donning mask.

If wearing mask makes clostrophobic practice wearing cloth one home minutes time abdominal breathing. gots ptsd times mask aggrivated things hang want get sick die want somebody's grandma grandpa autoimmune kid's suffering death conscience soul. feel panicky lie body/mind telling you. hang practice getting used safe place like home. Keep dreaming USA world leader anything regarding corona :)

It's country anybody looks looking good ideas. True they're also testing Britain Brazil. best tested areas cases rising rapidly. include certain US states happen politics. think time better job protecting vulnerable COVID. example, FL, hospitals nursing homes stopped accepting visitors. Yep! basically system I'm sure, slight differences terms used :) generous call people. knuckledragging Neanderthals. Thanks! (Reuters) - AstraZeneca signed tenth supply-and-manufacturing deal experimental COVID-19 vaccine Scotland-backed firm British drugmaker ramps efforts wider trials potential treatment.

Symbiosis Pharmaceutical said Wednesday agreed make supply unspecified number units vaccine, AZD1222, AstraZeneca use clinical trials. companies provide financial terms deal.

AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot last month warned company running time effectively test vaccine number cases decline Europe.


Brazil last week became first country outside UK begin human testing vaccine AstraZeneca licensed University Oxford. 3,000 people Sao Paulo Rio de Janeiro enrolled trials.

Scotland's economic development agency, Scottish Enterprise, supported establishment Symbiosis Pharmaceutical 2011 provided capital.

Part reason ineffective. draw sharpie. already get shot wearing masks, though. There’s county state specifically exempts people color mask law white people might feel intimidated masked person color harass them. Yep, Wolf done great job ironically get much credit--""do job right people know done anything all"" type situation. PA decreasing long time, even though earliest hot spots adjacent high pop density/high case # states (NY/NJ...) Trying save vulnerable society acting like toddler? dumbest statement I've read thread.... dumb ones. even know Johnny Hopkins Nah would not. vast majority people shrug disease. care. America full selfish fucks. Houston here, I've seen: 


originally: 
""We're China""

 
then 
""We're Italy""

 
now 
""We're New York""

 
pretty soon people saying 
""We're Houston"" extent, makes sense think US group nations rather monolithic nation. example, state Connecticut, Northeast corner US general, curve response like Italy's. US monolithic. big monolithic.   I'm good news science. varies alot. mayor mandated masks since beginning lifted it. metro bhm fairly compliant maybe 50-60% times. Unfortunately vast majority people especially 35+ year olds live outside metro (white flight baby!) wear masks much. 

I poked head one breweries night (quickly left). packed. shoulder shoulder outdoor seating packed. Easily 100+ young people. outside mostly wearing masks. seated. getting get drink something.

What would helped starting honest assessment households would able survive this, even self assessment, adequate temporary housing could set knew would become homeless. build field hospitals, could pulled emergency shelters. 

Money could diverted existing shelters emergency funds. states, happen. states, not. 

Inevitable homelessness could addressed facet pandemic, opening funds already allocated used purposes, hardly addressed all. 

For working adequate savings pandemic, nothing really needed change stimulus amount. vendoring funds landlords utility companies could set rather quickly households completely work savings. unemployment. 

Instead moratorium put place across board allowed expire, staggered plan could put place ended.

If showering hot water soap, need worry Coronavirus reason worry washing hands hands - Soap shampoo make Covid-19 sad. mine Friday night, haven’t heard back anyone anecdotal information hot spot us cities? I'm curious cases concentrated certain parts town, certain hospitals, etc whole city similar community spread horrible feeling masks protect yourself, people would use without kicking fuss.

But they're protect others, that's people angry.

Well aware comes across crackpot baseless conspiracy. much agree decision, boy China Russia get geopolitical reshuffle year... heard, reckless here. don’t see anything like hear Jews person. Mask wearing grocery stores, high risk activity us do, 100 percent, turn away don’t. colleague got kicked grocery store wearing mask. Let’s see Danes behave rationally. definitely solidifies seeing mom Germany year. everything power stay safe limit interactions, naught. don’t blame EU. People try shame wearing mask (probably know deep wearing one too). It’s “freedom,” it’s civic duty protect fellow citizens. Period. One might even call Governor racist. Either way, they'd right. Tbf, whilst carry similar corruption big business interests, Australia's right wing looks damn moderate US Brazil politics.

But get point, beyond politics populist/demagogic leadership. bother us is, still regime whatever Inslee says goes. state run long-term. months pass coronavirus becomes part everyday life, eventually Legislature needs say emergency powers need removed. dictator.  Except dumbass leading us. Seriously though majority US taking stuff seriously ridiculous ban travel it. Funny. boomer tell “stop corona stuff”. response - I’ll stop corona stops. US fucked. many karens going demand speak manager europe this.

Is Germany meeting? I've never Texas, I've LA shocked see parts worse so-called 3rd world country, like Skid Row, located smack dab downtown. You’re right, friend. saw bats river otters. thought bats long dead dozens around dusk woods. Yeah, would terrible stopped literally spitting everyone's face meet we're public always now. spit people refuse wear mask?  whole thing suggestion EU member states. follow it, to. Hell, even different rules Germany German states allowed enter.

And yes, Switzerland part Schengen, part EU. love Beatles! also love name! someone Texas (Houston specifically) would understand got locked state. controlling well all..... PLA considered disaster remedy force, first patrol street ensure lockdown, start rations supplies entire city people would need go food. might know this, rumors Wuhan put martial law cases spiking there, people Wuhan cheerful trust military would solve lot problems PPE distribution hospitals red cross fucked up. military went Wuhan, efficiently distributed PPE hospitals, another smaller city put martial law. 
The military helps exactly think would help, make sure contact tracing isolation possible. suppose downvoted know reply can't understand military work disater remedy like PLA time, can't understand would US military bring guns tanks "" save"" people suffered Katrina.

\^ Antifa disruption agent located. Reported law enforcement FBI. Hope works buddy I'd imagine sharing huge border country taking pandemic seriously anything it. 2 week estimate includes temporary surge capacity. 1000 ICU beds predicted filled 2 weeks give idea scale clusterfuck. infected USA. Yeah forget get tested virus. That's key solving problem. sarcasm folks. well working it. Obviously challenge work English anyways pick Norwegian easier living it.

Currently listening music tv Norwegian. would. Given exponential infection rate became obvious?

It take 2 weeks exceed capacity. good piss american's currently give shit anything themselves. ""oh no! vacation!"" 34 minutes surface constantly close contact people. Person person transmission problem surfaces.

No offense, seriously hate comments like undermines fact even lesser degree social distancing full lockdown, better position slow spread many places. getting people believe need modify behavior top beneficial climate that's real problem. It’s treated member state till end year. long ban curiosity? - SHOOK took road trip see family New England south. one gives two shits masks proper social distancing. Even family wasn’t careful have. Wild. say going happen. Inevitable take shit seriously. “The threat US minuscule” 2/18

(“I wrong that.”)

“Masks make problem worse.” way first week April

(“Sorry, lived power lines kid enjoyed eating homemade mud-and-paint-chip pies. wrong that.”)

Or just, know, taking basic ownership major screwups entire thing. know it’s much ask disagreed President twice...but doesn’t make perfect. realized possibility saving legacy distancing Trump, well already dropped ball...after thinking brown lemon taking bite it. really insanity. WTF President minions thinking? insanity one ever said perfect brink civil war. things happen massive, influential world powers. 350 million diverse individuals sometimes bump heads. We're fine, never dull moment America. would ban us too. That's fair yeah. Specific provinces good reason proud. BC less cases AB proof that; AB landlocked; there's real reason bit worse BC...

Except I'll note AB's trade travel ties pretty strongly USA, could explain small amount it. small amount; excuses go far.

Edit: got map overview province's numbers... QUEBEC WTF!?!?!? Singapore case bit outlier among others. Yes, high number cases, majority happened dorms, isolated community young healthy adults made mild cases covid. So, surprisingly enough, among 40k, 26 death schools, restaurants opened since community spread consistently single digit days like ten plus cases per day.   Europe too, comparatively. Australia/NZ pretty much Asia too. southern neighbour really letting world team here, sadly.

The importance voting not-terrible governance guess 🤷‍♂️ Honestly good them. responsible, appropriate, decision. I've lived NA whole life, hate this.  I’m pretty sure article said salon paid testing. Yep...whole point #flattenthecurve... essential employee medical field, many exempt. go different hospitals different states every week. check rules travel cancel one trip since beginning. NYC week before. US response bad many EU members. publicity stunt, guarantee it. Lewis County basically Vancouver might well ""Eastern Washington Rain""

I live here, resemble remark. American expats necessarily immigrants new country. expat someone live country origin...that may may permanently. talking China response.  odd inference make: I'm somehow rooting something. Honestly can’t blame them. Traveljohns  Part problem? getting people take virus seriously? also saying new cases younger people. takes three times many cases 30-39 range produce amount deaths 40-49 range. three times many cases 40-49 range produce number deaths 50-64 range, three times many cases 50-64 range produce number deaths 65-74 range. Note upper ranges 5 year ranges. could see even slight decrease average age would cause steep drop deaths, even case numbers go up.

And top clinical procedures continue improve outcomes. 

Cases could go lot deaths could still fall. 

Time tell. always thought international flights banned every country get hold this. Surprised done already. no... fine. virus over. We're bored we're moving on. cool. What's new week?

[/s] Boy, xenophobe. I'm 100% sure true, would nice though. think irresponsible everyone running around parroting 25% positive NYC, means folks Covid though. know that, can't say that. 

The implications immunity good, impact CFR IFR opinion. Right. mortified, along others heard % positive tested today 8.2%. COVID's spread EXPONENTIAL. VC's one bumpy ride. :( Remindme! 2 weeks feel like delayed start July exactly reason. Universal SeaWorld already open, Disney set opening date way later, probably open things keep going way. I'm expecting announcement open. Saw coming. Prove contracted pandemic level disease. conspiracy that's getting at. 
 Canada 102k cases, I'm quebec 54k cases represent less 1/3 population(a less 9 million). 5k deaths. 
  Part problem outbreaks lot seniors homes, lack staff( problem going years) spread happened quick death. reside another country U.S. passport probably documentation showing reside country. 

Source: living Italy, US That’s American way bro! Look we’re sneaking around eliminating covid lol. provide complete protection, mask still protect large droplets people coughing sneezing, better nothing. testing capacity much higher. test 1/500 population per day, tops. That's 1/500 higher March testing capacity. depends want go history Except they're saying good lose money shutting down, exact opposite situation technically. law abiding US citizen. wears mask healthcare field.... technically travel 🧐 Introducing large many groups time mostly common. Individuals person person Shared room better imo.  Laughable. saying adult kid treated like US others already really long time.

Congratulations graduating job lined up. Hope learning/speaks local language assimilates planning stay. Remember 2010 biggest news Charlie Sheen lot cocaine? suggestions EU. Italy follow make rules. I'm saying couldnt survive without America. could would can't. Canada micronation dude. attached America would completely irrelevant country. controversial current reality. Fight want go fridge nothing American shit. I'm wrong I'm asshole. Well much vacation Germany 2023. Fuck me. Idk, I've seen pretty sweet airbnbs. could argued govt actually owes one case, tbh. once, people much nicer me...helps accent northern workplace uses masks kind cya measure/panacea decides cram everybody closely together? provided masks...Can't say reckless. Texas Hospitals fucked. motion stopped. good thing enclosed spaces circulating cool air keep people heat. don’t get believe virus cleared despite cases going despite denying COVID-19 came from. can’t ways. likely tech hubs move EU countries draconian bans (and threaten them). US best moment, could play straight UK's hand brexit negotiations American girlfriend Germany ? movie Eurotrip ? need go better places. . . health food geared, organics etc. . Central Market Kitsap high percentage, Costco mandatory. . Walmart garbage masks. . . it’s excuse US, wouldn’t exactly say UK done standup job handling pandemic... yeah that's insane. probably assume real number infected much bigger good Statistics Sweden publishes report telling like is. 

It one reports started lie, exactly knights shining armour... UK here. us too. here. Yo wanna smoke Weed? already defunded WHO......

not really suprise. would happy? don’t get fucking ocean clusters Meanwhile:

Commission issued [these passengers refer airlines to. talking china hope remember china's stellar ability censor information. believe death count actual naive. 8 year old NC died COVID coupld weeks ago...... countries balance health safety economics public panic. yes, knowledge there, Asian countries like China experience pandemic pandemic like situations. Masks cause panic China already wear masks. Asian countries nearby also take news local Asian countries seriously. Localization news awareness based localization still thing despite internet. affects country reacts. likely know Canadian Mexican events/culture someone China reverse true.

So mention unknown. yes right, information there. information varying levels reliability new makes so. Science especially public statements need exact possible gamble. yes similarities SARS respiratory diseases, level reliability information regarding impact human body, reaching US spread still varying. point time, yes many non-professionals made statements COVID correct. many also made statements weren't. asking basically listen lottery numbers point.

Now point, agree, despite said, still considered slow response. discussion changing policies credibility. initially said still holds true. clean fault, still best hope. also help President spews nonsense, probably played factor well. better help clog hospitals invariably need ventilator... Oh forgot: EU population approx 400M, USA 320. really equal double, it? hey, knows. secret plan destroy Trump

 can't everyone see, he's wonderful entire world wants stop him, they're jealous President!

(except Putin Kims North Korea) healing crystals? think lot people want vaccine made China... Sad Brexit Noises last point irks most. Wanting experience summer pent quarantine/social distancing? get that. agree breaking it, sympathize. Blatantly disregarding risk bringing upon others, though? That's sick entitled. 'The Stupid Disease'. What’s top? That's precisely needs happen. folks ignore see numbers abstract things can't connect human suffering. Show videos wailing moms, mass graves, groaning patients cut time, maybe understand joke.

The difference like difference hearing 9/11 attacks seeing photos video people jumping deaths city chaos. People change see light; change feel heat. takes YEARS know herd immunity works, guess what..... didn't. You’re one said stay positive, thought making joke. didn’t negative thing, coulda light breezy way move past mildly amusing phrasing obstinately made sticking point. OP isn’t upset, you’re one. Ok, night dude. I’m out. Exponential growth. Let’s say unmitigated- infected person infect 2 people. course 14 days(the incubation period)-how many infections 1 person lead to?

1 person virus. gives virus 2 people. 3 people it. 2 give 2 people. 4 new patients. 7 total. 4? 2 each. 8 new patients- 15 patients. 8 gives 2. Add 16 (31 patients total) 16 lead 32 (63). 32 lead 64 (127). 64 lead 128 (255). 128 give 256 (511). 256 512 (1,023). 512 1,024 (2,047). 1,024 2,048 (4,095) 2,048 4,096 (8,191) 4,096 8,192 (16,383) 8,192 16,384 (32,767)

So. 14 days, 1 person lead 32,767 cases showing symptoms. course, one cases continue spread disease. 

Lets say social distancing, 1 person leads 1.5 people getting sick. 14 day period, 1 person lead 437 people getting it. 

We 90 days in. 
We already stopped many cases, saved many lives. waited? would run. Turkish Muslim here. Yeah clear cancelled year. Good thing closed early virus started, probably saved lot lives we're really grief. Stay healthy guys may soon Wrong got tested Tuesday results Sunday. first responder, showed urgent care symptoms told sick coworker didn’t test results yet 

Btw, tested positive LOL. Trump steamroll Antifa domestic terrorists soon enough. consider challenge studies. we're told unethical, immoral &amp; dangerous give people disease can't cure &amp; potentially fatal inform EU more. I'm saying perfect, far actually, ""EU"" often used scapegoat failure. concept EU much power. I’ve working San Antonio market whole time since lockdown. week, say 85% people see wearing masks. Grocery stores closer 50%, everywhere else (gas stations, restaurants, bars, etc) likely I’m one mask. Sorry jump here, things right now? I've got tickets darts Rotterdam September, I'm sure go ahead, chances we'll stay Amsterdam couple days. things open? Thank you! None means doesnt count treatment make light person's death, difference 80 dying years early someone 30. really scary, motivates 10's 100's millions get shape avoid obesity, net gain life lives, wishful thinking. wait so... USA, Russia Brazil banned, china ok? :D president thinks it’s flu. OK though dudes! pandemic over! .... ... .. . Fuck worry guess. fake news. wear mask. Continue usual. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE sensationalist areas report hospital system beyond capacity? think pretty relevant important people know. 1% US population 3m people. 12 active cases today caught border caught quarantine moved secure facilities, contacts tested negative. going keep arriving hopefully get community. He's right though. work American tech company London office Google Facebook huge London offices tax reasons businesses based Ireland. 

Very functional staff comparison work Ireland, staff companies see running joke they're 'based Ireland' whole also running building giant state art buildings London. KNEW. Months ago. would happen Mexico. think itd take long. Retarded best. Like, tempt fate? since think ""educated""，I think mey need ""reducated"" Comparisons USA UK pretty ridiculous. 

Parts USA opened month ago peak even reached. UK isn’t opening another 2 weeks based last weeks estimate around total 3,500 new cases day (which 26% previous week due updated today). puts similar situation EU countries managed reopen successfully rather USA.

As far reducing separation distance, reduced lot European nations managed far reopen successfully. Reduces fatalities 20%. That's still huge number deaths. stop getting it. huffed jockstraps high school

Damn making laugh sad situation. Well played sir. America, ""only"" 120,000 deaths. typical year, America see grand total something like 280,000 deaths. far, death toll higher average, still general scale. rate things growing, going much worse America. feel pain — left boyfriend Portugal come back US things started getting really bad (my mom lives alone incredibly worried). 

Was really hoping &amp; would get see year, news (coupled US’s continued “handling” COVID) makes hard stay optimistic.. mention local leaders areas initially scoffed Trump's travel bans encouraged people go celebrate Chinese new years wear masks. way people try repaint history... Narrator: won't. still 40% Americans behind him. I've saying weeks. logic saying words gain votes within constituency, least hurt badly paying back favor somewhere else. words themselves, mean mean, matter all. feel pain — left boyfriend Portugal come back US things started getting really bad (my mom lives alone incredibly worried). 

Was really hoping &amp; would get see year, news (coupled US’s continued “handling” COVID) makes hard stay optimistic.. It’s hidden horror people. us medical workers. videos/documentation people can’t see what’s going really important Won’t happen. keep paying. agree sentiment vote, Joe Biden undoubtedly better Trump, hold hope Biden going fix America meaningful way. Oh, try take Russia Europe, know, part EU. I’m Mars. laws apply me! can't generational wealth effectively got 1 2 generations behind even nominally equal rights, that's completely ignoring structural issues post civil rights era. like trying win 100m sprint someone 90m head start. I'm Placer county, lot people refusing wear well. Well, well, well... it’s consequences actions! [It's bit old, shows well stats excess deaths continued elevated anywhere world currently experiencing active Covid-19 infections. feel pain — left boyfriend Portugal come back US things started getting really bad (my mom lives alone incredibly worried). 

Was really hoping &amp; would get see year, news (coupled US’s continued “handling” COVID) makes hard stay optimistic.. Well pitiful response pandemic refusing believe happening calling 'democratic hoax' blaming nations it, telling people inject bleach, instructing less tests carried numbers lower, total death count 123,000 people hang head years come. human nature mistrust faceless entity beholden to, give taxes to, can't directly communicate with, arrest you, kill you, keep hearing scandals about. New Zealand better testing capacity peak find cases. Surprise, Texas. told so. worry produced vaccines fast tracked

The safety tests fast tracked. money that's fast tracked. Oxford University basically blank check every major government NGO world. long till blue, urban cities tell Abbot go fuck issue orders anyway? What’s gonna do? Tell no? Ok. stop cities enforcing themselves? mean, far gonna go stop them? wish Abbot’s fault, breakdown whole system, one wants step plate, let alone take bat shoulder. pathetic. Youtube built face bluring tool, upload uncensored video youtube able blur it, might violate HIPAA. Alternatively use Adobe Premiere free Fuck it, Canada temporarily join EU fuck trump. bonus get eurovision. totally agree...I live deep South Texas. 40 minutes south padre island , 2 test sites here. long ass lines. ""re-opened"", everyone went right back island bars. Sure limited ,but stop anyone. Shit, even went Mexico medication cuz VA closed . always mask. I've stayed home 95% time isolation. live ranch , go get food gas come right back. Still pretty shitty though. Mostly lack testing sites....so scaring others properly frustrating cities mostly blue! Mayor tried get Abbott agree restrictions/mandatory masks, wouldn’t allow it. Oregon governor said everyone wear mask inside.  Immediately largest grocery store chain, Fred Meyer (Kroger), said going enforce it. 

*Facepalm* think anything scaled testing mass producing billions units quickly.

Multiple governments already producing Oxford's vaccine risk. According Fauci, USA alone 100million doses end year. We're already making them. people get infected selected randomly. 

But people get virus likely people social contacts average person take less precotions. easy going America bad circlejerk duty. Great question states get helping elect fucking moron like trump. ones survive pandemic, hopefully smart enough never elect fucking reality TV cuck bag president again. never hear Reich Chancellor Merkel welcoming open arms tens millions migrants Middle East Africa? Ironic ended handling disease better it? people start influenced soon enough. Car accident? Sorry surgeon available, treating covid-patients. Cancer chemo? Sorry equipment used covid-patients. Please come back tommorow.

People support lockdown soon enough. Brazil like say hi! never knew thing moving Southern California. know dozens people (in late 20s/early 30s) straight addicted Disney. buy season passes Disneyland go every weekend.

Personally get it...Disneyland even great compared Disneyworld. done rides, main attraction seems spending ridiculous amounts mediocre park food. 10000 things I'd rather time money. mean fair enough, responding someone tested positive COVID-19. Turning joke ""phrasing"" issue little messed up. subreddit also heavily astroturfed China, suspect you’re downvoted saying this. seems alot people Mass. taking seriously well. least that's impression given Mass. plates see driving around increased foot traffic people almost assuredly breaking Maine's quarantine laws. Northern California took 5 days well. Last Thursday Tuesday left Houston worked ICU major hospital medical center. one cares. knew things going downhill month ago. 

Also wait get waves people hitting hospital avoiding usually brings can’t avoid anymore. Realistically, there’s way safe effective vaccine produced time soon

LMAO opinion vs. Fauci's. says vaccine roughly 6-8 months exactly funds coming build new hospital? going done needs funded federally, likely built US military Brought break work least month ago. think big lockdown protests Michigan.

""Can shut Newark Airport right now?"" 'Like.. forever?' Yeah, may want check deaths prior making claims. know, may count something. telecon Danish colleagues every day. open us this. closed hard, actually deaths per capita Florida everyone criticizing holding spring break opening beaches. wasn’t got hot people started spending less time outside Florida passed Denmark. don’t know feel lost. already need book flights, book Paris housing apply visa time don’t know go anywhere. Seems like ton dead ends nice automod 😞 guess I’ll go google instead trying add conversation Scotland please Trump can't play golf course. anyone know ratlines still operation? Tell family friend would rather die sprout acne. wonder job market like sun. LOL. EU opened like states did, wearing masks, give month. makes wheels turn will. agree this. market different 2008. Prices California gone creeped actually demand high supply low. Supply low people don’t want sell pandemic, part. Even forbearance eases up, don’t think prices fall still great deal demand, new building low, getting mortgage harder 2008 wish Washington would that. hotspot whole south east coast going crazy times. welcome clout. get us safe vaccine soon possible. possible military members? want get stationed europe pissed threatening lawsuits Gina Raimondo considering New Yorkers coming RI heights crisis New York show stats argue it’s impossible know someone contracted virus specifically, incubation times long, symptoms varied among populace lawyers retainer mention PR folks spin anyway necessary negate liability. Ok much due New Yorkers going say Rhode Island opposed Rhode Islanders coming NY? NYC metro area includes huge chunks NJ Connecticut millions people commute long distances city everyday. there's fact NYC major travel destination people East Coast people regularly fly airports near city continuing final destination...

I mean I'm necessarily saying New Yorkers didnt least help spread virus isnt really conclusive evidence New Yorkers allowed virus wouldnt spread widely across region. Fucking great. 2906, next day, Tuesday, 3001. grow tomorrow?

!remindme 1 day EU tourists banned US indefinitely, too. USA USA USA long? remember schooled Redditor US ranked number one pandemic response preparedness everything would fine. 

Bahahaha. Trump sure put stat rest. feels strongly shouldn’t go back course need money probably feels guilty going back. wish could ban Americans certain states entering State.

NY State expressed possibility quarantining travelers states.

I wish Michigan would follow suit. sums nicely.  supposed Europe right work past two summers. totally making right call here, we're mess. think understand important hair cut manicure is. Clearly covid 19 less important. /S hoping see new wild unkept hairstyles emerge many months lockdown guess wait covid 19 mutate. Texas Medical Center predicting 14 days they're beds completely. much country that’s option right Mexico, way (

What Canada? problem though? want see world get know people study present data support conclusion mortality reduction early pandemic compared mortality treated patients study attributable use drug. learned lot disease gotten better caring patients. may benefit using medication, 87% mortality reduction. Quick question. 

# google 3 digit number put ""corona virus cases,"" shows whole bunch results giving exact number. absolutely detest conspiracy theories keep hearing it. Could someone plz provide reason give this? Example search: ""777 corona virus cases."" doubt government failed us failed people, thought (USA) could contained eliminated COVID19 preposterous. think undeniable world-class quality US hospitals probably led false sense security, even Americans aware limitations US healthcare system support public healthcare. People looked happening China Iran, even Italy (they reputation poorly run country, though that's totally untrue relation healthcare) thought happen back home. Turns individually brilliant hospitals help population level *at all*. US may well saving individual lives would lost countries, many people dying regardless almost immaterial.

As anyone would expect well-coordinated federal effort current administration, well, can't answer one. Lufthansa still cancel flight Rome July 1st citing ""not significant change schedule"".

Lolwat

Fuck country completely failing us pandemic travel companies greedy bastards. early Feb, terrible cough two weeks kept night. drank much NyQuil took many mucus meds. I'm like 90% sure then. Well we're agreement there. think we'd like see effective federal government. appreciate said scapegoat tactic haha. I'm guilty sometimes ( are) thank mature it, says lot. Lots people would double nice see internet conversation go way once!

Anyways, let's get fucker November turn Democratic Party best party be! That's absolutely rich coming him, since flipped shit threatened sue state Rhode Island thing Based information? ""They said masks work*"" fly hospital normally uses...masks.

^*when ^used ^incorrectly I'm curious ""wear new mask every time"" thing. virus die surface little while? strict staying home, venture every days really need something. virus died mask then? Thats say we’ll never going get technology person cant figure machine email bust document please stop calling leaving voice messages email dont know voice mail password Watch cheer now.

USA! USA! We're Number 1! We're Number 1!

.... oh.... shit... oh god. US continues willing petri dish, Mexico might pay Wall all. one comes grandma's house LA stays inside 2 weeks. trend like see. afford it. Good thing buy ticket Paris next May. Here’s hoping outlasts trump years worth suggestions lined Biden think mandatory masks great idea. like great idea require safety inspections rules road people don’t kill pedestrians motorists, course ourselves.

What wouldn’t support shutting driving. Yes, would save lives motor accidents like banning sex needles would probably stop spread HIV. things complicated important ban altogether risks threat level. 

And government sucks deeming “essential” not. Take town example, liquor store head shop never close rules. food bank next door close. 

Shutting society many unintended consequences, better damn sure threat proportional warrant that. even spread 60 percent us, suspected herd immunity threshold, would still take less average lifespans auto accidents US. wouldn’t willing shut driving avoid deaths would we? would work.

And look this:

Spain? would support ban cars would erratically accelerate, also randomly lose steering, crash others, none automakers understand cars that, solution, wanna follow analogy ""you banned us?? Well... ban you!"" shows dumb selfish people world. dont think flight cancelled yet, EU prohibits travel soon would make sense flight would get cancelled right? They're looking Hawaii going ""if we!"" Never mind fact New York probably thousands access points would need monitored 24/7 Big gatherings people known cause problems. Re-opening + large gatherings people + people getting slack... probably added current bump. yeah, guessing.  Lots people cannot afford ""just stay home"" even 2 weeks, let alone 6 months more. Lots essential jobs cannot done remotely. Lots people can't afford order shit online. Admonishing people staying home reveals really considered that. username checks likely good time kidney theft. father national EU country, registered living right now, main business elsewhere splits time home countries).

Watching live feed, counting number masks, really two words come mind regarding Dream City right now: Petri. Dish. We've lost friends family. part going life. 

And though unlikely believe me, I'll try anyhow - child risk dying natural disaster COVID. risk small nearly impossible measure. indictment Trump administration. Ok then. Keep trusting numbers. number anti-mask imbeciles low *high average IQ*, brought industries elite universities attract cognitive elite. 

Education make smarter adult. Rather, presence good universities attract 18 year olds already smart. 18 year olds finish university grad school, stay good place married send kids public school.

If made kids Clay County, KY attend public school Middlesex County, vice versa, test scores Middlesex County, would go stay down. Good upbringing helps increase kids' IQs good genes also factor in.  Watching Colorado. would excellent time Western States Pact solidify around public health measure. Houston problem lolwat indefinitely, mean end pandemic? Obviously definition, indefinite could amount time, afterwards likely reopen? Tourism important countries, way title worded sounds like Americans banned reason forever numbers best country RIGHT NOW. guess what? took seriously Stay Home ordered. always going happen. ever 2 options - eradicate completely learn live it. People whatever reason refuse socially distance. see shops, protests, beach etc. 

Unless lock (we can’t economically/people won’t socially) need get used numbers higher stop analysing every new case death media. incredible stupid. “No 50 people per space.” There’s way kids K-3 wear masks day go one another. Also, guess staff 50 won’t coming back. high school students pack hallways classes going real well staying 6 feet away go lockers. :/ fanciest Totos market auto closing lids auto flush lid closed.

Duhhh. didn’t tell Fauci part. they're still going blame Hillary Obama this. I'm betting $$$ it. incompetent administration wants us dead. Looking you, orangeclown. never effective vaccine took years develop? Fauci recently warned so.

 Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said earlier month vaccine may provide long-term immunity Covid-19 behaves like coronaviruses.  look history coronaviruses, common coronaviruses cause common cold, reports literature durability immunity that’s protective ranges three six months almost always less year,” said interview June 2 JAMA Editor Howard Bauchner. “That’s lot durability  today Wishful Thinking ‘20, Same! absolutely awful. That’s terrible. reason message didnt get across people. whole point quarantine bring case levels manageable level, KEEP social distancing masks etc. Except everyone seems think masks pussies thing now. Without restrictions required keep case numbers future, three month quarantine economic suffering wasted. Good. Honestly countries considering something similar. shoe fits seems like lot. welcone UK bit crazy moment racist buffoon charge big fucking deal determine pandemic plays across nation, whether succeed individually drag up, dragged weakest state.  Lol. many people argued saying told stupid suggest something similar would happen outside NYC. fact thought “prepared” NYC too. time chance ICUs run reason tristate area got hit though. lot us commute NYC is/ tourist hub lot people got infected unknowingly people countries brought home communities. blame us working guess.... week ago area, family gathering 30 resulted 15 cases covid - exponentially better per capita California.

Vancouverites flipping fuck comment sections  typically reporting 50 cases/day whole country, getting number Toyko bit worrying. OK, Tokyo big city, 10% Japanese population. Adoption new safety protocols always slow. Seat belts, motorcycle helmets, bicycle helmets, public cigarette smoking, drinking pregnant, infant car seats, list goes on. mention diet, exercise, moderation. Canadian, travel enjoy outing people like you. hard -- start detailed conversation anything Canadian. realise Canadian thing doing... I'm dual US citizen can't help myself. Da conomy understand wear mask. But, feel control behavior understand you. Living free country wonderful thing. wear mask day, shower it, sleep it, sleep it. shame try insult ""belief."" feel need shun people wish wear mask? Maybe watch much fake news? Maybe group-think thing? It’s probably best Almost definitely I'm saying needs said people take seriously.

The economy complicated, **tied** public health. Poverty industries running materials also causes death, restrictions need compared risk infection avoided minimize number lives list, figures protests, hand, let's quick comparison June 23, 120,333 American deaths COVID-19, 21.2% black.

120,333 times 21.2% = 25,510 black deaths COVID-19 (so far)

These protests unjustified police killings unarmed unarmed black suspects killed 2015 according pessimistic biased source possible, BLM (and we'll even assume unjustified killings sake argument)

25,510 black deaths / 104 black deaths per year = **245 years**.

If protests 100% successful police never kill unarmed black suspect, take 245 years save many black lives COVID-19 *already* taken. could waited boat Netherlands/US. feel helpless. Wow. fascinating least september. Likely year either. Ahhhhh yes forgot pay Articles Incorporation Delaware, Oklahoma, California, think others like also. 

Super interested read though, thank you! Sure, it’s coincidence companies picked country Europe lowest tax rate. point wouldn’t expect see trend expand rest Europe unless also plan lowering tax rate. difficult realize every commercial flights coming US atm, least infections, extremely high risk.

Totally support idea. humid Texas Florida Large considering testing low. love it. NY depends lot tourism. think would love rest country get collective heads asses however. somebody who's worked minimum wage food service I'm worried this. 

The whole attitude ""if call sick well cut hours""
So people call sick honestly didn’t problem Trump shitshow. expected fuck things badly pleasantly surprised first 3 years. finally occurred ""Making America Great Again"" meant reducing America shithole country status Europe going literally ban American travelers. defense richest covid colony world going us. USA! USA! USA! Nobody knew cutoff back then. nobody knows now, far tell. one important things need know. 

Colorado reopened preschools seem huge new vector. see tax rates countries Europe. us can’t even afford live. Americans boat comes that. 

Also want point EU fking big time many levels. even taken seriously. mean don’t even spend 2% taxes military. joke. flights USA booked June, airline didn’t cancel despite USA allowing residents let reschedule. Booked September I’m wondering even that’s soon don’t get it. Kids 10 unlikely get article says kids get adults. make unlikely get it? think really highlights failings specific states versus United States whole. note, 12 states visual second wave (namely: spike, decrease, spike) 9 12 led conservative governors. think there's certainly something said Trump influencing governors open early (my governor Georgia, No-Brain Kemp, definitely opened early impress Trump make money bank bowling interests), state initiatives large divide country. 

I think different responses different states short stopping travel nationwide merited done, fact ineffective governance state level directly led terribly country handled pandemic. exactly people talk irl, guys talk Bowler Hats walking sticks ""Monsieur"" other? could still buy rent ford? girlfriend lives Netherlands. America. utterly terrified leaving situation, mom became gravely ill May decided come back. anyone know anything?? able get back Amsterdam see girlfriend anytime soon??

I hate anxiety. want know next time I'll able see person love most. Corona virus global crisis, limited continent requires cooperation rather unilateral European Union disapproves fact US decision impose travel ban taken unilaterally without European Union taking strong action limit spread virus.
       
      
That's entirety joint statement, pretty mild. Anyway, US wants deal alone, it. Shit, write US sounds like Poland. Lockdown wasted due political infighting incompetence ruling party. Everyone stopped using masks many wore chins mouth, nose, like complete idiots. Completely. raced 12,000 - 4 months ago. ya unbelievably control compared massive disaster happening u.s.a might add first cases day. real story here? really kidding. Cesar step back installed dictator lifetime, still time go Romans. Funny thing people killed Cesar nowadays portrayed evil, fact wanted save democracy. backfired Cesar seen man people Roman population. guess Cesar reigned years would become unpopular enough killing would backfired. Sulla really evil stepped accordance Roman constitution. *shave ice That's hate people say ""research it"".  mean 6 month double blind study 5,000 participants? Or, mean Google drink beer read 3 headlines watch 1/3 YouTube video? He's saying response racist daft get that. live Florida went universal one day, part way safer almost anything else Florida cause you’re mostly outside kicked wearing mask respecting social distancing. universal stop rest plaza pee literally 20 people inside small shop one wearing mask. ridiculous. Anywhere else Florida even orders one respects masks requirements. getting people killed every single day idiocy. Make mistake. man trading away Floridians' lives get MAGA street cred. That's is. confess know Florida LLC rules. 

But Delaware, vast majority formed, definitely easy. easily set one public information (free paid) registered agent - owners, managers, members, etc. 

Ownership proved operating documents, publicly filed, hence challenge proving cop roadblock house.

Here one random fair, testing widespread now. Three months ago practically needed doctors signature get test. Many places offer PCR test anyone. 

If places still lot excess deaths, hiding purpose. Look increases pneumonia deaths - absolutely see seasonal spike summer. Man love European Union/EEA :)
So many countries choose from.  Yeah homeschool sure able. Kids get better education times way double bonus. true...China shut schools Public transportation joke...

Numbers date:

- EU Covid cases: 2.5M
- US Covid cases: 2.4M

- EU Covid deaths: 180K
- US Covid deaths: 124K Lockdown may costly u can’t forever. Many East Asian cities high population densities didn’t even go full lockdown (only partial lockdown). key curbing infections really get everyone wear **face mask** outside like GTFO 1918 end war tho, like 1915 Somme Come man. come 757. reedemable. lot great people, mix progressive thinking backwardness.  Real cases America right 100 200 thousand per day. Maybe more. Maybe, think one needs compare actual risks June 23, 120,333 American deaths COVID-19, 21.2% black.

120,333 times 21.2% = **25,510** black deaths COVID-19 (so far)

These protests unjustified police killings unarmed unarmed black suspects killed 2015 according pessimistic biased source possible, BLM (and we'll even assume unjustified killings sake argument)

25,510 black deaths / 104 black deaths per year = **245 years**.

If protests 100% successful police never kill unarmed black suspect, take 245 years save many black lives COVID-19 *already* taken. Oh yeah, 100% agreed that. Would useful see data aggregated one site Maybe start saying wearing masks enhances personal freedom live. he's trained science, medicine entire life. take crash course diplomacy save lives, knows could replaced someone politicize decisions. Unfortunately country wasted lockdown like US people wore masks chins. :( Hope end badly (I'm Poland). deserve it. Please protect rest responsible world us. Doomed girlfriend lives Amsterdam... I'm Texas. working going school there. think I'll shot getting in? treatment foreign nationals residing US work study might far worth inconsistent US visa governmental regulations H1bs, H4, L1 etc. talented workers India wait 15~20 years get permanent residency. Imagine life built 15 years sudden you’re kicked due bs visa processes know typed words response see farts? 🤷🏼‍♀️ War like stock market crash. Afterward, seems blatantly obvious happen lead up, see coming.

I think one things help keep cold war becoming WWIII constant awareness might coming everyone working prevent it. opposite people believe happen likely dangerous.  said, WWI shocked people time thought alliances Europe preventing civilized nations going war.  one prepared actually deal new technology developed. cold war never dealt drone warfare truly unprepared drone warfare massive scale. Please love god hope masks aren’t permanent. miserable way live. HOUSTON-AREA INTENSIVE CARE UNITS 97% CAPACITY: CITY OFFICIAL He’s complaining government. governor never said wear mask you’re taking walk neighborhood. Clearly, said this

“the media talks lot people struggling pay. talk ones can.”

You must need magic function government blown chance waiting safe let reopen ever reopen? credible authority tell people safe. fear trying save economy opening early set path worse economic harm stuck lockdown another month got cases low enough capacity high enough effective contact tracing. Jim Mattis coward abandoned ideals country position something it. Fuck bullshit warrior poet persona. Hes small cowardly moral midget. full morgues? Unrefrigerated bodies Florida would really, really, really big problem  *Just nu intensivvårdas 190 personer med sjukdomen, den lägsta siffran sedan åtminstone 30 mars* 

190 ICU, lowest number since march 30. Quick! Get wigs instead masks virus can’t tell they’re bald!  /s so? proved wring can’t back anything say up? without heed might try get way. 

Or without heed anything else. anything like I've seen here, white people social-distancing wearing masks. thousands die hospitals ran. understand now? lady long hair, shave beard months ago. hey Baseball back. like memory reason suspended first place. gonna kill idiots  Yeah, y'all argument essentially arguing point. It’s easy spread! That’s problem. matter many people staying home takeout, it’s spreading via people still going business usual. much separate groups people. That’s all. promise spikes people wear masks, stay home, stay away people somehow miraculously turn super spreaders. every 5 people take seriously haven’t around anyone unmasked months, need 1 person doesn’t care, goes meets 49 people bar don’t care, go different bar next night, forth. millions millions people taking precautions. it’s spreading. saying you’ll never catch masks + distance design going link chain, you’ll terminal point. OP needs like 600,000 deaths maybe he'll recognize problem. Let's patient! /s  idea you’ll dead. might make end today let alone year. gets hot enough car day sterilize masks, works out. rigorous standards place, I'm sure FDA utilize.

[Disclaimer that's say curse instead  harder time imagining uneducated asshole feels cool posting information get people sick dead. hurting eating junk food contagious you, though. People internet are. messaging bit unclear. disease could prevented turning catastrophe didn't? 1 many. stay home much possible, thanks. wear mask go grocery store, basically time go shopping. 

So stop trolling. know true mortality rate could anywhere 0.25% 2%. depends area. example live country lot old people lot underlying health conditions death rate could high 2%. live country less old people people underlying health conditions death rate could 0.25% average. Doesn’t matter rules makes, affects privileged white woman immediately rescind it. think consider potential density spreaders. Somebody spreading virus affect many people linear scale. 

So could theoretically expected population density virus carriers/spreaders exponential rather linear effect rate spread, areas low density may see rise statistically low enough missed drive major impact, depending participant's behavior outside protests.

As others said, could also open environment largely abiding masking impact too. 

I find hypocritical many people totally gatherings many businesses allowed responsibly operate totally gung ho mass public demonstrations dismissing risk. happened though, could good source important data vaccines proven work post exposure prophylaxis like rabies vaccines. Florida certainly behind reporting. daily totals posted morning little changes throughout day. Texas California's numbers finalized later evening. Stay home, believe bullshit till curve goes Like workplaces going enforce this? top I'm amazed ( although be) govenor pushed phase 3. Comments subs boast low numbers vigilant. 

Call doomer disaster waiting happen. source? Someone hire man. probably massive protest Philly 15-20k numbers still going down. probably 90-95% wearing masks even though super hot day doctors nurses walking around putting hand sanitizer everyone’s hands since outside people able decently spread wanted. increase domestic violence would probably even greater would total lock can't know sure.

But get pretty damn good idea looking statistics countries went lockdown. Wow protesting human rights stop COVID don’t say  Japan, China. South East Asia general.

In Japan, students wear masks example public transport before/during major exams help getting sick. Workers wear masks important projects reason.

I believe might cause public transport far common US, densly packed everywhere people know one sick person infect entire bus they're careful.

Also, people feel sick wear masks get people sick well. considered common sense courtesy so. sorts long term issues come surviving.

No one looking risk ""will die not"". Plenty people issues 3+ months infected arguing yourself. That's exactly covid disastrous. reason people admitted ICU. unusual pretty full first place. add covid cases never prevalent bad. hard brain process? confident protect, mean get it. simple.

also, ""can protect against"" ≠ ""will protect against"".  worried dont know became bad. Unless know reason, guarantee happen again. what's wrong social media. article January 2018. course bother click commenting on. get impression people think lifetime event well. handled pandemic poorly, expect something nastier comes along years road? practice round America instead got pushed around thanks doofus supporters. currently waiting tested partner waiting three hours already. Florida isn’t coming time soon. Terrible headline. Dining restaurant last thing opened economy. literately way safety. here, I'm almost 100% sure late Jan early Feb, time took antibody test late June.. antibodies left. insane wildly irresponsible people virus.  Guy front Dunkin' Donuts lowered mask sneezing fit bother cover nose.

No ""Bless You"" issued. mention July 4th coming too. Lots people partying. 

My sister bar tender Dallas TX got exposed last week. Tested negative thankfully shut steak house 72 hours everyone get tested one employees tested positive. 

My sister test positive antibody test, thinks February sick shit orange moron could anything cooperation anyone virulent racist. Australia one death month, truly sad see many suffer die due corrupt incompetent leaders. see comment before, reason.     
I see coincide?    
I compared different groups persons (asymptomatics, unlikely tested; persons tested positive mild symptoms stay home 9 days) 2 different things (how much contagious long contagious). Ah, fate aging Karen.  guy's foot met mouth. Good job! hard due health privacy laws. That's massive amount videos crazy shit happens hospitals, ambulances, etc. Currently browsing reddit ventilator hood Good, good wait 4th July (or say 2 weeks that) real deal...

My stupid boss forcing us go back work ... even though 100% people company 100% work company laptops *from anywhere world*... don´t even live US people office also made go back, CEO ""does believe remote work"". Oh hey, dude posts pro Chinese government propaganda Mattis intelligent, well read, well educated, aware value human life laser-focused achieving victory.  


Being promask would expect him. Fauci tomorrow: must reiterate haven’t seen anything like covid 19 experience....the flu still killed people time worry, they'll turn section 8 write-offs, collect whatever government pays turns rent let term slums point Glad understand fractions work, good you. people’s lives talking about. moral compass points really far south see numbers. media government officials response whole disgusting. Essentially it’s lay back pray.

Why aren’t promoting healthy lifestyles? US obesity heart disease pandemic. Makes wonder countries like Japan / South Korea faired well. look average health diet comparative countries. Japanese diet consists majority rice, fish, meats, vegetables.. isn’t media promoting staying healthy? best shape deal virus infected, ways boost immune system. less self inflicted morbidities e.g obesity, smoking ect less chance dying. 

But instead use political vehicle. Honestly disgusting handled.  either read last sentence post? lockdown restrictions work governor Lt. Governor NEVER intended work! fall trap. northeast much population density reign in, anywhere it. simply unwillingness take seriously, lead should-be criminal government testing adequate. cutting steps, parallel save time. worry, hear open beds Wichita Falls. 381 miles away. Get right quick! summarize, whether full lockdown recommend isolation, typically see rise domestic violence. (Finland appears outlier here, going link.) It'd interesting actual numbers this, see logical conclusion holds true - isolate, domestic violence increases.

For worth, I've never held opinion Swedish strategy would avoid increase domestic violence, expect increase bad country going full lockdown. happens true, anti-anti-lockdown crowd course welcome argue increase domestic violence would totally worth beat virus. agree though. ties back socioeconomic disparity. Poor people often obese cheaper food less healthier. Since median income African Americans less White Americans, see % obese African Americans obese white Americans.  reason replied downward trend stopped.

Deaths week week (it's dropping nicely recently).

Cases gone ton, along - positive test rate highest since mid-may (showing 'more tests').

So looks like hit trough. subsist magic alone. people ICU risk point. lot people never admitted hospital left lung scarring. less severe cases might even know decades.

I multiple bouts bronchitis 20s left lung scarring.  I'm mid 40s can't take walk without inhaler. need couple years ago.

My dad TB teenager, recovered, fine decades started respiratory problems. 

That's going covid lot people, serious complications later life. Tim Europe. safety testing thing, point vaccine triggers really bad side effects. actual covid causes multi system inflammatory illness kids obviously want make sure inactivated vaccine doesn’t cause Ironic case particular post. That’s hilarious. post 2 year old article? Maybe resurfaced show hospital prepared time around? IDK world pretty much end this, anything countries like Poland Germany seeing second waves plan ending lockdown entered quickly. 

Or mean another couple months EU countries Spain fabricate death toll thousand? 

Or mean wait months watch EU start arguing pay UK's missing contribution time discussing bailout Italy (a previous net contributor, one few) Spain right Germany enters historic recession (currently forecast contract 6.5% year alone)? 

Watch EU member states ask Russian military assistance member states refusing help? need go back couple months that. 

Considering moment (and, entirely panemic far), EU done worse USA, perhaps move glass house throwing stones? rates research 7.1 per cent given Remdesivir compared 11.9 per cent among placebo.

I thought Remdesivir didn’t help mortality? guess that’s big enough effect? understand hits right July 4th holiday weekend. Yikes. dumbest opinion reddit won’t seem go away Wait thought young people worry virus? would go hospital?

/s NO! works countries fine. product sowing political division decades telling Americans unique individuals whose personal freedom whatever fuck want highest good society offer them. 👍👍👍 Haha wow. logical dissonance incredible. Idiots thankful they're healthy enough complain! Canada restricted get testing unless meet set guidelines. varies slightky province province essentiallly must meet following:

* travelled previous 14 days
* consistent fever
* dry cough 
* age 65

The US actually one world leaders testing per capita. top 20ish, Canada around 40th, South Korea around 75th. 

The President South Korea likewise said mid February would gone weeks. blame EU, me. sister's close friend mom ICU it. I'm Texas. first affects us.

Grateful family friends taking seriously point. Shocked number people not. Well yeah that’s true, acknowledge well. 

She said personally bought lot change talked about, far seems baby dissenting opinions. said Biden hopefully bring back middle worried would one term president due age. dude talking ass. I'm North side ridiculous numbers people going restaurants pent appetite lockdown period lol need repaint Sith deals absolutes. Exactly. It’s worse furloughed I’m forced work it. I’m making less unemployed. Aah didn’t see one, compare 90% base occupancy normal capacity come number. normal capacity mean base capacity. 

Luckily though still expand capacity, bit worrying. Taunt us free healthcare? XD called functional medical system unlike us strongly worded email solve problem.

Help, fire. Fuck Trump particular thinks elections. said spitting help win election shamelessly promote it.  endanger others everything do. cases decided potential danger worth benefits freedom.

Also unless infected, killing endangering anyone so... mean, originated there, also locked people inside homes chains etc. police arguably even worse US police.  

But hey, forgive forget guess. (Ryanair) refunding people ask to. emailed also contacted Twitter. got money back yesterday given voucher instead months ago. I’m scientist think sounds like damn good news keeping hospitals overloaded, supplies stretched thin, understand people can't comprehend slow process. people selfish! Sorry you’re going true. president minimizing threat federal government recently announcing plans shutdown funding statewide testing sites, many people take virus seriously. Numbers Illinois pushing full stream ahead - buses already crowded, restaurants opening. Hardly anyone wearing mask. still around 600 cases per day... give month two months state screwed again. afford run second California home surely figure way someone shop sanitize products afterwards. 

Dont pussbag. Running state state possibly carrying new hotspots LITERALLY worst thing could country right now. happens president incompetent twat anyone inform EU 15 soon we’ll 0? Gross. Sewage yellow phase sentence. talking about?

I'm Houston experience seems quite opposite claiming. 

I've seen restaurant parking lots seem full coronavirus. I've pick food work restaurants super busy people going business usual.

Hopefully new mask policy Houston helps little theres lot ignorance overcome. doubt business drop significantly unless another lockdown. Anything different established norm looked suspicion, distrust, skepticism. ""Who cares protects people?! can't tell do! MUH FREEEDOM HURHURHURHUR."" need shut back down. I’m quit job forcing this. don’t care get unemployment not. isn’t safe go work state one wearing masks social distancing job. feeling lot things take granted United States short supply.  second true. past 17 years, studied continuity government pandemics infectious diseases. Everything thrown window day 1 federal response. Bars clearly safe. People go bars want people. want drink alone. move little closer. talking faces close distance.  really physical facility. people behave.

Restaurants safe, usually not.  table party dining room, people live house, waiter wears mask....  But, restaurant owners want dining rooms full crowded. problem is, restaurants good food, ones crowded.... swear read study recently showed 1-3 year immunity much like coronaviruses Bronx might hit particularly hard sure. governors took virus seriously part, seen, people followed. done great job making bad situation much better, even good, one; states seeing high spikes far fewer cases early on, didn’t take seriously imo thought would never “like us” see high numbers, reopened early never enough. needlessly suffer it. Also us even access vaccine first high risk folks first dibs  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Source? parquet courts recent album - - [before water gets etc There's leadership support political leadership useless, people got tired went back knew before. W  curious, contact tracing work US? guys registred adresses municipalities. health agencies reach people? Word mouth?

Yeah, Ebola, drop dead one two days, takes weeks thing kill you. deaths probally start spiking next weeks. hard work US contain virus wasted. I’m wondering keep cases returning NYC went though much. Passing responsibility claiming sole authority allowing locals manage things forced beginning. Remdesevir trial better that's new standard care according Fauci ;) economic crisis going sad :(

Yes, :( Couldn’t agree more, go world coronavirus form see us state shit world doesn’t care People Netherlands followed well, even though hate follow rules personally agree with.

Government genius idea calling covid rules ""_intelligent_ lockdown"". wants seen unintelligent? thought coronavirus America per POTUS declaration ? plus LA stupid af also getting travelers places never guarantee, grab opportunities offered, succeed. Success relative. I'm talking modest middle class. Become cop teacher. There's law US stopping yourself. It’s almost like 50 governors shooting hip terrible way control pandemic, way coordinate kind federal response executive leader Unless parties wearing properly fitted respirators, answer no. may best... matter patients can't afford treatment. Yeah, get hit substantial hurricane going really bad everyone path. read yesterday must've incorrect then. Incest rape pregnancies? saying could possibly protests retail shopping experiences causing increase infections since anti racism protests cannot cause increase spread nature important virus. 

These people must gotten walking around beach. I've heard ""the beach"" place massive spread too. sure protests beach?

(/s case doesnt come across way) blame one bit. unfortunate thing Americans stuck moron time being. best interest take upon safe.  still first wave Precisely. choose lockdown. There's national strategy would guess it'll governors cities. Ah okay, might misremembering things. hope people still taking virus seriously! Well, know New Zealand’s economy screwed closed borders relies 33% gdp tourism. met one Texan life. cliche seemed one open minded american met, worked many NGO humanitarian education field, spoke many languages.

I syrp Honestly lets also ban west Worcester Americans realize entire world suffering? cases also 300,000 000 people. Outside NYC surrounding areas vast majority US par seeing elsewhere.

NYC unique world one areas regularly see outbreaks diseases like measles world's largest population ultra-orthodox religious followers. change even then. That's aMErica works. take long, correct PLENTY people wearing masks NY right now. comment I'm predicting we're GOING.

We're slowly steadily rising numbers, something happened yet. sheer number tourists coming places like Texas staggering.

I really see going well. I'm thinking another month we'll really dire state. People freedom taken away,and like it. time,many forced ,look deep inside body mind,learn new skills,get crafty,and forced go right outside back yards,and walk around block learn see nature.

Things people think doing. would hope would grateful newfound gifts ,things life,and lucky alive. shame never look way. makes Hurricane Season even concern year. fair mindset. many things got dangerous toxic. toxic dog food, toxic drywall... mean, go amazon see, people literally ask something china. think that's racist. think that's quality control china caring something safe not. headline completely false, like headlines days. point I’m buying weapon. civil war happens handled well cases, transmission, death rate went way around here, yes high numbers originally. didn’t end lockdown early half hearted response.

[Source lastly, Covid-19 dashboard published state collects important data one place. [find  posted since happened. I'm sure adding conversation point. EU keep low profile think twice casting judgement things went US. figures speak see US manage flatten curve whereas EU saw massive spikes saw health systems collapse countries (at least Italy, Spain France). Yes we're tail end, we've one hell head start. worst part it’s politically motivated willful ignorance, like said information slow transmission already states done successfully. Right Mass lowest rate transmission country starting reopen reasonable safety measures. Meanwhile states south might looking second quarantine refusal follow science. flew week ago wore gloves TSA issue. people don’t won’t ask remove anything.  Yosemite like Disneyland. Make sure living arrangement beforehand, difficult secure housing. think best way look way Bill Burr put Joe Rogan’s podcast day. isn’t verbatim, something like, “I’m gonna sit without medical degree take advice another person medical degree. I’ll check CDC take whatever advise they’re putting there.” 

Personally, think that’s probably best way go it. Depending listen to, never leave house next five years go carelessly lick floors subway station cause it’s hoax. listen CDC fuck news station people stupid social media app say. want plague rats

You EU European continent already. know handful people called doctor COVID-19 symptoms told thing: monitor fever goes 103 go ER, go breathing problems. Otherwise, take counter meds help fever self quarantine symptom free least 3 days. none ever tested even though told likely virus. Would reluctance test people symptoms indicate testing availability still limited? Lol 11 downvotes already. Doomers triggered lmao Sydney would safer! poor leadership, sociopathic leadership actively working make situation worse. Like always did, lol. US tourism big here. bourgeoisie need someone serve them. know hard cook clean yourself? I'm watching horror another state. New York got hit hard. Mostly concentrated New York City. state took seriously, albeit really arrived. 3 months later we're reopening. area never got hit hard, everyone right thing. context, drove nonstop car, would take 20 hours get Florida, 48 hours get Texas. plane 1.5 FL 3 TX. outbreak feel like problem given far away are. Also, state handles outbreak differently. There's unified national response, partially country big population density varies. virus hitting state area varying degrees severity. state government specific powers federal government have. likely different country organized. Best snipers world. Also health care make sure have, like, headaches shakes somesuch. 
I mean, really would threaten Alaska universal health care Charter. They'd run screaming. *shakes insulin aggressively* Lmao unbelievably wrong anti mask mentality frustrating. What, exactly problem?

No one asking wear inside home driving car walking outdoors.

That insanity Trump presidency Without World War happening

…Yet. Give time everything age like fine wine. blame them? country embarrassing. It’s almost informed healthcare worker scientist saw coming leader state opened appease wealthy donors mitigate sales tax deficit. 

The asshole sacrificed public health Texans rich people. It’s always money. Kentucky one place vote due COVID-19 forced open court order.

That seems pretty important me. yet morning big radio morning show website posted pic ridiculing box masks said side box didnt protect virus. course post followed dozens likes laughs various conspiracy theory comments ends spectrum. 

It's like opposition ""mask movement"" doesnt even pretend opposing viewpoint. oppose masks, general.   think true general US sells stronger meds over-the-counter Netherlands, apply ibuprofen. widely cheaply available every pharmacy supermarket. he's right bill, no? shit, could least participated pandemic noooo. dick JYna. expensive. losing 10 Billion dollars day closed, fully recover vaccine, definitely money issue. political issue. 

It's almost like leaders care lives economy. staying power.

Terrified returning work equally terrified going pay rent food. Florida fucked. Yes, perfect example collective people failure even government best. 

1. 60-70℅ people wear masks. 

2. Many chill around tea stalls without masks social distancing. 

3. attitude ""it going happen me"".

4. attitude ""I eaten well life, good"".

5. add little bit "" Rules meant broken"". 

Here's recipe disaster. better stick plan opening DisneyWorld. use It’s Small World floating ICU unit. sucks. Since metal good conductor heat, may able insulate bendable metal strip something (medical tape?) burn skin easily. Exactly, dare people dress want. demand masks forced comply, thats freedom right? Right? Thank kind words. celebration wear blackface Anything sees threat retaining presidency attack.  shame paracetamol anti-inflammatory useful many situations.

Maybe friends family well-informed general population, thought common knowledge Netherlands paracetamol pain ibuprofen sick -- exactly anti-inflammatory purposes. Op, stats posted don’t support headline. ICU average occupancy right way way WAY capacity. 


Can mods clean shit show train wreck post???!!! Tests protesters conducted June 17 18. positive test rate state June 13 reported 3.1%, day results announced (June 23) 1.9-2%. means test rate state time tested protesters 2.5-2.7%. 

You need evidence sampling bias assert sampling bias, since results appear much line state-wide results. Said another way: evidence protests resulted infections day-to-day activities. Look last two days CAwent 5,528 6,503 ... 17.6% increase. think modern privacy laws kept tragic scenes reaching public blame lack respect pandemic US.

We’ve seeing stuff Italy tragic horrifying, HIPPAA seem allow this... Texas (or USA, fact); specifically causing this? 

I'm Montreal, apart big summer festivals feels like everything reopened (some businesses limited capacity) yet curves still go down, even instance people wear masks... *literally* like normal southern US? packed concerts all? What's causing specifically. SUMMER...Imagine going look like winter hits flu season coincides covid. going disaster. Well need peer review got media endorsement would put random ex-government employee PSA? User karma farmer, please block  would dream I'm sure super highly skilled emigrate there. dust cloud fully contained, it’s particles dust, gone July. 

I wonder impact hurricane season all? one hand might make hurricane formation harder. 2020, likely turn hurricanes massive sand blasters. local reports Florida popping DoH told slowly delete recent death data looks like Florida getting better leading *Phase 3* reopening July 4 reality getting much worse. Oh god! That's disgusting. Where? shit part person young, almost certainly die (though do), spread around infect people much likely die. That's especially shitty this. Black Death everyone potential victim. COVID-19 much likely kill 60 others otherwise healthy. makes angry people say, ""Lol, whatever, they're old. They're going die anyway."" Um, no. I'm sure they'll accept weird Logan's Run attitude they're older.... (weirdly) best snipers world. would ride majestic moose border pewpew eating said poutine. Well, it'd fed us, would need hold guns. We're working logistics. We're horrified (those us brains). I've house since March 12 asshole. worries. less testing, go rally. Virus disappear magically. call President Xi build ICU. take 10 days. think Japan etc Asian countries shown need lockdown keep coronavirus control everyone wears mask. different levels elective - elective lifesaving heart surgery maybe wait month absolutely beds (not really elective, small chance delay causes serious problems death) vs gall bladder uncomfortable (and likely stay way, small chance causes new serious problems) vs need knee replacement.

At moment still three; buffer takes days shut week two clear ICU space. 

But long? Trash website, article basically single paragraph. Even better then..it stay inside us unknown anounts time perhaps good re-emerge every time immune system becomes compromised. Im way saying I'm correct one OPINION, point I'd prefer ppl talking realistic possibilities instead nay saying news want hear. need ppl taking seriously possible least unknown known ppl wear masks social distance blanket articles warm fuzzy optimism helps perpetuate compliancy turn almost certainly cause deaths. want server home, definitely go Ubuntu Debian. Couple things. First off, need doctor’s note get tested Phoenix. It’s hard.

Bigger picture, get you’re saying 33% representative much general population covid. fact we’re testing people doctor’s note inflates percent. What’s scary percent growing much.

As continue expand testing, would want see percent positive declining. Even number cases going up, decrease percent positive would give indication virus less prevalent. Instead seeing dramatic increases both. really nation selfish blind people :/ China tremendous amount contain virus... even humane extent, shouldn’t scapegoated global situation today.  US months opportunity contain virus, hardly much tested people defective testing kits “containment” still realistic goalpost along way. USA mig testing individual states going paying WH moves pull Federal funding.

(in mods label political) Guy's vying first place New Epicenter race. Protests riots anyone? Yes Canada almost influential one state America. cool. Lucky prime minister recognizes right moves comes covid.  California reported **6,000 new cases** yesterday beating previous record 4,500. Shit's getting bad ... again. Husband Hungarian citizen? Hungary allows family members citizens travel country, keep 14 days quarantine. Also allows permanent residents in. if/when second wave comes fall/winter, think countries choose lockdown again? can't see happening (even though safer/smarter move) Economy first! Let's stretch could 3 4 week total national shutdown indefinate clusterfuck death! Winter going scary called 3 months ago. next step plan delete statistics together zero cases whole time. Spain fucked badly many ways still made somewhat coordinated effort stop spread I've seen. Italy got hit hard first country outside China well prepared. know quite things wrong seriously ill patients treated. way guinea pigs treating COVID. hospitals also overrun. *The key difference however current situation trajectory.* Perhaps keep celebrating Halloween. Lol

They gonna ban eastern Europe UK too? Europe tent Trump approach, Europe healthcare education I'd surprised either impacted mandatory 2 week isolation period... Parisian food deliveries two weeks sounds like good way acclimatise. Exactly it’s definitely cum, bum. like you. See: Australia. Also resource powerhouse comparable population. Similar GDP course, bordering anyone.

Also USA relies cheap Canadian resources, especially oil. Lumber, Dairy, Uranium, Crude Oil, Aluminum, sorts resources sold American economy. besides, Canada similar state California, arguably one influential Union often used define prosperous west. Yes, also spotted key similarity: large crowded gatherings. know. Never to, yet. logical so. Countries get cases tens, reopen slower. Nobody telling halt process, slow down. matter stance countries like China is, regarding numbers, know take measures quickly, same. hits 100% death rate going hopefully wake people up. Wha? kill everyone refused give power... Eh? MERS Cov mainly spreads animal human (from mostly infected dromedary camels- i.e. camels 1 hump). Human human transmission happen close contact settings rare there's never sustained community transmission. forget ride vehicle one party. wipe done guests.

That's going decrease ride capacity. Pretty sure health experts said “don’t gather large crowds”  whole point lockdown bring case levels manageable level, KEEP social distancing restrictions, contact tracing testing. part memo seems lost dear leader. Three months lockdowns economic hardship wasted without necessary mitigation strategiesz going Nijmegen august plan worked nicely Spain. fair, effective mask, harder breathe in.  might slight asthma lung deficiency doesn’t notice normal life, really fucks wear proper mask.  happens mask on, she’ll think it’s mask.

Yeah... think people believe science even know exponential growth is? Someone willing marry junkie train wreck. boat. expect EU travellers might able enter US somewhat soon situation stays control Europe. Might quarantine arrive states that's better nothing suppose.

Disneyworld sales plenty enough, they’ve closed months, ticket sales good thing, counting sea deniers go badge pride. 
Start getting real people Stay strong India. let get straight - says he's going reduce testing, team representatives say total opposite, testing gets reduced. crossed line dictator territory? I’d school anything I’d say would go head since clearly basics beyond comprehension. 

Oh, stat source skewed biased. that’s well known financial sector. take stats run models. It’s part living need modeling isn’t skewed since credibility company depends accurate forecasts, fast. doctor acclaim, access state art hair plug procedures. Procedures would blow mind. Ask Trump. Taking tad personally, aren’t we? think harsh dictatorships right, least repressive feedback mechanisms exist them. 


In USA, little repercussions all. Provided offend corporations, lose election, simply get nice cushy 7 figure lobbying job try need suits you. man knows he's doing, people would listen. true. Plus people use confirmation bias. actually research sides issue. They've already made minds want admit wrong EU country different set exceptions non EU residents. Eu country talk about? communicate state institution school? Vote, vote, vote guys
It’s country take back!
Vote anti science, vote anti education.  Schools fall breeding ground virus, especially larger schools. cannot expect children wear masks day, stay apart. Absolutely. 

We commonly say diseases mutate less lethal contagious. truth contagious matters. less lethal usually helps that, covid mortality already low enough matter. able avoid current tests probably mutation would matter, help long. Custardfuck. Mexico turned good idea. works long intra party corruption become severe. exactly Mexico's problem. Aussie here, thing wasn’t taught school almost incomprehensible loss Russian lives WW2.  Definitely worth google.  There’s also good YouTube graphics topic. NYC also highest population country compact. comparable also factor influx foriegn travelers daily basis (before news hit global pandemic). know. watch friend loss claims bs left right. protest..... dont talk much anymore get early enough, bummer give huge fuck.

And wear it. choice. problem hope gone forever Yeah you’re right. cigarettes analogy good one. Crazy think people adopting seatbelts ‘muh freedoms’ like 20 years ago I'm Hawaii, pleaseeee let people mainland come again. tourism focus Asian countries need tourist money bad. They'll wear mask lower rates now. false positive rate PCR tests? That's two Chinese vaccines tested.  9/11. forget building 7 happen seldom. Inherited monarchy really bad idea. Usually children great men fall short grow without reality grip golden palace. Even means intelligence use simply live reality disortion field. 

I think best leaders want it, take helm necessity situation. found way yet find choose them. Usually mankind elects shit hit fan. don’t seem long-term long distance relationship like then. I’m German girlfriend American. planned move Germany summer looks like won’t happen. that, haven’t seen person since January reading news learned might see person god knows when.

But thank mocking comment. absolutely true. EU law special case international law, different national law. part regulations implemented members legislative bodies. Also EU sovereignty, members do.

&amp;#x200B;

Germany pretty good comparison real difference initial response southern northern states (with German south considerably rational forward thinking \[I say entirely unbiased Bavarian\]). start hurricane season. FUCK! Standing Houston taking least 8 days get numbers. Assuming antibodies stick around, game annual immunization. hope works well enough allow normalization life ability safe travel. Personally, decided today COVID going around developing long term plan four year cycle issues economy, quarantine, limited travel. way mitigating sense disappointment lasts. flu? get recover it. still get month later. Granted immunity might worn virus mutated. 

How common cold ? thing. get it. recover it. still get again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Point Corvid still new. San Franciscan’s right ya, brother. definitely promising. can't blame little surprise EU would enact ban, reason self-preservation, given much they've sacrificed bring Covid-19 mostly manageable levels. wears mask Thanksgiving? Hey American married German. get Apostille embassy/consulate? didnt know needed this, yikes. positivity rate going up? Shouldn’t go testing? give Andrew Cuomo NY credit; shut everything hard. appears worked.

&amp;#x200B;

As long people keep following guidelines... Right, spouting shit reason, conflating everyone tries engage dumb idiots can't possible hold dissenting opinion merit.

Please take time reflect interaction, same. great day :) Conversely, remember covid patients ICU often stay weeks. max capacity good know, really throughput latency dominate whether hospital system handle volume. Infections would start tapering soon stop acceleration intakes weeks now. don’t see happening unless people change behavior rapidly, hopefully will. doesnt seem true source lasting whole lives?

Every peer reviewed study I've seen says damage always completely reversible. bear pepper spray :( F Reworked motto - ""Work hard. cough? history"" So, since leadership going ignore surge COViD19 cases going ignore drop business well?

Honestly, think going happen here?? Total normal capacity number ICU beds typically exist TMC. Anything line surge capacity, feasible advisable. graph indicate typical occupancy.  pull sample statistically representative larger population high confidence intervals statistical analysis somewhere around 100 people depending particulars. analysis would apply population large.

Depending details, statistical studies could high confidence intervals results allow 30 different people.

Large statistical sample sets usually result extreme overfitting data, making conclusion make really applicable. 

So yeah, OP idea statistical studies sampling works.  schist. necessarily go back lockdown. Cases spiking many people wearing masks. wearing covering noses. simply mandated properly worn masks, would problems debates. mind-bending millions people told masks infringement rights, virus hoax exaggerated threat. deadly narrative become one tragedies era. much preventable death collateral damage. boggles mind. Well new cases spiking across half US states, so... idiot president GOP made political. I'd rather pay every 2 4 years.

It's like anyone's retesting old people anyway. Rural areas care least think overblown

People live areas already fairly socially distanced interact hundreds people per day think social distancing measures silly. 

I grew South Carolina. Rural folk get mighty claustrophobic packed city environment. left wing media isnt? hahaha. specifically used phrase manufacture consent. obviously youre familiar chomskys work. acting like one side guilty? ridiculous would offer? expiring contract, financial considerations, player named later? Yay!!! Wonder third got gonerrhea? cases spike? again? right.

LA County: people/sq mi

New York City: mi School districts itching reopen schools. Need Uncle Sugar testing result subsidies programming kids knowing they're allowed. played across country fall greed. dangerously naive China banning imports foreign meat processing plants experience outbreaks pretty damning evidence fecal-oral transmission. Yea generous there. good, live 24h home become alchoolic junkie parents can't watch might good hiding it, give that. still see failing parenting cause good parent taught kid use drugs drink responsably , still also know social pressure, accepted big factors consider, still, excuse make kid much overweight age putting food table? become obese overnight nobody watching. That's people eating indoors without masks. Right.

what makes think that's outrageous concept? i'm area that's become hot spot county virtually active protests, numbers shot roof neighboring state university kids bar-hopping partying. expect spikes. common sense would say otherwise Yay!!!!!! Can’t wait vaccine approved (and eventually multiple vaccines) live alone I’ve stayed inside except groceries since March. birthday tomorrow I’d love go hair salon dermatologist feel slightly good something sitting home alone depression ocd, forever. I’d also like see psychiatrist I’m sure I’d able online.
I don’t think things would ethical though? along CDC botching testing adequate testing actually identify cases isolate them. Instead isolate everyone. crippled economy wasnt even effective. many people think gonna test on, enough prove safer young people virus?
Remember, virus kill probably 1 5,000-10,000 people 40. vaccine study would need tens thousands study *exposed* virus prove safer getting covid, means likely hundreds thousands *in* study.

All news I'm reading vaccine trials, larges 10k people tops. thought makes 🤮. Understandable. 100% alone isn’t red flag. It’s 100% China. people fabricated data whole pandemic. obviously anecdotal, see changes mask order. places high compliance, don't, before. gets throw Cuomo jail introducing coronavirus nursing homes? relate. family Oklahoma still either. refusing wear mask even living parents 60s 70s

Friends back home are. talk sense them. 

It's sad, know? something help lessen spread deadly virus controversial? Sometime feels insane think interesting see places see surges cases since reopening states case numbers remained flat declined. sure why. masks? places closer herd immunity? knows.  Think missed main point argument. Ironic Obesity sucks Nah. could nothing. Maybe 600k would die us. We'd probably know 1 2 them, maybe 1 20 us would lose someone close us 5 15 years earlier otherwise would have. things would go back normal. WWIl we'd done nothing fucking nazis would taken world. ^nice Oh God Jerry! People's virus! People's virus! really need hurry &amp; stop testing problem go away. don’t know else tell you. 

A sample size 1000 adults generally considered quite adequate American public. legs lower back killing weeks ago, sleeping 13 hours day still tired. normally rollerblade, one day, almost passed so, that’s really knew sick. Sneezing going bathroom every 30 minutes. Sense smell dimmed taste changed. didn’t leave apartment long time (today first day). muscle pain fatigue worst part. 

Practically cough fever. idea it. dismissive didn’t fever cough. Maybe did. got druggies woodland hermits, inbreds, chief mention 4th July coming up. beaches beach towns (PB/OB/La Jolla) PACKED people coming here. Lots folks Arizona come Summer too. build come also reported Italy. Sweden's death rate also dropping continuously.

So could virus mutated les erm virulent.  Remember months ago saying affected since already (??) bad east coast? 9 years ago irony lost me. I’ve self quarantined 14 days safe! real, sub LIVES misery would say told country opened schools two weeks ago opening businesses places gathering we've gone 30 000 cases 100 000 cases month? Stunning it. South Africa next Brazil. wait it. relative says virus real feel like hero working grocery store. told dont feel like hero feel like pig led slaughter people like him. people cant admit they're wrong early double idiocracy. 🤦‍♂️ Man ignores science, gets sick 

You dumb US weird. places like Arizona buy gun pants. places US go like 10 months background checks paperwork get license conceal gun, even guaranteed get it. looking American's infection, soon, people botched something. I'm looking nation wide perhaps different locally lady friend doctor cover 2 doctors might contracted covid19 week they're ruled out. 

We get it. Texas bedssss. going find staff cover surges? Indichina? 'Murica? work public business center SC required everyone wear masks. faced much backlash forcing public wear masks rescinded mask requirements next day. 15% employees tested positive. Thank you, terrible. worry it’s seems though  Spring training Florida Arizona? Well, go well. mean - got point. *\*Sigh\** really weird, it’s like he’s giving teaser trailer new movie. can’t good he’s trying tell people brace numbers get released. Wtf read? Pls tell clickbait 18. Let's say reach part family 4. That's 72 people exposed directly. people work? Take care sick relatives? That's even exposed.

This selfishness greed.

I'm scared think many daycares might this.

Can sued hiding this? party human life. thing really test entire family covid regularly, every 2 3 weeks. Friend's sister who's rheumatologist hospital middle-line says gets tested every 3 weeks, based facility's infection control board recommends. option ask brother move live friends sees. Banishment tough choice really want protect elders caught rock &amp; hard place. Northern VA? could waited couple weeks honest. Things boiling point protests bound happen, Floyd killed couple weeks later, incited protests, likely would better situation virus wise here. sure. “long haulers” thing covid positive sub concern right now. Given virus fucks peoples heads, I’m concerned people beat virus symptoms real purely mental.

As fatigue brain fog, that’s common regular respiratory viruses it’s nothing worried hospitalization rate around 5%? drinking game this. masks become mandatory AZ. fine citizens do? Organized mask day, go without masks disobey mandate. I’m upset State people handling this. Yeah, except they'll kill lot regular people happens.  Korea, around 30% tested kept testing positive 1-2 months. almost tested negative that. Two months long haul. 

I suspect know months. current administration actually encourage this. another lockdown even cases spike. many boomers gone, pay less social security benefits... live outskirts Houston say 100% correct I'm definitely scared case compatible world view. Yep, even getz cruz. bar pretty low. Went back looked English, since someone pointed German. 

100% sero conversion seem like red flag, however MMR vaccine 99% conversion rubella, 95/96% measles mumps.

It's likely sample size issue there. say many group 100% conversion. small enough conceivable chance drew ""lucky"" bag non responders. get extreme levels response possible.

SoCal pretty big, know?

2. Hospitalizations typically lag infections least week, would know.

3. issue ICU utilization arises time increased hospitalizations, people Covid tend stay ICU longer.

Which say that, good hear still plenty ICU beds SoCal, mean things get significantly worse. see comment every week, doesn’t get better, it’s never “shitshow”

*cue downvotes* Okay, didnt know would stubbornly block attempt morph conversation something might give readers useful information legal basis defending constitutionality quarantine laws. bad, really? There’s situation going forward sudden cult decides virus approached respect science correct course. Zero. triple “it’s flu, bro” elders die. It’s asinine burry head resort attacking others stating obvious unavoidable path. Trump said it: virus wash us. Many needed die. That’s path. is. Similar Canada, early projections showed overwhelming hospital capacity 2 weeks time (that absolutely terrifying press conference provincial PM). went hard hit ""best case scenario"". definitely New Zealand level OK well way good recovery. ignoring fact outdoor transmission almost nil versus indoor transmission?

[McKee said doctors believe virus went dormant first round coronavirus, annoying shit rest us talking since March. Make norm. Start listening doctors, scientists opinions orange reality show hosts tell bring light inside body. Stuff like that. recorded striking 5,019 new cases Monday -- topping state's daily case record fourth time past week. Florida, officials announced 3,289 confirmations day. Arizona saw 3,591 new cases day. Texas, health authorities said new cases hospitalizations rising fastest rate yet -- rate Gov. Greg Abbott called ""unacceptable."" state reported 5,000 cases single day, breaking previous among 26 states -- number also rise -- seeing new cases increase compared previous week. run servers :( I'm one 'economy first' people, said, believe evidence supports full lockdown, however, likely lead severe harm social problems. sensible policy package opinion would (1) Mandatory isolation at-risk populations, elderly disabilities. Ensuring social services, food, medical care necessary cost (2) legally mandate social distancing virus prevention non-isolated population, including gloves facemasks (3) dissuade non-essential travel provide employees legal right work home duration emergency.

In opinion would allowed economic activity continue, also saving lives.  1) Nobody thought Trump stopping (mostly white) Europeans traveling US racist.

2) Trump criticized way it. didn’t even give European allies heads up...they read press

3) fact excludes UK ban time virus known active UK makes look political.

On top trump racist (but nothing banning EU travel). ER/ED different ICU. Nobody set ventilator Emergency room. get Nurse ICU. went ER broken collarbone even see doctor nurse. ever caught cold twice year? Maybe spring fall? That's virus immunity wears off. also coronavirus. glasses probably make big difference r/Masks4All Oh Dan Patrick tell everyone die. Okay, fuck trying morph conversation something might give readers useful information legal basis defending constitutionality quarantine laws. I'll never forget day. day CDC reversed recommendations mask, April 3rd. elated. Trump go tell people news. goes: ""I want emphasize recommendation, wearing one"".  


I actually FELT heart sank. It'll sound like exaggeration care. happened. knew fucked meant were. dude reading much Epoch Times.

They've debunked they're literally funded cult + CIA money manufacture consent. Protests seem Yeah. They're gonna learn hard way. consider good news. media medical directors swearing we’d astronomical jump cases protests yet didn’t happen. Oh, theres driver wheel. refuses drive blames passengers steering. Ban everyone living Britain well. Boris easing lockdown early. matter narrative everything. sub made seem like ICUS filling brim COVID19 cases isnt. No, I’m Detroit currently, helped nurse staffing. 

And commenter, make masks political - it’s even close majority... turn news. people don’t feel like need/want self-centered egos go beyond they’d vote for. think know enough yet say herd immunity can't happen. long-term immunity possible, would need vaccination repeatedly maintain immunity. fact *don't* know sure make us even careful. girlfriends sister restaurant manager Contract says cant :/ distribution without flaws though.

You clearly little knowledge vaccinations developed havent followed news. Firstly vaccinations take years develop disease need prevent. Even decades research HIV vaccine isnt available behaves human body. follow point, human testing vaccine already started Oxford May. However, doesnt mean work. clear I’m BLM movement. statistical argument making identical Denmark vs US one. Denmark higher death percentage similar saying African Americans 2.5 times likely killed police. argument response fact totals isn’t great tool measuring either. used example total amount killed whites higher blacks. obviously doesn’t tell whole story total white population far higher black. Basically trying prove wrong I’m guessing inadvertently confirmed bias. Positive rate representative sample population. higher reasons get tested increase probability virus. biased sampling regime. 1.9% positive could 0.05% population infected. 

If people protested higher positive rate people encouraged tests symptoms known contact paint good picture. funny, time always put pressure United States, seemed trying protect markets matter much denial took.

But that's everyone else, China Australia Mongolia Italy, already acting like pandemic figure taking long. agree though, shameful. individual state point. leave masks car.

Normally watch John Oliver trevor noah.

I watch Today 🙂 Thanks lot! Children far fewer viral receptors nasopharyngeal mucosa compared adults. means need much higher viral dose (""viral inoculum"") trigger significant infection. Think like child's throat like Teflon virus - little virus sticks. Adult throats stickier - older person, stickier throat meaning even small viral dose quickly result high viral load. reading recent paper, proposed child's exposure virus normally eliminated local mucosal innate immune response generates IgA antibodies. Generally means little symptoms. thought similar mechanism exists bats.

Having fewer receptors nasopharyngeal mucosa also means children weak viral shedders much less likely transmit others. Adults however vulnerable infection children children.

Earlier tests, better information, all, better working environment general. healthcare professionals want decision makers, according new research report pandemic's first time.

Erika Wall, sociologist Mid Sweden University, published partial report nursing staff experienced work situation first, many ways stressful, weeks pandemic. sub-study focuses staff wants convey decision makers based experience.


- expressed need improved working conditions working environment. message everyone see heavy work done is, happening pandemic. surprised raised general problems consistently, even though question specifically asked pandemic, says Erika Wall.
Lack information

33 nurses, nurses doctors around Sweden deeply interviewed research study, Care Focus previously mentioned .

The health care staff emphasizes need resources healthcare sector whole, concrete shortcomings pandemic also highlighted. staff testifies, example, concerns defective protective equipment unclear information.


- Much unclear protective equipment beginning, defined infection pandemic. Another part information, could reach staff several directions, could different. created uncertainty.

#Should tested healthcare

A broader test covid infection healthcare staff performed earlier, several study think. fact staff could know sick colleagues cold affected covid-19 created several problems, least within working groups.

- described management saw absence due illness refusal work. someone ill came back also concern infection ward. questions expressed staff's strongest feelings investigation.


#Poor support future concerns


Those interviewed also talked positive experiences work, quick decision-making really matters. time, staff expressed concern future.


- Several pointed crisis management built care system, part works. concerned endurance long-term conditions queues formed, example.


The staff's need support also became clear study, according Erika Wall. conditions getting worse.


- feel time seek support high workload.

#""No one listened""

According Erika Wall, message survey clear - healthcare staff wants resources care care. Something mentioned long time, someone listening. One participants puts way:


“So, worked ten years emergency care. said time, cannot dismantle conditions way, one listened. sudden discover maybe good idea. "" You’re dumb. stance taking. think US lock again. create biggest clusterfuck ever seen. close businesses nationwide lockdown, rolling lockdowns areas especially hard hit. everyone know unenforceable, one comply. furlough government employees, protect them, rest us, everyone carry normal, unless need government assistance, records check, non-emergent court hearing, permit, secretary state, name it. think countries absolutely lockdown again, US simply won't. half-measures, work, lot people die, everyone position power shrug say , ""Welp, tried, but, ya know, economy."" city riots big protests take seriously. don’t, extremely privileged working front lines time. hope going Wendy’s drive help people working reducing people come contact even 1 person. 

I hope staying safe right sister literally quoted “my mental health important staying home pandemic”. mental health she’s inviting everyone sand volleyball cookout I’m like naw I’m good fam. Frustrating say least. feel like keep running SpOngEbOb meme people constantly. 

I young family seriously contemplating leaving country. I’ve never felt way before. He's talking communities like immokalee. [here's article explains lot better overwhelmingly latino, entire place basically huge projects type thing nearly everyone poor nearly everyone works tomato farm. I'm sure actually like resources available process shitload tomatoes there. I'm sure company got people what, like 96% Latino Haitian, like 17% community Haitian rest Latino. Sounds like they're mostly first gen immigrants. 

We similar communities Florida workers travel old school buses pick watermelons. 

Anyway, infection rate immokalee astoundingly high nature environment working conditions. like 5% increasing daily. population ~25k. I'm sure spreading immokalee not. HIPAA reason can’t get footage inside hospitals, also can’t release names dead. NYC's bureaucracy vast, de Blasio (NYC's mayor) complete idiot actually told people go celebrate St. Patrick's Day drinking bars get shut (New York State's governor, Andrew Cuomo, issued shutdown orders shortly de Blasio's statement), etc. New York responded well, shit hit fan, primarily Cuomo. De Blasio, much.

If recall, transfer responsibility public hospital system away Dept. Health, political infighting. think city's health commissioner threatened resign de Blasio acting stupidly (e.g., St. Patrick's Day stuff) eventually got frozen mayor. threat announced start. thats likely happen usa, brazil, russia, uk, etc. (places acted late little reopening). people ignored consequences. basically guaranteed thousands die US last weeks exposure. we'll see extreme jumps cases. virus anything do, 3 week delay includes protests (on sides), reopening states, riots, etc. count 3 weeks see explode. (which around week next) Symptomatic people, opposed symptoms swab taken informed contact another positive person recent past, got tested safe. coming scientist, pretty stupid.

Cherry top, said even get tested still come work show symptoms. Preventive infected? think agree important question would **""Why Federal Government renewing support five states initial ""contract"" ends 30th?**

Helmet usage still voluntary here. End Mickey Mouse number cases number watch. going testing (still enough, more). numbers look hospitalizations deaths. going states others. Honestly, whole world ban US travelers. We’re danger everyone else. know would cause problems, that’s bed government made need sleep it.

Personally wouldn’t it. Someone else mentioned someone virus may temperature show symptoms, precautions sound nice... doesn’t really hold up. mention thought working mask doesn’t sound appealing. work home even park think would best option right now. Sad know countries already hate actions president. oh see, mean ""worlds first inactivated vaccine"", Oxford vaccine simian adenovirus carrier, different type vaccine. Exactly. Without contact tracing, know causing infections. So, know safe open bars not, example. know opening bars causing it, something else.

That's sad. Hope get well soon! COVID-19 knows *exactly* doing. I'm expecting absolute bare minimum effort biggest life event someones life. Fortunately, everyone wearing masks super easy solution one problem doi-- 

*Looks country I'm in.* 

.... fuck. Fat = choice. paid price. Don’t fat ICUs operate around 80% due scheduled surgeries. don’t create wards run half occupancy. I’m sure gets dire (so certain percentage), reschedule surgeries.

By way, know number is? percentage? pretty low. LOL, I'd surprised number Texas even 25%. even bother models like this. going happen.  mom’s boyfriend electrician working one major 24 hour news networks US, exactly do. Oregon. Unfortunately, dont see person school happen safely. Even ideas district floating around sound depressing AF (one ball per kid sharing).

Honestly, dont feel safe sending school fall isnt vaccine. 5 yr old habit touching/rubbing mouth. Kids age pass stuff around classrooms basically petri dishes. could see 5th graders mature enough follow instructions safe practices kid? shot 58% Americans wash hands taking shit. way even come close 95% people wearing masks.

Source: Live state dipshit running it. New records cases every day now. (Citation needed) Yup - PTSD!!! much better.

* Cases testing up. put better, abysmally low before.

* We're upswing lockdown easing, deaths lag cases ~2 weeks.

I assume treatments getting somewhat better, think big difference. correct. advanced ICU patients ventilators, nurse manage two patients time. patient dialysis maybe case covid patient, one nurse per patient. ICU nurses also require specific training ICU patients super fragile cocktail drugs machines keep heart alive keep breathing. patients also need round clock care assistants cannot bathe, go bathroom feed themselves.

Being ICU nurse also stressful ICU patients often verge death require round clock monitoring shifts 12 hour. basically issue enough beds available also enough qualified trained staff available.

I learned last year dad died heart failure. took whole team nurses, physical therapists, respiratory therapists doctors give fighting chance. ventilator dialysis. already staffing issues finding qualified nurse covid really worrying numbers escalating fast. I'm Houston really well quarantine lifted. fucked. went lockdown really first wave never ended. don’t political money need reopen deaths increasing fucked.  extremely dangerous democracy extra expense 116B per month (thats calculated based online data, seems low) wont help stimulate economy though. Thats lot extra government debt 3-6 months. American, claiming masks give CO2 poisoning, Corona democratic hoax sink ourr economy make Trump lose next election. also lose sleep thinking 5g nano bots Bill Gates forcefully inject forced get Covid vaccine. flag good news? Okay. draw conclusions? happened Trump's silent ""majority"" generally lockdown? sad part shitty president pandemic Except given timeframes, flu actually killed people, I'm sure Fauci aware that. also one people comparing flu. People get new information use improve already know.... idea temporary not. Hey, may even end accurate trend may fact continue decreasing hope does. However, considering many recent indicators outbreaks new regions hospitals (there two last two days southern Sweden) may reflective trend reversing direction. 

Whatever happens, fact trend line stopped going edging upwards. Trump care actually disappears not. doesn’t even care it’s killing people Fall Winter. wants able get campaign trail say, great job, won.” 

He willing kill people make happen. try internalize fact he’s willing kill *you*. Maybe stop spreading conspiracies capacity ICUs usually operate at? local one typical 80% capacity solely due scheduled surgeries. believe title bit click bait majority comments reflective lack reading actual source, objective thinking. ""Ha haaaa"" - Nelson Muntz two hours. LA , Bexar Travis county yet big come around hour go. would thought Homeland Security says increases humidity would *decrease* viral half life Bruh 65% point every country ban travel america seriously want cases canada  don’t want give impression companies didn’t take care people, lot done well. job choice classification screwed me.

But, hey, let's let airlines go fuck economy even harder vital service greatly reduced years.

Edit: But, yes, reward hostage takers killing hostages. 30 years vs. chair/life without parole. Thats reward me. I’m curious facility also handled out. wife work hospital told (literally every worker) exposed work go tested (usually two weeks) use PTO time go non paid. Also answer people don’t many hours go loan PTO pay back later. I'm Canadian. hear ya. virus proven beyond shadow doubt many people population straight stupid. Chicago weird. delivery instruction ""leave steps please send text"" since started 2 all.my deliveries done it. Everyone else calls tell leave steps sound surprised. Odd seeing younger people opposed normally ones support science emotional let's go outside work. 

Usually younger folks ones inclined go science. I'm 26 would fully say lockdown gets hand (assuming would keep stimulus afford food shelter going). Preachin' choir, dude. continue pay $800 week unemployed. welcome. get really annoying deeply dig days get facts story. Here's problem going back lockdown (in addition one): 

What assurances going give us work? going actually implement real lockdown, ""essential services still open"" BS, 14 days, eliminate virus entirety? going bunch half measures ensure never end lockdown cycle?  that’s Unconstitutional. Assuming loses Yeah, no. least don’t say metre. realize NYs peak bc know properly treat stuck patients nursing homes resulted 40% 50% NY Makes sense, lot mild cases FL found testing already ramped up.

In NY mild cases got laughed room tried get test, especially younger healthy people. 

I'm guessing peak NY probably around 25k cases day instead 10k  never know. world meters cut off? ""I can't afford choice"" response everyone understood used criticize forced work. got laid 80k year job. Highly skilled. Can’t find job right now. Employer told return work go back office. I’m unemployment $1200 week runs I’m going scrambling. Yup. There’s lag hospitalizations mix well. That’s cannot understand people see daily case numbers rising alarming rate, turn “well deaths going though”

Ummm... else sound like? politicians saying preparing hurricane sign weakness cause economic depression. 

I hope right, based I've seen, people concerned virus anymore. true. manufactured tested. approved fall, 100 million doses already available US Wow. Texas similar population Australia finds almost many cases one day total!

Keep safe people, things going get pretty rough next couple weeks. Lol oookay. makes total sense given provinces removing travel restrictions import cases. 

Furthermore, we've learned virus reacting work time try respond, late. effective approach proactive one: distance, hygiene, sanitation masks.

Look Japan. They're federal response lukewarm, nearly quadruple Canada's population packed like sardines, yet 1/5th total infections.

Japanese people wear masks. Imagine actually believing Chinese propaganda.

Option one. parliament disbanded. means everyone run reelection people elected likely elect people abolishthe monarchy. Unless parliament something outrageous thats covered Option 3.

Option two. parliament feels order goes idea free state abolishs monarchy instead. require people situation monarch acting like tyrant.

Option three. power used remove deadly unpopular dangerous people. monarch uses power remove surprise British hitler might able keep power.  don’t agree calls wear masks.

This line article essentially confirming Texas seeing second wave... never got first! banned mayor allow type lock down. American, fucking deserve this. response Covid laughable. I’ll voting well, end lockdown, pretty much every single person know, minus 2-3 liberal friends, voting third party try get 5% federal funding. Hillary voters last election, watching dnc Bernie won’t supporting time. Democracy great isn’t it! That’s false, research would know it’s nowhere near 5x. fake news spread around social media using manipulated data Yes! Laughing hard this! BC, think got lucky handling well.

Lucky spring break little later back east also sizeable Chinese population Vancouver saw lot social distancing early late January.

Deaths: 1,223

I'd take number grain salt though, Sweden one best public health care systems world, seems odd fatality rate much higher population cases almost identical. I'd say maybe sunshine &amp; Vitamin D, could see trend warmer climates.

&amp;#x200B;

however, point frankly US better EU countries

Sweden ignored pandemic, Trump style, expect, basically mistake, would better outcome? Italy head start. France seemed bad time too. GB EU. 

Other that, majority countries EU much, much better job US.

Lol, virus deadly enough warrant measures prevent unnecessary death, unfortunately. think you’re right it’s extremely hypocritical defend protests demonizing gatherings, there’s lot going on. anything highlighted people like selectively acknowledge virus, it’s that.

But doesn’t change fact freedom movement absolute, right absolute. doesn’t change fact protests wouldn’t occurred level state governments hadn’t already eager reopen declare virus over.

If ebola outbreak spreading, bet there’d lockdowns punishment breaking it. populace thinks disease isn’t deadly *enough* warrant it, government still responsibility protect weakest citizens. flu, despite attempts frame like that. death toll alone enough prove that.

Anybody source text advisory? news stories short specifics. 

For example, weeks ago, Florida issued quarantine mandate applied visited tri-state area. sounds like includes entire state, Buffalo restricted NYC. It’s happening speak- lack response made education unsafe. Americans looking entire generation may educated solely desire parents. end well.

It would avoided proper planning. didn’t want that. It’s criminal negligence. California also population 41 million. It’s great they’re seeing increase, situation isn’t dire Texas (30 million), Florida (21 million) Arizona (7 million). yeah, wrong. Sounds like 100%+ UI+CARES norm. Im surprised people paying rent. Already happened me.  need kill citizens stop pandemic, failed governing body replaced. functional, we're broken country.

EDIT: Mutation hybridization occur naturally depending length pandemic along absolute number people infected. right mutation hybridization could result deadly strain.

Something noticed take ratio daily cases/deaths, start seeing ratio increase around mid-May protests began. Basically right protests, deaths started going even though cases stayed steady. Maybe simplest explanation weather turned nice, young people started going Might want include /s tag. saw immediately it’s tougher tougher tell days somehow morons taking stance 100% seriously unironically getting information? listened data report. Nearly everyone answered phone, difficulty getting honest answers people  Calm True, live corona cases, went hard, took seriously cases business back open decent trade. Goodbye two year contract Prague :( 2020 foreseeable future cancelled US can’t get it’s shot together. I’m MN it’s fine want better still. Aw thank you, comment work!! Stay safe. Sending lots virtual high fives gratitude way!  You’re right, testing Mexico incredibly low. doctors reported 1 10 patients symptoms get tested, that’s mortality rate high is. probably 2 million mark infections now, don’t think get better given government agenda neither testing masks work. Scary stuff happening :( Probably another bail out. able use information get flight postponed/cancelled? Americans going shitter.

The first world countries seem virus control. *reads comment*

*looks username*

Nice. seemed miss entire point comment.  obviously axe grind.... get colleges wanted north east something? wife well 4 tennis players attended tournament. wife also antivax. sad see people reject science common sense personal beliefs. organised event critised reckless felt knew better went ahead put place social distancing rules. much influence masses send bad message. United States existed vacuum sure. cities around world far fewer deaths. look Tokyo:

Population 9.2 million
Deaths: 323

Far dense population far less deaths. logic “can’t helped” far dense population New York fairing far better? He's removing 7 testing sites Texas right complaining Twitter numbers high we're much testing, would look better tested less. Yes, really Heck work Indiana bit right across border Chicago, last time checked couple weeks ago, second largest numbers state. Chicago better closed! want shit spreading south anywhere else Hoosier. city enough is. say I'm thankful Illinois looks like Indiana followed almost exactly 2 days later everything. Could've much worse didn't. u france Italy's economys expected crumble next 3-6 months united states recovered strongly. ridiculous. *Hispanics farmworkers* brazenly ignoring social distancing massive irresponsible crowds last 4 weeks, including 3,000 crammed shoulder shoulder Orlando. thought Avarcas/Menorquinas? 

They're pretty popular Spain. I'm pretty sure they're still burning backlog old ""suspicious deaths"" confirm. think couple days go back 400-600 range. vividly shows it’s important close lid flush!

Despite this, many public bathrooms don’t toilet lids. *hospital* work want Corona. Lol worried china. Even china managed get people chinese new year huuuge there
.. show studies said help?  speak French? Sorry, knee jerk reaction almost 1am. excuse clicking links though. think something multiple links multiple paragraphs see something like posted mind automatically files spot tends get ignored. Wow man sorry hear that. Stay positive possible can!

But yea man get frustrating knowing people seem care. Luckily us NYC area, really even choice thousands dying daily back epicenter days. need government stay home turns solid leadership makes world differnce.  

You'll pull bud. still fuck atmosphere US tenfold It’s pretty simple, people want hang friends family, things enjoy. lot people don’t think it’s worth give year stop virus spreading Washington already called dibs. Still, even without prior experience numbers arent even remotely similar. 

Numbers deaths **right now** irrelevant pandemic still ongoing. wait 2 3 weeks, see.

The numbers deaths states reopened early like FL, OK, AL soon way up, also numbers deaths nursing homes numbers go up... want make bet? AMA. Cause NYC stupid enough send infectious people back nursing homes. Texas that, thankfully. Hey least lining hallways. Yet.  goes! child polio ... 

Oh ""polio"" scare.

God, makes angry see maskless multitudes. 🙋‍♀️  I’m talking elderly. know, whole reason you’re trashing governor kept city united informed time chaos? done? Trump basically pushing herd immunity strategy without stating it.

They'll use ""herd immunity"" excuse last-resort. 

Their real motivation probably combination Putinist ""weaken American Empire longer threat Russian expansion plans"", ""make money others' suffering"". 

They neither know, care, ""herd immunity"" theoretically would cost many hundreds thousands lives. useful buzzword them. also neither know, care, virus, ""herd immunity"" probably unattainable human coronaviruses, well well-known viruses like HIV, HSV, HPV, influenza. (HIV example destroys immune system would eventually mechanism herd immunity, HSV example non-lethal virus 'hides' dormant body, there's vaccine, HPV would same, got vaccine, need universal administration get herd immunity, influenza example even vaccine, virus mutates frequently ""hides"" animal populations, can't eradicate even vaccination).

They care. want make money, stay in-power. problem Covid ICUs they're along time. There's really evidence we're going overwhelmed evictions. number people pay rent time May 2020 [was 2% higher May That's small increase. also late payments, complete defaults, people eventually end paying rent evicted. 

The moratoriums helpful helped avoid evictions economy totally shutdown, stimulus checks, unemployment benefits coming people getting back work economy reopened lot people able catch rent least work deal landlords allow catch up. seen massive increase evictions filed, personally influx calls people regarding COVID19 related evictions. much evidence going see mass evictions. 

And doubt many people safety net either. highly unlikely every single friend relative people evicted time nobody anywhere go. people simply shit together can't stable living situation even good times, system already built handle that. would overwhelm system massive influx normally hard working honest people fallen hard times COVID19 layoffs. fact matter people competent resourceful enough end making work out, whether utilizing benefits government, working deal landlord set payment plan going obtaining work opportunities available right now. 

There plenty people late rent hit, still yet see materialize massive wave evictions. Wilford Brimley entered chat. time people terrified go out, late.

We failed !earn 1918 pandemic. damn antimask crowd, damn muh freedom rallying cry.

We shall see places take seriously recover economically faster.

You provided article quickly pointed dated facts. provide relevant details. hating Canada Canadians, fact love country visited Mississauga many times. I'm also huge fan Corner Gas Kim's Convenience.  point many countries would love next tech hub even claim without even coming close approaching truth. Houston 4th largest city America. neighboring cities talking about? yet nobody seems really care. frustrating. Well can't imagine much anxiety would cause someone like physically unable breathe enough air due pneumonia lung scarring. Banks good property management they'd prefer work forbearance deals existing owners rather mass foreclosures. $1 million mortgage worth bank actually owning property, even mortgage payer late payments. HVAC idea intriguing, particularly places like theaters, since contaminated air circulation big concern. results released today include testing days? 

Is standard methodology releasing testing data?  really complex issue. really feel educators administrators make decisions.  Everyone school aged kids opinion impossible make everyone happy.

For now, kids' school district going try 2 options: distance learning home in-person. idea implemented. think best solution.

If everyone distance learn (DL):

\-What kids parents work (and young left home alone developmental disabilities)? Right many daycares open accommodate people essential jobs.

\-What kids internet access unreliable? internet outages son's high school DL thankfully able use cell phones personal hot spots. everyone afford this.

\-What kids special education need one one person learning? children receive therapy school also. son fortune private therapy open entire pandemic. Many kids received person therapy throughout pandemic.

There many unique situations even know about. really think two options available everyone. can't imagine logistical nightmare implementing though! waiting crisis contracts make another $50k. Yeah massively upvoted, mentioned could capacity within weeks. Today 97% thought worth noting weeks may little generous. Burden proof lies accuser Ha? states trying contain virus. horrified over-arching nation-wide strategy. Yeah, rise due people buying idea nothing worry about. risk folks stayed home, everyone wore masks social distanced, we'd probably fine, aren't. People going pools/beaches, refusing wear masks, politics. Everyone predicted we'd open shut going proven right. CERB 10 minute process. Something like 30% unemployment claims filed US processed yet due state state backlogs shoes, shirt, service yet arrogant narcissistic refusing wear masks yet daily see people packing gun hips protect going Walmart Lowe's. give up. Makes sense people stupid.  Go Virginia Go! that’s assuming immunity permanent, least long lasting. immunity lasts months, we’ll see wave wave infections vaccine produced. 

Imagine immunity short-lived whatever reason we’re unable develop vaccine. honestly think would push us collapse. government isn’t hiding cure

I concur, absurd never implied this. agree. don’t think ready open schools (my elementary school 1300 students one building plus 150 adults. hate say want go back anything! don’t think understand risk shared bathrooms a/c units. 

This assured district saying clean every night. good school day germs really fresh drifting around. hope I’ll still allowed transit London two weeks. I’m supposed board repatriation flight back current home country Heathrow, meanwhile, worried potential travel bans 🙏 Screw USA dipshits refuse wear masks. want go home 😩 virus make sense. random reaches critical mass. tested him, would counted..
We testing more, total positive... many places % positive increasing well, means testing enough catch rise. Funny, germany business tried skirt rules, too. ordnungsamt (Code Enforcement Officer  powers) stepped that, hard. shut businesses, levied steep fines heavy ground( deputized lots people closed city business like pools. feel like pretty regional NC. I'm Durham seen near ubiquitous mask usage grocery stores/Target last weeks (but county also masks mandatory, maybe that's difference).   weird part implying global pandemic valid reason ""fear"". nothing fear, need wear masks shut country first place. Good. Fuck em. absolutely amazing. dead Trump voters. us Europe closer fair.

OK... Let's see went zero almost 30,000 daily Mar 1 Apr 1, 8,000 daily May 1, tailing around 4,000 daily Jun 1.  actual ""wave"" shape, unfortunately go back zero, pretty darn good badly things got.

The US shot 32,000 daily late March mid-April, declined somewhat around 22,000 daily mid-May, started skyrocketing upward last couple weeks. current rate US suggests uncontrolled spread.

I find funny people willing risk lives fiat currency. That's repub moto, right? Cash kids? Money mother? yea, ""the economy collapsing"" definitely happen millions obviously die, right? Get line, millions already dying US shitty country. better mean .. right first Arizona health department Wednesday reported 79 new coronavirus deaths, single-day high, *but older incidents reclassified based information death certificates.* Even better would ran independent conservative general election.

different strokes buddy. people judge easily judging them. “ get shut down? “. 

Invite symptomatic people participate would start. Operating reduced rate equate mandatory shutdown select sectors economy. Even talking economic output, weren't, China operating 87% typical output May 12th. 

If trust number infections reported China sure numbers using make case?  mean, login ur cra account, navigate correct page, confirm ur eligible, u apply. someone says they're accident, they're probably lying. “100% open”? know, us could already mortality rate lower flu.

We already know that’s true. several antibody studies around world put mortality rate around 0.5-1.5%. Even hardest hit areas don’t 20-30% population immune. studies come conclusion. almost like reopening early wiped progress made. Huh. Imagine that. also ton people saying would millions...im least glad right. You’re genius Gallop's stay home numbers generally agrees quoted article. week Jun 8-14, Gallop 67% respondents replying best people say home. uptick 2% previous week. However trend line going since high 90% Mar 23-29. 

Also look people say actually doing, see people avoiding public places 56% high 79%.  people considering lock 31% low 8%.  *SARS-CoV-2 Likes This* People guessing 200k September couple weeks ago, 180,000 October move right direction.

There is. link showed. Please provide sources assertions. provided none Obviously since beginning outbreak country thousands deaths, nowhere near amount compared positive carriers never laboratory confirmed test.

They don’t amount. proportional percentage missed axiomatically similar. fact pull testing capacity pool ensures this. statistics 101.

I expect people get vaccine first, Trump's family friends.

Wouldn't terrible vaccine actually caused disease. /S first glance, one right looked like granny raised mid-50s trophy wife face lift. 

Yes, yikes. wait... claiming US worse LESS DENSE Europe? opposite explanation covid-deniers (it's NYC dense!)? ""ignorance, arrogance apathy"" stop talking way. ""Why schools Hercules military airplanes? ""  That's genuine question. cost maintaining system 30,000 days cost ramping emergency staffing support 100 days?

I know could answer would trust. media politicians, certainly. Silly peasant, replaceable. Dont understand Tommy's twelfth birthday next month dad cant yacht year sad? That's literally erasure AMERICAN DREAM We're breaking 40k today. Definitely going time high. maybe like different things you, fucking dick. Media sure seemed ignore rioters protestors though keeping social distancing. almost agenda here.... Why? competent leadership. since Jan 2017. fact, since then, charge actively trying kill US civilians. sickening. see people applauding Cuomo cases rapidly dropping worse hit area country month half ago. followers *never thought virus. Laughs canadian* Yeahhhhhh,we gonna go Halloween Haunted Night year,finally.We'll waiting too. Fuck know what's going Arizona. 

Last Wednesday governor renounced law making mask mandates illegal. Within day three many cities made mask mandates assume everyone saw meme recently depict well:

Everything fine! Please, keep American twitter memes continent, thank you, American culture infectious almost dangerous disease coronavirus. You’ve posted couple articles see. Could please future post link article google address? Thanks. Thank goodness give US taste medicine I'm sure they'll translate country's lowest unemployment rate since WWII something.

""If horses continue bolt like this, I'm going shut barn door."" someone replied said could get it, deleted comment, maybe can?

I don’t remember seeing pharmacies, girl program always asked bring some. 

I think it’s basically US often can’t go doctor, fairly strong counter drugs self medicate still go work. Whereas decent country you’d go doctor, they’d give prescription, could stay home work rest. Ah yes we’re divided literal separate fucking government whole war broke it! Genius! enough guy. I’m sure everyone blaming southern states california absolutely insane corona virus numbers. I’m saying Texas others aren’t poorly, Cali another level right now. Get shit together California Also they’re using wrong numbers flu, numbers flu PLUS pneumonia. Unless 5x many people died 2018-2019 average 2008-2015 less 5k people died per year flu. resurgence Spanish flu, 2009 H1N1 pandemic killed 13k people.

Their 34k number definitely flu + pneumonia. Pneumonia big killer, it’s everyone should’ve terrified said pneumonia minor symptom covid. YES. 

This insane. Three words: Never. Gonna. Happen. Abbott happy sacrifice thousands fellow citizens look brave tough virus. can't believe Texas voted bigger moron Perry governor, did. kids study abroad trip cancelled too. month. refunded money thou. totally bummed. Sweden outbreak earlier us. Looking new cases per day per capita well trend US still far worse. Technically, Germany also doesnt act federal level. state response albeit lot federal help guidance. enraged way around suggested NYers quarantined?

Sweden population 20 million hundred cases per day (that's still pretty bad though), trend least slowly going down.

US population 330 million 30000 cases per day increasing.

My initial guess factor 20 pulled ass far actually.

Both countries get isolated while... It’s fun game start harvesting organs. seen widespread reporting point. Occasionally article come someone tested positive virus earlier, tested negative, positive seems like there's always caveat think virus may dormant recieved false negative test. immunity lasted 2-3 months, basically every state would absolutely screwed point new cases old cases starting test positive again. would think see nothing 24/7 coverage absolute panic going right seem case. Holy crap 33% positive! but, they've increased testing! testing swear....cough, hack, ugh......... Anything 10% bad, 33% approaching NYC March levels bad.

""Transgenderism"" correct way speak transgender people, would say transgender people :) point national site states. check state individually. Someone CDC average American consumer trained think personal safety responsibility business patronizing. Wearing flip-flops ignoring safety warning signs, slip fall suddenly business' fault. goes Covid. many people wearing masks following social distancing guidelines, people supermarkets ignoring 1-way aisles, etc. far tell, nobody follows rules titles. Last time posted something putting date news articles, supposed let people know news ""news"" not. source date title follows:

CDC reports first US case - Reuters - Jan. 22, constantly updated

Join /r/worldnews livethread: medical advice: vigilant cautious reporting new developments facts please limit submissions 10/day. What’s deal that. read average Dutchman 3 4 inches taller rest Europe. think Utah we’re sitting 50-60% capacity expected reach capacity 4-8 weeks. governor would actually mandate masks could still course correction it’s late gov. Herbert seems pretty set ways wanting mandate masks. U.S. really fucked proven can't get infected sufficiently resentful angry YES.

I would add demilitarize police. two choices. Educate stop spreading bullshit 3rd party may actually chance. I'm voting either old, white, pedophile cronies. going shit going swing pendulum american politics further. Seems unlikely anti-commandeering doctrine. No, worse US is, bigger risk rest us. wonder proportions vary depending lockdown severity. China strong lockdown infection spreads it’s happening work one’s going work. may case everywhere. American, cant say blame them. get weed there, Ibuprofen...why not? second lock would need mandated. people terrified go out. Upton Sinclair's Jungle level shenanigans. Like, want work infected meat factory minimum wage? we've got millions unemployed Americans would love take place. could totally see companies selling assets laying workers stay afloat. Assets what's bank. positive possible can!

Phrasing! someone watched videos disappeared, lot cause scared back early February. many unknowns lethality, contagiousness, resistance, etc. information, see bad, nowhere bad worst case scenarios back (which seemed real time). legalized masks.

They illegal before? (e.g.) 90%+ children unvaccinated would indicate shot effect. stat useless without share vaccinated children.  Governments given go ahead production without consulting top experts assume countries producing vaccine positives first two phases trials . W getting result UK phase three trials next month . Let's wait . funding prematurely cut too, state didnt act like Texas federal government matter. Vision clear 2020. taking seriously. 

Not Buffalo, NY. fairness sustainable solution either. completely understand people's frustration months working little government help. aware any. you? Personally like idea ANYONE Orlando thinks Asian European tourists want come visit us anymore.. share travel desirability par Mogadishu moment.

These people.. delusional. know agree you. Rational people would understand nothing changed. vaccine. cure. effective set therapeutic protocol prevent stop cytokine storm severe symptoms. light that, best course action take reasonable precautionary measures- distancing facemasks. helps you. helps others. That’s simple yet people won’t hear it. Noses masks mask all. mandate masks get traction mask usage. 

People terrible this. 1248 days getting worse every day. even know I'm still alive point. (Not even kidding.) None applies, methanol based hand santizer, denatured ethanol based hand sanitizer. 

Denatured ethanol approximately 3% based manufacturer. stuff question 81%. 

Absorption rates look gram per use, whole lot methanol. economic stats using? ones SJW Marxist U? starters, US economy always grow 3% year. even average. Clearly big picture stats forte. doubled population last 50 years bulk came immigration, legal illegal. sustainable. yes, wages suppressed unchecked immigration (combined outsourcing) economic growth enough inflate wages since 1970s. Take propaganda shove ass. 

Unchecked immigration great owner class 95-99% population. wealth gap gotten big. racism white privilege whatever fake bullshit clueless wonders claim. movements like BLM really wanted improve lives brown black people US would fight mass immigration. It’s black brown people adversely affected mass immigration. NSW government willing undo work hardship endured allowing Victorians still fly Sydney Airport today? 

It’s irresponsible close NSW / Victorian boarder time, especially flying zero regard anyone themselves. It’s people like spreading Victoria. don’t want NSW.

Let bodies natural immune system work seem ridiculous you’d think so. you’re frankly bizarre though. Even bought idea trying protect mask supplies world would think sensible way it?

Additionally masks primarily catch droplets breath, avoid inhalation would require n95 masks. sorry. I'm you. Cheers! \*clink\* think look stupid, I'm lost gave idea administration chance handling well? genuine question.

For context, I'm Australia, live US, talking friends China things kicking late last year. immediate assessment US (specifically individual states) would refuse kind unified action would contain virus way China able to. feels like fundamental problem would presented regardless federal administration.

Lo behold, mid 2020 USA getting ass handed 'cause freedom important life, guess? Exactly! would walk right job putting health &amp; family's health jeopardy. can't understand anyone wouldn't, unless terrible financial position afraid find another job... I’m gonna go conservative estimate guess “horrific.” Sounds miraculous... quite literally fall Roman empire esque, citizens care anyone themselves. even Disney World. Universal, SeaWorld, Busch Gardens also open restrictions. Universal seems somewhat committed maintaining safety standards (such telling people wear masks), SeaWorld Busch Gardens Gardens really done I've heard/seen.

A Youtuber watch Florida theme park content constantly complained poor rules, people refusing follow physical distancing guidelines, even tell people wear masks noses. point, they're telling people stay home (like should). Yep - active cases dropping; they're dropping rather slowly. AFAIK similar graphs European countries show active cases drop much quickly, likely due stringent measures.

Our first days extremely bad. mean, deeply strange one way put it, there's point response pin 'we really done better', early days it. Even now, mention masks, lot half measures rarely enforced, that's still substantially better nothing all, least.  Yup mostly go tourist traps I'm pretty certain scared go anywhere nanny looking 😂 cheaper, no. $1200 cost somewhere north 100 *Billion*. May 12th: [Texas Governor says one needs wear mask, businesses provide employees, churches 

That age well. Yeah, 1.3 trillion part, sure over. There's political agenda though keep spiking testing pretend still issue. Cant catch viral disease wearing decent mask... congressional meeting looked like aged 10 years past several months respectfully disagree, part January early February, China's number infection cases way ahead every nations. saying embarrassing enough?

Funny since New Yorkers ones leaving helping states. reading comments I've changed opinion since others pointed out, could potentially avoided hoarding PPE losing public trust advising people wear home made masks, use scarves cover face etc. Thank you. amount fear mongering much. No. lunatics running asylum.  think 8.7 million miss diagnosed cases - country bandwidth necessary go back time investigate people may died cases due COVID?

You’re highly overestimating feasibility that. It’s far simple you’re making be. 

We still can’t get simple testing correct current state.

Of course one going fly middle country 2 week country bounce Europe... maybe will. still... Common sense would say point origin determine entry.

It’s response, really need drop ton links experts blaming US response COVID?

Yes, terrible leadership lead 100k dead Americans. dead fault, many could prevented. Exactly aware exponential growth works...thanks. said ""I hard time believing"" would happen happen. whether society works kind social style depends history country built on. like US work democracy china work authoritarianism.

changing either form mean abolishing foundation country, spending centuries recover reform, point time like make country weaker susceptible foreign attacks. Something i'd argue US happy see happen. live California. Literally I've done since February work home, drive markets &amp; couple drive thrus, go diving twice (both month 'the beaches opened'), buddy &amp; picked small beaches worse masks water, out. I've two friends different times mom over, exactly once, wore masks except eating 6' away other.

Tomorrow first time company office three months, work severely restricted office employees. give coworker training receive training need.

Some us done best. I'll admit, could even socially isolated. housemates good covid tests isolating, minor risk one guest time, every two months in? I'm going feel bad mental health perspective.

And leave house unless I'm mask.

I say, beach, outside shops, cars? never see damn soul mask, time noses mouths exposed. basic fucking shit can't even that. believe economy exists! made up! won’t fool ‘em, nothin Thats I've told 10 ppl city rn Fair enough. Ironic investigation ability quarantine 2014 said would fall state governments decide 10th amendment. 

Also, federal government important quarantine powers. section 361 Public Health Service Act, U.S. Secretary Health Human Services power take measures contain communicable diseases foreign countries United States states. 

A current example federal quarantine order related COVID-19 virus CDC website outlines many principles people “reasonably” suspected CDC exposure infection coronavirus. quarantined right medical review “to ask federal court review federal quarantine, including rights habeas review.”

So right review challenge potential quarantine rights would violated, fact seems constitution supports states rights impose said quarantine. 

Finally, post way enforce quarantine would would allowed first place.

I thought saying ways enforce would unconstitutional hence ? apply citizens living abroad?  Next step, build wall 49th parallel, Americans pay for. Turns placing unqualified sycophantic ideologues like Dr. Redfield charge CDC actually makes difference. I’m dependent boss wouldn’t call master. Wouldn’t expect cap get though seeing highly doubt you’ve ever knew like afraid losing job afraid boss. Must nice live delusional bubble. Probably got church Twitler held AZ rally. make claim?

Edit: isn’t dangerous common sense participating protest screaming 20k+ common sense. Hospital staff panic. panic surge. cried times, panic, no.

The rush ambulance bay saved nursing home dumps, really. alien ship closes Area 51, President Whitman (Donald Trump) saves day declaring emergency over. live paycheck paycheck difficult save weeks worth expenses much less 6 months someone dies, they're gonna investigate. seriously doubt significant amount deaths cases, probably mild counted killer answer.

And someone elevated temperature border (this driving in?)? Odd... cautious made sure daughter got vaccines. doctor office felt like safest place I’d date. I’m sending oldest soon too. 

I go doctor whose office hospital. one entry. Screened, temp taken, forced hand sanitizer, masks, directed exactly way needed go get office. felt incredibly safe. much safer store sure.

So people, don’t skip dr appointments. Safer shopping. do. Thanks. 

In seriousness, how’s father? hard make be? Worth far opinion? people die corona side world? Unless vote. lot Donald's supporters old. people risk dying COVID-19 old people. way Donald rest GOP convinced millions old people anti-American to, know, want live breathe easy astounding sad.

I guess surprising, though. GOP continues get throngs old people vote them, even though party keeps going way cut social security, Medicare, Medicaid, programs oldest vulnerable depend on.

This also party aggressively anti-regulation. Regulations cost wealthy industrialists lot money, [the benefits average citizens, like me, \[Office Management Budget\] gathered data analysis “major” federal regulations (those $100 million economic impact) 2006 2016, period includes Obama’s administration, stopping short Trump’s. final tally, reported 2001 dollars:  Aggregate benefits: $219 $695 billion  Aggregate costs: $59 $88 billion  even conservative estimate, benefits Obama’s regulations wildly outweighed costs.

Because GOP like average citizens benefit cost corporations executives, they've convinced voters regulations bad, dangerous, bold-faced lie.

The GOP masters convincing people vote well-being. Let introduce friend yours, exponential growth. virus doubling time five days, 50% capacity today, five days full. say r/aboringdystopia? Good. shouldnt spreading stupidity.  No. Everyone know supports protests also acknowledges increase covid cases result. Theres denial. understand benefits outweigh risks. can't said wanting hair cuts drink bars claiming real. hoax. wearing masks violation rights, etc.

Also, photos show protests wearing masks. top that, police confiscated mask donations protests would turned away protest mask. police actively ripped masks protesters could assault chemical weapons. people making other? 8 guys office got sick none family members got it. One guy asymptomatic antibodies wife them. None family members reported symptoms either. area almost local fireworks displays canceled. people pissed probably right call. Exactly Days may well minutes context case number explosions is, based current spike cases, blatantly untrue. everyone New York lives top eachother it’s dense, there’s way could happen Texas like that. /s Disney make money? Don’t selfish 

Edit; wow really need add /s posts ffs Looks like ruined capslock key too. Maybe put insurance claim new keyboard. People brainwashed man think wearing mask makes good person don’t realize fear that😂😂. overly pedantic term ""lockdown"". businesses shuttered two months+, indeed form lockdown, everyone understands point made term ""lockdown"" used within context covid-19 shuttering businesses staying quarantined.

After? Cant help lose hope humanity aggregates end I've close friends people many years.

Playing typo, think stop aggregating folks already. ;-)

I, too, learning many people previously thought intelligent, aren't. *Under normal circumstances* would could avoid getting flu and/or pneumonia. Bro, giving 100 day. used single digits cases reported every day times non. There's 15 day lockdown coming soon Bangalore. cities liberal rural parts not. CA big Netherlands, though smaller scale course. southern regions needed relief, patients brought hospitals northern provinces, Germany took dozen patients Netherlands well. protests added much outbreak? conservative family admitting covid-19 real they're blaming Black Lives Matter.

NYC seen thousands people protesting everyday since end May cases still dropping percentage positive tests remained ~1% several weeks. 

So answer no, outbreak little protests everything businesses like restaurants, bars, clubs opening people going parties United States. hoping DeSantis Lol stories unfortunately becoming common. fact new virus don’t know does. someone wants take gamble long term issues go it, hope don’t expose anyone else something happens. go 100. They'll taking people officially space putting corridors etc literally room/resources left. entire point measure much WORSE chances trying ""proactive"" run high risk contracting corona deadly surgery. 

It also takes hospital beds people dying could POTENTIALLY get point dying. 

There many reasons restrict elective surgeries. None outbreaks even started levels infection virus even made states though. COVID different beast beginning. Instead admitting capacity. Trolls strong today especially bad consider [Houston one largest, advanced, medical districts can't handle kind load, one can.  NJ densely populated state country- lot respect way leadership handling it, feel reopen bit premature, I'll still avoiding public gatherings family like plague (pun intended). honest conversation it.

That’s really works levels community spread. know current ""leadership"" going jack shit anyone worth millions.

Their first idea ANYTHING happens shove tax break rich response. leadership called question. Abbot overdue recall Deaths lagging metric. takes pneumonia set suffocate. won’t see deaths current uptick another week so.   Masks required statewide. Phase 2 continues three weeks. It’s almost complete lack action want best course action interesting study computer simulation. see simulating climate change, galactic formation, something seems amenable physical experimentation. simulate can, know, flush toilet? hard find (except really need one). 

Admittedly want live virus, particle size weight well known. could infected either airport might thinking Monday. Here’s email got head COVID response team one institutions TMC, thought great message line updates we’ve gotten team well president institution. 



“As environment community presence disease rise, natural question week is, “Where going?” What’s next?

The honest answer – one makes whole situation difficult – one knows.

It 6:30 Wednesday morning, pouring rain. look weather app see large cloud settled Houston. confident raining half hour. less clear happen afternoon. would like spend time outdoors Saturday, don’t clue whether rain not.

To me, COVID-19 pandemic feels like. see around corner. Everything else opaque. spontaneously fade like SARS? Become endemic pathogen, waxing waning months years come? Mount major recurrence flu season? safe effective vaccine available year? Next?

No one knows. Dr. Fauci doesn’t know, politicians, media pundits. guesses – often well-educated ones – still guesses.

We use hurricane analogy lot, increasingly poor fit situation. Houston, really good hurricane response. know one potential hit. context experience prior storms know bad might be. makes landfall, damage passes. Houston best – pick recover.

This hurricane, though struggle find accurate comparison. Comparisons seem either trite overblown. like innocent civilian population caught warring powers. like dealing complex physical, emotional cognitive needs aging relative dementia. like losing job economy struggling care family. know end, know when. Part knows resilience get it, find strength difficult situation. However, moment, uncertainty hardest part.

So, caveat (nobody knows), view expect next couple weeks:

-	The viral numbers Houston (total new cases, TMC hospital admissions, ICU census) continue rise.
-	TMC hospitals capacity begin stressed, hospitals activate plans sustainable surge capacity. involve adjusting staffing patterns physicians, nurses providers opening additional ICU beds. hospitals function level extended period time. viral numbers continue climb, increasing planning around emergency surge capacity. hoped disruptive emergency changes delivery system needed, even worse case projections right least three weeks off.
-	We know someone develops COVID-19 illness – family member, friends, neighbors, co-workers. inevitable virus spreads community. disease [institute] community imported outside. internal testing contact tracing processes effectively limit spread virus work.
-	The increased viral numbers associated media focus get attention citizens Houston surrounding communities. taken seriously now, see virus avoidance behaviors start improve. masks, less congregation crowded bars beaches. July 4th holiday weekend still present challenges, materially better managed public large Memorial Day.
-	State local officials already started stake aggressive posture virus control. Harris County, masking required businesses. Officials continue explore effective means limiting viral spread (through education, regulation enforcement), attempting avoid economic impact broader business “lockdown.”
-	Improvements masking heightened public awareness slow viral spread degree. success efforts major variable predicting peak. current guess peak occur late July. Remember caveat – don’t know rain Saturday.


My important prediction: [institute] community stressed disease burden community, continue work together effectively meet organizational mission. continue challenging circumstances take care population needs quality healthcare ever, pursue new discoveries educate future providers scientists. importantly, keep safe. Thank all.” agree, I'm also hopeful dust settles, death rate consequences bad many feared beginning. healthy respect it, get wrong, older get skeptical get media fear-mongering (politics aside). I've seen many instances life people getting riled something, absolutely sure they're right, fades. clear, think ""just"" flu, think worse. wonder held lens flu, find plenty gloom doom report too. instance, learned documented correlation flu strokes (I think stroke). fact scare anybody, number medical journal somewhere. fact life. maybe COVID reality cause strokes. point is, took make people afraid individual reports happening. could constructed media narrative using flu without dishonest. Infection rates too. rhinovirus important enough track much fervor, maybe we'd find ton asymptomatic positive cases too. I'm saying healthy respect, think people gobble media says instinctively construct worst-case scenario minds. People sure fucking stupid eh?

As said trying minimize discussion racism. let's obfuscate science quest highlight it. That's I'm wanting. I've thinking too. happened key metrics? said wanted B. Let's go next key metric list. Damn says too. Ok next key metric? Says exactly same. hell key metrics, herd immunity is. 15.8% positive 17.4% yesterday. Neither government citizens seem particularly interested taking kind meaningful action. like watching car crash point. much see. look states large portion tests coming back positive states largest protests. Arizona leading 22% positive (18% week ago) they've rising BLM protests happened. 

A hundred thousand protesters many people, comparison, 5.6 million people New York City riding subway every single day spiked. Added fact Covid spread poorly outdoors protesters wearing masks, believe protest-related spread would anywhere near large enough cause visible changes data. Really wish MD would also jump this.

Holy shit never life heard happening... Vietnam, enter cafe good chance meeting security guard sprays hands disinfectant. Or, getting bus, told put mask sit one row apart others.

Half year COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnamese still practice health measures there, though nation reported deaths disease and, two months, local infections.

The statistics put Vietnam unique spot biggest nation population report deaths, despite border China limited resources. statistics ignited debate, pitting skeptical one-party state could success without fixing data resent criticism.

There autocracies like China Iran, suspected covering COVID-19 deaths, open societies like New Zealand South Korea, whose success gone unquestioned. Vietnam finds somewhere between.

It hard outsiders verify official data, though health experts say Vietnam headed full-blown calamity drastic early action. government hyper-aware threat hospital quarantine capacity.

In meeting March 24, Ho Chi Minh City leaders said nation could handle 1,000 cases coronavirus. Beyond that, feared health system could inundated, Italy Spain.

“During next 10 days two weeks, allow number cases exceed 1,000 nationwide, otherwise risk disease outbreaks high,” summary meeting city government website said.

Vietnam reported 349 coronavirus cases far 2020.

Timing nearly important substance. U.S. Vietnam reported first cases week January. U.S. could avoided 36,000 COVID-19-related deaths begun lockdown March 8 instead March 15, according Columbia University. contrast, Vietnam saw disease threat early on, treating first patient January proceeding contact trace restrict movement.

Timing critical virus’ ability spread exponentially. Ho Chi Minh City government said, instance, every 300 people infected, 84,000 people quarantine. likely Vietnam cover mass infections deaths acted virus could reach point.

“If hit thousands, ten thousands, hundreds thousands cases seen countries, also would overwhelmed like countries,” Todd Pollack, head Harvard Medical School Partnership Health Advancement Vietnam, said U.S. television network PBS. “But, current state, that's situation here.”

In addition national coordination, targeted testing isolation, Vietnam decree measures regardless public debate, like tapping national security network monitor physical virtual space. government Vietnam News agency reported March 24 meetings Ho Chi Minh City People’s Committee.

“Standing vice chairman People’s Committee, Le Thanh Liem, urged local authorities relevant agencies visit every house find anyone come countries since March 8 test quarantine anyone risk home quarantine areas,” report said.

**Double-edged sword**

In April, U.S. President Donald Trump pondered injecting disinfectant could cure coronavirus. Vietnamese suggested remedy scientific basis Facebook, would lasted long government censors. presents double-edged sword local controls media.

Social media allowed false information spread Vietnam, also greatly heightened people’s awareness virus do, concluded study 11 authors published April *Sustainability*, science journal.

Vietnam’s success, said, came “mobilizing citizens’ awareness disease prevention without spreading panic, via fostering genuine cooperation government, civil society private individuals.” Facebook currently building huge new campus Dublin Google pretty much whole street. amount people employed tech industry extremely significant driven cost living unsustainable levels. also employ large amounts people London it’s really comparable since London 10 times population size Dublin. going full Captain Trips... family went yesterday Texas visit family Dallas, anyone know bad DFW metroplex area?

Like I'm trying find silver line there's none. Don’t believe anything China, look imported numbers strange look Reddit main sentiment appears avoid Chinese products, look environment nobody bothers china, U.S. appears real danger right now, even before.

Amsterdam easy reach air, Schiphol airport, city logistical nightmare. Downtown area impossible navigate, reaching city rush hour always end traffic jam.


There's smaller airport located Hague Rotterdam, Rotterdam Europe's largest port, would help immensely supply chain. roads also bit less cramped around Amsterdam. 

Cost living Rotterdam/The Hague area also lower Amsterdam. 

Since UK longer part UK, Netherlands would make logical place, would really much sooner look Rotterdam Amsterdam lot different reasons. 

Tax climate big corporations good corporations well. IKEA example moved headquarters Sweden Netherlands tax reasons. 

Not saying companies Amsterdam would bad, logistically (and practically, living costs employees etc), think Rotterdam would make sense. 

But eh, Amsterdam Rotterdam 75 minute drive apart (with traffic, bit important) No. Ramdev Balakrishna everyone else Patanjali trying scam innocent, gullible people spend time putting together figures EU, just: clicked Europe, one day again, sum new deaths there. 

I googled ""Population Europe"". 

I suspect comparison EU USA makes even closer like say. someone autoimmune disease requires suppress immune system want function I've self isolate years cold/flu season. took boycotting christmas get family considerate enough tell sick get make alternate arrangements avoid sick people. cold lay months. experience people take seriously impacts someone care for. banned since like March, international flights, countries even travel ban counties. news highlighted countries Europe starts opening borders, specifically stating opening US yet Totally useless. Cases continued get spiked could reach 500,000 end month. 2016 banner moment conspiracy theorists. Alex Jones became mainstream. It'll fun regular flu season shows up. Get 2 one special, flu covid time! Another year remote learning also mean portion kids learning basically nothing year. Wonder make people protesting lockdowns got coronavirus forbidden healthcare. eu lot things many areas. would hard write down. gave examples EU wrong comment above. 

Obviously good things going deny that. lately getting hand broad rules EU makes Broad policy negatively affecting countries within. say EU collapse. 

You can’t force broad policy onto everyone. negative countries positive others simply work. EU example stop forcing immigration onto countries stop forcing countries pay countries tax havens get millions highly taxed countries. refuse change. Often even richer countries money taken from.

That unsustainable. can’t keep sending money tax havens. I'm saying reread one think point reactions Philippines hair salons opened country customer capacity 30 percent per quarantine regulations. can't that! constitutional right! Oh wait... fucking retarded. virus spreading body dead problem solved.  guy

You take consideration Europe whole vs US, comparable population [tragic 446M europe vs 330M US. Seems like southern Governors stupid stuff like ignore CDC guidelines open soon, taken weeks longer initial predictions see infections spike. 

It's happening, fast many expected. Lmao! people died COVID-19 3 months entire year flu

With sign letting it'll end too! We're thinking come various waves.  You’re right favor, I’m reading correctly lines. bought paid federal level. It’s truly sickening.

Ain't way know virus guy studied virology since 25 years Johnny. news become fake news, flase flags, crisis actors?

There conspiracy theories around 9/11 bonkers now. CNN- today sun emerged horizon. FAKE! REAL! SUNS DONT EXIST! Wake sheep!! sweeeeeden long tradition euthonizing old sick useful state anymore. political comments goes narrative.  close race, you’re right neither candidate great option. Kinda like last couple presidential races... population many?? offering?? Lol Even excess deaths probably underestimate (for example Australia) underlying death rate range causes like influenza auto trauma declined simultaneously social changes had. Even current death rate would due Covid sorts causes declined.  already tatters, orange ape attempting run country, matter many time fucks up, breaks law otherwise makes look like morons, done nothing Population EU 446M population US 328M.
Twice size? guy big embarassment nation. Sadly there's millions like happens several icus run? nightmare scenario beginning. people forced die home? hospital parking lots? military type hospitals pop try care excess? knock effects? family required support get away crap. much time hands, convinced they're going die COVID.

Their mental health greatly improved stopped reading COVID speculation multiple hours day.. Yeah well, that's actually every french administration office *works*. us, trust one 😫😫 Yeah, showed virus who's boss, Hank. 

I tell hwhat. politicians made one error cost us. They've opened borders neighbouring countries without restrictions. two Bosnia Serbia time still big number active cases. people went Bosnia/Serbia back brought coronavirus Croatia. I'm shutin I'm gonna wait Asia least information, yet managed act. 

America information, choose lie. understand COVID-19 brought around SARS-Cov2, yes? want kill cockroach need nuclear weapon shoe response back home awful beyond comprehension.

Older guy here. Starting around Nixon, United States Government steadily lost effectiveness become corrupt.

People forget criminal Nixon was. organized secret bombing campaigns countries allies US killed 100,000 completely innocent people. prolonged Vietnam War year even though knew could won, even though killed thousands GIs tens thousands Vietnamese. many things count.

And starting Reagan, American 40 years Republican administration [a hotbed criminality succeeding Democrat fails budge needle slightest.

A lot generations right-wing Democrats power. Somehow DNC leadership decided best strategy move far right little left Republicans. mean, remember Clinton Administration? Welfare reform brought hunger back America, ""Three strikes, out"", repeal Glass-Steagall feel (including Bill, now) lead Global Financial Crisis 2008, Hillary's ""Defense Marriage Act"" (i.e. _against_ gay marriage). right wing shit!

There's tremendous unwillingness Democratic Republican Presidents use law punish powerful criminals.

Up Reagan, powerful criminals punished host agencies set Crash 29. Reagan jail ton bankers, forgave named Bush lot Savings Loans cronies. Fast forward - Wall Street pled guilty thousands serious felonies one spent day jail! 

Michael Milken charged comparatively minor technical violations got hard time Reagan. have. law says.

Now expect neither party obey law. Republicans walked cliff, Democrats followed them.

And finally, lead completely criminal President, way fucking leads pregnancy. pluralization grammar makes head hurt.   Totally incorrect. 100% mask usage Spain. 90% even mandatory. still going down? hospitals full, people gonna die due lack treatment. Huh, wonder friend thought that. Good know though! plus side lot good Vodka coming Russia. 50/50 wow plastered sub mo ago. also black coworkers specifically tell get watch YouTube links shared. love south, man appalled. misunderstanding person misleading.

 also case group people town got stranded Philippines embassy simply didn’t want bring back. 

The point even EU countries treat citizens like shit helping it’s inconvenient it’s messed up. What's scale? That's definable, rather hard track. look total excess deaths area people blame lockdown those.

Of course should. anyone dies cancer treatment delayed, hospital conserve blood, peds nurse moved adult icu part surge Agreed. told wear clothes work, wouldn't? least mentioned it. Meanwhile, Arizona governor, busy getting knees president decided blame outbreak surge mexicans, lack personal responsibility, made sure waive mask requirements president's big rally.

I agree latter one though, moment hint reopen people flocked every public place could, nobody wore masks, everyone shocked face suddenly kept breaking record new cases day.

Better wages, health care, education, better handle COVID. things need change. 

I hope BLM protests enlightened others power make changes. 1% need us. hard think.Timely actions taken,proactive actions nope(example:The lockdown timely action,but much proactive actions taken that).We still trying,buy people either stopped caring lulled false sense security.In state(Karnataka),most stopped wearing masks social distancing gone toss part. taxpayers funding research things developed afford buy.
It different time around.
I applaud enthusiasm naivete. We're pass voting. Another protest needs happen. Like now. Playing oligarchy rules go certain point.

Better wages, health care, education, better handle COVID. things need change. 

I hope BLM protests enlightened others power make changes. 1% need us. time said done, ranking counties COVID-19 cases match population ranking.

So surprise LA county top spot. people actually looked history understanding consumer focused economy saw coming. open everything like people still scared go spend matter doubt flag anything good news it’s Sweden.

Asking friend...  don’t think it’s quite simple. People fled NYC people actually NYC. transplants family outside city. I’m sure partially true big cities like Houston Phoenix nowhere near extent NYC.

There’s also fact happened NYC first. People know dealing time. know. suspect families outside major hotspots less willing welcome family members fleeing hotspots. That's nightmarish! hear death also uncomfortable. Verified testing data people went protests. Also, protest epicenters (like DC) incredibly well cases case positive rates. 5-10 times many deaths per million compared nearest neighbours Denmark, Finland Norway. antibodies work viruses speak English.

Would mind keep mind case local supply get restored? Right. Thanks. I’ve (and family) aren’t retarded. I’m coming you, know shouldn’t use R word. Jesus Fucking Christ I’m straight patience fools. 

For real, though, thanks. anybody praising shitting time? Okay honestly don’t see California isn’t breath. Didn’t hit 6000 cases day? Southern California going get hit hard doesn’t get curtailed soon. county 3000 new cases past two weeks, covid19 cases restaurants aren’t disclosed employees guests. It’s scary. didn’t know thing Wuhan, research sake unknown force draconian lockdowns. Wether virus unsure. Time give clarity Lung scarring kind thing might stop able run marathon 20s become impairment age. There's going lot younger people recover fine start getting 40s 50s. Marginally. Sweden size single US state, population Georgia. It’s hard make accurate comparison Georgia US. whole point field hospitals ""weren't needed"". I'm shocked tell ya I'm shocked! Okay maybe shocked. need test zero people, zero infections. really get issue here. homemade masks make black people look like criminals, makes black people look like criminals might get shot look like criminals? 

They mention danger factor explain kind danger. Phooey. was, is, been, grossly negligent. Thats political, thats fact. feels like poor comparison. Epidemiologically, recognize BLM protests incur risks. surprise society view taking risk fight systemic injustice different taking similar risk bored want go bar get drunk. Cuomo mention NY possibly that? Went store last week mask looks like something wear getting power armor Fallout 4. Clerk wearing mask standing side plexiglass barrier talking me, coughed hand (can't make stuff up), handled goods checked out. sanitize. Even though know there's real chance get virus mask wear thorough sanitizing measures, still HORRIFIED. Luckily, that's instance whatsoever something like happening going again. Every place I've go store-wise past month GREAT regarding employees wearing masks, standing behind plexiglass, wearing gloves, sanitizing said gloves customers due contact transfer, everyone abiding yellow directional lines floors pretty decently. times I've deal Nosers (the morons wear mask nose understand breathing works), that, people area decent smart. people busy looking excuse take away people’s lives. Nothing good. Especially disproportionately African American populations economically impacted COVID. human researchers say thing, refuse believe it. could take food home stop putting people risk eating needed. I’m NY, server minimum “only” $4 less minimum, here. stuck two hours side work one night, double. decided away hosts beginning year, made server work one host shift per week. them, got server minimum shifts, even though said would get actual minimum shifts. spoke up, “punished.” greater good collides interests, really matter me. Mask ventilator. 

Only choose one. Yeah Interesting. Im also NJ, family/friends states, (admitedly, anecdotal) horror stories ive heard states (including PA, MD, ME, CO, AZ) make really glad im nj lockdown testing prevalent targeted. last week university party hosted football players. 4 football players tested positive everyone party contacted tested. course plenty tested positive. 90% never felt symptoms would never gone get tested last month. Another gym town someone tested positive everyone notified tested. course people tested positive. financial incentives political implications go along virus may play role accurate data well. 

While good happy successfully testing better, testing definitely different Texas last two months. It’s illegal patients record hospital. told last week stay. Make sure y'all get vote. funny thing makes racists extreme “anti-racists” insecure. racists worry minority could born smarter were, anti-racists think genetically influenced IQ exists somehow validates racists makes ok discriminate. silly view Hope you’re feeling better recover well. 

The circumstances likely got sick similar work environment (except ton employees open office layout). made rather clear working remotely vaccine available otherwise effective treatment. 

I fortunate opportunity work remotely wish able better support remote work non-essential tasks. guarantee immunity according current research, though animal studies look promising.

Vaccines meant cure someone already infected. always prophylaxis.

The real concern ), aside efficacy, safety profile vaccine. lets say deadly skin rash happens 0.0001% population. trial thousands less likely pick that. administered millions, however, sudden new adverse events start popping (you see folks skin rash). continued monitoring phase 4 studies important! I'm careful country lot less cases per million still I'm sure enough luck decides get virus. Somerville Cambridge also $300 fine caught outside without mask. school’s plan approved, goes effect rates area remain low. can’t enacted based numbers we’re seeing. first two phases don’t even involve on-campus classes. It’s like schools rushing reopen. Yeah visit mom backyard 8 feet away. still mow lawn inside. quit job hostess. life worth 12 hour thanks. Again. on.my locale. think they're saying may true, account widely differing ratio of: mortalities vs percentage members class, countries observe.

To point though, entirely possible malnutrition US may determinant amount Vitamin people color may get United States.

It sounds like studies needed.  3 weeks voting happens decide whether everyone keeps getting financial help, government says FUCK IT, nothing happens, benefits end, people FORCED find work evicted. unlike every first world country cant something simple fucking rent freeze god damn. 

I sincerely hope fucking parasites want steal us refuse us FUCKING AID, suffering incapacitated virus then. UK citizens still right live work EU, free movement, vice-versa. Apart taking flag legal technicality, nothing yet changed. 

The idea strange anyway. EU right police border member states, article says threatening keeping borders throughout Schengen anyone complying. Politically would death EU countries punished refusing. 

But take point UK technically EU member, that's mentioned I'd added in. Woooo calm down. Sounds like ones got case trump derangement syndrome. Whats personal attacks too, never said anything bad all. 
I know reddit saying think trumps Satan earth popular opinion eco chamber forum. im defs voting next election option biden. Id vote turnip take biden seriously. Bernie vote, DNC decided go ape shit. fault loose election. 

I'm dyslexic spelling grammar good me. Either way hope good day. think people active online taking polls ones charge reopening economy? 

Public opinion internet polls doesnt determine actions leaders, lawmakers, business owners. locale. Italy forthcoming info. videos taken within besieged hospital wards testimonials health care workers went viral internet.  New York, governor developed recent popularity relative voice reason massive crisis cases, also previous history defunding health care forcing hospital closures. system ready. could done better learn experience others, affected states learn well. states poorly southern western. Midwest fine. keep bailing business’s 🤷‍♂️ stay brainwashed government can’t help ordinary people Wonder secondary factor Japan's low case count; office toilets lids **and** everyone wearing masks, could help LOT reduce risk.  Arizona starting show signs it... We're already 85% capacity ICU inpatient beds, there's 300 ICU beds left entire state.

If growth rate past three weeks continues, we'll peak NY April infection rate per capita first days July.

The super spreader event Phoenix make things much worse, imagine people drove around state attend. much cases spiking there? Yeah, 'MAYBE' joke. wife works lab medium sized Arizona hospital told yesterdays’s census report. 3 total COVID patients weeks ago 50. 24 bed ICU full. 23 patients COVID positive 10 ventilators. 3 ventilators open. It’s **bad** getting worse here. 

I’m fortunate enough full time work home even COVID, I’m terrified wife go work, even though isn’t patient facing. hospital good job taking seriously, live around many idiotic people arguing wear masks it’s even funny. Would rather tenant wear tear property pay sit empty? Tenants think one. Lately US tends fix, easier abandon. administration's legacy. point, evictions certainty. People $3000 behind going catch up. Oh, extra $1500 month. give landlord ""less behind"" (i.e. throw away) look new place use security deposit...  Ok get point. still think look statistics. least retrospect. Prevantable deaths occurs year around many cases humans dont anything various reasons. Maybe good thing comes tradegy gets attention. friend mine Pittsburgh went mechanic rural area called ""Hillary clinton virus."" Like moth flame. question many death currently. want know many deaths take. 


All die. Freedom handed due virus. Stupid fucking liberals. one hit places Texas. 5th July people supposed start coming work. dumbass date lol. Yes. 

Basically, bunch top researchers best universities state helping free. 

The governor like not-so-rosy predictions, got rid (again, volunteer work best experts state). *Corps Engineers huge part dealing NYC outbreak. Building something like 40 surge hospitals, Houston well. Sidebar - subreddit Boomers get idea Millenial entitlement. Like, *satirically* post stuff post straight face. Tell poor white people Fine lowers prices homes Texas. want check early everything bigger Texas even corona Bad LGBT rights think pretty clear comment post's headline media general rather source data, no? dry facts great, cut dry spin becomes relevant disemminating information broader audience. stinkiest cheeses. wind make shift shelters hundreds people inside gyms.

Imagine super dome hurricane katrina covid going on! think use official statistics

They do, collate deaths *reported* day, one's *occurred*. get it, anyone disagrees must evil spy.

🙄 Oh please, go on. things? Make sure speak otherwise can’t hear sound low covid metrics comparison rest United States. article makes bad point legitimizing rebellion ""it DNA."" 70% Americans wearing masks, actually selfish people arent mature enough face hypocrisy saying gov't shouldnt make choices them, make health choices ppl share spit. 

Any good child psychologist tell children immature adults employ double standards routine basis. wont change outlook overnite, wont ever change outllok. confronted hypocrisy, would distract shifting conversation gov't authority. issue individual maturity, issue culture. spreading misinformation? true true since around April. 

From [Ottawa Public example: ""Any Ottawa resident feels need test, **even showing symptoms**, go testing COVID-19 Assessment Centre COVID-19 Care Clinics turned away, unless volumes significant. volumes significant, priority given residents high-risk groups showing symptoms."" herd immunity

Yeah theory sorta shot shit now. Pretty much every infectious disease history vaccines invented? Buddy, hospitals got overloaded NYC, state sat empty, following policy Cuomo, dumping stabilized seniors back nursing homes Cuomo told them. crazy projections never came true reason discharge people free beds except hospitals NYC. So, go rewatch past press-conferences, cause words obviously important actions. solve *their* problem delay till elections...

I‘m supposed living less year I’m mortified becoming another statistic looming homelessness tragedy well, situation persists escalates  90/week chump change. reading abstract (don’t time read 60 page article), authors seem arguing *overall* numbers didn’t increase substantially people staying inside avoid protestors, especially areas violent. they’re necessarily saying protestors aren’t going transmit it, rather hasn’t resulted general increase cases Got get opened time NBA Deaths lag cases. Treatment improved.

Initially lots cases, little testing + poor treatment meant huge “numbers” increasing deaths. Peaked around 35k cases day, deaths 3000 peak. deaths earlier NYC hospitals getting overwhelmed.

Cases gradually dropped. Dropped like 12k day. Deaths also began drop. Add treatments getting better: doctors finding better techniques help people battle through. deaths drop further. Testing ramped tends find asymptomatic cases rather life-threateners.

However, cases rising again, substantially. days row 30k+. still expect deaths increase this; even reaching peaks April, probably see rise trend 30k+ continues increases. Cops wont safe enforce. think civil war cops begin people fight back evictions ridiculously stupid approach kill far to. Seriously, rethink that. I've heard people spew vile shit Whitmer throughout whole thing. imagine Rick Snyder office still...we would dead already. did. That’s posted article. truly living Orwellian times. think know real numbers infected kids. get tested often. I've tested definitely want kid test done, feels like they're trying scoop brain out. comrade, Moscow St. Pete? guess sweating spitting place isn't. Remember many stupid people often many vote certain way! Voting matters! Worst case scenario additional doses needed vaccines, big problem. know English term those. get think cops continue killing blacks. Cool.

And go. admitting bias, inability argue without BS logical fallacies. 

Here's another post downvote kid. saving world man! appreciate abilities press buttons. 🙄 k Bullshit! like nation member buy whatever nation makes it!

This fearmongering extreme.

I agree 99% Trump's bullhockey right idea damned close China mechanism take task? Defunding them. percentage people seeing wearing masks? probably active measures. opposed President = gets added list = online army attacks put much blame Abbott. lot stupid people Texas. Even people think unconstitutional told do, literally life death situation. No, racists said many times “I won’t wear mask”! “It’s right”! “Government can’t control body”! (Unless it’s unborn babies). protestors giving masks hand sanitizer Seattle. People can’t switch narrative whenever it’s convenient them. people made beds you’re going lay them. trump gone, you’ll still nobody. people you’ve pushing away past 4 years still going hate you, doesn’t go away. “It’s still possible” wow one article says it’s still POSSIBLE. already know fact indoor transmission spread WAY easily indoor. Go away you’re racist. Probally wait long. 'Murica taking Covid seriously lack leadership. shit. probably stop point. EU whole Europe two different things — know right? 26% increasing. take away fact going push ICUs past capacity. bad constitution huh? damn right free movement almost bad second amendment! could Patriot Act everyone would safe. Trump know measure backfire severely. lead indefinite closer US vaccine. 

No country risk second wave fully knowing lack transparency models obviously predict increase cases US. comment basically reiterating second half mine without adding new info. focus trend face value 26% ICU non-surge capacity Covid patients alarming layman. No, Federal goverment step Corps engineers build hospitals like 40 locations 4 days NYC. stock market up. I'm guessing never work freedom desperately cling to. 

Good news is, everyone freedom ban wearing mask. explicitly states virus spread protests,

Of course didn't, could anyone say otherwise (and cancelled twitter crowd)  I've tried find new friends. Nowhere say cannot get tested youd like one. says recommend. Lol 
Show says can't get I've heard hospitals full lies parking lots empty. remember hearing protecting others previous outbreak. know pn forwhile simple mask reduce amount water droplets put air. big past, people kept using them. pretty routine lot Asian countries masks started. Shit, masks ubiquitous Spanish flu. Complete anti-mask protestors. Considering EU consists European countries, tell matter context. something protect country?

I really *hope* turning ship around. interesting see much TTI high caseload like one Sweden has. fingers crossed effective conventional knowledge says will... bad timing terms society's response told social distance, suddenly thousands people start protesting media says, ""Yes, good idea"", government allows everyone gets message ok go public gather large groups again. ""No, no, ok political protests"" work.

Actually seems working fine many places. Boston, New York... I've ill since March finally gave relief dexamethasone.

I hope girlfriend recovers soon. Yep, relative keeps trying call overreacting he's saying everyone get Covid eventually there's nothing worry since we've flattened curve already, stay home orders supposed accomplish. 

He keeps parroting far important get economy going again. I've replied multiple times showing places opened early back 1918 ended poorer economies long run way people dead, falls deaf ears. he's pretty intelligent guy otherwise dunno koolaid he's drinking. Uhh Houston. problem.  Give break give impression slapstick comment like means don’t respect people losing jobs? Central California stupid learn LA. right behind you. numbers starting skyrocket leadership ignorantly pandering right wing nut jobs. ego important American lives. ""All Ex's lived Texas""... new twist old song. I'm fucking tired people saying lied masks. specifically talking N95 masks prioritized Healthcare workers, comparison cloth masks facial coverings effective. That's it. That's fucking science. Indian troops cross border china's, another way around. priced. feel bad employees. article reports South American countries, says nothing countries Central America Caribbean. Bad title, it’s suggesting experiences Brazil, Peru, Uruguay Argentina countries aren’t even continent. Many smaller Caribbean countries, due small populations islands, reopening aggressive lockdowns relatively successful reducing numbers. 

From article:

""It's still possible protests may caused increase spread virus among attended protests, according report.

&amp;#x200B;

Go away, one cares think like **50,000** people. man brought home box (I think quantity = 500) food service gloves local Asian grocery. Less sweaty latex gloves cheap, tossing single use easier rationalize since latex gloves harder find / expensive. 

I kind laughed bringing huge box gloves home, things awesome. keep ziploc bag handbag now! Cops morals. Morals would prevent freely killing people. Military members would good leader present mask-wearing campaign. They're group ingrained look battle buddy. act like bunch pussies crying hard breathe mask. They're used wearing heavy annoying kit yet get job done. lot Americans value them. embody principals leadership much needed here. Military members getting vocal wearing mask like piece kit would encourage lot people get it. joke meant fewer instead less. USA USA I’m ignoring data I’m reading mote realistically trying make fit personal opinion. get think cops continue killing blacks. Cool. agree bad, says 26% COVID patients. Gov. Abbott still needs something gets much worse! English province Cheddar invade dominate lesser cheeses.  ""I'm sorry I'm busy drowning bathtub. Ask Grover Norquest guess!"" 
-The Federal Government problem beating moron. far nobody pressed wearing mask though. Pot calling fridge black, right there.

Funny thing is, account partly discourse coaxes really telling comments readers, like Danish employers threatening fire employees would somehow good thing. go far make statements like that, really shows clinging narrative. state better infection rate point New Jersey? Coughing covered free speech. must bean update, original pictures measurements form. (Months ago first looked). still see place leave reviews although see stars every mask click yet nowhere leave review read others. frequently asked questions see questions answers nowhere leave questions. I've also noticed took pics names staff. really can’t make statement like data provided. 

Just like couldn’t said Sunday pandemic lowest recorded deaths since late March. (Only 267 deaths Sunday)

You can’t cherry pick data make broad statements either direction. Pretty fucked, definitely selfish, think it’s fair assumption people weren’t experiencing symptoms didn’t feel need tested. Either way, study would’ve perfect ass holes would’ve cooperated! better way tests efficacy masks hair salon (15 minutes close exposure), actually enforced masking guidelines. We’ll plenty data businesses don’t comply, seeing it’s 80% them. recommended required before. people already wearing part state. Come Amazon. making money hand fist. right thing. Man even think state students. suppose quarantine huge deal - let state people back dorms two weeks everyone else.

The college experience take whole new meaning next semester. Hopefully things pan everyone♥️ Fuck that. can't held responsible lack social distancing comes *Sir* Patrick Stewart. Nobody can. governor said [a week need alarmed. happens federal/national-level response. United States behaving unified country. What?   say can't get deaths wrong, studies going back finding deaths ""misclassified"" even admitted. yes, counting deaths also wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going say US got right, whole thing played one know ""got right"" ""totally flubbed it"". [Probably European countries case fatality rates higher That’s goes you’re expat country opposed permanent resident citizen there. support Europe banning US citizens going due COVID19 concerns also support US banning non US citizens entering US COVID19 concerns. Good luck friend De$ancti$ finally decided shut down, Florida unemployed website work. people applied got zip. De$ancti$ knew non-functional 2018. People work got money, went back work soon immediately rent due. Floriduh good place live unless old - me. Fed make much money wants. There's limit pump except side effect inflation line. That's South Korea right now, $100/night. Might travel essential work came across US Embassy website thing someone studying US right now. Can't get back leave, even job. fact trump keeps banning opportunities people come States, GF European (J1 visa ban). tbf countries almost completely erradicated specially Slovakia czech republic. People UK wearing masks unwise lol There's always relevant Simpson's quote. wish town would, we're getting vacationers around country seriously puting community jeapordy. 

Like, people think going vacation right good idea? forgot secret de-coder ring damnit.... main consideration, far tell, almost every necessary step contrary standard Canadian biases every level, considering we've done well despite biases necessary steps taken. However, look South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, NZ Australia. 

Recall hesitancy incredulity notion border closures, deploy thermometers every airport early whilst citizens came back overseas, infected. lack actual quarantine sites, instead limply asking people self-quarantine. fact Americans sort still vacationing Banff government hesitant take harsh measures like fully sealing border (though that's also sheer pressure America, admittedly).

Our lockdown measures relatively unrestricted well, accordingly whilst slowly crushing disease, painfully slow compared European nations. there's Quebec deciding exact opposite rest country, least briefly, eating covid storm it.

Like, things considered, feel could done way better, there's real one point point say 'they knew coming opposite dumb thing anyways'; lot things could done better better prepared global pandemic. taking child her?! Seriously man I’m proud state whitmer this. People bitched probably happy now. know, stay way. go way download app... president send alert phones bad. Let's hope Canada follows suit. take one Dallas surgery May. Got results day tested negative. Probably bad idea.  Chinese citizen studying US, can’t convince everyone magically start like government, fact really try take care majority Chinese people. US government feel like can’t quite say same. use 14 billion earmarked covid19 funds Trump hidden away stuff like this? stop bailing corporations need help actually help companies like rely tourism survive? want hear one fucking word money economy comes pandemic.  country access enough money get years worth lockdowns laughable people keep saying states reopen stay open economy trashed.  managed get virus control lockdowns work time need right. pandemic going away start changing real fucking fast living country attitudes are. Gr here, I’m guessing Lansing? Heard ppl bad way. Lol I'm getting either way. feel comfortable ruling out. surprised 2016 many people shocked.  really news?  It’s US, Brazil, Russia, sure, keep dumbass lol Political career? expect get reelected? would assume Mass would willing shut again, unlike many states RemindMe! one month Fuck that... piss Americans change terminology... border still closed, we’re able extend needed, best least try work them. disagree future extending duration make indefinite point. Welp. goes plans see wife. six year old without much bitching, adult. even close. That’s (from know) China isn’t stupid US terms containing virus lol feel confused one here. comment towards per reply made perfect sense AZ, TX, FL. Read b4 commenting. Oops replied wrong post. Disregard 😆  Yeah, said went two days ago. Fly radar anger crazies.

Singular, Crazy, one crazy need worry about.

The others whatever says, like wear mask attack brown people, etc. No, everything socioeconomic disparity black white americans. [African Americans make significantly less white , so, less likely afford good healthcare live near good hospitals. also likely exposed lower income jobs less likely able offer work-from-home. Less likely disposable income able purchase masks. 

Racial inequality America super complex issue, can’t get it. doesn’t mean doesn’t exist. it’s existence isn’t condemnation either, need sensitive topic maybe part combat it. think government setting contract tracing? genuinely want move back Mexico fucking dumbasses lol

Literally thing keeping job opportunities girlfriend. Yeah totally understand would frustrating. don’t know enough opinion either way. know it’d pretty hypocritical though Americans expect go outside US work that’s case. anyone wants live work Europe realistically subject sane restrictions imposed way. arguing. pointing facts. Good, Growth rate coronavirus Ireland right around 0.02-0.04% per day (AKA 5-10 cases), we've almost beaten people arriving US, Brazil etc. easily reverse gradual decline. lying hoarding masks themselves. Isn’t insane?, predict within next month, president get Well true, facts racialized? said hispanics blacks susceptible anyone else Let tell former preschool teacher- much want trust parents, aren’t going take kids temps every day fever there’s chance they’ll give Tylenol send anyway-I’ve happen times unfortunately it’ll probably still happen pandemic. Maybe slightly less often it’s definitely possibility. 

If family live without money, might better quit she’s uncomfortable stressed. Maybe look job somewhere would feel comfortable, see would take back someday it’s safer there. One might call Governor Florida Douchecanoe think EU willing take financial hit least rest year part 2021. America isolated long time world. believe this, value citizens EU, make due losses. Plus I'm sure they'll make loss visitors Asia. *toilet seats wish hair fell out! Uh oh, screwed..... COVID Chips form union theyre treatments making big difference? kidding said kidding said /s. same. Like fuck wrong people. idiots wear mask. swear fucked. people already wearing here, least area are. hear wearing East side state; there's lot people think whole thing joke hoax. That's kind thing would happen does. worked gumption found alas, YouTube won’t allow country. Thanks anyway. deaths plummeting even overall cases relatively constant since early May.

What? cases way week. 3-4 weeks we'll start seeing deaths go way up. suspect that's they're border closure extensions 30 day chunks. Fly radar anger crazies. tip iceberg... comes. everyone saying wearing masks important. happened doctors medical professionals stating masks unnecessary, help spread disease? I've friends go ahead spout off. Needed response brought Well, country national Healthcare system, public secondary education, actual social programs accomplishing mentioned above. china sued, US sued well go full lock now, it’ll take what, three months take curve acceptable level? Good, save STEM hating culture. Make sure New Yorkers leave New York, you’ve got deal. Maybe someone’s viral cough cloud heading towards hair acts barrier/filter? Need study bald men wear wigs... According worldometers, 99 cases short second highest day ever (35,991 vs 36,090).

And Tuesday. 

The death totals lower early April assuming daily totals due better treatment options, see us surpassing time high 7-day cases week, think 50,000k new case day definitely table near future. Seeing writing makes face slap even harder! Fuckin lol I'm taking part Oxford vaccine trial team believe could rolled September/October.

I honestly wait Oxford vaccine available. would moon rolled even December 31 2020. would amazing. Grabbing popcorn end world.

Maybe american experiment give us great insights pandemic management. 

I mean... U need around 70% immune herd immunity. 328.2 million population, that's 229.74 million people infected recovered. Even 0.1% mortality rate best case estimate assuming flattened curve, sufficient hospital resources probably moderately effective medication, 229k people die. That's almost double current death numbers. 1% mortality likely, that's 2.29 million. That's scary. Nope. elective surgery hospital pre-covid levels patients always comes almighty dollar. opened everything feds cant afford keep giving stimulus $ extra $600 week unemployment insurance. wear mask everywhere many businesses enforcing it. mask- entry. Wtf wrong ppl sub? Y'alls lives must miserable. Dud even click it? simply site puts together positive news towards vaccines whatnot. thought would useful wanting get shot positivity. Apparently not. odd sad. youre stupid. Ground glass opacities lungs present people regular flu, seen chest scans 85% patients whove URI's. gaining posting ""nature"" article? know logic. Covid wasnt reason this, maybe was. regardless doesnt matter. check tons athletes whove Coronavirus spreading. People everywhere soiling pants, want detail. cases coming low base makes R value look bad. Holy fuck

This first time see thread click ""Continue thread"" once.  Yep, well worth it. lockdown costing us almost 600 million day, saved money well lives that. like hotels going see business either. governor came today told people best stay home.

He telling cities right lock down. cases surging, trying say addressed local rules. many people respect lockdowns carry normally. turned disaster personally responsible tons new cases. least balls say wrong first time. little late. know it’s I’m thing. I’m scared. think exposed 10 days ago went walk park. woke morning extremely nauseous high blood pressure (190/90) vomited several times, nonstop nausea diarrhea whole day. desperately hope it’s stomach virus doesn’t progress. I’m getting tested morning meantime I’m fucking terrified. Dude, put podcast give support. highly recommend Fake History, Ear Hustle, Behind Bastards. You’re taking way seriously. original phrasing comment joke, comment also tongue cheek. don’t explain context institutional racism largely responsible lower socioeconomic status black people America. Beautiful! way contract tracing work country. Absolutely none. = Russians ass... didn’t know case Germany. Thanks info. know US fucked country much denser population, epicenter disease, ignored censored information disease 2 months, inferior medical technology considered safer US 🧽🤵 work Houston - things getting crazier day day  boomers run. political guy stretch, sincerely believe way Trump henchmen handled pandemic inspired enough people vote make sure he's gone. like inspired Cletus racist middle school education come nowhere vote last time, think enough people watched talk getting UV light disinfectant inside bodies cure COVID motivated make sure represented this... Guy Except total unknown. enough information recommend masks medical personnel. knew respiratory. take fucking genius look SARS respiratory diseases spread. world decades experience diseases, reinventing wheel every time. Look Asia - idea do, it.

America got watch China Europe, learned nothing, nothing, said exact opposite should. something criticized for.  one say ""Stay positive"" without people tying ""positive"" test. Come man. Words mean different specific contexts. Bingo. That's expecting. I'm hoping people start paying attention late. Maybe everyone knows people it, start chill, right seems like people lost damn minds. Parties everywhere, packed bars nightclubs, etc. ridiculous. Hoping make without one cases overloading hospitals. Yeah, that's do! pulled Canada card drunk angry guy Vietnam. helped calm situation though thanks, Canada! owe one.  Lmao Give's whole new context French say stuff like 'You stupid Americans' Inhumane :( ""Haphazard"". Well, that's very...diplomatic...way putting it.  hasn't, thanks click bait title. Inhumane... Yeah see maybe 50% mask usage WA everytime go out. . That's huge number. heck? Nah, they'll lie say never liked him.

I remember reading something Nixon I'm sure look actual numbers want. Nixon majority popular president impeached. 20ish% people would admit voting him.

So half voters abandoned even polls, would anonymous. Yet. That's need remember. cases started spiking new York nobody knew anyone affected, did. 1 650 New Yorkers dead covid-19. 1 350 New Yorkers ended hospital. that's massive intervention.

Arizona point curve New York mid late march. Cmon y'all, lets make 200% full capacity! Cause y'all fuck ups keeping us winning! message needs spread widely even young people suffer permanent lung damage even full recovery. scare New Jersey's proximity NY count something too. like said, called tri state area economies intertwined. Winsconsin big cultural hub right people going back forth. yes bad area. Horrible even. us stayed indoors kept away people. go outside wore masks. better states like Texas, Arizona Florida charts going wild. 3 months initial outbreak. 

Do really get point? hate you. love too.
I respect appreciate stance this.
This shit fault. ask this. idiots made choices.
They made clear respect us rules, happily/carelessly cause outbreaks means precious vacation Banff.
That reflects people. 
Not state.
I'm sure folks pleased fucks potentially bringing rona doorstep either!
We're together bud.
I hope healthy safe, hope soon see guys' numbers trending steadily downward.

Millions could die. ones survive disease may experience permanent damage lungs organs. need get informed, especially since kid. sucks without job I'm afraid get little help government deal this, sure beats dead fucked life. Therefore dispose dictators strive democracy. Dictators can't saints, dictating. still maintaining 14 self quarantine anyone traveling returning state. ICU’s fill capacity regular. Maybe better question many transferred quickly case capacity urgently needed, many COVID related. Basically, nurses ICU docs saying they’re approaching crisis, need work transfer orders notes get things moving... Bingo. Turns government wants something money limitless things rushed. technology allows people easily blur faces videos? Thanks. Nice see kind words everyone else commenting cliched ""India doomed"" phrase. (We know we're doomed positivity really helps keep mental health country check). worse New York. New York went hospital capacity lockdown. Texas even gone lockdown things already heading worst. Pretty sure seat belts like 50 years ago, 70's. read article, notes indoor spaces especially spreads disease. 

Outdoor protests people wearing masks still risk (compared staying home), extent churchgoer enclosed building. Nah, get number even banana president U.S.. Why?Almost 15% NJ tested add ppl already didn’t get tested. reason close things there’s slight uptick That's Amurican Spirit. nothing, way highway.

Flip head. 1300s covid appeared, would killed 10% population, spread like wildfire. would also vaccine centuries.

We lucking due centuries medical advances technology. incredibly ignorant works. try listening people actually know they're talking about. Murphy's law😥😂 Merkel busy quite sure fears Canadian I’m worried we’re gonna do. run president next......    /s outbreak started earlier EU, virus time work Yes, would relevant info. timely article posted, need doctors note get tested. That’s quite bit different referral Mayo Clinic, stated. falsehood. 

As far info go by, I’d highly recommend situation developing daily, go articles published within LEAST last month. evidenced fact able find recent article reply me, it’s hard do. 

I’m trying attack seem nitpicky, spreading false information required get tested simply ok right now. hope you’ll careful future. are... peaked already, see US going bad next weeks, expecially since Science done massive improvements. USA! USA! USA! MUCH WINING Y'ALL! 😎😎😎 always hate comment inconsistent messaging. Messaging consistent experts information need make sound statement. Remember called novel coronavirus. Novel, like book. Novel like new. working incomplete information, new information change stance subject quite often. treating medical professionals encyclopedia knowledge unknown. science knowledge known, know, still best chance us listen dealing virus best chance navigating unknown comfort: seeing people behave Corona restictions last days Belgium, New Zealand looks appealing well. Baker smart advance next phase holiday. Phase 2 Part 1 began Memorial Day. Phase 2 Part 2 began Father's Day.

Wear fucking mask. it, cares anyone thinks. Wear damn mask. Since we've carrying conversation two different posts, I'll mention excluded NYC entirely figures one show relative least one state Northeast, New York State sans NYC still poorly. would respectably disagree then.

Just dictator tried make place (subjectively) better place mean they're benevolent. Hitler also tried make Germany better place. Xi.

All decisions advantageous disadvantageous effects society rule. seen advantageous (or benevolent) one side may seen disadvantageous (or malevolent) another. end, think concept dictator equated benevolence -- decisions made affected decision, never say decision made proper debate compromise within society.

CCK like Chinese rulers today. bustling economic growth strict media controls masking suppressing societal class injustice beneath. Even Chinese might view Xi benevolent, know better. local sheriffs decide enforce shutdown.

That's decide. choose flout law, national guard could brought in. good call. mean... quite lot countries EU numbers bad US. real death numbers Italy Spain example 3 times higher reported (if one looks excess deaths). Thanks! actually do. Today day 8 feeling pretty solid. worry, looks everything handle, 3 months feel guilty return work :/ looking forward getting going back. return work stop quarantining, homeless. go taking video patients hospital without permission. fact, really take comment down. would illegal, it’s morally disgusting me. 

Hospitalized patients often scared vulnerable, trusting care teams treat dignity. see internet edgelord trying record suffering without permission, I’ll detain myself. FFS... facebook mommy groups said need essential oils meditation music, know 17 803 955 tests conducted (+281 203).

Thank contribution. Physical issues aside people get PTSD vent. That's TVs play sounds/scenes day/night outside. 

Sensory deprivation form torture can't move, see, smell, taste, etc... really hear respond fucks you. Exactly. Finally someone gets it. reason always share needles friends touch people's blood gloves on. worn condom years. eat trash. going catch anything would happened already.  Yeah he's gonna take medicine whether wants not. They're still denial.. 90% Yosemite visitors stay valley. park huge valley small section it. No. got reported I've checked can't find - looks might posted r/China_Flu here, I've reapproved it. Sorry. want delete repost shows New posts, let know I'll let (as it'll get picked repost do). Factually incorrect furthers quite political narratives.

On criteria basing classification? stop calling outbreaks second waves already? Contact credit card company get refund directly disputing charge. That’s I’m August trip America LOL Fortsætte* think challenge typical ICU bed demand incredibly steady, capacity isn’t built much beyond reasonable contingency factor. COVID cases alone represent 41% increase baseline non-COVID admissions. That’s huge given fairly fixed capacity beds. Normally I'd say let happen people going go trump rallies go local stores restaurants poor people forced serve them. They're gonna touching groceries, clothes, door handles, etc. kinds people brag washing hands wearing masks ""strong immune system"" fair allow something like create big group sick people going go harm innocent people community actually making sacrifices daily lives protect others.

Imagine staying home, wearing mask, sanitizing hands regularly, hanging friends, going work grocery shopping, still getting sick someone went rally touched ramen buying next week. Well well, cases doubled. real, UK shut rest year right. It’s late us U.S. anyway lol slow motion working pretty well France, assume lot countries world. Children 11 wear masks adapted rather quickly distancing. someone works elementary school say expected worst month half initial hassle setting everything working smoothly. course frustrating younger ones even I've impressed understanding situation creativity make it. Higher education count less people think. I've met many people degrees smart many people PhD geniuses field total idiots rest Wait, hospitals performing elective surgery pandemic?? big thing US? Germany wear face mask public transit inside store everyone fucking it.

Sure, protests conspiracy theorists, haven’t seen anyone without mask store two months. Aww man, planning visiting grandmother Poland. haven’t seen five years she’s getting younger. also wanted make citizenship official. yes moral ramifications anything happening back *then.* war again? bravery? Avery? can’t quite remember got eventually. Pls no, want outta here!  ‘People color’ completely wrong. scientists limited understanding model used would careful wrote. try predict behaviour based limited data fitting.

source: I'm one implemented model use, Taiwan exactly three dictators switching democracy. One definitely malevolent, others somewhat questionable.

CCK probably benevolent one mind, ostensibly end white terror era. politically lenient? Formosa incident happened rule, questionable occurrences happened 80s, 陳文成 incident 江南案 examples.

As Lee, credit given do, give much credit undermines role events Tiemanmen Wild Lily plays process. end 80s, dictatorial rule KMT out. say Lee choose crush protests, social conditions time would allow either.

In all, Taiwan one dictator (questionably) benevolent toward end reign, one benevolent alternative. hardly series. healthcare lose job. Double whammy. Google.com really whole mask enforcement bandana isn’t really virus barrier mask? What’s point implementing policy isn’t really affective. 

I’ve people cough face thinking it’s okay wearing “mask.” Nah bruh, wearing bandana face virus smaller stitching face “mask.”

All time state government recommending using medical grade face masks hospitals need do. Uhh don’t use could end hospital. So, feel whole thing now? trying give flak, curious. insane good know Europe opens borders first juli Americans allowed in. mean that's EU for. Economically strong countries band together weaker countries actual voice international politics.

* Soviet rule \~45 years

* low fertility rate

You simply can't compare country like US, threatened homefront since civil war, \~150 years, size continent, abundant natural resources, river network east easily one best world, small European nation Nazi rule 6 years Soviet occupation 45 years like Poland example. first started we’ve electives since end April/beginning May Regardless leadership, also see many Americans blatantly disregarding recommendations guidelines. Maybe past. 

Exemptions US citizen longer apply anything post-Covid world. single Houston hospital comes #20 hospitals US. NYC, Los Angeles, Boston appearing frequently. think USA states like equivalent countries EU. both? attempted mass negligent homocide, supporters support mass negligent homocide. borders Canada also remain closed least end July probably later. Hey, France told student apply visa starting 1 july students world ;) like stubbornness recklessness. adjectives charitable. Could anyone please compare many deaths&amp;cases U.S. compared Europe Continent. fair comparison course can’t. they’re also saying member country allowing passengers countries face border checks neighbors. 5% reported* I'm willing bet true total number infected people much higher point given fast spread. care. cared anyone else first place, happening. can’t stop people leaving Canada. would unprecedented illegal. fact it’s exactly North Korea does. Controlling borders means keeping Americans we’re currently doing. track here, state give example company please? Damn Micah! Surely, rest world follow also? 

Can see scenario countries recover, America full lockdown many years, virus control, believing magical cure arrive day. Yeah point take mask wear whenever inside, see mask harm good 109, people would collapse states Australia locked borders other, states fucking huge compared NY. mean expect people gloom doom slight uptick sickness deaths? would expect panic this? Yes it’s serious. gunna take hell lot .001% population get panic reaction people. That's funniest shit read day. ever seen news US? leaders trapped drowning car they'd die arguing turning windscreen wipers. top guy hit ground fell plane. Protesters shout

scientists found shouting singing spreads infectious droplets much 1.5m

and far found 3 cases BLM protests victoria alone

we don’t know many asymptomatics mild symptomatics caught didnt get tested, spreading around

&amp;#x200B;

plus ordinary families sacrificed weddings, funerals birthday gatherings looked mobs protesters reasonably concluded bother rules since protesters didn’t

&amp;#x200B;

either rules place everyone no-one

&amp;#x200B;

BLM brought plague back us health minister admitted didn’t work. also highway VMS NJDOT message Flatten Curve think ""lecturing"". Especially since EU US phase pandemic makes comparisons hard anyways. high infection rate significant community spread country, would bad idea restrict travel certain degree. I've already outline Italian problem another post. also displeasure figure treat serious condition cases blindfolded blindsided first hit large scale. Saying Italy handle well wrong though, difference amount human lives lost saved outcome oriented view wrong. Saying failure government however incorrect - different starting point task difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

The model counter measures however really come Italy though. measures could've put place quicker (especially canceling large gatherings like Starkbierfeste massive hot spots shielding elderly care homes right away) hindsight effective especially health care system better prepared general, point patients countries brought treatment. I'd say B- thus far, Tönnies Armin Laschet shit show though evaluation might downgraded. insane I'm bit taller 5'11 felt like hobbit. Every man least 6'2 something  He's right though.

Whilst like Google Facebook core workers Ireland (and went tax handicaps) many others ""fachade"" HQs much bigger (and important) work forces countries (amazon paypal Germany, Microsoft France) etc etc. calm tone man.  agree people need told govt theyre dumb. wear mask , protect others . 

but CA, w skyrocketing numbers, death toll 5200. 2700 deaths nursing home deaths. couple hundred jail deaths. go detail. 15 Caucasian people aged 18-40 died coronavirus CA. Also, explanation Underlying conditions given. maybe previous disease? CDC states IFR 0.05 anyone 50. get people careless. Also, it;s tough believe CDC royally messing like have. agree people need mask people also tired pissed. hope feel better soon. read also also read peak November also peak different times different locations.

But understand peak decline strong social distancing measures required. happened China, Italy, Spain, France lesser extent UK. Without measures (extended severe 2 1/2 month lockdowns) possible numbers drop?

The factor could cause numbers drop would high rates (as high 70+ % ) immunity community. However countries already hit hard show immunity greater 12-15% often low 7-8%. Herd immunity alot uncertainity ... well explained article -  need medical care, get $1m bill, right? number actually bad. maybe around 200k. it’s actually success comparing countries. 

The problem treat people. It’s awful see mother dragged away poor boy. see lot grocery store couples woman wearing mask, man isn’t. guy saying he’s Ireland _saw eyes_ they’re shell companies there’s tech industry Ireland... lol racist though, consistently proudly. ok; gov giving us 4000$ tax credits travel within states, we'll keep running state state, infecting other. Problem solved, economy saved? Honestly, good Maine. someone Mass nice see one neighbors completely ravaged.

Unfortunately also means people Maine still refusing take seriously. uncle cousins keep badgering come visit them, refuse acknowledge mandatory 2 week quarantine. think running graves concern here. Look turntables. Tests work reliable certain stages infection. PCA test throat swipe AFAIK works best early super early stages infection. Later infection moves throat lungs. simple throat swipe often reliably detect anymore. People got infected example entering plane airport also tested reliable results. get worse. Much worse. We've NM. unfortunately, can't shut state borders without Texans living near stateline causing sort uproar able get closer Wal-Mart.  


And I've lived alone ever since moving area SoCal back 2012. Like poster said Sweden, lots people living alone possibly keeping themselves. One big cultural thing I've noticed never gotten used moving SoCal area rural NM sociable people are. Never made many friends since living mainly go work home. people work(I'm trucker) try make conversation befriend much possible, less try shut friendly possible. Thus one comes house surprise. observed random people showing houses street visit possibly friends family this. Lots Texas plates parked various houses here.  


The social activities take place cities even less canceled. I've following precautions, staying masked avoiding crowds people much possible. several months hypochondriac mode may go get tested personal piece mind, I'd like think I've done maintaining work home life. 


That said, finally form control(I'm guessing 1-2 years least), I'm either moving remote part NM, CO around Front Range. Get far away Texas stateline least. Even pandemic, really care much living close proximity it. want venture away it. close get ""fleeing country"" without fleeing country. children's lives

LOL. Like children going die. read bar chart? Americans hate science. distrust intellectuals. think statistics losers ands nerds.


It idiocracy always go controversial get actual contextualization dad early 60s. He's fantastic shape brother joke he'd probably better us caught it. Still convinced wear mask shopping (he n95s he's contractor). ongoing health problems reported recently covid 19 he's actually started take quite seriously.  Elections July cant afford it. Jun 18, 2020 Christ also recommended healthcare providers prioritize patients get tested. Anyone gets tested must experiencing symptoms. quite possible true. lot hospitals specialize certain procedures become known good care medical practices around niche. Avoid people, wear mask pray.

Well least top dog statistic school shootings. third Americans think news don’t like fake news. heard redneck call covid “fake virus” today ranted wear mask grocery store. Trump war news. Nah that’s overstating it. Celtics fell 90s many decades unmatched league dominance (16 titles - rivaled LA). Sox championship drought, yes, frequently competitive made multiple WS runs (usually heartbreak end). Bruins also share success. team longstanding joke would’ve Pats, even made couple SBs competitive Parcels/Carroll regimes mid-late 90s. course nothing match past 20 years, unless you’re focusing early 90s, it’s fair say city’s sports teams joke pre 2000.

Well sucks, cant say blame them. said got hit US, well coordinated federal effort stamp out.

That's exactly American mindset got us/you (I'm foreigner living US sure us appropriate lmao).  need mate show around town let know (I Amsterdammer) Considering many tourists come NYC many people commute nearby states would rather strange spread nyc. new Yorkers commuters  fucking stupid bc servers bartenders can't make money people stay home. anything fucks us bc semi aware people might listen we'll stuck nontipping entitled orange lipped jagoffs New Yorker here.

It's nuts. whole ""I'll fine - 99.9% people fine"" thing far reality. dead mean fine. 

Sorry husband. sucks. I've going walks slowly build back up. China gave us two month head start figure nothing truly cannot blame them. makes sad, many places Europe love would love re-visit.

I guess I'm glad made life goal 100 countries (and some) hit? Illinois started one worst outbreaks, following guidelines, emerged one biggest reductions we're safely moving Phase 4 state plan.

Texas, Arizona Florida, among others, rejected guidelines seeing incredible surges.

Maybe listening experts good idea all. Less people capable infected ""indefinitely""?

/sssss Good counter-point; appreciate intelligent discussion. yet, we're using people treat save lives others.

EDIT: sub downvoting using convalescent plasma therapy. Inconvenient truths. I've seen 15% reported. Many asymptomatic tested get symptoms later. want point term flouting law, flaunting this, many articles used. Brazil normal flu season now. expect see similar unrestrained growth patterns US starting fall.  Id like remind anyone know trump administration [a pandemic early 2019 predicted exact shortcomings facing principle different. It’s literally exact same, adapted new environment. It’s environment changed, principle.

By way, taken time read article yet? first consider holding current administration accountable? here, remember EU complaining US travel ban... oh, irony! play disc golf put unique position. limited tourneys ones strict. buddy lives middle state play state work allow travel. restrictions except work NH play two states Buddy think there’s herd immunity here, maybe need math lesson. Even unreported rate 10 fold - 8th population would immunity. Lol everyone knows problems.

Yeah stay home. it’s ok imo people hang they’re cautious it, contact, aware covid rates area certain low well decline area measures place contact tracing. I’ve friends family cookouts, work healthcare. I’m certain facilities haven’t cases month county almost cases well. Shoot virus ask questions later. I'm not, know real, I'm seeing it. I've 3 hospitals already, well one barely south Houston al know Mom prefers [Love 1 friend positive case, I've texted tines response. hope he's ok Texas 🤞🏼 articles getting misleading. Coronavirus deaths dropped 90% since peak US. Also know US focuses total deaths rather deaths per capita. deaths per capita far lower many countries already reopened. us also bad way counting cases. include people tested, presumed it. long can't get disease virus causes, people good fucking dumb can't stop them. Boy, guys really don’t understand EU, you? That’s suggestions, every nation rules. UK Sweden banned several nations, (for example Germany). thing happened first surge “lots cases lot deaths”.... month later wave deaths hit.

Cases plateaued US while, Seems deaths trail new cases several weeks. I’d imagine couple weeks we’ll see deaths start rise Unfortunately, yes. cases go away. Hot damn. Seriously? That's ridiculous. They'll never know bad late general US complaint. I’m Texas. People don’t give shit here. p-resident. story. Wait till Fall we’ll see smart Europe  petitions actually work? parts USA (f.e.

We well. 
 Less 9m people half countries cases(54k/102k), Montreal even worse less 2 million people 1/4 countries cases (27k) 
At point embarrassing farther get sound direction, really. I’ve seen confederate flags way Morton way Westport. great. Meanwhile, New Zealand, Vietnam, Singapore, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Germany get semblance normal life, cause shut down/quarantine need(ed) to, wearing masks, contact tracing, provide affordable healthcare. work medical field us travel weekly. state rules excluded essential employees. 

Hey, I’ll hop hospital hospital every week. could go wrong? sure track pneumonia deaths specifically (and that’s tricky bc deaths recorded covid pneumonia). don’t exceptional unaccounted excess mortality [compared states though.

I think Florida managed avoid getting hit early placing restrictions. reopened without good plan forced face influx cases. concur, 90% people wear masks local grocery stores Upper Michigan. Proud us Yoopers except 10%. There’s strong sense community U.P. even though we’re rural. “Yooper Strong” motto see posted everywhere businesses homes. along Governor’s orders kept cases less 200 far (out 300k people). 10 cases past 2 weeks. Wish could close borders Wisconsin (don’t get offended) Lower Michigan lol...shut bridge! located? I've seen near 100% mask compliance indoors mid-Hudson Valley. Outside, less so, science seem support heavy transmission strangers outdoors. Guys don’t ban AirPods lmao Yes, EU passport welcome commonly believed seat belt would trap car burst flames

Even though grew world seatbelt usage normalized, fear actually makes sense me. strap holding down. restricts movement. see would make someone feel claustrophobic, especially used freedom movement first decades driving.

Whereas masks, can't imagine downside. Like, small hassle carry around me, trigger subconscious fear. average person decides behave rationally.

I saw interview market researcher said biggest issue politicized bei g symbol weakness seen ""patriotically protecting homeland"" almost everyone would wear proudly. really understand exception Alaska travels. mean, would rude cut USA two, sure, like entire response, account by, say, designating specialized charter busses bus people Alaska back cooperation US government, passengers remain safely isolated rest Canada. Instead, banked good nature people exactly say, drive Alaska without contacting Canadians along way.

Betting good nature people turned failing strategy, proving optimal either. Fun fact, per capita death rate italy 2x per capita death rate US. european countries fraction population, that's reason fairing better covid  conceivable lock Texas least Harris County? happening Houston seems like right horror flick. ready copy paste finally find way painlessly kill delivering doordash orders earlier, truth, absolutely Panic going people relaxed ambulances moving.. People smiling friendly, tell anything going on..(this hospitals) No, brain reality. president child. Canada it’s citizens trying less less depend America. depending Mexico lot. 

Your country torn protests lasted 4 weeks. citizens believe okay go rallies. also citizens believe guns answer. police. Yep, country perfectly fine /s  US travelers biggest touristic money maker. wouldn’t even dare lol ...maybe Lehman Brothers example. I'm convinced measures temporary feel like we've entered realm people believe reducing pregnancy testing way reduce birth rate. makes head hurt... Hopefully EU (and non-EU especially UK) allow travel US August. theme park lover supposed Disney weeks ago (vacation planned paid back February), say Disney reopening correctly possible. Universal, Sea World, theme parks opened immediately, Disney delayed opening month week July 4th avoid mass crowds holiday. absolutely requiring masks, park entrance extremely limited. Basically, already ticket March, going year. firework night shows cancelled avoid crowds, removing old security checks favor contact less security, away cash transactions much possible, limiting many people come park hour, allowing go park park before, closing indoor shows, distance character greets, contact hotel check in, contact food ordering menus smartphone, buffets, cleaning sterilizing tables chairs letting sit least two minutes guests. Hotels limited get stay limited resorts order focus keeping resorts clean. ghost town guests get go, definitely unique experience, Disney like we've seen before. like Univeral today could get park ticket go next week. allowing people already paid choose still go limited experience year. Many people already cancelling too. 

That said, Florida cases rise think anticipated, I'm worried workers too. Gonna go limb say I’ve heard friends EU, response overall wasn’t much better. 

The US actually accessible testing right many EU countries. 

But travel restrictions right move right near future; world needs bit time reduce impact second wave infections. people stupid interpreted low numbers resulted lockdown meaning virus big deal deadly everyone thought. especially true live AZ, numbers skyrocketed since reopening. even now, deaths lag cases (and CDC says much 21-28 days diagnosis death), people still saying stupid things, like ""Oh, deaths low right virus weakening."" I'm furious, family gone anywhere since beginning March people street playdates big parties BBQs. GAH!!! British Columbia done incredible job. See No, without fix end date. corona rules EU fix end dates. situation US control two months end date. effective transmission rate remains 1.0 (I believe it’s close lower 1.0), somewhere 30% (probably significantly lower) population infected reach effective herd immunity. means you’d cases pop disease would longer host pool gain traction. Note however could take years still. Probably true. They're giants. That's fine, could go punching one idiots. chinas fault better ban people too. trying keep social distance Belgrade night club Indefinitely?!? Fuck.

What family that's sea month? quarantined outside EU US?  People really asses FL - isolating Motel 6 (first mistake) arriving NYC (I came quarantine family instead staying shelter North anymore - I'm one fools ignoring spike still summer vacay) got much attitude asking room service wear masks (which ultimately still didn't). Reported corporate checked early doctor confirming waited long enough clear anyways. fucking kidding me? Austin Public Health free testing, wait time schedule appointment 7+ days, though, turnaround time ~4 days. time schedule test get results back, already completed 14-day quarantine. literally work agency pushing guidelines (not LA County close by) force us back office. jobs 100% done home. It’s insane. tell quarantine won’t actually enforce it. someone lives AZ maybe cases go fall temperature goes less people stuck inside, yeah shit hitting fan get “please make sure wear mask!” live US wod ban us too, ngl makes thankful still EU citizenship 😢 I've scrap international travel bring work back home. hope travel later quarters year, people demanded opening rather safety net screwed up. damn! Well-behaved Americans rarely make history would get onboard broad testing whatever measures seem implementing there. seem much less restrictive personal freedoms here.  irony China list :). me. feel like odd man wearing mask. get looks feels uncomfortable. stop going Walmart never see hand sanitizer wipes clean hands cart go come out. saw news liquor licenses revoked people still keeping exact bars open.

He will. become politically untenable maintain current course. 

The problem locking hard right order get things back control. 2 week lockdown pharmacies grocery stores open along Statewide mask mandate actually enforced fines/jail.

That time spent isolating cases tracing contacts. virus go away rather quickly firm measures implemented.

Unfortunately, Abbott take half-measures public warnings lockdown absolutely occur hospitals become overloaded. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

Get wall built made much (nonexistent) “progress” despite billions spent /s got easy first lulled false sense security virus slowly spreading quarantine. Lack testing meant 100% cases identified, state re-opened overall cases, areas, means spread exponentially faster before. horrifying reason writers black mirror speculate, masks social distancing become taboo. Regardless people think Fauci, he’s one toughest positions imaginable. must hear eggshells crack every step takes. One sane voices left. England? apart this? figure feel sick need I’ve quarantining pretty hard, still moments *could* contracted it: bicyclists/joggers pass closely, picking go orders, etc. Also, like someone else mentioned, virus contagious 24-48 hours symptoms begin. 

Because can’t absolutely guarantee I’m contagious (maybe presymptomatic real possible exposures), wear mask (which cheap little uncomfortable).

So, 100% sure don’t coronavirus won’t accidentally pass someone else? build big wall block anti science trump people please?

And make pay highly doubt anti-vaxxers problem, vaccination becomes requirement attending concerts, festivals, clubs similar places, unlikely.

I would probably get shot lifestyle includes many interactions outside social circle, therefore infection-risk quite high. still mandatory vaccines, again, anti-vaxxers country anyway. one box mushrooms time jump Nemo building. /s/ think tourist jumped from. cannot remember year people took many mushrooms, banned dry ones, nasty stuff. Um Germany‘s states similar US states. Like US Germany federal republic made 16 Bundesländer (States) federal government Berlin. 
Not every European country like that, actually, absolutely countries work like US around world Europe.  Man nearly dies COVID-19, see danger he's doing.

Then? getting reins control, let horses run wild are.

Imagine 1 million dollar bill hospitalization due pandemic country little concern getting control? Crazy.

Reopening, allowing BLM protests — despite obvious greater threat covid19 (and particular minorities, statistics).

I’m praying make indefinite border closure chaos.

- Concerned Canadian. Hey America! Look! That's it! rather Charles Michel charge foreign policy EU right ? What’s frustrating amount ignorance people think get covid handling cardboard box shipped across world. Nice get tell fiancée can’t get married now. Yes, ""viral load"" affect severity response: ""The amount particles person exposed affect likely become infected and, infected, severe symptoms become."" Source: Source? Earlier lockdown, sooner spike. virus spreads easily thought it’s inevitable. Locking inevitably lead speak begin ease. Essentially way avoid herd immunity vaccine. They’ll call like important thing, South Dakota we’re still going Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. Big caldron potential infection disperse across entire country. 4th July, Trump Governor planning fireworks Mount Rushmore extremely flammable pine forest. Wtf literally Covid right could not
Imagine getting haircut. talking based shitty felt, don’t want trash human level outbreak, universal mask usage probably enough prevent spread. Lower rate growth, sure, actually lower total cases. Charles Michel charge foreign policy rather Von Der Leyen ? it, deflection Thank you! lot there? economy magical thing start stop whenever want. 

it's rich white dudes, rich Jews, wasps. 

it's average person needing feed themselves. can, clue said can't, available many supermarkets. already started Texas - removing Gov sponsored testing sites state end month. (Read today.)

Less tests = less cases.

He won!

It’s easy plot moves making. keeping public constant state confusion awhile. Pretty classic. Much easier control way.

There’s book this: public manipulated: crowd manipulation: tactics sound familiar? able successfully go dark testing data... Thankfully hospital data go by... ban hospitals sharing info. leaning towards fact see happen, least attempt, starting state levels coming know who. Sound crazy? Look right now. 

Basically need create full white ensure US public idea bad virus to...

1. Keep stock market going election
2. election
3. ego
4. election
5. power
6. control
7. move agenda(s) forward

So... I’m kinda getting page Gov done, doing, gearing nothing short murder citizens... think enough people wide awake (FINALLY) take stand justice, life, America knew many years ago. need fucking country back. It’s getting destroyed right front us. It’s sickening.

For awhile thought massive twitter campaign 200 million posts (psychological warfare US citizens) wearing masks, fighting freedom open country, fueling even starting protests, etc.) another country try make virus spread US. I’m sure behind outside US catch drift. many things pointing wrong direction and, well, social campaigns (including latest Facebook wearing masks) are... here? crazy even think that? Let’s forget governor fired entire epidemiological modeling team right re-opening. team probably tried tell would happen said fuck it, opened anyway, fired them.

Nothing going stop now. They’ve hit exponential growth stage it’s going really bad. 😢 [Utah essentially could infected (from wife) likely test negative don’t symptoms yet. Poor leadership brought US knees! Wait no! lack good leadership it! hey Bang Kii-Moon? tell guy... everyone politicized issue begin fine.  careful finding get back (with without quarantine) travel. think Americans able afford it? 🤔 sounds like trust worth something. hey everybody, us unemployment minimum 3 work searches week continue recieving payments! fantastic time reinstate :)))) flight yet. still house contend with--hard get materials planning deadlines/end date challenging. husband wants visit July bring cats least permanently waiting Apostille limbo-land--and course direct flights, cat documentation timelines. hope success move! we’ll skip part get right “fall the...” extremely low number cases. wearing masks (everyone everywhere should) that's complete picture.

That change see big problem, there's low number cases, yearning reopen economy necessary tourist dollars mainland swimming stupid coronavirus. I’m Canada. yes, neighbours financially cared eating well. people know actually much better financially CERB payments covering bills also don’t pay closed daycares longer paying trips out.

Japan much different culture America. Even ranking accurate, Canada didnt even make top 10? spent grand PPE wife team.  every N95 could find January, hospital rough go getting enough even now.

I'm southeast Texas definitely business usual here... Also, Abbott tell people stay home reopen businesses state safety policies place? make sense. would make sense top 20% people, top 1% people. ""*Shortly hearing began, Mr. T\_r\_ump* [*used Twitter *that getting credit response virus, noting Dr. Fauci, “who us ways,” “a high 72% Approval rating” — much higher president’s, stands around 41 percent.* ""

although disagree. economy benefits everyone. Sure game rigged rich, I'd prefer work 9-5 live relative luxury average American life. allowed people used isolated fringe find easily New Orleans representing here! blame workers people farms? Pretty simple - serology method used produced similar result. Lol people replying never fight before.

To fair neither I. romanticize (1) shitty (2) would get ass kicked. question testing criteria? good contact tracing measures limit Community spread ok test everyone wants tested. great capacity testing test everyone wants tested. can't find number executed tests Germany either, shame agree really interessting number.
For hospitalization need careful comparing data due differences system. average EU country social benefits like free healthcare paid sick leave might screw comparison people likely go hospital stay longer (covid else). Things like mix age categories per country also vary much. 
Still agree comparable data would extremly benefitial highligts differences evaluated. math nerd would love good set KPIs calculation quality everywhere.

Excellent point, contradict ""wearing masks helps""? proof that, group think says so, one study proves this.

""Karen's"" ""feel"" wearing mask decreases oxygen intake ""fact"" causing real damage breathing, respect tell ""we"" doing. :) current growth, especially since many tests still lagging 2 weeks per Houston major yesterday (I think yesterday, maybe day before) say need least 30-day hard lockdown followed slow opening mandatory masks get control.

I agree this. Houston different beast right rest State. example benevolent dictator would Spain Spanish king successor Franco installed democracy. Franco evil core though. people say “If learned one thing, it’s don’t know anything.”

Hope works get back! happened France. surprised quite bit, there's one western country that's known protesting whatever government says sheer principle, France.

  Note diseases poorer tropical sub-tropical areas. Sadly, virus put world knees economically going go entire world's attention it. I, personally, think focus dedication research one diseases much diligence looking COVID19 vaccine, would done already. I'm curious too. arrived Ireland year working visa course still US passport. think we're going travel country time soon wonder would denied entry even I'm coming another EU country.  confusing stance

Dumb people like feel smart. agree. feel bad may get opportunity. I've come know several Muslim families past year certainly going difficult news. see opposite. mask face, sensitive part body. Something touches face react.

I always thought seatbelt issue partly due bad habits partly due many americans fat uncomfortable wear. Racists like think people racists too. important distinction limited testing NYC april due lack testing equipment, global production hadnt yet ramped enough meet demand. It’s understanding lax testing AZ limiting factors lack political will. That’s frustrating hear “more tests = cases” argument, completely short sighted backwards.

NYC huge outbreak undetected, 3 weeks april positive rate 30%. ramped testing, enacted quarantine contact traced went steadily continuously, positive rate single digits falling 2 consecutive months now. 

In contrast, lots midwestern states relatively easy early on, didnt take seriously enough begin with. Case numbers still slowly increased, testing didnt increase enough detect it. they’ve lifted quarantine measures, masks become taboo horrifying degree, virus spread much faster already spreading community, testing isn’t sufficient, tracing fail well. end day, lack testing actually helps virus spread. smart enough use internet smart enough spot hypocrisy. reason say ""what thinking"" simply longer think, automatically post feel get up-vote others think.

Zero attention span. current growth, especially since many tests still lagging per Houston major yesterday (I think yesterday, maybe day before) say need least 30-day hard lockdown followed slow opening mandatory masks get control. even then, would need aggressive testing, contact tracing, 14-day quarantines exposed. Nothing new - it’s model existed 100% proven work again.

Frankly, strong SAH orders line defense right now. day passes don’t (in counties surging, entire state, course) compounds problem many, many times over. end control several areas. Well, culture masks ‘lame’ ‘liberal hoax’ least significant part equation imo Except none options ever happen. British royalty quite cozy pensions know step far might history face - ever learned? basically go social welfare stripped wealth. Habsburgs faced similar situation 1918 enough money lingering outside Austria become poor. Well... could still get worse November on... One hope People definitely want wear masks here. Germany EU, member EU. That's like saying Germany OECD lol. Anyways thing counts deaths per capita. countries Europe worst respect. Yep, late. bed. Fixed.  Design major. Nothing contemporary art, museums time life. came around totally unplanned. sort happened church needs close building go livestreamed service. Safer husband, too. stock market collapse again. Even pumped full money actual economy catch it’s going while. it’s far widespread quarantines first began, spread exponentially faster. Couple masks taboo liberal hoax wad bound happen. someone known ... hell, hope Greg Abbott burns murdering population mass scale. Make masks gun logos Hind sight 20/20 yet thats average sight. 10/20 must hell year. bad sounds, happy feed back task reporting Coronavirus again. taken back seat reddit algorithm while. shove head ass next time feel urge lecture others country. simply posted thinking scared write.

How would know ""what thinking""? Seems presumptuous. Please remember majority Houstonians want economy re-opened exactly reason. Lina Hidalgo's stay-at-home orders helping contain virus Greg Abbott stepped ruined things re-opening state early. Greg Abbott one needs learn, Houstonians ones punished. droplets heavy hang air

It hang air masks worn already sick

Everyone wear masks. wear condom every time enter store, damnit Sorry buddy. know metric system knowledge bit rusty since use imperial system, 1m 39”. social distancing us 6’. Little less 2m. Seriously. Living USA feels like intellectual claustrophobia. I'm saying problem eventually, Hawaii taken strict measures restrict travel tourism order halt spread.

We'll see turns out, position could restrict tourism mainland opening travel Canada/Japan/NZ etc. North America I’m guessing? Stepped who? EU formed economic political reasons. Oh also, *United* states united? Hannity said Florida would stay 2k deaths tremendous job governor doing. Oh my, isn’t good news. I’m booked go LHR BKK via DBX end August ... booked Emirates thinking could trust standards. feel weird wearing seatbelt. 85 long time ago btw. I'd interested number changed. people can't accept others better are.

""I got 30, get 85?""

I've seen kind silly rhetoric western media troll mouths

Let tell why, study trying get 85 test?

have dream  state, MN, age distribution bell graph ages 30-40 top bell. Basically looks like age demographics virus matches normal age distribution. People color likely it, also likely live city virus hits hardest. I'm trying say nobody susceptible getting anyone else. 

Just looked death rates. US 0.054%. France 0.142%. Germany 0.047%. Spain 0.113%.

So point there. could probably say many countries, France, almost double reported.

One thing though, look graph timeline infections, France went huge peak almost 0, whereas US' graph way erratic. see countries would worried us. Another point states like Oklahoma still peaking out, really bad news. 

However, (sorry getting long) countries Mexico also peaking right now, Europe including ban. 

So guess conclusion EU reason concerned US, I'm sure including countries Mexico.. unless countries already banned? Idk. No.

Once every two weeks, even month.

Not great, fuck it, I’d it. Yep reason pissed, unannounced unilateral decision. Wish best well - we'll get this. Maybe little worse wear we'll get this. US quarantine effective. Every state whatever wants lmao. EU made good decision.

FREUDE Springfield-Greene County Health Department encouraged report incubation period passed potentially exposed Great Clips. clients either stylist additional coworkers contracted COVID-19 result. stylists tested positive working Great Clips 1864 S. Glenstone Ave, potentially exposing 140 clients six coworkers. additional clients coworkers tested positive. offered potentially exposed, 46 people pursued testing—all came back negative. Regardless testing, potentially exposed quarantined duration exposure period. likely 94 people total unknowns know about. possible got asymptomatic though. funny thing is, preserving patients' privacy relatively easy purpose - (1) obtain consent people agree shown, and/or (2) blur faces IDs, (3) final video vetted personnel responsible confidentiality. 

It's work much trouble days (with ML-assisted face recognition+blurring available like Google Street View). I’m pass it’s 2am wanted say we’re arguing, it’s discussion haha. I’m you, I’m saying link sucked here’s better one use haha boyfriend apart almost five months now. American he's British. way continue together five years get married chat us banned entering enter tourist moment can't get married tourist visa there. honestly know do. miss much. Heck even ask countries like Australia Canada go eat her. follow antother thing. Came say exactly paramedic, wearing either half mask full mask past months. 

I truly shocked many hospital managements know NIOSH P100 is. Right you. Unfortunately, teenager always lived Arizona can't imagine living anywhere else. wait least college get hell dodge. Really? I'm WA. stopped employee door kindly grab mask entering. Remember common cold viruses, bacteria, fungi allergens still exist!

Also, need tell boss getting tested? positive, let know ASAP exposed. Dexamethasone used pretty often prior study, standard care.

It's cheap widely available drug, easy incorporate standard treatment. Funny gasped shock 3000 daily cases back then. Yeah lethal feared back then. Also contagiousness high, lot less early estimates were. Mainland Taiwan jelly. offering free tests Wisconsin, sure still Still 400 poeple go onto pass virus, like wildfire. Uhhh they’ve reopening wtf talking about. actually identical kinetic theory reaction rates. states loosening restrictions quickly without enforced mandatory masks gambling law physics - lose. again, much help one wearing it..

I'm sure I'm saying anything know already, protect getting infected; stops spreading others. Whats even mpre insane companies like mine arent listeningnto local governments. reopening, one directors even saying Covid isnt big deal state hasnt changed stance reopening... Increased testing full answer. due increased testing would see % positive tests go down, clearly going - around 4-6% couple weeks ago, they're around 14-18% positive. or...more progressive?

Again, would matter? original comment purely political Ideally, yes. However, think system institutionalized embedded American society even incremental changes seem much ask for. Especially given current circumstances polarisation unfortunately seems fruitful bringing people together. feel bad neighbors. daily house walk pass several apartments got pink notices. think ive seen like 30 something apartments get evicted. Im grateful husband still working wish didnt work travel industry. 

My biggest question “save economy” people dont legalize recreational use. People would stay home more. would jobs available country wide. snacks would ordered. scientists believe pot could help lessen effects corona. know abbot never hes total POS forever people see disability hes held state back progress. never voted abbot bc ive known along people figuring now. doesn’t care wants money. gave great trust healthcare workers Sweden.

Its claim believe would negative impacts patient outcomes, data support that.

What negative impact outcomes able proove? article gives data support position. True, tourism economy itself, too. Trumpf. big grave need bury 110,000 people? ""Is going away own"" shit Sherlock ✨ Don’t believe Mattis got suckered Theranos Yeah terribly mismanaged across board. Led course executove branch government, misinformation huge problem. big economy consumer focused even look like? 20% positive. Assume it, it, it. 

I live CFL feel despair hopelessness day every day go work ""essential"" job's office work done remotely.

I essential consulting services support utility companies cell providers... us office 100% company's owners undying love Trump nothing productivity necessity. Please mandate work home possible... somebody sane save us. It’s voluntary. must depend ethics individual owners, rock hard economic place.

The system set way intentionally. so, Mammon sacrifices.  spot coronavirus magnetic resonance? ever watch car accident making, think oo would turn little left.. it?

That feel like, except know I'm blast radius. Sweden odd exceeded death estimates fallen well short goals far infection percentage. said avoided several months depression exchange percentage 222 deaths. hard time arguing proved points. went back steam library started playing South Park Stick Truth. omg funny Yeah makes sense all. working ""front lines"" still think fake? ""cool"" thing concerned anymore. Early people talked we're spreading info constantly. people (appropriately) motivated bring light BLM movement, I've also noticed fading coverage discussion sadly, stopped talking COVID. Stuff started reopen people act like over.

The latest ""trend"" discussed fact Trump back campaign trail, COVID sprinkled there.

July bring something else new people move new movements/concerns, anything gets resolved. Maybe. don’t give enough credit know city enough trolls. think local yahoos. least time he's actually doubling statement lol could. choose spend money elsewhere. look Samuel Little. killed upwards 93 people, essentially got slap wrist dozens crimes. even charged two murders early 1980s served time.

I mean, United States treats Black people unfairly justice system, guy go free can't believe figured stop testing, mean much testing makes much Covid-19. basic medicine stuff. ~ trumper Tbh actually think real motivation behind what's happened today anything unjust everything terms racism . actually unjust past yet see anything like since back mlk jr days.

People nothing else since lost jobs, they've bored death locked inside. they've angry time now. racism divide rich poor grown drastically past decade. Housing costs skyrocketed. people already angry system prior even thinking racism.

The Lloyd incident game channel emotions already feeling inside. We're bunch animals let emotion overide reason. Can't disagree that. bigger joke White House. riots this?  someone give English sparknotes version Need protests get numbers up. MSM active getting people protesting again. Classic News letting us down. No, shut everything now, it'll peak 12 days, idiots would say ""SEE NOTHING STOP INFRINGING RIGHTS"". Oh sure, madness alone country 10mn odd. means table option, rest team decides they're going different way, go way stubborn.

That's absolute shame Sweden here, making situation much complicated everyone stubbornness.

Good hear they're adopting techniques least, even though ends giving misleading data points effective policy wasn't, save face. Yep, too. ""Karen wants haircut lol"" dumb meme focuses loudest/most annoying anti-lockdown people. MI ftw. Didn’t extend cares act unemployment insurance another 13 weeks? still provide studies back statement. Anything align preconceived opinion “cherrypicking”? Lol ok Flu season related bird migration (who harbor transmit virus) particular temperature. Indeed, San Francisco area fine job. Eviction, followed foreclosures, followed abandonments, followed real estate crash. That's lockdowns people get.

You can't shield economy Covid fear.

You short term cut Covid lower fear quicker recovery long term.

You let Covid run uncontrolled short long term make long term mass death longer term societal trauma, distrust, panic, fear.  mama mama! Correct. problem lag positive tests hospitalizations, focusing hospitalizations give us mich time prepare.

The ""testing people"" narrative also easily dispelled seeing testing increased much past weeks percentage positive tests going up. people come around simple logic want convinced. got joke right? Anything man says becomes headline. course hasn’t seen last 40 years! one has, live damn planet. believe they've testing China steps think did. Gottlieb said ""again"", title getting cumbersome left out. Oh yeah trying accuse anything either ^^ ^^ 

True, think funny seem go ""unpunished"".

But ofc also understand would ban travel countries still battling it. 

I also think ""indefinitely"" got somehow. recently go texas states long story short texas still backward laws.

Most states flashing signs telling wear masks, stay home, social distance. 

Texas signs tell leave children car unattended. Like good advice, dont understand people texas need unreasonably hot there. almost felt like blatantly ignoring coronavirus.  downvoted undeniable FACT hope man runs president next election easily spread way.

And three short months ago, wisdom airborne, ""droplet""; bother masks, wash hands--or use antibacterial gel, LOL.

The story transmission changes literally every two weeks. stops changing, I'll content age Amazon boxes days little ""quarantine zone."" packaged food, feel fine spending minute two rinsing plastic little soapy water get home. Seems like good use copious time have, eases anxiety little. mention hospitals go bankrupt don’t perform high-reimbursement surgeries like ortho surgeries. real chance see hospitals shut permanently end this. took close two months. I'm healthy 30s. friend lost three close relatives. Another lost parents. nice suffered. imagine nothing ever bad unless directly effected though. see great reduction cases. Since Trump mandated defunding public testing sites Texas month!

No tests=no positive cases! AmIRite guise? would things going past month would cause spike past two weeks. tide goes away see swimming naked. Uh no. list:

* MD Anderson number 1 nation Cancer
* Texas Children's number 3 nation 
* Methodist Hospital worldwide recognition cardiovascular surgery, cancer, epilepsy treatment, organ transplantation
* Shriners Hospital one best burn centers country
* UT Galveston runs GNL one 15 Biosafety Level 4 research centers US

The Texas Medical Center largest medical center entire world. contains 60 institutions, employs 100k people, treats 10 million patients year, pulls 25 billion dollars. also operated non-profit.

So yeah, Houston kind hub medicine. things, like heart surgery, best world DeBakey Cooley practicing. Meeting outside 6ft+ you, especially masks, less safe. Yes around anyone risk take proper precautions see reason stay home 24/7. Going hikes, walk street, etc fine distance people.

I hope sound like I'm minimizing things I'm not. obviously make decisions risk feel would good, people see take proper precautions, socialize bit. Good luck. Wear mask. Stay healthy. Also, media talks lot people struggling pay. talk ones can.

Well..yeah. seriously mystified deliberately obtuse? Ca might want shut direct eastern neighbors. 

Easiest path, effective immediately Az residents declared fruit vegetables longer allowed transport across state lines. Reopening. increased testing here. Brrr 

\- Burr Hey you. guy crazy. wanting clarify. I'm gonna keep back pocket insult. beautiful. CoVid-19: I'm 'Maga'nified now, Bitches!!! I'm A+, blame ❤ 

Stay well well death count Based findings, deaths list pneumonia cause 500% even 1,700+ covid deaths duplicated pneumonia still leaves well 3,000 pneumonia deaths aren’t attributed COVID given past trends huge anomaly. I'm Florida appreciate sympathy. worthless governor ordering health officials delete positive cases deaths! California 4x population Texas. sort point, going sorts extra trouble, trying catch it, end catching go anyway. People might care deadly is, hard convince people totally destroy personal lives, driving families complete financial economic ruin, virus 99% survival rate. Much 1% mortality even apply healthy, sober responsible people anyway. Maybe tiny risk careful? matter, going disappear day now. -Trump ™ That's called cargo cult lockdown. somewhat resembles one, said true lockdown. businesses still destroyed it. ""president"" certain states (red ones) making things much worse. live state locked first, anyone else. everyone uses masks here, see lot people wearing go grocery. We're one states mask mandate. I'm pissed bad apples spoiling rest bunch i.e. ruining everything rest us actually followed rules. negative effects ripple throughout community generations. Many families never truly recover. 

Drugs. Gangs. Prostitution. Desperate people desperate things. Chicago marathon still holding on. isn’t enhanced testing. tried morning schedule test. need prescription, don’t open time slots July, don’t answer phone. Hopefully, it’s allergies, conjunctivitis, mild cough, headache started yesterday. concern work retail care father. I’ve trying get urgent care (where pay test) without luck today Broward County.

All day afterwards mind still could process perfect moment - like, litereally, crazy old krone lives time-line thinks throwing shade - like medieval times crazy witch street blabbering nonsense somehow that's going change view?? absurd. understand disinformation campaign genuinely impressed effectiveness.  
I'm going go ahead get advice scientific community minion memes thanks. Could someone reverse psychology PSA/AD showing REAL President would crisis?

I'm going keep repeating interests helping fellow Americans guess never happen.

Trump slightly improve polls everyone tremendously base just:

1) Increases testing, health care home isolation funding.

2) Create actual jobs unemployed investing rebuilding infrastructure.

Those two things could help Americans polls numbers. He's far actions change people's minds November want suffering stop greatly eased. No!

This ridiculous. even kill. Sar-Cov established history permanent lung damage. time. Dont know stayed business long new solid brands market. Yeah - scientists throw word ""causal"" around willy nilly - far 'grain salt' material. Wtf bullshit? take long definitely agree this, live somerville outside people iffy wearing masks best people super conscious inside buildings.

It definitely everyone constantly wearing mask, though, seems much higher higher risky environments. Better source: 2018 shows rankings hospitals. med center really one best there. People fly sorts stuff time, even countries. 

Wikipedia also states TMC employs 100k people sees 10 million patients annually. largest world apparently heart surgeries world. people say TMC one best world, it’s true. depends wet are. bet there've 20 million infections USA already. Would make less worried? Don’t worry white supremacy totally deadly -people bitching memorial day He’s praying ~~gay~~ covid away, remember? Anyone didn’t pray hard enough. /s :( Yeah, remember every night ambulances racing day night. like eerily calm without now. hope never go back that. PSA: I'm confused iT’s fLu gUys majority would made excellent dictators allowed to

But not. that's point -- performing, set length time office removed, even avenues removal. Taiwan recently recalled one mayors poor performance breaking trust constituents one year office. Navajo Nation getting absolutely decimated this. represent 24 79 reported deaths, 30%. compare population size percentage deaths fucking horrifying. everyone saying “it’s getting better deaths decreasing”...

Deaths lagging indicator, rise stop denying virus’ spread dangerous control  Well-fucking-played sir. yield. categories article business customer facing own. mean I’m one protesting. black man I’m glad people are. Police racist issue specifically since teenager. base-4 shit (ง’̀-‘́)ง I'd disagree lot Houston residents going outside counties Harris County mask mandate many people think making someone wear mask unconstitutional government overreaching.

So think mask mandate going see spike counties around us spike Harris county due people wanting adhere social distancing protective masks. got response notification seemed well though I'm sad got removed. Someone else thread mentions using specific -ism type words responding triggers automod. maybe change repost. different situation months ago. know now, didnt then, nearly scary was, young healthy. Kinda important detail downvoted right. also would ""go away"" faster people wear masks herd immunity would develop quickly. What’s favorite chip? I’m big fan Ruffles Ridges they’re really salty. think don’t think I’ve years. diet kinda plain functional. Oklahoma. governor anti-vaxxer. We're fucked. large apartments? curious could get away charging 5k Silicon Valley. Honestly, gives fuck people dumb states wearing masks? Let suffer it, that's way dumb, redneck trash learn. Reopen save economy! OoooOOOooooOOOoooooooooopppss!! Yeah read too! impression work visa would get, would allowed enter. mean deaths starting increase again?

Source? Make sure adjust numbers people already dying pre-existing conditions, Hungary virus die instead. increased deaths. Nobody said businesses, we’re talking lockdowns effects, bud. First lockdown govt mandated wrecked economy. Second fear it’ll also wreck economy, regardless whether govt declares it. crippled get far unless drastic measures taken now.

Yeah, things get little worse, scale coming going blow people away. lockdown leaves Costco, Home Depot, Target open. good visual. Like yelling make little turn it’s safe can’t hear you’re drunk shouting monitor watching YouTube (or twitter) would safer stayed home. stop selfish stay home. Midwest getting wrecked current case growth, southern western states. Midwest, Chicago specifically, got hit real hard around time NYC did. Oh good! We're top 10?! What's prize?

When stuff start impact number people dying Covid? Literal LOL post. username True Detective reference? virus chops changes, moulds become political vehicle.

The sheer wishy washy attitude contradictions, backtracking government officials “experts” makes anything hard believe. Glory hogs! Come Michigan, gotta beat Florida we're going win race! property owners might looking sell right instead continuing rent. It’s much easier sell property empty one tenant lease. Alexa, play 'Mountains' Interstellar. Flu still kills people though. think okay kill grandmas every year want haircut? Yeah virus isn’t floating across landscape like mustard gas. stays people air exhale. Avoid wherever possible probably won’t get infected. Looks like reopening going well worry, approved ministry psuedoscience homeopathy. yup, although reach 40k new cases tomorrow 43k+ weekend. one cares. ""If measure it, exist!""

- logic Donald Trump Covid-19. No.

CoVID19 doesn’t give shit systemic racism 300 years injustice.

It put blacks hospitals whites, one time “now isn’t time” valid statement.

Yes protestors largely wearing masks outside, hours close contact everyone masking up.

So there’s viral particles air, given long enough exposure even wearing surgical masks person get infected.

I concerned indoor trump rallies individual points, protests national could lead many cases. Check Robin Hood app. anything stupid. HOUSTON PUBLIC MEDIA STAFF | POSTED JANUARY 11, 2018, 4:06 PM

Kind old posting, don’t put think? Open windows, take measures even you’re showing symptoms.

Opening windows really work Houston, parts east southeast TX. Temps already mid-to-upper 90s since early May, going way late September minimum. Nighttime temps tend drop much 80, either.

This entire region inhabitable central air conditioning. Yea players get daily testing get live bubble. workers clean bubble get fucked I'd vote dude Canada started building wall. You...might want take Immunology course Coursera something that's take Meanwhile Trump give 2 shits holds massive rallies arizona without masks social Distancing acting pandemic one giant hoax. incompetent buffoon America president leader. That's million people streets desperate, mostly urban areas already prone poverty crime.

During time year getting, gotten super hot out. many going suffer heat stroke? mention increased tension dealing heat general ? continues time winter gets going even worse. least summer find shade day cools night. winter we've homeless people die there's sudden major decreases temperature overnight they're sleeping. they're pulling federal funding covid site testing June 30ty too. stop spike stop testing, right....? ........ RIGHT?!??... 

Fucking Trump. article 2 years old. What’s relevance here?  Show us dolly MSM classic news touched you. Here's updated chart new AZ COVID cases last 3 months (with today's data): 

- **Cases:** cases fell (likely due lowered reported testing, 7-day avg chart plateaued), today highest death toll reported ever (79 deaths). highest point 7-day average deaths chart.
- **Testing:** PCR testing plummeted 7,000 tests since yesterday. (Not Great!) 
- **Spread:** Overall PCR positive test percentage went 10.5% 10.7% (based 448K tests, 6.6% low) average week 21% (based 4K cases, 19% last week).
- **Hospital Utilization:** COVID Hospitalizations shot 6% (all time high). ICU beds COVID patients 5%, (Overall ICU bed use shot 84% 88%). Ventilators use COVID went 5% (all time high). 

*Data Source: bear mind would consider hard shutdown compared going states think situation similar Sweden. Localized outbreaks like one Gällivare, Sweden Gütersloh, Germany keep happening foreseeable future, resulting regions going lockdown temporarily. However life people go back normal coming months. virus going away, massive second wave like predicted. That's significant portion human beings fucking morons. Always been. love magic. like dip ranch. ??

The masks helpful containing germs blocking outside. mask both. probally going see alot cities across south, sometning soon. leadership rally people federal level prevent that, states, sure alot governors task. people would rather believe half assed immunity booster ""Ayurveda"" slapped rather following social distancing wearing masks. Way late stop ICUs run.  Saw scientist type MSNBC.  Said two months ago close hundred different labs/companies trying create vaccine. 

After two months, said looks like three made progress all. also said progress ""guaranteeing total cure early 2021"". Wasn’t 17 year old died Florida week?

I don’t understand people.

The really scary bugaboo possibility infected could “hang around” nervous system ala chicken pox herpes reexpress system weak.

Your quote ""

Educates know jack-all transmission helps prove point. Thanks. Bit importantly, stop passing BS. pandemic, responsible. spreading misinformation part problem  want think moment. did, 1 month pandemic broke onwards, China magically new deaths. Bunch bullshit. Fuck CCP, literally super villains. won’t able hide bodies piling streets waiting weekly garbage trucks reach point Yup. never happen. fucking Stay home couple months

Most people live paycheck paycheck work jobs can't done remotely, literally can't. people can't stay inside forever fam. deserve get infected moron grocery store who's wearing mask mandated. stupid comparation. like, mouse call house zoo. mouse mean zoo, opening borders Gotland like closed borders Norway opening border Sweden. Even more, make norwegians fly land tiny island avoid mainland.
So happy title:""Norway opens borders 0.5% swedes"" You’re born live die. That’s people done thousands years. life expectancy hundreds years ago 30 years less today. you’re 75 you’re living borrowed time is, fact majority deaths coming seniors makes care even less. 

Call cavalier, call selfish, call sociopathic. Thousands covid deaths? That’s unfortunate. someone family got sick died, I’d upset, wouldn’t say “I wish could’ve done more”

The moment step outside door you’re accepting risk anything life hands happen. may rare, could die point I’m willing accept that. That’s realistic, cavalier. truth that, elephant room culture perpetuation values - least wealthy county US offers great opportunities rise middle classes.

The cultural aspect really pronounced proof like present newly immigrated Africans US especially successful demographic offer stark contrast Afro-Americans. Asian immigrants exceptionally well too, valuing education hard work.
I migrated Europe Africa 30 years ago backpack spare change. Took every opportunity offered, financed studies full time work. Never broke law, military service, respect value European culture values aspirational worth protecting. right attitude much easier West achieve success Africa. hood aint tough.

As paying rent, part respecting contractual obligations. Many landlords depend rent survive. possible negotiate solution able expect leniency. I've read uncommon see masks Asian countries. makes sense think it. bad flu going around, feel bit ill. Someone home sick. would common courtesy slap one on. side (tech entrepreneur &amp; executive) maxed donations Yang exactly this.

He one idea next 20 years would bring, going choose Star Trek Blade Runner years. Indeed. TBF Kaiser Family Foundation, best statistics I’ve seen outrageous cost healthcare, insurance know actually offers preventative health care aimed diet lifestyle interventions. Still could much better kaiser go kaiser hospital could 60 miles away you! Considering it’s usually millions, yeah,  follow government's orders NYC... give us late:


1) told us wear masks government could stockpile PPE citizens bought all


2) shut schools major events hospitals already overrun


Seriously, government beyond inept. turned tide Covid NYC, rest states looked went shrugged... president still actively encouraging could true, happens bunch COVID 19 cases suddenly hit NBA once? Oh, people saw NY. cousin TX specifically wrote FB “we’re NY”. Sadly looks like worse. Yes please Lol Even equivalent Trump France (marine Lepen) looks like leftist communist Trump &amp; co. Evolution suppose, I'm expert field. Dude New York overflowing hospitals hospital Galveston bad infection literally send home getting overrun Covid (and stuff) also hospital last peak, even full quarter rooms available Covid.


I thought [live Passed Phoenix/Scottsdale areas last week. another normal day everywhere went. literally one mask there. Restaurants packed, patios packed, people gathered large groups everywhere.  
Not hard believe getting swamped positive cases seeing eyes. Take seriously Except option old white man power. Plastic mailing labels aren't. shouldn’t go ANYWHERE wander around shit two weeks infecting people. 6 cases, including 2 import cases 4 cases residents. president says ""we need postpone election"" gives vague bullshit plan anyone brain tell excuse.... telling think half states would go along principle? New cases probably surge highest level yet end week. We're already approaching 35k new cases according JHU critical trends tracker. They're probably going flying US. citizen wanted go back probably gotten repatriation flight usually allow 2 million people. cancelled 99.95% people. true I'm dismayed come this. However much crap give you, still want US close ally world. administration making exceedingly difficult. true (the hospitals maxing + vents), shutdown efforts. 

Those efforts thoroughly ignored places. studies showing indoor transmission far risk much upset businesses reopening misstating US border closure. closure travel China regardless ethnicity passport. one thing learn US it’s always best, everything always best world something actually happens objectively obviously awful, really nothing ever compares US. even Medicaid youve got make sure end hospital doctor even see Medicaid patients. worked syndrome community many doctors simply wouldn’t take insurance Medicaid reimbursed 1/3 Medicare pays. Amazing people can’t even bothered google simple fact making outrageous statements people like feel smart.

Dumb people stupid realise stupid.

I know personally feel something? Yikes. 

Your point sociopathic, appreciate cavalier it. goon would really hit off. Guess they've chosen live second part motto... leaves bad taste mouth. language dehumanizing sad getting many upvotes it. mom dad, high risk, take coronavirus outbreak seriously fled Florida property California March. quarantined, holed rural county months. according you, anyone lives wrong state allowed try find safer place til outbreak over. Actually less likely die it. fact, hospitalizations people 60. language implies think people poor mostly poor decisions. false. 

People poor economic system choose mandates poor, compelled work cheap. 10% news, 90% teabagging United States. Purposely misleading words like ""indefinitely."" EU thinks bumbled coronavirus response USA sucks, using metrics, fit metrics yet. coronavirus spread Wuhan first, EU, USA. lot places US starting peak now, cities like New York Boston already peaked. nothing fight spread coronavirus, would peaked quickly, would allowed EU sooner. think point trying make. feel like wanted say call males Karens aswell even though Karen womans name. park walking videos YouTube idk cheer make sad - listening Epcot entryway music always cheers Yeah fuck staters! gov really represents us said USA beat China everything, actually mean even rude EU tourists...

If southern states struggling *June* get things control flu season, things could get really, really bad. Flu season alone stresses hospitals (a bit). Add onto serious pandemic *entirely different virus*? Could catastrophic going grad school canada nervous canada make border even strict time goes on. please wear gloves around them! White masks all! seriously ctrl+c, ctrl+v history every ~100 years. 

There initiative Spanish Flu get people wear masks. emphasis focused wearing masks protect troops wear masks framed slackers. Without World War happening, getting someone like Mattis encourage us work together best we've got.

Based history, looking forward watching us relearn (history already taught us this) lessons coming Fall teach us. south, lesser extent desert south west exploding. east coast, midwest seem things control. thought great...

 Full teams planning future park make EU.pay ! 2-week lockdown pharmacies grocery stores open along Statewide mask mandate actually enforced fines/jail.

If done back March like countries, we'd woods now. Instead half-assed ""lockdown"" wrecked economy failed contain virus. people refusing wear masks cutting holes make easier smoke cigs wearing them. God dammit.  Order online, get delivery curbside pickup. Avoid going inside stores can. government UK messed real bad. Compared US though, look like good handle it. Username checks out.

Enjoy corona UK. Trump can't even coordinate cover barr himself. make EU pay ! non-white ones . . . never seen anything like yet pal. peak 2 3 major hospots (NYC, NJ Mass). Today 12+ states trajectory start. anyone confused, indefinitely doesn’t mean permanently. means it’s cancelled happen time it’ll open entirely unsure something wrong right. I'd ban too. OK. Maybe stage Toyota Center Trump rally people there? Yes, countries like China half-wasteland, half-fishing village 60s USA already basically today city Hyderabad join soon. minister decided say fuck opened everything month within state except schools, cinema theaters. like 60 cases every day opening 800 per day last 2-3 days. know sent used hospital ships NYC too, right? Shit bad asthma never thought get one little finger things. Good idea! Anything else makes life easier? toll collector amount people simply safe taking precautions worries much. People pulling money mouth can't understand. Worried life amount traffic like nothing ever happened. I'm wearing gloves mask using antibacterial gloves times hour. safe everyone. they'll end getting both. Great man! people loved ones countries agonizing see again? 

So selfish ignorant. Masks bridge far. think people going download “tRaCkInG mE” app? exactly point adressing - China advantage western countries.

They give fuck citizens. Wuhan shot close. imprison everyone flats everyone violating rules beaten up, get threats send jail.

With measurements fairly easy contain virus, since noone place transmit it. Still highly doubt chinese numbers... guess they'll freedom get infected sick. Hopefully realize death possible part freedom. Lol ""my dad doctor 40s...""

It's politics. People want wear mask means siding bluue team. non-flu ILI Louisiana also peaked Nov. .07, reached .12 March Louisiana New York. Clearly, non-flu causes people present symptoms allergies March. saying know doing, modeling requires make assumptions estimates, way reality. Garbage = Garbage Out. global pandemic, big deal publish this, fact people/politicians going see make public health decisions based something based someone's opinion appropriate estimates are. Dining closed, sure saw that. modified, remember details. Since we’re keeping facts, Yale considered “top” medical faculty. even top 20. Yale doesn’t name medicine like Law Search ""The office intro [Donald Trump Version]"". disappointed Oh, I'm glad Universal stepped mask game. watched opening week videos, saw lots families jerks regard. 

I'm six hours away theme parks, definitely want travel year, miss live vicariously vloggers. 

I glad put getting season passes first time. almost bought December decided wait year. yes can. disney could abandon parks. Yes makes money, intellectual property also brings money. outside perspective getting far. see Trump speak rally night? said live television told staff slow COVID testing ""too many cases"", ""kids sniffles"" incorrectly counted COVID... lie, Anthony Fauci said yesterday never conversation fact working increasing testing. So, Trump lied, discrediting importance testing, simply gain political support - expense public safety. 

That's one small example, guys placing politics human lives entire time. Curbside pickup delivery everything need- groceries, Target, hardware stores. must go store, mask, bring hand sanitizer clorox wipes. touch surface, sanitize hands. Stay 6' apart anyone else, especially indoors. Make trips quick possible enter store. economy first people understand say open means nothing. people feel safe going stimulating economy. seem businesses decide open. India spends huge amount money social programs like building free toilets, free gas cylinders, subsidized grocery etc poor people. Tax source fun programs. Also tax evasion common among individuals small businesses India country. live PA governor took pandemic seriously. People calling impeached thrown jail shutting down. unreal. always work  comment banned mod said “negative Trump.” Anyone thinks successful prosperous country bunch isolationist, self-centered twats, days, delusional. mean article ever frame simple issue pro-American way? Framing sort historical, 'rebellious' perspective infuriating. CNN know many countries based rebellion issue wearing masks?

Tell like - pure idiocy. 9 active cases they're tightening restrictions? Even UK still fly approx. 900-1000 new cases day restrictions getting eased left right centre. like living reality TV show days. Random outrageous absurd things constantly scripted 'we audience' take spit takes seems compensating lack substantive plot. I'm still convinced Texas actually exists. Michigan. Less 200 yesterday. Haven’t 1k+ several weeks now.  SJW here. think stupid. Well European standards inhabitable things like las vegas probably even exist ment. majority area Europe dry suffers extreme weathers. speculation personal recollection good enough make conclusion nationwide statistics. honest, think whole situation speaks people’s selfishness stupidity. Everyone knows virus capable of, believe won’t impact care hurts someone else. individualistic culture, think seeing pitfalls now. It’s probably subconsciously associate certain things “shitshow”. it’s think doesn’t mean it’s really bad. source tyvek suit situ? Yikes, national news more? Honestly crazy thing almost everything see happening today happened 1918 Great Influenza pandemic. Right people kicking back wearing masks (though seems widespread today then). think people learning flu epidemic 1968? Nope. survived almost entirely forgot happened.

This helps believe survive go though nothing happened. hope rather completely forget time, might learn experience next time. Wishing y'all best Houston. neighbors North Hope waits 2024 eventually Merkel may fill seat President Commission.

I love see together. like little boy shy mother around, give fuck. However, still love made smile claimed somewhat german. I'm sorry America I'm sorry governments ran idiots Protesters kneeling brought US knees. Ironic right? Putin (also ruler federation) immediately passed responsibility states' leaders. Trump... cops shoot people complying. America scary right now! least response wasnt open country 1.7 million cases risen drastically since then. Let's act like cross 100k long time ago.  trust numbers FL.  Yes let’s show completely disregard people loved ones abroad! continuing tantrums matters billionaires already idea ago (peasant/pitchfork type situation). property prices started rising much government cracked non resident foreign nationals owning property there. emigrate rent while.

 Assuming anyone lets US citizens country vaccine found. Trump use virus make sure isn't. Depending polls. Either postpone indefinitely make sure virus widespread faithful dare go polls. That's want us vote mail. countries? would wearing mask without virus going around? Genuine question F Fuck yes ban Americans everywhere Texas, Governor Greg Abbott went stage day point high numbers, single thing it. goal? ""To keep businesses going"", ""Wear mask"" SUGGESTION(which followed most), typical wash hands talk. Meanwhile, opens businesses Texas, including non-essential places like bars theme parks, [blames young numbers. top off, Abbott went FOX interview yesterday straight , blaming Dallas County judge. 

Abbott refusing listen [Dallas mayors, urging change mind . Abbott stated many times [enough hospital beds everybody , cruel thing sentence whole state to,[but also . Dallas run available hospital beds July 4 (my guess much sooner). I've shamed friends going even tell us going anymore. Like parties last four weekends row left apartment outside runs groceries since mid march.

Seriously, fully support BLM delusional people saying mass gathering people spread disease labeled political agenda Supplement Vitamin already. There's mounting evidence dramatically reduces risks. generally good idea people anyway. long buddy Petri Dish, Superspreader events call campaign rallies. Yeah, I’m sure stalker’s numbers accurate. recent interview Fauci said meeting trump weeks. Trump well might asked political appoitees knowing he'd get kind results wanted instead someone like Fauci seems try much right within constraints has. wrong. don’t think mutated. reported Europe well. First wave old sick, got little younger. don’t know happened that, suspect didn’t push opening early uncharted water. monsters here. good ol' no-guard buzz ""Delayed spikes"" sounds like tricky trap 2D kids platformer.

Too bad trendy terms even fun use.  Covid-19 single-handedly changing English language. Hell, SD even refer card put phone anymore. ~~critical thinking~~ throwing open borders anyone everyone, virus virus, reckless?  commentary FB made lose much faith humanity.

My aunt lives Tallahassee. heard folks complying not. Even article talk lack antibodies found necessarily mean unprotected since cells still kill virus immediately B cells reproduce antibodies needed fight virus body encounter again. Obviously studies done nearly 30,000 cases reported day matches previous peak, reinfections short term basis likely common, hearing lot repeat cases point. absence reports would tend indicate still newly infected individuals thus whatever immunities previously conferred infected still holding up. 

I imagine fall virus really expected ramp we'll better idea we're still hearing widespread reports people reinefected then, probably safe bet survive, immunity least lasts longer months. businesses dont close. go work home lockdown Somewhere Indian Jail, Dr. Kafeel Khan smiles ironically. countries follow lead.

Guys... Everything fine. need beds.  doesn’t spread outdoors.

This least seems relatively true (not 100%, enough keep r 1) long everyone wears masks. bet people saying wearing doesn’t affect young.

That also seems relatively true (also 100%). young still catch spread it, bet people saying older loved ones could spread to. People wait years opportunity go pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia limits number people go country year, people selected year may another opportunity many years, ever. say that, NJ process opening back can't see ""muh freedumn"" crown cool another lockdown.

When started, honestly worried full collapse society result virus. I, worry happening right eyes, lot slowly see Hollywood movies world collapses inside days weeks. pm reply? AutoMod deleted Fun side note. Texas good reporting cases public past several weeks. Information passed counties, posted daily increases using clear charts. made really easy us taking seriously follow numbers. new increase, Texas announced longer providing information counties. Basically, numbers starting look bad, state decided make harder individuals get information. July going intresting month, sure. IDK, least keep posting meme get cancer lack oxygen ions... wearing mask gives cancer :/ [Can roller lower thought would week.

I realize legit reasons travel business, fly point point B face face meeting conference room/office, could WebEx Zoom, waste resources.  Ok thanks. good guess. hard know anything else causing low number, since midsummer fact numbers doesnt get published weekends anymore. mean, last wednesday 100. president said ""Slow testing get less positives"" 

Seriously....and WH come saying ""he's joking guys.....right?"" Cool give try looked clone recipe back come much. Honestly, think already 'clusterfuck' stage, admitted point, hence people stopped taking seriously, never first place. Every country seems 'figured' out. not. occurring cities throughout U.S. people incurring medical bills take lifetime recover from. price paid wearing masks maintaining safe distance. know people working shell companies lot like contractors hired third party agencies like Cpl  FYI definitely qualify essential work. job easily done remotely.

This conspiracy all, literally facts, mindset needs change regards third world countries plight. 

What bullshit excuse remove post, Reddit dying shitty mods like yourself. want go back minimum wage either. sunshine humidity stop covid19. otherwise brasil fucked talks evil act is, time Trump kneels. Oh thought that. feel like got stabbed sword made irony. much! stop testing? We're giving shot USA let know goes :( know higher trust government institutions

I think trust, think done. 

Media political inclinations Italy showed shocking footage hospitals. journalist downplayed it. population seriously terrified March.

All national regional governments put lot efforts long lockdown. Ooh, I'm happy you! studied Uppsala beautiful city. love there. Go visit greenhouse Swedish autumn/winter brings down. rest world follow EU one while. Magas dumb Migrants issue overhyped. 70-80% cases Mumbai, Delhi Chennai. Cities migrants present anymore. 

If migrants superspreaders, Bihar would collapsed now. Canada want American travelers either seeing chaos disinformation deaths USA. wonder seeing scenes Italy knowing best, 2 weeks behind, focused people's minds here.


I think plays major role. corona warning February, people give shit, happening China. Italian friends got fucked everybody started taking shit seriously. pretty sure, Germany Europe's first hotspot would made well did. faster Bolt. How? need UK citizens. death rate per capita higher US large margin. 

Stones glass houses all. Situation dangerous!! It’s grey cases might increase that’s literally happened nowhere else? You’re idiot. Still waiting actual spike btw increase measure actually matters. Don’t forget used vilify Mexican immigrants. boiling frog scenario. Every day passes isnt much worse day before, never feels like reach threshold say ""Ok shitshow.""

But look 2-3 weeks ago decline, 2-3 weeks way cases peak April, itll obvious slowly progressing shitshow.  Flat Earthers like: “The earth round... oh wait!” US like character Gary Bird Box NYC much infection never found spreading. Teachers could gotten school kids, school teachers, mass transit way work, social gatherings outside school. don’t know.... voted Gillum. maybe better governor De-racist, Gillum would complete embarrassment. governor literally acts like child he's asked questions like reporters. One worst things virus time realize something, change well take 2 weeks impact numbers. title correct, way avoid hitting capacity found ironic Facebook feed, people saying shouldn’t tearing statues it’s history lesson, people say don’t need wear masks. countries world USA done worst job battling pandemic. Worst.

Number 7 deaths per capita. 1-6 European countries.

But yeah ok bud. Yeah know cliche, waiting red light 3 morning empty street. felt like collective measure, Germans pulling one direction. felt way profound, though sure Germans tendency follow rules played it. lol USA shithole country sad. Migrant workers everywhere really suffering. headline alarmist misrepresentation fact. 90% base 90% full. Current use 1207, normal capacity 1330, maximum surge capacity 2207. Dunning-Kruger. they've done past ppl claim fake. can't convince someone close dies. Even then, ""they old"" smh I’ve never played it. I’ve working Spider-Man wife got PS4 play FF7 remake. live another island exactly opposite part globe! Canadian province same. Locked everything within days first discovered case. medical resources great best times, poor province aged population spread huge area. Something like 35% population prediabetic diabetic, one high risk factors, nevermind also really high (maybe highest Canada?) rates heart disease cancer. generally old, fat unhealthy hell. healthcare system would easily overwhelmed number deaths would proportionally huge. Even best case projections released April estimated ICU capacity would overwhelmed November latest. premier completely handed reigns public health experts chief medical officer province. result strict public health measures, right start. 

&amp;nbsp;

But despite bad news projections, people actually listened! result, we've new cases since May 28 active cases since June 19. reopening lagging behind provinces even still active cases... odd person might grumble it, people overall board following recommendations paid far. 3 people died due covid-19 province. might end bankrupt end (we headed way even pandemic), find great comfort living place preserving human lives important tourism revenue commerce. 

&amp;nbsp;

According middle ground projections, running ICU beds next couple weeks (we 98 ICU beds population 520k). Instead, active cases all. geared expect 30-35% population become infected 2 years... certainly likely we'll see cases future - point, we've 261 infections. Newfoundland benefit geographical isolation, all, everyone loves Nans stayed jesus home keep safe. discount also exceptionally fortunate government (both provincial federal) took pandemic seriously start, letting experts run show without ego getting way. tail end... US. KEKW. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* gym reopening next week requiring masks/temperature checks/symptom screening

Haha finally speaking language mouthbreather understand Literally work within tech organization company Dublin 850 people single site alone. large majority tech side workers companies Ireland based.

weird. 40 good countries live in, right... US (about number 10) number 200 (NK), lot wiggle room. 

But number 30, 40, 50 goes downhill fast. top 40, pretty much good wash. Depends live ISP data usage conditions. them. understand. wish knew something head get ramped up, willful ignorance we've seen display year makes pessimistic. Says head organization created event screwed pooch every turn. US fucking massive Every state doesn’t gated/fenced boarder. I’m still curious see initial study done recently showed antibody levels people dropping virtually disappearing weeks so. don’t want get sick either. yeah you’re probably right either case it’s super low chance. put nursing homes. Blasphemy. virus racist. know, realized thinking could go wrong??! Oh please. died rich spoiled brat got high fuck driver. foul play required. Yeah fair, that’s imagine happening. gives misleading statistics many cases actually occurred counties report 5 pm Please sign petition help Georgia make masks mandatory. want end like Texas really need convince bonehead Gov. Kemp ASAP. also seem realize one buying products, ""economy first"" worldview going tank anyway. Thankfully live North Korea, power that. Right one else wearing mask said. doctor seems touch contagious is.

I know lot people saying thing someone knows many immunocompromised persons taking extra care themselves, going sit small building 40-50 people - also increasing exposure risks 11 family members. time numbers going likely already exposed - already indicated others see aren’t distancing aren’t modifying actions church. may interested know survey recently Australians rated Federal government 92% trustworthy Trump regime 10%. hit tourism sector hard. chart *could* still actually true.

We might best prepared, clearly able. It’s possible point needing life-saving care overwhelm available resources (e.g. physically room hospital, enough ventilators, enough doctors/nurses). guess I’m wondering insight think might limiting resource here? would ban Eastern Europe?

Their numbers way better US bro. Actually read stats posting dumb shit (Russia excluded, course).

The UK though... beautiful country. It’s dream visit day. _again_ election year? Yeah seems outdoors proving relatively safe great news head summer! There's chance mask wearing social distancing keep spread level allows business usual even requires unconscionable cost lives lost. we've seen, certain leaders uninhibited unconscionable. Trump tweeted: saved millions U.S. lives. 

From fake virus/flu? Yeah, getting fact they’re tracked already, won’t download something helps virus. Russia gonna better 80% population infrastructure 0.5% territory EU problem it

Well that's lie. fucking talking about?

As today 9,3 million cases WORLDWIDE. need take meds sir. Lol life time Britain went British empire vassal state us. oversaw greatest loss power nation ever endured. Indoor dining gets hardest passes me. hope area doesn’t see spike, mask hard!!
But eating mask that’s I’m near comfortable indoor dining vaccine honestly. outdoor dining need be, husband better cook restaurants thankfully! late, we're going go difficult times matter what. lot hard work (it goes beyond merely voting) make things better. [What mean “you lot great things can't believe poorly US handled this. They're going dealing whole year.  Male Karen really matter either since virus already spread every state. work tech big pool US talent speak Cool, American poor suffer even Maybe ban people uk. White House said meant joke. Apathy? No. understanding deep root anti-intellectualism country grown. There's effective way pulling without destroying country whole. charge cowardice? suppose depends mean that. suggesting I, lot people feel similarly, ""what would take"" accomplish task, yo'd correct; would almost certainly dangerous bloody job forcibly change peoples' minds. People generally idea device carry around does. write information privacy living mostly means write horror stories actually non fiction. would surprised anyone could build app could collect information us companies like Google Facebook already know routinely use advertising purposes. can't true.

The governor said.... won’t, 10 million people thing confirmed. (everyone) slowed down. Brazil show us unchecked spread looks like. Luckily time find drugs make much death sentence elderly.

It’s going around long time. SPOKEN! Wearing mask (at least types masks widely available general public) actually protect wearer much, instead protects around wearer wearer transmitting virus. That's well good get everyone wear mask that's what's happening we're ""free"" want fuck everyone else. really bad attitude.

I also say country especially free, especially stupid, yes, definitely that, number countries free also better services, like healthcare. Many countries actually mounted decent public health response virus.

Everything government done failed response pandemic served increase death toll. instead trying manage better, we're getting worse it. much American exceptionalism right? cares hundreds thousands die? virus I'm free wear mask largely ineffective protecting me. less testing matter all. Sure, less testing part allowed get bad is, let's go backwards we're finally starting test levels along, I'm sure negative impacts. ^plsdoitalready MURICA fyi, live Netherlands bars, barbers, restaurants whole bunch stuff open quite time well. 

What really get ""your"" approach quite states seem think nothing approach reality perfectly possible open country time taking measures prevent spreading virus.

Anyways, hope stay safe manage pull business this. China dumb citizen authoritatian regime, pandemy cazn fought, USA dumber citizen dumb administration, epidemy can't fought like aren’t entitled better life decreases quality life people already there. That’s why, entitled fuck. developed countries reasonable immigration criteria citizens aren’t negatively impacted. US though. what’s best 1%. feel like americans know country working. shit starting rising february/march, already talking colleagues agreed, hits US, biggest loser whole pandemic deaths cause health system bad country enough education ppl would care.

Like, everyone could see US really bad time, US Well that's 5 million people interacting across 508 different locations. 508 locations around 10,000 people interacting 7 days... compared 1 location 10,000 people interacting 3 days.

Seems relevant compare them. really saying, ""don't worry old white voters, mine fault. brown peoples"" DoJ run Wm Barr? Europe (except UK Sweden) death rate fallen dramatically. US ~2 people per one million die daily, Spain Italy used early epicenters number 0.1-0.7. Yup, see below. There's difference individualism (self community) individuality (uniqueness). mask debate, we're talking individualism. personal comfort important good society? examples gave geared towards individuality. It’s baffling Indian government decided hike taxes, Indians pay taxes fuel country world PANDEMIC. 

It’s insanity add fuel fire poor India still flat earthers, fake moon landing, etc. Difference die kill someone else believe them. Fortunately, know delivered. wow, that's going lot testing clear! talking about? U.S., federal government authority order lockdowns short declaring martial law. authority rests states. Alberta Canada's Florida, need bar set lower pleasethanksbye. Sorry, typo. edit. outbreak German meat processing plant wurst. That's genetic immunity, adaptive immune system-mediated immunity people referring to. gained vaccine, whenever one finally ready disease. finally end pandemic I’ve become fully convinced world passed portal Dec 31st living mind someone acid. “lockdown-lite”? American here. Trust me, want us dummies country. Oh thats easy. Airbnb illegal here. illegal business plus mandatory quarantine law enforcement checking means easy way get caught owners. 

We planning reopening August travellers provide negative result within 72 hours boarding excluded quarantine. basically businesses reopened already, including bars. age range? Y’all welcome come south Florida. Apparently everyone partying me. :(

Thanks lot orange cunt. importantly, shows they’ve passed point contact tracing effective mitigation strategy. already become widespread, necessary social distancing restrictions aren’t place. Testing effective case numbers low, becomes widespread , it’s like old saying , point closing barn door horses already pasture. Well succeeded making look Amsterdam Paris arent easy reach though. I'd say maybe Rotterdam, Maastricht (due easy access Germany Belgium), Köln maybe. not... EU closed, even get visa would let foreigner enter?

that's best thing covid19, wish never find cure.

All filthy immigrants dumb tourist gone...it's dream came true. Believe I'm happy see Saharan dust. long Saharan dust, get hit Hurricane here. frustrating part is, maybe next year year finally subsided, many tens thousands deaths, trumpets say, ""see? told would eventually go away"" Delhi even touched 35% back testing numbers stagnated. Finally testing Delhi gone little bit, might hard catch now. Americans deserve better. There's incredible arrogance sense entitlement, virus going impressed stood leave alone respect. Yeah, showed virus who's boss, Hank. 

We literally destroyed economy suppress virus buy time implement protections. NOTHING time. Every ""first world"" country Earth back running still dying thousands. happening, world going figure maybe need us all. Total fucking disaster. Virus flexing muscles. maybe fight harder beat it. Virus control us control it. Que que? Nooooo señor! disrespectful ignorant individual!  Except 2 cases BLM demonstrations... people don’t hug sit couch next protest.

"" ......... ***scientists*** dismiss Harvard study suggesting COVID-19 spreading Wuhan August 


....""and ***scientists*** said offered convincing evidence outbreak began. 


*........Paul Digard, expert virology University Edinburgh, said using search engine data satellite imagery hospital traffic detect disease outbreaks “is interesting idea validity.”* 


*But said data correlative - Harvard scientists noted - cannot identify cause.* 


*“It’s interesting piece work, I’m sure takes us much forward,” said Keith Neal, professor epidemiology infectious diseases Britain’s Nottingham University.* 


*......Neal said study included traffic around least one children’s hospital children get ill flu, tend get sick COVID-19.* 


*....Digard cautioned focusing hospitals Wuhan, already known epicenter outbreak, “the study forces correlation.""* 


*“It would interesting - possibly much convincing - seen control analyses Chinese cities outside Hubei region,""* 


\------------------------ Paul Digard right part. 


if paper declare multiple 'outbreaks' within Wuhan early August,and one deny Fauci said covid-19 spreads like wildfire. ‘’ ...........control analyses Chinese cities outside Hubei region ‘’ ?? (from Sep- Dec) 

so they? 


and 5 people(produced piece) better tell world mighty force US regime ,they able present satellite images 5 hospitals one city ( months period)---- particular virus highly contagious 5 people want tell world hospitals Chinese cities spike traffic volume (from Sep- Dec)?? 


not single piece satellite image prove ?? nothing?? 


***another two experts(these two US based) cast dismission / doubts toward 'paper' .*** 


*"" Dr. Eric Topol, director Scripps Research Translational Institute, said research method validated “very indirect imprecise.”* 


*Topol, involved research, said doubts outbreak began August, based evidence seen far. others pointed genetic evidence suggesting virus made leap animal host humans time fall.* 


*“I don’t know August start,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, infectious disease expert Johns Hopkins Center Health Security involved study..........* EU powers combined protests really cluster fuck. EU considering banning US citizens visiting EU. considering banning travel US destinations. Who's our? summer though, visit every winter hardly person left. yes, need keep people away summer season. Re-openings consequences dumbass. NY, states semi-lockdown would seen surges protests. Think perspective virus going *outwards*. virus (or anything else, no-one wants cold either) course mask.

Also, could pick virus doorknobs, etc, contaminate mask way. everywhere done tested least two times days between. thank god didnt end tULaRe closed 100 schools Israel Reopening think either April May. 

Covid. economist. US bans travel China due haphazard COVID response
Redditors: NOoooOooOoo can’t that’s RACIST IGNORANT

EU bans travel US due haphazard Covid response
Redditors: YASSSSSSSS :(  full testing available, it'd probably least 20% higher. Well things Machiavelli forgot. Rome beginnings small basically families governed beginning still governed time Cesar. families around time Carthage conquered made huge landgrab Italian peninsula causing huge social crisis forming popularii party conjunction lots people lost land settling Rome. Also citizens army full paid army pension 20 years piece land handed army leader resulted legions following leaders government. popularii wanted revert landgrab optimates teh party insanely rich landgrabbers end parts army control either party. result history. downward spiral started murdering Gracchus popularii wanted land reform killed people thought wanted become king (bad hand gesture funnily already heated situation) even first wave? Yes even got act together right increase test &amp; trace social distancing restrictions, would month least would start plateau. yet real possibility neither things happen. OK, downvote away, (and am) one people knows need think economy comes pandemic.

But, wear mask sanitize hands stay fucking dots grocery store know way fix everything. Europe good connection US implying ''economic giant'' US. know scale lot European countries wealthier US. Europe seperate countries . completely obliterated argument. They'd use prison slave labor. Let's forget slavery still legal U.S. prisoners. think right decisions make. world needs put issue control.

We'll meet near future we'll embrace like we've done pandemics. mean “normal” opening table, really. Might right place ask, anyone knew effectively clean car exposed risky risk patient? drive weekly want clean properly parent ride , cockroach inside vacuum failed eradicate know kids can’t go back school parents can’t go back work. keep trying deny reality there’s still many unknown variables virus they’ve brainwashed thinking economy important way risking lives instead saying “hey, maybe old system doesn’t work come WHOLE NEW SYSTEM!!!” :/ Lots people wearing chin-straps Bay Area. two choices.

Not modern Educate stop spreading bullshit 3rd party may actually chance.

Unless genuinely think anyone else 'educate' least 40% US population next 4-5 months absolutely zero chance 3rd party win much single state - let alone entire election I'm voting either old, white, pedophile cronies.

By means vote either one. Vote whoever would like. naive enough believe vote 3rd party anything outside help Trump get re-elected. wish 30% seem huge new vector.

Yet. MBA finance wouldn’t get much far anywhere expat. masters/doctors STEM majors would though. Yeah, testing keeping virus spread. likelihood, LOT untested community transmission, despite official statement contrary (India claims community transmission). Sick word practice? Wheee (Montgomery county) everyone still wears masks. It’s nowhere near “opened completely” here. got yellow 5th. Moving green Friday except Philly think Lebanon county. Green opened completely either though. hospitals filling up, means people getting sick Covid 19. WH want, beds lined parking lots Texas hospitals? Masks work enough avoid lockdowns, especially numbers. Well certainly known shit thus far. put interns relay ""we also know anything either"" twenty different ways. Propoganda, shopping centres day protest show people cramming buy shit zero protections.

Wasn't protestors already knew that. Ah yes, quarantine according various health organizations lead 200m+ deaths starvation developing countries due supply shortages caused first ever world wide lockdown including major logistical sectors. God fucking hate authoritarians. responses different areas country great idea theory, one happen agree with. think New York Kansas pandemic response. However, ""state-by-state free all"" agreeing led spikes we're seeing today. 

The second waves represented graphs (read: spike, decline, spike) 75% Republican-led (I identified 12 9 governors Republican). states would benefitted varied response, generally less less dense people (outside Texas course), however response botched second waves now. 

Another thing free brought problems implementing mask policies. states New York New Jersey, mask mandates prevented tens thousands cases allowing states start open up. largely conservative states, seen issue trodding upon personal freedoms. think would still mask mandate issues federal policy, think nation whole would fared better. that's one policy number federally led order prevent scale pandemic happened. Ironically, Trump kept promise closing borders. family member probably one safest people visit. HILARIOUS current party? nothing current party. Heck, PAN
 charge worse off, since didn’t even want shut economy all. 

But hey, let’s put partisan glasses point fingers other, ignoring corruption every party, drug war started 13 years ago wrecked havoc, pretending selling nations assets make Mexico land milk honey. No. Southeast PA made first moves open June 5. SE PA moving “green” phase Friday Philadelphia still “yellow” first step towards reopening. yep, common sense Aussie's. Americans believe everything see fake news. U.S. citizen, thank god. keep getting worse. sure could... that's terrifying thought can't lawyer way

out pandemic Waiting galaxy brains right wing usual ""but white people suffer too!"" Correct effectively theu dont thay power. kinda like us congress make someone privateer (legal pirate) thry cant. 10 million Sweden. No, also means know died it. correlate protests couple weeks ago? Build wall!!! Lol love it. Austria virus basicall over. 800 deaths pretty nice. Jesus fuck. 20000 test 38 million people 1-3% positives country complained need testing..Shit. Ironic. refusal follow rules makes freedom wretched virus difficult obtain. wonder much Trump's base going get Coronavirus learn guy idolize right time. Oh wait I'm optimistic. learn. hospital supply can't gaslight.

YESSS! I'm gonna get paid nothing rest year!!! deep learning algorithms + social media + propaganda paid 41 rupee/ liter US equivalent today. breaking grand slam record.. fails goal he's gonna feel really stupid. Yeah agree that’d great thing India Lombardy style lockdown

We used call Wuhan style lockdown, fits. Sadly America type society willing get strict like this. We'll oppress lower class occasion, middle class like rights selfish.  Biden can't win Trump shit show pandemic, never deserved even win primary. 

Third parties spoilers. 15-20% Greens 2016 would gone Hillary otherwise, come close winning election (plus, comparable amount would gone Trump). Even got every single Green vote, beat Trump. going start blaming shitty candidates shitty system instead voters? That's study. said studies lied masks. Yes, UTSW Dallas COVID-19 patients they’ve ever announced yesterday run beds.

This great news us doomers! worried lockdown skeptics going right going go back work. Since mentioned homeschooling - 

Ohio Virtual Academy. online public charter school, provide curriculum, everything conforms state standards. (soon be) 3rd grader student since kindergarten. source that? Graphs I've seen say opposite. Fuck, really wanted go Russia sometime future. ICU physician tier 1 hospital SoCal. noticable spikes last 2 weeks. Capacity fine. city 20 million people. That's population many countries Freedom free problem? blaming people working. Every state workers state told workers stay home/work home. look New York, already 12,305 confirmed cases NYC 8,570 cases elsewhere throughout state time Cuomo issued stay home orders March 22nd. That's 23 states DC RIGHT almost 3 months later. reckon broadly three categories people knocking around since shops like re-opened couple weeks back: keeping heads going food, going places careful following social distancing simply care running 'round like they've never house lives never company human beings right space anyone everyone. purely observational, unscientific estimate, I'd say: 50% first category 25% latter two categories 'round parts. supermarket last night carnage minority shop assistants worst it, one elderly lady (shop worker) particular treating like gathering women's institute far close comfort far many occasions, including shouting head busy corridors customers knew. tell elderly lady get act together without looking like bully?

Anyway, I'm people lost livelihoods opportunity get back work. people families, mortgages bills. problem people respectful social distancing guidelines people around them, significant minority simply care minority sizeable enough render easing lockdown significant risk.

I listening Chris Witty radio driving back supermarket less saying event continue respect social distancing everywhere go, easing lockdown see problems could really without result virus. basis witnessed last light better hope Chris wide mark virus tails somehow going sizeable minority people may well bath virus oil way going on. people though still wanna call Hitler he's job smh. wish could move sometimes lol daughter RN front line, I'm really getting sick COVID 19 denyers people still insist conspiracy. Well, mom ugh..... wonder sucks Wrong wrong wrong. example, Texas bad right now, one CHILDERN'S hospital turn rooms support adults understaffed. Texas one tiny fucking example, thousands counties US. Sure, them, especially rural areas smaller population density, full hospitals, many places starting fill past week. simple google search would proved wrong. dude, 40 million Americans lost jobs. saying tens millions lost healthcare exaggeration not? Link got numbers... Qld never open border NSW Victorians innit. China got back 90% economy. mish-mosh things open can't see ton smaller mom pop shops well. Nuance. hard people.  don’t need talent India, already born here. talented workers India stay India make country that’s worth staying in. freezer trucks, we’ll okay! /s pretty sure governor thinks ""essential"" means ""expendable"". pilots nowadays high risk getting laid off? I’ve always thought stable professions, wondering profession affected corona. Deletions don’t necessarily mean less lethal. Viruses thrive finding right balance lethal infectious. Id say covid19 right goldilocks zone right now. fact become widespread sars ever means virus many strains, making less likely one strain become predominant. something hope you’re right. like HAZARD *AF* Seriously. Fucking dumb. 

*I'm going give freedumb!*
*They're trying control us!*
*They right make wear mask!* That's presidential democracy is. [Nearly 100 Schools Closed Since Reopening Coronavirus Cases Israel **9:45 A.M. schools kindergartens shuttered coronavirus Six schools three kindergartens Jaffa, Tel Aviv, Givatayim shuttered students diagnosed coronavirus. comes number schools shuttered around country virus cases detected Wait, US home broadband connections data caps? Amazing China still trying claim they’ve 86,000 cases. horseshit. 🥺👉👈 NYC lose like 70 teachers staff really short amount time? pretty sure couple days ago saw news saying gona close reopening necessary bc people cant quarantined forever. now? Park still open. Majority in-park camping options available Seriously. Fucking dumb. 

*I'm going give freedumb!*
*They're trying control us!*
*They right make wear mask* 5% fatality rate 

Lol imagine actually believing this.  Stock market looks fine me. :shrug: 


/s Heck title emperor exist. Octavius basically initiated first citizen among equals, knew Romans hated kings. still, think age Justinian balance emperor parliament time shifted emperor. help fact emperor's really bad unfit office free reign, could vote ended usually killing course kept level fear successors made insane. However thing was, Rome needed entity kept army together emperor. One main jobs emperor keep borders save organize offence defence Congress could take day day affairs. Roman emperor like people see today, far absolute monarch. also political murder really uncommon Christianity took over, became less, also shifted balance emperors became real monarchs classical sense. guys want millions die what? Jeez. responses really demonstrate people know rights.

If something like happens future, accept vouchers. entitled refund EU flights. Airlines want pay cashflow problems they're having, law. accept vouchers, waive right refund. People Economics, sure hurt little much better getting virus American dosent give shit wants haircut infected. Europe borders closed, among one country. small border connections (little roads stuff) got concrete blocks it, meant drive across, possible walk across. friend mine wanted visit family across border, drove border, found passing without police (many crossings 1‐2 police men guarding it) father picked car side.

All major border crossing roads police checkpoint. possible cross transported goods, signed paper government, said reason good enough.

This case start March till mid June, getting relaxed possible cross roads again. Though doubt second spike borders closed Northeast general. live Weehawken, NJ right outside NYC former epicenter. region looking better it. Good luck you! hope study abroad works out. I’m sure let won’t mind quarantining taking test make sure you’re negative locals protected great visualization bad suddenly got. Texan here. agree fuck right off. I'm staying home much possible, much I'd like I'm EMT, therefore forced deal consequences people's shit. 4th July, dig mass graves sad thing let health experts thing would basically Europe's path less hump thing.

He'd much stronger reelection position taken path. Exactly, way will. kids supposed go back fall too, county covid watchlist California. think going home school route. It’s safe them. Schools need money from. International students function hold hope may find way students. jut might mean qurantining something  got sympathy anti-vaxxers. 

\- Daughter vaccinologist dedicated life work helping humankind &amp; leading one COVID-19 vaccines development. Lmao biggest moron yet. Jesus Christ, son. Okay. Well it. think remember PCM wanna say. I'm positive salty shit. Anyway. Take easy, champ. really hurt US much, *will* significant impact EU. going fun watch perspectives. England never listens scientists. blame goes tits up. Thanksgiving, Christmas New year's Eve parties? We'll glad year over. Oh noooooo know hurts Trump bad job, downplaying virus wont solve anything Unless uvc light

Open doors, ventilate, cover surfaces covid approved disinfectant, leave time says. Wipe down. Cover seats removable wipable covers.

Drive wi down, mask on. Repeat wipe every time. can't allow protests America man. Expecially us saw guy get lyched phones.... live GA made laugh. Yes southern state US. famous lol! from? American glad see happen. country hold incompetent leadership accountable, hope countries step able. America needs punch mouth. quote another reddit user say, ""My country evaporating around speak"" It’s hard ban interstate travel. drive even somehow ground non-essential flights it’s impossible block entrances state. there’s much interstate commerce. would better us could, it’s feasible. people would fucking wear masks, wouldn’t bad, cloth much ask guess too. It’s ridiculous individual states can’t lock borders keep non residents out. I'm U.S. citizen would love move overseas. Yeah big difference country country. 

For instance, Sweden pissy moment, since Finland, Norway Denmark opened borders eachother, Sweden. acted like idiots left things like gyms open march april leading thousands deaths compared countries even go hundred. Trump started presidency wanting build wall outsiders. wall built us insiders. Comedy gold. one wants fit, easy staying home putting mask out, make fit.

It literally easy eating less.

I sit ass day. might sedentary person website except walk dog. 

I've lost 90lb last year so. count calories. That's it.

100% people country obese staying way choice. debate whether people consciously arrive obesity much responsibility belongs where, end day, every adult responsible self analysis self betterment, point accept obese entirely within power change it. one's body defeats laws physics.  It’s certainly Apocalypse training run.  mini Apocalypse. America going suffer virus years come man. Even vaccine (who knows many cases america then) it'll take months distribute everybody Haha, bye bye global economy. Like hiding coronavirus got us mess first place? dumb hell dude 2.5 times likely killed police black white Yeah, organize returns ... also send invoice effort (that's least Germany does). almost theater. live Japan, mask loving many years. take it:

If symptoms, cough sneeze, likely 99% Covid19 spread, among people living home. Asymptomatic people cough sneeze (generally speaking, allergies aside), thus concluded children (almost asymptomatic) giving seniors. 

1 person 30 died Japan due Covid19... preexisting heart condition, essentially zero healthy people 30 died. death rate 50 (including preexisting conditions) something like 1/30,000. death rate really increase much get people 70's. Luckily people retired wealthiest members society, best able self-quarantine government assistance.

Quarantining people risk happened. Mask wearing close social situations would slow Covid19, people willing take risk free so. speed limits, motorcycle riding, alcohol, tobacco, air travel, scuba diving, sorts things call life.

Now situation mask wearing became political, long established part culture, conflicting advice came authority sources, government admitted lying masks relevant information. 

So, back concept quarantining risk, money political so. predicted. earliest vaccine come late next year, even successful, getting every human take time. End 2021 best case scenario, realist thinks never vaccine, medicines help increase survival rates... good benefit nearly completely shutting economy, exactly many people enjoy benefit economic cost?

What really happening obese losing weight, everyone focused eating well exercise. Mask wearing place, also major social effects, especially children. Masks worn improperly little use actually increase spread. Taking one's temperature twice daily would also useful. skin temperature checks little use, I've seen staff work using broken ones lying results would cause issues. Human nature needs seriously taken consideration policies even laws proposed/put place. Prohibition alcohol great, except wasn't. wearing masks stop influenza Japan, stopping 40 people day Tokyo getting Covid19 everyday, even though 99.9% people trains wear them.

Worse case scenario: second lockdown, virus mutates worse killer, vaccination, medicines become less effective, end war China economic conditions... yeah, again, economy fucking important. EU spent still spending billions protect citizens contain virus. lockdown months, tremendous cost businesses personal plans.
Letting potential virus carriers never tested would make sacrifice go vain. “10% blame Trump”
... US South Korea first confirmed cases date, CDC actually blocked Seattle area researchers testing community spread, researchers anyway found positive cases could possibly expected. US refused adopt WHO’s testing platform, promising CDC would develop own... eventually.  time first batch 2,500 testing kits shipped Washington State (about half returned defective, anyway), South Korea already tested 140,000 individual patients, traced contacts isolated asymptomatic carriers, keeping “curve” getting ground, reducing mortality rate 0.6%. Trump ample time public testing available promised, could ventilators PPE manufactured distributed, decided downplay situation, ignore multiple daily briefings urging take action, individual states forced bid meaner supplies federal government reluctantly distributed, states also bid FEMA. 
Between Trump son-in-law, approach disrupting federal emergency management policy middle pandemic. distract inaction months leading this? created delays ordering Tyvek protective gear DuPont, instead buying DuPont $4 piece, undisclosed intermediary buy DuPont re-sell federal government undisclosed sum. 
(While privately run ICE detention centres get away packed beyond capacity treating detainees poorly, costing taxpayers $777 per person, per night, private owners obviously making lot dough way, stands reason that, especially Kushner Trump involved, least someone’s running lucrative racket here.) Damn WEAK comeback example! Comparing idea driving spreading COVID....You realize car accidents ACCIDENTS. case know, definition accident something *not* control. Spreading COVID, limiting spread it, definitely something *is* control. people die/hospitalized meaninglessly wearing light piece cloth mouth inconvenience shows selfish person are. parents raised fucking poorly, say least horrible fucking job.

You must new here, cause see getting down-voted everywhere post. guess even need make point. guess I’m rare weirdo read scale decide dessert number went up. Didn’t think 0.01% manages it, say so. attempt carry depends country, brilliant one. Parts Italy probably point enough people gotten Virus affect R0 change transmisable is. Especially since Italy summer virus tends less transmisable anyways. parts Italy (especially south) get hit hard could still see cases rise later summer. red line end july. THANK. YOU. LOL rebellion. America deciding rights: people. refused wear masks like countries citizens also keen wearing different. different America militant attitude rage private places upholding rule people followed rules. countries also people wear masks uncomfortable. start confrontations people wearing masks places enforcing it. Americans thinking rights supersede people's rights. American hypocrisy finally bubbled surface.


Imagine people raging places requiring wear pants coming in. yep, people mask shaming need facts scientific studies, group think. Health Care workers wear proper industrial PPE ensure fit face hands air tight fit correctly. Comparing home made masks, pretty scarfs bandana's PPE silly. Someday, folks may find damaged respiratory systems buy wearing dirty, filthy socks face. would love move U.S. overseas. Kinda feels like opportunity closing I'm locked down.. Thank you! May ask keep date vaccin developments? Currently follow r/coronavirus Dr. John Campbell YouTube. However, sources include lot news like daily updates country state many new infections got, still miss aspects vaccines, like periods immunity. LOL😂😂

Good luck yall! RIP Lol bothers people don’t conform two party system? It’s working great far right? Yes thought paper epidemiologists calling retraction, truly airborne virus.

There really son many question marks virus. do, sure maintain social distancing Actually she’s nice woman mother 5 would never wish upon her, even feel like she’s taking risks. also tried read it, smell burnt toast. is. TV daily, American people trusts him. could made big difference. 

It's like arguing someone taken opportunity shoot hitler 1936 murder illegal. Sorry, still right thing do. nice live place actually, know, gives shit whether citizens die horrible deaths not. I'm afraid kid able go back school year I'm single mom. one willing distance learning I'm work day. special needs child progressing incredibly lock began. point, least NJ either yay nay whether actual second wave hit here. started opening little little places even open either 4th July weekend end July. I'm lucky employment others? feel bad child cooped house I'm glad lock kept us safe end day, matters. I'm hearing horror stories outrageous medical bills catching virus. Nah, terms US whole we’re week uptick. we’re week away beginning uptick deaths. Ya like mass gatherings every Sunday! repeatedly shown around world risk exposure outdoors significantly less inside. 

Carry on. generally really bad collective action understanding things viewpoint. culture individualistic common good pretty hard thing get lot people's skulls. idea community needs protected inconveniencing way really get direct benefit make sense lot people. Nevermind convince everyone, would get direct benefit. aunts unemployment stopped bc shop worked opened owner never called back 65 year olds right thing. Deaths down. Sorry say visiting parents grandparents happening. mom 75 says sucks wasted year life left. gets corona, thats it. sucks real. live Florida 18 year old 11 year old kids. going tested every week visit mom another state? Make wife 18 year old quit thier jobs? Nope. ride out. 65 year olds need stay home. Everyone else wear masks stay home can. Dont stupid party like 1999. feel like people needing hospital treatment comes personal responsibility... most, good percentage. Lifestyle choices preventable accidents come mind. think get treatment either? Would refuse treatment caused injury illness? many questions mind individual lol. claimed that? know true? going part EU much longer

Dec31. That’s people get system accept them. many people still awaiting first payment. bad matter want. government support us w/ decent stimulus, even would national lock down, obviously won't.

It's mostly elderly, poor, people color dying. govt. care many us die, long whoever's left keeps working &amp; Stock Market up. UAE trying vaccine trials people countries keep captive? Economic crashes put quite people early graves... exactly I've said false? hate masks. wear them, I’m informed appears effective option right now. Jesus hate them. get anxiety wearing them, actually think quite comfortable. It’s unnatural state interacting seeing faces freaks out. makes feel like Purge already does.  Took glance, find one. Stinky tofu I’ve taken geology classes extensively covered global warming. views geologists know don’t represent many, fallacy. Ffs look geologic record proof climate change happening otherwise we’d control compare to. 

Someone who’s scientific field likely able know read scientific publications vs average individual. disputing that, it’s based exposure.

Someone knows science also knows hope inspiring, big news. vaccines work- give people less active inactive viruses make antibodies. It’s like general population rediscovering things work. overwhelming evidence works. see data? California interesting case. 

Their surge massive Los Angeles county. make bulk case surges. population 10mil 88k cases. SD, Orange, Riverside next biggest roughly 10mil total well tally closer 40k cases.  Could Trump possibly worse? answer always, unbelievably, yes. important. He's comparing size population vs. lol. possibly looking like might increase again, sadly: break you, forecast line actually shows net decrease deaths time... say anything virus becoming weaker? good news. Knock off. Also, stopped commenting headlines photos source would see Orlando health officials saying this, Desantis. I've said go again, absolutely insane sub treats positive coronavirus news. generalised, Spain part Europe, comment incorrect. could ultimately good thing long run. People facing real shit instead sweeping rug like boomers done long. nice how’d add it? daughter cancer she’s 12 months. MRI canceled March (she’s ventilator 2 hours) didn’t get May. told us probably happen fall. live MI (not Detroit weren’t even hot zone). People don’t realize impacts. doomers warned pandemic everyone said would fine? I'm sure big backlog negative results hand dump testing totals ;)

Right Virginia's playbook. Diddle test data enforcing mask ""mandate."" Sure Miami, Jacksonville, Orlando, etc.. No, I'm saying people claiming things mentioned mild case common outcome true. So, probably bad sign California, Texas Florida going set record highs infection day. second lockdown would end economic system. 

Which leading scientists telling us. lift early shooting foot. weeks end argued position. Nope fuck game lock eradicate virus long stable life come back done

This true all. many people protesting open up? Along president telling people open up. supporters exactly says. economic harm already gonna get worse time goes rather something virus not. LA marathon didn’t get many cases, low number cases population recently I’m sorry man thousands families going thing right now. wife already discussed can’t attend family members funerals, etc. It’s statistically plausible, I’m hoping doesn’t get I’m curious see whether he’ll ever realize presidency crumbling Yes, history never repeats itself. announcing plan week starting school fall... Funny make excuses. much USA sparsely populated compared Europe.

Its big media conspiracy
What little respect vanished. Next saying caused 5g vaccines Well bound happen. First make disease, make cure make lot money. China give free. Winning!  people believe also believe 5g kills, contrails govt control, govt covered ufo landings on. don’t get example
its almost always believe conspiracy none situation? cant like 5G seems fine virus fake.....they always believe one big coverup.... wash hands instantly removing gloves. Hand washing helps. gloves worthless, wear hospitals train lifeguards/first responders/ etc. put treating victims? many places US capacity limits? UK we're usually turned away full pub known violence door staff let in.

Clubs different though, happily keep queueing get in. company never shutdown, essential employee , everybody hours cut due economy. essentials can't even survive, what's going happen next? knew lot disease, specifics. knew highly contagious, minimizing contact obvious first step. countries including China successful taking precautions US dozen cases, 'no one knew anything disease' load manure. Jesus that's 2,420 people. What's error, perform survey? never vaccine MERS SARS, read scientific journal awhile back skeptical we'd one too. think realistic shut entire industries year, many people already losing businesses several months. 

I think enforcing social distancing mandatory covid19 testing borders might best route soon. Solid joke. Never gets old. 

See doctor's recommendations. know, Canadian province BC 2k cases/5M population .

There also Japanese study says transmission 18.7 times less likely outdoors vs. inside.

 work laboratories, gloves purpose. problem beneficial realize contaminated moment start using them. don’t make miraculously impervious disease spread. masks mandatory enforced March 1, lockdowns would required. get season dont worry season. Play ball. (Sarcasm intended) Good, Yeahhhhh bro responding 4 month old comment lol. everyone indeed wear masks short supply, former comment CDC thinking time, obviously shown incorrect. sure responding 4 month old comment expecting date knowledge virus humans months, years undetected cases deliberately hidden cases. otherwise logic, china hiding cases bejing lol Uhh wanna show math? lol

lmao

hahahahaahaha

just stay inside then, little tender soul.

hahahaha Bingo.

For record, knew answer sometimes asking question makes huge difference comprehension fail connect simple dots. would happy citizens Michigan never leave Michigan. Let’s add Florida Arizona safe. feel nurses work round clock, put hold families personal lives cause full selfish idiots like man hospitalized care.

i think problem healthcare free healthcare not, think right solution ""free healthcare responsable pay rest"". hit car? free. hit wall car driving drunk? pay. get flu? free. need new pair lungs cause live polluted city? free. need one smoke? pay. get covid19 cause went drinking pandemic wearing mask? pay. patient last weeks went ‘actually feeling okay’ ‘intubated bedside’ next day placed ECMO. deteriorate quickly. Wow. setting tents parking lot yet? Better get reefer trailers imagine. :( course - political, public health. shocked don’t real criteria people coming US, eventually requesting proof negative test 24 hours flying temperature check check in. would also bans places high rates infections ( although high rates almost doesn’t matter). Snake oil. wish enforced. least makes people wear recommendation. seen people kicked stores allowed though, definitely think good. Fantasy. ""unaffected areas"" back then,

Of course were. Different burrows got hit different times. Or, know, rent-out/buy vacant hotel make recovery hospital there. Like Washington state early made new policy couple weeks later May 

A month late. Case growth slowed 20s *March* stopped altogether early April. Sorry father hear ""oh shite!"" words. listening Texas, AZ, FL, NC, GA Cali? Yeah, main concern, even mention Montana, beacuse lot places big Arenas even professional sports teams.

But still - dudes access money world find place couple basketball courts, stadium two. play 50,000 person stadium daily practice, practice wrestling, surely come something better Florida. Anybody half brain could seen coming.... Shame people put people power/leadership. Friggin holes. Omg,I fucking care. Report Karen. Enlighten us. 2.5k generalized country 330,000,000? Can't speak everyone here, since never got hit hard NY, collectively see bad could get, people taking lackadaisical now. Great, hospitalization death numbers lagging indicator current case numbers nothing stats. going summer?! Oh yeah, stuff already planned, watching baseball. mean conservatives?

Edit: person responded me, arent allowed say ""R-word"" otherwise automod deletes post. arbitrary nonsense rules rules. poor essential workers! would without them? /s Unfortunately seem back fresh batch equally nonsensical talking points, greater numbers. Thanks! Feel free share knowledge feel like it. Would appreciate input. that's totally fine. comfortable doing. Yep, even surrogates staff can’t defend correctly since can’t tell he’s making shit joking like rest us. Remember wall metaphor surrogates said obvious, trump says literal..

Just week Trump makes comments Tulsa rally test folks get cases, wants slow testing.

Day after, there’s cnn interview surrogate confronted this, says clearly tongue cheek cnn doesn’t sense humor.


Later Trump says wasn’t joking. Yeah average time ventilator NYC patients something like 3 weeks. good all. tons people issues state unemployment stuff..

Just send everyone direct deposit check $1000 every month, first, anyone makes 125k/250k(married) year, ask back tax time.

That way, someone ZERO income now, even though making mega-bank, still get help. resume making mega-bank end year, pay back new-found mega-bank making abilities.

On unemployment? get yer normal $$$ plus $1000 month.

Still working ass off? get yer normal $$$ plus $1000 month.

Working part time, less hours, trying best make ends meet gig-economy? get yer normal $$$ plus $1000 month.

Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, DJ Khalid, etc? Get yer normal money, plus $1000 month, pay back extra $1000 yer taxes next year. *gasp* country 330,000,000? Give fucking break. can’t generalize sample size small. worth noting Florida 10x dense Ontario. Definitely 22x infection rate means, something gloss over. Same, without yard, include park ample distance others. Would real nice could take billions military industrial complex give public works benefit directly. Freedom annual fee several hundred billion dollars I'm sure live like Canadians months. eat ham-like ""canadian bacon"" instead real 'merica bacon, we'll exceptionally polite... it! Well, Dane County posted new record [71 new Coronavirus cases Wisconsin unaffected here. We're spiking. Lock down. rule sub edited headlines. Otherwise everyone puts spin news. Maybe read rules getting defensive. always put views comments.

You expect get deleted mods. way sports work maybe sign trade deal china Cities provide sports bubbles massive contact tracing operations Well gracias sir. Every death “cardiovascular nature”, heart stops effectively perfusing tissues die. Non paywall dumb thing say. realize people getting it, even idiots, puts others risk right? “Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.” - George Carlin That's kinda America's economic system based upon. constitution about. hospital bill actually makes sick guess... Yeah, we've sequencing thing start there's real evidence there's functional mutation spread.

If true would obviously explanation good news. WWEs training center Orlando, since can’t use venues, they’ve using own. AEWs owner owns Jacksonville Jaguars they’re using place nearby.

Both move, MLB going address Marlins especially Rays.

The issue places don’t facilities house players play lots games. Gofuckme: I'll donate money hire someone slap him. going magically disappear? pretty obvious lied.

They afraid people buying masks causing shortage. know? admitted hardly conspiracy theory.

However, ""reason"" lie, make good long term strategy.  


Like said: cannot lie people (not even got greater good), stop listening you. tfw soviet union anymore

Such good aesthetics dry stupidity? AIDS worse *as disease*. COVID worse *health crisis*, much easier spread confirmed treatments available moment.

Sorry, clarified. I'm minimizing COVID way. gonna get worse way gets better. Hell knows what’s gonna happen USA something got give. If? Arent now? Oh shit correct replied 1 sentence reply, way around. post include anything all, nothing breakdown. said didnt understand something, job defend position.  cant fix something refuses let fixed Yea sure doxxing lol nl west gets play cali, az, tx, wa. yay! Yep, got good 5-10 easily worse Rubio.  jail guy temporarily? Maybe muzzle would sufficient Yes. NPR article says thousands, would 0.1% range. I've seen numbers claiming anything larger. need data, anecdotes. There’s difference wanting hospitalization death rates go frustrated people denial works. professional sports person Hollywood star, people US give rat's ass. Sorry loss. agree. already screwed. let idiots make worse, please dont think authority anything. really employer. wish way uphold this. half people see Durham wearing masks businesses seem enforcing all. hospital work already suspended elective services. admitted COVID patients people critical needs. patient count pretty low passed months seeing average increase restrictions lifted. imagine become busier dramatic increase COVID cases. Sure, still catch cold virus once. also people saying ""ALLLIVESMATTER""  
Which quite coincidence, dontcha think... I’m Guam already received mine. So, least around here, construction open real estate, albeit virtually.  considered construction essential buainess anything rebuilding many fires we've here. problem though Hispanic families taking vast majority cases they're partially coming construction. see testing stations checkpoints front worksites. Real estate great everyone realizes like live want move. hampered banks mortgage markers mess.

Hair salons open taking incredible precautions.  

I think issue places lots people congregate.  Construction sites might one those.  Meat packing plants, restaurants, events, on.

Car dealerships probably one interesting ones since get 3 weeks gallon.  wonder sell enough cars profitable. many actually ordered Corona bar spring break? virus currently hitting younger population, get anywhere near sick. first wave hit congregate settings: nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, etc. people isolated. turns settings also happen disproportionately elderly infirm. lockdowns ending, previously isolated younger population finally exposed. Yes. new coronavirus vaccines expected cause autism. Chlorine issue way though. allowed use would healthier livestock case Europe.

Chlorine means basically expected dirty like swimming pool little Timmy gone pissed in.

Even chlorinated chicken perfectly safe still good shitty chicken doesnt taste like actual chicken, humane, undercuts farmers selling better quality chicken. prevents people can't write proper english making nonsensical titles, done here. early tell, probably bit lower yesterday, whether lower last wed hard say decide take break late Republic Rome ancient Greek reading want Taoist Military philosophy, would definitely hit spot. I'm passenger desperately pleading driver please hit brakes. Unfortunately, foot slammed gas. pro-reopening voices cried mantra, suddenly silenced. people would go get test symptoms, people noticing symptoms = tests cases Omg, right!? funny orginal headline article doomsday thing it? Figured would make positive y'all love bad news via comments lol. Miserable. Perhaps tried fit headline too

The state tested least offered test residents employees 4,000 long-term care facilities state. said 80% facilities zero positive tests. defriended everyone social circle supports trump  openly ignoring studies done posted fit narrative shifting blame Covid nightmare onto people power stop Canadian yes. ends supposedly end August pay taxes end year Ok crowd heard him. governor longer wishes live. sorry .. want cookie? Americans value lives. Direct Message twitter. 10 weeks, DM'd called 2 days got money following week.
Furthermore, spoke guy asked ""what money doesnt come whatever reason, way contact directly?"" . response... ""twitter"" Zero sympathy waste air ""I really care people going take seriously really hurts,"" . Bullshit. cannot give bigger FUCK POS. Go ahead explain said 'based lack science'. try without calling idiot. I'm sure capable actual conversation, since simply engaging ad hominem. Dude, go brothers wedding. Chahmed (supposed sound like posh English person fact looks like Southie Boston person saying 'charmed') clinical observations doctors (I posted similar one Colorado). they're seeing median case hospitals, compared back March/April. nothing case numbers. wondering guys were. 

This country wide states governor R show marked decrease CFR (roughly -2%). Well world mark even lower comparable countries. 

Unlike others, I'm interested political biases. want consistency data lower CFR explained non--pharmaceutical intervention pharmaceutical treatments even testing numbers. 

When oddballs come up, dig deeper. strain virus? Demographics? Lies statistics? Different standards? Thank you, Governor. 

However, choose freedom masks. want go beach, eat restaurants (you nicely opened even us), visit friends family, cookouts family reunions, live life like there’s deadly pandemic raging across state. 

We would rather play dumb, stay blind, ignore science. 

After all, shown rest USA, Texas way. 

This comment sponsored ITAMASD. (Idiot Texans Masks Social Distancing) /s great mentality. everyone thought like Even increased testing, cases probably detected Sweden (or many countries, matter). 

ICU admissions, deaths, excess mortality much better indicators what's actually going since skewed things like insufficient number tests. much winning /s  Translation: 

The epidemic situation Sweden still bad possible Finland ease travel restrictions countries. clear message ministers ahead today's meeting Ständerhuset.

Minister Justice Anna-Maja Henriksson (SFP) first government minister arrive Ständerhuset morning. considered travel restrictions trickiest issue government must address today.

- pressure ease restrictions great, must everything possible avoid second corona wave.


Especially Sweden, situation challenging, Henriksson said.


- lively interaction Sweden, understandable relatives want visit summer. corona situation Sweden still causes concern.

#No relief traveling Sweden

Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) clear Sweden.

- clear everyone wants return normal, epidemic situation still bad Sweden cannot ease border restrictions countries. may revisit matter situation improves, yet done so.


Regarding issue opening travel additional countries besides Norway, Denmark, Iceland Baltic countries, Marin said everything depends corona situation individual countries.


- one look making decisions. still realize infection cures occur anywhere.

#We ready second wave

Sanna Marin also asked Finland's readiness possible second corona wave.

- Right situation good Finland, risk second wave real. good tools now. government's hybrid strategy involves tracking, testing nurturing works supplemented mobile application makes infection tracking easier.


Marin's greeting entire journalist corps decisions forthcoming today regarding travel distance job band also recommendations older people. amount deaths skyrocketed said millions demanded resign. Andrew Cuomo got pissed threatened lawsuits Rhode Island governor Raimondo authorities go cars New York license plates asked quarantine? I'll believe see it.

US government: ""Hey give us thing.""
 
Any type organisation, political otherwise, anywhere planet: ""Ok."" Seriously. country fucked everything badly. we’re basically time. Millions Americans cusp eviction there’s support coming local state governments many areas. Even federal government announced plans eliminate funding statewide testing sites. 

With coordination comprehensive plan they’ve basically abandoned us fend ourselves. contact tracing work US? 

Narrator Voice : doesn't

It really working.  NYC bust. can't trace contacts, get answer phone, etc range estimates put fatality rate showing symptoms 0.2%-1%, ""best estimate"" 0.4%.

It also places number asymptomatic cases 20%-50%, ""best estimate"" 35%. 

By combining two estimates, estimated overall fatality rate infected virus – without symptoms – would 0.26%.

According NPR, CDC revised estimate downward estimate mid-April. Internal versions CDC scenario documents acquired Center Public Integrity show April 14, CDC estimated 0.33% fatality rate. March 31 estimate 0.16%. fucking hate ignorant people living country. i’m ashamed &amp; embarrassed. looking forward going Moscow summer Rio fall (both first time) - neither happening :( feel inevitable since live America. course people would go lives soon lockdowns restrictions somewhat lifted. feel we’ll partake game closing opening country vaccine treatment distributed widely. still got 4th July coming undoubtedly lead cases/possible deaths, whole school situation possibly starting late August throughout fall, fall itself, flu coming winter begins, etc.

These next 6 months interesting. However, privately he's like boy plastic bubble. Hypocrisy. also income gap puts makes america look fair. americas deaths poorer people lack healthcare access. india anywhere near obesity problem huge chunk ""pre existing conditions"" still untreated issues. Socially distance wherever possible vote mail fall.  That's awesome! thank providing it. Sure, deaths, he's making point matter, comparatively lower countries. Gloves pointless. virus enter body skin. good overview article. 100% agree conclusions / claims nevertheless decent overview situation. vast majority US par world. sign says need mask enter, enter without one, assume medical condition. really sad see 85% customers medical condition, yaknow nice new 1200 dollar fines, must paid ever desire enter country again.

&amp;#x200B;

Unpaid fines result warrant arrest, learned years ago. Means family 5 pulling border could unexpected delay...of month jail roughly 1200 bucks. heheh!!! Crown law... Keep eye travel restrictions states plan travel to, through. states requiring travelers certain states quarantine 14 days. restrictions continue change pandemic unfolds could completely different two months today. Lol I'm sure still line take American money handouts every year keep economy afloat. site says 31% full great. unambiguously work well. politicization data truth is, reckoning, latest symptom dying society. something like UBI people might able act rational self-interest, take shit jobs shit pay.

Oh Cool. Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool. hospital supply can't gaslight. Fudge positive cases like can't hide overflowing hospitals.

To fair, I've worked ICU big medical trauma centers. 90% ICU beds occupied unusual thing. trump kidding reducing testing, right? reasons own. simply want to. Things ok USA mid-March, places locked down. May 1st, lot places reopened people came outside. biggest factor wearing mask. lot Americans believe virus hoax, masks sign personal weakness.  

Our Memorial Day holiday end May LOTS people out, vacations, beach, concerts, festivals, shopping, etc. close 80% masks on. seeing result that. protests followed Memorial Day, increasing.

Sad part is, even going Southern USA, people still wear mask.  office 80 employees, I'm one wearing mask all. Hope things well Montreal hope visit someday move Maine. I'm NM lower hospital capacity TX AZ, knew took seriously start-but may even matter folks keep showing state anyway vacations.... "" Rivkees advised continue reinforce message “personal responsibility” health officials report spike cases Florida reaching 103,000 "" 


So lynch pin plans count tens thousands college students hand groups, masks socially distance? Good luck that. everyone going private dorm room roommates going treated single unit? going mess. percent U.S. adults said they're ""very"" confident, increase 14 percent since early April, 55 percent said they're ""somewhat"" confident.

Even less people claim 'dont believe science' 'very confident' protect themselves.

The 80% number includes 55% people think 'somewhat protect themselves' sounds pretty reasonable.

They wanted clickbait title. I've heard male karens referred Keiths Yikes. realise dumb, sadly. Rest assured coworker would see manly “tough” R beside name. Don’t worry, stonks go up. upside, libs got owned. So, there’s that. I'd say depended state.

Military bases required seatbelt usage late 70s early 80s.

However, state Mississippi not. I'd guess late 80s became law. Alternate link:  would almost certainly dangerous bloody job forcibly change peoples' minds.

Force great changing minds. yeah, saving country almost certainly dangerous bloody. cowards would choose slow slide abject poverty virtual There's effective way pulling without destroying country whole.

The USA survived civil war more. taking action sure way see destroyed. MD Anderson too. means nation’s top cancer center can’t treat thousands patients fly town month treatment. thank goodness could get haircuts go whataburger. We're truly spoiled people. We've spent long country pretending like we're untouchable moment large portion country simply believe we're deep shit. programmed think ""'MURICA!"" time can't even fathom what's going on. see methodology one links article, phone calls randomly selected registered voters. calls states voters Link article regulations work. Try pages document there. I'll honest - read it. Lots comments proposed changes - see. proposed rules, see actually gets passed practice. anyone 65 semblance competence noped fuck civil service jobs whole thing broken fix. state work in? NY I’ve feeling lately like everyone letting guard this. Still seeing people stores mostly wearing masks, mask wearers don’t nose covered. I’ve seen several incidents someone wears mask going store takes immediately after. 

I think hasty reopening gave everyone false sense security virus gone, reality reopened almighty economy. even goddamn common courtesy bomb us freedom went pick pizza Friday entire restaurant inside full one person employee customer wearing mask. Two blocks behind restaurant within walking distance massive old folks home coronavirus cluster last month.

Luckily county declared wearing masks businesses crowded outdoor public places customers employees mandatory goes effect 5 p.m. today. done two months ago? true. Looking numbers, however, looks like EU past peak member nations decreasing flat numbers active cases. US, hand, seems active hot spot number active cases continuing grow (the current highest peak active cases US 1.28 million number recorded yesterday. Previously 1.262 million, recorded Monday). hard fault EU wanting avoid travel US. Okay, someone tell good news. maybe 80% distorted figure size/pool questioned. 

I would say I’m pretty confident won’t get this. I’m taking extreme measures never ended quarantine. quarantine never really happened live. decision isolate grow food much possible. blessing/option don’t see 80% population having. long keep damn border closed...and deport ones sneaking false pretenses...with hefty fines btw. :) thank lucky stars every day Wolf office. figure damned he, damned didn’t. took decisive unpopular action we’re model state controlling outbreak. think people recognize that, ones don’t lost fucking causes anyway. don’t know unpopular opinion here. Unless guarantee going eradicate virus prevent imported again, locking early catastrophic decision ruins livelihoods hundreds millions doesn’t save lives. fact, severely weakened India’s pandemic response weapons fight real peak, country literally afford real social distancing measures. 

Some people sub ashamed. fill substitutes every time teacher wakes scratchy throat, heaven forbid Covid, school couple weeks month? residents NH VT negative Covid test maximum 3 days prior. also still requiring masks public locations. beautifully edited sure. read Times article linked also? Like said, watch alll it, regardless China doing, little bit saw reinforced (for me) taking virus seriously. Linked response someone said showing ICU videos Twitter, YouTube, etc get people take seriously. US least, also looking likely accelerate demise family farm.  question they’re saying antibodies don’t last long getting it, length antibodies stay around lengthened severe encounter, vaccine would be. someone gets vaccinated, who’s say people’s immunity won’t gone couple weeks? Masks don’t protect yourself. protect people. person protecting pos coworkers putting risk. You’re right, probably generous estimation. point lockdown buy time hire train armies contact tracers, ramp testing, train medical staff, stock equipment. means lockdowns lifted find sick people early, track isolate everyone contact let healthy people go lives rather freely. didn’t shit. That’s continued spread inevitable here, lockdowns don’t work. Work one thing.

Having parties, protests, acting like aren’t pandemic limited resources another. Japanese govt lackluster job. Japanese ppl excellent job. Assume everyone it, behave accordingly. Keep distance, grab N95 mask, wash hands frequently stay home much can. Yeah certainly great still interesting we've managed way better places stricter lockdowns etc. feels like certain hidden factors one taking account safety important dumbassery hope gain ability read future. Best luck. difference resilience living thriving. Anyone live minimal amounts sustain life. But, worth that? kids resilient well I've seen mental health suffer last 3 months would suggest children's same. 

As grandparents...a majority (95%?) grandchildren going see grandparents die. children lucky far, time time youngest's age - 5, 2 4 grandparents passed away. remember one grandmother faint memories grandfather. But, grandparents passing away process life. provides context children. 

But, COVID impacting many people, kills mostly older people. median age deaths state 81. 75% deaths occurred nursing homes. Nursing home residents health begin with. tragic. I'm arguing isn't. also know also mechanism protect populations - quarantine v. quarantining entire population (thinking mostly distance learning schools)

There surely continue sad stories appear newspapers media gets attention/clicks media needs survive. But, society need recognize life needs move on. return 12/31/19 footing, sure need get past currently are. Yes 😂😂 Many states decent contact tracing programs. NM example, stamp trace clusters small half dozen people. 

It's getting harder cases leak borders AZ NM, impossible. people: Let’s government use money collect citizens subsidize rent citizens. That’d pay mortgages keep landlords defaulting. pay banks keep afloat.

Politicians: complicated. Let’s bail banks. wise man said... Number cases go stop testing. Media headlines feature. good boy. Followed Abbott forcing us phase 36 re-opening, Matrix 2 style rave party human race Texas State Fair fall And? People die. gonna die. masks somehow cure death 103? fucking unacceptable high. nation devastated this. missile strike. major economies report reliable date ? thought bigger economy want hide badly messing up. willing risk safety others subjective personal reasons wont even list. cowardly stance.

Choosing wear mask akin smoking eating bacon. negative effects affect you. fail wear mask similar speeding running red light. society decided accept enforcement speed limits traffic lights keep others safe. Literally nobody could predicted something like this. Amirite guys? model White House using first couple months likely never mention again: Time get borders shut. first made Olson masks, summer hit, find hot cloth nostrils mouth breath.

Fortunately, found mask design medical school passed respirator fit test (which Olson masks not) comfortable. They're cup style, cloth stays face I'm breathing air, cloth makes easier breathe. cooler, easier breath, comfortable, pass respirator fit test --- they're win way around.

Plus make fabric lab tested almost N95 filtration. sympathies America.

Here take direction 'from' medical professionals.

Im sure Fauci could come political refugee status admitted.

I dont understand 125 vaccines pre-clinical (animal) trials right around world. Nine currently tested humans. Several vaccines leading pack terms speed designed using strategies learned, even building vaccines created outbreaks like Ebola SARS. Ultimately, every vaccine prove effective, safe use humans. Many make past pre-clinical trials. need billions doses. still many pharmaceutical companies around globe working produce vaccines, need number successful vaccines mass produced hope beat back virus. take time. even better, could replace working tests tests always return negative. egotistical need deflect blame abject failure US leadership. live country currently experiencing 38.4C highs (101F) 100% humidity. wear full two hours outdoors today, colleagues around me.

It's sacrifices must make -- even one safest countries world -- keep so. much effort really excuse, though I'll admit luxury wearing new one every day. Yeah fell chair laughing I'm way hospital see bad I've broken back. Great comment, 10/10 Well least hospital great financially ""customers"" right? economy important human lives. dont mind 121k+ deaths long economy back open. dont think masks important, stop testing much ignore problem.

""FUCKING CHILD!!"" SlOoW testing DoOwwWwwwwwWwNn annoying possible, try delay payment forever. reschedule flight overbooking even covid took KLM like 90 days pay me.

The annoy cost point give in. think single person thread actually read article. explicitly states virus spread protests, rather spike caused loosening standards protests. coronavirus spread rallies, Mr Hunt said undermined government's messages limit gatherings.  Cognitive dissonance Well, lot American bases EU. lot soldiers. Guess move GB 'enjoy' British food. Nope sure? Facebook feed full people saying COVID-19 numbers hoax. It’s 2020 - I’m sure aliens volcanos bigger issue then. Actually much 80-90% clear 3 days. actually empty surgical ICUs pretty fast. I'm sure Houston already done - Dallas definitely hasn't. quick google search says fact lock eased late April/early May. see never imposed lockdown? states way lenient UI COVID-19 safety concerns. I’m sure VA sake 100% hope so, it’s absolute disgrace people forced back work near 0 safety precautions place pretending there’s global pandemic hand. Money lives truly American way follow western hivemind country govern they're vicious dictatorship STFU think otherwise CCP troll.

/s Destroyed economy? Economy fine. trimmed parasitic small businesses, got rid lot labor bloat, profits higher ever many. Stock market way highest levels ever! 

Yeah, panic, dip. honestly POTUS fixed simply declaring human lives inconsequential. Fucking brilliant, honestly. Stocks tanking fixed saying ""don't worry, we'll let people die"" right away, gains!!

The way economy works, fucking _wish_ destroyed. MIC care 1-10% population dying, makes life easier. even considered voting  covid19 2020. gaslighting real Wolf literally recognized CDC handling thing properly. people want Impeached!

Wow seems rather dumb...In germany city health department hired additional staff find potential contacts. perfect yet, lot paperwork involved Germany this. Guys also forgot MLS coming too! No, think that's dumb interpretation said. Yep. There’s large segment population never learned emotional skill empathy. someone direct circle impacted unable care. Yeah, COVID supports BLM stays away protests large gatherings sort /s Sure, coupled darkly pathological lack caring consequences comfort seeking somebody else's life. Fuck'em, let'em die mentality insane watch. Unbelievable shit literally unbelievable lmao. 10 hour drive north would elicit opposite reaction, execpt restaurants open lol. I'm really glad live somewhere people shame instantly put place stepped foot inside anywhere without mask like poor education standards, hey...they got largest military bases world. people longer suited service military, per recent US army report.  Lmfao!!! countries would accept US citizen moving country? don’t want live US anymore speak English doubt job skills service writer Harley Davidson would well country. seem much educated. Oh yeah real possibility. whole point quarantine 'flattening curve'.

Limiting resources would basically aspect hospital care. Staffing would get stretched thin. Hospital space/beds. Equipment. Medications ect  Haven’t heard? It’s immigrants prisoners. darn prisoners won’t distance inside cells! objective fact matter United States currently ten times amount cases per day EU does, despite population 100 million fewer people. wife works acupuncture, massage chiropractic clinic. immune system heavily compromised unfortunately America can't make alone paycheck, almost every day talked quitting doctor care cares money. They've already opened back up, hell lot clients angry call tell open. People bitching wear masks, sense self entitlement ignorance shown everyday. Guess state live in? Actually matter, story could one thousands south. OP means small controlled cluster spread outside cluster wave, cluster. good job containing small clusters, wave. went. hair dresser works home policies procedures stringent anywhere else I’ve province. wore masks entire time sanitized several times. following guidelines felt safe. wanted support business knew policies procedures place ahead time. one else us. Covid lots *pneumonia* hospitals..... understanding death trends lag weeks behind case trends we're half year reflects childhood getting bashed brain hammer That’s case though.. Europe 4K daily cases 30, US still floundering around 25k (down 30), uptrending.

The US 1/25th world’s population, 25+% cases (probably less countries aren’t reporting). nose wire burned you? Wow.

Try putting something either it. Depends tight fitting mask is. tight fitting, -- insulate wire sun. tight fitting, keep insulation wire nose. NYT nice tracker vaccines different stages development. I'm sure qualify ""legit progress"" 20 vaccines listed stage clinical trials, phase 1 2 two candidates phase 3.

I know small difference, peoples' *job* working numbers. But, apparently, can't perform simple arithmetic?

They knew damn well words would interpreted. *headline* report ""Mortality Sweden approaching normal levels"", whole gist release things getting back normal.

Sure, careful add qualification claims, know media works, played media like fiddle.

By way... even numbers back ""average"" would still deceptive. Why? COVID-19 started killing people, mortality Sweden year well *below* average.

Until March 11, daily mortality 2020 averaging 6.9% *below* 2015-2019 average. professional statisticians know too. know ""average"" year another 6.9% less ""average"".

(Full disclosure, wear masks Maybe something this? 65% Americans idiots  Try looking cases state metro region. area want look curve. Many many states rising record daily cases. Rural states take longer exponential growth steepen noticeably, happening. Many states spiking COVID cases right start ""just-the-flu"" season. highest ever, hit 39000 back April, yeah, things getting better. important things breathing. really think things looking up. numbers look like April. shit never going end.

She probably thinks sinners get AIDS deserved protestors wearing masks least.

The videos saw protestors wearing masks. posting fake news. I’m saying, opening problem, state’s data shouldn’t sharp peak, almost 3 week decline after. either kept climbing leveled off. would bet weird spike single outbreak incident. Ohio one prison outbreak tested everyone. Numbers spiked way up, immediately went back down.

It seems lot nuanced discussion open=bad, closed=good. Take state like Indiana, started opening May, continued see declining cases. didn’t start see cases decline opening. Yeah. much land 35% cover? America, land means political power. Obviously /s would second lockdown end economic system? mean? Yeah, states likely still less 5-10% exposed. Still long way go... payoff stay home going put fuel fire getting fair wages, something needed long time. NorCal resident here. proud state's early seemingly earnest response flatten curve. 

I'm genuinely disturbed badly seems falling apart SoCal.

Now? even cashiers grocery stores wearing them. i’m younger myself, people give looks literally don’t understand wear mask people, myself. one fully understands spreads, NEED go last thing want risk older persons life Yeah, happens government refuses help citizens. every real first world country instituted something like 80% pay people lockdown. countries also seen much compliance lockdowns, thus, vastly better situation economically.

Why fucking hard people understand? keep hearing nonsense false dilemma notion ""durr lockdown worse virus""?

Even conservative leaders like Scott Morrison Boris Johnson low middling approval, pandemic, seen approval jump middling decent handling this, simply put citizens bailing stock market. dont get comments seriously, like what's wrong pay portion share chores, get see ur parents often? This. People notion numbers trending lockdowns mitigation measures (which OBVIOUSLY would) means virus somehow ""over"" now. actually incredible normalcy bias mental coping go far. stocked VR games case we're shit long time. Far Audica holding interest.  Lazy troll, try harder. Exactly incompetent complacent pandering politicians January didnt want ban travel to/from China made “xenophobia” fears held accountable. Owww, yet can't think counter example. could end coronavirus emergency anyone died? 15 cases, couldda made goto 0...  ok. nations becoming prisons. Part keeping immigrants/refugees keeping nationals in. OK. Borders supposed ebb flow people living them. Static borders abomination. ONE right violate another's human right freedom movement, even government. Eh, rural areas can’t reopen safely doubt urban areas will. northeast started reopening expect cases start rising month so. We’re already seeing urban Louisiana california. favorite show! don’t consider it, it. Yes look stupid hope Canada thing. Biden needs use ammo arrest Trump he's kicked office. Yea need look increase deaths surging states. far Texas shows small bump deaths, Florida Arizona seem flat. California even slightly trending down. think hospitals clogged? Flattening curve goal along despite criticism thrown US’s way, seem achieving goal. Even cases risen last couple weeks, it’s hard find data hospitalizations worse yet deaths increasing. 

From everything I’ve seen US hospitals needed time build excess capacities nowhere near capacity. Anecdotally HCWs social network dealing impending layoffs due capacity. 

I’m arguing get people sick give HCWs jobs, achieving goal afford little freedom. Last nail coffin fuckin assholes campaign. OK rally wake call. Depends mean wall street main street. Wall street maybe. Main street chance, might stop getting worse soon. Definitely not. literally find loophole make masks mandatory businesses. almost like Trump trying kill supporters. Call crazy, that's seems like he's doing. took advice research today. Tampa bay live, biggest hospital said it’s fuller yes, however it’s particularly tied COVID. said due elective procedures happening increase capacity. Tampa Bay Business Journal. said newer cases weren’t requiring severe hospitalizations like NYC. reassuring. I’ll continue monitor hospital updates around here. going survive without US Tourism? Leave virus Mexico first wave never end.  developing nations

The location line correct, direction travel wrong. using one many examples, they've plenty time fix cougar Stadium anywhere... started preparing now, they'll never get done time need AFIK, Congress appropriated lot money Covid-19 Trump administration decided steal it. else want Congress do? guess ""show state"" want shown. Thats goverment talking. Almost countries managed pretty well havent lost cars houses. sounds ""back pedaling"" common days. president USA set better example safety others virus might spreading like wild fire. mandatory though? see signs highways Toronto tell people traveled self-isolate 14 days. sound mandatory (or enforced) all. (Self imposed serious shit.) I'll sure that! agree whole heartedly...in principle. 

   really say fuck strike. work way foreign workers. union. protected anything. come countries make money, lose money. 14 days, month over-exaggeration unless friend broke quarantine. Thank EU recognizing humanitarian crisis going US. Brazil getting worst deaths rising 100K early July continuous cases climb 1.5 million June 30. guidance based information available time.  stop applying know time know call lie.  bullshit got stop. former colleague participate anti lock protest Arizona ""the virus already swept Arizona back December January; cases asymptomatic we're good"". person replied said knew “lots people” affected, assumedly meaning sick. Either masks end all, evidence low, you’ve already it, evidence (for herd immunity) commonly accepted. many factory plants open worldwide(if cant answer dont to)

Ah ok, bit worried one. I'm personally working rest questions now, sir/madam, receive inbox soon. 

Kindly send statistics requests us, gladly research them. people money don’t want customers scared spend money. Yakima county fighting hard. Walked two small businesses past week, barely anyone wearing mask. insisting unnecessary, overblown overstep governor. spread slow, US, work doctors slow. slow furlough give pay cuts 1 5 doctors. weeks ago, state’s hospitals 70 percent free capacity. Haven’t heard update since even better now. never get doctor’s valuable time back. wasted forever. hospitals busy right now.

All terrible things mention health care professional things go different kinds sick dying patients, Covid-19 ones. makes much worse one? easier someone comes self induced gunshot wound? shutdowns causing suicides go up, among things. Tens millions lost access medical care shutdown, yes great doctors won’t bothered much them. NA KEKW almost eradicated polio species superstitious assholes murdered vaccination doctors/volunteers?

Nice. AstraZeneca, manufacturers Oxford vaccine. vaccine like flu vaccine, you’d take every year. Imperial College example using different type technology Self-replicating RNA grant permanent immunity, take longer. Goddamn people fucking disgusting. Trump helm, America world leader again! However need slow testing, we’re going stay ahead Brazil. Perfect, treat us deserve. lol earth think we’d good this? movie script, even SyFy channel would accept it. unbelievable. keep believing rest us watch. not. Third world refers countries unlined either two sides cold war. 

People may say due operating much like developing nations, definitely considered third world anything official capacity. That’s Arlington, several hours Houston. Dang. reach 200% population? Dharavi speak experience (from Ireland), would usually say something like ""I'm postgrad/masters/PhD [University name]"". really hear phrase ""grad school"" here, experience. yes, people would usually say ""university"" even they're working towards masters PhD, although think people would make explicit they're undergraduate (saying something like ""I'm PhD"" rather ""I'm attending grad school"" like mentioned above). 😢 coming funeral? bro sub become cell people pushing Trump propaganda anything else including asinine hostility hatred directed towards Fauci. saw aging Mediterranean societies.

Elderly members taken care family death. extremely difficult family dramatically caring, humane, meaningful. Oh knew, didn’t extend lunar new year lock billion people little flu bug. shows California slightly spread NY/NJ Per capital, they're reporting cases CA already. state way population pop density. 

Abbot ashamed himself.  Trump solve own. Congress responsible well. need congress making budget legislative decisions. they've spent pandemic recess working. 

I'm pissed. understand - didn’t see Delaware numbers. Can't ruddy blame that, you? much bet trump wants go war EU haha This!!

Indoor dining restaurants open right now. madness. focusing French Revolution 1789. One congressmen wasn’t wearing mask 
   
LOL make shit up? People like spreading bullshit ridiculous Abbott allow Houston issue stay-at-home order? People understood risk back then. Note cases Europe happened China and, I'm mistaken, first cases West coast US. Cases vast majority Europe happened Italy. People knew still fucked up.  park capacity reduced, masks mandatory, temperature checks people obvious symptoms admitted, I'd think going Disneyland reopens. indoor shows, walking around outdoors seeing outdoor shows? risk negligible. right. China forced us sit hands, national policy, supplies, uniform guidance, accountability, plan, leadership.

You go tell that, child. Keep telling corpses too. families.

Wretch. like flu shot. You’d take Oxford vaccine every year. AstraZeneca, manufacturers Oxford vaccine true? People drive across border long continuing Alaska? Glad recovered. feeling now? residual effects? I've read lingering problems. Take care. I'll tomorrow see. (wearing PPE course). go floors, next er. go much detail, seems much going on. tell virus ravaging place. Fuck off. done September. US done month Brazil okay April 2021. anti-intellectualism blight humanity many years put Fauci. Big difference. Yeah, obviously every country restrictions. wasn’t saying that. Yes course, NYC huge metropolitan area, nature vulnerable epidemics. However, guy replied basically thing, comparing US whole remote places, soften statistics.

what about:

&amp;#x200B;

**Illinois**

population: 12,671,821

Confirmed Cases: 137.825

Confirmed Deaths: 6.707 Well least protesters outside wearing masks. ever thought smart time protest. WW2 happened today, tons people would decrying fake news “crisis actors” don’t “see enemy firsthand” since fighting Europe. means time stay-at-home order Houston.  LOL economy, life. Aw, thanks! Luna first kitty moved own. 22 got her, see there. 

We watch Parks &amp; Rec every night. It’s funny! sounds like still advocating businesses shut would caused people work.

I think misguided try blame spread virus less 1% population attending protests. seems mostly political. equally misguided blame small businesses murdering grandparents (I actually seen anyone suggest that) spread virus seem heavily connected re-opening strategies states used. Terminator power. Totally agree feeing safe Universal. I’ve avoiding Disney Springs reports I’ve read. Somebody's parents cool this. Idiots. Understandable. wish government took seriously need to. appreciate least one party intent keeping citizens safe. Yeah, spend time road, too. actually Ibiza kinda sorta shut border March. thinking maybe end Q3 could go back, highly doubt make sense fly 2020. Expecting least New Zealand probably Australia something similar. [this fucking does. speaks English, local language fluent Chinese. fact speaks three reason able get job there. local language combined English unsual native population finding someone also speaks Chinese within native population addition English rare. immigration sysmtem US needs start working. allowed move work rare skill going open business much larger mom pop. works investment banking Euopean country goes college Chinese valuable firm works for. 

And complaining kid treated. simply saying right now. appalud Europe doing. US needs learn lesson Europeans comes putting citizens first. obvious that's reason lie now. logically masks help degree. states absolutely ban travel ones treating virus like hoax spreading Okay Canada . one paying attention. completely insignificant. Lol even secure seat UN security council fucks sake. Womp womp.okay I'm done. Leave alone I'll leave lone. could night. far, far virus spread naturally burns conjecture. We're going find empirically thanks number states US. Instead got Robert Picardo. Much better mean, can't blame 4/5 black women obese, one biggest risk factors, yes everything racism. black neighbor stubbed toe racist table today one looks like it’s going work year. vaccines development could come quicker grant permanent immunity. example: Moderna, Sinovac Imperial College Every country problems. Don’t let Reddit fool you. 1 hour delay fetching comments.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide biggest problems seem spring break long term care homes. 75% deaths care homes general outbreak Quebec (more half cases Canada) seemed come home spring breakers, whether returning Florida France. WTF even mean? 

It means anti science brain dead cultist. small price pay go applebee's!!! might missed walked back joking today. joke...he cleared today...so forget interview CNN campaign manager state otherwise.

Next guess figure control message many ERs. Best luck strategy. Wow. Hot Wheels? disgusting. Good news, though. Pretty soon less testing numbers come down....

/s Glad download, please donate tho! ...and some. Haha lied lying guess since doesn’t deny it. would believed Trump’s bungled incompetence would make Americans pariahs world large.  I’d wake New Zealand. come Quebec? eh little boy April 24th posted true. first baby boy interesting say least. started drinking drank even more, cut back lately bought bunch masks. Mostly vanity they'll color coordinate clothes. try remember take extra, still wrapped, mask must go out. see someone without mask I'll comment, oh wearing mask, need one? people take one thank me. know I'm one who's forgotten wear one. people get nasty it. care. I'd rather wear mask, stay home, avoid crowds dead. country needs get damn sense appreciate other. incapable feeling shame groveling spineless?  *for good reason.

If essential worker (proper essential: government, health, military supermarket, maccas, bottleo) resident returning even compassionate grounds apply exemption travel. title isn’t misleading left shithole could.

I'll say this, Canada Mexico. Watch out, close borders completely sake. There's good chance we're going see massive amount COVID refugees coming US. probably refugees come November, Biden utterly incompetent, chances Trump's going win again. part magical overarching trade deal no-one knows ever agreed even though 18 months apparently 95% done clearly bullshit. Separate signed agreements happen walk away deal scenario. Wait. hell national coronavirus emergency authority anyway? room 9 people without money 1 person $1 million dollars, room higher net worth room 10 people $90,000. America. cause nice stuff nicest anywhere mean average person access everything. Yeah, definitely going super enforced honestly officially announced made *huge* difference I've seen. Gotta pump rookie numbers Florida! /s Korea we're worried 50 day days. Exactly. kind coherent federal response covid I’d back 100%. Trump already given US corona response like gave building trump tower Moscow, like gave wall, Mexico funding said wall, holding Saudi Arabia accountable 9/11 rebuilding infrastructure manufacturing. US never weaker. see, that’s called moving goalposts. Going “flatten curve” “cut recreation months you’re subhuman” stupid jump basis science. It’s also kind lickspittle attitude misrepresentation causes people distrust response completely reject idea masks. 

Show sources hospitals can’t handle COVID cases right US. Show sources increasing hospitalizations deaths. deserve it. Honestly, deserve covered Yellowstone's lava ash. Honestly, eu law eu countries country unique laws USA states state unique laws somewhat comparable. remotely thing completely true. Imagine independence day trump president looks like added deaths retroactively. Fucking terrifying sad. :( Horrible. People dying hospital waiting rooms acceptable. Mask people. community hospitals, already face lot challenges... Indeed, people would actually stay home / listen advice (mostly) reopening ""ending coronavirus,""they never going bother obeying restrictions concerns most. difficulty getting cooperation masks great. lockdown fatigue inducing riskier behavior also great. 


But end, what's going kill us astonishingly common people obvious symptoms continue daily lives. Well good government stupid OPRAH: get virus get virus amazing actually assholes dumb enough subreddit would say unironically Michigan here. I'd love Canada come annex us. next agency top CDC. W.H.O pandemic team started Ebola. 

Ok still 2. 

You still didn’t answer covid started. 

Quoting took 3rd agency. what. even issue. NY hot spot. Huge population density 100-120 days later states decline weren’t bad 200-300 cases blowing 3k 

That’s still missing agency fault. Florida lack 3rd pandemic agency? LOL

I know Texas fault it’s mild flu fuck covid don’t exist sat home 2 months made usually money burned holes pockets. 

So Arizona, California states going roof. Yep it’s pesky New Yorkers New Jersey fucking stupid people states are. 

And clear disregard. Shit many states sued face covering 🤣😂🤣😂 

Clearly White House pandemic response unit fault. 

🤣🤣🤣 

Thanks chuckle. “But I’m American. can’t me.” /s would never happen shit continue happen? Fines need start happening. really mindset pretending disappeared even though really hasn't. Nah. thinking typical German hostel room situation like 6 beds.

I agree, 40 bed sleeping hall. surprise considering passes History USA. I'm waiting ban travel EU indefinitely retaliation basis Well, that’s don’t family gatherings pandemic. Yeah whatever happened building temporary hospital NRG? [Called Thanks Trump
Nice job blowing foreign relations

I’m glad got European travel past years still makes sad Give huge fine. things happening. always wondered MAGA referred to.

It's ambiguous dog-whistle, nothing more. want morons feel like patriots, publish kind delusional BS.

I sick walking eggshells fucking morons. Unfortunately, calling strangers bullshit get hurt. claim coronavirus response better EU that

Although could would correct. anyone else noticed much sensationalized news official coronavirus sub reddit spreads? bet every dollar name along limbs hear coronavirus election

When trump gets re-elected it’ll back impeachment whatever Dems find actually worse that, US put developing countries. China travel EU, US cannot.  Lmao gives rage /u/weedbro, “Dope man”, hmmm...... always use inhaler right putting one - whether actually helps not, couldnt say. masks definitely make harder breathe. probably look like fish land gasping air time. grocery shopping multiple people worse health issues, otherwise avoid going much can. go quickly without triggering asthma worse. take mask soon I'm outside away people (safely, ear strap). Headaches pretty common, maybe lightheadedness. gets really bad, like *really* bad, I'll take one side, away people, try catch breath. ideal, obviously, best. world help us Trump point cause checks balances even working. feel like pointless even learn systems school actually use say government corrupt bam there's government knowledge. locked two bedroom apartment like 10 weeks going outside grocery shop. grew balls mask go get bagels favorite spot.

If anyone think want folks state put us right back square one think again. US basically 3rd world country 1st world budget Italy. Also Spain, Belgium, France, UK, Hungary, Sweden, Ireland, Romania, Switzerland, Greece. (and Canada btw, that's besides point)

The US actually falling rankings comes death rates. Everyone knows Sweden got everything wrong COVID-19... do. ones remember Remember said would push back opening things looking bad. What's idea bad?! Resign! racist asshat. can’t blame race human one. love this. want recap:
- cases world test much. Maybe look per capita testing, 26th world. richest, powerful country world isn’t top 10 20 testing

- deaths high why? Oh look per capita deaths. 9th worst world. hey better France Belgium. Since good enough USA?

And point open close, it’s plan. USA plan - Feds messed early testing, never put together plan, spent two trillion dollars, shut gyms barber shops, partied, day traded shot fireworks weeks.

No federal guidance masks, federal criteria open, lots states opening without enough testing contact tracing.

So enter another period rising cases deaths. know stifles - economy. mean company known allowing pay remove bad reviews add good ones? Trump incapable listening reason. Rich people probably still able whatever want. Can't say blame them. horrible job US, many people taking seriously. Umm seen pass rates lately? large family gathering

Found problem Gods yes, feature autoimmune disease. I’m fucked get COVID mean hey thing Feb/March rightfully — Europe epicenter time. 

I think idea USA shithole (in context virus) pretty funny considering case fatality rate. Overrunning ICU capacity already baked matter do. seriously doubt compliance lockdown would effective considering July 4th coming up. lack leadership state government means people care getting triaged hospital parking lot. Hey America First worked. First Corona cases point world gonna build geo-global wall around US. 

See didn’t pay all! 

6D chess folks. Lol delusional dude.seriously. Contact tracing. German app. 

It’s little bit success, cause government followed end design concept largest hacker community - since everyone loves hackers people trust app. I’m surprised. Let break that’s even possible. 1) asked simple question. 2a) didn’t actually answer question, probably don’t know answer 2b) deliberately took opportunity make assumption based question, weak assumption, 100% assumption, order sound bitchy get upvotes ( let break further: assumption response 1) sick pandemic 2) thinks pandemic go away she’s sick it. Yeah, you’re rude fuck. 3) Hence displays reading comprehension didn’t even understand stated question. 

People downvoting decrepit bullies taking advantage position majority excuse rude others. promask doesn’t justify lack thinking ability rude anyone else whether “promask” not. well got 147 car sitting hot sun day one time maybe i'll sit car little die heat stroke corona gets me. worries, blame masks. Salud mi familia going years. US going give let thing burn population. rich isolate fine, rest country catch next 6 10 months either survive die. Certain parts country may better others obvious absolutely plan. Yeah, I'm joshing you. would say go see him. Life shorter might think. Man, lost much prob die badly underweight Texan appreciates kindness. got 30 notifications week South Korea. didn’t even download activate app. bad didn’t get go.... people flooded nyc NJ, PA, MA, CT break. They’ve better I’ve seen, it’s still pretty lackluster. provided us masks put floor marks social distancing, aren’t allowed kick anyone even they’re coughing fit. offer mask. sucks one actually works store anything it, it’s corporate making rules. Well said. Looks like reopening going well US teleporting travellers.

Rest world shuts airports, US impossible, US totally different every country world different kind human totally possible, differences inherent US compared rest humanity. bought ticket Madrid last week. kinda thought I'd rolling dice turns might right. else would clean bum? frustrating ""economy first"" people appear ones refuse take even minor actions prevent spread coronavirus. Oh man HL7. I'm flashbacks. course Trump fucktard.... I'm talking Fauci. said early (the general population) need masks. time pushed myth ""do harm good"" scare people rushing buy/hoard them. reality is, explained today, simply wanted make sure front line workers access first. Sad told truth. (I agree Fauci Americans idiots lying best) Oooh! similar people shorten ""grad school"" feel like specific. Makes sense! :) attorney general argue cant fined sitting president? everywhere coast mountains points like another world lost time pandemic happen... rarely go public places - recently Lowe's - like zombie apocalypse. Ninety percent customers unmasked. Many employees required wear masks pulled chins, leave noses uncovered. Even doctor's office exposed loose sloppy safety practices. get home breathe huge sigh relief... lived rural town SW Florida. called bus got side swiped. course cops came. talking cop seatbelts bus working. told several times never wears seatbelt. Cops often first scene accidents. Ignorance death. Damn straight is.

Democracy people, mob. Democracy puts mob, swift finality, mandate so. last question questions super easy Google yourself. never confusion transmission restricted mask supplies January. danger run masks except limited supplies stores weren’t going go medical workers anyway. 

He doesn’t need beheaded held accountable honest it. committed truth, outcome. ❤️ dad “it’s allergies.” mom super-spre ... ah never mind  anti bodies last month according article read. Everything experimental right virus new unpredictable. People recovered China caught months later. virus may even relapses, new know works!

People walk around chest recovery thinking antibody protect them. one knows 100% yet especially since scientist don’t know!  strike quit en masse. theme park run without people. Even 10% employees leaving probably leave park unable operate. travel passport Portugal, readmitted. Almost 70% asymptomatic cases damage one lung, 30% damage lungs. known yet damage permanent. Also “NY’er” here. Big news you. don’t represent majority New Yorkers admire Cuomo respect leadership time like this. Sure mistakes, showed job well. also enough integrity mistakes.

But probably agree De Blasio sucks. agree line thinking. want point one thing you.

We new virus spreading thru population unpredictable long term consequences.

we provided pretty good short term solutions keep safe help everybody understand happening. lot people seem care enough seem care all. group people going get vaccination even free.

we still kinds infectious disease problems people refuse vaccinated. know seems like common sense would get vaccinated. think need get used fact people seem perceive reality. staff masks?! Nope. great news. flu deaths estimated since testing widespread. numbers estimated using numbers have. protocol different covid since testing numbers deaths closely linked. know true mortality rate over. good post. take responsibility aliens win! Bigly! Exactly, considering response happening.  better part - learned Brexit - global corporations want offices easy reach places. travel US problem, move headquarters country. 
That means big meetings conferences happen places corporations move to. means local corporations easier time attending making connections, great business. 
And offices offer jobs people around great local job market.

I’m beginning question posts real people vs trolls bots agenda. Social media dangerous. That’s way NYC hospitals first too. They’d cleared non-Covid cases out. Expanded capacity, nothing days. wham slammed next 6-8 weeks, peaking around 1000 deaths/day. right back go. know why? every company lose 20% assets virus goes around He's longer fit leader...not like ever was. Yeah 40+ year olds staying home. fucken boomers love blaming everyone else, yet death beds riddled old people. Paging u/DrRobRedfield US. Anyone smug clearly paying attention shit show trump government 3 years. beyond obvious Trump going fuck us significant crisis came about, it’s wild managed get pegged one biggest life time.

But go alone family, risk low we're outdoor anyway? likely sunny day. Honestly, would same. We've got lot things sort US. Now's really good time.  Germany ""quick effective"" Italy ""late problematic""?! That's false unfair, Italy first western country close apply lockdown model adapting western democracy since reference China, invent acceptable rules lead way everyone else's lockdown, EU countries followed italian model 1 2 weeks later, Germany included... Germany quick effective all, applied guidelines Italy - pretty much every western country - late France Spain etc., better prepared equipped terms PPE ICU beds; e.g. 28k ICU beds ready COVID compared 5k Italy, goes ventilators: 25k vs 5k... That's actually great perspective, major concern people infecting others traveling back respective States. gonna do? Let hundreds thousands people die go work? Theres thing called unemployment ya know This. People would surprised know many things think need health, marketed products. TLDR: lack beds. lack ICU nurses/staff. guess Harry Potter World wait next year year Meh. EU shithole anyway. Piss em. conjecture. know case data collected R0 2.5. need 1-1/2.5 = 0.6 60% people already infected make virus endemic. recovery long list permanent health problems still immune catching again. don’t understand people getting serious is! concept government locally elected leaders quite common around world.

Yet every state “burned cop cars”. Wouldn’t Minneapolis surging too?! NY, etc.... actually agree better balance could found? Fuck yea lock us fuck out! idea wtf doing. Gosh, that’s tough. tried grocery orders from, like, Walmart? know it’s ideal, even got non perishables way went inside get meat produce want pick yourself, would save time actually wear mask. desire go grocery store right now, we’ve largely grocery orders Walmart local chain one usually stuff doesn’t. chain charges $3 Walmart doesn’t charge all. We’ve minor issues, husband taken going meat produce, wears P95 mask (we left built house using paint sprayer) cloth mask it.

I don’t know say good luck, seems silly. guess take care thank thinking others. hope find way ease burden!! Speculation based happened hospitals exceeded capacity I'll never wear mask, Inslee can't order wear one.

Also sort controversial thread many golden nuggets. Coming fall 2020 - John Carpenter’s Escape US


The year 2020, US fallen chaos. US government run power hungry White supremacist president ties Russian government bent bending constitution will. riots every state, deadly pandemic killing thousands, MAGA Cult rising power, lawless militarized police force maiming murdering public across country. world enough, declared US exiled zone. enter US-You’re never getting out!

Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) must go action, Escape US. That's true, countries comparable U.S. term landmass/size Russia, China, India. 

Russia/India failed spectacularly politically incorrect speak anything positive done China. Irrelevant, every time see EU think états unis work one Big Tech companies – seem absolutely clueless, think Facebook better USA government!

Also question principle: **transparency** **democratic control**

Furthermore also includes **responsibilities, fair trials**, on. Nothing offered Big Tech companies! want make profit crying loudly!

Is really far? willing give democracy ""freedom"" use Facebook Google ""without paying it""? really surrender man like Zuckerberg, acts like dictator, admires Caesar (and haircut) wants become ""Mark Great""?

And compelling data support it. Contact tracing influenza typically reveals 50% household clusters begin young child, day cares elementary schools battlegrounds children develop immune systems (which part good thing).

But covid, large contact tracing reviews shown 4% household clusters starting young children. groups children believed able spread virus, age groups ability may limited significant public health concern.

And that's decided put 4-year-old back school/daycare, along strict adherence health department guidelines shown school (masks workers children - except really young ones, non-empolyee adults enter building all, masked adults approach drop pick children, etc.). stop? NEVER STOPPED 2008.

There's range severity ""in hospital weeks"" ""about like flu"" that's completely omitted discussion. whole lot people. coward didn’t speak three years Trump? That’s me, dog want look purely basic terms saving lives, let's that:

478,000 people died of, C-19.

According [a report Lancet Global Health journal, ***almost 1.2 million children could die next six months*** due disruption health services food supplies caused coronavirus pandemic. 

The modelling, researchers Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health Unicef, found ***child mortality rates could rise much 45 per cent due coronavirus-related disruption***s, maternal deaths could increase almost 39 per cent. 

Dr Peterson said figures part reflection stringent restrictions much world prevent people leaving homes without documentation, *preventing accessing essential health care services*. 

Vaccination campaigns diseases including measles also disrupted - least 117 million children worldwide likely miss routine immunisations year. 

Dr Peterson warned trends resulted reduction “effective utilisation services” - shift which, places, could dangerous virus itself.  lockdowns heavy economic toll, could trigger rise [poverty research looks consequences disruption 118 low middle income countries, based three scenarios. Even optimistic case, access health services dropped 15 per cent child wasting rose 10 per cent, **a*****n additional 253,500 children 12,200 mothers died***. 

But worst-case scenario, services reduced 45 per cent proportion children wasting grows 50 per cent, ***could result 1.16 million additional child fatalities 57,000 maternal deaths six months***. 

[Unicef warned risk children dying malaria, pneumonia diarrhoea developing countries **""far outweighs threat presented coronavirus"".** 

**More million women children could die next year** – an increase 45 per cent children 39 per cent new mothers. 

And [nearly 100 million babies risk diseases including polio measles due cancelled vaccination [**UN warned “biblical” 265 million people risk food shortages due described “perfect storm” of coronavirus, conflict, drought and climate change.** 

That means **10 million children risk acute malnutrition,** condition mean going hungry months severe, irreversible life-long repercussions, including cognitive impairment stunted growth. 

David Beasley, head World Food Programme, told UN Security Council: [**""There real danger people could die economic impact Covid-19 virus *some* predictions numbers deaths lockdowns could cause developing world alone.

Focusing number Covid deaths entirely myopic - akin putting focus finding plaster finger cut real danger legs chopped off.  Floridian here: Shits terrifying. People act like gone. asked question. answered no. bad people feeling bad him. 

He hosted pool parties another friend moved last week. I'm done worrying worried nobody paying that. think it’s demographics. It’s spreading fast places low income workers forced work closely poor hygiene. So, migrant workers living migrant housing, plant workers Tyson, coyote ridge. West Richland isn’t types places located. (I’m WR too) Prosser sees lot migrant workers, also pretty efficient testing set up. Wait, what?! Didn’t New Orleans get ass kicked already? Hospitalizations deaths lag detected cases several weeks. Expect deaths start increase substantially 2 weeks hospital ICU bed capacity fluctuating 75%-80% past weeks. Vent capacity around 20%-30%. I've also seeing lot positive COVID patients discharged. Mostly younger demographics. Elective surgeries big revenue stream hospitals. Without it, expect hospital bankruptcies. many locations saw protests spike cases. keep drawing conclusions limited data fit narrative Yeah.

That's protests northern states created case spikes. premature reopenings cause spikes southern states long-lasting large protests. (Particularly Arizona, BLM protests Phoenix - legitimate protests, pretty small, brief, people wore masks distanced. riots looting (not really related BLM movement) - cases, people probably spread virus - like 1:10000 ratio compared idiots went bars partied. lol way people AZ treating this.. going around AZ looooooong time. Im healthy 31yo complications virus knocked ass 12 days, full three weeks energy back. FAR worse ful I've ever had. Even mild cases bad. around 100 years ago respect *lernin,* expect anything them? understand thread novel coronavirus rabies? vaccines useful treating existing infection. think every one us supports stricter quarantine protection measures understands people cannot stay home long comes getting necessities like food medication. That's going outside necessities accepting deliveries always allowed states common sense stricter mask requirements curfews.

It would ok especially everyone follows strict rules. older person goes outside buy something still safer everyone else wearing mask.

On side idiots say somehow unconstitutional require wear masks tell stay home. actually literally say people afraid virus stay home choose affect ignore precautions (more likely believe virus really dangerous). situation would actually high risk anybody afraid virus, actually compromised health, go outisde. everyone walks around things without mask increases risk even go outside masks. idiots won’t accept evidence. need tk see accept it. entrenched may entrench further. need lambast them. point, accept deaths unavoidable. ever wonder never hear traffic accidents anymore news?

The majority population accepts deaths, start living lives, blame too.

Nobody going social distance feel everything worked towards entire life going get ruined. People can't afford turtling next year. elderly choose stay home, unreasonable force everyone people give everything. Businesses people worked build entire lives bankrupt, what? 

The saying goes, another thing kill us. virus ever heard recovered immunity wears 6 months. absolutely true. Welcome Corona States America! Swine flu global thing. MERS would better example. CDC federal government big failures virus well, contributed hugely. Still, even without prior experience numbers arent even remotely similar. Seoul 6 deaths, NYC 17.5k. Im justifying it. Im refuting point. I'm sorry low reading comprehension get that, faulty memory remember points made responded to. eCoNoMy bEtTeR evER day?! makes feel lot better.

Yesterday almost 1k deaths 3.5k cases thus, rate reduced that. likely, population suffers comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension etc. making hard them.  Play pokemon!! still July,August, September, October, November December. Plus left June. I'll see 10th raise, Supremacy Clause. Sounds good figure out. Wait thought great! walkout see everyone hanging again. Meanwhile ""refugees"" pouring boatload. Nobody arguing population density plays massive role spread, yet, NYC Chicago saw spike protests. Massachusetts saw increase rate infection among protesters. Trump held event Arizona, 13th highest number cases per capita. WTF talking about? That’s exactly problem. We’ve politicized fucking pandemic. politicians dumb enough think numbers, charts modeling go away ignore it. Even worse, Dallas/Ft Worth, Austin, San Antonio also seeing similar surges per capita counties, right behind Houston’s situation. Basically one largest states America showing surges major cities time. I’m worried large Texas we’re going manage every big city getting hit time, well states going up. situation already worse March. Seriously? said situation. asinine statement right call it, matter hive mind thinks.  Hey NY, generalize West. locked early SF Bay Area we've remained locked down. Locally, am, people wear masks keep 6ft distance, higher per 100k testing capacity NY ramping tracing. 

So Cal fucking big time, sadly, consequence CA NY statewide rates hospitalizations level right now. Locally, Bay Area, case rates much lower, without sacrifice mind you. 

It's huge relief see numbers NY come down. fucking depressing see stay slowly rise CA. need case hospitalizations rates stay manageable, order keep parts economy open safely. say build big ass bridge connecting two halves country, bypassing Canada completely.

Do treat kid gloves. potentially-sustainable solution may save labor market broader economy, per recent studies consumer spending, travel, behaviors, consists main components:

1. (AND IMPORTANT COMPONENT) Unified, coherent, data-driven messaging robust national network testing/contact tracing federal government administered public health officials.

2. comprehensive national education initiative designed communicate severity COVID-19 effective safety measures taken mitigate danger, well concurrent campaign highlighting harm caused online disinformation.

3. implementation economic tripwire unemployment benefit increases/extensions immediately triggered result specific labor market conditions (e.g. unemployment rates increasing specific threshold relative 3-month moving averages); completely removes gamesmanship issue benefit expansion automatic require approval.

4. Targeted, ongoing, direct payments lower-income workers disproportionately impacted job losses resulting COVID-19; lower-income households spend money receive, thus ensure monetary velocity despite increasing monetary stock. sectors workers primarily employed (e.g. Leisure Hospitality, Services) taken hardest hits pandemic, difficult workers educational attainment level find new employment thing continues.

5. Ongoing direct, targeted federal grants small businesses impacted sectors, especially employing low-income workers high-income areas higher levels rent burden. subsidization must continued pandemic controlled, larger firms impacted sectors must allowed fail serve function domestic utility (e.g. cruise lines).

Spending reductions top 25% earners account 66% spending declines resulting pandemic. Fed printing money like mad going directly market. seen, however, despite Wall Street’s boom (which absolutely bubble) stimulus checks sent Americans, wealthy accumulating money saving (rather spending) it. due abysmal failure federal response COVID-19, precipitated psychosocial effects consumer anxiety led wealthiest essentially cordon broader society rages (because afford to).

Anyway, handle going on, finally, good idea keep economy humming much possible. problem leadership climate characterized anti-intellectual populist rhetoric preventing us enacting this. Amen.

​This top head. That’s lot people. visit offices make sure didn’t say they’re employing many people tax saving? far away everything... it’s hour London 2 Paris, 3 Frankfurt, Madrid Amsterdam, exactly far from? joke, know long immunity lasts course always chance variant...... Vaccine helps produce antibodies it. virus mutating enough ""no herd immunity"" vaccine hoping protect long. Right, projections prior 3 months anywhere close anything. one hospital. Overall, Texas ICUs plenty spare capacity. Everyone wanted vacation March bored.  *far* one biggest contributors Mexico's coronavirus disaster government's handling pandemic. president literally told people pray away virus hug other. Living proof left-wing confer competency. thought every single person taught “safety first” since 4 years old. hospital delay procedure, unless something necessary like broken hip woman labor. Can't shove baby back 2 weeks. us Frontline get fucked capital F again. hate tell trucker get stuff trucking industry bottom dollar freight rates keep eating many lost ass shutdown, doubt medical staff country going able keep without proper supply ppe (thanks making sure ready government). another shutdown one getting handouts gov allow doubt people comply. Buckle boys girls going bad. mom's muttering this: Things seem decently controlled area, government making masks mandatory opening economy people work stop complaining? mandatory masking less palatable killing economy?

That's general gist.  Texas ? Flagstaff: testing people doctors order

Phoenix/Scottsdael: testing people mayo clinic orders (?)

so figures saying 1 3 people THOUGHT virus sent testing SITES tested positive.

if - zero value far see ""generalising"" covid's spread....


edit: 
**No symptoms = test

The Banner testing began ""soft launch"" Tucson last week, testing sites officially opened Monday. nasal swab tests processed Sonora Quest Laboratories, turnaround time three five days get idk like 3.9% EU GDP comes tourism US minor part since statistics include internal travel. 863 deaths today.  

You saying...? 

NY &amp; NJ likely passed peaks, dragging national deaths vs weeks ago. 
AZ, CA, FL, TX starting see widespread community infection.  Hospitals reaching capacity

[They one hospital near capacity nothing unusual. Hospitals run ICU beds quite frequently. Texas overall 60% ICU capacity, average. know I'm making later~  would absolutely never acceptable, pandemic otherwise. phase 3 coming ya’ll...no issues. Movie theaters gyms!! /s V Vendetta them. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mean Massachusetts also one strictest lockdowns nation well steadily dropping numbers. feel like people good idea need wear mask outside point france uk italy people dead per capita united states. mind u france Italy's economys expected crumble next 3-6 months united states recovered strongly. think united states handled covid poorly besides germany dont think major EU country faired better. lets call fuck trump. mind new york city within 1-2 weeks away less 10 new cases per day. cool fucking people Texas. states mentality towards fucked. It’s almost like advanced warning American, I’m proud Europe Remember, parents grand parents happy sacrifice economy. /s Trump also siphoned resources parents visited Disney Word mid February celebrate dad’s 70th birthday. got back probably 24 hours would thought terrible idea based reading.

Crazy think shit virus one testing. 

It blows mind stupid people are. see second wave Spanish flu think...good thing won’t happen us. It’s truly unbelievable. 😂 Haha catch that! 

Seriously though, kinda shocked Germany March April EVERYBODY followed orders government gave. kinda gave insight countries manage rally behind war efforts. effortless everybody adapted. think longest time government approval 97% something crazy like that. Absolute one saw coming. voted Gillum wasnt strong candidate imo. I'm surprised Desantis election. think would hard believe Gillum would done worse job pandemic, I'm even sure would better governor.

Its really frustrating that's best party could come with. __literally__ put, issues divide people. exactly dealing moral ramifications abortion transgenderism Civil War... Lindsay Ellis amazing video essay protest songs Bush era perfectly encapsulates need scream void. Green Day prominent talking point essay cannot recommend enough. CDCs numbers kind hot garbage. Best estimate right 0.6-1%, probably closer 0.6%. Many wore masks. One could argue cause bit noble fajita trio Chili's.

There lot cases occuring bars restaurants, search see. Also, studies subject. big deal, needs dealt with. I'm drawing attention instead sadly necessary protests. US it’s getting old. governor apparently one them. Los Angeles protested rioted. live Massachusetts one protest turned looting places CA TX went solid week. downplaying covid want clarify 90% capacity covid. Careful, 7.4 hit Mexico today That’s fine gotta quarantine two weeks Came say that. Take gander across pond, BoJo...it’s future. We’re headed curve hill again. agree overall ICU use alarming. find odd we're 6 months pandemic, way information professionals, public are, I'm quoting ""states unfortunately taking example preparing it."" 

Something off. I'm jumping conclusions denying virus real careful. Time tell. NY shows larger picture going right direction. NY large numbers deaths due placing infected patients nursing homes thus causing overflow... also many field hospitals never used ones saw patients. 

Again, know ppl jump questioning anything ""this freaking bad"" sub take questioning things downplay. intention all. things simply make sense. Maybe that’d damning wasn’t actually SARS 2 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

That's works... studies done see protests account rise cases younger Americans? know Japan include testing major part response, seems weird truly successful, links? local sheriffs decide enforce shutdown. Many sheriffs come shutting Air travel really expensive. tack cost test ends rise significantly.

You land travel (and should), people try dodge simply raising cost. I'll try that. Thank you. Texas here, y'all go f**k yourselves!! scenes eyes popping sockets sheer disgust. Yes, stop spread. didn’t think sooner? Much easier injecting windex hand sanitizer works much better Hydroxychloroquine. say doesn’t exist won’t. Sorry sound like idiot question here. Today mist sprayer fan unnamed event(sarcasm). idea no? goes! child polio ... entirely. still allowed ""essential travel"" *and requires documentation.* includes passing Canada get Alaska... incredibly stupid beyond belief ferry system goes Bellingham Alaska without stopping Canada. People complaining expensive... dumb one business travellers going far right now. Several American families fined breaking rules, including one family actively gloating restaurant easy find loophole. kinda sucks us charge responsible adults. GOP get away think long-term gutting social security, Medicare, et al. know simply destroyed programs, they'd voted out, programs would reinstated. Possibly (gasp!) *more generous form*!

So play game calling Ponzi scheme then... writing legislation turn Ponzi scheme. assure *existing* beneficiaries benefits remain, appeasing Boomer ""Fuck got mine"" mentality. say future beneficiaries phase get chump change refund, thus appeasing Boomer ""Fuck stupid kids give money"" mentality. 

You'll notice strategy relies entirely appeasing baby boomers. worked extremely well decades. boomers way out, like addicts looking another hit smack, GOP cannot imagine anything appealing boomer grievances greed. 

We honestly disenfranchise people born 1965 point. quicker fix various problems. Oh, young. Two years nothing dude. next issue pop up.

Jeez need look history realize shit happens. Texas doesn’t care science! videos I've seen show faces, blur out. enough protect privacy also showing hospital beds full ever turn page. I’ve banned visitors yard indefinitely. Norway, Denmark Finland. EU countries I’m sure knew that... work hospital attest community transmission FL increasing rapidly. seen sharp spike confirmed cases June, significantly cases initial wave March - early May. People getting hung gouping Americans

Ironically thanks philosophy individualism make petition send eu actually this? antibodies last 2-3 months? know people getting reinfected. insane levels. whole State must rife virus. Make sense. Forgot Sinivac one. hope least one pass phase 3 trial. person posted something “purely political”. going remove comment, too? He's copying pasting thing over. states getting hammered right now. feds want bail out, though, want states cut things like education. Loophole!! sure. It’s criminal health care even addressed so-called “CARES” act. Also military jet flyovers too, forget!!!

oh yeah, loved shit. Makes sitting ass day comfort home worth it. me, broken metric. Sure numbers locked, useful, 7000 negatives turn positives easily. makes look like they're bragging many tests wasted prove someone negative time test taken COVID symptoms show 2-14 days infection spikes started showing 7 days ago. noticeable numbers coming areas protests age group participated protests. link I'd definitely watch I'm American idea fall. 4th grade 2nd grade 2 yo baby way. school sent letter today saying they're basically planning business usual fall, bought masks kids state REQUIRES it. Ugh. feel safe sending like there's nothing going on, many options. May look homeschooling year. That's wrote initially. knows, might prevented protests growing bigger, thus exposing people. And? like put non covid patients elsewhere. know news included overall statistics nothing travel US responded covid-19. live? No, incubation period honestly closer 5 days. We're seeing effects exponential growth Never attribute much one day's number. Florida alarming increase (all way 80) yesterday afternoon, today right back line flat trend. could easily data dump. Well fat fuck, mean... Yeah. Yeah, that's true, think forgettable since mostly reasonably well (i.e. SEA countries trust China, all). Iran still Asia, technically, yeah, guess say first Western countries, it'll correct. Iran second peak well, though. Thanks! Disagree. opinion informed average I’d say bc scientific literacy every non science person lacks. sitting talking viruses day, gives scientific literate people leg up, *Sad.* 

*Low energy.* 

*Pathetic.* watch Fox, get told democratic plot hurt president make people idiots? happened Trump Administration pit states bidding wars medical supplies. idk upvoted really good info U.S. sick. coronavirus, stupidity, ignorance, lack empathy willingness protect fellow citizens. Unfortunately, eradicating sickness easy taking anti-viral putting mask. don’t know answer is, sickness costing us whole lot. moving. starting re-surge states first hit it. See California Washington. I'd monitoring Ohio numbers wondering second wave was. check Texas yeah it.  Japanese woman returned Taiwan tested positive [upon Still updates? fortunate effective leadership populous that’s isn’t half angry half-wits. Zero died state need article I'm sure preexisting issues. Corona threat 20  LA much larger population. protests helping much  Yep that's another part process. say skip safety testing clinical trials? Ffs no. Yeah, south seeing lot spikes right now. California’s done consistently bad throughout pandemic. want blame fact they’re popular tourist spot, popular areas like NY done excellent job controlling spread. important. angry want many people understanding, defunded destroyed education reaping results it. think that's exactly Trump thinking entire time Funny thing. spanish flu went away 3 years evolved less fatal.  sith deals absolutes think depends area, think areas testing driven LabCorp, etc lot less affected

In area go CVS get test use private company lab work believe, testing locations remain available although they’ll also busier. usually something happens, always. take smallpox. ravaged world hundreds years.

smallpox threat, one 2 diseases ever destroyed entirely (the rinderpest). 

Malaria similar, though thankfully contagious. malaria still kills 600k year, much heart disease US. bad, makes mosquitoes deadly animals humans. attempted destroy malaria, failed. second attempt appears imminent equally drastic (we used DDT mass first time). genetically altered mosquitoes make immune malaria. genes dominant eventually, mosquitoes rendered immune. You, friends family members probably taken lot ""Chinese made medicines"" without knowing it. lot generics ""made"" India, people know many APIs made China, sent India elsewhere formulated packed. FDA performs audits foreign facilities make medicines imported US. Chinese made vaccines need get FDA approval. worry much, China keen export US anyway, since big population. anyone else get them, sure BRIC Belt &amp; Road countries get US.  death numbers yet match uptick cases FL's demographic data. 

Would live validate this. *reads title*
""Lmao Americans""
*sees tag*
""It's kinda scary figured one out"" interesting states didnt lockdown, ""problematic"" it, well. None 12 states resisted lockdowns top 20 states listed percapita Covid deaths.

You would *expect* states didnt lockdown lots issues come much worse states lockdown.

But somehow didnt happen. Phatest maybe! happens voters stop valuing basic competence elected officials everything bigger Texas right? age ranges Texas. politics now.  Left want destroy economy make Trump look bad. Either coronavirus lockdowns blm protests. Longer lockdown goes, jobs laid off.  include white collar, middle class jobs. one working, tax revenue falls, sales fall, businesses go bankrupt. fits worldview makes feel selfr righteous ""Public Health Officials Targeted \*Stupid Americans"" 


FTFY point would wear masks ? Yea it’s way months Two 17 year olds died Florida since Saturday. post article. many tri-state areas know talking about....yet I'm sure right. Unfortunately solution let people get sick fastest pace doesn’t overwhelm hospitals. expert advice two months now: Let young healthy people work keep things moving isolate elderly Sick. 

For whatever reason states went lockdown instead. people believe goal prevent cases. 

The goal never prevent cases, rather slow enough handle serious cases. non serious asymptomatic cases irrelevant experts. Check CIDRAP details. don’t lie. I'm saying I'm exactly crossroads, living Hong Kong 2yo take care of. 

Do jump start american dream, stay take risk China. Surprisingly somewhat bleak hell like still. (ofc choices take binary US/China - choose US).

I read official state-run media know. wipe ass even.  thoughts people suck. know would never happen, I'd love hospitals check every patient's social media. anti-mask anti-shutdown posts, people go back line. ventilators people right thing taken care first. issue order forbidding local entities requiring masks? Like week two ago? Even outside recommended wear one can't stay 6' people.  would generally include walking jogging public sidewalks pass people. 

For wear one biking, I'd hold breath pass, I've started wearing loose mask (and holding breath pass) help reinforce social norm. slow testing. Problem solved. /s ""One nation's leading voices cancer predicts number people die breast colorectal cancer U.S. increase nearly 10,000 next decade COVID-19's impact oncology care.

If actually anesthesiologist claim I'm sure know critically read news article understand quotes.

I know everything cancelled countrywide, point making original comment everyone thread treating way were, elective surgeries breast implants real procedures real effects morbidity mortality future

I think taking increased cancer deaths seriously blowing things proportion mean 300k EoY, right? Yeah, Texas voted state government. Ditto FL GA. Ridiculous... let families incarcerated spend money. whole point stimulate economy. Glad self preservation instincts got South. Absolutely! Many people severe cases (discussed article) likely long term effects, scope really know, know years road. one knows course disease going go. scary! original comment limited minor lung inflammation experienced asymptomatic cases discussed original article, generally clear rather quickly. thanks expanding alarming. watched ppl say ""I call bs"" positive virus news put Penn State admitted read comment ""oh yeah, we're definitely fuced"" bs sensational hyperbole headline article obscure source. nuts. end June. know virus Italy China last year. 6 months reports re-infections, besides ones debunked false positives/negatives. get new, get everyone assuming virus unlike literally every virus we've ever seen. three towns. Microscopic molecules normally form gas result bacteria gut, definitely particles. risk sounding like dick.. quick Google search tell need know. Wait long enough virus go away.

After kills enough people hamper transmission... Germany get hefty fine, 10k € based whether alone large group. Can't wait read dumbest 10% people internet conspiracy ""fake news"" likely deter people thinking coming tho don’t anecdotal experience this, think would issue mostly people memorize 1 phrase time English, anyone put sentences together infer context figured what’s going think Le sigh.... thing - countries panicked introduced measures never used previous pandemics / epidemics previous poster says, way ' monitor, enforce even detect efficacy'. Hammer Dance approach - playing Whack-a-Mole sledgehammer. knock effects devestating. 

Maybe panic justified, maybe wasn't. easy see *why* happened - UK told 0.5 million could die without lockdown. politician going say that's acceptable keep country going normal?

The Swedes take figures face value. relied expertise made call no-one else willing make. brave foolish? 

OK - 5,000 people died. That's pretty sad. viruses kill immunity. That's fact life. 

But - said every country beginning two choices;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Shutdown, close 'non-essential' businesses, make millions unemployed, destroy economy, close education, force people stay indoors 12-16 weeks, close everything including vital hospital procedures, or:
2. Deal fact - vast majority population would unnafected Covid - approx 500-800 people every million die, would end stages lives. And, btw, without health services collapsing.

.. one country planet - *at least -* would looked Option 2 serious strategy. one. 

The Swedish strategy currently vilified media suit Covid-1984 narrative. 

The Swedish strategy currently vilified countries justify dranconican destructive measures introduced. 

And Swedish strategy currently vilified many members public bought politicians media sold option table - stay home, save lives.. words, say committing murder. Monterey County pretty big spike; almost entirely Salinas Valley affecting farm workers.
The protests around relatively small Infect? heard 2 months bad states ""its flu"", ""its nothing"" , ""It affects poorly run Democtatic states"" take shit elsewhere. fact NY, NJ, CT went hell almost 3 months states prepare them. Instead rushed reopen made still makes sense. Look stock market. Everyday dropping surge states yet fools yelling ""open up"" look now. yes anyone states bad authorities don;t care stay NY, NJ, CT. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Lack leadership.  Specific question, take look [this definitely **not** trending downwards.

You may also want take look [this Texas Medical Center (TMC) site projects occupancy surge capacity. 

Interestingly, [this shows current capacity would good one keep eye on.

Also source, monitoring mitigation metrics. They're brainwashed believing Fox News right-wing outlets. want believe ""their team"" can't wrong. part breakdown political discourse USA red vs blue time. feel sense dread felt back March except it’s justified city 200-500 cases every day. live 63 year old risk father everyone age completely ignoring virus exists. feel like friends forget I’m willing go fucking parties right now. ICU capacity state exceeded 2 weeks Trump defunding 7 testing sites even though already testing 20% positive running tests 7:30 every day. used worried stupid stuff like senior year high school online couldn’t even give shit now, don’t want destroy city family. feel hopeless feel like nobody cares watch world burn nothing psychopath president incompetent state leadership refuse pass enforceable orders virus exploding. whole country fucking incompetent never embarrassed American. Sorry feel like shit. see effectively wear mask work out. also question effective mask would heavy breathing time.  


An indoor gym would absolutely last place I'd go, period, right maybe crowded indoor bar.  Months? Indefinitely? southern states didn’t change anything states things control slowly going back baseline. 

Most highly impacted states beginning talk stopping elective surgeries NOW. follow trajectory NY etc might 2-3 month delay things. Maybe day makes difference hundred people pale comparison number needing hospital resources COVID. 

Sad end day preventable.  literally pay euthanized. anything covid related besides fact agree it? want it? let others live way want live. People idiots. may language barrier issues areas think issue awful messaging government self centered idiots. live white area seen similar things people speak English first (only) language. Left right left right  serious, man sorry that. sorry financial situation lack transportation. i'm large majority country car simply can't anything. think (s)he's trouble qualifying. ""*We make sure virus come plane,*"" 

Is based traveler origin? based flight origin? connection/layover? interstate highway checkpoints?

This seems like posturing. Locking borders would hard (on top unconstitutional I'm pretty sure). I'd rather keep hotels car rentals reopening. depth bad yet sunk broadly, already they're losing business. Wait weeks. confirm, Florida already confirmed 5,500 cases today 3 hours ago. Absolutely crushing single highest day recorded cases 4,000. 

If governor cared keeping citizens safe making sure Trump’s balls handled properly. Trust me, landlords fine. 

Rentals booming. I’m married scientist , she’s shops , you’ll wait opinion , it’s worth think it’s great news . ideas get people wearing masks land that’s already Heaven’s waiting room?

Seriously. billionaire FL hire out-of-work actors dress like Grim reaper hand masks spray maskless skunk spray public? Anything? Making jab one president's comments recently Hope Lt. Gov Dan Patrick said worth sacrifice lives economy occupies bed gets turned away. America nasally? Everyone else going throat. German virologists say methods equally sound, quite different unpleasantness. example facing known risks known consequences. 

In case covid-19 enough known consider much risk short term long term health. Alternatively first person engaged risk get see people first make informed decision said risk. 

The point one knows exactly virus capable of. I'll take chances hunker shit cools off. Well course know him. He's me. Yes. There's enough COVID-19 cases remaining China determine effective would preventing infection. run phase 3 test population experiencing current outbreak.  stopped admitting patients wouldn’t problem, it’s Trump solution changing position new information becomes available bad? Ninja edit, lol. looking original. changed 28x 5x. Ya good friends ft worth staying locked down.

We same. changed really. there's vaccine I'll start loving normally doubt care. Many provinces mainland gone 2 months without local case ""Assuming incubation period distribution mean 5.2 days separate study early COVID-19 cases, inferred infectiousness **started 2.3 days symptom onset peaked 0.7 days symptom onset.** estimated proportion **pre-symptomatic transmission 44%.** Infectiousness estimated decline quickly within 7 days. Case study Diamond Princess estimated 74% transmission happened pre-symptomatically. 

 documented lot cases, could distinguish asymptomatic pre-symptomatic cases well studies involved follow ups. studies follow-ups, clear majority infectious people asymptomatic time study go develop symptoms later, making pre-symptomatic transmitters. 

True asymptomatic cases hard study, know research target infectiousness particular interview saying likely rare. Aside repatriation flights won’t commercial flights September earliest. Two week quarantine test arrival well. antibody tests wrong 50% time like CDC said percentage becomes dubious best worst case scenario cut number clean half. Controlling interstate travel US basically like controlling intra-Schengen EU travel times 10x. really complicated let numerous problems inside EU like long slow queues borders, problem supply chains etc.

The EU member states sovereignty internal borders suspend Schengen agreement temporarily, even built-in mechanism it.

Thing I'm even sure legally ok actually control US. legal US states suspend control borders, maybe even unilaterally? Like state police even state guard? 104% tomorrow? added, mean want resort use them. here's link post Props also Vietnam produced catchy jingle release March 4 - whole four days US released piece work (and retweeted leader, ofc).

It's amazing stark differences countries, really. One hardest things covid-19 situation mentally dealing harsh reality goddamned stupid much humanity is. sobering. n95 masks you’d like give us? Ha. Yo way fully agree you, it’s disgusting. c Pog. great dexamethasone helps, potentially serious side effects? Obviously nothing bad death respiratory failure I'm curious think Kids much greater danger dying commuting school dying coronavirus. Even break countys, make senses.

Like Tippacone: 544 cases vs 8 deaths

But Bone: 400 cases vs 41 deaths


It's craziness No, I'm fairly sure aeresol exposure virus live long surfaces. Even surgical masks, like wearing, allow air sides. mask mandate NY, one maybe three people entire store wearing one back then. stores even hassling employees wanted wear masks, claiming would frighten customers! talks like airborne, moves like airborne. sure airborne. Airlines could start selling oxygen since planes grounded using bottles. Tests slaves obvioulsy hug gf want. need government baby-step life going hard life.

Just use common sense. gf infected, two hugging can't possibly spread virus. whaaaattt?? can't find it. Los Angeles GO TIME. dust storms Sahara desert help bring phosphorus nutrients Amazon forest. 

It's funny think interconnected world really is, Sahara desert, maybe Amazon forest either (or big now). 


Also, guys respiratory problems, allergies asthma, extra careful when/if dust storms reaches area. former Olympic swimmer South Africa damn near died month said could hardly walk 10 mins without completely gassed... want part shit Might easy already get quite visitors Japan. Maybe focus marketing Koreans well. Hawaii gets coronavirsus control attractive countries control looking vacation spots stuck quarantine months. There's always marketing do, increase language accessibility (lots translated Japanese much Korean Chinese). Sadly Department Justice struck mandatory quarantine meaning people mainland come over. everyone subject 14 day quarantine arrival. Honestly think tourists mainland keep coming attractive place visit countries coronavirsus control. Basically, either or. either get tourists mainland lose tourists countries getting coronavirsus control keep mainlanders help control coronavirsus become attractive countries coronavirsus control. Yeah makes sense unless friend's house bar. Lol, none political parties gave shit ppl virus. America definitely money shut down. like said, come money everything else, this. us trained thinking, economy fall apart shut down. America still making sure people DC Congress Senate get paid. sit there, absolutely nothing help, take 3to 4 months send checks American people. us trained. Government, world 3rd world country this. realize work us. job, would fired years ago job. insane US Government works way😠 far accurate. 46-54 year old even represented. thanks love here. I've living years. countries unique there's way life love america thought thing, probably yes? Lol lying, numbers! AH...European companies made they've even picked strains yet 2020-2021 season...of Coronavirus delayed that. ~~I know facetious, case forgive me, increased testing cause hospitalizations go up.~~ get it. goal minimize percieved impact Covid?

How's working way? goal minimizing covid deaths serve? Trump says wants fewer tests, going help economy?

If anything, overcount covid deaths, blatantly clear United States taking Covid seriously all, reflected fact economy crumbling death rate sky high.

Countries panicked, went overboard (but really) severe lockdowns recovery. Countries DGAF (the United States) completely fucked.

Pretending Covid serious *makes everything worse*, **especially economy**. Taking Covid seriously means economy recover faster. “Although well-recognized virus SARS-CoV-2, causative agent COVID-19, acquired exposure fomites”

Really? thought contact tracing showing virtually spread due droplets carried air short distances, via surfaces (fomites) common flu. half city already it? weird! It’s going away everywhere else world except U.S.! joke. never happen. People dont give fuck. hate doomsday person, really trying positive, absolutely screwed.

There protest today Scottsdale, Az protest masks crying loud. zero faith ability us country mitigate spread. Glad see see hypocritical, particular beliefs.  Another fucking idiot. Another selfish ass individual zero capacity understand hell going around him. happens live fucking bubble surround even idiots. 

Not that, fucking audacity start Gofundme stupidity. what’s wrong people America. deal shit we’re dealing scale we’re on. Fuck stupid ass Facebook friends tried say pushing narrative well. really don’t understand argument. 

They go support protests government abuse power insisting danger overblown entirely fake, screaming everything open masks. 

But others go protest government abuse power literally executing people streets blatantly ignoring rights everyone without obvious money shit fit dangers spreading COVID want protests stopped force. 

Which it? minimal danger requires government intervention danger justifies major violence everyone area forced curfews even early hours?

So stupid hypocritical. Im home keep lungs safe.. I’d probably survive getting covid itd suck compromised lungs next 50 years life

All hikes wont able go even that. FB claims even evil. claims **mask** makes things worse, kill you, etc etc. ever absurd claims, followed justtheflu. Ah ok own, put out. 

Your spreadsheet treasure. federal government hand waved pandemic individual governors states. “whole” United States coronavirus concerned. lying. Japanese man returning Taiwan got tested positive. 

 Texas Medical Center ""one hospital.""

It largest medical complex world 60 medical institutions, 21 hospitals.

Texas big state, capacity outside Houston. Patients require Intensive Care though least well suited multi-hour transport hospitals away additional capacity. someone stops breathing, really help tell there's ICU bed available 3 hours away. Actually bet pretty common clustered spread is. everyone spreads well super spreaders infect people - infects everyone particular social group outside it. definitely end ICU often medical test know Canada could weather 2nd lockdown though. sounds like meant started asking people share drinks group instead making multiple drinks.

I'd say seems extremely unlikely, Please re-read headline post ""The EU plans ban US travelers indefinitely haphazard COVID-19 response."" mention China dude? bringing pointless opinion something almost half year ago? can't tell serious trying troll me, either way, God bless. lot wearing masks that's why. Compare Trump rallys almost nobody wearing masks. No-Testing Boogaloo slowly isolating due virus it’s like nobody fucking cares. back record breaking numbers, shutting testing centers can’t profit it. everything money America? can’t help feel deeply sorry us citizens, everyone else acting like ok. It’s fucking ok. banned countries, working countries come cure, hospitals soon flooded again, everyone like “hey, let’s party!!” Wtf? wasn't. Obviously away lower chance transmission, difference 2m 1m, especially face coverings, negligible. Might rate going Vietnam international arrivals? I'd curious many deaths Florida ""pneumonia"" compared normal Yeah replying them. lol. see CARES act extended? I'm sure keep posting. common knowledge. Yeah hate people say “they brought themselves!” like... alright everyone voted we’re stuck insanity that’s cool guess.   fact idea long acquired immunity lasts? 2 weeks huh? sure popular time frame. 2 weeks flatten curve! wait, we're die 2 weeks! 

How full ICU's normally? make sit empty time?

Rona!!!!!!! replied typing, oh well. No. fucking way. 90% yesterday? feel like saw headline Houston looking death count day chart. seems strange trend fewer deaths every 6-7 days. undoubtedly would seen “liberal agenda”

Anyone know hard move Canada? That's I've saying beginning. carve exceptions rules, suddenly everyone's exception. everyone's supposed locked everyone's feeling fairly treated.

The second start allowing anyone extra, suddenly feels unfair people decide dgaf. term you’re looking is, “triage.” Prioritize patients others minimize total deaths. Florida 5,000-what?! new cases. New York 581 yesterday.

NYS worst trying stay healthy. stay downward trend new cases, hospitalizations, deaths.

There nothing petty this. lol beijing went second lockdown china collapsed agree unfortunately done. Fraud also huge issue unemployment claims delayed payments short period. took 500+ calls single day get human could fix it. I'm one lucky ones. right, wrong here.

There (as article) 30k new cases day US now. Many LESS problematic scenario given. However, case detected one quarantined, removed community spread.

The US currently 5% death rate, also seeing long term damage done survive, even asymptomatic. going lead lifelong health issues early deaths infected. 

The people get tested, community spread, faster get control. already past point able control this, trying keep dead injured count down. incredibly naive think elective surgeries tit jobs Botox. want listen cancer patients getting chemo treatments cancelled? Dad's heart transplant put hold indefinitely?

Suspending elective surgeries kill people, many covid. kidding, US could beat Trump fuck supporters impressionable enough bring tribalism it. fuck refusing wear mask become political statement. problem literally happened states. Everyone else around world worked together shows add note, test expedite travel. case anyone listening course it’s dirty myrtle cases went undiagnosed. deaths cases went undiagnosed, well. Hope tomorrow better. Hey! Go watch Stephen Gardner Stimulus Updates Youtube. always cheers up. Huh? lol. seriously doubt anything talk someone like public. internet sure makes feel confident morally superior. tough typing computer. remember, least according data New York, people get infected members sharing household. Open windows, take measures even you’re showing symptoms.

9. Many grandma lived there, right side Centraal Station. Memories.... want talk seven State Regional Coalition here's article [Cuomo 7 state medical equipment Yosemite gets packed summer I'm talking Wuhan rn essential working makes 2.13 hour.  Count Pennsylvania too. Drastically reducing want put real border Mason Dixon line. Stop south respreading north. thoughts exactly. half workers NYC NJ something? put basement Hoboken.  Yeah dramatic stuff happens overseas. Pandemic? Ok lol, next, government taken oligarchs? Hahaha hmm. ""Oh ya betcha I'm Canadian. Here's hawtdish made kid's hoke-y game"".  comes Americexit (a mer eh cecks it) Well coordinated federal effort lmao. Time smell coffee recovery rate still high even especially implemented masks social distancing. DEATH trap like previous poster saying. never going enough hospital beds. Reopening carefully plan. YESSSS gimme money back flights then!! really nice case numbers. 21 district closed management, IIRC. What's point article talking Wuhan. 😘 again, want happen? want private company work “just pay you” scary virus “over?” personally decide it’s “safe enough?” conveniently last eternity course.  supposed mean? Fun fact: farm workers domestic workers exempt union protections! Good point!  disgrace right It’s late. can’t stopped now. Yeah that's big thing I'll look for, supposed key sign mild infection. mean, like make Federal response worse. anyone feel they've missing critical info President's covid briefings? Can’t say blame them. enjoy seeing bunch MAGAts refuse anything mitigate risks Covid literally treated like inferior threat. Forgive know much regional point mentioned. However, yeah can't indefinitely lockdown, compromise get people solving issue Want know something else that's funny EU travel Booking Holdings provides online bookings flights, hotels travel-related services

Senator Kelly Loeffler:

March 6th - Shares Booking Holdings purchased 
March 10/11th - Shares Booking Holdings sold 
March 11th end day- Trump announces Europe travel restrictions 

[Europe even know travel restrictions Trump made Loeffler cleared wrongdoing. annoying orange lead 100k dead Americans. I’ll vote real orange Trump. Oh got part. enjoy pissing contests. dad part threw me. Beijing word WeChat lockdown think do. said ""response"", mandate.

In case, U.S. unifying guidance. mixed messages essentially state-by-state free all. Hmmmm side world? China shut capital city much less cases this. see let go by! feel like managers trying rationalize positions making employees come feel needed. everybody work home accountable it, managers really needed? sith deals absolutes fair, owners fox news public statements actually news ""entertainment"". know people say ""the mask protects others, yourself"", personally believe that's true absolute statement.

For Covid positive person, absolute true statement. mechanisms masks work better 1 way pretty well documented, counterfactual countries wear masks require people wear masks shown masks single important tool stop spread.

Masks stop covid postive people spreading two reasons:

The ""droplet nucleus"" fancy way saying aerosolized droplet, much larger virus itself, exhaled get caught inside mask. 

The second reason droplets getting stuck inside mask strengthen barrier, stop exhaled outside mask. 

Masks \*don't\* stop inhaling particles regular cotton mask couple reasons:

The droplet nucleus referred earlier starts shed quickly exhaled. means eventually virus floating air, protected coating might prevent entering mask. 

To give idea small virus is, smaller single particle smoke.  
So, virus enters cotton mask get pulled inside protective layer moisture inside mask. point, longer protected virus inhale moisture get face, lips, ultimately inhaled. 

I wanted explain heard before. 

The counterfactual consider countries worn masks prior covid. Japan Hong Kong worn masks public quite while, I'm totally sure colds going around not, still seems worked well them. 

Japan 17,000 cases vs 2.3m cases US. even one thousand people died this. worn masks long time. 

Hong Kong, city 8 million people 1178 cases covid 6 deaths. 

Masks work. selfish wear mask know status covid. needed told ? couldn’t people Arizona, Texas, California Florida learn anything watching NY world suffer. bizarre, living parallel world ? Alright shitty day work today absolute CUNT day I’m sorry. 

You wanted make literally spell didn’t you? 

:) r/coronavirusatwork point know I'll see fiancé again. He's European country. basically can't find country we're legally allowed order get married. FML. Absolutely. Good point remember regional Partners 7th State coalition want treat seriously kind thinking drugs war drugs. needed win hearts minds. There's way could defeat drug insurgency without support populace. Burning drugs made stronger, turns out. Hey, two, pipe down, hard numbers solve question months. Now, say thank Arizona go sit down. “freedom culture” mean constitution? Right! Let die alone like sick animals. Take sign times. countries go tough unpopular lockdown measures relax

No circumstantial cases get reviewed... person likely quarantined let in. That's basically works? Possibly. you’re dependent upon yourself, you’re master. Guess “master” would socialistic society? Fuck EU. Ban coming leave NATO. don’t blame them. White people poor. poor due systemic racism. 

Think generational wealth possible, redlining impacting access proper education, parents access education (due race) able help kids access good education reason. France, Spain, Italy higher deaths per capita US though. guy calling Cuomo murderer considered political mods? Okay.  Hi Jared. Hey thanks death wishes guys, Americans trying, least am. Shit thought dumbass coming around. 

Dude bipolar something? what? turn to? Lockdown Wuhan lifted month now. been? setting records testing, close 100,000 day now. Weeks ago highest 40 50 thousand day. Testing equal New York total double cases. let go April due Covid19 work legit ""we know happen USA"" discussion point. Like knew Canada would get shit together evetually Trump?? (Circa march global pandemic ""it go away higher temp"" Trump)  

Global industry pulling hair atm bet. hearing Arizona, North Carolina, Flordia, California states getting worse also. States like Utah Alaska starting see rising cases also. ends bunch April New York Cities summer, going clusterfuck. Probably we've bombarded scam callers running fucking rampant last decade one answers phone anymore. Arizona I'd answer actually knew calling. Weather get one work less 4 years? half agree. Dictators stay benevolent, problem happens die? Without rule law, there's way transition power case next dictator quite benevolent. supposed feel this? heard yet refuse call anything else, thank  back it’s being... I'm one people get mean mugged every time drive. barely left house Canada months. learned anything herd immunity prisons hit hard? terrible what's happening there, they're almost totally enclosed environments entire population getting exposed. enough avoid exponential growth. Sorry, no.

Masks polite. protect much protect neighbour. 

We plenty space here. Besides, what's meters friends? numbers area BLM protests.

Why would matter dangerous like saying months? Oooh, light blue package? also established sun rise tomorrow, probably will. *only sith deals absolutes* - Obi Wan Kenobi agreed, 40 players already tested positive shitshow even gotten ground. Curious see plan crowds distancing etc. live Korea, somewhat avoiding US products (particularly anything fresh recently shipped) couple months now. thinking making Amazon order, ""...no wait."" days ago store browsing fresh fruit, saw green seedless looked great price ok. saw they're California - never mind, got Korean-grown oranges instead.

Thanks. mistake. changed felony misdemeanor. still ridiculous see. one things it'd fine people take precautions, nobody lol.

Seems like common theme. country opened 2 weeks ago, new rules government called ""New Normal""

The point take precautions, wear mask, distance yourself, etc etc. nobody they're living normally lol apocalypse fantasy getting use guns shoot desperate looting ""other"" instead got baking bread sewing mask apocalypse. layovers? avoid Yakima administrations works for

Just kidding man woman. Sucks. Sorry happened you. hope stereotype joke entertained. honestly, get footage ICUs. post shit facebook, youtube, twitter, whatever. remind dumbfucks much middle first wave I'm surprised Trump signed Executive order outlawing testing! get fatigue bs.

If anything things coming routine.

Can't risk going chest scans antibody tests, feel kind impact widespread think. probably not, we’re stuck much anything, problem enforcement. Even governors mandate certain guidelines, there’s little enforcement. going idea 3 months. current infection rates expect 1 person study group exposed virus every 2 days. Actually considerably testing perfect means. approximately give us 90 infected people, half vaccine half without. compare people see vaccine does.

Sith real, confirmed. addition, reddit repeatedly shat Trump numerous threads apparently cases brought EU China, ban China travel? almost simultaneous shitting closing EU travel.

no shame Nope. LOCKDOWN did.

We've lived thru many pandemic without ""brought knees"".
The main difference here? shutting things extended period time

The overreaction appalling past 2.5 years: Karma Houdini.

The last half-year: Is... sort secret cabal devoted towards poetic ironic fates? happen now, Trump's regime, fail hard, poetic way put it... boggles mind. happened fiction, I'd ask realistic all. Stomps individually see leverage talking point gain voters. Yes, drove downtown Dallas mid May took pictures couldn’t believe it. mask sight. Bars restaurants totally full. 

Even weekend surge mind, Deep Ellum sort street fair swamped. want pumpkin juice knew would fuck up, didn’t think would fuck (and continue fuck up) spectacularly did. Hell, even Doug Ford stepped plate decent job certainly wasn’t expecting that... Anyone dies fentanyl overdose probably poisoned. lot people dying fake pills. Many deaths pandemic deaths murder-by-fentanyl epidemic ongoing years. Lots people - rich famous even - died fake Xanax, fake Percocet, fake Oxy last years.

Prince. Tom Petty. Lil Peep. Mac Miller.

Be careful. 90% maskless Missouri. Cops Firefighters working close quarters without.  Crowds 100+ seen St. Louis without single mask visible (other mine, guess). 

My doctor put one came yesterday wore one office. 
Patient walked whistling maskless. 

What actual fuck wrong people. make fake cough noises trying minimize exhalations get people back fuck without running risk hurting THEM. California isn't. 'pay more' better education...

The money used 'legal bribery' lobbying goes fund specific low-income schools...would make candidates look amazing something community... hand.. money went low-income places food security, affordable housing, home computer even online access PS4 that's really one needs...ask Finland..

Changing way people learn, culture, environment extremely helps... 

Who honestly wants learn desk gum underneath wonder school shooter/kidnapper coming elite rich child poor simpleton half-broken family.

Students attending typical schools low income high income 'bullying still exists either teacher-student student-student, environmental social anxieties, transportation(safety) issue..etc..  Sometimes things physical world hinder people's emotional, social, intelligence, productive flexibility... pit 'ing school causes 'stress student' causes 'weaken immune systems' causes 'spread disease'... cameras allowed classroom 'how child physically treated'.. maybe 'online classes change teacher's behavior towards students recorded' 

Parents working home child, learn child, them... Parents pry asking 'billy learned today' 'billy wanting talk it'... act ... really parent's management... 

There amazing engaging teachers Youtube classroom viewers watching choose want virtual space want occupy learn from. Self-autonomy legit constitution 14th Amendment... institutionalization breaks that... 

If teachers great subject teach CEO CCO tell students put phone away? answer lies quality education one wants learn from. means students getting best education physical space government (State Federal Local) providing people..Rank schools best based investing endowments form prestigious clout...than actual education... personal individualistic growth improvement provide niche market new opportunity.. rules society causing problems occur again... 

When people feel 'safe' 'distrust' system... build create new one... hospitals too... know loved ones come back safe 

Someone seriously looked society pulled switch trolley problem walked away. 

How American even consider first world country..

Limited unaffordable healthcare, education, food...etc..

The racial tension even eliminated 

I never know friend went. OMG! kinda crazy takes defeat virus people considering greater good making small sacrifices. Trump’s reaction similar fuckboys reaction getting shutdown tinder.... “Fuck europe, even hot anyway. Sad.” There’s already tech mecca Europe Dublin. central already EU. 

The real reason won’t go Central Europe employee rights. Companies like US people get fired reason. Europe it’s messy often chaotic it’s worth employees basic protection. thing:

""anecdotal evidence"" real evidence/study

""it's hoax/fake news/no evidence"" weeks later even Trump saying it

""so what? X people die flu every year"" people died COVID-19 3 months entire year flu

""ok they're OLD/immunosuppressed people, cares?""

That's boils to, whether lives old/sick people matter. heartbreaking like googling. proper link Effective June 5, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis extended 14-day quarantine rule visitors New York, New Jersey Connecticut. order apply anyone participating commercial academic activities, including athletes returning college campuses.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's good way putting it. still think could done significantly better, least actually credible response based science health professionals - really, that's minimum bar. Seeing USA fail depressing, predictable given charge.   Well, Ohio lil somethin kick people  forget times China's population 1k too, actually 1.3 trillion people, cause know underreport everything Texans taking seriously? I'm Az went home weekend saw many people wearing masks, usual I'm thinking finally getting people. point wanted 100% guarantee never contract able never contact general public ever fact happening saw NYC horrific. point happens 2 weeks unavoidable. still Administration claiming it’s over. guess means we’re one shithole countries, eh Mr. President? would whole tristate area locking together, makes sense there's fair number CT NJ residents commute city. states succeeding reducing cases. understand happened covid Italy Spain... achieved herd immunity what?? seem many dead anymore they're reopening everything, anyone explain pls?? Herd immunity incredibly hard achieve kill thousands people unnecessarily thing keep mind companies international shit show international markets care either. Europe rebounding, Pacific Rim control. 

It's kind logic globally (who cares poorer countries struggling handle it, rich countries fine. Except one rich country that's gone insane.) everything turn political bullshit Yeah Amerifats eat food ""Don't go out, unless reason go out. Then, go out"". clearly starting conclusion looking facts fit it.

That statistics wrong. use data arrive conclusion parroted out.

For instance, data said black people given preferential treatment medical personnel would never accept it. already made mind even looking data.

You care truth is. vote it. remember saying couple months ago getting voted it. Oh times changed. Yes, UTSW Dallas COVID-19 patients they’ve ever announced yesterday run beds.

Today announced number patients increased 20% yesterday. Also cheaper salaries bay area. NH locked down. I'll bet 1 Schrute buck open exactly said would. Veterinarians take test get vet school medical doctors statement nonsensical. tiny proportion people applying vet school would ever take MCAT well since two schools entire country accept never get comparable sample applicants.

There far fewer spots per applicant allopathic medical schools veterinary schools btw, really good evidence old veterinarian's claim harder become vet. watching kind efforts they've done put local transmission, hard say kind thing straight face. cry you, friend. I'm paramedic Massachusetts town got hit hard pretty early. Literally, night basketball got cancelled, call volume DROPPED! super busy, suddenly NBA cancelled, NHL cancelled, call volume dropped. already transported covid patients without realizing it, started getting confirmations. ambulances running busy doesnt mean ppl taking seriously. might mean people know avoiding calling 911.  
It late June making drop call volume 2.5 month period. Tourists. going school. 14 day quarantine. sure go early. assuming they've thought lot PSAs Ohio. Governor debuted three today press conference.

I believe White House doesn’t see need PSAs. One Trump would help. get lot people year round, see NJ, NY, MD, PA, CT ... come here. I'm optimistic. Legit think going way till vaccine. long distance hard enough. Yes, people dangerous idiots, article makes good point: they're dangerous idiots *culture* (think similar issues off-topic here). enforce people wear masks, can't make like expect change whole outlook life overnight. Maybe so, still don’t want kids spreading germs 45+ parents grandparents. think they’ll try, think actively defied people pumped 4 months masks stay-at-home orders assault freedom America. you’re going end Michigan style protests Texas sized crowds guns.  Dallas, UT Southwestern health system announced run beds Clements COVID-19 unit.

Today, reported increase 20% top that. hired stylist family's hair masked backyard. Felt good. interestingly regional seems super income based now. wealthier neighborhood seriously seems get taken. Probably lot ridiculous number doctors around here...

My experience everyone wore masks went paddle boarding today little west city small beach lake visibly lower income crowd none masks. quite startling, frustrating given might keep around ages.  Germany? assumed bali/indonesia? recommended bali germany Heartbeat vacation. Unless want see Castles (Google neuschwanstein know allready, castle inspired Disney castle). Also Italy terms historic sites impressiv germany nicer weather. France north Nature course Paris Amsterdam disneyworld adults ahhn stop got mood want travel 😄 

Yeah travelling thing see also way, every place look much Cleaner better over. yet mention anything restrictions UK far I’m aware. Even though UK on-par rest Europe, it’d completely understandable placed restrictions given recent events....🙄 perennial struggle - polarized political bullshit. included US death count? What's US death rate seasonal average? virus nature, leaders morons Yes, mandatory federal order. Haha he's probably thinking that. know official number even one, sorry. Might worth Google. mother law nurse symptoms month ago. mean hit almost every symptom, even lost smell taste. due line work tested first day symptoms negative. said lot doctors work said see happen lot people test early, whatever that's worth.

I hope tests negative feel better. (assuming feel bad is) Recent report said 30%. 2M cases already US. Anyone want bet we’re still “thousands” instead hundreds thousands? Sec hands might forced states get shit together.

I wonder service academies notre dame assure even docs normally work old sick patients numerous medical issues still used many patients admit die. Especially docs ended work ICUs (most never critical care doctors before)-we 9 every 10 ICU patients die since ICU patients intubated patients. even non-ICU patients saw...a pretty large percentage became ICU patients within week so.

Normally get maybe two three older patients numerous medical problems die per year. Going endless patients might underlying asthma COPD diabetes dropping dead dozens huge shift.

What honestly got mentally deaths talk families even initially allowed come see loved ones. later changed policies enough PPE someone dying family could come say goodbye. call people's families tell loved one dying no, can't come say goodbye them. probably heartbreaking anything else.

But could see hitting pediatric doctors harder most. They're usually much happier upbeat docs got take care generally healthy kids. Official english translation:

http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2020-06/24/c_80893.htm ***Why never contacted polls surveys?!*** I’m clearly referring beginning pandemic Fauci quoted recommending masks. Hospitals rationing PPE months many ran supplies. Shut fuck snowflake. need ""kind"" anyone. need spread truth. Truth - FAT WANT DRAMATICALLY INCREASE MORTALITY RISK COVID. End story life party, restaurants,and jealouses well i’d better go get corona leave dumb world faster! virus strong hit nyc, Texas par problems. NYC reporting around 5k new cases per day mid April. 20k+ people died. Many deceased nursing homes (credit Gov Cuomo). maybe specific factor offsets ultimate number deaths Texas protecting elderly, Texas still trouble. 

As far population, Texas 3x many people nyc. Given area size Texas, logic, sure new cases evenly distributed across state. 

But pattern continues repeat Wuhan, Italy, NYC, etc... Texas states bad trip - hope not, numbers lie pattern used predict outcome accurately. 

Godspeed, Texans. know US isnt country freedom speech right?


Seems worked pretty good us Canada things starting get back normal. Jesus fucking Christ Hey. least almost plausible. true constant limited exposure viruses build immune system. theory based talking younger people developing immune system. It’s called hygiene hypothesis. wouldn’t go far acquaintance, it’s totally base. Done ordering them. good. Target.com way. taking 7 day forcast projecting til October? kind jankey math this? 

The recent 7 day average approx 600 deaths per day. 
 
we currently sit 123,723 deaths (and rising end today course) 
 
There 92 days start July start October.  
 
92x600 = 55,224 deaths. 
 
123,732 + 55,224 = 178,947 
 
This fails take account sudden catestrophic increase deaths happen starting next week week after. peak, 3 4 states danger, hitting 4x number deaths 2x number low points.
 
That best hospitals (Boston) target area could send rescue ships (NYC Southern Cali). factor going poorest regions country hit wave infection, spread across entire southern Region USA, could seeing 3,000 3,500 deaths per day peak.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oh man love Quarantine reopening fits timeline affects entirely wide demographic. People aren’t participating BLM protests getting sick, people working are. 

If there’s massive jump African Americans Whites 20-40s metropolitan areas yes could blame protests. rn that’s case. lmao Yes crazy time still is! Thankfully oncology kids really well diagnosed covid. told us main reason stuff canceled due lack PPE since wasn’t legit dying (like covid patients) took priority ventilators etc. said would actually better covid would statistically! Thanks well wishes! Thank do! love team! Same. made laugh loud videos

Huh..

New disease vector confirmed?

SHUT STREAMERS FORWARDS GRANDMA! Aussies math seems. 15 cases soon zero? I'm already cringing name. point tracing? aren’t really stopping people entering exiting areas? assume it’s everywhere. probably is. could suck wear masks beat damn thing down! completely wrong here. opposite. 

People test positive one time may multiple tests came back negative (they yet, recovered it). 

Testing people multiple times long period time returns smaller percentage positives represented amount people virus point. oppressors complicit genocide, wild choice make Go brothers wedding jackass. You’ll regret rest life.

The media hyping shit big time. Almost 50% US deaths nursing homes assisted living facilities. Unless you’re elderly immunocompromised, chances getting seriously ill dying NEAR ZERO.

If brother I’d honestly extremely pissed would hold long time. Still bad mean **essential workers** got hit virus despite **abundant safety measures**? Shut fuck up, snowflake. fat good thing especially comes covid. points solid. fat. might survived fat. stop eating. stop whining Little late, pumpkin. there’s already 125,000 dead people. then? 180k worse. hate sound like internet tough guy I'm going punch someone that.

You assaulted getting back. Don’t forget 5g caused this! bill gates wants us microchipped! never stopped quarantining. numbers area decreased even little. I’m taking chances. Thank protecting others even came party bit late.   floridians shouldn’t able reproduce. live here. It’s amazing, really is. 

One particular demographic split one best determinants whether location okay Really trouble. 

I’ve heard ready die kill beliefs, ridiculous. help much US since open borders states many states (coughTexascough) shut unless choice. pretty much count state ""red"" governor stay open citizens freely move country. mean, know attempt like NY right force quarantine travelers, that's way far perfect help significantly. Damn you, Ray Finkle Well, elections year. alone determine going vote, dont know will. joke I'm distrusting scientists. Except know better know they're making shit political reasons.

ALL Asia masking up. region already coped SARS. knew mask wearing helps reduce spread respiratory diseases. Trump Administration telling everyone masks would damage harm hospitals screaming lack PPE.

I trust scientists. trust politicians science degree.

And top off, Administration *still* done anything increase PPE production locally,as roll new increase across West South. 

We always knew masks would help worn. People lost respect trust, supposed 'scientists' started lying us. something reported mean managed well.


Things certainly could gone back normal covered deaths. seriously believe 0 people died Vietnam? stats say 349 confirmed cases 0 deaths meanwhile worldwide death rate 5.1%. reason stand confirmed cases fact 349 least dozen would died? Maybe they’d prefer duct tape. bunch fucking whiners. Time get back work, I've back work 2 months still think taken risk government wanted use bleach sunshine cure virus? wonder polling where, nobody know supports going back lockdown. Dip shit. It’s like asking people storm beaches Normandy Germans keep spamming this. looks like propaganda me. actually bet reported cases deaths day would super low like Memorial day day hit 100k honestly pretty comical see that. Also consider, ""only flu"" crowd tends towards bottom income earners. bunch money spend anyways. smarter people money going out. People prioritize health possible, people buy White House/Facebook propaganda don’t care.. eventually wi learn.

The quickest way strong consistent response, would best economy end. delays half-hearted measures easing without careful gonna cost economy twice much. Trump miscalculated... badly cousin’s surgery thyroid cancer pushed back. Fortunately able get right state reopened. He’s recovering well home.  Sweden better countries Europe strictest police enforced lockdowns Europe. 

BS. Lockdown enforced everywhere Europe point another. country ever lax approach Sweden, except UK Netherlands beginning.     
You pretend countries highest rate stricter lockdown false.      
First, lockdown came 1 2 week late Italy, Spain, France (let's talk UK Netherlands).    
Secund, countries much stricter lockdown. Austria statewide curfew, flight bans, compulsory facemasks, none measures implemented France. want compare numbers numbers Sweden?

Lmao ok I'd also love see focus recovery process. people seem think like, oh, either die fine, recovery process long agonising, small notable percentage significant lingering health issues. predicted it. 

I went premise inaction malicious misinformation would lead increase rather somehow counterintuitively reduce numbers.

I still know important add ""maybe"". Sometimes things grey: ""Getting decapitated MAYBE kill you"" dumb. allowed certain.

So gave answer.  Always implied, never forgotten. “Travel China, well developing countries, allowed, report states.”

Maybe it’s time rethink whole developed country rubric? contempt authority country decades led us point. Science authorities escape net. We've got flat earthers, anti vaxxers, moon landings fake, UFO fanatics, etc. People think know better researchers doctors saw youtube video. Closing obviously last resort. baffling they're skipping other, better resorts like mask wearing mask wearing though. Maybe something war related.... unfortunately global pandemic 😒 You’re right, mostly. federal government levers pull.

For instance: speed limits. Federal Government wanted higher speed limits US Interstates, states rights set limits. government passed law saying states wanted federal funding US interstates certain speed limit.

It wouldn’t hard envision stimulus package helps states mask mandate. Well can’t move another country. There’s rules, y’know. countries allow skilled workers fields list “shortages”.

You’re stuck here, unless get lucky. Really wish would implement mandates get everything back track. feel Texas, Florida, Arizona wasted much time. Rum always implied. talking first “Flagstaff: testing people doctor’s order” “Phoenix/Scottsdale requires Mayo Clinic orders?”

[For much Arizona, get test you’re first responder, 65/living preconditions, etc without doctor’s Trumps response world events paints us undesirables.. Noice mechanisms optimal spread worked out. understanding outbreaks occur needs specific type infectious vector/person specific type environment.

We’re also still driving work pay cut, didn’t mind loss money commute buy gas lol. cheap masks Cloth masks. N95 masks probably wont available long time ever since hospitals need way helps tear gas California large state, too, probably examined parts (LA Bay Area metropolises larger populations quite number states). Bay Area massive protests cases still low compared SoCal. 

I think agree it’s likely related protests culture surrounding distancing masks recommendations place months ensure resources properly allocated. 

The argument US country whole entire world type restrictions, correcting statement. least, state could've used money gave back around 2010 update computer infrastructure 1990's implementation, didn't.

I understand unexpectedly insane demand, also know 2020 system silently failing presence hyphen file name apostrophe last name. massively increased Unemployment staff work backlog, that's starting show bit impact new hires trained, also means lot mistakes bad information passed people gotten used working call center support position yet.

It’s matter working *faster* *harder* asked 30 people know asked poll. None asked. di know 65% Americans didnt ask everyone?/s actually let pandemic experts job, completely hands-off. Funny people run country shoveling money financial system, could send us money let us put system mean GOP cared much AIDS epidemic back day care Covid now. I’m sure mean. They’re set exceed capacity, thereby breaking curve. Texas wasn’t preparing people suffer.

- Government Considering tested 2 days ago, no, ""been changed."" 

Yes, less invasive tests available. 
However, sensitive Covid 19 replicates upper respiratory tract need get way get best sample.

The quality reliability at-home variety testing, guy posted above, unknown time. 

Here's article updated today University Texas reading subject; opposed dude internet confidently incorrect. Listen bottom line, worried it, get tested again. strong evidence tests super reliable hurt again. would nasopharyngeal swab heartbeat. bad all. Can't even get ""elected"" officials mandate masks safety protocols. thing gets act money. agreeing him, he's agreeing everyone else. millions routine deaths year pre-existing conditions. ones catching virus dying instead, add time see less deaths routine mortalities, reduced giant chunk virus deaths. part, one same. Death numbers dropping people risk started realizing pending mortality, hopefully also get drinking, smoking, junk food diets, sedentary lifestyles drugs, etc, placing high overall risk dying first place, including virus. myopic obsessing virus death numbers demanding society incarcerated homes, without addressing root causes people putting high risk dying first place. look another candidate generated excellent results human volunteers, 100% produced high levels antibodies. ""Let us take moment offer thoughts prayers fallen heroically given lives Walton Family slightly inconvenienced."" doesn’t mean virus weaker all. Ask Houston much ""heat humidity"" helping curb spread right now. expected this. People wearing masks going everywhere. hope haircuts worth it.

3 weeks lockdown absolutely nothing. Probable. honestly think November worst month entire world virus. cracks begin show doubt removed. Already made bet too. see lose chips not. live New York blue area. Maybe half people actually wear masks properly legally mandated everywhere here. bars packed county masks. numbers trend like Florida’s 6 weeks. protests came Memorial day packed bars across country. came states began reopening. concerned one group people pretty much everyone power agreed reopening? can't say one breath everything fine get back job another say irresponsible protest. 

If know better would think people power want us working exercising First Amendment rights. there's global pandemic might want err side caution. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Palestinian scientists Israel! 👌 Perfect time test less /s Honestly, someone lucky enough kept job far throughout this, I'd happy gave everyone enough get added 1% tax next 10 years whatever get back. need look other. sooner lockdown, sooner burns out, sooner get back normal life. infrastructure help can't afford work, prolonging pandemic suffering. Anytime last 5 months Sorry hear it. ok? 75% wearing masks? least that's something, live side Milwaukee like maybe 1 30 people wear mask know everyone's real interested taxing It’s pretty easy tell happened opinion. New York, densely populated area US got hit hard entire country reacted locking down. NY emerged side cases started falling, US started opening up.

Now, areas didn’t necessarily need lock earlier getting point lock necessity. Yet, economies already taken huge hit, areas reluctant go lockdown 2.0. It’s perfect recipe disaster. lot people going die.  care retail eating going library gym living life this. Maybe that's lame lol Remember Trump put Mike Pence charge response?

Where fuck he? done? might well put cat charge. uptick cases began roughly 2-3 weeks ago accelerating rapidly last week. Covid patients die usually ventilator weeks pass. Hospitalizations doubled last two weeks. Certainly crisis mode yet, good news either NO, gaslighting turning gas down. wrong  time. two really good friends NC I've worried them. I'm glad Cooper finally grew pair. happens nation real leadership.

We're basically own.  Also record high 90k tests. It’s still alarming it’s summer still continuing problem. Hes already acting like idea second stimulus  lot changed three months treatment protocol COVID-19 — use antiviral drug remdesivr, injections convalescent plasma recovered patients, even simple act placing hospital patients stomachs instead backs. study offer conclusive explanation ventilator use decreased three months, physicians pointed toward use interventions, including convalescent plasma taken recovered patients COVID-19 antibodies blood. Another main reason — physicians learned throughout past three months coronavirus patients tolerate lower blood-oxygen level previously thought. 600 day right now. Less 100 days achieve 180,000. predicting slow apparently time Texas, Arizona, Florida getting going. 

Maybe good news. I've lockdowns beginning.  I'm 25-34 range told boss today I'm going anywhere near office anytime soon. fine it. currently boat you. received two payments. haven’t received money since April 17th solely living dwindling savings account. Super frustrating call hundreds times day hear automated “we cannot take call time”. already know virus plays out, case numbers lag ~6 weeks, know that’s inconvenient I’m sorry many people declared victory 3-4 weeks ago saying reopenings didn’t cause spike, are.  Lol total nonsense know Marco self-serving asshat. 

But need every voice get tell people wear masks.

If adding voice choir actually increases audience, people actually wear masks, take it.

He self-serving asshat again, next month. what's ultimate position?

Essentially redundant, padded figures there. mean virus actually *not* exponential curve many states right now? mean things clear, move forget Covid?

I'm really following position think fundamentally important. Reduce current case counts 20% we're still exact situation. mother law works biggest hospital KC, MO number patients Covid unit doubled since last time sent update June 10th. still fairly small number people, really worries we're slowly heading wrong direction. amazon one seems bullshit like led uv-c buy mercury vapour uv-c lamp ebay roughly $30 make homemade box cardboard foil Massachusetts, state northeastern coast USA. course im talking entire timeline once, wrote two sentences. way summarize entirety outbreak two sentences.

Meanwhile giving one specific example one city generalizing entirety United States exactly similar. admit little hypocritical judge two sentences make similar generalization yourself. measures used China tested used first half 20th century.

Ignorance bliss. assholes scoffed states North East asked Federal aid make huge expenses associated virus/lockdown. 

Just wait come calling assistance hits them. legitimately incapable empathy. Something causing magic cure. Treatments improving something else happening. 

“In summary, experience, fewer people admitted, are, tend much less sick,” said could possibly seen coming? don’t know extended say this. 


When millions people across US find unemployment got cut $600 week still aren’t jobs don’t think take well. 

At all. really worst option. People seem consider allowed open mean businesses make enough money stay way. Consumer trust bottoming out, people participating economy getting sick. means pretty bad things anyone Wal-Mart, Target, HEB, etc. businesses survive even maximize 50-75% occupancy margins small depend surges weekend holiday business stay afloat. 

We asking business certain market cap temporarily furlough employees guarantee future employment providing forgivable loan contingent rehiring employees operate bare minimums get this, let state handle unemployment employees interim. would provided checks unemployment, people would jobs waiting them, forced living welfare, difference pay unemployment guaranteed job would enough people would happily go back working before, addressing many concerns people many people unemployment save lot small businesses. 

But fuck it, before-time, Mad Max is. That's handled poorly, especially federal level (though states too, looking Texas, Arizona, Florida). done concerted quarantine months (with stimulus), SLOWLY opened intelligently (essential work, small groups, etc), could managing thing well right now. places CANNOT open (malls, large stores, movie theaters, amusement parks, etc) give employees stimulus round 2 (and 3, 4, etc however long need) vaccine.

But instead, White House making fun reporters wearing masks, telling people virus going away, political rallies thousands people, etc. absolute shame waste. Forget lockdown! wear damn mask!!! really need post comment 7 times? overestimate much people want live. be, better all. people comply people cancel travel plans. extremely disappointed Gov. Abbott handled everything. top mail-in ballots blocked Abbott even making masks mandatory voting stations. 

You really see GOP's true colors Texas Abbott Dan Patrick, etc. People make decent living are, specific exceptions, working home right now. make choice. forget Kemp Georgia, leader Confederate Darwin Awards Herd Immunity Experiment. went *small* local protest protest. spaced far apart, 100% masks...and even sketched. would never go 10000+ person march right pretend okay.

So no, know nothing friend. cases keep going number dead keep increasing every day. take Desantis see reason? rising infection / death rates it. rate government handling thing might actually 1/2 left neighborhood year. next Brazil making right now. waiting pop up. 

The number people arrears rent mortgage payments economically impacted covid far exceeds total number black people United States. 

If people think millions whites, Hispanics, Asians randos going quietly allow conversation continue “center” black people move shantytowns bridges, shock coming. 

This going solved solidarity, identity. 

That even includes solidarity people still jobs, since financial system come unbelievable strain covid cases may skyrocket. affect matter are. 

We need UBI immediately even care catching covid19. That's good option people wonder small businesses. still pay overhead. UBI would great need keep businesses going bankrupt too. Indeed. recall reading couple individual places actually done think Sweden staff work multiple facilities (as elsewhere), one minor slip multiple places get infected. Thank China! Like say, people distanced could circumstances. marches, people often packed tighter (though many still tried distance much possible). 

It certainly wasn’t perfect, people trying everyone wearing masks. masks helped ton. People CHOP everything distance, well wear masks. 

The first protests almost month ago, protests first week BIG. Almost everyone King County Snohomish County, would seeing major spike already going happen. seeing major spike outside Yakima Valley. 

King County increase cases, also expected, phase things open. also confrontational assholes getting aggressive unmasked getting near people stores, I’m sure spreading disease.  current death rate COVID? 10 day old damage control account people need go grocery store pharmacy. Others may need go vet pick supplies pets.
 
And may indeed need go work.
 
The point made things, probably best stay home.
 
This difficult. Well I’m back

This hasn’t aged well lol think people looking hospitalization numbers focusing ICU usage rates. article ICU usage. no, can't protests..sigh..

It's everything Didn’t already? beginning pandemic? It'd like 9/11 times 2356. 

My god. instead blaming shitty local leaders (governors), americans think president all-powerful covid death hands. reason think slowing staircase drinking water 2 hands makes someone unfit lead... media sensationalism society definition Trump qualified talk politics... LGBT rights

As said, criticism government. ou make choice. 

I read one American publicly caned speaking government yet chose remain Singapore. (Note: several years ago.) We’re already 120,000 deaths. sure gonna reach 200,000 Election Day can’t even leave country travel many destinations this. America truly great again! Lancaster. can’t rely taxes people lock case numbers surge, example Houston restaurant reservations going way down. never understand aversion something like NHS US. seems like genuinely appreciated working UK. Especially times like experiencing now, need system care citizens without bankrupting them. I'm glad approach worked guys.  Due EMTALA, US emergency rooms act socialized countries respect treatment critically ill patients. They'll send life ruining bill months later, that's certainly different, treatment time service basically same. Yea I’m trying make sure talk I’m clear obviously experience anecdotal necessarily indicative average. 

That said, late May early June going grocery/liquor stores fair amount (sales job) got something feel things. I’m calling customers point, though. 

Glad hear experience far different. 1/5 tests coming back positive right now. Living US epicenter virus.  Quite certain = wild guess. life ever good fair, never has. fact best time alive, even problems human society.

[Disclaimer Damn, that’s quite jump! Actually, printing money we’ve done years. taxes service interest debt. incredibly arrogant put words mouth.

There number countries every way alike Sweden. brought India discussion, me. know we're supposed political here, like come Abbot's fault? words: we're fucked. thread incorrectly implied US country world ever limited testing. 

That case, much world testing people symptoms week two ago. 

This subreddit seems morphed US political subreddit facts pushed aside anti-Trump narratives. link posted shows they're nearing normal capacity, meaning convert beds surge capacity soon convert beds unsustainable capacity... Why? won’t anything. people charge won’t suddenly change stance video someone’s phone lol. That's depressing think about. Long ago watched documentary medical tourism rich patients paid $15,000 $50,000 buy kidney (for transplant) poor people poor countries. One kidney buyer actually said ""Yes, spend savings this. blame wanting live? lines long \*my country\* someone 50 never priority list I'm help myself"". Basically thing states starting surge common didn’t surge beginning initial outbreak. can't help it. hurts fragile ego knowing another country better me. Pretty good. bad people hoarding dumbbells weight plates near impossible buy reasonably-priced bicycle. percent positive steady, though, could well due testing. I'm sorry situation in.

One terrifying realizations came adult vast majority ""adults"" exist world put much faith smart reasonable people fact pedantic asshole children old bodies. America already lost battle There's nothing uncivil calling lies. sure Floridian govt ran CCP? get colds also happens coronavirus

First all, ""**a** coronavirus"" ""coronavirus**es**"" - four cause common cold, and, quote one, think immunity last something close year. Second, widespread, cause 15% 20% colds. reset cause viruses (rhinoviruses, adenoviruses others), total around 200 different viruses responsible common cold, that's catch cold many times year. vape particles THERE, visible disperse cool. I'm sorry man, that's terrible. hope get partial unemployment.


I lost business I'm unemployed yeah devastating. Exactly, embarrassment.

A lot us living north east seen felt bad get, rest country thought hoax 🙄 Well comes karma 🤷🏻‍♀️😷 

Just hardest hit areas starting get much better 😔 Hmm weird. pretty much sam Canada masks mandatory. difference eat patios Ontario rather inside restaurant. scares lot. I'm young, athletic, healthy enough odds I'd survive. thought potentially permanent lung damage would forever inhibit things love rest life shorten life span terrifies me. dont want prevented engaging activities bring joy rest life idiot thought hoax infected me. dont want one like 3 people family generations make 100's anti-vaxxer, maskless idiot. may sound selfish, care. want life get fucked someone thought fake news. Trump voters ones dying. I'm FL now. killing Trump voters, literally. fucking love 1 5 renters miss rent every April? Yeah... I’m virologist, know enough risks use PPE. I’m confident protect coronavirus. unless stop interacting people entirely, don’t think pull another year more. That's bs though. World wars literally turn entire countries war machines. absolutely going WW3 right  People see numbers start adding another phase they’ll look even worse before. seems crazy think Everyone said worst things cause super spreading large groups. would though massive left wing riots, beatings, looting, arson massive packed groups would directly cause spike increase cases? Oh joy, comes rise neofacism... stopped testing hospitals fill up. Duh!! William Henry Harrison enters chat know death curve downtrending right?

The death curve lags behind infection hospitalization curve.

The latter two rising. death curve whole event typically followed curves 2-3 weeks rise infections I'm saying notion requiring healthy people wear mask vaccine introduced ridiculous.

We wouldn’t Trump administration went federal rollout testing. would robust system separate healthy infected people tactically.

Now administration admitted purposefully scaled back testing. Trump administration reason “ridiculous” situation.

Also, hard? get things free now. Awesome, long immunity last? vaccines showing 3-4 months immunity. fuck enforce it? want people shithole, uneducated states like Texas, Alabama Florida coming spreading virus. enforcement nothing happen. dickhead Florida listen unless force to. NY, NJ CT state officials really think people places like TEXAS, ALABAMA FLORIDA listen? Ha! That's true! given within certain timeframe infection, others noted coadministered therapeutics.

So prophylactic per se, still needs given early disease course.

I guess point categorizing things medicine never perfect, always going come exceptions rule. important communicate large vaccines prophylactic. basic understanding had, nuance explored. made mod /r/pyongyang. expected happen March. states closed borders everything essential business.  I'm pretty sure countries first wave still, least country still talk countries around us first wave. 90% yesterday? 97%, looking good. Stop understanding math, killjoy. Good luck enforcing Good, maybe add 300 beds every day keep demand I’m one who’s skipping rent. want stay pay.

As said afford them, can’t afford without paying. I'm sure government continue push agenda too.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* war economy reopen regards specifically covid? 
Ah - it’s doesn’t. see there.

It’s name money - it’s name ton people dying mass chaos breaking society falls apart. really think hippie like commune break everyone share everything right away? Yeah ok Arizona lot places near ASU serve plastic cups fights. Definitely fuck Abbott, individual wear mask. I’ve worn one since March, trend setter community. low likelihood transmission via mechanism. ESPECIALLY top hand-washing/sanitizer game. Exactly. people absolutely unable understand anything outside own, direct, experience.

Then seem think *we* can't either give us benefit mea culpa ""people need listen"" .. yayaya. money go police? much money talking about? Who's leading decision, Trump's shit head course not, locate person's address, annoy shit late night. Let's see happens. maybe really want go extremes go house, plant deadly animal like Japanese hornet get rid him. Malaria mosquitoe effective since already vaccines it. think box. think you’ve misinformed, Oxford phase 3, don’t know thinking Imperial college London? It’s also trialled Brazil known least month now, don’t know efficacy humans phase 1 phase 2 passed I’d assume antibodies least created. goes well, cases Brazil skyrocketing know works July/August. I’m pretty sure Oxford best case scenario. If? Cases stay high lower numbers they’ll really fucked morbidly obese. matter young old fat putting health danger. Still enough time. Average incubation symptoms 5 days think. Thank posting this. graphs site well made comprehensible. 

I would like add: [TMC unsustainable surge capacity needed approximately 12 days. Scary thought. Pay money stay home will. everyone stay inside collect bigger paycheck normal free. ""George Soros *paying* people *not* wear masks effort wipe conservatives.""

Or something like that. might work. [Texas governor hinting another record even sailed in, time sea would probably long enough quarantine left west coast. Well, May 31st Instacart shopper brought groceries looked unwell mask get close scan driver's license parents' booze, one parents asymptomatic. That's I've narrowed to. I've got nothing. symptoms started 6 days Instacart delivery. complained Instacart time got banned shopping me.

ETA: wearing mask really. Diabetes caused sorts viruses, sorts viruses cause worse reactions diabetics. Diabetes literally bidirectional relationship viruses - would surprised COVID? Gotta get Sunday sessions Freo ever feel crazy? feel crazy. look Instagram feed people hanging people know quarantining with. drive town see restaurants PACKED tourists. I'm smh asking I'm needlessly marooning family 600 sqft apartment. know we're right thing deep down. stop jealous get everyone else who's living lives great summer. almost risk grocery store worker city like 90% people's new years resolutions goals February. God hope UK doesn't... zero faith government semblance heart spine fuck please Seriously question whether compliant Title 21, parts 210 211. FDA issues Chinese companies lately compliant sterility standards resulting products making US markets. given country?  [LA posted article today reporting worrisome increases county level. soon tell that’s trend, wonder county-level variability gets buried state averages. 

I’m Illinois, relatively good shape comparatively. Phase 4 re-opening coming soon. husband ready go dinner, movies, etc soon it’s official. want see numbers weeks following additional re-opening. video interview? would love see would probably lot good see it. either suck math missing point lol. see math without knowing many lily pads pond hold. virus almost gone. cases spiking artificially testing spiking. Fucking *and?*

These phantom spikes. Look hospitalization rates % positive. roof.

Stop trying rationalize numbers away. very, real. Thanks didn’t know could easily. actually counted people wearing masks? boozo Er, taking drastic measures prevent and/or constructing field hospitals what's potentially already locked in? What’s interesting saying done POC often seen criminals wear mask. 

Have considered fact exempting black people make wear mask target discrimination?

It’s going opposite effect. Every black person acting responsible wearing mask assumed good, rest walking around without face coverings. coronavirus essentially issue climate change sped 100x.

Disproportionately impacts poor, rich think therefore everything fine keep living normally inevitably comes too, portion country calling whole thing fake news entire way through. I’ve seen don’t care. They’re either hiding office.... can't get worse this? wait till hospitals full feds shit people dying droves. That's awaits us America. people vote murderous president November, this. Hopefully get thinned enough get competent leadership. That's really hope point. get worse sure. florida actually decent nursing homes get go. fuck like NY guy's talking nonsense. super-sophisticated cameras get people, they're simple CCTV cameras likely. I've crossed bridges many times, guess what? tons cops waiting pull state people. add-on, virus can't absorbed skin needs ACE2 receptor get cells. make sure shower shift touch eyes/nose/mouth. brother recently went dined-in restaurant said restaurant call order reduce interaction time server. working restaurant would definitely want least n95 mask rather fabric surgical mask. Also, try see boss get good air ventilation (opening doors windows) something. think Michael Osterholm interview NPR last week probably look up. always tell type hate say really God damn it, tell Karen I'm going sell mask speechless mouth gaping open they'd never know hands. It’ll go football players (American European) first, wealthy well-connected, random ass people clear reason, lastly US healthcare workers government hates them. Hard really tell trash cans banging background. need worry 2nd wave virus first one going away. 

*taps forehead*  friend near Houston fell ill got tested 16th - came back negative yesterday. 7 days. switch beds temporary ICUs, article states additional 200-something beds sustain, reaches capacity extra 500-something beds convert ""unsustainable"". there's lot way go people dying streets, good slightest. takes longer die

and median age dropping

and florida relaly careful nursing homes (unlike ""good"" states)

and low hanging fruit may picked first time

we see think USA testing 200,000 people daily now.

This number might include antibody test. source? (genuinely asking) King's island opens soon Everyone likes make news, outside nursing homes there's reason believe infected demographic changed all. Young people would never tested recently got enough tests. bought 4 annual passes year, able use it. Still cheaper medical bill getting family sick Good thing already marked traitor, people wearing masks definitely listen him... thought one Again, you’re grasping. could point outdoor gatherings naturally create lower concentrations, you’d grasp something else. 

I understand. wish right thing would magically fix itself, that’s works. long people don’t wear masks there’s vaccine, keep spreading people keep dying. Come terms don’t. That’s you. 

Ciao  #METOO give allowance mail-in ballots early voting. current situation, one voting person Election Day. 😳 Reddit shithole one.

And agree, NATO nations ain't spending fair share. talking past, example, European think lot Americans politically inept electing Trump holding Confederate flags, generally whole Americans exceptionalism rhetoric, nowadays. Plus patriotic sentiments lot Americans reminds people, especially Germans, Nazi era obviously alienates Americans American politics. US leaving NATO, obviously throwaway idea would political nightmare, alienating biggest market world losing closest allies. yeah 100% agree, tell Germans also agree, agreed increase military spending 2% 2026, 2026, agreed it.

Lastly, Europe militarily threatened country, 5x population Russia conventional war (remember France UK nukes too) EU would probably win prolonged war, EU way closer Russian heartland. would assume lot European leaders think increased spending would make sense, especially everybody dislikes interventing foreign affairs

&amp;#x200B;

edit: I'm dumb, EU 3.5x population Russia like 13x GDP Studies Minnesota Massachusetts shown significant increase, based thousands protesters, showing 1% positive rate. usage incredibly low, impossible get people use despite region COVID hotspot. unable move next stage re-opening, folks real cranky it.

Would cool realized they'd get life (roughly) back normal sooner they'd cooperate. ignoring massive protests done virtually every major city U.S. 1.5-2 week period? Well, checked enjoy linguistics history word interesting [Slacker - 

It even used ads referred people contribute war effort avoided service slackers. term would eventually equivalent draft dodger.

And yes, thought slacker term developed used around 1970's+, WWI. Probably waste effort.

Oh absolutely, good remember dumb people are, sanity continued growth human. Funding going pulled public testing next week so, ""numbers"" drop. Things stay same. Nothing change, hospitals already capacity. wish people could basic common courtesy it. I'm choosing here, fiancee risk, I'm looking another job remote options interviews fell started able land one since.

For mask-deniers there, please little respect normal people trying protect families right terrify us. Except like watching cars headed toward 1mph, crash, hundreds thousands people die. Probably lot new cases way result protests. one part virus causes pneumonia moderate severe cases, get pneumonia, takes months, maybe even year two recover. large part ""permanent damage.""

And also, realize body goes shit time, shit affects permanently different ways. body heals, adapts, get back mostly put work, diet exercise. Keep reading...

""Tuesday’s report 42 new deaths highest day didn’t include death certificate surveillance."" 200-something beds sustain

373 according article. benchmark, typical capacity 1,330 ICU beds. sustainable would 1,703 beds, 2,207 beds unsustainable ""emergency influx"". 50k runners millions spectators. 50k runners packed busses ferry get Staten Island. packed. Plus ports potties, water stations much. Also hard run 26.2 miles mask. right decision. meant do, limit number cases would require hospitalizations. 

People deluding think way would go away one surge though. always going multiple timeframes higher numbers cases time either get antivirus herd immunity. way could stay locked gone. 

If shutdown hospitals would become overrun cases required medical attention would able provide. would resulted even deaths already large number. 5000 deaths bad. Per capita puts France Italy.

But compare Scandanavian neighbours disaster. lost inititial fight matter well internal finances, external trade going suffer neightbours leery dealing them.

Sweden island. cast aside expendable power actually support times crises, take rather random reddit commentors like prefaced argument knowing people going call exactly is. Unscientific bullshit based ""feelings"". Good job governing, Greg Funny think takes order China US giving lots money. China made masks mandatory, US said mask necessary, must coincidence. estimation based laboratory confirmed cases? yet 125,000 people died 2,445,000 cases. 

(125,000 / 2,445,00) x 100 = 5.112% 

That 1.022 people dead every 20 gets it. board directors Theranos, must know he's talking about. say mask situation really improved mandatory orders. said, still see people without masks stores unless employees enforcing doors.  You’re assuming large spike cases due protests (among assumptions). evidence that? spikes don’t really line protests are. Well teach adults corporate office setting. don’t nurses site, agree. Everything else though basically have. Close quarters, always indoors, low level illness hell yes, parents sick kids clients, public toilet dining area...it really isn’t super unique large class sizes children’s general lack hygiene. 

My last class size smaller normal; that’s adjustment made, sat people apart, sanitation stations enforced 6 ft distance class, didn’t let people travel floors things normally person via virtual. 

The peanut butter thing happens think, recently ban scented soaps perfumes someone allergic.

All said don’t think it’s good idea reopen, like didn’t think good idea going person teach whole time. I’m saying problems already common solutions businesses dealing various forms... Large Indoor gatherings seems yeild cases. Maybe next time actually post symptoms show early *two days*, average *five days*!!
  
 

*^-Turns ^the ^gaslight ^to ^max ^setting-* Also study done showed thousands people within inches outside, dont spread covid 19? must missed one, please link study. Thanks! mention density - certain metrics LA area dense country people like always make biological issue political. 
Ignore partisanship parties, they’re bullshit. Look facts data medical sources non-political communities. Thanks good wishes! They’re treating bronchitis test results.

Will wearing R95 masks gym cleaning options available masks required recommended. wear one go 6am see maybe two others, maybe 70. willing bet majority people held gunpoint also survive, that's good counterpoint. Also never ""lockdown"", another bad counterpoint. US proper testing tracing, partially restrict movement states cities again, quarantine need quarantined limited timeframe. However, since US government failed testing tracing almost last 6 months, looking good point.


A lockdown defined emergency protocol implemented authorities prevents people leaving given area. full lockdown mean people given area must stay must exit enter building given area.   Telengana one worst testing rate india. people even reached 100,000 tests giving big numbers. broke knee years ago. took month surgery the. physical therapy leg another couple months get back normal. feel terrible injured treatable issues can’t right now. 

It makes angry people won’t simple things prevent disease spreading keeps hospitals filling put elective surgeries Suspiciously low case numbers today. Although Arizona's testing numbers fluctuate time time. Yeah, soft shit

I remember way back March said times things we're going..how country soft whiny crybabies like minor inconveniences sacrifices wearing mask going crowds reaped downvotes. People hate hearing truth, seems like people realizing softness got us mess. Oh right politically correct. shutting cutting funding shut down, bad. N95s protect you. vents way in, way out, still risk exposing people many unknowns right now. wish people would take caution things know protect loved ones. reputable site? Maybe CDC would honest face masks march could stopped sooner ,instead lied maskes effective lost credibility. Stop lying Fall matter. going away summer like flu. America going one big wave everyone else little waves reopen shut again. Trump one didn’t take seriously. point question locking ""do want recession economic contraction"", ""do want control recession contraction happens"" 

it even necessarily need come viruses immediate effects well - happens conditions deteriorate point west coast dockerworkers shut ports like last week, time longer? economic downturn saw first lockdown heavily influenced nothing happening ports (nothing coming opposed nothing going key difference two scenarios, effect) Thank you.  built karma could post sub try talk sense people. data us manipulated.  trump guy even anti mask, trying make dent stupidity sub. Probably waste effort. guy, masks required outside can’t social distance. walking can’t maintain 6 feet distance, need wear mask. assume isn’t issue uncle (but could others IL) lot people. 

And make clear, don’t issue wearing mask outside all. complaint took find one liked took buy bunch shopping week limit 1 per customer.  Gyms perfect storm heavy breathing, water droplets air, poor hygiene. precautions gym may taking (or boyfriend claims taking) laughable best. boyfriend made choice important him. need decide health important him. problem isn’t actual beds equipment. It’s staff. Even get equipment - can’t make nurses, aides, doctors RTs appear thin air feel differently someone love dies 100% preventable illness. Wait... thought guys said Intensive Care Sweden can't compared countries means something different, that's elderly people receive it?

Now saying comparison valid? Wtf Thanks, check out, know that. event 50k runner millions spectators. same. Also protesting right, shutting city fun run not. ‘Begin.’ 

Jesus.  Seriously could even taken China right measures. Instead left doubting. Maybe governor treated virus seriously first time took slower methodical approach Reopening....Texas leaders blame point. failed citizens vowed guide lead over. Masks working places like Japan That's really smart! meantime could look Keto diets drug called LDN help autoimmune condition. Find doc specializes long dont care epoints, fun hobby seeing people screech use pseudoscience defend nonsensical beliefs. Another false thing keeps spread. average temp 97.6. temp reaches 99 low grade fever. surprised.. moved away certain part South Bay. beach cities pretty trumpie people peninsula. observation though. We're going need massive Federal jobs relief programs. anything even resembling smidgen coming least next January 21st. True. Also seem given two three cats. better now, week digestive issues cough. course ancient tortie Zoe immortal fine. know anybody noticed people went protests smart enough wear mask. One would hope others would learn know trumpsters desire learn anything. helpful, thank much this! r/COVID19positive full hypochondriacs anxiety issues never leveraged evidence sort.

Despite fear mongering comments subreddit attempts cause, understand evaluate risks. Wear mask, social distance hang outside minimize risk. time nothing needs pass. No, countries looking us irresponsible, war-mongering country isn’t taking seriously likely keep disease around longer sheer stupidity. 

Your metaphor cute America hasn’t ‘hot’ long time. still leaning divisional bs. People left lockdown? haven't! US vastly overstating effectiveness cloth masks weeks messaging social distancing lessened relation. Far many people comfort level warranted studies source control effectiveness cloth masks. 

This danger politicizing cloth masks. People overreacting. Flores woke middle night temperature 103 degrees.    texted buddy said, ""I think I'm getting flu.' goes, 'That scary too,'"" Flores told Arizona Republic. 

""The flu"" LOL LOFUCKINL. cognitive dissonance level people acting like pandemic mind numbing. Ya 'Arizona man went packed bar America June 2020', maybe ""the flu"" tell people see outside bronx wearing masks :| insane part anything stop it, atleast NY shut down. go ny increases numbers day gonna end well Cali. 20 0.2% gtf outta here. total death rate 0.26% according CDC, 0.09% 65. I'm guessing 20 0.008% most, least heard somewhere. Check article posted guy “god” create virus kills first place. posts every bit annoying people ridiculing FYI. real casualty crisis economy. lot could done. one word: outdoors.

barbershop, food, etc, put outside. hell Spanish flu, SF courts outside. open public areas parking lots etc businesses people semblembance normality without murdering other. havent inside home wasnt mine parents since early march precisely, believe can't know cause without information. yes, stated alternative theory well. last three weeks we've seen contact tracing skyrocket, resulting lot positives people otherwise would never gotten test.

Further, Florida contain, need number continue rise largest group multi-week spreaders quarantined contact tracing, never symptomatic tests. Yup. I've extremely opposed feel need point hypocrisy. 10 days away seeing 6,200 come straight outta Tulsa.. almost if...the protests important haircuts..and adress pressing issue can't tolerated longer.. 7-8% still high percentage. TIL: Europe's economy 50% American tourists. would've thought. honestly, earned that... consequences lack prevention. also, protested end lockdown ? consider lockdown bad, ? He's gotta ask opinion President US first though. Yeah. past months forced retreat lot people love. ignorance militant. Basically sums views. Maybe took turns. Heck I'm going dream, VP other!  Perhaps time start voting someone else? Jesus would take wheel, he's ICU nurses doctors fight life. think watching Italy Spain, knowing week behind helped compliance. Seeing overwhelmed hospitals, hearing choose died, pretty scary stuff. Paris Commune 1871 fascinating event Yea honestly pleasantly surprise people still alive personally (am kinda fat extra super huge tits. Like past sexy horrifying territory) seatbelts uncomfortable. tuck arm problem solved. People can't seem problem solve missed Fox News tonight....thanks updates. DONT BLAME ALL. matter. run beds, space. make little football stadiums, growth make full shortly thereafter. 

As soon hospital capacity reached, death rate goes roof. That's even mentioning numerous patients die injuries receive inadequate care. bad.  Ok goodbye! Texas deaths New York right too.

So still line suggestion banning travel.  He's skeptic, means got atheist youtube channels ago got brainwashed anti science right wing rhetoric. expect antisjw reaction videos :) knew rioted more! think agenda money clicks. think agenda anti-Trump big conspiracy tank economy election year take away freedoms. downside pro-freedom we're clearly capable handling things like pandemics. can’t verify accuracy site lots interesting data. possible get un help something? feel like white house leaving us die, need fucking outside help. Actually would say footage video brutal lockdown measures. Forcing people homes quarantine facilities, locking homes. really understand people think unreasonable contained outbreak - extremely harsh so. 

As much everyone loves shit China Reddit can't ways. mismanage outbreak reporting severely (not reporting mean factors more), go far efforts contain virus? can't both. Pneumonia deaths Texas stick data controversial. Texas doesn’t show excess mortality year year states do. live city abide laws, you’re welcome live desert random cayman island also work one American tech companies Europe. Backoffice located Ireland HR. Finance etc. fancy parts located different capitals Europe. would say organisations bit spread out. money run Ireland lower taxes Yeah part especially driving insane. mean, fact masks considered poltiical issue many people fucking insane.  
   
And insanity compounded fact often people gung-ho opening ones literally anti mask. cool test less /s know happen vote man again?!?! Madness anybody even consider it

HE KILLING OK - Brainwashed Trump propaganda Nope, Michel president second chamber, „council“.

The guy charge foreign policy Josep Borrell, boss ist Ursula von der Leyen. head executive EU. can. get stamped often.... times stamped, whenever depart airport (Frankfurt example), usually check passport stamp it. explain comment then? 

You made simple cost benefit analysis unknown number people dying coronavirus, people therefore becoming less obese (the causation unclear me); suggest lead ""a net gain lives"". 

Seems eugenicsy me, clearly think so. Hence; rethink morals. Examine logic, faulty. Nope, Michel president second chamber, „council“.

The guy charge foreign policy Josep Borrell, boss ist Ursula von der Leyen. head executive EU. Yup, it’s pandemic people still don’t fully understand implications one. Maybe they’re talking -

M conflating defund police abolish police, even using simple title thing without understanding meaning. idea behind defund police move funds around people actual training get called things like mental health events things like disabled people episodes, police shown us bad handling those. even see communities unarmed ""community service aids"" get sent things like non-injury accidents. Abolish police tearing apart current departments union structures, replacing leadership, building law enforcement departments back ground way getting bad cops creating culture cops expected required hold eachother accountable protecting citizens rights. one, well least serious prominent, proposing permanent lack law enforcement even armed law enforcement.

I would also add since clearly specific side American politics one arguments often made private gun ownership police actually obligation violent crime occurs. think Truth Guns used bunch articles it, essentially, police can't held responsible failing protect you, even intentionally. There's lots case law specific examples this, cases police going good social worker, even case violent crime. American approve message you’re Texas: buy toilet paper now. New Mexico might wanna build wall keep state safe I've told saying I'm California helps too. Like, California viewed separate entity around world lol true. US’s ban based physical presence Schengen last 14 days, citizenship. EU citizens arriving elsewhere banned. takes 6 months train person become nurse, two weeks probably enough time either. 

Even space, need trained individuals run it. That’s funny, us realised virus large gap time numbers start exploding. Yeah, US virus came Europe. They're Ban china Jack shit. Korea/Japan China ban far better. best weight loss surgery sure 😀 Oh know, nitpicking categories. rest comment

&amp;#x200B;

Oh boy. Spain dude. 100% immediate compliance here. odd rule-breakers, many. Outside like ghost town first 4-6 weeks. kids never left home 9 weeks, wife once. 90% voluntary, mask-wearing start too. 

Makes wonder seeing scenes Italy knowing best, 2 weeks behind, focused people's minds here. I'm obliged to. know ass going fucking explode México death ratio catastrophic? America things better EU vice versa. saying EU trying take control false. see way money shipped massively highly taxed countries like countries like Italy. refuse fix broken system. secondly piss poor response covid19 countries like Poland hit try getting piece money cake. 

Another example forced imigration despite fact many countries already suffer massive overpopulation room begin with. Europe taking control 10 years ago history professor already warned would happen right it. EU fact expanding control rapidly. 

I would surprised eu collapses future. way running unsustainable. good. going catastrophic summer. Either pay human lives epic economic devastation. Either way we’re fucked.

It’s beginning feel surreal again. Racism pandemic world never trust us say time Good! isolation since feb. would like get sun soon posible. Let Americans continue thier own. law breaking? Australia banned citizens permanent residents leaving country even share land border country let alone clusterfuck like USA. Oh shit again? learn anything CovID even happening. Lockdown last resort, that's it. couple mandatory mask wearing, social distancing policies (that followed), enhanced tracing testing, sure yes delayed. would failure actually try, inevitability. didn’t answer...  come effect, curious see many people arms it, IMAGINE folks forced wear mask plane. 

This absolutely step needs taken. can't control within borders then, countries need ban American travelers time being. like lack Science .kek dunno started, it'll probably end US. could anyone predicted month ago?!?! 





\s That's real problem. governor refused allow mayors control cities, bars across state open leading this. I'm pretty sure keeping bars nightclubs closed would've prevented it, even Abbott recognized bars source numerous new infections, yet they're still open. 

I hope remembered bastard responsible thousands unnecessary Texas deaths. problem misquote misquote.

What people often quote: *Houston, problem.*

Actual quote Apollo 13: *Houston, we've problem here.* True, think leads back leadership taking virus seriously.

Guidelines: Get tested symptoms. *But want test much look like virus coming back*

Masks: Wear masks possible. *But wear mask circumstances*.

Prepare: virus could come US need prepare. *It's hoax go away*.

Danger: virus capacity overwhelm hospital kill millions elderly sick people. *It's flu*.

At pretty much every stage thing recommendations said one thing leadership telling people exact opposite. think fair blame average Americans they're getting mixed messaging. trouble recklessness could kill people. Including you. speculation legal responsibility irrelevant excuses someone comes running red light. may indeed face consequences wearing mask, regardless whether infected. Australian states closed state borders. competent dictator. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Remember big concern, countries managed keep hospitals well capacity taking swift action?

USA become peak behind curtain wrong could gone. pretty cheap hair salon. probably safe assume lot people uninsured. Maybe worried test free, indeed, access one without doctor's referral (afford to) get? Link Fred Meyer saying that? Apparently people gentle toilet lids public restrooms, hate touching them. kinds things keep contact minimum, like letting seat slam shut instead resting gently, kicking seat open closed foot. result, lids get damaged regular basis stall can't used seat repaired. many big establishments prefer go lidless. stop focusing top job many, many others actually run government. 
Is president one drafts passes laws, that’s senate house politicians. need change reflect society. Get rid old men! would determined tests likely? mean mass testing + contact tracing? 'We'', men Trump? happy see Wuhan beat virus. said matter when, if. he's ""optimistic"" we'll vaccine end year/beginning next. take I'll happy vaccine next summer, I'm pushy. mean insult you. would buckled supposed could situation Italy Spain now. certain people society believe right go water park bar important health fellow citizens. Americans used believe maxim ""Together Stand, Divided Fall'. fall. Nope, way US telephone system works way stop that. get calls *your own* number... IRS, FBI, etc.

But text would hell lot useful call doesn’t get answered first place. Yep. keep countries way want. one aspect completely cannot get behind. follow advice experts every single time. guys 8 years school to. people convinced experts intellectual types get them? psychopaths aggressively idiotic fucking people over, guy writing research journals americans dying great post. reminds predictions Mexico’s outbreak would peak April, May, don’t know keep reporting record number new cases increased test positivity. country I’m aware seen deaths come significant outbreak without enforcing strict lockdown Sweden (cases Sweden risen, testing significant extent). However, Sweden lot significant advantages India doesn’t including wealth, high equality, great education, excellent affordable healthcare, low population density. 

Herd immunity India definitely LONG way off, it’s even possible, India 450,000 confirmed cases population 1.3 billion people. Even caught 10% cases, would still leave 99.7% population uninfected far healthcare system already buckling places. Thank Europ. Finally protecting it’s citizens ! I’m Texas justification long infections spike, hospitalization rates death rates drop, it’s alright. 

Given CDC states it’s roughly 0.5% death rate virus likely won’t go away, it’s time take precautions re-open. I’m cool cases increasing long hospitalization death rates drop. true, Fauci say vaccine available “the end calendar year beginning 2021.”, still reminds people regularly vaccines take 10-15 years developed. think opinion informed one given well known timeline vaccine production, go off. Well might choice...they’re employee may need back. Less customers = less employees. gone nationwide lockdown heavy testing contact tracing back January, find isolate spreaders. we're letting spread, scrambling care unnecessary victims. Unfortunately, Dear Leader incapable understanding needed done went golfing rallying instead. Literally makes nauseous hear this. disrespectful families Tomb naysayers. others suggested commenters, contact US embassy France, well university, see goes.

I would bet university try find way get back Paris, lectures started. Might go quarantine sort depending French policies September, one predict those. Theoretically, entire Xiaohongmen area would classified ""medium"" risk area, entire neighborhood would tested.

Of course, customers come contact delivery man subject intensive testing. adjectives part free man. stubborn reckless much want, responsible consequences course.

That said, would infected first place even consider consequences wearing mask even impossible prove direct connections. begin triaging deciding care based chances survival. means usually start letting older people pre existing conditions die giving ventilators ICU beds healthier people greater chance survival. It’s weird people tried stop virus high approval rating, people manifestly didn’t try stop don’t one. can’t draw obvious conclusion that, IDK. quote Gremlins 2, ""It's looking pretty bad there. We're advising people put assets canned food shotguns!"" Looks size me: huge portion U.S. basically inhabitable dry? happy hear that, may fortune favors friend :)  Connecticut also well. northeast general crushed virus almost. never fail show defend line, you? Thats long term plan. tearing apart families kinda trademark US nowadays. That’s far variables govt response. USAs size relatively low population density provide time halt spread densely populated counties Europe. Also, making comparison pandemic anywhere close given USAs current case numbers likely increase significantly USA (unless put pneumonia). Dr. John Campbell Idk man. see people us alarming videos Italy, Spain China? 

They need get shit together tech mecca Google, Apple Facebook HQ central Europe - like Berlin, Amsterdam Paris - would huge.

Please no. cities overcrowded expensive enough is. need another influx huge money make cities even unaffordable regular people. heat argument dumb. virus ravaging countries like Egypt, touching 100F right now. comment Yeah show em! Texas America America earth lmao. sad part 50% America including government taking serious... already insane stomach pain reading situation spain/italy/UK news. america finally wakes up, worried this'll similar scale... go reading article commenting.

All could find this:
""Even case numbers climb, federal government is poised to stop providing federal aid testing sites hard-hit states, including Texas, new cases spiked sharply recent weeks."" obviously shows current situation (up June 30.) UK included, maybe helps answer questions regarding EU travel &amp; Sweden:

&amp;#x200B;

 that's point federal aid federal taxes--things like emergency relief. Maybe president activated relief understand worked? Nope, already started preproduction variety vaccines expected green lighted. !Remindme 2 weeks screwed COVID response trying save economy.

Now screws COVID response save economy.

The outcome pretty predictable. cold, old money, nepotism capital US. England - college university level courses (level 3) leaving school don’t stay school 6th form age 16. University anything level 4 (degrees upwards) classified undergraduate post graduate courses. attend uni types. colleges expanded offering odd level 4 courses still called colleges main function. look numbers U.S. great people quote GPD monetary metrics. However look things like: Quality life, Healthcare, Freedom Index, Press Freedom Index, ... U.S. shithole country now. started told us lives surfaces weeks highly infectious youdont symptoms. two things true gamechanger France Italy decreasing numbers active cases well past peak. US cannot say same. economics, higher expected jobless numbers ""begun recover"" except stock market. They're going allow Yankees fly EU another country, genius.   Netherlands call master. split bachelor master. finishing Law bachelor week going criminal law master next year. got many questions age education backpacking Asia, law school grad school thing told studying law. explain, 18 looked age. potential infection disperse across entire country

Probably within certain demographic. Funny never applies blaming reopening business policy people like blame. that?

There contact tracing, correlation literally means attempting understand cause infection. fine blaming everything else sun, one *most strongly* correlated factor all. Even though also extreme degree well-known *causal* factors, especially **massive** crowds packed together, singing yelling increase risk transmission, hours upon hours exposure time, sometimes multiple days one location increases risk geometrically. no, small handfuls people going store masks on, must reason.

People *want* accept obvious truth denial causing death. Shame you. forget upcoming GOP convention too! u ur hairdresser equipped trained like HCWs maybe. America. I’d you’re patriotic enough, constituents tolerate levels stupid we’ve never seeeeeen! point remind Roman Empire maybe British empire crumbled Preach brother, uhhh, know mean. Right European citizens residents enter EU.... Wherever come from.



We'll see next stage, doubt able avoid restrictions flying thought 3rd countries Bingo. Yeah migrants without health records, come right in! ""Har har, hoax""

It's Americans. Plenty kind idiots live. expect EU act reckless make us look “better” you? find naive. That’s way happened 1918. last time came close passing blood draw gave Pepsi. :p course, needed sugar then.  k countries reporting way seems even US states different ""official"" numbers hospitals reporting. (Especially Rebublican lead states) looking total US numbers every day spikes cases seem happen weekends whatever reason. spike big early pandemic weekend spike Tuesday. Ohh lordy. dan patrick go?? realize exponential growth means past week higher rate growth week right?

If anything means resurgence started June, aka protests started. Ohhh didn’t even catch that. Looks like outdated info posted deleted thankfully Awesome gf stuck shit hole country. Thanks Obama 
  going rewrite history pretend EU publicly denounce Trump's travel ban might want step echo chamber

Dude gonna spell right making lot echo much else. Governor Ige essentially shut tourism (airport arrivals 99.5% YoY) required 14-day quarantine actually heavily enforced. usual Texans conflate big good single super spreader event caused attenting supermarket. LOT super spreader events big events. husband talked this. live Allentown, PA surprisingly well developed healthcare infrastructure big population it’s absolute sweet spot healthcare. Obviously there’s like four people Bumfuck, Kentucky there’s also medical care. Cities opposite problem. Good healthcare many people, doesn’t matter, they’re fucked too. Mid-size cities place unfortunately. fair, challenge manufacture enough vaccines everyone earth.

so China mind someone want it. would reduce lot trouble deciding get vaccine first.

you know, cause billions people ask first get it. 100 hospitals 18 US, one 20 US, top 50... lower top 100 definition Idk man, trust world bank whatever company work BLM protests marchers wore masks, seem spiked cases like worried. wonder unmasked protestors different experience. 

I expect police give high fives tear gas. This. US culture undoing. really thought happened Italy enough warning. slow motion trainwreck ALREADY watched slow motion 3 months ago... Great see promising vaccine passing testing hurdles. 

Also great see Imperial College skipping proper steps required properly validate vaccine. Sith deals absolutes worth going jail that. Racist still racist. got criminal record. worth. everyone eat 6 hamburgers day survive like good ol' USA Yoy can't enter EU without documents. get big deal protecting pandemic, even masks 100% protection clear early masks definitely help protect yourself. protection better none, fuck others, especially closed public spaces without masks. Grocery store one, first response, trash pick up, truck drivers. idiots driving. Thank actually quite academic answer, appreciate it. chance know happened stickied thread maybe 2 months ago link aggregated research recently published COVID-19? honestly haven’t caught we’ve learned like 2+ months bodies streets, people start valuing lives Well blow feather duster ! Florida's protests tiny compared Minnesota, New York, many many states experienced uptick cases. Dear America

My beloved Americans writing today ask please wear masks go outside. 

If crazy reason discount virus serious risk everyone's health that's fine course totally decision make, however consider following groups people grave grave danger horrible death.

Grandmothers.

Grandfathers.

People Chemotherapy.

People suffering auto-immune conditions.

These humans horribly risk infection via asymptomatic spreaders subsequently passing infection humans family members / supporters probably exposed attempting obtain vital supplies.

I ask consider fear family members / supporters humans endure caught need obtain essentials risk bringing infection back them.

It fear implore wear mask reason. wearing mask give list humans fighting chance make alive mask least helps mitigate fear living time.

God bless please stay safe fucks sake wear mask enclosed public spaces.

Kindest warmest regards

Wtfsavo uncle diagnosed passing falling stairs. Americans always make themselves. exhausting. What's worst happen, see Eiffel Tower every window Paris, right? *Wink, wink.*  hail Denmark Scandinavia. famous either lol I’m glad it’s sacrifice you’re willing make. count beds exceed /s Source? probably include UK right? 

What happens infected American heads Northern Ireland drives Republic? go 15 cases 0 cases. That's lot people concerned coronavirus dead old people. I've lost hope humanity past months. Borisov prime minister. lead prosecutor guy pushing fines - Geshev generally giant weirdo he's pushing strict measures start. Hey, give 12 year old alien kid playing Plague Inc. world ideas! ignore travel warnings certain countries, no? would anyone driving car supposed lockdown?? Serve em right mention hundreds cities get bombed never mentioned comparison ""nothing"". small hometown, 600 people died, 15000 people made homeless within weeks, many historical buildings destroyed.

Today, 80 years later, one main city income groups American tourists visiting rebuilding ""historical"" buildings, sometimes even wearing American flags, long ago stood death &amp; fear.

We forgot. sue municipality. deny state funding. probably complicated that, would get tied court, lean really wants to. [Literal mass remember listening American life podcast 10y back engineer insisted proving scientific community wrong subject familiar with. can't remember details. wish could. summarizes American experience quite well. No, bet fired taking extra two weeks quarantine got back... read also also read peak November also peak different times different locations.

People idea they're talking about, even many experts. absurd people even think way.

At first people going China's numbers basing ""peak"" based China's peak happened. That's Trump's taskforce told could reopen ""Easter"".

They consider factors China achieve peak soon assumed happened naturally.

Same thing almost happened Italy invited Chinese doctors Wuhan. saw people streets flat told Italian officials half-assed lockdown. Lo behold Italy serious lockdown, Italians streets, they've got control.

The US first case around time South Korea Italy did. Actually many countries first case within two weeks other, major countries still control. EU citizenship, good go guess Weeks protests right left wing voter sides. Coupled everyone basically losing fear it. Coupled disgusting leadership refusing set workers whether economic implications forcing things open. China, central gov't maintains legitimacy control peripheral provinces making big show clearing fuck province's officials there's scandal erupts can't hide. provincials say - ah, comes central government set things right! - never really considering central gov't appoints regional gov'ts... Houston, problem. calculating R value Sweden? Also, Sweden's death rate amongst ten highest countries world per capital, infection rate amongst top 20 per capita 58th testing per capita.

As right (and subject change based long thing lasts ultimate infection rates are) Sweden's response seems failed badly. couple weeks ago thing happened Qatar Airways flight Athens. 12 passengers tested positive nine Pakistan. sub roots things get worse -- that's why. They’re making comparison. America worried health angry lot officials seemingly caring, see things like going countries ask ourselves, “why isn’t happening here, feel like would make change leaders’ behaviors.” Which, fair, exactly you’re comment: hoping solicit change readers behavior because... can’t handle two sentences written American? Aww man. beginning coumtry. population 300 milion people age 50. I'm pretty sure Belgian hosts facial expression reflects majority Europe thinks French Karen. hate term damn entitlement strong one. They’re smart. live US I’d like ban us. doesn’t yet. far tell nothing published prove except press release. Shitloads actual published research peer-reviewed tens experts gets debunked time. Where’s data? Yes mandatory, know Vancouver police random house checks make sure people following I’m sure cities. SARS2 affects 1/10th people SARS way, put 2-3x death toll permanent disability.

There's making shit part again.

Why 1/10? 2-3x?

Wild speculation layman. boggles outbreak Italy peak, could find American news media reporting Italian media, massive peak USA, can't find footage ICU ward Youtube least 2 months old (NY outbreak). like even care Tacky poorly constructed mom always told climate change main stream media lying us... ( yes collectively lying )... wonder many atheists deny current events ""fake news"". People decided it’s they’re bored it. American way! I’m pleased federal government response, however article tells nothing scaled back testing support... miss article? Hmmm? mean thing? course is.

And corona viruses mean? seasonal flu? cannot compare this. Sure crown attach cell like saying F1 car plane 4 wheels. Hungary allow UK citizens either far know Florida. noord? I’m Texas. I’m still going much, wearing mask anytime I’m public dealing another person (including drive thru windows, etc.) Washing hands constantly, course that’s habit wash hands soon get home. obviously still people visit, etc. numbers Asia suggest immunity lasts 3 4 months. Amsterdam definitely explored opportunity, think.


Friendly tolerant population, English speaking, tech presence like booking.com, Phillips. potential well. economy first people thought nothing through. recommended 2 negative swabs confirm eradication virus? agree 2 comments though, there’s virtually chance they’re still shedding virus 3 plus months later. know many globally leading tier-1 tech unis Dublin? None come mind. Nobody saying nobody there, employ top tech people elsewhere. Wages Ireland higher elsewhere many big hubs, London Zurich. point? United comes paying taxes gov seperated comes receiving money crisis. ""United"" states America nutshell.  would help actual president US wasn’t holding rallies actively trying make worse packing people together indoors. stadium wasn’t full still packed people together make look fuller cameras. 

So thankful we’ve chosen science thus far Australia hope continues. think astronomy give information useful rest population? can't randomised trial stars galaxies. Texas collapsing healthcare system underway. need complete state lockdown yesterday, 3 weeks things slowly get better. not, pray dont car accident whatever, wont hospital go to. thought nearly every country Europe close borders one first measurments March, even Schengen-countries. 

I speak Finland close borders work-related exceptions even could travel, quarantine 14-days arrival. we're opening moment Baltic countries Nordics, except Sweden different situation regarding pandemic. think could've travelled US tourist since March expect change time soon. No, mean transferred step-down medsurg floor don’t *actually* require ICU bed. Depending particular ICU run, lot in-and-out. often, one two patients don’t *need* there, either floor hospitalist wants closer eye overnight “just case”, they’re nearing end ICU stay getting “one night” either excessive caution busy day didn’t get transfer (to floor) orders/notes done... 

It’s regular occurrence ICU doc say “why patient here?” morning rounds. don’t meet “ICU criteria” they’re taking bed transfer done (which much work sounds like). reading news reports Americans lying they're going Alaska, spread unmasked viruses Banff?

Why Toronto Vancouver consistently filled American tourists asking stupid things like ""Why Mounties wear red uniform?"" Watching monitoring non-US perspective, last three years taught US full inexplicable things. must say, things would surprise nowadays. goes vacation Santorini. article immediate grammatical errors credible sources, please don’t post it. Yep. I’m southeast FL amazed (and good way!) lack leadership failure follow simple clear guidelines. Everything opened back like free mask requirement (and seems half people around brains wear one without told). It’s pretty bizarre. Airlines cruise companies suffer since EU planning banning US travelers indefinitely....... IL Midwest gas station chain work at, mandatory us wear working penalty termination don't. instructed corporate store manager tell anyone wear mask, pull mask up, comment wearing wearing mask, prevent entry without one. awhile majority customers abided it, hardly anyone dos. still get asked daily, ""Can come mask?"" ""Do wear mask?"" can't say anything. know many universities Dublin alone? Let alone entire country Ireland within 3 hour drive? don’t underestimate all. I’m 15 years industry. I’m sure think would pay HR backoffice Ireland wages quite high comparison European country. They’re skilled workforce secondary tax breaks. Put shoes. come without virus(hopefully) isolate. part solution, problem. better fear mongering thought patterns ""others"" 2020 say so. Yesterday Europe reported 684 deaths, USA reported 863. population around twice US, show USA looking bad terrible dropping weekly. 

Also can't trust EU figures. instance Spain reports deaths reported within 24 hour window, causing death toll drop 2,000 day. 

This political. working 500-bed hospital Springfield, Illinois, big name hospital anything, working st.lukes baylor TMC. hospital Springfiled way organized, well managed technologically advanced Baylor. considered standard Springfield considered upgrade baylor (if provided, all). md anderson might exception though. good enough reason, probably. wait see country based EU guideline.

&amp;#x200B;

If something done via video conference possibly not. important thing need check specific country want go to. Can't believe happening 2nd amendment take care every covid patient _""Uh, slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly right now. We're fine. We're fine here, now, thank you. you?""_ - Gov. Abbott give try establish large offices Berlin Paris, unfortunately, given local sentiment, language barrier, local media lobby etc. work out. Berlin, even protested startup incubator created Google.

Whether like not, silicon valley stay. Amsterdam possibility though. 

Do understand government plays significant role factors critical too. English speaking countries easier Chinese, Indians potential talent pools move to. sure that's sarcastic not, sure hope is. Based data presented previous post. 

The cases &amp; deaths likely underestimated &amp; underreported. think real numbers much higher, USA globally, &amp; may never reliable counts Probably many domestic workers based Hong Kong Philippines Indonesia lost jobs due pandemic. think people conflate many US hospitals leaders field niche specialities handling specific conditions/procedures better general, they're not.

Even were, ratings taking things like accessibility cost account would big factor US hospitals general. quality care *could* get bit moot point can't physically get afford receive all. literally said thing longer form. still explained coronavirus deaths effect mass information campaign. still think might net positive effect people dying coronavirus. still hold eugenicist beliefs. 

Clearly hate obesity, wonder is. ICU mean obligatory vent? thought came conclusion vents last resort. Swedish model could also described rolling cull. You’re missing point entirely. It’s politicized. think we’ve virus 6 months haven’t heard ANYTHING cure, vaccine, treatment, anything nature. It’s deaths, cases, keeping stuff closed. mention people think second wave. 

Maybe I’ve seen many movies 6 months long ass time make progress whatsoever seemingly fatal disease... unless it’s serious. Yes. Please, don’t misunderstand me. I’m PRO extreme inequality. I’m trying say super spreader observation first made weeks ago researchers Hong Kong, immediately knew said true. american, fine US travel bans. saw leader shut advisers trying protect saying something stupid proceeded say something even idiotic. keep thinking wake dream moronic tweets actions destroying great US reputation. don’t think us honestly say 2 weeks look let alone 2 months. There’s also possibility (depending numbers) school won’t open offer everything online, consider possibility well. Another year remote learning equals lower virus transmission cost savings beleaguered taxpayers Illinois. Win win!! ""citing failures virus"" makes sound condescending, especially considering EU's failures regarding crisis. said he'd bring states line reopen feel safe.

Would mind sourcing two claims? another totally obvious thing America see coming, worst one too.

And like corona, ain't done us yet. still waiting for, ""It's gonna get really bad"" come reality. Stop drinking media stuffs you. Well people supposed work home servers down. Take fucking upvote. described modern conservative policy. Many hospitals US already occupied. first half-dozen sentences article like grammatically incorrect, don’t post it. canceled limited. limitation -Only people inside Saudi Arabia currently perform Hajj including nationality

basically cancelled 99% Muslims matter people finally take seriously late response.

However best day start always current one in. like watching trainwreck slow motion.. sub react well pointing flaws beloved chosen one. 40% country follows Trump. excellent local policies, people refuse wear mask (even minutes) social distance, Trump signaled that's patriotic thing do, policies much good.

Plus, put place mildly inconvenient policies, Trump direct mob's anger you. pushes local government towards incompetence.

Trump little first spikes North-East. bigger responsibility midwest spike. incoming spike 90% his. India seems seen reduction, despite good national strategy. Indians following rules? Sounds like guys slow testing. think populations voluntarily correct behavior long get point. 

It's hard call something hoax Facebook everybody knows somebody fighting life it. True. I’m sure judge not. honest it’s first time quarantine pandemic. I’ve heard first time actually experiencing one. would recommend people like me?  though ? someone thought would go away magically heat summer. Newsflash, nope. shit now... masks muzzles them. wants speak EU's manager Intentionally misleading people increase chances getting sick ""compromise"";  playing god. way around.. indeed entitled. people though call individuals push safety measures “Karens” glorious fit projection. also means not, even remotely close being, “the best world”. live Northern California.... people wearing masks. county 400 cases 7 days reporting increases 30 days. obvious underreporting. Schools plan open Aug 12th plans enforce mask policy. One city stated plan defy state order local police sheriff stated enforce. Throwing nuance out-the-window one modern trends fucking hate. Really? think scientists behind studies considered that? previous articles I've read even age accounted risk higher. bald 40 year-old higher risk hirstute 40-year old. Houston got problem! beds filled 4 days- forced bury family- everyone healthy called mortician


Sounds like hell shitting believe 5G causes covid?! me, simple European imagining world hospitals get choose care for, getting measured success rates....

Nah, prefer ""communistic healthcare"" go doctor/hospital get treated (without receiving bill end). week started Wednesday?

That's works. No, pruning shears. It’s near impossible trace infection levels - especially 6-8 actual cases every confirmed case. means 25000 infections day 150000 contagious people walking around.

It’s amazing people knew articulated plan - lockdown cases contained masks, testing tracing. counties states could opened weeks ago, even worst case, NY, pretty good shape. Despite wide scale protests riots.

Two trillion dollars 6 week partial shutdown totally wasted. Hard see path 4000-6000 deaths week vaccine, herd, new president. honestly, hospitals become overwhelmed cannot imagine tough going new grads adapt job. New grad RN typically get 4 6 month ICU orientation safe own, imagine getting fast tracked higher patient load chaos everywhere. US best hospitals world bar none. healthcare system shit. needs try harder. Yes, details revealed check here.

  use cloth masks. black perhaps something similar available lighter color. Plus washable. surgery type masks n95 uncomfortable. 


4 packs unisex masks, comfortable earhook, black cotton mask, washable, reusable cloth mask qualifies essential worker sure I’m sure I’ll get banned seriously fucking dense? 

We make progress, brain dead “patriots” decided wearing mask infringing rights freedoms forever backsliding death economic uncertainty. 

There vaccine around corner, requires everyone’s cooperation, fucking ludicrous think pandemic getting trump bad press it’s complete mismanagement situation. nothing choice here. simply need people distance others time. Lowering reproduction number infection numbers lower, increase. 2:05 probably due bad testing early on.

Also, China's draconian lockdown procedures would probably reduce speed spread nothing time anyway. oppression strongest weapon outbreak. mayo! absolutely agree. Time sell markets, hoard cash, prepare long sad remainder 2020. Don’t expect vaccine real change virus least another year, best case scenario. Additional mass loss lives loss jobs horizon. Stay safe there. Like said, distinct lack jumps case numbers, Minnesota, also states like New York, certainly larger protests Florida. said, I'm saying protests factor. Perhaps New York's protesters wearing masks higher rates Florida? perhaps high case count participated protests led rapid growth later on? Regardless, disagree protesting right extremely risky. going use weed whacker? primarily different group people getting sick, necessarily expect death peak lag. I'd assume younger people take longer die do. Yeah, best could maybe graduate nurses doctors early slight bump Yeah person idiot. admitted ICU COVID means look like shit. 

My experience ICU work COVID ICU decompensating quickly maintaining oxygen immediate intubation basically there. 

They changed thier tune intubation early pointing worse 
outcomes people admitted ICU normal circumstances would intubated getting there. COVID patients sit 100% oxygen high flow nasal cannula BiPAP. constantly breathing 40s 50s respiration rate. try helping self prone struggle without coughing running energy. 100% high flow oxygen breathing 40 times minute patients oxygen levels high 80s low 90s. cough accidently bump mask/ cannula within seconds 60 70%. watch waiting crash. Usually sometime early morning bag sit low long intubate get going back up. 

If patients admitted ICU right sick. Guarantee doctors nurses taking patients bleeding tongue ICU right now. 

And someone said elsewhere thread driven Texas I'll say people better careful road. get car accident right may bed need it. long safe effective I'll take even Loki main (smite joke) going entitled brat. ScPo ?  statistics many people dying hospitals overwhelmed covid patients?

Shouldn't consider people covid victim well? Japan effective. Ridiculous. waited long time people still going work. bad guys think gonna get? probably quarantine 14 days upon entry. Sorry break you, parties America made political. reason many cases country. whole lot you, matter political party follow, should. made reasons okay bubble gather always America, blame others. work Daikin, A/c manufacturing company. employees Houston. actively fear health. company going shut again. cant take time I'll fired. fucked Sadly, cancer centers b/c pick ""easy"" cancers treat, make big money high success rate. think BS. We’ll reach record 40k daily cases next week. Yeah, want anyone read think easy increase hospital ICU capacity snap finger building beds. take quite time train ICU nurses, lots malpractice dead patients trial error get training done 6 months less, would desperate situation. full week ahead schedule :) leading Houston asking state permission anymore. bring consequences, leadership needs act American industry.  


And also acknowledge US country nuclear weapons 4-5 years war. use it. 

There much good US. going downhill. 25k

Even single person, $25K year poor, almost everywhere United States. Michigan bars restaurants open little two weeks far, good. I'll feel better trend stays steady another 10 days reason optimistic. New cases gone tick deaths hospitalizations remain low. certainly gone we're mass crowds anytime soon seem ok. educated population, no, perks all. one guy replied talking guys chance well. bad masks following medical suggestions weak eh? There’s harsh weather U.S, wouldn’t go far inhabitable. USA got act together could seeing people within 2 3 months (like many countries around world). 

Here Australia visit people while, can. case seeing people years. Also, see people keep safe. mutually exclusive.  social safety net actually works vital. People need receiving consistent stimulus payments support, well actual small businesses rather giant corporations. I'm complaining way media starts calling 'second wave' every time there's small outbreak. second wave Australia would 300-400 cases every day like March, 20. little bit perspective. long contact tracers job keep lid it. Harris county, main ordinance Houston, mandatory face mask businesses. asked company correlates us cane mask. called ridiculous overreacting. Literally everyone idiot refuse follow lead. I’ll wear mask protect idiots like that. Right. talking people indoors. Yeah, 10 million people die quite simply stop existing nation. can’t handle kind death. logistics seem impossible. economy healthy healthy.

Even dead 💀 ""Dumb Florida moron""

~Tommy Vercetti took decades. remember first actual seatbelt tickets given south late 80s.  wonder people ignored warnings ‘cos rights. this, fault. weak susceptible paying ignorance rights. It’s little short criminal. Trump lockdown killing us - sad. nothing park rangers need hand bleach shots. one tour White House campgrounds closed. LIBERATE JELLYSTONE!!!! /s One idea sit one end deck, (she still lives fairly large condo Somebody rethink pitching strategy instead emphasizing saving lives tell overly rich fucknuckles slaves = better wife EU citizen permanent residency? Family members citizens enter, though probably 14 day quarantine. Houston Med Center actually largest volume US also extremely high rated. There’s Cleveland Clinics Johns Hopkins, Yale, etc none nearly scale Houston. systems level care unmatched. Influential/wealthy families around world, need US based healthcare, come Houston bad, sad. Starts M, rhymes masks. started admitting adults pediatric hospitals know getting bad. 


Don't Texas National Guard field hospital deploy like New York Texas governor want raise red flags might upset dude WH ???. man murder thousands Americans one can, will, stop him.  DaVinci Resolve free even better, quicker, convenient face tracking! said takes 6 months (More like 4 years plus specialization). Used Popeyes Five Guys. sure US while. Install ram dumbass. u even tech?? honestly, get footage ICUs. post shit facebook, youtube, twitter, whatever.

tHiZ iZ sTaGeD sPrEaD fEaR CoNtRoL FrEeDoM^^tM Hey guys, slow testing please /s Gotta save evolution points. Make sure spread enough countries large enough population.

If unlock really deadly traits soon virus die kills people faster infect people. Yup. Connecticut well. Pretty much gone here. Last reported new cases per day 40. Houston resident, fuck state. local government trying stop this, you’re stupid state overrules stay home orders run fucking death cult dipshits, fucking happens fault, roped tried didn’t they? It’s going horrendous.

Watching unfold U.K. 

Our government handled poorly - guys level. 

Must scary present. History going harshly judge leaders pushed momentary financial gain lives Americans. death toll rises 100 9/11s people realize? Nah, live here. med center basically city within city. great schools funnel professionals specialties needed. mask wearing agenda therefore anti-american.

make fun, masks designs on, saw coworker use neckercheif cover mouth another mask made anne summers bra cup. mean lot people couple countries. world care. longer banned...we can't close economy.

Why people get free rent, government paychecks, endless handouts meanwhile essential workers carry country back taxes go free vacations? Brown people, poor people, else blame? dunno automod, discuss fucking GOVERNOR without sounding purely political? Someone copy sign add line say “the new symbol stupidity” Citizens enter, might 14 day quarantine though.  Switzerland here, mixing EU Europe guess. pay WAY less taxes (yet whole social net health care thingy). Could positive come this? absurdity US health system exposed finally general shift attitude?

(Not going hold breath waiting guess hope) challenge research time well spent infected contagious long time symptoms.

Then condition ""If infected"" apply, right? basic status ""Not infected"". Thats consider normal. infected, need facemask. want wear it? Prove basic status valid. want change something life.

It doesnt really work ""I want something want to, give reason why"" kind thinking volunteer medical experiments

Its really question should, question want to. Aaand not. delayed 1 2 months. could've alright government shit together nope. Vote 'em out! exactly need competent officials instead party politics. Article says there's exception eating restaurant. seems dumb idk Huh see commercial now: Covid-19 survivor getting pushed hospital wheelchair. 

Talking head: Hey champ, going now?

I'm going Disney World! It’s just...you 102 fever...even weren’t irresponsible, wouldn’t bigger problems worry hair? Cant election theres pandemic.

Dank 20IQ play American empire rapid decline Remember. numbers critical care, many horribly sick home too. hope one real emergency. masks made political. Listen health professionals. governor idiot. governors do: withhold funding city / county refuses comply. He's getting votes people anyway is. agree protest mixed quarantine fatigue, led mass violation social distancing.

But then, would protesting society just. I'd say people Springfield cannot afford take 2 weeks haircut. Businesses open people put work. Although take test come positive use order get benefits iirc. Also work can't tell come anyways sick positive. think topic IQ makes whole foods crowd racist crowd nervous.

The Whole Foods crowd think IQ changed, even 56 year olds, simply educating them.

The truth is, IQ comes combination genes early childhood environment. unchangeable adults. Even children, critical period IQ malleable fetuses, babies, toddlers. want help underprivileged people need spending money prenatal nutrition, quality daycare preschool. 

The racist crowd literally believe tell someone's IQ skin color biological sex. exaggeration. Yesterday found white supremacist blog commenter literally saying believes crap. Blah blah blah blah patrons certain businesses required wear mask, seems like good compromise

Certain businesses? good ""compromise""? cant *all* businesses require this? never claimed anything like excuse ignorance  cases going people congregating death numbers always lag behind cases numbers 2-3 weeks BRB ... moving New Zealand. Willing quarantine. :) I’m downplaying virus, it’s certainly thought January/February.

There’s always “expert” somewhere supports someone’s argument. It’s hard sub bullshit, people really need find middle ground think rationally remember college early 2000s considered crazy ban smoking bars. done everywhere, everyone appreciates smelling like ashtray going out. going get really, really, really fucking ugly one super disappointed medical professionals kept taking masks answer questions? completely unnecessary lower mask talk. 

I'd surprised everyone room multiple tests week, everyone really needs modeling proper usage masks masses. experts better certain orange politicians, people still see take masks talk. Then, viewers talking wearing mask public. outside summer Arizona. 110 + degrees people run a\c building a/c building. Cali Florida. literal specialised task force

What literal specialized task force? different regular specialized task force? took away local leadership lock down, making decision. place employment MD similar. never shutdown begin able declare essential business even though stock nothing essential reseller industrial junk China/Mexico.

Masks met wink wink, sure bud, wear makes feel safe. None employees customers wearing social distancing office. talking patient response. EU care hospitals doing, care infection rate risk citizens. infections per 1000 people higher find acceptable. 

We might flattened curve hospitalization readiness, infection rate rise again. EU hit peak came not. 

 gonna leave war start I’ll ready post /r/agedlikemilk thing is, smart fraction kids Clay County KY statistically likely leave county young adults. 

If country freedom information, freedom association, high rates car ownership, going find brain drain low status areas. It’s almost like never cohesive plan place deviation 1. knew 2. told us resultant deaths, spread disease? know now, masks among effective tool preventing disease. Even non-respirator masks cloth face coverings. 1) told us wear masks government could stockpile PPE citizens bought 

In memory lied masks working people buy could stockpile them. Seems way worse. Youll probably need say roughly million times. people arent paying attention still think people like Fauci Surgeon general right said mask wasnt effective necessary. ""Americans always right thing exhausting every possible option."" - Churchill...

We're going lose 300k-500k people unless there's vaccination soon. Probably part Well does. say tiny anti lockdown protests spreading virus vs massive BLM protests. Outdoor transmission. number don’t lie look yourself. Guess they'll changing saying ""death Texas"". far know, infected complicit responsible.

I can, won't. fucked logic anyway?

""Wear pink skirt demand so""

""I want to""

""How dare you"" First said skeptical, say care. criticize someone else's assumptions make own, including would take ""hours"" get information. someone else suggested google it, even email. 

You're right blindly trust articles, can't understand follow independent research. empower knowledge critical thought. not. Stop watching news, rotting peoples brains. Ive done better money wise every year far. lot something beats nothing. friends locked up, died covid, sent concentration camps, lifes changed way all. Except face mask part. 

I grew Asia, friends family still there. love trump think he's good president. Singapore think..... huge fad every one died hair combed cause thought cool. 

Live life man, stop watching TV. Don’t shoot messenger? Morons dual citizen American England, say - don’t listen reddit self hating cuck Really fan guy, zero controversy here. Go back watch original press release. talking specific community hit hard virus epidemiological demographic lens. tone finger pointing. would be? huge portion votes came Hispanic community. questions - staff high risk? Students high risk members living them? It’s daunting... can't tell it. March April would able tell much it. Symptoms would ease would relatively good, symptoms would get bad again. quarantining myself, could infected lot people. assume people stay away them, especially weak immune system. ""I hope post makes people think""

Spoiler: would reply actual response, automod probably delete again. So, yes hope indicative worse things come. 
#Translation: 

According Kärna, danger second wave coronavirus come Sweden Finland.

Lapland MP Mikko Kärnä (center) put written question Swedish government management corona pandemic. Among things, Kärnä asks steps Sweden take bring fight coronavirus level Nordic countries. also asked special measures Swedish government taking protect Swedish Finns.

**According Kärnä, Sweden failed fight virus. currently 56,000 infected 5,000 dead Sweden. According him, danger second wave coronavirus come Sweden Finland.**

Kärnä member Finnish delegation Nordic Council. members Nordic Council right ask written questions governments Nordic countries obligation answer them. According Kärnä, Swedish government 21 days answer written question.

#Kärnä demands joint Nordic emergency meeting

What hope achieve question?

- least hope debate next meeting Nordic Council, also hope Sweden understands take situation seriously. **We talking security entire Nordic countries**, Kärnä answers.

The next plenary session Council take place autumn. Kärnä previously called joint Nordic emergency meeting due coronavirus situation Sweden. previously asked several written questions various topics Nordic governments. agree assessment Americans, stopped short describing us properly. rebellion mentality, also inherit individualism constant need since politics 70's question government (right wrong).

The rest world continues misunderstand Americans clingy-ness rights something that, like article states, DNA. misunderstand Americans many levels, DNA, demographics, place world, stand for. Then, act like Americans little children things way rest western world them. hold beef here, true

(DNA): look first 10 amendments (bill rights) tell say you.. see changing educational changes taken hold. Using guns example, take look nations gun rights too, enshrined founding documents. Others free speech laws, perfectly alright infringing laws, ""in interest greater good."" Americans put lot crap protect rights quick defend face knee-jerk even warranted discussions rescinding rights or, least, rolling back little algorithms social media uses determine show you, creates echo chambers propaganda. Idk cities protest held reporting spikes. possible simply outside wearing masks, protesters enough. 

Most recent spikes states wearing masks wanting go bars. early super spreading events part indoor family events. 

In theory good news means outdoor events long people use masks. Debbie downer production antibodies guarantee safety virus, guarantee curing someone said virus? hope follow advice lol. aMEN Hurr durr

Do even look evolution cases?

One half week ago cases increasing 22k... 36k.

That 50% increase new cases, coming outside New England (which hit hardest slowly surely getting better).

Now NY scenario happening parts country. Remember NY first increase cases, came deaths? long ago you?

Moreover, causes excessive amounts fatalities ICU capacity reached. cases increase ""slowly"" - read, still ICU beds available, mortality remains low overall. ICUs spots... refrigerated trucks arrive. fully understand deficit spending...do you?

How much would cost pay everyone's rent/mortgage?

How much would cost loan banks money float rent/mortgages months? It’s article. WSJ saw fit lead Twitter Well doctors Scripps Research lab. yes studies needed. Universal also dozen workers Gringott's test positive 'rona recently.

Well that's sentence believed possible make sense (but does). Space force duh HIGHLIGHT double standard way police treat African Americans. Dylan roof given bullet proof vest McDonald’s. ....and guarantee 3 months ago crying “muh racism” Trump banned travel China way inconsistent? appeared consistent long know they're reporting. know ""/s"" obvious some. comment funnier without know implied replies, any, hilarious me.

I mind down-votes. hope account made redundant come November.  going pay that? *almost* flaired good news exciting see Test, Trace, Isolate infrastructure least serioulsy *talked* Sweden. However, given poor track record excitement tempered knowledge there's hell lot talk (esp. re: testing (the endless refrain ""we'll 100k tests per week soon!"" culminated abject failure comes mind)). 

Still, testing improving contact tracing infrastructure built less hard hit areas. Baby steps right direction, yes, clear turn around yet. funny people get called doomers goal post movers talk giving time see numbers play out, yet soon numbers rise people circle jerking ""doomers"" move goal posts hospital capacity, ICU capacity, deaths. 



We can't pretend shit away. Waiting people die dolecide give shit irresponsible. know what, think goal posts stop there. No, I'm pretty sure boils new excuses range everywhere false data, ""well actually bad look X numbers"", worse - ""we need let play herd immunity!"" everything America team fucking sport better ready die side unless wanna look like wishy washy weakling. Keep US we've got house order. may take while. risky move - countries like Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Italy *depend* U.S. travelers group American travels much non-EU tourism, British Chinese people. hope Lockdown part 2 # people need watch. It’s least impacted bias. Testing gives positives lower percent positive. People sides think death numbers counted. bias still # (people delay treatment) it’s best now. fact we’ll need compare total deaths vs time period previous years. EU considering banning US citizens visiting

Citizens? understood article ban would affect everyone traveling USA. all, difference passport make infected? I'm US citizen, living overseas (southwest Asia), based I've seen, subjected ban flew directly EU. miss something? right college maybe younger. lack real world experience / perspective. literally one arguing anything contrary saying yet continue double rude? That’s cool, that’s entirely you. bad can't read German. Yeah I’m glad live Boston bad outbreak early on. slow open back ton testing still despite seeing really good numbers asked. care believe not. idea Czech Republic, top-tier healthcare limited capacity resources, end ended using small fraction ICU beds hospitals never got issues (except lack materials beginning happened everywhere)

Now hindsight may look like measures overreaction people already bitching it, expected, that's know right.

We course bracing second wave believe ready it. Hospitals stocked up, emergency protocols place smart tracing running. everyone mother stock masks ready go. Never felt better European Tbh I'd rather inside building, that's taking necessary precautions, surrounded people every direction, screaming, shouting. Oh population supposed go away own...I get now! It’s one asshat moms basement making big stinky say thing that's illegal say President? wonder US covid response would non election year. I’ve less unhappy past 19 years. brings interesting question - states right deny travel states? bank bailout loan gets paid rent people get paid giving away tax money, means need cut spending giving loan cut people financially illiterate misinformed

Yes, last part true least...  stopped paying attention stats several reasons

\-the reporting hardly ever clear. mean fatality rate Americans? showed deaths % infected 5% CNN AM.

\-really concerns cohorts control influence. little good think .02% anything high risk group. Tell death stats folks. see comment regarding Spain relevant. Britain ""transition period"" legally left ceased EU citizens 31st January 2020. 

I assume also include data Switzerland, Norway Iceland stats? all, might well EU.

Hell, Canada may well US New Zealand may well Australia since travel easy normal circumstances. 🙄 pray, home, others via Zoom. go church, temple, mosque, synagogue. Especially sing people don’t live trust take precautions.

We know virus spreads public worship settings. Pandemics spread way long time- know people caught Black Death going church 14th century. economy take backseat health general public. understand eventually things gotta get going again, people take right precautions idiots first day quarantine thought US/Canadian border closed? say Smshutting everyone indoors disgusting propaganda.

Lockdowns started ended.

None shuttint anybody indoors virus goes away.

Who told that? Tegnell? Reddit. do? I’m nervous schools starting August. don’t think small private public schools strict enough keep distancing person. don’t know even want go back person 😍 Canada's response late? country shut 100 cases back March slowly started reopening. always thought protect wearer though. see opposite; masks protect others you.

Has always case covid different? Awesome. know that.
Question paid 2nd wave extended lot money gone? Yes, I'm concerned schools opening. Take care! Even muscle aches lead muscle atrophy take least couple months recover I'm honestly sure long it'd take get back #1 world shape. pure dumbassery. dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. we’ve done give conspiracy theorists ammo day 1. this. 2nd wave going break us vaccine literally hope now. Yeah fact heads rolling steps buckin palace failure British people. really wish news articles focus hospitalizations rather positive tests eliminate ""we're testing people"" narrative.

(not new narrative pushed course). Shit, coming back again, they? still remember New York City April. means delete last 14 case numbers state. Made another sheet state. Two weeks ago projections end year rates Texas would 21%. Florida 6%. California 58%. So, pretty big fluctuations, except CA. Averaging percent changes month project 6 months away accurate. Thanks perspective. lives matter. Everything's bigger Texas. GG spike.... super dense NYC. mask protect other. Every time say word, spit. Every time exhale, spit. yell, spit lot. cough sneeze, spit travels good distance lingers air. 

Most spit trapped mask. reduces amount spit travels air lands surfaces. air people breath surfaces touch.

Wear mask. It’s health, it’s others share world you. It’s common courtesy. mean, that's basically US Pearl Harbor happened. things affect average person essentially impossible get motivated take action. COVID accentuated that. That's hate narrative we're emotionally weak personal responses pandemic compared prior generations, we're reacting like would have.

Personally mental health fucking shot pandemic best position possibly could in: high paying engineering job continued pay full salary throughout looks able weather storm indefinitely. 

I feel like I've seen people saying similar positions well unimaginable turmoil less fortunate going we're going end another broken generation, especially children brought time fear.

I would never wish human death suffering wonder truly worth impose mental societal burden next 60+ years cost lives small segment population. Even choose include outlier cases younger people suffering ill effects feel we're throwing away lives livelihoods *vast* majority young people save live nursing homes. 

If we're going making comparisons Normandy (young men chosen unwillingly fight still made ultimate sacrifice bravery), willing ask save generation? hasn't. Nobody seems care lot people dying even bother wearing mask. never get Flu shot, season. “You can’t lock entire state, that’s ridiculous” - March 2020

“You can’t again,” June 2020

If hospitals overwhelmed, lockdown happen. Political posturing American exceptionalism won’t survive long state starts posting 1,000 dead per day. Exactly. poor people save money? ? US (in limited experience least) ""I'm going grad school"" really informal way saying it. actual place usually called university (I'm sure standalone colleges graduate studies, though). think laughing friend got front door residential building welded two weeks....

And agoraphobia state metaphorically physically set aflame 😂🔫

In together? HAHAHAHHAHAH you, Amazon.com ? Objectively speaking, all. found r/atheism user Congress part problem too. Trump far bigger Congress responsibility. want national testing program, that. want stockpile medical equipment second wave, that. want army people dressed coronavirus grim reaper suits go city city reminding people streets wear masks, that. Guests may interact bathrooms, stores, gas stations, park rangers, along trails... I’d put money people go camping Yosemite locals. driving areas may surging cases great idea. 

Most counties showing people don’t want follow mask guidelines crowded indoor areas grocery stores restaurants (personally, think it’s crazy indoor dining option right now)... know people who've fine. Millions people it, proportion long term effects. So, yes, recovered lived Florida might go Disney open. Cause ain't wearing mask lol people newborn sees back patio window pediatrician staff. I'm hoping big impact social development. 

... rapid testing work? Smh.. beat florida? right bad, added edit first post. Sith Lords Donald Trump draw power fear, hate, aggression. Stop admitting people ICU soon capacity hits 50%, ICUs never go 50% that. That's true - static long time well, cases actually increasing long point measures supposed place. suppose I'm glad see dropping quickly now.

When look back early days, always wonder much NB's relatively light hit came minister education. started following virus December, talking higher-ups it, wrote 20-page report giving recommendations department every one well presented premier February.

I think often whether actions led us less cases expected, despite early March break border US. so, I'm grateful also deeply sad, shows much better could gone people willing act earlier.

...mind you, I'd still like mandatory masks. Now. Safe soon possible well mutually exclusive much profit made this. friend get mad getting takeout early days, bitches festivals cancelled. dude, even eat inside halfcap restaurant till next year. I’m surprised sooooooo many people can’t go month without paycheck. parents hammered always least 6 months year minimum worth money. saved ass last year moved across country lose job 2 months. savings, able take time get really good job area network. funny touch too. follow r/survival always posting ""survival pack"", ridiculously heavy. lot long distance backpacking know much people carry. posting packs weigh three times average pack. loaded unnecessary gear. come back hours later. test WWE using comes back 8 hours. friends Trump probably get better tests. Babies young children usually arent spreaders either so... Nah, Chinese government ruthless completely predictable aware interests. Crazy better description US bystander's perspective. know happens call police days? misleading. Says ""87% improvement"" say anything else. People need Stop wanting read something else. People stop blaming others lack understanding. Read articles want knowledge greater 10 word read. No. States mess. world seems settling. different planet? people COVID-19, spread others. Fair point. I’m considering whole year write off. they’ll probably shut testing first :/ could student change plates. changed plates yet legally crossing using visa permit... thing come realize overweight people never cared health prior point life, sure heck ain’t going start caring now. perfect storm left-leaning people getting behind cause staging mass protests inside out. right-leaning people leading protests open economy. everyone often wearing masks correctly (not covering nose, touching face adjust masks, etc.

No one politically willing stop it, annoy constituents one groups above. continue path leaving people ask can’t go loved one’s funeral huge marches OK.

We’re basically following Sweden’s model now, least cojones acknowledge it. Lmao dude boasting getting upvoted downvoted. FOrget prayers get something yourself. Stay home much possible. Practice meticulous hand hygiene. Wear mask go out. Avoid crowded places. get symptoms, someone household does, isolate yourselves. 

Clearly people beyond reaching facts. responsible actions, protect can. First off, fuck anyone tells kids. That's participant activities alone.

Second, I'm glad hear making progress. hope continue using priorities mentioned. 'Certain death' overstatement yeah agree. friend mine says negotiation tactic get European Access American Airlines market there's really nothing worry about. somehow place US really big problem free somehow even regular hospital admission insufficient employ regularly staffed doctors, causing furloughs local medical system, count blessings. case, may also case soon, though hope stays way. see, *only* country managed somehow make political nobody else sees scientific public health issue. US rates sadly, actually increasing, first wave actually expanding. guys reaching higher daily new infections whole world peak first wave.

My Spain firsthand accounts scary got military enforced shutdown, things opening back region region, nobody happy it, unlike culture here, people Southern Europe often live multi-generational households, safe grandma grandpa home makes easy thing see benefits strict curfews understood.

That system brink collapse, everything described happening daily, people know field. happening people know field Canada, people know are/have ICU well. friends family also living Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, places managed flatten curve far, slowly reopening. fantastic never happened life, see it, seems absurd world. someone family friends globe, various walks life, see effects different perspective.  Obama rub.

I think lot people underestimating that. Well, bad news 2 weeks they're going completely overloaded. good news least TMC bought seems sufficient PPE staff. hopefully staff hung dry like earlier hit states. exactly great time elderly traveling though, given highest risk. Also, even China imagine happens larger cities (not everybody China smartphone either, probably 90%+ people 55 Shanghai do). limit cities greater 200,000 people, vast majority people going smartphones. 390 million 5% 7.8 billion, 0.5%. You’re factor 10. it’s 0.25%, get 19.5 million.  work paramedic. saw quite patients go hospital early discharged severe enough admitted decline fast home we'd get dispatched cardiac arrest. Unfortunately going hospital early may get discharged early. I'm trying. naysayer, relay personal experience small group people negative outcome. read Constitution none permitted.

 Oh, really ？ Congratulations US research reached China's February level .  Protesters NYC wearing masks. Many got tested Cuomo’s request: infection rate 2+ percent.

learn spell. clever! deals absolutes? ""economy first"" people? 🤔 EU unfriendly companies . Labor policies along taxes reason major corporates based North America. Saw CNN thumbnail YouTube genuinely recognize read title.

 That's trend still early say that. food delivery driver case yesterday big worry. [They're making vaccine free US can't afford valley gets extremely packed. think primitive backcountry camping still allowed, majority parks visitors stay surprisingly tight dense space days. Hey we're dying COVID here, sick burns! don’t blame actually encourage point going Italy every summer always best part year... Well, aren’t going likely see mass organized chaos like bringing hundreds patients severely injured train derailment. Hospitals also full professionals also know part job remain professional. think going panic doordash person?

I like approach better US approach. US businesses pushing blanket immunity. saw comment guy seem understand admitted ICU takes, instead thinks people People go hospital EVERYTHING. Literally bite tongue go ER. media needs stop fear monger leading people run ER second feel less 100%. people completely fine. - [source super long tongue, think giraffes gag reflex? wear masks biggest strongest men   cruise airline industry unfairly hurt this. must think Boeing carnival.

If go post history look thread comments, see many people felt tho never children prepared better budgeted better order tho pay them. Life always work way know. Crazy shit happens. know, people get choose kind life born opportunities may along way. really wish everyone best hard times. “Approximately 30 per cent survivors global SARS outbreak caused SARS-CoV Middle East respiratory  syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) experienced persistent physiological impairment abnormal radiology consistent fibrotic lung disease. envisaged pulmonary fibrosis [lung damage scarring] likely important sequela/condition consequence Covid-19,” states. 

Scary stuff Texas also one highest rates obesity US. New York got hit pretty hard 27.6% adults obesity Texas 34% people obese. people get COVID Texas people need hospitalization people die. Frances tech Mecca South country. Techies like warm weather coastal lifestyle. Oh mon dieu, stole 800 rolls French flags! Based data: 

USA 120,000 deaths 5% fatality rate calculated 2.5 MILLION confirmed cases... 

Denmark highest case fatality 16% 10,000 deaths.

Fact: 5 &lt; 16

More important fact: 120,000 dead 10,000 dead

You cannot look simply % mortality. disproportionate amount dead hit home. fucking heart. THERES LOT DEAD PEOPLE. went spring break year. Well people estimate coronavirus fatality rate 0.5%. 7.8 billion people that's 390 million. like original estimate spanish flu 0.25%, that's 195 million, believe CDC also believes moment, could one absolutely sure, global death count, enough protect ourselves, there's nothing would estimate hundreds millions.

I'm curious would see 30-40 million deaths. estimates Spanish Flu 50 million less half population now. huge population growth, something similar initial flu virus treatments cause easily deaths hundred million count. People starting care emotional, social, physical health everyday basis... environment providing one force that...unless take part unaware wanting jungle enslaved enslaving...

Currently, worst pandemic deal with... natural... exposing fragility civilization poor leadership country..maybe things shift 5-10years... know like normalizing.... response crazy emotions... knows people wearing masks, numbers skyrocketing. What? Fitted masks protect wearer others.

A good 3M FFP3/2 N95 mask provide really good protection wearer. good ones vented valve, meaning breath escape unfiltered incoming air filtered.

A surgical mask provides slight protection wearer really designed protect others.

Ideally everyone wearing FFP3 (to protect themselves) surgical mask low-tech mask top (to protect others). Hawaii fine. extremely low number cases. wearing masks (everyone everywhere should) that's complete picture.

Honestly, anywhere hit hard already probably one best places going forward take threat seriously. Everything post political... censoring something *you* like agree with. mean exclusively use CA’s government website along counties website. counties/states lack good websites, SD county CA great pages show lot useful data. don’t like using external sites worldometer all, far numbers haven’t matched official government numbers. always seem number cases CA full 18-24 hours they’re officially released, 90% time, it’s Abbott pass buck city country level people like masks, ways. Gubner Abbott, like Mask! Abbott: Blame mayor! state locked down? left decision local officials, Blame mayor! love air conditioning pandemic....cool, dry, recirculated SARS-CoV-2 everyone!

Sharing Caring would rather let people die.

While easiest since get keep diddly squat hurt economy even more.  guy ;) “I’d rather die feet live kneeling” might bad thing. months without people leaving trash trails campsites either. still know people wear seatbelts want government telling do. moronic. Stay home let Darwinism run course. Saw something days back mean, idiots too. festival France days ago tons young people packed without protection. caused uproar France, festival first place people can't even go cinema ? I'm starting lose faith country couple weeks ago European Commission urging countries add international students exceptions list banned countries started reopening I'm still hopeful. I'm supposed start school Estonia fall, already put notice job we'll see goes (either way I'm glad quit though) England end spikes cases. EU won’t want July 1st. Votes 420.and nobody fucking touch Except tests high rates asymptomatic positives county Benton county Arkansas jail... EU considering banning US citizens visiting thing reverse happens unilaterally without US consultation, thats payback

Or could necessity, Covid19 basically control (for instance, Denmark roughly 30 times max capacity - room roughly 1000 Covid19 patients, we're currently 34 hospitalized), US even begun downwards curve yet. Fuck yeah! Get us! Yeah time stop wave passed weeks ago. soon go mile two almost trail things thin quickly Anything lowers pollution like less traveling less buying stuff: GREAT!!!

It's right thing planet future generations. Honestly still really care enough wear mask care American politics, that's basically r/conservatives point seemed dismiss struggles pay attention Italy first time experiencing themselves. point they're still struggling evidence points turning corner could easy attributed fact lot infections already occured part country opposed people suddenly taking seriously now. states getting hit new cases fast rate continue course they're on, point even continue botch responses, automatically mean new case rate slows due nature herd immunity, suddenly start giving credit turnaround? 

I can't help notice state 20th highest population, 15th highest median age, surrounded states deaths per capita ranking #7, #8, #16, #20, yet we're #31 without fanfare see states getting Northeast despite terrible numbers are. anything, axe grind would people centered around media hubs seem want believe they're outperforming states simply live hear news time. 30% nurses idiots actively spreading patients.

30% Americans support Trump.  they’re workplace, they’re going want strong, offensive smell. bought hand sanitizer liquid local ethanol producer friend manages, smells like watered corn gas course does. I’m lucky enough still working home doesn’t matter. might national response abysmal there's wall around Bay area keep everyone else out. Mexicans illegal, racist.  ~~carefully~~ plan.

Fixed you. can't blame Europe making move, Trump charge states basically free policy this, we're still going nowhere fast. Let hike least. isolated miles backcountry. Keep mind rate false  Holy crap, massive #s we're seeing Arizona probably low due testing delays? I'd run hills lived AZ. Let's misleading. 71% currently occupied ICU beds non-covid patients. least means situation ventilators going less dire headline suggests. Yep working Texas medical center, pretty sure people saw “it’s flu” nurses, ofc want martyrs now. mean… /r/Coronavirus, mainly read sub laughing dumb people. self-awareness stuff gets upvoted scientific basis. favorite still week Hydroxychloroquine used everywhere, case, according sub, then, also sub, telling everyone dumb Trump promoting it. nothing happen 2020? Well tried calling hoax longest time took seriously two weeks got greedy bored starved affection decided pretend despite reality are.... Prof. Streeck ruined scientific reputation politicizing coronavirus study working shady pr-firm. criticizing succesful german response without factual basis.

Thank god Dr. Merkel Prof. Drosten. people like Streeck Laschet coronavirus response would shitshow like US. actually explains high positivity. able prioritize samples test well get likely positives tested first. 

It's quite essential everywhere prioritize people want quarantine contact trace get results back quickly. practice probably means different things different places. Next up: Yellowstone caldera pond takes 30 days fill lilypads. day 1 1 pad day 30 full. number pads doubles day. day pond half full?

The answer 29th day. Nonlinear growth concept people familiar with. can't look around say ""well things look bad today"" get grasp situation. monitor rate growth infection rate curves across nation inverted. Deaths lag several weeks. get really bad. mid July, we're going seeing several major metros overrun hospitals.  desirable? good bed without staff staff it? Build billion beds. couple million doctors nothing. They're predicting they'll exceed ICU capacity 4 days exceed sustainable surge capacity 14 days. Man, gotta keep eye this! deaths definitely rise cases increase exponentially. suspect you’d right lower rate first time Thank opinion! Back February reading virus China keeping eye tracking dashboards early March (I work data scientist dashboards jam)

I figured current administration going botch response would suffer it. worried food shortages stuff, started would become quarantine garden March 2nd. Husband said alarmist virus would never get US. “scary viruses” contained quickly, would one different? Maybe we’ll get two three cases that’ll it. 

I kept telling husband virus would come US. put together quarantine kit Sanitizing wipes couple masks early March panic buying really picked (didn’t get toilet paper could predicted that?).

My in-laws worst. husband’s dad would bike drop unannounced. kept inviting us big family dinners. started gathering lawns Saturday mornings one insisting maintaining quarantine whole family 5. Even husband didn’t wholeheartedly support measures. 

Every single one college educated. “Family important virus” ok still don’t want get sick “it could years get vaccine” ok wear damn mask get vaccine. “We’re bored” ok learn new hobby. “We miss guys” ok zoom, call, text, FaceTime, write letters, send smoke signals, even hang outside 6ft apart wearing masks. 

If could talk former self pandemic, I’d tell I’m wrong don’t let society gaslight betraying instincts. Canada one food secure countries planet.

Behind US need countries true controlling spread within house much much harder keeping house first place. threshold strongest, first defense. manage well, everyone house safe anyway bought friends LA tickets come see Denmark mid-march. Obviously cancelled. hoped could fall. hope get meet within maybe next 12 months - even though Europe already opening travel nations.  live Netherlands Dutch government already decided ban British tourists now. So...tomorrow? dick utilize thread dedicated asking resources instead hijacking multiple posts copied comments. even get denialism: ""Oh, hospitals never maxed out"", ""They never needed ventilators"", ""Everything's exaggerated"", etc. Fuck people. would expect would put quarantine, wrapped red tape. blanket ban travel, seems impractical.

Germany outbreak 1500+ cases linked notoriously badly handled factory. Reading name Tönnies linked exploitation indentured servitude(slight hyperboly, much) came surprise.

To put matters perspective: outbreak significant impact overall infection rate. us talking country 80 million. 1,500 new cases considered significant country size. serve illustration much differently outbreak handled.

tl;dr: Expect quarantine fuck Clemens Tönnies(again). open country ""help economy"", gonna lots business Europe now. Ironic. many factors, corporation tax one. Highly educated work force, English speaking, cultural similarities, within EU, etc. self perpetuating too, companies here, attracts. problem lack accomodation. travel increase risk hurting even people. varied quarantine rules, diminish risk spreading infection serious global pandemic. America #last!

Wait no, #1 people dead coronavirus. Bravo trump voters, killed - literally! Agreed. Lots pushback over. probably didn’t kill anyone else unbuckling. Unmasking take another’s life health. Fair. Arizona actually unique strain, one largest deletions raw rna. seen data dominant strain there. course know less (or more) dangerous enough people gotten sick show serology studies, we've waited three weeks people die (plus another three weeks get accurate count). 

But there's least chance much less dangerous. guess we'll find six nine weeks. You’re trippin like Asimov quote love Demon Haunted World Carl Sagan. short, beautifully written book anticipates current problems quite detail. ""Arizona's NYC . . . ""  slowing testing? thought joking. Everyone knew Ahahahhhbhahababhhhahahahbabhhh! apply people immediate family EU citizens? wanna see Dad someday. Lol. ""our infections going we're testing much"" (German) brother got married Australia February. seems like next time he'll see wife September October moves Australia. I'm probably optimistic, bet government provide free low cost. shit caused lot damage economy free vaccines would fastest way get things running.  Especially Roger's retires leaves. way Love makes impact last two qbs, right? Right? (Hopeful Bears Fan.) interesting put Spain Italy, two countries higher mortality rates per 100,000 US, B tier. Less testing, less confirmed cases. about? Sweden R 1, meanwhile Germany entered *another* lockdown outbreak couple meat production facilities. Germany keeps going constantly populace busy occupied getting haircuts protesting lockdown - like *some country*.

My roommate German, moved Sweden half year back, worked one facilities. Germany really hot think is. region allowed set restrictions strategy changing daily.

In Sweden adopted Scandinavian countries' (lockdown) exit strategy get-go. hospitals never capacity, save elderly care system totally fucked (which would've case regardless whatever strategy we'd picked) things going quite well.

I gather main reason elected go exit strategy legally government can't enforce lockdown without first changing constitution. Good luck getting old hen-house agree *how* change constitution, though. 

Last election everyone agreed government structure time good, particularly prime minister needed changing. Six months squabble later, government kind remained same, including incumbent PM. that's despite general election shaking things up. cool people kill you.  able marvel coolness anymore. Obviously paying attention definitely playing politics. He's working dems take away people's freedoms scare compliance Bill Gates inject us nano bots bring new world order. /s hole ground toilet spread COVID-19? would like know since campgrounds kinds toilets. mean people stopped like America could improve reputation mr. endthelockdown202020 said Mayo Clinic charge gets tested Phoenix Scottsdale, flat wrong. There’s one anywhere saying 33% population Arizona coronavirus, there’s one saying testing adequate Arizona. I’m correcting false part comment, I’m disagreeing anything else lol saw cheap flight Paris September. almost jumped it, thinking kid would back school, pandemic would least fairly controlled then, right?

In Europe already ""fairly controlled"". We're opening tourists various selected EU countries EOM, afterwards looking towards Asian countries also gotten solid results little road. Denmark, many countries, already opened neighboring nations control (and haven't..... looking you, Sweden, fuckup).

The way handled US frankly disconcerting global perspective. mean.... hardly first time last 2 decades Europe flabbergasted US choices actions. Where?  talked buddy Hawaii, says he's class people wearing masks either. I'm sure die hard supporters spin positive thing PLEASE THIS. Omg please. America believed long since died. needs hit bottom fix things without fuckheads getting way.

If think America still first world nation, travel country, see average person lives, go visit G7 countries. include UK I'm assuming? Governor Mills Maine thing. Shut us early people thing, crying impeachment, photoshopped face onto picture willy wonka calling ""everlasting job stopper""they refusing wear masks assholes people do, restaurants making employees wear masks, even argued employees want to.
We heavily reliant tourism understand people worried JFC going making money dead. like Bill Nye telling politics. wouldn’t shocked see Mattis trying get book deal sometime soon, Post Trump.  pathetic entire Houston medical center. !Remind \[two weeks\] guy basement dwelling troglodyte sure. exaggerated? also state ICU typically runs 70-80% capacity, Covid time 64% non Covid related patients ICU past capacity. 
And New York Italy. Italy Iran (although disturbing rumor level news hard get. confirmed lot parliament members got clear widespread). that, China nobody welds people reason. Hopefully put rest silly talk seasonal thing, second wave could come ""in fall"".

It could come time, ever get first wave.

They factor reliability predicts chances infection behavior. Wear mask, stay away others, avoid indoor interactions. need to... like... come together decide person... maybe member government something... could decide dangerous people leave houses anything non-essential.

We could call person a... leader? Nah, generic. Governor! Thats it, need elect governor. clearly Abbot. good news. Really good news. stage research, want hear. next obstacles side effects ruling possibility anti bodies enhance disease (it's happened past vaccines.)

Having said that, understanding next obstacles mean best possible news could get stage development vaccine. wait till flu starts back up. Incomprehensible way avoid another shutdown. Probably multiple... Well Boris claims lot things. Same. Wolf hero. cannot stand rubes screaming getting impeached can't get haircuts. Jesus Christ wonder country going shit. using India reference point Sweden? ambitious. comfort anyone lost job, recessions usually kill companies last legs begin with. 

In 2008 crash lost companies like Circuit City GM (which re-structured). 2001 recession killed Enron (its account tricks longer enough hide crappy business model).

I think we're gonna see lot retail companies go next 18 months. ICU? them? specific one hospital?

Couldn’t tell graphs. Y'see, folks - make reality show host president hateful knee jerk reaction seeing dark skinned man serve two terms.

It's always possible catastrophe could occur presidency - type thing skilled experienced leader would struggle hard overcome remembered history long time - terrifyingly inexperienced commander chief idea do, relying instead playbook anger division garnered attention first place risking plunging nation apocalyptic trifecta plague, race riots, civil war.

...which long way saying -


We're watching horror inside well. safe yourself, friend. I'm truly glad live somewhere least partially competent leadership. good know better somewhere. problem true democracy, uneducated people voting sides, banking unrealistic promises like return coal industry (of factors), universal basic income, quick reversal current policies. Situations like unrealistic cannot occur unless one party charge extended period time. political system doomed stuck limbo widely accepted changes occurring (80%+ support) lest reversed second new party enters. correct, since feasible way knowing real time infected, everyone act (or everyone else infected, people feel better way). 

If everyone wore N99 N95 yes, rely exclusively protecting others you, however, since several types mask take account seal provide, lot cases ideal, small part particles manages released air. ignoring data using anecdotal evidence. Nice! Downvote bud. I'm sure help ignorance well. tracked everyone come contact woman infected people church using cell phones interviews. enforced quarantines people. lower rates aren’t masks. tracing NJ since live another state can't comment sure talking about? worst told ever Aided abetted POTUS lack cohesion states. system even worse Britain's. recently built large new state-wide testing lab blood samples, etc. nice central place capacity growth. 

Then also lots scientific supplues National Labs (Los Alamos Sandia) able repurpose. 

The Governor basically grabbed every single piece equipment, reagents, supplies early on. talks sheet, making calls shipping setting sites early. came conclusion needed ""governors call"" governors call White House. got vocal call Pence called immediately afterwards try placate her. point knew going go testing, got front ordering queue basically strong-armed everyone letting state use equipment. family Houston damn, didn’t know could dumb. Facebook keep saying it’s constitutional right wear mask. Get. The. Hell. Out. Of. Here. liked GNC problem employees - Often limited supply would ALWAYS hassled store buy things need. Made feel like wanting go ever.

Obviously that's planning Corporate, care guys go business, there's better stuff elsewhere anyways. worse. way past ""best case scenario"" numbers headed worst case scenario. still people like NY... 30,000 people died it. read link says, HASNT increase cases protests. COULD be. Calling others ignorance can’t even read 🤷🏼 NYC already shit show. more. tagged good news sub cesspool doom. I'm 30s, previously athletic. virus gave meningitis *four fucking months.* trying enforce order morally invalid. YES. aggravating watching Gov Abbot reprimand citizens blame. Especially idea work look like fall Oh wow thought done shit post war. Yes bc started reopening people going indoor places like bars restaurants without masks. live see eyes. least go plant tree, since want remain oxygen thief. happened lockdown protest? gave up, that's all. important would streets still like BLM protesters. prepared conservatives blame BLM instead piss poor management crisis refusal engage emergency resources/require masks Genuine question. much US big country? US huge sprawling, one banner, acts 50 separate entities like individual countries...only kind of. Smaller countries around world able contain better seem smaller area land people focus on. 

But get US. managed royally fuck completely. know isn’t big US is. federal administration state levels done (mostly) nothing. many reasons spiraled, wondering much contributing factor big US respect, employees people don’t job. always wonder extent things like global trade mutually assured destruction save us that. 

Didn't Chinese Indian soldiers resort clubs fists last week order avoid first use live ammo? 

An all-out world war today would probably shock us fashion WWI people time. tons technologies yet used global powers going head head battlefield. 29m, reference 21m FL, 19m NY, 8m AZ surprised outdoor event canceled. thought outside still somewhat safe? 385 hospitalization! Jesus!

Canada’s got larger population Texas 318 new cases yesterday. Texas beat hospitalization! conclusion based everyone else staying home afraid riots. Read article closely. think scientific terms is, ""shitload evictions."" PA finally reopening, 2 days county least restrictive phase. dare let us drive drunk! It’s body car, letting violation FREEDOM don’t work companies, numbers listed don’t count contractors. Even asymptomatic people lungs changed/harmed.  Cancer Treatment Centers I'm researcher things. time, one does. 

It's fine, understand, know either started working find interesting I'm called moron b/c know ""Cancer Treatment Centers America"" bad ""Cancer Treatment Center Houston"" good. People's Front Judea bad Judean People's Front not. Crystal.

I call moron, pointing comment accurate. dumb knowing cancer treatment centers America concierge treatment center designed squeeze much money insurance companies possible.

That said, would recommend MD Anderson anybody cancer loved one cancer. Best cancer hospital world ask me, worked there. really care, top organization bottom. called them, I'm sure would respond with, ""Sure, come over. I'll invite bunch buddies we'll make evening it."" got invited big house party last Friday I'm invited BBQ Sat least 70-80 people maybe depending accurate rumor mill is.  get it. open, that's problem. people delusional. Texas went 3 phases reopening span month. dealing surge seeing impact phase had.

And thing nobody brings up, NONE states reopened early met guidelines so. blood hands governors. Ok non covid patients can't magically disappear? visitors seeing wonderful Covid-19 free hospitals are! we're nice, we're providing room board. Christians could deal Easter, muslims deal this. conservative relatives said shining example countermeasures took States bullshit! could possibly worked? make sound like mailman.  take away shit. exactly healthy person infect someone other? Let's hope bad side effects… always bothers meds tested poor African people west's guinea pigs  Muslim race now? Can't find anything concrete since gotten test myself, know anecdotally several asymptomatic friends mine gotten tested, Governor claiming anyone wants one eligible one. 

I accidentally started diagnostic test registration form instead serological see symptom pre-screen well one larger testing chains. know, New York managed pick quickly...  read comment? learn anything statistics? isn’t comment history it’s use percentages. It’s lethal transmission much lower. also shows signs quickly it’s easier catch isolate. (This BASIC gist) 

As stated family viruses Yeah, people saying things reddit Newsom (CA) they'll burn down, start recall, etc., tries issue shelter place orders.  might bots, people stupid right bone. 

What CA could barely called success, find outrageous restrictions imposed. Using evidence like ""I see lots people cafes"". Ugh. mental health also sucked found ways help stay home time! 

I understand type mentality... sister mean. Bless. literally Anti-Mask League formed San Fran Spanish Flu. live current non wearers also seem wear 9 lines American flag apparel. none read book since high school. California, 35% confirmed cases recorded past two weeks, Gov. Gavin Newsom said news conference Monday.

The numbers dont lie, obviously even looked at. California, 35% confirmed cases recorded past two weeks, Gov. Gavin Newsom said news conference Monday. objective data contradictory party’s agenda, data must made look false hard clampdown US first wave anti-lockdown protesters. allowed carry on. Nah, don’t need to. elderly patients treated must moved hospital open bed someone much sick, you, great wisdom model perfect leadership, propose send them? Huh? street? 

But also, really? You’re saying vulnerable demographic exposed virus died result of...the NY state governor sending home received treatment? probably read title article took truth.

Because wasn’t fault actual professionals who’s job care people, evil governor wanted kill elderly people middle pandemic! 

As someone actually lives watched Cuomo every day communicate clearly make city, stop death count tears force us recognize wasn’t number:

Shut hell sit down. banks won’t collapse. bloodsucking motherfuckers making record profits year year.

The real problem it’s people boards banks government — they’re making sure profits continue.

These public lynchings eviscerations need. Inclusive rents evicted cost landlord money. Renters pay utilities likely allowed stay since evicting gains landlord nothing. Canada, understand national provincial governments realistic threat virus recommended demonstrated appropriate action. case US. I'm Canadian kiddo. stating factual per capita testing data issue you?

It make Trunp less orange idiot asshat take deep breath. actually anti-Trump zealots playing hands helped win last time 2020. choose right....NOW....to trip across Canada? bizarre choice. compatible research done Spain, 10% infections detected initial period. Amounting estimated death rate 1,2%. 1,7% asume excess death found region covid. interested bossed around virus 0 point fucking 09 percent IFR across whole 0-69yrs population quite clear states government residents believing COVID hoax, got bad news want care heard months would happen ignored it... wtf think gonna happen? Yep - NY early testing limited, pretty much didnt test non hospitalized people - especially younger/healthy. Even hit boxes symptoms.

Compared now, anyone get test (in states ramped testing atleast). Finding lots mild cases even asymptomatic cases. 

This see surge young people testing positive. always it, couldnt tested. western countries referring to? I've got pegged 2010 Tea Party rallies tbh. know, maybe higher percentage black people follow rules, would explain infection rates. 49% LA County Hispanic Latino.

Nationwide, Hispanics/Latinos account 34% cases race/ethnicity known, make 18% US Aa understand sweden deaths coronavirus total number deaths country line April figures 2015-19.  People change. everyone, takes do. Look attitudes towards smoking example. mean two weeks Memorial Day? Oh wait, spike. 

How protests? Um... spike either.

New York locked hard people wearing masks helping lot. I'm cautiously optimistic things ok here. Save hate federal government well. Without providing financial assistance either directly unemployment systems, people would go bankrupt. mean, lots people already going bankrupt facing eviction, would even more. Midwest region USA flattened curve (although maybe 🙁 seems little lip end going up) trended down. Southern regions shouting up. Northeast got hammered start. Faulty vaccines children 2018. think time gap exposure hospitalization, know even people start smart today, trend continue weeks. Wut? becomes hotbed Covid people carry back home states. I'm sure I'm overlooking this, 2 weeks come from. graph I'm looking at, currently 30% number covid patients ultimately hold. 90% full regular capacity (of majority currently non-covid), looks like prepared almost many additional beds. 

Not saying that's great. least appear prepared. curious two weeks exceeded capacity normal. so, look like they've prepared that. Well lockdown wasn’t trying reduce cases zero. avoid overrunning hospitals. everywhere it’s zero cases. 

Any country decide wants that’s ok, think people forgot whole point locking first place. chose wear mask home around people harm others. 

Responsibility greater good matters sometimes. 

but ok. DOnt WANNa! good reason well. practically testing people show simptoms. (The few) test labs might overloaded well.

And happening Brazil. sister got sick big family gathering. husbands side big birthday party amd one parents knowing bought kid cold symptoms. ok ""it's cold"".

My sister got really sick ""the worse pain life, like labor""
And mom kid hospital intubated. along bunch people less painful symptoms.

Stupid gonna stupid. Right, bad timing terms society's response virus.

Everyone told social distance, suddenly thousands people start protesting media says, ""Yes, good idea"".

So everyone gets message ok go public gather large groups again. ""No, no, ok political protests"" work. fair, article go say opening early also contributing problem. But, yeah. one day COVID cases magically zero. Yup! matter argue mother, responses CHINA STARTED THIS.

Yes, actions first hardly defensible, certain point, actions made disaster HERE. MONTHS warning, spent mocking countries pretending great get virus.

Not us, know type person I'm referring to. Well, lot us wearing masks social distancing, so...

You’re making ideological argument limited role government. majority us already voted paid taxes stuff — competent disease control, case. government failing competently provide services already agreed kind contract public. us didn’t vote Galt’s Gultch “Atlas Shrugged.”

People drive safely can, us don’t mind government best keep wasted drivers road. us don’t see government overreach. Similarly don’t expect bridges drive collapse government paid maintain pieces infrastructure spends money elsewhere case *stops
inspecting bridges pesky engineers keep finding broken bridges stopped finding broken bridges wouldn’t many!* Americans deal anything. Half ass pretend meaningful shit gets bad deal twice thrice much work. Look climate change. imagine would happen current climate Sheriff tried roll neighborhood enforce eviction? scheduled hip replacement near end March. ended canceling one urgent enough. pain going die it. cases ""sort of"" calmed able get done middle May, lot precautions it. new case numbers include used COVID test (i.e., current active case) well results antibody tests (i.e., case could taken place months ago)? Give example democratic leader trying monetarily politically gain purposely mishandling pandemic. Lt. Gov. Texas literally said [""there important things please show example democratic leader anywhere something similar. really depends. cases spiking, theres reason go bars/restaurants/etc. Masks reduce spread, eliminate spread. theres enough cases, masks alone wont curb spread, contact tracing necessary (which US doing). theres contact tracing, option stay home order. saw coming since like February, March, right? Feds reponse outright joke anyone knows even basic aspects biology. 

Later, Trump said States, knew shit going get real pretty fast. streaming ofan obvious Federal response Feds tells WH prepared lead. can't. half expecting Trump get Covid, die stroke simple become even unhinged things get better. Covid USA's economy. currently living wonderland. wait Feds roll back weekly billions throwing keep afloat. 

You right, guys nice time. I’m convinced two strands less deadly strand become dominant. medical background, dumbass opinion. things certainly different saw Wuhan, Italy NYC. Or, could like flu really stronger presence gets cold. 2018, many elderly care businesses purchased fans cool off, Public Health Agency warns using common areas, corona center spread longer distance. However, fans still used rooms, according Anders Tegnell.  homes air conditioning place today, fans important,"" says.

Here message, stay room fan. it’s spreading uncontrolled India right now, would impossible reimplement lockdown measures catastrophic impact first one. risk hospitals overwhelmed much greater initially. 

In terms lives saved better treatment, I’m sure be, doesn’t come close damage human life caused destroying livelihoods hundreds millions poverty line. Goddamnit, upvote. Large gatherings increase risk, also mitigating factors outside, wearing face coverings, hand sanitizer, etc. People conscious risk rather outright rejecting it. almost certainly transmission, seen big spikes. yet, post inherently political. Oh, like that. wants lean racism, catch throw right back him.  aspire good member society first place. simply care, like care hundreds problems things world.

I got tired pretending virtue signalling. selfish? Yes am. keep salary turn charities. That's selfish. unless put people time, too. like Texas it’s politics California it’s unfortunate thing that’s happening despite politics competent govt,

*In Adam Mythbusters voice:* Well, there's problem! includes countries populations number tens thousands. Wait Donald come banging tarrifs shit. saw mayor Pittsburgh came said people fighting restrictions “there’s election next year invite vote point till we’re going do” first llebocat9 , operate of? St. Petersburg, Moscow. anyway welcome Comrade bot. say Hello russian?

journalists ever like, including staying bed drunk everyday. journalist editor publisher thought story important enough run immediately June 30 next week. funding cut testing, gawd knows Fauci et al talked nothing yesterday, important story needs told ASAP people federal government undercut testing community. kind mask wearing?

If wearing kind that's flat face switch cup style. find stresses breathing less I'm breathing in/out pocket air rather directly fabric.

Bonus -- also cooler. CDC recommends social distancing mask wearing possible. little scientific risk marching masks outside (and little risk worth risk cause) Seems like letting virus run wild would also destroy economy. WDIK? studied disease ecology grad school, pandemic economics. Uh OK? Gatherings pandemic stupid. lot government made fun whole thing. Yeah, feels pretty good you're-a-peein', especially beers. Fair enough. I've spent little recently things calm keep spirits up, too, I'm much risk systematic poverty. Bully me? intellectual claustrophobia 75% pharmaceuticals developed there. large country dumb smart people. smart often overshadowed ignorant.  I'm sure OP well aware. Trump hand... Protest vulnerable without crippling economy? Nah, shut whole country fuck everybody.  irony taste like iron? mean every British boomer retires Spain? yet atleast. People want blame rise cases anything fact qant go bars restaurants. 
 
However, play Russian roulette, eventually find bullet. matter time start seeing rise due protest going since end May.   Democracy problems, America best track record presidents. majority would made excellent dictators allowed to, ""elected"". brain dead look millions people standing shoulder shoulder think passing prideful mediocre reply answered question work really even attempted. Wait, saying holding indoor ego-stroking sessions mask use actively discouraged *bad example*? know? I'm shoes, cultures different physical touching may extremely important. yeah, know better telling do. trying post positive news y'all, guess dont want it. ever see sub depressed people spouting ""we're gonna die!"" sub single mind r/politics. Yea common cold virus's coronavirus? Immunity common cold last long..... It’ll lower next month! 

...when 7 federal testing sites pulled out

Low testing, low cases. Sense=null work tourist trap. Well, I'm still furloughed yet, they've reopened. 12 employees come back Covid. 4 sent home get tested. 5 sent home well one girl waited way shift say something direct relatives living Covid. day, one two people. called us back specifically -- needed backup employees. guest wearing masks. 



Oh, state, can't open wave pool rides can't maintain social distancing. day three, managers got enough complaints reopened everything. They're following 1/2 food guidelines, none entertainment ones. Employees calling OSHA daily point, health department, we'll see goes. Viruses high fatality rate tend burn much faster. virus needs keep host alive order spread new hosts. viruses tend become less fatal mutate, instead way around. Chinese vaccine manufacturers actually prosecuted China making faulty vaccines children. Parents willing pay top dollar vaccines manufactured west.  ""Laboratory setting"" ideal environment. course ideal conditions speed infection.

This tabloid level writing trying undermine dangers sake faltering economy. Ahh I'm NH resident played golf Maine last week, explains it. work Cleveland Clinic’s main campus - idea largest US! voted Trump office. deserve punishment. county Florida mandated face masks public places idiots already trying sue infringing rights really conspiracy anything, media framing it. ""US bad, Germany good"". compare latin countries Europe US, taking consideration population sizes... heard bartender days ago. 

What's wild everybody took seriously early March, Trump crowd's opinion evolved considerably since point claiming hoax always knew hoax. Greg Abbott here. Fuck kids, they’re going around irresponsible wearing masks like told coronavirus spreading everywhere /s

In seriousness, please take care stay safe there. can’t even believe I’m seeing feel bad people actually responsible/trying right thing heavy hit states right now. NYC get lots Amazon deliveries. It’s possible let sit 3-4 days live apartment. doorman didn’t directly interact delivery people would unpack boxes hallway discard immediately put away anything could wash hands. Since hallway usually wearing masks issues. Touching box make sick, problem get virus hands touching face. Wash hands touching outside packaging. Here’s question folks Texas: local news (tv papers) reporting fast things getting bad? 

Are reporting increases direly numbers say is? deal Brazil Ad5-nCoV trial thank Brazil's participation, trial successful Brazil full rights manufacturer deploy vaccine within border see fit.

I know also get export rights say South America top, surprised. Go provincial health page province online assessment form testing. 

You meet requirements, turn away trying prevent unneccessary burdens testing make sure resources going needed. They'll able see work visa dates originally entering EU COVID issue. Early New Mexico seemed lot testing per capita. early days one highest states. always wondered going on? New Mexico top things? world cheese now? scary live here, able find accurate news, ""leaders"" fucking toddlers, wait, fucking corrupt thieving parasitic bastards, literally PLANS do. They're literally sticking heads sand. seems thing would postpone things going hell millions becoming evicted, new Heroes Act, fucking republicans already saying going vote it. ""disincentive"" keep people working! Meanwhile everywhere look cases going hospitals overflowing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I vehicle. swear whatever fucking god exists theres Blue wave get every one fuckers office soon, I'll ride train canada seek asylum. think important people wear one. choice, many people wear one crowd follower take example people wear any. think important obligation.

But anyway, there's enough police control violations many people wear nose... Nevertheless, decree Germany would much worse. flight Airbus 380 think? guess 100 pax would pretty decently spaced least.

I admit first saw numbers freaked bit... Away. People stupid, governments stupider. put simply, way one could look world lay blame victims systematic violence. find reasons blame victims violence want to. 

No cultural difference necessary explain discrepancy outcomes. systematic violence endured vulnerabe explication enough. 

As 'proof' point people experienced experienxing different levels violence assume violence lesser effect culture. 

Surely acknowledge bias; agree others severe disadvantage, reducing achievements. want that, blame people worse off. could you, dedication, intelligence, perseverance. 

The reality many never could you. systematically forced homes lead paint. systematically robbed parents overpolicing. systematically forced turn crime make ends meet. 

That reality seem eager ignore. Well, see state government rules become. ""Personal responsibility"" appears bad term nowadays replaced State rule, funny seeing worried authoritarian rule right coming state governors sides speak. Find state’s OSHA website. time make report unsafe work environment keep identity confidential employer. drive, put one (or some) car.

If drive, must something always take...

If carry purse, put ziploc slip purse.

Ditto wallet.

If carry keys, get little zip case hook onto it. get mine cut year, half inch ends, possibly less 15 minutes. too. first I've heard new mutations course expected. question literally “And [culture] contribute spread virus?” lot interpretation there. 

And respond completely unrelated point, it’s entirely federal government’s blame. massive amount deaths due state decisions. example, New York decided completely decimate it’s elderly population knowingly sending infected people back nursing homes. Move NJ?  come next May long time. next May either everyone gets virus becomes non-problem  Duh. Reopening begin moronic. Every state retarded. bad asthma anxiety wearing mask fucking sucks know what? still wear one. Id choose inconvenienced possibly killing someone day. Brit here, probably ought ban us well case. Honestly nah historical records diaries shit seemed lot hardy. Please don’t leave here. NATIONAL shutdown mask wearing policy. abbott refuses take actions using available state law/health laws, leader LEAD certain someone power wants testing slowed keep numbers down. “Mandated” good

keep making US look like shit world stage.. point people worth fuck step lead shit hole back potential greatness Many planning vacations fall I'm telling October knee deep again.

If we're lucky reprieve October... We've put wearing clothing restrictions thousands years, yes. Right Houston needs go lock pronto. Well said is. Well, new Bejing outbreak help catch up! Prediction: first 'mask confrontation' death occur WA July 4th. debt domestic, owe debt themselves.

There way say they're poorest. biggest economy world also sit quite highly income per person list. However, factor costs education, health care, lack paid leave, fall bit compared rest OECD. Americans wondering unit Eu pandemic control part. Countries like Slovenia,Ireland Austria almost eliminated spread community Haaaave seen NYPD’s people protesting peacefully? police state doesn’t give damn so-called rights.

Yeah, maybe won’t check IDs border. Maybe they’ll track state license plates ALPR sensors slash tires trace you’re staying. Maybe they’ll beat piss steal anything “civil asset forfeiture.” 

People still believe free country. Wake up! happened Sedan? Indefinitely? Wonder whats going happen people LDRs... know planned move EU next year. would game changer. [Pareto impressed. less....suspected along, yeah? guess get see Polish BAE president idiot :( current New Yorker whose family/friends California, disheartening. Except keep telling Northern California... bad can’t ban economic refugees breed like rabbits commit tons crime indefinitely. you’ll replace graduate school university fall autumn ;) It’s 2020 ""Sigh"" seems pattern alot places. least New Zealand. Good, actions consequences Great! Nice job Americans got banned Europe, else going UK now? claim asylum still? Please?! Read article. number cases per 100,000 people last 14 days. US 104, second highest world. Europe gotten shit together now. Assuming get go 😅

But FR thanks mate. way determine online Covid hospitalization numbers state vs capacity? maybe graph utilization availably beds since started state? Crazy differences live, got tested today Illinois 8am, got results back day 3:30pm mean, previously cheap steroid... Providing USA better education would save economy itself...

bUt gOnNa pAy I’ve shitty day. Sorry take dad. Much love ❤️ k hilarious media keep reporting safe place. study done look places safe invest investment group. Northeast secedes! wearing masks

says who? Spain many people wear masks outside, wearing supermarkets stores obligatory Oh high today? Man torpedoing official peer reviewed Reddit post :-)

On flip side joke Texas’s death totals.  CFR low I’d love know three hiding 10-20 deaths. forget India. Daily cases increased even 2 month lockdown, can't afford another lockdown.

At 15k cases/day probably worst months gonna lie, Florida Governor kinda seems like douche Well maybe Disney pushed DeSantis take virus lightly, wouldnt situation. thats true US deal least 2022 Brazil probably deal 2023 American here. dont blame one bit. nothing short embarrassing. air travel ban foreign countries except US, can’t get in.  member US, fuckin good. Might give kick ass idiotic administration. Click baity articles COVID tests place. Ratfucks town testing whole offices hear reports ""so-so office positive cases found.""  bastards never told would test three four healthy people pass everything's fine.  Looool sorry America, hopefully get trump though especially hard US too, since 50 states 50 independent governors. hard get coordinated plan motion. Plus lot Americans seem understand delayed gratification. Every single economist know screaming twitter people charge manage virus prevent economic distaster. De Santis shut Florida real 1.5 months, provided everyone needed food box month, let hospitals/power plants, etc remain open, Florida would able reopen right now. Yes, Florida relies foreigners lot tourism, even inter-Florida tourism would've better now.

He could always impose state income tax next 5 years. 

De Santis listen economists epidemiologists.

I predicted current situation way back March every single PhD economist know. 

If believe me, look Vietnam New Zealand Austria Australia countries focues virus first. Yes, economies thriving also disaster like USA. Seriously people, STOP BUYING MASKS!!! Yikes 😞 also opt go full guantanamo Americans. Quarantine sick old. Leave rest us alone. Noooooo guys. alienated rest world could remain America. Go team. ""work"" hotel 90% clientele international, 70% americans.

Guess working anymore. There’s group Tassie trying get borders open “safe states”. don’t think realise takes one take again. Great let’s hope states follow suit don’t another economy crushing lockdown American, seems like systems need reforming upgrading... even ones supposedly good. Yeah that’s literally happening everywhere. (Sarcasm) Lmao. know you’ve lost argument resort childish double talk.

It’s official. I’ve arguing adolescent. super long hair wear time anyways nbd me. I'm letting son get haircut next week stylist also friend agreed cut hair outside masked. little girls need haircuts might ask willing soon, idk. Florida man strikes applied jobs Oslo actually good correspondence far. Hoping year. Even ""good"" candidate get chosen, turn everybody hoped wont enough time implement beneficial policies gone. Maybe try promote tb12 miracle defense? Anyone else struggling rn? life shit idk much longer take Lets wait winter. second wave shows up, yes. maybe not. country 1000 cases more, point 777 cases, likely reported somewhere. challenge Canada need US keep border closed too.

I mean, no?

Enforce quarantine way back. citizen traveled trivial reasons, force hotel 2 weeks expense. 

It's already requirement non essential workers. 

Shit, allow non citizen spouses cross, quarantine 14 days go Canada &amp; see wife.

The real problem guys NEED friendly relations USA general, probably country, current regime ... cray cray &amp; might throw tantrum point border closing. here. boyfriend lives Belgium, already see lot is. makes even worse. paid horrific price, benefit got match it. good jarred people got needed change behavior. cost!

We put 35-40 million work, cost taxpayer $2 trillion, despite that, 120,000 died. find hard believe got good value damage we've done ourselves.

I know *all* businesses remained *completely* open, mass protests, find hard believe hair salons bars evil disease-spreading villains needed die us live. Aww shucks. No? tell kids compromising act different people coming together agreeing plan makes body happy. :-) appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Master’s UvA decade ago, you’re going awesome time! mom’s nurse maintains can’t wear extended periods time can’t breathe. don’t get it. possible. guys 51st state really. Lol it'll never happen. Yes. It’s surprising disturbing. Something afoot. Here’s real big oof: enough people “have work” keep rest us fed alive there’s way thing going go away global scale length time without utter global ruin. 

The beach movies real problem. It’s anything beyond production distribution hard tack going unnecessarily spread COVID unknown number months. really mad 6 billion people decided life’s worth living circumstances? can't true. all, many sub 3-4 weeks calling others doomers envious ""face it, Florida already peaked"" ""Florida ever like New York"". Also, repeat replace Florida Texas. mean say overestimating population Florida Texas's immunity virus one immunity to? Interesting. /s vaccine already phase 3, don’t think it’s going take years. Also, it’s face mask anyway Even though cases spiking it’s everyone getting tested. Even mildest cases add numbers. deaths rising much positive cases. doomsday. many greasy, infested Texans drove Tulsa last weekend? man people. Thanks clarification ask needed money. honestly think she’d better working grocery store allowing masks plexiglass partitions. 

If goes back place like church daycare masks she’s basically playing rigged carnival game. There’s chance could still win (aka catch Covid) odds stacked get worse kids attend. time able recognize outbreak environment many kids teachers likely already infected. You’d think Disney corporation would thrown weight around bit Florida decision makers saying way could reinvigorate tourism state would comprehensive virus control. America kinda okay back could go out, claim land, work yourself. Even hardly perfect, probably best chance people opportunity make dignified life yourself... long right color, course. Good. want us coming another country either. would find way spike North Face jackets That's closed border China calling China Virus. NZ also closed borders China similar time, also closed borders hotspots including countries Europe kept updating list eventually closed borders everyone. Targeting one country probably considered racist.  Waaaaoooo original. guys lke leeches constantly complain trashy body leech lol cancel got vouchers too. applies tourists, work education supposedly excluded rule might go mandatory quarantine days finally plan doing. That's NY, NJ, CT, MI, etc far better.  They've done good job knocking down. 

Also, using Monday death count, lower recording reporting closures weekend, around 700 days ago. please post things, im scared 

/sssssss Doubtful. They’re pretty shrewd. couple parks money losers they’ll shut down, write sell them. properties around world hot spots like US. also big content production distribution business.

Shutting WDW won’t affect US. fact may help. Tourist dollars go elsewhere. People may actually see real world instead crowded, sanitized fake one. family much happier enriched visiting national parks WDW. /r/totallynotgermans Trump 100% take credit “The fuck, dude.

For maximum salt. places experiencing burst coronavirus cases never shut properly long enough first place. right, apparently know history.  Looks like someone got taste oh shit sandwich made. People downvoting think ok people get infected all. face masks social distancing. government set contract tracing I'm sure. social drinker would basically get drunk whenever night - usually couple times week. think I've buzzed possibly drunk six times since lockdown started April... occasions started family events. parents drink often days Anyone know affect expats people planning move Europe August? husband lives Hungary, I’m supposed moving join soon. Seeing devastating especially it’s prolonged still lasts time I’m supposed leave Hungary. takes average 3 years complete PhD.

When want morons feel like patriots, publish kind delusional BS. apply dual citizens living US? even ban I'm EU citizen? travel plans, curious. SHIT depends, think case would see wartime-esque mobilization manufacturing get vaccine many people possible. pricing remains seen, hopefully considered essential insurances would make free. don’t think take full year vaccine approval get people, there’s much riding vaccine. Honestly, good them. US absolute embarrassment. always tell lies statistics? Visas France site said processing visas soon. VFS site appear reflect yet. separate issue, travel bans place EU general.

SOURCES: sure situation like take look see get money work SCFs member. They've thorough communicating airlines pandemic, us costumers get money back airlines. agree. states already mandating helmet seat belt, much different mandating simple facemask  American, I’m surprised it’s right move. Since around mid March, I’ve played Witcher 3 dlcs, started finished Skyrim playthrough, maxed new borderlands 3 toon, beat far cry 3, starting far cry 4. Writing makes feel bad it.  anti-nudity laws set precedent totalitarian measures? It'll get better, lose hope! Good thing go back work Friday job touch people come home wife comorbidities insurance due BCBS putting giving entire workplace employer provided insurance. live dystopia. *""Oh god... Oh god... Are... bad guys?""* Quarantine sick old. Leave rest us alone.

lol look psychopath go low number daily infections obviously going high reproduction number (like going 1 2 doubling), mean time panic. test, trace, isolate infrastructure there, confidence we'll get back control. New York corrupt state country, pretty crappy job whole nursing home debacle among things. I’m teaching assistant program France govt announcement it’s still happening genuinely boggles mind sub responsible much needless anxiety stopped like living nice apartment meth lab.

Truth told, would probably happen leaders tip-toe like ballerina mango chief throw temper tantrum. Please, please wear masks. know they're hot, know feel restrict freedom. Please anyway. everyone immunocompromised elderly. Please. r/Masks4All. Well behaved Americans claim Canadian. Corporate radio play them. 100% bars restaurants, institutions implemented ways reducing spread. broad testing strategy works quite well. Oh turn tables Yeah, trust know shit sucks.

My sob story wife &amp; live different countries waiting green card seen 3 months now.

She's 50 min drive away. office, open now, 20 minutes house. douche Anyone functional brain need others tell US everything favor. people trusted government, government trusted science, constantly others throats disagreeing principle, could done it. Predictable still clear indication trend. next days high higher previous week, inflection point. would live northern Florida. People walk around indoors mask on. Get attitude say anything them. I'm high risk group I'm tryna catch virus. People ignorant. told god jesus protects go virus mask stuff. Best stay indoors unless must go out. never going slow way. Disney world? Florida Man real. Gotta keep 3rd world countries We’ll find week. Regardless, take national totals grain salt states handling outbreaks better others. Even national daily deaths remains stagnant, doesn’t negate fact Arizona ICU’s 90% capacity, Houston starting admit adults children’s hospitals due overflow patients. Oh turntables serious? There’s Trump rally Phoenix tonight. expect I’ll reading new shame tomorrow. read Orange County second. stupid. gosh. Depends people. personally love (as Frenchman), like torture Englishmen talking making eye contact tube. know, getting virus outside isnt really prominent, much much easier get public transport, bars, restaurants, stores, etc. Dang, college want research abroad. Guess chances slim none. Yeah unfortunately look forward weekends sit drink. It’s definitely healthy help go better place couple hours Actually cold weather potent viruses hot weather UV rays summer. Sure northern climates see less sun therefore less UV exposure winter typically spike respiratory/flu like illness attributed close contact people indoors also less active outdoor conditions. think illness viral/bacterial like flu pneumonia typically want think metabolism. better body generate energy better utilize energy fight infection. Yep must’ve read wrong, get subreddit go gather idiot conspiracy theorists :) read data properly it!!  states deal stuff Myurica? understand everything Trump's fault, look European people's teeth ask ourselves, anyone actually want go visiting see THAT? Wom terrible. follow covid project instead. Yes allow travel country arrested doctor warning people covid-19 Why? obeying law?

I cannot want something still obey law around it.

That doesn’t make part problem.

The problem people feel entitled go public wear mask even though town county state everyone else says to. problem people go store get something don’t pay feel like justified wearing mask.


The problem people make big deal nothing.

Like said. put fucking mask deal minutes day Yeah I’m Canadian (Ontario) don’t think provinces response fantastic. Better states things should’ve shut hard early instead partly opening letting people get away huge gatherings. It’s good enough definitely lot left desired. 

All friends seem think posters we’ve handled excellently don’t think response great anyone following rainy season China, particularly impact three gorges dam?

I've seen speculation little facts issues might impact covid response there. they’re smart will. mean, totally fail develop therapeutics vaccines within next 12 months, sure maybe reconsider face masks go herd immunity, experts seems fairly optimistic both. 

If effective antiviral vaccine end 2020, would say mask-wearing would worth it. Personally I’m excited EIDS-2801, antiviral administered orally. revenge Trump cancelling visas. it’s good? New interested tips That’s agree Europe doing. countries right ban whoever want regardless non citizens fucks over. I’m open borders applaud Europe putting citizens first. also applaud Trump banning H1B visa bullshit end year. ban needs permanent. Big tech whoever else uses H1B hire pool 360 million people already here. can’t find qualified applicants pool (there plenty, want pay shit wages) use cash train people. 

I’m fed tax dollars going fund college train workers jobs companies don’t receive dividends even though made investment company via forced taxation funds pell grants government subsidized student loans. exception doctor, employers need pay profits train educate workers beyond 12th grade think education beyond 12th grade necessary jobs offer. Honestly surprised already case! Crying masks social distancing being:
*unconstitutional (heard much even seen cars) 
* fearmongering 
* stupid
* Covid worse flue
* God protect me
* Covid conspiracy
* body choice, scared getting sick wear mask refuse.

This stuff seen heard personally large amount people. swear God hear fried brains... I'm curious American Healthcare system. Let's say insurance covers hospital doctors, hospital full, redirecting everybody hospital B. Hospital B covered insurance, went without wanting / choice emergency. insurance say, sucks you? gonna cover cause directed B cause full?

To would make sense completely covered full, system little strange I'm genuinely curious concerned. BCBS putting giving entire workplace employer provided insurance

Perhaps see one ""we charge nothing unless win"" lawyers. sounds pretty fucked up. 

Good Luck wife! can’t blame race human one.

You right. I've seen plenty blame white people appalling. CDC changed stance regards mask, reality, respiratory protective equipment actually invented protect user. 

I mean I’m measures protection, relying mask, however many studies shown use face mask population actually helped slowing spread reducing mortality No, they're different related viruses. Yeah *rock!* :) That's good hear man sounds like sub par experience cost? really reduce price shut much. way would bring family now.  I'm surprised. better control vulnerable people leave table reopen. wave bound happen. question put control back well enough slow rise prevent strain healthcare system. need consider area move problem bay area. Housing prices rise, salaries rise account it, housing continues rise etc. Yep. wants report cases ICU actually “intensive care”. Stupid fucks don’t realize ICU stands intensive care unit. Yeah, constraints using it. One administered emergency case patient information needs record. second, given mild moderate case. probably mild moderate case might emergency use dose limited huge extent.  


Another thing stands is, dosage extremely high, doctor high doses (I talking 18 pills first day 8 next 4) like might impact liver. much clarity that.  


Hopefully get place medicine becomes affordable too, right priced quite high. close 1.4 USD per pill, many indians might able afford it. think would happened NY residents approached way? What's going TX spread awful, guys nothing happened NY - look. said ""fuck it"" tried ""move on"". But, guys see hospitals start getting overrun set field morgues too. try act like herd immunity solution, also see country Sweden tried straight work. made PSA people Richland Wa, Benton-Franklin counties. Monday Benton-Franklin reported 299 new cases. 

Our elected officials rejected mandates masks. listen public board commissioners meetings. meetings, Brad Peck refers positive reported cases “alleged positives”. People call conspiracy theories given platform even amplified. -this really upsetting family working COVID test site local healthcare. conspiracy theories going result healthcare workers harmed- Clint Diddier holding campaign rallies closed airport hangar packed full old farmers. guy sits board health! vote out. 

The following direct quote local flatten curve, report.

I’m klutz didn’t bother trying anything home maybe might interest you. latest case/death chart Texas. Note running 7-day average, never really declined:

 Texas still low terms per capita deaths:

 sort point, degree. think Germany proven virus well contained without enforcing strict general curfew like places have. think nice US show rest developed world do. CNN Editorial Board put town also struggling high % positive among Hispanic population. town named coronavirus hotspot CDC - currently highest caseload whole state even though small suburb. indeed driven local Hispanic population. thankfully mayor racist af it. two reasons hitting Hispanics. One Hispanic population largely working low-paid jobs employers forcing employees work crowded unsafe conditions. Fast food workers, restaurant staff, overcrowded/overworked factory workers. Even construction iffy it’s heavy labor people tend breathing hard near other. 

The second thing cultural factor: multigenerational families living one roof, grandparents end catching virus teenage grandkids working adults (who turn got forced work overcrowded/unmasked job somewhere). essence it’s like entire Hispanic population functioning elder care facility, elder care facilities always tend high caseloads. It’s heartbreaking scary. laughed myself, like expect, rational reckoning like democracy ? US fake-religious dictatorship, there's way around it. Yeah science advisor, dictator.

I schoolboy, teacher really one going around telling wear.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

We've seen many ways achieved harmful: foremost among triaging elderly disable people denying care one doctor called ""active euthanasia"" (link claim along overview burden Swedish healthcare found here:

Even despite this, hospitals ""severely strained"" months uncertainty long strain last. really. It’s turned less deadly flu. people predicted March. 30 people hospital at, “doubled !!!” 15 Labor Day. Read sarcasm Lol! virus brought US knees?!? think spelled “The Government” wrong... Tell work China that's Hong Kong Taiwan low death rate (we got fifth HK yday 6 months, 8 millions people), maybe anti-China make want beat us ?

This sad works places people STILL look away... worst: works place made fucking thing first place... think ""In God Trust"", problematic. talk separation church state, actually it.

If people would stop waiting message God, listen health officials instead, would much better off. do. OMG can't believe forgot Sir. Sir Ian McKellen going find exact revenge behalf bestie. Tbf, lot social distancing blanket-ruling due difficulty conveying risk different forms activities. I, one, judge semi-crowded beaches (if OTT), see much vector.

But said... mitigating factors, outside+masks etc, still find hard believe. find week two, definitely worth researching lot improving distancing etc requirements.

Fucking THIS. I’ve screaming rooftops near live, I’m desperately hoping makes small difference. Yup see spike 100 people rally get infected. see 100 infect 1000. jump conclusion yet county downgraded low risk. Mask compliance pretty bad though, especially hick town work.

It politicians system resulting chose them. Americans proud ""checks balances"" government, system election effective checks, especially behaviors elections. There's tens millions people Texas. hundred hospitalizations overwhelm anything. exactly tiny country would suggest posting /r/nova instead great compared Disney World... Speaking truth. get anyone would spend money Disneyland go World instead unless live next door. Oxygen concentrators could used widely within hospitals save wall oxygen vents needing high FiO2. concentrators deliver 4-5L per minute, 10L/min. give credit succinct evil strategy. he's burying head sand (of course) concerned keeping economy running he's smart enough see inevitability he's doing. Okay, clear trolling point. live rural Texas. political party. People, conservative liberals, convinced simply avoiding virus point. 

The lockdowns social distancing bought us extra time, government (both sides) promptly nothing with. additional restrictions going delay inevitable, time get it, hope die, move on. CDC WHO. wear mask protect others. protect social distancing, washing hands, keeping face. someone covid coughs you, unless germs land mask, you’re really protected. person wearing mask are. I’m 100% masks, you’re wearing mask protect you’re missing mark little bit. 

If “to protect others” isn’t enough reason person something, person asshole. doesn’t mean wearing cloth face covering going protect airborne pathogens. Oh right hey, plenty covid go around Florida! said thing turns lot countries hate us much would naive think would want American bum mooching system... Sighh, leave dream exact response HIV AIDS. definitely right considering put beliefs ahead facts us weirdoes would ever base beliefs facts.

So, get tested I'm infected. making voluntary (ie: refuse) instead mandatory failing upon local officials. check. Can’t remember yesterday’s presser live reporting Aftonbladet. Almost every media outlet section related COVID-19 increasing. want know increasing? increasing donald trump's America, that's increasing! narcissistic denial!! one saying protests transmitting. think ""super-spreading"" events bars, choirs meat processing plants.

I think protests used live-experiments help us fight virus smarter way.

Want reopen restaurant? set tables outside. Want reopen store? Set products door attend customers sidewalk. discrepencies states I'm really curious states regulate travel states. imagine NH overjoyed thought lot FL, Tx, Az residents coming in.... Optimism bias sounds healthy ironically, positive effect? Negative bias would bad actual fuck UK struggling virus well, we'll probably right you. Alabama like 20th place per-capita cases. Nowhere near New Yorks New Jerseys US. 33 percent increase cases last two weeks, 36 day doubling rate. 

Texas, comparison, doubling rate moved 24 days 19 days last days 136% growth rate last two weeks. Alabama great, nearly shit show Texas turning into. think gonna change cases really overwhelming hospitals look like Italy. Stubborn motherfuckers. Shhhhh, sensationalist news allowed. little 4k deaths. 

Somehow we're supposed believe 1.4 billion people China...where virus first broke lived months detected...has amount deaths state Connecticut 3.5 million people. serious question, politician fit lead situations this, anyone throw office? would serve greater good remove them.  10-20 years, EU member countries want leave civil war

Says dude literally living place protestors, armed police, neo-nazis fighting streets. Lol VN actually installed testing capacity early they've one leading countries testing early phase pandemic.

Together military-style lockdowns (locking parts city hard 1 case) enabled contain outbreak.

Putting together testing infrastructure hard ur govt prioritizes it. Way go, florida! Making trump proud ""low""numbers😎 comon guys underrated comment here! upvote got friend yet leaking data via POCSAG day long nobody cares know years now. Wuhan bad, rest China spared mostly. propably 86k, we're certainly talking millions like US think Texas third world fucking mind. problems doubt. world economy own. dont shithole. lol toes. First big toes, middle toes, pinky toe, big toes again. Wel least come problem, since coordinated plan put motion. certainly going look good paper! state (Wisconsin) issued stay home orders March 24th 457 confirmed cases opposed 20,000+ New York theirs. total, we've seen 25,331 cases 5.8 million people roughly .44% state's population. New York seen 2% population test positive since stay home orders issued March 22nd (over 390,000 cases 412,000+ come March 22nd). New York quite 4 times population Wisconsin look back yesterday's numbers see long would take us get New York 100,000 less cases (4 times Wisconsin's figure), go back May 1st, month stay home orders issued month half yesterday.

That's essentially Wisconsin's entire journey COVID-19 New York's done post-stay home orders even granted month afterwards adjust orders adjusted figures population size. Even excluded NYC entirely counted everywhere else state, they'd still 7 times amount cases despite twice size Wisconsin (which also cities utilize public transit believe not).

New Jersey much better since they're basically proportional New York cases deaths factor population sizes. New Jersey 3 million people (roughly third population) Wisconsin 7 times amount cases 17 times amount deaths. 

Even looking new cases deaths yesterday, New York 664 cases 46 deaths. New Jersey 570 new cases 51 deaths. Wisconsin 263 new cases 5 deaths. would put New York slightly better position Wisconsin terms new cases lot worse deaths adjusting population sizes. New Jersey worse new cases deaths would considered good them? really think looking situation relative used (which much worse), looks like compare states who've always fairly good. words, ""looking better"" relative term. ""We look better did"" different saying ""because look better now, means go get point beats always looked good start with"" case anyone know, example competition level rower fits model peak cardio health. Typically, like 3-6% body fat superb VO2 max (peak oxygen uptake) surpassing sport. extremely troubling virus cause much damage someone excellent health. Lol two months New York fine educated people living civilized society. Across entire state widespread compliance wearing masks. alone literally enough stop second wave. stats excess deaths? saw one UK TV month ago indicated true death rate ~2x reported. relatively transparent figures. I'd interested seeing US figures. China ofcourse probably waste time everything fudged there. lot simply exiting system buying gold advance what’s almost certain decline value $.

Yes lot initial wealth ill-gotten sure lot people they’ve leveraged gain wealth. unscrupulous taken huge advantage bailouts well. Greed limits. That’s it’s “Phrasing!” “Context clues!” infected flight positive cases sitting different rows. infected got plane Pakistan. people travelling BKK uninfected leg safe, real worry sitting next connecting flight DBX. Wear mask try social distance best can.

But end day, real worry getting London UK seem control. that, imagine patient, feeling horrible vulnerable ever, Redditor edgelord walks room pointing phone camera you. FFS nothing sacred anymore?

If saw happening hospital, I’d personally detain jerk security arrived. Thank you!! ease mind lot!! Depends part town. one Kingwood seems care. I'm glad mask order Harris County. point exhumed Reagan would better candidate Trump. Ya, live parents. They're prime targets virus. Elder, immunocompromised. I've work since begining April.

While mind working, find following hilarious sad. urged go search work, told get sick I'm expected come back home, want die.

I'm sure logic here. Professional Sports believe density component, well time exposed component. 30-45 minutes exposed socially distanced leaves far less ""viral load"" 3 hours sitting shoulder shoulder. don’t know you’ve seen case coverups less testing requested, states receiving additional funds feds popping positive tests. Definitely did. Idve gone Suffolk Law nights that’s me. mean nobody power? power fuck things up? Trump did. honestly feel bad TX FL residents particular. governors tossed jail way they've handled shit put people risk. ignored information already states like mine MA, NY NJ got hit hard spring, stay Trump's speed dial. criminal one particular political party made pandemic politics instead public health safety. meta analysis shit posts subject Flatten curve!

Protesting BLM ok promoting certain political view.

Oh, shit, look that, curve going back up. That’s spirit New York city 3x dead bodies march April timeframe previous years. Triple number dead people. literally refrigerated trucks full bodies cope. Basically temporary mass graves parked street. Trump imposed travel ban China early stage correct move deny that?    

What remember decision criticized politicians american. People reddit warning american incoming virus could possibly carried coming back China called racist.  

All advices got downvoted oblivion. guys care trump hiding info CDC clueless virus. telling kid, stage every fucking government planet except china cluess virus. 

You need CDC government tell prevent it. Use common sense. contaminated virus already known millions people china infected. one way spread fast - person-to-person transmission. Entry restriction, mask, sanitizing, isolation. Simple that. no, american tell must let travellers china get country America. Yea guys suffer consequence ever blame anyone. 

The problem US poorly coordinated federal effort, later part. first stage entry virus spread it, largely ill-informed civilians human emotions overtaken scientific facts. That's call stupid here.   

And no, guys look stupid time. would think Trump might also frustrating lead bunch idiots listen. brother Utah tested 4 times try prove everyone else coronavirus fake. lives parents pretty at-risk. everyone except mom acts like big deal. Hello, big surge first wave. fair, haven’t unified decades secession best option. Wow everything soaring, surging skyrocketing. yup. vote orangutan again, assholes ...or dexamethasone, huge ness last week I'm sure missed *stonks go up* Germany closing schools cases left right, going well here. also often require masks usual class sizes. IGermany closing schools cases left right, going well here. also often require masks usual class sizes. hope countries careful. primary schools, four secondary vocational primary schools, related big outbreak Germany moment, others aren't) school)

This one state, week. primary schools, four secondary vocational primary school)

This one state, week. really intelligence test population states ban travel hit hardest. 

New York, California, Washington, etc. banned allowing visitors residents crossing borders states. highly outweighed draw backs authoritarianism Alabama like 20th place per-capita cases. Nowhere near New York New Jerseys US. It’s small subset subset catch disease recover.. classic headline Never taking responsibility actions. think testkit fiasco sufficient bring large country knees.

For instance, understanding Vietnam number countries limited access testing managed get virus control quite quickly. Hippa though They’ll leaving every city/county/state fend themselves. it’s changed two hours original ticket, get refund according US law. apply european visa outside Shengen ( UK, Ireland, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania,Croatia) stay little apply Schengen Visa. Befire read visit FB groups expats nomads . Hey man. You’re gonna ok. Yeah it’s never going enough a) european union 512 million inhabitants per 2018 b) 9,24 million cases worldwide 2 316 365 cases EU per 23/06 c) comparison hinges fact US EU phase pandemic US currently reports twice many new infections per day. formerly cheap steroid  American feels like one loud mouthed asshole ""friend"" always gets mixed dumb shit., Casket ready jobs long we're inventing new bottoms, worst case mutation COVID makes even deadly second third wave? community ever take responsibility well?  Less addicted positivity, addicted version reality. Good Bad, contradicts want true- than, must false. Okay cool. Can’t wait US lmao.  Running ICU space worse running ventilators. Trumpsterfuck. Totally agreed. imagine actually kind plumber better job US cleaning shit comes people's mouths. LOL. Go cry more. /#Trump2020. silver lining? getting tested. Corporate subsidies fair, people thread totally Trump banning European vacations lockdown totally this. definitely complete mirror event. pandemic taught people would rather let connection die rather inconvenienced. 

Sure maybe person infect someone know people believe it'll happen anyone around does. Right wing populism shit show. Even could, sound like places trying bar people America specifically.

Read European nations trying close borders USA , apparently they're watching news see seem actively go around daring virus infect is.

Can't say blame places, moment. People kinda dumb. lecturing. NY times article based Verge post reads ""EU may bar American travelers reopens borders, citing failures virus"". think childish retaliation answering travel ban applied US EU citizens pandemic first hit Europe back March.  Sounds like Nazi Germany.

LOLOL Agreed.

If US knees now... people going call predicted winter second wave, show up?  Companies often prefer countries poor labour conditions order keep costs down. Swede I'm going take further. deliberate choice, prepared planned response.

I believe they've spent two years strategy (as choice among others) virus hit.

The response coordinated well managed, leads deaths higher infection rate. least front. Well, USA seemed want us back isolationism, looks like assholes might get wish. Yeah same, boyfriend US, I'm German. supposed go visit March, week Trump closed borders. seen since January knows much longer it'll be. get it, really do. US handling well need protect ourselves. fuck, really need this. Australia state borders closed still exceptions freight certain things. Queensland community transmission almost 2 weeks think (all current cases people returned overseas). pretty wild watching craziness tbh.  never really got going decided reopen state. expect us achieve monstrously high numbers catch lag protests. Hello covid 2nd wave, oh wait still 1st wave virus one kind power, time see years later actual results president choices. time crisis like need actual leadership "" moment"" true colours come completely clueless needs done We’ve watching horror past 3.5 years... lmao, farther genius like people addicted positivity. absolutely cannot imagine world things go badly. avoid costs even every shred evidence pointing contrary.

meanwhile, *this* comment, *actual information*, can't even break 10 upvotes doompit.

""No fearmongering"" ass.

This subreddit pathetic. federal government arguably scope control states pandemic. even federal government provide support leadership Germany failed America. Much northeast mandating 14 day quarantine anyone traveling portions US, they're actually banning anyone . know logistics exactly, assume lot us perfectly fine government spending money enforcing means safely celebrate fourth July go beach. Correlation imply causation. increaed cases ""increased testing"" ""Hispanic farmworkers"" economy needs reopen, taxpayer funded governor's mansion open tours yet? like worried DeSantis might get sick something... notice specific exactly powers US government has? mention anything particular government failed do, saying comparing Germany's reliance states managing pandemic US correct balance power responsibility different two countries need California earthquake, raining cats dogs, AI singularity win. I’m Dublin, Tech industry absolutely huge causing major issues rapidly increasing house prices point generation Irish people can’t afford homes town born in.

The Tech industry one important parts economy biggest success call Celtic tiger’, economic boom late 80’s &amp; 90’s Normalcy bias.

In emergency - majority people continue act nothing changed.

I guess science still beats hunchs lies.  

May best immune System win guess ? Unemployment rate plenty high. want go back work I'm sure people happily take job. Errrm... even break top 10. Hell, US ranks 15th best hospitals They're postponing international trip? global reputation already tattered. Stop Nothing gets economy flowing like unprecedented demand body bags cremations. Well I'm fucked honestly both. Hospital ICU bed space well tight ICU nurses, even if/when get travel nurses help staffing physical beds. Even beds convert ICU beds. Yakima escalating cases quickly. 

We're week current pace 3% county's population confirmed covid positive. 60% jobs essential, agricultural food processing heavy spreaders. mention gyms open baseball games played defiance state orders.

Mask wearing increasing, many opposed still. Maybe seeing like 70% compliance. Inslee said recently low 30% I'll take improvement.

County statistics anyone interested: lame subreddit.  remember ELI5 TIL years ago said breathing smell particles. I'm saying wrong think right either. I’m sorry, soon news reports Wuhan province welding people flats delivering food mail flaps contagious disease... warned.  back February.  debate America? Change conversation happening lipstick red places! check US unemployment, homelessness, poverty rates compared EU lol. Borders open EU countries, that’s works

Also shutting borders certain people due emergency literally borders exist thought normal kids get it, symptoms milder? infection rate us sane, lower morbidity. I’ve seen stat reported places, I’m unclear change before? thing get cameraman keep protected actual health care professionals barely enough equipment. there’s HIPAA concerns.

Whats worse us right objecting science left objecting science think rational. country would like go? Arizona ranks 44th preuniversity education. Highest population among bottom 15 states exception California least 4th ranked university system (Arizona 27th).

We high population natives hispanics higher R0 higher complication rate whites. mostly underserved rural communities outside Phoenix Tucson. 

Low humidity Arizona summers large swathes population crowd air conditioned buildings akin northerners huddling warmth winters thought add R0.

If Arizona isn’t leading new cases per million US two weeks reopening may 15 schools supposed return early August I’ll utterly completely shocked.

Repost apparently pointing states political leanings unpalatable auto moderator. wait TWO WEEKS!!!

Armageddon TWO WEEKS!!!!

This time REAL!!!! say anything controversial, sure getting voted lol. police better way deal eu fining adding fees every tourists entering thier countries. Oh wait.. Still, EU far legitimate giving lesson crisis' management US. pretty fucked yet many people acting like corona who? doesn’t get rid theory hot weather hurts virus outdoors, prove hot whether doesn’t stop spread. 

The original hope hot weather summer would pause, kill virus. Like happens every year flu. Even AZ, flu season colder weather. 

While it’s still air whether hot weather kills virus outside, think it’s safe say it’s looking like summer end this. Transmission coronavirus seems greatly reduced outside environments barring large crowds, social distancing possible, I'd say save mask indoor public spaces. Airline profits like 20% lowest. Planes flying 2-4 people them. I’m airline mechanic yes people getting laid off. small company I’m 15 people 20 Furlough station. company previous process bought another company fell pandemic whole company shut leaving 2000 employees mainly pilots, mechanics flight attendants work. gunna shitty industry next 2+ years. smart!

Unsurprising, definitely wise part, it’s still sad came this. need fix ignorance addiction. ""reputation tattered""?

Already been.

LOLOL How’s grandma going? reminder ban wouldn’t apply Canadian citizens. Basically, Trudeau 1 Trump 0. It’s true icus fill flu season, especially smaller hospital systems. month pandemic (so February, flu season) hospital diverted 17 patients whole month. two week period May June, sent 200 patients, ... normal. Also, hospital built icu tent parking lot flu season. field hospital set take surge flu patients. Again, normal. travel restrictions lot softer abroad trying get home. can't find anything specific news story EU citizenship, fine getting gf. (same goes US citizenship coming back mom though) Worst case scenario find, trouble getting flight (any EU embassy help there) otherwise worry dude. Good luck. US upward trend cases started 9th June. started slowly, 5 days later started accelerating. day 1 transmission, average day 10 detection day 24 death. Upward trend start tomorrow go slowly Monday start accelerating up. vastly underfunded u.s. apart army? move back realize shit president said can’t let cure worse problem itself. Karen needs salon visit. Australia, illegal inducement give alcoholic drinks gamblers. live college town Oklahoma tons people Texas come here. Cases rising last couple weeks since everyone’s come back start leases. Oklahoma gonna hit hard we’re nowhere near prepared. don’t like relinquish kid’s US citizenship problem solved. Birthright citizenship needs go. never start with, part law badly misinterpreted. also need end dual citizenship US. pretty obvious Trump views covid PR issue wants able report lower numbers say going away. Hes said numerous times tons cases cuz testing much, wants cut back testing wont many cases.

Some like, I'm young, carefree others think hoax. 😂 Yup. work healthcare heard way many times feel comfortable knowing people work healthcare. hospitals, thankfully. husband’s coworkers camp well. exposed one coworkers wasn’t feeling well last week. responsible thing went doctor, gave note go back work since fever. he’s waiting results, presumptive positive. 

These guys work state DES buildings stadiums everything. husband wore mask, one else did. Including employees government agencies work for.

Arizona hot mess. We’re considering moving East over, simply due idiocy people. Yeah. Lol. That's things I've heard ""actually"" wants us afraid Covid. economic devastation starting. We’re epic ride. Might want invest long term food stores. 🤷‍♂️ apply outdoor situations maintain social distancing? can’t find answer. Yikes chicken pox party covid Arizona speak. bottom camp. southern states ok summer bc nothing do, summer set creeks river banks PACKED idiots wearing confederate flag bikinis kids running amuck need (re) take action *before* hospitals fill Lol. part current situation we're suggests otherwise? 

You think people think bill gates made corona track 5g towers causing corona people would listened masks earlier changed message? 

The fact is, long POTUS goes TV/Twitter tells people wear masks, ""the Dems wearing masks attack me"", nothing else scientific matters I'd also add UK's numbers falling 6 weeks. hospitalizations deaths tiny fraction peak.  America free-est! TIL lesser man even mean? never got bad entire country. know two people got recovered. Yea still change sheer shock.




I telling friends back January would bad here. still shocked state locked down. 





You could predict see shit coming pipeline, still change feeling hits face. 





Those people still calling crazy say even worst it. Many planning vacations fall I'm telling October knee deep again.  😘 byebye  Let piss even further. “shut down” economy 2 months, causing unemployment rates see great depression levels what? reopen economy like nothing ever happened? We’re literally back square 1 except many people lost jobs. Yeah, dislike way too. Would much preferred ""Masks work, much evidence community transmission they're recommended public yet, need surgical grade masks frontline workers health. recommend people look sourcing quality cloth masks help prevent risk community spread public feel they'd comfortable mask"" update message widespread community transmission PPE supplies become stable. Instead 'masks work - oh wait, do' pretty easy weed friends / acquaintances Anti-Mask. US let South secede. one handled perfectly, situation control northeast. long hotspots parts country seep back toward them. Canada 35,857 tests today, 304 positive. 

  Biden beat Trump election. criticizing lock measures, need arrested. Mexico border closed since March. hope Canada follows, also stops people wandering Alaska american please it, would piss trump bad knew big trouble, people want believe virus real started characterize Dr. Fauci politically motivated. Doomed, 20-30% Americans refuse anything want to. Or, alternatively, someone believes every wingnut conspiracy theory there. aren’t necessarily New Yorkers spreading states though. definitely hundreds (likely thousands) workers states travel NYC work. Gooo Mina! Vote 6300 see today situation 2 weeks ago.  told why, right cut communication.

Some family covid deniers insist workers must sacrifice sake economy. 

My life improved 500% since cut ~3 weeks ago. amazing. Let's go list places reopened masks seen increase:

Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, Finland, Austria, Ohio, etc.

Soooooo may work clear reopen without masks problem. Yes science is, one arguing that.

The keyword comment *ideally.* course ideally, science would independent politics people would never dispute it. I’m sure you’ve paying attention past forever, never case. world controlled ground politics, people dispute science time.

If Fauci wants science heard, play game politics, current political climate happens controlled good amount science deniers. That’s reality we’re living He’s talking sides mouth try seem reasonable appeasing voters.

First “Because spread rampant right now, there’s never reason leave home,” Abbott said. “Unless need go out, safest place home.”

But he’s also urging restaurants bars stay open. goes ""We choose jobs health. both. protect Texan lives also restoring livelihoods. ... Together, keep Texas wide open business.”

Stay safe. keep bars restaurants wide open. It’s crazy. Canada, provincial borders enforcing mandatory quarantine periods province essential visitors returning residents. New Brunswick, still cant visit neighboring provinces unless it’s essential travel. don’t know US can’t enforce state state. Good news makes people go outside. Fight! Fight! Fight! bidet master race

~ 💀 aqua mundet omnia 💦~ Congratulations, America. We've become third-world, banana republic. Def perfectly..
Better yes
Perfect? Apparently nice make fun Russian cover ups???

I appreciate assist though bud. I'll save seat hell 👍 give up, go deaths up.

Same happened March That's immunity works. article title misleading. analyse memory T-cells produce antibodies talk immunity. Antibody levels fall naturally virus body fought off. Well said Trump administration would well coordinated federal effort anything looked like idiot now. bad surprising. Houston, Texas. Results took 7 days. Got tested Monday morning, got results Monday. told 3-5 days test site, expecting wait. Sweden? Makes sense.... hate wearing mask, you’re gonna love ventilator. going schools? schools set open 1 1/2 months. What'd need guns for? God Trust, right? good! wish half funny :(  ""In April, Tariq Jameel, popular Islamic preacher, claimed coronavirus sign God's wrath sins women dancing dressing immodestly.""

You know extreme conservatism religions probably fuel pandemic denials. think people chosen one God protect faithful humble. 

Whereas God probably like dude made Fauci help y'all. Wear fookin' mask. Think too. Work education normally excluded regulations. guess 2 weeks quarantine expect. ... wasn’t? easy make sense: see dollar sign go up, want go up. mistake thinking corporate execs think like human beings. Sent PM detailed questions - could please check em. Thanks! You’re reason cases spiking. Right, let's address real problems. Never read comics except lucky luke zagor kid Honest question, many people twenty five even know fax machine is? Tu mama. whats number much winning. momentous event Florida. Everyone sat took notice. first big domino. Movement restricted unprecedented level combat relatively weak virus. definitely attack liberty. Especially we're told okay go social gatherings long protest specifically BLM. kidding, one relative shooting Allied forces manning FlaK around Frankfurt, ones busy fighting dying Russia.

I book names men village (approx. 1000 people) went war. family name pretty rare German, lot book. Also names former schoolmates (asked dad, told great grandfathers on. Country life, everyone knows everyone) problem governments still wishy-washy mask use. I'm low tranmission area Australia (single digit zero cases state weeks) we've oubreak Vic, shows could outbreak areas would could benefit mask use happen. still clear recommendations government, despite PPE issues sorted now, risk community transmission clear overseas. US nation freedom-loving puritans. right bear arms see nipples TV. Shocked tell you. Shocked! 50 em America sends people, they’re sending best. They’re sending people lots health problems they’re bringing problems them. They’re bringing Covid. They’re feverish. some, assume, healthy people. No. Tbh bro majority population poor uneducated. fucked Uh UK wearing masks. They’re seeing spikes. 

Switzerland Norway also things US isn’t like actually enforcing social distancing. 

Yeah, I’m really pissed countries wearing masks, especially proven work. bronchiectasis. Developed long-term pneumonia wasn’t spotted although kept going doctor complain breathing pain chest. Scarring lung real pain – get six chest infections year. fun. many died? Sick hearing many people caught cold asymptomatic. make sense lot us either really understand deifying man gotten front nation lied us life-and-death information. 

Is he's standing next someone 100x worse trump? it? Thank God damn, number times I've said past 3 months ""nobody's seeing hair anyways, cares"" double digits. thought I’ve heard every blame game, finger pointing tactic excuse there, takes cake. Russian roulette 3 6 chambers loaded. call choosing actively exposed pandemic bankruptcy ""uncomfortable."" feels pretty coerced me. I’d wish you’d quarantine going states. sheer amount NY plates Florida right mind boggling. going well bouquet lead balloons Cowlitz County. Proud Boy mentality already prevalent, tenfold due this. 81 active cases, that's 3 yesterday, 7 Friday (the last time checked it). 

On Friday also ""rally"" open parks local lake around town. also group calling ""We People"" taking upon ""demonstration"" several days spanning 4th July (the 3rd, 4th 5th) happen include live music, food vendors various activities local 4th July festival cancelled. issued letter city council saying applying permits, anyway, grievances city rather state. 

I think Inslee buffoon, least acknowledge wearing mask social distancing cancelling events myself. Asian countries much closer China geographically small fraction deaths this. took action whine China. sat ass said would disappear like miracle blaming China. lot people posting ‘just wait 2 weeks’ people saying ‘look Florida, everything’s fine even spring breakers’. 

I get feeling lot types conversations gone. wanted see impression matched people who’ve hanging last month. Desperate old racists try blame foreigners incompetence.

When wife able see coming January, plan accordingly, leadership entire country obligation respond least well us. We're even smart.

And job. 

I suspect yet another electioneering scheme. Like everything else US government late, there's substance threat. Nothing USG enforce actions. move help protect black individuals institutional racism. one individual said, black person wearing bandana looks like criminal sketch. crap need place, comes stance protecting non-white individuals racism Yup  Au pairs don’t special visa knowledge. either get student visas (bc language class requirement) long stay work visa (travailleur temporaire usually), ought processed along student regular work visas. France doesn’t want American tourism. There’s studies show covid blow across infect entire restaurant depending air flow Noooo fcukkk can’t emigrate boy howdy was. local Vons started carrying hand sanitizer clearly marked made brewery/distillery. had, $6 bottle bought 4 (the limit). Cracked open office week ago- smell PURE VODKA. certainly can't walk around office smelling like Perestroika, want smell like Putin's gym bag circumstance. 

Lesson Learned: buy distilleries! Meh know wacky Christian end-time nutters obsessed mark-of-Devil needed conduct business. 

They always see people wanting impact shadows...
They thought thing Bluetooth and. RFID chips...

They ignore predictions stretch stuff try make fit...


These guys probably anti-vax anti-science crowd. One step away “ medicine bad Jesus cure kid cancer” - let kid die crowd...

People swear would drag us back horse buggy era... Granny killer cuomo already done much damage unenforceable quarantine thing left try save face one could foreseen this! Yep, believe that's case entire state, unfortunately. know county barely respected SIP order. Retail stores stuff still open. Figure? Grammar! NJ NY gotten asses kicked mean. rename Covidstan. Hell, (using general sense) even get creative masks want to. Just. Wear. A. Fucking. Mask. Believing China's number higher believe virus infects fixed % population matter what's done control outbreak. ironic twist, US become shithole country. i'm looking evidence links back china somehow Playing chess pigeon. I've seriously considering going Hawaii month. work remotely, well there. I've looking 28 day+ rentals, can't find reasonable price condos (I want risk exposing anyone condo, also can't use pool condo quarantine). 

The flights super cheap right now, reason housing coming down. guys expecting reopen soon something? understand AirBnB hosts lowing prices whole bunch long term rentals. change yesterday positive rate 7.30%

The change yesterday US same. However, data skewed states much better shape. 

In end, really paint good picture. Furthermore, democracy best outcomes making ""optimal"" decisions, seems people focusing on. much, so, fair governing process reach decisions, good bad. fuck downvoting this. awesome. tested positive March 24th Leader... think leader? I’ve seen leadership potential box crayons. sentence make sense. exactly accusing now? do? mean EU residents plans visiting US weeks? feel like bit sensationalized. thing back March COVID-19 spreading rapidly Europe. Honestly kinda surprised EU now. actually processing? 

I've contacting visa office past two weeks, literally least five times per day never answer goddamn phone emails next time ""The US Government opposite job""...  tries this, everyone laugh face. power paper practice also need go France study September, consulate city said even letting schedule discuss visa. way still get one? Floridian, he’s actually got point. old crazy people around violently opposed wear mask. insist wearing one. won’t freedom trampled. Who’s job round old crazy people they’re trying rush Walmart maskless? really. that’s family stays home. wait 2nd wave. expected lot worse. deserve  doesn’t. Shooting last resort. good amount time pulling firearm pointing deterrent. Hence stand ground law states cannot shoot someone running away. Also robbers fake guns, dont want kill anybody, scare folks complying. sounds right. Yeah I’m thinking mainly NYC metro area, upstate NY/NH/Vermont (skiing, winter sports) fall winter time. sees lot people state country too. Tourism effectively dead summer rest country doesn’t get virus control, economic recovery places fall also going hindered. Like get it, sort sucks. spouse sent Germany three years plan go end year indefinitely could mean see while. Universal Studios Sea World already opened Florida. watch videos see feedback YouTube park regulars see measures taken compliance like. Mask want, covid coming eyes toilet plumes. kidding. Maybe. Scientists updating daily transmission. milage may vary. I’m rocket rocket surgeon, enough model rocket engines inserted inside anything would reach orbit, right? Hahah look like he's black face thumbnail? human world... mess.

(Also, I'm sorry loss slightly ashamed dragging Ariel this) This. lasted week right IHME predicted 100,000-240,000 deaths August (everyone keeps saying wrong actually spot on). Fox News started using phrase “we can’t let cure worse disease” trump tweeted phrase day. days later took interview Fox News talking open easter. think Brazil's going better. ""economy"" darlings never understood prolonging pain would cause damage. Ignoring problem much easier. Strokes heart attacks too. part social justice crowd

So understand people like causing this? going stop keep getting worse. Wake up. Novak Trump tennis. “fans” blind eye last months. significant happened date drives insane. work industry requires receiving lot medical records. Many (if most) hospitals refuse release medical records facsimile USPS claim emailing PHI HIPAA violation. like they've never heard encrypted email...

So surprise all. already soaring?  ?? things still going down. northern Mississippi everything full go open right now. Casinos, baseball tournaments, stores, everything. dad went drop lunch wife Saturday. two mask on. saw cars seven different states. Shit going get fucky here. Living Michigan, we’ve 300 less cases week. 90% everyone comes work mask on, people distance everywhere, really taken thing seriously. So, offense rest America fuck don’t come here. guys cool worked way fucking hard spent way much time indoors things unravel idiots again. really wish close state borders; seems insane right way things going... give two months. wish states would Hanging outdoors without friends healthier. US tried invade Canada before. [Didn't bad managed federal level US, didn’t expect get bad. didn’t expect case numbers approach peak two months ago it’s starting piss off. sit tight couple months take basic steps keep essential workers safe. Instead cavalier didn’t consider fact poorly protected essential workers kept virus alive spreading. still states started reopening without meeting protocols set CDC. guidelines instead requirements. 

This p*litical leaders owners essential businesses, people refused take seriously. 

And economy suffer longer necessary short-sighted decisions. 

And it’s everyone whined economy, couldn’t fathom economic impact going far worse impatience.

And let’s clear. one person deserves lion’s share responsibility know is. svetty ballz  think underestimating much tourism Vermont, NH, Maine Massachusetts. must sick joke right? April fools July? reiterated 6 times lockdown Tex-ass happen.

Smh. Cincinnatus bad ass tapped dictator second time stepped back 21 days. Dude wanted farm peace. build temporary hospitals can’t force take seriously, I’m guessing it’ll feel lot real lot people shit hitting fan community instead across country. It’s shame come though. Even surgical masks offer protection wearer. number studies, none really robust conclusions, generally group surgicals measurably lower particle counts, ILI infections, etc. Although dramatically sealed respirators. Yes know US medical staff shortages. However, majority media China SK doctors, officials, scientists, etc., spoke Covid wearing masks early Late Novemver. Even simply cultural differences, deny least stop spread way? virtually cheapest way avoid spread without intense, economy stopping lockdown. Even today, anti-mask sentiment (mostly reddit mostly Americans) misses whole point wearing one. Well banned, wouldn’t blame EU. Unfortunately, whole world Australias forced quarantine saved us. 

You fly - two weeks guard hotel. visitors. Stupidity When’s next set trials public gets results ? Right Wisconsin playbook. GOP took (I know masks, wrestling open, really important) Supreme Court Wisconsin Democratic Governor already opening. previous GOP Governor assigned 2 4 justices overturned stay home order. Choreographed look like big freedom win. Get ready Walmart AR15 crew show Florida soon ""freedom fight""for right wear mask public.

How possible, people stupid? Oh no, Trump gonna pull America EU.  Even asymptomatic ending organ/vascular damage. Florida needs realize Covid-19 joke. friend living wants come see (in Indiana) Labor Day Weekend. He's wearing masks he's thinks staying 6 ft apart gatherings enough. He's constantly posting shots different places Florida he's been, small number. places anyone masks barely best. Needless say, he's coming house! nonsense talking about. 20 years experience dealing numbers right there. 

Look, honestly doesnt matter me. Believe EVER want believe. Like said earlier post - family treating anything normal perhaps aggressive flu numbers bear out. 

Speaking numbers manipulated 

Again believe whatever works you. family members walk around face masks on, cant live bubble expect strong immune system. refused lockdown - closed parks gyms still leave calistenics home DAILY bike rides weekends, followed healthy diets rich vitamin D3 (cod liver oil) exposure sunlight ever can

You ... body ... could care less threat Get lawn damn kids!! /s Northern States rolling lockdown. period 10 days went kind locked almost full lockdown. I'm thinking idea keep people panicking. seeds planted Governor way announcement wasnt major shock rather expected. No. Stay home safe. Frode Forland said expect big second wave, small cluster outbreaks contained: FHI change mind lately?

And yes, masking frustrating. pan-Nordic problem. thought lot might tbh come good answers. insight *why* is? Anyway, know alone Norway this! 

It would nice would come around. think one Nordic country adopts masks, others (maybe Sweden though given current cliamte) follow. tbh sadly think Nordic country adopt masks proactively; think we'd see resurgance Denmark, Finland, Iceland Norway would happen. Brazil definitely pass US soon real deaths cases, ever report it? major hotspots Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro Manaus haven’t increasing testing much positive rate hovers around 50%. 

Even many deaths aren’t tested bodies burried without test. think US leadership nearly hospital capacity, significantly denser cities, hyper corrupt system private hospitals unofficial burials. pray Brazilian brothers sisters! college reopens fall it’s really canceled Rhode Island. dropped /s? whats sad speech march lower curve keep foot gas get nothing.... would ever? Ruling country exhausting expensive work. way gets go horse races travel abroad :) fucking idiot. place bump grind porkfest masks rules capacity limits lots naked penis read becoming next epicenter r/NoShitSherlock Drump said told GOV stop testing results look bad. trust numbers given USA anymore. I’m sorry happened you. husband coworker/friend tested positive March, two subsequent tests tested negative. got sick would go 5-mile runs around twice week problems. currently trouble walking 12 minutes treadmill. recently went doctor heart-attack-like symptoms (numbness arms, chest pains, shortness breath). never admitted ICU paper looks like another mild recovered case. He’s mid-fifties.

Every time see people crowded together tv, imagine many go gone through. It’s pretty horrifying. Faucci said today vaccine likely available early next year. ""years"" seems bit pessimistic. agree. hair loss? True.

Sigh... Usa here. come. Whatever likely worth risk Holy fucking shit. Look Singapore. walk anywhere time day night. drugs. theft. speaking government. fiver says also ban UK travellers - lord knows fucked boris et al managing covid Testing ramped massively month March worst hit areas went pretty strict lockdowns period. 

I know everyone quick jump “it’s actually deadly” train, numbers paper presenting consistent already know serology data we’ve seen. purely mathematical model, data DIDN’T match serology data conclusion would it’s shitty model. direct measure virus exposure (i.e. presence antibodies) trumps estimate every time. aforementioned states, started opening beginning May. would expect UK started beginning June, start see spike UK within next weeks. Thanks info, btw. Stay safe. Also, 4th July significant UK reason, coincidence? 2 users Canada list within last week....unfortunately think Canada interested Chinese vaccine FL &amp; TX done yet? find place lacking said stupidity, kindly let us know. Canada require 14 day quarantine returning citizens?  diplomatic, 80% actual military hardware used NATO belongs US, mention patents expertise. 

US sent soldiers die Europe 2 world wars, protect Europe 75 years plus monitoring worlds oceans free trade. europe taunt us free healthcare etc... Well let provide defense, going petty single president like US done. A) Even list minority nations Europe

B) break further:

Germany state masks required shops supermarkets, rather ""strongly recommended.""**


France

Here Paris yesterday : know Luxembourg Poland.

**I like brought Austria lifted mask requirements last month**


So add Austria UK, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Easter Europe, etc little mask requirements usage. **There nations mask usage majority Europe minimal nearly non-existent usage**. truth. Catching short order would mean better date. virus ridden shithole

Who's ""shithole country"" now? Somebody's words coming back bite somebody ass. worth.. moved Florida cases increasing quite bit. Almost everyone wearing masks area early on. see people news trying fight wear think people small group. actually see people anywhere news. would say least 80-90% people seen wearing masks there. Masks completely sold everywhere first. actually gave mine people thought higher risk. Nonetheless something obviously going wrong. think people thought started going back out. top large groups protesters. think Dan Patrick threatened unscrew bolts wheelchair Ah, 1 2 likely caught it, possible exposure past 2 weeks? asymtpomatic / paucisymptomatic contacts?

That's problem. know test, even then, test point time particular window. aggravation ain’t satisfactioning me. THING ABBOTT  there's way texas locking again. much stubborn pride. good. knew matter time. Americans become pariahs. problem people ones going unnecessarily. job makes work, job makes work. deal it. go restaurant movies get work. irresponsible. like clockwork, exactly 2 weeks US 7 day-rolling average begun upward journey 9th June, 7 day-rolling average deaths takes small turn upwards direction. almost like people saying ""two weeks"" understand takes 2 weeks longer die disease takes detected base predictions observations. Bad leadership. Mixed messages. Inconsistent weak measures. Hasty reopening. Irresponsible citizens. file items WIP America wait see November turns out? NYC schools planning 30% capacity - students attend in-person 2x week. source Administration. Take offense question please, masks readily available Brazil? Exactly. ventilator real “muzzle” Florida DESPERATELY needs tourism. state tax. work Elementary school go work training last week. principal grim near future public school going look like without tax dollars coming in. Right wrong effects areas life pockets Disney corporate execs. Little people know, Dan Patrick pulls strings comical US managed things much better afflicted european countries...if something meaningful like normalize population.

just honest say many unknowns, better prudent limit travel essential travel. Yeah face shield would good idea. way breathe normally children see entire face. exactly earliest? December? November? Northeast going hiding south west going rapidly recently. C'mon man 99.9999972746% chance death what're stoopid Dude they’re clearly senile point China warned Texas. first wave never ended. people talked 'second wave' meant something like decline summer resurgance fall/winter. Summer started surging first wave. going ravaging US vaccine comes ain't happening earlier late 2020 2021. I’ve tried explaining 20/30 yr old friends short time 80+ year lifespan. can’t stay home read book 1 GD summer Jesus Christ. 

But time, 20/30 year olds complain employers want back work, universities contemplating reopening, etc. justify going crowded bar you’re bored, isolate dumbos crowded lecture hall obviously need education. money spent Disney could money someone's savings account weather economic storm. Paywall.. homie larpin it. won’t blame you. would also like see rest world stop travel America too. way one travel America finally fix country. Don’t let us take us. It’s get bad imo want see exact wording order. always wear mask public I'm going around people, job public, coming contact anyone. I'm planning wearing mask situation past. I'm happy hear overall though. Blocked bot  Hey, finally masks mandated basically everywhere here. Hopefully week two start seperate current hot spots.  outside lockdown because? *was* disaster, ""close to"" someone lived, studied, worked US don’t agree all. 
That said, Americans far easiest spot whenever tourist spotting. (I live castle city get tons tourists.) seriously, please stay home country besides America deal people wearing masks readily available them.

Brazilian here.

Brazil. ....yeah fair enough. ""Correctamundo"" 

\- Arthur Fonzerelli isn’t purely science situation. much political situation well  Best big man league Norway long way off.. GF live UK, patiently waiting Wow. really loosing days. ""But mom! kids got presents! Where's mine?!?"" Close Texas! 

/s Na, NYPD would LOVE excuse potential scapegoat harass, extort, bully people hospital say wear one home. could wrong, seem remember quite upset weeks ago Rhode Island (or may New Jersey) exactly New Yorkers. Makes sense. article shared start month. 

At least period time, probably helped containing it. Proof source?  song didnt age anything, deaths actually reported US UK.  say “Douche Bag, Lying Scum Bag”?! Could going along rest sleeze ball D’s he’s playing part George Soros, NWO collapse economy?!?! part Child Sex trafficking that’s going &amp; trying hide it?!?

I'm 99.8% sure able go year :/ cant stop Canadians leaving? America Made GREAT Again! take account day 55k cases due platform states report working properly, highest number new cases single day Europe occupied, times, rebuild. think Europeans stoic general. Private sector working hard US govt fucking around since day one. One imbecile crushing entire country. hard watch. add twist point, (I sure long term studies 1990's said) also 1990s attorneys discovered memoranda dating back 1950's big tobacco companies, showing tobacco companies tested studied knew products caused lung damage cancer killed people. actually knew effects smoking decades told customers. Urgent!
That one FDA banned toxic ingredient insane. 56 new admissions today travis county. looking bad, get worse sure south poorer north, meaning less funding schools, it’s really surprise. ever get extra funding schools, 60% go schools south. bright side, despite awful education, kids NC seem smarter parents. Dosen't U.S. hold influence within NATO? Sure we're good cutting relations military allies great idea. doesn’t change anything predicted death rate. serology data already told us official case number massive undercount.

Lmao 😂 makes sense, pretending Chinese completely lying asses whole time allowing makes absolutely sense. Maybe New Yorkers escaping lockdown? confirmed cases means represent actual infections.

In Italy actual infections estimated least 10X higher.

But worst hit region (Lombardi) probably 10-20% infection rate. thing bigger freedoms US puritanism. doubt happen. American tourism brings millions revenue Europe yearly. effect already damage economy implemented. agree needed doubtful occur  virus America... America would known virus existed, begin with, another country point out... look handling to..

Merica huge biodiversity people... wide range immune systems,... country like health care people.. definitely threat...

Apparently Americans exported food highly contaminated random screen checks RNA strain test mutated original.. LMAO everyone friends wants live indefinitely parents’ basement, homie. underestimate Disneyphiles. addicted. Mouse ahold them. That's government forcing stay home.

Every government Europe paid people's salaries people go broke. 

They also required masks got widespread testing contact tracing running.

America kinda stayed home none things. delusional? US bad spot now. various stay-at-home measures effective every state. cases needed pounded hundred (for large pop states) maybe ~4k whole country. Never got close level. extra time allowed prepare bit better, allocate beds, PPE, testing etc. save lives. may still end good decision lockdown reduced deaths ~2 months, cost jobs economy. Unfortunately virus going terrorizing US probably 4-6 months. “Attention, international students! July 1: visa resident permit applications processed priority – you’ll allowed travel France, wherever you’re travelling from,” Ministry tweeted. Ahh yes... essential needs like water parks bars. Yes, we've discussed thread. 🙂 threaten sue nearby states something similar started? Seconded Even vaccine OKed next year another year enough get us regular peons. Politicians rich people first, trickle front line people eventually family might get year  fucking idea. Illinois understand actually it’s straight shot 55, New York couldn’t believe it. would large government people put there. Maybe next time around survivors think welfare voting instead 1%'s pocketbook.  Employees cheap; masks expensive. survival rate 99.5%? credible source this?

FWIW, lost surviving parent (mom) cancer January. nightmare, sorry. Hey now, Canadians wear WAY Maple Leaf gear wear Stars Stripes gear kiss fight Ireland weeks goodbye? That's article says.

 ""Zhang also wrote article critical authorities’ response outbreak Wuhan, saying government imposed measures infringed people’s human rights.""

""She also questioned whether authorities covered severity outbreak spoke censorship mainstream media."" Heh. Looks like we’re unwelcome foreigners, eh Donnie? Ehhhhhhhh?! right. crazy number Americans apocalypse fantasies. usually get really guns tacticool gear think Lone Wolf survives all. they're ones complaining able get haircut meanwhile normal people fantasize things getting along ok, usually support people. Corona go brrr... government failed us. Federal State. Fauci health professionals saying optimistically vaccine available end year. Vaccines take longer accurate, unlikely. Cases surging, yes people idiots, also people simply **COULDN'T** stay home. needed paycheck. Many people denied Unemployment, rightfully earned it. Many people never got stimulus check.

If government literally shut everything gave everyone Universal Base Income months contain virus guarantee we'd reopening now, August minimal cases. $2.5 trillion given undeserving corporations could've paid mention years, would needed 3-4 months. Whoa, Cali poppin! Exactly. safe way reopen schools classes held indoors. #1 risk factor. indoors. South Florida picking it’s rest state driving bulk new growth. It’s everywhere now, exactly predicted. idiots thought would stay large metros, iT’S CiTy PrObLEm, would go away summer. fucked.

We need another lockdown, time right. let get bad first people actually recognize problem. “Muh freedumb” overrides every consideration people could work home absolutely would. Low grade fever. Chest tightness. Fatigue big time. Diarrhea. Night sweats. 

I go bathroom 8-10 times day. day went ER developed shortness breath. couldn’t much change sons diaper without needing rest. gave z pack feeling better 2 days. traveled bunch late Feb March (Arizona, Toronto Colorado). assume caught Colorado Toronto home 2-3 days two started feeling sick day got back Colorado. anyone told Oregon ""non-white"" exemption mask wearing? Restrictions eased July 1st. never licked like New Zealand, really small numbers chance going win. don’t, Government does. Science. heartbreaking. Sweet, Orange Counties filled stupid people  Absolutely terrible misleading post. study back statement title post.  Unfortunately may add UK travel list. like people WWII complain try make end soon possible. Also, countries affected war. family? wife Austrian, kids dual citizenship something within environment changed perhaps? mean personal responsibility wearing mask isn’t exactly that? lockdown vast majority country, don’t see getting here. Thank much link info!!

I'm curious since seem know I, last paragraph allude study address cellular immunity COVID-19—that is, immune responses involving T-cells rather antibodies. found SARS-CoV–specific T-cells high percentages convalescent COVID-19 patients that's incredibly frustrating. sorry. wear kickass bonnets.  Bars. would wearing mask least... NYC Lol, thought we'd well coordinated federal effort? Based what? seen government?? live DE, police pulling people state plates I-95 Route 1 either writing legal citation quarantine 14 days informing return home state obviously want tests. said outside, keep safe distance, mask required. live next Berkeley, probably 80% people anti Trump, 

yet 1/3 half people see street either wear mask, wearing correctly. “Cure worse disease” line used every chance got. yeah IHME heavily criticized weeeeeks it’s looking pretty darn accurate.

FWIW, I’m sure mismatch new cases rising deaths still relatively low due lag alone. think we’ve actually gotten better managing severe cases. Funny nobody seems care though. friend said exactly asked wasn’t wearing mask. Ranted good 5min hot. see wife's France vacation money going continue collect interest. situation. sister single mom 2 preteens, instagram loaded photos about- even lock down, especially beach. unrelated people. told won;t seeing September. then. currently speaking. wish cared more, I'm starting get really angry cavalierly others seem treat health people could infect.

Like top comment says, cancel 2020, stay home. evidence outside spread relatively rare. happen, still far less Baker said percentage reasonably consistent statewide numbers seen daily testing coronavirus. 

If that's case, increased risk really all, can't know get infection partaking activities everyone else go protests.

There's really compelling evidence protests caused infections. may even forced use Xbox dont think would get tested either unless started showing symptoms. would quarantine 14 days. What’s funny , ones refuse wear mask making everything worse ones wouldn’t travel Europe even leave hick states. rest us suffer knew authorities lying masks really fault even enough masks health care workers? option lie. Same, getting ready attend AUR Rome September. I'd say that's possible places like California, Arizona, southeast testing capacity. percentage rates high places may able catch everybody get additional 5 percent per claim, matter dx, per contact oldjob Unless fly somewhere else, probably choice get US, hopefully virus started weaken cases mild severe. epic response 😎 going happen anyway people going stay fuck away death traps.  sure bring tourist money enough keep park open layoffs going happen anyway little later lot unnecessary infections death.  managing virus properly going harm economy far lockdown ever could. Maybe likely things like buildings getting set fire gets clicks someone going ""hey please use mask pls"" Graph projection next 2 weeks: Plenty people neither need want protect them. want wear mask, means it. others choose to, let them. Maybe different experiences perspectives you? Maybe see feel things differently you? Maybe life death don’t hold meaning you? Man complicated diverse species that’s okay! takes types, people choose cover face people choose to. serious? live Ontario I’m impressed way govt (both federal provincial) handled this. 1000x better shitshow States. No. explain fax machine postdocs work lot. Luckily rarely use anymore. manager EU [von der Merkel. ;) Sadly, many would though. Right?  know people Canada arent looking forward reopening. 

Also fuck Alaska loophole. say take Alaska ship Americans south.  Lana del ray Good lord. hibernate wake time next year? shitshow exhausting makes want slam head wall repeatedly. prefer use Nelson Mandela role model. 27 years prison emerges become President.

Scientific Publications great change healthcare, social system, holidays working Class really personally biggest flaws. also understand 2 major Political Partys thats something would like spare (thats nothing enough background) small comparison, New York postinv better numbers April 26th( 2 months ago), New Jersey never got 6k mark. still day 800-500 daily cases. thing states autumn scary think autumn numbers nutshell. Care elaborate? O.o thing South go. Lewis County basically Vancouver might well ""Eastern Washington Rain""

Thurston County even safe lot people Lewis County come time agree. don’t see American would Vancouver Island without work here. 

And don’t feel bad America, would shut provinces territories way virus ongoing. italian get think Italy better US.

Not single data shows that: testing less deaths per 100k.

The US hotspots, go italian lockdown, expected active cases right now. long hospitals overwhelmed deaths spiking 300 million active cases issue. Expecially better handling virus medically speaking. wont get see family Netherlands anymore? Even coronavirus over? Guess I'm giving american citizenship lieu dutch one curious, also call post-bachelor program university something else? USA, graduate school go get doctorate something level, ""college"" university go get undergraduate. So, graduate school still = uni then? Thank you! FC 3 amazing story Aren’t Canada’s borders already closed Americans? Bible Belt going downfall. Churches requiring masks social distancing way whatsoever. Drives wall. I’m class action. sign would believe proof marriage would qualify exception expected 2-week quarantine. Hoping best me! sure long taking u.s, I'm canada, coworkers son tested results 24hrs, brother tested results less 72 hours. thing planned year (that I've debating canceling months) trip cabin middle hours away. I'm perfectly content staying home another year lol. family member mine, Houston, got first results day(ish). second follow-up test we're stilling waiting six days later. seem much consistency. That's even joke. Since big tech companies (Twitter, Facebook, Google) control, say online, without transparency *democratic control*, would say end democracy digital sphere real threat.

In Germany, things controlled laws! No, quarantine hospital. may admit pulse-oxygen levels low (the clippy thing put finger) fever high. symptoms mild send home. German states banned people German *counties*, cause numbers high there. Imagine realizing Canada also metric fuck ton resources. governor overrode county/city mask requirements state level mandate said masks required.

Desperation. (and likely many others) realize large portion Disney's revenue derived parks. 

Even parks huge part financials, Disney would still taking bath regardless. Corona safety requirements basically killed movie TV production, Disney's movie studio TV show production zero moment. think many people going malls buy things Disney stores, either. also think keep offering lollipops well-behaved give shot draw blood. Sucks I'm expected bring I'm grownup. #How hold Commander Chief accountable, first. Yes, world shifting power balances serious risk US' geopolitical weight seriously shrinking favor China's, allies need anything spreads virus domestic politicial idiocy already does. weaker US good anyone living free world, left right seem hard work achieving that, spurred malignant actors social media hoping sow division increase coronavirus related problems. shame witness, long run may lead many millions knowing freedom falling different sphere influence afterwards. Plus going pandemic except literally feed yourself, moronic. Marxists orchestrating even so, though perhaps goal some. Actually, live island. island get meat, veggies, dairy, fruit grains. one tiny island pacific. Imagine rest Canada provides me. So, no, wouldn’t starve without America. eat Canadian every single day. government mandates plenty things private employers.  fucks sake whole government agency dedicated that.  worker issues going away old solutions longer acceptable. would consider USA developed country, rich country, albeit unequal. We’re gonna start petition create international incident get grad school! think so. Read things recovered Covid19. come home hospital. cold flu. Young people lung transplants. Heart attacks. Strokes. something people need ignore. Many people get kids vaccinated, think they're going take disease think hoax seriously. sorry. know must difficult. felt depth fear able see daughter. don’t know see sister Alberta. 

I hope able see soon! know doesn’t help much. But, missing people incredible difficult. 

I work home grateful option. HR management need support you. asking leave can’t keep mask place. But...this works management job. :( realize vast wildlife population well? vast tribes natives able survive centuries, still do. 

Tons water, tons natural resources shelter economic stability, could literally live land long time. want go route...We're looked like joke world stage. Lots allies. Meanwhile, ""leader"" gets openly mocked world leaders.  

Or purposely stupid sake it? 

Enjoy CoVID spikes. We're reopening.  Ehhhh, live southern California absurdly thick hair. *need* haircut. That's used clippers myself. Switzerland EU ;) people get idea island countries better? like stuck 19th century. 58% international travel remember telling American Britain say Canadian. forgiven accent, get beer bought you. Well. depends. enter hostel room first time, would introduce myself:"" Hi, I'm 
... ....nice meet guys."" anyone show interest? Start smalltalk. people nod get business, I'll shut leave be. 

And someone sleeping, I'll stfu.

You find people willing socialize common areas like bars/lobby.

There places meant socialise like lobby, places chill/recharge like sleeping rooms places stfu like shared bathrooms. would consider USA developed country, rich country, albeit unequal. Can’t get people right thing. Time mandatory face masks public think. It’s easier enforce. agree. deep hesitate endorse paranoid side saying won’t get many things back “normal” ever  never great. People never talked it. called American Immigrants, expats. really understand ""It's selfish mindset/mentality"" ""People selfish"" comments come something related topic posted.

I consider extremely selfish consequently, want stay alive better chances staying alive sick brutal disease probably make muscles bones feel like someone shattering hammer, sore throat akin swallowing needles, chronic fatigue breathing difficulties render impotent mercy people hospital setting. I'm damn selfish want avoid cost much humanly possible.

Therefore, wearing mask anywhere indoors (inside building) weeks pandemic hit state (NJ) state federal governments still downplaying need one. now. likely continue even every policy law matter lifted every individual business organization, municipal, county, state, federal governing body. least end 2020 possibly beyond.

I know people say ""the mask protects others, yourself"", personally believe that's true absolute statement. Even boosts protection even 0.5%, that's enough. Even effective holding piece paper front face, physically block least liquid aerosolized particles. care mathematical figure is. something. that's honestly I'm rather anyone else like especially I've never met.

I would think selfish good enough reason motivator want stay alive minimize chances whatever amount potentially contracting painful lethal illness. OC, CA. Disneyland never closes. canceled plans weekend March due virus concerns thought maybe overreacting. Disney announced closure, justified caution. agree. deep hesitate endorse paranoid side saying won’t get many things back “normal” ever reality probably closer ""The Road"". F Trump wants actively hide cases wanting less tests. Yeah get either. Unfortunately, think big issue affected lot people personally. Add smear campaign lot media running make seem like worse flu, people quite know believe want things go back normal. totally understand that, see they'd reach conclusion. However, mean pretend everything normal, ""oh would never happen me"", that's exactly happen. 

I've mentioned quite comments, way hard time sympathizing people going stir crazy I'm fairly indoorsy anyways. thing that's really changed work home can't go movies. also understand people get worked stuff that's stupid. whole thing weeks back people protesting wanted haircuts? serious? anyone selfish removed situation positively baffling grew Hollywood. aside, due smaller number veterinary schools opposed medical schools, veterinarians actually quite bit higher test scores doctors. Now, better test scores necessarily mean smarter, interesting nonetheless think dog's vet might ball doctor.

I'm advocating way, people go vet medical advice, btw. news media picks quite bit, particularly local state outlets room report daily numbers much else going on. seems mostly google finding misunderstood volume per se. feeling got broad approach like. volume annoying could compensate behaviour, harder loud. Think like shy silent girl really want date wild animal approach. Give something work something Share even laugh share exclusiv group person interact want interact let feel concentrate atm much smiling. scream beginning everybody alerted/annoyed (think like respect).

EDit: bad thing is. one like 4 major mentalities country country different so... Yeah complicated. wise decision. hope get money back least part go kids sometime over. Greece great place, warmly recommend it. That’s alotta damage Lucky bastard. You’re right, thinking limit married couples filing jointly. wait, what? even inter state travel restrictions? cupboard weren’t still empty.

I’ve spent grand PPE wife team.

Bought every N95 could find January, hospital rough go getting enough even now.

This wasn’t something expected physician source herself.

Yet are.

And fucking idiots keep packing bars, sorts unnecessary things throwing hands claiming there’s nothing done. again, world would living peace harmony US. think rather look risk hypothetical cars carry, look risk actually carry, life take is, compare absolute worst case scenario 60 percent us got it, “herd immunity threshold”

The average age someone killed car crash 38. 38 40.37 years lifespan left according actuary tables. average age someone dying Covid-19 78-81. Let’s use 79. 79, average lifespan left 8.82 however, unlike car crashes, Covid-19 typically kills co-morbidities wouldn’t typically lifespan others cohort. Conservatively, say average 79 year old died Covid-19 4 years life left average. Covid-19 death represents ten times less effect overall average lifespan typical motor vehicle accident death. threat average lifespan motor vehicle accidents, death count Covid-19 would ten times higher. isn’t likely year’s end. Even took three years get herd immunity, seems right, wouldn’t take much life Americans motor vehicle accidents. ...until Trump office. Anyway. logic we'll wearing masks indefinitely Also cant afford access world class hospitals US instead using glorified hospice centers. dont understand constitution you?

also, 4-6 weeks? high? retarded? ""imma add full fucking month actual recommended quarantine time"" sound like something reasonable human would say? sound like someone ""who science"" would say? sound like power trippy person wants control? Nice, whole ass nations petty towards one another Thank actual example! think much terribleness pandemic going die not, really seem get talked about, least yet. assume part diving community hope stay safe.  Lol that’s wild actually even thought US would well-coordinated effort  Compliance difficult part. Police couldn’t find supposed isolating home. Yeah.... think there's tiny little difference two comparisons... people unemployment making bare minimum wage begin with.  pandemic effective showing weak points nation living wage one them.  fact people complaining possible survive unemployment shows truly fucking backwards country become.  also people seem forget many unemployment lost health coverage lot extra money going towards medical expenses longer covered mention creating new medical debt things people can't afford. Lmao quit sensitive reread comments. Headline also really true. EU suggest member states. Every state makes rules. disease going? sad petition this. Disney gazillions dollars, can't see hurting staying closed post-vaccine.

Edit: read 40% revenue derived parks. Well god damn nvm. Still dangerous reopen though. Thats really fucked realize covid allows people suffer long term consequence u either die freaking live... Go way? time took write post could downloaded app could save lives. question mind is; Trump going chickens come home roost? Try putting ""777 cases diabetes"" etc, number plus ""cases"" plus 'literally medical condition' generate result. Japanese people going beyond.  America nah, rabid individualists. It’s culture sucks. Hooooooly shit Fort Worth one insane. girl yelling ""I'm gonna get bud light"" really makes it. None understand. Trump locked US you. locked US him. Lol. Huh? actually agree I'm pissed bailed megacorporations like Disney didnt need it, especially since got huge tax cut, we've done jack shit states. 

Fuck GOP supporting corporations dont pay taxes balking supporting states time national crisis. lol what... eu crappy response well. actually deaths europe north america appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* difference responses states night &amp; day tennis fine - miles away opponent outside. stay distanced, exact opposite of.  make USA shithole country?  Yeah smell came back literally two days lost it. slept almost 24 hours Sunday sweating ass AC 65 degrees. Flash forward 24 hours, I’m fine. Weird deserve this. Hopefully people don’t know believe conflicting messages wake (when sports entertainment shutdown lot people got board believing dire situation) There's way knowing sure, I'm hopeful UK still allow Americans. BoJo Trump seem like think probably want good post-Brexit trade deal. Plus UK shut borders whole thing, see would now. Given Cuomo everything else well I'm going assume NYC actually hotels (vs. DeSantis leaving everyone people shit arrived FL going straight destination nary mask). hospital. course quarentine, hospital.

Edited read thourally, sorry NYC talking that. ""Not. Yet."" What's Australia fall under? Geography definitely played big factor here. Truth. Well, sent us [this feel you. Earlier year dumbass American friend convinced meet China October. Even he's denying longevity situation. 

He'll mad cancelling, really one mad begging waste $600. suggestion:

Stop paying credit card bills. 3 months annoyed sell debt. dodge calls. life important bill.

Go walks pick cans, change find. oddly enough, get healthy find money.

Remember, pay rent, power, shop store make food home? save LOT MONEY. 

Also: work everyday. Things easy. know 100 push ups, 100 sit ups, 100 squats, 100 calf raises works whole body, makes get ripped pretty fast? also feel great working helps immune system.

Stop smoking smoke, stop drinking alcohol.

You get better day day. okay, know. quarentine. fittest ever been. credit card man calls, whatever. thing debtors prison. EU country though. Projection.

The evidence good enough SJWs. discovering new cases faster die.

Too early know batch fare. I'm Ireland government siding Ryanair issue refunds despite EU law saying do. Still waiting refund. Keep living fantasy world. rest reality moving on.


Seriously waiting for? vaccine isn’t coming anytime soon it! world needs shame us submission, people charge top dont seem fucking care definately stop letting people go Alaska. season reasonable tell get plane. problem arent flights. *No. children wrong.* guess one idiot slams line cars stop light. Took job health department right undergrad. First day job, told fax notice forty-some healthcare providers. laughed, realized boss serious, called providers collect email addresses, told ""didn't one"" would longer sending info fax wanted reimbursed, better catch up, showed everyone office use email encryption. write new job description shortly thereafter automated everything hired do.. oops yay.

HIPAA *is* serious concern needs always considered, honestly ZERO reason anyone faxing anything ever.  Yeah would lumber exactly? Lumber sandwiches lol We've shithole long coronavirus. can’t believe they’ve done laughed much harder order coming. Trump fans see mask symbol liberalism. endorsing mask publicly start admitting defeat. people literally fixated mask, perceived infringement civil liberty. never see Trump cultist say ""I choose wear mask, right"". always ""I choose wear mask, right"". reason Trump wear mask public. removing people reality completely indoctrinate them. Ahh, ya got two governor came today told people best stay home.

With laws orders go it. recommendation.

They're soft lockdown they're full steam ahead. guy idiot. downvote ignore. Right, many actually that. Also, true 14 day quarantine must include anyone living with. you’re staying home kids go play friends every day, partner goes work, it’s basically meaningless. think people think threat. many people actually know someone it? see personally. lot ""It abstract threat real."" Sort like people told need stop eating crap they'll get heart disease. Well feel anything many years later. I’m happy lawn looks good, that’s awesome!! :) Ducks, skunks, rabbits well, must live wonderful part country :) hope people lost job 3 months ago still waiting unemployment claims processed also lovely garden enjoy, aren’t stressing small things like paying rent putting food table kids :) fact, needs actual food buy quality fertilizer grow food large garden :) Yup. hypocrisy double-standards wiiiiiiiiild. hurt personally little trust Italian politicians, Prime Minister Conte really done good job. helps affiliated party. last elections Italy coalition two parties different ideologies, compromised choose someone neutral seat PM. Wait, did? Hell, know that. 

We've lucky Utah far - honestly, luckier deserve considering many people know think big deal. pandemics do. hurt everyone whether get not, die not.  history number one effective go-to strategy stop travel.  past people stopped travel village, town, city, let alone nation.  What's everyone's thoughts California? CA locked early seems long time would emerge polar opposite New York, looks like things yet control positivity rate higher NY, CT, NJ.

I wonder CA residents got complacent weeks started get relaxed. personally got many debates /r/sanfrancisco early people insisted go out. wonder good weather + love outdoors CA residents + complacency ended hitting us hard end.

I friend remind early locked \~200 cases Bay Area, cases worse ever one really acting like lockdowns matter anymore. personally went get food weekend (to go course), traffic roads bad pre-COVID. makes sense. issue vouchers knowing people probably accept without demanding refunds, keeping money leaking. really need money, legally entitled long one cancelled. worth hassle depends situation. tables turned yeah people dont understand one bit, type person talking overwhelming majority people 70%. Median US wage 31k annually. Median Rent 1500/month, 18k annually. fucking insane someone expected save 6 months expenses 13k leftover rent alone. 

Shit pandemic hit march companies profiting billions per year, begging government handouts week. cashflow WEEK expected 6 months!? fucking joke.  Can't say surprising - country ""fumbled"" COVID 19 response banned list. Why? quite like queen figurehead, shes far pure shit politicians Still understand many hospitals switched elastomeric respirators (aka: half mask full masks) CDC American College Surgeons say superior N95 everyways, especially protection logistics. clues play well.

I agree. Good point, theory, imagine would happen reality: 300 people would exit plane get tested close quarters hours (as already throughout flight). would need one infected person board risk health thousands. EU could also try pursue strategy like China, visitors self quarantine hotels two weeks matter what, allowed travel around. again, staying hotel two weeks straight even beginning travel really expensive. Man, stupid U.S.A. soul-crushing watch people revel ignorance. I'd move New Zealand heartbeat could. ""*Dr. Fauci testified — the* [*mysterious *of $3 million research grant group studying coronavirus bats Wuhan, China, outbreak originated.*

*“It canceled N.I.H. told cancel it,” Dr. Fauci said, referring National Institutes Health, without elaboration. “I don’t know reason, told cancel it.”*""

This reminds article read recently, spending preventative measures investment science sorely lacking short-sighted.

Yes ""saved"" 3 million cancelling research, already spent 3 Trillion include economic damage caused. wall doing? Natural selection; tallest Dutch pick tallest weed. success story, close borders let people winning like usa! /S find interesting cancellation effects Muslims fake tears flow comments cancellation provided joy people see compassion comments.

I simply posted thinking scared write. 

And yes, country puts lives money religion (might one same) praised action. 

Anyway, heard cancellation, glad enough toilet paper wipe tears 😭 People stay say it’s crisis actors. idiot nursing assistant small private clinic make rant video “everything you’re seeing main stream media fake”. 1000 Karens share video forth. know comment downvoted pointing legit failing Indian health system.

sorry topic sounds cool Says new york planning banning tourists states Sad part think we've got ways go ""on knees"" many states still pretending happening Glad got N99 mask travel It’s fatality rate. It’s fact europe getting control daily new cases US rising: EU countries closed borders other, kinda like states closing borders other. France travel restriction 100km home, Spain Greece Italy couldn’t move hundred meters home. fact wearing mask stop spread reapiratory virus become taboo might horrifying part timeline Abbot (to public): local leaders need make decisions
Abbot (to local leaders): can't require masks, can't enforce lockdown measures

Abbot (to local leaders): fix this! Sweden blew numbers prove it. need figure new plan get back us going. Meanwhile, rest world (except USA, Russia, Brazil) follow advice medical experts. This. Unfortunetly signed new lease year think I'll try get honestly. There's real benefits staying US anymore get good job another country IMO Oh yeah, russian bots go away Facebook 12 racist Karens might realize they're alone. Oh, stopped caring. Maybe let guard bit, New York City Detroit licked thing, never stopped caring. able relax bit catching Uber Eats guy

Sure. I'm worried people going protests political rallies. guys stop making sense. That's basic human state, healthy. proven otherwise consider ok. would anyone take medical advice crisis member Trump Administration board member Theranos? Sit down, Mad Dog. Fucking sellout. Let's blame hard working people Florida (who could given masks transported work)....let's blame people need haircuts/cheeseburgers need ""freedoms"" taken away. . That's true, seem odd. Population-adjusted, would like 10,000 cases California, 7,500 cases Texas.

They're least day two behind. We'll give days catch up. Survival ICU covid19 patients 80% earlier on. Fwiw, defence think Sweden's policy society really capable discipline/unity least prevent hospitals overrun, dodge one worst possible outcomes.

It may appropriate Texas etc, whatever tried. Europe think we've seen best option, whilst cost high, provided data could much worse. probably gets worse rap deserved, tbh.

- still think crazy countries ever tried contain disease start though, tbh. want protect economy, always seemed something worth trying for. Said thing March, Mexico going worst Italy Spain, everyone downplayed well, guess wrong. Add Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, South Carolina, etc. list.  [Have plenty evidence already large population pre-existing immunity register antibody tests. Antibodies good, memory cells important long term. precisely point think unintentionally demonstrated noted. one word stat line people twist fit narrative. Completely agree. agree burt reynolds expect see increase young people wherever protests far aren't. must factors play. He'll probably want stop slow testing prevent number confirmed cases low. Nah, Lombardi Wuhan actually locked down, Florida won't. Mohs say, hard yourself. ""good news"" flair get removed? Amidst much bad worrying news nice scroll flair get semblance hope, actually became part routine - removed?? feel like word research replacing read society also helped bring us point.  read article, says. think law filming inside ICUs due patient privacy, think anything exception. work laboratory Houston area hospital almost everyday we’re setting new record number tests run day.

You’re hero they’re still making money. China also locked HARD never went level here.

Nope. Plenty research already lockdowns barely anything, case dynamics due people voluntarily cutting back contact-intensive activities prior lockdowns. Bans large gatherings helped though. Maybe, probably reduced seating enforce masks use taking baseball game might good idea. that's moon. Unfortunately, federal Texas governments credibility seem powerless convince people wear masks, wash hands, keep distance, prohibit dangerous things like rallies, protests, movie theaters, sports events. lying ignoring experts April May lost credibility authority. people needlessly suffer die. cite literal pseudo science website. Thanks confirming statement. 

Masks mildly effective preventing wearer catching virus. wildly effective infected person preventing infected person transmitting it. even fox news much Facebook news thata fucking older generation. believe anything see Facebook dangerous Gotta keep tax payers dying give money. honestly better China

That's bit extreme, think? US problems sure, least censor media/internet, murder dissidents, send Muslims concentration camps experimented on. problems, standard living still one best world. honestly would okay least people would *wearing damn mask!* stands right KS bad shape, barely anyone wearing mask lakes, pools, bars packed lately I've seen social media. 

So I'm expecting cases start rising long. No. They're group ""douing decent."" Many build new stadiums/arenas, plus improved infrastructure around buildings. medical personnel say

Im asking prove claim. 

Im asking prove claim moving patients lead worse outcomes.

Well know obvious, youre preaching choir. wasnt obvious leaders, medical professionals, general public US. point. obvious would wearing masks, arent. told to, people stopped paying attention that. No, it’s not. Tech companies want exploit H1B visas basically indentured servants. It’s fucking disgusting.  Yeah, know stops places. look new York curve worldometer see dramatically brakes hit lockdown started, even something similar states still lead month hell. Buckle up, going scarey ride, thought thing finally late May, Early June, guess wrong. Although reading Spanish Flu caused smart part alarm bells head. Remember, SECOND wave real bad one, also third wave also. House rules. establishments businesses. Wuhan lockdown removed, second spike.

No second spike Wuhan, CCCP authoritarian conduct forced lockdowns dictatorship-like powers. 

[There growing second spike Beijing even larger city. saying ""no second spike"" naïve. According subreddit, daily cases never went begin with... say that. said anyone could tested. Recommendations absolute. Well defiant ones dont think 0.5% makes enough difference bother, selfishness reason *not* wearing Mask. hear comments actually quite selfish hypocritical think okay make health choices ppl, complaining gov't makes mask choices you. even pushing herd immunity, wants everyone ignore stonks help election, cares absolutely nothing else. anyone know good source plot current death rates US? guess would nice able see US death rates May June 2020 compared national death rates time 2019 2018. I'm sure CDC somewhere, would nice see tables kind data vs. summaries leading causes deaths certain demographics. 2.5% 17k seem like wildfire me. Average rent Baltimore $1500.

*cries Silicon Valley* live Croatia flying Germany August. expect ban? much worse, lets say mortality 1% 99*780 77 220 + 2 weeks dead lag + possibility deads undereported... could 100k daily people realize hospitals become capicity emergency apendecitis operation need bursts kills might happen Bill Tom selfish rights go bar bdubs. 

Covid might kill young, hospital beds definitely kill young emergency situation need attention asap. ignorance comment amazing. Awe inspiring.

You realize actions leadership get overloaded, right? “crazy” projections you’re talking come experts outlining would happen action taken. city 20 million people living close proximity variety vulnerabilities. 

You would rather taken extra precaution making much space possible system doesn’t collapse? brainwashed garbage listen read? moment hospitals become overwhelmed moment chaos takes over. Piles people streets. MI. Fucking morons everywhere. acknowledge people get sick, wants Texas open anyway? also legal. Right? always knew wouldn’t survive apocalypse, I’m one survivalists I’m big old baby. Turns I’m good cause I’m willing stay home wear mask.  worst part government America spin story UK evil trying impose travel ban America. 
There memes “Remember Revolution?” fake ass patriotism bloated self supremacy majority Americans frothing mouth condemn Europe don’t know difference continent country. come see ton people mentioning Abbott guy radio silence protests thousands thousands shoulder shoulder roughly two weeks ago? Honestly it’s probably combination lack awareness protests contribution spike astounding know healthy? multiple tests antibody test too? ignorant sake ignorant. Yes absoluty. refering causes deaths accept every year. Maybe focus put pandemic. Thus saving lives. good. “Forty percent asymptomatic individuals became seronegative”. expecting. Already surprise first paragraph! mean reinfection risk? Oh boy, come back post happens vulnerable family, ok? bigger problem people incorrectly wearing masks. see many customers come wearing masks nose they're adjusting constantly.

We pretty consistent 120-135 / day range. Last several days 300 range. starting increase here. I'm still stay home gang.. really since March. leave run errands twice week thats agree. calling pet names end. Depends fast production ramped up, who's making it, likely populace take vaccine. 100 years ago Spanish flu lot deadly. also didn’t medical technology help treat virus prevent virus like today. Times changed. call weeks ago ""MD State Govt"".

I going answer, office phone. 

They leave voicemail, call back. So, contact tracing leave voicemail asking call back. protests areas spikes? MK Ultra, support Iran Shah, mean play game, US better morally, stop thinking this.

All say true, horrible must change, copy US all. I'm seething Xi dared quote Guantanamo inspiration Xinjiang, we've telling US forever. Stop.doing.the.opposite.of.your.virtue.signaling. Sorry, mean 1 million people. metric case density per population. Also ICU nowhere near capacity. Article says 1200 beds use, 2800 would ""warning threshold"". 

Math never white liberals' thing. Don’t forget Arizona! Ducey moron lasting effects even get hit hard initial illness caused virus. effects well studied may cause issues line, like permanent lung damage finding COVID survivors. 

My dad's best friend, healthy guy around 60, tested positive early March barely issue. mild flu like symptoms shortness breath, nothing severe. now, exhausted constantly, permanent lung changes, one kidneys operating 30% normal functionality (they suspect blood clot artery supplying kidney). looks like corpse lost 20 lbs 2 weeks. attributing lasting effects COVID.

Even high risk group, virus avoided. Warrior monk (his preferred nickname). He’s well read intelligent, sure that’s surprise.

 He's also literal scam artist involved Theranos Yep. People finally realizing can't hide things. Let infect everyone. Whoever left clean move life. like every single new virus humanity ever encountered. alternative entire world shuts month. Nothing happens. Period. going work.  complete fucking idiot would think virus go away, like Sorry, mean 1 million people. metric case density per population. middle? think beginning steep hill, leadership starts taking seriously, stop.

2 million dead incoming... Lol Yes. honestly educated enough healthcare economics discuss virtues private vs public hospitals leave experts, regardless, could’ve avoided first lockdown taken seriously. Elective surgeries many cases still lifesaving still major consequences quality life. Shutting heartbreaking. mean deaths starting increase again? Also problem going deaths lagging indicator. seem care stuff anyways want spew MAGA bullshit. misleading and, frankly, stupid comparison.

A bank bailout ""gets paid back"" goes well, involves lending banks would otherwise creditworthy. federal government, damn taxpayer, pricing immense risk zero, lending well-connected privileged interest rates could never access, hoping best. That's corruption.

Paying people's rent, true, expenditure; artificially low interest loans businesses fucked hard, handshake promise they're truly sorry again.

Anyway, ton people get rents mortgages paid free discernible reason— they're called rich people, live interest capital. rent bailout merely extends advantage people, people actually things lives (unlike rich parasites) therefore deserve more. That's actually possible point. like looking ""excess death"" data. basically compares weekly/ monthly death last years given period time compare overall death numbers year.

So example let's say normal month April, 8000 people die NYC (I'm pulling numbers random I'm cellphone xD) well, April 2020, 8000 people died corona killed people supposed die anyway. let's say 10 000 people died april, safely guess virus affecting people's lifespan OK Well like they're forcing people test subjects. are, yes, legit gripe. live West Palm Beach, Florida. We’ll give competition. Californian, okay too. ...and many tests?

...and positivity rate?

...and hospitalizations?

....and ICU hospitalizations?

....and hospital/ICU bed usage rate *relative normal*?

....and death rate?

No context = meaningless headline live Ohio feel same. health director stepped awesome job people came house protesting. Shes got like 5 kids sign shit. really sad.

But thought v shaped recovery??? Yeah. sure claim but...

2018 also saw same[ Chinese vaccine distribute defective rabies vaccines mixing fluids different, cases expired, batches falsifying production dates.

In 2016 300 [people implicated spoiled vaccine 2010 [a woman](http://english.anhuinews.com/system/2016/03/21/007269842.shtml) sold 88 million worth refrigerated vaccines 24 different provinces.

And 2008 melamine-in-the milk scandal... vaccine related. Germany flew small number patients EU countries. shitty medevac, fixed-wing aircraft mobile ICU. France Italy quickly learned shift patients specially re-equipped train country.

All operations highly succesful.

Sweden incompetent. Fake news. Danes still allowed travel Sweden. consider alternative, rebels. assume referring supporters current pres. see lone wolf fighting ""establishment"" includes science authorities. states lulled hubris becuase, frankly, major desirable tourism spots.

The coolest parts America non-Americans think visiting got hit first: NYC, SoCal, Bay Area, Seattle (huge Asian immigrant population). Immediately that, domestic tourism spots got hit: Nashville, NoLa Mardis Gras, Florida spring break.

Then sorta shut things cooled hot spots LEARNED. parts US early ""cool places"" wave realize hit critical spread mass yet, thought somehow special.

They special, attracting lot town guests. means takes longer stage hit. protection stage. Surely European cities look travel ban get grip this, Trump first one months ago banning flights assume definitely spread protests opening early seems playing much bigger factor protests many *alleged* deaths? Czech. We've mandatory facemasks several months. sucked big time here, would suck us Almost 20% positivity too, desantis shook Yeah wish Greg Abbott followed cuomos lead forced nursing homes take positive COVID patients Ah ok thanks clearing up. impression oxford vaccine along nature adenovirus effective old-school deactivated virus Excellent analysis! 

One worrying thing re: Sweden's death curve looks like may increasing based projection: Let's hope not, though. surprised Tegnell reply ""No never lockdown first place, like us! matter we'll number deaths end..."" /s

I know, shocking. narrative. ""thinks"" lockdown would ""very big consequences"". urges ""try number things first."" without saying ""other things"" that, apparently, ""very big consequences"".

Always going gut feelings one. lot data COVID lockdowns seems quite unaware growing body evidence. best cheese people *also* die hospitals run beds elective surgeries non-sick people catch COVID hospital. confusing read notes Yeah, don’t need worry covid. ignore completely. Darwin’s law action. Brace yer selfs! anticipate Arizona hospitals collectively surpassing 100% capacity? long estimation would take? Never tell odds. like ""a merry sex-it"" better. Okay, service businesses close. fact people still gonna going work spreading virus around? coronaviruses. rhinoviruses, hundreds. fair, might also executed warning citizens. Image half places like China. like driving drunk wearing seatbelt, likely hurt others yourself.  Good thing one that! Also one said shouldn’t socially distance. Nice You’re island. share land border. hope don’t evolve avian transmission. internal hemorrhaging high positivity rate mean assume it. want people assuming antibodies... means testing enough, people severe symptoms getting tested. 

If tested random sample population, positivity rate would much lower. would be, except medical power much much higher now. Interestingly, SickKids [not recommending masks school setting younger kids](http://www.sickkids.ca/PDFs/About-SickKids/81407-COVID19-Recommendations-for-School-Reopening-SickKids.pdf).

Yup. pandemic, failing properly lockdown end first wave, going recasting effect years Yeah, much understand that's true, baffled attitude. well known often, least corner US, people traveling internationally. time. saw bad getting China back Jan/Feb wondering: *so yet*? *why checking everyone?*

Months later, news *finally* reported COVID must spreading around weeks first found Washington state. like ""oh duh, finally makes sense"", ""oh wow really""? People acting everywhere “ Americans, far, excluded, according draft lists seen New York Times.” Well leave basement tendies probably need mask. Maybe nationalize them? It’s weird they’re business service anyway. Whoop Whoop Coronavirus Yaaaaay wtf wrong photo wait 4th July starts showing. upvote ""hair did"".

Pick one Cuz, know we're testing more. Death rate falling. That's real headline. Right you. got preparation mode late January, everyone thought isolated virus China - “there’s like 600 cases China”... “you’re overreacting”, said. Check post history asked buying mask - useful people directed buy, good chunk claimed wasn’t worth it. 

People underestimated fast coronavirus spread right conditions. Don’t think majority people make mistake going put lot people don’t know, ICUs often run near capacity even without pandemic. think national average 87%-92% full. Yes getting lot cases, arguing severity disease putting there. read book years ago explaining water shortages lead many conflicts Africa people would move neighboring territories find potable water encroach upon land belong them. scarcity natural resources driving force conflict. wish could remember name book could reread brush it.

Fuck governor. businesses didn’t close lockdown either service industry still wrecked Yeah, let's check one month. bet little new cases Beijing. Make masks mandatory, issue $200 fines first offense, $1000 second. I’m appalled (but surprised) fucking stupid selfish many us are. powerful AC units kill virus indoors! heard word? you’re afraid getting COVID stay house. USA #1!!! AMERICA FUCK YEAH! Yeah.

You're preaching choir here. know. going get ugly. 5500 27,600 tests I'm reading state data dashboard correctly. wildly intense increase considering last Wednesday 2600 24k tests.

My state fucked. People give Mattis amount credit morons. Even ignoring history Trump, guy fucking war criminal. Yeah unfortunately opening windows gonna happen allergies. can't even open *in winter* without problems. yup, scary part. numbers horrifying learned early today''s numbers determined behavior 10-14 days ago.

Fuck. help Houston unhealthiest city country. say Denver Seattle bad. Americans understand exponential growth, especially short time scales. Nearly everyone intuition something increases quickly MUST slow quickly balance out. Kinda like gamblers fallacy.

You're going see 1120ish new hospitalizations per day within couple weeks. people STILL gut feeling suddenly stop gp away. infuriating. March schools closed city began locking down. see? Tons tons people outside groups mask seen. acting like separate world. Common sense present. save themselves. trying harm majority saving small portion. much doubt 5% population anti-vax

Hell, I'd suprised even 5% Thank detailed answer, hope take proper precaution time needed develop get job done ensure safety. I'd rather wait little longer help put end virus keeping people safe, compared alternative ending virus side effects result that. Deaths lag hospitilizations week two.

Sadly, reality live in. states month reopening scares much new wave Texas. disease much slower moving people anticipated, since things go hell first weeks reopening, everyone decided let guard down. 100k north texas town Wichita Falls bars restaurants opened back full capacity time Houston Dallas everyone else state seemed stop caring social distancing, even we're seeing huge record breaking spikes every single day. Since we've allowed thing go around think we're starting see beginning huge spike next weeks. social distancing mask wearing worked, shame took month things begin spiking everyone went mindset maybe things bad, reality they're even worse expected.

No info long last however. Woah terrible. oxygen horrible way die. running around like maniac I'd say day fine people - also *only* use goats milk soap hair, I've never really scalp issues. course, everyone different issues :)

Might shampoo using - fact usually pretty humid am. Yeah Southwest PA going spike soon. one wearing masks (unless forced stores) laughing social distancing. lots protests San Diego numbers risen nothing like Los Angeles also protests. 

Overall, seen articles saying protests major driving factor increase cases surprising Yeah. mean, general idea trying convey probably accurate, deadly viruses tend mutate time contagious less deadly simply matter evolutionary pressure. are, course, exceptions (looking rabies) viruses run sort path. Neither murder. [kill 45 people, point. Lol, even click link? [Or say, going grill people wearing masks... least mention eye protection would nice. Wearing mask leaving eyes exposed like leaving front door wide open, locking it. Expand please? Hell, wife medical field flip-flopped. first masks won’t stop virus. it’s everyone wear mask slow droplets traveling far. I’ve worked US 33 years four different industries. I’ve sick pay offered 18 months working life. CDC reports death rate average 0.26%. Thats good news. matter doom gloom sub tries spin it. SARS vaccine funding died, also, SARS gone, can't move beyond Phase 1 anyways

Some diseases list come parasites, others like HIV persistent infections difficult develop for

Conceded vaccine RSV.

But, reason can't develop vaccine SARS-CoV-2 businesses. Bars restaurants sure. retail. non essential businesses still delivery pick up. state never really shut anything sans dine in. People keep going work, people keep shopping, unless goverment closes businesses people keep going work spreading virus coworkers True false: rabies vaccine used treat rabies infection. Clint Diddler going new band name. regular Flu causes overloads hospitals: Golf made 11 days positive COVID-19 test. u're 65 chances great. Tried lose weight. actually logical conclusion based already well-known fact. Androgens known lower immune system decades. That's part women live longer.  Kansas anymore, that’s sure. I'm sarcastic testing good thing we’re still identifying cases. Even it’s kid “sniffles”, even kid totally fine, he’s still infectious needs quarantined it’s virus could easily kill grandparents, potentially kill anyone. reason scale back testing we’re seeing positive cases anymore, obviously case. Testing double edged sword. “It tells cases” “you find cases are” side sword. Knowing cases much better ignorant fact infected people walking around spreading disease.

At laboratory continuing test people, also seeing increase positive rate well. Meaning, we’re seeing positive results due increased testing. percentage positive results increasing well. potentially testing even people now, less. Even increased testing, may missing cases ever. virus spreading. individual positive person needs identified stop spreading people. Reducing testing answer. politicians brought us, too. they'd brought themselves, country would celebratory barbecue. Watching past weeks seniors. Looks important lot work, unreadable iPad.  There’s way make lines instead paragraphs don’t remember how. problem I'm right tourists interest visiting Europe economy first morons news. trip planned Europe end August (rescheduled May) I've everything power prevent spread. Hand washing more, masks everywhere public.. Needless say incompetent boobs controlling country make suck everybody. Venn diagram people yelling freedom wear mask people care Europe two circles 1.6km apart.  cute American tourist important lot places. Greed always wins. See Spain supper 2021 Could purely political move China show populace: ""Don't worry, we're clean everything protect filthy European products"" Yeah live central mass, pretty scary while. made worse whenever went phone break stress would see tRump. due respect, feels bit like matching facts occasion. mean, protests really cause flare-ups would occur everywhere, including New York Minnesota, see increases there.

I also worried protests fuel COVID, fact affected states southern states coincidence. told ""muh freedom"" American powers would stop virus! Seriously want pictures videos people dying I'm faces assholes going back daily life acting like mask wearing crime sign weakness. way people ever understand cost actions shoved faces. General consensus Mayo Clinic, Mass General, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins best medical centers Well know area mine requiring covid tests masks medical visits. 

Between controlling visitors PPE, probably safer Wal Mart, TBH. Time indoor rally Houston!!!! question applies USA since saw bad Italy. hell Americans think they're doing? advanced notice still fucked see firsthand virus do, wise wear mask. saw many ambulances month March, day night. Vote though? barrel’s bottom rotted scraped over.

We must always choose lesser evils evil survives parties selection. 

The best is:
Trump(R) vs. Bidden(D)

That’s best put up?
Yea, we’re fucked. says “normal” capacity. Sounds like cure. Talk couple months...

Imagine: could success story. Completely take care virus. time World, money brains.

Instead... are. Good luck. need it. Massive strong sanctions biggest type, sad Lowest wednesday number since march 25th. sure make though. Average rent Baltimore $1500. $1200 stimulus would barely entirely cover rent lot people work. money would spending Amazon purchases? surge plans convert non-ICU beds ICU beds. surge capacity passed, ambulances rerouted hospitals available ICU beds. ICU beds, patient would stay non-ICU bed. Australia also like average, base occupancy.  Wow useless bot. Every discussion rooted politics. Wall Street don’t care peasants “jobs.” Imagine watching China Italy Seattle New York get absolutely fucked virus months later situation. preventable good measures. There’s gotta way hold charge accountable this... USA way ethnically diverse EU therefore EUs Travel ban Racist, Xenophobic denounced Ireland long tax dodge gateway European business. disgrace tax revenues whole EU billions them. Wow surprising. Australia kinda second wave since first almost completely died Agreed. video done CNN trash point stupid idea holding mass gatherings due Trump's rally, should. retarded POTUS peolle this. watching it, honest, shit could said BLM's protests everywhere. one dares say cowards. Science care politics. BLMers keeps thinking like feel special. Biology care. 

But say that, Feelers come full force brain short circuits. fact downvoted stating essentially repeating 1918 since are, people putting hand sand behaving like science thing inconvenient reason, USA poorly. real? [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/XRVFD) endless waves illegal immigrants coming Med?  wanted travel world over. Please don’t blame us ones charge. Freedumbs Woah woah I'm stationed EU wish travel break. Come on. reprogram hundreds years basic routine overnight lol. You’re fighting basic parts human. Redemsivir dexamethasone showing help. patient still die even though received 4-5 doses it, though. Sad lie protesting wouldnt cause spread virus ?

You guys gone insane, masks outdoors PRECAUTIONS , foolproof.

Face reality ,mass gatherings atleast part causing second wave 


That protestors fault. USA also important universities, companies, politicians world since 1960 Sure, still... 🤷‍♀️ find way eat mask? 3 months late billion dollars short. disney fb forum (a throwback went years ago) everyone whining mask policies, reservations changed, etc.. disney fans seem care want mickey want now. :P  important keep balanced outlook. virus behaves according nature understand adapt.

And people amazing things mitigate disease mitigate risks.

Who knows, misery might come new outlook what's important society. mean could Russian territory, would much worse remember okay touch something might virus long touch face (eyes nose mouth) washing hands thoroughly.

If going eat food recommend actually washing hands first think safer hand sanitizer ( bathrooms look sketch know)

Use paper towel piece open bathroom door touch anything way directly.

If sanitizing home, cleaning agent needs look visibly wet surface minute wipe up.

This called ""dwell time"" important making sure virus killed many vaccine scandals China last 15 years. infraction rate per 100.000 people much lower China USA....you didn’t read article you? Jesus Christ LPN Florida hard enough earning $15/hr unions place patients variation Florida (Wo)Man. 


Being nurse state vulnerable, brainwashed population incompetent, presidential dick sucking/asshole devouring, punchable face governor shitty Micheal Jackson cosplay midst fucking pandemic killing figuratively literally confirmed cases I've exposed to. US hung every confederate general, officer, politician occupied South least 80 years. Reconstruction short. Government response poor, American people really let Dow Fun fact: Honduras great country travel.

Also I’m sure nobody EU missing fat ass either They're figuring out? Yep. It’s really bad here. Hospitals full, running test supplies, testing results delayed 7-8 days, many people still wearing masks. Narrator too: A*nd came hurricanes.* Oh, I'm implying people go hospital. someone gets discharged, think can't go back they've already seen. get discharged start feeling worse, go back, means. even _fucking Vladimir Putin_ acknowledging coronavirus ia problem they're spending resources fighting it, Trump They’re drive-thru testing. never get car. indefinitely mean forever, means end bot yet defined Massachusetts crushing Covid. entire US dumb, it. Yes, expected that. wife covid mid-Feb. still can't breathe properly sense smell recovered. barely hour around-the-house work without take long break recover stamina. 

It infuriating watching people spew bullshit this. That's apathy cowardice. 

You could take back, willing would take. except walmart traffic spread entire week, one surrounded people shoulder shoulder hours. UK here. week commented nice able meet friends give hug. got reply someone Texas:

*Idk Texas it’s like month now.*

*Everyone half assed wearing masks work going motions satisfy corporate policy.*

After reading thought maybe cautious. quickly realised reading comment arrogant American thinks ignore away American, right freedom, better everyone everything, country worth mentioning world. Basically people seem think beaten gone.

Between ignorance, superiority complex, refusal anything act everything fine, corrupt states trying mask truth, honestly think heading disaster. would *anything* mask mandate. Exposing mask sick person without one 75% transmission possibility. fucking awful, brutally stupid, soulcrushingly depressing.

I *literally* want planet anymore trying explain family ask what's going difficult. guarantee people aren’t going scream racist like way around. person annual pass Disneyland Anaheim, I’m bummed they’re planning opening next month. It’s safe go, currently they’re allowing us pause passes cancel remainder passes get refunds. park opens up, passes start ticking again. paid thousands dollars signature passes, they’ve essentially downgraded flex passes (requiring reservations), half things bought passes (parades, nighttime spectaculars, character meet greets) cancelled. know they’re losing money, opening right screws annual pass holders, kill guests, cast members, people surrounding neighborhoods. It’s irresponsible. Won’t happen unless it’s turned law fines attached complying. app solution makes much sense. really need implemented ASAP. I'm home w/ family, living 2 elderly people least one at-risk parent. also younger sibling hanging friends throughout this, actually socially distancing whatnot. things back open I'm one 3 states things actually quite well opposed start.

Now people acting like COVID magically disappeared, he's going sharing rides cars straight-up going gatherings/parties, claim outdoor, knows he's telling truth / even so, there's still risk there's drinking etc.

My parents frustrated seems I'm one truly annoyed know do. I'm scared course mainly multiple people house risk, yet seem care them. voice frustration sibling really whatever want walks they've seemingly given think think things ok again.

I know much actually I'm loss. Basically pray one comes contact gets it.. what, poutine? federal government doesnt control election all. states do. Florida's considered major swing state even though almost always vote red. Why? we're gerrymandered fuck here. 


Not mention rampant voter suppression. election got Dipshit DeSantis also gave right vote back non-violent felons who've finished sentence, includes hundreds thousands black Americans. drugs. 99.97% love one rules going introduce picking merchandise unless plan buying it. I'm sure work great kids hyped sugar disney let loose gift shops. reddit users like 13 Merkel Biden, attracting negative attention carrying big donors' bidding Sent, yes. Used, no. Well yes. got shit control.

Not democratically, do. Remember school shutting March. Sweden let school stay open that's everything. forced children Italy go school too, said go home feel sick. unfortunately, politicians care. Yes, read later. Viktor Troicki's wife too. daughter Novak's kids still negative. Spoiler Alert: going continue. much doubt US part EU! probably pull anyway! Uhm yeah, corona related response, thanks correction! protest would done that, hence got get fucking racism way ASAP. Use covidly. say.

As death rate per capita... US much larger population. worry, get there! Using snowflake ironically?  time populated area America open wide up. northeast I95 corridor. 80 million people. 

Jersey city new jersey friday night.  K-12 schooling probably toughest choice country need make. Sadly feds sitting one well.
T 
We aggressively collecting data much children actually spread this. Data countries mixed.
T 
If kids transmission vectors serious trouble fall, spread disease among classmate go home infect parents/grandparents. if, unique reason, kids efficient spreaders, lots good things happen.

Without strong scientific guidance, looks perhaps biggest shitshow all.
- Parents need day care schools provide
- Remote schooling efficient person schooling due lack tech investments schools
- happens kids show sniffles, runny noses, fevers vomiting, happens daily basis?
- happens kids teachers test positive?
- can’t handle peanut butter schools allergies, translate Coronavirus
- kids required wear masks? enforce many parents fight it?
- school athletics?
- paying extra things required school budgets pressure?

I envy school administrators year.  Looks like going Tariff instead. knows Ukraine is, Schiff told impeachment Hard run business employees customers hospital. talking following recommended reopening rules 1st: Wait couple months talk again

2nd: jack shit control, virus spreading like wildfire everywhere except Hawai, frozen wastes North, new England.

We want plague rats, thank much. Keep red hat enjoy FREE!!! Get rid Trump let yall back! state? Houston, we've got problem Mask mandates minimally disruptive. certainly much less disruptive outbreak severe mitigation measures outbreak require. already extensive knowledge examples places dawdled matters paying price. would want join ignominious bunch? time *before* numbers get bad. Good, idk took long tbh grow start paying taxes knowledge Houston, we've got problem surprise land

of batista zionist

mausoleum cultists

they want everybody die Even better, it’s time bring NBA teams Orlando start playing games!! No.

The UK overruled science economy.

We've finished ""daily briefings"" Gov want reporters asking many questions Scientists. Aw man, username make sense  Nah. friend. Similar yes, same.

Florida Texas beaches lakes. Arizona scorched asshole Earth much hotter Phoenix last weeks Houston Miami. plans would watch. It’s late. Harvard already ran numbers concluded reopening won’t save economy. damage done reopening actually hurts even needless deaths. economy fucked moment country woefully prepared kind pandemic contributed staying open. Countries never shut economies crashed entire world affected rely goods trade. lived NYC hurricane Irene Sandy.

People got stocked prepared Irene damage anticipated.

So cut next year Sandy came, many people take seriously cause Irene ""live hype"". 

As know, Sandy much, much devastating NYC NJ.

I feel like sort similar thing now... ""first wave"" bad (BECAUSE locked down) people convinced they're clear ""second wave"" talk hyperbole. European: Good. 

Especially since Trump declared us cesspool bile waste blocked entry Italy got first hundred cases. comes around, goes around. whole idea slow transmission overwhelm healthcare resources. Americans tools little will. like children stomping feet denial facts. get embrace consequences choices. It’s likely get ugly. Stay safe there. Well, least protecting yourself. Sorry hear, man. add qualifier, 90% full Covid patients...it looks like thY number 26% fwiw blame 'em. mean, going try course realize isn’t really possible it’s part guidelines re-opening try best. Ew. Money far disgusting thing ever. People put socks, tiddies, drawers, handled everyone sun. live northern Michigan.

The number license plates I'm seeing Texas Texans still vacationing insane.

We way much travel going on, particularly states like Texas. Honestly, shut nationwide, going turn total catastrophe.

We can't trusted inch back. second wave /s Alaska travel proof negative Covid-19 status last 72 hours, tested site subject 14 day quarantine. this... huge?  Hopefully younger patients must get full recovery. ""research"" devalued suit standards. Instead objective term referring scientific study, means ""Google conspiracy website saw 5 yesterday drunk GeT FaCtS"".

 


""Research"" means ""listen me"" alternative wrong. call power derived proud ignorance. Would take Washington state? :P selfish, plain simple  anything remind people one little virus could infect 60 percent chickens cows fish cabbage earth, unless learn wear mask social distance, unlikely chickens dull creatures cows think four stomachs fish brained well least cabbage knows social distance Obviously Trump’s scandalous attempt make testing stop look like less positive tests. disgusting. WAY, protests get 1 person infected. reddit told so. recoveries reasonably high, idk people recovering states stat padding. Telangana refuses test keeps boasting numbers. build beds duh bruh, half country even gotten fucking stimulus check issued FUCKING APRIL. America, hard work necessarily pay off. Especially Person Color. Plus, moratorium ends, we'll still midst covid. homeless service system woefully unable manage *current* homeless population, much less massive influx. going shit show. notice US flair, sorry. love Netherlands reason seat belt laws, bike motorcycle helmet laws, speed limits, cellphone driving laws, intoxicated driving laws, many laws serve purpose helping less mentally endowed citizens stay alive. mask law pandemic would another one. honestly think toxic US work culture work even sick plays role. remember told senior attorney prior job thing sick day you’re hospital. It’s drilled people long sit you’re really sick excuses participating people ignore symptoms.

Doesn’t excuse, may help explain. Thanks part lack federal guidance, t’s whole country. 

Illinois locked early mask order low group size rules. outdoor restaurants bars allowed open.

Yes people dying it’s lot fewer peak hospital, ICU vent capacity numbers good across state.

It remains seen happens next phase Pritzker seems making best decisions can, based science economics whining. Hehe, almost word word general response this.

I've done ""research"" trying find decent sub €150 monitor de people whatever bullshit spouting. 

I think good rule thumb research this: piped directly social media feed, propaganda. think misread that, least I’ve looking stat sheet can’t see it. 

It says base capacity hospitals able expand capacity times crisis. cares? stock market up, right? (/s needed). Y'all, I'm bit freaked out.

I work domestic violence shelter started back March gung-ho sanitizing cleaning, serving clients, recently feel complacent.

This past weekend, one clients got admitted hospital non-covid related situation beds taken except ICU, keep sickest covid patients. 

They put bed ICU, long story short signed AMA reasons.

So, management doesnt seemed wigged high risk exposure. remind every time see wear mask. still going around clients without wearing mask.

I asked supervisor potential quarantine told ""we know actually exposed cant single make stay room"" ""she showing symptoms already normal her"". COPD heavy smoker always lot coughing.

Had happened first going on, would treated lot seriously.

If someone hospital protocol experience could weigh in, risk exposed covid ICU? wondering going see Virus mutate towards less deadly virulent. Yes. YES!!! Ahh that’s wanted imply, yes agree 95% poverty systemic nature poverty trap makes eoconomic mobility basically impossible. 

I’ve seen lots acquaintances make dumb purchases Amazon “they aren’t paying gas going club”. hoping people don’t spend spend save money given opportunity. Legal marijuana wouldn’t hurt either. Maybe would help people chill stop arguing! get it. facility big built largest construction project state history one big expansion second biggest state history. amazed Texas one factor 5 larger, crazy. one sticky posts corona virus,we discussing vaccine....once put,approved,trial runs etc....it well year average person able get it.

 serious matter,most well educated topic ,and even badics, people dying lifelong health issues this. I'm scared,I'm concerned,I'm supposed report work September school district 14,000 students. 

Our schools overcrowded,understaffed,do proper ventilation ,etc....and see work,or safe anyone.our world serious danger pray daily things change better real soon. Richmond ZZQ, come along.  forget, July 4th coming up! cities shutting then, 4th July parties surly finish job. might hard border cities though, maybe restriction say can't travel 100 miles home. Thank showing world it. happy you. Enjoy freedom, valuable. seen friends 3 months --
Imagine worst country world coronavirus deaths spread using billions allocated funds help better understand track 🤦🏼‍♂️

We're already seeing obvious botched US response coronavirus pissed away advanced notice affected Italy good portion us still can't understand can't bothered pandemic still ongoing ""Was woman."" Hey, 2020. Start roll punches without regard sex gender. 
Imagine worst country world coronavirus deaths spread using billions allocated funds help better understand track 🤦🏼‍♂️

We're already seeing obvious botched US response coronavirus pissed away advanced notice affected Italy good portion us still can't understand can't bothered pandemic still ongoing blame them. President disgrace. political system seems want hate regardless many people kills ridiculous. good would  banded together, encouraged mask wearing worn one set good example. Americans adamant told do? FFS ain’t rocket science. Aus. PM favourite done good job. Shut us pretty quick. still can’t travel states. stayed inside March till June. 7600 cases whole country!!! 103 deaths. starting open need careful. hope offending you. love America. One favourite places visit won’t coming back long time. sad Trump ducked badly. Google 120,000 employees worldwide - 70,000 headquarters. 
Apple 137,000 employees. 

The Dublin numbers nowhere near headquarter size. Wal-Mart Australia, little COVID 19 103 deaths Australia joke. above. way worse 1968 pandemic though right? I’m expert fact killed million people worldwide global lockdown makes seem much less severe one. happen good source that? mean dad CEO Maren Explain masks impede freedom  Could link source continue follow it? least Biden stop breaking shit. Idk, would vote guy punching face guy punch face? think smell made of? I'm going downvote you, Native Americans Black Americans would disagree you. Enduring genocide enslavement systemic discrimination continuously destroys communities families ranks pretty highly list ""serious shit."" Literally one mentions thousands people protesting everyday. Put head deeper sand please. 

Also, EU ban Sweden nothing stop spread purpose going target US? Or.... protest pandemic? said got hit US, well coordinated federal effort stamp out.

You joking right?  mention corruption. Like India, corruption grassroot level. ration shop owners dupe often illiterate poor people. fully starve, cheated full amount that's owed them. “But summer heat take care it.” 


-eye roll- Houston too. It’s refreshing also depressing see difference reddit comments vs comments I’m seeing local news threads Facebook. many entitled idiots insist wearing mask stupid reason xy z. Even give actual factual evidence based research still ignore won’t stfu run calling anyone two brain cells sheep RIGHTS RIGHTS CANT WEAR MASK YOURE SCARED STAY HOME. can’t anymore. really screwed Tx. 

One guy even arguing hospital policies saying I’m lying wearing mask day hospital. Like. would argue told do? Literally major hospitals city enforcing masks second walk in. much dumb gave up. I’m reading everything reddit staying away local Facebook idiots.  mean Trump already pissed due ban H1-B visas. thinks former bartender become SWE overnight administration fucking clueless.   sad thing uninformed people COVID-19. listened portion syndicated radio show yesterday one callers saying overblown thing certain facts reported. host kept agreeing caller fit ideas host saying. uninformed people probably dangerous actual virus won’t take precautions stop spread. I’d take rural America house payments Silicon Valley salary heartbeat. 

But. 

Is thing rural county votes blue? 100% compliance American people wearing facemasks, continue spike. remember, schools open (at least here) five weeks so. might worst Human trade deal history Human trades... Meybe ever... take propecia (a DHT prohibitor) hair loss. wonder that’s holds secondary effectiveness regard COVID. We're walking road we've seen before, everyone rose tinted glasses on. There's still time stop train final destination, one's really hit brake yet. truly hope (our) fears unfounded, I'd give least 50% odds refuses step gracefully, one way another.  Freedom make unsafe choices fun games until, instance, drunk driver kills child. I’m affects people.  Rock Casbah think whatever parts want hear listen to. ignore rest helps given talking point deflect others with. bother thinking effects society long run. move Iceland, New Zealand Taiwan. see trump moron. see people gathering place wearing masks parties. leaders fight work together. infighting pathetic parties fault.

Yes trump twit. That’s optimistic. country cares white kids. Try today tomorrow pullout game good 'wives'. Politics reason science. afraid majority got something life vs death, like pandemic. now. 

The USA turning joke. Covid Cases prove it. Heard that. Hopefully, nobody hurt. kinda surprised. Like everyone continuing normal lives thinking everything perfect fine. Like Georgia worse. feel like don’t acknowledge COVID factor making important decisions business school reopening. I'm skeptical claims hospitals reporting numbers, important point since tens thousands less apparently severe cases regardless whether hospital press releases horseshit. 

I'd like see compilation variety damages victims popped keep getting called ""mild"" ""asymptomatic"" cases feature prominent respiratory effects. Causation established these, let's start with:

* clotting leading cardiovascular issues

* neurological damage

* loss smell/taste

* diabetes

* inflammatory disease

Not even counting lung damage ""mild"" respiratory cases ""less sick"" (they recover without vent).

I've seen stuff come /r/COVID19 makes wonder virus *can't* do. 

I think lot people think mass spread among 20- 30-somethings biggie mortality rate low genuinely think victims suffer consequences, could long term. Free money last forever, even long would take lockdown eliminate covid. reminder. Someone making real income getting taxed get free money, they're that, they're keeping virus alive waiting eventually emerge hiding. ICU beds expensive maintain often 60 70 percent full normal times. order preserve testing resources, many developers interested performing testing using technique “pooling” samples. technique allows lab mix several samples together “batch” pooled sample test pooled sample diagnostic test. example, four samples may tested together, using resources needed single test. pooled sample negative, deduced patients negative. pooled sample comes back positive, sample needs tested individually find positive. samples pooled together, ultimately fewer tests run overall, meaning fewer testing supplies used, results returned patients quickly cases. However, samples diluted, could result less viral genetic material available detect, greater likelihood false negative results, particularly properly validated. method works well low prevalence cases, meaning negative results expected. Given testing asymptomatic individuals means testing greater volume patients, low prevalence may likely asymptomatic population, particularly population low risk contracting COVID-19, developers may interested using pooling techniques tests used asymptomatic screening. would good news! Never thought y'all fucked up. needed wait hit peak saw cases go down, flattening curve prolongs wave, I'm Quebec, epicentre Canada, bad awhile hit peak started seeing slowly go opened month spikes. virus , matter really (unless hardcore lockdown way advance) similar pattern (Farr curve). half ass lockdowns harm good. Opening nearly impossible way. 

I feel there's way many people hear suggesting y'all stayed lockdown, that's stupid , without spread virus community , get what's happening happen (unless again, lockdown way early half assed) California included? seeing record spikes well. exempt due number people NY travel states? God didn’t create us wear polyester, AC, use glasses contacts. You’re allowed sit sweaty room house wearing linen cotton kaftans, squinting cause can’t see shit want Connie, things *doesn’t effect people*. Shit, read like monologue movie shit hits fan..... helps thath homebody, usually never leave house much. ""We way cosmos know itself""

-- Carl Sagan VA, ""mandated"" masks. Lots people listening bc enforced. USexit hear that? scientific sources? Time call one floating hospitals sent NYC LA Spanish Flu occurred television, mass media modern medicine. also way dangerous thing Covid. Spanish Flu ton people farmers ranchers could feed themselves, clothe themselves, etc. without entering cities. That's case now. Darn medical providers saying ""cancer"" bs like that.

^^^\s protest, rent hotel room, travel new city, go grocery store, etc. walk outside mask go home. running marathon, esp NYC marathon, many people traveling NYC, booking hotels airbnbs, taking cars, eating out, etc. take much sense realize looking 2 different use cases. People need understand governor mandate masks places business held fully accountable deaths Americans. every age group.

You fail understand math, like grandparents. last years, laughing stock world. object pity, deemed dangerous allowed Europe. -Levar Burton Yeah does. state emergency government prevent people going outside, even protest. problem politician wants labeled racist shutting protests. One analogy going around pants analogy.
If pee pants, it'll get maybe much compared wearing any.

 I'm wearing pants (properly) pee you, really way get regardless whether wearing pants not. ( unless fire hydrant ).  oh cmon shut fuck Woah woah woah, required wear mask indoors?! Wtf insanity wife really leaving making money hard make money, shit wife. understanding situation too.

You seem distorted view modern marriage. also helping bills? marriages two earners days, man. son ill, perhaps acting caregiver though? Regardless, needs mutual understanding COVID-19 situation.

Have spoken mortgage lender requested forbearance? able get 180 days, possibly additional 60 days foreclose. Even still cannot afford house afterwards, may help reduce stress allow time plan pivot. may want check really income moment son might still qualify SCHIP even picture, typically income limits higher people household options assessed wife nuclear option. I'm sure arguing seem agree. point direct health care workers front line vaccinated first (along high risk populations elderly immunocompromised). never said essential workers risk.""better containment cleaning protocols"" mitigate fully additional risks multiple patients sick covid-19. typical hospital like 1 2 negative pressure rooms, equipped handle airborne (once aerosolized) pathogen massive scale. fact health care workers require years study clinical practice competent provider reason need protected first. takes decade train physician, half decade nurse. takes couple weeks train cashier GED. I'm saying lives less valuable, practical standpoint healthcare infrastructure goes fucked. That's happened Italy. 2.5 weeks opening. rate Florida going, could 8-10k case day then. like anyone flying NY going escorted quarantine facility supervised 2 weeks. They're hoping people comply. probally shut things season even starts late July, thing keeps replicating like this. frankly unbelievable much damage even good tenants do. dont know manage it.  lol there’s jobs interrupt it, since mostly true? 

This problem, (a certain kind ) people see ONE counter-example show going neener neener neener point.  Ask thoughts face ID cameras. shit article. inaccurate header boot. go article linked that's actual report decent read compared this. 15.8% positive 17.4% yesterday. 

It's coming control, nothing see folks! mean hire people areas dealing surge... could survive demand. That’s NY do. That's economies work. I'll wait come way Ethiopia absorb even fraction .01% world's exports. really.

How make assertion Covid causing additional cases Diabetes huge long term impacts incorrect?  AIDS definitely worse this. also much, much harder spread.  saw people like, 'It dies 80°f' can't argue logic people, said, 'It's 80°f, 130°f.'

We're equally able find source...  explain clothes part, anyway, Rebecca, we're waiting! live life privilege, equality feels like oppression. I’ll second this. way wouldn’t kiss anyone outside household mouth right now, wouldn’t share drink either. Maybe supported specific study, certainly supported logic. speeding related blatantly denying science putting fellow community members risk? False. live Austin, TX. One trip malls downtown weekend would show wrong are. bad, still holds truth today shut stop spread, self-entitled assholes along entire political party saying ""hoax""

People believing live society 1 problem. ""there important things living"" people severe symptoms tested, likely. know there's little scientific risk marching outside. posted there's little risk spread outdoors sub back May got downvoted lol.

Anyways, goalpost shifting. said respect social distancing convenient him. hypocrite. whole thing biggest head\*%#k ever, really. start year watching China throw hospitals overnight, seeing spraying air kind disinfectant, watching cruise ships allowed dock, seeing spread NY watching national guard shut county, refrigerated trucks filled bodies, Chris Cuomo saying hallucinating talking dead father... to, HEY! everything's back normal like nothing even happened matter weeks, I'm kind just, yeah, feeling bit confused say least. Well, people actually live states. makes low rates even impressive. takes deliberate stupidity apathy spread pandemic sparcely populated flyover states. soon hit 10k, 20k new cases day. like NYC couple months ago. protests caused spike infections people attending, total infection rate offset people staying home avoid protests fear virus prevalent community. title seems imply protests causing increased cases, among people attending. It’s not. It’s called structured dismissal. employer can’t drastically cut wages. contributing factors need discussed, right, including massive protests occurred 1-2 week period, mass gatherings places like Seattle currently penalty? jailed Covid magnification jails ensure infection release attitude? every right so. dont think people realize cost wear tear takes people rent place. Youre constantly losing money wear tear use things like appliances air conditioners, example.  [This study data suggesting ignoring would better? Last checked far far people died 1918 flu.  economy would crippled regardless, decrease productivity, illness, company liabilities workers getting sick possibly dying job, etc. lockdowns saved lives it. economy always salvaged long supply/demand exist. We'll definitely get 1mil dead time. Things going get much, much worse places seeing good results lockdowns mitigation efforts virus come back around months. Time single thing tell us bad really gets. It’s never one guy. 12 players Phillies, 28 Clemson football team, 23 university Texas, Novak Dhokovic dozen tennis players and/ training staff on. It’s contagious disciplined enough. fucked are. Imagine mask wearers could count them. automatic withholding? Dude, literally suggested solution Europe using, opening economy enforcing mask policies. must suppress numbers! Um... mean reduce. Reduce!

Is virus call attention existential questions? job started recently, job one hot spots I’m close quarters co-workers. HR (who works home) introduced new health safety policies sounded good. days left already getting lazy following policies. frustrating disappointing. Also Abbot banned local cities able issue stay home orders, sure help things. mean sense overflowing ICUs hospitals well way to. convention center made covid ward Poor reporting various NTX news orgs. UTSW said reached capacity COVID unit therefore expand it. reported that, weekend, UTSW 30 active admitted COVID patients. seen official press release UT Health System though. wanted open up.... opened up... sleep bed made shit they’re risk. refute ?

They also way better containment cleaning protocols grocery store ! training! authority ! needs run President already. lol largest medical center world... full, bad scientific study,

Thats needs said really. exclusive protesters, data many protesters went get tested. reassuring sense, reads ""calm storm"" terrifying. doomers

we got covid, meds, opening rising cases, got protests race wars riots.....oh think covid least health problems going looks lately. ""I'm selfish ass also dumb even selfish properly"". Nah, Ive egging facebook. Got publically agree anyone dies corona deserves reasons personal responsibility. states corona virus response ignore Spring training back, Florida!


Take *cough* *wheeeeze* Balll **hack, cough** gammme... Take.. *wheeze* crowd.. Naw we'll laugh concept herd immunity. geologists I've known believe global warming. Probably moral cenvience. I'd dispute scientific literacy concept. Hopefully rethink every person attitude country. wonder folks keep saying, flattening curve always goal. can’t lock forever! Since hospitals overwhelmed, need open things back up!

Uhh hospitals overflowing lockdown. Opening back cases reduce manageable/traceable number blow again.

It’s simple, straightforward logic people insisted ignoring can’t stand told do.

Not many piping comments days. 

My fear states simply start fudging numbers look like “great numbers”. Essentially Trump wants, stop count.

Hey, pretend it’s there, one notice. Someone told today, looks like right. saying reality acknowledged might hurt people's feelings? can’t express sentiments like here, don’t love mask you’re clearly trying spread illness apparently. it’s hard communicate understand people lately, hope also start accommodating hard hearing/Deaf folks better :/ 

i would check r/anxiety positive covid posts need breather! [whole :) could due Oxford Phase II III time. think vaccine passed Phase II Oxford still it. That's one state another, within state. 

During 2 months shut down, county live less 50 total positive results, granted hardly test taken, handful people needed hospitalizations one person died, happened 80 already dying. Places like live need amount closures someplace size NYC large city lots people high numbers cases.

Edit: 5 50 downvoted exactly still frequents sub. ends July 31st. tune certainly change. Many major EU nations mandate wearing masks.

And don't.  exactly went. Perfect link, tyvm. problem COVID widespread begin overwhelm hospitals, also widespread becomes completely impossible keep ""non-COVID hospital."" look happened (and quickly) hospital ship sent NYC act non-COVID hospital. non-COVID hospital take COVID-level airborne precautions, including isolating patients negative pressure rooms, ensures staff non-COVID patients get COVID. EVERYONE STUDY 100% SUCCESS RATE DONE Wuhan Institute Biological Products China National Biotec Group (CNBG), affiliated China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm)

What China done whole time give us reason believe study 100% success rate????

I FUCKING SKEPTICAL covid threat? long fans around safe.

Ok then. DeSantis would probably wait week call 911 someone abducted children, never seen someone little sense urgency life Pass. Lock closest thing I'll probably ever get retirement I'm it. full steam ahead ""it's rights crowd drowned death."" actually different [Virgin cleansing flaoting around South Africa. say Spain say Europe. start claiming happens one US State translates US too? protect boy Vlad Guerrero Jr Ironically, ""husten"" German ""cough"".  Yeah u surge ICU capacity 500 1300 beds quality care suffers. sure part genius swedish plan dealing virus... Excellent question!

I say pre-ventilator patients ""okay"" we're using high-flow oxygen here, crash fast. usually warning though due slowly declining SpO2. forewarning hours leading crash, crash happens within minutes RSI time. watching it.

Patients ventilators vary greatly. Usually either come really quickly seem randomly desat pass away. survive two weeks, etc.

Really biggest issue moving high-flow invasive mechanical ventilation. needs done quickly, need frequent checks every critical COVID-19 patient. speeding road without speed limit. speed limit established people expert traffic safety maximum safe speed okay friends put communities risk viral infection, constant deaths mutilations community speeding silly. Yeah ...that would *lern'em, that's sure.* daughter cancer MRI check tumor canceled March finally rescheduled May (we live michigan - Detroit). literally canceled everything. Like cancer become elective.... told us prepare happening fall - next MRI canceled it’s scary. Ugh hope feel better soon. virus brutal. US quickly becoming embarrassment handling Coronavirus. friends across Atlantic asking fail miserably answer one word: Trump New Hampshire lot inbreds think things matter. Oh dude, trust me, I've share questionable auto-mod removals around here! surprised one gets axe point today too! Isn’t goober said older people willing sacrifice , someone else? Apples oranges though. know testing capacity woefully inadequate back NYC issues stay home order. can't find specific data positive test rate back March 20, know allowed test sickest people actively encouraging people get tested unless symptoms terrible. United States’s mortality rate higher testing precautionary response slow.

Actually, death rate high politicians thought would good idea place covid positive patients longterm care facilities. also failing test dying infection percentage

Except thousands people dying covid chance tested. He's also reopening schools. position. 

He can't change Trump says. primary focus getting us prepared vaccine. That's job. really want it. TMC largest medical complex world. crazy times WTF. can’t intelligent nationwide plan wear masks distance reduce R0. Combine testing contact tracing. 

I look Japan wear masks time, even kept restaurants open Covid control there. Korea Taiwan even better shape. 

Our worst problem administration keeps denying reality. Correction, nearly curbed, POTUS bullied nation's governors open back 3 weeks early. fucked. “What going it? Nothing. Look, I’ll put statement masks possibly considered people certain times, else want me?!” Uhm, increase production 2 billion per month? Seems like simple solution me. Downvoted, reported. Completely totally irrelevant sub. Nope, supposed get one donated blood heart rate whatever reason wouldn’t drop 110 BPM, probably hadn’t anxiety meds.

I’m hoping donate again, given Cleveland Clinic told father, clear Covid cases get without actually tested, even bother, doubt I’d show antibodies even trolling all. pointing heaping venom whole sub disagree first comment might positive thing world.  Worse that. He's trying make worse. go job hunting stay unemployment feel safe going back work lose unemployment boss calls back. I'm way go massage bunch people mask provide them. know running around maskless day. businesses enforcing new county mask rules. Right can't say N word public. want change? Yes, friend healthcare pushing ""masks work / make sicker"" hype. love her, right one. think also important City Council meeting Wednesday morning, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said 97 percent city's ICU beds filled. report Texas Medical Center (TMC) said 27 percent beds occupied COVID-19 TMC's latest report incorporated ICU admission numbers seven affiliate hospitals Houston area: CHI St. Luke's Health, Harris Health System, Houston Methodist, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Hermann, Texas Children's Hospital University Texas Medical Branch. hospitals collectively admit 1,330 ICU patients regular capacity, 70 80 percent total beds typically occupied, according TMC.

So, quick math, 1330 ICU patient capasity 27% capasity taken covid patients, 325 patients covid TMC's Monday report noted additional 373 beds could become available ""sustainable surge"" plan, procedure would indefinitely increase ICU capacities needed pandemic. Another 504 beds could added Houston ICUs emergency ""unsustainable surge"" plan, TMC would implement address ""significant, temporary"" influx patients, according report.

So, sustainable plan, could double number available icu beds covid, unsustainable plan could nearly double again.

I bring people area might anxiety getting covid worry beds available. sounds like health care community ready surge. 

Stay safe Houston!

*editted format doesn’t help us outpace states number new cases! Stay focused get ahead counts! /s live grandmother Florida. always telling ""thankful"" I'm essential worker get paid work fucking cart pusher Walmart, even though every 2 weeks get paid, takes 400 dollars salary every payday rent. always goes going outside shopping cash left over, I've realized now, went nail salon reopened plans going believes they're ""safe"" place visit.

No one going see fucking nails. essential service. yet reopened anyway people like grandma go waste time.

I actually surprised grandmother dies this. you’re willing fly all, wouldn’t worry much going. go shopping groceries spend time mom. Mask, gloves, hand sanitizer, sanitize groceries get home. biggie. What's ""if"" cases spike? Sure have. Yesterday one many new peaks next weeks. Good thing baseball back spring training camps officially start July 1!!!! lot people realize much New York got help qualified staff coming parts country. would even worse was. treat like exclusively covid, treat like there's people without covid covid governor Kansas hamstrung state congress even governor decision issue state level politics. Evidence last months shows overwhelming majority (like transmissions happen enclosed spaces. still avoid dense crowds open air, especially people wearing masks, protests seem unlikely cause large surges infections. Well really depends lot people income drastically reduced tax time comes probably lower overall income essentially giving lower benifit tax bill  denied treatment, simply never presented treatment. would treated, nobody inlcudes heart attacks broken hips list postponed surgery. Yep, everyone wore masks public would emulate herd immunity  open ICUs incoming True, except decisions needed control full outbreak deadly virus. obviously prefer make tiny decisions there. know, keep everything open life running like it’s 2019. Yee Haw. /s US would massive $ market leave out.  Yes, virus U.S. dying like Europe? U.S. covers 3.8 million square miles. Europe combined, excluding Russia (which cases Europe), covers 2.4 million square miles. area = longer curve.

Speaking Russia, since June 1, Europe seen total 334,610 new cases reported. those, 201,038 Russia alone (60%!). data bombarded media wants us see. Abbott: know fuck I'm doing. Dont mother effer would wear mask distance...everyone peeing pants get back crowded bars LA fitness suck burbee home cocktail....US culture toxic jr high school level. Angry kids guns dont tread flags. Natural selection time “We know way SARS-CoV-2 infects body attaching ACE2 receptors surface cells line upper respiratory tract. protein called TMPRSS2 helps virus invade cell. inside cell, virus replicate, triggering immune system’s inflammatory response. starting point havoc destruction virus causes body.

Initially, thought virus might infecting destroying olfactory neurons. cells transmit signal aroma molecule nose area brain signals get interpreted “smell”.

However, international collaboration showed recently ACE2 proteins virus needs invade cells found olfactory neurons. found cells called “sustentacular cells”, support olfactory neurons.” identify coloured, get wearing mask? don’t trust anything coming Desantis’s mouth, new cases truly younger people would expect see lower mortality morbidity. doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything different virus itself. rights summer? I've locked 3 months. mind weather meh beautiful out.

It's hot wear mask. need out. like flu anyway. one wears mask flu.

It's nice haircut dine friends. must catch up.

There's nothing anyway. 
/S

People reckless, careless, stupid. like woke suddenly everyone immune lockdown turned summer. lives sacrifice he’s willing take says this, relatives double wearing masks, making sure go mingle public small children much can. makes angry care whether get sick spread others also care children either. Parents put kids risk go prison.

Edit: know people take kids store due lack options I'm talking that. 1% americans actually gotten corona. 1% counted have, I'm guessing least 5% US gotten it. Data showed 8.7 million missed cases MARCH. know state, like 5th total deaths, zero deaths 20. want spread virus, care get it. Hey man, 2020 now. use term Asian Asian American. Come dude. dude run president already? 12 Days surge capacity also, mean doesn’t look severe? looking charts? COVID ICU cases almost doubled 10 days. keeps up, it’ll almost double 10 days fills surge capacity. made fun knowing exponential growth looks like. looks pretty bad me. Creating new clusters definitely matters  scientists continue waffle do.

""If paying attention March pretty easy know extra careful since little known."" fuck even mean? people needed it, stimulus check long gone. like came recently.

For people didnt need (which millions them), put savings account completely unnecessary. spent it. resident Minneapolis I'm honestly shocked bigger spike. We've slow burn 300-400 new cases daily weeks now.

The thing think really low infection rate currently...in part shut like 10 infections confirmed. AGREE article people died transport. people died moved different ICU unit. one point early last week around 14-17% Covid patients. also started taking patients children's hospital help surge. Interesting. Source? watched 2 minute ad video game left absolutely idea about. know I'd trust 0 numbers. good data available showing rigorous widespread testing practices are?

There intense pressure get numbers 0, easiest way get 0 reduce testing fudge numbers. 

Classic case humans working numbers instead numbers working humans. saw post r/Dallas either morning yesterday someone warning friends tested positive COVID-19, didn’t care still going bday party weekend. People fuckin worst man generally means many beds actual critical care trained professionals, quality care goes Yeah first bunch cases random ish spreads clusters, maybe super spreaders. beginning take week months get going, like small fire.

Once certain percentage population infected, predictable. village cancel 1’150th year anniversary celebrations. cancel did. everyone stayed isolated. we’re basically fine here. 

And get look forward oddly-numbered 1’151st anniversary 2021. Keep fighting good fight!! forget tid bit, ""The center also failed notify family members positive cases, inspection found.""

That sentence jumped me. tell family members positive cases... \[lost thoughts here\] Yes. workers restaurants taking sip drink taking bite food serving you? Two things describe Senator Marco:

1.) always say right thing 
2.) always two weeks late r/Masks4All ! opening school district 100 percent august. Yay Mississippi. hospital visitors allowed all, wasnt COVID patients. allowing 1 visitor 4 hours time. Sad times, sure.

This Rochester, NY btw Sadly result critical thinking skills. He's one people thought/thinks fluoridated water mind control vaccines cause autism. reason he's conflicted Covid-19 people knows personally stricken. probably dismissive first Trump was. Yes, bookmarks save headaches. video, way preferable. Return? still left. Right state, wrong goober...got it. Well... wish granted, suppose. 🤦‍♀️ many times China need fabricate das order reputable? Yet still can’t get President listen. hospital slow process bad COVID patients. every stage, seem linger get better die. peak weeks ago seeing patients sustain HFNC 2 weeks regular sats mid-80s, often dropping lower. progressed intubation, could go 2-3 weeks minimal improvement seemingly turning corner, sometimes taking even little longer. emotionally exhausting demoralizing come shift shift seeing slow progress patients, any. real waiting game. Makes question national response Italy, Spain, countries had. absurdity meantime part people (Salvini League) ousted government stupid ones, many Five Stars moved moderate positions, partly realization reality much complex slogans partly convenience. fact, extremists left expelled one (Sara Cunial) Florence.  Come Texas, r/Masks4All Question: hospitals outside TMC reporting system...right? all-encompassing group?

According Texas DSHS dashboard, trauma service area Q (which Houston) 12,222 staffed hospital beds 2,222 available ones 179 ICU beds. say 1,293 Covid patients hospitalized Houston - sure proportions look like ICU non-ICU hospitalizations

Is outside regular capacity paper really knees?

I hope point need Lombardy measures like triaging emergency retraining converting non-ICU capacity? sun kills virus. I’m sorry happening. wish people knew wearing mask means. hurting citizens friends families. able get access healthcare seriously going cause stress many people. took 4 months finally see someone person. 

I wishing family daughter best. Despite many aspects healthcare poor US amazing cancer treatment. Sounds good me. economic system benefits top. I’d fine over. What's situation like NC? invited friends engagement party mid July like 30-40 people outside. I'm extremely hesitant go virus plus 10 hour drive since I'm coming northern state pretty much controlled virus.  means becoming aware it, people getting it. Testing increased dramatically places paying people $20 take full antibody test Buy stocks, start loving America. school district still opening 100 percent. Hospital still reported good news nonetheless much strain Healthcare system Article would powerful could’ve found patient actually tested positive disease symptoms. Pretty weak journalism couldn’t find better representative group. October Revolution

7-12 million people died result Russian civil war followed October Revolution. number jews killed holocaust.

I think UBI preferable option... meme need NBA anything make sure guys whatever want? Lord knows pay enough ensure stay house. I’m listening podcast TWIV also John Campbell’s YouTube videos, discussed recent medical journal publications. likely one two sources. fact guy go middle biggest corona hotspot country right now, get 103 fever, first reaction ""i think i'm getting flu"" fucking hilarious. guy likely didnt think covid existed lmao. fact theres gofundme reward selfish idiotic behavior means reinforce toxic mentality encourage among many others. 29 early/mid-may. I’ve always issues sleep getting enough ever since fatigue close unbearable. another lockdown hotspot states slow this. though. ""Texas fucked! - see inside details"" sure test kids Coronavirus anyway. testing double edged sword. less testing daycare would still open 19 less children would infected. friends first place Honestly gets elected big screw ups I'm gonna speechless. again, lots people US support think Covid-19 joke. Bingo relied much governors. Trump shut month nationwide. states border restrictions really makes sense governors call.  Critical mass? planet happy. Denial hell drug. Yeah, predicting ""surge capacity"" tomorrow ""unsustainable surge"" 12 days. I'm sorry friends dumb. :( Ah see order need national leaders care people's health, egos. Timing-wise, majority current new cases likely traceable Memorial Day. People really bad masks social distancing. least SF, protesters pretty good wearing masks, social distancing. probably see cases protests, time tell. Implying Michigan badly Florida Arizona...? travel ban period. I'm sitting home another 3 months. Thank people wont wear masks spring breakers. Look, America dwindling globally number rankings. there’s one thing never happen it’s invaded losing war home soil. Russia China would wiped seconds tried attack US.

I mean it’s good thing spend much military, let’s least realistic here. reason losing COVID can’t shoot it. system 2 parties, one puts interests people interest corporations. system lot like implemented back country founded, decades corruption partisanship. Nothing wrong idea government have, current iteration. unlikely system fixed inside. There’s one left, New York, bunch states. hospitals travel nurse companies screwed travel nurses point many dropping out. isn’t infinite pool critical care nurses, RT’s Pulmonologists. metric ton nurses already sick able work. Available beds literally meaningless. too. Also, climate want creating outdoor tent hospitals middle summer. Still condemned Catholics certain Evangelical circles thanks! administration definitely blame. even one intelligent, would still people see viral videos refusing wear mask There’s way even afford UBI , burning TRILLIONS dollars . 

We need focused getting many people back work quickly possible probably restarting WPA . 

It’s going ugly 5 years ahead . mask up, stay home. Really simple. Make sure mask practice social distancing. say mask protect others getting virus have, that's bullshit. protects well. Yeah totally agree makes sense. never would've considered worked like 3 months ago lol ""There reason need leave home, unless need go out."" still mandatory mask order... problem / issue. reason decision made people getting treatments higher risk death go now. 

Ignoring advice saying ""But need elective surgery NOW!"" plain stupid. know doctors, need surgery all?

Its obviously measure taken INCREASE POTENTIAL SURVIVAL. 

Literally point make contrary favor reduced chances survival. Stop spreading misinformation trying make people trust doctors. 

Thats gonna say, obvious want convinced, want shout bullshit world. money printer's warming  It’s definitely herd mentality. Wearing mask isn’t bad feels really weird one group 50 it. Good job showing example, hopefully brings results scary cases kids symptoms seem fine, X-ray reveals lung damage... Maybe time mask return 2nd lockdown? r/Masks4All hope you’re right. Pretty much inevitable. Especially continues rallies not-at-all-socially-distant press conferences. hear two staffers Tulsa rally tested positive couple days after? theory, everyone building exposed. Practically? knows? study done Wuhan Institute Biological Products China National Biotec Group (CNBG), affiliated China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) 100% success rate. don’t trust YEAH FUCK HIM!!!! Tuesday, nearly 38 percent ICU beds 81 percent ventilators available. 

Masks required lot stores around worn fairly often, 100% I've never walked place absolutely one wearing mask. Restaurants still full capacity yet -- risk loosing liquor license breaking laws. 

We're trying best, along lot states, small handful states fucking bad good news hardly means anything. “I didn’t take seriously” would valid sometime February. even would bit stretch . Currently intelligent statement. Pretty much. depression that’s people getting unemployment checks forth happens runs out.

The housing market crazy right cannot understand it. house town 56 showings three days 26 offers.

Nothing special it. typical house isn’t enough information call good news. know morbidity much lower younger people, reason one use less ventilators.

I thought also widely known ventilators particularly effective treatment, reason two use less ventilators

The spike started takes tome people deteriorate - reason three use less ventilators.

I know wish thing mutate less harmful version - releases feed “just flu” crowd - cases spread like wildfire economy continues tank. Damn right. like see NYC go exact problem. Memory seems short-term. states chance prepare, decided instead act happen ""they NYC"". God, that’s apt. We're find i'm afraid. also disingenuous mention hospital capacity ""in state"" Governor done recently consider size Texas. Nobody drive 10 hours Houston Amarillo hospital. sad. referring oxygen. Yes. Grocery workers Frontline workers. truckers delivery guys get stuff you. good news
Means outside large groups problem. 
Most new infections probably happened inside things eating restaurants shopping outside home Tampa Bay lightning players staff also it, area infecting world's stars maybe things get little serious around Public Health Oh sure lol way dude white knight 🤣 got headache scrolling profile good god many downvotes...so much hatred garbage. way he's Native American. were, people would DEEPLY ashamed him. dude confederate flags house giant Trump doll whose dick sucks every night bed, humming national anthem, whole family shoots guns background. going need let anyone state leave either. Yeah, well get long term studies, amirite? something know years. Personally, going take common sense precautions try get hoping reliable safe vaccine made. Wish luck! It’s study 100% success rate done Wuhan Institute Biological Products China National Biotec Group (CNBG), affiliated China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm). trust that? China done make believe study 100% success rate rest world saying vaccine years away? really sure you’re getting numbers that. little research found news piece NYC title said 400 officers injured, body text said 350, later said ‘several hospitalized’ downplay several hospitalizations, seems vast majority injuries you’re complaining little scratches bruises officers reported make feel badass. Sorry hurt finger violently suppressing protest, didn’t want dangerous job, maybe don’t volunteer riot squad. You’re pretty selective viewing facts you’ve managed ignore countless videos riot squads firing rubber bullets bean bags point blank range groups peaceful protestors. matter driving squad cars protestors, attacking beating protestors filming them, indiscriminately pepper spraying groups people, etc. know it’s lot easier try discredit multi million person movement pointing isolated incidences violence engage ideas brought up, honestly can’t hold police officers presumably trained handle situations sworn protect serve communities higher standard massive disorganized protesting masses suggest reevaluate worldview.  people saying obesity isn’t problem lol? still super fucked know many kids obese adults also? We've gone ""the plausible explanation"" ""major player."" thanks lesson ""basic logic."" would expect fairly common chronic fatigue brain fog. mental haze fatigue incredibly common common cold cases flu. college bout flu mental daze atleast month fact drag ass across campus anyways, wouldn’t done anything. Pepsi Mounatin dew, don’t think would’ve able even half pay attention class.

Given it’s respiratory virus mild cases similar flu, Easy expect pretty widespread. worse mild, could easily months  We're supposed federal system, never expected feds pay sites constantly. states take eventually Yup lag several weeks someone diagnosed die, one number goes other. I’m sure research saw UTSW “sounded alarm” even tweeted run room COVID-19 unit. Nobody wants start flooding rest ICU beds COVID-19 patients. happens start risking infecting everyone else floor.

And here’s local media article. 

www.wfaa.com/amp/article/news/local/ut-southwester-additional-covid-19-space-projections-cases-rise-exponential-growth/287-66086383-1b1a-49dd-af4b-7fc7f5210919 I've read, lot money went big business. needs go people can't take hit, duration. I'm essential, dog fight, want people destitute. Though area people even try behave last lockdown, made job harder. Hope take seriously there's another one. gave wife vitamin last night. felt better effect seemed temporary.  there's also TON people wont die directly flu still die indirectly it. weird child illness various heart attacks skew stats badly. Closest come absolutely nobody dies AIDS AIDS awful lot people die. factor healthcare system overwhelmed ton easily treatable things become death sentences. Correct, plus traveling hordes over, especially SW Colorado, call home.  right, looking dangerous day. good luck finding bubble area 3 regulation basketball courts, big hotels amenities entire sports league Idaho Maine. got Columbia SC too. Texas f\*cked... Completely agree antibodies don’t last, it’s also true immunity may last well. Statements still stand. spelled ""capacity"" that's interesting point making. typical ICU patient numbers likely change, take little time double COVID ICU patients twice note. Yep. well considered. Doomers need think obsessed virus, expense everything else. States started opening many weeks ago, death count continued drop. Even virus spreading like wildfire - yes course probably - people risk, care lives, already know need keep safe. People risk also well know this, spread virus really (or their) problem. 

There inevitable number irresponsible people going taking proper precautions. much get stop drinking, smoking, eating junk food, drugs, etc, behaviors also giving pre-existing conditions, getting killed virus. virus worth anywhere near hysteria getting.  sad sick indeed many people die broke get evicted take chance hope dont catch virus. Pick poison kind deal think. far know, currently 4 vaccine candidates Phase III right now, Oxford vaccine specifically COVID19 let guess.. officials business interests china. pointless fear mongering. fuck WHO, leaving right decision Bernie, universal income Medicare - sounding nutty many people. 😁 Looks like Coronavirus back stock Amazon absolutely *need* conservative voices step right urge constituents protect others. imagine sort behavior we'd seeing trump's supporters taken hard line mask wearing sure wear mask whenever public; followers would militant wearing masks seen point american pride.

rubio might suck every conceivable way, he's right reflective leadership need. depends state. public health director LA said undoubtedly acceleration cases includes contracted covid rallies protests, say percent. California rushing towards re-opening can't disentangle one source infection another. three vent gonna stoked wake up. 10x population 10x population density. Plus Canada testing significantly less per capita US much much closer Canada's rates, doubt, expecting 15x cases US completely reasonable given much higher population higher rate testing. It’s protests - highly masked outdoors. It’s freaking restaurants bars. Indoors + masks. Authorities asked keep name bar secret. ones run cups! Classy bar. Bullshit censorship Amazing news Massive protests took place 50 states around time yet states seeing surges. agree gatherings thousands people exacerbate spread, clearly sole even significant contributor. Northeast, cases continue fall, promise 2 weeks ago protests large others country. Something else driving spike; protests simply adequate explanation Serious question, I’m UK starting slowly open things up. others seems like America completely acting like nothing ever happened. I’m seeing people social media going shopping normal, going restaurants, theme parks. seem like one taking seriously? Tested positive active infection tested positive antibodies? supposed edit titles first place. followed rule, would issue mangling grammar. virus infect olfactory neurons (not right receptors) instead supporting sustentacular cells causing swell. 

This sentence grammatical catastrophe. agree you. family stay bayboro (not far New Bern) throwing biggest fit idea wearing masks. two uncles live take care great grandmother still feel like need wear mask. Ignorance, blows mind matter many times I’ve seen (especially hometown). literally fill customs declaration-looking thing staying Hawaii. way COVID. Injections stomach usually blood thinners. I'm glad better! truth. already fucked. need use QE when, every metric, market time highs. Nevertheless, did. this, transitioned unlimited QE. glorious bubble. family Texas midwest still taking seriously. Ask anyone they'd rather nurse handling COVID-19 patients day day grocery worker, think answer question. Nurses doctors frontline undoubtedly higher risk, there's absolutely questioning that. believe free check facts many doctors/nurses died vs grocery store workers due COVID-19 exposure.

Anyhow, yes, distributed order risk priority definitely label grocery store worker right level someone working directly confirmed covid-19 patients caring them. numbers released? set time? Maybe probably alot less. Lol used live LA never heard flying Florida, [which posted yet another daily 5,500 positive tests today alone. ""god create us wear masks""

Such dumb fucking position. know I'm preaching choir but...

By logic, god create us to: 

* Drive cars 
* A/C 
* medicine 
* hunt/forage food
* Watch Fox News

The list goes endlessly on, Karen. Use fucking brain once. Reality is, risk voted either way, chose path results deaths. explains 50% American politics. 50% fear losing campaign money. Holy moly... anyone know postivity rate today?? dont care bullshit rationalizations justifications.

You put politics medical advice public safety.

Fuck arogance Would smart test patients admitted hospitals. still much higher compare things like common flu. one else find mind numbingly idiotic sports teams sending people **fucking Florida**, basically epicenter disease point?

You can't send dudes Idaho, Maine, Dakotas, places Coronavirus track million dollar Athletes? words, going fine. houston going next NYC. snapped lockdowns quickly pressure business interests. That's bottom line. went 60% way quit. we're seeing spikes throughout country. Oh boy start one:

1) like mother non-sequiturs. Responding absurd “but testing” mantra almost nothing discussion where/how infections took place. addresses unnecessary delay taking numbers seriously individuals politicians. 

2) little extent two points intersection, taking numbers seriously would implied serious belief things happening instigate spread. Protests definitely could one cause, intrinsic conflict two points. 

3) protests nationwide, extent international, measured impact varies tremendously depending happened. belief warmer places would spread less outdoors, Texas, Florida, Arizona aren’t exactly frozen north. Additionally places seeing lift start protests, would fast even memorial day infections. picture pretty muddy requires dissection. 

4) “Exactly two weeks” clue. takes longer two weeks super spreading event start accumulating relevant amounts hospitalizations. aggregate statistics move pace, means you’re several generations infections deep already, takes several weeks couple months. 

5) said, course crowding activity means opportunity infections. don’t know much. given high variance city city would suggest factors aggravating hampering greater scale that

6) Ignoring protest outbreaks second, we’re seeing expected outbreaks consumer facing industries following mask discipline aren’t really materializing, suggesting masks may actually effective greatly reducing community spread

7) compare hardest hit places compared places still seeing muted response despite also protests, wonder would see differences mask policies, mask enforcement, general self-awareness self-diligence mask wearing. think will. News flash! Majority Americans brains!!! 
😁👍 Go sports. Win goal shot. That's true. heard couple got married Zoom divorced Zoom last week. Anything possible. got it. like flu.
I wierd symptoms side effects.
I live 2 teenage kids still test negative. Got late April. worked polls Election Day.
Wisconsin important things us living dot card. Rampant stupidity gross ignorance coupled inept leadership: absolute recipe disaster. already read history books tomorrow regarding shit show. Wow, Rubio people. maybe im wrong shouldnt local authorities still enforce federal law? AIDS worse disease, COVID worse epidemic. Take vote ankles technically standing up.   Ohh weee lady science bucks pretty hard Phoenix, AZ. family member hospital, sick COVID, one could go see her. 0.1%? 1%? 10%? 30%?  don’t understand virus, see cases skyrocketing south county Wisconsin ~35,000 people 6 active cases. Bars packed every weekend since WI opened May maybe 25% people wear masks do. yes, that’s still use Reddit even though redditors mindless sheep. 100% cause? No. Major player? Absolutely. tests = positive cases, basic logic LoL Scottsdale cross state line? Believe not, jail. Florida posted massive new daily record positive tests, [over 5,500 new cases today playing roulette mother's life. would wager unsustainable going happen. sure, laugh, employer forces take hastily approved unsafe 'vaccine.' rural areas problem. Okay thanks info, Triangle. Probably going 20 hours round trip party little much don’t think people would lose jobs access NYC “4 weeks”? not, lot people spending whole amount realizing going cause problems come tax season. U cant good economy without healthy society. Simple logic time day data releases? Like day x amount cases. least county mask rules. Brazoria county? Pfttt county judge says need stinkin' masks. here. People voting God knows why. Lol. Omg can’t use PSA something ? Well? obviously dont understand it, understand said, would mean said said. 

Your statement idiotic based lack science. alone thinking, there's that. Unfortunately. voting changes things.. rather, GTFO work somewhere else. Stop dilly-dallying, it. I'm sure that: Czech authorities basically came conclusion masks would great benefit pandemic, started public information campaign using local celebrities, told everyone drag sewing machine attic rip old t-shirts, got everyone masks week.

This presumes competent central government greater trust institutions, though. We... those. That’s Karen move one do. Imagine proud Brexit. ideal deception. Lies deception among bread butter.

That NYC, NJ, cut death rates mean rest country. see deception laid deaths even though cases skyrocketing. always excuse virus real, bad, problem.

The lie probably progress back part country bad blame problem. Kinda. freedom important fear. Nope ""Sorry ladies, I'm feminist."" *Biff* NJ, hope start closing back up. Everyone seems realize Corona discriminate. get angry fair wont happen year. wet cough symptom. abuser? sure? bay area par Canada. still places lockdown closed internal borders. Proud exactly lol political move. tried smear Wuhan Institute Virology it. Tim Europe. time someone catches virus ends hospital short always worse appears escalating. Yeah exactly. Saying, 'Let's slap sanctions them' sounds alot better 'Let's literally starve agree us'. Sure thing. Sorry. Happy now? *with lasting damage*  someone tries stay top this, IHME happens Sept/Oct? know spreads like wildfire right? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  Bans travellers Europe (and places) stop covid, fuck else, ends worst effected country world. Everywhere bans travel USA. Que shocked Pikachu meme. issue sheer number people infected, asymptomatic idea shedding virus. people tested received false negative, fairly common. take chance could getting others sick? wear mask public prevent necessary spread.  I’m pretty sure adult thing make decisions choose what’s risk what’s not. Telling everyone disease kills olds compromised people acting lilies toddlers. take risks. spoken like someone never hospital bed sitting corridor. regular rooms full care suffer factors. one factor overworked staff another hospital ICU set treat ICU patients, converted hotel room not. 4th could next Chinese New Year, comes superspreader events.  Also, still remember Contagion movie, Thanksgiving big first spreader event. Possibly Come Romania good internet, rest much darn shit fast cheep (also taxes matter getting envelope going TH pay wherever got bill from) ok? know rest country watched happened New York nothing themselves. Wtf exceed days weeks. happened NY, NJ, Italy... Hoo boy country screwed.

Trump's ""response"" whole thing tip iceberg regarding preparedness regulations *everything*. environment? Phooey. Protections workers? make laugh. seen really protected, though.... President South Korea likewise said mid February would gone weeks.

You could easily argue SK president less made good statement. cases. heard old saying can't remember word word I'm pretty sure I'm going butcher goes something like this.

The fool thinks wise, wise man knows fool.

The Dunning-Kruger Effect wonder much life ""monkey see monkey do"".

I watching TV last night guy (politician maybe? I'm even informed myself) wearing mask, took speak.

If 10 minutes spent learning coronavirus, maybe would - Take mask speak.

Am saying TV needs like Mr. Rogers treat everyone like children think 10 times whether they'll understand imitate learn something?

YES It’s best imo. 



And yes I’m US citizen NRG road Texas Medical Center: almost like Pandemic. Cry river, stop whining Safety nets paid taxes paid revenue businesses. 

If businesses fail financially there’s revenue tax, means budget consequently safety net. 

Safety net programs made possible healthy economy. say 10% population lacks big portion intelligence. 


New Zealand, population 5 million, would 500,000 stupid people. 


USA, population 350 million, would 35 million stupid people. 


Note, think 10% population lacks intelligence. 2.5% 17k protestors tested positive, know why? Masks. Sooooo....I hadn’t checked IHME model awhile. Looking exciting Sept/Oct!! Dammit. place like India can’t close early. gets going it’s Actually, yeah. sued city issue work two people tested positive, got retested they're negative. Saying got false positive results. likely happen? live stare mask mandate it’s maybe 50/50.  What? scared flu? /s “That report reliable data” made laugh. true.  mass deaths destroying public confidence also destru economy. *points 120,000 dead americans* 

What fuck need stupid fuck? Uh huh sure, boris Johnson far competent trump would ever that's hard thing exhalation valves.

We don’t know doctors nurses sick.

I buy wife full face unit enough P100 filters get mess, gets mask nothing it’s possibility, authorized right due exhaust valves. fight USA covid-19 armed nutbars protesting wanted haircut, wear masks, burger.

&amp;#x200B;

They entitled stupid...and chosen fates. leader really handled crisis well. Trump. leadership. yeah, that's would make sense increase presence wanted decrease silicon valley There’s also idea seems perpetuated commit date, nothing stop them...

No. pull plug time. already pulled busy day, plenty people lined future dates.

I think waiting Governor pull plug don’t get flack. Unless infected spread shit. Testing really fault problem. Let's act like numbers exist. per capita deaths France, Italy, UK, Spain, many EU countries much worse. U.S. good job withe virus whole, neither EU. Places like Japan South Korea response proud of. problem entire thread nobody knows 90% base ICU capacity. Houston prepared surge ICUs something like affiliate 85% base capacity. broken surge capacity yet. So, numbers concerning, everyone thread freaking thinking people start dying 100% ICUs. misleading. They’re main issue states people don’t wear masks I’d say. 

Let’s say Houston beginning rise prior memorial weekend right? weeks protests thousands streets yelling without masks. certainly cause huge issue. Apparently entirety Detroit Ann Arbor don’t matter lol Think like downtown medical care. one institution dozens. We're high today countries beat virus whereas continue struggle. course eventually passed per capita testing.

We're blowing New Zealand water terms testing! Oh wait. No. Freedumb absolutely 0 regard anyone yourself, ignoring science medical advice global pandemic cause somehow *you* know better anyone else don’t give shit contract virus spread cause wearing mask damn inconvenient? Right? Wow xenophobic much? tracing work amount community spread we're currently seeing (and seeing since March). way get work get manageable caseload lockdowns use tracing maintenance. NIAID operates Department Health federal government, likely yes Trump fire threaten chain command gets fired. Lol. people don’t want wear masks.... University Florida plans open fall well, ""a lot testing"" contact tracing.

This end well. government trying kill us all? daily beast. 

 

""About hour [after nation’s top public officials denied Congress President Donald Trump ordered slowdown [COVID-19 news broke federal government winding support local testing sites states like Texas continue break daily case records.

The Trump administration end support 13 sites five states—including seven Texas, particularly hard-hit virus recent weeks—on June 30, according report [Talking Points sites set earlier year assist local authorities series missteps led national dearth available affordable COVID-19 tests. locations, feds provide testing kits, laboratory access, staff, costs.""  put nicely, sounds like people protest. say: another consequence racist behavior US cops: Coronavirus surges due people protesting right live.

&amp;#x200B;

but ok say BLM blame, ... like, seems racially motivated Trump it. 

But yields good results, I'm good admitting wrong  social distancing. Lots businesses still opened, example took cat vet social distancing period. well lot companys saw home office working. lot companys always problem find enough skilled workers region. home office hire complete country - even complete world Hindsight 20/20 ironic thing, least US, hoards loud, in-your-face people campaign tirelessly vote unilaterally ""saving unborn"", damn rights freedoms bodies; absolutely nothing fact arguably act detrimentally, save people (all 120k counting). EU airlines fold en-masse too. BRITISH Airways, Lufthansa, KLM exist transfer US/Canada passengers Asia/Africa. Ryanair thrive legacies fold. same. enough data outside activities pretty safe, safe based lack protest infections.

Jury still indoor activities might happen Az. However given cases people 50 may bad. state people 50 represent 5% deaths least 50% cases. 4th July right around corner, too. That’ll definitely help spiking numbers unless cities drastic things like people group one spot see fireworks. Perhaps that’s neighbors already started shooting fireworks randomly. sure 'news'.

Its toilet. Flushing 'stirs up' death destruction deposited. like H2S, 'distrub it' things get worse.

Kind brainer. every state isnt effected like 100% clout. Vaccines profitable TONS TONS money poured right now. pretty much get innovator's name there. Lol ok w/e troll. Ok well lol actually careful....unless you’re COVID wing hospital need this. Running H‑E‑B? Complete utter overkill. 

It turns really simple fight. Like I’ve said before, it’s like idea spreads. It’s clothes shoes, it’s people breathing around one another. Focus energy avoiding people, especially unmasked people. messaging like complete utter sterilization counterproductive, guarantee lot people going restaurants little squirt hand sanitizer think makes ok, really that’s barely vector turns out. want transfer companies Toronto office badly. I’d give anything escape US. really feels like life/safety issue point. Give time. Exponential growth funny like that. Disney employees automatically entered pushed front line. leadership isn’t happening it’s supposed know can't anything face it. (Also already concentration camps. They're called American prison system. thing missing ovens.) New York State here, New York City second hardest hit area outside downstate region. Saw truck Alabama plates two days ago wanted yell ""GO FUCK HOME."" Lol no. Britain lost power ww2. please. Boris Johnson even looks like Trump. clearly team. brexited jt US government time. reason joined ""war terror."" Perception reality United States currently (That's key word) ten times amount new cases per day compared Europe, 100 million people. surprising? large gathering people spike numbers It’s political comment, it’s timeline events... net gain 385 hospitalizations due Covid specifically? 385 general? america says hold beer. they’re opening additional offices there, they’re moving there. Silicon Valley companies employees world. funny nobody uses rhetoric flattening curve anymore. still completely relevant everywhere. Yep, bail banks, mortgages paid banks could collapse

If mortgage paid rent needs collected

If cannot pay rent need get someone lose building dont want wear it? Speak little mixed bunny  Saw CNN poll showed 33% Americans would REFUSE coronavirus vaccine even one found. study spured headlines saw antibodies decreased 2-3 months **asymptomatic** cases.

Most symptomatic asymptomatic folks still antibodies time point. titers lower declining. note, live near around El Paso county area Texas, provide free testing. Every couple days days spots get line test you. Texas shit show unfortunately least liberal city ignoring facts. overconfidence scary. everything right still caught it. Yeah live (this town specifically well) I'm surprised able get everyone wear mask. I'd say 1/10th people wear them.  I’m CM Disney, union gave power strike contract disney. kind sense make? idea. may right there.  I've said nothing racist. mean, guess can't see one party pushing lot harder political stuff, that's truth. true busted ass 2 party system here, one party purposely putting people's lives wellbeing risk order advance politically, simply trying stop that. Yeah cause man 80k hospital debt bury loved one. It’s over. safe ourselves. two uncles Houston still post daily fb posts it’s hoax won’t wear mask. Glad live Iowa aren’t better honestly. I’ve worked whole time 50 percent people don’t wear masks shopping. got halfway response, TTC also commonly used acronym ""Trying conceive"" parent groups. 35% Americans don’t believe science. 

Half US citizens still believe propaganda news machine tells them. 


Why dumbest people confident? mean, I'm you, voting anti-science politicians fix stupid. fact, tons people know following safety regulations anymore like social distancing wearing masks people ALSO claim want vote anti-science people office (at least, happen talking global warming anti-vaxxers). confusing time. Constitution. say like they'd street there's reason politicians able take months year campaign. Working people can't afford this. downvoters libtards genuinely believe protesters immune? conservative nut jobs deny virus exists? C'mon, one ya? I’ve worked quality compliance two FDA regulated industry. FDA far perfect, controls place sufficient.

Outside immediate question, I’ve worked fairly dangerous places much international contact, safety philosophy interlocks, etc much rigorous significant portion world.

The US fucked myriad ways, isn’t one them. Damn medical science sure doozy isn’t don’t understand? think foreign companies governments won’t business us nervous another global pandemic happens won’t take seriously? No, think seeing play real time that's proving true all.

Some people staying indoors responsible vast majority people stupid ignorant facts pandemic. 

It would take way much devastation get even majority people board. That's government need step regulate reasonable time. 

Like recent county mask order. People absolute morons already turning political issue complaining, complying. that, def seemed numbers people wearing masks dropping steadily. Welp.  fuck... thought ventilator sedated cold, like induced coma? telling people saw Italy lying facedown days/weeks time conscious? hard show someone resident third-country unless EU/Schengen one paperwork recognised. US person hanging bout Asia may still face difficulties flying Frankfurt one Italy, not. Trump taken wearing mask, narrative would fool media would promoting reams peer reviewed studies prior 2020 dismiss efficiency cloth masks form source control.

Here Canada I'd say see 5-10% public wearing masks. US vastly overstating effectiveness cloth masks solely orange idiot President wear one. political narrative scientific one. Sure, hear term ""elective"", tend think non-urgent. non-urgent surgery lived moved, doctors monitored patients see anything particular case changed. seems week two time like eternity, luxury have.  Fair. think though virus always mutates towards virulent opposed deadly want wear it, forcing so. Speak yourself. Personally, nothing motivates work like friends family dying something absolutely preventable. [In NYC case, contact tracing going... partially political stupidity part New York's Mayor, put responsibility contact tracing city's public hospital system (mostly physicians) real experience contact tracing, away city's health department (a good cadre epidemiologists), happens plenty contact tracing experience, given city's history AIDS, TB, etc. That's scares most. think Americans understand things get worse. We've cut many holes safety net   functionally non-existant point - now, many people need hope people finally see much fucked over. 

We distorted view risk... we're willing pour billions military protect us ""foreign"" threats things crumbling burning domestically. live Birmingham. medical field industry. Can’t meet 5 people without finding one works medical job. best hospitals country.

I also secretly compiling statistics mask/non-mask wearers here. common mask wearers black people whites 50. black people haven’t seen wearing masks pack teenagers Winn-Dixie once. plague still exists. handful cases every year US zoonotic transmission.

Bubonic plague doesn’t spread easily person person, curable antibiotics, rather ominous symptoms. bacterium gets lungs, becomes contagious deadly, doesn’t come often.

A better example “worst case” disease would vaccine-resistant smallpox. maybe mutated form measles. Yes hand always declared first citizen knowing Romans hated kings. Even death thinks could reverted Senate already cozy status quo made Tiberius successor. Almost like ""me first"" happen good economy good retirement funds. DUI forbidden, driving general. Similarly walking without mask infected forbidden, walking without mask general Wow. Really?! absolutely blaming them, get infected take right precautions sensible others. That’s it’s unfair punished like I’ll one eventually. forcing back job. back week. I’ll quitting stay home since sense. Rather broke unemployed dead haven’t permanent lung, heart, brain damage. thought everything bigger Texas tho 
Well apparently 😷 cells dont make antibodies. B cells do. cells are, however, involved process Texas Medical Center published page dry statistics get clicks? easy take seriously killed 1,500 people per million state.

Less killed 71 people per million state NZ good job, it’s bit easier isolated island country often gets left maps. Iceland doesn’t cases either Waltham whatever-the-fuck-that-was intersection still wake sleep. That’s enormous “if.” many 100-plus vaccines pursued targeting T-cell response? Two? Three? It’s impossible still far less supported research. contribute spread virus? Time Flowbee make comeback think staggering amount money make COVID-19 vaccine start see logic behind subjecting many people COVID-19 possible. infected person potential source COVID-19 antibodies. laws TX want us come visit. WTF. feel pity US truth that's told bad intent
Beats lies invent. least people took part wore mask. yet see public officials telling people refuse wear masks daily business they're worthless plague rats. can't afford it, I'll go die town halls steps everyone watch. think main issue. couple calls could sorted sensibly go *tweet politics*. Border closures unfortunate inevitable sort evacuation processes first. Spain weird stuff data specifically fatalities. Everything said applicable US many countries matter. Unfortunately government consistently defunding education system decades. national local level, intentionally dumbing populace goal mind. large enough percentage population uneducated elect continue love president actively works interests line rich people's pockets money. long focus bad people look different are, never condemn even pay attention anything detrimental government doing. Thing changed lot since 2015. ""could"" Vilifying dehumanizing enemy often gets agree woke masks gloves last week. asked pull mask see face really failure national regional leadership help people. know people TX work weeks first shutdown now, literally, saying ""Fuck Grandma. eat. rent."" disaster. Yeah, odds strict action date somewhere around negative seven percent  heard surprised. I've seen lots doctors say virus keeps finding new horrible ways attack body, including blood clots such.

I seen pictures lungs [before Covid-19. Causing scarring pulmonary fibrosis. Including cases younger people.  Texas really screwed pooch.  fat man asthma, see outlook particularly positive. using mask, gloves, wiping groceries w/ Clorox since early March seems like going nothing. die, karma. think people thought New York City seemed lick it, over, could let guard down. virus never left, went mostly somewhere else. Also, ironicly, Ebola could kill day so, would never spread half much, would never chance to. Ebola could spread week killing you, would greatest nightmare. Yup, wearing mask, suspicious get roughed up/killed. saw anemic kid wearing mask walking home.

If wearing mask, ""breaking law"" get roughed up/killed. related:

**Former official says Trump often refused believe intelligence read intelligence reports, looks graphs, charts, even blamed January 23 briefing adequately warning threat novel coronavirus posed — even though received dozens intelligence briefings matter, well warnings scientists national security officials.

Trump reportedly read written intelligence reports given, though look visuals graphs, charts, tables, satellite images.

During oral briefings, Trump reportedly veers off-topic, expresses skepticism, pivots gossip heard friends, even stops listening told incorrect. Calling names definitely get come around put plane sent home Netherlands said ""Get American hospital!"" county set goal 10% portion daily COVID test results come back positive, managed stay threshold every day since Gimenez lifted closure orders businesses May 18. declining trend reversed early June, crossed 10% threshold first time. Vermont? result fewer texans, what's problem? idea, close hospitals temporary, X amount people per day, every couple days close hospitals we're much lower. /s think two linked. people trusted leadership, leadership asked something would it. people saying sorts shit. People coming crazy conspiracy theories own.  Founding Fathers rolling graves. Thank laugh I’ve today! If? 0 sympathy morons still don’t believe pandemic. reason persistence inevitable “second wave” we’re seeing (which first wave perpetuated assholes won’t take precautions). cost others lives. Fuck people. selfish overpriced cocktail stupid craft beer important another human’s actual life? Fuck you. Hahahahahahaha,

You would literally rather throw temper tantrum learn read graph..

You reason ""Floridaman"" meme.. good nyers took serious opening see people relaxing. kids parks groups without mask certain blocks lot bars look like block parties. wait n see contact tracing put fires fast enough. Oh look expert economists left right protests one reason another, Americans clearly give fuck.  Yeah. sucks options literally ""your money life/health"". president thinks less testing means less cases.

Yes. Seriously. hitting Nevada/ las Vegas/ Phoenix places fucking desert. Offer solutions? Hahahahaha  That's good one. So, authoritarian regime think telling truth?

China. say ""the truth"" much Belarus, that's obvious. Next question? Governors think strategically. need federal government that. government failed people miserably. Respiratory therapist Saginaw died COVID-19 loved God

I'm sorry passed, sounds like genuinely good person, cares loved God. sure seem like helped it. much upset businesses reopening

Nah, I'm chill. take stress die early upset. love called twat
My favourite word Rand Paul?

Edit: I'm little sick wording sometimes feel like relevant comment made.  Russia, virus catch you! agree, flabbychesticles  Well, political. Lets act like economy important. important. many unneccessary deaths.. 
This can’t nice things. extra $600 till july 25th know, $$$ people.

If know before, figured saying *Let's kill Grandma sake economy!* This... might wrong. Provided also signed EO allowing academic medical labs everywhere use primers get tests rolling immediately. relevant clear meaning stuff behind comma. want change Constitution, feel free. then, don’t tell words don’t mean clearly mean. 

Go read Patrick Henry James Madison know thinking wrote way. Yea they’re unemployment couldn’t give less fuck going back work they’re making before. I’m criticizing people, pointing many fine lockdown.

Ask anybody owns business would like return lockdown you’ll get much different results.  100% disagree study, nothing suggest 65% Americans would want go back quarantine/lockdown Canadians 1 minute automated phone call funds direct deposited 2 day. Sometimes line busy pretty nice regardless arrogance. faulty assumption capable civil discussion. apologies.

The fact think Scientific American, CDC, NY Times, Wikipedia ""biased propaganda"" makes wonder tabloid getting ""truth"" from. ""no one"".  percentage idiots. assume are! good, economic system rigged work extraordinarily wealthy ironic thing allocated resources taken seriousness deserves could basically back normal status instead giant mess we're going deal time -- cost us much now. But, hey, it'll nice 'cause twice. would’ve ruined reelection chances, since that’s cares about. super agree. I’ve waiting 2 weeks hear back unemployment office options course since it’s government facility one anything. can’t find out. roommate won’t let quit. He’s unemployment cause work OT right now. doesn’t care gets sick dies bring back. I’m miserable furious time. BS making wanna get spread around since clearly one cares live die. Yea Thor. Among first cases US town 1 me. hospital patient less 10 minutes away me. got chuckles went office mentioned kind worrying close Reminds federal hurricane relief went Northeast needed Hurricane Sandy, later gulf states needed hurricane relief 2017 season. Florida enters chat Meanwhile Czech Republic allowing everybody wear masks anymore anywhere, study numbers coming weeks make decisions masks help accordingly. Predictions trajectory continues:

* Numbers get high frighten people soberness
* Trump press conferences wearing mask
* ultimately get blame poor handling lose re-election I'm guessing 65% ones either getting paid relatively same, many situations even normal yeah course loved lockdown.. 

The real, reality country can't continue support another lockdown. Nothing free, money dished come somewhere inevitable collapse occur, unfortunately many people understand that. Sure, lock people homes less likely get infected COVID, banning people driving avoid people getting killed car crashes. point. point lockdown cause order magnitude fatalities life's saves.

I put category 3 post.  mentor MICU 1:7, sometimes 1:8 height NYC's crisis. spoke her, defeated. said thing brought number one patients died, even bought hour lowered ratios. first 4 weeks, patients died. 

I never felt helpless life, listening hero cry patients. bad beyond belief, horrifying states learn crisis point. Greeting wildfire smoke covered, billion degrees outside, Covid infested Arizona! 

2020 magical year.  thanks!
be safe Return? never even stopped Ever hear inflation? Money free, cost. work + rampant money printing = INFLATION! dont understand still lockdown. sad, people Brazil become casualties another incompetent leader.  
2020 turns humanity finally sees leaders trully full shits simply lowest scum earth. May doom fast short.  gym definitely get virus. 65% show vote make real change. Alabamian, going telling anything new governors react properly. needed leadership, get it. Nobody predict depends entirely choices, essentially random. fail containment nationwide 70% population gets much better cure now, deaths certainly low millions. Small hats? follow. saying small hats like (((small hats))), something? so, I'm really surprised number upvotes got, lol. Yes, reopen protests pretty cringe Ok. 12k die due tobacco use year Sweden

Ok, number much lower 1990 numerous anti smoking laws introduced [still Try again.  want leave earth. Report county health department. honest, non-biased partisan answer: long-term one knows overall beneficial society not.

It's certainly beneficial short-term single parents juggle two jobs raising children. way use UBI send kids day care quit one jobs spend time them. kids less likely grow become criminals, reducing long-term cost society well.

It's waste money slackers want chill play video games, use money travel world, money ends elsewhere. Still...a respiratory virus isn’t going infect directly skin. long wash hands thoroughly touching anything that’s contaminated there’s real reason wear gloves. posturing... finally get May (praise Lord) finally opened stuff up. Yeah hospital wanting people come appointments! Glad hear that’s case FL news shows crazy high counts there! really talk impact QE going economy enough. country's leadership essentially injected steroids economy already pushing limits. balls shrinking. one party state (quite succesfully) permeates every aspect life society organizations ideology definition totalitarianism. Thats China.

I agree but, cares? Potatoes, countries crushed curve similar way like PRC even less drastic methods.

And Sweden flattened even less drastic measures. Yeah - I'd like lazy work get triple pay poor essential worker works pennies taxed pay relax play video games day.

Fuck shit.  take chance dying outside, well.  Give everyone hazard pay one. Fucking sick bullshit.  days dream get time. Please trade lol. still quite newsworthy. doesnt seem true source lasting whole 

Are ischemic strokes hemorrhagic strokes ""completely reversible"" now? Wow, medical technology advanced much 4 months! confirm. CVS minute clinic uses Sonora quest labs test took 10 days get results Thanks honest - wasn’t asking try hard you, think sharing personal stories like help turn tide. wish coworkers good health. highest 55k, problem system use report new cases day states report properly. count that, highest number far. Deaths bit though that's good guess, things terrible I'll take kind good news Well makes feel better trump pretty good fucking job making sure war might like 1920s think people forget wearing masks besides obvious scientific/health reasons, signal. signal others still pandemic need extra vigilant cautious. 

Without masks seeing sick people, easy think typical summer day. gun 99.5% chance jamming.  test, new cases. President following line thinking logical conclusion.

This negligent homicide.

He's got go. Seriously. people actually page here, could eradicated virus June relatively back normal. huge population country want give ""freedoms"" beat fucking pandemic we're looking living fear semi-lockdown vaccine comes countries already beaten returning normalcy. ah shit thats right! That’s opening band name. think could UBI us least three months everyone hunkers down. go back normal, maybe virus would eradicated greatly lessened. mean printed trillions couple months ago banks, can't anything us?

They want to. don’t follow enough should, possibility mandating masks maybe people immunodeficiency isolate much possible? least could try keep things going Scary pay workers well all. company got one loans. I’d rather keep career love invested life in. value $4,000 payment tax money. gave condescending paragraph 🤩 Triage patients start letting old sick die. That's happened Italy. goes beyond that, start lottery system people might make ICU treatment essentially euthanized win spot (morphine, etc) impression way less 0.5% that's kind scary number shocked face 😑  /r/gaming wants word  PA. heard similar plans floated (from family teachers). 

One heard sounds good, I’m sure would work keep high school/middle school kids home spread elementary school kids throughout system. issue needing teachers buses. 

Whatever decide going need tweaked. Nothing come gonna perfect. I'm guessing due doctors becoming better overall handling virus. biggest thing miss buffet enough revenue ass. CEOs hospitals make millions billions dollars. CEO hospital making 500K, half millions dollars, live one lowest economic areas TX. making much? provide care to? one. revenue keep staff, hire staff, NEED. hospital association blaming lack care lack funds??? don’t want give profits. say working nurses, listening stories, listening hospitals put licenses risk due unsafe conditions, research CEO salaries. 

Nurses don’t get paid much TX frontlines. Risking lives everyday us. agree doctor says patients don’t COVID?? important?? I’ve hospital 4 times although presumed COVID gone, last visit felt like wasn’t important even though experiencing seizures, abnormalities senses, skin rash. healthcare costly, I’ve pay upwards $5k already insurance kicks in. It’s outraging country handling pandemic long would transit Houston another state be? Texas huge. Probably quickest Louisiana (5 hour drive Houston). Texas's big cities least 4 hour drive apart, Texas lot empty space. 

For example 11 hour drive El Paso, Texas Houston, Texas. Within state. mountain passes anything. flat driving.

But surely cities Texas help capacity. government good job containing virus /s that's they're testing much! Positive cases up? No.

Hospitalizations Deaths up? Yes Lol rednecks listen he's Hispanic fash enough. healthy elderly adults. It’s vaccine trialed help respiratory viruses. Much like pneumonia vaccine offered elderly people now. title bit misleading see attitude shift ones low risk ones high risk. right, recognized late. Honest question, since native, aggressive? copied pasted actual line there. apologize appeared bold, might issue. take care future. thank hint, meant way. Yikes. Calm down. attacking you. I’m healthcare. knew wouldn’t go away summer hit. thinking it’s running rampant countries it’s hot places even humid officials get idea would die down. They’re comparing much flu. distributing lot different information opinion making people think it’s serious. think mayor governor says don’t wear masks large gatherings making people think it’s serious ton wrongful death lawsuits sitting desks. Healthcare workers trying protect others. fair us anyone else taking proper precautions try prevent catching virus. people havent stopped. havent stopped working. Florida here. past week we’ve seen daily numbers higher they’ve ever been. “if” us. think we're little late ""if."" \#winning anyone know mask driving factor bringing covid cases korea? administration definitely push it, alot people suffering economic hardship right now. “logic” baffles me. It’s like tell wear sunscreen beach don’t get sunburn, do, come back without sunburn... start taking “see nothing worry about!” *Um yeah took appropriate precautions dumbass* person wasn’t wearing mask, wearing one would’ve helped, little.

Mask wearing like wearing pants.

If I’m pissing none us wearing pants get wet, you’re wearing pants still get wet, slightly less, I’m wearing pants don’t get wet. Keep mind indeed true, could temporary. don’t want rain parade promising news, even temporary, don’t want get overconfident sloppy seasonal effect play. fuck people shaming people working?  people getting $2400 month per unemployed family member. ends next month, ""jack shit"". reopening fits timeline affects entirely wide demographic. People aren’t participating BLM protests getting sick, people working are. 

That tends happens millions new carriers virus. there’s massive jump African Americans Whites 20-40s metropolitan areas yes could blame protests. rn that’s case.

Most people 50 asymptomatic make fine carriers. 

As always, risk groups contact dangerous. Main prediction: Cops lookout suspicious (minority) people causing disturbances (protestors) use tack extra charges arrested, SOMETHING charge people exercising 1st amendment with. Yeah, wishful thinking. really hope even less this, appear likely. I'm hoping tip iceberg. IHME model. safely ignore it. got predictions wrong now. goo goo ga ga got really defensive internet stranger called people nasty child that’s dead proceeded act like didn’t type caps defend deleted comments gross bc context fuck internet stranger talkin deleted comments wanted rip fat ppl waa waa change diapers People made point already, they’re useful handling one issue time. I.e. surgery. idea unsterilized thing touching patient/their body blood/germs gloves instruments. 

Plus - far washing hands instantly removing gloves, wash hands?

In grocery store elsewhere gloves germ ridden hands, store isn’t sterile. even able put properly keep sterile, assuming general public done naive. Kinda left important part there
 Universal Anti-Viral Vaccine Phase I/II Clinical Trial **Healthy Elderly Adults**
 
However, good another reason vaccine elderly may process normal vaccine younger people always something needed looked Dumbass, op said wait 2 weeks everyone wearing mask it’ll over. slow? shit help. op asked could go back normal, normal virus. no, masks aren’t 100% blockers virus, won’t fine. whatever get back

They *have* get back though. Fiscal responsibility debt concerns go window minute print multiple trillion dollars stimulus course month. would still apply even then. Wait age group dumbest. thought supposed progressive era damnit.  Healthier age? Uh. Maybe *similar* health age considering general population US there's way he's actually healthier. I'm willing bet they'd write garnishment clauses poor falling behind see dime. see last check, boy glad creditor got cross line ledger. I'm sure hurting much worse me. That’s fucking crazy, it’s like he’s Russian asset something Thank tips! Sadly I'm extremely mentally ill (I'm disabled it) smoking stressful end psych ward (this happened every time I've quit). tried nicotine patch couple days stressful keep smoking. nicotine craved, ritual smoking.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide Might weigh bit depending live age. places would fine, call ahead see kind procedures following, wear mask.

Definitely would worry dermatologist appointment, espcially could something important. Sooner might better (again could depend live).

Hair salon risk, good protocol mask usage sides appointment, makes things much less risk truly great mental health.

Similarly psychiatrist might take extended period time easy establish safe distance mask usage. People get offended bear mind things complaining come place privilege. lot people literally can't afford worry able go fucking restaurant right now.

And sure people's problems discount problems own, find hard sympathy complaining missing stuff right people dying going homeless, small numbers. big sacrifice. Boredom privilege, stop trying act like victim bored.  Arizona shithole country. Lol yet telling infected NY is. Lol. Humanity stupid realize that. doom slow burn I've said start; ONE protesting lack relief individuals. dipshits protesting lockdowns and, recently, requirements wear masks. Many, many Americans simply want pretend everything OK, surprise anyone. ignore genocide Native Americans, ignore slavery racism its' aftermath right day, even ignore fact American Jesus white dude clearly that. 

The American Dream fairy tale upward mobility anymore, refers shared mass-fever hallucination. 
My boss: I’m reading true. really need research away usual mainstream media. Smh poster listed three.
(1) Resources
(2) Political will
(3) Ideology already attempt buy votes putting name physical checks. Suggesting came directly makes essentially bribe. new virus China mutated strain going around US Europe now. It’s original virus, new one. Somehow, one going around got seeded China. kind expert who's relevant talk. we're following trend, Monday tends highest death count week, probably deaths weekend counted Monday. Pepperidge Farms remembers I’m Texas yes, absolutely correct. Cases mean deaths people. Lots people asymptomatic survive fine. need testing increase cases doesn’t mean city suddenly safe anymore. applied phone, website like we're talking about. they're making free money unemployment go outside. Lmao. hate working paid extra you. hope everything turns okay family get this! 🙏🏻 Today day 101 working home me. hard even think back like work office. literally leave house go grocery shopping. Luckily majority family introverts we're stir crazy. Also seeing AZ's numbers past 2 weeks helps keep us inside. true 100%, someone tests multiple times showing positive adds false negatives.  majority ppl take multiple tests test positive, negative. retested avg. 4 times testing negative. Thanks.  unfortunately feel you. single mom, essential employee married essential employee (I Whole Foods, husband nurse long term care facility), two special needs kids, one severely failed situation. kind want cry drop hat, stress tsunami point. much progress lost, much time lost, many opportunities lost. Mostly failing fucking terribly working home sort school stuff.

So, one struggling mom another, I'm sorry going through, I'm sorry son's struggles. get unemployment US quit? Yes they?

Oh well. Maybe liable prejudiced, maybe less. Lots police POC themselves. No. Masks magic cure stopping transmission. BAH GAWD KING. STONE-COVID! STONE-COVID! STONE-COVID! Nope. 
 province "" strongly suggested"" made mandatory. live province cases still nothing Welcome Reddit lock people leaving homes go interact other, regardless reason. Ok, disagree you. short violent revolution turning everything ash abide made mechanism economic rules follow today. one rules people need jobs economy function. get wrong, ideally want UBI everyone would fix issue almost immediately. realistically feasible, kinda moot point bring up.  imagine thats tribalism became focal point human development. people fickle selfish bastards unless youre tighly knit spider web connections (a tribe), people fend like crabs bucket... everyone dies.. least back hunter gatherer days anyway. absolutely nothing article states suffers from, may suffering from, depression. know might important conflate absolutely everything. Probably means spikes higher normal statistical noise.

Remember, 1 85 die every year. Covid barely drop ocean Nobody said 100% prevent virus. 

They lessen spread. mask wash hands get back car mask pointless. Masks part list things do. outlined experts spend whole life studying infectious diseases. 

There's reason surgeons wear masks... 100% time. know could repurpose maga hats masks fuck wrong people talking ICU beds article points collectively 1,330 beds regular capacity. Usually ICU beds see 70% occupancy normal conditions. Probably not, unfortunately. previous tax years, type SIN phone hopeful full lockdown? Trump mentioned recall Pelossi bitched unconstitutional. It’s governors happens state president can’t lockdown still country. Plus, 13 testing sites nothing. 100+ state state run. shows aren’t ready reopening? insane increase spread TX, FL, AZ, NC, SC, GA, AL, MS reopened? There's two sides every single issue planet. Grass green. Sky blue. Masks work. There's ""I see sides, grass might green, might purple"". Masks fucking work. shocking word entirely accurate. us federal organization response. president clear governors states manage it. states compete resources. federal government complete lack organization, definition haphazard. goddamn true! live southeast it’s unbelievable. disregard intelligence, knowledge, truth. live truly anti-intellectual country. mean I’ll doubt boring bandits group Asia experience. US's experience fighting respiratory pandemic LITERALLY century old. Asia several past 2 decades, including SARS OG. Wow. Leave things states... conflicts narrative... Good. guess timezone use. day reset midnight GMT+0. Basically anything reported 5pm PST count next day.

While looking something like single day stats may misleading, accurate trends since every day. fantastic description. sheer number ignorant people astounding. saddest part believe clever folks true experts somehow idiots. 

As soon hospitals overrun, see true death rate disease devastating. course cause second panic food shortages. would thought virus two-week incubation period discovered months ago would worst six months later. 

Had really shut required masks, we’d past now. one thing probable, Texas much bluer state. completely disregarding safety precautions overwhelmingly conservative. Dr. Fauci right. chasing wildfire now. US imposes economic sanctions EU proposal ban us passport holders people coming us normally reside there? can't tell article. Asking citizen lives elsewhere. Yeah there’s ways get Hawaii Nooooo went back looked calendar right, I've working home 15 weeks. 

Having everything week week seriously messing perception time. fucking depressing. Well that's ridiculous technicality, think safe say discovered originated. think first test “Sinopharm China National Biotec Group (CNBG)” vaccine wheel. Anything possible. Sounds like UK 🤦‍♀️ People predicted end humanity everything else bright side that. Probably there's running joke paracetamol cures all. Go GP? Paracetamol. Hospital? Paracetamol. Psychiatrist? Still paracetamol. 

I think native Dutch people instinctively reach even notice options. shame paracetamol anti-inflammatory useful many situations.   did. “Some diseases” “other factors” weasel words. Sure it’s unmatched *every* category care, MC is, that’d silly standard apply.

On top that, US incredibly massive compared developed nations, results higher quantity lower rate hospitals brings average down. compare best US best elsewhere, results pretty clear. maybe 'intellecuahls' like Joe Rogaine stop saying ""They said would really bad, isn't!""  Ignoring ACTION taken make bad.... fucking fuming mad sais shit. fuels morons fill country. FUCK AMERICA parents came Deep South, 70 yr old lady work says wears one job anywhere else

“Don’t think that’s unwise?”

*”well hear lot sides”*

“But medical professionals nearly unanimous except quacks”

*“look dad doctor daughter nurse. know medicine”*

“What would say?”

*....pause....”you hear lot sides”* Where'd read borders closed NSW? impression be. People want positivity. Doom. Doom, gloom, panick. going go away eventually does, find disaster exaggerate.  Italy's response literally ""hey maybe work Chinese, experience pandemic, instead blaming cooking conspiracy theories calling hoax"" Yep, knew exactly going happen protests riots. Bulgaria?  people encouraged go went protests higher rate positive cases people encouraged go known contact symptoms? Um that's really good. think could see likely 2 rounds vaccines. 1 could Christmas/Beginning 2021 focus ""just get elderly/high-risk people vaccinated, long-term effects damned. likely see slower vaccines took time properly vet weigh long-term effects next 2-3 years (completely bullshit guess... throwing number there) damn orange charge naval office. Oh no! Anyways, Internationale starts playing does, producing vaccine?  confuses me. federalies basically left things states. want what? control not? Everything's bigger Texas. Words die apparently. would call 12.5% significant. That’s 16,000 less dead people US used start pandemic. need remember US large country people like live Boston one best hospital systems world. looked study, point regional differences place like (92.5) MS (81.5). 

The US overall ranked 29th 88.7 points. country population 100 million ranked higher Japan. Iceland ranked first population 364,000. Luxembourg, also top 5, population 600,000. Andorra 9th population 66,000. entire top 5 population around size Bos-Wash (50M.)

I’m sure found Americans think they’re ranked first. Gallup data found 34% Americans rated healthcare coverage excellent 55% said system overall good excellent. cloud. legalities that? anything like ever done? would enforce it? Checkpoints outposts major highways? Would take quite lot effectively enforce it. combating disease order feel better? #2019 knows cares himself. mind believes exporting country pays tarrifs average consumer passes to. Either he's actually dumb base stupid believe Sith deals absolutes! American, get it. You’re talking ass. 

TCH top 2 US across rankings, BCM top 10 med school, pavilion women top 10 specialty clinic US. Ben Taub handles number weekly patients cities, it’s one hospital. 

Houston med center also largest bed capacity city country, largest staff run hospitals. (Haven’t seen numbers years, might changed*) ER care Houston top rate, Houston EMS top rate. 

MD Anderson massive, amazing, it’s far away thing med center offers. really bad. Things gotten nearly.as bad people predicted. k handy I'm mobile, look ""healthcare systems ratings Lancet"" get latest, thorough research made world's healthcare systems, funded Bill &amp; Melissa Gates Spoiler alert, US ranked 30th (33rd Iirc?), Americans think they're ranked yes, right bullshit.

Wrong. Read study. matched, success rate diseases mediocre best, mention factors US fares incredibly poorly. Get bubble lmao. know sources use. current administration literally spent millions masks, ventilators test tubes made test tubes soda bottles paying actual usable test tubes. Backlog testing data 40 million  Ehh. city’s sub resorted calling people “Doomers” now. 

It doesn’t spread outdoors. doesn’t affect young. We’re hoping numbers go go “see...!”

I don’t comment anymore I’m surprised. People don’t give shit. nightmare Coincedence young people protesting it. I’m deeply disappointed self entitled attitude “Me” generation. You’d begin think would gotten wiser years.  remember going local gas station surprised people wearing masks, like faculty 1-2 randos everyone else kept mask on. 

Its scary people think pandemic get worse complacency. really needs stringent requirements ASAP. live here, haven’t taken tests yet, know people took one also know hasn’t really anywhere near 50% rate positive tests
What happens number isn’t regularly updated here, probably number PCR tests taken hospitals something like that.

We test shortage, that, test analysis shortage (some tests take two weeks results), like Greg Abbott said okay . . . . /s Get bubble. Research time look left leaning sources. I'm American care party America belongs too. parties. Get bubble. wait till fall. Deaths still low right historically consistently summer. Oh see covid 19 patients - people pneumonia, respiratory disease, pulmonary problems, shortness breath lung blockage - vastly different unrelated problems. Covid 19 Bill Gates' hoax! least every month get faces remind get shit together. explain temperature screenings theatrics? Protests? shows ready large scale reopen. 2.5% population would 22.5 million cases United States. sure. Although even though staunch supporter universal health care, complicated system doubt could implemented instantly crisis without causing harm good. fresh Uighurs. lol would get exploited badly bad faith state govs. They'd finding way possible kick black families it.  Still could mutate become seasonal flu. people could get twice anyway. Source WaPo saying highest record. Nothing it. without financial help government. Every business still forced open lose everything. Well need wait months year studies come out. people got infected March/April nearly enough time passed people perform correct studies. 

What read SARS-1. perfect, it'll give idea possible virus uses ACE2. Unfortunately one situation depend others wearing masks protect health. probably flattened vertically 3 4 weeks  This.

My life philosophy regret least. governor I'd shut even lost election want thousands needless skeletons closet Funny call Americans “stupid” write sentence makes absolutely sense. Lol u cannot stop smoking good u reduce it.
If hard get bed, try isometric muscle contractions, like using calf muscles without moving foot. help venous flow lower legs may reduce risk thrombosis enhancing blood flow, venous blood flow largely moved muscle pump.

Btw two kinds people, mentally ill know mentally ill dont know it. also belong former category. ;-) Cases US already spiked lol. guys upramp second wave already. hardly anything prevent spread virus. second wave likely higher first since USA shit job suppression. I've comparing graphs province vs USA difference insane.

As someone lives Canada, baffles guys poorly. follow media, gov't guidelines there, used common sense stayed home, wore mask going grocery shopping, washed hands lot esp picking take-out. easy. Sure, see friends while, fuck cares, text, jump discord, game....

The USA fucked up. hospitals full. even caring elderly risk? Everyday hit new record high. look data, isn’t lot consistency many places backs fact scientists still learning fact country disaster terms resources coordination response. 

If look world perspective, successful countries far stuck lock downs, social distancing masks universal. country zero consistency president wants way. Again, that’s super couple places seem show success, it’s trending wrong direction overall. Wisconsin, Indiana, etc outliers long outbreaks continue spread. phased plans consider short term, long term success. Wisconsin lower peak hasn’t consistent enough even recent time satisfy phasing (same Indiana matter). lots selfish people clamouring worry themselves. need stop funding testing, tests, new cases. /s ...for June. still paid July. Hard say got it,  worry same. packaging, lasts 3 days pretty long time. usually keep non perishables floor 4 days wipe perishables alcohol.  Can't use, like, injection? Sounds promising /s Dr Drosten called it: hammer dance. First smack virus harsh measures then, know it, attack elegantly. 🤣 World War 2, citizens asked ration oil, meat rubber fight Nazi Germany, Italy Japan. also encouraged plant vegetables grow “victory gardens” federal government. I’m even memeing “people today would weak storm Normandy”, people today would weak normal person war.

EDIT: literally everything rationed. Ah well we're talking two different things. Looking graph starting turn upwards point trying make. people Canada thought better make money COVID benefit continuing work. They're regretting now.

They quit job make extra couple hundred benefit. problem lockdown going last years, months best. They're making fortune here. lockdown they're going need find job. They're looking job, low skill worker job market competing high skilled labour lost jobs. 

These people really fucked they're realizing can't get job benefit runs soon. extra $2000. Long run they'll probably lose plus end killing chickens bunch immigrants since job willing hire them. region Spain, people start taking things seriously government shut schools. implication democracy flaw people vote self-interest. That's argument justifies many dictatorships. Exactly got another 1.5-2 years left. I’m going first vaccine either thats like 6 months extra. Susan Collins would think travel ban tourism includes layovers. know American bombarded Cloth Masks Save Us propganda shit show political partisan divide weeks effective source control method many Americans seem think. 

**Maintain social distance 2 metres**. 

That little $5 - $10 piece cloth face fucking hazmat suit, allow 90%+ particles pass become less effective looser times move it. people know like bands 40’s. Arizona currently 20% positive rate less tests won’t drop number would actually make worse Call National Guards implement hard line plan. sure? Please link information proves this. good news true. hate doomsday person

Then be. death rates even nothing stop spread classifies doomsday scenario. Lots deaths? Yes. alone make doomsday. supposed spend two weeks Singapore early March cancelled flights worried COVID. Really wish I'd gone ahead trip now. Technically true, vastly far away Everyday hit new record. canada's getting taste right now. need hire someone dogshit basic work $22.50 hour nobody biting 20 hour week gig, taxes less they'd get CERB.

I get it, much pro UBI, interesting see plays Please sign petition help us make masks mandatory Georgia. [link need help get governor fucking Brian Kemp. don’t go depth artist. like song listen it. believe don’t believe effect weather song good not.

Edit.. unless something illegal. thought static-x's lead singer dead. dead. Germany seeing increase. fully agree you. bots ridiculous. G0tta t4pe l1ke 7his guy lost leg

do legs grow back now? Would someone please show peer reviewed paper showing experimental science mask-wearing prevents spread covid infectious diseases public settings store, street beach? Models wrong since started. state winning open. open still defeat virus. Idk states seeing increase. I’m talking number case load positivity percentage based many tests do. beating it. done. cannot indefinite closure country. don’t understand people don’t understand that. death rate falling making headway track positivity rate instead number cases may find state testing finding cases rather cases appearing. thought thing found sub specific states corona virus winning. finding cases one huge city it’s wayyyyyy testing called WH. Thats plan chance I'll ever take clearly hurried vaccine, political influence already exerted FDA even without breeds mistrust. antivaxxer least would catastrophe institution, public health, reputation vaccines whole :( need reopen another bit storing number hospitalizations. agree international travel. also expect large stock housing market crash I'm honestly surprised responsibility apartment complexes. bet crickets fucking slammed though. 
 sucks. Somebody said said. Well, hello!

You're person I've heard willing cut expensive sheet make proper mask.

Do link U Chicago study? saying everybody gets help. get help? exact number. Also long help last stops. exact number also. I'm getting tired hearing people complain giving answers. comment absolutely nothing would said someone dumb. dumb person would say offers solution. Guess makes you. could make comment complaining something even say think happen? stupid. something child would do. contributes nothing conversation. child? Sorry are. go ahead attack instead something productive answering first 2 questions. know much ask. I'm getting tired listening kids crying. Go cry somewhere else. Covid-19 reshared! blame people creating people. course Peer review lol. Proper peer review happening often enough pandemic, world researching like mad people putting much info ahead peer review could take ages point. 

That said, there's far [multiple organs impacted called damage explicitly. appear directly affected virus treatments needed hard well. end needing 

The damage lungs given. seen anything kidney transplants used (although surprised changes) month first person US got [lung due damage virus caused. countries giving [lung well. Primary secondary schools essentially Petri dishes. teach low socioeconomic district. lot students live least one grandparent. really worry exposure. Thats plan people like staying home paid working. It’s rocket science.

No way go back lockdowns knowing know now. CFR estimate CDC 0.26%. people 70 [it’s Isolate vulnerable put everyone else back normal life. know Trump's polling shitter assuming Trump win reminds Hillary 2016.

Voter suppression gerrymandering cheating etc win Trump, could refuse give power.

All attitude spread complacency ppl may bother voting ""in bag"". Yea point more, “hey there’s things (along reading talking people technology) don’t wake dawn bring year’s harvest it’s 1920 we’re farmers. Perspective. literally feel like I'm one understands happening. reddit, would probably gaslighted believe ok. insane feel like insane one.  huge jump Tulsa county, OK.

its 4 days since rally. Funny enough states hit 100k deaths day protests He's afraid voted out. nearly got Ted Cruz last election (should have). Rubio kicked curb next. That's crazy hearing name many years. cousins Samari, Brian, Antrel also played NFL.

I remember Samari well gator fan. beast Florida State hated him... field lol

Samari almost died plane South Africa door fly plane. Interestingly enough plane two former Gators. like guess too. Hey, sudden numbers starting look lot like early IMHE predictions 140-220K.

Nobody could seen coming. Would rather? No. Would actually? Yes. NY kinda is. We've pretty much contained virus. need keep masks we've shown long go back life 80% normal still containing virus. can't wait 'till Easter! Miraculously disappear. Glad live real world human contact. try it. calling ugly?  That’s big problem. people rush go “live lives” means everyone else rush “serve” even it’s unsafe makes unsafe! one, millions jobs destroyed rather lost ie massive long-term unemployment rate No. lockdown. Deal it. Less 1% die, probably not. beyond sad infuriating could control losing hundreds thousands million Americans. angry county right now. Look further. Hillsborough county (1.4million pop) somehow shedding 816 total ICU beds 2 hours make available ICU bed percentage better is. Parks beaches probably ok. ""Trump saved us virus thanks British vaccine created"" Yeah edgelord 14 year old cuck like guys. That's key They're words screen lot idiots world yes. amount people community (in US) still defiantly wearing mask public astounding me. People claiming personal choice, saying type left wing agenda, claiming wearing mask Walmart detrimental health. We're definitely going another spike US lot people care what's best neighbors. Morons projected 60k deaths one point. Lmao. Yes, really. lot distilleries switched producing hand sanitizer since equipment already.

70% aka 140 proof ethanol amount needed disinfectant properties. Beer usually 4-8%, wine usually 10-20%, mixed drinks often diluted 15-20% well. Wait, thought hoax??! OK protest long violently scares people away. forced stay bed, barely breathing, month would letting virus control life. I'm trying that. Number cases doesn’t matter. Track positivity rate. declines you’re decrease  don’t feel sympathy him. top taking virus seriously, wants public pay medical bills, public didn’t give fuck roaming around without caution. People like make fucking sick. Fuck dude. also find funny didn’t mention go fund caught Covid sharing drinks bar like idiot. absolute tool guy is. 100%. whole pandemic taught vast majority people fucking boring and/or lack drive. 

Yeah, activities can't done currently, find many things do. internet, one greatest things mankind ever invented terms information output. learn literally anything want. learn new craft dive new hobbies. Everything ever complained time for? learn right free time.  govenor, probably lifetime winning popularity contests regardless specific skills morals. Losing popularity losing identity. dad kids’ school believes vaccines bad pharmaceutical companies hire assassins murder doctors speak them. 

There fixing level stupid. sound like great sibling. I've updated post make clear I'm talking fatigue. hear you. entire country shutdown. Imo areas cities shutdown reason lack testing resulting lack line sight local epidemic / community spread + fear outcome. probably necessary time. Now, virus actually spread across nation want ""reopen"" many areas STILL adequate access testing. Blows mind. Shutdown need to, fear. Know community spread. testing. Save peoples lives economy brain. 

If dive wave early going get hit wave. See wave, dive right time. everybody go time? No, bc wave yet see people beach going bc thats they're at. 

Gee, see everyone going maybe I'll same... breath air... booom. Hit wave. reassuring factoid time things looking terrible overall. People eat shit up!   Post real article instead worthless blogspam: mention gaping holes lot state's people get fucked assistance. Wait, sharing drinks crowded bar ALSO spread virus? There's much remember. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

USA Brazil duking worst response worst government leadership world. emerge victorious? find next week Earth-2020. report hairdresser Covid required clients infected 2 140.

The real propaganda 2 meters, useless indoors. Makes sense, Arizona control numbers trending well right??? /s Probably knows (a) never *truly* shut nationally first place... (b)... late. We're already back 30k cases per day, places still moving forward reopening.

At point think he's resigned saying ""wear mask... try smart... hope best"" but...... freedom? could airport people passing Taiwan connecting flights, flight itself? Good know, put round bottle hand sanitizer cupholder poll neets reddit? bit relief see little damage occurred. would had, know, username. That’s fair point. Even that, guess it’s risk management thing scientific community understands virus much better main attraction park playground, unfortunately still closed.

I may mask take beach. Gotta somethin... could predicted this? nothing race. caught bodycam beach wreckless they're able identify lose benefits. Period. Skin color damned. can't shut everyone outside, anyway! still understand wearing mask political issue. Wanting live political issue. experience.  building never closed, offered voluntarily took unemployment first day could.  received regular unemployment insurance CARES act $600 7 weeks returned work. continue receiving normal state unemployment insurance? Put 35% country don’t institute travel ban. He's debating it, obviously. delay least brought us extra understanding virus, let score bit PPE wife.

But everyone let guard down, sadly, case wise like nothing happened. Im home keep lungs safe

And Also 2.5m Bleak? Pretty heavy judgement there.

“Most world’s problems stem people’s inability satisfied company.” - heavily paraphrased Epictetus. stocked 99s Swine Flu thing. Cheap cloth masks...it's nice thought, anything actually filtering. I'd say that's reasonable guess, know. I'd interested see age determining factor well False. lot people miss cycle times this, initial cases 10 14 day look back infection deaths 4 7 week look back. keep mind 124,000 people already died this. Staying inside puzzle listening music talking phone friends nothing compared ventilator hospital, getting shot sleep police, streets, countries war torn people know sitting home still yield bomb bullets tearing home end everything despite nothing wrong. ""I've instructed share opinion opinion reasonable safety precautions"" lag increased cases increased deaths. Overall better know manage virus now, I'd still surprised see deaths increase near future. bottom falls economy even people die, we're digging hike multiple generations. lose lose, one lockdown mismanaged led effectively.   Hey, diss snakes ladders. Slowly. Seems like we’re high speed train going wrong direction. wife got labeled ""essential"" warehouse works sells herbal supplements dog outdoor gear... amount suddenly essential positions crazy. still working hazard pay. Agreed Yes, understand correctly. take personal experience, mass graves, convince motherfuckers. they'll say could do, spin. people A) point also spamming Cuomo’s Twitter calling grandma killer apparently he’s responsible every single nursing home death NY like poured vial liquid virons throats? Meanwhile defend POTUS said insinuated multiple occasions virus fucking hoax. cognitive dissonance unreal. country needs reckoning. Nah. Keep claw back limit high. actually stimulate economy. Low income people desperately need cash, they'll use food rent. would buy things anyways, help economy. family four parents able work home clear 175k them? thousand bucks gonna go straight additional spending absolutely backwards people say Americans can't even casually afford surprise $400 bill, let alone actual lockdown. Law

I'd never heard before. I've seen happening, know law. TIL Neither definitely option. Thinking simple binary choice determines whether you’re smart enough live giant source UV rays could blanket entire planet. course, would far away, maybe 93 million miles safety. mind another lock-down giving everyone cannot work $100k/year mark, monthly check things return normal people work without fear bringing home virus could kill whole family well themselves. people going homeless, starving death beautiful first world country like America. totally better this; strongest country world god dammit. would also excellent time see Universal Basic Income would work US. Even though circumstances obviously different state pandemic, still feel data could useful. disagree, I'm saying even mind paying back. I'm someone needs benefit it. Exponential. Americans can't seem understand exponential growth ones 1% keep taking/ getting tax breaks it. people gives Confidence Level 99% 3% margin error entire US population. Staying home able see anyone aside partner living life, actually.

This absurd. typing device presume camera, also ability virtually play arcade board games anyone world.

If social, that's fault. tools it. friends weekly Skype book clubs, movie dates, gaming events.

Is person socialization? Duh. seeing anyone else fault  surge capacity needed already end March, even lockdown would needed, comparison really appropriate. transfers made haste, briefings since April keep repeating military ready provide help transportation patients ICU capacity different remote regions vary significantly. Even literally dozens patients far entire period. made cleaning wipes Everclear. Smelled kinda funky though. 100%. here. 20/30 year olds aren’t wearing Columbus Bye, bruhs :'( Never got experience joy lockdown (unlike hubby sons), so-called essential worker, said, *not* adverse all. think would lot good. city county mandated masks, still, many people walk door, sans mask, act shocked befuddled politely asked comply. album amazing. Thanks! stopped reading realized duped! China short holiday period soon something acknowledged keep watch spikes. watching country similar policy(local travel). If?? Sadly doubt will. They'll think democratic hoax get it. wonder whether anti-mask stance Trump intuiting base's reaction, following lead. Yeah, like look Scomo, massively reviled Australia disastrous handling bushfires people finally starting see bullshit far right agenda was. handled Coronavirus even halfway competently, he's probably sail next election, absent new horrific blunders.

That could Trump November bothered even bare minimum seeming like leader. even fix virus, could thrown money helicopter like tin pot dictator knows election year. original CARES act $2000/month every citizen unemployment rate went 5%, bet approval rating would 5 points higher right now, cares eventually pay it. Eh. I’m completely burnt quarantine hobbies. spend one day quietly watching TV baking bread doodling taking walks whatever fuck i’m going scream. I’m huge extrovert literally cannot healthy without socialization, zoom calls really aren’t cutting anymore. allowed one normal weekend visited boyfriend 1 friend I’m terrified I’m sick. 

So looks like I’ll locked inside, terrified depressed, foreseeable future. Sounds like doom gloom leadership failed us. would give anything normal life that’s dead now. feels like I’m either going die virus live long enough see everything makes life worth disappear. Seriously, rock under? ok, really selfish ignorant culture album amazing. problem, virus care borders. 

Idaho experienced biggest uptick one day ever yesterday, rushing “stage four” basically “everything fully back normal, consider washing hands please.” It’s pointless places trying hard others don’t give shit - especially long incubation asymptotic carriers there’s way know true number infections. lot law enforcement refusing jobs get OC spray back, too. Exactly. states absolutely (I speak own-we lot, deficit start we're poor af) federally? Nada. Headline ""Nearly 180,000 Americans die coronavirus October 1.""

The ""unless"" condition pretty much unlikely as:

\- unless meteor wipes humanity that

\- unless Trump beats Bill Gates IQ test never horses barn first place! Hey it’s smaller government preaching for. None big institutions gotten money. Almost gone consumers first. Wasn’t like equivalent $20,000 per American? would paid credit cards bought bunch stuff would ended hands big businesses anyway. Two weeks mass protests. Hmmm... live around stark/summit county, i’d say i’m honest there’s maybe 25% mask usage. Mostly older people wearing masks makes mad younger people typically don’t. mention that’s mostly downward trend cases month six weeks back actually case count going down. breaking numbers shit new cases daily, likely spell good things future fatality numbers  Same. I’m sure thought “crazy” pandemic - color crazy day regretful.

My feeling didn’t bust butt home schooling children quarter year, give toddlers speech therapy via video (my job), husband’s job giving salary one week on/one week right act like meant nothing. People still things spread virus. heard lockdown getting lifted like yeah right, I'll staying right another 2-3 weeks watch cases spike again. days lockdown lifted work wanted arrange lunch meetup. passed that, found later like 4 people showed up. (out potential 20~) earlier stimulus stuff something like 18k per American

5.9T?

You including fed reserves stuff too? Stop saying 'narrative', makes come across like conspiracy nut.

Also need provide sources claims.

Finally, kill mean get long term lung Data March 16, 2020, report Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) showing younger adults also getting COVID-19, requiring hospitalization, even intensive example, CDC report shows March 16, 2020, 508 people hospitalized COVID-19 U.S. these, 38% 20 54 years old. Half ending intensive care younger Officials Europe noting trend, reports half serious cases France Netherlands people age 50.

Notice used sources? flatten curve.  understand happened. 

- Pro-reopening crowd 90% full? France's cases going though. US upswing, exception Northeast. West stable, falling. rest country large seeing highest case count since beginning. someone lives New York, I'm hoping New York implements similar ban 49 states. least 25 prematurely lifted restrictions FREEDUM. someone like exposed covid, early warning WOULD save life. I'd get medical help symptoms overtook me. So, that's true all. mention half America right worried looking like cuck cave wear mask ride massless till spread everyone around them. state Victoria sealed borders residents can’t go states ferry rides Tasmania. I'll never able relive plot Eurotrip. Honestly, good.
We’re still world hotspot people sure shit won’t taking seriously.  Honestly, really would've looked stupid then. fact actually thought current government would respond appropriately shows much keeping what's going on. One parents would need home course. India locked quick, seemingly numbers started coming in.

Sweden interesting, made deliberate choice. know covid19 transmission learned initial statements masks. lie it, Fauci trying deceive people wearing masks. Jesus... said state bad right now... ask travel plans? vaccine made kind treatment, travel! But.... Several countries Europe significantly worse per captica numbers? Sorry Spain, traveling anymore? I'll take 50 50 shot anyday hope orders enforces it. way. Guidelines alone work. Well, outdoor dining interesting experiment, people know still skeptical outdoor dining. see even wary indoor dining Amazing left quick point fingers crowded rallies, bars, restaurants... standing shoulder shoulder crowd thousands half people wearing masks A-OK Add 2021 list. :) They're shuffling flights adding legs prevent cancelling reservations. According them, adding two additional legs significant change reservation warrant involuntary cancellation.

Yeah, airlines suck. US hospitals undeniably world class. They're generally considered pretty bad among Western countries. Yes, absolute top 1% American hospitals (Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, etc) world-class absolute best world. vast majority American hospitals generally average OECD standards. dealing infectious diseases general piss-poor endemic MRSA US hospitals laughingstock world even Covid-19. know people gotten sick vacation US *paid* exorbitant air ambulance fees evacuated back Canada rather US healthcare sytem. ""*Houston*, *we problem*"" cases spread first states highly concentrated nursing homes (a high risk population).

Well, given screwed testing beginning, would think CV obvious nursing homes. probably spreading pretty much way radar original clusters, throttled certain extent various shutdown measures. hard see wasn’t nursing homes affected tests incredibly restricted.

Given easily uncontrolled spread infiltrates vulnerable communities, would pretty surprised nursing homes don’t blow areas less affected originally. :/ hope I’m wrong that, though. would game changer protocol would ACTUALLY able protect vulnerable groups, even largely uncontrolled spread amongst general population. wish could ban people coming New York. We’re handling pretty well.. Southern morons coming going destroy progress. 😫 Aside SEC schools schools don’t care students need football revenue think lot colleges might this, it’s certainly one thing everyone quarintined campus, it’s another close contact people schools extended period time. planning visiting mother fall... haven’t seen year already.. fuck Trump.  Ummm isn’t tides work? Tides go down, hit low tide, rises. peak won’t high, cases rising couple weeks hospitalizations rising week. seeing inflection point deaths.


To fair might one day blip deaths, that’s pretty unlikely given surges cases hospitalization half country. nice downward trend. not, place while. state zero cases, local transmissions. Southern states cases opened soon 10+ new cases day. Masks, helpful, nowhere close 100%. would anyone risk children's lives theme park? Hopefully next year better. feel bad people babies children now. Use dern heads. wonderful word used raising kids, parents may used too: NO. Followed nothing. no. Canada done same. economies dependent travel restrictions severe already are. Best isolate cases spring best possible. EU huge compensation program nations. Yes, Germans pay most, think it’s ok circumstances.  Maybe virtual political party going soon. reliant us you. That's simply trade network works. *global economy* works. 

We rely survival. already pointed out. 

You utter moron, every post make keeps proving everyone that's read single textbook. think making fun COVID deniers. hope making fun them. BLM addresses systemic racism police violence

""Poor Lives Matter"" would assumedly cover *classism* different problem. may intersectionality two, conflate issue. Oh much testing virus there, according Trump logic

*We're good job* live south mass ( near two prominent venues state ) besides see people FB town groups people good it. stores mess around mask policies ive seen good 50% people seem wearing masks outdoors general. Although neighbors recently threw 20 person plus maskless get together social media shows people age giving zero fucks going parties. still seem limiting social circles taking moderately seriously.  Anyone word might happen flights Canada UK? supposed move June. August. later August I’m sceptical ban won’t get pushed back again. Heckuva time giant entire life change planned. situation bad enough there's need go further. models one leading health centers area, know App what?? Based information time masks priority healthcare workers everyone else. realized primary vector transmission became clear crucial masks reducing transmission.  lie. betting person, would bet neither Disney World Disneyland open originally announced.

Disney company extremely cognizant image corporate higher ups weighing financial benefit opening Disney limited basis versus extremely high odds kind outbreak centered Disney. 

Even best precautions, portions theme park experience like bathrooms would remain problematic.

Disneyland Disneyworld areas currently spiking. SoCal disheartening soon social distancing restricted, people went wild - everyone course enough cases spiking.

I realize Covid19 seems less transmittable measles widely reported measles outbreak Disneyland years ago disease high levels vaccination thus normal herd immunity protects idiots vaccinate poor souls immunocompromised. wait till pack kids classrooms August. Texas Lt Governor Dan Patrick:

[Patrick heavily criticized last month suggested interview Fox News' Tucker Carlson senior citizens might willing die save economy. stood statements new interview Carlson Monday night, saying, ""We crushing economy.""---""And said night, important things living. that's saving country children grandchildren saving country us,"" Patrick said Monday  ok facts getting downvoted? There’s difference saying people especially vulnerable, saying they’re fault. Sounds like we'll get monoclononal antibodies next months goes well. Problem is, think produce things scale treat enough patients year. 


We really need vaccine... Here's hoping get EUAs Oxford vaccine USA starting September. working hard...thanks!  EU gdp 18 trillion though??? understand they’re online check-in limit contact. silver lining *the hope* disastrous resurgence finally wake Americans ""just flu"" types crawl hole stfu. rate change cases unacceptable. Something needs done gets hand. can't dick around exponential growth! time close things opened like indoor gyms, viable safe alternative exercising outside. Perhaps subconscious fear intelligence. Doctors usually ones wearing masks doctors viewed intellectuals. could see may want accidentally viewed someone yeehaw good ol boy. worst case... 10 million dead. 20-40 million lingering issues. yeah, would bottom.  Mainland Chinese tourists give run money. Thanks! pretty :)  huge problem NY state pretty much separates New England states rest country.

Florida really issue people traveling *through* get one state another.

I mean, need drive Pennsylvania New Hampshire, pretty much drive New York get there.

Now, make point people making interstate trips pandemic, I'd agree...but commerce reopening, people trips Leisure, commercial travel well.

In words, sure institute ""quarantine"" act law whatever, shutting borders travel would pretty tough state like New York It'll interesting see ""Glass Menagerie"" ego'd president responds one. possibility call blabla? Fuck... go back Switzerland. liked that, check short fiction. He’s probably best known novel, *Slaughterhouse Five*

Edit: 2BR02B Big Trip Yonder, specifically. Vonnegut great dark sense humor. dystopian short fiction set weird future pharmaceutical product, Anti-Gerisol, completely stops aging process consumed person. means nobody ever dies, society must find ways cope reality. Great stuff. president still saving lives right? That’s said Tulsa. that’s hero’s do. Save lives. Yeah, kept sure screen borders create temporary quarantine facilities. Hypothetically, ban, we'd extend Italy Italy's cases explode, needed worldwide. Yet also said August would safe kids staff return schools person. Ahhh shit Wait virus go away Easter? Sure heat would killed now. Must fake news, must reporting flu cases Covid. 15 Zero time, winning.
/s Hahahahaha okay reliant us. fuck China cause we're giving greedy. guys fuck us complete survival. controversial, fact. live well attached America biggest fucking economy world. Without us would Islamic Jamaica lol China lied us first place... takes smart dedicated people find cure something unprecedented facing, US congress dead gone ones charge solving issue. want help, kind fellows matter creed color. 

If really want help support women community.   sending pizzas straight corona wing? not, would someone front desk mad? stop pushing bullshit propaganda. here. want anyone relaxed ""no big deal"" Trumpy mindset coming state making bad again. (Mass.) blame countries allowing Americans right now. embarrassed us, sick looking stupid orange fuck White House speaking country. Disney puts guna print suggesting take Tocilizumab symptom onset? face masks saves lives, surveillance app doesnt Well, think Apps great job here. German app started last week already nice download numbers. Right, issue death rate, collapsing health systems, people going get treated missing well. I'll preface saying I'm American, I'm Canadian, province pumping 20k+ tests sub 300 hits (in Ontario) well week we're actually seeing decline means start considering slow phased reopenings, been.

Even small percentage people die hospitals fully staffed fine, doctors nurses overworked dying disproportionately, whose going replace them? like pick Joe Shmoe street train doctor decades time. leads second point, mistakes errors extended periods stress healthcare workers causing deaths.

Focusing death rate disservice healthcare workers themselves, they're fighting every goddamn day order keep low possible, pushing extremes, work 20 hours straight, accidents going happen. patients otherwise would've done routine stuff gonna get hurt collateral, also creating seriously traumatic environments entire medical staff, regardless age patients die, doctor pronouncing multiple deaths shift traumatic. Imagine realizing accidentally contaminated something room immunocompromised patient cause exhausted fuck think straight minutes hour 17 shift, led death patient actually got know last weeks. shit go away vaccine ready, levels damage done healthcare systems worldwide jackasses thinking nothing themselves.

Source : friends doctors, nurses, COVID ICU patients alike. mask lobby real medications money Big Pharma  Good. I’m American don’t think accept us. would bad move  Fuck guaranteeing jobs, guaranteeing universal basic income way go. don’t need everyone working need system handle high unemployment. High unemployment goal, wasting limited life slave money food shelter ideal. arrested people violating quarantine, yes. Yep, back end outbreak open ended move Lombardy style lockdown, even take month cases subside red zone. right Polish guy living UK work immigrant expat, guy south America living US immigrant expat, Turkish person living Germany? Somali Sweden? Tunisian living France. expats, gotcha. open quickly, either. Still reopening phases, even 2 weeks past outdoor dining allowed. Yep, bad dictator lot damage good dictator good. good dictator might speed progress country, bad dictator might commit genocide. I’ll take slower progress means genocide table. disputing saying, SARS virus. infectious previous one though. They’re already it. unfortunately caught minutes Tucker Carlson some
Doctor screaming Europe needs “remember mid 20th century”. Ffs number number unknown countries globe? May issues coming back? country Portugal enlightened despots throughout history, however they're rare. Yeah surprised people never understood this. real centralized plan contain mitigate virus economy mostly recovers three months.

Or whole country says f-CK it, send everyone 40 Coronavirus camp get close herd immunity, would even better. would batshit crazy we’d behind us 6 months.

But half country staying home trying stay safe half country runs around trying make profits lead maximum economic pain alongside maximum health impact I'm Charleston. see fewer people wearing masks time leave house. Cases increasing rapidly I've heard thru grapevine hospitals filling up, cases diverted Roper. Nobody gives shit, tourists vacation mode employees need work pay bills small businesses can't get funding continue closed so... really fucked least we're getting stickers. Hahahaha all. one touting reddit upvotes. I'm shootin shit. party better move soon lest destroyed internally Anti-Christ. *billion*

You’re orders magnitude there. It’s $14B unspent unaccounted for. European citizens currently America? Huge bureaucracy reason act quickly. easy close get closer opening date based really going on. think assumed US would horrendous state like EU Shanghai controlled social distancing experience possible.

I never underestimate venality greed corporations Disney iconic image enormous goodwill squander compared Universal feeling childhood complete without visit Disney. live SoCal visits Disneyland mandatory visiting nieces/nephews even essentially young excited ""Disney"" per se - would happy kiddy park. Universal done bit older started outgrowing Disney :-) Except China actually funded additional testing. copy wrong things China doing, completely ignore strategies many countries proven working, saving lives saving economy. CCP like 90 million members... valid passport particular country cannot deny entry country. may trouble finding flights may quarantine upon entry cant denied entry citizen. sure get math testing capacity increase. least California testing capacity order maginitude greater march. think nationally 5-6x 3 months ago. Plus sure using all. see tons free testing drive compared march tough get tested.

&amp;#x200B;

Key thing point contact tracing capacity. dont think done effectively. lockdown going eliminate virus unless WUHAN level lockdown impossible. Biggest problem messaging Trump. done job CIC co-ordinated states testing contact tracing could done well Germany France. Instead among worst better Brazil :-( significantly wrong US's government system Twitter, Facebook Google things exist.

I mean, Twitter, Facebook Google available places, many places arent bad US. Good luck existing without American military protecting borders. backup road trip PNW, honestly heart isn’t it. I’m incredibly disappointed. second 100K quicker saying happening yes. mean, get treatment except pay hotel. hell people influenced much wives they're superstar one richest athletes world wife ..... one?

something tells already thought way that's married. whenever vaccine tried tested mandatory distributed. might well year now. 8.7 mil prob died complications due it. hitting AppleBees squad weekend.. jk.. lot people still think way don’t care Right are. bad. American like travel... I'm ok this. response government abysmal... fire nation attacked Well look equity market tell impact capital ownership? Testing going lowered starting July... Texas numbers sudden drop lmao employees would still risk. seem fair risk life min wage job. 

Risking someone else's life fun me. Seems bit sociopathic. Enforce quarantine way back. citizen traveled trivial reasons, force hotel 2 weeks expense. 

I know would go well boobulas want breathe, yet can't go outside hanging out. Maybe could go masks them? getting upset sweetie? News paper headlines often omit small words, like ""was"" case. Smart move Germany, things controlled laws!

Yeah, Jew ovens. I'm sorry, dude. :( boyfriend same. canceled May trip, I'm starting think get see year. Whoa. like America got case herpes still trying sex people up. you...

Are actually insane?

You think literally welding people's doors shut forcing stay inside threat death is... *democracy*?

What fuck wrong man. Hahahaha pathetic. Yeah rest morons reddit cheering on. accomplishment . I'd like formally apologize short-sighted window lickers cross border Canada. representative us, still great number. cant stressed enough. states implemented total lockdowns second, we'd still keep seeing rising cases least 2 weeks. 

And know states going wait long possible taking necessary action. imagine producing American passport customs EU would pretty easy catch. Supermarket staff even walk self checkout queue queue right using it. Wow  KarenWorld Maybe disabled but, hobbled. people lose lung capacity permanently significant number cases productive workers may productive. Best luck, I'm hoping end year. long time always dug heels living abroad far family finally turned recently said ""fuck this. Life better elsewhere."" hope get great job safe move! NY didn’t flounder response America would competing Germany lowest infection numbers.

I see nursing homes related spread rest country. assuming radical change infection population demographis today vs 2 weeks ago?

Furthermore, places like Houston, TX, reported hospital beds exceeded next week so. Young not, there's bed, treatment, people die regardless young are. 

Moving regular treatment denial treatment due triage step change far significant age shift. triage rules, mortality skyrockets critical case becomes hospice case rather potential recovery. went bankrupt tried looking work elsewhere, that’s fault lol much problem class race. back pre-existing conditions totally fucked getting health-care, uninsured aunt would get meds prescribed vet horse. get filled pharmacy far know never questioned lizzie horse cholesterol blood pressure meds Well, it. Another record breaking day.

6503 new cases

3868 hospital patients

L.A. particularly looks F'd. rest SoCal look great either. Hey mods, going remove heavily upvoted lie? thought misinformation serious issue sub? right, looked data while. [The latest numbers Black Americans represent 12.4% population U.S., suffered 24.3% known COVID-19 deaths—i.e., dying twice population share. hope May trip affected. live Stanislaus County everyone already forgot virus 😂. Funny one downvoted sugar. you... stop... testing... then....

Wait, fuck supposed keep people ICU? Ugh, country lost hard work nothing. 2 months lockdown completely pointless. Well divert funding poor companies. Many us New York still going check family, buy essential items, go work essential worker. rates plummeted, opening cautiously. family Campania, communicate regularly. seems like New York two weeks behind Italy fight COVID. Unfortunately, likely difficult time maintaining low infection rate. Americans states failed responses Coronavirus want come New York safety potentially carrying virus them. \*Edited today marks second day deaths US 90%.

Only wonder jet heres mention this, oh wait, it’s positive news there’s money fear mongering made good news.  increase tests counting. counting hospitalizations. counting ICU. counting dead. counting 'recovered' patients debilitating new long term health issues. All's good full reopening. still people believe Covid19 hoax. makes sense me. Look people get kids vaccinated. get flu vaccine. child polio vaccine first came out. got school. Trust believe every parent wanted kids get vaccine. Maybe incoming generation growing mess sense. astonishing completely wrong reddit act shame whatsoever. Np hope work well! big family gatherings. family I’ve seen person almost 4 months parents (who likely already live, it’s actually safer laundry home live) brother, lives parents.

Believe me, I’d love see 90 year old grandmother, know it’s safe understand statement also Bill's place work (3000+ workers) not.shut down. choice go work and.we even pulling time shifts.  nothing medical field not.only kept running working more. Nahhhh better that. Fuckers social distance all, APART bloody checkout queuing. people push past queues... gotta space queue man, queue sacred. long stand miles apart queuing that's need do. Apparently. surely does, one part reason obesity rates much higher among blacks closely tied concepts institutional racism: food deserts, lack access healthcare, poor education, etc. Agree America leading country medical territory.Sorry hear know still hard get mask cleaning supplies. Please let know need help. heard American friends said half people America refused wear mask thought mask enough supply people buy it....I wrong. America arrange mask factory production, would great... literally proves point...  Oh reason article gets posted upvoted like crazy week like clockwork? feel you, I'm stuck country leave able come back business life now.

I get things happen case measures losen seriously think plan B. might lucky subjected mandated quarantine China seem part plan moment. role healthcare professionals provide advice economy. can't name single thing done differently maybe best case scenario. seems bit odd zero suggestions improvement time trying argue situation handled poorly. Wait there's second half mean, I've following rules boyfriend. We're allowed unhappy see boyfriend couple times per year. already know greater good. Let complain, sheesh.

Edit: also live anyone, there's grandma's life extended here. colloquial meaning changed since cold war era dude, areas US poverty rivalling see impoverished African nations. dad super-spreader  tried explain almost month ago. 20k US daily cases 14k NY NJ. cases dropped 90% national daily cases dropped 10%. Nobody seemed understand meant things getting bad everywhere wasn’t NY NJ. 
Now they’re worst we’re getting started. 

Refrigerated trucks streets NY hold piles bodies people. two goddamn months ago. Try remember something. good far agree. think time goes people get careless unwilling backtrack reopening. vaccine takes 6 months-1year, don’t think stay diligent long enough. think states reach herd immunity vaccine immunity. Could wrong though we’ll see Exactly, first got really easy. lockdown lived like virus bc thought hoax. Now, everyone getting sick realizing oh shit real... it’s prob late anything bc already spread like wild fire It’s California. They’ve decriminalized knowingly giving someone HIV. Well least Americans don’t travel EU EU gets second wave, won’t Americans blame. Today ""Everything *we* correct, everything *you* wrong. Even they're things"" widespread mask use, social Distancing, contact tracing, least Biden speaks fine. It’s trump (no exaggeration) [shows signs dementia 

Without question, trump neurological issues. 100% Don’t know consider relevant...

However live Denmark’s third biggest city almost everyone outside socializing. difference however, there’s hand gel every public building restaurant. diagnosed back like 2010. basically intermittent wet cough go away several weeks. Would cough several times day otherwise felt fine. Finally got fed cough saw doctor. Lo behold, waking pneumonia. Really I’m really struggling think many Floundered response forcing nursing homes take positive covid patients killing 5k elderly.... We’re even supposed leaving counties let alone states let alone countries right now. Plz keep everyone safe reasonably possible. 🤙 See difference us I've provided source literally points ways nations intertwined reliant other. 

Meanwhile making run-on sentences fingers ears without providing single source supports claim would collapse entirely without you. 

Prescription drugs?  

Oh mean ones made guys want import since they're cheaper? Thanks bringing topic up, since refute one minute.  

You're spewing shit point throwing shit wall hope least one thing sticks. ain't guy. 

Wanna talk entire mask fiasco months back too? know, ones made natural materials? ones exist manufactured you? 

I'm done arguing you, clearly even going read sources, let alone provide *one single* source show would collapse. 

Enjoy CoVID spike incoming. I'm gonna enjoy reopening. Let's hope Sweden finally gets grip pandemic. thought us faired better Europe combining western European countries compare population US? 🦼? Im American but....you guys dont already states Covid? Even countries small outbreaks restricted travel states isolation periods travel. None mandatory station guards outside home 24 hours 14 days. Time vacation Mexico.  don’t disagree. Fuck us, suck. 60k deaths August worst. Noooo please big mouthed Honestly no. took vitamin D3 hammer got sick. forever credit short duration sx. Goddamn A-hole Honestly I'm game days. something do. Uhmm.. fantasy? virus real, still around, still threat public health..


I'm waiting dangers lessen. Actually, less worried concerned healthy carrier could accidentally infect someone less healthy, and/or immuno-compromised... 

 Basically, I'm selfish prick whole thing. Haircuts coffees baseball wait; I'm boring cant keep occupied months. Like, entertainment personal feels far less important public safety.  sort idiot asshole thinks they're important Humanity's health whole?  Takes special kind self-centered douche think&amp;act way.

A vaccine isnt coming soon, think means ok let dangerous variable public health?


That's really fucking stupid you. pretty self-centered. Right?! living 5 years, found armadillos live around apartment complex. Hah, agree response lackluster (and I'm BC generally considered good). contract tracing, testing is... tests available? cover locations covid infections happen (Dr Bonnie, sell out... what's job BC Health Minister? people economy?)

I appreciate morning briefings PM. really hope daily briefings accessibility PM hot topics continued trend.

I looking global travel restrictions January. want anyone coming home China, elsewhere. Anyone rushing home interpreted danger. Quarantines also place January. no, ushered everyone home crammed airports, together. fuck quarantine. spent months getting manufacturing industries refitted (which know we've done well of). Top off, government ensuring safe experiences. Right lot stores whatever re-open stated standards. dentist morning, hygienist said everything's pretty much - delays rooms, etc.. oh wear face shields fancy new vacuum stick that's thick marker.

The nations considered handling well places like Taiwan New Zealand (among others who've gone far nations have). say Ron? like lot, :) Tom one love. like him. :P whole ""no worse flu"" thing even apply anymore official counts already surpass geographical mean estimated count influenza deaths worldwide already surpass highest estimates state's alone. Also estimates covid actual counts chances long surpassed lmao  American, support this. 

This country sucked monkey testicles pandemic. account something like 50-60% deaths

This bold faced lie. would lie something easily disproved? Per Atlantic, Black people 23% COVID deaths:  I've eaten enough flintstones vitamins I've become immune anything Yes. can't prevent people accessing parts country. even they're skeptical government. say without getting flagged mods... mixed signals coming government officials issue. Anyone paying attention see clear patterns science denial among them. *They too!!*

In way excuse shear pride history killing others hear many claim US *The Greatest Country Earth*. Expect anything, except normal 2020 US good democracy though? voting president fun pres can't even tell 3 letter agencies  
as US citizen way stopping gov say, overthrowing democratically elected leader bolivia, evo morales I'm Illinois feel way. Everyone stay away. every day. Matter fact, I've awake five hours now, time sleep. imagine much draconian EU's measures would pathetic non-existent federal response US, one wherein states left fend themselves, even going far fight supplies.

...Oh. like every 16trillion covid papers rushed since march. Well yeah, right respect means nothing him, change fact huge knob whole situation. shoppers aren’t *your* way, mind business. 

If get *your* way, step away smile say “excuse me.” pay test? so, much? America giving unemployment countries Same, saved lot travel beautiful EU guess I’ll stick pics   consider people 3 day That's interesting, thanks Gee Governor Abbot, hows whole “Our goal find ways coexist COVID-19 safely possible.” plan working you? douche, acting like one could seen coming Lol Imperial College’s vaccine also supposed early next year. Oxford’s vaccine grants immunity one year Imperial’s seems permanent. Unless ones permanent, companies might want wait Imperial’s Testing still huge problem areas virus longer sort control outbreaks going happening often lot new places.  time end federal testing. reopening last month holding steady.

Today announced protesters received free testing 2.5% tested positive. saying Trump hiding numbers good must okay China saying China, like Trump, bad hiding numbers? 

Is good bad Trump hiding numbers?  fucking irony. correct. Try talk people delaying response get excited, says he's giving us another check. Spend check dead. I'm asking ""better balance"" would looked like. can't even come better ratio would benefit hindsight, think reasonable expect people know three months ago. Leslie 100%. crazy go getter younger identify lot her. I've chilled lot lately, totally love portrayed. haircuts. Senator approved haircuts. certainly airports. China did. fuckload people manage yet have. DEATHS. Deaths % per population, etc. Literally important statistic. Read it. Says pretty much meds change mood cause kinds nasty physical side effects... didnt read anywhere side effect covid anxiety. Yep. EU acting bigoted objective fact matter Trump playing long game. Make America shitty Mexico country wants keep us out. trust now? Tired number cases. Californians Texans send disease away Mexico infect (poor) Mexicans. incident occurred 1984, probably less 75% current population Yep, painful, enjoy summer mostly. America two months hit, knew Italy would take way seriously - better - America would. thinking worldwide, bad. yeah, obviously rest world high death choo choo train! brakes. going high score? deaths? Visa waivers going absolutely last thing normalize. Even borders open up, people ""powerful"" passports going get used arranging visas advance. someone covid threw model showed cases flatlining 2nd half may on.

i reminded humans cyborgs would behave rationally folly predicting such. largest dam world happens would pretty bad news Downstream, downstream roughly four hundred million people supposedly kind hard find information whether thing structural problems not.

I really trust reassurance government also trust Western folks said damn good ever since built probably equal chance biased used variety things. role corticosteroids critical illness fairly complex (which reflected dexamethasone studies, difference mortality dependent classification cases). There's balance around choosing appropriate dose meets physiologic needs, also causing many detrimental effects. interested reading more, syndrome referred Critical Illness Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency (CIRCI) there's lot articles discussing it. That's head CDC lol!!! well work, far cleaning covid..?

and mean goop gwynth paltrow's vagina. can't stop crying. can't believe want anymore Well, I'm sure they're waiting for. cases continue surge Florida California Disney keeps calling Cast Members back opening hotels. opened Beach Club Villas Fort Wilderness Resort WDW yesterday. 

Given Universal open weeks, I'm guessing Disney backing down. There's way executives delay another month lose billions Universal sits open making money. I’m definitely perturbed lack mask usage Vancouver, time, number cases low provinces Canada, contact tracing becomes much effective reporting thousands cases day like southern states California... choice. it!!!!!!!, puuuullleeezzze one wearing mask UK, busy supermarket usually count maybe 4/5 people + tops masks He/she referring Lincoln county Oregon. direct link order: following individuals need comply People color heightened concerns racial profiling harassment due wearing face coverings public.

Here media reporting: Yeah half nursing homes failed protect them. median age new infections much lower. 

I disagree deaths going rise again. We’ll see though. good current position public health would left. literally longer alive.  walk away something like that. new dictionary definition stupid “Or really really wanna. - fuck - even kinda wanna” I'm boat. wait month-to-month basis I'll able see girlfriend extremely difficult. number COVID-19 cases rural tribal villages continuously increasing. Fuck. really want move wife. virus came worst time. Russian blood American Steel Look cases graph vs death graph. cases remained relatively flat deaths went dramatically. *necessarily* intertwined. advocating different balance struck. put many people work spent great deal money, we've still lost many lives. willfully misinterpreting said. better balance needed struck. better ratio. Would many people getting keep jobs price deaths? Would people destitute, saving many lives process? I'm sure. likely possible made better decisions. I'm one people making money unemployment job. feel little guilty it. live someone risk know I'll able work again. I'm saving much money can. active cases [apparently factor 'likely' recoveries Quebec - realize underreporting them, make sense daily cases steadily dropping, particularly Quebec, active cases pretty flat. Incorporating takes active cases 29K 6K, though I'm sure truth somewhere between.

That said, much done early days remains deeply strange me. whole masks thing, lack precautions early March break Quebec, variations provinces, etc. get it. may never get it.

Heck, even last week province (NB) briefly made masks mandatory public spaces. one day happy walked back. U.S. deaths rose yesterday vs. day week week first non-holiday since May 6 - 863 vs. 849 according worldometer. One day trend, good sign. 😢 Fuck Lol ridiculous thing debate can't take seriously. really think tiny nation 35 million would successful attached largest economy world? Get fuckin real man. ridiculous notion . mention subsidize military even need us protection. even get started prescription drugs. leeches bro. Plain simple. agree guess it. Keep tally American shit buy I'll keep tally Canadian shit buy we'll meet back December. Peace unto you. passports residency them? could work. Yeah, never saw handful people tested.

I guess NJ ahead curve lower new infections places country.

News today NY, NJ CT asking travelers current hot spots country self quarantine. tide shifted.

I wished dickheads realized lowering chance getting covid, lowering chances giving everyone else vacinity Even NJ people job refuse wear masks. It’s freedumb say. I’m getting feeling we’re completely screwed. Please don’t Swiss... bullshit. NY seen spike? Yes. know this. person we're talking to/about can't force anyone else wear masks they're best can. mask. Couple months. rally Trump. Abbott still anything. insane bad he's fucking up. I’m U.K. seemingly killed despite 900 odd cases day.
Not single soul gives fuck president openly done Corona.
Non ‘high’ numbers rattle seem like everyone stopped caring morbid, there’s definitely comedy sketch there. “Holy shit cases rising China! Oh shit they’re rising Germany! Oh shit they’re rising America” Thats claim made, lol look mad comments trying make something :) federal partners updated guidance identifying COVID-19 deaths, ADHS enhanced processes match. change may cause number new deaths reported dashboard increase expected days. Deaths shown bar chart COVID-19 deaths section dashboard using date death, day reported. New deaths summary section dashboard displayed day reported ADHS.

For 3+ months, sirens Ambulances tore streets respond multiple cases requiring hospitalization, constant. 2 weeks ago, slowed down, it’s trickle. Thank God. Everyone neighborhood wears masks. walked day Williamsburg waterfront 3 miles away like another world Covid didn’t exist though. 10 1, mask wearing vs non-mask wearing. f-ing weird. 

Mental-health wise I’m getting better. car totaled parked 3am last month treat. I’ve weaning anti-depressant last month struggle. Started working dieting week ago. 3-level ACDF surgery late last year basically exercise 6 months that’s helping also frustrating since it’s slow road back; especially I’m almost 50 yo. 

It feels like NY really side this. states reopened soon, didn’t mask practice social distancing...looking Texas, Arizona, Utah, etc., need ratchet things down; they’re rough Summer

Thanks letting vent. Stay healthy friend  know numbers decreasing I’m still terrified going back office. 9 hours stale air people don’t trust go socialize, constantly wear mask noses. anxiety killing me. I’ve lost two fillings teeth grinding past month alone. came Europe blocked coming China.

However go supermarket one wearing mask.. much good. could said last sentence better. would certainly explain lack general intelligence plurality people. already scared living country cuz cops, white supremacists, this...really sucks what’s immigration like New Zealand take me? work coronavirus lol Meanwhile, IRS still wired tax refund. I'm paramedic working Houston Fire Department. like first hand boots ground account fucked every single hospital within 1 hour driving radius overflowing patients. standing nurses desk middle one ER's monday night asked bad covid getting them. nurse stood pointed every single room ER, making circle, saying covid positive, positive, positive, positive, awaiting results, positive, positive, get picture. Really? TIL... cool, thanks! baffles shit doesn’t come naturally ***so many Americans***. Like we’d rather “Live free” rather spend months solitude everyone around us survive.

UVC wands everywhere end July. trying call out, curious infection would bad enough require hospitalization bad send home, thought may mentioned another post.

Understandably confusing describe living side globe post yesterday, especially considering decreased international travel days. Hope infection bad. Ah Western Strategy playing white west coast fears asians latinos. think data set thats represents mostly reopening state early signs protests well.

Last year watched one slow motion. Two lanes merging stop go traffic. Car right refused let semi left in. Semi couldn’t see little tiny car.... crunch. quite satisfying watch Come on, that's silly.

Very cool! right. think is? Lack information? Stubbornes? Lack education? You’re one preaching, me. mountains... lessons coming Fall teach us.

Fall? happening right learning shit. undoing small amount progress we've made. think hard getting people wear masks april may? going hundred times harder July August. fuck... thanksgiving shopping season months away. fucking wait. Prognosis... negative!!! mean? never heard Science? pre-eminent scientific journal. funny title article serves lede two articles. That's sounds funny. obesity rates Houston frighten comes success fighting covid conversation, troll start arguments. great day! telling people put mass lockdown months multiple measures taken minimise spread virus, virus infect lot people numbers start go down? telling stop lockdown open everything back virus starts spreading properly first time since locked see many people getting sick numbers slowly start rise eventually explode? way dude makes like zero sense. must something else like mutated strain something like 5G bet. fair, good advice.


People still leave kids animals cars unattended lengthy periods time 110 F outside.

We need reminders happen everyone rushed right away soon lockdowns eased, see mobility data: weeks since people actually started return anything resembling normal lifestyle, seeing rise cases hospitalizations increased movement now--right schedule, deaths follow following 2-3 weeks. 

The people memeing ""just wait two weeks"" exactly wrong, mistaken point wait flood people right things opened, waited feel safe going back it. necessarily. know early intervention critical. Remdesivir small effect. know controlling immune system beneficial. particular steroid may promising treatment, can, theory, prescribed covid patients already, since steroid treatment already happening. patients placed oxygen matters. Blood thinners also even known necessary patients beginning March, that's already big improvement.

Even super effective way treat virus itself, we've come long way managing treating symptoms, well identifying patients may require critical care.

Oh, almost forgot evidence showing blood plasma safe effective, another thing NY beginning outbreak. also recovered patients donating early days, simply identified mild moderate cases donate post-recovery.

In another 2 months, we'll probably even break throughs helping patients. Ya. one cares. Everyone thinks it’s big deal. It’s way people like watching movies, TV shows, theatre, etc. It’s competitive entertainment. Emphasis competitive. 

Plus fan sport team, feel like part something it’s something identify with. grew watching basketball Lakers entire life (due dad). Due love Lakers, played ball entire life(high school days fun) still I’m die hard laker fan it’s something identify proudly. Raiders. 3 states acting together. 

This like small petty kingdoms forming breaking alliances circumstances ebb flow. largest medical center world. I'm student medical school program telling us prepare worst next two weeks. source? able walk store unharmed that? alternative choice leader? 

No blanket state-wide policy. pre-covid evidence business closures drastic measures best delays infection peak bit, extremely disruptive. Locking full state forcing blanket policies everyone regardless local situation killed plenty people. You’re joking right? That’s literally opposite truth. Texas known freedom, exactly America about. weird lol tbh im starting follow suit well shouldnt Philippine Airlines, AirAsia, Qatar Airways *require* [flight wear hazmat suits New York one first states infect rest U.S., fuck right back. saw video that, one math YouTube... One brown, three blue think Probably depends gets elected. Please vote. like...the opposite conspiracy theory..this reasonable, likely-to-be-true-based-on-past-behavior theory. Yeah I'm sure. Virus going away actually. would like source well. Agreed I'm glad live Canada, yesterday Ontario (pop 14m) 216 cases first day 200 four days freaked out. Back 161 today. think I'm emotional breakdown, almost cried happy number back down. cannot imagine living Southern State. rising right highest day. Seems pretty stupid wait things really bad take action. Well number one. makes sense would lead. Yeah, mom worked immunotherapy trials. 

The head Nobel Prize medicine last year year before. I'm surprised anymore 28% ICU COVID cases. What’s growth last two weeks? absolutely force people face consequences so. laws. Wearing seatbelt law states. (Oregon) don’t care POC. Oregon used ban POC living think trying requiring wear masks? It’s shame. Cases never stabilized. stopped rising week two remained high. past two weeks seen steady increase it’s full blown surging upward. didnt US make mask production priority then?

And wouldnt general public wearing masks protecting health care workers due fact would spreading less healthcare workers would therefore see less infected patients? lol course.. always Star Trek's fault. Yep this.  482? rookie numbers country failing people again.

""Please slow testing"". I've watching Flight Conchords loop. going contact race many new cases day? gonna happen. California lower cases per capita states list except Texas much lower percent positive test rate recently moved new city post graduation haven’t able make new friends workplace still working remotely. wasn’t obsessively checking sub recently started feeling lonely. think it’s important stay informed important take care mental health. I’d stay it’s helping that. 100% guarantee that’s true. Seattle, military unit set field hospital CenturyLink Seahawks &amp; Sounders play. completely surreal see pictures military vehicles driving stadium en masse. isn’t “frustrated Americans” - conservative Americans. self-centered, racist people country. isn’t surprising see violence appropriate response getting way (despite ‘their way’ puts others risk.) Horrible people. White Mountain Apache tribe even worse Navajo right now. 10% population tested least good hear! Maybe things start turn soon (ish) least comfort knowing eventually restrictions hopefully wane. comment section shitshow downvotes lol. pro privacy anti-HIPAA. Frankly bar privacy needs raised across board way PHI falls general privacy mechanism.

HIPAA basically stifles innovation healthcare tech somewhat niche, aren’t many privacy focused vendors services could PII level scrutiny PHI. Looking back states New Jersey New York never universal stay home order. first manadatory mask order shutting bars, nightclubs, cruise ships stadiums. Also limit crowd size make comply social distancing rules. 

The universal stay home order forces many states use funding many business workers right beginning, right funding support business really needs closed. Also given much higher risk tolerance nature Americans, slowing spread virus Asian even EU levels basically impossible. Rather spend money business really needs shut year somewhat flatten curve introducing wide shut right start spend money supporting mass amount businesses. Oh man Im sorry, live CR everything back normal. almost everything want wear masks PA needs else people fly Philly drive NJ, NY. Yeah that’s I’m torn. unrest growing come white neighborhoods soon. Boston riots fact richest, whitest part town. high end shopping district got smashed good. Yeah, US leading coronavirus cases





(and police force sucks ass) One story heard workplaces now, one person tests positive whole work location get tested boost numbers greatly. Harris county serious trouble though way spin it. masks work...if goal protect getting sick. 

This strategy everyone wear mask. everyone wears mask, achieve goal. im sure people dont understand this. Still today know people wear mask trying protect themselves. dont try tell otherwise, least wearing mask. Even wrong reason. *Doubt* them. 1 guy antibodies symptoms lives uncle uncle fine. guess he’s intimate uncle. Lot commenters reading article.

Good news schools reopen, pretty safe. Houston! finally found use Astrodome!

Giant Field Covid19 Death Dome. Narrator: won’t.

But yes should, Florida doomsday train populations average age. Unless something week, see Florida compete New York #1 cases. help...much better nothing. Man fuckin doomers STILL trying compare Spanish Flu. Minneapolis? mention delays pay things like Rent Mortgages end too. many complex reasons playing is. 

1. Swedish people one highest rates trust world authorities hard accept authorities massively failed them. recently [public opinion finally started fall come line reality proportion (perhaps large one) probably able accept failure, continue believe Sweden right everyone else wrong matter much evidence piles contrary. 

2. public support led complacent authorities officials. It'd stupid politically oppose policy popular public. declining, weak joke opposition finally taking lame swats sitting government, tbh I've rarely seen opposition toothless country (but apparently somewhat normal Sweden Swedish version Overton Window, 'opinion corridor', tends *incredibly* narrow. noted public opinion declined opposition well; public may thinking similar things thinking: 'why something stop madness'? 

3. Another part opposition weak there's thing Swedish called ""borgfred"" means castle peace means ""castle"" (state) faces existential threat, parties lay grievances act one, well, Star Trek Borglike unit. opposition sort weak since first months went lockstep ruling government. weak swipes increasing bit *tone* late much *action* yet. theoretically possible though sitting government could collapse since weak start faces vulnerability avenues potential attack. Whether attempt happen, imo, depends low public opinion sinks. 

I see viable option near term given kittenish opposition's ""attacks"" handling COVID thus far, could wrong skim surface level knowledge issues table, look like could *converge* COVID bring whole thing down. fascinating, sure. Frustrating hell interesting. Perfect time cut funding test sites!

I love country much (/s) remember seeing something that. Ultimately, governors lot power, scary sad give fuck people elected them. Canada well. I’m proud country they’ve crushed virus we’ll far.  mean pedantic, mean 2,800,000 deaths? 
Source: F really, rate infection much much lower density country makes health system strain, higher median age compounds problem making higher death rates understandable.

I definitely think could’ve handled better here, lockdown quarantine quite intense. Even bit late. understanding Trump administration incredibly lax quarantine enforcement pandemic response, which, country much surface area, makes high rate infection pretty worrying. We've before. ICUs often run near capacity. sized serve optimally. That's system easy overwhelm. ""At 90% capacity"" mean anything. Last sentence nails it.  don’t disagree thing there’s narrative everyone fell line supported war effort. think comes videos saw history class mom goes homemaker suddenly she’s sewing uniforms building airplanes. People still working offices, opening businesses, socializing, whatever

I think it’s overly simplistic say focus everything curbing virus. That’s world live it’s American thing (which won’t hear Reddit heard friends world). There’s economic worries, health problems, child development, etc. everything needs considered much believe alternate forms currency, no.

It's logical. people can't get bank account. people access anything cash. Sometimes cash way pay someone. 

Will cash used *less*? Sure, society never cashless. I’ve learning Korean now, planning escape shithole years lol. Korea, Japan, Melbourne New Zealand...and none works maybe Canada. doesn’t feel far enough still doable. feel like thread talking video, [direct link stickied top. 

Articles suck comes playing embedded videos especially mobile, often comb much text find link. Czech. already went this. comply. forced comply. glad masks gone forever. Right mountains evidence wearing masks effective. new virus doesnt mean werent aware this. knew masks effective, told people wear shortage masks. Thats called lying, thats part scientific method last time checked.

Meanwhile hundreds thousands medical professionals around globe claiming opposite, wearing masks stop spread viruses. Regardless virus. 

Do really, honestly, think didnt know year? except also intense bouts dizziness derealization. buy list, think we've seen bottom yet. Stayed home except get groceries, wore mask, hand sanitizer whenever got left car, washed hands exposed skin changed clothing soon got home. live alone. live NY lol Good thing Texas reporting like 100 cases covid day. Totally accurate sure... surprised. GNC ripoff. prices blatantly high. former operator GNC worked even told get vitamins nutrients eating balanced diet. I'm sorry loss. Half country understand empathy. Something brains gassed needed gas mask he'd probably right. Let's grateful guys never find out! 😁 biggest problem fuck DeSantis running show, brethren: People inherently trust they've elected. So, asshole telling everyone go back normal soon possible worry virus, majority people trust best interest mind says that. exaggerating say criminal essentially forced states medical crisis per capita basis, worry California soon family Texas speaking canceled wedding due covid. Yes, outbreak cases another meat baron relevant health citizens. deserve every cheap sausage eat.

Let‘s hope lockdown effective again.

EDIT add: 1550 cases. name company Tönnies. people mother?!? fucking nightmare. Well March May destroying economy complete waste time appears. Always hard, fast lockdown stuff control. situation probably worse would shutdown first place.  would civil war. want government gone would back queen support parliamentary system would back government,  devolved parliaments regions. Scots Welsh like English parliament would back queen,  knows Irish would Northern English regions love Westminster either.

This would quickly turn game thrones. know, exactly point copy/pasting text clearly stated going delete did? trying shame asking question enough intelligence understand would perceived, thus deletion. ever occur I'm maybe making specific spreadsheet? Seriously, better. Again, great day. Thanks Henry ! would lot easier get people comply government officials **telling us two months ago wear mask.** Deaths possibly looking like might increase again, sadly: bad outbreak going Gällivare: also exaggeration say SE increasing testing ""exponentially"". [increasing, super increase quite steep, Sweden's slooooooooooow gradual. Good happening, misleading say ""exponential"". NY quite large population well. Granted, smaller Texas -- large. NYC massive spike early on, think attributed *no one* social distance policies place start proximity NYC residents other.

Thing is, NY state implementing policies while, we're like 500-700 new cases day. Far less TX FL. nothing else, interesting world live award contract name contractor sells useless product. Like FEMA accepted baby soda bottle preforms squirt saline instead sanitized test tubes viral transport medium. dirty tubes even fit standard testing equipment. Totally unusable. Currently [$7.3 handed white collar felon first time contractor. yeah, I'm sure cheapest option. live florida. grandpa knee replaced Monday. 86, tuesday called grandma confused thinking discharged hospital case. one allowed see transferred rehab facility rules apply. 

I cant even go hug grandma living alone first time 50 years. selfish people refuse wear masks, encouraged lack action government media. ready snap next person see stubbornly eating food table chipolte everyone else wears masks quietly stays 6 feet away. V shaped recovery Wow, shock! Well, went research rabbit hole 15 minutes straight list things read Peter Turchin theory. hope right Civil War next possible determined United States experienced spikes instability approximately every 50 years, around 1870, 1920, 1970. He predicted pattern would continue 2020, country expected enter ""a dip so-called Kondratiev wave, traces 40-60-year economic-growth cycles."" 

Here article discussed: [Researcher Predicted 2020 Turmoil says Social Upheaval Could Lead Civil War hey ya know what? Fair enough. paint broad brush. provide context thinking 9-11. buddy lived Battery Park City people jumping fell. He's got crazy PTSD point he's essentially alcoholic. People places FL, TX, AZ talked huge game much 9-11 spur action, really hurt them. feel many used drive nation war (again painting broad brush).

Historically, people places feel safer, things happen ""Sodom"" happen them. Typhoid Mary New York. 

Hence, Houston. wish best luck, appear someone rational thought. say covid hospitalizations really elective surgeries tested positive. I'll repeat, 95 week low may well 0 

Not sure confusing thinks bunker win election tweets. maybe views virus ravaging country potential upside throw voting flux benefit person behind polls. 

One thing certain though, doesn’t actually care masses people country president getting sick dying. ordered eBay AliExpress. They're comfortable enough functional.  could go days democracy crap, specifically shown inability actually get everyone page. Maybe people protesting wore masks kept decent distance (at least protests attended) stayed outdoors. That's little different indoors bars packed full people wearing masks family gatherings indoors masks. One lot likely spread another. little evidence show protests driving current outbreak, new cases tied back protests, mostly tied family gatherings contact tracing used. find evidence protests causing spike, I'd happy hear it. Agreed, yeah exploding south Wait wait wait, dad told cases going testing. everything fine right? Let guess, “Henry” Donald’s alias? wonder ""the projections massively overblown!!!"" people now? Probably hiding rat hole ""virus cannot survive warm temperatures"" people scurried ago. Western Canada here. Weve opened month seen major spikes despite blm protests low mask compliance. waited cases dropped significantly opening, even delaying opening lots areas due spikes. Paying provinces now. it’s happening like 5mph right now. many chances turn left. keep yelling driver phone doesn’t hear me: hears decides he’s right I’m wrong CARES Act help all? Houston well....Don’t include family friends statement. We’re exactly supposed do, including cutting hair. news showing lot people careless; isn’t though go door door film 3 million plus people see they’re right wrong. want know saying state better got downvoted. Lol

Sometimes place unreal I’m you, rise cases attributed “more testing.” understand correlation, however, spikes mention slew Karen’s giving af ridiculous. yestersay Home Depot, lady, ready give birth, strolling around without mask care. Crazy stuff!

Edit: typo Bears fan I've waiting Hall fame QBS retire decades (between Favre Rogers).
Lol. main reason freedom movement constitutionally protected. 

Regarding size thing... mean, hyper-authoritarian blockade roads, round staters, nobody gets kind thing. thinking something like: make illegal businesses serve people state, particularly hotels/car rentals. might overly simplistic view think lot people capacity deal scary shit long period time, stick heads sand pretend everything ok. live L.A. suburb, crazy many educated people know stopped caring landlord would rather empty unit occupied unit taking wear tear money coming in. We’re sick shit, doesn’t change reality. work together, get control spend much time constant state anxiety. wish, every decision he's made relating covid awful. Moving soon lease up. People NYC cared. mostly tried could, population density hammered them. 

Let’s put lack care people don’t deserve it. asked created spike, stranger's pure speculation must have. EU mad trump wants pay fair share nato global institutions America mainly funds. European “powers” (if Evan call anymore) refused pay fair share long enough think it’s time stop helping them. Exactly. know honor system isn’t going work 😂 german laugh here. EU three presidents, *four* presidents - one chancellorette! ;)

EU:

1.	President Commission (Executive)
2.	President EU council (2nd chamber)
3.	President EU Parliament (1st chamber)


Germany:

1.	President 
2.	President federal parliament 
3.	Chancelorette
4.	President federal council 
5.	President constitutional court

So EU structured similar Germany, that’s it’s maybe confusing non-Germans. Bell Riots came early us timeline mask compliance rate strongholds mask slackers, like San Francisco, [was That's high enough slow infection rate crawl. concern, though, natural selection might produce strain readily gets masks.

EDIT: words, want full containment, need harder measures better mask compliance. it’s not. You’re desperate blame BLM. need apologize, time. 

Im place are. went worried scared, mad, kind case ""fuck-it""s. 

I still cant believe CDC screwed testing badly, Im still angry lied us told us masks werent effective. known were, least aired side caution assume since work viruses (including coronaviruses) would also work coronavirus.  Cardiac death symptom covid..... Classic symptoms, opposed quantum symptoms?

(I'm sorry.) public health order, like Colorado.*

As misdemeanor, local law enforcement and/or local public health agencies would first reach voluntary compliance education, county/district attorneys bringing civil criminal action public health director requested it. County attorneys seek judge's orders state court force individuals comply.

At least CO law, state health dept authority enforce local health agency unable unwilling to, state attorney general also seek order judge state court compel compliance.

Edit: question ""how catch all"" don't, catch people driving speed limit. still speed limit laws one seems ask enforced.

*Edit 2: clear visitor quarantine CO, I'm describing public health orders work general. that's thing, he's right. put politics aside second say ""which country would expect prepared global pandemic"" would said USA every time (and live Canada). USA organizations whose job stop global pandemics happening. resources intellectual monetary able throw top performer. 

That said, start looking deeper culture actually make sense. founding principle USA ""Life, liberty, pursuit happiness"". awesome, also, individual freedom choice. attainment happiness, freedom pursue best ability. leads population naturally fiercely independent, self driven, distrustful government.

Canada founded ""Peace, prosperity, good government"". attaining crazy highs individualism, leaving together harming functional governing body. good times, translates less prosperity we're less willing take risks, bad times means come together trust government more. Man, corruption finally hit VOA. Cause that's worrisome part? ICUs full we're fucked regardless who's using them. took us 20 months even produce SARS vaccine could tested. already several candidates late stage testing 6 months. Buttercup Yet people aren’t dropping like flies here. confirm. country failed nursing home population pretty well everything else. Take look [this Texas Medical Center (TMC) site projects occupancy surge capacity. 

Interestingly, [this shows current capacity would good one keep eye on.

Also source, monitoring mitigation metrics. New **official** cases. idea peak actual total cases. % possibly?  EMTALA prohibits describing joke amazing levels That’s generally antagonists attack education- don’t know it, can’t learn it. didn’t hate Pedildo sand incident.... thought idea everyone get it, once. don’t big social media accounts, I’m sure I’d pissed seeing people posting photos following directions. Snapchat since it’s personal, since deleted quite good amount people. Wether it’s real fake, risk chance getting family sick, specially 2 year old daughter. went order pick up, pull ups local target, huge car meet parking lot over. Nobody social distancing, nobody wearing masks. Officers sitting parking lot making sure nothing else happened. makes angry that, days ago California mandated masks people following directions. don’t plan arguing people this, friend tell rise cases fake, asked 100k+ people died fake, never replied. constantly 2 month old parties bunch people posting people house drinking. It’s sickening think someone would risk child couple hours drinking they’re tired home. know live live children obese adults. Childhood diabetics probably common countries America.

[This shows monitoring mitigation metrics, includes PPE capacity. Sounds wife had. tested tested negative. Mother Law gave wife. negative covid antibody. think part maybe coastally centric national reporting is. New York, DC LA metros always get coverage that's much national media focused. folks Arizona hearing horror stories NYC back April hearing lull deaths cases May. make faulty assumption pandemic dying take less precautions even though reached yet. Sure think issue different institutions defined ‘elective’ differently people cancer operations postponed elective surgeries allowed again. wasn’t whole country, shown happened places. cancer surgery pushed back different messed breast implant delayed it’s important make distinction. glad hear things continued pretty regularly worked, I’m sure case many places. agree. don’t want discourage mask wearing. It’s ridiculous mandatory don’t version that’s comfortable, effective, widely available. believe British experts want everything go back normal. thanks basically AZ counted deaths way time Feds caught them. Evidence shown supplements etc effective virus. Strengthening immune system fine. solve mask wearing. talking people one mask poor definitely cant afford supplements.

The mask information CO2 etc simply incorrect. increase CO2 / decrease O2 time takes shopping trip something negligible best. bedroom door closed... technically there's increase CO2 decrease available O2. similar levels cases average persons mask. 

Be careful reading things seem scientific using fringe numbers proof. 

You feeling like can't breathe used it. absolutely hated masks wear insulation... painting..etc. rare times. force to. Guess what.... big deal anymore. got used it. That's mindset issue take time train ourselves. like driving. first get behind wheel unsure yourself. year later hoping everything second nature. 

Generic cotton masks prevent 20% exposure wearer limit 80% spread droplets droplet dispersion. Ultimately help. People wearing lazy acting like petulant children. I’m talking didn’t say. know post wouldn’t gotten exposure made sort mention 27% covid patients. Hawaii easy nearly everyone joins state fly in, easily identified tracked. also bought goggles gloves additional protection. right cities cases Bengalore seems control NBC MSN real experts aren’t they? 

I’m saying isn’t real problem think blowing proportion. policies highly institution dependent entire country’s hospitals cancel everything. People NYC cared. mostly tried. Waaaaay many folks TX don’t. Texas gonna worse. Idk you’re talking about. couple friends living Florida, told news making much it. Everyone calm down.

/s Definitely.

Reopening Memorial Day weekend contributed increase cases.

But mean protests role play increase. Even protesters used masks, masks decrease 100% risk passing COVID-19 someone else. distancing even prevalent masks. looking graph day comparing states. states never came close even small peak starting peak now. states (like NY) peaked hard early cases coming down. guess states never lot cases going lockdown made less sense harder hit states. Orange County Florida Economic Task Force Meeting today speaker Advent Health (Hospital System) said highest number Covid patients today. seeing huge spike ventilator usage (yet???). speaker large hospital system (Orlando Health) said seeing similar facilities.  
Not overrun point, concerned think americans people struggle understand english understand social distancing, masks, etc.

So lot older generations, especially non-white, frequently pull mask, touch you, invade personal space, etc. Examples:

- “ aren’t moving line? soo much room ahead “
- “ walking away get closer”
- Many take mask passing entrance locations sayings hard breathe
 
Is language barrier issue majority information regarding coronavirus english? people ignorant. ( saying non-minorities perfect seeing violations occur alot frequently minorities) I'm Canada I'm already 99% cashless. Tap-to-pay ubiquitous here. Google Pay I'm practically wallet-less too. soon digitize driver's license I'll good go. Back school! effort, one case, shows exactly damn serious virus really is... screwed America is. 

Eradication goal knowledge. “Flattening curve” stupid. Unbelievable. Maybe good intentions seems incredibly racist.  heard hospitals inflating numbers cases get sweet government handouts make revenue lost elective procedures.

Instead just... re-opening. It’s beds, it’s also floor space beds, machinery monitor them. Referring set “beds” known “synecdoche” Trump Caesar. . . No? literally 90% every Houston hospital combined. Texas already open Telling masks work seems outright lie. time, february march, read many articles detailing clear messages health care officials/experts abroad saying exact opposite. 

Yet see people still claiming medical professionals recommend masks time. false. 

Interestng mention Spanish Flu. whole reason got name Spanish Flu Spain actually transparent honest outbreak virus, everyone thought started there. Meanwhile many countries dealing virus, keeping mostly secret. agree 100% fucking racist pig.
I wish dies. new cases **one day** .02% population, virus spreads exponentially, ... really bad. You’re putting restaurant employees risk. Stop selfish person. IHME Texas 50% capacity ICU. 

I don’t know many emergency Army Corps hospitals ready stage though. NY ramped couple thousand beds two weeks. 

An entire hospital Boston converted Covid gained 500 ICU beds. 

We get serious cases system fast possible means letting people get sick rate stays capacity. There’s way without treatment vaccine. problem stay safe!  person charge US indisputably moron egotist weird things. least tanked reelection completely pandemic. safe course everyone strive healthier.

However, people dying corona elderly. 80% Canadian deaths nursing homes. encouraged train marathons 4 months ago?

Many others died (that younger) pre-existing conditions. poor boy died recently coronavirus? needed 4 months get good health? 

By way, ironically CNN's headline calls healthy.

 Ah, one sided hit piece fringe news website sources. Great source.

Civilian deaths necessarily war crimes. War ugly shit, Fallujah one worst battles modern history. marines fighting guys wearing uniform (insurgents) war crime, hiding among civilian population, war crime.

I’m sorry stupid country failed you. makes incredibly angry many Americans selfish. worse, watch happened Italy hospitals full. make people react Europe.

Also, even shit show covid New York, Cuomo STILL going cut healthcare funding. man actually cares public health. realize states trying stop virus states flat welcoming it, right? 3 states working together, personally, dont care anyone says since live NYC, ban certain states coming while, looking FL, TX, AZ. We’re getting past hump come POS states ready stomp shit, fuck that. Mumbai Delhi worst handled cities. They're testing like 14-15k day despite capacity almost double tests.

\-trump probably

remember vote blue november save country's soul wear masks framed slackers. 

This understand. wearing masks framed inconsiderate pricks? mask wearers framed ""afraid"" reality wearing masks afraid looking silly made fun assholes like themselves? I'm confident 9, 9+10 meaningful expression. Lol bro. Speeding mandated law.

How many people speed? old you? 100% compliance law literally LOL funny. Calm man? It’s like 5000 deaths
4980 cases hardly know sick I’m worried large Texas we’re going manage every big city getting hit time, well states going up. 

It's pretty simple, we're going able manage it. That's main issue Covid whole time, medical infrastructure cannot handle it. surprise, catching anyone guard, hard reality virus certain group politicians supporters decided wanted deny 4 months, many places deep shit. deep shit entire scientific community told months ago. Unfortunately, looks like AZ TX going horrible examples happen play virus. Good. fucking stupid. boss waited open tiny, completely indoors bar. supposed open July, I’m praying everything gets shut then. I’m scared going back work. It’s think about. I’ve never stressed life. I’m scared partners’ lives. people Texas STILL walking around like there's problem! wearing masks almost one social distancing Cant wait 2020 doc sheriffs throughout country saying enforce mask orders, Still better nothing. employers pay it. That's point I'm making.
I get full pay 6 months 6 months 1/2 pay problem think kind mind control experiment see complies. Meanwhile, sit Facebook, Instagram, watch television day. I’d say battle already lost. seems like Summer ways even worse spring was. statement four states seeing increases incredibly false. I’m glad state well state, South Carolina, blowing up. We’re ~+10% positive rate close 1000 cases consistently past days last week 500. Around state, hospitals NC GA seeing close capacity hospitalizations. believe read article around 20 states seeing major upticks first wave first ripple starting NE working way south. UNSG Antonio Guterres. many years now. people arent thinking about. upcoming winter going horrifying. Sorry what? lol.....The US shown nothing disrespect world past years. run absolute incompetents seem live crazytown. start behaving line international norms, put global naughty step pals Russia, Turkey, North Korea Saudi Arabia. surface transmission uncommon?

I'm convinced Chinese propoganda push harm/kill Americans govt responsible whether people smart enough right thing? really need kind hand holding govt? Mass crowd protest pandemic never safe idea. one mask clean regularly. pot hot boiling water + 2 drops liquid soap. Boil 10-15 minutes. Done done. Masks used again. enforced? get wrong, think good idea practically speaking seems incredibly difficult idea got 2800 from

Literally graph TMC article. Aren’t protests major part this?  still lot room new cases unfortunately. Take India example. almost 500.000 reported cases now. Let's make factor 20 higher say India actually 10 million cases. Still nothing compared whole population. response ever calibrated hospitalizations, since hospitalizations increase means much screwed up.

Lombardy reporting around +70 daily hospitalizations beginning March, end use army trucks transport coffins away, despite locking march 8. Especially population needed instructions turn household items like t-shirts vacuum cleaner bags masks. feeling Can. border going closed yet US Brazil contributing valuable data rest world happens nothing.

I point theses cases stupid people tell masks useless lockdown stupid... shh, giving away... realize deaths happened course decade right, one two years. happened spread world, one country. worry guys. DeSantis lead us this. I'm sure testing young folks getting it, can't spread unexplained reason. magically disapear day now. Bunch idiots. Yes mix turmeric saffron together virus go away Yeah, really hoping isn’t real. Orange County (Orlando) fucking around though. pretty proud handle things. Serious question

How hospitals coping this??? whole world getting worse. Second wave SK. Waves Europe, Asian, South America. 

There isn’t country succeeded. small clarification: live Switzerland, health insurance. law. can't afford one, state pays you. I.e. tests never cost patients anything. would get tested, health care provider would send bill two whoever pays. differences handled cost, though. Cantons (the equivalent state) local government. Cantons, health insurance. would lead inequality cost distributed. Thus federal government stepped takes cost testing. craziest part car crash scenario knowing car crashes still drive fast carelessly. like people still smoke cigarettes, use line reasoning. I'm gonna die sometime. seen new update site I'm afraid want football misunderstanding part. saw ""dining experience bookings cancelled"" Disney site brain went 'restaurants closed, can't eat there.' also think would possible kind questioned it. I’m sure could more. it’s hard rare someone household, doubt it’s much different marching next someone street outside mask on. I’m much worried people going churches indoor restaurants. Guess it’s ok murder citizens street long there’s pandemic? Definitely would. work small business print shop near Houston area. required wear masks customers not. people wandering place work every day “checking place out” people bored home want things do. People infected done curbside services us. already employees get sick take leave including myself. us staffed moment pulling 60+ hour weeks since mid March part time listed employee. 

It’s matter time someone brings shop forces us shut down. People fucking stupid. agree. Would interesting see deaths time classified pneumonia I'd love see LA looks like, also update status NYC. latter managed keep cases even beginning reopen, think 25% population immune large part that. Exactly, packing like sardines protest. half people wearing masks. country, US completely fucked. parties filled brim fucking morons. Yep. also trust healthcare system really care loved ones got it. knows ventilator available. local doctors keeping scientific discoveries new symptoms (blood clots, etc.) 
Plus I'm red area, I've seen nurses doctors around talk wearing masks big deal media makes seem. insane. FWIW:  
   3 multiple sources DOH told instructed week change numbers begin slowly deleting deaths cases looks like Florida improving next week leadup July 4, like they've ""made hump.""  
   3 I've independently verified they've deleted least 1200 cases last week.They're reporting cases restrict reporting next week make everyone think over. I've two DOH employees different offices confirm.   
  
      agree that, found edifying. say use theory (correctly) instead fact (erroneously) lose even people. religion attacked theory evolution, fear word lost potency. anti science enlightenment crowd legitimately making wonder consider moving family somewhere little sane. boat’s taking water, it’s fucking wild people calling is. wonder EU consider allowing travelers states travel Europe national level.

The mandatory quarantine sounds like good idea case.  see less criminal negligence, honestly.  Hard pass. unmitigated massacre Americans. administration led, people let guard down, slaughtering ourselves. predict 300k dead this. I’ve never hated people much hate Trump Abbott right now. There’s incredible arrogance says “India poor badly managed course Western countries better/can afford lockdowns longer”. 

I think difference capability Western countries India trying contain global pandemic much smaller think. Western people get fed restrictions life Indians do, unemployed person. Oh turnnn tables Obviously not, they’re banning americans, coming US. Yeah that’s I’m worried about. We’re going lot people ongoing health issues contracting COVID. Children Kawasaki’s disease, young adults strokes developing asthma, older folks ending icu /or dying. Lots pneumonia issues messing people decades. It’s going pretty. makes mad lot could could still avoided! understand Cassandra’s struggle. It’s making insane. Majority people see need run errands FL, either don’t mask hanging one ears 🤦🏻‍♀️ CARES Act covers undermployment well. brother lost 10 hours week (40 30) covered CARES Act. Yet **still** randomized testing, epidemiology, models. idea tests done biased, many self-selected heavily screened wants test badly enough wait 6 hours 110-degree weather. could large group tests coming prisoners and/or corrections officers. could seeing cluster certain agency state cities counties ""employee testing blitz"". could seeing regional variation set certain testing blitzes areas waiting months get tests. could seeing spikes one day testing reservations. could seeing depressed next day testing cit yemployees working remotely past month. could see spike next day testing police first responders. **We know**.

We're looking 11,000 tests population 7.3 million, randomization control included 11,000. know, could mostly nursing home residents, could vulnerable people isolation, could farm workers, meaningless right now. 

How make decisions based data *we meaningful prevalence data* whatsoever. confirmed cases deaths, nearly July. beyond pathetic. number young people strokes. also number died ""traditional way"" respiratory failure. absolutely affect young, frequently. Cancer treatment centers America, whole, best world. Europeans 1.5x likely die cancer Americans. statistical fact US best outcomes cancer treatment anywhere world, places better populations much smaller difficult compare. complete moron absolutely idea talking about. 

Source: believe people US still debating issue like wearing mask not. Remember *certain people* leaned ""hOw tRUsT cHINa'S nuMBeRs?!"".

Well, trust US's numbers now? now, everyone helping one another wearing masks. wear [reusable 8 hours day that's strictly protect others. political issue infringe anyone's rights. able earn income without fear infection healthcare workers treating exorbitant amount patients.  Im done. sentiment echoed president justice. test people airport? takes hours, people wait Ny many deaths due knowing treat 40% 50% percent deaths due putting patients nursing homes. Deaths consistently stagnant month. Also, Health confirmed Homestead Hospital's intensive care unit capacity due part coronavirus patients elective surgeries, officials said Tuesday.

Overall bad really wish would specifically let us know many patients due COVID19. NY right 300k active cases 300 listed serious. (Scroll down, USA tab, hit NY, scroll back AZ ICU rise actual COVID19 patients dropping since June 9th. (Go circle HOSPITALIZATION tab, scroll down. gives specifically COVID19 admitted day trying downplay virus all, however something reporting media. reporting many cases hospital COVID19, instead COVID19? states rising hospitalizations stopped elective surgery? NY front page news? 300k active cases 300 serious condition!? 300k active cases state. Many headlines combined. 

Be safe, wear mask, distance. change actions ok question things make sense. Stay safe. New Zealand entered chat. USA long ass late summer/fall/winter. Incredible people thought we'd good TX. Look us now. Freaking pitiful response hospitals overloaded. Massive cases FL, CA, etc. can't believe stupid leadership local national level. Yeah even talking asymptomatic. done good italian stayed 3 months mandatory quarantine, want Trump boot licker (not you) came honeymoon spread fucking virus again.

There goes! child autism ... Bet wish better educated vaccines right. mean let Pediatrician inject child HEP B vaccine birth. child prostitute drug user (the risk cases Hep B). 

A child birth hadnt gotten water food milk first thing fragile body immune system HEP B vaccine red flags warning sirens went head. ???

I bet beat daily this. try hard convince vaccines. 

In school son attends - 23 kids - 7 special needs - second teacher deal ""developmentally challenged children"". children - various issues like allergies asthmas (autoimmune disorders). vaccinated 

There 6 kids including son whose parents NEVER vaccinated submitted exemption letters - know weve met separate occasions. None unvaccinated kids autistic anything approaching autoimmune disease. Cant remember last time son cold. 

Everyone us professionals (Engineers, Doctors, Machinists, Accountants, Lawyers) read multiple books subject - bookshelves littered books, research counter CDC/WHO/PHARMA spin subject. 

But never bothered question anything done innocent child. accepted word Doctor 

Here Doctors say knowledge vaccines medical school 

Again exemptions exist reason. didnt child would private home schooled. already made plans LONG conceieved. 

Thats loving caring parent does!!! Yeah actually are. Isolated clusters expected. Germany live pretty normal life without fearing covid. New liberal measures caused little spike cases see maybe early allowing people meet large groups again, succefully flattened curve. Great. I'm trapped Evangelicals. YES PLEASE!!! WuHan’d NY Exactly this. Oh, saw news already. guess going herd immunity Sweden trying. course, again.... that's actually does. That's excuse uses give platform actual nazis pedophiles. 'both sides' shit real. Sounds like time open Disney World right now! I'm guessing supposed ironic burned Minnesota. Stay out. know T*ump trying do. absolutely wants stop testing numbers look better, even people dying. Gotta love sports wanna thank spitting straight facts statistical response wild claim. Much respect. Idk you’re coming aggressive 

That’s exactly thing saying lmao Well nose jabbing uncomfortable. there’s massive group people close proximity screaming maskless... mass graves they've use cities. family member COVID back mid-March. recovered 2 weeks so. Would “safe” visit since theory won’t get us sick won’t get sick either... still enough known situation avoid visit now? 4qw😐😀😉 Can’t wait horrendous real life lesson exponential growth Yeah really feel like group punishment something idiot everyone trying stop did.

None either severe pneumonia patients. need show evidence generally tech workers migrate Canada US. lot support positions moved Mexico last years accelerate. HELP US! Gotta get judges... That’s crazy Next up: Mount Rainer erupts wipes Seattle. spike infections inevitable protesting crowds without social distancing....at least death rates seem falling. truly unfortunate. smart reasonable people working front lines suffer shear stupidity significant proportion country. stupid. Hahaha worst year I’ve experienced far... plans quit time soon! We're talking people billions **savings.** Bezos boys. Hording wealth, contributing public good paying taxes. $0 federal taxes stash money overseas. justifying paying taxes? taxes go social security elderly, safer infrastructure, healthcare people without it, national defense. resources public good, society function remain orderly. know failed idea everyone mindset society would devolve chaos. Maybe like chaos though. Sinovac already Ad5-nCoV phase 3 trial Brazil, along one vaccine China.

This best rn. course flawed. statistics flawed. wear masks. So, yeah, lockdowns guess. one asks follow questions?

“Why numbers important? test people treat deadly disease? “

I kind think he’s saying ridiculous people overwhelmed ignorance. Like don’t even know begin. Well, problem is, almost countries europe. USA still booming taking precautions America 2 million+ confirmed cases, 100,000+ confirmed deaths people think need wear masks. Insanity. source article commenting ""It's ironic"" happening eyes. 27% SARS survivors developed chronic fatigue syndrome, disease results lower quality life multiple sclerosis, there's precedent it. SARS2 affects 1/10th people SARS way, put 2-3x death toll permanent disability. Bush really popularity resurgence got princess Diana’s brakes ur garage something? Many flee state go places covid bad (yet). happened New Yorkers.  words, problem problem too. stupid? definition pure stupidity. like freight train coming way 500 yards away refuse acknowledge plain view. That’s maybe answer practice..but *theory*, everyone could stop stupid put masks on...avoid another shutdown. No. got awake VOTE. go back sleep though. seriously vote. Save $5000 advocating **against** masks, lose $50,000,000 due consequences. Someone needs brain surgery hospital. Vietnam belongs first category. mid-January responded better country.



I've back teaching eight weeks already nobody talks anymore. Nobody knows anyone it. mysterious deaths. friend hospital visit, perfectly normal staff bothering masks. Merica!! statista link provided: 

“A word flaws numbers like this:
People right ask whether numbers representative several reasons. [...] additional pieces information get full picture, something statistic current state simply cannot provide.”

^ Thats I’m saying bruh We're going mess making then. Dying out? seen spike cases Texas, Florida, Cali, etc? It’s far “dying out”. Jesus Christ. almost NYC testing shortage numbers. Damn that's sneaky. daughter supposed Orlando event August. going get annual passes since (had) Disney trip planned next year. told last night way going August get covid August. Given personal lock down, that’s likely. Unless dumb 17 year old took challenge. Shit— better go clarify that. Again, Austria four times size New Jersey. understand comparing raw population statistics instead population density.

If country city structured way citizens forced live close proximity, huge impact effectivly mitigate spread virus. lots ways look say US handled worse Europe, numbers looking prove point.

Sweden obviously worst case, disingenuous compare NYC. disingenuous compare countries based strictly population rather density population. I'm sure addressing point, instead keep using same, irrelevant, statistics comparison. I'm curious, too. see spike NYC, Italy, etc. x amount months, would show anti-bodies last x amount time rotate population peaks. immunity last four months NYC begin see uptick July round cases March. I’m dallas county close edge Collin county don’t seem give fuuuuuuck. fuckers could get page would nice. Germs Downstate Illinois taken over. Everything north Springfield turned fields. Champaign lucky make 4th July. understand play stock market.

Basically thing sound sophisticated morons. bingo bongo - trying make light situation best can. I'm high fixed bass pedal electronic drum kit, something unplayable close year cause never got it. huge earthquake add all. coincidentally educated state country. Tri cities hot mess too. Even without nuclear waste. simply happen. companies already limit hiring Europe. cheaper salaries always desirable government policy lack business friendly environment limit growth. company offices every major city Europe biggest still London Cardiff. pale comparison Asian India locations though. fact limited travel see offices downsized positions moved remote work. also major factors involving incorporation.

You likely going see larger spread US started years ago picked steam recently. believe Texas alone seen tech jobs Germany, France, Spain. person 75% Hispanic origin fair call overwhelmingly Hispanic. know one guy who's staggeringly Hispanic mildly so. That’s crazy...why punish us commander n queef part Governor DeSantis' economic reopening plan. California ain't well either friend still don’t know means lol right? Funny they’re still “perfectly acceptable levels”, though. cousin RN different hospital Miami. They’re getting slammed. gonna option much longer. Eastern Washington here. them. believe whatever China releases world truth........ Christ, whole bunch cities Texas hit once, along cities Southern States slammed similer fashion would creat much worse situation March April, back then, large cities getting slammed, time might many cities. think people thought New York City came worst it, thought virus done, certianlly not. Yes. wondering chose UAE. Brazil seems popular choice. read earlier 5x pneumonia deaths normally knows right Pretty sure Trump withdrew thought entire organization useless US CDC, saved USA tiny amount money may may helped ballooning deficit. Definitely consider USA would last line eventual vaccine eventually created overseas. 

It's well known USA pharmaceutical companies healthcare USA ""for profit"" since we're large industrialized country without universal healthcare. There's least 50% chance vaccine home grown things considered. happens maybe USA ""pay"" re-join WHO? magnet throw SUV show care drive party? True. Governor Cuomo talk sense folks either. I'm worried am. cases relative areas yet still shut much. shutdown-fatigue still need careful, run course.  People sub tend doom gloom agenda they'd perfectly happy paid never leave houses again. Awesome. immunity lasts year two? work feed family. Right. there’s middle ground. forgot that.... feel exact way, makes cry everyday. truly feel hopeless don’t want people die. feel like everyone around acting like things fine, makes feel like I’m outlier one “overreacting” know I’m not. family lives state invited Disney fall I’m super anxious trying figure tell no. It’s weird fucking thing see family act without regard others. It’s weird see friends too, hits harder family. get mean I’m worried friends compromised relationships due I’m worried thing family. It’s already affecting us can’t accept politely say I’m uncomfortable that, thanks invite hope figure something else postpone later date. I’m glad feel similarly though gives ounce hope others think like this. appreciate trying hardest keep others safe, really mean that! Nobody wearing masks office already. another coworker are. rest aren't. I've seen 10-30% people wearing masks stores. going tough. government could requisition supplies. enact defense production act. could recommend (AS LATER) wearing cloth face covernigs. Lying people correct solution.

What did, excusing. fanboyism traitors unproductive. atrocity, need accountability. many dead innocent people lies. I’m still betting 350K dead August. July 4 saddle point. 3 weeks later we’ll see idiots charge made right reversals policy not. wouldn’t expect so. both? month ago would seen people masks take trash out. month? Neighbors barbecuing together 3-5 different apartments building without masks sitting close together daily basis! Nobody wearing masks get car touch face hands putting on! Workers pulling masks talk less 6’ away you! Where, might ask? LA, CA Sweden right along? return lockdown CARES ends 2 weeks people get $500 month. Ever water damage house?

I'm Amazon driver GA amazes many people walk around masks on. Even social distancing much ask apparently, constantly ask people back up. people already risk also previously healthy? percentage known patients develop this?  LOL! ..So, head-in-the-sand bs.. assumption want everything locked down? vilify argument. far railing reality goes ..”...not sustainable option”.

And, you’d wrong there. I’m realist optimist pessimist.. indications, America unwilling, therefore incapable defending this. said that, would kinda nice administration got head ass long enough encourage basics safety though. 

Y’know...Slow thing enough people get good care need it. 

That alone might shave hundred thousand deaths total body count.

But! It’s election year, ain’t it? call shots don’t much way “accomplishment” run-on, they? shocked learn pandemics history repeats country  mean - wrong. COVID19 taught us anything, general, little understand transmission respiratory viruses. YES, understand pass human-to-human clsoe contact, far lines/means transmission......we yet pinpoint that. 

Sure would nice know fomite transmission issue. would literally save husband \~90 minutes every evening coming home work. is? Showers immediately upon coming home, shipments/grocery nonperishables spare bedroom three days. making sense. Nobody asking lock forever. Thats argument temporary re-lockdowns. wrong. President specifically said considering quarantine, White House confirmed action contemplated ""anyone leaving New York City self-isolate 14 days"".

[BBC - March 28, 2020 - Coronavirus: Trump 'considering quarantining New agree. person dies Cardiac arrest previous symptoms, waste funds. Time money would better spent testing symptomatic people patients still living. previous symptoms, agree. 

If area death occurred wealthy enough suited great testing capabilities guess I'd ok every death tested. Move RTP. No, real. Sadly, too. remember refreshing every 2 minutes mid-late March schools shutting down. Then, around mid April stopped looking sub entirely realized mid May good sign. Two days ago started looking realizing “awww shit, go again”.

This beyond fucked there's guidance NY basically roughly 1/10sqft. A, B, Start arrived NZ mid feb study abroad left mid March two days lockdown. Amazed speed effectiveness good leader (Jacinda) have, going NZ humbled Thanks sharing kind words. Texas governor bad Arizona Florida ones, least that's something. 

I think Cuomo amazing job compared states (CA, OH). lived NY two decades. parents live Suffolk County near Cty Rd 97 leads Stony Brook level 1 trauma center cases county went. supposed use sirens critical cases sirens going night every night April May. people back there, we've lost 2 Covid (RIP 102 year old Aunt Millie 78 year old Cousin Antonette, Assisted living facilities). I'm pretty sure they've now. can't live ""hoax town"" stuff going on. said morons Long Island blaming China Bats Bill Gates even realize real, now. anything burned ""get back normal"" less consequences. community spread back there. 

I'm PA Governor Wolf good job, despite pressure GOP ""Pennsyltucky."" even specific live Philadelphia, despite well deserved reputation filthy, actually learned epidemiology ""what do"" example textbooks 1918. Philadelphia closed week PA remains closed July 3rd. starting emerge Green zone long haul. 

my advice slow mover prepared months fighting. best luck enjoyed Abbott story. Long ago lived Dallas (SMU area) Austin work enjoyed much. I'm severely burned, Houston/Galveston best (or one best) burn hospitals World.

So, basically anything semi related burns get treated Texas. infection really bad, requires IV antibiotic, oral. 

And ended getting infection bad time, getting stuck ban entry Americans EU. 

I seen fiance 5 months it. Five months enough warning. could anyone even five months? Build house? Make half person? Become police officer?  Fuck me, that's fucked. What's wrong either? We've seen bad lockdown ravaged economy, much virus ravaged livelihoods I'm sure lot empathy. 

They mocked ignored professionals months. 

And adults. 

My empathy limits. plus side might get cure common cold this. Yes...But sort blend together. reason military wears uniforms. indoctrinate selfish Americans thinking best interests group. 🤮 True.

But people refuse wear masks kind trust government.

So would made sense wear masks protect themselves. Funny mention that, that’s pretty much Reddit thinks T_D ""this in, Governor orders police bar media hospital ground halted reports hospital administrators. Dont worry though take court struck unconstitutional 5 8 months!""
/s One important things learn PsyOps (psychological operations) military is: 

The message truth destroys credibility. “selective truth” doesn’t reveal information would work you, needs accurate. enemy realizes they’ve lied to, correct information disregarded. 

The example doesn’t quite mesh American people aren’t enemy psychological manipulation never used forces anyway. comment made think it. rank nonsense. 

Eat shit shove worthless condolences self-righteous ass.  Yeah... Rich people probably prefer millions poor people test out, first. bad vaccine won’t forgiving. I’m sure. PPE supply now, even though surgeries considered “elective” lot times still quite important, life-saving.

Never got tested treated (wonder why?) later life doctor told I’ve already diagnosed whooping cough. absolute Bozo! hear ya, recently moved well. tough, lol. CARES runs July get $500 month. Like quarantined people arriving China back January/February. Hand flyer self quarantine never check again. Covid-19 attaches pollution particles. Could get anymore interesting. fuck possible? We're testing % tests positive rising, indicates increased spread independent increased testing. non-anecdotal evidence large portion people wearing masks? can’t seem find studies say it’s 20%. areas seeing increase cases places would expect. rural areas Texas, rural areas Northern California, Northern Florida, etc. think it’s unhelpful generalize entire populating refusing wear masks fringe group spreading among communities. sweat idiot. another redditor rooting news worse already is. Good luck school. That's correct! area example almost every business I've gone lately employees customers wearing masks. look weird wearing mask they're not. concerning see large lack common sense people. used think overall people good common sense. pandemic proven wrong. isn’t happened all, wasn’t travel ban, implemented horribly, didn’t work, you’re idiot thinking amounts appropriate response pandemic ""Contrary expectations, free energy binding Spike-RBD hACE2 appears decreased N0 (common animal ancestor) N1 (ancestor human SARS-CoV2)."" 

WTF!! Thanks! think size/geographically-similar comparisons Sweden Denmark, Norway Finland paint pretty bleak picture well given deaths (and deaths per capita) had. Honestly, Swedish strategy makes sense certain a) sufficient medical supplies b) chance resolution involved 70+% infection rates population.

A) seems true.
B) seems be.

Honestly, sufficient contact tracing, distancing PPE seems able keep thing's R-value 1. lockdown followed R-reducing measures probably best bet seems like ultimately result fewer deaths countries implemented strategy not. said various vaccine candidates prove unsuccessful virus stable enough burn Sweden's strategy may prove correct. see.

EDIT: reason lockdown get levels virus population point r-reducing measures overwhelmed. found explanation quite good http://ncase.me/covid-19/ anti mask (which thing US 1918), corona denialism large phenomenon elsewhere. Trump symptom disease.  Yes, is. current weekly amount whatever state’s existing UI + additional $600 supplement federal government.  is. boss told pick people. picked. it’s upper management decides it’s time. favorite part job. I’m putting couple people work day comes. One bad worker wasn’t allowed fire PPP. rest don’t deserve though. see curves flattened? US actually opposite, cases surging again, show site give idea, show Canada cases per day vs USA 1620 perfectly acceptable tell whoever says things dangerously misinformed welcome time. moved houses made sure way hell become landlord old property. Listed slightly (our crazy inflated) values got offer day. Absolutely worth hassle renting old house epic clusterfuck. think move makes sense. UK already fearing deal import substandard US food. Covid wafting around freely US Joe America goes round saying ""aint corona gonna stop living life, freedoms, get back work!!"" lets keep US till figure $hit out.

I honestly thought Americans, average, smarter this. absolutely flabberghasted seem ignorant defiant all. Personally think America heading disaster lot Americans blindly troop along oblivious actually happening here. Ok. Allegheny county currently ""green"" there's spike cases. Everyone's back going gym bars. going last. believe it. Hospitality tourism major industries. many traveling Mississippi people live Mississippi following protocols. masks. Close other. Breathing others.

It's gross.  Unfortunately whole things generalizing, it’s great bunch people right thing, believe leadership huge majority arent unfortunately it’s reflection whole state. virus numbers seem show it. Boomers Karens part Burger King generation aka ""Have Way"" generation. Anything slightly inconvenient hard handle lead collection self-centered imbeciles. isolation bad. discovered Facebook. Allowing many uninformed ignorant people finally communicate one place created nothing turmoil stupidity. news media failed desperately clung next best thing, stupid friends scam artists ""must telling truth, they're internet"". I'm 22 myself, I'm one social circle actually cares what's currently going on, acknowledges young generation responsibility prevent. Seeing friends fuck downplaying risks, even small ones, continue going events, absolutely repugnant.

If need half-celebrate every young death order convince one healthy soul stay f home practice social distancing, will. due respect, regret that.  Masks also protect wearer. could not? one sided. stop droplets going out, also stop droplets going in. cringe list countries fit X getting smaller smaller... vaccine another one? thats right, mess FloridaMan true wearing cloth mask prevent 100% virus particles floating about... they're airtight. people wear way makes completely useless. (A mask zero good hanging around neck like necklace, probably enough good covering mouth. seen people things.)

But game odds. breathe virus particles wearing mask, get stuck fabric. Others go around fabric, mask slowed redirected air particles travel far face would otherwise. makes less likely person near breathe in.

Just wearing mask prevent spreading virus well everybody stay home, we're long haul. people gotta work lot people can't work home. woman work growled going get basically shut forget it. even tried bring up. Getting would likely spell death husband, daughter, myself. conditions born give us poor odds. know still may get it, people talk like that, hurts. actually safe restaurant workers serving dine-in? California, restaurants allow customers remove masks moment seated keep finish meals. Servers forced deliver food unmasked customers’ tables. want know safe. current requirement servers delivering food gloves, cloth mask, face shield, sufficient clothes exposed skin contaminated? triage attribute beds likely benefit ICU care.

Older people preexisting conditions would likely refused. would likely sent sort pop hospital get oxygen.

The knock effects becomes impossible functioning health care system. Cancer care gets cancelled, heart operation postponed, people car accident night due due lack ICU availability.... wife promised second honeymoon backpacking Europe kids grow up. Guess that's shitter  Illinois/Chicago sucks anyway. people want go ones yet. Class inherently tied race US.  go hard New Zealand knew limited capacity manage large numbers ICU patients.

We watching horror unfolding country, please keep safe can. see medical degree? they’re ridiculous statements. American lived Europe I’d say they’re 100% accurate. Opening schools going nightmares. Since beginning time schools always taught using proper hygiene, though schools sickness begins. 

How schools going enforce students wear masks, even day. happens take off, loose it, teacher turns head little Johnny Timmy switching masks, taken draw them, etc.

Increasing school sanitation cheap. takes man/woman hours people going work free. Schools already short staffed limited budgets.

Then got look transportation students, school. man /woman hours going take disinfect bus' trip. mention bus drivers/monitors elderly age. I'm Michigan okay that. mean, second wave inevitable. virus magically disappear.  joking wish. Like seriously lock state borders. budget would nonexistent,” said.

Wait sees happening tax base supports state local government including education.

Honestly idea school problem used teach. It’s like ninth degree cataclysmic problem relating pandemic. Sorry. bet people facebook time watch news tv likely fox. Nobody tell Sweden response Well spoken. Dr Fauci professional, politician. liken career military professional. know expertise sometimes dealing idiots fact life. He’s hoping lessen damage reality nobody otherwise role. Hopefully soon someone office sense. sounds like miserable existence. truly plan keep indefinitely? vaccine never comes, makes think treatment either? don’t one common cold. virus spreads symptoms develop lot selective pressure weakening it... Suicidal bunch lol headline man got family gathering. says lot U.S. deals thinks family gatherings put hold year... get work, public transport, funeral parlor anyway.

The rest world already knew said much papers contact traced outbreaks MONTHS ago - 68% infections happen home. tell home never see family again. tell stay home shut offices, churches, public transport, etc. - likely places cause corona outbreaks. 

In words, stop activities likely source large outbreaks may well count never seeing family think helps rushed ""reopening"",.you'll subject dangers anyway daily life likely spread far wide.

And fucking hell articles like CA - reminds always shouting dangers reopening accompanying photos one thing least likely cause outbreak - day beach. new beach photos ""reopening dangerous"" article one says ""family get togethers cause outbreaks!"" 

No. don't. things started going family get together caused outbreak.

Look following article. It'd like South Korean news stopped call center's infected employees infected home saw family work. that's works - OFFICE CALL CENTER considered unnecessary, dangerous activity sourced outbreak, family know people course infected family, maybe even lot family, solution ""Don't ever see family again,"" solution ""shut dangerous places work, restaurants, churches, funeral parlors, offices, indoor activities likely transmit virus"" safe reopen them. Otherwise chasing chimera never, ever go away, America seems doing. hope home owners face repercussions. tenth amendment border become states responsibility enforce quarantine deemed reasonable right medical review.

It wouldn’t pull because. 
If quarantine authorised legal, way enforce would monitor cars traveled state. car pinged travelling around multiple subsequent days becomes cause investigate potential breaking quarantine. fuck constitutional? Thanks!  I've made complaints health department restaurant following law covid. least 3 customers, 2 pictures. health department done zero this. own. Eat risk. Agreed. Even January, cases linked Wuhan market. But, seems superspreader event kicked pandemic spread travel Wuhan people started picking there. current hypothesis seems lone traveler (just like original SARS) someone may picked virus (perhaps Yunan, that's RaTG-13 found) traveled Wuhan pre-symptomatic period started spreading then.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Gas gas gas, want step gas Thank testing out. Appreciate it. guys read article?

The headline misleading, usual CNN.

I'm saying comment dumb rock. CNN tried make headline. slowed testing. He's just... Yeah. No, all. government incentives spend money keep money market place, makes economy strong.

You get penalized taxes taking money market place.

Read book tax free wealth. special? Sith's deal absolutes!  Governor Cuomo either, big difference. think many homeowners able make huge lump sum payment forbearance ends. Meaning basically wait all, get nearly instantly.  California Texas seeing crazy numbers big protests almost two weeks major cities. Minneapolis stopped 4-5 days guard came in. part Texas yes. taken notes stop concensus wash hand whenever touch something, that's practically impossible i'd say best. yes face masks good use whole day. (some taiwan political figure even suggest steaming mask use next day let's see joke now) jersey thing ever heard. love didnt specify. CoreCivic said learned June 15 employee last Dilley [Detention Center] June 9 tested positive COVID-19. Since then, second employee last worked facility Friday also tested positive, company spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist said. ICE employee works Dilley also tested positive. live close MA/NH border it’s crazy much mask use drops second cross Nashua lol UAE? interesting choice. think phase 3 start Canada Brazil first. lying upset about? can't Google. Like need spoon feed information? 

There whole article Reddit Houston ICU's 90% capacity. think using Children's Hospital house adult patients? 

You want beleive hoax - feel free. playing game. internet works works me. Understatement century There’s Calvary coming us like came NYC.

There’s reinforcements left.

All prevention.

And it’s late start. That's thought, got reduced hours reopened (only socially distance--we full hours wfm back site public sector optics something) realized would like much longer benefits last, I'd better put extra right savings probably still enough. benefits end things actually better, people going need extra money August, September, knows when. Yes, mandatory. No, people follow it. legally argument weaker.

There precedence blanket bans times disease. federal system look kindly states picking fights other.

Also, effect Washjngtonian doesnt mean things same. Obviously us Coloradons would affected differently two policies. Statistics numbers carefully considered within context.

In essence data unreliable due individual country’s method reporting &amp; testing response. pandemic situation really never able compare apples apples, unreasonable, way introduce enough controls make data mean thing across hundreds countries counted. 

My main point is: winners here. 

This global catastrophe, statistical &amp; scientific extrapolations aside, humanitarian standpoint every single death considered life lost rather number.

Edited clarity* Save it. zero interest allowing children die vaccine preventable illnesses also child autism. grow weary idiots using others like excuse leave children open vaccine preventable illness death. barking wrong tree, trust me. Oh sure. Like ones spread MERS camels. But, virus like SARS-CoV-2, need SARS-like coronaviruses become current virus. big part stress aside losing patients lack experience, manage clinical study run couple first year peds residents told, administration didn’t originally additional ICU residents attendings even nurses children’s hospital teams. chief peds residents ended demanding teams shuffled would least one individual COVID relevant experience know-how team. 

I mean hells bells lot residents young suddenly dealing much trauma emotional otherwise. agree opened waaayyyy quick. point hard tell businesses close already gave green light. look intial post, think Florida, Texas Arizona shelter place right Governors need mandate it. Honesly California too, feel bad atleast right FIRST time. you, Fauci, Surgeon General rest medical professionals American government given consistent messaging masks work general public really wearing masks... maybe knuckleheads running around without masks, infecting everyone. record production time vaccine 4 years. 18 months optimistic estimate. Jeeez sad, necessary virus give two shits try justify Damn didn’t know could trace exactly tax dollars go. Pretty cool trying say wuhan locked down? Ah sorry confused it. Thanks.

Italy apparently also coronavirus spreading December based PCR tests waste water. passport, unless established proof permanent residency within EU. careful. also need proof Covid test get flight. Good luck getting don’t symptoms. 

Unless permanent resident Korean blood. course policies couldn’t pass parliament without bit racism thrown in. “RemindMe! 14 days” virus, countries national response produces different outcome.

Don't blame virus... national response virus brought US 'to knees'. walk ride mean? would worked fuck tard Trump job beginning. There’s fact. better America like second dumbest kid classroom. Nothing boast exactly imagine countries financially support citizens? realize U.S. giving far direct benefits (eg cash) pretty much country unemployed? it’s one ones gave flat stimulus everybody. late Lol @ sweet tits Well wonderful. I'm healthcare, really appreciate putting efforts towards 💗 sad hear. think slowing, stopping, dealing virus still higher priority. Well go CDC say thing  We've always great disagree, free find better country. try part. done, personally, improve country? Way go Florida!! agree. Cuomo getting little cocky numbers loving states increases. area done great let’s see happens 1.5 months reopen premed toured university med vet schools. quite clear harder get veterinary school medical school. think necessarily. says can't afford stay home now. entirely possible stayed home, ran money, longer afford stay home. 3rd populous state agreed. currently pregnant NYC need go doctor. feel much safe maternity wards set Bodega require masks. masks. think we're multiple times week now. ain't pro trump though 100%. rudderless nation. nationwide plan fragmented country lost. recovery take longest. Snowpiercer People need use /r/EnlightenedCentrism blame you. facility covid, wore one shift without touching removing it, sucked better getting sick. wear surgicals now. ... figure? Well border closed, we’ll see long. So...this revolution begin? Thanks lot. get 555$ per week? sounds first really good admit. speak germany also pay health insurance? 

If ok Salary maybe good got round 1300€ month unemployment money (+normal benefits like childmoney) + health insurance paid, (Don know word) money Stop working (with small cuts)

I understand stated 16.7 Million unemployments usa arent around 40million...? Sorry tired 04:10... look tomorrow yeah looks first glance beat point thick stick 😀 would great. would love bad americans. Thanks lot insight. Small pp energy.  Good luck wonder germanies meat processing plants 🤔🤔🤔 Patriot literally defended Nazis

Isn't illegal Germany?

wooooo WEEEEE wooooo WEEEE that's sound wokestasi coming you! Good thing stable genius leading country... Corners cut case be.

They’re cutting safety corners. They’re saving time funding bureaucracy. don’t spend months trying find money next stage, they’ve given blank check. don’t wait month random paperwork, it’s getting signed &amp; approved ASAP. 

Also we’re saving soooo much time tons world governments already manufacturing vaccine risk. Sigh. believe you, but... source? ah man plans Trump can’t fire him, relieve task force duties. He’d still national institute infection allergy think? remember talk weird position epidemiological expert seems like good job. 

Except mask thing. 

Side note: lockdown facility happened March access outside world little battery operated radio. thought name Fowchi til got out! growing Asian parents, yes, baby become doctor Less 3 %of folks wearing mask downtown Greenville Saturday. restaurants workers wearing masks. Fewer people masked neighboring counties. SC going bust COVID-19 curve. whole world going quarantine America should. 


Congrats 'merica! really got Covid19 beat! Sick it. I'm sick it. Americans fucking selfish arrogant. need shut border make fucking swim care. Yeah, look fine funerals new haircuts? agree!! working people get help save wealthy corporations! It’s disgusting especially since it’s tax dollars! I'm U.S. resident say is, GOOD!!! HANDLING LIKE SHIT GOING ANYWHERE. American, support message. public response abysmal still large groups ppl fighting tooth nail idea wearing face masks (I mean seriously guys?). Ban us countries get shit together. thinks problems exist anymore grows bored them. privileged life twatwaffle led. I’m curious Trump’s “joke” taken states like FL, GA TX lololololololololololololololololololol would ban us too. Hopefully forceful kick ass get shit together hopes remain low everything I've witnessed past months. person you’re responding didn’t say authoritarian government effectively control covid.  look graphs nations acceleration initial infection effective controls bring number right down. US however graph reached peak, dropped little stayed constant, anything signs another acceleration coming days. New Zealand’s plan travel even low infection countries? would take travelers infected start spread again. “Buy it! Buy it! Buy That’s battle call China’s “King Lipstick,” Li Jiaqi, live streaming beauty product salesman sold 15,000 tubes lipstick five Li one rising number people hawking products China’s e-commerce live streaming platforms. Part salesperson part influencer, push everything Louis Vuitton bags home-grown oranges. millions tuning watch. Places like Texas demonstrate everything that's wrong USA. 5th one down. ""I've directed Federal Reserve whatever takes."" Blowing major smoke. would never it. US military defense EU has. Houston would need implement shutdown prevent ICUs overrun. 

I think know thats never gonna happen. Ohh wording first got bit confused That's racist wtf knew easy stop travel member countries?

Almost concessions oils made Brexit never would happened asterisk next Amber Guyger lived apartment building black man, still safe home. I’m Federer fan, kind saint. gets quite pissy court sore loser. GAH!!! hang there. I'm boat, fighting depression now. hang there. hard. Well, they're estimates based current trends. Obviously things could change curtail numbers then. Like New York, flattened curve. numbers telling *potential* numbers current trends hold.

Edit: BTW, *pick* February 2021 December 2020, that's extrapolated current rates.  Time retraining &amp; finding another industry work in... Ah, that's right - that's covid spread 5g US US version 5g fact teleportation technology.

And yeah, world closes roads, airports, ferries, passenger rail, US also close radio waves. Every time point out, get hate, too. know least U.K., 3-4 months expiry student visa get work visa. can’t find qualifying job (that sponsor visa) time, get kicked out. mentioned Schengen they’re definitely talking UK, looks like restrictions similar everywhere EU (and former EU). mention becoming extremely obvious types people ""need"" regardless pandemic. people would flooding bars, getting hair done, going house parties. overly social elderly seem incapable listening experts, friends tell them. know dipshit 20 year olds know pandemic expert field. 

We're suffering assholes can't handle staying home, home life sucks. Instead fixing it, still need run away. get suffer blowback shitty choices. I'm happy general American. I'm Southern Minnesota, 15 minutes Mankato. 20 business shut two days infection. people ***still*** wearing masks. I've given hope. citizens never pull heads asses. two passports born US EU citizen parents maintained dual since birth.

Thanks information. That’s fact guy said nothing Welp, goes hopes fleeing shithole country. Governor Abbott asshole blood hands. think anything certain states opened back early. someone travel pretences immigration? hell even refugee? humanitarian disaster Soooooo....

Assuming data fro UK correct effectively exactly ratio?

Do even really care cause reality? Hilarious everyone supporting them. Trump wanted ban travel dumb fucks laughed called idiot. people dumbest maggots planet. Yeah last long. Praying won’t damn thing. ""Far more"". load shit.

Both USA Australia (i aussie) 80k-90k tests per million population band. Several others well 100k.  Canadian here. collectively loathe Alaskans visitors moment. Knew blasted border shit Palin era. able return home country (assuming retained home country passport), change. seems like poor thing racism thing. called poor white people suffer consequences? going uphill ways sketch also actually true staff masks. :( terrible take. honestly want saying reason many going die didnt build enough hospital beds, people didnt take seriously? thing people see hurricane unlike virus 

It’s visual aspect makes difference. ""That giant mothership capital go away folks. worry it. Everything total control."" Newsome amazing job managing pandemic. It’s people go science think rights violated. much certain cities counties don’t comply. job, faxes uses internet fax..electronic fax common days. send/receive email email

surprised hospitals call reference lab bc missing result get much quicker fax me. Why? Bc email system many checks filters bs takes hours email like delivered. 

If EMR/LIS/any 12 interfaces lab go else supposed get results out? Walk hospital hand deliver result nurses station? Call find nurse taking care patient email address? fax result nurses station everyone results timely manner. 

If discrepancy pt info system drs office has, results cross interface patients chart. pt. room dr discuss lab results, none. Nurse calls wanting know results are. tell her, oh call department get pull results interface manually match up. cause delay pt care drop patient satisfaction 100% time. fax results drs. Office get results matched electronically fact, minimal delay patient care. Good thing burned cop cars though. Good one. certain sectors like hospitality travel lose 80% revenue, unemployment up, decrease American consumer spending happens affects almost every sector market.

That basic economics 🤣🤣🤣 mean guess better traditional warfare

I'm even sure anymore. US sanctions caused series mass starvation events resulted fatalities wars might have. Please put pressure country keep citizens safe. Please. Vegas trip planned September, cancelled everything last week. can't imagine anything changing next couple months would make feel comfortable traveling. Unfortunately, one great downsides internet gives voices people absolutely expertise area make claims. They're equally loud (or even moreso) people dedicated lives researching topic. “The protesters largely weighing multiple health risks, including health risk Black America.”

This looking this.

Risks like mass starvation example weighed numbers could die Covid.

We need consider things like this:

""More people die economic...fallout die coronavirus"": World Food Program USA this:

While Frets Coronavirus, Another UN Agency Sounds Alarm Shutdown-Induced fact motor vehicle deaths steal American life Covid would reached herd immunity levels transmission. would competent leader white house would benefit. remember many issues coordination H1N1 Ebola. Trump refused use federal power consolidate responses states. conscious choice take crisis seriously. Usually managery looking types. rare, usually covering face so... Hardly matters. don’t even dick Orlando tourism old comorbidities may survive covid19 makes complete sense look handled situation current infection rate. Europe hit peak fell low levels. US hit peak decided opening everything back up. got tired responsible. That's wrong, Holocaust illegal = breaking laws German Reich Nazi regime. Hey real quick, anyone wants see US response reality, google ""covid deaths"", switch ""per 1 million people"" makes level playing field, sort deaths.

Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden, France worse US account population. EU citizens living US?

I dual would much like return see family point next year, even quarantine so. Honestly I'd love lot places America. twist cosmic retribution makes Trump become elected president next term seriously consider moving somewhere else die terrible politicians making bad corrupt choices, awful healthcare crippling medical bills take ambulance ride maybe even get treatment something. America home, good one right now. truly feel you. supposed honeymoon Germany around time trying get vouchers fucking shitshow. actually think best possible do? really think guy trying kill old people took drastic measures prevent outbreak? ADDED requirement hospitals take people testing positive wouldn’t go back nursing home, didn’t remove previous requirement wouldn’t anywhere go. 

It’s madness. Cuomo good job responding emergency state extremely high population almost cases whereas half states heading another wave governors aren’t taking much action. Unspecified... Like 3 300? Blackout curtains directly protect occupant, whereas masks protect people. Pricks selfish.
But said I'm sure refused. Historical accounts revisionist. rarely hear assaults muggings hapoenzd air raid shelters looting bombed houses/buildings. fit blitz spirit narrative. can't. borders closed. Well, well, well, isn’t consequences actions. better immigration policies, mean restrictive? Maybe?

There's pretty huge overlap poor black, least US. pretty hard differentiate one other.

It's like say every poor person fat, every black person fat, every poor black person simply race/wealth. existence poor fat white people rich fit black people undo trends.

Statistically, black people likely poor and/or obese, there's wealth reasons behind (some might genetic predisposition, might historical racism made likely--like redlining denying GI bill benefits Baby Boom). Stay fuck Australia too, guys virus corona veering criminal negligence sort? Doctor friend heard grape vine they’ll looking stadiums hold people know right? 

Tell morons orange county wear mask face fine complying.  Developing nations, like china. Stadium

Heard doctor friend CA heard friend/colleague network stadiums looked someone explain CDC says there's 0.26 mortality rate studies point 1-1.5% mortality rate? thank never heard anyone declaring bk DAP. Medical bills however.... also think mistakes made directions, even arguing about? goddammit...

and course maga hicks dont care dumbasses never even leave shithole hometowns deal absolutes everything political issue. like *hey put economy first wear masks slow spread*

It's media sources dear leader instructed simple affair mask wearing agenda therefore anti-american. I'm actually quite surprised state (IN) rt &lt;1. seems people metro areas taken pretty seriously. know friends rural parts give shits.  sure everyone’s thinking masks restrict freedom...if anything, give freedom things! US developing country travel advisory. love Trump vs Trump tweet mashups. great ones comparing couple ebola cases Obama vs. 120k dead now. yet signs going reverse course.

There signs going close initially, did, even state showing concern order make sure companies like disney held accountable.

How's working Amazon workers Tyson employees? CVS free. proof address bad thing? government needs data contract tracing tracking outbreaks. South Korea enforce cell phone tracking. Supersize? Easy, Pence control. much winning wave wave, watch &amp; learn. surprising well, deserve it.  don't. never said did. argument. best do, no. what's difference Yeah sad becoming issue. Racial tensions time high sides. I’ve reading there’s question long immunity lasts, especially mild asymptomatic cases. There’s lot need learn virus.

The people think it’s hoax think it’s hoax get sick they’re going all, “It happen anyone. I’m trying raise awareness.” “Haphazard” shocking word used provoke interest article That’s exactly problem is. It’s amazing still followers. extent, probably depends many people idea. you’re outside, wearing mask, staying 6ft away anyone besides family, it’s probably fine. However, significant percentage population this. like I'm server, yet I'm deemed ""essential"". Abbott right thing shut state down. Pretty much.   Bahahahahaj fucking moron  conjecture done exercise 14 days ago extrapolated growth percentage way you’ve done here, would difference models be? Please repeat me:

1. positive case always equal sickness.
2. positive case always equal COVID-19 disease.

Ten Italy's top scientists recently signed letter making point vast majority cases Italy longer presenting severe symptoms -- even disease all. note new cases almost ""weakly positive"" cases, asymptomatic cases may even risk contagion transmission (remember doctor said ""very rare.) **Please excuse poor Google Translate translation read context **unequivocal collapse Covid-19 patients symptoms hospitalizations. parallel, surge the** [**so-called 'weakly **cases , researchers around world wondering risk contagion really exists**. new coronavirus epidemic Peninsula described document 'Sars-CoV-2 Italy today Covid-19', s**igned 10 best known scientists, often also protagonists media months health emergency: Matteo Bassetti, Arnaldo Caruso, Massimo Clementi, Luciano Gattinoni, Donato Greco, Luca Lorini, Giorgio Palù, Giuseppe Remuzzi, Roberto Rigoli, Alberto Zangrillo.**  clinical evidence - say 'big 10' - time signaled marked reduction Covid-19 cases symptoms. use hospitalization symptoms attributable viral infection rare phenomenon** asymptomatic paucisymptomatic patients. **The virological evidence, total parallelism, showed constant increase cases low low viral load**.

That's concerned too. live med center massive. also one best rated med centers world. say situations bad know bad. sounds Silly loose maybe 1 Year experience part historical moment. think children ask often done thru pandemic done bali. 

But Yeah sucks fuck virus

Edit: want add little bit loose anytime. Mandatory military service 9 months. 6 months finished mandatory... least military training gamers rise anyone know theoretical capacity state PCR machines? CA enough machines place 195,000 tests per day, taken 3 months ramp 80,000 tests conducted. CA lot medical research facilities imagine many states have. issue wage suppression harms one class people, economic growth benefits different class people.

This depends immigrants selected. Canada uses points system therefore mostly selects highly educated, highly skilled immigrants. suppressive effect mainly hits high end, decreasing social inequality, among people pensions investments benefit growth.

The way adjust effect, immigrants broadly selected, invest things help less well off, like education, health care, child benefits. Well I’m referring fact quarantine entire state New York quarantining visitors states experiencing spikes right two different things shouldn’t compared. Secondly, virus spread world, federal govt taken seriously wouldn’t necessarily spread nyc way did. Thirdly New York gone hell back states country want continue take seriously thousands fellow Americans died god damn right New Yorkers quarantine hell anyone comes state respect. Otherwise it’s like pissing pool never going able get new water. feel you. hope borders open us end year... possible wait next year. totally sucks. rules? Virus decline, numbers claiming otherwise false results amazing testing. Nothing see here. US shit long time. I’m going lie dickhead once. though. walking stairs locker room gym &amp; said teacher panties bunch without knowing bottom stairs. Good times. made us* run laps 45 minutes.

No seriously, agree &amp; it’s problem pandemic. You’ve got people decide right capture, cage, sell/trade/buy different kinds animals. buyers decide right eat/use animals unproven medicinal reasons unsanitary conditions. Time &amp; time viruses continue come specific place selfishness &amp; unsanitary conditions. shit happens, us stuck shitty leadership &amp; brain dead morons elected shitty leaders suffer. It’s tiring paying people’s greed. countries great leadership &amp; people willing follow said great leadership able defeat virus. I’m saying NYer, considered one states track containing virus. about? full nonstop propaganda, even Fauci Birx. They're two experts placed Trump give credibility.

I know meet Trump halfway without fired, can't fully forgive parroting Trump's propaganda.

Oh yeah Surgeon General telling us wear masks.... smh. original comment really doesn’t make sense then. Since even focused “the economy first” countries still wouldn’t opening borders US. 

If anything, without vaccine, likely reach herd immunity sooner NZ therefore NZ keep country closed much longer result. Wuhan United States. Well 10% people responding contact tracers NY saw lots deaths. 

So good luck America. mo neer future 24 day mandatory quaritine. overloaded returning kiwis, see widescale opening others, even would take quaritine.

In future contemplating travel bubbles nations well. looks like practically still discussed depend agreements specific nations. F   Well *do* think unnecessary shutdowns? sounded like said that. Well gonna keep borders control protect citizens expect US assist closing border Canadians?

Just sounds stupid say ''We cannot stop canadians leaving US ban us coming in'' fucking supply chain testing TLDR: 3 new imported case, 9 new domestic cases, 3 new asymptomatic carriers

Translation:

If risk frequent contact risk people, feel free quarantine. I'm putting life hold anymore. TERRIFYING. well...most survived it. Thank you! Bingo. nothing approach people taking *killing* us - ends. would take travelers infected start spread again. 

Not really. Even dozens infected travelers arriving people knew virus existed preparations, turned manageable.

Now we're prepared testing heavily, it'd take large number cases arriving spiral control.

We'd still need testing arrival enforcing quarantine + contact tracing positive cases course, long happens travel allowed similarly low case countries, huge issue two three people test positive. Thank you! Yes, time frame different - proximity people different, sanitation different, margin error different hope. Texas proud Texas tough, may pretty bad lock again.  Wow feel triggering already I’m saying NYer, considered one states track containing virus.

Hello Texas. We're going die here. Good luck we're gone. Criminal. Absolutely criminal trying kill Americans makes even less sense? base ones dying classified WWE essential business. said thing already. That's point. Texas gazillion hospitals newsworthy use Children's hospital manage overflow. I'm curious why, know want hear answer. need ear, pm chat anytime. Ah, good point. Correction noted. Wow really raging hate boner guy huh theory, hospitals getting ready April surge states experience. coming, plans deal this, thing contagious stop hospitals getting overwhelmed (if summer, Fall). true borders US oceans northern southern borders never sealed. look, digged numbers interessted myself, compare genital sizes.

Just one note regarding Sweden, [take look comparing sizes. bit like Canada, much packed south. think huge factor anyway. Chicago bigger Stockholm probably factor.

However, picked Sweden worst case.

Want compare **Austria**? Let's it:

good night buddy! Thank you! paramedic 8 years moved profession 2016. Thank refreshing memory! going good spot thanks COVID-19, I've seen lot high-tech jobs going Mexico too. Guadalajara particular seeing lot jobs think they're sort replacing India outsourcing cases, opposed U.S. jobs. However, one company worked shut Dallas operations opened Mexico City instead. Seriously America. going fuck whole world never let Pandemic end.

It already started EU, fully possible countries follow suit start blocking US visitors due kind insane handling situation. *intensive care units* 90% full. result screening even enter ER, **at all** possible reroute non Covid emergencies surgeries hospitals dealing Covid patients. need set like people like cancer patients sick people die exposed Covid. 

So no, *the hospitals* 90% full, ERs 90% full, cancer wards 90% full, X-ray labs 90% full. ICUs sickest people receive specialty care 90% full. ELI5 Disney employ 78,000 people park? happen know false negative rates?

Wife getting tested morning Who's shit hole country Wow crazy! California shelter place order. Things opening places still shelter place order. dont state income taxes

Why? USA 36,000 FAR BEHIND, WTF GOING ON! It’s insane poorly LA/SoCal dealing things compared parts state. 2000 new cases county alone?? Santa Clara county hotspot things began we’ve 3500 since testing began. can’t imagine 2 days. Makes sense ban country provide healthcare basic human right lets people die streets preventable illnesses Plus still get shit ton money government existing. simple addition universal healthcare sort safety net (UBI?)

Can tell I'm cynical? Lol get reference don’t blame banning travelers place whose President saying reason many cases we’re testing. think indoor dining/bars bigger risk protests, based studies we've seen thus far.

Outdoors safer indoors. Agreed overall. say going “get beer.” Light moderate alcohol consumption incomparable health, all. long didn’t mean 3+ beers (or whatever) it’s probably fine. yes, ways dealing negative emotions besides alcohol extremely good thing. love see 90 year old grandmother, know it’s safe

cvs.com/minuteclinic/covid-19-testing writing wall. use brain someone think airline industry disappointing. country exists earlier generations faced war, many terrible hardships besides, time time. challenges *our* time demand much less, yet we're still soft. Problem is: people wearing masks think virus either big deal hoax really think can/needs go away. mean it’s mutating less deadly? months fighting know handle lot better time won’t serious was? either way would great. One time glared Exactly. Ive around new england month seems almost completely back normal (besides mass vary large number cases.) 2 million. Whew large swaths country people simply taking seriously wearing masks engaging social distancing. post make pour-over coffee removed type grinder suggested shares name conservative politician.

The automod aggressive kinda dumb. Sometimes stating obvious help reiterate importance something. case, significance emphasized due experience expertise subject matter. 

It's surprising people seen something particular, they're experts field thing. Eg, discover something new space, generally assumed people seen something like before, made interesting person dedicated life studying things says seen anything like either. might make argument thing new, course one seen it, important consider expert likely studied subject matter, individual components subject matter. space example, maybe that's mass something, shape, surrounding objects etc, finding something individual components they've studied becomes much significant layman. 

That's what's going here. expert remarking he's never seen something characteristics coronavirus, that's much significant saying we've never seen before. lockdown?

\-Americans Sorry. gotta make .1% money. Floyd killed Memorial Day. not? needs leader get way, inaction killing people. Self employed wouldnt give unemployment No, don’t think that’s Hell works. arrogant think could inform ME? I’ve intention reading biased propaganda all. FILE LITERALLY SAYS 70% NON COVID PATIENTS. EVER OCCURRED MORONS TELLING PEOPLE PUT MEDICAL PROCEDURES/APPOINTMENTS 3 FUCKING MONTHS CAUSE BACKLOG END 3 MONTHS????? USE COMMON SENSE HOLY SHIT SUB DUMBER EVER COULD’VE POSSIBLY IMAGINED safe! If?  Death rates second peak lower first peak gotten better protecting elderly high-risk people. man family county. people. Well could bailed citizens instead business 14k per citizen would helped ton. Force companies freeze collections agree. hope happens late. Dr. Yealy part “reopenPA” movement Texas ain’t got idea shit. 

Except Texans know heart hearts we’re truly totally fucked. Nobody could've predicted this. 






/s thanks incredible insight always WHO

in news, props weathermen predicting rain started raining. -Police can't trusted act responsibly. record harassing/beating/killing citizens even committing crimes (I agree one)

-Let's make sure act going outside house requires police intervention. Nothing go wrong there, saving 100k lives! tell lady left mid 50s trophy wife face lift?

Yikes. ""but, muh freedumbs!""   Fuck’n finally! came house small fire kitchen threatened burn rest house down.

We began putting fire out, residents upset getting everything wet, complained water damage causing.

We got fire kitchen put out, spread adjoining hallway.

""You came put fire kitchen out, out, want anymore water damage, leave"" protested residents

So packed left, house burned hour later.  get accurate number support let's go ahead dump retirement age opinion already get government cheese. father-in-law would probably support he's mooching us things going super dicey us second shutdown. 

In words lol yeah right.

Also, sure would rather return lock also think can. question loaded. Good luck. shoes, though test came house. I'm treated aggravated asthma. Negative COVID test, chest x-ray clear, fever, seasons changed since cough started, allergies. process elimination, must asthma. population size, spread. Houston Dallas, Dallas Austin, Austin San Antonio, 900,000 people them, count hospital capacity state numbers (all rural clinics, hospitals Lubbock Amarillo near full capacity counted towards available beds)

But can't move people one city another. Dallas Lubbock five hour drive. Houston Dallas. numbers look like we're okay state, city level, aren't. Wow sucks sorry. I’m mri tech Florida it’s literally opposite situation. half patients pre covid, front desk calls every patient like multiple times make sure coming remind come. boss desperate patients right now. Honestly drive state possible. get mri done today. people would rather lockdown, safe, working. However, people also need money live! still remember sub English language discussion Covid mostly racist jokes conspiracy theories (face palm) friends unemployed since lockdown began still received unemployment stimulus. ""our"".  
I'll check map one. pencilled 200,000 American dead November elections. Nah, they'll cough anyone bitches them. IHME model one unreliable there. News agencies stop reporting it. Okay, hear out. refugees actually gave fuck never left houses minimize expose? Come on, even put isolation! get fuck FL lol. It’s worth . Panic hysteria fueling train . believe moron

If think that’s argument, redditor. call text wall? even page. wonder Redditors famous reading title articles.

It took five minutes write that. Surely would take less time read. time vocal opinions, surely time inform least little first, **if** actually concerned pandemic. Idea would ""printing money"" buys us enough time get vaccine hopeful return normalcy. 

It sounds like could vaccine end year get really lucky. would required strong federal government order come pass. Thunderdome awaits. Must nice make small correction- conversion rates make sense purchasing products services foreign currency area.

When actually look purchase power parity (the rates currency conversion try equalise purchasing power different currencies, eliminating differences price levels countries), consumer, ability pay goods, services, living costs, PPP conversion CDN 1.2 instead current currency conversion rate 1.36. realistically $2000CDN would $1666USD USD consumer govment tries implement equivalent. 

Just small note, matters comparing monthly would also add CERB program came federal government. matter Canadians think Justin, truly great leadership working provinces implement shut downs provide relief there. provincial government B.C. done pretty outstanding job well. needs evidence. citation. Canadian dev, sure hope so! enough time ever understand people way are. people finding polls?! I’ve never seen anywhere participate None measures used China used Belarus 362 Covid deaths.

So, authoritarian regime think telling truth?  Hard reading. didn’t get headline all. read article saw it’s roughly quarter COVID patients. 

Regardless, u/unknownmichael u/najumobi pointed out, maximum capacity ICU beds almost reached. new patients go? literally trying prevent happening (remember “flatten curve”?). 

The headline never suggested mostly COVID patients never interpreted way, still alarming.  ""Taking leadership position national crisis Un-Popular!"".

And many countries strict measures, people charge become popular.  return Anti-Mask Brigade. Good. I’m cool whatever long federal EDD benefits keep going early tell. seen early opened states. takes 3 4 weeks show. First unnoticed cases go spread it. spread week 2 3 infection cycles lacking testing comparison active case count first start noticing impact. Give 2 weeks see. masks thing personally doubt coverage enough mitigation places got wild. one distancing helps since lot mask users wear improperly. presence mask alone helping anybody. secondly tear gas. Oh boy tear gas. know much impact respiratory disease helped stopped facing Gases make cough cry that. 

I saying protests necessary thing, definatly. beneficial terms mitigating pandemic.

Which important? That's individual decide. can't blame 2 options. Pro BLM protest despite pandemic crowd well protest pandemic crowd legit way. Thanks info America dudes. _not_ referencing transgender people, referring clinical condition transgender, absolutely correct usage.

[It's literally English language medical n95 masks  Says murican.. lol. Yeah. really seen friends since shit started. taken toll mental health, I've got inherited heart problems weak immune system, it? sacrifice mental health life, risk life save mental health? mean, that's democracy works. leadership listens people scream loudest, educated ones. one current climate lmao. Cities need money, states need money. Everyone hates police. 

shit strongly enforced prohibiting public defecation. public comments Palm Beach, Florida mandatory mask wearing says Federal government nothing first shutdown. real bad second wave, economy maybe worse shutdown. Damned do, damned don't. much time have? Billions bail banks. put billions hands people money would move economy sustain lockdown recovery period.  Even better populations. when? That's direction headed anyway. It’s late 3 biggest states AZ everyone else could avoid second shutdown mask wearing widespread. Sadly mask wearers even employees stores city stopped masking up! desperately needs enforced. Same, except never see masks. Even couriers stopped wearing them, first start months ago (I've always worked home, luckily, went ahead quarantined fuck embraced delivery). 

IDK. going real dark I'm terrified family members. They're careful, they're also older already great health. *when Kind want donate dollar penny whatever minimum call shit comments funding page. Utilizing ostrich method see I'm doubting numbers get we're still getting 30k infections day. US sprawl many potential hotspots contain it? protests? feel like we've made progress last month. far worse happen. Ask black people. Jews. pretty much everyone would right think money grows trees? Would like government wipe butt too? That’s one convincing hoax. That's true Canada well. government talking legal action fines people claim covid benefits could go back work, regardless health concerns mean this? like “why can’t release placebo vaccine? hear placebo effect real”

Then proceed release mere weeks election anyone realize shit doesn’t work. Nobody wants return Lockdown. 3 months income means business owners broke. average person cannot afford go Lockdown week. Let alone months... China playing 4D chess world domination Remember president said would gone April?  Yeah can't lockdown anymore without financially destroying myself. I'm current child support still harass every week. cannot fathom falling behind. Fuck it. put jail. mean castrated? would point massacring Florida's pp? can’t believe people still trying look Sweden beacon hope. highest death toll Scandinavian countries want say FAT people disproportionately HIGHER RISK DEATH Covid. weird teenager died COVID FAT?

Just fat. eat much. Stay healthy take vitamin D. time hugboxing, telling like is. hope least kids take warning young age protect unhealthy. think knew that, started writing got mad lol. comment, situation ""Don't turn back God's breathing system""? What? He’s smart.

While base thinks he’s playing 4D chess, he’s actually playing 1D snakes ladders time. COVID-19 cases surge back virus’ peak [5 states hit record I'm saying keep overstaffed time, yes, maintain support systems tech empowers run kinds problems. did, maybe system could efficient like Canada's, 30% needy stuck income months lockdown.

Keeping systems maintained cost much funding actual payouts. Like said, state specifically allocated funding almost decade ago, funds squandered re-allocated people worried support systems expensive. we're paying nose train thousands temporary employees decades old software, also paying ton develop deploy new software, save money time skipping upgrades. NEW: Brazil reports 42,725 new cases coronavirus, second-highest daily increase record worldwide, 1,185 new deaths Personally, Healthcare worker, I'd rather let others rather get vaccine first. adverse effects, wanna one get fucked kind girl died, fucking asshole. say ""fuck "" reckon pandemic canceled ! people never change mindset. they've lived life privilege slight inconveniences violation privilege minds. majority country can’t afford hit. important correctly first time. are. think states need consider shutting people need reconsider travel plans, hanging bars indoor spaces, etc. Abstaining voting remotely equal particular candidate. trust call scary! think people think elective think boob job 🤷🏼‍♀️ Correct! people going die belly full bone steak evenly tanned face. Worth it! They're **decreasing** testing, possible reason decrease testing, US testing still low(per capita) comparison countries temporary money system times crisis? Smeckles example. Money value based people thinking worth damn. government made emergency currency used usa. Would help think job extraordinarily important public. important saying president lying. 

We know president lying. know people saying it. listen don't. Fauci saying anything others respected already said. 

But one else leading US vaccine initiative think many would well did.  Distancing hand washing much important masks. People acting like cloth masks make everything safe what's causing secondary outbreaks. Came metaphor describe currently seeing US regards numbers trends

The current situation U.S. could compared ants getting home apartment.

Two weeks ago saw ants outside. swarm dead lizard. didnt really worry it. virus breaking China. 

Then week ago, saw couple ants kitchen. smushed em finger laughed sorta wiped counter truly clean up. 

The next day, kitchen swarmed. clean kitchen thoroughly, cook days, now, ants around still, clean everytime cook. numbers staying pretty small. happend Northeast. 

But cleaning kitchen, went started getting recycling. took recycling kept getting really bad, sweep mop floor decent number ants stuck around. Even though gone, started putting things recycling food, swarming recycling again. happened places like Georgia, Missouri, Washington state. responded, actually enough stop community spread. re-openings, spots surging again. 

And finally, always random plates dishes left around house. cleaned first day, ants never really got plates. started getting lazy last days leaving stuff again. last days, ants recycling kitchen found plates swarming random places around house found food. happening places like California Arizona. dodged first wave, partially luck partially lockdown, feeling first surge current behaviors limiting spread. 

&amp;#x200B;

We cleaned goddamn house gotten lazy. Understandable. please cautious so.  Ah, yes. Nothing ever happens. wealthiest country world can't afford anything. Europe great, they're certainly better right now. Election day can't come soon enough. He's got go. if....we round rona send showers?

*risky joke* automod aggressive kinda dumb.

No doubt Another reason spreading badly - photos beaches every article new outbreaks. Even CA keep mentioning family get togethers clusters outbreaks.

Those sources outbreaks way rest planet sees - beach probably one least likely places infect others family get together important INFECTED ARRIVED. family get together spreader event result things going on, source. 

I'll bet anything offices responsible lot outbreaks, nobody wants look admit this. fact matter places reopening, even restaurants unless work there, office exposed person infected longest perfect conditions transmission assuming open windows stale recirculated air.

Bottom line - want us work commercial real estate prices crater, even unnecessary cause WFH pretty much everything covered fast enough internet. 1000 standard formal polling across world, considered typical sample size Gallup poll, either traditional stand-alone poll one night's interviewing Gallup's Daily tracking, 1,000 national adults margin error ±4 percentage points Malarkey *you* scrolled note someone else already said that.

But thanks aggression evening. Wow. even thinking that. might get point stupid go outside, period. even directly covid reasons. risk injury increases dramatically getting car. hospitals overloaded becomes high risk activity. didn’t say didn’t trust did. held waited like said. pointing happen. oncology team pushed kept date hospital pushed back. People using total cases percent positive metrics interchangeable. regional areas CA hotspots though AZ’s shitshow nearby isn’t favors. referred Snopes... sourced links. referred woman literally KNOWN discredited! chance (outdoors, masks) vs. bunch time indoors someone touching you.

First, never said same. added shit yourself. So, screw disingenuous start.

Second, study done showed impact one person ideally washed hands mask spreading virus building 5-10 people 20 minutes time, vs 2 thousand people outside within distance (inches) hours? Oh, cant tell that? Exactly, stop trying spread BS like scientific way important other.

Thats opinion. fact, Many people dont agree you. there's that. virus also give shit, important trying act like similar. horrible horrible thing pushing. wtf wrong you?

Your inability even understand argument, explained, seems problem. Maybe emotional use brain next time.  Trump administration halting federal funding 13 coronavirus testing facilities** end July, including seven Texas. Texas testing sites particular concern state’s cases spike, 5,000 new confirmed cases day. Tuesday, [Gov. Greg Abbott advised stay home gave mayors county judges authority restrict gatherings 100 people. 

Welp... guess testing coronavirus?   Organ damage doesn’t magically go poof disappear 13 months. 200 yesterday? curve flattened, open 'er received stimulus yet either. absolutely help finding at. like oh well. Ridiculous! Guess I'm fucked! Meanwhile ex, who's prison got his. Stop emotional whiny. WW3 tier event illness time fancy around it. fat want lessen chance critical result. SIMPLE best friend getting married August. 70 people. think it’s insane. didn’t spend last 3 months staying away people that. make
Me feel less crazy. aren’t crazy. Thank you. Remember said go 60,000? 'member. needs to, think current administration. Biden better make steps towards this. Florida needs circumcised Someone please kill bot - right keeps getting way.

You bad, bad, bot. Stop it. people don’t go outside isolating keeps people go outside safe. Karen festival anger good reason. police stopped enforcing laws since protesting began?

And then, matter fact? realize governor Texas prohibited local governments closing businesses requiring people wear masks, right? much letting decisions made locally. started one person. people's view I've talked last week ""Well really bad opened up. reacted"" 


So people wearing masks going business usual. 



Shits bad US. fucking stupid hurts need virus higher gain function. Something let’s say 30% lethal. shut fuckers one way another. starting. Since people relaxed, R^o going go we're going learn exponential growth means hard way. Make illegal wear mask public enclosed spaces.

Big fines plus jail time breaking law.

These idiots stay home, go jail, wear mask.

All good outcomes. 

I’m patient fools. assume co worker can’t use calculator conservative estimate. 1.7 million people would die reach herd immunity. That’s 350 million people. Assume 70% conservative. That’s 245 million needing become immune infection. conservative IFRs around .7% accurate would result 1.7 million dead. I’ve missed modelers. look forward return wildly divergent daily forecasts. People want spend indefinite amount time sitting home.  wont would way fucking less without president telling everyone virus liberal conspiracy take down. quite literally turned friend posted 24 hour wait stand alone ERs San Antonio, hours upon hours waits actual hospital ERs. point you’ll accept won’t getting help. it’s terrifying Yeah, fat higher chance suffer COVID. many COVID patients intensive care units fat unhealthy. fat folks, stay safe Dont forget Utah! We've setting records daily.  Like anarchy fun parts I'd like know 6 months pandemic, already increased avaliable medical equipment/ICU beds now? Thats we've done Kangarooville. 

Apparently everyone seems forgotten point lockdown; get hospitals ready. we're opening back despite coming reasonably close containing/eliminating rona - cases daily - bo apparent plans actually reinforce lockdown again.

Nobody listening, nobody wearing masks (and we're still lied - even refused sale n95 masks yesterday frontline people need them, apparently rona knows cares wears mask) lockdown eased, everyone forgot existed. 

For part anyone lockdown followed social distancing, now, much. I'm personally coming across people think hoax. Lets keep ignoring tho..its real virus. Racism doesnt exist. White power. Wait what? Anyways brunch tomorrow. #backtonormal #dickshit2020 can't wait friends summer ignoring death corruption! Lolol love life! #GodsChild #WorkhardMakemoney know downvoted

Because obviously true. last GFC (that US caused) China managed keep growth throughout. whilst large economy like US really screw things rest world, really weight think force things. guess weight steadily decreasing tariffs etc. cut global economy. SOMETHING! Also first line doctor's Wikipedia Anne Mikovits former American research scientist known discredited medical claims ""swing vote"" trumps second election still moron. get enough evidence done still capable need reconsider reproduction.

Edit: got ask something. guy neither catholic patriot. build wall (3 miles it), fuck wall way, replace Obamacare, made worse, fucked position middle east (aka let's leave bases Russians), dimished position world pulling us trieties, agreements. sold country's interests reelection chances Turkey, Russia, China. hugging Kim. give poor money, better Healthcare system schools. witnessed biggest transfer wealth rich twice (tax cuts covid pseudo relief) . fucking environment, divide us racism bigotry. literally killing people making believe need masks testing. question: fuck still keeps thinking may somehow redeemable this? Yeah government implemented universal healthcare, free/ cheap college tuition, increased minimum wage lower class would greatly improve good luck getting government anything benefits poor. optimistic believe Senators/Representatives go corporations pay campaigns. 35% Americans live Texas? way want go back Lockdown. way important depressive episode avoid covid. One definitely survive could. Narrator: was. Exactly. think watch parts SA see future northern hemisphere. also ***English version*** scroll down. really happen state local levels. virus hotspots inflict lockdown entire country, vice versa.

It needs handled way, we're really screwed. fact, we'll opposite that, spread lies, sue states reclaim pandemic money (which already repay anyway). embraced masks could sold branded masks. whole thing makes zero sense me.  Please do. 

I'm American, deserve it. Yeah I've got family buddies east saying thing. weekend brutal, there's huge gatherings beaches parks. know we've well compared states think people cavalier going bite us hard things going get worse even gets cold/flu season end year. I'm talking ON, aware details provinces Unfortunately ban would likely struck unconstitutional. Mandating 2 week quarantine bad idea even logistically difficult. issue would best solved Federal action course sadly positive leadership front.

Constitutionality:  Can't wait Karens throw fits wear masks post Facebook unfairly they're treated can't check crowded hospital. Let say left retoric resentment towards rich, everything else extreme right... guess extreme left extreme right make full circle meet end sanity.
Bit regardless left right asshole bankrupt Mexico left home 2 months supposed move northern europe partner. expected 2 week quarantine. ouch Texan shit makes sad lol. Watching wear mask try careful group unmasked jackasses crowd bar street. 

*”CuS ViRuS DiEs hEaT rIgHt?”* Texas want kids back summer school. Obesity usually choice. would go far say, 99.99% obesity USA choice.

Like addictions, hard get away obesity stay fit.

Just one wants fit, easy staying home putting mask out, make fit. Where? see it. played games month trying make cities figure get around orders. Abbott literally said ""I'm glad Bexar county finally figured out"". He's playing games. **Total Sample Tested** : 7, 352, 911

- Covid-19 Well. 33% positive means 3-6x many tests we're actually are, regardless actual number is. alarmingly high positive rate... EU courage actually this, should. country, *any country* botched response therefore epicenter pandemic, EU even waited second put blacklist. US special one already late, Texas Medical Center predicting surge ICU capacity exhausted 7/7. Keep mind, cases keep rising two weeks lockdown order seen community masks. family/friends gathering like nothing going on. Californian lady complaining time spent Japan ""most Japanese clothes fit skinny Asian people ass"" ""no one spoke English spoke little English impossible make good connections people"". Proceeded call shithole. Blows mind  good Fuck country. It’s prison. What's wood like knom? DeSantis? Australia New Zealand enforce mandatory 14 day quarantine international entry. fail covid test that, guess what, still allowed out.

You could hardly described dictatorships Definitely didn’t Sarahan dust cloud US 2020 Apocalypse Bingo card. economy-first people shown zero ability think one step ahead. Good example [this don’t click link:

First-order thinking fast easy. happens look something solves immediate problem without considering consequences. example, think I’m hungry let’s eat chocolate bar.

Second-order thinking deliberate. thinking terms interactions time, understanding despite intentions interventions often cause harm. Second order thinkers ask question “And what?” means thinking consequences repeatedly eating chocolate bar hungry using inform decision. you’re likely eat something healthy.  way US does, no. states way power countries ones do. United States like cross country EU. young, young people ruining things going bars coughing sneezing completely capable emitting droplets without mask. coughing sneezing cloth mask near sufficient need isolating.   Congrats, you’ll love Netherlands! It’s incredibly nice country. 

It’s worth research ahead time make live easier get there. 

For example banks website apps English, banks let open account get ID card. getting phone plan, etc. 

You eligible bunch social benefits, get signed up. Rent subsidy, subsidized health insurance, stuff like that. 

Food clothing seem cheaper US, electronics probably bit pricy. 

Oh, bring ton ibuprofen, can’t get there. worries. too. Worldometer, Arizona's state dashboard, ect sources. I'm desperately attempting make sense everything looking opinions data gathered. Absolutely one paying attention NY right now. cases state 300k 300 listed serious. virus new beginning, 40 50% NY deaths sticking patients nursing homes. Thus huge amount deaths NY.

This part reason COVID cases cause rise non COVID related deaths. Deaths get added tally. also main point lockdown. another Italy rip old people ventilator leave die save resources sombody else. systems already straining like need go another hard lockdown immediately. Hollywood powerful drug. state governments openly helping hide case counts. fucking pathetic. seen husband year. supposed see April flights got cancelled. news devastating Based safest person planet. tested daily. Everyone around tested, temperature checked masked. surroundings scrubbed disinfectant around clock. lives germ free bubble yet scoffs anyone follows guidelines. Man im jealous. Ive wearing masks months. rest Arizona, much. Well there's fucking surprise. made laugh hard want national testing program, that.

you mean, like Congress job. executive want stockpile medical equipment second wave, that. 

$16Billion Strategic National Stockpile American expat northern Italy here. 

Firstly, strict, country-wide lockdown, couldn’t even leave house except essentials. enforced, area (one affected Italy) police civil protection patrolled sure nobody flaunting decree. Fines given skirted rules. 

Secondly, since opened last month, masks required everywhere. area, fact, obligatory even outdoors weeks (and though they’re obligatory you’re outside anymore, pretty much everyone still wearing one even walking around town). part, everyone still complying wearing masks. 

It’s easy comply mask thing you’ve seen things go totally rails, think. I’m hearing friends family back US cases still deny it’s problem downplay it, know fact lockdown US family members friends still hanging friends seeing people regardless, strictly forbidden Italy. 

And thirdly, free access health care here. suspect I’m sick here, even something small insignificant, go doctor without second thought. worrying copays, taking time work, insurance, etc. None really issue here. 

Additionally, lots areas designated specific hospitals COVID19 treatment, think cut spread unaffected less-affected hospitals. 

The Premiere, Giuseppe Conte, also good job clear leader voice whole country throughout last months, gave frequent reassuring updates tv. definitely sense unity Italy issue. 

Sorry novel, observation American this. tsunami hit us, it’s massive relief seeing things get better. I’m cautiously optimistic, though. ya gonna work? Mask everyone, social distance, keep indoor occupancy low, test contact trace hell everyone, institute regular payment duration help people businesses trouble.

PSYCH! Fuck it, Texan/Floridian/Arizonan, we'll send work like nothing going on. Good news hospitals full drown lung secretions crippling bills family. That's great man. things. Leave alone now. want disappear year mountains. Fake Hostel? never reopen know cases spiking, reopen isolate problem. California man finna new Florida man Might well throw bunch war bond parades 4th July make even like fall 1918.  Re-read thread buddy masshole screw RI NH drivers. Everyone else screw too, especially NH RI. New York drivers, cool literally get surgical mask free. Right? can’t sneak Europe masquerading Canadian. South America, countries building things impede Brazilians go there. Paraguay building wall impede Brazilians entering. Aussie we've closed borders everyone including students multi billion dollar industry. Trump??? Lol! kind world live in? Banned Canada Mexico also US bubble  Lets see long MLB thing lasts. Depends many players get hit COVID 19 start season. US citizen, blame them. total failure here. Unfortunately failure starts top dumbest man country, controls ensures failures him. $1400 super big deal? Moving countries already seems like pretty big hassle. What's $1400 top that? I'm defending anyone here, data standpoint, disengenuous compare straight number deaths population 330,000,000 people vs 5,800,000 people. death rate % actually appropriate compare covid responses. Masks work AAL puts. ground!! Last year asthma got triggered. pretty mild moved back living abroad guess body like, “hey, remember place! Aren’t supposed freak here?!”

Got breathing treatment, inhaler taking Singulair ever since. pandemic occurred I’d control, first I’d probably think virus. Second, honestly don’t know uncomfortable would stuffy sometimes now. collection masks courtesy mom, comfortable others. sometimes wear 5 hours, occasional breaks work I’ve managed. inconvenient, helps? Last year, sorely reminded much sucks breathe right. I’d rather experience anything worse. basically, Texas Lombardy February right Tom Brady afraid. would be?

He's got Spice Melange. EU banned travelers China Trump did, situation would bad US EU. I'm surprised place actually decided close. Seems like everyone everything hell-bent staying open despite rising cases. After? reduced cases stringent measures high compliance. cases low enough, return many things normal level keep testing / tracing keep low.  fucking thank we're good fam Jesus fucking Christ fire. There’s way isn’t ironic comment, it’s unironic long don’t believe is... yep...there's much bailout money slushing around wall street banks crazy. could true too. Always open suggestions. comfortable going full Karen anyone. also tell ones Americans loudly tell Europeans country speak English. reality actually give shit economy, would've accepted stay home/quarantine orders actually worn masks measures would've minimised impact pandemic economy.

They threw hissy fit got told one many times contravention ""muh freedums"", used excuse primary concern economy order mask (pun intended) totally self-centred reasoning acting ways made situation worse basically everyone, including themselves. Notice shit many protesting inability get haircuts, go gym, etc., none good reason wearing mask beyond mildly uncomfortable. economy; they're self-centred anti-intellectual believe they're 'done' deadly virus, deadly virus done (and everyone knowingly expose refusing stay home and/or wear mask). Sewage testing Covid-19 shows dramatic increase virus yellow phase (Erie, PA) Exactly. Disney normal day pure hell throw sweaty face masks recent surge %positive / cases plain dumb go running around saying black lives matter? Far white people killed police. Palmetto State = South Carolina. Googled you. sources that, seems like interesting read Yah, SoCal idiots refuse wear masks live. I'm NoCal, Bay Area, glad here. still fireworks telling everyone watch house going shoot higher. highly doubt people aren’t going venture might well throw huge war bond parade also, get drift. problem state could still reopen schools. 

I Bay Area. 100% clear stop reopening places, strict people wearing masks. Instead county ignoring spike already see, opening gyms almost every place, basically ignoring clear evidence weeks major numbers people infected spreading virus. People East Bay pretty much given social distancing. kids teams practicing masks precautions (30 kids close contact).  

Right county state ignoring disaster. schools also ignore this.  

""The economy can't afford reopen"" lie parroted many people.  

I actually think, though, many people dying open schools.  worst way make decision. need tighten controls slow reduce spread CA. happening.  least every major city need this. I'm mass town employee. Even logic anti mask crowd ""I fucking hate wearing thing, still wear store isnt fault (store employee) requiring wear thing. reason give hard time it"" saw photos caravan going beach said going outcome something Important everywhere work. Twatwaffle awesome word. spreadneckers maskholes. That's freezer trucks for. Fuck! blame them? Sadly, stuck here. like we're actually living David Lynch movie - bad David Lynch movie! Honestly wish state could ban people states coming in. We've first wave, love it, we're whole-assing second one. course people sparsely populated states getting started start showing up, we're going get another round. Yay.  would enforce it? Serious question. right travel part 'liberty' citizen cannot deprived without due process law Fifth Amendment. That's different though.

It's like saying ""you can't stop people traveling, people get suck seas!!!!""

As I'd thing exceptions regulations such, opposed idea permanent, unwavering thing.

Absolutely every company can, forced make way home work. can't, prove it, go there.

Anyone leave house work, can. Many don't. Many work location exist bosses watch like fucking hawk.

Limiting answer here. one saying one anything. less people need able absolutely anything please.

Instead, short sighted people fucked economy, killing people per day south, whole north east starting really heal. fucking stupid, yet blame going towards trying help curve issue.

If close down, jobs closed now, would shut naturally never reopen. business represents death, people going go there. We've prevented people believing WELL people think fucking hoax. not, we've done better world projected, said projections... want NoVa. worth gotta take rest. Well one hell night show ;) Guessing remove NY NJ chart, would show rest US increasing course. Sorry say, wont. We've got choice dimentia ridden figure head annoying orange. Please don’t take things context. 

The ‘quarantine’ Cuomo talking 14-day requirement state entrants stay home, involved New York converted containment area non-essential travel state prohibited.  Local courts could stay closed...... Imagine Americans wearing masks, think inmune noticed provinces best tend rural major cities like Montreal still plenty cases.

Actually live Toronto made point, right density here, there's 5M people here, cases actually going average, that's densest gets. true cannot compare NYC Newark regions, also said NY state one state actually handling well, actually to. I'm patting back, I'm stating facts; nationally municipally, hot spots trending down, nationally guys climbing even though densest part country (NY) finally gotten trend downwards, alarming criticized holding spring break opening beaches “too early” fewer deaths per capita Denmark

There's lot cultural differences probably contribute, I'd imagine one largest ""personal space"" bubbles world (Scandinavian countries general) helped contribute, believe also high participation mask wearing. Likewise, friends family living Hong Kong Taiwan, previous widespread cultural use masks also helped keep R numbers well, despite comparable densities cities US, following lead reopening allowing slightly larger gatherings similar US’s gradual re-opening started ease around mid April onward, deaths per day trending down, still are. sure continue south moving indoor season, time tell.

From tell news, nobody strictly ever enforced anything except NY state, state seems handle far. Everything else seemed pretty laissez-faire, could wrong open corrected saying higher number new cases younger people, death rates go exponentially younger cohort, gotten clinically better, possible deaths continue fall despite rise cases, time tell. Time also tell Canada sees spike indoor season starts again.

Agreed, hope sakes goes down, would imagine it'll get difficult southern states already fire, indoor season full swing, get worse. Canada, winter lot group activities outdoor based like skiing, snowboarding, winter camping, winter hiking, outdoor rinks skating, hockey, also dependent social circles cultural habits. Good luck guys, said, want guys beat this, family US well, want see shit get worse, definitely looking super bright since guys infections rates \*higher\* initial peak, without NYC contributing.

A sports analogy seems apt here; break arm, try go play football weeks done healing, likely break make worse. Wait full healing period, much likely play injury free longer. Nobody likes quarantine shutdowns, ignoring re-aggravating injury going cause infections complications. Good news bad news then...

Is fluff piece thought seen references eggs US protected part national stockpile....

But link validates Outdoors + Masks California reported update, 7000 new cases COVID 19. Sorry loss. Imagine thinking it’s 

Wow Good info. see chart showing ""unsustainable"" hospital capacity 3 weeks?

Keep hoping puppies rainbows, weeks, Texas fucked. northeastern states fewer large demonstrations subsequent lower rate infection New York definitely outlier.

Speculating, perhaps first epicenter, became better adapted necessity, including higher rate wearing masks better social distancing awareness. Also curfew enacted NYC pretty strictly enforced, higher proportion not-so-peaceful acts initial week regions, dispersed little impunity.

The disposition leadership also likely played role, concerned enough risk actually publicly *discourage* participation defend enforcement curfew dispersion less peaceful rest New York State reopened May 22, NYC begun reopening businesses *June 8*, largest demonstrations already occurred.

It quite likely **combination** reopening protests *synergistic*, creating greater risk sum either isolation. Virginia infection rate decline faster states, despite fully reopened May 28 also 11 large protests, lends support theory.

*Edit: reword things apparently mentioning names leaders position p l c l think governors, bodies charge, would start questioning plans decisions knowing what's going states. hah could happen though time line. Quiet! Trump want hold rally there. Right, cardiac arrest associated Covid.

Like, common way people die isn’t “Covid,” it’s pneumonia *caused* Covid aware countries around world reacted appropriately pandemic, able continue operate U.S. suffer another economic setback, right? Holy shit. comment deserves gold. putting one set deaths another. Social distancing extremely relaxed California. Many counties changed mask requirements “recommendations”, restaurants opened dining, people generally without much regard. 

This increase cases especially seen poorer areas California wherein people don’t give fuck cannot afford give fuck due personal financial situations.  Remember everyone said sun heat would slow spread? aged well Yes. That’s exponential growth part. 
It’s 1 person infecting another, another again. It’s 1 person infecting 2 (for 3 positives), infect 2 (7 positives), infect 2 (21 positives). It’s called r value. It’s 2 real life, it’s higher 1. many normal it? 

Here’s hint...it’s 110k People need someone step up. leadership. baseless opinion gonna back something? Keep fighting good fight. know random person internet appreciates effort. Really?!??! Opening early proper safety guidelines makes people sick. Never would thought wishful thinking Ah yes, 'community' 'shared future'...I suppose million Uyghurs locked camps _are_ community shared future, indeed. stories missing one key component. unlikely go bar night symptoms. reality likely guy GAVE others bar, reverse. Yeah get it. states pretty much completely open month now. county live little mask usage public places, we've sitting around 600 cases like 2 weeks now. I'm happy it, make sense Return? day 100 quarantine me. Unless something week, see Florida compete New York #1 cases.

And fraction deaths. Great Job Florida! shall remain unnamed supporters. 4 years make shit disgusting. Comedy tragedy. Unfortunately, that’s takes. new update. California reported 7000 new cases new update. 65? Nobody right drive car public roads. Regulations restrictions driving violate anybody's rights.

Mandating person wear (or wear matter) article clothing authoritarian overreach directly violates people's rights.

You advise beg people wear want, cannot mandate it.

You certainly can't decree high masks required ""or else"" like Newsom California. motherfucker going get sued oblivion possible even face charges freedom override that.

Nothing, mean LITERALLY NOTHING, overrides freedom. God damn, grow kid. wave Latin America hopefully cases region grow 2-2.25 million July deaths doubled 200,000.

Pretty sure still first wave. I'll need look it. Good question. Taiwan CECC give answer day two average protester spent, maybe, eight hours total around people? Contrast tens millions people living entire day real covid precautions. mention protests outdoors largely higher mask use elsewhere.

The protests highly visible, way likely get family member coworker. Must wind. LA apparently biggest outbreak spot country know LA many protests past 3 weeks.... Yes, protests form pretty much every city California. time even somewhat also reopening businesses relaxing shelter place orders. know well able distinguish two effects college educated acquaintances pushing masks don’t work hype dumbest evidence back up. Even know OSHA certified trainer saying masks don’t work even though osha says otherwise website. It’s extremely frustrating. tell Jesus fucking idiots. Literally deny reality turn around accuse everyone ""politicizing everything"" 

No mother fuckers reality.

""Well quarantined weeks curve started going down, PART want go out""

Mother fuckers want go out, wear mask, party, anonymous orgies. guess what? There's pandemic. one 2 months ago, said vaccine least year, probably would second third wave

#Y'ALL EVEN MAKE FIRST WAVE live Richland too. Love PSA made little towns, too. wish he’d spoken 45 earlier, sure love ended saying it. American, awe competence decency kiwis. knew corruption incompetence government, us understood exactly deadly could be.

You guys right thing deeply proud you, profoundly disappointed country. pressure people come. states don’t want visitors high COVID areas. 

It’s opposite invitation. It’s essentially saying, don’t come. remember post r/makemesuffer got front page nurse nasal swab covid someone sticking swab far nose stop watching it. probably look YouTube. data this, something I've wondered myself. I'm hoping scientific input many people asymptomatic spreading. 

My opinion believes feel like sufficient protection safe. free compulsory voluntary worker! fantastic job New Jersey dont see us shutting well protests started.... masks carbon filters level protection masks N95 filters? assume I'd like expert chime possible. Yeah say Arizonan could travel state, wear mask, get trouble like Phoenix MAYBE cause looks like police actually enforcing shit dunno....Our governor handled fucking badly GOING pay it...And ACTUALLY think could get WORSE fall cause covid mixed actual flu? oof. I’m sure that’s case. theory might see something similar happened 2008. Regular inflation crazy, we’ll see massive inflation stocks, housing, debt, that’s money went last time that’s it’s going time. we’re seeing short term uncertainty market based rising case numbers. 

There’s limited amount stocks houses much physical, tangible value added every year, yet trillions dollars funneled markets. Corporate bailouts mainly, also tons people spending stimulus check money rent mortgages. 

I think much way physical, tangible goods depend stability US dollar, domestic abroad. reach dollar currency entangled global economy don’t think we’ll ever able see level hyperinflation people imagining, simply much inflate. Like you’d print multiple times amount money worth everything issued valued dollar. least that’s basic rationalization. 

Derivatives assets though, that’s whole different world. They’re tied anything people believe worth much debt people afford go buy them, includes much extra money floating markets direct result cash injection markets receive. rise price, cycle continues. People take debt buy expensive houses, society becomes leveraged debt, next major crisis sends us another downward spiral market works correct concentrated inflation. people making decisions constituents deem important don’t want lose money, pump money in. Rinse repeat. 

Now granted everything I’ve said I’ve learned picked various YouTube videos, someone actually knows they’re talking might sound like crackpot armchair economist, admittedly kind am. I’d love hear someone different theory outcome this. articles I've read say contributing factor, really way verify 🤷‍♂️ 

I found least somewhat surprising

Contact tracing live indicated week's breakouts came party, funeral, restaurant knows he's wellbeing people. He's connected Bill Gates ilk say something. Bill Gates exactly trying put interests society agenda.... Aww, poor girl little sister! hope feeling better soon. I’m FL it’s pretty scary cases rising. 

Also heart goes mama! Hope everyone else stays healthy least symptomatic absolutely is. Part makes alarming died within 5 days other. Also people still Florida acting like normal state cases breaking records slowing would cause concern age groups would think. can't understand accent don’t want you. Good luck getting anyone here. place operates single organism single purpose. Unreal. _""If said geographically restricted leaving, would lockdown,"" Mr Cuomo told CNN Saturday._

Cuomo specifically arguing closing border NY residents war rhetoric came up.

We talking two different things. state mandated quarantine travelers entering high risk areas vs federal movement restrictions wishing leave certain area. true residents TX young learn protect themselves, little common TX personally, hard blame average Joe's people supposed represent directly putting harm's way. someone charge tells something ok, generally believe it. Sometimes resistance say ""no"", affirmative rarely questioned. That's guys viewed criminals abusing trust stunning achievement, close eradication, like New Zealand. big difference Taiwan without lock down. amazing.

I'm sad they've run various fruit / edible stuff show 73 day news conference, honestly looking forward seeing new item would highlighted. encouraging Sweden may need many infections worried would, case strategy suppressing virus testing/tracing neighbors took would much better. latest antibody survey Stockholm showed 7.3% antibodies long way go get 43% across country. Since current death toll 1 2000 Swedes getting without awful lot suffering loss. Depends like potential lung damage, strokes, pneumonia organ damage. long transplants. available coronavirus package.

Of course, dont happen everyone, definite possibility.

You still see friends, like.. see outside. Dont swap beers. Stay safe. years never knew Jim Mattis lisp. wonder first poor motherfucker made fun it. Can't upvote enough!! mean take awhile, virus eventually die fewer fewer hosts every goverment private company world working it. numbers definitely scary think them, reason panic. gotta take one step time can. neighboring cities look like ? perfectly fine handle surge This! doesn’t. That’s part reason economists everywhere expecting giant wave bankruptcies evictions far now. CT checking in. Love this. Quarantining months SUCKED. Wearing masks ideal. it, we're reaping benefits. states come visit put work, then. Master understatement see ;) deSTroy worLd  28 million tests total, 28 times before. Now, we're repeating history every 100 years, mean skipped World War 1? know anymore, lol. give up. :-) People color first lines too! Care cite source? Gotta say, say Sweden's approach failure due amount deaths... definitely large failure regarding early handling nursing homes. Outside this, Sweden done terribly, none hospitals overwhelmed, they're without locking down. say though, really wish would make wearing masks mandatory. easy, highly-effective method stop transmission done. many people would die national economy totally collapsed? Yeah. Way 100,000+ virus. Good thing 4th July activities put strain hospitals already.

How Americans celebrate?

Get drunk play explosives.

Ok, yea, going end well. whole post bad things happen care one another someone asked personal opinion. Autobot makes sense.  lack distancing, poor hygiene poor mask usage also contributing factors sure. martyr people! Hope stay healthy - we'd miss you. Thanks laugh. I’m one sensible states (WA) OK starting epicenter US epidemic. like better way. folks voted “open ‘er back up!” governors FL, AZ, TX, AR, etc. etc. stay are, thank much.

Our governor (Jay Inslee, really hope don’t lose post Biden Administration, good he’d there) put place statewide mask requirement public social distancing isn’t possible, effective Friday. testing US would help prove point, unfortunately, someone top it. [This shit Michigan. People rallied ARs intimidate governor. Fuck short sighted little dick trashpiles.

Well Texas, buy ticket take ride. Even government says take precautions, still take precautions individual. easy find, research. Well thats true. guess many dont common sense. carry sars-cov-2 develop covid-19. kill people go around without mask I’ve saying long time. NEVER vaccine common cold. like pretend close closer SARS it’s bullshit. many receptors much damn evolution receptors. flu has, what? 12 receptor sites (it’s bit since took Med school level class undergrad totally beat ass think I’m remembering right) like jump around brand new one hops (like swine flu). Coronavirus many fucking receptors. Vaccines rely stable receptors. We’re getting coronavirus family. Anyone know DRACO going take not?

I've answering putting mute. tend call back couple Northern California doesn’t Orange County, Huntington Beach, Pacific Beach, Klantee loud mouths bullying officials. far aware. else lots lessons learn.

Narrator: *They learn.* UvA. You? Lol well China 100% padding numbers idk say that. course typically don’t think better China much accomplishment since it’s absolute shit hole. lock down? Porque los dos? both. economic crisis public health crisis. usually smart move EU. Wish could travel soon America royally stupid right now. data worldometer always seems inacurate, though. reported 5528 cases 22nd, reality CA DHHS official count 5,000. compare day case amount worldometer, it’ll differ heavily official CA government puts out. I’m pretty sure it’s divide days 0:00 GMT, 5 pm CA, division days isn’t CA gov divides days. think increase, confirmed CA tomorrow 11, doubt it’ll 6500 want keep big orange Europe. Ill UVA fall well! accuse spreading ""more fear porn"". like people addicted positivity. absolutely cannot imagine world things go badly. avoid costs even every shred evidence pointing contrary. really fucking hard value life money. Way late. States participated protests beginning memorial weekend without precautions already done damage Fuck PRC.  try wedge Holyoke there?! Indianapolis cancelled way back State fair. even saying? None math makes sense it’s 1 100k means 80 8 mill? know breakdown population AZ all? None you’re saying makes sense. I’d cool Tulsi along two mentioned well Yea. hear that. city talking annual fireworks river. work delivery job. Theres many people out. already told two three hospitals max max capacity already since called phase 2 reopening. invest life insurance doom part brain telling me, I'm going catch die soon. people refusing wear masks, social distance anything. Everyone thinks fake, flu, wise immune would die already live normal life. last part actual quote spoken tone changed told one people. Everything going go back way first quarantine happened. doesn't. Well united states probably reach closer 500k million year. significant chunk dead lack hospital space treatments. cases probably lack insurance boot. city currently infected per capita world. play games whole day (after working) comment implies still working, also implying missed work, can't afford miss semi extended period work.

His comment I've work struggling 3 months. pretty clear ""I can't afford miss work.""

I'm glad impacted personally. many. advice simply money set aside future bc kinda important huge stress reliever. Im moving Amsterdam fall (hopefully) grad school well!  someone underwent quarantine BC (I Australia March came home end March), police call show house, check COVID nurse day (tried send funny pictures things inside apartment), BCCDC call ask questions. think also boils ""short-term solution"" mindsets politicians have. care they're going appeal constituents re-election bid secure better future constituents.  dose every week? There's much federal government do. state government supposed call/manage/enforce lockdowns. importantly that, people actually obey it. Bush required every state come pandemic plan states set aside resources. None it. fact many sold dismantled stockpiles.  That's completely useless... Same! at? Well vaccinated like said. makes important wear mask? friends forget don’t think it, don’t understand strongly it. help understand perspective? areas testing huge problem? Enforce it, sir. Stop kissing president's feet job governor. might joking, interstate quarantine system exactly needed stem infections. might late point. probably unconstitutional anyway? priviledge

Check privilege.

WTF order fucking clippers. Yea got calls seven states today. accept call put phone walk away Read Zombie Survival Guide Max Brooks. One recurring theme whole thing boredom. Apocalypse really, really boring. Also, trying go day wear ear plugs tune scratching moaning walkers. tired winning yet? Yeah, would nice data this! actually wanted suggest wearing mask home knew would downvoted radical extreme. extreme situation! vast majority people beginning thought extreme radical wear mask all. willing see situation showing us. would people assuming I’m advocating wearing mask home there’s vaccine. I’m saying, you’re state crazy right now, someone home vulnerable, everyone household lots contact public, maybe consider while. live alone didn’t I’d probably willing wear thin mask home. don’t move around lot home wouldn’t bother much anyway. Pathological. Murderous. Dear God Competitive Microsoft flight simulator got chills dead summer one time, ended pretty obviously quick stomach bug, damn sure terrifying outside hot shaking feeling cold. LA crazy protests work, adhere safety measures. social distancing, avoid physical contact, use sanitizer (buy one company's jerk), wash hands regularly.

and importantly, WEAR FACE MASK ! There’s obvious high percent college graduates colleges, public school system also top notch country. byproduct affluent populace best hospitals doctors world. state also one stronger social safety nets relatively speaking (this one def. argued), combine factors, tend better outcomes lot things rest country, particularly sports teams.  Lol fuck no. Rednecks never travel that’s think America great everyone worships us we’re freest bravest people ever Lol US infinitely better job europestan, beginning still licking China's boot hope privilege firsthand watch loved one drowns fluids. hope get experience anxiety dreading next text phonecall. selfish twat. Ask video lesson haircutting. possibility widespread exposure similar virus providing level cross protection. know likely sure something understand future. deaths last Tuesday much. Probably father's day cause that. hate living America. We're still leaders scientific research innovation. also barred entering country.

Just clear, I'm dramatic. expect see again, already four months hoping would able travel next month, looking less less likely. get one huge fucking spiders catch wallabies webs give hair cut mate.  absolutely needs reported public health officials. Management punished unsafe working conditions. specifics. Reacting something like would involve much Trump. could see OP would assume many ordinary Americans federal state government(s) would respond appropriately. I’m honestly also shocked many governors continue downplay COVID. 

I realize Trump imbecile, it’s incredible see short-sighted many American politicians be. endemic woefully unqualified leaders. haven’t many actual threats past decades, minimum requirements politicians plummeted. bodies pile up, put all? terrifying! covering true death toll? go answers? I've chills times too, strep bouts influenza. would definitely make suspicious. mean basically every country world one those, think like 180-something countries? I’m referring idea behind John Mill’s harm principle freedoms exist doesn’t harm people infringe upon people’s frights. tocilizumab recovery trial get something solid mean, historically speaking USA existed 15 minutes. It’s funny 100% you’re person can’t afford travel anyway probably super uneducated. visit EU customers? Mass talking shit infecting Northern New England bullshit 'oh I'll spend time camp' crap.  seriously, heck national campaign wear damn mask every channel, every radio station??? like back ww2 days. need legit propaganda get people board. tourism business. Also, indefinite mean forever, means defined end. Could month, could 2 years. also requires responsible citizens it’s “impossible” America case, believe he's enabling Trump horrible things? trust science studies showing masks reduce transmission first year I've heavily used mulch omg difference. Weeds far easy manage. think I'll ever use usually boat. Wait. requiring masks one thing, allowing masks fucking absurd. point I'm surprised won’t attitude. come together make difference Everyone Arizona inside like 300 days year -- urban. kinda got addicted lol want best pizza go Italy anyway.... Oh wait. matter. New Zealand problems, they're smaller.

I think Iceland right: testing tracing point ready gets back in. Hey dick,

You know someone says pray me? say 'you got brother!' 

I pray, send well wishes positive vibes. That's hippy shit that's thinking well someone asked it.

Don't fucking douche. miserable experience. Neither gf crave human contact outside ourselves. understand others might, version better part 20 years. Believe me, miserable. personal thing, can't get past this, you.

I think vaccine come soon. Probably early next year. get vaccine, proven vaccine follow. doubt change behavior.

Doctors already much, much better treating COVID-19 less half year ago. Prone positioning. Dexamethasone. hydroxychloroquine. every reason believe doctors getting better treating coronavirus. would think otherwise??!!

I'm super-white pretty old, FWI. think that's relevant, everybody options. 
 behavior...if keep social distancing self-isolation, also drastically reduces chances contracting cold flu.

*ONE* instance avoided sickness worth lifetime isolation, cold, flu, something worse. never cold lasted less 6 months. Every single time I've gotten sick past 20 years horror show, sure coronavirus would kill me. never getting closer 10 feet another human except gf emergency situations.

So no, miserable. yes, healthy American office worker right now. I'm going exercise privilege responsibly possible. Yeah FEMA. Coffin conspiracies popped Katrina FEMA ship lot coffins that. claims bullshit though think corona virus proved since haven’t need plastic coffins. time goes on, maybe everyone start wearing masks social distancing. could along stopped plague. despicable. 

Better despicable ignorant . 
Provaxxers passionate issue large know NOTHING substance regarding it. read nothing done anything approaching personal research parrot talking points ad nauseum. 

Again doctors telling dont know anything vaccine contents 

I remember years ago Piers Morgan CNN tried ridicule discredit ""anti-vaxxers"" took FLU vaccine air. bed ridden two weeks. 

Again youtube Pass. ticket. 3 day park hopper CA parks. Thanks. Houston restaurant walkins reservations already cratering towards lockdown levels. Even without government demanding people stay home. sub reached peak retardation. You’ve become creepy doomsday cult. EU trash they’ll take American wants come. You’ll always little puppy leash. Maybe try kicking bases too. Good luck. New liberal measures caused little spike cases see maybe early allowing people meet large groups again, succefully flattened curve.


Also R kinda dumb stat use cases really low number fluctuates way much based single clusters. Absence makes heart grow fonder. 

Ona serious note. pandemic administration. passed laws largely abandoned years later. clarify capacity due 26% covid ; 64% non-covid patients. advice obvious, execution entirely dependent recipient's circumstances. boils making money spend. example, pretty easy save quite bit that, I'm lucky enough employable field, I'm big spender. that's luck (thanks concern, though). 

I'll quit argumentative, quit giving obvious condescending advice. 

You knew shitty, started suggestion ""I'm really trying shitty you."" give advice needs kind caveat, nobody needs it. Yeah super power keeps fucking things middle east maintaining conflicts. NBA planning play games Florida? Seems many states allowing training camps well. feel like keeps showing people think it’s somehow proves something goes along agenda. We’re talking two people, two data points 140 data points. doesn’t prove anything. 

Even significant number, tested positive doesn’t mean significant viral load time cut clients hair. HIV positive use nothing “antiviral” essential oils, condoms, long sex period cycle low viral count won’t spread virus. doesn’t mean essential oils working. Trudeau shut border 2 months earlier feared called racist. Dr Tam told us masks useless closing borders nothing. response early good. leaders useless. Still better trump though. Fuck Donald Trump fuck supporters creating entire mess. honestly. outer suburbs i’ve barely i’ve barely seen people without masks, everyone anal it. Legitimate question...I feel like people CA acting like everything normal again..I'm talking huge house parties hanging masks distancing. lockdown anymore? one care anymore whatever now? should. Making America shittier Mexico refugee standards would quite accomplishment. Let burn u lockdown like parts US imho first one half assed btw already cost trillion dollars record high unemployment rate. second lockdown would even devastating economy let happen. would rather let people die. Maine still 2 week quarantine requirement anyone coming state except essential workers. governor kept us shut tight taking lot heat it, cases deaths low comparatively.

From understand tourists soon given option getting tested rather quarantine. theblaze.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* yet many people still trying get here, despite corona response. That’s weird. Wonder is? everyone big family parties. 

go snap map check quinceneras shit going trying say? Sweden part EU members states still restrictions Sweden. Netherlands, chance? live long-term residency visa assumed would excluded restrictions Point taken. Looking graphs cases deaths, daily cases 15k-30k range weeks yet daily deaths steady decline back March levels. 

A way explain would testing led cases, positive % decreased would make sense deaths also decreased. multiple regions US positive % 5%, could begin increase deaths coming weeks say

Though would help feel ease countries similar pattern cases staying steady deaths drastically decreasing got upvoted got downvoted...

The absolute state subreddit. wonder international travel recover? months, years? 台湾🇹🇼❤️ I'm actually *technically* essential well (work office medical tech company) got writs would allowed us go office case complete lockdown like Italy's. boss sent us home early like said 'not inclined' us come back necessary. know complaining high level, miss people... also live alone pets, probably MF petri dish place antivaxxers trumplicans refuse wear masks. 

Ugh, sucks, I'm sorry :( I'm Germany (as far tell) people mostly kept wearing masks. I've seen one old woman refused twice, mall police cornered actual police arrived hand fine. 

# go cellar see comment quoted same. You’ve stated thinking... much eloquently lol work live Bay Area? lockdown quite severe colleagues Spain Italy, Germany, Switzerland Canada Exactly. we're pretty selfish nature, Americans. baked culture, much might like admit it. ""Fuck you, got mine,"" kind driving motto behind society. sucks. Actually, get colds summer. get colds years, do, usually August/September instead winter whenever else goes around. month now, cold added mix could cause clusterfuck confusion. comedy. Fuck EU. Arrogant hypocrites fucking stupid thing say. mentally challenged? Although varies year year 40% children vaccinated they're lying again? Strange, can’t imagine R0 60% higher then. pick food field pick store? hope somebody posts video tantrum considering demographics, seems like right approach. family friends retarded 1% death rate ain’t joke 57% Italians died Americans COVID per capita basis telling better response... even taking account true toll coronavirus Italy closer 60k per excess mortality data 100% current 35k estimate. US hand liked undercounted coronavirus deaths 25k per excess mortality data. Overall, figures 99 per 100k Itality vs. 44k per 100k US. 

The major country Europe seems accurate toll coronavirus deaths country Germany. whistleblower doctor stated even cure present itself, still placed order needles inject it. There's reason pharma companies looking making nasal spray. pure incompetence greed throughout. Murphy would pass law... passholder, get refund apply later time want. able get refund pro rated months Disney closed months don’t intend go future I’m sure get refund even ordered tickets pro covid covid

Good luck! Guess buddy won’t visiting wife anytime soon. can't it. Sorry, truth. OP’s post is) 10 weeks? NYC week 15-16 right now.  Jokes them. us don’t want go can’t afford it. Whatever enjoy masses middle easterners instead :) personally one. nice someone high profile questioning corona reaction. need cry hoax. Calm down, buddy. North Korea style? Ohhh~ that’s end game. comes out. whole thing elaborate scheme big pharma make us get flu shot! won’t get Bill Gates!




...




/a That's certainly something considered. However, pandemic give advice based helps people. 

I guess need raise awareness among medical staff people seem ready discharge need checked on, think Covid disease fits category. Literally everyone 1 years old lived something ?

Have ever bothered read writing internet ? says catholic pedophile lol Deaths rose 12 65 one day. rate whose state dead 8 days. Love statistics. America number one look snap map, everyone quinceneras shit still   say so, experience keep six twelve feet away people Walmart. Maybe density component? dunno. I’m sure you’re right. would seem need ""educated"", buddy. like animals? I’m work several months I’ve started fostering cats/kittens local rescue group. Right mama cat 5 kittens keep company they’re old enough adopted. least near me, it’s kitten season they’re desperate fosters. ever campground bathroom? issue much lack availability health issues require care ICU individuals treated COVID-19. hospitals reach capacity sizable percentage taken single disease, mitigation desperately needed, suffering disease, indirectly affect.

One worst things right compare current numbers locations. situation dynamic. NYC hit hard early, hospitals overwhelmed quickly. states unfortunately taking example preparing seemingly inevitable outcome. 4 liters apple cider apple juice works fine too
1 15 oz pumpkin puree
1/2 c. sugar
1/2 c. brown sugar
2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice
2 tsp. vanilla think ScoMo decent job Covid good Jacinta. honestly cant blame would love follow test two three weeks. course since high rate cases right now, there’s way blame testing day. ""Daddy's Boy"" True. need know many children vaccinated. amount children vaccinated less 10% vaccination effect (possibly negative effect). turns vaccination rate US children 40% according CDC. yeah that's consistent claim vaccines save children's lives. well. enjoyed civil discussion. worry, federal government cutting funding COVID testing centers texas shutting bunch federally run ones down. soon # cases go problem solved. /s Go ahead downvote makes uncomfortable dawg. There's plenty emerging science supporting need microscopic bullets. seriously kidding? humanity. Literally everyone 40 lived thru something

Have ever bothered look human history regard pandemics?

Ps: I'm old enough remember smallpox lived country hard hit it. yes, yes live thru something surprise, working brain. Unlike people got us shitting mess pandemic *modes operendi* Even Canada closed frontier. says lot. take distribution account. Open hospital beds Lubbock good major outbreak Houston. forgot rum Oh, defiantly economic crisis, doubt that.


""The Trussell Trust reports soaring 81% increase emergency food parcels food banks network last two weeks March 2020, compared period 2019 – including 122% rise parcels given children...""

This start lockdowns. start. idea what's coming. worried wave front ignoring Tsunami arrive Fall/Winter. Wow it’s control there. That’s awful. trying say Chinese Communist Party fun government live under? bs death stats hover anywhere 20-60 regular day. 

They've strange pneumonia outbreak time covid though. Odd. Gee it’s almost like let virus wants, DOUBLES EVERY DAYS LIKE SCIENTISTS SCREAMING SINCE FEBRUARY FUCKING JAGOFFS. (Not you, OP, people letting shit happen). Exactly. EU's telling keep tourism dollars Coronavirus yourself. Good keep shitty chicken continues? it? anything stop it. It’s 2020; anything possible. DC there's definitely still caution. remember seeing house parties early quarantine that's gone now. 

My friends gone back meeting outdoors eating outdoors risk transmission low enough. Interesting. also says China 75-80% infections happened family clusters. dont agree science best change it. always way getting result agreeable. post COVID-19? takes time cases become outbreak. Can't look cases 5 days event. would first gen spread. Need look 3rd - 4th, 30-40 days later. Hard work! I'm American agree response. fucking up. feel lucky I'm California least taking seriously. know, I’m talking exposing volunteers virus. Can’t expose virus lab something instead wait several weeks get results? living fear COVID probably initially base opinion science rationality, anything but. self-reinforcing, panic-driven hysteria. Many folks sub need medication, COVID- instead, anxiety paranoia bordering delusion.

The problem delusional people go great lengths bolster narrative. Even means spouting fake news accuse others peddling. reinstating requirement look job stay unemployment. governor forcing people go out. He's saving economy. He's priming crash. Ya hear you. nice. Broken undersized exhaust fans, open stall partitions top bottom, 30 inches apart. Can't wait get back normal life! (Forget I'm going squatting broom closets parking lots). Individualism means people put needs community. mean different things look differently go different stores. never issue another stay home matter bad gets. even mandate masks. 3 reasons:

1. Texas income tax. got bill unemployment, decided everything open good luck.

2. cult members think shut downs masks infringe personal freedoms. 

3. He'd admit wrong. that. He's smuggest douchiest personification arrogance entitlement I've ever seen anyone life besides DJT. tell people masks work invade freedom it. could go wrong? may good cause, virus sadly care. masturbating vigorously think it’s based income housing costs. Since student, income likely shit all, eligible.

Same health insurance. Mine like €110 month, government would refund €80.

Oh also get personal OV chip card, it’s way cheaper way believe.

Have fun man, it’s super nice place live. governments werent upset ban pissed because... sick word social distancing. Fuck it. love EU this. I'm hiding Tahoe, never come here! will! I'm aware. Abbott's plan strong worded messages denying severity problem. talking Tim tracker? see man 😎 Us theme park nerds gotta band together apply people traveling EU US citizens, people trying enter EU traveling US? weeks they’ll take look suspicious deaths occurred today add total. It’s sad what’s happening Mexico. Quit cuck. even able find job EU. unemployment rate many countries high. know why? countries EU shit economies. don’t know. What? Meanwhile, people couldn’t buy toilet paper two months. Yeah bro. Rocksolid. There’s also meat shortage going right Mr. America. lol Guess don’t get Fulbright Scholar Ya, cause probably never getting past first :( super helpful! Thank information. get data from? novice searches led state dashboard people received citizenship yet. hundreds thousands people working, studying taking asylum abroad visas. travel restrictions hurt them. Well dont like reality ... change narrative keep repeating it. usually works while. banned travel China less outbreak   Well going re-enact Commune, well, maybe best :p

Just kidding, hope manage get eventually ! And? America paying ~100% pretty much anybody making $46.8k less (since state contribution federal contribution, varies state. federal government paying equivalent $31,200/year. average state payout equivalent $15,600 year, Massachusetts high equivalent $41,340). There’s one time $1200’payoit top everybody. 

That’s actually creating problem people wanting return since U.S. generous. Massachusetts, people getting equivalent almost $73k year work.

So, again, people better financial compensation Americans right now. fiancé’s family Italy hit hard. sending money support government isn’t. Cliches aren’t rebuttals. would suggest walking away phone computer while, find hobby. world's going end tomorrow, think probably need decompress bit. Please take negatively mean malicious, struggle sometimes helps me, free legal.  threw mandarin bin want eat teacher saw bin demanded know threw people could go lunch. admit eventually eventually someone else teacher knew really them. Since railing policy applying permanent residents applies citizens well, please indicate distinction relevant point? far seeing crossed paths someone infected, give suggestion quarantine certain circumstances? Holy hell, going absolute shit show 2-3 weeks. *Laughs Florida*

😢 seventh case far. really aren't, many American tourists come anyways Europe human life value happy esetially kill people US money Haters hating. Seattle issues, better 95% country. Lol @ voting According sources, 9% people die get virus, although today it’s probably something like 5% since better treatment. That’s need know make sense situation dude. I’m beginning wonder opioid crisis fried people’s minds much incapable complex thought processes. people ton free time access social media. maybe way think infected others around them. 

If combine meth crisis opioid crisis, 30 years widespread, intergenerational drug abuse rural America. T*)ump comes along see someone talks thinks way do, say, “that’s guy.” Actually also blaming wrong people. Look timeline, knowing 11.4±3 day delay events reported infection showed change points spreading rate affect confirmed case numbers delay two weeks (**median reporting delay D=11.4 days** plus median change-point duration 3 **May 18**, Florida's 67 counties Full Phase 1 reopening. state entered first phase limited reopening **May 4**. Palm Beach County entered Phase 1 May 11. Miami-Dade Broward counties approved enter Phase 1 May 18.

Also Memorial Day Weekend (which often blamed) ended **May 25**

But largest spike cases actually *seven day moving average* number new COVID-19 cases increased **1269** **June 11** **2408** **June 18**, 2020

So means *most significant* cause must occurred earlier May 28 (factoring standard deviation)

What started suddenly May 28? God playing Great Depression 2.0, downloaded Climate Change Dust Bowl DLC.

Edit: 2020 helluva lesson history repeating refuse learn it. read somewhere forum travel US Europe purpose starting continuing job still allowed. probably need quarantine 14 days arrival. lol guess I'll keep tourism dollars then. love it. like EU actually enjoys stagnant economy. America. Bigger bullets=more dead(er) virus(es). European countries directly paying furloughed workers ~80% salary. Well that’s strange. 

I fortunate enough get student housing university, government offer rent subsidy top that? New executive order: 

The ICU rich people, young women (if least 7/10), athletes compete state level better (except soccer players), doctors, lawyers, engineers, geologists, anyone oil industry, pastors church least 500 members.

Oh, whites only, case clear.  reason hold Fauci standard. thought maybe *your own* words could get apparently not. miss Ibiza, first time four years going that's problem radical left : easy call someone racist ignorance difficult apologize afterwards... sacrifices willing make take Hajj amazing. I'm sorry shattered dreams, applaud made tough choice. hope everyone gets second chance next year. nobody enforce shit. police shit, people give shit police. Younger people getting sick, requiring hospitalization older people got beginning. could see hospitalizations maybe case count increasing.

This virus takes long time beginning end, burst positive cases end June, depending severity cases see deaths possibly another three weeks average. getting better treating covid-19 keeping people alive, need keep hospital capacity low possible, soon hospitals get overloaded quality care gone deaths pile up. Bald folks tend higher testosterone usual. fact, opposite - almost always significantly less testosterone. excess, though, DHT, susceptibility towards follicular shrinkage caused DHT. last link combined first link.

That dashboard lags 3 7 days. see 55% thanks pointing out. 

Honestly, know bugging much effect acted caution care whole pandemic is. Grrrr. America absolutely nuts right now. Well... church cluster didn’t happen read comment got ""the economy important""? would shocked stupidity reading rest comment makes sense  I’m weird place restaurant management job. slated reopen mid July going on, knows. I’m hoping don’t don’t really another option. don’t go back, lose Unemployment. go back, put wife 6 month old baby risk. daily news next many months .... numbers go up.

Previously driven outbreaks several locations, spread global.  Mid February! cough would go away! That's exactly called it! takes month typically kill you, current surge cases reflected deaths  protects others, yourself.

it protects wearer too, idea debunked - thank CDC spreading lies one included. I'm ok profit case. realize able test trial fast want profit, right? 27 December 2019 20 January 2020? that’s point making. Thanks verifying it. We'll testing [Antigen Detection method]( . Hopefully increase testing rate considerably. wrong, density measured many ways. look population density per square mile, LA compare city like NYC. take away vertical element start look density single family homes general metro area density may number one. majority people died U.K. pre existing condition, ""dying"" it. people would lived catch covid.

Also dodged point people died U.K. past several months time recently memory, double time lockdown. need focused getting many people back work quickly possible probably restarting WPA .

How think WPA funded?  well enjoy locking back now


muhahahahahahahaa


seriously tho w r fucked sorry hear heart goes you. hope gets treatment needs interim period, doubly things happen way fall (re: shut down/ cancelled). work pediatrics I'm entirely sure happened department within hospital system, I'm assuming pretty similar, peds generalists adult cases make clinical day quota. could done anesthesia MRI myself, would loved to. I'm sorry. Wishing best daughter family. many 65% plan take seriously seriously March? point least states second shutdown, guarantee unless marital law, tons pool parties people’s houses, people going parks beach, people apathetic since it’s summer. I’d also expect lots small businesses resist closing first shutdown. even going second stimulus rent delays well? prediction one goes even worse compliance-wise. got tested Monday Seattle results within 16 hours (results checked next morning). proactively without symptoms, can't imagine waiting week sick unsure covid. insane that's still lag time places. Write recognized research paper published renowned scientific journal then. commenting Reddit? way believe know wtf you’re taking about. mAkE uS LoOk bAd! W/ crazy amount cases we're getting now, we're going find soon enough whether that's case. I'm doomy person country far selfish anything prevent hope true. Maybe they’ll willing run Texas￼ apartment complex already half empty people moved couldn’t pay rent.

Unemployment low wages real problem stories aftereffects/long term complications. Covid19positive sub enough horror material. Buying one visit enough last two month drought going break supply chain. Especially freaking begins. I’ve read guidelines saying stay distanced outside. I’ve also seen studies convincing arguments outdoor transmission extremely unlikely impossible don’t think people pointing weight cruel,

Unfortunately young people harmed obesity too, illness strikes vulnerable complications occur obese adults battling illness. say “no prior conditions complications”, ignoring systemic complication body obesity, disservice young people need guidance support culture increasingly obese prone illness frankly taking seriously toll next generation. know 600$ specifically unemployment benefits usually taxable well ""This country full selfish fucks""

""I want normal life back"" Gotta win Darwin Prize! problem COVID isn’t specific death rate, it’s many people get infected it’s likely cause complications respiratory viruses. things remain true despite advances treatment.

In short, virus isn’t threat me, it’s threat “we”. fact I’d get mild case infected isn’t super comforting light that. Reopen harder start burying bad news Sure, OK. credentials Reddit statistician clearly trump doctors. 

Well drifted pretty far started article question let drift away. issue one willing sacrifice.
Don't want shutdown.
Don't want lockdown.
Don't want quarantine.
Don't want wear mask.
Don't want social distance.
Don't want tracked. Yeah, know. serious concern. needs legally mandated point. best Red Foreman voice, ""Dumbasses"". Followed best Kitty laugh. Case much winning. Well, bet rest world going isolate away US true, since wave 1.5 already way, wave 2 going hit September. imagine ignoring precautions took Sweden. People exactly keen following guidelines. imagine one people. yeah, like said - people going die. Good luck. indisputably advanced

Is it? Indisputably? I'll dispute it. country can't afford get sick hurt. Even insurance.

66.5% personal bankruptcies US due medical issues.

By way, fancy education technology flaunting mean shit average person access it.

If got bunch super specialized care that's leading field, cutting edge, outside reach population, that's advanced, that's backwards. No, mean old white guys trying storm vons something yelling workers trying enforce state mask order old white guys start hissy fit dropping n words.


Rather wear damn mask. lol man federal reserve literally printed 4 trillion year buy junk bonds ETFs, nobody cares debt Yeah, many people dealt pandemic serious? small amount people 102 older, even fewer old enough actually remember Spanish Flu. think currently politicians. 

No one knew do. politicians rolled changed tactics situation changed, put head sand, actually lied tried earn political points $$$. None everything perfectly, pretty clear trying wasn't. hear good stuff Canada. downsides living there? Cool, let know join parallel version 2020 doesn’t suck fucking bad. I’d gladly leave version.  guarantee non-Chinese organizations conduct tests product well. God hope so. area? Dude please miss brother's wedding due fear virus probably get almost definitely fine. [Bing hit wall testing week 7 day trailing average positivity rate topping 40 percent. likely due half staff national testing lab sick COVID. first lab Usac online today processing 100 tests every 4 hours. solution crisis step. live near Pearland. know exactly mean. They're stopping city way beach. area trying, many cases, Houston opened back they've brought here. United States? Jesus, corona thing really came blue! even prepare something like this?!

Oh wait... Remember time dennis rodman went vegas middle NBA finals get back days later? Idk one specifically, fauci says he’s optimistic we’ll vaccine end 2020 Pretty much every doctor planet said don’t know long immunity last.  people wore masks “freedom” rally weren’t advocating highly infectious virus keep highly infecting people us would ok still cautious like BLM protests. Florida big, big state. Depends FL obviously. keeping distance wants spend time family may remaining years, say let pleases, that's two cents Maybe there's something protective pasty white norlander scandinavian DNA. point people like take shit serious? mean, probably went 'its flu' phase. people saw real danger faster others, get that. freaking 6 months in, deaths freaking wars, half globe shut down, biggest depression since 100 years. many clues need take serious? feel entire virus fake know anyone personally effect this

A lot people think way, convinced it.

A lot people also shortly going change minds. Scrolling quickly thru New.... AZ, MS, AL close records also Please hoarde.   people soulless consuming machines care get others sick.

I'd say we're seeing fair share demographic well. lol @ desperate attempt regain control narrative think echo chambers. Everyone know thinks quarantine ""big government intrusion"" people wear masks afraid. plan going shop like used tend small business owners, retirees pensions, etc. comprehend majority Americans either unemployed, strapped cash, rightly worried spreading virus. people probably outside social circle, see it. blame ""libruls"" weak afraid buy shower installation business whatever. positive thing, too-often causes individuals reject information flies optimism, leading bad outcomes. Examples: ""I never get sick, I'm wearing mask"" ""I worry getting affairs order - oncologist probably wrong""

We cognitive biases one kind another (me included). \*not\* easy challenge biases, vigilant times help, time hurt - ourselves, others. might agree DEATH looks less likely first learned virus, I'm actually cautious \*not\* want one people sick 40, 80, 90 days end sight. scares even more. think media really shine spotlight people realize ON/OFF switch. Numbers sure go soon ... feds close testing sites. sure lot talk people saying months ago got ""again""

No isn’t. debt? going work strategy, 2nd 3rd wave hit economic disaster hands then? Don’t forget giant delays; people struggling get unemployment. 

America proper social net. actively try dismantle every years. Also responsibility motorcycles! get confused people say things like “it’s going away own.” someone please explain wearing mask magically make Covid disappear. Even vaccine, it’s going anywhere. 

B4 y’all attack me, wear mask. ""I skimmed article gave information treatments working patients fairing head medical system treating them"" another lockdown pro money keep people home. It’s rural areas states getting infections. state TN .5% infection rate. Ny 2%. hot spots less population still plenty dense. We’ve got 100k people catch NY percentage basis guys holier thou BS closing boarders? Lol. miracle god seems likely point. That’s saying something. Mmm gimme good shit. Spank harder title misleading. sample random population sample, people electing get tested.

From article:

Karin Tegmark Wisell, Head Department Public Health Authority, believes figures line expected. difficult draw conclusions antibody situation Stockholm rest country based KI's new figures.

""This people voluntarily applied sampling test themselves,"" says.

&amp;#x200B;

People self selecting heavily sample people symptoms want check covid, i.e. it'll heavily sample people infections. People really toss wad sports country. Maybe we'll learn every team every sport existence. Riveting. literally things right (except snowboard guess). According people sub probably won’t future anyways might well go stuff 🤷🏻‍♂️ Goddamnit want run office.  If? Florida death #s seem good true case count.  Even ignoring logistics this, think huge, number repayment way low. would 50-60k make sense. 100k+ represents 16% normal times knows many people fall year. That's even 125k mentioned. honestly think youd half it. I’m trying imply anyone science background read comprehend fields work, implying least people science background understand scientific process know initial findings ever concrete. everyone arguing whether absolutely good thing, science people know it’s probably good thing, jury still far decided. 

The average person sees results can’t digest science context easily someone operates scientific space; even space less relevant

You raise good points however love spew numbers mean anything. fairly simple concept... wear mask I'm scientist Phd. But, sure, go get dopanime leves seeking comment replies approve herd mentality message ""we're gonna die"" etc. That's reddit for. Lots infectious people never get symptoms. Two weeks nowhere near enough. Get well soon. Oxford combined phase 2 3 trial. passed phase 2 yet bombing ourself count? president wants start nuclear testing again.

I'm kidding. completely wrong, know. ""scientists"" limited understanding model used. know implemented it. ""Their"" numerical model outdated version code available Github ""ECheynet/SEIR"". simply ""forgot"" mention it. think amount fear mongering media making people dramatic. still even upped testing appropriate amount, know, us could already mortality rate lower flu. paranoid quarantined march last week, knowing ton people gotten shaken couple days I'm it. boyfriend tested 1 1/2 weeks ago contact someone tested positive. Still hasnt heard back. What's point rate? trying make one AIDS like 36 years though. say covid aids. said they've trying 36 years vaccine never came. happen. since covid novel, cannot really say pose problems regard. Back 80s promised fast tracked vaccine ready two years, never came. 2020 promised fast tracked vaccine ready year. Guess we'll wait see one plays out. Better late never. polarization science common sense super sad. make sense takes time.. sure want this? Add @lealvukic Yes afford it, federal government would rather risk lives look data long term effects virus, shit isn’t bad flu. Sure odds favor you’ll get sick long terms effects, dice roll wrong might end permanent lung damage, circulation issues clots lead amputation, heart attacks / strokes, seems long term shitty state health.

FYI data yet. virus still young see whole picture happens large scale 12 weeks recovery. know 6 weeks seem full recovery something 20-30% serious health effects. prediction means permanent damage longer recovery time.

I'm saying wrong worry ""just look data"" really proof here. I'm guessing ride car often despite death rate 12 per 100k. death rate COVID NYC 18-44 years old 21 per 100k. control risk factors even less. lead videos stupid people refusing wear masks yelling racist stuff. 

You mean liberal protests without masks see flying spittle video? racists? 

Stupidity know politics. course doesnt look good. Two three graphs fucking cumulative. can’t discern change day day. 

Garbage charts Seems like spread much outdoors. protests issue, sure seems localised states. Best believe it. CCP purposely concealed outbreak allowed shipped around world air travel. Marines, service members met worked around Mattis great deal respect man regardless branch. h pleasure meeting legend twice, stationed east coast deployed near Philippines. Seriously, Mad Dog 2020!!! one found yesterday ya go. Also 5 kids UK died corona total. GTF outta boy Booster shots? already exist many diseases, would impossible COVID? Florida, Texas California, saw best days foreseeable future

Another way phrase God wish Kiwi. Especially now. get whole “my body, choice” concept. comes wearing mask, I’d like choice getting asshole’s virus shed me. suck put fucking mask. that's unambiguously unconstitutional Phil Murphy said much statement Protests certainly carry 100% blame, likely significant contributing factor.  Potentially integrated annual flu vaccine additional annual vaccine. Certainly ideal, better nothing? Sounds like fun. florida man Absolutely ridiculous Right!? also daycare outbreak Texas think 22 kids adults infected. 4 months lead time China many countries left much figure out? Stay home, stay away others, wash hands wear mask isn’t exactly rocket science. news great job showing idiots beach bar us trying best catch thing. 

From data could also interpret X% individual states residents likely die Covid. 47 states significantly better beginning did. You’ve killed Covid patients already. protests Cali coincide reopening state, can’t attribute uptick protests alone. 

Should noted NY saw massive protests reopening experiencing uptick would issue mutations, virus recently making leap humans opportunity do.

The risk may slim evades immune response easily, another reason cautious approach slow spread vaccine, rather allowing spread maximum speed healthcare system afford, carries risks own. First **human** coronavirus. is, example, vaccine canine coronavirus. Interesting know that. joking cynically. Threats mine honey buns Fuck lol  like mom says so-and-so can't come anymore mom lets whatever want. well, never kamikaze president thing happening Beshear KY. People HIGHLY upset decided gun stores essential. Someone even burned effigy state Capitol.

They mad general lockdown, course got special kind 2A nutjobs screaming scam get rid guns across country forcibly locked homes. yet numbers rise they’ll find someone else blame. Where’s money coming from?

Taxes? Oh wait... definitely taxes They’re acknowledging racist whites dangerous black people coronavirus is. Honesty good, guess, would better stop racist. Wtf?

I'm equality, shits sake

Hoping joke best data, presentation bit dense though. ...yeah, still extremely bad idea. Infringing individual patient rights media usage? COVID? media already huge issue country want people LESS privacy? potentially lethal disease? basically still dispute. lot outrage states cases keep rising like mad continue nothing lie say everything fine. LA county also fucking huge population-wise, wonder case numbers adjusted pop. compared states. crazy though. half truck driver drives NY Maine asked hotel travel papers. employer heard thing tried tell stay hotel. went another hotel problems. definitely enforced.  going hard time convincing administration bailout democratic states. nothing shit got stop. Yea think farm animal ones too. It’s fucked up. federal government literally holding health hostage airlines companies continue make profit. noticed provinces best tend rural major cities like Montreal still plenty cases.

Canada nothing close city size density New York/Newark, can’t really compare Canada’s success without removing outlier. do, deaths per capita really quite close, sure much pay back about.

I don’t know people Europe saying that. Like say talk Denmark every day, ahead us re-opening whole time still are. restaurants open full capacity mask, half, masks required eating. Offices same. 50 percent 6 ft distancing required, 100 percent 3 feet.

Florida criticized holding spring break opening beaches “too early” fewer deaths per capita Denmark, (same population density) time lauded model. saw spike higher Denmark hit hot season started spending time indoors. point is, info presented political spin it. criticized even numbers lower places getting worse results.

Throughout US’s gradual re-opening started ease around mid April onward, deaths per day trending down, still are. sure continue south moving indoor season, time tell. saying higher number new cases younger people, death rates go exponentially younger cohort, gotten clinically better, possible deaths continue fall despite rise cases, time tell. Time also tell Canada sees spike indoor season starts again. point can. one suggested hysterics. many kids die stops inconvenience. I'm saying stay home basement. I'm driving moral responsibility accept preventable deaths. someone life child become I'll die. rare occurrence everyone else basically fine. 

So think kids fine go send write Dr. Fauci herd kids back crowded room again. also obese people nation. 
That’s one big comorbidities Corona.  
Even recover, obese patients taking beds hospital loooong time. dad lives Florida. took two weeks using computer system gave filled paper application. got laid first week March. got first check last week still received COVID check fed. pay that. system never designed simply print money revenue coming in. I'm Texas - state numbskull, leadership (and 20% people listen leadership decide perfect day pack shoulder-to-shoulder bar)  What? government media saying saying months already know? Let happen. can’t force people learn change views, themselves. months inform Covid ravaged rest country, learn hard way now. gonna lie, huge General Mattis fan definitely making enthusiastic wearing mask. Hopefully ad impact many people respect admire him. It’s . Stop fear mongering Unfortunately, BS rampant dodgy websites social media, bound result people believing nonsense. actually lean heavily side freedom moral decisions. Freedom I'm free person, living life, natural right determine life course actions even affect quality life. soon somebody take freedom provide higher quality life, power determine means you. 

Even libertar.ian am, pandemic different game. take somebody else's freedom idiot. even like drugs weapons ownership hurt anybody usage punished. actively walking around causing death great bodily harm people right breathing. 

One freedom freedom harm people. I'm highly suspicious government overreach, I'm incredibly upset peoples' ignorance this. Surely protecting people pandemic justified function government. 

Plus, people tend think freedom means whatever want even peoples' property. refuse recognize freedom individual company establish rules entrance conduct property. see claim we’ve never developed vaccine coronavirus brought lot, vaccine domestic cats FIP virus, coronavirus. we’ve done coronavirus could infect humans. stupid comment lol. Sorry states trying contain virus majority people get virus survive, that's good anology.  government needs support citizens another lockdown occur. obvious federal govt intention such, reopen East lansing Michigan 22 confirmed cases local bars. there’s huge spike well. Viruses spontaneously manifest, need brought in, need transmitted people infected.

That's lot easier happen area high rates travel area, areas dense public transit...like NYC Boston.

The fact locked hard beginning *precisely why* flyover states get hit hard early months. infected cut clean. stuff coming back open people getting lax, starting spread around more.

It's especially evident places *aren't* honoring social distancing mask wearing. suburb halfway Boston Providence, allowed store without mask unless got damn good reason. take precautions seriously hit disproportionaly hard *surprise surprise*, we've got lowest R0 country. level PTSD healthcare workers facing going astronomical.

This isn’t going day two forcing civilian healthcare workers making many impactful decisions, WEEKS making heartbreaking decisions days nights end.

It’s healthcare either. It’s emergency dispatchers, first responders, morticians, family members suffering. Federal Reserve FIAT currency, trillion every year military protect us, find way. think doctors nurses going get fed won’t particularly care keep job  Sure, reasonably expect least couple years immunity provided virus mutate, new virus placed billion people petri dish *might*. make sound like NYC new WHO/China telling rest world bad could get sit asses…waitaminute…  guess work:

1. members get vaccine free, perk membership.
2. Poor nonmembers get free, poor.
3. Rich former members, quit huff, pay full retail price. cat bag. Can't stop now. People longer give fuck. Agreed both. Sorry playing fast loose word fact, 97 3 supermajority scientists agree topic sides rhetoric jumps ""well theory, experts sides"", think stronger syntax needed. get cut ways, unsure perfect middle ground much electorate elected grasp scientific process. Sounds like it’s time go post history respond big ol’ “told so”! thought joking think important note spikes South only. person Northeast, extremely concerned spikes area. fact, state seeing glorious decreases across board near 100% compliance masks. Mass excellent job well. really need personality TV tell common sense do? Sad! Ah shit :( get Better Ogloos Gardens here.
Sooooorry. Trump's demographic probably at-risk group loses many winks sleep people criticize him, exceptionally defensive person Concerning part % positive tests going up. Idiots thought opening would save economy instead spreading disease making worse. Hmm believe? lonely guy Reddit official website.... tough decision irony like units going fill right up. Massive unemployment. people employed largely saying ""Boy, seems like good time find new apartment."" lots places sit vacant. 

Then, course, we'll see surge foreclosures pretty soon banks sweet multi-family units. Plus ones end selling loss, course. 

Or could better relief passed people could sheltered place without crippling fear unable eat. Good thing opportunity change current administration later year. Honestly think would perfect next person hold office. America people freak economy crashes, rest world people freak lot people die. 

You intervene help economy better trying control spreading virus. 

The point prolonged pain, economy never recovered crash further. America y’all saw pictures people bars Ohio reopened, packed like sardines: area Hamilton Co one discussed social media cases hiding them.  think difference travel big, since Spanish flu hit right around biggest mass long-distance short-time travel history, WWI. spread like wildfire conditions. I’m suggesting abolishing HIPAA, I’m suggesting making COVID related exceptions. Mattis may highly regarded military leader we've long time, least veterans. guys care much?

I can't seem stop caring people dying needlessly. That's nice, think funds government? There's also guarantee people still job go back to. wat. Bitching people offering solutions offer fucking riddle? relate normal levels? I'm quite certain major city going pretty full ICU time, covid blacks violent therefore get violent altercations police

Why anyone care say spouting racist nonsense like this? It’s like you’re NPC basically every bad stereotype Americans:
 - overtly racist
- ignorant COVID
- Spends hours online defending daddy Trump **ABSTRACT** 
The contamination patients’ surroundings severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains understudied. sampled surroundings air six negative-pressure non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) rooms designated isolation ward Chengdu, China, occupied 13 laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients returned overseas travel, including 2 asymptomatic patients. total 44 112 (39.3%) surface samples positive SARS-CoV-2 detected real-time PCR, suggesting extensive contamination, although air samples negative. particular, single room occupied asymptomatic patient, four sites SARS-CoV-2 positive, highlighting asymptomatic COVID-19 patients contaminate surroundings impose risks others close contact.

Environment cleaning emphasized negative-pressure rooms. findings may useful guide infection control practice protect health care workers. still seeing 100% indoor mask compliance part Maryland, occurring last 3 months....and Trump country county. Fingers crossed enough. hospital rather several large well-respected hospitals plus things. mom used work there. neat place. feel bad Texas take look Arkansas. Texas comin hot I'm AZ see dipshits everywhere masks. agree comment %100 although would added many cuss words, cuz people pieces shit. Refrigerated trucks. Surgery pancreatic cancer considered elective surgery. Anything immediate risk deaths matter hours considered elective surgery. Please learn meaning terms spout crap internet. lol hahahaha Wow actually say that? surprised did, known making cuff remarks sometimes unpopular opinions, kind statement shows seriously misinformed dire is.

And please, one come back ""he making joke"" argument. Tons people listen him, unreasonable someone would take completely seriously use words way vindicate taking precautionary measures avoid virus, thus endangering others. you. Realistically, think repeatedly over-stating risks tap dancing grave every 20 likely create push back compliance. think lying people risk order engineer behavior fundamentally unhealthy. 

I wish 20 somethings would appreciate difference 0.02% 0.00%, disease vector regardless personal risk terrifically ideal thing value functioning society, I'm sure moral imperative try trick them, celebrate deaths. Quite opposite, really.

And let's honest...no one coming threads ""celebrate"" name education. They're feel satisfied. They've developed Cassandra Complex course pandemic they're secret little thrills scofflaws spring breakers might get due.  wear seatbelt every time enter store acquaintance thinks masks actually weakening people's immune systems increasing chance people catching Covid.

Dumb people dumb. Ah, right. god put humans earth them, mountain cash absolutely used whose value cannot change. We, humans, absolutely could find another way exchanging / making items use cash trade *must* essential worth risking peoples lives for, right?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still waiting show said could print endless cash, forget one? worries, friendly reminder. pray cash, think? Like I've done things right, I'm selfish piece shit risks others lives, think god grow money tree? 

&amp;#x200B;

You're totally right, need continue get money pay government continue fund virus research. Great job, friend. single handedly solved USAs worlds problems. I'll call press. happened once. dance floor standing right table putting jacket on. Anyone surprised?  think difference teams may elect shut whole teams couple guys get it. mention guys behind scenes (trainers, coaches, etc.). see healthy players even whole teams quick sit couple cases pop roster. Bold assume Trump would respect advice experts enough stop holding mini rallies.  Autism. Next question please. It’s bit early say whether deliberately lying. Inside nostril, circular motion. say around trying say circular motion inside nostril swab didn’t go anywhere finger couldn’t. People get it. Landlords need pay bills too. funny enough, many tenants paying rent able to. (fully employed getting unemployment regular work) Baltimore relaxing property tax one bit landlords impacted. Property tax much 1/3 tenants rent Baltimore. people without income, need helped. everyone taking advantage situation needs put national blacklist renters well. seriously can't figure ignorance arrogance. likely combination two. sure that? Havent following optics last (?) years? Kids thing fake news networks focus on. School shootings, thugger gang activities, illegal alien youth detensions, sex trade, smoking, vaping, pronoun gender acceptance schools. Shit, given time could fill page MSM propoganda directly focused youth sole purpose get ""tear jerk"" reaction public. shit happens adults, public simply thinks ""Meh, wrong place be"" "" deserved that"", throw kids saaaaaad story going get public reaction America. Fake news networks focus that, predict soon next ""fake news breaking story"" going illegal alien kids. Either detension centers much ""suffer"" journey here. Trust me, gonna happen. plenty beds available./s don’t go icu sniffles folks I'm currently renting house absolutely right. I'd could play nice work tenant trying evict started coming short.  NJ one best requiring masks. You’re shamed don’t wear one indoor place. Like three posts hot page article stating accelerate transmission virus. take pick. That's trend this. Contradictory statements sides. wish someone knew something. Idk US India someone coming state gets stamp hand (ink lasts long long time) officials check you. 

In one state money used incentive. got narcolepsy [from People don’t understand affect immune systems. two data points guess 3rd point, yes. complicated that, though. (1) Data expressing natural events likely follow curves perfect straight lines. (2) Elective surgeries still going on, full data every one 90% 97% people COVID-19 cases. also know ratio shifted all-causes-ICU COVID19-caused-ICU, could worse, too. Oh man Florida screwed leave mine hanging car days heat think that’d enough? That’s I’ve didn’t know supposed wash them... thing 625 thread count sheets two layers silk chamois (per U Chicago Study). use particular mask design, found another works husband surgical tape (I prominent nose).

Really curious mask makers done fabric stacking 600tc cotton/silk cotton/flannel even cotton/poly like study suggests, able get close parts exceed N95 masks.  Postponed, canceled hope great, advantage moving around lot, indoor dining risky people tend sitting together hour talking lot. close infectious customers minutes time, think relatively unlikely result infections. Take look  nice illustrations restaurant infection cases study, note none servers got sick. 

Also, clothing exposed skin probably huge risk, currently believe infection happen people inhale viral droplets directly, evidence surface-borne transmission limited. grandpa pilot canal, rescue submarine fight wanted bomb brits anymore. better talk grandpa. Lucky never seen russia.

Yeah small villages History real (you get touch history, nearer)

I family Chronic hands. thing amazing. Nevermind, today make history. Hope works better. know read comment. Yeah would valuable info have.

Hasn't case southern half state rebelling shutdown, going lot refusing wear masks? least impression getting news. seem like that's area lot cases coming from, even though protests happening everywhere.

Like yesterday LA 2320 new cases, SF 34, even though they've lots heavy protests. think graph upside opened economy booming....oh wait there's still pandemic going on. Fuck spreading misinformation I'm resting comfortably iron lung machine needed haircuts. animals equal, animals equal others. Well point live pretty much next door around here. still spend fucktons Jeez.. stop accepting sick problem solved.. /s. Well seeing chimed original comment, would probably help go back read? I’m Rogan fan COME FUCK MAN! Questionable fuck debate wearing masks. doesn’t realize made political himself. went 0 active cases province day. weird feeling pretty much safe kinda back normal watching things go completely opposite direction elsewhere. coming visit stay blows over?  still first wave. mean last peak wasn't. low 1000s new cases day. we're hitting 5000 1500 Houston alone. imagine karens complaining Shhh, disrupt Reddit circlejerk... appreciate saying this. simply can't compare country like US, threatened homefront since civil war, \~150 years, size continent, abundant natural resources, river network east easily one best world, small European nation Nazi rule 6 years Soviet occupation 45 years like Poland example.

&amp;#x200B;

Excuses excuses. Fact US economy almost large entire EU combined, mention fact household name companies originalte US. single household-name company emerged EU since founding. fault countries small fuck surrounded oceans two sides loooool. Texas, hold beer... within feet someone it..... 

Have read anything past three months? hate response governer, already admitted level cases unacceptable yet instead actual lockdown says last resort. people stupid selfish right fucking thing wear masks correctly results. Gov abbott's response tell RECOMMEND social distancing wear masks, wash hands shit. public cannot trusted handle situation need authoritarian response government right actual shutdown, rent freeze, UBI vaccine. trying get in? Vendors resident’s family members? get numbers directly trump, right?
How healthcare? Don‘t get sick, couldn‘t pay it! 
46mil unemployed, thats almost half germany. 
Your economy? Crushed covid19 since pres able stop it, get worse. 
Please look try mock countries country far worse situation. Yeah made noise beginning, heard much NC GA recently, even though know NC spiking like crazy. seems like GA stable 1k new/day, far good, 5k+ places seeing right now. would use anyone point order justify want anyway. stupid part herd immunity we’re constantly developing better treatments vaccine may distant future would dumb front-load bunch deaths. testing ever became instant, at-home, abundant, could probably eliminate way. 

Also don’t know long term effects are. I’m going avoid getting now. people claim sub full doom gloom negative articles upvoted, readily upvoted one myself. (I think posted multiple sources.) legit good news. game-changer, modeling, still good news. Statistically gun violence kills kids covid-19. least today.  importantly Florida doesn’t governor enforcing mask wearing social distancing best ability happens reaches 100?
People shipped different state? I'd like point *this* appropriate use caps. work retail, week store closed staff afraid angry. mall store open, grocery store, pharmacy one two others. People still kept coming like nothing happening, one guy came coughed us saying crazy falling this. 
  mall opened monday, arrows directing traffic, extra security guards directing people, etc. even half people following less wearing masks.
 store narrow long, follow distance rules move whole store layout make paths limit number people once. 
 Easily 40-50% customers complain sanitize hands, follow path can't walk back forth, 
  
What pandemic taught good chunk people care anything immediate needs. Fuck others, fuck next week, fuck next year, fuck future, want now. Newsom overrode days ago statewide mandate no? yeah valley smaller towns much relaxed general even saw ""reopen"" protests. I’ve bars literally can’t make drink bc cups pretty much wait get back wash use. (If don’t plastic). I’m guessing happened. friends share drinks waiting get own, doubt asked start sharing bar. 

EDIT: posted soon, finished last sentence. I’ve preaching UBI couple years finally people willing listen. Holy shit NEVER appropriate time right fucking guess overweight, it’s problem. she’s still child fucking freaks. Imagine late June still believing outdoor transmission significant issue It’s like deja vu Yeah. tired lockdown skeptics talking constantly government destroying economy. people denial. think things would ok lockdown. businesses closed lockdown orders anyway.

I happy lifted restrictions getting tired whining blaming. natural disaster, emotionally rewarding blame someone problems instead realizing powerless face nature human behavior. necessarily. People overall aware virus, turning anywhere nearly deadly people initially told. People arent going go get paranoid tested like would before. lot people think might going care would bad cold. High risk people symptoms, know need do. I've seen, July 1st arrives, EU provide guidelines opening external borders member countries. going metric coronavirus cases per 100K people. outside country meets metric virus outbreak control, allowed travel EU. far know, US, Brazil, Russia (possibly others but, main three I've seen reported) allowed entry initial phase July. EU cycle back around evaluate metrics every couple weeks, adjust list allowed external countries accordingly.

This speculation ""official"" announcement made yet but, information I've seen reported. I've seen information reported New York Times, Telegraph, Business Insider, etc. point, given situation US surging cases multiple states (especially state FL which, absolutely appalling), count Americans able visit Europe awhile. Many countries want US tourism money but, expense healthcare systems citizens. part, EU countries generally on-board barring Americans entry US get situation control.

Problem is, leadership (Trump) certain state governors (I'm looking you, Ron DeSantis) desire control situation. actions, appears desire suppress facts current situation order force reopening businesses sake economy. Problem is, people can't foresee anything outside typical financial quarter realize infecting people, overloading healthcare system, deaths much greater negative effect compared actually enforcing preventative safety measures. Yeah, listen carefully press conferences come conclusion. talking deflections. talking criticism border closure. michigander feel unfortunately

The people want shut down. wear mask.  shooting foot. Construction, real estate, surveyors/inspection, pest removal, elective medicine, hair salons... mean, pretty much anything low volume/high dollar transactions, low variable costs, think. Many retail places cant operate profitably without high volume customers, outnumbered non-essential businesses can, think. Nice Good luck friend. Stay safe can. TBF, mass graves (assuming talking Hart Island) die next kin claim body. literally nowhere else put corpses one coming claim them. like start seeing bodies piling streets carted mass grave says ""COVID-19 Victims Burial Site"". 

""City officials hope burials Hart Island temporary interments. caskets marked hope individuals eventually claimed proper burial. ""

\- Snopes

&amp;#x200B;

I think mass graves first choice people afford/ people take care burials, cannot said homeless forgotten. case, mass graves may become option one arrange burial them. Excuse fuck? Whatever say bro. you’ve experienced heard? I’ve going around lunch time maybe 20-30 people max large gym usually swamped 7-7. Social distancing masks required times unless cardio machine. I’ve seen staff tell people please put mask risk asked leave multiple times. Everyone also given spray bottle disinfectant arrive requested properly wipe machine use.

People go gym generally care health people I’m scared around. It’s bars, restaurants, grocery stores refuse go biweekly grocery trip. people think govt organized enough fake moon landing 9/11. people commenting looks need get fucking life heart. What’s wrong y’all? DIED  saying MAGA morons sole cause covid spreading like wild fire? fit Reddit narrative... can't ""zoom enhance"" blurry picture Obama high-res photo white guy. [Oh people maths living know things. put gas car since March 12. still half tank. used fill week. Exactly. never got bad here. sure hell near tipping point, especially interstate travel NYC, nj pa. pulled plug everything nick time slow low re-entry. understand people get frustrated, I'm frustrated great job Higher mask usage tend decrease impact close proximity crowds, especially outdoors. need perfect compliance, decent level good results. Eventually, yes. momentum carry scope epidemic beyond herd immunity threshold. Memorial Day. I’m sure FDA already working hard can. isn’t going anything  Huh, opposite. Everyone friend circle supports Trump defriended me. NJ, CT well. RemindMe! 10 days don’t wear masks instead? 
They’d rather locked wear mask? Wait really?

Everclear shots everyone party weekend! Wooo, partying safely!!! small price pay salvation Pennsylvania too. governor Health Secretary deserve ton credit, little late. Might run hospital beds masks required allowed get bad. 

Why hard wear damn mask around people? supply low, even lower demand. naturally prices go bids house. Link? Like clockwork. I’m sure is, biased least. Pretty hard believe alot things days. RE: Georgia Unemployment System  know enough administrative system USA read wikipedia, Alaska seem special status (""Like U.S. states, Alaska governed republic, three branches government: executive branch consisting governor Alaska appointees head executive departments"").     
If anything, would compare Guiana Hawaii      
Anyway, states USA much independance France, everything strongly centralized since revolution. France one region decide legalize another not.

I say part France proper, that's term ""overseas territories"" means either. gonna contact trace guy actually put effort mitigate spread, or...

Edit: also - coronavirus treatment US isn’t free yet? unenforceable also pretty hypocritical Cuomo do. someone fly New York Texas, say they're staying Pennsylvania can't anything it. disturbing \*university\* wrong widely-publicized story--one heard without even researching topic. far know, zero research, even proper time research, ""current recommended changes per hour"" ventilation systems. federal standard that, know of. evidence, even, ""air changes per hour"" anything all--or even helps spread virus among people room. super hinky part school imo.  insulting people expecting come around explain shit you.

I dont expect anything you. made comment someone else. interjected expect explain shit you. 1st reply conflating haircuts protesting equal activities problem.

You NEVER explained problem, fucking point. oringal post nothing substance, nothing point out, besides lack breath, step away computer, go outside. I'm washing hands conversation, wont read response.

Take advice. one owes anything, especially first reply nothing btw *""teh ad homienems""*

Fuck hypocritical intellectual wannabe. people start bitching start, think anyone cares leave conversation? never ask input anything He's brave.

/s Right dont definitivly know. 

But OP implied didnt last, studies viruses contradict statement precident believe covid different.

Also colds caused rhinoviruses, coronaviruses fyi. getting cold every time. litterally hundreds different strains mutating time. people charge would told us worked.... shockedpicachu lot people state received unemployment payments since March eviction moratorium next month. I'm thinking another lock go well here. need mix ammonia first. Mail letter where? address back home state? coworker mine went home today symptoms. one noticed. I
was told management tell others. late, told everyone. *waves hands*


Magickaaaa. fair reopening spikes happened month half states reopened, mind expect stats protests become clear another weeks Scottsdale councilman leads hundreds ""Infect Us"" rally City Hall

Fixed it. guess he's irrelevant current climate kinda flew radar I'm (former) COVID hotspot Northeast, NYC. 

Normally 50-60 ICU beds total (including surgical ICU beds normally would used pneumonia patients) peak 112 COVID patients intubated (so almost certainly ICU release numbers""

Testing area become realistic idea last month two, least average person. really think government allowed problem become has.

What’s purpose freedom situations freedom doesn’t translate higher quality life? Lol opened gyms first said sign waiver saying haven’t state yadda yadda, gave couple days. Think through... states initially hit hardest locked hard *because* got hit hard, states half-assed much way cases spread, even half-assed lockdown would seriously clamp vectors spreading. 

If 12 states referring initially hit harder, lockdowns would taken seriously. fuckin shit show people wearing masks public, 99% N95 masks? people realize probably getting around 50% coverage? looks better, fancy designer black mask? aren’t states especially NY aren’t seeing increases . reopening early clearly main culprit pre-COVID though. facing mass evictions unprecedented scale. Many people going safety net staying friend family member past. Huh... hadn’t realized able control pressure field hospitals. That’s honestly astonishing, makes feel better. 

While population density may lower, one things worries extraordinary rate comorbidities throughout south. believe we’ll see higher death rates, simply massive rates obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, CAD, etc. Govenors mandating people wear masks? already mandated businesses close, require masks public? make sense refunded Everybody time everything nobody would able travel anywhere would Airlines overpriviledged

Europeans thankful US helped rebuild continent helped deter Soviet Invasion.

My fiance Europe. seen 6 months. planning move us get married year but, that's going happen. I've become bitter whole situation here, automatically assume even able see next year I'm devastated. Yea fixed it. phone defaulting spelling apparently. Abbot basically saying “look people stop bitching it, course 5,000+ new cases per day, opened everything back up. People need understand that.” Yes no, insurance reimbursed people deductible(?), franchise french, still pay it. misinformation countinues perpetuated.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* soon something matter life death, longer elective. Literally definitions words work.

In fact, something life threatening also wait, that's semi-elective. no, nobody die missing elective surgery. 

Maybe missing elective make situation serious, get surgery. WH simply threw hands said ""let individual State figure cope"". much reason willfully ignorant members public wear masks: ""Taking leadership position national crisis *Un-Popular!""*. aren’t allowed store without mask. don’t think makes difference? kidding? 

I went hiking last week even half people masks they’d slip passed someone trail. 

Yeah there’s 9 million people course every single person taking seriously. good job overall. Every single person mask one less person catch spread it. adds Because, governor SUPPOSED take information that's available interpret use way benefits people. Regular dude Starbucks held standard elected official, lot ""normal"" people simply can't parse type data available situation like this. supposed fall constituents decide whether governor trying endanger not, assumed elected official would behave way. But, Trump's America version 2020 absolutely blows, guess assumed extent. We're seeing front eyes. 2-3 weeks ago wanna say weekend June 5th. right time, start seeing huge rise cases especially people CHAZ location. I’m thinkin July 4th weekend record high cases. would surprised simply let expire end July. likelihood sunbelt states forced resort near partial shutdown near future since healthcare systems look like overwhelmed soon. People starting realize idea willing virus away illusion. living 13 14 different countries things would better. 

The worst thing places like CT cannot legally ban foreigners FL, TX entering state. 

Open borders horrible idea face pandemic. scientist read German: confirm mentioned neutralising antibodies created. Thanks reminding another ancient text really get know better Ok count working companies though talk IRL Surgical masks don’t explode. Vote November better administration guide us rest crisis. That’s do. current administration simply doesn’t give fuck give fuck don’t power override don’t. There’s one email call change people’s minds Start stockpiling cash can

I'm gonna stop right there. fault, obviously millennials again. refitting stadiums? Surgical nose chin removal could become thing.  refused wear mask buy mask late April. kept hearing professionals masks work risk people wear one. want hoard masks others need me, refused get one figured one would make difference anyway. therapist told mother law cancer scared go public last couple masks find masks anywhere. felt selfish buying wearing mask I'm healthy, athletic 20 something elderly cancer patients scared going outside. 

When consensus changed bought pack disposable masks reusable ones. wear one every time go now. mind it. Even work hurt might well wear it. I've heckled made fun public it, kind scary lone small woman. anyway. 

Maybe I'm sheep want hurt anyone. wanting hurt others driven choices pandemic, that's ended following advice sound. bought worn mask earlier. want hurt anyone snatching up. totally get constantly evolving situation science playing catch right now, I'm angry experts getting wrong. wish we'd given consistent information. ""under control"" I'm law virus. normal, pandemic handled largely. Let people decide self-isolate. everybody required wear mask, people regard suspicious POC it. opposite really - they're part.  Tell Taiwan knew shared drinks anyhow. 

I care article says likely virus going bar. Rather felt symptoms beforehand another story. virus average incubation period five six days earliest possible onset symptoms day two. means buddy rare cases contracted virus within 24 hours started show symptoms. outbreak would control needs go away since Trump Obama fired him. [Group 700 beds really far get hundred added everyday. Mickey gonna run castle Hong Kong. think that's safest castle right him. Orlando safe Anaheim. areas getting pummeled anti maskers social distancing literally gone protests started. spike also coincides people wearing masks en masse public. US vastly overstating effectiveness cloth masks form source control point mass hysteria. 

If fat orange moron President wore one would calling idiot showcasing studies show ineffective are. 

Social distancing far effective wearing cloth mask. controlled laboratory study cloth masks mimic real world usage, slightly loose, adjust it, touch things make virtually useless. Flu mutates rapidly, covid not, like polio vaccine almost eradicated polio yearly flu shot. hope gyms stay business except Planet Fitness, deserve go business. down, I'm bit surprised since moved everything pharmaceuticals, bleach, large makers cleaning products, telecommunications..all stuff clean lock down. didnt know sun killed virus 3 seconds someone sneezes. *Glances dailies California, Florida, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, North South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee.* 

Uh huh. Regardless vaccine could ready, still ton of...(what's opposite lead time?)... time needed manufacture, distribute, administer. 

We've tested ~30 million people Covid-19 ~4 months...that's less 10% population. Even necessary doses available instant vaccine confirmed effective, still going take months vaccinate significant portion population. would take 900k vaccinations per day, 7 days week, 6 months vaccinate half US population. People math known this. People public health recommended mitigation strategies. politicians need implement them. I’m shocked /s Living bronx, ny. Yes, low, gone. city opens fully, we'll see spike ny. Tell countless employers across nation recalling everyone office I’ve wanting race years. finally spot year. I’m glad made early decision. letting us defer ny marathons next 3 years refund. organization fair happy support future. might want self reflect think going on, read comments far actually take in...

So testing means numbers go - yes true.

But also number number infected / tests also going up. ratio many tests positive, absolutely exploding.

Take Arizona, 20% numbers huge! Yep edited right saw comment cuz double check AZ’s positive rate. Can’t believe it’s averaging around 21% PSA generate cognitive dissonance people. California also largest population 39 million smaller percentage would still larger amount cases. Hell Los Angeles larger population 40 states. Seems like read headlines like every single day sub, yet daily deaths US whole consistently falling since  didn't. He's trying say US numbers high reported. Taking reports away reduce infection rate reduce deaths. reported such. Making things 10000 times worse people think over.
Its dumb thing rationalise. Sure nothing refusing wear masks, indoors, crowding bars restaurants either right? No, we’re supposed glad we’re work. Yay. love people say ""everyone entitled opinion"" forget opinion supersede facts. can't opinion that's different facts, do, opinion fucking wrong. Seriously fuck guy, stupid fuck. Everyday probably record day till fucking something it. least stops preventing localities something it. Anyone else surprised NY get spike cases protests? south shall rise again? Maybe evidence suggests prolonged close contact indoors spreads virus much short-term close contact outdoors?

Nah, be. know anything planned production vaccine? know Oxford aims 2 billion doses autumn, one? Coronavirus transmission indoors. temperature doesn’t directly impact spread, might influences human behavior.

- Schools session fall-winter-spring
- workers take less vacations school session
- Days shorter

But far weather, guess nice temperate weather 70-80 degrees get maximum number people outside. South US, weather started hitting 90’s high humidity, people went indoors (restaurants, malls,, clubs, gyms, etc) things open. 

Which means we’ll see Southern surge head back north fall schools back temperatures drop.  Shit plenty PPE, there's reason cancel them. COVID patients segmented floors/wings/area hospitals anyways, like people getting surgeries vulnerable recovering next someone COVID. 

Canceling electives going run hospitals business end year. Bloomberg reporting $60 billion loses far across US hospitals. Sure, government provide little relief, enough keep business. agree current circumstances change royally fucked. Sadly yes, referred chlorinated chicken UK, shame chlorine isn’t problem.

It’s fact animal husbandry standards US much lower UK, means meat likely carry harmful bacteria chlorine wash effective counter issue.

The problem isn’t chlorine wash, it’s sanitary conditions make necessary (coupled fact doesn’t fully offset sanitary conditions).

I hate media picked chlorinated chicken buzzword. It’s bit like calling Covid-19 oxygen problem, oxygen treatment underlying problem. fair immune system, everyone's pretty shit comes novel virus. human body nothing compare to.  least we've consistency 6 feet apart rule. Well applied where, 6 feet whole time. cruel person, shitting someone who's life coming end due failed government policies fault own

So congrats I'm glad things going well you! I'm dumb side state saw poll local news site. 30% said good thing, 15% said like follow it, 55% said plan following it.

Mayor said enforcing too.

Glad many fucking idiots here. California also largest population 39 million smaller percentage would still larger amount cases. Hell Los Angeles larger population 40 states. real answer one knows contact tracing. 

The argument definitely cause stupid coincidences reopening behaviors risky (indoor dining / crowded bars). 

The arugement definitely cause stupid large gathering yelling perfect mask wearing timing kinda makes sense. 

Reality likely somewhere in-between. Mattis going go conservative Jesus figure ""liberal cuck"" real quick. Central CA earthquake today. Perhaps OP confused. Yeah catholicism superstition grift anything else, little Bible. Martin Luther's main point even true 1517. Hospitals back March/April stop elective non-emergency procedures, drastically reducing amount patients hospital. Beds open floors turn temporary ICU's. Beyond city/state/feds open temporary field hospitals fly equipment/staff. yes - one mentions this? something off. Seriously...fuck guy!! Cutting funding shutting hahahah.  else could ppl acting like pandemic serious problem end up? ppl wake realize virus started one single person infected spread millions. thousands asymptomatic ppl going around masks what, think somehow work out? chicken pox party? mean?  already? Australia one first things stopped - unless life threatening go hospital order free space pandemic patients Yes! idiots kept coming Houston beach! Causing traffic back miles! block entrances! Covid 19 barely touched community, us careful. Since Texas ended lockdown coming Houston seen huge increase cases. people July 4th memorial day. we're start over. know people getting sick I'm worried school starts back definitely exposed. work children. people cannot accept real danger act appropriately. (And get started government completely failing provide assistance working regulations. worry losing money...) work large hospital Houston since begining April long lasting fatigue tachycardia due infected Covid. saw cardiologist Methodist see heart damage. Nurse told yesterday, 300 employees Covid. *one* hospital, numbers still rising. total disaster, frankly Gov Abbot directly responsible. Well would lower corona virus deaths Birch wood say? fine. RIP. governors states surging cases held criminally liable. like letting people go there's infestation bears, everyone's wondering everyone getting mauled bears ending ICU. That's Oxford vaccine, 
one. certain point there’s nothing do. husband filed claim (in PA) sat “pending” 7 weeks. dutifully filed biweekly claims still took 2 months get payment. tried calling (repeatedly, setting alarm call opened, randomly throughout day, etc) phone rang busy signal. chat option website wouldn’t open email response time quoted 22 days site. Hopefully lower positive rate get, Arizona Florida seem working way. anyone else getting anxious reading thread? Lots people claiming mild cases result permanent lung damage, lung transplant, blood clots, organ failure, etc, get happens know much virus yet sound like ""lockdown vaccine"" people, know vaccine coming sure, know find effective treatment (I know lots tested still) lot people mental health compromise sub help think claiming organ failure lung transplant happen extremely often responsible still considered severe cases. takeaway protests outdoors many protesters wore masks, virus spread much people feared. Also many protesters younger, get infected mild asymptomatic cases went unreported. cases detected partially offset folks stayed home civil unrest. Tough prove course. retired general gives accurate medical advice president. Texas first try go back ""normal?"". Sure working them. Gosh. Nobody saw coming. probably high risk unless someone COVID19 using room recently. hotels high vacancy rates right chances high. Overall hotels pretty decent social distancing, limited interactions others, things like room service come there. Historically China harsh people try whistleblow many people disappeared NYT article primarily about.

  
Source this? leaders tiananmen square massacres got something like 8 years jail (dont remember exact figure remember light considering did, gonna go this, send msg anyone reading interested), (according tiananmen square documentary funded koch brothers).  
  
Actual doctors reported coronavirus anything done them. Obviously NYT going report this. mention Dr. Li. please research him. whistleblower. repeating news already released Chinese CDC strange pneumonia. also talking coworkers/friends even specifically said spread message around. mean say now. know future. People naturally lax off. hope I'm wrong, virus going anywhere. Funny countries done testing also improved thier reports procedures yet thier numbers shooting up.

Makes think Somebody took economics. Oh man, I'll shot honor later living Bears fan! Even non-nuclear terms means quickly accurately destroy pretty much target planet without putting people harm's way. 

Imagine two countries capability going head head total war.  true, Arizona hosting showcase baseball tournaments held high school players perform front college / mlb scouts players traveling every part US. That's awful incredibly stupid. Maybe quick face full anti bacterial spray would prevent young people still dying home. Every person I’ve told that’s infected 30 years old sent home medication. cannot fix stupid. states self righteous insane large part american political ideology rests idea economy something outside human control something must keep growing otherwise society constricts collapses.

An economic recession lockdown chance actually dictate terms recession (essentially making recession technical definition only), takes resources, political will, ideology willing work fact order pull off. US former spades, next nothing latter two. pretend isn’t happening yourself? rest us trying live. Europeans thankful US helped rebuild continent helped deter Soviet Invasion. Europeans thankful US helped rebuild continent helped deter Soviet Invasion. 

Really? lot Europeans (\*especially reddit\*) sound like pompous assholes, even considering enormous amount US taxpayer money subsidized defenses last 60 years. US leave NATO EU forced build defenses. Well, mean obviously unprotected sex better immune system is, thus prevents spread STDs

We meant wear condoms, that's satan's work Cause wouldn’t want people avoid unsafe places lol town. I've dozen protests even seen protester without mask (of color), ironically, crowd generally pretty young healthy. go certain suburbs see chubby old ladies men masks. sticking 600k estimate... 2020. end this, 7 digits likely.

prove wrong.

NO SERIOSLY PROVE WRONG.

wear masks. Let's numbers. Bexar county 7k confirmed cases. Considering confirmed cases generally considered fraction actual cases, lets triple number 21k cases account people yet tested, asymptomatic, etc. (This probably much much lower actual number)

With population 2m Bexar County divided 21k potential cases, 1 95 residents could potentially it, currently. 

Is 95 people going gym day? Covid stay airborne 3 hours indoors live days metal. I've heard lots gyms require masks. Lots huffing puffing. 

Doesn't look good.

Also, remember, covid infections exponential. case number blown away within two weeks. quick edit? I'm pretty sure read 15k replied. Good them. Nobody waiting government protect families virus.  disabled friend lives social housing disinfects outside door handle, door buzzer panel, mailbox, hand rail doorknob every time enters exits apartment. They're things going touch anyway wipe do? $1 bottle bleach disinfectant wipes go long way. No, one advanced. lucky 300k pace on. took 2.5ish months 2 mil infections 100k deaths. actual effective lockdowns many places.

We arent going lock again...and virus spread clusters today middle march. next 2.5 monthe sure worse April-May . probably 300k dead end August without reimposing strict lock downs **today**. that's going happen. Someone wife's workplace got tested past Saturday notified day positive. Work place notify workers noon Monday failed contact tracing, quarantine, cleaning protocols they've hyping months. Heavily sedated. Saying numbers won’t go fast stop testing technically true, he’s still gigantic moron. Mr. Mattis certainly right that; family &amp; I’ve gone 4 times self imposed quarantine, always masks on, we’ve taking much better care ever imagined 🎭 US state propaganda, likely created NGO funded US. Watch see actually handled coronavirus. Note they've never ever mentioned media.  ok 14 billion. Read article. Nowhere comment mention Trump. responding insinuation Americans good financially right now. None discussion Trump.  64% ICU patients NON-COVID patients.

Also, title says Houston, article states 9 counties. sure that’s better worse, data doesn’t specify Houston’s stats alone. Alright pal. Smart people don’t care it’s made by. works, vaccine saves lives, fuck politics. still shock haven’t already done this. Good job misreading. What's next trick? I'm sad say, American thing. times likely. polarization Hungary. either 100% pro-party traitor country.  ""That’s problem America: they're smug everything little reason be""... hhhm... cars, cell phones, flight, internet basically, medicine, military financial support/ sacrifice.... yeah hey, fuck us stick. Trumps arrogant lil bitch sweeping generalization. It’s going magically disappear! mean, open monorail there's access resorts lagoon, fully stock kitchens I'd down.

Well, depending many people we're talking. Magic Kingdom's full 90k capacity? Hell nah, wanna participate Hunger Games get room.

But would watch it. Unfortunately plenty people medical field acting way. know two PAs bachelorette party one NP went indoor nightclub memorial day weekend. gross. banning Chinese travelers govt lying Corona covering months os another anti-american political stunt?

Thanks punishing us Russia hacking election putting tyrant power actually lost popular vote. appreciate return kind future. watched 5 min youtube video titled “everything need know fax machines 5 mins” count one Make sure remember third world war shit like food, PPE, maybe vaccine. parents grandparents die alone virus ICU. Think scared stressful them. Maybe use final breath call you. never know. hey, able go grab beer hear news. 🍻 8 countries higher deaths per million US Europe. 5 EU. 

EU look closer home throwing stones. Oh fucked before, done great job rebounding. believe fun couped apartment 2 months leaving recreation trips grocery store. Texas, Florida Arizona need put work now. favour large scale death possibility future reduction obesity?
Ok mate Generic version remedisvir called CIPREMI. Yeah, that's getting at. suppose country decide own. beginning impossible enter US europe. Later impossible enter EU US.  
Currently EU allows citizens go US (If dual citizenship example). enter US allowed to. could enter US EU passport, would also allowed back EU EU deny entry citizens. would quarantine coming back though. link handy I'm mobile, look ""healthcare systems ratings Lancet"" get latest, thorough research made world's healthcare systems, funded Bill &amp; Melissa Gates Foundation. 

Spoiler alert, US ranked 30th (33rd Iirc?), Americans think they're ranked first.

So yes, right bullshit. definitely keep banned EU.

All 8 countries higher deaths per million US Europe. 5 EU. Concur. would add world war likely follow collapse USA. goes around, comes around. I'm terribly sorry folks deal this. It’s completely related. That’s loser, liberal mindset. Zero common sense. “Defund police send social workers”. loser breaks house, going call? social worker? Businesses set rules masks. Local governments can. People can. choice associating people wear masks, thus mitigating level risk.

Or, insult strangers internet. 

One leads healthier immune system, thus better survival odds. doesn't. OMG unreal Arizona itself. useless drivel.

Imagine, people thinking obesity anything choice.

You pointed obvious! sir, monster!

Please. Obesity kills ruins lives least 100 million Americans. also lessens quality life increases cost living. Obesity pandemic we've comfortably lived generations. Wait, implying media hyperbolic reporting headlines like

* EU condemns Trump's coronavirus travel ban

* Coronavirus: E.U. blasts Trump's travel ban unleashes chaos confusion

* Anger, confusion Europe Trump issues coronavirus travel ban

The media would never exaggerate, truth!!!! Reading reinforces sentiment never visiting country.. good thing agree one guess.. Good point. Russia China would somewhat good, put tight leash it. Believe me, it’s matter time. thinking everyone Europe back March, look happened. Seriously wishing home state Michigan would right now! Seeing path USA currently on.. July 4th scares me.

Good luck telling US citizens stay inside home day they're celebrating freedom.. planning celebrating, please safe. WARNED. Meh increase prices people able afford medical care, problem solved /s great get restaurants barbers open, global business reputation completely tattered time over.

I think many people realise matter important economy small businesses getting away importance big global players.

A Ford GM employ thousands directly use local businesses, also Tier n suppliers, whose employees use local businesses. like tree big company trunk, branches leafs smaller businesses. Witness happens city big business/employer closes down. F guy!! overused dipshit asswhole hope gets gonorrhea. mean, might spandex it’s gonna tight fit showcase curves really need daily updates state? aware countries apart america right? Trump managed build wall around US.. keep people in.   Thanks sensible advice. We’ve taken seriously Thailand quite used taking precautions. worry Emirates totally failed detect large number cases passengers boarded; speaks badly proclaimed standards, frankly. You’re also right course additional danger lies UK; presently, go, Thai government let back, make conditions onerous may decline. UK here. We're exactly renowned handling pandemic, we're slowly re-opening (bars restaurants opening reduced capacity week two) backdrop &lt; 1000 new cases day trending slowly down, relatively high testing rate, lots caution second wave horrified hear what's happening States right now. Every indicator glowing red, daily new cases approaching historical highs (ten times UK adjusted population), yet restrictions disappearing. worst worlds - massive economic damage caused lockdowns enforced, without persisting long enough return benefit.

It's scary think bad might get - hope right bottom end predicted curves. Stay safe. Sorry, ""ex-super power"". EU would gone two weeks US. people us eu really care chinese say do.
on hand, millions chinese know english look what's new west. someone found something interesting useful may translate chinese share others. need younger people office! 70-something year old supposed represent constituents interests can't relate them? seems entirely unrelated. think police treating every call right now? think social workers are? know social workers, know not, I'm fairly confident police probably less likely enter homes right now, probably careful do. Whether provides avenue towards vaccine, staggering levels development likely advanced field epidemiology decades past 4 months. less 1000 close contacts, need test next RNA antibodies. Land free! Japanese toilets need instruction manual next them. reason message needs spread widely half country selfish fucks zero empathy, otherwise might care killing parents/grandparents friends co-workers. you’re stupid purpose even passport? actually offensive Reality subjective - think aint so, aint world little fairy tale: science fiction infection made people zombies, America would gone now. Vladimir Putin's slogan. US lower death rates Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden, France.

The US tested higher proportion population Italy, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, etc.

The shutdowns complete waste time. can't stop disease infections spreading. could, would stomped flu years ago.

The thing US mismanaging plan recover economic devastation caused people.

The number bankruptcies, evictions, foreclosures we're going see protections rolled back going devastating economic effects last years. ""We're fine."" Personally knows someone ICU. Incredible. can't dumb fucks use brain? Whether worked found done. young people exposed sooner later, could include me. also dozen diseases could kill me. take precautions recommended.

I also wear seatbelt, know could deadly car accident driving 60 mph. Everything cost benefit ratio, mine different yours, probably different great scheme things. Obviously living city worse transmission not. Wisconsin excluded Milwaukee totals, we'd half deaths cases do, like could exclude NYC NYS. even compare NYS even without city, still worse Wisconsin Milwaukee factored in. 

As long point states Northeast better right places trying pretend like everything somehow fine, I'm agreement you. Best luck - try something spiritual, even religion. Really helps even don’t take seriously prove ones supporting crazy well? Oh, they'll squeak I'm sure combination scaring hispanic black voters threats cops coming arrest/deport vote, closing polling places, throwing people voter rolls technicality, sending absentee ballots certain voters, good old fashioned election fraud (""losing ballots"", ballot stuffing, etc.)

Texas minority-majority state (hispanic, black, asian, mixed race 51% population there) yet supermajority republican government routinely disenfranchise gerrymandering. Could show us reliable sources claim? 52% age 50+? getting at? reasons:

1. know lot virus today. Transmission, asymptomatic rate, death rate. death rate March thought 6-8 times higher actually is.

2. Fatigue. People people, mentally people can't stay home forever. meme ""Gotta get hair done go bars,"" whatever. much home grow bored. everyone play video games endlessly watch Netflix endlessly. many things around house/yard run things do.

3. people give fuck, never given fuck poorly educated. Prez recent weeks basically guiding protest reject science.  Shhhh. Im stock holder. guys liked marvel movies. They’re expensive produce. 

We need get cash flow going soon you’ll never see anything like again. Almost friends family Louisiana believe NYC overblown falsified media hoax. bought time. better treatments (MATH+ protocol maybe). totally worthless. yeah pretty much. people wear masks change behavior. Wa wa wa.. Yes. people know cancer happy make 3.5 hour drive Houston. need help, another classic delusional brainwashed American. laughing stock world lmfao  NY good example, something like 25% already got it, unlikely come back strong That's pretty convoluted ... I'll surprised many manage keep mind without confusing *other* recent cockamamie excuse. 2 days ago biggest hospital Austin sending patients hospitals due capacity. Entire floors become covid we’re approaching hurricane season, recipe disaster. Houston obese city too? data lagged two weeks. looking yesterday's data site always significantly. means they're go-to hospital local hospitals flooded.

If need ICU Covid19 hospital capacity, maybe get palliative care bed die in. Antibodies immunity. cell-mediated response antibodies say much. best french fries? It’s getting scary

It's already June, post still countless people basic questions masks!

Within half month, China issues universal mask wearing, use, scenarios use masks, repeatability argument, etc.

It's June, looks like epidemic happened. think underestimate much administrative staff backoffice bs required big companies. majority tech development located elsewhere, often areas research universities tech companies (for recruiting, development networking reasons). think would probably like Thailand moment, need 18th tuktuk driver ask I'm going, walked past 17 tuktuk drivers. 

No, need new suit. cold beer would good though.

There's 160,000 hospitals worldwide.

In top 100, 18 United States. source:  Good times long distance relationship  YES! people understand masks?!? fine people wearing Resorting piracy actions war. respect US still holds would gone instantly would anyone downvote that? That’s countries successfully control spread Fauci preaching. 

It’s one’s don’t follow guidelines tear everyone else. That's Feds money printing machine going brrrr stock market. stop soon. America really loser country. ridiculous much US government failed. let happen you. Oust idiot already Apparently last post political let try rephrasing it. 

That basically WI bought legislature Supreme Court decided sacrifice grandma appease line. Governor still done best give counties option longer keep things closed limited feel necessary (and run ""red team"" member course). acted case count low though, we'd probably like Minnesota right now. used neck neck cases deaths (they basically demographics population size) blew past us months ago almost twice many deaths now. Every neighbor worse us (even Canada country!). **Wait, implying media hyperbolic reporting headlines EU condemns Trump's coronavirus travel  Coronavirus: E.U. blasts Trump's travel ban unleashes chaos  Anger, confusion Europe Trump issues coronavirus travel **The media would never exaggerate, truth!!!!**


I know seems pretty straight forward. going say post made feel ancient. Seat belts well established 90s. favour large scale possibility future reduction obesity

I live Japan. 10 years ago massive campaign obesity. really raised awareness problem. personally know dozens people stepped efforts lose weight. population noticeably thinner. also well known public campaigns effective, advertising, financial incentives. possibility reduction, fact would reduced.

All American relatives highly overweight (sans 2). None Japanese relatives are. go convenience store Japan, lots healthy choices. go American convenience store almost none. whatever morality scheme dreamed up, facts. Covid19 obviously attacking people compromised immune systems. What's number one reason people compromised immune systems PREVENTABLE? Obesity.  they’re barely testing, rate inflated. testing US level, Mexico would 20-30k new cases everyday forgot put “/s” Febreezer trucks Thinning idiot herd.

“The Mayo’s Clinic ,” similar meaning to, “continuing medical education. cradle school shootings 1972  Indoors really risk longer period time higher risk. Fundamentally viral load likely inhale amount necessary catch Covid.

Someone passing 1m away outdoors pavement probably little zero risk.

Someone passing 1m away big supermarket aisle still probably little risk (although risk grows time spend inside).

Spending 15mins inside bus train people 1m away higher risk.

Spending 1-2hrs restaurant crowded pub people 1m (or less) away even higher risk. Found Pittsburgher lol Dublin work one listed companies. 


Didn't know working shell company. Thanks letting know /s Means probably even top 50 worldwide. Maybe even worse. think reason people don’t think it’s big deal personally don’t see happening immediate life. social distancing means it’s working.. people don’t see issue happens systemic problem applies many society’s problems. sweep rug.. mention funerals, sudden inheritance transfers, real estate sales massive scale. None stuff easy prepared, blindsiding X00,000 families recipe chaos. got argument someone facebooks nurse said facemasks anything, pointless wear n95 anything help wears one better nothing...

Then stated covid numbers lie hospitals making death counts slapping covid everyone dies get free money government...

LOL think president appeared TV mask urged followers Americans general wear masks social distance would make huge difference? gonna sound dumb

That's exactly problem, right there, mentality. cautious dumb. Everyone thinking dumb entire cause problem US.  know businesses right thing, way program set ripe greed fraud
- 100 percent forgiveness grants certain timeline - skin game business owner grant.
- means testing business - businesses stayed open generating revenue could still get wages expenses paid free. Larry Kudlow scenario - artist wife apply PPP loan “art studio”
- means testing owner - multi millionaires could still apply grants pay staff instead pocket. Jim Kramer scenario - worth 100 million dollars using PPP loans pay wait staff 15 bucks hour
- paying people 50 bucks hour stay home - Ruth Chris scenario. Everyone complains $600 extra unemployment benefits, government paying people 50 bucks hour work? 

With 2 trillion stimulus could given every man woman child country $6000! could treated like 3-6 week snowstorm, really shut things squished virus all. half country didn’t need money all.

But scenario, highly leveraged business owners lose 5-10 percent net worth. Gyms perfect example - never building, rent. almost always lease equipment. way make money monthly membership people never show making memberships hard cancel. cut membership stream two months done, hence outcry open gyms early. Jokes cause virus doesnt work herd immunity. Anti bodies dont seem last long enough achieve herd immunity. so, people American passport. know people got travel canceled limited. limitation included;

Vote local elections, please! fuck decided mayo clinic good name... didn’t actually know CA minimum (I live CA) you’re right. said, even though town $16/hr city ordinance, can’t find anywhere live wage :( it’s awful. mention smoking demographics interestingly, dozens geographically disparate studies -- stretching back early february consistently highlighted appears paradoxical protective affect smoking status wrt hospital incidences. precise mechanism behind observations till unclear clinical trials underway may help inform. 

It's fair point wrt Obesity hypertension prevalence- though two examples, chronic kidney disease, HIV Athsma others, host variability HMGB1 expression (recent paper published days ago suggest could important till undiscovred component, similar hypothesis ACE2 expression) also much discussed angle Vitamin D, well TMPRSS2, testosterone, eostrogen, androgen variations 

One issues drive blame Racism readily notice often puts focus Black Americans exclusively--like article, takkng US explain areas Hispanics overrepresented mortality? observed--Hispanic several circumstances facing significant burden relative % population. example remain racism instead counted deprivation? examples see higher mortality rates Caucasians (relative demographics)? 

I found interesting note UK study examining skew BAME demographics found strong correlation household occupancy lack qualifications. study found clear difference Indian Pakistani individuals. Note access care racial bias angle oft focused US centric discussions given structure UK largely deconstructed 

 noted that, according recent data Hispanics Asians US experience greater household overcrowding Black individuals (using recent data)
Why Asian individuals overrepresented like Black Hispanic?

I absolutely thing poverty determining factor, playing devil's advocate second-- poverty sole explaining factor Vietnam seen single death COVID- also high household occupancy lowered access developed care compared almost US state could mention. Russia seen significantly cases Africa? 
Could factors work. Genetic, Environmental, behavioral (e.g mask adoption) also regardless household conditions, work, comorbidities 

A number studies control socioeconomic effects, deprivation, clinical markers suggest different immune response may likely potential explainers. Several studies highlight Vitamin D, whilst popular topic discussion something that's still understudied. 

I want make clear wish minimize discussion racism. intention-- I've seen several individuals (some journalists background biology virology) seem hell-bent trying explain away observations see far entirely systemtic racism -- that's part aligns leaning narrative want highlight. someone studies disease burden day day cannot get disingenous representation whole picture.

 want us get point 'un-scientific' people taking stand talk sexism also plays role COVID disease burden perhaps ageism too, older men worse affected women distracts minimizes science-- I'm sure somebody could present data showcase older men might less likely visit doctor treated less urgency etc. I'm saying would zero connection studies exist. want us obfuscating significant biological reasons men, senescent population particular face worse outcomes 

there really biological genetic variations races, something reporters repeatedly minimized coverage -- see number examples. E.g sickle cell anemia, HIV, Malaria. already observed statistically differences blood type covid outcome, first GWAS studies given us first validation genetic links elsewhere likely others 

See lambda 4 (gene symbol: IFNL4) one recently discovered human genes newest addition interferon lambda protein family. gene encodes IFNL4 protein, involved immune response viral infection. ""

""whereas ~95% individuals African ancestry carry least one copy IFNL4-ΔG allele able produce IFNL4, percentage drops ~50% Europeans &lt;15% Asians. [As low &lt;5%] ""

The entire ""conservative"" press decided go disruption business. Big suprise there. forced something stole several trillion closed country two weeks declared victory. 

You get government deserve. report scb lie

Really?

The report plainly slightly lower average 2015–2019, **which 1,569 deaths.** 

The actual average week 22, 2015-2019, shown spreadsheet, 1,555.

I know small difference, peoples' *job* working numbers. But, apparently, can't perform simple arithmetic?

They knew damn well words would interpreted. *headline* report ""Mortality Sweden approaching normal levels"", whole gist release things getting back normal.

Sure, careful add qualification claims, know media works, played media like fiddle.

By way... even numbers back ""average"" would still deceptive. Why? COVID-19 started killing people, mortality Sweden year well *below* average.

The March 11, daily mortality 2020 averaging 6.9% *below* 2015-2019 average. professional statisticians know too. know ""average"" year another 6.9% less ""average"".

So really, mortality COVID-19 epidemic least 10% epidemic. That's lying.  Americans need visas they? would assume would super easy control without even considering flight paths. Live NYC. never forget it. Biked past freezer trucks many occasions, knowing fellow New Yorker’s dead. guys don’t want this, I’m telling you. feels weird things starting go back normal here, barely acknowledged death. I’m actually willing give care economy, real reasons one care economy. 

I’m surrounded Trump voters family, last year leg they’ve stand defense “the economy great though! Check 401k! Look stock market!”. goes away, defense him? lot I’ve spoken don’t defend thing, “booming economy”. 

My dad even whined virus destroying Trump’s perfect economy things going well virus. inserted theory virus Democrat hoax take Trump. 

Both Trump many voters know level economy positive talking point Trump going himself. That’s take it, least. love kids.

Which know keeping school indefinitely horrible overall well being.

Everything trade off. 99.9% chance fine got virus. Keeping home made miserable there's 100% chance suffering stay home longer. better spreading outdoors getting masks would two useful (to virus) mutations would disastrous us. hope don’t end selecting those. another shutdown. They'll craft false narrative surge proof shutdowns effective masks become new security blanket get people back buying again. They're thinking strategy keep economy putting along mitigate surges enough find vaccine. That's interpretation anyway. I'm risk life families make smoothies coffee way wealthier people cause asshole whole thinks better us much poorer folk put lives line change pockets. I'm scared, tired stressed broke working day two week receiving help government keeps putting us work sit back reap rewards sale booms. Trump wanted stop Europeans traveling US racist. Seems right. care guy says, we’re Murica. China virus, pres said Let's start consider things. Remember wore one glove coronavirus press briefing? Places like Iceland seem hitting 0.5%, one wonders much fitter population is.

Not fitter. Healthcare system comes play well. wonder getting percentages btw? 

Iny country (Netherlands) we've 49.722 confirmed cases far, 6095 confirmed Corona deaths. That's around 12%

These count deaths confirmed Corona. 
If look worldwide 9.24M cases 447k deaths, that's 4.84%

If look Italy got hit HARD, also REALLY ramped testing, 239.000 cases, 34.675 deaths, 14,51%.

Trump right one thing: test, higher numbers be. Obviously want know numbers surpress might make look bad. 

Worldwide percentage around 5%. countries lot testing get ramped higher, even take base 5% would mean absolute catastrophe. 

Iceland fact really well. (1800'ish cases 10 deaths), number claim bronx 0.32% seems wrong. 

There 213.000 cases New York, 17.591 deaths, percentage 8.26%  need stocks go now! hate world live honest.... Would like haircut indoors would prefer patio today? Matt Gaetz. Pretty much next day first person district died COVID. Belgium? Hard beat good flemish fry. think reopening bigger impact protests.

I live medium-sized city Northern California. worked part-time busy McDonald's here. thing got quit job enjoy summer school saw 20 people crowd small area front register, unmasked. places US put value kinds things religion bothers types key details highlighted enough pandemic. lack transparency increases fear the, lack better word “believer side” gives ammunition “pandemic deniers”. 

Of course positive case numbers continue rise nation wide/world wide FINALLY enough tests test everyone wants one. rationing severely symptomatic/possible hospital admissions. Positive test results cases don’t mean shit vast majority asymptomatic... 1/3 FALSE NEGATIVES areas anyhow. could peaked viral load recovered remain positive/but probably infectious. information extrapolated hypothesized based past present models, nothing says impact community health like dwindling healthcare resources.

What concrete consumption Critical Care resources ICU beds. Like oh shit, COVID taking lot ICU beds, better plan example earthquake, flood, bus crash happens local area near future trends continue. Shit, think Spain maxed 7000! think takes 6 months train competent COVID ICU nurse? Strikes strange, beginning week 5 states said cases, midweek 6 beginning raise alarm, 7 recording record hospitalisations. dumbing spread virus US reminds certain place Asia, people lost minds thought happening. end next week nearly half states struggling hospital space, despite 5 rasing initial alarm. ICU COVID probably thin ice. accurately keep track numbers track chance useful information provide news organization? really critical Victoria get control. Community transmission rest country essentially 0 withe cases showing hotel quarantine. State borders like WA certain stay close sorted. 

Credit Vic, taking serious even offering amount workers can't go due quarantine. KP 👍👍  another good jab young folks get base momentarily distracted. collectively stupid country OK! long nobody anything stupid two weeks ago... This^ discussion going keep banning usa nations anwser yes. guess counting system goes, ""1...2...Many..."", many would ""sound like exaggeration"". One use data statistics tell almost story. Somehow expect pandemic modelling expert. 

It requires modelling experience interpret data correctly. saying lying data, model imply simplistic. I'm Australian who's California life knew that's worth. Oh shit. hard enough time getting everyone board ""first wave,"" hospitals overwhelmed lockdown, I'm afraid sheeple likely believe scientific data coming take precautions late. Also low got 30% positive rate recently day, meaning shit ton testing needed find full extent even mean?! Like ONE ICU houston? want dirty sick people great Europe. Please stay shithole y'all get arrested, thanks US government put message, ""citizens must eat dog shit dinner,"" would people stamping feet whinging eat dog shit want.

Some people think told personal slight them.  🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲 Zealand problems, they're smaller.

No don't. Zero evidence community spread still. sub literally US news. story got posted 3 times. That's CYA op teeth. IOW Texas still driving 100 MPH brick wall. actually look list?

As testing covid-19 expanded, several regions also strengthening infection detection. Region Västerbotten, work underway recruit five nurses relieve primary care contact tracing around covid-19 cases.


Almost two weeks ago, agreement made government Swedish Municipalities Regions (SKR) extended testing covid-19. short, government assumes cost regions undertake carry testing.

The regions also undertake increase contact tracing cases people tested positive ongoing covid-19 infection.

As regions successfully expand possibility testing, example self-testing public, resources contact tracing also expanded.

In Region Västerbotten, infection protection unit looking five nurses work contact tracing. work carried support physicians Infection Protection Unit, group mainly contact trace proven cases covid-19 categories socially important functions within public. explained Stephan Stenmark, infection control physician Västerbotten Region.

- relieve primary care contact tracing work. long tradition central contact tracing contexts. experience good effective, tells Läkartidningen.

However, contact tracing applies health care personnel municipal health care personnel continue managed health care region, new group.

The idea recruit nurses currently working nursing nurses recently retired. Therefore, Stephan Stenmark believes setting group ""steal resources"" healthcare.

- believe strength expertise nurse. give health advice, think good basic competence understand situation, able health care system also able carry good way.

Another region working expand sampling covid-19 Gävleborg. hope self-testing place county shortly.

And order able maintain contact tracing testing expanded, Gävleborg Region also sets central unit handle contact tracing around covid-19. stated Annika Hillgren Mattsson, operations manager specialty medicine person responsible new infection tracking group.

- able continue contact tracing, especially offering people test themselves. want try maintain contact tracing order able get figures, look clusters, cases find measures put place prevent spread infection, ”she tells Läkartidningen.

The idea group initially consist six people. group receive support training infection tracking infection protection unit region.

- work primary care hospital care, simplify management doctors. quite lot getting started getting infected.

The Blekinge region also announced increase contact tracing using extra resources infection protection unit.

- increased testing, naturally expect positive cases need contacted infection detection, says infection protection physician Bengt Wittesjö press release.

Following rapid spread number covid-19 cases Gällivare, Region Norrbotten also stepping sampling infection tracking. There, retired healthcare professionals medical students contact infected initiate infection tracking. should

Most redditors trust experts back arguments making great news, considering vaccine started phase 3 trials UAE. 

On top Sinovac, Modern, Oxford vaccines also gearing phase 3 trials. real chance gradual return normalcy time next year. One could argue everyone else seems mad, might madman. 

&amp;#x200B;

With said. Me, Swede, kind get comming from. image gets painted Sweden kind disaster movie. Swedes read international papers course strange feeling, people side globe pointing disaster living through, hard feel disaster life less always. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around 5000 people died Sweden since start pandemic. 5000 large sad number. put local level (in people live) kind shows big discrepancy many Swedes feel, read. Lets take city 10 000 people example. worst pandemic hundred years struck result far 5 people dead 4 month period. Median age 82, around life expectency age town. Poor leadership. educational system failing decades now. Short-sighted, selfish ideologies emphasis short term gain expense long term. like closed borders Norway opening border Sweden.

""More like"" equal ""actually having"", thank confirming point border closed.

Besides, think there'll Norwegians island? Mate, popular vacation place mainland Swedes well. matter fly skip mainland, they're going end sharing hotels camping sites thousands mainlanders, going restrooms bars them. Norwegians spread amongst flight home. Fucking ingenious. plain fact.

You know else plain fact? many countries, foremost Israel, openly routinely interfere American politics 1000x Russia buying pro-Trump facebooks ads, countries including US interfere nations' internal affairs (Obama, Trump stooges calling president Syria Venezuela removed, Clinton blatantly hacking Russia's elections choose incompetent drunkard president Russia's darkest days).

Russia's 'interference' America's election comparison, most, drop ocean compared country's interference, wildly unpopular politics Obama-era got Trump elected. Yet still make innocent, victim angel everything bad that's happening somehow fault 'muh Russia' 'muh China'. One outside everyone wearing masks. indoors one wearing masks. huge difference two events. New York London I’m Canadian that’s true. Anyone get tested symptoms. tough spot, sure... right say get certified respirators sorry wife through! *great* considering taking steps improve welfare, even though must devatasting positon think leaving. know ton nurses usually love jobs; must heartbreaking forced choose go health safety.I hope ends better situation soon!

 strain pandemic put HCWs really terrible. FWIW many nurses Sweden also quitting and/or burning out. 1/4 HCWs working COVID Norway signs PTSD, deeply alarming Norway handled situation extremely well. problem si certainly going much worse hard hit area. Remember said summer would slow virus down? Comedians DC! smell snake oil. 

Masks dont need kill virus mask. Masks need filter virus-laden water particles. filter based electrostatic charge. u wash charge lost, hence filter function lost. 
If particles pass mask doesnt matter coated Zn oxide, bc may significant contact btw Zn oxide virus.

Hence masks basically offer protection community masks. 
I go FFP2/3 since Feb. wouldnt change habits. phone system us completely broken like 20 billion spam calls every year something crazy. never answer number don’t know. it’s exactly surprising can’t contact tracing phone. 

Another annoying thing countries used smartphone apps pretty effectively this, US epidemiologists kept saying trust them, they’re experts, new technology won’t help need people make phone calls. plan doesn’t work don’t think anybody backup plan. Media could easily ask question.

Which trust article address question.

As me, care enough research numbers spend hours phone getting answer.

If gov stopping assume reasons hear solid proof stating otherwise Upsetting. saw unfolding world cities like New York, news deaths. could largely avoided.  14 billion two doses needed per person, spread 28 days like article says. Pretty sure I'd rather outside thousands mask wearers, inside small area dozens non-wearers mean pandemic, obviously support movement think protests actually need happening, don’t believe second Well shit. Spam callers thing years government nothing stop it. don’t send text? might offer different perspective work private hospital system. scaled back clinics canceled elective surgeries put hospitals red. They’re determined ramp clinics surgeries despite rising COVID numbers order make losses incurred March May. people suffer doctors treated dispensable. don’t make nearly much money hospital administrators ones working hardest. many places, doctors taken pay cuts threatened termination don’t increase productivity isn’t even fair given many patients still afraid go hospital COVID. Hospitals drowning admissions COVID doesn’t really matter hospital administrators. care money. really abolish for-profit healthcare institutions. record NY? Like said, watched 30 seconds. think government acts force. article may help clarify. Take care
 11 days sad thing everybody would wear masks whenever they're risk would minimal could continue ""go back normal"" speak. no...masks political symbol now, FFS. Jesus, psychopathic morons abound. get 21% adds lot, 64% non covid. I'm curious 64% 5, 10 10,10,15% different things 21% telling what? authorities respective countries blame first all. could played respecting restrictions least. There's Kyle male gender, look subs xD sadly true, entirely agree you. fact constitution substantially revised since 250 years help either. look forward maximum four years hopefully we'll able normalize relations again. believe say Europe fully well know country contains great people, intelligent minds, majority population (though big majority), equally dismayed happening. would able influence elections way whatsoever, would, course us choose you. thing kinda miffs us fact choices politicians affect us too, there's precious little it.. mean three hundred odd troops stationed there? Yeah would eastern Europe without them. 

Don't forget US needs European bases project power maintain logistics middle east neighboring areas. symbiotic relation. US boots ground major deterrent invading Europe. (the old school ruskies coming kind invasion) US gets save stop areas currently vested interests. 

But lets honest, US 65000 troops here, compared combined strength union(roughly 1.6mil) threat US option joining conflict actual fighting power currently stationed deterrent. case retreating majority 65k ask US would let Europe fall give vitally important region tactically economically. near death sentence nation talking WW3 scenario. RI damn good start heard. patrols major entry-points turning around cars out-of-state plates according relative lives there. I'm sure certain essential aspects travel waved through. lasting damage*

That ship sailed. We're beginning understand long term effects. 

There decades long term health effects this. Folks living physical scars rest lives. Yes, part getting public. Right, think helped too, NY last ditch attempt height pandemic, early lockdown hundred cases.

Yes, people could honestly socially distance wouldn’t problem. Unfortunately, it’s completely unrealistic expect population economy continue social distancing measures indefinite period time. fact governments went ahead anyway irresponsible. that's true, that's good news. politicise it. means outdoor transmission preventative steps (masks) means might go bunker stop thing  effective set therapeutic protocol prevent stop cytokine storm severe symptoms. 

That part actually improved quite bit. US ranks countries like Belgium, UK, France, Ireland deaths per capita. 

You know explained passed countries per capita testing due countries getting handle virus us continuing struggle? 

The thing applies deaths. We're going pass countries per capita deaths. Yea don’t joke around said slow testing actually meant sLoW dOWn!!!! problem lot companies indulge activities much regulated EU US. EU presence, they're likely move main activity elsewhere forced. Yes, US spends 50 billion forgein ""aid money"" every year.
It goes diffrent country basicaly bribe money. Europe given mostly subsidies oil gas prices curve buying gas oil Russia. also goes country's keep stupid stuff like starting wars keeping wars. money used fill gaps budget coubtrys higher standard living gdp afford. 
Its used pay busses, education, whole slew shit. Travel bans racist US huh. would drive crazy ""Do demand!""

""No.""

""WHYYYY???""

""I interested, please leave alone""

""CRYBABYYYYY!!!!"" Also produce 7 fucking billion doses Stay mad Oh I'm sorry, thought *AMERICA* supply chains efficient, shock-proof. Remember Florida started opening it’s beaches everyone started freaking saying wait 2 weeks? two weeks came still relatively calm, people said, “look, it’s bad!” 

How long ago that? Mid-April.

So appears looking month half two month period virus really starts ramping back area. serve warning every state reopening. No, that’s one drawbacks. Relying voice calls seems big issue here. people 40 refuse answer voice call it’s known number. mean extraction profit blood working class bourgeoisie. EPCOT has, hands down, best entrance plaza music humble opinion. hope bring back science technology stuff renovations park, always favorite. Colombus landed tbh left natives alone know one meter ~39 inches. meant ""normal"" times walk stranger closer meter. No, saying America free protection service. armies severely outdated relied America way long. Since ago EU acknowledged might everyone get least 2% GDP.

IISS noted two-thirds NATO allies plans reach 2% GDP spending commitment 2024 US protested taking much burden. Well, China cock quite bit. example whole China WHO-debacle. I'm curious everything turn Netherlands. People use masks public transport. Jesus came back today dotard would want deported 🙄 it’s well founded outrage. massively outraged, anything.  Maybe news stations stop spreading stories like full scale peer reviewed study backs up. husband wife couples anecdote late nights exactly good science. USA offers sick pay coronavirus. 

It part cares act Lol you’re fuckin dumb. MD Anderson’s top research institute huge variety cancers, including birthplace immunotherapy one biggest steps forward cancer. really think they’re picking easy patients keep stats up? country turn bunch uneducated conspiracy nutcases? make believe someone would care? 
:) 
One believe first anyway.  current job put health jeopardy, quit? try find another job... different profession? 

For nurses, I'm sure find another job over, hospitals start making money again. now? seems like there's layoffs hirings. major hirings temporary, hotspots.

Another thing think of, need rainy day fund. get unemployment quit. fall somewhat confident group, get close others every 3-4 weeks buying fresh veggies. 

Also partner work home. 

We Went get sunset photos last week people everywhere hanging crowded bar patios. horrified level carelessness.  

Don’t realize isn’t them? 

They loved ones exposed whatever get exposed to. random observer passing through, can't call county's health department literally get facts firsthand? debated reddit. call ask, ""is true? Why?"" don't. elected chucklefucks, get deal consequences. Strange cause cousin works medical center says ICUs hospitals even 50%. also says numbers tend exaggerated long someone symptoms cough fever say they've came contact someone positive, book covid 19 results come usually 2-5 days, results come back negative status never changed patient told they're negative that's it. Nothing changes system far positive negative status discharge status admitted, hospital claims changed ""contact tracing"" case someone around goes hospital tests positive say person came back negative may ""asymptomatic"" test ""failed detect virus"". also says hospitals receiving government ""bonus"" money covid 19 patients. saying real, handled suspiciously. Needless say cousin happy way everything going. feels hospitals deceitful. contrast, lots midwestern states relatively easy early on, didnt take seriously enough begin with

I'd argue taken way seriously taken seriously now

Boy cried Wolfe visiting family? would considered tourists good point. Well look fancy pants CurriestGeorge able pay rent oh turntables ""Shitty golfer"" one kinder ways describe It’s probably safe assume everyone get vaccine treatment accepted widely. It’s essentially whole reason behind mask wearing. IFR set 0.5-1% quite multiple reliable studies - That's number I've quoting people asking fatality rates.

Assume 0.5-1% people get die, trending heavily towards elderly.

However, remember outcomes ""live' ""die"". People get severe risks Strokes, Lung damage, organ failure, pneumonia wonderful complications. lady get double lung transplant survive. Sure, counted ""99% living"" category, definitely want double lung transplant, means 2 people need transplants get them.

Still nothing fuck around with. contained it. Also people want products
from China US. mean people legitimately believe shit commence eye rolling. think understand video, everyone fighting? woman going resisting? subset population believe's government conspiracy well? I'm exact spot.

I came back country year half ago save could move out. Spent whole time thinking ""December. That's I'll go back. ever leave again.""

Bought ticket really cheap, hoping far enough away died down.

...Nope. knows I'll get go back /: said anything completely moving there? think anyone thinks leave Silicon Valley. rules general based mostly two factors:

Spread (no infected per 100.000)
Reciprocal (does country forbid travel EU allready?)

So basically US's choice. ;-) consistent Canada. BC live ghost town 4-6 weeks, numbers pretty good now. I've read snowbirds Ontario Quebec coming back States, follow quarantine rules, including visiting parents old age homes. done for, borders open. many homes air conditioning common areas particularly big problem despite importance physical distance, Tegnell say anything air conditioning. think that's good. sit distance always time, says.


Sweden, PLEASE fire guy already? FFS ridiculously ignorant best. There's literally data *for virus* spread worsened indoors air conditioning used: 

Otherwise, interesting see systemic problem. Sweden infrastructure suited cooler climate. last years, temperatures much warmer average, excess heat + ill adapted infrastructure caused heat deaths elder care. Although work done improve infrastructure, enough article states focuses cooling common areas. course quite bad thing pandemic. Hopefully summer stays relatively cool, heatwave coming week. conditions could unfortunately help spread disease elder care. look data I’m worried. 🤷‍♂️ Even destined catch I'd rather ""catch it"" later risk factors defined effective treatments developed, spend rest life possible lung damage chronic fatigue.

Sure although we're ""destined die"" I'd rather die 60 years rather month, investment months excessive caution right far worth 60 years life health. got 26 hospitals 1.3 million people former Florida DOH employee disease control tell they've fudging numbers day one. keep lying want long actual ICU hospital beds available. ICU beds run likely catastrophic situation hands can't sweep rug. Lol ok. Sorry, every aspect government don’t like bad (BAD!). way life zero drawbacks! Fixed, continue living black white thinking :) get economy suffering, waiting/quarantining couple months, hurt waiting another month two reopen. ☹️🙄 (posts bunch links blogs one reads)

(random YouTube video)

Plandemic dude. Look up. corner NYC, it’s 60% - 70% wearing masks (correctly). MAGA neighborhood. sad. European HQ companies PayPal, LinkedIn big tech companies already Ireland don’t need move much. you’re forced house go job could done remotely? We're together. Right? RIGHT? least told. friend buying 2 bottles Everclear time find hand sanitizer anywhere. unfortunate thing Abbot challenged GOP members reached authority. news trying sue open here? want spread misinformation, go Oh, NO!

People still flying melbourne Sydney Premiers closed borders.

The people NSW end paying incompetence NSW government.

Everything we’ve endured naught end forced back lock selfish infected Victorians bring community transmission back NSW. 

I can’t express properly angry moment situation. First BLM protesters selfishly risking community, situation developing. 

#LockTheBorder Probably good idea, nobody really traveling internationally right regardless. least one notable film crew(James Cameron, iirc) let in. got money agreed hotel quarentine beforehand. think misunderstand constitution. grew steady diet Hollywood American Exceptionalism. remind obnoxious freedumb protests had. Florida def giving go. Yeah, one hand...I love traveling Europe sad. other, totally understand wanting ban U.S. citizens hope put pressure U.S. government stop acting like idiots.

I wonder like live country charge make decisions based what's good citizenry... Especially couple cases slip boarder last week. means expert, read matter long somewhere along lines 65% 70% population gets vaccine, herd immunity pretty easy accomplish. even not, people want get vaccinated, deal risks illness. pandemic though less people potential get it. people might get scared straight witness close relatives friends deal bad case this. vaccine still best case scenario many months away, time better public awareness. shall see. economic crisis, public health crisis. Babies young children generally can’t wear masks... See kind attitude actually contributes death toll globally, able objectively view what's happening China learn works doesn't. already fucing quarantines place.

America whole bungled response bad speak myself, I'm getting little $700 per week (roughly $2900 per month), based previous income around $400 per week taxes. hair needed look good open casket, supposed do? Lowest transmission rate country right deaths hospitalizations way - New England general pretty good mean Germany. Beaches nice I’m interested historic architecture, beautiful countryside, etc. 

I actually went Italy last year blown away culture food, layover Munich way back really sold me. 

After leaving chaos Italy seeing perfect little rows city sky decent town made feel warm inside. 

I pass customs agent person friendly. Joking asking trip was. 

It harsh reminder landing back Detroit nobody cares here. overheard customs people making fun someone’s accent way in. 

I can’t imagine wouldn’t appreciate time effort takes someone learn language... make fun it? 

Like said, fully accept EU wouldn’t want Americans come visit. worst. think things changing here. sure hope are. protests inspiring hope me. Definitely need something stronger beer survive disheartening bullshit..... Adios American here: don’t blame one bit. May Europe swift unimpeded recovery. made bed. r0 gets low enough due sensible restrictions (see AU &amp; NZ) numbers fall Yes one active case infect many, that's contact tracing important. really. especially vulnerable means spread readily. especially depending conditions like example theyre working close proximity together. theres difference saying theyre fault saying theyre spreading intentionally. doubt anyone sub able grasp though. actually, never even used phrase ""at fault"". leftist spin. find pretty scummy disingenious congresspeople demanding apology ""inaccurate statements"" although theyve offered nothing suggest statements untrue. thinking today, wonder firework shows across nation going toned down. City budgets getting slashed, seem like best time burn things entertainment. say celebrate day. country floridastan? blame them. blame incompetent leaders, though. don’t think they’re necessarily wrong. see vision?  Western Canada here. mask outdoors it’s super crowded walk isn’t social distancing possible.

Then again, 13 new cases province 5 million - that’s high end last bit. thinks handle it. See, build life truths misconceptions lies. send thoughts prayers way darling. Yes, I'm nurse. Last hair cut December. dealt state calmed down. Even went usual salon *very* strict number employees/customers, mask wearing, cleaning, social distancing. even paid via cash app avoid touching things. guess I’ll never chance visit Europe. I'm comment like it. me? know like? Men won’t fuck condom “it doesn’t feel good” fucking partners without regard self protection disease unwanted pregnancies.  act impulse instinct like goddamn animals. busy working new scheme rig 2020 election considered people household would affect things. may bigger reason things mentioned. Look obese are, don’t even care health. Maybe that’s virus problem America. 2 days enough trend, they're going allow/disallow travel day-by-day basis.

Also estimates probably taking account protests across country well states removed almost restrictions. 

Give couple weeks see figures change policy reevaluated. means it’s looking like places, urban counties states like Texas, Arizona, Florida, could soon outbreaks bad seen New York Massachusetts April. NYC, worst-hit place US far, 1 every 400 people died covid end March now. numbers seem heading direction places country, bad. hope something changes. certainly incredible method works, since one infected slips away infect hundreds month. South Korea quarantined since pandemic begab right? What's death toll?? OPEN GATE

CLOSE GATE upside never leaving first wave... Texas FUCKED. people still eating without masks social distancing... ones following protocol fast food joints. Sad I'm point feel HIPAA laws hurting people helping them. Everyone needs see this. Don’t feel bad. deserve it.   worst President we’ve ever had. I've wondering thing. think have.

Honestly, thanks posting comment. come see going states state getting ready take foot brakes go full throttle soon.  Amen we're not.

We're divided Civil War. remember watching China's response thinking ""no way anyone else could get away boarding people homes"". mean, putting plywood chains forcibly keep people homes gun point? country could get away that? one smart chimp wrong though? mean honestly. appreciate woman didnt outright condemn rather asked see data based statements of. margin error conjecture? even need job lined up. need experience education. Also, straight permanent residency, bullshit whether government company change mind (see Trump done last 48 bringing 350,000 people year plan scale up.

#/S shit take us 2 generations least better genetic immunity. keep killing people maiming them, increased cardiorespiratory damage time get “COVID Cold”. Yes grocery stores people wear masks. places, much. People liquor stores, gas stations, fast food workers, pizza places, etc pretty awful comes wearing masks. protests people mixing, shouting, crying, hugging Orangemanbad's fault? introvert staying home along. However even leave house time time reduced absolute minimum. luxuroy able work full time job home, exception sadly. people absolutely work outside safezone? 

Not working might option rich many people close poverty line can't afford this. limited public exposure every 3-4 weeks, order food necessary hygiene products online never went restatraunt anyway. said way texas handles reckless without clear laws support government able work many people ignore advice risk lives others. Engle said patients waited five six days results, two three days May.

Which means exploding numbers we're seeing actually 2 weeks behind person infected.

It'll show importance masks deterrent. hope Canada keeps Americans too. enough issue citizens idiots covid. Last thing need ignorance/arrogance running around. Taiwan ""series"" benevolent dictators. one man basically infiltrated ruling party, got charge, turned country democracy. Well, shit. brainer. would idiotic allowed. read really carefully, pretty hard understand, *they're virus*. appreciate post details contained within (the general overview may aware of, individual numerical figures mentioned, course), wanted clarify one point. know sorts discussions online subreddit surrounding different types masks people seen public featured news clips wearing manner different masks different variations material, homemade masks, etc. referring ""masks"" general sense ones wear, meant exclusively refer ""proper"" N95 masks since kind procured wear exclusively.

As non-covid positive person, I'm still fine primarily protecting people designed so, mind even ratio 99.5% protection others extra 0.5% layer protection (obviously random example figures), extra 0.5% safety still worth even wholly selfish perspective.

I'm sure though cotton masks referring N95 assorted makeshift ones? Funding? paid $175 test, free tests? Trump called Racist imposed travel ban china. racist now? Charles Michel? Angela Merkel?

I support travel ban imposed country people countries still viruses. That's fucking insane. Simply fucking insane. They're going digging mass graves. Remember wore gas mask senate joke. It’s like everyone forgot exponential growth bet what? Seoul NYC 2 3 weeks? cases go states reopened? thats already happening states, ones gonna bet that. incredibly smart difficult decision. Well, ""good"" news used people used warned never go hospital / surgery around Fourth July, new medical students started rotations. fortunately moved everyone floors spring, least that's one thing going us! tired winning much point don’t think you’ll option go October America lost 2 buildings 911, compare Dresden, Berlin, London, Stalingrad, Minsk...  deal absolutes everything political issue

It's people think earth 6,000 years old global warming giant hoax. talking theoretical things like anti-science view much impact life short term. virus really care believe not. hahahahha holy crap. Almost every state within margin error polls, best time every get voice heard - especially state local elections. Oh no. hate us? do? Or: sick, none got tested. Oh yeah totally, whichever company successfully pulls deserves sure. kidding me? repeatedly commenting exact comment sub first. quite good. Check stickied daily update best info. true comment auto delete? sub hammers everytime try spit truth. undertakers doing? Probably China flinch much Trump makes threats. China around thousands years even given choice, get tested, absolute insanity. dont know man. rules rules, rules apply us.

If become business owner start writing several things gate. start getting tax breaks start employing people, providing health care, matching 401k. also incentivized tax breaks donate money charitable. 

People like bezos radically transformed humanity.

I understand saying, think mostly human nature selfish, greedy rather particular set rules laws. rules rules, want warp, pervert twist donating charity's funnel money back corporation hold somebody else's name, profiting indirectly, really matter rules piece shit human.

In perfect world everybody would really nice look one another, fourth, who's say perfect world really is? perfect world relation what?

In physics uncommon use model exist vacuum reference real world calculations. models created vacuum could never exist real world variables inside vacuum. 

Maybe I'm arguing sake arguing disagreeable. again, that's human nature. We're ""perfect"" chemistry different, who's say us would even exist? I’m permanent resident Korea. provide negative test get plane back Korea. permanent resident Korea Korean blood exempt rule. really understand policy might considered racist?

And policy apply citizens. least get facts straight. Yeah even began animal trials.  different weeks ago? can't economy without healthy functioning society. things important money, like actual human lives, I'm fucking tired people prioritizing rich old white dudes making money based feel old white dudes' future earnings. He’ll leave governor per usual blame ever way choose. It’s lose lose them. states like week. cause death, get desired outcome. Try choke entitled flavored coffee toooo much.  **SARS**-CoV-**2** virus causes Covid-19. “SARS” actually called **SARS**-CoV. SARS 2 shorthand SARS-CoV-2. indeed works. Hispanic *overwhelmingly* Hispanic? Stay away Texans greatest extent possible. Libya Ratios always telling raw numbers. Would mind checking positive results % tests first? second this. murder officer forced defend himself. hope restrictions lift December year, there's chance won't. Depends happens next months, hopefully, Trump gets voted out, might able start good relations EU again. |: else could expected mass protesting rioting? Wrong. Lies. Corona aside, infuriating set speeches watch. realize dexamethasone already use US hospitals COIVD19 (based University Oxford study 1 week ago?) I'm glad hear it.

But yea, study said save 1/3 people ventilators. Good news, unfortunately cure.  400 cases 17000 tested MN

Source 6 rally. 

The rally couple days ago, rallygoers almost certainly less likely get tested, based reluctance wear masks. Yes, ""more less same"" exaggeration part. Lots changed many peoples lifes, sure, spectrum way pure boredom caused social distancing, example, deaths severe sickness worst cases. problem even lockdowns restrictions worked fantastically, like South Korea, still soon say whether count much pandemic going continue least next 9 months easily 18 months. 

The countries locked early face first wave like India already proof terrible potential lockdowns. Realistically, countries world like South Korea like India? guy fucking moron, thinks tell live another post lol 😆 

You're fighting losing battle. Well, pointing marginal impact covid statistics justifying policy puts freedom movement freedom gathering human lifes. idea personal opinion is, letting know post comes offering different perspective. ability social distance wear mask nothing race. Tell South Korea. 

Looks like quite bit less ""half"" Dude get sentiment berate people like that. significant percentage population Texas disagrees happening strategy, one elected current politicians based covid attack strategy. Also, one argue plenty people new york, left-leaning young professionals, disagreed locking thought death rate acceptable keep economy going. two close friends NY, said many times left leaning classic new Yorkers. Europe isn’t EU. Knock off. use wrong statistic you. pretends pro life lets keep guns that’s literally care about. Looks like riding first wave 2021. Thanks, American exceptionalism. Ok — except Europe isn’t EU. stop it. god damn thread got rolling Maybe western countries US doesn’t care least current administration doesn’t care citizens care making money rich friends Oxford already started Phase 3 trials many countries including Brazil, here's hoping data positive nightmare start end year does. efficiency counter shock-proof.

Just Time relies previous next step ready perfect. Even virus died normal high heat (which... doesn't), we're currently *below human body temperature*. able survive 98F, probably significantly higher else fever would kill dead. shocker society people willing participate minor inconvenience safety others themselves. point wearing one infected... eager leave US while. fucking difficult able move another country, though, without specialized skills bonus. 

That said currently business, ties ways course, business EU, exporting product distributor there. I'm strongly considering establishing office get US basically representative European business there. I'd still need travel US frequently, yeah. Perhaps someday I'd move manufacturing EU US, would tough. 

This would COVID obviously fear going one thing another rest lifetime. US broken. make use vacation day sick day, sick day. that's way 3 main jobs I've lifetime US. wrong. testing everyone wants get tested area. spreading FUD purpose passing people off. We're #1! *cries* downsides authoritarianism much worse upsides, inevitable, instead occasional. entirely predictable too. genuinely curious see happens. wonder many Americans gotten bored Corina response continue ignore even death toll increases. Anyone get tested, long willing wait line. waited 3.5 hours I’m convinced two strands

You mean strains? Maybe people saw thousands people protesting rioting looting thought ""if people stop self quarantining maybe too?"" 
Maybe dgaf. Even comes China, bet require FDA approval. Murder. 26% covid cases though.   that's third-world-country-levels bad. hunt specifically underdeveloped countries bad testing plans find country that's bad Arizona right now. Fucking Oman 20% positive rate. better Afghanistan Haiti couple others think maybe reporting testing well like Ecuador. god, awful. A) far know still stands. Unless proven otherwise, clean. 

B) sure DUI forbidden caught wasted driving, punished. forbid walking outside without mask infected that's problem.

Driving ok, harm anyone. Walking outside without mask same. need special circumstances become dangerous. even rambling kiddo? form coherent thoughts? know that, thank you. changed it, still deleted. guess next step contacting mods. Ladies (or anyone long hair) work person, washing hair every day? Anyone sources long virus lives hair? professional sports get ton taxpayer/government money? think that's we're talking here. I'm NY, honestly I'm 100% favor it. states acting like morons. 

It's 100% completely unconstitutional course, seem stop us days... author apparently business owner, epidemiologist kind scientist. It’s roughly 4 months half million people died, insignificant number. still long ways go pandemic over, don’t know many die severely affected it’s finally “over”. 

The guy essentially saying things haven’t gotten bad yet (lol) nations went lockdown fare differently Sweden (lol, Sweden higher per capita death rate US). BC schools open optional class learning since June 1, kindergarten full-time, oldest high school kids one day week (which believe opposite many places)

The number cases per day BC averaged maybe 15 day last month Nah smarter people believe science. always wear seatbelt. didn’t would fall seat drift around corner sideways Stonks go up. Bbbbrrrr people hardest hit even see coming. like trolley problem except people tied tracks believe say train coming struggle kick away try untie them. know train slices two last breath ""help... me..."" gotta something train even arrives, even spit face call ethnic slurs it. Given big enough group persons general yes. perfectly normal behavior. virus continuing double every days number new deaths continuously really ends working end. Goodluck grad school, it’s gonna awesome! one calculate numbers magnitude! literally least could fucking do.

Stay fuck home want show basic decency people around you. Add fact good number rides indoor Disney. come around. I'm talking them. Doesn’t seem match colleagues suburban Toronto say And, would much pleasant look at. many enough you? is. best vote alas.. Yeah, decades austerity (perpetraed parties office late) tend healthcare system. true strain years. would reason try hard could suppress spread disease, putting severe strain already fragile health systems. he's right tho Hopefully state people don’t see invitation visit bring virus here... suck, let's remember Texas boatload population now. mean orders *overrrode* local government tried right thing?

Abbot is... I'll charitable say he's moron. drooling idiot. alternative pretty vile. first all, aren’t paranoid, you’re taking precautions feels right you.
mental health really difficult look time. friends willing - know might best terms rn - maybe call one them, netflix session, binge favourite show, let go breathe meditate. Spanish flu lasted 3 years. 

In 2020, half world losing minds 4 months. America 3rd world country, 4th world country. Truly worst humanity. confused saw friends hanging back Houston. thinking?? Unfortunately, unlike everything else America, politicized. Abbott, Patrick, Paxton; Texas Triumvirate Terror, likely remembered killing Texans several wars. 

Your vote matters. Still p value great oucome larger study I'll take 5400 new cases yesterday Texas. remember haring Florida 3000 thinking screwed.  

But I'm sure we're gonna fine. ^^probably ^^not. Nobody masks Trump rally protests. might stupid thing I've read today.  Jesus, 3/4 got sick? I’m sorry really hope recover quickly guy shamed coming back Monday feeling sick.
Was far know able stay home issue worrying job?
Doesn’t change spread it’s worry upcoming school year supposed stay home ten days *any* symptom, teachers students, (if return building), hell work someone gets sore throat cough allergies something mild ten days? None us get unlimited PTO (13 days) don’t endless substitutes worry people go work sick fear job loss. outbreaks again. clear. germans knew that.

They capabilities monitor situation according parameters decide enforce local restrictions.

The germans knew that.

Substitute germans spaniards, italians, french. know outbreaks outbreak big form restrictions while. necessarily hard lockdown.

So alternative? Let 65+ die nursing homes refusing give ICU bed? test? Go herd immunity virus might cause long lasting immunity? Yeah system broke. checks balances anymore goal destroy system checks balances get long term power one party represent people. Here's map US counties, coded per capita COVID deaths:

 You’re right. That’s *fault* entirely.. ever real example ""herd immunity"" without vaccine? Drove California weekend stay parents wife stays her. We’re sure long we’re going here, thx Ducey. Good, fuck people, I'm tired shit. Typical boomer thought process hospital put adds? Show people covid put stats So, goes well, Oxford vaccine tail end year relatively short-lived emergency vaccine unlock world, time next year get inactivated virus vaccine (still probably longest lasting terms immunity) really solve problem sustainable way. Murder, probably? hands police? Flatten curve making vertical line straight upwards. Outstanding move. 

Americans fucking selfish. Fuck anything anyone else inconveniences slightish, wearing mask. said actually feeling safer there, places he's whole time. That's impressive, sounds like actually decent system! want it. inconvenient, keep thinking time left home. general huge problem someone orders do, think wear Considering net effects Brexit, great boost integration European Union member states. Every company gives sick pay Masks don’t prevent virus all. article scare tactics. Militias Michigan would like word Also, U.S.’s disintegrating relationship China hurt ability get Chinese vaccine? DISboards? I've meaning get see petition received. always fascinating look different demo views pandemic. Cancer Treatment Centers America

Sorry, I'm researcher things. time, one does. find interesting I'm called moron b/c know ""Cancer Treatment Centers America"" bad ""Cancer Treatment Center Houston"" good. cotton sheet they're talking 600 thread count cotton available yard. available sheets. literally bought set sheets cut up. (They're gorgeous woven navy stripe. Making first cut hard. gotten size fit bed, I'm sure could done it. ordered size have.)

I make one addition design. fabric I'm using apparently stiff Halyard fabric, put crossbrace keep fabric nostrils breathe in. So, spreads isolated cities less densely populated areas. isolation look manaus Brazil. low density look Texas right now. Incorrect. big delay, deaths still going places like NY/NJ/MI. Three months ago even 2 months ago, *no testing* unless already sick hospital admittance required.  protests going almost .k th point going surge would've happened. Yet entirety Northeast still trending significantly despite huge number protesta regularly occurring. 

One biggest factors COVID-19 transmission time exposure. individual exposed virus 5 minutes going get viral load somekne exposes 2 hours may even trigger immune system response virus cannot make beachhead body. outdoors air constantly moving, fresh air brought in, heat reduces efficacy virus results far lower transmission. Likewise, wearing mask prevents virus even entering air first place results far lower transmission. Combine two get scenario odds catching low basically negligible.  “lab” setting. wait amp 5g mutate antibodies turn us liberals. :( I’m sorry. imagine really tough time celebrating marriage. Vacations honeymoons aren’t gonna while. hope two make best whatever decide do. least ❤️❤️❤️ Don’t feel like we’ve hit peak TX yet It’s frustrating. taken seriously we’d likely behind us. Instead, we’re back square 1 worse place 3 months ago masks become politicized. Also, Texas actually 2 week downward trend new cases reopening phase reopening think we’d better situation. demands. science name controlling disease. disease kills people. listen understand arguements opening closing economy might better worse virus wearing make baseline. like teacher asks pay attention class goofing off. crying it. impacting people around reason dont feel like it. Freedoms important responsibilities. arguement boils ""I like it"". Classic baby shit. Yet somehow, even though predictable outcome laid front us, likely repeat something could prevent listen medical professionals. Logan's Run, Well played sir, well played. ""*Houston*, *you problem*"" wanna guy collectively fault electing government, like Trump administration metabolised thin air Mattis technically correct; like Bolton, care hear word fool mouth testifies Congress! Yeah, that's Fed started firehose-ing money system back March. Corporate bonds overleveraged + commercial real estate crash volatile situation. Remains seen make lack fo revenues credit. Better dumb dead. Look ICU Delirium ICU Psychosis. terrible thing. power corporate lobbyists. ones pushing bullshit fucking everything up. anti education

At point admit they've get better least generation two generate monumental change today. national problems caused political incompetence straight corruption traced crap education.

Teachers paid pittance. Extracurricular programs cut ""save money"". Districts need save money because, lost corruption, funding increase way many people think pay increased taxes public school system whatever reason.

Anti-science/intellectuals voting in-power would take monumental change get fix education US. 

We're well way Idiocracy already. vote, expect things get much better lifetime. Beatings continue morale improves Yep central taxes totally business usual. reopened fast Gov took rights away local mayors enforce anything. Bars jam packed first night opening. genuinely appreciate Putting deaths perspective easy happens someone love realize could avoided appropriate measures. people keep posting name Jim? :/ #Translation:

Lack intensive care facilities forces Jönköping Region make risky helicopter transports seriously ill patients parts country, reports P4 Jönköping. far, two nine patients relocated died.

- Transport outside intensive care unit dangerous thing do, says Catarina Alkemark, intensive care nurse county hospital Ryhov.

The county reduced number intensive care places four Jönköping two Värnamo well temporary place Eksjö. Correct. 

We've seen - decent people act figureheads trump whatever wants behind scenes, would removed otherwise. eventually removed point anyway, too. Sweden testing low numbers 

Sweden much deaths per capita People lockdown forever.

If lockdown gets time gets action take stop it. probably wishes people would choose lock down, without mandate make look bad half constituents. problem many people either unwilling (stupidity) unable (financially) quarantine properly socially distance without forced them.  

And forced lockdowns, state/government also responsibility take care people unemployed wills... voluntary lockdowns, state say ""Sorry cant afford keep business Mr. Small Business Owner, choice close down. didnt force you."" Ah, gotcha. Yeah, I'd huge liar said Sweden's great testing since day 1, mainly judge trend time number deaths per day, particularly comparison mortality rate. number deaths per day decreasing time, means either fewer cases, tested untested, they're getting better keeping people alive. Sweden nowhere near diverse sense word. It’s good comparison. temporary make miraculously ok, right convenient. two areas Ontario mandated masks, posting history indicates live either them. Well might well face reality. get sooner later. real controls commitment general public, matter time. mean China order attack India troops.

Those two populated countries world. ingredients beginning. go New York Times article article based , says US EU’s draft list banned countries. course report way freak everyone out... don’t believe everything read. Verify first. posted NYT article instead. That's problem lagging indicators. time start paying attention then, late. red head blonde roots here. Lol stylist would take precautions I’m looking awesome. great stylist cares! mean? know what, fair enough. I'll give credit disclaimer added in. 

I commenting EU domestic affairs since I'm citizen. can't see EU dying anytime soon though. Everything place already covid-19 must continue place gets hot. like measures prepared gets hot place, says. can. one stopping moving yourself, want go get, nothing impossible always follow dreams. Enjoy gold star friend. :) PM'ed :) good news, source? I'm glad Roy Cooper actually right thing too. breakthrough. get wrong, damn important.

But started trials animals prove feasibility. peer review. testing. Reliability testing. Peer review. human trials.

Atleast 2021, successful. country deserves credit world Taiwan think, Europe probably Czech Republic. 
NZ well, easier since quite low populationdensity compare Taiwan. research study say antibodies produced virus last 3 months? VS yours? Lmao. Try peeing angle people start feel wearing pants public spaces infringes rights?

I’m even kidding, could get board this. I’ve working home 3 months. really think go back wearing real pants this?! also ignored rest comment. 

What downside wearing mask minor inconvenience? get want actual reason. Please try use personal attacks. 

I seen *talk*, yes. action, *talk* however. Especially, pointed out, *talk* tests went quite long time improvement made. acknowledge improvement made testing, glad it. remains far short 100k/week promised. hold breath anymore promises made Swedish authorities followed through. Yes. Nope, testing increasing steadily. DeSantis like fucking ostrich sticking head sand. truly loathe voting populations here. Rick Scott, DeSantis, probably whole shitload know since used politics. Nah, he’d said “Yinz fuckin jagoffs“ clear support journalists interested whole truth Wear mask everywhere go out, tell people wearing one **you care people around you**. Plenty people take stance they're worried need mask, make seem like assholes wear masks care people around them, may shift viewpoint.

In addition social distancing, handwashing, etc. It’s really sad states could learned NY, states bad avoided together. would free clear made choice early. willful ignorance appalling. instead suffer longer bigger financial impact sure. can’t believe somehow managed keep virus poorest dysfunctional portions Philly. taken root places like Kensington, would overwhelmed every hospital southeast corner state. 🙄 would assume that, good reason numbers there, simply there. I've following since February. 

When people whined back March April beaches opened wind, etc...I disagreed. thought anti-lockdown protest would lead spread, protests started heart ached disagreed thought surely would see cases. 

But facts facts cases materializing events materialize situation salon two workers wore mask. outside reduces spread, wearing masks reduces spread.

You hurl insults want change facts. Texas getting hit hard states not? state almost completely opened back month ago still dropping cases. makes Texas bad? Haha real antibodies won’t work fake virus. cancer centers b/c pick ""easy"" cancers treat, make big money high success rate. think BS.

This true, many cancer centers, like MD Anderson, non-profit research hospitals treat hard-to-treat cancers. That's one reason rated best, among best. 

""Rankings"" differentiated type cancer, like place pick best patients genuinely claim better success rate cancers. Cancer Treatment Centers America got trouble exactly that, kind organization describing (cherry-picking ""profitable"" patients charging insurance huge markup). protestors wearing masks least. cant see making idea “anti-mask” patriotic worse? likely overrun, even ER admissions skyrocket. lesson NY - hospitals really good making room. chaotic battlefield-style zones. unfortunately lesson New York. wierd people Texas. small group takes seriously, another group acts like take seriously start bitching cant eat out, get nails done, get fucking haircut group straight ""fuck you"" dont want get sick go outside"" ""fuck family broke dont anyone take care kids"". Update, one employee carrying around mask today. prodded bit saying, ""Hey mask much good hands!"" glared put on. 1 down, 49 go. Yeah many people shot site last month, even burning looting cities rigjt front police wearing masks. Please, police commended restraint face insanity unfolded forced stand take rocks, bottles molotov coctails. 950 officers injured, many seriously killed. One NYPD cop run like dog street video. Yet black people ""shot sight"" actually justifying this? sources are....?

The mask double purpose, catch particles exhaled sick filter air healthy breathing. thats American way. Us rich folk need common folk keep going work regardless risks claim hard work secure $350k performance bonus end year. 

Im person. virus spreading. Second wave? Sweden's first wave stop? bad ones make legit ones suspect. is. live land scams. We've cusp cure cancer, also teeth spray prevents cavities, decades. around corner hear. shows 31% general hospital beds, ICU. isn’t thing? video made hometown Mattis retired. Mask usage incredibly low, impossible get people use despite region COVID hotspot. unable move next stage re-opening, folks real cranky it. Hopefully new statewide mask mandate things get better soon. 

I picture near future citizen Blue Lives Matter shirt getting ticket mask-less. hope someone videos it. No, like drunk Brits Magaluf places like that. fucking crazy right. disappointed citizens country way everything handled make better one. Americans. Regrow balls Americans. much reopening. CA poster child proper handling pandemic first hit there. California. Newsom took action early Santa Clara County early hot spot seeing less 50 new cases day now. that's believe north 5million people. idiots overhear saying trampling rights ruining small businesses... come one comments people contracting virus protests riots. “family gatherings” “bars restaurants?”


They trying lock people again. fits narrative. Lock down, crash market make trump look bad. lock state parks protests. 

I don’t practice politics vote, cmon people need open eyes. government parties battling without care people. agendas pawns game. feel affects this. Rich, Poor, Gay, Straight, Black, White whatever. 

I’m really confused going think terrible. 

Best luck everyone! Sure happens Sweden's actions slow spread. lot people work home, study home, free time activites vacations cancelled. People spending time home combined economical stress whats causing this.

Yes, that's said. increase domestic violence would probably even greater would total lock Sweden.

We can't know sure. interesting Finland decline child abuse anyway linked inanother comment. Denmark, domestic abuse increase (don't source hand def. recall reading it). 

It interesting compare data region becomes available, compared Finland decrease child abuse reports (which increase kids went back school) intersting Finland tougher NPI measures Sweden. Reddit voting factual statement right move. Right can't trust country that's going 2nd peak whose president threatens reduce testing world keep kids apart? looking answer. can't imagine. second time week someone mentions weird conspiracy theory.

SOURCES: make seem way complicated, people bother.

That's entire reason arguments put Now? We're good military force, arresting people, making rich richer, getting fat, producing media, claiming best.

Last time US best anything bullshit survey made 1988 using Philistine Factor Yawn Index bullshit criteria excuses rate countries lower claim best quality life. true then, true now. Well mostly joke first off, second replying “cause they’re old” comment insinuated bald people = old people. disclaimer comment, simply wanted point balding bald old wanted gesture, fun type way. 

Yeesh way people take literally comment pick complaint (self aware included) blows mind. I'm American living Japan big news recently two consecutive days 40 cases across entire country 135+ million people. response back home awful beyond comprehension. Sundays 11-2pm Good. Maybe Trump listen since rich people gonna pissed cant travel abroad. Restaurants barely surviving days, maybe go easy people going dinner too. wait much longer economy reopen. Today 3rd highest number new confirmed cases coronavirus infections US, far, according world meters.  Depends infection rate population.

The people get infected, faster see difference received vaccine control group.

Since Brazil high infection rate, would speed results. know fellow tax paying citizens hold Federal govt accountable. way going taken serious. methods available. hear you. It’s complicated. understand want stop spread keep new cases don’t blame that. create complications people though. 

As expat aren’t permanent resident country 3 months graduating losing job enroll school get new job. course it’s difficult get work sponsorship Europe non EU citizen put citizens first should. 3 months though aren’t back school employed, long term resident permit expires. guess American could stay additional 3 months passport (you’re allowed 90 days every 6 months Schengen US citizen) I’m really sure time already spent Schengen long term resident permit counts towards 3 months every 6 months get passport not. 

3 months isn’t much time find new job, especially COVID19 circumstances. guess people deal though. I’m open borders believe countries right whatever want comes allowing allowing people aren’t citizens even screws people. Even person getting screwed kid. true patriot licks door knobs. War Drugs. War Personal Freedom is, okay? Keep mind times. Thank you. Well, guns simply show. hunting. significant number eventually used kill owner someone owner loves. significantly smaller portion used self defense.  People want reason go outside M. Osterholm Center Infectious Disease Response, nutshell, says count vaccine anytime soon. 60 -70% herd immunity likely. AIDS hit 80's, experts said they'd vaccine later 3 years. Still waiting.

EDIT: Hate comment want, Since beginning CID-RAP laying expect WEEKS got sanitized version network tv proven true. check Lol guys would starve without America. Good luck. though small scale, it’s happening Central Washington right now. Yakima capacity area sending patients across Cascades Seattle. 

The farm workers getting brutalized right now, seems spreading rural areas way. That’s model things come rest nation, considering Washington epicenter outbreak, New York close it’s heels. America about.

America *opens history book* 

uh oh 

*Frantically starts flipping though pages* 

uh oh. oh no. no. uh oh Table 1 compare genomic UV254 characteristics SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-19) coronaviruses viruses similar nucleic acid composition. first three coronaviruses cause disease humans. Studies MHV EtoV found similar values D37s (36,39). Therefore, reasonable estimate D37s SARSs MERS-CoV viruses would 3.0 J/m2. Comparison ssRNA viruses yields similar D37 value. Since influenza genomes 2.2 times shorter coronaviruses, reasonable coronaviruses (larger UV targets) would least twice sensitive UVC; reciprocal ratio genome sizes times D37 influenza viruses yields estimated D37 SARS-CoV-2 4.7 J/m2.

Excerpt main results section article. instead actually experiments, compare generalized genomic characteristics SARS-CoV-2 viruses UV light experiments produced data extrapolate virus may respond UV light. surprised article published weeks ago made splash mainstream. know country father is. expat lost job pandemy, still stay look job temporary residence country. Problem father register residence country. blame government anyone else, since father resident there, also pay income tax. Who's silly now? Texas constitution end Reconstruction Era constitution. ruled military governor made executive weak. America. anything medicine doomed fail. makes feel better. Thank you. Considering shit show much NYC been, feeling pretty hopeless tourists coming causing cases. thought whole country was. guess not. Shithole country going stationed abroad. say every day... true every day :( know lol. Trump lies constantly

My local CVS pharmacy actually providing free tests anybody. need schedule time get one. definitely become accessible. Im rural area  yep- new article Nature week

&amp;#x200B;

 Exactly. frustrating trying explain risk reduction. know many ways define this. I’m using inflection points graph

But I’m taking mathematical view, focusing death totals. Death totals decreasing week week quite time, weekend looks like bottomed we’ll week week increases time. Mathematically downside first wave today (for deaths). 

Cases started upswing second wave couple weeks ago, going argue cases alone weren’t strong indicator. cases deaths rising, we’re heading new curve exponential curve we’ll need flatten. madness. feel like hope American. news people going massive gatherings president trying stop people getting tested wearing mask, international community thing save us. welcome harsh sanctions leaders can’t go ignoring it. Right, original comment, thinking comments IRL seen/heard how—when NY surging—(insert-area-here) would *never* get surge like didn’t public transportation like NYC.

Hopefully NYC prove public transportation US safe appropriate measures! would news Texas cause stock market crash governors saying going back March/April level lockdowns considering testing capacity way higher except places hospitalizations charts. example California also record new cases hospitalization still terrible. assuming younger population one affected careless post opening economy(plus protests factor well). 

That said hit market Q2 earnings start next month. Numbers terrible sure since Q2 lockdown. would big factor sure. wouldn’t think money would matter point.. loved ones can’t imagine pain many families gone through, 400000 people died.. people loved died alone isolation doctors nurses wearing full PPE able even comfort people final hours. hope doctors nurses deal cases like this, least form mental health checkups since also traumatized, doubt. Yes, yes could have. [US done 

So, yeah... US competent leadership functioning government, could nipped bud like SARS 

Or least saved 10s thousands lives (so far) listen CDC Government experts. 

Stop living bubble US victim happenstance. could prevented failed, dragging entire world economic meltdown can’t stop failing. “America, bad” much easier say! Nuance lost. right!? can't believe he's stupid. Authoritarians feather... I'd trade desantis could get Whitmer Cuomo

You're looking results start thing, Michigan New York states starting get shit control. They're getting widespread community outbreak North Eastern states got. population inevitable, took longer kick off. let keep slaves? Nah, Union's mistake Sherman go far enough. Well, sucks. hoping see boyfriend sometime year. :[ live Chicago pretty much everyone taking seriously. took kid far suburb go hiking coming preserve moved onto grass distance couple. hear guy fake hacking start uproariously laughing. pretty much time left city last months got laughed social distancing, fucking crazy. see declaring war country Europe Twitter  got parking lot tested hospital outpatient procedure. Think took day half call negative result. I'm New England though. I'm hoping gets cancelled point get money back.

Good luck that, wife &amp; gonna go honey moon Italy late March. Flights got canceled, refund site. vouchers expire jan 2021. largely regional. Areas country deliberate re-open plans seem well. Areas country rushed get economy back open quickly possible really struggling. infected spread virus right, could take years. think people gonna put restrictions long? Yeah, that’s probably best. I’m American certainly don’t want around Americans foreseeable future. said all. one else did. seems absolutely, unequivocally false. official position process visas safe countries, would said that. Considering 1200 acceptances sent Americans today teaching program starts September, believe capacity France intends process visas based safety country, otherwise would scrapped teaching program American participants. Ditto I’d put Spain somewhere well Brazil yeah...point taken lol, movie getting real old real fast Oh ok, active duty get one military visas? stupid fucking country. country full idiots. He’s already it. cannot infect infected anyone, would wear mask? Outside anyone doesn’t know feeling uncomfortable it.  percentage infected people simply unknown. valid excuse lying masks, you’re right would fly  Stop angry idiots. You’ll make angry won’t make idiot smarter. Register vote pick better idiots.  Well it’s normal unemployment, yes. extra recovery package, no. government cannot keep increasing deficit printing money. Yes 1 3 long term issues huge exaggeration bullshit?

Remember Trump closed borders E.U news subs went full meltdown Trump tell beforehand. 

Let's forget majority reddit comments crucifying Trump closing early too. Two half weeks ago. asked exact question hearing afternoon. eased restrictions places low level community spread. People got sick abide rules, infecting others going work meeting others. Talked it. point valid People making partys going dinner mainly target. thanks. already COVID I’m young healthy. would like travel. Presumably longer given earths tilt different, causes less concentration sunlight hit NH Sweden never go second wave. Military visas (and continue be) exempt ban. Right, supposed parts experience except table, like bathroom host stand. everyone that. combination good government policy 1800s plus gravitas New England.

IQ, education, income, social status affect circular way.

Because government made school mandatory kids back 1842, made kids educated. benefit head start developing elite private schools high status public schools. Elite schools universities attract people smart rich. become educated, help earn even money. smart/educated/rich people tend marry raise kids using intensive parenting method. Private tutors standardized tests, elite private high status public schools, tons extracurriculars sports, music, arts/crafts, expensive summer camps teach university level chemistry, travel foreign countries. things help expand mind young kid. can't raise IQ adult *can* help kids become smarter though intensive parenting.

When people genes high IQ, educated, affluent, lifelong marriages raising kids intensively, get another generation high IQ people educated, affluent, high social class mannerisms. MA, lesser extent, parts New England high status successful. Even ""low status"" places Maine Rhode Island really average American standards education, wealth, health. 

Now look opposite scenario: West Virginia. read study life outcomes West Virginians born 1980 - 1989. ones left state adults averaged *12 IQ points* higher ones stayed. Even controlling IQ, social class, parental education, parental income, parental marital status, West Virginian young adults left averaged 4 IQ points higher ones stayed. WV gets poorer, fatter, uneducated every generation, highest achieving people leave state. first half Hostel fun, turned agree you, come clean would pretty bad political career.   Call office congressman, help visas one constituent services usually offer. Chinese America, I’ve seen movie four times now: China, Italy, US northeast, US south... He’s close, I’ll give Greek he’s arguably 2nd. might better US Democracy point. virus well-contained RI (down 25 new cases day compared 421 peak April), guess telling New Yorkers fuck worked well Naah man, gentle giant :) State Rhode Island Providence think opened dancers interested. economy based on, e.g., tourism. imagine plenty countries much worse are. ""He also acknowledged quick spread virus “unacceptable,” stopped short implementing new policies."" 

You're right damn hoped better isn’t insanity it’s genocide. long start phase III hopefully successful publicly available vaccine question. never said can't get deaths wrong. check comment see actually said.

We certainly get information spread infection already enough information know totally flubbed it. suggestion otherwise like Jim Carry saying, ""So telling there's chance."" lot US failed test.

Or passed, depending direction intelligence goes. ""droplet nucleus"" fancy way saying aerosolized droplet

Ah, yes. ""Aerosolized droplet,"" spoken like true commoner. ;) 1. January data alarms virus create global pandemic.
2. Five months later screw managing pandemic. Mostly ignore experts listen absolutely **least qualified** advise pandemic response.

Complete utter failure. I'm sure compare to.

Wait...you're thing Global Warming. pandemic one thing. Literally turning planet place human life cannot exist next level. People FL wearing masks should. Floridian here. pandemic lack unemployment assistance, feel like I've living nightmare last three months. tell irresponsible.

To promise 100k tests week fail deliver.
To promise herd immunity every 2 weeks give up.
To keep saying 3 months strategy good.. first comparing sweden norway netherlands france italy. whe people dying alarming rate.
To claim lockdowns work citing stories bad management say word places worked.
To cite economy report referring period shutdowns enforced.
To spread false information citing forever lasting lockdowns alternative swedish model. that’s outlook shit member society. you’re worse “everyone” else KNOW you’re bragging it. future case studies part history going mind blowing. Gold go fucking president there. guess asshat-I don’t fucking watch TV. Also *we’re *it’s *I’ve. American never seen shit show like pulled. I’m supposed feel better half way around world short fad people imitating idiot?

And guess what? It’s friends. Stop short sided narcissist. concentration camps? fuck blabbering about! stand this. Ah good, glad T_D user could show up. They're right, bad curve flattened see many people wearing masks outside. great gesture, almost certainly useless unless protest similarly dense crowd. outside park people feet away you, there's like zero risk transmission. watch anyone vape outside. vape cloud disperses quickly. Watch vape cloud indoors lingers. Indiana reporting in. 

You kick rocks! Anybody planning vacation Indiana needs stay home........and get fucking head examined. 

If planned vacation Indiana, get sorted out. COVID-19 least problems. rational American: probably should.
Most Americans taking covid 19 seriously we've totally given up.
I got passport earlier year excited I'm thinking might research moving. know come money, nation failed almost every single important way imaginable... Huh, two weeks since Universal opened. wonder anything /s 


If people think numbers bad Universal opening, rude violent awakening Disney goes opening. really gets many people seem care cast members locals they're planning trips middle shit. They're mad masks inconvenience them. like wanted visit smelly Europe anyway, baka. entire thread full people salty classifying every single country LOL. wanted get general point across; yes, countries middle multiple groups.

I’m expert theorist domain, I’m reddit commenter. heartening. much dislike Tegnell due wrong often implemented many incredibly harmful policies, glad least paying lip service contact tracing. still think fire replaced someone competent, hey least something he's talking contact tracing now. Eh, right. Brazil great right now. forgot add: ""Fuck Jack, I'm alright. bothered me"". operating assumption die time period something else...a guarantee many due diseases events outside COVID. STFH Ok like European countries Canada. “authoritarian bosses” you’re whining actually nothing since companies run similarly US (many equivalent branches both). you’re complaining lack social safety nets Americans perfectly free vote like, since major candidates endorsed things gotten elected much (yet). comparing life dictatorship actually working regular companies regular jobs free country views aren’t majority aren’t enacted. 

FYI free secondary education isn’t free think. countries pay shit ton taxes. want balanced budget would much rather choose money goes government decide (especially since kids). personally health care though: think that’s essential function governments tax provide None polling read indicated “most” people country rush fair Mumbai slowly coming control. MH handled well. control spread Dharavi big achievement. states must test especially Delhi Bihar. worried Bihar considering CM think cases means failure. 400 cases 17000 tested MN vs 6 rally. Cmon, i'm still waiting ""killing people"" standard. Mexico like insane obesity rate, like 70% irc

This gonna really hard still worst 1/3 poster claiming. roll sunset Dan Patrick following him. I’m reverse side, US working Japanese company. hesitant let everyone WFH US offices, beyond frustrating. tried reopen offices two weeks ago — need office considered essential. Actually CEO makes ton jokes it. Anyway apparently Japan office rotating office shift, like go every day, that’s version telework. WFH frowned upon office means productivity Japanese world. Therefore—them going back business usual Isn’t surprising. Also agreed, lack testing real issue. anyone remember long took Abe cancel olympics year ?!! fair Mumbai slowly coming control. MH handled well. control spread Dharavi big achievement. states must test especially Delhi Bihar. worried Bihar considering CM think cases means failure. US actually one world leaders testing per capita. top 20ish

Number 26 world leader. Yeah, get food riots world war. also gives India China time boil make start war intense. “I'm white male, age 18 49. Everyone listens me, matter dumb suggestions are.” believe access working generators issue United States...

I truly wonder whether rate oxygen US condense, able match rate oxygen needed consumed exponential growth ICU patients, may soon need oxygen?

it would interesting know someone like CDC answers questions -- can't match rate, someone needs start filling tanks NOW. they. Government mandated amount? done company company basis.
Ie uk law states 4 days must get least £90 odd week. Nothing lower. Companies pay higher OP said 'one best world' 'the best world.' completely different. One best could top 100 160000. philosophical perspective interesting debate. point issue become tenuous forces people streets risk lives lives come contact with?

For participating protests, line crossed. think double standard, question threshold.

There threshold us would make take streets. people ethnicity loaded cattle cars shipped concentration camps, would protest? extreme, demonstrates point injustice worth risking life virus. Fun fact: portuguese acronym ""EU"" means call ""US"" They'll first time share videos empty hospitals prove media lying. would bet would least 50% mask compliance country President wore one public camera speaking. Hell, could high 75% compliance. fact hes wearing one makes people feel like joke. Fauci Birx tried convince us good old Donald stepped said felt like wearing one. ass graves That's nice you.

Wouldn't work around here. give away masks vast majority people wear them.

I make mine. people give people I'm close to. things take two hours minimum make special order fabric. 

But one put car, forget grab one bathroom, I'm literally covered. Yes. gyms Los Angeles open. impact alone far exceeds camp ground open. I'm sure production facilities places work (probably like fort knox), grunt work needed like packaging, cleaning, anything related manufacturing shipping things, feel like lot folks dealing unemployed might psyched jump small part advancing toward solution. hook 'em honeywell P100 mask let's go! wait till PPE runs health professionals get sick. vice.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* know think this. I've watched head virology University Bonn discussing extremely low rate infection within ""Many"" sounds like exaggeration article John Hopkins university shows UK, Spain, Italy lead US Coronavirus deaths per 100,000. 

That said, US 4th *world* Coronavirus deaths per capita. realize countries may reality worse us they're fudging numbers, even still rank ridiculously high. According medical center central website, ICUs full 4 days. surge capacity exceeded two weeks current rate.  Wallstreet gets trillions, Trump's friends family get billions... suddenly million dollars much. 

Keep border closed forever. Hey! Another flush study! Woo. time scary graphics. 

Yeah. SHIT (yes intentional). People close lid. finally brush teeth toothpaste. Clear path greatness. beautiful. sad yall. feels like watching sitcom town oregon, last case 2+ weeks ago. Still people wear masks. friends yet get Gainesville, kept going asymptomatic. Like going bars shows testing positive. Nope far Governor shrug.

He legalized masks. vaccine means end virus parts world time. Nobody riding train longer anybody else. Possible reasons this:

Making knowing transmission HIV serious crime perverse consequences people basically hid condition ""the authorities"", avoided testing treatment. Fewer people hide penalty lowered. felony law enacted, getting HIV thought death sentence. drug treatments keep control large majority people. thought Trump one stopping everyone else travelling USA? said so! bad, dumb nurses probably went partying past week. every worker hero. They're people. least 30% Americans Syphilis Express. really. truth it’s 110ish lately. one congregating outdoors heat. congregating indoors HVAC running frequently likely circulating virus throughout buildings. It’s kind worst case scenario.

I’ll avoiding humans foreseeable future. See 2021! Hobbies. Mostly, I’ve tried making things.

* Beer: homebrewer couple years now. quarantine, able dump time into. Made beers ever had, tried new styles, tweaked modified recipes, name it. time research really learn lot
* Baking: I’ve trying waste free. I’ve always used spent grain beer making process bake stuff, I’ve done it. also, like many others, got sour dough. honestly don’t make sourdough break - learned make normal tasting bread, bagels, donuts though.
* Candles: wife loves candies. figured, screw it, can’t hard. It’s really not. Melt wax, put scented oil wick, let dry.

There’s other, normal things, too. Video games, playing guitar, actual work occasion (I’m teacher, summer nice. Online school waaaay harder normal school actually care right). But, overall, extra time things work yourself. Learn new skills. Push new things. There’s better time improve expand skill set. damage close far worse damage missing USA tourists. Don't, let people know respectful US tourists mean ""if""? went store tonight. ONE person store wearing mask. him... it. None employees one on.

People think over. They're rude awakening weeks. smells like Texas regrets wants reverse position opening up. them, they’re sacrificing worship great lord Donald Trump wear mask. president set example supporters follow, even told “hey I’m Pres I’m wearing mask bc think I’m invincible, you’re wear mask” they’d gladly wear mask. little freedom look beyond anti-mask freaks saying it’s freedom... another case backwards parts country crying rights &amp; freedoms they’re forced anything doesn’t resemble living year 1850. cried “but muh constitution freedom” majority wouldn’t return runaway slaves, majority wanted blacks vote, majority wanted women vote, majority wanted integrated public school, etc etc. 

If freedom rights, constitution would’ve already protected them. constitution’s amendments don’t protect think protects, think does. Worse relatives work healthcare think hoax. can’t wrap head around logic So, posted another thread, needs repeating. something need spend next couple months drilling people's heads:

And emphasize everyone know *need* get flu shot year. helps reduce risk getting flu; get flu, generally reduces severity it. mean less likely need treatment flu, reserving medical resources need them.

It also means get sick, helps simplify quicken decision testing tree (further reducing strain medical system). *And* end covid, makes less likely end concurrent (and possibly life-threatening) case flu.

Get damned flu shots, people! Protests shop ICU overflow state either. toupé said help social distancing. 9 active cases couple days ago. tightening restrictions quarantine though try keep new cases spreading. Ok.

Yeah, love Americans think ones states/provinces. country 16 states government. Sorry break news you, they're letting either. banks still expect mortgage payments landlords still need rent. banks really need forced freeze loan terms now. follow ethical skeptic twitter, makes feel better this. get much per month... Governor Hot Wheels again! greater tragedy sane man insane world. seems obvious everyone Trump  Welcome twilight years empire Listening POS chief pushing less testing. still find baffling using 3rd party sources find infection rates, deaths, etc. fuck CDC doing, seriously hes got IQ fuckin flapjack. website linked , buttons ""data source"".
Click ""location"" name.

your link opens words ""PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) - Getting tested COVID-19 easy since state officials say still enough kits test everyone symptoms. **Most testing facilities require doctor's order COVID-19 test**.""

So ... best see,, ""no symptoms, test"" certainly appears basic rule here.....  I'm saying post imply 1 3 Arizonans affected/infected COVID. 

Not affected comments much. Lol :) 😎👍

As great *Hermain Cain* would say yo self governor orange-faced kiss ass cost people lives. give much credit. Dude tv protest friend die, orher oon ventilator still. protesting reopen coz overblown. Easy flow chart;

COVID-19 exists? treatment? Wear mask. Thank you. Italy actually decent response, got hit early prepared that. enough sexy suffragettes 1918. Cases rising half states. Gee, Doc, ya think? stupid comment. think it’s southern states west worry now. I’m currently lowest transmission rate NY/NJ far behind along decreasing numbers new cases. 

I’m worried bunch tourists coming visit Boston Cape vacation states social distancing mask requirements nonexistent. Here’s hoping shit doesn’t hit fan friend! like expecting sun gonna rise tomorrow, fuck thinking? Governor charged mass murderer Well I'll dammed... cost failed leadership.  Haha like right needs worry NY coming FL. pissed earlier everyone praised cuomo criticized him. 
Cuomo isn’t better though  alert came news app stated 55 new cases Tokyo. 

Can expect go 17:00 typically stop reporting day. finished first week indoor dining NH. town, nobody wearing masks. go grocery store half people dont masks. I'm wondering end next week start show increase numbers. shame people cant suck wear mask.   Tim EU name can’t defer acceptance, reapply next year sure. Thanks honesty! fuck guy up?  wrong Mexicans? really need stop stalking comments perhaps give useful feedback conversation. Might boost karma bit actual thought instead low budget troll low quality post. I'm blocking add absolutely nothing Reddit experience seems like add much anyone else's either. Yep, Dayton area husband minority comes wearing mask. recently baby I'm avoiding going places would wearing one too. works ICU opening back COVID unit. Makes lose faith humanity uh, aviation permanently stopped. expect do? get line dead end loser job behind underemployed masses, throwing away years thousands dollars took become international pilot? way. he's probably got enough buffer chill home fly again. remember early on, looked like Australia set America. confused happen, even surprised Australia listed amongst successful nations missed everything Australia (not international news worthy apparently). Congratz Australia changing course slamming virus dead part! large events again? Great! Growth ""looks"" linear early stages exponential growth. got bad feeling gonna rip going next week. Triage mass casualty events real. Many local hospitals set triage tents outside ER‘s, evaluating patients come shunting potential Covid 19 separate areas hospital.

It really surreal weeks shut down, work hospital laboratory equipment essential worker status. also travel living it’s added whole shit load extra stress normal 9 5.   ?  Darn. job sending Canada next week one country work specifc system. I'll tell said can't go. lack leadership article you’re commenting source. waiter brings good meal kicks shins, ok upset service happy food. use line Simpsons. never ashamed American, **so far**. 50% country live someone either sick old? We'd quarantine though. happens jobs? guess lose right? someone people quarantined left fill jobs people want go out? asking half country quarantine can't work, supposed get money rent food etc.

So guess plan really feasible then, thanks playing time. See tomorrow! graduated lot. full time job involves *lot* air travel, won’t working till early 2021. part time job gym obviously laid from. I’ve filling days mainly biking, driving range, learning code/cook. Fine activities band-aids feelings tbh we’ve become shithole country EU travel list? Nah, already agreements discussed override this. I'd surprised UK highlight passengers US part layover stop theory go quarantine 14 days travelling, checking/enforcement pretty lackluster. Yes, different areas different rules well different rates cultural opposition wearing mask. one area moderate social distancing 70% people wearing masks, virus still spread much less another place almost social distancing 20% mask usage. 

Where live, people wearing masks, required enter number locations. friend mine mentioned visiting South Carolina recently, walking restaurant person wearing mask, people turn around point.

Even diseased people travel, infect fewer people (due social distancing rules) people infect also infect fewer people (both due rules, rate mask adoption. Start requiring masks dude! test results show protesters caught Far, Good: COVID-19 Spread Protests...Yet Public health experts breathe sigh relief increases end June

Being outside wearing masks makes big difference. criticizing regime think measures going humam rights, maybe, *maybe* understand human rights respect them??

Also, thanks outing Chinese lapdog. think coverup welding people shut homes extreme beyond scope containing virus, nothing left say you. one this? outside haircut great idea! I'd that. try make habit getting upset things completely control. Merkel like middle aged Roger sex change. I've heard contradictory narratives coming German response, overall seem well. Japan enigma; everything I've heard suggests story government tried last group, people actively managed themselves. So, failing grade government ended mattering people got perfect grade.

Similarly, AFAIK India Russia trying things right, except India's case economic realities sheer level dysfunction mean impossible, Russia's case seem stuck stage one trying: 'we'll put effort can't bad, right?'. overall effect, fair enough.

“Our European visitors important us.

Typical ! Ah yes, *just* facemask. qualms wearing one necessary, even gives anxiety able see people's facial expressions makes hard effectively communicate them. 

But what's next? Forced quarantines? Mandatory vaccines? Immunity passports? Microchipping? facemask, sets precedent totalitarian measures. Holy fuck!!! Number cases increased. took New York (#1), New Jersey (#2), Connecticut (#3), Massachusetts (#4), Rhode Island (#5), Delaware (#9), Maryland (#10), Pennsylvania (#11), New Hampshire (#17) highest deaths per capita get there!

Vermont (#38) Maine (#42) 2 states 11 make northeastern US top half states deaths per capita. point (and hopefully aforementioned states well way now) get vaccine, cases start drop simply lot people already got virus. goes October Italian vacation 84-year old father. He's always wanted go. Fuck Trump. makes think know truths? Yea well get fucked, southern states. I'm proud NY. wearing masks physical distancing taking seriously. I’m confused...So launch sun drink bleach? No. It’s Central European country. mean “my dad I”? I’ve reread line four times thinking “my dad significant dropped lunch wife”. dads so? yours? wife know? autocorrect error? must know! hope mortality rate among newer cases lower seen historically.

Well probably will, simply testing. 

30,000 cases today different 30,000 cases March. March, meant cases now, number confirmed cases. number deaths lower. California people barely going out? Mexico.  least one, cus know Ireland 5 million tech workers??? hope extend Canadians. stayed home (still many) I, one wear mask follow guidelines.

However agree closing borders USians. wish we'd close borders next year. read earlier EU considering banning visitors travelling US MAY impact decision. yet set guidelines, might let still travel work there, wanted make aware decision could made them. Good know! sarcasm? never time know masks effective limiting spread infection.

And yet people, Fosse, WHO, CDC, others went television warn people wearing masks.

That's right. said mask would fail protect you, wearing one may actually increase risk infection.

Whatever motives, unforgiveable. state difit's different. 

Florida example, barely paid anything all. partner hasnt gotten money 6 weeks. cant anything it. Theyve abandoned call centers. stopped answering mails. Nothing works all. 


And designed way. Admitted officials. people couldnt rely they'd forced keep working. normal times. completely totally fucked everybody state affected this. would add 蔣經國to list benevolent dictators.

 


I think ever expect dictators everything want. even elected presidents manage make happy.

 


However, tried they're best make Taiwan better place Taiwan good place efforts.

 


No one perfect get saddam hussein appreciative instead demand leaders saints. makes think death toll covered up? Gob: Look Clusterfuck Michael! Germans defeated French.

We tested people daily EKGs whatnot sending even one dose. doubt every hospital place. Right. Patients fighting lives HCW’s busting asses risking infection. Even ONE dies burden still quite significant. 

But general public hardly seems care unless affects personally. gonna sound dumb I’m kind afraid go back eating going back normal doctor/hospital check ups know paramedic/nurse it? hair dresser it. mean know symptoms I’m risking especially weak immune system Who? What's stopping huge liability? possible catch covid sue bar opened despite rules? sue someone putting wet floor sign, can't sue this? I'll bet businesses started forced pay sick people following regs, they'd start following regs. so? Remember expanded quarantine requirement out-of-state travelers Sunday, adding growing patchwork domestic travel rules aimed stemming spread Greg Abbott targeted pandemic's hot spots, ordering air travelers California, Washington state several places must self-quarantine two weeks arriving Texas. executive order, previously focused New York, New Jersey, Connecticut New Orleans, also expanded Sunday Louisiana Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit Miami. new rules take effect I'm really curious Justice Dept's theories is, okay sort thing. okay Florida quarantined incoming New Yorkers, maybe shoe's foot? Travelled America extensively, also Africa, SOE chunk Eastern Europe.

If truly believe state America even fraction fucked countries areas deal daily basis points outs ridiculously hysterical, spoilt average American is.

Stop Victimhood charade, one else planet looks America feels bad you. reddit users American...so Somebody notify Florida. weve gotten quarter supposed to. **YES**

~Papa Nurgle Brazil US whole level right now. Fuck Bolsonaro. Fuck Trump GOP. living scary place here, Texas. 

People rebelling masks. removed restrictions soon. people jails prisons aren’t properly protected. people nursing facilities aren’t properly protected. People trying go bar bar, unmasked, shooting people.

This state likely going make nyc look like nothing. isn’t bragging rights. It’s stupid horrifying! Either freezer trucks, unfortunate enough percentage die home. one thing relatives checking them. there's also morbid possibility COVID victims found months even years later due alone. That's disturbing sad thought. Back April: ""This fake, people crisis actors, see mannequin posing corpse? Look nurses goofing around empty ICUs.""

""Look Sweden, lockdown, they're alright!""

She described many things past Vietnam war even Great Depression photos show pain real situations people going through.

You came hoping different reaction got. clever experiment, pretty much summing Congress takes forever get actual work done. wonder technocracy would fare. Article picture governor home. irony picked another country suffers due fundamental religious views. 

Christianity special. Fundamental religious beliefs bad society whole. There's nothing wrong religion approached healthy way denying science human rights healthy way. tests, number positives 0! fight national outbreak! /s Well, balding tends associated testosterone levels, that's one possible avenue.

However, balding also associated aging, there's also that. China tell US wear masks last 6 months? Yea pretty much nailed it. entirely political part. Remember China hiding deaths news reports 

Like watched nothing

Now toggle muh china flu bro time dare endure, time ease comfort funny see people different countries completely different belief systems different governments believe governments get national conspiracy I’ll upvote offender - freedom shorts LOL Darwin almost awards give out.  pilot international US airline, news wanted read today.

""For many Black people, deciding whether wear bandana public protect others contracting coronavirus lose-lose situation result life-threatening consequences either way,"" Director ACLU's Racial Justice Program ReNika Moore told CNN April.""

Hmmm... still crap, different reason...

I think remember couple stories black men denied access stores wearing face masks cat getting cancer treatment state Boston every week March. Staying hotel built-in kitchen absolutely safest thing travel. worked well anyway. 


Back almost one masking yet. 4 trips, every meal self cooked, 4 gas stops pay pump. Never went single store even pet hospital. still glad though month caught it. Yeah good luck that.  France won’t begin processing July 1st, yeah VFS issue weird haven’t mentioned opening visa centers US despite countries saying visas US. Maybe year we’ll go back consulates processing visas VFS center SF least processes visas like five different countries, maybe won’t open process every country. Aww I’m sorry. grad school overseas imagine disappointing you. au pair visas? **Only america,** excuse wear mask (such inability procure afford mask) protect surely **most deadly RESPIRATORY VIRUS CENTURY** \- can't agree simply common sense solution (wear mask go anywhere near hoomans) 6 months watching thing coming pipe.

Everywhere else - including CHINA started able get page, come together stamp - everyone simply wearing masks street.

Only America entitlement runs wild, seeing headlines people dont give fuck themselves, stupid believe hurt certainly GAFF (give flying fuck) anyone else are.

Foresight blind truly hope wrong fear truly watching beginning fall western civilization unfold front us.

I've watching domestic stuff play TV, find Putin may (allegedly) hand spinning BREXIT - what's next? I'm waiting tweet come 2am says resigning NATO.

President Putin must dying laughing watching satellite dish every night underground bunker.  Lots growth southern states. Likely continue increasing without intervention. Mask mandates may reduce spread two weeks, two weeks growth going troublesome hospitals. testing reveal still problem. That’s I’m saying. We’ve stagnant percentage whole, made progress thing??? It’s standard 14 day quarantine interstate travel Australia, except NSW VIC bordering states Well trans woman already takes pills, good. Yes. US response horror show. Brazil hair behind, Britain create second wave. Ban all. gonna write this. Yeah Texas make Lt. Governor powerful governor somehow? know - someone explain why??? that's argument nobody forced anything China either, they're free accept dire consequences. it. Full 2 months. Ill never fucking put hell makes hardly difference long run. much tried safe, 90 percent people almost pointless. Countless people home issues mental issues due locked home, sad see struggle ultimately futile long run. Here's crazy catch: dead people good economy either. People like idiot going drag years end killing million Americans.

This virus GIVE FUCK constitution. constitution says can't take appropriate steps fight pandemic, constitution needs amendment.  Trump fucking embarrassment. Sending giant fuck supporters enablers.  central Texas there's lot angry people. Waco surrounding municipalities instituted mask mandate businesses. much Hollywood growing up. went down? Oregonian thing since Civil War. 

If understand comment, understand comment. ""Power Red""? Um..then open everything up? 


If small business owner I'd petty sue claiming he's preventing making living telling everyone stay home told open up. First month hit booze HARD. bought much wine liquor. went fast believe finding back liquor store every week stock again. especially fell hard vodka soda cycle - basically much could drink fell asleep. 

Well, anxiety attacks started two weeks. could focus job hate say, possibly lost lot ground covered, honestly playbook sort thing?

I made decision least cut hard alcohol now, must, buy max 2 minis. wine beer now. hope cut too. fair, sure nights cannot drink work day. also picked running back weather turned. Democracies work right corruption (and lobbyism)...this makes people lose faith democracy vote right-wing gasbags make corruption issue even worse. really time end downward cycle... Cite source. I'm taking bets. way gets re-elected unless Biden gets virus keels over, even probably loses. BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Nice, feeling better I’m eating anyway I’ve decided. Yolo ha. Cause they're old. baffled much longer cling ""its testing"" narrative light evidence isn't.

My guess we'll take action hospitals fill up. 20 percent? imagine explosion cases? What's surprising hes considering it. Technically say Easter Sadly, fall might show us disaster really looks like keep shit together. Right? sitting 14 billion dollars, so?

""Both structure institutional memory gone now.""

You need especially read last paragraph. right. Many major EU nations mandate wearing masks. evidence prove it’s federal policy. Brazil fucking HOUSED right now. Jeezus, WTF happened.  k Ok well ruined bracket. live fitting rooms clothing stores remain closed. understandable precaution, takes away biggest reason I'd go store rather ordering clothing online returning fit. got MMR vaccine booster year (somehow didn’t measles antibodies) baddd fever full day. Still better getting fucking measles. I’m sure paper would publish stimulating inflammatory response isn’t purpose vaccine. Australia spent something like 19 million this. Hotels staffed police, people need fed, health professionals site testing, travel organised them. New York would spend similar amount. People started rejecting orders well Fauci piece came out. 

That’s valid excuse. People forgetting, three weeks ago Memorial Day weekend. think that. don’t understand then. Gotcha. I've always thought ""black lives matter"" really ""poor lives matter"" wonder I'd staff positives tracked like Tulsa think he's smart guy. reach heights tennis like , pick foreign languages easily. that's he's instinctual, excels things lacking common sense things control.

Well sounds familiar depressing California still got large population REALLY want go Disneyland right now. feel small businesses US financial safety place natural disasters like this, people would ok lockdown much longer since govt system place, lockdowns continue harm us people still pay rent bills. I'm fortunate work home lot people can't. lockdowns minor inconvenience, they'd alright they're devastating right help anyone gotten one check didnt even cover rent people.  clearly haven’t following closely. epidemiologists put IFR 0.5-2% since Wuhan. Also try voting GOP. *Americans Ye right, normally lock whole world every year flu! Please don’t confuse ‘recovered’ back normal! people don’t die doesn’t mean back work 5 days like common cold! troubles people’s selfish nature made white lie necessary.

But dont blame them. really fucked up.  well people saying trump didnt go plans slow testing.. now? ones said joking? think argument officially dead Different people different views. think person 24 upvotes speaks millions redditors? summarizer bot, Here's summary rate coronavirus cases among incomes low enough Medicaid far higher everyone else analysis.

U.S. done great things admit, method we're handling outbreak laughable. think staying NATO good idea, always nice know we've got military support shit hits fan. say could learn thing two E.U's political policies, dont touch muh guns, like freebrem sticks. scrolling comments hoping wasn’t one felt way. They're pretty much everywhere.

The problem Bolsonaro intentionally downplaying risk pandemic political gain (little flu, close schools, wearing mask himself, etc.) rabid, blind supporters (who are, unfortunately, millions), word gospel. people either ignorant and/or lack self awareness dumb joke? u/summariser_bot Incognito....  Looks like Sweden past Italy death per capita end summer. believe ridiculous talking point. second hurricane coming (or virus control) , people definitely shutdown again. lived South, went multiple hurricanes. Sometimes 2 3 weeks apart. board back shutdown. 

You stop virus stops. Irony action. could go till 2022 man... not. Considering tone song I’d say aged perfectly, fact it’s even relevant today first got released that? Well awkward... like dump girl, get back dumps you?  Yep, here. screened last week, fever immediately dismissed it’s hot car. 7:45 AM.  would that. long shutdown bullshit stopped. ok safety inspections example, wouldn’t support ban driving. Yeah.  sane well-run country, would comprehensive federal response, financial supports states well citizens.

Get clue. Everyone ban us travelers till get shit together Memorial Day? countries already first wave (New Zealand, South Korea). countries, like USA, Brazil India still first wave.

Some parts world begin second wave, parts still first wave. Holy shit, seriously 6,200 CA?!? cutting federal support many testing sites else think $14 million found day go? bet LLC formed right now. Emergency doctor one buddy first year practise? Sorry guy could Google Info enough broken bone really appreciate virus give little credit Exactly - people realize fear unfounded, moving on. New Jersey too. ran huge outdoor sidewalk sale business (vintage shop) 500 people estimated two days. ask one man put mask on. people packed churches. think it’d beautiful /s  Yeah. kinda skeptical - - much. Roughly one third

The stats really talk masks, living situation, etc looser social distancing measures us long time now. sitting US telecom DK every day. back office full staff even went back half staff. opened schools still hard lockdown mode. talking people every day, every stage looser lockdown sitting US. Even deaths per capita Florida everyone complaining Florida holding spring break opening beaches early.

I think changed Denmark entered temperate summer, prefer spend time outside parks, patios, streets, southern states went blazing hot season, started retreat indoors. 

But obesity huge concern. obesity takes lifespan average one unlucky .5 percent actually die Covid-19. bleach, forgot *inject* it. want money already. Figure anyone dumb enough come parks give money hey it’s decision. DeSantis wants too.  Canada stopped testing results negative numbers seem increasing. physical distance outside, mask going required. Abbott, idiotic fuckwit. went mine beginning month. similar someone described. Temp taken door, let chair ready, air filtration system, hand sanitized door, used mouthwash 60 seconds, hygienist wore mask shield. felt safer grocery store certainly Strange. live Ohio could described ""mild"" symptoms since March still can't find place availability testing without requiring doctor's approval. also one best rated med centers world.

Every single statement I've heard people US sounded like ""This one best world!"" turned complete bullshit. feeling one well, sake fairness - sauce?  People going read quote history books laugh asses off. heard contradictory narratives coming German response

The federal response pretty slow lackluster states affected first severely ones pushing countermeasures. I've read (disclaimer, degree biomedical sciences I'm scientist trade), main complication decreased lung function pneumonia, resulting co-morbid bacterial infection and/or overwhelming immune response. people conditions like asthma obesity, lungs already compromised, covid exasperates point can't effectively oxiginate blood. Interesting note here, eosinophilic asthma caused overactive immune system, treated corticosteroids (just systemically administered dexamethasone). immunocomprimised individuals, initial viral infection subsequent bacterial infections probably main cause death. also seems people experiencing covid related inflammatory syndromes, get shit like blood clots cause heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary embolisms. Dexamethasone probably helps lot cases, imagine reduces amount scarring occurs lungs immune overreaction lungs. see cases relatively healthy people getting fucked inflammatory scarring. people preexisting conditions dying instead. well well. Keep saving. sure visit Croatia come Dude, need governments tell us truth like US. read news saw protestors already know United States going fucked tons morons.  gadget? United States Germany pisses completely stripped us power enforce measures prevent transmission. Fuck guy. Well ok though magic air filter masks necessary there. virus really plague would witnessing fall American empire real time arguments seen merit. look link, 26% Covid-related. could triple Covid patients still within sustainable surge capacity ICU. saying 90% full bit disingenuous trying place virus. course, mean still concerned current trend trying depict like ICU overrun virus patients gives idiots ammo try claim media-driven hoax. Great sources professor. Well guess Norway then, Bødo come!! tried moving Canada deciding move USA Canada definitely restrictive. hell going force bunch Texans stay home?

Lol good old time. Please remember idiot saying that? really left Vietnam neighbors, South Korea Austria. German response largely spearheaded Söder Bavaria took notes Austria inspired South Korea (even though measures implemented 1:1 difference power ideology structure app-less contact tracing mandatory mask wearing adopted early).

The wearing masks point contention really mark shame Western culture. Luckily many people figured either worth getting emotional managed accept idea millions un-oppressed Asians without world ended years ago manage we.

I'd say lifetime experience every citizen government alike learn lessons. Oh he's Sucks flight, congratulations marriage NYC hit peak 4 weeks lockdown. trying spoil sentiment it’s pretty grim things exploding. me. watched million diy haircut vids YouTube twice far (Farrah Dukhai awesome). Basic good. fiancé bought clippers kit amazon gave level 3 over. He’s working home least end year doesn’t care particular style.  *Pepperidge Farm Remembers* It’s outdated article March. info longer correct testing requirements changed. long come back US passport wont problem. would guess though make exceptions allow people meet certain requirements negative test result quarantined 2 weeks.

Feedback would appreciated. 


I starting March 6 USA 14 deaths. stopped April 6 stopped useful. me, useful comparing per capita rates USA Italy predict three key dates: 


 \- people would get scared (benchmarked March 3/5 Macchini Letter Italy) 
 \- 'light' lockdown might start 
 \- 'full' lockdown might start 


This let girlfriend stock food, toilet paper, N95 masks, etc prepare work home slightly everyone else, without panicking. also let us know start wearing masks, start learning avoid crowds, etc. result, even though small stockpiles, stockpiles got us shortages without interruption. never milk/chicken/pork/toilet paper/masks/etc exactly done here. 


That spreadsheet predicted 1.2 trillion Americans would died today, June 24. useful predicting 2-4 weeks ahead making actionable decisions. too, long we're exponential growth mode, seems are. define ""useful"" is. 


You know actions available you. 
You something peg numbers against. consequences worried about? areas already experienced consequence? texas reach similar markers (say, deaths per 100,000 people) 
You create flow chart: x predicted.  
Then x happens. 


 wrong way look like: ""If Texas passes 300 deaths per 100,000 people, mean?"". .... cares. That's cart pulling horse. Instead start ""something means something"" determine many deaths per 100,000 people mean that. 


Find real practical boundaries differentiate ""old normal life"" ""new normal life"" determine many total deaths, deaths per week, hospital beds occupied, correlate ""new normal"" boundary decide need prepare new normal. Figure long take complete preparations.  


Also, nerdy stuff, discouraged criticism. Check  various modeling strategies look like. website historically terrible source determining future numbers, default numbers probably quite wrong various ways, underlying model seems quite sound fun explore. tells predicting anything past 4 weeks like trying predict weather 4 weeks. predict weather 10 days now, predict climate next year. 


The covid ""climate"" next several years looks really crappy. Hoping manufacture lots effective vaccine soon. mean yes masks work. 2/3rds tested dont know true figure. Masks arnt 100% atleast 1 2 likely caught still sports are, don’t even faith NBA NHL get resume seasons despite plans late July really great advice - nothing worth giving life alcohol. matter shitty things get, trying numb alcohol drugs brings short-term relief exchange pain misery long run. takes work kind re-wire brain redirecting something constructive, worth long run. quarantine retirement homes, it'll fine. confirm. I’m local went last week. less people near Universal grocery store. thought really genuinely good system place everyone saw obeying rules. Early first stages national lockdowns, friends driving NY FL visit friends. pulled Maryland NY plates forced quarantine hotel 14 days. see cops pull people out-of-state tags investigate. think quarantines reasonably enforceable. saw TIME early days. care retarded? Ehhhh.... Wow that’s interesting, come involved? stage trials? heard one. happened ? Oh ok. Thanks catching that. Soccer going hard pull year. Fauci says expect end year beginning 2021 Anything NY conjunction NJ CT possibly also MA. much interconnection otherwise. 

And fair, think coordinating exactly governors planning. states longing reporting accurate death statistics seem tally cases previously? part social justice crowd idiocy. Separate equal mask rules, eh? Recommending keyword.

He needs sto clowning around mandate Staye wide orders. young people protests bars, restaurants etc getting covid. 

Deaths falling dramatically COVID US. April 21st 2,693. Yesterday 267. Close, first account DE’s backlog. total still represents increase that, observation may accurate. think wave scenario really applies case. steady supply host kept infection rate realtivley stable speeding up. Either way bad! either someone who's qualifications golfed president wants move DC. sub actively wants miserable know can't hurt /s I'm bullish EWZ. authoritarian regime propped markets like US. Nothin see folks. Economy stonk market fine. look behind curtain see much debt accumulating bailing big businesses. pretty standard requirement days. 

Use title publisher closely really title, could probably use ""Worldometer: Germany"". Someone listens PMT see. Excuse what? I'm sorry gotta smoking good shit think Asymptomatic = damage. beginning, clear asymptomatic meant coughing, struggling breathe, experiencing symptoms, despite Corona still ravaging inside. likely happen. I've keeping track positive rate. Currently right entire US 7.47% positive rate 500K tests conducted reported within last 24 hours. Highly depends ur location. physician. hospital system 2 hr inpatient turn around time (limited supply tho), parking lot testing 1-3 days He's antivaxxer. think could experts, experts. number cases spiking last week. Give weeks let's talk death rates. seems retort left arsenal Covid truthers.

Those people telling ""LoL hAvEnT sUrGe, OvErReAcTiOn"" regarding cases weeks ago southern states reopening taking anything seriously. people look stupid now. little factors help sure. physically distance culture. kissing say hi like Italy close quarters handshakes like US. generally don’t talk elevators. don’t entertain large parties home. Etc.  think small potatoes compared ubiquitous mask wearing.  Japan South Korea better job almost anyone. 5k day almost much country total, texas 2m population. that's crazy. This, seems deeply rooted resentment towards uncivil people agree. Much traffic roads indicate lot people - shove pickele nose, would wear face mask *assumption* associated health issues?

Several studies found significant problems wearing masks. vary headaches, increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, hypoxia, way serious life-threatening complications.

There difference N95 respirator mask surgical mask terms side effects. N95 mask impairs breathing greater degree soft mask, often associated headaches. one study, researchers surveyed 212 healthcare workers (47 males 165 females) asking presence headaches N95 mask use, duration headaches, type headaches person preexisting headaches.

*Zhu JH et al. Effects long-duration wearing N95 respirator surgical facemask: pilot study. J Lung Pulm Resp Res 2014:4:97-100.*

They found third workers developed headaches use mask, preexisting headaches worsened mask wearing, 60% required pain medications relief. cause headaches, straps pressure mask could causative, bulk evidence points toward hypoxia and/or hypercapnia cause.

That is, reduction blood oxygenation (hypoxia) elevation blood C02 (hypercapnia). known N95 mask, worn hours, reduce blood oxygenation much 20%, lead loss consciousness, happened hapless fellow driving around alone car wearing N95 mask, causing pass out, crash car sustain injuries.

Another study involving 159 healthcare workers aged 21 35 years age found 81% developed headaches wearing face mask. Some pre-existing headaches precipitated masks. felt like headaches affected work performance.

*Ong JJY et al. Headaches associated personal protective equipment- cross-sectional study among frontline healthcare workers COVID-19. Headache 2020;60(5):864-877.*

These faily benign effects part -

No one telling frail elderly lung diseases, COPD, emphysema pulmonary fibrosis, dangers wearing facial mask *of kind*—which cause severe worsening lung function. also includes lung cancer patients people lung surgery, especially partial resection even removal whole lung.

While agree N95 mask cause significant hypoxia hypercapnia, another study surgical masks found significant reductions blood oxygen well. one study, researchers examined blood oxygen levels 53 surgeons using oximeter. measured blood oxygenation surgery well end surgeries. researchers found mask reduced blood oxygen levels significantly. longer duration wearing mask, greater fall blood oxygen levels.

*Bader et al. Preliminary report surgical mask induced deoxygenation major surgery. Neurocirugia 2008;19:12-126.*

The importance findings drop oxygen levels (hypoxia) associated impairment immunity. Studies shown hypoxia inhibit type main immune cells used fight viral infections called CD4+ T-lymphocyte. occurs hypoxia increases level compound called hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), inhibits T-lymphocytes stimulates powerful immune inhibitor cell called Tregs. .

This sets stage contracting *any infection*, **including COVID-19** making consequences infection much graver. essence, mask may well put increased risk infections so, much worse outcome.

*Shehade H et al. Cutting edge: Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 negatively regulates Th1 function. J Immunol 2015;195:1372-1376.*

People cancer, especially cancer spread, risk prolonged hypoxia cancer grows best microenvironment low oxygen. Low oxygen also promotes inflammation promote growth, invasion spread cancers.

There another danger wearing masks daily basis, especially worn several hours. person infected respiratory virus, expel virus breath. wearing mask, especially N95 mask tightly fitting mask, constantly rebreathing viruses, raising concentration virus lungs nasal passages.

We know people worst reactions coronavirus highest concentrations virus early on.

And evidence suggests cases virus enter brain.

*Wu et al. Nervous system involvement infection COVID-19 coronaviruses. Brain Behavior, Immunity, press.*

In instances enters brain way olfactory nerves (smell nerves), connect directly area brain dealing recent memory memory consolidation.

By wearing mask, exhaled viruses able escape concentrate nasal passages, enter olfactory nerves travel brain.

*Perlman et al. Spread neurotropic murine coronavirus CNS via trigeminal olfactory nerves. Virology 1989;170:556-560.*

From research this, see scientific reason masks made mandatory - agree *possible* psyhological effects may bearing infection rates due modifying people's behaviours\* - think assumption enough warrant making mandatory, especially considering risks / possible risks involved wearing them.

\* British Government also appear agree -  SAGE’s behavioural science sub-group SPI-B presented  which influenced UK's lockdown policy agenda.

This appears one policy aspects been led science.

But isn’t virology epidemiology, it’s behavioural science. SPI-B substantial number people still feel sufficiently personally threatened…The perceived level personal threat needs increased among complacent.”*

Instilling fear millions people, ensure comply, requires mass propaganda campaign. SAGE clear media's role. Appendix B paper, SPI-B recommended media increase sense personal threat.****”***

Sometimes it’s stupid works, isn’t stupid. make political course, that's purely personal agenda. I'll miss Europe 😭 Sad say, hope Canada folliws suit. Unless US get numbers control, needs quarantined rest world. bad TX, even Abbott recommending masks, staying home, mentioning shut down.  Arizona: *waves* pointed weakest human link available. ate year old cookies beginning pandemic fine. Honestly think month old batch would fine, I’m expert obviously brightest. Yikes. scrolled quite bizarre. Imagine jobs claimed harassment tweeted caps. However, drove East Texas Trump 2020 signs everywhere. new clearly home made. don’t think read twitter though. god-like image head that’s it. Also animal trials showed didn’t prevent infection reduce severity next best thing. We’ll see though. don’t expect vaccine likely 2021. still first outdoor strip clubs. Thank answering. Thank answering. No, we'll look football scores front page get way Sure hopefully COVID-19 does. Thank answering. Dude, that's awesome! Props him! like lots, too. 
- NYer INFORMATION ALWAYS GOOD would like see argument constitutional grounds, never explain how. Work friend work. Gotta keep economy going. /s unfortunately people pay bills work go. live around Houston fucked. Exactly Obviously both. half brain think protests spread COVID Man sometimes best way start start drinking less. quit good. instead every day won’t drink Tuesday. became won’t drink Sunday Tuesday. 3 days week on. Keep it. someone clarify me: suggests everyone stay home, issue actual stay-at-home order like one March/April? understanding right? first obligation make sure people around state really comprehend magnitude challenge we’re dealing with,” said Abbott. “There remain lot people state Texas think spread COVID-19 really challenge. Know this, today, Texas report all-time high number cases people testing positive 5,000. pointed out, hospitalization rate time high. coronavirus serious. It’s spreading Brazos County, across entire state Texas, exactly action taken

I must agree, change tone pretty noteworthy. actually something happy though. would much scared kept right marching ahead change tone everything goes hell around him.  Can't say blame them. It’s bad kind came nowhere examples follow flatten curve.../s Usually would take that. cautious rushed vaccine. Especially kids pregnant. can’t really test everyone else deemed safe. Look thalidomide. approved U.K. morning sickness ended causing mass fatal deformities newborns. Really scary. original post, though? Struck nerve I? Point hypocrisy I? welcome. mention crippling million dollar hospital bill survive.  He's still speaking yes comes mask five people room: two signers, person running video conf, person running slides, camera guy (all six feet apart btw) Classic liberals. Smh... understand that.

I picked 3 months, worst case timeframe guarantees complete result. Let's say year. Regardless, America population 328 million, 70% would 230 million infect herd immunity. would 19 vs 76 million new cases monthly. 

To date, America 2.4 million confirmed cases, 120,000 confirmed dead. ratios hold (assuming undertesting line excess mortality), America would looking 1 million deaths (all causes) per month, 12 million sacrificed herd immunity. Total excess mortality would least 9 million, assuming COVID-19 perfect reaper would die anyways. think number cases going long time? I’m sorry don’t sleep schedule would like to. Fuck im NYC. I’m similar boat office, think I’ve put foot much able to. Basically told boss don’t see need back office WFH going well take ton precautions room again. little much faith healthcare system right thing pharmaceutical companies try suck much blood get away  People cited Taiwan, Hawaii, New Zealand, islands. completely different landlocking state center transport hub region. Propeganda. probably check article commenting  ever think maybe correct? 🤦‍♀️

Protests mostly outdoors masks. doesn’t take genius realize isn’t nearly big problem maskless morons indoors. highest number new cases per day US 39k. expect record broken week. GUYS Americans immune protesting Uh, yes. said asymptomatic carriers pose greatest risk spread.

User name checks out, bot. Smart move. respect that. 

Note: supposed go Greece trip lifetime 2 weeks 50th kids July 4th. losing least $2400 ya know what? life unfortunately highly contagious virus spreading(some people forgot needed remind them) Many states take seriously last months capacity testing (or hospitals) need right now. States took seriously leeway... generally need much. start testing flu COVID fall? would good know symptoms know one have. 

Of course, everyone get flu shot 100% effective would good know one have! It’s even necessarily bad thing 2020 cancelled. I’ve learned cook often, I’ve learned enjoy nice walk. I’ve seen ducks, skunks, rabbits, woodpeckers. I’ve started shopping groceries pickup instead wandering store picking every random thing. I’ve put grass seed fertilizer properly actually gardener summer lawn looks amazing.

There good things embrace here. good reasons learn enjoy home again. Australia seperate islands / Continents advantage really limiting international travel main spreaders. still around though easily gets control complacency . telling bright white sneakers pulled white tennis socks. want Dems break bad news.

""Wasn't us!""  I'm doctor (in Australia) haircut since December.

Today urged us stay home. complete 180 even 1 week ago. 

I think headed towards another lockdown. himself. Instead allow counties implement it. WAGs though. hand...NOBODY QUESTION QUEEN. would smart retarded

really? protest songs now? children isolated class

How heck manage children are? thought US one keeping kids cages. World FL 80 dashboard DOH site 62? ideas? God imagine corona , comfort days, get propped little 4 foot bed top DC metro plenty protests. Numbers DC, Maryland, Virginia still going down. outside protesting everyone wearing mask minimal risk. Name another country wearing masks politicized. can't. us. 

Actually, Brazil, UK, Canada came mind.

In case UK Canada, politicized different way, instead two parties argued masks, local health experts vs national government/WHO. 

UK Canada months followed strictly guideline infected people medical workers wear masks, general population shouldn't. countries starting change stance month. feel like theme song 2020 curb enthusiasm theme music  Bro wanna leave US bad, mind crash place sometime? Agreed. It’s disappointing uptake people. commend people right things, man, number people aren’t staggering. Cases spiking, rising. others think like well may - OK. OTOH, irrational fear productive lead worse outcomes. upper middle class still flush wasted stimulus checks,

If made ~$198,000 (IIRC), didn’t get anything. different definition “upper middle class” IRS. Yes, things climbing since this, reopening happened 29th people beginning loosen safety restrictions Informally Time beer

I hear Corona's popular right now. No, all, French consulates starting reopen evaluating students works visas, low COVID-19 countries like Morocco Tunisia. know sure USA list now. Canadian can't honestly say government's response categorically better organized

Tbh I'm relatively impressed government handled things. We've done really well, things considered. mASkS iNFrInGe fREeDUmBs.

Politicizing masks (when clear evidence work one best ways minimize transmission pandemic), scientists clarifying saying wanted PPE prioritized health care professionals, major fucking mistakes. stopped afghans Russians going war tho lost leg. reports 39,436 new cases coronavirus 1,374 new deaths, second-highest daily increase new cases new deaths flight cancelled right full refund EU law. fighting KLM since March mine though, stopped replying messages like three weeks ago (though tbh pressed reminded messages). try pressuring sending complaints like me, sue. course wait flight cancelled though. move back real quick since seem like actually reasonable people Scheduled test 1st... world man... take small dose finasteride curb hair loss pretty effective (larger doses drug used treat prostate cancer). Interesting know something like might covid treatment lol I'd never shopped walmart pandemic, (political reasons) since February, associates masks SoCal, masks required since memorial day (which last time went one, I'm grocery shopping every 2 weeks now, hitting walmart run bird seed, giant bags, pet stores carry). They've taken seriously. point? countries picked DUMB FreeDumb, name FreeSmart.

Edit- reference used great, I've heard, born. narrative got stuck repeat. everything greatest country earth does, even total idiocy. often meet morons individually. understand whole country acts stupid collectively. Honestly dont blame longer true, 2011 (the 'Fixed-term Parliaments Act') queen longer exercise power.

Which basically legislating de-facto situation anyway, last monarch actually used power Charles early 17th Century, [didn't end well angered family would want nothing safe state government prefers otherwise. return office though capable workload month less two weeks ago. state allow vote. Texas..  people place ensure hospitals enough masks, /S/ 2 - 1136

9 - 1093

16 - 849

23 - 874 still counting

That good sign.  Sean ""Lumpy"" Hannity et al fuck right off. Tired taking space city. Uh....I plane tickets Spain visit wife’s family July 10th... Indefinitely? Like, indefinitely indefinitely? like year indefinitely? Next January hopefully protection goes away

If loses vote going bad time then. New York Mississippi Tennessee Arkansas Louisiana Texas Illinois Thats him. reckless. blame them. Also EU time want invade US depose leadership, stop place cold one. nothing staying home. still able go out, careful wear masks. love every comment thread reddit top comment something low effort emotional, second comment giving person rational advice probably dont need worry. ""All nuts roll Florida""
 - Fox Mulder Trump doesnt seem understand less tests mean higher percent positive rate looks worse tons testing.

If smart hed pushing testing heathy individuals Looks like I’m times regarding pollution Mongolia. Several years ago flew China passed Mongolia—it beautiful blue skies open land I’ve ever seen. time arrived Beijing plane surrounded filthy brown air saturated coal particulate matter. hope fate befallen Mongolia. I’m still traumatized witnessing swirling brown air airplane ground Beijing. Same. high-risk loved ones inviting everyone neighborhood others birthday party. smh. Supply issue.

There’s enough masks. Fed step printer pump up.

They've already put three trillion dollars since March.

There much pumping happen. crazy outlook considering huge NATIONAL flag football tournament run weekend Texas. 400 teams around US attending. interesting. got it.

Reminds this.  Anecdotal, friend nurse county clinic said every worker sent home quarantine go protests, restaurants social events friends homes 

The protests reopening started around time /27th 29th, respectively. irrelevant states ‘better’ shape people travel. thought Australia licked, cases going back again? Fatality rate much younger people getting couple months ago. disease still bad, likely older, vulnerable people protecting better, least now. deserve this. Thank current administration making political issue common sense issue. sorry loss. wish people would take seriously. think Italy one countries order declared recovered must test negative twice row, otherwise must remain self-isolation. 

Same Israel.

Note process causes delays releasing people come house swab test least twice (most home quarantine), well, take days.

58% released within 21 days

80% released within 28 days

92% released within 35 days

97% released within 42 days

And 0.4% take 60 days released. live beach scenic sunny SoCal. You..?  article clearly explains it: 1+2=Covid-1984 thats um.....33 percent. Arizona appears spare capacity either testing. 

apache county 2,000 confirmed infections 72,000 residents. Yeah, fit narrative all. almost like accusation ineptitude. election season?

Oh god, going declare war us, he... thats fine understand Lmao!!! American, please ban us. government completely failed protecting us. Hopefully November 3 change everything. course. countries world USA done worst job battling pandemic. Worst. Nobody put infected bullshit, thanks government's malevolent negligence. Oh, county Sheriff refuses enforce mandatory mask order?

That county?

Shocking, say. Shocking! also comes stance knowing change much either way. Lincoln County heavily populated, population pretty white looking. Whoa. remember watching China’s response thinking, China handling way better USA ever handle it. They’re better everything. Except perhaps democracy. lost me... brother..

A fellow citizen world, borders define us.. 
I cant wait day definitions borders give cultural/explorational/touristy

Do think americans also angry predicament? Yes..

The wolves controling sheep status quo... That’s fair idea bosses hold right basic level dignity life quality hostage really crazy you?

Like, maybe ability healthcare depend upon boss views quarterly performance review. Maybe whether hit metrics month determine children go school.

The idea someone hold hostage basic quality life personal gain strike authoritarian blatantly cruel. adult kid lived Europe since 2017 college. getting bachelor’s degree university there. country doesn’t give fuck (and don’t blame them.) 

They told left March came back states went back person classes term couldn’t get back Europe SOL. letting citizens country permanent residents back in. She’s citizen she’s long term resident (like foreign college students are, whether you’re grad grad.) 

She graduating week already professional job there. told thing. working remotely go back office can’t get back country (she still qualifies long term residency permanent residency live least 5 years even apply permanent residency) they’ll fire her. 

So, no, don’t bank European countries working anything people US citizenship European citizenship. might others might not. 

She live France though. country different. suppose seven states Texas, Arizona, etc? We're way back square one, shutting things definitely saved lives gave us time determine better treatments, learn virus spreads, figure shelter avoid higher death rates, etc. definitely nearly much time bought, nothing. got back daily walkabout. It’s perfectly pleasant Brooklyn right now, spent walk Prospect Park, where, believe not, actually find places few/no people. pop mask one else around. Otherwise, even low-80s, low humidity, I’m kinda miserable. Buuuut, absolutely wear mask I’m sidewalk, store. I’ll taking subway first time since March 13th Friday. better believe completely masked up. Yeah conditions actually make wearing mask difficult ones make high risk, exception things affect senses autism. though. entire principles personal responsibility quarantining sick abandoned. expect healthy people quarantine prevent spreading illness have. Completely different principles. testing mean swabbing, would skew results toward symptomatic since people asymptomatic less likely go get swabbed. antibody test done Spain reported 34% true asymptomatic, i.e. people remained asymptomatic throughout entire infection. Data individual behaviour really hard gather, look international case studies Table 3 here:  wouldn't. I'm sorry situation. English Traditional 🇬🇧
English Simplified 🇺🇲 Ah would thought cases would updated left online  Yes say cdc talked 50mil deaths.
We can't shouldnt lockdowns.
This destroy us data show need new lockdown. *cries Brazilian* I'm going get downvoted Reddit hates America US economy stomps EU powers combined. economic powerhouse comes close China. also healthcare system, fact large majority population literally cannot afford work. I'm fortunate I'm living paycheck paycheck, close. miss week, hell even two weeks initial quarantine, I'm fucked. I've got health Insurance chance catch COVID, I'd debt majority rest life. 

America sham comes priding top 1st world country.  It’s clear disease spikes happening indoor environments outdoor ones. you’re seeing spikes states hot weather air-conditioned businesses. seeing spikes cooler states rush reopening. Plus, vast majority protesters smart wore masks. Plus, outside. without masks social distancing indoors, disease continue spread economy continue suffer. prolonging economic impact reopening without safeguards. Understandable think right schools...  way schools reopen-- many students... Right Ok'd varsity sports practice.  Perhaps, go alternate days work online. know private schools could accommodate small classroom size-- take temps daily, masks, etc.. Walmart doesn’t even cart wipes, haven’t months. 6-7 people hanging 1 cart, masks. I’m going pickup. hear diversity new imperative, diversity helpful organization society facing challenge geared handle diversity thought experience leads successful policy. challenges, organization/society best everyone falls line pulls together.

The USA probably great facing certain kinds challenges, COVID one them. got heart condition diabetes well.

Erm... yea may want take hospital, symptoms seem getting worse diabetes heart conditions exacerbating conditions may make COVID-19 serious disease potentially deadly one.

Good luck. US might want ban travel within US.  strong leader well reasoned plan would brought 50 states line. Everyone’s first step look Washington Trump kicked back states. welp planned going next year.... worries English. understand problems members country loudest. I'm great fan either. Duval County ain't Miami, Tampa Orlando. Everything's bigger Texas...Except corona? forget:

""Am considering taking Tesla private $420."" Noooooo!!! completely understand. need serious time out. hoping happening. Totally understandable acceptable. lot Americans found travelling Canada Alaska breaking rules. gets frustrating. Whelp, haven’t seen German girlfriend person since January, it’s looking like that’s gonna extend 2020 :( question legal basis states closing borders....I feel like fall power cross state commerce clause constitution. 

I understand desire however. really doubt going case rich getting vaccinated. everyone's best interest insure atleast 65- 70% population gets vaccinated go back business usual. Bullshit.  talking peoples fucking lives here.  seriously fucking think parks open going profitable anyone? going spread virus even employees suffer most. Fuck everyone else thinks parks open important preventing death. want wade actual work quoted statistician, is. Wait...the fuck? say justified? still fucked, refuting fact calling ELE. Way completely change subject. parents live Massachusetts. They’re 70s. Massachusetts opened things Monday. Inside dining one them. talking dad weekend said me, “We’re still going like it’s phase 0 here. We’re keeping ourselves.” Which...good.  I’m glad don’t argue social distancing. You’ve got backwards. problems. Yes people essential jobs yes rest us need stay home way room get safely come contact fewer people get sick hospitals won’t clogged morons go beach. People still get sick, yes, much slower rate people receive adequate care rest us stay hone protect cannot simple task. young person probably much likely kill people giving COVID-19 accident. Pandemics community accidents individual. force stay quarantine?

Depending state may room you. could great satire twitter account. It’d welcome comedic distraction Florida Senator tweets nonsensical bible quotes inopportune times. article plays statistic 960 dearhs 50 UK due Covid-19. 

But here's thing. 300,000 confirmed cases UK. UK's population 66 million. Rough maths say that's 1 every 200 got it. 

Now say dont prevent everyone follows lives normal. 50% population get it, 900 number goes 90,000. 75% goes 140,000. want 140,000 people 50 die? Lol yea right HAHA, Europe thinks Americans afford travel. can't even afford take time off, assuming we're employed all. NYC bad covid, simple. Whilst place US compare, places globally similar demographics NYC arent even comparable. Look Seoul compare NYC. Im saying thats Cuomo's fault, broken system federal level too, shitty societal compliance, people seem think NYC stunning example leadership face Covid cannot figure believe it. Even article ""considering"" something largely unenforceable anyways.  regions still pretty locked down, beginning open up. Sweden higher death rate per capita, similar active case per capita rate. selfish assholes causing problem, unfortunately, come large numbers.

Just look many crossing Canadian border vacation, claiming they're going Alaska. nuts.

It'll Europe. Self entitled Americans cross Canada flimsy pretext, hop flight Canadian airport Europe.

I've noticed number cases taking absolutely forever actually drop, likely government refuses take stringent measures. 

I've noticed acknowledged ban Chinese nationals racist... responded banning absolutely travel anywhere set thermometers airports, could avoid racist whilst actually fighting pandemic.

I've noticed politicians managing fight virus, like Doug Ford, helped accelerate originally saying dumb things fully grasped gravity situation. Thank everything politicians generally choose double-down dumb like elsewhere though.

For requiring 1 day week trial. It’s awful don’t get point. get throw mask 8 hours 1 day week... Yeah, Chinese hoards already come greece, probably go north west time. don’t enough right type. Also, patients complain think nurse making judgement call them
Being infected, patients think means dirty. Good. There's reason Americans left shit hole continent first place. We’re even first peak first wave though. think Italy is?

Hahahahaa civil war? brain reddit. completely dependent America. controversial thing say fact.

Technically visitor visa I'm literally going stay inside Norway. want America anymore. 

Anyway, everything I've read, sounds like work EU enacts rule.

Slovenia presently allows Americans in, Norway allows travellers Slovenia enter.

Will hope UK continues allow Americans EU enacts regulation. Yup US government feel like can’t quite say same.

We billionaires world government taking great care them. know. I'm saying Imperator dictator 2 different things.
What defining dictator, Imperator.

And dictator Latin spelled exactly like English. mean, like warning build capacity. Hopefully able build temporary hospitals quickly. bounce back forth FL SC. 

FL people checking temperatures border asking youre coming from. 9/10 people wearing masks. Restaurants still closed, social distance still effect. 

SC like yeehaw y'all come now. seen mask worn days. Maybe like 1/20. literally idea what's going on. 

Shows independence state has, even governor's party (McMaster DeSantis). 

And two states fifty. 

We're truly like 50 little independent nations. Lol don’t get get, Americans don’t travel stupid, travel also stupid, anyway Americans viewed good way reddit going generalize country 300 million people?? EU independent countries.

I've never serious car accident 46 years life. Yet wear seat belt case. Masks proven slow spread. worried temporary inconvenience compared lives lost? butler chugs purified sparkling water blows bum? ^pleb That's nuts. Im happy hospital. Hell, love wear mask even Covid. get flu shot required wear one well flu season. everyone gets flu shots lol. Right everyone goes thru checkpoint puts mask. It’s 1/80th. Thank everyone keeps saying stay home don’t feel safe. simple mask would allow others carry life instead become political statement. Absolutely stupid. Idiots extending misery.

The guy mask, walked right without regards social distancing thrust phone me. told fuck off. thing doesnt make sense make masks mandatory federal level several provinces without current spread.  Yeah probably see considerable drop testing numbers Texas early July federal government stops funding 7 testing facilities around nah you. nueter you, Remove tongue cant talk. remove eyes cant see, burst ear drums cant hear. leave alive, darkness, ever. people get vaccinated may still get sick. However, flu vaccination shown studies reduce severity illness people get vaccinated still get sick. A 2017 study showed flu vaccination reduced deaths, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length stay, overall duration hospitalization among hospitalized adults flu. Another study 2018 showed vaccinated adult hospitalized flu 59 percent less likely admitted ICU than someone vaccinated. Among adults ICU flu, vaccinated patients average spent 4 fewer days hospital Cant mad tbh  post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm serious, mostly reasons mentioned replies. great, benchmark USA. countless countries way better did. New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, etc. I'm impressed governments handled realized get serious, there's lots little things could done considerably better, like locking earlier thoroughly (our rate decrease sluggish compared countries), better mask compliance part individuals.

We could done better. actually maliciously bad, like states, optimal either. Far it. one example, AFAIK, recall response pandemic early sluggish. government seemed concern shocked America's actions action ourselves. recall article (can't find source easily atm) early pandemic, Doug Ford encouraged people go outside socialize turned around realized really going on. on. Lots little things, mostly due misinformed realizing gravity situation, lots responses could much earlier.

Nothing really makes dislike government response, can't really give many points better done. did... alright. direct quote go bot Thing Texas gonna go back lockdown, 4th July gonna like Memorial Day roids, gonna create insane spikes accross country especially since many people infected then. I’ve heard many stories like that. Isopropyl Alcohol based sanitizers best quality odor (for approved formulas) major shortage due high demand many switched un-tested ethanol. yeah, lot horrible smelling product there, along possibly harmful. help catch demand though sanitizer shortage close Well... sadly incompetent president ever. completely failed lead. could prepared well coordinated response. complete failure lead every aspect completely screwed us :(. hot tents outside. I'm thinking gets bad, they'll utilizing stadiums GRB. they'll staff anybody's guess. ""annoyed"" kind weasel-word described ""anger confusion""? kidding way  Massachusetts reporting in.


You fuck right off, especially Fl, Tx, Az.
We big numbers us good sense stay inside nuked Cape Cod don’t bother coming stay here.


Oh Salem gone too. Don’t come October. got think countries states/provinces/territories within country? situation unique there, what’s unique ineffective federal leadership. come version every SEC team. generic ones like, it’s like going 4th 10 5 yard line punting dorks Black people account less 15%, making even worse So, canada US one another’s largest trading partners, assure majority Canadians want borders closed, nothing payback. USA isn’t handling well, consequence countries managing disease control want keep usa, it’s crazy President, it’s insane reopening behaviour, it’s case coverups demands less testing, way fuck side planet.

is really hard believe governing bodies trusted give accurate information, make needed sacrifices, take necessary steps control thing, world would rather take financial hit cutting United States, much bigger hit full second-wave lockdowns? Maybe inability understand part underlying problem. That’s interesting thought sort immune protection due previous non COVID19 infection. could true since believe antibody tests discretion itll pick antibodies previous coronavirus infection. ""there's reason go out, unless reason"" thing increases places even many Farm Workers making best extrapolating rural counties cities We’ll vacations everyone’s top priority right /s amount human suffering depressing.

You suppress testing Freezer trucks outside hospitals land

Funny way say ""steal natives"" doctors Maryland telling people ""If 65? test positive immediately get hospital admit you! Full stop there!""

Even need ventilator yet better safe sorry 65. $98,000 got nothing. I'm glad he's coming around. reschedule Amsterdam visit COVID19 outbreak girlfriend broke also fear would fail called SPS test. Corona mutations seasonal problems. really believe different new mutation? Good Something something cages. 611 new cases today, previous high 498, believe. Hard blame :(. keep hearing Gottleib Besser? Redfield this? change fact well per capita testing.

But leader, statement. ""Doing good"" ""being leader"" two different things. course not, post-truth society. objective facts everyone agree besides 2+2=4, I’m sure trump said didn’t people would find way believe CEO Tim Eu, right? f live country balance personal rights collective well-being falls differently

But don't. rights stop tip nose. That's supreme court ruling interpretation documents country based on.

It's right black white. personal selfishness fit values country. feel sorry health officials right now. think worse show, really die. like doin weird stuff California well. combination protests, people refusing wear masks, people tired indoors want get seeing spikes well.

My opinion governor great job dealing with. making tough decisions always popular right. harder people grasp going away soon need look take care other. feel sorry health officials right now. Italy also began lockdown March 9th. New York started week later. course, population density amount transients, late, like sat hands much longer happened Italy, I'm denying could done better. They've said easily spread way. wash hands touching stuff, pretty simple. general inhaling respiratory virus exhaled others, especially indoors builds up. right people highest risk take precautions, not, people overly complicated obsessive lowest rung risks drawbacks communication best practices. Wash hands wear mask. EU drafting plan ban US, Brazil, Russian travelers entering EU indefinitely July 1. quick Google search sure find info cull work. Uh vaccines used treat infected people, that's rabies. Nothing see folks....nope...nope Good way top likely deaths you’re facing Covid, ensure lose residents die one period suspended elective surgery, another period.

I fucking guarantee haven’t cleared backlog elective surgeries point bottom line sure arguing kiddo. active cases dropping that's good. those, could write ""MAGA"" one padded helmets use kids Downs Syndrome like. understand. People watch news, right? Republic Ireland Going hospital, admitted hospital two different things. Sure people go ER headaches biting tongue time. hospital admit put bed let stay days time headache bit tongue. tested, none got sick. 

Then know hair stylists coronavirus? 

&lt;taps 1) Ontario guidelines directly contradict said post this. 

2) Re-read part quoted ""or directed public health units"". 

3) Last checked, Ottawa Canada. Ottawa restricting testing even symptomatic people, let alone strict requirements claimed. restrictive back March-April, things changed lot since testing capabilities increased. dont prevent virus, completely nonsensical thing say. 

They absolutely lower transmission rates people, say otherwise special kind stupid. Huh? weird post inactivated vaccine far, far promising (conclusive) trial results today, already moved overseas final phase testing.

As right now, Oxford study kicking initial tests, knows nothing efficacy human subjects, researchers expressed concern getting enough subjects next phase testing all. 

I think already best case scenario. failure may started long ago apparently get better arrival pandemic. top that, since think vascular virus, causing damage vascular system without symptoms well. die heart attack stroke without ever symptoms covid. least people took part wore mask.

You're seeing different pictures am. disturbed counts way delivered yes correct. 

I'm still waiting mine filed taxes back March received refund March 31st point fucking joke roll out. incredible false equivalency. Bonus choice: amongst family social circle willing take you? Grandparent? family Dr? nice person always sit next church? Cuz odds far people pass least one person decide expendable spend time person refusing wear mask distancing! Silence treason treason. Inside hurricane shelter hundreds community.
Edit: hurricane shelter actually nursing home, I’m hoping change. anti-mask league protesting same. Mask violations ended dropped people ticketed public uproar.

 folks poked holes masks smoke.

 forget link there's huge archive 1918 flu even includes personally testimonies actual news paper articles. read started shocked archive almost play play witnessing, folks cares. cities good others fair well.

We learn history.

Here's general link mask topic 1918 there's plenty others well.

www.history.com/.amp/news/1918-spanish-flu-mask-wearing-resistance go studies medical professionals countries able manage coronavirus better US. recommend masks. tie history pretty obvious path forward. Anybody else U.S. toying idea moving another country pandemic over? whole ordeal made realize intellectually morally bankrupt society is, don’t think we’re even near rock bottom yet.

Just want live somewhere takes science facts seriously. many phases there? Welp. even gonna bother. Google asymptomatic/presymptomatic think it’s headline. suspect people read headline, go day. ""literally destroying civilization""
 
850 total deaths age 34 6/19. 2600 total deaths age 44. 

Yeah right verge sociatal collapse...smh epitome sub. Good news, ""well actually that's bad news"". really, good news. ""I choose believe then"". I'm boat. gone anywhere three months tested positive weekend. Public Health said probably delivery. ""Rare"" surface transmission mean impossible, unfortunately. 90 days long time uncontained pandemic significant portion violently containment measures. Stockholm syndrome Agreed, come news viral load protests? agree shithile country cancer earth decades now. wouldnt take time wipe ass flag personally. 

That change fact well per capita testing. live? Allow alleviate confusion. What's going deadly fucking virus going around. killed nearly 500,000 people worldwide 120,000 U.S. alone. ""They"" trying ""lock people again"" people shown insufficient capacity make good health decisions everyone else communities. ""They"" trying keep us killing ignorance selfishness. confused anymore! reporting deaths reflecting insane numbers infections daily? Something doesnt make sense. seen much reported recent serosurveys, specific one referring to? Seems learn idea antibody tests ""be end all"" coming question. Given antibodies fade undetectable level still confer immunity, well new research cell response clear virus, know complete picture population immunity anytime soon. guaranteed no, evidence working like SARS-CoV-2. found cases people reinfected, trials promising well. point big news BLM protests were/are represent small percentage given city's population.

But civil unrest makes majority population (who protesting) stay home avoiding confrontation protesters/police.

Essentially protesters act social-distancing enforcement main group population.

TLDR: vast majority US population avoided protests. everyone else. virus. Here’s idea: maybe people joke respect people lose jobs simultaneously. concept! Parents vacation'd Ohio. Yep, they'll quarantining two weeks coming see new cat. we’re constantly told New York lying numbers make Trump look bad. People made point go hospitals film 5 seconds empty parking lot scream “There’s virus here. Doctors nurses can’t busy they’re posting tons TikTok videos” virus going away PERIOD. 

No flu ""goes away"" completely. Mattis absolutely nothing like Bolton comment makes fool you. see based citizenship, thought country origin. Yikes Title says protests caused spike, article says """"It's still possible protests may caused increase spread virus"".

So... What's take away here? it’s scary. It’s bullshit. look headline. Houston hospitals run ICU beds? 

It’s false it’s laughable. realize would happen couldnt get people ICU covid otherwise? 

Houston huge city metric fuck ton hospitals clinics. 

What bunch horseshit article I'm glad I've working yoga social distancing stick head legs kiss ass goodbye. realize anyone look profile right? You’re white racist conservative PA. Enjoy ongoing protest:) love comparison. ""generic"" influenza estimates 3rd deadly disease recorded history, behind spanish flu black plague.

It disease take seriously widely vaccinate every year, still kills 40-60k Americans, 250-500k worldwide.

Only we've dealing 3 months really, already hit worldwide kill count bad flu *year*, vastly surpassed US kill count bad flu *year*.

So every metric imaginable worse 3rd worst disease ever hit humankind, even somehow still convinced ""just flu"" fine, instead worse tied 3rd worst disease ever. That's fucking terrible.

Not mention overwhelming evidence suggests state governments suppressing body counts (why Florida 3x many pneumonia deaths year year record?)

The people concerned looking statistics. people aren't... know probably looking bird video squirrel putting nuts mouth trying figure 4 piece puzzle something... someone tries organize collective urban garden, say far clear future practice.

* first all, require intensive work low productivity, lifecycle assessments show industrial farming much much better reduce GES overall pollution. urban garden, work small quantities, bring fertilizer, water... far away, work small scale. So, use much gas energy per calorie food produced.
* nuisances choice life style. good garden messy. brings insects, compost produce smells. gardening standpoint want those. urban dweller standpoint.
* scaling: reasoning simple: city meant dense place, thus there's much room grow stuff. rooftop may sustain 1 family, 20 families living underneath, work. So, may reduce need industrial farming 1/20th, still need pretty much agricultural infrastructure feed everyone.

Unless habitat redesigned scratch accomodate density local production food, can't work. see quite teenagers around neighborhood hang out, smoke weed, wear masks. them. Helathy person means covid involved least problems. don’t get county health officials GETTING DEATH THREATS it’s okay??? LA, OC, San Bernardino county health directors death threats levied them. It’s absolutely fucking ridiculous lack spine people come bat shit insane Karen’s ignorant people. region New York phase 3 reopening. allowed indoor restaurants open today, restrictions. 

While rest country different, NY seeing steady decline cases. number positive tests going down, up, we’re increasing testing everyone. 

It’s good question asked, despite temperature checks testing still make staff wear masks, prevent transmission cases couldn’t identify. Even so, testing shows healthcare workers lower average rate infection, tells us PPE working properly. procedures place clean everything keep distancing, feel confident getting checkups. I'm fairly confident need us could probably produce oxygen faster icu's could use it. industries use oxygen reasons could probably converted produce medical industry. wasnt media. Literally thousands public health officials signed letter saying ""this okay."" 

They basically ensured ""public health official"" seen political, partisan role, ensured future even people ignore recommendations. Stunningly bad decision part. Sorry head buried fat pile oil money - gov. Abbot, probably bad person feeling friend all? I've reached point Im fed feel like people going reap sow whatever consequences face sympathy. never said everyone get tested. merely said CAN. asked parents get tested. not. exactly reason stated. 

People get tested. they? decision decide. continuously astonished common argument is. Go look case curve, see sharp incline followed long, slow decline. decline, cases accumulate, deaths accumulate. Arizona first sharp incline, deaths work 2-3 week delay case counts. deaths soon start accumulating, time Arizona back New York daily case numbers, deaths per million look much similar. Ugh, feel Fremdschämen whole country? deeply embarrassing now. rest world, especially Sweden's neighbors, view *its* herd immunity strategy ""madness"".

FWIW article written Danish entitled 

#Sweden follows voice reason: Anders Tegnell face madness?

and picture madness laying fate Sweden hands Anders Tegnell, who, even crisis, made terrible mistake, went Somalia, crisis escalated? Swedes' first press conference week virus infection could hardly contained Danish mindset.

I thnik one country (Sweden) going international European consensus perhaps th emad one here... Arizona 85% full icu regular admission beds.

Hospitals cancelling elective surgeries except same-day surgeries.

Trump held huge rally yesterday nobody wearing masks packed auditorium

Am surgeon Phoenix. get daily updates form hospital admins seems super optimistic. understand sweden deaths coronavirus total number deaths country line April figures 2015-19.

Why even matter? statistic meaningless clearly way covid conspiracy theorists make false claim pandemic isn’t dangerous. utterly laughable. would negative impacts patient outcomes, data support that.

2 persons 9 moved died. Thats ~80% survival. Please provide source represents worse outcome, compared overall Corona ICU outcomes. Correct I'm wrong, even 100% efficacious, antibodies would still likely make COVID19 infection less severe since immune system recognize quicker produce severe immune response.

So basically, vaccine still helpful long producing antibodies even make immune. doctor, though, sure. Switched :) Thanks thoughts someone FL. angry. Yes, statistic initially cited European countries, therefore followed statistic Europe whole. I'm failing see point making.

A governing body consisting many European countries making decision based European data. Would rather break statistic countries EU? even fewer new cases point, support point even strongly.

Really feels like splitting hairs avoid truth here. ""Wear mask public""

I think people might crazy

/s know it’s biggest deal, boyfriend cancel cruise Norway we’ve planning years. Luckily nothing booked, can’t go next year I’m really going heartbroken. strategy hide COVID cases hilarious admin plagued leaks, plus nurses doctors post hospital capacity social media Would spoken still office? No.

Stop giving credit cowards speak convenient them. Bolton, Tillerson, them.

Our government full cowards see happening first hand everyday since 2016 care careers safety America future. Yeah, kinda get dude. lack federal leadership, stupidity people hard comprehend me. certainly seems way area. seems people ""covid19 hoax"" ""quarantine vaccine"" shifting common ground ""it's going happen anyway let kill gonna kill"". 267 people US die yesterday? Relax tough guy. know never speak way people real life, lol. Sure, I'll re-think much control situation. 

I still wear mask go out, leave house little possible. I'm also fully away make little difference point. Yes that's right. Bring COVID again, that's worked EU economies. Oakland better San Fransico far affordable living, pretty much thing point? whole making joke expense people losing jobs doesn’t sit well me. says stop testing. Stopping testing miracle Covid-19 cure white house. Direct white house. soon city stops testing, bam! one case Covid-19. Try it. Seeing believing. think first important thing consistent mask use. Consider case salon two employee tested positive covid infected zero customers. wore masks thoroughly scrubbed work stations clients none clients got sick.

I would venture say protests moderate crowds wearing masks outdoors may well acceptable. people claiming numbers fudged Chicago plenty protests still spike one thing Chicago upfront numbers.

Even anti-lockdown protests seem cause spike. 

Every major spreading event uninfected people close quarters sick person extended period time family parties, church gatherings, funerals, choir practices, people working factories warehouses, grocery stores, etc...

The simple truth outdoor events may danger. know better, would say work place. Lol. required go back 6/15 though. But, yeah, everything else exactly same. 

We given masks free want them, I'm wearing buff way comfortable. highly recommend alternative. wear like scarf I'm desk, I've never felt stylish office. Haha. die. Freedom handed due virus. Stupid fucking liberals.

Hope go first. 9000! happens people stop caring. also getting new records. Go paint toys, adults talking. seen discussed much, new research infection rates pretty striking. think risk infected household member 15% able relax bit catching Uber Eats public-health officials instituted isolation infected individuals quarantine contacts, people age 20 5.2% risk infected member household, compared 14.8% risk people aged 20–59 18.4% risk people aged 60 above. 

 Ok? doesn’t mean isn’t billed it. Imagine inferring something never said Abbott wanted reopen schools governers mansion still limits tours guests.... he's cunt treated Yeah exactly.. NY tried things little late, still responded. Texas flat refused anything. Given lack testing, I’d multiply number **atleast** 10x. wouldn’t trust numbers olympics still 2021. There’s much incentive downplay Covid. posted Houston recently, two days till icu full, two weeks surge icu full. enjoy spreading misinformation?  showed mom actually works UTSW said it’s lie, currently 36 inpatient still lots capacity. Big difference 10% 90%, enough info right know. Phase 3 help sure true though. dont think numbers. look things like city safety perceptions, people live cities often mentioned negatively media (shootings example) often higher safety perception regarding city people read city papers, example. sure applies though. 2 3 largest US cities seeing major declines too. post Dallas subreddit talking *already* happening. Apparently one COVID patients took turn worst ventilators available.

\#staythefuckinside NYC likely herd immunity would mean 15 16 million New Yorkers would gotten infected already. nearly double cases reported world. Think it. No, means higher death rate spoke incorrect. That’s sleep apnea SpO2 level 😬 Seeing BNO back, takes back dark days March April. anyone know means people dual citizenship/ people EU citizens living US? really wish mattis ran primary trump. state handled abysmally 

I keep thinking back (Austin) city wide mask orders. short period time, almost everyone wearing mask least everywhere saw (wasn't going many places, still). Abbott said cities allowed mask orders, quickly people longer bothered put mask. willing wear mask, need little bit enforcement. Mask usage incredibly low, impossible get people use despite region COVID hotspot.

This like perfect confluence many crappy parts human nature.

There's ""it happen me"" optimism bias people realize have.

Then there's ""I'm invincible"" optimism bias people realize have.

Then people want feel smarter everyone else, everyone telling wear mask, saying ""mask wearing useless/harmful/for sheep"" gives people superiority.

Then there's sheer laziness getting mask remembering bring everywhere.

And there's discomfort level. Wearing mask uncomfortable, people can't tolerate uncomfortable can't deal that.

Plus lot people dumb, make bigger factor.

I really think unless made mandatory impossible make people US wear masks. trip grocery store yesterday intriguing recently passed ordinance businesses require masks, literally everyone store wearing one, past almost one was. understand. articles saying immunity last talking specific antibody long term defense, difference body fighting remembering fight it. IcG vs Memory cells something? I'm virologist. 

Shitty analogy, someone smarter please correct understood incorrectly.....Basically like fight virus came vault door, body makes soldiers fight off, gone closes door. little gets rid soldiers still protected door closed now. articles basically writing ""study shows body loses soldiers quickly"" ignoring door closed that's supposed happen. issue B) \*you virus 14 days know it\*. Even think ""clean"". Hell, people never show symptoms. go life thinking causing problems, could spreading virus others, spread others they're asymptomatic, basically we're seeing numbers infected US. There's saying may heard: ""an ounce prevention worth pound cure"". mask uncomfortable worst, much better preventing spread literally nothing. person uninfected shit hit fan NYC, ran several ICU drugs, including fentanyl propofol. Docs dig back pharm books try find ways maintain good sedation, knows well worked? Plus take sedation breaks check readiness vent weaning, people constantly. Getting vent pretty taxing best times. 

There several articles written late March, early April drug shortages. one mentor's patients highlighted interviewed article post-ICU PTSD. takes 3-4 weeks people die = long hospital stays = hospitals overwhelmed = people dying unnecessarily due lack resources (this trying avoid lockdown). hope deaths spike much would expect maybe 1) higher percentage newly infected younger people 2) maybe we're getting better treating it? Fingers crossed Oh man, came comments post thing word word. Well Warrior monk (his preferred nickname). He’s well read intelligent, sure that’s surprise. age group would vote trump quite impacted next months FL TX. enough convince vote elsewhere atleast population reduced significantly... great catch22 trumps idiotness 😀 Get apple make masks logo it. Say helps reception. Also supreme company. Whatever hell make Like time said recommendations guidelines regarding tested? people state hated this, makes sense me. doubters say, ""people dying cancer!""  Literally tho, guy hometown went hospital something unrelated. got Covid died.  fact. close him, I've house. surprising people still argue hearing story. Ignoring wishing virus away wont make vanish. already stats disprove narrative, there's way explain away current excess mortality rates. care they're forced care. true. avid mask-wearer, done much personally keep family clear thing (main reason son type 1 diabetic), even Ohio recently announced pop-up testing sites would opening soon, little voice back head thinking '.....*I want know*'. US reach 40-45k daily cases next week. We’re getting started don’t honestly know point. beyond point masks alone get control *think* point trying make anything clear cut statistics, showing obvious trend towards disaster, nothing could construed spin attached, going attacked disengenuous. added complication single drop perceived mud water used throw evidence.

If case agree you, thank clarifying point. might ask bit careful wording pronouns, though. look poster comment chain able twist statement make seem calling TMC telling lies get clicks, actually opposite. medical personnel say ""The dangerous thing do"" think data already present needed support claim. Everyone acting like suspending elective surgeries something willy nilly.

There reports two month lockdown could set cancer treatment screening back decade. real human cost suspending procedures lead deaths, maybe now, maybe even year, people die able get care. ding ding ding.

even moratorium lifted, mgmt company harasses behalf landlord currently sitting 10x many vacant units normal (they normally 2-4 properties vacant website, 44). 

I 6-unit small complex silicon valley (MV, within walking distance google plex). 2 units sat empty months. wanted 5k month place next door, LOL price. rotting overpriced 3900/month.

NO utilities included. 45k post-tax dollars, get pay water, sewer, trash, recycling, gardening. know argument bad resort ad hominem attacks. [Masks lower transmission rates There’s many studies saying much. That's thing, something done many country did.

I understand grim calculus front us, deaths vs economy. part I'm glad older family members safe even might lose job end this.

If talking poor country I'd open take point Sweden means weather covid without anyone dying hunger. Park gates welded shut NY prevent gatherings. People could attend funerals weddings bc rona. Public transit almost shut bunch NE cities. Air travel stopped. ‘You grandma killer’. People UK fined brraking lockdowns. People france carry paper stating reason out...
That nail salon protests idiotic, agree. pb here. protests given free pass bc cause deemed just, think agree well no? Rona didnt disappear Floyd killed yet protests ‘right’ one peeped. simply trying say different standard applied legally justified. discuss ethics want please remember test validity US first amendment can’t know it. Latency period 2 plus weeks. means point find it, 2 weeks. you’re wearing mask time frame spreading 2 weeks. House rules? translated every language already appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* brother law constantly talking ""academic"" posting links ""studies"" masks completely ineffective dangerous.

The sad thing is, matter happens, half population US dies coronavirus, would still never convinced anything trump Young Living upline tell him. lives complete bubble, views absolutely unaffected reality point. Along huge portion US. Yeah, like July. happens people don’t invest government agencies benefit public good. Even CDC Director question, Redfield, example poor leadership. Dude qualified job widely panned appointed. promoted bogus vaccine worked VA, crusader homosexuals military, part AIDS “ABCs” program Africa.

This country got stop promoting anti scientific hacks positions authority. It’s killing us corona, kill us later climate change. really need examine priorities nation think want want achieve purpose. actually pretty good read, thanks posting it, gives sort insight. way people treated US knees, I'd worried... U/datacollect_ct got pwnd 3 different users. Fatality! say please stay safe! afraid going like New York City, sirca March April. quick :) least happened NY little bit sudden. Yes saw happening warned, people really much experience knowing react. 

Other states months *knowing* distance, wear masks, etc. hammered heads every day. *chose* ignore it. Horrific. curious see precautions like wearing mask gloves work working you? would think would protect enough broke unemployed. think going drag quite time. going new normal Texas. “lockdown” delay moment. could used time educate people prepare. didn’t. used divide pseudo political 
Factions could lob insults other. 

Meanwhile every healthcare workers voice gone we’ve screaming top lungs coming. older workers wondering it’s time retire get out. newbies overwhelmed wondering made right choice. rest us revising wills trying keep friends family far away shit show possible. 

There going back this. People think infection bell shaped curve cases fall rapidly rose. don’t. Patient don’t bounce back quickly back side weeks months prolonged overcapacity hospital. going long hard slog medical Community Texas. among world leaders testing per capita though. Trumps probably silencing them. Ok. I'm probably freaking that's do. I'm chronic allergy sufferer, could definitely allergies (they bad live). 

Yesterday keep clearing throat. it. 
Today nowhere go coughing fit. coughing stops, started feel plegmy chest throat. nose got stuffy. I've also mild diarrhea past week. 

Not sure that's enough get tested. otherwise feel fine. 
Honestly, I'm scared need tested. boss (who work closely) terrified getting sick. tells constantly. I'm really really scared would react told felt like needed tested. mother refuses wear mask says because, one asked wear mask 1968 Yeah, im advocate BLM mental gymnastics think didnt make dent What's option? say shutdown require masks since know late Masks mitigation measure community spread exists. Containment contract tracing work exclusive method extensive community spread. Duh No, that's all. learned nothing that's take away. 

Good luck there. friend heart kidney damage. “mild” (ie hospitalized) case 40’s. Masks give many people terrible anxiety worried permanence measures. try hard, european would trade mutualized healthcare US one. According subreddit, daily cases never went down... could up? it, lets war bond parades also, really make like 1918! /S/ test meant know got it, that's almost irrelevant.

It's meant say Hey, exposed virus, test go around exposing people too, check already contact military absolutely paid propaganda op. like money could better used healthcare anything. majority cases showed within last 14-21 days data. That’s why. Plus everyone lined along route spectators. People Hong Kong lol. hear looking new place. I've accepted visiting folks back Phoenix rest year earliest. Probably we're post-vaccine. I'm extra-bummed decided visit last fall chance, time I've seen it'll three years. Historia Magistra Vitae, not. Article 13(2) Universal Declaration Human Rights right leave country, including own, return country.

So yes, fundamental human right able leave country return country citizenship. reasonable exceptions, obviously, like arrest.

&amp;#x200B;

Some countries, like North Korea, restrictions citizens leaving country. violation international human rights implemented brutal dictatorship imagine Canada would want copy policy.

&amp;#x200B;

So said, Canada stop citizens leaving go USA returning. individual countries able choose immigration policy regarding non-citizens. Therefore solution problem respects human rights countries stop others' citizens entering first place order prevent Covid-19 spreading across border. problem would dual citizens, hopefully enough travelling virus make major difference. many deaths?  guidelines vary province province, specifically mention post examples various guidelines may apply.

People alling liar claiming recommendations all, false. tldr controlled instincts animal nature, reason. wonder many 1000s black people ultimately killed went protest black person getting killed. disingenuous argument focuses unimportant ""anti-lockdown"" argument. thousands people loved ones die alone, never funeral, never got say goodbye families? People werent even allowed VISIT sick loved ones? You’ll drive crazy expect logic situations. Conservative media manipulating people saying want hear years. incredibly susceptible this.... others. Logic can’t override need self-preservation even aren’t good job self preservation. It’s def frustrating tho. ￼ skills country would want lol. kind moron voted arsehole office? got email saying results posted, log check report see result. Two months ago telling us masks work. confidence pretty low. one tool, isolation, maybe hand gel. know course masks work countries used done well. gives hope, quickly shattered people think masks religion (religion political party). They’ll close cause won’t customers maybe you’re anonymous coward racist. Oooo. 1 story. Go nit pick somewhere else. feel really bad sound mind weed good vs bad understand sometimes everything 100% right. Grow up. I’m expecting soar new highs (as infections soar) country hunt polio vaccination teams cause lost. fall?

It happening *now*. claim things would better summer get worse cooler weather another one Trump's idiot wishes come true. live nearby Asian grocery store, they're requiring everyone wear mask--been like since March think. Anyway, that's store I've shopping groceries past months literally said city/county enact measure strict state mandated, cities can't even lock anymore. Population adjusted Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina recently sneakily near top Dont forget drink bleach problem state making everyone go back work. safety net. cannot choose shelter place cashier needs feed family. truly sacrificed economy. disturbing watch military hero crowd turn second came support wearing masks. options? Lehman Brothers making record breaking profits isn't, makes puzzling. Yes strongly considering it. family lived UK child actually preferred living US recently. However, past year shown society rotten top, fundamental levels decency compassion fellow humans. know UK bit turbulent right I’m strongly considering getting MD States practicing elsewhere. Especially Trump re-elected, woman color feel like life stake. Fucking ouch, bro.  sOluTioN CaNt woRsE ProBlEM Random fact: Spanish Flu roughly 2.5X casualties WW1 (~ 50M 20M respectively) wife retired doctor used manage practice. almost always mask around neck put place needed extra gloves pockets. Fresh gloves every patient. 

People bitching wearing mask go grocery shopping clue professionals deal with. Better 17k spreading it, flatten curve we’re still trying get rid full likely indeed. China authoritarian dictatorship can/will whatever want without resistance. 

If resistance shown, people seen anymore. 

So absolutely, right. Thank ! years years people would complain scientific research done mostly white do, damned don't. ""human civilization"" oh happens good old USA, everywhere else inhuman savagery. New Zealand zero cases, right? Let take upholding human civilization time stay home. 265 May 21 sounds like recording error, severe problems May. Regardless, Florida fucked lockdown soon. People comply masks/social distancing. county Iowa saw biggest increase cases yesterday ever whole yet. one cares! one worried slightest. go work, wear mask, put gloves on, nearly every customer maskless. It’s ridiculous. Maybe one death far, it’s worrying people. want choose coronavirus thing past, it’s not. county alone cases entire countries. says lot, doesn’t it? can’t another 4 years this. Someone help move Ireland please can't help wonder ""MSM"" ""classic news"" makes feel urge talk regularity, across many subreddits. Excellent. Let enjoy summer without tourists clogging everything. lives matter! ashes ashes. dust dust ...with mouth wide open worn mask.

Sorry, resist. Gotta 5'6"" - whatever dumb reason. Live CA, don’t understand happening state! 

What said testing isn’t necessarily true am. big spike Sunday Monday, percent positive fell back 3% yesterday. Deaths different story, go mid-week, could occurred week ago. Hospitalizations falling. 

On top Americans surging back across border treatment even hard know whether hospitalization numbers county Mexico.

Plus old data keeps coming daily. test results days higher usual (e.g. 10,000 instead 5,000) it’s hard say from.

Community outbreaks up, real pattern outbreaks. Honestly, check world daily chart worldometer, see little (comparatively) bump February China versus now.

We gasped blown numbers blips personally tested people symptoms positive. Fortunately wearing N95 time case. potentially could infect many people. big issue asymptomatic carriers. people smart masks. running near anyone need mask on. close people. always snicker see people wearing masks gloves car alone. silly. Uh oh, read headline Sunday again. guess 2-3 days I'll seeing again. Florida, Texas Arizona weeks worth head start California. player 4 joined game they’ll getting national outrage, least I’d assume so...especially OC town hall circus thought cruise. Bad oil gas tell bad. dad one three employees died. prison workers mental handicapped people get paid don’t make difference minimum wage one ready talk that. meant put /s right? side aisle needs stop granting legitimacy towards opposition. Leaving rental empty also leave vulnerable break-ins squatters, though. Might make sense landlords cut rents order keep tenants residence rather sit empty. number tests reported today 10% higher last Wednesday (27k 24). number cases 100% higher (5500 2600) According Wuhan authority Texas government exceptional student mathematics counting coronavirus related death pioneered Wuhan. pay rents/mortgages would cost fortune business bailouts. seems regional. California hardly see anyone without one. reopening bars restaurants really fucking stupid though. People wear masks eat drink. You’re absolutely insane. friend cystic fibrosis give teaching job next year threat health. Coronavirus absolute death sentence anyone CF. point don’t think concerned believe high risk tackle outbreaks general protect everybody society. don’t know enough virus know effects anyone long term anyone could react negatively Heh, headline actually be: “Obviously, New York City Marathon, world's largest, canceled due pandemic.” think interesting things heard before. Tagnell obviously believes right thing do, apoarently one. says agreed-on best strategy, fear political pressure became great. China locked way countrues could replicate, yet almost every country world attempted measures similar it, without ability monitor, enforce even detect efficacy.

Who others group obliquely refers to, event gathering take place? quote needs context, reporter failed supply it, despite importance implications. Tegnell alone following strategy identified world experts *previous* pandemic, might damn fortunate least one country stuck protocol. Like said, yet.

I also intrigued statement school closures unnecessary, study France seems corroborate that. Hindsight may 20/20, able pivot improve response outbreaks maintaining normalcy children's education may become important realize. Arizonan here. 5% people wear masks everything back normal. town live average population 60 large groups old people congregating. population believes hoax. would thought cases would increasing? I'm shift drink. know household, shifted stocking modest amount beer wine also bottles hard liquor cocktail making since going occasional cocktail option anymore. drinking been, purchasing habits look little different. compulsion. broken? It’s 2% increase time last year. remember April people freaking almost 1/3 renters didn’t pay rent huge drop average usually around 20% sounds worse it’s shockingly kind normal. wonder long term effects going start showing themselves. Yeah weird, go store (in MA) see 99% mask compliance, even though people wearing totally wrong, number wearing totally wrong low.

It's almost like...*gasp*...wearing masks *fucking works*. good thing, many Americans anti science pro “gut instinct” feelings, can’t grasp ebb flow virus. 

Couple America strongly individualist society, many simply don’t give shit people outside household. Taking steps benefit everyone, especially perceived inconvenience (masks), become nonstarter end roughly right now. 

This doesn’t reflect entire country, significant enough portion it. people days think Doctor that...a Doctor. People don’t realize there’s different fields medicine go into. Booster. NYC. find local hospital leased freezer trucks expand morgue know things got real really quick. 

Hopefully recent medical trials improve outcomes people get sick lower mortality rate. assertion data source reporting hits well hit rates unreliable. strong conflict interest right thing atm. protests okay 👌 immunity originally meant enough population immunity vulnerable populations contract disease. really applies vaccinations, real way keep vulnerable populations natural spread. 

These days, seems taken different meaning, people get disease. also never happened, populations location would tend get diseases like plague smallpox waves still. 

And things like chicken pox, everybody contracted it. That's sort immunity - people got it. That's overall ranking individual hospitals. go look specialties see Houston hospitals near top lot. Texas Medical Center literally largest medical center world. yeah, said stretch all. really media problem. really twist truth days causes horrible reprocussions. That's correct. says would unlikely US would excepted ban.
From article disruptions caused ban, European officials involved talks said highly unlikely exception would made United States. said criteria creating list acceptable countries deliberately kept scientific nonpolitical possible. Including United States now, officials said, would represent complete flouting bloc’s reasoning. said United States could added later list, revised every two weeks based updated infection rates. small pool people.

Yes thankfully 9 persons needed moving seems. seem rate survival people ICU. believe possible say moving negative impact survival. Boom roasted. disagree Trump plan, whatsoever. dont people picture, seem drive testing have

Under conditions would rather work healthcare provider. Good thing charge then. Second wave incoming bois Dude people tested world lol. I'm guessing developed Africa tested there. No. love guy more! Well everything bigger Texas Strangely, know 2 people confirmed cases covid neither cough fever far. Lots fatigue muscle aches. ""Many researches""? quote sources please? criticize administration work good chance get fired. unfortunately means want maintain positive influence direction policy staying position keep criticisms internal 'nanny state' tendencies Australia. totally get mean. couple idiots refuse bullshit conspiracy theory read facebook guess many since masks mandatory, think stores let without one unless exempt. hate wearing mask too. get super tired soon leave store, take need oxygen. necessary wear mask indoors stop virus, fuck decide I'm good wear it? None us like course idiots make everything ruin things everyone.  Spanish flu mortality rate estimated around 2-10% depending source. COVID-19 converging around 0.5-1% factor age majority world much, much lower. They're really comparable except fact global virus.

If average people dropping like flies would treated totally differently. 90 days extremely long time trying model anything potential exponential growth short period. One friends compared trying predict birth rate--relatively easy predict year two now, really difficult predict accuracy 100 years now. models COVID like latter situation, trying predict happen weeks out. Blindly advocating people color socially distance effectively dooming them.



I said nothing racist. quotes article. Using black people political pawns immoral unethical. Social distancing won’t work schools, especially school like 2000 kids packed narrow hallways. worst people take fact science based updating based new evidence proof failure. old beliefs found wrong based new data. means doubters science must always wrong. life like religion, believe something day 1 eternally correct unchanging. Let give piece mind that's insurance industry works. Insurance companies make quite bit money two sources considering: investments reinsurance. 

They get capital invest multiple sources including premiums pay since manufacturing cost associated insurance policy alot wiggle room throw money around. financial crisis 2008 saw maybe 20 insurance companies go nothing grand scheme things vast majority small. happens insurance companies either acquired larger insurance company, sell book business get bailed like AIG.

Reinsurance one insurance company insures another. yes insurance companies buy policies insurance companies protect themselves. often come form typical liability policies, also financial reinsurance policies great form protection insurance companies since profits vary wildly year year due many factors. Russia? Contact tracing would work maybe thousand cases, strict mask use, actual army contact tracers. simply many new cases via community spread, masks, opening insanity. Sometimes something very, bad happen people understand. might going there. people lose close relatives finally stop bitching wearing mask? could tje case mean literally, ok, changed wording. That's going handle testing, issue work basically every time testing available. I'd tell I'd either late work. attitude like that, neither you. think sort unintentionally hit nail head here...I don’t think virus ‘slower moving people anticipated’, think states reopened, people still taking *some* precautions wasn’t immediate spike, people interpreted threat gone (its “I walked outside umbrella didn’t even get wet, guess never needed umbrella” mentality). Nevertheless, agree many southern states continue current trajectory, cruel summer indeed. Holy shit, blowing faster cover up. Holy fuck! 

And still fully open!

I feel state, sister Sarasota. gotta get there. worse shit show. 



Difference werent hurting anyone. saw photo place Galveston recently, even though complying occupancy limits, manager put people one section. thought, “Are people getting it?” 

&amp;#x200B;

No, people indeed getting it. best case scenario likely use effective contact tracing testing distribute vaccine people may infected first. Italy, South Korea, China, states like NY, CT, already effective systems could facilitate line. 2 though. wrong well obviously NY similar took draconian (needed) measures fairly early ensure numbers dropped. ""Everywhere Else"" done that. continue increase rate currently increasing see truly terribly outcome US absolutely worse France Italy terms deaths economically. Stock market US remarkably resilient thanks, large part, sweeping actions fed (I suspect) knowledge short term problem losses likely temporary. said, no, us ""recovered better anywhere else"" many, many countries recovering quickly effectively US. I'll absolutely need source 96% GDP borrowing rate I'm pretty sure actually mean anything I'm curious saw number. “In addition onsite pharmacy testing, CVS also offer symptom screenings, flu vaccines immunizations add-on services like contact tracing employees exposed virus.” actually interesting way looking it. can't verify math definitely worth someone looking into. I'd make one change though, look covid, look excess deaths overall run calculations out. measures social injustice, social mobility, almost nonexistence social safety net, police violence, governmental accountability, education, infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, general access healthcare... Basically quality life measures US ranks dead last compared industrialized nation. blows mind still people believe covid real care enough protect others. Kinda funny whole reason americans didnt want shut business. countries gonna want business looong time top probably 1 million dead end summer. 

Sweden tried similar tactic, crying neighbouring countries shutting out. hurting businesses hard, countries opening europe sweden leaving Island, america gonna get treatment 100x worse tough part papers written friendly public. Unless familiar subject, could specialized, quickly get lost sea numbers, jargon references. eventually become dependant others interpreting you. FACTS. important stats spread covid, deaths. Footlocker going sue city interesting thing I'm coming also coming china, province right next door Hubei province. true, hold hostage. Great news! Spain two antibody studies, first one 5%, second one (about month later) saw tiny increase 5.2%. think another European country reported going 5% 10% couple months can't recall one now, case sampling truly random I'm sure reliable was. list antibody prevalence see   Show article says people died moving them.

She said dangerous.

You added editorialization ment worse outcomes patients supported article Sweden: 5,161 deaths / 511 deaths per million

Finland: 327 deaths / 59 deaths per million

Norway: 248 deaths / 46 deaths per million

Denmark: 603 deaths / 104 deaths per basic fucking shit can't even that.

Precisely, I'm tired every fucking excuse use. Japan perfect example citizens stopping spread government step enough. here, we've got large number people outright follow guidelines. anything greater good, inconveniences ever slightly. Fuck all. want virus hit them, increase chance piles shit infect innocent people. 

But certainly wish good health. hope karma comes back viciously ever them. Teaches lesson collective personal responsibility, totally lost them. Lata, suckas! correct.

If look factors, still can't choose US yet.

As far economy, arguably best thing economy control virus. government liable essentially wasting months lock down. Clearly, contrasted countries put lot place “flatten curve” phase.

Or, author wants give excuse hold double standard- make health choices others, govt must make mask choices them. really tyrant? Sadly debates (i) scientifically true (ii) policies legislation respond scientific truth overlap. can't win facts, one side frequently resorts questioning sides facts, rather difficult mature debate facts. GA. I’m scared kids. can’t believe schools won’t even bother requiring mask ffs. virus threat unless already dying pre-existing conditions. People risk long overdue ready get back normal lives upholding human civilization. People risk need careful. also lot slower put safety regulations effect enforce them, AZ right now. well AZ.

However, surprise; 59% Americans say living paycheck-to-paycheck. **FIFTY NINE PERCENT** Seems like tests heavily biased toward people concerned they've contact summertime infected, linked website indicates. claiming difference protesters tested general public tested, demonstrated difference exists. like, opinion, man.

Except instead pileup site far side rise foggy night, clear sunny day great visibility there's someone passenger seat screaming ""FOR LOVE GOD SLOW DOWN"" may well ghost attention paid driver. aren’t putting mouths drinks (hopefully). touch transmission low, goes step beyond that. Personally, best solution stay close home, go outside, nobody else around, need supplies. overly pedantic term ""lockdown"". businesses shuttered two months+, indeed form lockdown, everyone understands point made term ""lockdown"" used within context covid-19 shuttering businesses staying quarantined. 


No, disengenous, willfully ignorant trying change narrative fit purposes. Notice attempt clarify lockdown means people held gunpoint die accidental weapon discharge purposeful murder gun COVID 19

I cannot begin unravel point trying make cases certainly undercounted, death count far concrete. It’s likely deaths underreported, particularly beginning outbreak.

At home deaths &amp; nursing homes swept rug countries, particularly US, postmortem testing done early stages outbreak &amp; continues unavailable today. 

Postmortem testing expensive &amp; many countries see waste money since person already deceased. Autopsies done majority cases either. 

There also confounding cause death died complications preexisting conditions, whose death certificate may accurately attribute death coronavirus even though precipitating factor. 

A lack systematic approach &amp; inability test every person makes much likely deaths counted &amp; underreported, trend unfortunately continue. Phil Murphy basically polar opposite Desantis. Every decision made cautiously oh well. response pretty necessary helping understand. TIL Government reserves used campaigning elections. Probably, previous governments state governments missed trick. bound happen guys, big state. half ass lockdowns screwed you, much opening up. Love this. sweetie read yesterday Florida's positive rate ~10% today ~15.8%. Since know likelihood getting infected Coronavirus closer 1%, clearly under-testing/under-reporting. It’s hard grasp calamity China exported world virus . Fuck.  Surprisingly, death rates low. even remotely comparable death rates New England states spring. say it’s younger people, Florida land retirees. many infected young people heck retirees staying clean? r/wallstreetbets  But... thought kids get transmit easily open schools worries? 9000 corona deaths germany. 
120000 USA. 
You would need 10 times population comparable.
The USA Trump fucked up.
2,25mio 4 less 10mio, numbers dream of?
xD % positive LA County good, 10%. testing enough. 

And 10 million people. 

Not bad AZ far testing goes good outlook. plus side, prosecutors offices defense firms/public defenders offices plenty jobs available going forward muh covid 19 Scared? No. Concerned Americans' well health? Yes.  
Unless full blown asshole. Disagree. ""spike"" cases began month ago. People bringing Arizona Texas May. Even lag seeing increase deaths already. AR exhibited increase deaths, others declining including AZ, FL, TX.  

I'm saying continue cautious I'm antI mask gung ho trump guy, trying point deceived continually media. Yeah that's issue, gotten bad people convinced bad  discussing hospital (pharmacy) thankfully stock Midazolam/Propofol/Precedex rotating. day whatever could get.

Now shitton Propofol Precedex scary. Good luck like hundred inmates figured submit request 

You submit request... list auto-generated tax rolls. Jeez. /r/LosAngeles sub, seems like tests coming back almost exactly 24 hours them. family decided go Florida dining restaurants. begged least takeout. crazy. Work remote much possible. Extend unemployment benefits. Require face masks public. 


Or let bunch people get killed. I'm 60 really care. Yeah, even glitch continuous downward trend am, either. like there's inverse correlation wealth common sense lol rate, thing around two three years like Spanish Flu was. Hopefully soon different president gets office enter state emergency full lock down. Meanwhile bumbling fool entered state emergency illegal immigrants keep country running. saying goes, everything's bigger Texas. Somewhat alarming, definitely would understand gym isn’t encouraging masks. really sucks heavy lifts mask on, obviously excuse avoid wearing times like these. Luckily, anyone immunocompromised know takes precautions every flu season anytime something like comes around, stayed safe every animal flu last 30 years. fine now. hand, family members lives currently wrecked income factor familial stress put on. But, go on. Ignore problems dont fit narrative half percent death rate amongst pop 7 billion. assholes helped radicalize right wing can't control lunacy. TIL Corona actual town California. may wish find strengthen immune system, please go read great articles found http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/index.shtml.

I hope people find useful. 

Peace. don’t get choose saving economy crushing virus. virus disrespected happily destroy economy own. Right implies morality. Wearing mask rational decision based scientific findings. Right nothing it. Yes yes get it. Yeah, yahoos hot zone states start infecting folks New York State, could see happening. center received flurry positive results June 19. led someone filing complaint, Nelson said. complaint led inspection ODJFS, found center violation far reporting first cases COVID-19 timely fashion.  Yeah I'm mystic area, gets crazy busy Summer Fall. Disney’s website reservations waiting room right due demand BINGO

I OP.

I sick fucking anti intellectual mentality America. Typically morons never inflict damage themselves. Well cant gaslight virus magicial properties prayer fucking useless.

Chickens come home roost. moron America gets pay piper might clunkily mix metaphors.

This shit happens school gets shot up. time blame!! 
 
FUCK THAT. Time get business leaders Texas, Florida Arizona. 3 share stubborn strain American Stupidity.  I'm donating negative $20 bc fuck guy know NJ talking about. see anyone wearing masks around me. opened public pool Clark people swarming outdoors without distancing state parks such. bit misrepresentation far concerned. bounce regain least half tomorrow. Yes. governor, lieutenant governor, etc actively interfering cities counties enacting mask requirements. Insane.

#AbbottResign 
#AbbottBetrayedTexas Can't get hospital tests done hospital full *points temple* think problem US. Many hospitals Oxygen plants on-site on-demand supply, there's extensive distribution network get delivered bottles / via tankers produced on-site. literally pulled air, issue equipment available it.

The article talks poorest regions world on-site 02 production networks distribution bottled O2, prices skyrocketing result. Areas millions people poorly equipped facilities.

This another case thinking US 3rd world country respects... truly grasping bad 3rd world countries. Lmao. Please keep going. Keep proving I'm right. southern shit hole from? Tennessee? must love Trump. call bigot (im not) yet I'm sure worship Trump. Enjoy Coronavirus since state thinks ""its flu"". see point making agree you. kinda strayed original point.

 thing bothers people follow speed limits (from I've seen). pandemic literally shutting world. countries (USA) administration handled terribly. dont like quarentine. Wearing masks proven help stop spread along social distancing. People wearing masks lengthening quarentine. Also virus people truly awful miserable. dont wish fellow humans. I'm young relatively healthy. I'm wearing mask me. personal feelings freedoms. experts saying need stop spread protect vulnerable population. 

I bet traffic safety expert came right said ""you following speed limits safety road communities!"" people would go ""....um well yeah course."" Instesd ""it's right speed! Dont take muh freedum!""

I appreciate civil discourse fellow human. feel pretty much page. Turns gaslight max setting

Wait second... gaslighting turning gas *down*? feel like I'm gaslighted. Like.... fucks sake. Northeast basically locked *a month least*. Massachusetts *just*started opening back up.

You would think would serve lesson population he’s dealing with. I’d elaborate more, typed long post background people auto deleted labeled P-word... repeated thing posted me, what, two days ago? complaining?

The headline somewhat misleading lend push potential weakening virus narrative.

This good news Florida given many cases now. mean that’s really really high number least deaths low hope don’t spike strongly agree. Yes, absolutely sucks nursing homes ravaged, proper mask rule we'd probably already done it. 70 numbers awful. nearly apocalyptic internet seems wish were. definitely issues cost whom?

The powerful insulated direct consequences disease (they're neither going ones dying covid ones starving lack work), ability achieve political aims depends never admitting government could afford better job taking care citizens currently does.

They're going anything. Even means tens thousands additional corpses. know won’t we’re taking current one seriously. ""Epidemiologists attributed upticks infections hospitalizations changes behavior, including lax mask use less social distancing.""

Sadly, much increased cases could've minimized people ignorant brazen whole thing, esp. mask wearing social distancing. Hawaii also great job That's definitely horrible situation.  Best luck you. Trump - ""Pin blame hombres"" Yes know common outcome permanent lung damage? lung scans post-covid patients? California fucking real bad mean one root issues virus us today exist vacuum. Quite opposite actually. getting affect her. position letting ""idiots"" good anybody. Many us getting forced back workplaces share space people. It’s study 100% success rate fucking Wuhan Institute Biological Products China National Biotec Group (CNBG), affiliated China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm). Color skeptical, doc 4 days Old news, yet still relevant “We hope bring number soon less testing.” even post: ""My state, Mass, going up. curve flattened back April since"" ... got downvoted. Massachusetts better right deserves downvote?

Admittedly, list every state rise know offhand every state's stats, perhaps used word ""only""... I'll go give 20 lashings belt penance sin. always case, level national crisis see open. can't lockdown, need fucking serious contactless everything keeping economy going. Masks NEED mandated, question. get decide file unemployment man. 40 hours certain period time 20 may eligible. 

They telling can't, businesses penalized someone collects unemployment. like car insurance company raising rates three years get accident get money back. 🤣 hate everything.

PS think lockdown mistake all. believe necessary closing business governments decision. mine. closed lockdown assessing situation decided open. hard understand agree right choice even though huge loss. fair, seems coincidence Trump's statements. reading r/Houston upcoming loss federal funds testing, deadline know since April. appear Trump taking action remove funding. seems like needs happen congress must extend funding past deadline set originally.

Edit: [Link post promise give opinions moral cripple ordered Marine snipers open fire hospital workers ambulances Fallujah consideration deserve. Doctors already started making critical decisions treatment patients cancer, may likely die contract coronavirus infection immune systems compromised chemotherapy.

So going Dr. treat daughter experts right? say daughter higher risk going treatment waiting, decision would make? trust doctors treat cancer, give opinion Covid? “And everyone wear damn mask, like guys are, like right now.""

No doubt Rubio like _Least Favorite Senator Reddit_ type behavior need praise. People mirror leaders every senator starts wearing mask right like gold. Thank Senator Rubio. keep wearing keep vocal it. It’s assumed referring clients testing positive. would confirmed positive Coronavirus considered sick? Like stated, doesn’t make sense. I’m saying don’t surprised lot people area get sick around 4th July. That’s all, I’m saying last week people might wearing masks but, everyone isn’t best shape, healthiest people out. don’t surprised western Washington gets hit protest. know forgot power love unity protect yeah? did. wanted make point good thing hospitals stopped elective surgeries. 

Other people wanted add preferable stop elective surgeries circumstance, bad thing ultimately negative outcomes many people.

You proceeded try argue problem/issue.

That's downplaying, clear bad faith argument. still smart thing stop elective surgeries also bad thing. best available option choice *bad* options.

Welcome reality I'm buying male gender component. Every person know refusing wear mask female Another douchebag.😂 legit question overseas. senators 3rd party independents, elections give one major 2 parties majority form government? also helps form bipartisanship passing certain legislation, rather currently playing two parties slandering yelling one listening cases, smell loss persist months years.

Imagine able taste food properly years seriously asking know true common outcome permanent lung damage, need lung transplant, organ failure etc? Hey now. state thing love/hate relationship mother really soul searching whatsoever done massive surges happening almost exactly ~2 weeks peak protests? There's way correlation ignored honest person, yet posts like still massively upvoted. actually long standing way federal government coerce states compliance. 

If city wants funding, simply enforce law. want follow law, funding Seriously man, everyone need put /s behind every joke reddit 👏👏👏 ""And said - SLOW testing down!"" - Donald Trump, like week ago This. really look states either individually regionally. Like New England combined Tri-state area alright. southest., Texas AZ, great. They’re number one Unfortunately infections occur super spreader events. south rise again, north pay blood.

What year this? started self-isolation SoCal family Texas thought extreme response. week area Texas self-isolation too. Even Im sure thought necessary. Sadly also nurses family (in Arkansas) first also thought going blow ""it's like flu"" Mostly everyone know seems taking seriously now, case couple months ago. 

Even SoCal people seem take pride walking around without mask. get selfish irresponsible respectable?  300k

That's pretty conservative considering already 2.45 million infected 124k dead national leadership. sure get much worse that. Well dropped 700 points. there’s guess? Oh hell yeah call “radiation man” name! Interesting. hope sort capacity limit July 4th pubs reopen. must say I'm glad normally. said, pubs short supply here, common walk pub seats go next pub hundred yards away. Nonono, know EXACTLY doing, never allow think incompetent. way complex that. 

Insurance, taxes, upkeep, repairs still happen. takes capital. Someone pay point. 

Much easier get money (UBI / unemployment) people let pay rent keep everything going. YAY! Glad brought cheer rough week! ❤️ Spotted reddit pedant. stuff like usually include layovers? Would able layover in, say, Paris Rome Frankfurt? Thank work tell people please wear masks. Far many people it. make mandatory enforce law. thing Germany said please wear masks places like supermarkets. realized week people ask made mandatory basically whole country exactly right move. Sure, racists either learn change ways die. room society natural bias others, bias based something person's control. wonder percentage remaining 35% would remain opposed lockdown regardless size future spike usa deaths drop chance meaning yesterday anomaly?? Fuckin navy gets board shit starts rolling Bookmark world survive without fake, sanitized version England, China, Italy, France... ? 

...especially since Americans soon banned countries. 

We seen stupidest, selfish, disease riddled 1st world country planet. Thanks MAGA. Removed now? Sir, facts place sub. hard concept.  Ok couple things fuck head. 

I'm killing anyone. grandmother 86. mostly takes precautions, wears mask goes public, limits time public etc. However also likes us come visit every week, including kids. 

Does put higher risk? Absolutely. job tell i'm going risk getting sick? No, feel is. pretty bad health anyway reality could go time. I'm sure would rather see great-grandkids every week, thing makes happy, live little bit longer waste last 6-12 months life alone. 

So even grandmother gets sick dies COVID, feel guilt situation would lived exact goddamn way. 

Second friend see public choice die, fucking kill decisions. I'm going kill co-workers work home. 

I'm killing anyone. Covid is. 

The entire point comment though people fucking sub spreading much non-sense ""fake news"" people. 

Yes covid real pretty dangerous certain segment society. But, mean going die??? REALLY?? Societal collapse?? GTFO. good type fear mongering do? Like stick facts help spread good information slow stop spread. Call politician tell testing measures place quarantine test positive. 

But good would do, better entire subreddit fear mongering assholes saying going die, spite plenty CDC statistics pretty clearly show barely us die, relative whole population. 2 weeks fine dandy someone top going enforce face masks support people go unemployed? 


i.e. guy running country never wears mask, gave people $1200 cover 2 months bills... got mean, beliefs practices early first century church far removed modern western Christian sect perspective historical Paul, Peter, Jesus, we're heretics. Triage tough decisions. Twenty-eight year old COVID symptoms March still ongoing chronic fatigue issues. sure studies find one issues young people face recover. 

 

Pulled quote Dr. : ""The perception either virus really severely end hospital, recover immediately two weeks - case,"" said Dr Copeland.

""We've seen thousands people long-term symptoms persist - chronic fatigue particularly key challenge."" mask mandates enforced? anyone explain numerous references keep hearing government officials mask mandates unenforceable?

At least dozen states made mandates April/May, (like North Carolina) recently. live Tennessee, counties/cities made local mandates, [keep hearing like, ""a requirement wear masks cannot enforced"" officials making mandate. code for, ""We want to?""

[An North Carolina's new mandate states, ""Law enforcement also use trespassing laws help businesses enforce requirement customers refuse wear mask."" seems simple effective way enforce, no? municipalities enforcing mask mandates? Lt. Governor, idiot chief Dan Patrick. Apparently LOL too. sarcastic given pretty much everyone says “wait two weeks” response good news. LA county didn’t take chin first go around correct? parts Cali took chin March/April? Unfortunately, think beyond point comes someone asthmatic father-in-law cancer.

Elections consequences. consequence administration rather spend past six months everything power prepare country multi year pandemic, instead trying stop testing completely fine prospects million Americans dying. 

Not mention economic system worlds giant corporations likely loving pandemic means untold fortunes small businesses go extinct. 

We past point return thanks administration small dangerous group refuses play rules keep us safe community, stuck painful ride. Reminds people however long ego saying ""Look, Texas reopened 'bump' cases two weeks later.""

And now... We'd someone inside record something incriminating...AND incriminating evidence used successfully. Draconian lockdowns over, likely die gun violence overblown virus. Good day. see Cooper bottle water?  Drank like he’s weight lifting. came back Buffalo NC two weeks ago car NC plates (my dads spare), I’m worried I’m going get pulled breaking this, even though I’ve went effect. picture proof I’ve since two weeks ago, one would hope that’d enough...  cant directly compared. Fair enough. lazy want dig numbers myself.

According [Swedish ICU 490 patients 2441 died. ~20%. Survival moved patients ~20%. say would meaningful say scientist studies scissors ~~or paper for~~ matter well know.. California, per thread. 40% increase 24 hours. That's people eating indoors without masks. Right. 45-54 don’t get vote ? Fuck. Thanks area WA spiking right nowhere near Seattle. Exactly this. endangering minorities feel good themselves. Typical Oregon. Strangely, think they’re going to. Whatever economic cost bailouts, etc, cost anything far higher back end. lot states, Texas, Florida, etc 1) middle city whole time never confused ""fights"", remember them.
2) Yes, unconstitutional. communist China.
3) Everyone experts downplaying outbreak beginning, that's president admin doing. 
4) New York best metrics right followed CDC guidelines closely bend reopening pressure small minority whiny, unpatriotic neanderthals blocking healthcare workers going work. prepared second wave state result. Looks, sounds, acts. Trump “less testing = fewer cases” regime, data seems surprising scrutinized almost like people Covid-19 people get Covid-19. would thought? MA's wording 14 day quarantine advised. required. 2 4/5ths! But, without lockdown, people would infected, no?
What then? People died. dead people can't business. worry. Let's make sure never get X-ray, CT, autopsy table begin with. Can't find increasing deaths pneumonia find pneumonia. ;) shitty masks. wear them, either. Ignoring covid sounds great loved one gets bad case it.... COVID hits people react differently. recover, die. immediate lung issues, heart issues. lose lung capacity scarring, don't.

And anyone issues, they're going lasting whole lives. virus much damage. Huh? governor speaking, that’s hospital reporting numbers. Wow bet poll majority world gonna get response. mean anyone else remember pandemic closed countries? Glad dr tell us news accurate. Theres evidence lockdown, masks hit n miss, I've places I'm ok 1 wearing mask. importantly, nightlife booming! find shit revel large crowd anywhere look. Yes bars getting dinged, FB absolutely filled w friends taking pics bars clubs. ""What's tonight party people?"" ""Who's going side,"" ""Y'all poker party house?"" ""Who wanna rent 60 person condo weekend?""

We deserve burn. can't listen anything DeSantis says. I'm tired hearing lies, stupidity, indecisiveness. using pedantry push narrative last two months Americans experienced ""lockdown"". Furthermore, people die held gunpoint gun-related deaths die COVID-19, absolute fact. fit narrative can't ""unravel"" it.

No, I'm using definition much America reopened last two months, another counterpoint falls even said America ""shutdown"" past two months. Apparently know pedantic means either. clarify, again, trying say something said, clarification counter point made either held gunpoint. would respond drivel? narrative reality, fun ""alternative"" reality. nice day goodbye. though. mean unless count hospitalized weeks life-altering damage virus ""hardly knowing sick"", right. Well, Americans crying isolation last 4 years. Thanks assholes. prepared lose jobs go back school. We've making influenza vaccines less way decades. 'recipe' well known.

There's enough money anyone bother. Aside massive start costs, vaccines generally profitable. There's also enough room market another vaccine using (at point old) technology.   daughter 1 cancer. treatment put hold two months! gave ok go May. needed MRI sedated 2 hours check tumor. Cdc says always 2-8 weeks behind Yes, penetrated *deeply*. Again, going agree this. think staying within bounds one's job duties (something done people like Bill Barr, btw) important warning American people president kill us hides numbers helps reelection. 

I think view reprehensible. going get past this, unless change mind. I'm pretty sure done conversation now. nice day goodbye. going that. going fucking happen

America resources military might could successfully invade Europe instead. geographical logistical problems would costly sustain war effort. Uneducated population understand rules. Even educated guys dumb seen parts world. cousin teacher made fun shaking hands him. father shakes hand random guy. Half people know wear mask. nose time. I'm shocked finally agree Rubio something. wishing virus her, people idiots get get Okay we’re super duper serious time, definitely probably consider thinking maybe exercising raaaght wear mask. really want to. AIDS worse? 2017 16350 deaths people US HIV. deaths may may result AIDS (though likely contributing factor). peak less 42k US. 

How many people died COVID? much less year? 123k US. I've managed COVID19 pts ED ICU I've seen theres good answer question. Generally people okay non-invasive oxygen techniques, ones dont get intubated. Intubated COVID patients tend ventilator long time since generally biased sample patients. ones obese pre-existing conditions. 

I've patient last vent 20 days, taken died 2 days later. Others died 15+ days. seems high mortality patients requiring invasive ventilation, almost expected high risk population.  okay vent death happens rapidly. fine start code multiple times, eventually call family 5th code (multiple codes wears everyone floor), family says stop codes go palliative approach. 

Its like tradition severe viral ARDs die within 5 days. one thing lot people tend forget Vent 12+ days comes whole host problems. Vents invasive (they benign!); messing heart, venous return, total vascular resistance. body adapt modifications gets used overtime, untrained people charge end hurting patient more. im ranting, I'll leave that. sure metrics talking about, LA doesn’t seem nearly dense San Fransisco, New York Chicago. July 25th

*Edit: looking around, seems like depends state, Cares Act expires 25th, definitely.* Ahh, guilty pleasure types threads. Seeing people downplay first couple months year trip. Andrew Yang’s UBI opt-in. Many, many people would take cash means-tested huge hassle benefits may currently receiving. Next thing know, hospitals admitting people Covid symptoms, shutting completely, overcapacity...

Can't drastic increase Covid-related hospitalizations hospitals... *tap forehead* He's reelection. look twitter replies daily briefings, pretty clear loud population wants restrictions gyms/bars back ASAP. Lt. Govenor running also championing positions.

Bad wait long imo, I'm glad happening. numbers shit. switch 5G capacity again. Honestly I'm overly pleased. Quebec death rates worst world like UK, Spain, Italy. Ontario medium death rate. Elsewhere Canada good shit though. province BC extremely low death rates. Ontario 10x higher per capita, Quebec 30x higher per capita. 

That said. Canada seems control. 326 cases 18 death yesterday population 35 million downward trend. California, around population Canada, 6500 cases, 68 deaths, upward trend. note California fewer deaths per 1 million Ontario Quebec. Even went full lockdown they’ll still probably overshoot due lag. True less risky surgeries good put off. However 1 year old cancer canceled appointments pediatric floor March. end cancer riskier Covid her. wait two months get MRI (sedated ventilator 2 hours stagger stop breathing get good images). Michigan Detroit didn’t even crazy cases live. one cares capacity. Bars metro cities might getting hit, ama/lbk  he’s got anything say, stick discipline sit rigorous interview tell us saw participated working regime. Scientists say hydrogen abundant substance Universe

This article fascinating read. Highly recommended. It’s positive news, can’t trust good news coming state. Quit shilling it. infections increasing, hospitalization up, less people social distancing wearing masks, people like trying make people think isn’t bad posting type fluff articles. Texas: we’re going next coronavirus hot spot

California: hold avocado toast Trump stacks courts hospital beds. US rights least well Canada. This.  EU already announced likely happen really believe 99.99% cops good, lot growing do. would know vaccine works? Suppose one volunteers stays home, probably won’t catch covid. antibody test see vaccine works? 74% ICU patients Houston related COVID Ah,my bad. Thanks. right now. infections two weeks ago. Make sure barn door shut. Shockingly, seems be, enough people reddit praising non-stop ""one adult Trump's cabinet"". anyone step Trump continues believe answer less testing? appeasing Trump got reward Abbott? Oh loss federal funding testing sites. Well played! Yes, since talks still ongoing. agree OPs cited article bit misleading though since plan reevaluate every 2 weeks. Live panhandle Florida I'm CT. live choice btw. People still call hoax here. Social distancing guidelines exist. Masks worn populous. People care fellow Americans. act patriotic. insane. better equivalent metaphor enforcing speed limits. public safety speed limits encroaching “muh freedoms”. Wild assumption make. Like choice, I... collapse bricks mortar retail hurts economy mainly jobs lost lost value vacant real estate. actual individual retail businesses don’t contribute much. many people shortsighted part political machine, especially US. want change much anyone else vote progressive, simply works moment kicking screaming makes look like naive entitled brat. Agreed. Mood sure lot jovial working company like GNC. add capacity, temporary hospitals? patients need monitoring oxygen, fancy equipment specialists. Nope, it’s Gods hands. Everything happens according plan therefore don’t analyze anything Sad Florida noises. quick math numbers.. keep up, 290 million have/have-had Christmas.

Either way.. six months. major saturation levels.

I never disappointed people practice willful ignorance, government demands it.. 

Why even paying taxes? ... rubber hits road, government can't even organize release good information - ""cover mouth nose"" - basic life saving information. can't even organize consistency regarding that.

The USA done world leader. lost credibility, across board. it.. Gone. cause death, Einstein economy...the economy gonna crash gonna !? involves nasty S-word adopted even people like idea written like that. Isn’t got Australians? Maybe telecom companies US government would something rampant scam calls every single day, people would inclined answer phone. Plus, way late contact tracing. done January February, would’ve worked. many cases would waste time right now. There’s isn’t cure cancer- it’s one disease. Different cancers varying success rates certain therapies, even within specific cancer type, certain mutations make success rate better worse. It’s like giving antibiotics kill bacterial infection. isn’t conspiracy theory, government isn’t hiding cure, it’s simply biology. Well media likes big bews cover shootings pass information dangerous actually is. situation live city since kid used that.

This little different. new issue affecting area (stockholm? Milan? New york?) far away you. ""invisibile enemy"". first scary time know anybody tested positive, positive normal think safe. necessarily case. hope everyone enjoyed going back work way fucking early fast goes slow comes down... full fledged lock down. summer break free all. Oh Disney opens weeks Yep, Taiwan running WHO. Yes aircrew healthcare staff managing transfers lauded navigating extra risk successful manner. I've exercising outdoors entire time. I've run miles past 2-3 mos ever I'm cooped day. Protests valid Good. Surgical masks protect others you.

Little Rhody. nook hardest-hit states (NY, MA, CT) Gina saw we’d creamed took steps. She’s struggled throughout two terms Governor (and rightly so, instances) leadership this, get monument. beg differ. Also keep mind numbers drop start mandating mitigation tactics. Illinois example peaked 4000 cases May 12th official lock started March 20th. took almost two months peak early mitigation tactics. silver lining see know today back March. know masks dramatically drop spread. can't send home relatives current state, that's going exacerbate problem. Starting to? already lost. know many already infected positive cases, without proper distancing mask wearing.. I'm guessing LOT. least quarter would possibly die next weeks Thing don’t know. NY forbidding contact testers ask protesting not. reality don’t know don’t data. 

And scary part we’re ignoring data narratives. 6,500 CA. It’s like states view competition. ""Some course may die, sacrifice willing make."" No. results - ground glass patterns lungs - show chest CT's, since disease sometimes cause pattern, scans considered diagnostic, except briefly Wuhan enough swab kits. Tell us euthanize elderly people, Swedish ""experts"". know people already said ""If ever come vaccine thing think want it."" Ah, think old herd immunity plan, UK prepped well. idea lock elderly, let virus blow population get relatively unscathed economically.

Problem was, UK freaked, numbers Italy &amp; France showed benign 60's enough requiring treatment, including ICU, wreck health service trying cope it.

With hindsight, herd immunity thing quick get to, Stockholm shown take measures (even lock down, stop health service crashing), nature COVID bring vulnerable meant turned really really bad plan. Right even Fauci W.H.O wrong flip-flopped. Literal death panels. none local stores sell decent face masks.  People still talking COVID Classic sixth expansion already. I'm entirely sure we're one high level Consumer spending, pathetically weak safety net, nonexistent savings basically worker protections rolled one. Already happening us, 10 days late rent first time ever, already got served. Unemployment taking weeks grant appeal hearing falsely accusing quitting back early May (never quit got fired, commission work stopped coming). put mental health bad place getting worse every day. I'm glad people like understand want happen. country even hit 1% infected. Herd immunity without viable vaccine probably 2022? would thanks Abbott. think New Jersey field testing sites shut down. know one Morris county CCM closed weekend. surprise really considering low numbers fact tested lot places. Plus state supposedly rolling mobile testing units next week. Correction, Trump's handling virus brought country knees. 5511 new cases today, course deaths never really go matter many cases. Ok, point guy making demand drives businesses open. things continue way are, businesses forced close government mandated lockdowns de facto lockdown occurs people scared go out.

Businesses don’t like lose money isn’t enough revenue justify paying people, they’ll close  we? Need better. anyone else desensitized point? keep sub anymore, news general. take precautions feel need to, beyond that... dunno. I'm much less stressed out. lot happier. question lot virus still, gotten stranger time. It’s I’d like go know people blame Trump, he's merely representation society. He's elected representative people. Remove Trump people still willing believe horribly inaccurate information. bigger underlying issue large numbers people education made unnecessary burden must endure every day youth, opposed beneficial component help build lives. Well I'm afraid find out.These spikes mostly young. worst gym. Lifetime fitness co-ed dry sauna allows 4 people max. I’ll wait outside person leaves go in, many idiots disregard huge sign big number 4 walk right sauna. Yesterday 10 people it. shook head finally worker comes kicks people out. Total disregard morons... lockdown started 9th, already 21st February ""red zone"", small town called Vò Euganeo quarantined. Yes I’ll admit wearing mask suck it’s small sacrifice greater good. comply. Guess what, he's genius, virus going away wear wear masks. Spread cut bit masks going away. WS fucking idiots put island food die together slowly. actually explain US two party system! 

It’s way vote. what’s called First past post system, basically winner takes system. Countries tend naturally fall two party system unless otherwise specified constitution. 

There pro’s con’s system.

Pros: 1. Works well large, diverse countries. large country like US could easily end 100 parties. would nightmare. 2. It’s hard believe today’s climate, two party system party’s tend moderate trend towards center. parties trying capture average voter. Political
Scientists call medium voter Theorem.  

Cons: 1. party’s large lead disorganization concrete views, lead voter apathy. 2. lead less competitive elections. 3. downplay alternative views. conversation last night wondering Houston hit another stay home order. WORSE first stay home order put place. never got recover first wave bigger one crashing us. think great remain cautious times, also think means confining indoors. Go outside, go walk, go park, go drive, etc. Carry mask hand sanitizer (in pocket, purse, backpack) need use service (gas station, store, etc.) wear mask inside need sanitize staying mindful things coming contact with. 


We social creatures natural start feeling depressed without it. Meet friends family park outside yard something. bring cautionary items discretion.  know ignorant, elective surgeries include lot that. research care less ignorant, doubt it. That's thing. Everyone know seems insist I'm area actual paranoia. example, everything hit used go grocery store weekly basis. Since lockdown I've going monthly basis thing drop groceries trunk contact anyone. Everyone insists insanely paranoid. also avoid restaurants. Everyone insists paranoid. wear mask I'm leaving house. Everyone insists paranoid. go parties I'm invited to. Everyone insists paranoid. Pretty much everything people say real paranoia stirred media fearmongering. know ridiculous sound trying justify protesting thousands, deadly virus plaguing world?

That 400 could quiet easily amount 17000 virus spread unfortunate victims.. syndrome

Kind ironic seeing citizens Stockholm people European major capital put house arrest. would guess people dual citizenship still travel might required show negative test quarantine 2 weeks.  Low performance prevention vaccination rates directly related healthcare access, US lacks person responding discussing healthcare quality. 

Accessibility aspect Lancet study linked, like state. huge fucking part study. HAQ index use, use healthcare access metrics.

You also state rather get treated UK, South Korea, Greece versus US, countries HAQ index average, makes realize full comprehension study linked. points moot. link studies understand. Holy shit Florida. So.... think contributed 2nd wave? Opening businesses slowly massive protest crowds? 

1/2 people wore mask instances. difference protest crowds, everyone crammed together. Everyone yelling screaming.... virus spreads farther. Get tear gassed... coughing hacking... spreads far too. masks become political issue US medic area outside Houston, people claiming hundreds open ER bed delusional. crews waiting two hours triage areas admission holds ER preventing nurses able flip rooms. Couple typical people flooding ER proverbial toe pain going home grocery store infecting people refuse wear masks. situation getting hand quickly. would willing bet back lockdown within weeks.  GNC sold shitty products anyway. get liquid chlorophyll liposomal vitamin C there. know have? Like 20 different variations shitty Chinese-manufactured ascorbic acid vitamin C supplements. get shit Walmart. also barely refrigerated liquid acidophilus. specialty store without special products. obvious selling cheap shit, poor selection, high prices. Good riddance. Eh necessarily great example... many different viruses (something like 200) cause “cold”. You’re likely catching strain twice year even though symptoms may nearly identical High infant mortality biggest factor only. risk women die childbirth estimated 4% started bearing children mid late teens. due high mortality, women made childbearing age needed average 5 children keep population rate steady.  Men faced lot mutilation death normal work.  add diseases common including plague, cholera, dysentery, malaria, diphtheria, flu, typhoid, smallpox leprosy continued take percentages population year year.

It also true people survived childhood stayed safe healthy (most rich) lived 70s. coronavirus swept middle ages, probably would fast, deadly, barely noticed.  spreading among young people doubt reckless whipper snappers visit grandma ruin summer. Give time; oh, say TWO WEEKS!!!! utterly useless piece shit. 11.2 billion looking herd immunity 80%

If really feeling fancy, immunize based personal risk calculation 1) rate contact population, 2) type interpersonal contact, 3) likelihood asymptomatic, 4) locale (urban vs rural) importantly 4) scale infection live.

You'd want give people likely transmit virus unknowingly population already ravaged burdened greatest effect. one's going force get vaccine rather fucking skeptical. rest us would like planet back. think ppl okay w 2nd lockdown financially compensated sufficiently.. could dick say RTFA, could pretend I'm not, like this. Qualities good leader include make unpopular decisions benefit masses outside one's self. forecast line (the dashed line) clearly trending upwards. slight, quite obvious. Weird seem unable see that. Great post! I'm trying make head/tails stuff. Really helps. expect? 🤷‍♂️ please kind corpse girl died disease spread mostly inconsiderate liberty “requires” weapons biological war?

Those cruel people seem polluting thread statements weight would placed detention still 17 themselves. hope they’re 8 don’t know better, Jesus, little class. correct theory. practice, people get tested mostly people feel sick enough check it. Saying ""85% sick people severe"" equal ""85% tested people severe cases"". Outside masks, please. Remindme! 12 days January till Totally NY, right comrade. sit motherland seeing seeds discord. fucking idiot post r/longisland, I've lived 30 years. 

In response ""what works NYC"" idiotic comment, figured democracy government wont weld doors shut keep people separated works. comes complete surprise, one could seen coming, Right, there's way there's 120k deaths. got closer 150k higher happen, even south. 

The anti-lockdown people much minority. Vocal are, if/whine hospitals fill, they'll ignored economies lock back down.  Honestly you’d better helping order things online. That’s parents would struggled didn’t take Taiwan. It’s adjustment that’s difficult elders. buy shit make. ain't really buying right now. Trust me, want everyone vaccine. DeSadist - ""Doctors saying something get board once."" 70% Texas 20 million. passed 100,000 cases, might reach immunity 10 years, give take five. Really? Reality seems suggest otherwise CERB even 10 minutes; people even managed apply accident looking website clicking links. Denied! Back salt mines! Back say! job creators betters!

/s

But srsly where's $500 Billion, Mnuchin? wanna give workers go bankrupt s\*\*tshow? surprised probably already it. He's healthier age, never drank alcohol done drugs life (brother died addiction young). illness anyone fuck even mean? 

I'll put simply smoothbrains. 

It brand new virus already spreading countries like wildfire high death toll. cared enough listen variety epidemiologists podcasts read articles, understood highly contagious poorly understood, erring side caution good idea.

Even now, say ""the scientists"" (as they're monolith) waffle do. different research brand new topic may find data difficult apply reconcile. yet many countries successfully proven cautious, serious policy required mitigate case counts. studies saying threat back Trump claimed would handled got past cases?

For example, estimates wearing masks would severely mimimize rate transmission. Whatever need do, clearly US failed countries succeeding. core policies social distancing sanitation.

Your willful ignorance indictment scientific method. Thank sympathy, hope get okay. sad thing is, agent orange cause - accurate representation mindset millions citizens. :( following Governor's lax rules also President's misinformation whole thing helping *are* rising CA everyone streets seemingly fingers ears singing ""lalalalalalalala"" Texas fucking joke. delivery driver, multiple people threaten tip delivery instructions contactless procedures. masks, went car dealer day work saw three masks- me, customer, one employee. three us looked 25, governor still blaming millennials COVID spread. actually 13 feet Prior COVID assumed happened least times.

My office requires masks social distancing possible. Leaving window discretion open lets people like OP neighbor basically never wear them. check come building asks symptoms that's it. imagine feel here. Go read swedish hcs pandemic. interested discussion, providing lazy ppl links could google urself. wouldn’t take serious. Cops didn’t pull people states stay home orders, highly doubt going enforcing thoroughly  we've never seen global lockdown, media panic, social media misinformation-pandemic like history world. People look absolutely wild nonsense become lives assume superpowered radioactive doom virus outer space could something like this. Want conceal gun? need gun. pants.

Genuinely laughed this. also, JFC. country live in. protests nation wide, yet large metropolitan areas seen increase cases. Philly, NYC, DC continue downwards trend. Minnesota also seen increase. 
Sure protests probably contributed bit, believe sole reason we're seeing now. we'd seeing spikes every state. Pretty sure play husband kept turning lights higher higher, started wearing sunglasses eyes painted them, telling wife ""it's always bright I've always worn sick shades, must going insane.""

Everyone knows this, attempt seeking alternative information internet suggests severe disrespect post!  wouldn’t frustrating stupid people ones get killed virus carelessness.

Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Get line sheep eh offer possible words encouragement. get this. peak states taking seriously enough. still think it’s possible kill virus without vaccine. may wait till 2021 see fiancé, long you’re careful fine. wait evidence? Contact tracing happening, able find weeks much type activity contributed. trust California, see uber-conservative Arizona says. True. exaggerating pining competent leadership like New Zealand.  making lies. number COVID patients ICU [1] number ICU beds [2].

I know people working COVID wing UTSW. bad like say. need hide identify behind made-up username.

1. Hahahaha feel like trying get join mlm soon states highest covid deaths country. rest states quarantining THEM. Poe’s Law strikes Good god, yes fucked. seen person inside building without mask since April  understand TMC's numbers this. 

Total ICU occupancy normal according put missing? (Honestly, know.) It’s literally unconstitutional ban state state travel. can’t happen. know that, know that, general public *should* know that. Yet, are. Skeet skeet would starved without them, put front line. one Dayton Ohio 18. quoting here? gloves worthless, wear hospitals train lifeguards/first responders/ etc. put treating victims?

No, that's works. paramedic

Do realize healthcare workers remove gloves soon stop touching patient right? walked room touching computer remove gloves first, washing hands (yes, still need wash hands) touching anything. Anything brought room disinfected moving another room, cardiac monitor, thermometers med trays.

**Because touched patient, gloves contaminated, touching anything would cross contamination.**

The moment touched public object surface, door handle considered contaminated. Everything touched afterward cross contaminated.

How many people see street actually remove gloves replace new ones everytime touched phone/wallet/keys/groceries? saw people wearing gloves driving home time. Long time use gloves also perfect place pathogens Covid grow since wet warm. wearing gloves ""correctly"" going shopping, would need dozen pairs one trip.

You put colored chalk gloves going grocery shopping, would see much contamination moved along.

**It's far better wearing gloves washed hands leaving store use hand sanitizer got cars** live hard hit Italian area, cynic else situation realistically going improve own, even take serious measures today, 12 days enough. 

The people either hospitalised die/need intensive care, already infected. situation two weeks ago. Virus 5-14 day incubation stay lockdown now? capacity deal infected people jumped death rate may lower number deaths may jump positive cases progress. This. give shit peoples lives. cares get elected best chances keep numbers low. test big numbers lot cases registered. Oh, meant general, regardless virus. saw insane Michigan courthouse protests. guys stay put, forever. Tell daycare need numbers common sort thing is. anecdotal stories happening one person, hundreds millions infected far, mean much. think population size Texas many fall ""I'm going social distance sure hell going wear mask"" crowd. Texas man gotta catch all! like Pokemons! Freedumbs! 2,420 people participated survey. probably done online, know participants even American?

The headline say ""1,573 people would rather return lockdown"" rather suggesting 65% of, impliedly, americans.  Ugh even think us ""essential employees"" get lockdown time? let without work last time fill us time. could win win everyone. (Well, long go back day jobs over) r/Masks4All , MLB.  Honestly, traveled via plane couple days ago felt extremely safe. Everything extraordinary clean entire row myself. Airports planes designed hold way people social distancing easy. I'd argue going grocery shopping greater risk I’m honest, no. stupidly let guard small amount people office office alone. wear mask stores public spaces felt safer work. I’m completely fault protecting won’t make decision again. Dibs source that? Florida overtaken Florida Man. follow guy YouTube puts terms understand keep with, said federal government already said even second wave, spike go back mandatory shut down. economy can’t handle it. know, $$$ people. Welcome good ol USA. work several people believe ridiculous things.


It's like take one thing may heard context run proof correct.

Like touch face mask, get Covid-19. Ignoring fact touch virus pick first.

Not mention, people touch faces anyway, without mask.


Masks block spraying around everything, cleaning sanitizing surfaces deals mask spills, washing sanitizing hands deals touching anything sanitized. Let get virus, mind business wonder much joke Virginia's ""mandate.""

Less less people tourist hotspot VB masks every time bike recon, week. counting people outside here, employees customers shops. Yup. feel crazy declining invite older brothers wedding late July 50 people. Even though mostly outdoors would much rather avoid large gatherings like that, even brother's wedding. rest family thinks dramatic continue guilt trip going. Ridiculous. got worst possible way.

No didn't, asshole. grandmothers grandfathers people spread going die agony got worst possible going extremely careful, think I'm kind making mission educate people tell story.

You business educating anyone! hell? stupid believe global deadly plague killed half million people inside 4 month period... go quiet everything on. less burden society FUCKING GUY WANTS PAY HOSPITAL BILLS GOFUNDME.

I hope one donates. That's ridiculous. Like, feel like word ultra-entitled. go ""didn't believe COVID,"" got sick took risk almost guaranteed going get sick, undoubtedly spread people, audacity ask people *pay* terrible judgement? File bankruptcy, 100% earned it. sure. exactly do. Like said, trillions protect us military, could find money keep us safe. ""god create us wear masks"".

Didn't create us drive cars either, yet are, driving cars Coronavirus' new type virus. pandemic fresh set circumstances, various strains coronavirus reservoir existing animal populations nothing new.

I'm assuming answer (to) question/affirmation? good least spiking percentage wise, needs going down.  dump followers, Iowa wearing masks all. Covid* anecdotal best. think laws exist? Eh. nothing bed capacity, actual issue.  You’d think, right?! People find way complain matter what. someone could told would happen! Okay, hope get banned. hoping this, anyone else feel like kind inevitable Trump get Covid-19? He's putting risk much, certainly high risk category. surprise. 

Everyone know wear mask keep social distance. people think need follow rules, go die. example. Florida pushing 3000 new cases daily past week.

That means 1 month I'd expect start seeing 90+ deaths daily honest 3% CFR. live AZ cities mandated masks last week. fines attached also decent amount enforceable. Honestly, mandate even enforceable made *huge* difference. think fear maybe fined enough people (probably read whole mandate realize be). 
 
Most stores put signs doors say masks required now. amazing change. Everything bigger Texas. immediately wash manguera like old days Texas governor said today ""Because spread rampant right now, there's never reason leave home,"" Gov. Greg Abbott told CNN affiliate KBTX. ""Unless need go out, safest place home.""

The US federal government really dropped ball here. Testing tracing would cost government less spending trillions checks mailed everyone, give people temporary jobs stem spread (which would boost economy) help economy reopen faster. Way worse federal response said kill people reason? said effective, implied china's corrupt government would that. certainly Reasons. idea even bothered lockdown point. rate infection pretty small Texas, lock 6 weeks. open back exponentially likely catch virus lock again.

My preference would everyone bite bullet full lockdown 12 weeks, drive infection rate nothing across country, move testing/containment strategy.

Or screw it, Mad Max there, every person themselves, economy must grow.

**But literally worst options** 

All pain disruption economic shutdown none results. Let's bankrupt small businesses, drive unemployment 10% 20%, *and* still get everyone sick overwhelm hospitals. reopen now, course everyone terrified restaurants bars they're still ruined.

And see states stomach *another* lockdown. it'll another half-ass one prolongs pain suffering dying economy. We'll yo-yo businesses months looks like instead brief hard, concentrated action.

The United States lost stomach collective action. We're bordering failed state. think google California COVID 19 updates, find it. google BNO, might tell you. no, no, supposed point particular political party getting people killed. 

That's political statement, mods get wind this, going hissy-fit. 

Always remember - politics coronavirus response mix! according mods! Great! ""unaffected areas"" back then, happens hospitals lose capacity days people stuck limbo nowhere go? make decision midst skyrocketing rate infection yet plateau. words, prepared worst making room allowances fullest extent possible saw data pointing worst case scenarios. step ahead virus. know would control, made new policy couple weeks later May confirmed bed capacity issue contained. new policy made sure nursing homes longer receiving positive patients. think post gave covid-19 degree availability flu shots — pharmacies, local GP, sure schools mid-size large companies actually bring nurse site administer whole staff afternoon.

That said, couple states larger population entire country. I'm sure delivery system proportionally equal. There's also (significant?) portion population local GP they'd dependent pharmacies urgent-care clinics. Unless preexisting condition dont feel like unnessecary remain qurantine long. probaly meet friends family (unless risk group). feel like might get downvoted this, weigh consequences factors, mental health, likelyhood getting Coronavirus Texas governor said today ""Because spread rampant right now, there's never reason leave home,"" Gov. Greg Abbott told CNN affiliate KBTX. ""Unless need go out, safest place home.""

The US federal government really dropped ball here. Testing tracing would cost government less spending trillions checks mailed everyone, give people temporary jobs stem spread (which would boost economy) help economy reopen faster. Way worse federal response LOL I've never life seen 20 people Subway shop. that's basically like limit. fear dying, fear suffering.  pajamas factor equation. prediction Syria come true not? Thousands people would dead listened him, yet he's victim Trump let play civil war Syria? dumb speed. Speeding closed course totally okay. friend actively wearing mask ""muh freedum"" would chat them. would also chat stupid driving public roads. Especially car them. Luckily friends either things. How's SA / Qatar / Egypt re: B climate? paper seems bit contrived definitely agree seasonal aspect think driven Vit secondarily weather.  using pedantry push narrative last two months Americans experienced ""lockdown"". Furthermore, people die held gunpoint gun-related deaths die COVID-19, absolute fact. fit narrative can't ""unravel"" it. Where’d see that? “All money next year life” tantamount “die quickly slowly”. don’t find way help people keep roof heads food plates, won’t able enforce another lengthy lockdown. states could potentially more. 

I hope open Pandoras box can't get lid back on. Sun goes down, Sun comes up, can't explain that. People area panhandle complaining one testing sites said yo two weeks. people waited longer. depends company used. makes sense, fits narrative I've heard Germany is, way, Federal system done right. didn’t show severe. Fake numbers lol California sucess story early on, get hit like New York did. heroes. They're victims, like infected. folks constantly told president big deal, things safe, etc, hard low information folks tell real wrong. importance labor mobility? lack labor hurting businesses, lack demand. didn't... even getting that. I've literally never uttered typed phrase entire life. think might confusing someone else...

Also, people bills pay NOW, three months finally get paid. Texas governor said today ""Because spread rampant right now, there's never reason leave home,"" Gov. Greg Abbott told CNN affiliate KBTX. ""Unless need go out, safest place home.""

The US federal government really dropped ball here. Testing tracing would cost government less spending trillions checks mailed everyone, give people temporary jobs stem spread (which would boost economy) help economy reopen faster. Way worse federal response [This oxford one u/TenNinetythree, local saw study last week saying 10% people lose immunity month, 80% lose immunity 4 months. anyone wants talk it, scary think never over, really starting look way.
 
So yeah, scared. cumulative damage body, time get it, harder survive last time. can't make doctors.

Don't AI bots better human doctors diagnosing certain cancers? meets definition ""making doctors"", it? think you’re right. apparently 8.7 million undetected cases late March I’ve seen recent scientific study estimate, something like 80 times official count. Seems like nowadays we’re thinking we’re catching much cases. wonder gets patients region due size. RemindMe! 2 months Luckily, true number people Covid much higher laboratory confirmed number.

That false. missing ***new*** infections certain percentage testing also failing test ***dying*** infection percentage, populations utilize testing infrastructure. Healthy people sick people pull test equipment pool.

As result, amount new infections remains proportional amount deaths, therefore laboratory confirmed mortality rate still representative field mortality rate. true mortality disease much lower 5% 🙂

Even countries ubiquitous testing, mortality disease sustained no-less 2%. still huge. United States’s mortality rate higher testing precautionary response slow. Bandaid bullet hole Marching outside isn’t convenient him. Marching sucks. It’s important. building burning people cram stairwell get going criticize lack social distancing? No. wish fucking joke, true, 7000 plus new cases, infection rate went 40 percent last days, according Governor Newsom. Worse NYC, locked 3,000 cases per day.

Texas currently 5,000 real plan try control sight. I’m convinced “virtually nobody” wearing masks. I’ve heard friends live Brooklyn &amp; Bronx, uncommon see makeshift bandana t-shirt masks. 

The government response certainly late, I’ve heard friends there, decent number frightened folks tried devise solutions. Could governor relies science data wrong??? Agreed. Crimes humanity. heard wrong. cannot enter indoors business without mask. listen guy. used deep changed less uncomfortable. look labcorps self test instructions matches exactly described. Massachusetts one gym [refused follow orders close electricity water cut off. owner still adamant opening let customers town changed locks him.  lost? unfortunately can’t stay home locked down. I’ve taking precautions wearing face mask, although know protects sick. well using hand sanitizers can’t wash hands. requirement wear face mask public, wouldn’t dramatic rise cases logic causes lockdown whack-a-mole. I’m situation you. It’s frustrating able anything. younger sibling going everyone else household maintain strict social distancing Dad high risk category. makes sick little care family. could never imagine selfish putting social desires someone’s life. Sorry rant sucks powerless. think it’s actually good thing, didn’t realize virus knew difference. lapse quarantine system since corrected. compassionate consideration allowed no-one leaves quarantine without either 2 negative tests 28 days' isolation. wish fake, look up, true. Yes, U.S. big almost look country regionally see things getting. Remember, states even really shutdown. People wearing masks. Anything else help with? probably respond selfie wear two masks safe Maybe don’t want look like Seattle right now. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Things working lake houses guess. Given heart attack deaths 911 calls heart attacks skyrocketed time COVID deaths, safely say quite undetected COVID deaths. suspicions people present completely asymptomatic dropping dead COVID-induced MI. guys got paid unemployment? I'm still waiting since March.. know elective mean lot things. Grandmother cancer doctors caught heart failed brought back fixed heart. 90 cancer although life threatening left untreated postponed danger going back hospital (the cancer bad place small). worried cancer worried going hospital. get cancer removed pandemic can't think single elective surgery worth risk. said never constant pain injury illness something like may change mind. also wanted add seeing people acting pandemic elective surgeries sure boob jobs. mentioned article didn’t catch it- I’m wondering might affect college students attending schools plan open states- especially hybrid model isn’t going made available... good least steady, wish going down. Looks like gut feeling broadly accurate. Psha assuming stopped nonsense today COVID fake (which aren't), it'd still take weeks we're woods consequences ALREADY happened. That's did, apparently approach better supported simulations yields better outcomes there's vaccine.

Something personally believe managed better mental wellness perspective, see lot mental unhealth suffering coming lock down, think coincidence country could hold lockdown longer 3 months. hope enough, see much hope another three months lockdown anytime soon, without armed patrols...


As side question, close us, matter context. like siblings, Norwegians little goofy, Fins emo/brooding. hate Fins hockey season, tease Norwegians pop cultural trends. although Fins slightly away terms cultural similarity, also Finno-Swedes like lost twin. Norwegians hand economically independent really cool things fields, almost laughably dependant others.
I really say closer. wearing masks HELPS. lot. course don’t know exactly happen doesn’t mean let’s throw hands smart safe know dick math, 90% yesterday, 97% today, makes 104% tomorrow. Trumplebumpkin exact opposite sane person would yet again. inside grocery store/pharmacy even inside city limits. Putting percentages disingenuous way making look better is. Hundreds thousands lives ended prematurely, countless others destroyed loss. think people dying important people going broke. Human life money. can't agree that, agree anything.

I lost grandma last summer cancer. affected ruined life anything else has, including growing poverty. I'd rather homeless lose family members. I'm sorry feel same. Also, different demographics getting infected, plus standard care gone several rounds improvement didn’t say nothing fear, threatening throw garbage people irrational behavior. like 20 car pileup keep coming Health care workers exposed higher viral loads deadly. far 600 health care workers died working covid patients US. 1 trucker died. predictable rude reply is. Nothing smart say. yea definitely seem working towards 1905 Feb Rev event 

not fun! hope this.... Deaths lagging metric -- time passes diagnosis death. also seems likely highest risk people bit cautious, idiots go infect themselves, vulnerable people get it. anticipating getting whole lot uglier next weeks... feel entire virus fake know anyone personally effect this, unbelievable let emotions dictate future. 

I love everyone come wedding one person sick due party, wouldn’t able forgive myself. Send masks. Amazon companies stopped allowing purchases PPE shifted hospitals, clinics on. Also weird he's implying virus going go away all. Stay safe brother. feel like may one percent survivors ""B"" Plague movie. Also, like good B movie, sufficient magazines 9mm hollow-points. Like countries within countries? I'm familiar people traveled least USA borders wide open back then. "" ... anyone traveling Connecticut, New York, New Jersey state new daily positive test rate higher 10 per 100,000 residents state 10% higher positivity rate 7-day rolling average directed self-quarantine 14-day period time last contact within identified state."" 44 new deaths like many really?

FL Pneumonia: 250/mo normally. 1000/mo 2020. (1000 - 250) = 750 probable Covid19 extra deaths/mo (pneumonia sufferer would go ER). 750/30 = 25/day. 

44/.58 (coroners reporting) = 75 coroner adjustment



So 75 + 25 =100 new deaths today

and get going ""Snow Bird"" deception. supposed suppress hurricane activity? Hypocrisy Ignorance proper word use governor?

Based many media reports, lots Texans laughed sneered CoV issue... open early, mask social distancing.

Read many businesses, esp. eatery places, shutting now.

Sorry who's laughing now?

Heaven help medical workers!

Stay safe!  One reason vote November. Biden wins think would issue. Unfortunately, think 50-50 point. many people let ""evil Dems"" win. Florida stay winnin ;) think looking different graphs. I'm assuming must looking [graph ashish looking [graph looking graphs reading additional material, inclined agree ashishduhh1 several reasons.

1. Graph 1 clearly shows maximum bed capacity ICU sum normal capacity (1330), sustainable surge cap (373), unsustainable surge cap (504) grand total 2207. number represents maximum number beds ICU currently has, plans for. Im expert hospital infrastructure, possible number either increase decrease depending factors. stands amount HOSPITAL available ICU.
2. Graph 2 interesting basically depicting numbers using gauge, also color gradients show warning signs system. June 23rd, already 'moderate concern' stage. I'm sure serious less serious warning stage concern. However, warning signs show early \~1700 bed mark, actually ties nicely Graph 1 since \~1700 beds exactly normal ICU cap + sustainable surge cap. Graph 2 thus telling us really start sweating sustainable surge beds filled. seems 2800 number ashish got value from, really reliable seems act outlier occupy maximum end spectrum. Remember making graphs school? always made maximum graph bit larger actually representing visually appealing contains data better. Graph 2 clearly states, 2207 maximum capacity ICU time.
3. Lastly, people slinging insults across party lines last thing needed handling outbreak words seems ashish white liberal due inability basic math. 2207 ICU max cap, far less 2800. Even 2800 max cap, certainly warning stage. reliable system would wait beds fill, including reserves backups reserves, declaring warning stage? dad saying - China needs personally thank US president. president, would united good half world's countries sanction China compliance. - president divides allies unites foes. Long blond hair, eyebrows. Lightning still comes aura. Andrews county West Texas. start high altitudes expand arctic circle.

But would rather call snowflake accept followed different protocol overly aggressive toward people reason. always wonder people like act like IRL.

Personally, think would great nice other. 100% possible civil discourse without resorting insults aggression. I'm crazy one tho. helping people, including congress candidates, saying masks cause health retweets. Completely agree. anxiety corona beginning, towards end anxiety financial. I’m still trying play catch up, hearing talk another lockdown chest vice grip. Hell even grocery stores 'open' areas - private infrastructure set food deliveries let spin wheels relative ineffectiveness could great way limit spread stores actually essential available roll pretty quickly. might different USA Australia Flu shot given Chemists (drug stores), local GP doctors schools big vaccine days. basically vaccinate every child town within day 2 people still scared get sick they'll lose job go bankrupt seeking healthcare. 🇺🇲🇺🇲 saved site look later. love well done data visualizations. Thank link. makes fucking sick.

You get tested. us aren’t willing gamble can’t that’s plan. biggest issue people taking risk furthering spread, since lot types going small groups store, seeing grandma, seeing friends, etc infectious. Thus cycle continues. don’t know anyone who’s gone see friends quarantined 2 weeks. It’s described. It’s significantly higher hotspots. It’s consistently 20% Delhi weeks (was 30% while) 15% Chennai (Tamil Nadu’s hotspot).

The testing aren’t allocated properly. Regions barely affected 2% rates testing bunch Delhi 10-15k tests day.

If Delhi, Chennai Mumbai took regions tests, positivity rate would near 15%. thought Exactly. clusters northern states, can't grow control everybody wears mask, crowds gathering, etc. understand it.

Downplaying consequences putting many elective surgeries help make point. diminishes credibility bad faith argument. Global Times reliable source? 3 months behind tried failed. “adults” need shut up, wear mask follow rules put place DRs scientists. bonus extends July

I've looking updates Congress, far looking expire extension today. Florida one Covid-19's favorite hangouts right now. would go theme park anyway? one right mind.

The employees placed situation. situation exist dangerous Florida right now. think month make much difference. beliefs job. job description clear. advice: Keep closed! Disney parks massive Superspreader Events. You’ve posted comment half dozen times. addition full shit clearly agenda one based reality fair, everyone, including WHO.

The nature science sometimes previously held theories turn wrong. going rule literally everyone who's ever wrong anything, wind one consult pretty quickly.

Fauci's ""cautious optimism"" perfectly line lot scientists quite reasonable. Iowan here. saw lady mask store yesterday. Noticed shirt employees shirt nursing home town. I'm surprised anymore. I'm frequently one wearing mask gas station grocery store like 2-3 people. They've stopped

🤦‍♂️ someone lives Houston, driven much people going less, amount places closing due employees covid cases.


I would say 1/4 30+ bars restaurants follow social media hit yet Yeah system propose eliminates elements far left far right majority American's interests heart (telling people want interest)? Agreed. Definitely respect virus is. Like anything, world scary place highlight potential illnesses, side affects whatnot.

1 7 people die cancer, it’s scary. can’t base live life eating well done toast example, carbon linked cancer. 

I guess time goes younger population see become aware media’s role don’t really care report truth, it’s first getting views. muh economy Ok BLM protesting Florida though? seen single article bit footage coming there. Seems business usual. also search FDA device approvals: questioning Masimo's standard like questioning whether Microsoft Apple make reliable Computers/OS compared someone's pet project /r/osdev 1.022 people dead every 20 gets it.

Luckily, true number people Covid much higher laboratory confirmed number. true mortality disease much lower 5% 🙂 abortion. Guns. Universal healthcare.

It's one hell place! ya, one people really knows whats going on. mean intellects. free thinkers see truth fiction. hate trump, probably another fool. guess care people... Snapchat videos like part Florida month. None restaurants bars adhere kind occupancy guidelines, social distancing, mask wearing. TON tourists, many different states. going get much worse gets better. scroll article reprinted English. hope so. I'm supposed start work September. I've got approved work permit. there, inspectors discovered facility allowed three workers coronavirus symptoms continue working and, two four days inspectors present, employees observed working without personal protective equipment.   
   state records, 43 residents home tested positive COVID-19 11 died. home total 48 residents recent inspection. facemasks Hospitals make profits cases, ICU. would basically saying hospitals make money vs lose money. for-profit health system doomed failure. always try maximize profits vs patient care. well? Unfortunately, looking like immunity covid infection long lasting. Jesus Christ! wish fake news. didn’t provide 20 data. 

The flu also much higher incidence. Less 1% Americans contracted covid lockdown measures put place. 10% population gets flu every year needing expand every couple days lately...  form [the sounds like shitty supervillian organization.  dislike terrible handling day 1. don’t think makes toxic. you’re “at-will” employment state little recourse. I’d pleasantly surprised is, here’s hoping agree needs determined area bit honestly think would work way should. many people would leave locked area travel open area, totally defeats purpose. others pointed out, $600 still going extended, there's huge fucking caveat...If state says companies reopen can't/won't go back work due health concerns lose money.

My wife got extra money like 6 weeks, employer able bring **some** staff back full time **some** casual staff back periodically (it's healthcare time go work restart 14 day self-quarantine requirement) like $600 gone despite working. Odd... bad trends??? thought Gyms problem????

i guess whats 3 weeks point dont even remember like go gym anymore... plus I'm way better shape since im run outside every day hot humid heat. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* work Corona work surrounded corona? federal government first place. See got there? fuck go high one day?! I've paying attention county. county, number infections going up, number hospital beds use going percentage positive tests going well. test done left airport Japan, mean infected couple days that. Otherwise load virus low detected test.  CT heart tourism county

What part CT tourism country? I've never heard people spending week CT vacation. 

Mystic Seaport pretty awesome.  Someone can't read numbers good huh? Bit late party [this website *La Nazione*, Florence's main Il Fatto whose website one popular among newspapers Italy.

This much less reputable one reference sites people, [ByoBlu reports demontration triumphalistic also Facebook profile Sara member national parliament who's also antivaxxer.

Is enough? That's surprising, kids probably rarely tested recently, testing became available mild asymptomatic cases. want lockdown. government wants give everyone tax credit travel. two ideologies fall line one another. Mainly 35% people don’t want lockdown storm state capitals loaded weapons...again. Apparently people color wear face masks Oregon county. somehow racially profiled. know they're becoming common question is, what's endgame? Staying home 1-2 years vaccine available worldwide effective treatment found? Another problem getting actual funds. Apparently Canadians apply assistance clicks, pending funds matter days. 

Meanwhile Americans past months call, email, post social media applications, funds, errors ignored local governments. 

People keep saying $600 extended honestly doubts think extension happen may less. Plus still resolve businesses close permanently. people even qualify PUA? 

The entire handling crisis one big shit show. 

Some sort UBI needs happen. renters know working. discounted rent. still pay. One "" friend"" worked snuck grown son grandkids place. types, always someone else's fault. always whined people office know worked sucked paid bills people anti-American, that's why. like Reddit.

Anyway, news I'm reading countries heavily pushed masks better opening economies, I'm suggesting thing. Soaking life ECMO 24. 20. 144 20 died flu. That's close enough 24 corona deaths assume flu least bad children Yup left subreddit I’m back. Hello friends! fuck cause? no, beliefs position help save country, democracy, hundreds thousands lives, so. 

you disagree. disagree this. Yeah I'm gonna pretend wonderful see Trump flag wavers get taken hospital never come back. Good riddance. actually meant nothing it..it satire much Fauci flip flops day day. course didn’t mean C19 flu hard express sarcasm words Email corporate. Protests part high mask compliance (at least NYC live) plus everyone outdoors. less risky say bar anything indoors. emphasis possibility asymptomatic pre-symptomatic transmission, forgotten important thing still STAY HOME SICK. Look, I'm saying grocery store workers arent risk.... I'm saying direct health care workers risk. 600 died far US.  defriend speed?  I’ll take sarcasm...? Lockdown? But, but... Muh Fridummm!!!  understand individual word first sentence that's it. allow 96% particle transmissions loose fitting drop 50% effectiveness according largest studies conducted. 

Maintaining 2 metre social distance still paramount. So, bad don’t want destroy city

Even entire city Austin catches this, like 99.9% people school work force OK. deaths happen tragic, let's overstate what's going on. fine killing parents, grandparents, friends co-workers. Got it. believe numbers understand source.

I'm you. kind shocking top-voted comment post. They’re MINERALS, Marie!! identified problem.  arent dates death. death gets recorded. ""the highest number recorded deaths"" doesnt really indicate much.

It doesnt indicate ""more people died"" day. shows records processed.  searching I'm afraid rolling stone article. read/watched many since Saturday. may take bit find since babysitting dont lock city couple million people, including *FUCKING WELDING PEOPLE APARTMENTS CANT LEAVE*, something deadly-serious. implemented moving Phase 1.  Even places rent fairly cheap covered roughly 2 months rent, thats like 1 bedroom apt. Thats usually including utilities either. mention basic living expenses. 1200 nothing todays economy. fucked. ""city"" facebook page poll like 44% people put would ""strongly oppose"" city mandating masks inside businesses. People already complaining 3.5 hours Greenville requiring masks grocery stores/pharmacies, disaster. telling NPR summarized version paper blog lmaaaoooo  back Pope’s chair upside cross. He’s clearly devil worshipper! need mask much get vaccine lol need national mandatory mask order. 

$200 dollar fine.

It’s great way make money selfish assholes. Agreed misleading title. protests cause spike cases, offset people stayed home time, study claims. Obviously large crowd shouting breeding ground virus, people stay home avoid protests increase social distancing fear becoming prevalent due protests, would definitely caused spike cases. know thinking people desperate blame BLM, seems bit ignorant. I'm support BLM, common sense logic still tell obviously large gathering like would increase cases people attendance. would thought party small government would awful managing situation big small government. Arizona broke 3000 cases per day thurs fri last week. raw numbers wise, LA looks bad. proportion population, they're way better everyone else. Crap! summer going even worse Spring, hope strain somehow less fatal New York strain spring.   bit -- who's winning right now, doomers anti-doomers? trying hold long possible. know keep much longer tho. wear mask scanned ID? Elective mean lot things, includes procedures serious quality life health issues.

It's cosmetic boob jobs, hysterectomies, knee replacements, etc. lot people's lives seriously fucked delaying elective surgeries. Sometimes easier call like is.

Don't give stupid arguments statements airtime. also fantastic amount PPE ready give public  stated poorly, news articles reporting it. UTSW reached capacity dedicated COVID unit 30 patients, expanding unit result. yet people still wearing masks religiously.  understanding big outbreak Los Angeles. know seriously taking it, film industry function without people getting together. course lot poverty, service economy may factors. 

I'm Oakland people taking seriously. Everyone street wearing masks. doctor's appointment yesterday, temperature screened sanitized door. waiting area literally person there, one working desk. waiting room lights even on. 

I cervical screening encouraged continue wear mask even doc fingering snatch. 

No one know California socializing freely, though people started ""Isolation pods"" people already quarantine. knowledge likely size 'infectious dose' important metric here? point droplet begins dry, number 'live' virions would drop - say - 50% average infectious dose level it? Well, get respiratory droplets, would come nose...or mouth. 
So I'm pretty sure putting mouth something turn would leave saliva it, someone else puts mouth it, would lead transmission  scientific study, Massachusetts set pop-up testing site Roxbury people took part protests. 14 1,288 people tested Hey man please forget hat top we're anything OK either. gone full finger ears mode since cases started surge reminds one chapter Stephen King book Stand, descrbes Superflu spreading across country. “The Imperial team says one litre synthetic material enough produce two million doses.”

Wow. Texas governor said today ""Because spread rampant right now, there's never reason leave home,"" Gov. Greg Abbott told CNN affiliate KBTX. ""Unless need go out, safest place home.""

The US federal government really dropped ball here. Testing tracing would cost government less spending trillions checks mailed everyone, give people temporary jobs stem spread (which would boost economy) help economy reopen faster. Way worse federal response bro 2020 need figure quickness money socially created mechanism get left behind. They'd better fucking send Florida team play town say. Fuck right off. simply added discussion.

All contributing factors need discussed, especially indoor dining, since instances happening every single day. ID mailing address (a family member) move around much. pretty easy get ID, need birth certificate piece mail Places like NY enforcing mandatory 14 day quarantine state arrivals.

No matter slice it, American south hotspots boned right now. marginally less bad positive test numbers might indicate know interpret them, mean damn thing. They'll known contact symptomatic person also self isolate tested. people die pandemic still alive countries testing reporting yet numbers going down.
Thanks playing ""how fudge pandemic"" USA wins landed highest paying job life, really don’t want go back lockdown. said, done right first time mandatory lockdown, hindsight 20/20 harmless lie: vatican proved facemasks biblically condoned 
harmful lie: lower testing leads lower cases think actively work ""it's theory"" argument. Relativity theory well...I see people saying ""yeah like that's theory"". We've allowed use word theory convey flimsy. avoiding jumping ""no fact"" we've begun use wrong terminology ceded ""theory"" terminology misused accepted way. Thank fuck am. peeps good, universal masking, universal precautions. summer stuff, carefully. Yeah way things going, much longer. population trending blue, mismanagement like part reason. extreme scenario tail cases. I've read lung transplants required news; think common. 

Hospitalization severe symptoms appears leave 30% hospitalized lingering issues. Post viral syndrome appears somewhat uncommon people mild cases too, stuff happens viral infections well. 

Mild cases cause minor lung scarring, yes, people tend notice it. 

Vaccine meant help cope virus own. meant prevent getting it. I'm fairly confident vaccine reduce hospitalizations deaths. 

In general, 90% people infected seem getting fine guess. 10% people issues end dying. extreme scenarios uncommon people talk scary.  Please tell major suppliers start selling people want wearing masks, CDC stuff. Hard wear proper mask can't buy them. gloves nothing. makes people think they’re safe become complacent careless. feel safer enforcing en masse would idiotic. locked almost 8 weeks . . . Mattis much left leaning. Unless count ""not bat shit insane right wing extremist"" left leaning. Yeah sure, feels like articles going much longer couple weeks. part understand. considerate others never absolutely horrid end result. People like would feel much comfortable would putting money economy would choose different path leaned education. cannot person feels way. Cloth masks work well everybody wears prevent droplets aerosols projected. people wear though effectiveness wear goes considerably. Hey, remember phase life Tiger King thing? Late 2010s, think. 2030, different house then. 2nd. believe Georgia beat us days. don’t understand wait people get sick making decision? actually don’t agree take flu seriously. Flu vaccination rates 40%ish range. Also, people insist trying normal activities flu. I’m talking people go jobs don’t sick leave, that’s completely understandable. I’m talking people don’t use paid sick leave (looking you, coworkers) insist still traveling/shopping/socializing super sick. 

I’m saying covid isn’t worse flu, hope good hand hygiene trying get people stay home sick outlasts covid it’s hardly disease kill people. Like said, flu bad too. Well, Pakistanis, yeah, thing. Ah see. could also easily tested using number maximum working backwards. I'm you, supposed starting school Spain fall. EU travel ban apply long-term visa holders, long get embassy give us visa we're good go! big pain butt going finding flight there.

(If remember correctly applying French student visa also need FBI background check apostille. NOW, secretary state processing apostille 3 weeks say could take 2 more.) Micromanaging remotely probably really difficult yep.... look are. nice move, ducey Then, downvote move on. every bussiness relies customers walking door hanging around GNC surviving online period. business model built around encouraging high markup/low value added purchases store.

80% shelf space GNC garbage. figures young people high protest areas? Seems would entering time frame obtaining data all.  That's true. hospitals overwhelmed none really helps. Still hard treatment. Also evidence long term effects even mild cases. good situation. go another state move apartment weekend favorite band town. friends going think it’d really help go. It’s indoors— what’s move? Wear mask? part movement tearing country apart. cities states got help fed set testing sites. New Orelans one reason ton drive thru sites symptoms appointments needed early on.

The one went run national guard, I'm sure much help feds gave long. I'm exceedingly grateful available. family tested positive mom test test neg going back work. would acess tests available. story posted 4 times already Tegnell idiot. FloridaMan Sweden. Yep. Takes back started. would check BNO time see happening China. remember waiting hit here. feel like I’m dejavu. I’m sitting east coast waiting happen again. Maybe outdoors compliance inside 95%+. yes, ""another new peak"" exactly exponential growth.

I'm sure one reports 'exponential growth' 'doubling times'.  deliberate PR make surge look less threatening, everyone given talking high school math american public. BOOM!! virus even touched 98% population US yet. everything reopening time. Sneaky sneaky virus. meme'd two weeks us really 2 months. worse weather Also, many anti-lockdown protestors worried livelihoods businesses shut down. Apparently sun kills virus mid cough. hear? SCIENCE/S Everything's bigger Texas. Ok thanks. complaining misleading headline. yep. live AZ guarantee neither things happen. screw you, ducey! he'd get head trump's ass long enough govern.  familiar me.  I'm staying home wife goes out. Now, ahe tell anymore.

She one types can't stand home needs socialization. keep going working must socialize. keep telling safe over. think knows can't stay home. quit telling goes out.

Worst thing weak immune system.  underlying conditions.  inability ride probably kill us both. [While quoted article talks mostly Houston dining restaurants, article talks regional pressures Texas statewide numbers reflecting greater houston agree gets touted conspiracy theorists makes irrelevant? can't interpret mean lot people would die lots different respratory diseases year getting one virulent spreads fast? Im legitimately trying learn here. Yeah, sorry fake tits nose jobs definitely priority right now. Oh goodie. Maybe change minds they’ll 180 policy procedure! Right? Well family protected won't. Hopefully one done vaccine, I'll protected everyone anti-vax risk lives. still plenty normal daily activities get infected we're still learning disease.

If really bear significant increase protests learn masks + outside probably ok. 

However major spreading events mostly indoors prolonged exposure stale air grocery, warehouse factory workers getting sick. Family parties, funerals, church gatherings choir practices become super spreading events. 

Going mall shopping department store probably good idea.

Taking walk beach, picnic outside, heading grilling probably fine long wear mask keep hands clean.

We know 100% ofc that's starting look like. moved here. Fuck. *occasionally* might utter something true - one occasions. say it’s curfew get antifa street everybody follow it. actually give HRIG along vaccine provides immediate antibodies give body time develop vaccine. Yes read old comments. Also, nice anti-BLM propaganda. leftover idiots r/the_donald seem know Tokyo bc y’all keep popping random subs like one. Good day racist. we're injecting ultraviolet light veins /s Yeah think young folks going Tempe partying really set guys back. I'm sure connection made necessarily young adults partying problem people spread disease to, inevitably.￼ *...you're Cheddar, common bitch!* Cool...as read desk office. brought us back June 15 mask requirement elected officials scared make mandatory. Wow. Thats great news. let check US then....oh holy fuck bad.

Well makes sense. guess blame haircuts. scientists could create like covering faces studies would prove reduces tranmission 17 3 percent get leader to, oh dont know, say shit like ""people wearing face masks showing disapproval me"" comparing apples apples. Op said McDonald's, 20 people crowded around masks.

Would rather inside small space 20 people wearing masks outside thousand people wearing masks?

Would rather inside small space 20 people wearing masks outside thousand people wearing masks?

There, compare apples apples. Stop trying compare best case scenario worst case scenario. still rather inside, fine. I'd rather outside. talking containment treatments. It’s worse lockdowns started places. exponential curve hasn’t altered. start adjusting death numbers people already dying pre-existing conditions, caught virus died instead. increased deaths numbers poached routine causes. Completely stopping virus nothing lot death numbers inflated up. 9O dEgReEz! need figure new plan get back us going.

Thankfully, since [disaster Week slooooooooooooooowly turning ship around. probably go lockdown (unless current government collapes outside realm possibility). *talking* lot implementing European Nordic standard Test, Trace, Isolate. least Finland formally offered support Sweden help pandemic generally, sure Norway Denmark help too. Denmark esp. helpful massive spare testing capacity. 

I much faith Swedish officials left point, least rhetoric promising. reported 5,508 new cases COVID-19 Wednesday, shattering single-day record continuing trend leaders urging public follow safety guidelines vigilantly.  state’s previous one-day high new cases 4,049 reported Saturday. Yes. Well done repeating thing twice.

But claimed worse outcomes, due moving. 

2/9 died means 77% survived. 

That seems line better normal ICU mortality. Meaning support claim worse outcomes moved.

Meaning spreading misinformation. riddled rona shocking /s affected all.

And no, think silly. believe best yeah, masks effective virus spreader. problem starts demand others so, ideally threat punishment happened last two weeks cause spike? Yeah protest government relief. fucking dumbasses act like danger over. views what? governor job time crisis? people don’t live business minimizing effect virus city? Yeah “but go store can’t get haircut?” argument numbers coat polish. get he’s saying comparing flag football tournament grocery shopping terms essential isn’t really going stick. I'm really glad hear things going well, Ill keep fingers crossed sister! It’s amazing protests weeks ago nail salons hotbed spreading, crowds multiple times larger Floyd safe. need see science, masks straight miracle workers percentage positives started go (quite drastically states) suggests testing cause increased figures due cases. Sure number cases may still lower right start NY NJ seem increasing again.

As person said, countries also increased testing still overall seeing decrease cases. better respect corporations regularly pay employees! fatality rates likely lower every country. death counts likely pretty accurate overestimated.

Because many people coronavirus without knowing. Likely majority

I used likely alot one really knows sure. Ok thank Dr  sadly seeing uptick cases. proving anything noting AZ early spike vs NY got thru it.

deaths lagging indicator. going try lie little less dumb. I've lived five years. 

As crime, well that's mass-immigration you. There's much front. 

The crime rate even comparable American cities btw. way see masks answer two problems. covid problem policing problem. Right seems Florida, Texas, California, Arizona going up. northeast, peaked back April hanging dwindling numbers two months now. Now, unless total virus eradication planet goal, there's really reason can't get back degree normalcy. Western Australia opening bars pubs standing first time weekend, oddly still feel little exposed us so, despite situation (1-2 active cases, quarantined). weird.

... even talk same, even halt fast experiencing massive growth, nfi. seems like absolute madness. unironically is. Fuck CCP brutal measures would've worked. IL. mass stupidity would surreal pre 2016. Hurr Durr

What fatality rate spiking number cases? two totally different things. lots ""thoughts prayers"" dead. Try both, come back me. Honestly fine disagree, hell nice here, come :) Holy

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Fairly sure trying ride narrative election really care happens. desantis thqt go straight human, antibody, safe, need prove effective protocols work beds staff. We’ve never able defeat virus. slow make sure level spread could treated current hospital resources have. run beds nurses, doesn’t matter treatment have, people won’t get them. vaccinated

You forgot anti-vaxxers. US we'll never reach percentage. like, really never stop 5 seconds think every doctor nurse (or should) assigned work COVID ICU? *really know* doctors like podiatrists plastic surgeons little expertise respiratory system, virus treatment, life support equipment monitoring upkeep worth assigning there?? cities. Rural areas south go shit, may come worse big cities look deaths per capita. Rural areas almost always lack medical infrastructure needed treat large number patients. example, live college town Georgia. hospital town caters county well 15 counties surrounding town. 44 ICU beds total yet ~ 650,000 people hospital designed serve. think general assumption Covid-19 dangerous elderly people underlying conditions incorrect we're thinking risk correctly.

Everybody risk dying every day, everybody. elderly, sick, chronic conditions, etc. risk dying much higher young healthy.

When think risk Covid-19 thinking terms increased risk dying, relative general risk dying (from causes).

Looking Covid-19 deaths age group relative total deaths time period typical year, increased risk rates get:

15-24: 2% 
25-34: 6% 
35-44: 11% 
45-54: 15% 
55-64: 16% 
65-74: 19% 
75-84: 19% 
85+: 18%

So 85+ age group, even deaths nursing homes increased risk dying Covid-19 (over causes) 18%, 55+ age group.

It's true 25-34 group lower increased risk Covid-19, 6% versus 18% 85+ nearly big difference would think.

I numbers calculate people underlying conditions, suspect numbers would work similar. Yes higher chance dying Covid-19 general population, also higher risk dying underlying condition increased risk much different.

My parents live retirement community Florida, think lockdown ridiculous say everybody know feels way. understand first ""elderly"" population highest ""risk"" could think ridiculous, made sense explained get older realize years limited want spend locked house.

I friend Cystic Fibrosis recent lung transplant also says thinks lockdown ridiculous wants get back normal. says compared fear dying CF, Covid-19 really scare wants get back things enjoys.

Practically mean ""high risk"" group actually much higher risk general population? think changes lot approach managing Covid-19. Maybe people avoid grandparents fear kill them. Maybe need frame lockdown necessary ""protect high risk"". Maybe need worry much recent rise cases younger population spreading older population. 

I would argue thinking Covid-19 risk absolute sense leads wrong conclusions. thinking Covid-19 risk increased risk dying causes, data shows elderly (and likely chronic conditions) actually ""high risk"" thought. I'm Italy. remember back January people thought paranoid saw stock goods began refusing go crowded places. Next thing know, whole country shut large cities people form long queues get supplies.

Carry on, behaviour correct one, although must say: wary mental stress predicament may cause you, okay take precautions must hold course steer clear actual paranoia, may strike us without notice (for instance, far people I've spoken to, seem developed fear going outside *entirely*). idiocy lack information among customers staff workplace leaves drained depressed day. I’m mainly referencing state level data. AZ example lab testing dashboard antibody testing positivity rate hovering around 3% almost entire time. fatality rates likely lower every country. death rates likely pretty accurate overestimated. state's restrictions laughable: "" *Dr. Dobbs:* Twenty indoors 50 outdoors can't social distance, social distance, 50 indoors 100 outdoors. "" Ontario Canada, areas effective covid control, limit 10 ""bubble"" indoors outdoors. bubble means pick 10 people bubble next 14 days cannot get close anyone else period time without mask. example, bubble wife, me, son, daughter law, 2 grandchildren. one else gets close us. really important point. lot mixed confusing messages masks February way April. 

I understand wanting people rush buy masks trying save nurses doctors. emphasis put showing people make cloth masks urging route.

If one lesson nobody taken away Spanish Flu, it’s transparent honest. There...there aga-nah it’s nothing clearly even open link shared , lists several studies medical literature. would love see studies backing statement. According woman Florida fired refusing alter case/death numbers, expect see sudden notable 'drop' cases next week state celebrate 4th like normal: ends true interesting see, think agree current explosion cases we're seeing result Memorial Day expect see 50k-60k cases per day become new normal 4th's effects start show up. load hot n' steamy bullshit.

ABSTRACT Introduction. Several viral respiratory infections - notably influenza - associated secondary bacterial infection additional pathology. extent applies COVID-19 unknown. Accordingly, aimed define bacteria causing secondary pneumonias COVID-19 ICU patients using FilmArray Pneumonia Panel, determine tests potential COVID-19 management. Methods. COVID-19 ICU patients clinically-suspected secondary infection 5 UK hospitals tested FilmArray point care. collected patient demographic data compared FilmArray results routine culture. Results. report results 110 FilmArray tests 94 patients (16 2 tests): 69 patients (73%) male, median age 59 yrs; 92 ventilated. Median hospital stay testing 14 days (range 1-38). Fifty-nine (54%) tests positive, 141 bacteria detected. Enterobacterales (n=55, including Klebsiella spp. [n= 35]) Staphylococcus aureus (n=13), typical hospital ventilator pneumonia. Community pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae (n=8) Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1), rarer. FilmArray detected one additional virus (Rhinovirus/Enterovirus) atypical bacteria. Fewer samples (28 % vs. 54%) positive routine culture, fewer species reported per sample; Klebsiella species remained prevalent pathogens. Conclusion. FilmArray higher diagnostic yield culture ICU COVID-19 patients suspected secondary pneumonias. bacteria found mostly Enterobacterales, S. aureus P. aeruginosa, typical HAP/VAP, Klebsiella spp. prominent. found almost viral co-infection. Turnaround sample results around 1h 15 min compared usual 72h culture, giving prescribers earlier data inform antimicrobial decisions. Health Officials: ""We would prefer lot die needlessly, *least* take precautions take next effort.""

Mouthbreathers: ""Fuck you!"" Yup. Sometimes two sides ""this reality, guy's idiot."" need stop acting like stupid opinion valid dumbass promoting it. pretty lucky happen two months ago, regardless people think treatments getting better hospitalizations shorter death % lower. concern still protecting vulnerable, hope avoid ravaged nursing homes, think people realize much drives CFR poorly population this. protect group well going horrible summer them. CT, last US state reopen, currently 138 people hospitalized statewide: Would also curious see phantom pneumonia deaths states added math. leadership encouraged us ignore virus go back world. President even encouraged supporters wear masks, masks ""signal disapproval him.""

I blame people, blame feckless leaders.  Floridian here. must contest going Ron DeSantis cause we’re position. Im NY ive seen story plays out, spiking cases itll hit peak go people get scared/new mandates get put in. breaks spirit long deaths/hospitalizations lag thing, 2 week virus people think. long slow burn say so. 

Bankruptcy creates lifetime problems everything function credit history. I’m sorry don’t teach reading comprehension health care school. would helluva lot easier reopenings potential surges, etc, 4% 6% unemployment 14% like now. Lockdowns brake - it’s magical thinking believe lockdowns ever going actually stop virus.  slowed infection, laid 500k people Houston alone, completely undermined confidence public health officials.  We’re going see kind lockdowns reference again, matter bad gets. People aren’t going it. love see word “jagoff” wild. Makes feel home. No, ""West Germany"" locked down, two counties are. outbreak was/is meat processing facility. Everything's bigger Texas! us healthcare workers going handle rest mask wearing, fuck social distancing, pricks. that. people could look something go- doesnt seem right get context, say yes seems appropriate, nuance im missing 90s.  fringe crazies platform gather mostly ostracized.  
The first time saw true propoganda life ( wasnt alive vietnam / regan ) patriot act. read it, old people would argue implemented protect freedoms.. lol.  Freedom fries bald eagles ward oil. 

It steadily declined since then. Even obama humanitarian talking points whike drone striking families acrossed middle east. 00's became 10's, see groups finding net. Still fringe taken seriously. Around 2014-16 claim, start serious, funded, coordinated effort confusion, outrage, disinformation. average person cannot take much data, many viewpoints. get lost, lose many level headed folks new normal. 20 years breaking middle class, confusing hearts minds population, striping freedoms plasticity american dream favor profits few.

I know ends, history books easily identify folly shake heads foolish was.  work woman steadfastly belief reason cases spiking Texas DUE masks. says need get outside stop wearing masks because... ""god create us wear masks"".

Yeah... know. mentality people, ""the cure exposure"". wonder feels way AIDS? so? serious question. might inevitable sacrifice. effective begin with. get flight $453. bad. might go bunker stop thing

But gone bunker 2 weeks back March, would April. people dont want wear mask makes difficult breathe, they're rude awakening wind ventilator. UK hasn’t closed borders isn’t part Schengen Area. simple read report see deaths age groups? CDC website unreadeable. must pretty wild world living in, imagining healthy unhealthy people risk. symptom free two weeks highly contagious time support leaving states whether reopen. believe coronavirus die off, prosper dominate next election cycle. problem solves :) happening now, agree. But, combined regular onset illnesses occur fall winter. combination both, reverse course, crippling.

I explained friend using example hurricane hit somewhere tornado hit place. vice versa. societies handle one time. Together destroy community structure already beat battered first place. may see fall start taking serious. go in. There's need anyone go office right now. Offices obsolete age coronavirus. “War peace 
freedom slavery
ignorance strength.”

I wish included inalienable rights ability proper healthcare despite employer, paid leave, new generation people don’t spend life paying college debt. L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said although impossible track origin spread public setting, “highly likely” overall increase related mass protests erupted death [name] well clusters social gatherings restaurants private parties. part increase denominator (cases) higher rate increase numerator (deaths) resulting lower percentage (mortality rate) people Redditt understand? certainly strong indictment school system. think that’s song.. Poland didn’t fuck about, sending police almost daily. observing. Disheartening sure. Important remember HUGE LA County though, long tests happening here. though, disheartening. joke needs publicly stated ~60% Republicans think deadly Maybe is. Except temporarily pandemic over. I’ll needing scan soon check see wtf happened lungs sick early January think he/she meant contagious. remember somewhere March/April sitting breakfast discussion family 3000 cases per day New York feeling horrified shocked. Thinking worst. Now, looking 3000+ cases least 5 states seems unreal. 5500+. Cases unfathomable. deaths would enormous. see mostly lot get treatment needed due shortages care beds disease itself. Sadly normal times deaths would mostly preventable proper care West Germany locked new outbreak. 

I wonder anything EU free roam policy happens State Tv it’s various supporters pushing want selfish needs happening. It’s definitely Bizzaro World there. brother lives NJ. works Borgata Casino, AC.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Right now. Yes. want everyone live well. means closing borders States, highest death rate virus, yes. sorry. welcome after. Florida 24 hours believe. number get updated till tomorrow. claiming whole thing planned, what? say masks work Bill Gate's marxist facial recognition vaccine plot, problem solved. key inject sunlight eyeballs, safe never answered question. alternative choice leader? You’re quick demonize decision, happened? 

My problem saying made poor decision, providing alternative decision wanted make, using attack character simply politician. Washing hair every day really bad it. mine 2 3 times week, increased it. evidence surface transmission (touching something virus sitting on) makes small portion infections. It’s likely state governments flex enough heat administration stop this. require governors want apply pressure. I'm pretty confident 2+2=10 vaccine ready, ready mean available least high risk folks, nobody really safe.

All reduce much risk possible trying live semi normal life. Younger people less likely die, still severe illness, organ shut down, complications long they're free virus. reported. gyms, movie theaters. Abbott's dithering refusal take statewide action reason Texas mess. right thing cancel it. haven’t done yet. persistent conflict interest there’s denying that. ""mad dog"" ""chaos"" says good idea wear mask, wear mask. hitting something here. I’m epidemiologist bewildered tactics used discourage people hoarding masks PPE frontline healthcare workers access them. Even though masks **not** protect wearer contracting virus, prevent spread people 60-70%. made sense public health officials changed stance one recommendation without really convincing public reasons, largely ignoring it. also doesn’t help lot people choose care people’s health long seemingly healthy, choose ignore mask guidelines. 

**Bottom line: Wear mask curtail spread virus.** Even huge outbreak came initial conditions would totally different. enough control spread? Nobody knows.

Testing? Increased 10x months.
Blood tests? even exist february.
Masks? Governments saying wear masks shortages there's plenty.
Ventilators? shortage anymore.
Extra ICU beds? available ready reopen.
Facilities isolation? Setup.
Experience previous lockdown measures? Check.
Contact tracing apps? Available since weeks.

So outbreaks fought weapons before. Got link? thought coronavirus didn’t spread protests! That’s media says! Donald rally bad, thousands gathered protest food right? It’s like educated leader saw happened China didn’t apply xenophobic mindset actions. said, NZ universal healthcare, small population, island definitely instrumental operation. you’ve played Plague Inc, know hard get island nations like NZ, Greenland, Madagascar, etc. confirm. waiting months point endoscopy see WTF GI tract. Germany huge capacity intensive care units, took covid patients surrounding countries help ;) Again? issues there. ones entering lying border offices. following Canada’s laws. source net gains hospitalizations? cousin insisting hospitalizations Texas, Florida Arizona trending despite surging case totals. kardashian/abortion/emergence nazi zombies next level. “War peace

I wish included inalienable rights ability proper healthcare despite employer, paid leave, new generation people don’t spend life paying college debt. Well. Rising number cases means I'll working remotely longer period time I'm cool with. Keep shooting foot america. ""If want listen, must feel"" - Afrikaans saying means get hiding, one way another. Tegnell run country yet? Sweden's parliament? sacked government 2 months ago. purchased insurance Chapter 7 Bankruptcy plan. leading American brand insurance. You’re observant! I'm scheduled long-delayed elective* procedure next month Florida. Yeah, happening.

*It's really elective. diagnostic. life-threatening are. New York, talking America here, Yankee pos.  went local pub Aachen 2nd last Bundesliga games. mask gloves, hat long sleeved sweater.

I fill form date, full name, address, phone number number table sitting at, along approximate time arrival departure.

One person per table. Maybe people need compliant (wash hands keep distant), selfish naive. welcome. Read said. don’t want people could carry deadly disease. Anytime that, come one come all! taught go business asap. Cause hate mercy employer situation. update per day 11 seriously ctrl+c, ctrl+v history every \~100 years.

It sort makes sense consider human life expectancy average intelligence. Maybe protests great idea Meanwhile positive things NJ/NY area I'm getting super frustrated everyone taking victory lap.

As someone Northeast, I'm getting anxious cases getting better rapidly reopening states outbreaks spread back region.

It feels like roles reversed. states said New York problem months ago New York basically saying oh that's states problem. ...and yet things done home without endangering anyone. point good though? Testing became important could isolate cases stop spreading. spread, benefit knowing bring? lots shouting someone compassion mean little relief? unable get unemployment benefits reason? Apart half-baked strawman points, saying proves nothing prove point making. We'll get another round peanuts another trillion rich. That's guess. Always looking silver lining.  it’s younger healthier people getting Covid expect fewer serious conditions proportion total infections.  thread sums thoughts well. understand family sees radically, I'm ”letting virus control life.” Lol sorry dad, shit fucking owns us right now, whether like not. dramatic. Go wedding. $600 insulin. Epipen price gouging. million dollar hospital bill guy recovered. Hospitals sued keep prices secret. U.S.A. health care system utterly corrupt. get caught mask one on, disqualified unemployment. 

You able CAUSE economy lockdown also benefit it.  argument increased ICU beds provide better care fewer patients would have? That's take heard now. 


P.S. add clarity, increased ICU bed numbers peak epidemic April since first half May saw going also lowered number beds. 20% previous total capacity less 1/3 taken covid-19 patients. Oh you’re talking personal space? wish people would respect given day it’s random respects I’ve noticed. guys worried construction business going become viable something?

Sounds like non-problem. nope. never still first wave. locked March chance idiots wait long make decision **If??** issue closing travel China &amp; Europe taking responsibility there. Governors could fuck constantly media going blame Trump dumb thought get heat it. results missing age group. 46 - 54. I'd say poll data flawed already. Says guy subreddit mostly doom gloom agree core message, trappings. locked March chance Wait till school starts back up. Yeah lucky enough finally get unemployment, I’ve resigned never getting $600 week entitled Yes it’s over. Except Texas. Thats cool...tons people still wearing masks  enjoyable somewhat. know two people always seems untouchable consequences. Oh understood consequences. never really situation truly *fucked*. Now, fighting lives. blame taking stuff seriously. God hope learn lessons. guess theme “we’re sacrificing lives help get herd immunity?” might able live that. Serious? Cause see lot people supporting this. Going out, wearing masks, getting mad lockdown.  Shit problem administration spent months virus emerging making landfall USA, actually, dunno, preparing? fucking embarrassing. lady saw probably saw post stupid anti-vaxxer FB group questioning doctor credentials? Whoo boy. NOBODY SAYING DESERVED DIE. Yes thats done originally. work retail majority people see come without masks elderly. People worry coronavirus contract Putin. saw post r/Tampa thing Nice hear :-) I'll take those, thank you! Let's get apocalypse party started! Wait thought younger generations smart kind? would boomers support lockdown more?? 42k new cases? Holy shit...😳 ""I said people, slow testing down, please"" people say. need hear side. Doesn’t negate toxic post history. Imagine insulting countrymen. Sure, bud. Keep up. 👍 Guelph, Ontario Past certain point, person responding really add much.

A good sample roughly 1000 get 3% margin error, regardless size population. Brilliant analysis   agree, proud us hitting peak supposed late april/early may

Yet Thanks! I’ve edited post make clearer Oh preprint, I'm still takin' ezy. Yes even biggest predictions U.S hitting one million deaths, many people unemployed financially struggling shutdown again? I’m stoked realization finite resources overconsumption make economy extremely fragile case pandemic “non essential” businesses get closed. shows need start acting way greener planet communities. Stop buying useless shit spend time productive (gardening, creating, reusing, local based products instead imported goods) Oh saw it.. hoping one stupid enough that.. mom, working hotel. making less unemployment :/ scenario process Las Vegas. Testing widely available run national guard. others pointed out, $600 still going extended, there's huge fucking caveat..

People also realize $600 needs taxes paid it. Nobody likes ted cruz mean $1200 last 4 months? want responsibility difficult problem governors shit prep reacted properly. need president shutdown early enforce social distancing. said can't rely 50 governors right thing. People would've cried Trump shut everything himself. Thx. tried really hard feel bit bad artist move Canada ""He couldnt get job felon. Completely agree. read WSB man like seeing jokes leaking. ...


...


Did fix it? state current cases ever doesn’t seem slowing down.

And yet, still think idiots fight another lockdown ignore it. need icu capacity people strokes, heart attacks, accidents etc. rate ICU covid patients weeks. There’s also question enough health care workers cover surge. ICU people elective procedures. FIL put pretty major March surgery two weeks ago. never go ICU recovery. Yup. None girlfriend's unemployment checks came neither us got stimulus checks. hours got cut. borrow money parents.  country dumb. usual, 35% morons. going back lockdown frend. 100% going happen. Right around September. wonder whose fault is...... /s

FYI: past days, state government told school districts could force students remote learning.  Fortunately, district offering option. Meanwhile, majority people covid poor countries can't get health care; can't get ventilators even oxygen. Tack ""1"" front, today.

16k, 6k everyone obese eat much. 


Yeah idiot. Unless break laws physics always lose weight eating less. ""medical condition"" ass, excuse stuff face. medical condition breaks rule calories &lt; calories really good idea. Lowball estimate. Disney+ subscriptions? Fvck em' .. point folks simple masking &amp; hand washing need removed society. Let's hope take many innocents them. didn’t wear masks office weren’t near other. Also there’s culture virus bogus, provide masks though guess fault Common sense says protests caused covid spread. Lowball estimate I'm pretty fucking grateful european. work hospital direct contact ICU's. worked one week shifts keep exposure bare minimum. home every week, still paycheck. Almost, still quite. follow articles SARS-CoV-2 college spring break trip (March 14–19) led 64 cases, including 60 among 183 vacation travelers, one among 13 household contacts, three among 35 community contacts. Prompt epidemiologic investigation, effective contact tracing cooperation university public health department, contributed outbreak control.

TLDR: 60 college students confirmed positive 183 spring break. 4 others also contracted covid result incident. didn’t take poll add list yes votes lol Wait, didn’t President say pan-dam-it over? guess Texas didn’t get word. Lies! LIES!!! expected result younger members population ones running around getting infected.   viruses mutate survive? Maybe that's option listed within article. MAGAs California total people living multiple states combined. pretend marathon BLM protest...problem solved! It’s really frustrating apparently profoundly ignorant cannot understand happened must wear cloth masks. mean, seen explained many different ways. done research spent time critical analysis. crystal clear originally made recommendation later changed. don’t even college degree. MANY people country seem fundamentally unable receive updated info, research, think critically, form conclusions aren’t tangled conspiracy theories. It’s like we’re dumb box rocks, yet believe better everyone else. Embarrassing. Literally yesterday read headline Houston 90% expected hit full within 2 week. I’m probably thinking headline meant two days Sure, often does, also correlation =/= causation. least Texas, good percent new cases younger people, presumably healthier better able fight virus.

Add that, we've learned things treat patients.

So I'm hopeful number cases rises death rate stays low. That's guess layman, though. File every unemployment benefit can. Thankfully take precautions lot less stupid end this. number people saying 'it's bad - staying home, there's Netflix food!' made realize bleak many people's lives pre-lockdown. Really impressed young crowd get slim majority favor sheltering 3.6 roentgen. great, terrible.  way reopen. Haha exactly.  Got screwed first time, get screwed next time happens. Forced work, risk lives, extra pay, everyone else gets paid 600$ week stay home. Hell yeah people want another paid vacation. Me..... I'm looking forward grocery store jam packed bored people paid vacation day every day AGAIN. Fauchi say January?  Thank you, actually really cool people acknowledge shit storm makes us feel crazy. think Riverside reports deaths weekends. noticed earlier week. Abbott waste oxygen. real shame tree limb end him. Even effective mask: STFU  understand could executive order exceptions. People coming 4 weeks vs everybody state losing jobs. Take pick. also $2000 pre tax, taxable income. dont actually get keep full amount. analysis seems pretty much line study. idiot Covid spread mucus, getting corpse unless sneezes you, shove hands nose lick fingers. 😂 got it. Can't blame them. rest world supposed ""America First"" like are? many places rate positive results increasing, matter testing level. Throw us(SC) mix tell you’ve lived sheltered life. “Parents failed miserably” comment shows disconnected are. good parents whose kids developed drug/alcohol problems, get high horse. paranoid, I'm going public least. muh, fReEdOm One MANY MANY flaws political system. Pulm-etto State understand that. understand said? Doubt it. lean Left listening Trump? unfortunately unless unemployment finally gets back, could receive PUA unless decide fuck us again. Salvation Army said qualify they'd call us back 24 hours. 7 days ago. answer anymore call time said ""you're list"", they're swamped guess. final hail mary throw filed EIDL grant opened contract workers. Thank concern though really :) fine, clear. Hand sanitizer incomplete coverage. Door handles, pump bottles, faucet knobs etc. must touched wash/sanitize hands. Yes hand washing important gloves, used properly gloves add additional hygiene. Nobody sanitizing washing hands touching items store, poor comparison say gloves would problem ungloved hands wouldn't. 

At least far protecting yourself, wear gloves shopping, touch face remove after. put gloves pump gas. mean, wear gloves buy groceries, remove exiting store, sanitize hands car even safer touching everything sanitizing hands. worried gonna run gloves something you? might see effect California numbers masks requirements?

If masks working would California numbers look different compared Arizona? Obviously California numbers would going Arizona's would going would Arizona's doubling every two three days? Doubling every seven days? 2020 fake news. wife 700 people reporting her, work home time need to. fully supportive, dont get work done plus manner, last long her. Tell boss would like work home health concerns, productive ever. Then, follow through. what's untrue? want politicians nothing next weeks case growth slows. Like Sweden. message Italian doctor resaon doubt seeing.

Both groups made clinical observations offered conjecture causes. hoping someone would dug deeper this.

In case Western PA comparatively (and IMHO inexplicably) spared thing believe Washington well recently hospital shut basically waiting surge COVID patients. 7 cases total whole county today’s news briefing. went back surgeries recently haven’t yet gotten surge. let’s go Florida play ball! I'm 30s live parents

Reddit nutshell Kinda interesting though. Living around city decent size (all relative compadres) Denmark yet see person mask besides hairdresser. stay fuck home strategy took edge spread. People politicizing masks = entire GOP right wing media. I’m glad dad able think issue, many not. Boomhauer / South Park blend great  reason decision made is

Everyone knows Ignoring advice

No one's obviously measure taken INCREASE POTENTIAL SURVIVAL.

We Literally point make contrary 

No one making point contrary.


You're arguing strawman TRIVID-57 almost like 7-year old throwing tantrum knowing even want. Hey asshole, collectively chose elect fuckwit state government. collectively decided follow recommendations inbred government. collectively decided lied follow fucking idiot pretends run country. Maybe someone drowning swamp seem high horse, I'm actually grounded reality. Try pull state backwards uneducated idiotic ways. done last month ffs... Lol nah tho. know numbers Europe nonsense, many countries massively reporting deaths (estimated possibly double Italy example). admit swab dead people (which here) thousands extra deaths baseline. Plus count every death positive swab corona death even bullet head. Every city earth experience peaks there's herd immunity vaccine matters critical care capacity overwhelmed, Europe rationed care, even touched us capacity ICU beds vents 5x per capita assy healthcare systems Europe. need back patting, we've managed pandemic like shit. We've locked way aggressively caused far deaths saved. agree  sure launched Disney+ service best possible time... months everything shut down, capacity issues growing pains addressed time handle flood desperate parents signing keep kids occupied. get President board like them. ....and almost certainly access things like convalescent plasma, means nearly threat him. I'm speculating, clear.  Low labor mobility could make area suffer longer, since local wages get depressed etc, leading supressed demand long time. national labor market, local wages likely less affected severity virus hit, making demand stable. Tar Lung state Well hell, guess kill virus cops.....smdh think they'll hit full capacity 2 weeks, think they'll hit around 1.... need shutdown now! Shutdown vaccine stay shut till enough people receive it. vaccine mandatory well. believe extra $600 unemployment benefits finished end July. Anecdotal stories accepted lean negative. That's here. knew going happen. know out, instead banding together humans, us point fingers Protesters us point fingers Cops, Karens Branch Covidians flavors sizes.

We’re like plane going flames rainbow vapor trail flight attendants still serving drinks (to First Class passengers only). Sweden better countries Europe strictest *police enforced* lockdowns Europe. worse Nordic neighbours. prove?

The countries strictest lockdowns countries also highest rates deaths per capita world. prove lockdowns work? Could prove lockdowns make situation worse?

Sweden's neighbours much lower death rate. prove lockdowns work? prove less stringent lockdowns UK, Italy Spain, stringent measures Sweden took, best approach? 

Or prove anything all? 

Do see pointless debate is? Without real analysis everything, we're even close untangling web. take years happen. even then, conclusions never concrete. 

And - debate focuses almost entirely death rates finances within developed world - pointless debate held vaccum. 

No - Sweden island. everyone treating like one? see relevant. government levels completely failed mobilize slow spread did. countries taken bold action decisively turned tide. done slow torrent temporarily set people loose spread faster ever. Ok. 12k die due tobacco use year Sweden, feel equally disgusted tobacco use allowed Sweden? hypocrite. 
Sure worst flue season 20 years things could handled better, it’s catastrophe. This. It’s *********** shame source things China. 

They really close 90% stores. Hopefully get good products. Forgive inferring meaning thread article oxygen supply shortages... understanding virus give shit reasoning around hundreds people hours, problem.  Yeah see lot well news articles lung transplants. 0 dollars necessary qualifies preventative care health insurance. Hmmm... overcrowding infectious patients seems quite bad idea. Especially seems disease severity seems correlate inoculation dose. majority subreddit would love nothing right. Nobody wearing masks Florida.
My two kids ones.
Ft. Walton. Tremendously, like u never fucked before! Rubio near reddits least favorite. probably goes McConnell Graham. Rubio still tool, bit he's near bottom.  That's true all. Mostly. I'd say 10-15% businesses restaurants follow health guidelines (this demonstrated dallas Mark Cuban's secret shoppers). think complete hoax, others seem care, others yet terrified fellow texans' behavior. stats meaningful, cases spiking current hospitalization death rates irrelevant sure hell won’t rates month. depends going. Triangle handling better say Piedmont/Sandhills areas. can't speak Charlotte certainty people would imagine like Triangle. smaller town less would expect people taking seriously. live Fayetteville seeing people wearing masks rare. People crowd lobbies restaurants generally behave like virus real. waited June 24th, three months pandemic started, finally say something cavalier matter. least give N95 masks, think may beyond competence current authorities. ended ten total, actually, spread campaign teams secret service. thought Vishnu Shiva pack frauds. lol. true. fuck people, get pity me. People probably wear right wear them. Tons wearing masks nose, covering mouth. appears cover holes along beak. I'm willing make modifications name public health. This. survey 2420 people nearly big enough sample size represent American population, especially considering probably localized section country. I’m calling biased.

In current state hope financial support government, I’m willing bet 65% us younger 70 (the working class) would rather catch corona risk death close economy again. dumbass brother-in-law moved Texas. exposed positive coworker days ago getting tested. travelling across country plane state next week! family sees nothing wrong this..... People agree lockdown unpaid : &lt;65% “*So said people, 'slow testing down, please.*'”

Doesn't sound like joke now. dumbfounded see badly handling this. country's refusal admit make mistakes going destroy us. bad wont think depends at. I'm planning small July 4th outdoor BBQ next week 10 people. I've following cases area closely, work lab covid testing. region right there's couple hundred active cases we're okay, great, contact tracing. Everything positive past weeks nursing homes, factory lines institutions like jails. Two people coming already recovered 8 going bars restaurants high risk areas. work, shop, home.

Is risk? course is, think we've made acceptable. things, cautious. Reporting NYC (work Manhattan) company pretty good far handling things made bunch us come back office week (which whole issue commute completely fucked). workplace filled signs, hand washing stations, etc. masks I’d say half employees already started give fuck *3 fucking days in.* Plenty maskless people roaming physical distancing lessens day. 

So yeah, people don’t give fuck. must dispel notion mask doesn’t protect context $500 billion US militaries annual budget twice size China's militaries annual budget.

With amount money could pay entire French, German UK military 10 years. stupid large amount money go missing.

It's slightly less Walmart's entire yearly global revenue. almost revenue worldwide company multiple subsidiaries 2.2 million workers.

It's yearly revenue Sinopec group, largest oil gas company world. GDP nation states. Yet gone missing. could buy enough gold equal weight 39 statue liberties (assuming amount gold even exists). Supply demand limits. enough everybody. say production could possibly ramped supply everybody. ***Survey 2,420 U.S. adults age, June 16-23*** 

Kind misleading title 2.4k votes 300+ Million americans  Less 15% reddit's userbase younger 18. Temperature probably matter much, virus decay quickly surfaces warmer, since believe vast majority infection happen directly person-to-person, happens surfaces huge impact spread.

The bigger problem extreme heat extreme cold make people stay indoors, air conditioning, indoors transmittion huge problem. According one Japanese study, enclosed indoor environments 19 time likely cause Covid transmisson outdoor spaces. air conditioning re-circulating air, even worse, currents send droplets much farther 6 feet, see illustrations happens.

Humidity probably also play role, evidence humid environments help reduce transmission influenza virus, theory infectious droplets hit water particles air travel far. think verified Covid seems plausible. I’m you! I’m single mom, essential, remote worker child summer school. I’m currently writing email begging family help virtually schooling. IT’S FUCKING DIFFICULT. apartment owners believe they’re going able move property? They’ll kicking people property sit empty. It’s moronic. one guy Disney took Disney + sub instead cast member pass parks totally agree, \*supposed\* public health. people politicizing it. Notice people one particular political persuasion wearing masks. Technically power, could coordinated national effort encouraged people take seriously instead dumpster fire gave us. huge spike early nursing homes. 

Thing even doesn’t kill lot patients ending life long lung damage coming back suffering strokes arterial issues... attributed covid deaths. It’s becoming less problematic it’s problem obfuscated looking confirmed covid deaths fully reported. live Virginia unemployment suuuper easy get too. automated payment fast. states suck! people wear masks care many people die able return Yeah well contagion virus 50 times deadly covid. crazy apprehensive taking barely tested vaccine. Ok, let's see think reasons retarded:

Masks useful preventing people getting protecting wearer

How defining people color? know someone black whose first cousin looks completely white even though parents black. draw line?

There million ways combat racism, discriminating white people one them

Lastly, fuck even legal? sane white person want wear mask arrested/fined/cited slam-dunk billion dollar lawsuit. Imagine roles reversed? unacceptable. absolutely nothing modern medicine COVID-19 make life less miserable immune system fights it.

The thing avoid people congregations and, can't avoid them, use mask cover nose mouth. Jr. said he’d tried get three larger Houston hospitals aggressive treatments, like plasma treatments, conducted tried go everywhere Houston beds available,"" said.   
  Rodriguez died June 8. mother died June 9. day, father airlifted UTMB Galveston bed became available, 10 days later, June 19, died, sick making funeral arrangements. I’m sick it,"" Rodriguez Jr. add heartbreak, Rodriguez Jr.'s sister spent two weeks hospitalized COVID-19 unable attend funerals.
  need open. understand that. please, somebody else’s sake, wear mask case you’re sick? It’s devastated us,"" Rodriguez Jr. said.**    

   
I feel bad. fucking horrible American Public Media issued bi-weekly update today analyzing COVID-19 deaths race ethnicity.

[APM: 1 1,500 Black Americans died continues show Black Americans dying virus 2.5-3x rate Whites Asians, 2.25x Latinos. They're mandatory wear shops Germany right now. People wear fact government telling so. kinda feel results little unreliable cuz someone who's unwilling stay lockdown probably bothered take survey first place Feels good Canadian rn governors states opened early basically playing russian roulette. Sure, go well time lucky. sooner later bite bullet. pretty darn difficult walk off! Worldometers highest day 39k going take weeks numbers show impact.

good luck Texas.

other states joining party, unfortunately. [Same fucking thing happening families NJ 3 months need dose reality think reach 1 million

Less half million died worldwide virus last 6 months

If took deadliest day pandemic, april 21 2,693 deaths, multiplied day course entire year , still wouldn’t quite reach 1 million take initiative stop completely relying country’s information, sucks due mostly shit leaders. know shit leaders, still look guidance. (why?)

I’ve read hell lot comments thread, mainly people saying blame leaders country. 

Maybe blame one half country stupid selfish people. people won’t change mind basically members biggest cult world! 

In seriousness, cannot believe fact many people country yet realise extent done. murderers. successfully spread virus selfishness killed 120,000 people now. Seems thing free country free conscience . 65% unemployment +$600 extra week 90% time people say issue caused ""lack education,"" they're really complaining people know interpret specific facts exactly (without shred epistemic humility, course). Raising education funding isn't, be, panacea differing worldviews. happy cake day. Seems like options quarantine healthcare system collapse, neither exactly ideal. guy who's responsible 120k dead Americans incompetence? Yeah, really hard. bit late given anybody looks ""north American"" ""South American"" ""European"" significantly higher chance actually infected... need UBI feel. particularly dislike Yang's approach, less cannibalizes social safety net making ""a choice"". main problem UBI crowd tendency treat UBI silver bullet, still need food stamps housing programs alongside it. We'll still need fundamental overhaul housing landlords allowed business even think tossing UBI there. 

UBI needs spring robust social safety net, much UBI scene right seems focusing UBI alternative safety net. solution UBI extra cash solve problems clearly fundamental money itself.

Really though feel like UBI half-measure core though. need go deeper really fix problem UBI tries address. ""Questioning institution continued existence money neoliberal commodification human life."" sorta stuff I'm sure are. think lockdown spikes. Well, I'm expert, assuming got laid again, would eligible unemployment benefits again. forgot mention people protesting BLM. involves 1,000's times many people protesting lockdown. protests HUGE. course going make people think need stay lockdown. doctors media supporting protests. BLM protests biggest contributors people staying now. Anyone says different complete moron. Since left protests comment makes think idea going on. even commenting stuff naive going on? Great idea! peel off, leave inside bin them. state “meeting requirements reopening” writing gov BEG reopen already are. may assumption say “majority.”  That's one reasons like restaurants hotels. 

It's also want make robots suffer, give orders know would rather them. Wife loves avocado toast.

From Texas.  Yeah something like hopefully, reason forgetting COVID exists working, color shocked Nahhhh gonna wish best. Saudi Arabia first time history canceling Hajj Mecca COVID concerns. Meanwhile Trump filled church town last night. Hummm stupid.

Yeah, maybe 200 years ago ol'homestead protected you. went town month hardly towners.

But rural areas days like that. Many people commute cities. come back home everyone visits markets, restaurants, churches. takes one person COVID start coughing point whole community end shortly. Good thing it’s gonna happen Source though? don’t believe want see it. know, I'm saying is, alien came tonight offered give actual working vaccine stop virus dead week, saw shit humans doing, would destroy vaccine probably nuke planet good measure. ironically would indeed vaccine different kind huh. Lol can’t get 95% people brush teeth argument there. Politics science *can* coexist, politics driving science. Maybe look something called confidence interval Yeah, that’s sort I’m getting at. It’s moving place place keep getting headlines city X Z plunging disaster, actually big picture numbers dropping months.

 I’m saying shouldn’t careful won’t second wave anything like that, actual numbers stand aren’t necessarily reflection one might imagine scanning headlines. "" Phase I/II clinical trial accrue 40 healthy adults age 65. ""

It's start, shows preliminary safety efficacy I'm going get excited. Wow. Well, I'm glad family. probably would cut long time ago. blame time? # 35% awful LOUD nearly identical experience I'm sharing. muscle aches, extreme fatigue, brain fog, sleeping problems, problems around house like influenza.

And yeah, literally _everything_ story suggests depression. People chronic fatigue often trouble finding helpful diagnosis precisely overlaps much number diagnoses including depression. would ace HAM-D symptoms describing. never said depression. Ye, they're incorrect. 1/3 hospitalized lasting damage. would range 2% covid. good guess starting point.

That would range 40,000 NYC, probably we'd get data first. 10,000 Bergamo province. No, seeking unemployment. seeking fairness. nothing bigger government, put us charge people's lives keep alive, give money turn backs us, labor government. live principles find another job always past, multiple jobs once. cautious ≠ living fear. 

But acting like particular story nothing concerned naive. different people different definitions quality life. 

Some people like nicotine high cigarettes. people fear lung cancer think worth it. latter group able force standards former group. Sadly even many health experts literally said social distancing really matter long something important, saying along social distancing even *more* important cannot even fathom public concern restored unconscionable renunciation concern experts themselves. therefore millions followers didn’t take seriously either. Holy shit, state in? New York New Jersey, we’re opening restaurants outdoor dining. Around 60% people outside wear masks, bit lower recent weeks. Ohio live? I'm Franklin County say see 50% mask usage here. disappointing. love idea haha. It’ll never happen, it’s truly great idea! get one life game. 
No overs Alright!!!!! little eyes wide shut action, get Yeah 92 people refused testing beyond even got reported on. i.....wasn't serious. That's simply true, sorry. mortality rate lower flu. Also, there's difference cautious paranoid. want put risky situation could get virus, worse spread vulnerable people (like gf's 95 year old grandma, 67 year old parents, etc.) that's paranoid. That's smart, safe. mean, hard enforce policies limiting 15 people time 6 feet apart 1/8th people paying rent there. Can't even get office building place. wish would give back rent money people staying there.

Can't tell Crickets though, I'm certainly going (maybe early Sunday pool though....) Look. idea bands googled static x and, yes, lead singer dead, importantly album called ‘Wisconsin Death Trip’?!? IRONY What? can't? missing something lol “Keep books” meaning enforcing select laws?

I’m baffled. Costa Rica handling everything far? I've heard looking open airports recently spike may go lockdown. truth that, provide insight? Oh, showed me. believe it. NYT / Siena College poll Biden 50%, Trump 36%, 14% undecided. Adds up.

Edit: typo Siena love good Facebook debate. latest people say never wear mask get vaccine, want everything reopened immediately. tell could reopen everything within 2 weeks people actually wore masks reduced spread virus, they're nincompoops crybabies simple mask prolonging economic issues. Great ratings! Huge! Survey 2,420

What sample. pretty much changed bribes suggesting came directly persuade (someone) act one's favor gift money inducement. gigantic death rate highly contagious disease.

Also note death rate dropping, according current estimations, people susceptible dangerous symptoms laying low. people get it, statistically speaking, eventually may dam-breaking event near impossible susceptible population avoid contact still get ill.

Wouln't surprised huge death hike come fall given US's current handling this.  global pandemic is, definition, everybody's problem. looks tough showed liberals... if... thing also forecast Vanessa Hudgens coming place ""sleepover"" August celebrate fact lottery nineteen times row? 180k hopelessly optimistic point. I'm cool another lockdown, real lockdown. stopped working one day since started. make lamps ballasts horticulture. Honestly make weed lamps. Since marijuana medicine, considered essential. real problem weed illegal Ohio. go public twice much, can't smoke product make shit for? dad works cabinet factory. work sacrificial. brothers job welding factory also nothing essential. 
 
So unless real, ""You can't find loopholes"" lockdown bullshit. know ton people lost jobs wife included. waitress. factories N.E Ohio found loopholes made essential business. Semi custom cabinets essential, grow lamps marijuana still illegal country essential, whatever brother place welds essential. 

I hate whole fucking thing. sacrificial essential. “personal responsibility”

HAHAHAHAHA. America. entitled people history planet. HAHAHAHA. arent kissing spitting others mouths dont believe actually dedicated cause. Must paid actors. super eh? bunch Jabronies Perhaps erect dome around 3 weeks go home kill grandma. Deaths keep trending however. I'm fine another lockdown, really work first time. did, huge spike cases again. 35% going completely negate effects lockdown continue spread virus. sure people want get tested. People covid tested positive likely die people covid tested. /jk based asymptomatic less likely tested funny thing exponential growth grows slowly first, there's certain inflection point suddenly growth rate goes increasing pace. 65% dident get layed trying feed family's th money also homeless soon  boat. Late 20s, lost job moved back parents 60s. live New York reopening slowly without major spikes far. still go unless absolutely necessary. hope everyone else country turn corner this. We're going break times week over. Sometimes shit happens Pandemic became political, I'll never understand. county Yakima, firmly Trump county hours away CHAZ/CHOP. system isnt designed kinda traffic, really simple. designed 2 5 million week 30 40. system set extraordinary measures like this. would result staffing 10x amount people 99.99% time huge waste spending. know selfish say. quality life drastically improved this. Yea going bars restaurants drag. 

But idk work life balance never great, I'm much happier due WFH. hope things improve everyone really hope new consumer/work trends develop/persist. Sadly, one thing Cuomo done take care outbreaks within prison population. He's refused release non-violent offenders despite research showing thats best way curb outbreaks within prisons. He's also used time reverse rule passed long ago, limiting required bail based income. 

So he's actually put prison COVID, rather fight outbreaks release people deserve released.  Fucking stupid. Well european not, people getting laid losing businesses anyway. Almost 50% restaurants bars closed permanently one city due this. could ever predicted would happen? /s I’m California. that’s shithole. Tennessee right. trump voter either. You’re really striking today. Found person won’t wear mask public feel shame it, mention get snide comments do. 
 Yes enjoy time get them, much better relationship brother value that. Also rent pays mortgage instead landlord. Jonestown national scale. economic system ruined affect normal people top lmao. Exactly felt learned it. you

ps. said wanted strong federal response....did want federal government quarantine NYC? Apology accepted.  Meanwhile, [the administration pulling federal testing sites, mainly located Texas. administration wants Americans die. think make disappear reduce testing. Yup, yes please.

But, late, asshole. takes 3-4 weeks cases reflect protests. 

Hardly. longest 15 average 4-7 days. incubate month... it’s probably reopening dumbasses actually protested protective wear probably still aren’t wearing masks definitely still wearing red hats.

Your entire premise think 3-4 weeks. Best thing hope pray Oxford vaccine come! Altho likely we'll still dealing covid even vaccine comes (which highly doubt) shit can't hide heart attack, stroke, cancer, accident. hide fucking virus kills 10% people infuckted. deserve jet flying formation house much  Same, work hotel week I'm taking least 200$ paycut compared unemployment could already safely reopened maybe dozen cases virus across country actually taken lockdown seriously first place. people pushing economy reopen fucked us (and economy too) long haul. Weird seem unable see said 'net decrease'. goes show broken economic system really is. 

It's based lot smoke mirrors make rich people appear richer, heavy deficit spending interest make people richer lending money really have.

If economy measured people mind instead corporations, almost everyone would cheering end economic system. Sure makes want drop everything go Disney World. sure isn’t higher. 6 sites Texas, next NY sized hotspot get fed funding. Yeah don’t go statistics chart pops typing coronavirus. thing never accurate. worldometer accurate opinion. I’m state. Sitting waiting hard goes another lockdown. Cuomo doesn’t even know schools open back come September. He’s liking idea away schools least Pandemic everything online. Imagine immunity short-lived whatever reason we’re unable develop vaccine. honestly think would push us collapse.

There seems pretty wide variation individuals respond infection - show symptoms, die. Eventually probably sort genetic test tells people whether one prone deadly case likely mild case. Even there's vaccine immunity short-lived, people react mildly able resume normal life. takes years get point, yeah, see society continue function. certainly return ""normal"" NY county residence 16 new cases last week, total active cases 74, population 180,000. We've tested 31,000. Back April 20-80 new positives per day. summer here, there's flood weekenders NYC coming thru.

Cuomo New York State made mistakes, people New York done great job stepping curve. thank good leadership Governor, importantly, individuals changed behavior common good.

Dozens states record rising daily cases excuse even better. Must nice, therapy clinic US still require patients wear masks.

You even want hear rest personal hell. I'm curious see turnout like line like one. Even worse (IIRC) studies shown people contagious right showing symptoms, symptoms next day, potentially peak contagiousness bar. need petition mods SUSPEND automod types posts. settings literally removes without review comments mentioning certain words frankly necessary given topic, flagged verboten ""nO P0L1TiCs!"" That’s going backfire, refuse believe otherwise. offense miss seeing friends able hang normally, miss going library, arcade, board game stores. Staying home able see anyone aside partner living life, actually. Go bars, get (a) Corona. That's works. state mandated lockdown, hard economy, another lockdown would fuck many people end millions streets. need individuals lockdown much can.

Though wont, fucked. MaFreeDumb states get keep way staying open disparaging wearing masks public... Count 35% neighbor's son granddaughter come visit home Wuhan Christmas. daughter law arrived, 40 person rural Oklahoma neighborhood, mid January. ""Slightly worrisome"" understatement, entered quarantine three doors us monitored twice daily temp checks local health department. coupd come outside come within 15 feet anyone live there. plans anything outside city, even much outside neighbourhood. 
 really hard either. 
I read article really made lake sense. grandparents fought ww2, great grandparents first war spanish flu. 
All asked sit butt home, yet can't. Maybe humanity meant expiry date going back work

OMG, people going work? kind craziness that? mean government needs taxes operate? WTF? thought everyone chilling home months would work fine... mean stock market up. Right?!?!?!?!

It's damage work!!!!!! Stop working lockdown!!!!!!

In real world people work. Reddit opinions real world. sucks daddy teach this. Go math number international travelers US monthly basis relative countries. Wear mask keep distance people. long young healthy, live alone, might beneficial get little birthday. Wash hands change clothes get home. Anyone complying masks social distancing need put house arrest. US government needs take hard line hope getting virus control That’s point I’m trying make - wouldn’t help transmission case they’re used sterile environment  doctor said seeing patients would dead within days surviving. think younger population. need understand governor incompetence legacy. Reminds SNL character ""girl wish started conversation  preferee Federer anyways We're find better treatments severe cases not.  knew first really bad weeks life turned waking nightmare would someday look back moments easy times pandemic. 

I know, know, shut up, d—mer, blah blah. Whatever’s ahead going hard, makes really sad. What, why? Seems really low considering 124k now. means would average around 548 deaths day make number. lowest 7 day average worldometer 620. find 11th, 10k week. 8,200 May 3,400 April. drove testing site today lines, waiting. see couple cars go through. lockdown screw us. Poor leadership combined poor public education system fucked us. economy made mechanism. literally made human beings. mechanism developed humans steered way desire. 

It adjusted, propped up, managed smart ways. want status quo change, won't.

The virus give shit economy, force nature. virus ""real"" made economy.  ran 26 weeks state unemployment insurance benefits, least California. extend extra $600 13 weeks July  1,365 cases Harris County alone today.

Fucking Kids going school Arizona coming home holidays visit family going kill lot grandparents. Please consider, it. Set police checkpoint direct people set aside hotel insist entering state. I've noticed pattern many Americans scared draw hard lines sand need hard lines sand stop virus. Happy cake day! It’s ironic took place voting year. Leadership compromised public approval. Rather safty absolute top priority; early reopenings risks made influence society lean certain ways. 

Make mistake pandemic over. Instead rushing return back normality, address issue core regardless uncomfortable is, must wait safely. 

Whoever wins election burden virus. seats solidified elections, believe real hard choices made best interests. Yeah expecting dumb didn’t happen Florida residents strangest opinions I've ever heard. hardly believe people exist. person actually tells experts they're going subject citizens arrest harming public, experts want wear masks? understand people end insane views. Reddit mostly comprised 14 year olds never paid taxes. know money comes care it. wasting time. Less 1D chess. He’s eating pieces. 10,000% service industry would love return making $1,000 week normal sleep schedule yelled ignorant people mean losing life job also going harm lot families. can’t feasibly base cost living specific areas, someone gets living mile city, even making amount. 

I’d say something like 10% annual income last filed taxes, throw brackets, every 10k increase income, pay back you’re able to. completely depends live. state/area declining/steady cases I'd say go it. one fun slightly risky thing staying indoors 3 months immoral. It’s late this. missed chance stop it, Trump GOP politicized virus ignored health experts made not. Small businesses survive another lockdown. Hell, may survive already, especially restaurants hospitality industry. Honestly workers retail stores New York ones seem masks pulled work talk most. Financial amnesty obligations bare minimum requirement government telling allowed work. crazy, common sense take?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* matter going away. wife talk too. looking forward buying first home lot things well returning buying food need longer waste much. orher news, water wet. vaccine? can’t force release something doesn’t exist. mean, rest country locked late March April would surge sooner. lot States ""re-opened"" month ago without virus contained, completely predictable surge would follow month two later. Well, power, nothing. outcome would said. fine latino people die COVID 8x rate white people, black people die 9x rate. perfectly fine sacrificing long white death equates 17+ non-whites dieing.

This openly discussed white supremacist message boards forums. idea factor proposterous. bet Trump's hoping enough people die election far-right supporters make actual majority. “*So said people, 'slow testing down, please.*'” 

Doesn't sound like joke now. federal government able take massive amounts debt. average person not. Right federal government needs take debt save average person, better position later productive tax paying member society. There's great book called ""Traffic drive way do"" goes brains wired tribal local, that's get mad drivers road, still think people tribe something intentional us, fellow member tribe. course Kinda sick projections tbh. blowhards clue, evidenced previous projections. Ignore science get fucking deserve. hive-mind, like corporations, doubt get ""is person"" status someday. ;) would considered hard lockdown NY well btw  Thanks. I've seen one really sucks phone. I'm pc though gather names dumbasses attenfing events, get treatment end Rona? Instead send trump, heal 😎 like Illegal Pete’s? guarantee see lot resistance well unfortunately Literally same. Requirement Florida resident visiting new york isnt gonna quarantine. joke It’s cus Trump said like.

Morons want open economy cus Trump sucked balls economic recovery plan besides unaccountable corporate bailouts. great they've taken strict measures, see 75k tests total appear testing less 200 people per day. place like NY tested 3.5 million people, obviously New York worse hit, state smaller population Taiwan. Testing seem aggressive, perhaps people lacking symptoms. still think would reassuring significantly larger percentage population tested. 'But may touch mask touch face, that's get it....'


Somehow none realize people still touch faces without masks, masks keep everyone Covid spraying everything Covid coughing, sneezing, breathing. gone, troll! I’m seeing lot houses come market area lot price drops. interesting see happens people start defaulting mortgages. This!!!!!!!!! I'm essential factory worker. care lose house. care fire sell assets. I, however want work insane amounts overtime. work 40, go quarantine.


I'm factory worker, police, nurses, firemen, etc... nation quarantined. well. 

The economy life. Hopefully one strong foundation. take massive overstaffing fix technical issues like hyphens apostrophes causing silent failures. take massive overstaffing build system functioning webform instead requiring people email filled PDFs month. require massive overstaffing build email confirmation lets know application received. things place independent current emergency. state, voted provide funding make upgrades almost decade ago, process got mired obstructionist hell funds pilfered local politicians insisted support systems expensive. get pay costs (and more) upgrade hurry emergency thousands poorest go months without income.

You can't convince financially responsible approach. I’m Canadian - clear that’s people unemployed due Covid. hasn’t stopped spiking speak yourself. I'm guy &amp; straight. Wisconsin ""lift lockdown"" crowd marched capital funded NRA. Well documented. Bonus, got bring AR15 downtown instead Walmart!  think country's debt really matters rn? We're fine throwing 2 trillion jet even work (and killed multiple pilots) saving lives means nothing? OK. “don’t want see people take foot gas come Friday.”

Exactly... I’m used masks now, I’ll probably keep wearing way past green phase

Take care! Spiraling control?

I suppose could anything thousands upon thousands people protesting rioting close proximity others. Nawww, be. Inflation entered chat. Definitely, elective surgery ban cases involving infection severe debilitation. relief mean money right? staying home? provide relief? financially bankrupt nation running multi-trillion dollar deceits 2020 already Social Security, reason pay more.

Unless cut defense budget 80%, happy d, money pay people wait out. already late contain thing. America, sorry is. Europe. suspect noticed hitting demographics would vote liberal allowed vote, probably high-fived chortled. r u even talking u read comment ? say anything offensive ? absolutely pathetic third people don't. people keep mentioning 2nd wave?

We still fucking first wave. Look state's numbers Arizona.

Fucking pathetic. Yes yes yessssss fucking hate quarantine. I'm extrovert anxiety depression, ruining mental health.

BUT I'D RATHER SUFFER DIE (or others die) If? dont listen state would ours? Deny entry. well within legal rights state so. company worked pandemic tour Amazon facility said learn they’re things.

Yeah, apparently not. follow using site since break every county US: cutoff 'days' 12am PST - 11:59pm PST.

cc: /u/jojirak /u/dadboddadjokes quarantine number places get tested - without getting stimulus checks wouldn’t Duh....  mention control pandemics really know good economy either.

The economy screwed shut down, don't. Mind well try save many possible rebuild over.  No, states face mask policies ones started opening up. Correlation causation yet seen. Give 5-6 weeks northeast that’s long took early open states see spikes. I’m New York maybe half people see stores wearing something covers mouth nose. nose least exposed. Thank you! ""entertainment"" bored people.

Edit: get little extra pay certainly $600 month. Ah see it'll take months find ended horribly easy sidetrack deflect issue base.

With testing immediately obvious us failing without notice excess deaths, giving weeks people die another weeks data collected collated. time say deaths higher year [insert bullshit] supporters eat up. might surprised many poor people vote Red Dude obesity health problem . paring contact tracing? Presidential seal mask wore camera auto plant pretty dope. agree. Instead, called hoax. population Houston alone issue. expect virus circle back Northern Hemisphere force mid end September true ""second wave"" call explode countries extremely confident beaten due lack lockdowns mitigation measures. I'm looking initial outbreak timeline globally China November last year Italy Iran USA etc. whole outbreak process took multiple months reach around world perspective 3 months spread lockdowns ended another 2 months full outbreak status achieved. Basically expect initial global outbreak timeline repeat mitigation measures stopped globally. November best estimate longer cope bullshit go such. I'm completely wrong might well November reflect opposite affected countries show stragglers small clusters most. probably still thousand person pool parties going big college apartments. Yeah sample people still milking $600 don’t want work they’d love another handout beef name? Grateful Canadian. worlds beginning open American leadership caused situation cases still peaking. New Zealand 1/100 size US (In population). could never sustain time would take kill here. I’m even sure single state population small theirs. countries aren’t already massive debt. number factors literally cannot take full scale lockdown economic standpoint survive. Plus cases honestly don’t matter much deaths. death curve decreasing states month. state less 10 every day almost nursing home residents severe health issues happen covid. live third dead last poorest state us highest rate heart disease diabetes country. ok it.

Further, lot states reporting numbers federal database also getting numbers directly county parish health departments. governor admitted doesn’t know many cases duplicates likely greatly overestimating number active cases have.

Edit 2: also authoritarian power many governments here. literally freest county world telling people cannot leave homes would fly majority population. Like would police wilds Montana Alaska tell ranchers bear hunters can’t leave? would go well. Orangesphincter said hox Governor Ohio shut well Cuomo did.

So don’t buy that. Cuomo screwed horribly. 

That said Cuomo changed tune. far southern Governor’s haven’t. comment removed using Presidents name saying that’s wants slow testing, Feds already stated they’re even stop funding states would pick tab. Nothing bad, apparently can’t put name post without deleted. CAAAAKE! mental i've watching basically daily since around 20th January now. 

I East Asia weeks end Jan / beg Feb, UK mid March funeral, seem hitting big epicentres right times lol. 

It insane 3k new cases China one day huge deal back then. Arizona. 

The US done absolutely appalling job handling this. know, quite people anticipated spike, definitely expect take long things reopened. looks like really now? Rookie numbers, looks trump handling corona, we'll mark records withing weeks😎 #USA #1
We might even hit 1 million deaths😃 Thats saying I'm saying knowing fact might give people relief perfictly healthy kids r dying. western states,like Texas, largely untouched CV ravaging NYC, NJ, hotspots. SD stay home numbers still low simply thought, decided , pretended (pick one) Covid skipped us. Gov rescinded stay home pre-covid style.

that 4 weeks ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

With less physical distancing + increase cases + exponential growth virus + hospital admissions lagging, predict see cities hit hard... Texas BOISE, Idaho — Hundreds thousands dollars coronavirus relief payments sent people behind bars across United States, IRS asking state officials help claw back cash federal tax agency says mistakenly sent.

The legislation authorizing payments pandemic doesn’t specifically exclude jail prison inmates, IRS refused say exactly legal authority retrieve money. website, points unrelated Social Security Act, bars incarcerated people receiving types old-age survivor insurance benefit payments.

“I can’t give legal basis. tell language Treasury using,” IRS spokesman Eric Smith said. “It’s list Social Security Act.”

Tax attorney Kelly Erb, who’s written issue website, says there’s legal basis asking checks back.

“I think it’s really disingenuous IRS,’’ Erb said Tuesday. ‘‘It’s rule IRS puts website. fact, IRS actually says stuff website isn’t legal authority. there’s actual rule — it’s guidance — guidance change time.”

After Congress passed $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue package March, checks $1,200 automatically sent cases people filed income tax returns 2018 2019, including incarcerated. couple weeks later, IRS directed state correction departments intercept payments prisoners return them.

***The IRS doesn’t yet numbers many payments went prisoners, Smith said. initial data states suggest numbers huge: Kansas Department Correction alone intercepted $200,000 checks early June. Idaho Montana combined seized $90,000.***

Washington state, meanwhile, intercepted $23,000 early June. states, like Nevada, refused release numbers, citing IRS request confidentiality.

While IRS says checks sent jail inmates also returned, sheer number jails detention centers across US makes difficult tell many following instructions.

The IRS seems decided pull back payments approved Congress, said Wanda Bertram, spokeswoman Prison Policy Initiative, think tank focusing harm mass incarceration. says prison officials accustomed intercepting tax documents screen potential scams, priming follow request.

“It appears IRS making up,” Bertram said.

Inmates families need money, said, especially prisons try reduce spread virus instituting lockdown conditions releasing thousands inmates trying get back feet.

Lockdowns increase expenses inmates often given lower-quality food fewer meals need supplement buying food prison commissaries. Family friends outside often cover costs, many lost jobs economic downturn, Bertram said.

“Loved ones right also squeeze pandemic job, send stimulus check someone, person prison one benefits that,” Bertram said.

Intercepting relief checks may also disproportionate impact Black Hispanic inmates, incarcerated higher rate white Americans. Black people imprisoned roughly twice rate Hispanic residents, five times rate whites last year, according US Department Justice’s Bureau Justice Statistics.

Prison officials nationwide trying intercept checks, varying results. Officials Vermont, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Arizona California estimated intercepted fewer dozen checks early June. Oregon prison officials seized 25 payments, 21 returned IRS four others given relatives joint tax filers.

Kaitlin Felsted, spokeswoman Utah prison system, said state intercepted 28 checks far noted relief money sent inmate’s home address wouldn’t touched prison officials.

Some states, like Alaska Wyoming, aren’t tracking number payments intercept.

It’s clear inmates recourse, said Erb, tax attorney.

Those released year’s end didn’t get relief check try claim missing money credit 2021 tax returns, it’s clear IRS honor claims, Erb said. inmates may luck.

I don’t get - try soooo hard little possible outside home must things delivered tip really big help people helping keep everyone else safe see shit like said family massive assholes taking vacations feels pointless. aren't, almost apartment buildings pools closed even ones open enough people make party. 

But entire street open bars?  Good people go extraordinary lengths protect children.

Then arrest them. resist, shoot them. US government literally print money though. Interesting. Thanks giving details. Unless they’re natives. [eloquently explained refusing protect others wearing mask loyalty test cult. wear mask, fail cult.

If wizen seriously we're going death toll millions done.  work IP field absolutely one trusts science publications China unless verified somewhere else. Since huge percentage people got unemployment CARES Act money making money working, that's believable poll.  


But there's shutdown again, really needs businesses require intimate contact people involves creation aerosols.  


Vape lounges close. Dentists close dire emergencies----like emergency extractions root canals. Broken teeth case case basis. Dentists concerned getting patients pain only. I'd say restaurants go back take only.  


Everything else fair game. Wal-Mart open sell clothes, every clothing store be, also. Basicallly, business sells goods, provides services Wal-Mart allowed stay open.  


Shut riskiest ones. That's it. Flattening curve best option doesnt allow suppression virus US Sweden r currently finding out.

Best strategy virus suppression, possible NPI TTI. better TTI works less need NPI. region hit quite hard absorbed return travellers ITA skiers Austria. Due Npi Tti hospitals werent even strained.

Might better. Add pair handcuffs sex toys, could good time. ...what? different Texas. brother's wife works hospital Harris county. run ICU beds, implement surge plan. convert non-ICU beds ICU beds. new patients go there. may also transfer non-COVID ICU patients hospitals.

If surge capacity reached ICU beds, reroute ambulances hospitals ICU beds.

The next action patient transfers non-COVID ICU patients hospitals, safely moved. 70-85% current ICU capacity taken non-COVID patients Harris County. yarmulke reference? boss(es) can't show they're actually necessary paycheck otherwise.  sure care made vague statement without rules way enforce it.

Great posturing though. They’re probably like “I got wear stupid mask day job. Thank God one force I’m clock” weird truth going ""back into"" lockdown. never truly locked way countries did. Way much optional enforced country.

From Kaiser Family Foundation: even box checked next ""Lockdown"" measure taken. one wants see people needlessly die, based anti science political agenda. 

Unfortunately, taking covid-19 precautions politicized sign weakness. so, people gladly follow directions self interest even survival, believing ""helps team win"". WTF? 

There's two teams alright, ""less 1%"" control red &amp; blue, ""rest us"" followers. Wake fuck stupid red -vs- blue smokescreen shit show!

How ever get here, could possibly worse manifestation sick broken culture? 

The US "" K-12 educational indoctrination"" fault, discouraging critical thinking encouraging obedience ""staying within box thinking"" indirect rewards. broken, obsolete indoctrination system may great producing obedient, non critical thinking, wage slave population industrial revolution assembly line production workers past, failed us greatly current situation. 

No person US stupid fucked enough deny basic science protocols required stop deadly virus.

Why many countries orders magnitude effectively controlling compared US? could anything basic education critical thinking skills related?

We country, really need bit self reflection, thought, effort put fixing shit.  Thanks modern medicine, warning labels increasing difficulty hiding bodies, stupid people living longer children, passing stupidity. 65% haven’t following guidelines bet. 100% serious comment, sucks going 4 places last 3 months worry shit going longer I’d go even say 65% would probably go even higher people taken care financially. 

There’s small subset people stubborn “I don’t want handout want work money!!” mindset. you’ll always people I'm internet stranger first comment thread, know fuck me. Like miracle Texas already 4231 still numbers from: Dallas (2nd populous county), Tarrant (3rd), Bexar (4th), Montgomery(11th), Williamson(12th). Today's numbers going blow current record (5018) water.

Edit: Williamson reported, new record +116 bring state +4347 We’re calling 125k major bank now? could cashed dreadful bright red masks. Every asshole red hat would bought 7.

I understand chance Trump make money got passed patriotic duty fighting domestic terrorism. Ppl like downvote anything least 65% Americans believe astrology degree, yeah, polls ...  I've heard guy Trump awful governor's could better too. good according Kemp. need months tell sure data keep seeing points far bigger contraction western / US consumption happened GFC. GFC banking crisis, entirely different sort crisis. banks mostly fine case, people can't spend.

And yes, China could ""keep growth up"", still got busted high growth never recovered previous highs. lot slack work exist anymore. ICU full 1% patients car accidents, would post r/caraccidents ICU full? Obviously isn’t 1% I’m pointing logic stops making sense apply scenario. economy! argument taken NPI order need surge capacity. surged ICU beds 20k 30k fortunately NPI effective anticipated max percent occupied covid patients.

No overworked hcws. transfers haste. leaving old ppl die nursing homes w/o oxygen. Hopefully not, see. got covid, meds, opening rising cases, got protests race wars riots.....oh my

Don't forget climate change failing economy! Also hell getting elective surgery pandemic?

I MRI showed tumor back Feb, lock down. Doc told might cancer, go remove check out. 

This classified elective. able get procedure done weeks ago, hospitals allowed sorts procedures.

In end, super lucky, cancer. spent months sweating balls cancer, going die, delightful stuff. me, worst spending months worrying. people, wont lucky. Either way, bet despite 'elective' nature ""lets find cancer"" surgery, lots people would really like wait.

That's one example put hold. long y’all add mask hand sanitizer list whatever want  Never said wanted either, saying money fiat currency literally grows trees. Trust sweetheart, I’d prefer current situation trying resume life safe incredibly fucking stupid anyone trying justify dumb Literally fucking problem. thinking right here. clue medical/ hospital system work privatized healthcare system. Please. Go right ahead. Make 300 beds week find space. someone know anyone get COVID lay new bed hope anyone available care them. bed fucking useless without staff. Build 100 jet fighters day think great air force 50 pilots. Fucking dumb. People need get thier heads ass, think god damn second spewing stupid bullshit like this. Ah didnt think that. Thanks insight. totally feel this. kid was, 45 mins ago, asking school going start (in AZ). honest answer 'I idea'. 

But guess (and do, need plan) looking like 'no'. cut little slack parents, best have. 

Mine old enough understand, less, what's happening even long haul. 
Was America always stupid? noticing? went back Monday work forced it. Every software engineer, know STL area, told probably working home early 2021. company decided bring everyone back enforce everyone wear masks... open office layout... title really phrased,"" 65% Americans actually think others themselves."" Yep. fucked little kids one seems give shit. It’d funny wasn’t sad They're going replace 13 concrete functioning assets, replace ""thousands"" ideas.

NY, Michigan, Canada sending aid southern states within months. welfare queens know compassionate states countries let suffer degree willing set for. week, cases Wisconsin going down, opening really hurt state? see restart MLB unless quarantine players families prevent spread season starts month. Board Shame solution.....  Let Pubtards fun though. completely wrong.

Based best evidence currently have, cases 80% (4,000 people example) mild cases. Ranging little symptoms ""cold flu like"" goes away couple weeks.

15%, (750 people) serious symptoms lasting 2-3+ weeks suffer possible long term effects. people recover need hospital care.

5% (250 people) serious complications require hospital/ medical attention. lasting complications known, even required lung transplants survive.

Of hospitalized surprisingly high number die. Infection Fatality rate anywhere .05 - 1.5% meaning 25-75 original 5,000 die every day. none happen.

BTW, 20% dead 60 under. old people.

You twat, least honest saying.. Yet must take lot mental energy hate someone much.  Chinese ""freedumbs"" It’s weed, everyone smoke up, quarantining lot fun Bruh  Same. Yeh I'm going do. cba government baby footing all. know gets tested care home worker such. frustrating would believe many people crowd newsfeed facebook saying crook, liar, needs retire, paid off, corrupt, etc. says want hear enemy. know reason well would like keep comment here. Honestly wish could like that. wife home max chill mode. -- three day weekend run stuff start losing mind.

I'm honestly grateful sent home quarantine. (My job much essential cannot done remotely) US also ~1.8x population. It’s also important consider level testing done. ""Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. And, weak men create hard times.""

Unfortunately seem last stage cycle. fair, China locked Beijing soon found community transmission. 

The US lock Mega-city hits 97% hospital bed capacity. problem idea even stay home, they'll still visited people bringing supplies, going health care. There's way protect anyone 100%. Without vast majority people locking along them, might well let everyone out. even then, lock without following testing, contact tracing, quarantines confirmed cases, delaying inevitable next wave. ding dong loves hearing voice. Hard core DJT supporter always looking attention. Remember flattening curve meant acknowledging disease would spread? Pepperidge farm remembers. honestly think something flagrantly unnecessary going fucking theme park time like morally reprehensible  wear mask anytime go out. thing I've argued cloth masks inferior surgical n95. 

But know actually interested real conversation. I’m torn. one hand, don’t want homeless wipe little savings left, hand don’t want get sick. 

The numbers Illinois justify going another lockdown. It’s almost lowest we’ve ever stayed locked additional 6 weeks careless states re-opened. NY. states struggling want go lockdown that’s fine I’d rather seal state time being. Oh you’re amateur constitutionalist too? It’s truly growing field! Considering lot didn’t wear masks, deeming hoax. leader doesn’t take disease seriously, would they? Mate, net trend downward **including** said upward trend. Odd cannot seem see that. far asshole gotta make sense, though? really. 

The 2k/month 4 months max (based current information) money get tax exempt. basically pay back next year. essentially interest free loan government. supposed giving us time get set alternative avenues keeping virus check (I.e. testing, contact tracing, PPE, better social distancing plans). There’s way look spikes anything except massive policy failure. masks, like everything else involving science, made political issue suppose silver lining politicians easily disregard human lives safety exposed voted office spectacular margins sing songs several thousand years. That’s crazy.

Feels like carry papers showing vaccine travel first world.

Canada, please come take us northerners over. Societal collapse real possibility. 20 million unemployed. think states reopening even cases spiking? don't, economy tank, we'll enter deep depression, food supplies start disrupted. covid seasonal, experts believe is, subsequent waves worse, again, experts believe could case, number unemployed rise unmanageable levels revenue employed longer sustain them. complete collapse US economy possibly global economy. everyone country takes seriously avoid outcome. seeing president throwing rallies thousands unmasked people telling everyone test *less*, seems highly probable very, bad outcome next couple years. hope damage supporters mitigated person replaces next year. may late. didn’t really give us justification, said going back state reopens. like company remember went home first time (when covid started) boss stated media plot get rid trump pretty much answers question lol I'd give medal I'm cheap fuck That’s fine. Parents vote pocket books seek alternative care providers.  Covid wasn’t thing right I’d definitely hit up. blind seen coming. Absolutely. Hit grocery stores right before, Iowans. Stock 2 weeks hunker down. problem government telling us nessisary then. stop pesky testing. virus go away ignore hard enough. want herd immunity walk cuarantine ward listen music patients? Yes do, yet legislators head sand ass jackets want impeach Wolf. ya well work 35% can't lockdown. Also can't blame lot people need work end homeless. much choice zero government support. don’t think it’ll create cashless society. One already coming future, pandemic helping speeding 80% can't bothered wear mask? go! amount people seen debate cannot possibly reason spread virus people wore masks social distanced tells many cases, especially North America. 

Like mass outdoor gatherings caused huge issues contact traced certain events. Organizers protests coming positive still people feel reason. cannot fully support organization - fully support cause absolute - completely ignores science creates bias media articles informing greater public. 

Look - cause spike. Period. cases would come protest occur. fact. cannot argue 10,000 people one area spread virus. certain parts society care destruction cause pandemic bad public relations looks like best pretend protests exempt viral infections. also go leap nearest bridge experience flying ""on terms"". logic.  tests good, need shittier tests don’t show positive much. Theyve conditioned reject anything actually intelligent, place faux ""red pill street smarts"" bullshit. gotta learn slam language. Yeah President one making thousands people protest riot streets spreading virus again. never seen apt description. mask requirements Canada. free yet

Oh boy, news you.

Are sitting down? Northern. San Francisco took extreme (correct) measures. I'd seen numbers trending poorly, NC's Governor Health officer making sound like understood problem. hopeful would handle well, far looks like trying best take care people.

Good News, IMO really hope finally ends, selfish people every country made worse mourn died. disgraceful. Worldometer 35k atleast 4k Cali Texas add. It'll get today. signals base it’s safe

It's wearing mask, refusing ever wear one even freaking swab factory scrapped days worth work wear one. He's trying stick man, except ""the man"" voters. ""premeditated negligence"". doesn’t work. FTFY Oh, still concerned taking recommended precautions. go work come back home. Financial anxiety eclipsed anxiety getting sick. unless support people financially. 

I’m trying reappear wasteland. Talking beds means staff overloaded tomorrow. subject statue pulling amidst coronavirus, assuming money also changed soon? Even seeing economically rather go strict early economy recover faster little impact second wave. dont get politicians. mask symbol disease far over. want things get back normal, maybe got laid run small business. government better job cash relief actually went citizens, there’d fewer inconsiderate people protesting masks sheltering place. think China's total numbers 80,000 cases population billion, Qatar cases China (90,000) population 2.5 million, I've got bridge moon sell you. Heck im set coming all! Correct. means system
Is flawed. age facetime conversations arent stimulating enough, esp 2 year old. need playing running together....what kids supposed do. hardest working person respond all. Parenthood tough, would know, got own.  probably also play role, evidence humid environments help reduce transmission influenza virus, theory infectious droplets hit water particles air travel far. think verified Covid seems plausible.

Though humidity may inhibit viral decay surfaces, right? happening many areas, areas, transferring patients less real option. Texas one places. state huge, transferring patients mean long transit times, large costs, dangerous consequences high-risk patients.

Any state west Mississippi going face problem. Geographically population centers get much farther apart, consideration put much strain local resources. Seeing military trucks carrying away corpses Bergamo shit got real West Pretty soon they’ll great job containing numbers. employer open whole time ive sitting ass collecting unemployment, could gone work everyday. 

Unemployment gotten mad investigated claim like 4x idk still works  lockdown killed 0 person far.  

How could possibly know that? 
   amazing persons mocks scientifics ""little flu"" 

Where mention anything ""little imaginary disasters arguments.

You obviously one category 3 group. imaginary disasters.

Since alternative letting hospitals get overwhelmed burying millions Americans, wonder 35% thought things going work out. never said will. wouldn’t rule out. thing takes year two... knows. Also talking worldwide. That’s bad specified that. Like 180,000 adding 300,000? seems kinda likely considering populated states 5 times daily infections two months ago. Waiting patiently ... shitshow happen. like rewarding hostage taker executing hostages. Shasta McNasty nothing mask looked We've experienced hottest day year England, it'll interesting see two weeks time whether cases fall/jump. sub bans politics. Yet America coronavirus political issue. countries sides want stop use science so. states one side not, can't say much rule banning politics, sub one important political issues America. Exposure time part equation. hairdresser’s chair 45 minutes lower risk 8 hours office. stay home nothing worry about. It’s financials. able keep job work home. I’ve basically stayed home four months. Every Saturday go grocery shopping week that’s it. thing go beach house boogie board hours work couple days week. 

I handle quarantine I’m great situation. year ago unemployed living NYC. wasn’t current situation I’d super stressed out. 

As annoyed get people staying home, understand people aren’t privileged situations like am. 

But regardless financial living situations. absolutely fucking excuse wear masks go out. problem lot BS masks hardly make difference. stuff people wear help least little. you’re wearing mask smell environment around you, mask isn’t working great. 

So it’s another failure America can’t get everyone quality n95 masks actually work. It’s crisis effected people higher earning jobs much.

There generation people waiting enter housing market. Probably southern Africa &amp; Australia, too. *weird* poorly people handling this. work retail. Barely anyone today wearing mask. I’ve multiple people laugh wearing one. I’m fielding lot complaints items stock. fact we’re experiencing pandemic isn’t sufficient explanation them. Long-time friends mine hardcore supporters lockdown reversed decision can’t “live fear” virus isn’t deadly age group. 

It’s bananas absolute entitlement general obliviousness people feel. black white? shades gray. Hopefully, never leave first wave, ever worry second wave. 🤔 temple* mean safe open beaches outdoor recreation areas? Let's say outmaneuver police use gun kill escape killed incompetent policeman using knee neck punish US. still fucked prison life. honestly know would worst. heart breaking stories are, they’re ones feel need seen *especially* “pandemic over, flu!!!” crowd. couldn’t even imagine family ripped apart like this. Luckily part loved ones taking seriously live separate houses, man...the thought losing brother sister aunt grandma let alone multiple family members depressing think about. 

This entire dude’s life turned upside matter weeks never ever way. I'm parent excellent freaking news.  No. didn’t say maybe person depression inflammation brain. took granted depression about. like GP sees patient fatigue brain fog certain it’s depression, even though isn’t even trained psychiatrist psychotherapist. said, sometimes symptoms overlap, perhaps shouldn’t conflate everything. lol claims he's scientist. How's baffling?

In time every action police microscope going posted social media, either:

- Focus crimes like Breaking entering, robberies, etc
- Harass random citizens street wearing masks

You're one asking mask mandates enforced - one realistically enforce them. Governments mandate anything want, one that's going enforce something citizens want do.

You *try* enforce it. USA, gets people's heads blown Dollar stores attacked psychopaths transit. stop enforcing it, employees danger.

Like said, relying police (who constantly assaulted right now) enforcement - time protests, huge unemployment, media scrutiny, maybe going to. I’m miserable messenger. onlys justs candy nuts every day would uberdonkfest I’m miserable messenger. stupid comment.

Grow up. hope summer approaching, warm temperature somehow would effect virus. Apparently warm cold makes little different. seems summer people make actually make things worse.

I hope find hobbies enjoy get caught much news. lockdown try join online meetings, take online course, learn new skill, play social video game, go ride car park somewhere quiet try go walk jog. need someone talk DM chat. die Covid, pretty much holed bubble end. won’t allowed visitors. people see healthcare workers swathed protective gear. heard ventilator uncomfortable. One weird thing noticed: China's official count roughly 80,000 cases 3000 deaths. Obviously may accurate, that's stand. LA County currently 80,000 cases 3000 deaths (roughly) well. LA County pretty good testing, think there's evidence they're fudging numbers.

Could coincidence. Could also mean China's count actually fairly accurate. case, weird think panicking China hit numbers, home county alone surpass that. according logic stop checking documents we'll less undocumented immigrants. New Zealand offer bubble area fee. Charge like $1M per athlete arrive island, make quarantine 14 days army supervision. Th leagues would pay it.  *laughs freight associate* Thank you! Luckily, gf family medical field keep sane haha. understand need large wedding PANDEMIC. push year? wedding.. Granted, chances everything fine one contract think dramatic paranoid, risk it? get it.  never trusted get go. knew CDC, WHO, Trump, Surgeon General etc full crap kept pushing buy masks narrative.

LOL. people dumb alive. Hell don’t even know bands biting tongue get pulled replace another pathetic ""Yes Man"" think understand big Texas big US states are. Suggesting drive patients from, say, Houston El Paso like suggesting drive patients Amsterdam Madrid. feasible; people die way. see here's going help financially- going pass 3 trillion dollar stimulus package. That's big ass number we'll keep talking about. That's 10 grand American. 

Of course American get that. They'll get fraction give big banks corporations buy back stock order trickle down. Wear damn mask. Social Distance. Get tested. We'll likely see death toll spike hit July tbh. kinda similar happened March cases started increasing death tolls go sky high April. said I'm hoping bad peak April days still want option to. Oh frack... 65% middle aged white suburban moms? Except many get completely asymptomatic mild symptoms people still refuse wear mask “own libz.” “Coming back”? leave first place? family hates now. Stop buying fear mongering media. first idiot claiming masks ""killing people"" ranting ""citizen's arrests""? level stupid great concern. children, need put foster homes suffering irreversible psychological damage exposed crazy lady.  words, doomed there's chance ventilator.  even remotely close herd immunity. Herd immunity close 90% thing. think exactly? Pretty pathetic. idiots looked upon everyone I'm genuinely scared X DOUBT deaths causes, pneumonia, natural causes, etc nicely graphed compared years. takes seconds load script directly uses CDC data. Overall deaths pretty high weekly basis Florida. natural causes think diabetes. think overall deaths best metric govt data preventable. U.K 1 20,000 chance dying car crash year. younger 50 1 10,000 chance dying *if* get infected. According [this study [this One may also call dog Whistling piece shit. Lung Scar State tables turned  Yes it’s enforced well could be. countries surprise visits make sure person home they’re supposed be. Canada this. True felt sweat start accumulate upper lip moderate intensity activity wearing mask? mean sure seeing guy try put intestines back abdomen bad, going argue point. self-esteem people see sweat bleed mask? ever get back? Sarcasm way... knew signed for!!! That's fair. still think even kids wash hands face, fact close contact children means family risking infection family. sounds like kids' families getting tested they're completely ignoring virus, good sign. Ultimately, comfortable with, home! new work age person add country depresses wages industry newly added person works drives cost living.

This true, effect pretty small. cited study showed every 10% increase population due immigration, wages suppressed 4%. 10% US population 33 million people. near tell, legal immigration around 1 million per year, 1 million temporary foreign workers top that. means takes 15 years bring enough foreigners cause 4% wage decrease, less .3% per year. 

Over 15 year period economy grow least 3% per year, suppressing effect wages totally swamped growth. get growth without immigration, tech sector particular, probably get growth without it. half startups least one immigrant founder. startups major engines job creation, want get 40 million citizens back work, bringing world's best brightest start companies hire smart thing do.

Once current mess past, smarter countries EU, Canada, Australia happy take highly skilled immigrants (and government) interested in. drag economy generation, means, keep sending way. San Antonio, Dallad, Fort Worth Austin too. CA man, one taking shit seriously, despite strict governor's orders. we'd comparatively well based cases per population. What's fucking insane couldnt collectively decide shut 1 month, everyone stayed home beyond incubation period, would done april. Considering they're going running rides full capacity, extra time wipe ride vehicles, I'm sure lines short people think. told Americans allowed shoot feet, would scream “MUH FREEDOMS!!!” proceed shoot themself foot spite you. Wait what? change Munich, Paris, Geneva flight USA Italy? WTF? shotgun Local government tried, really did. Abbott allow it. bottom, 200 million dead, countless long term lingering symptoms. bottom. gone thousands, probably millions depending allocated, me. showing weird effects then, chances good I'll fine. Yep, they're kidnapping people putting ICU. cracked code. Simply amazing. Given information time guidance given correct appropriate. applying know decisions made information available calling ""political"" asinine. Shot hole country Texas mess. never took proper precautions first place. They’ve numerous warnings seen happened New York. Shame whole state ALWAYS backwards regressive.  @99.5% survival rate still around 1MM deaths beginning end pandemic 60% US population gets infected. Travel don’t stupid Hey, Governor slouch right now. I've thoroughly impressed Romano's handling crisis. figures correct, confirmed cases one day america since start pandemic.

edit: not. 3rd apples apples. invited cousin Covid? supposed play president SyFy movie, campaign advised it. told Egypt... pretty sure told Americans someone would want give us police escort. idea independent tour guide full shit though.  think Russia helped win?

NB: whilst discussion potential working controversial, plain fact. Russia US's friend, see win. Riiiight.. COVID.. that’s reason.. What? point discussion *masks* enforcing use.

Nobody mentioned shutdowns here. brazilian states higher temperatures winter american states summer time they're close Ecuador change much single payer + greed + corruption = perfect environment pandemic thrive. we're fucked basket Brazil Russia. That's become America. tragedy. Who’s favorite character? say Ron probably mine, although love April, too! Looking people? Texas elections probably close  Literally days testified come Fauci Trump spoken weeks. course Fauci told slow testing told anything all.  first time Trump bypassed people administration suits him. would think, followers think virus over. Racist people, especially Latinos Asians accepting exempt orders.  link shows deaths day day? initial response better America, realized real happening, way better shit show south.

Definitely perfect bad actors fold (Jason Kenney cutting health care budgets right things peaking come mind, long term care home situation pretty much across country), financial support like CERB responses based mainly science health professionals much better bullshit going states. China's fault? first country get hit warming. impossible contained within borders. able contain even though warning. easy point fingers, know truth. absolutely screwed pooch this. Haha SPOKEN got tldr worry here? Dam breach leading mass flooding/rescues? use dexa Physical Therapy clinics reduce swelling. one could say... pretty bad great periods recent US history. 1950s, 1980s, even 1990s. Great economies, little war, lots industrial scientific advancement. Obviously apply wealth levels, races, genders though US problems. really started unravel 9/11.  talking about?

I see warnings everything getting worse Trump pretending everything fine stop testing. I’m seeing downvote brigade person called Fauci lying, admitted to.

That *significant* lie deserves every bit scorn receives. I’m confused response disconnected I’m seeing sub thread particularly.  think different measures apply different circumstances given density come back certainly expect understand that. Well, don’t know you’ve heard. currently pandemic. lot states massive spikes cases. Well -are- fool all.

They cancel surgery need immediately bleeding death...but mean people wont suffering peoples stupidity. 

Case point; coworker mine damn near bedridden due desperately needing scoliosis treated, cancelled previously, shes damn scared go right people supposed do. Honestly, handled virus NY want run president. He's fucked legalization time time again, handled pretty well opinion.  
All four states go stage one lockdowns, case CA overweight? theres mask law you’ll upset you’ll eventually comply? Sorry late response. completely understand mean. feeling similar way comes US. Like get wrong, we've completely fucked things up, leadership trash, apparently scary-high proportion population either completely inept lack empathy. many factors play feel like people outside US understand. I'm getting really sick Europeans shitting US stupid lot what's going due corruption, inequality, lack social support.

For example, blame many Americans wanting ""open back up"" several things. 1 - Many people lost jobs, state like mine, getting unemployment shit show. even state competent leaders, states limited budgets eventually borrow federal government. Which, noticed, federal government awful. leads 2 - states like mine prematurely open pay unemployment. bartender bars open back up, difficult time making case need unemployment money could technically employed. 3 - Many people get health insurance job, lose job may lose health insurance. may eligible medicaid, gov health insurance low-income people, that's whole goddamn process eligibility requirements vary state. may able get Medicaid timely manner all. without health insurance without income pay private insurance. pandemic. 4 - places opened back meeting guidelines, either due lack resources they're willing so. go back work, refuse certain unsafe tasks work certain unsafe conditions, get fired. get fired, typically cannot get unemployment. quit instead, typically cannot get unemployment. finally, 5 - many places still close due either lack customers due employees getting COVID. one hand increased pressure close places since clearly safe, hand, due points 1-4, many employees desperate customers patron business. fifty shades fucked up, really. makes angry US government (and Florida government, too), also angry everyone patronizingly talking shit stupid Americans are. Like yeah, lot are, lot stuck impossible situation. personally quarantined since beginning March stopping. understand desperation. 

I agree Nordic countries letting Swedes allowing citizens travel Greece. seems illogical. also think great point spikes cyclical. First China, started hearing Iran Italy, parts Europe, started getting hammered parts Latin America starting follow. knows happen future. US shows signs stopping, genuinely happy see successes, even temporary, many Asian European countries.

I sorry hear care homes. Florida, large elderly population southern part state yet governor mostly thrown caution wind. reports throughout pandemic Florida government intentionally contorting concealing data, doubt care homes getting hit harder may know. Even county, population young, many deaths developmental care centers people disabilities *and* staff ignored. :( commend ya'll transparent that, though. Like said, KNOW hiding shit, knew UK wanting count died outside hospitals. 

I think UK US, course mostly US, bit ego problem. long history thinking they're gods world. seems like Europe take things seriously quickly should've, looks like UK worst European offender. Even so, boss UK since last August SOOOO grateful instead US. comes back two weeks, though, absolutely dreading it.

Anyway, sorry spiel. hope ya'll alright there. Never Sweden looks like beautiful place live. Yeah that's completely unnacceptable. places can't even bare minimum. Apparently yes Hey, Asshole - speaking us though giant collective here. didn’t vote Abbott Texas. us “ignorant” “proud”. get fucking high horse! NY already killed elderly surge back? East coast mf! went month ago. Masks, one person time, waiting outside we’re strictly enforced felt ok. going buzz home family friends went salons didn’t want stick stubbly head. bandanas like effective? one he's wearing seems tight well fitting, seems like average Joes street wearing bandanas, super loose flopping around. Seems like PSA would effective real mask. it’s easily managed virus days punishment line punishments Stis Stds, despite longer worse them.

You HIV entire life never get AIDs thanks modern medicine. Almost one dies anymore, it’s longer 90s dude. source?

Paying attention math class teacher talking exponentiation. state allowing indoor shows? can't help can't read table. table breaks country. Every country USSR suffered 7% population dead. China 10-20 million dead (3%).

Yes, ~5 years. Look rising numbers answer question.

Spoiler: answer yes.  Pretending there's ""second wave"" graph fucking ludicrous, too. first spike NYC we're second spike first wave. wave things kinda go ""catastrophe"" ""slightly-less catastrophe"". #To someone hell-bent destroying people fabric nation, welcome news bad week. I’m West Richland. anyone speculating Richland/West Richland much lower? Don’t forget put bleach water countries like Spain Italy, start prioritising sick, universal health care govt provided priority lists hospitals make decision.
How dealt private hospital caters paying customers? salute General Mattis, thank him, Arnold Schwarzenegger others gone way point POLITICAL topic. Masks proven cut spread - save lives, prevent spread, proxy help economy. Everyone wearing one. going ""rely self-reporting assessments students"" Remember wanted put even troops ground Syria claimed Kurds would genocided get way one genocided step closer getting middle east. Lol. resigned Trump took toys away let keep bombing brown people got paid millions write mean book? kids fucked heroes. Totally agree. moment Cuomo state needed. can't change past actions today save lot lives. 

And allow hook future either. It’s specific activity, it’s amount international travel logistics involved organizing race 50,000 elite runners one densely populated cities world, probable dealing second wave flu season November. think 50,000 people cross finish line Manhattan evaporate? Doh. There’s way fix there? sure wish knew read could reply said, oh well. entire Houston medical center 90% Scarring lung tissue go away. Marines actually look White House? get that's people told, use common sense. yall really think entire countries states going take hundreds thousands deaths make idiot look bad? Parking lots hospitals pandemic patients full dont want bunch people getting sick too. Also people sick stuff would normally go hospital afraid catching virus.  might lack public health efforts Texas Governor allowed state pretty much fully open? look nations response Sars years ago would know do. world rich country would even shortage first place? can't interpret mean lot people would die lots different respratory diseases year getting one virulent spreads fast?

How know number people die respiratory ailment demographics Sweden? Unless break statistical significance relation cohorts claim meaningless.

A better comparison would compare Sweden Scandinavian neighbors see poorly they're faring.  We're kinda already one. domains war expanded upon. There's truly huge information war going moment, polluting information channels trying influence citizens access. Russia suspicious things around undersea cables years, US bought Brazil's 5G network keep Chinese influence many nations attempting stop Chinese hardware installed via law. Maybe OP state mandated? MA, 11 employees, offer paid sick time employees. accrues one hour earned every 30 hours worked, caps 40 hours. say, 17 years working, first job offer sick/vacation time even full time employees.

I agree though, saying everyone gets paid sick time little touch. Even MA, small businesses 10 employees likely offering paid sick time. long, uncomfortable tri-stare #OMG SHUT EVERYTHING world ducked place. Gift life longer thing. selfish cruel world justice shit keeps hitting fan, stop kids.

Life curse place shows daily testing? Yea, time unsub place.  Age number baby  wish could afford pack move back Cali (from Oakland). Rt.live seems great source transmissibility virus state state basis. Anyone got similar statistic US nationaly? That's terribly high bar clear.  I’m happy live place governors turn science, politics types things. How? done enabled Trump?

For certain, Trump done horrible things, see Fauci enabler all. hit NY levels still want open Disney?!!? support message right protest. think kidding think people saying large groups okay protest, sub news. 

NYC made right call here.  Yep, true, news cycle ensured people bored it, news channels ""shock awe"" were, people believe since they're hearing less it, less big deal. vicious cycle (in ways one) end badly. hope treatment improved enough, virus mutated enough make difference. 31st day need two ponds hold lily pads, 35th need 32 ponds 40th need 1024 ponds basically need warehouse hold lily pads. US point much company store masquerading a

In London, felt like vibe was, ""if fuck everyone else, cunt"", vast majority complying - mostly government slow. sad, biggest flaw healthcare system. People seem forget lot Americans insurance scared bills go get tested Covid. true number cases bound higher. Also increased pneomonia deaths...
I'd love move somewhere else think we'd ever funds. Hopefully get new administration January healthcare improvements. half population CA get £95.85 per week Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) you’re ill work. It’s paid employer 28 weeks

I get 6 months full pay 6 moths 1/2 pay. ssp rate mandatorily employers pay eligible employees Clearly world decided arbitrary cutoff line deaths fall beneath line care goes line draconian measures justified.  Yesterday's 7 day moving average higher day it... many deplorable people clinging guns bibles one unite us all, right? That’s.. really sad honest. norm. aren’t politicians need, they’re politicians have. 5000 wish could leave stupid country. people dumb hurts. graph maximum surge capacity clearly marked? matter us individuals it, fact overwhelming amount US citizens not. country elected Trump. No, average citizen cannot go without hand holding. hand held ballet box. trump anymore qualified talk politics. anyway force people enjoy freedumb restaurants? wonder Boston go ahead. Dodo deucy think they’ll start testing way less. That’s suspicion. 

RemindMe! 10 days We're fail flattening curve. Wave 1 never ended. We're soon fail preventing hospitals overrun too. Houston nearly limit. going expand graph now, currently goes yup Daily deaths nationwide 90% peak, still trending even cases go up. That's one talks deaths anymore. personally pissed he's handling this. first ""Let counties take care it"" supporters got panties twist stay home order mask mandate Harris county Texas counties, mask mandate ""unlawful counties enforce"".

He wanted cake eat too. Looks like he's gonna eating front thousands sick Texas residents. ever said that... turn comment something lol. That's thing, really can't. mean, Hawaii easy: Look dude that's wearing Aloha shirt, Lei, Camera around neck, land-lobster sunburn: That's someone arrived. 

Every state, knows... could King Karen's Klub  lot people see wearing masks older. dad ED doc. He’s conservative. terrified virus. don’t talk politics, don’t know thinking now, know he’s strong believer masks staying home. People turning political thing ones causing problems. Lol. health professionals taking amazing precautions, ESPECIALLY hospitals. Northern NJ. boyfriend spent past week hospital due sepsis, good job making sure ample separation different care facilities individuals tested placed rooms. imagine hospitals following example. Please health care emergency afraid go ER. same, dont care. ill getting mine agree also OP. Im nj, relocated Minnesota. nice see unity north east states. Midwest much varied, damn national leadership needed, cases us vary much one idiots claiming otherwise? wrong. Yikes. still product systemic racism communities poverty tied poorer health. ""No guys, totally thing Trump bragged did"" 95 per week might well zero, that's laughably low 

People get much never disappointed Texan life. amount people think large conspiracy theory, walk around absolute disregard everyone’s health well appalling. People literally still stuck phase one denial. keep parroting “it’s worse flu”. Karens boomers swear know doctors dedicated 10+ years medicine. God save lone star state France economy thing CNBC segment world economics yesterday gonna go digging google try find evidence didn’t make sure u find it. think EU isn’t gonna it’s debt crisis worse 2012 foolish. us economy recovering nothing virus spike south considering places staying open. weren’t effected first time around it’s logical would see increase it’s 10 fold streamlined testing didn’t exist ny Italy China epicenter virus. estimates U.S around 5% infected country. won’t pretty, think handful states hit herd immunity end summer.

Areas opened quick saw business activity falter.

Areas waited sustained recoveries.

It ""freedom vs. Lockdown"" ""what works vs "" scientist, disagree quote, us working things actually know nothing about, hence feel like know nothing lol. trying diplomatic Remember italy like 30k cases whole world going crazy basically shut country. 

It's damn virus, thing that's changed spread worsened... yet somehow taking less precautions. astonishing stupid humans be. Look korea,taiwan... like answers test still failing. Youre right problem there's people know sick. opens opportunity spread someone actually feel sick. Trump also kneels visits Putin private. Large gatherings large gatherings think virus gives shit political agendas think person scam artist projecting whole problem world fools fanatics always certain themselves, wiser people full doubts.

Bertrand Russell That’s awful part; I’m cynical fuck I’m still constantly surprised things handled think skipped salient point poster said. 

You mentioned freedom smoke even though kills completely agree that. said, free smoke stores, restaurants, etc, choice smoke impacting (your freedom swing fist ends face). 

So, treat way? wear mask anywhere except public around people. Hell, let's take step make completely comparable. must wear mask anywhere allowed smoke. Would supportive that? Wow, fuck? opposite claim it’s serves racist, backward instruction. protect (mostly) others spreading virus, please wear masks. advisory, anyone traveling states ""significant community spread"" COVID-19 New York, New Jersey Connecticut must quarantine 14 decision comes states, particularly Florida, experience surge new COVID-19 cases. Tuesday, Florida Department health reported 3,000 new cases, bringing state's total 103,503.  ridiculous thing NYPD wearing masks. congregate near Brooklyn Bridge every evening I'd say \~80% still wearing masks. video police union official ranting couple weeks back legit first time seen/noticed NYPD officers wearing masks. usual think rules apply don't. Mad Dog 2020!!! 

Oh wait, maybe best marketing connection make. New Yorker, agree ""Personal freedoms"" ideology, ex post facto rationalization placing economic activity human pursuits. Looked it, $120 one live. way I’m paying Active cases Berlin doubled last week, taking R 1,8. stil opening ca 800 cases. one plant. people way relaxed. Source live there. You’re ahead long! De Santis promised ain’t going back better prepared fight last man.  Man people downvoted stating something article discussed. sub seriously full lunatics I’m terrified future holds US. 

People dumb, god damn beyond thought capable dumb completely honest. 

I’ve quarantined months now, going work, going necessities. go across state lines visit mother law got surgery, deemed essential visit, couldn’t things relied us help her. 

It’s really weird stay inside extended amount time, long job doesn’t mind working 70% time home, don’t care. plenty keep occupied within home! thinking K-12 education, certainly college taking view well recently. Yep, data analysis growing trend infection disease killed 100,000 people 3 months country alone cause fear. states considered high rates infection? happy living Connecticut right now. you’re going wear one people step around you, DON’T cough them? fair point. Although giving sounds pretty absurd since quite literally free money. agree thought going unemployment system get people money really poor avenue choose. way Canada handled (easy apply separate system) much better. theory, yes would right thing do. However it’s always going money politics. country develops take care country first decide distribute rest regards political economic considerations  go sourcing.. mostly update totals day. Florida data used broken report 100 pages. week switched 4 pages reason. sediments exactly. hospitals areas nowhere near tri-state area. going get ugly possible things could explode SoCal soon. One thing note positive rate CA risen cases did. We're still sitting around 6%. AZ hit 33% recently. Anyone claims Covid deaths ""pneumonia"" thrown jail. Anyone messing numbers anyway criminal. Gotta keep roads clear protests.  MN incredibly easy apply. Think took 20 minutes maybe 5 minutes every week request payment. YMMV course state seems good program set up! equivalent fumbling ball 20 yard 1yard line week definitely next week CA first 10k cases day. “Well Governor said it’s okay go back normal.” - frequent sentiment Georgia (U.S.) Well masks work...if goal protect getting sick. think realized extent asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, people mild symptoms might realize sick, spreading virus. People wearing masks thinking they'd protect often leads slacking things like hand hygiene social distancing much confident actually protected person thing. mantra ""masks sick people,"" problem anyone sick contagious without knowing it. this, masks actually protect breathing absorbing 5G. That’s right NWO, truth here, don’t tread me. arguments he's making lead holding position. got position he's making arguments justify position. new information useless him. be, even people follow order better nothing. Florida average older NY.

There's chance 2 3 weeks look ugly.

Hoping lessons learned NY treatments help keep numbers down. We've come long way since March; hospitals least much better information options NY did. Thanks CCP ... nice gift Agreed. aware think would good mentally. I’m fine getting test isolating afterwards. It’s also relatively small dive bar half capacity it’s like I’m Madison square garden every time get flu shot spend next day burning feeling bit off. side effects worth potential protection IMO. NY rates, driven NYC, behaved like curve intervention: sharp rise, sharp fall. flattening significant difference caused human intervention. posted response another comment bears repeating: people hospitalized early May NYC people stayed home. contagious virus went around months dense area. That’s anti-science. Claiming NYC dense NE cities somehow made virus disappear rest country makes you’re saying we’re doomed there’s nothing it? think forgot turn sarcasm filter. course moving. That’s it’s job. haven’t curbed all. either or?

Can’t mass protests rallies assholes packing indoor bars/restaurants dipshit ideas It’s way complicated that. it’s wrong antibodies, could facilitate viruses entering cell. testing important. Michigan well dont like social interaction want everyone validate shitty lifestyle. Seriously number people say “as introvert happy pandemic “ batshit insane People without pre-existing conditions died lol people recovered organ damage, blood clots reduced lung capacity. Seattle, case. People masked up, stayed far apart possible circumstance. bunch testing, real spike King Snohomish Counties. 

Washington’s big spike coming Yakima County, 100 miles Seattle metro area. Virginia Mason hospital Yakima absolute capacity - cannot add beds anything. 

Perhaps protests cities different results data concretely know suggests major factor. Yeah July extra unemployment benefits run out. causes damage masks using heat lowest effective temperatures. one panicking don’t spread false information. Yup. Great announcement make can't actually enforce this. It’s pretty much small city. 4 theme parks. 25 hotels. Shopping center. associated infrastructure transportation. Open 365 days years form staffing 24 hours day. ahead hang friends.

#No, that. according poll Expect number keep climbing least couple weeks. believe one reasons wanted open state try minimize paying unemployment. criminal doing. unemployment look job get offer, required take job lose unemployment benefits. small window allowed people forgo job search, think expires soon already has. course reason one many. Texas starting throwing adult patients [children hospitals. I'm surprised number deaths. think number total infected vastly what's reported. 

The way played tho kinda believe there's nothing could've done anyway done pointless. far WH concerned virus gone. states falling line. numbers climbing, hospitals filling again. States still reopening wondering numbers rising. 🙄 dump followers running around wearimg masks. understand you’re coming from. issue PPE meant intended purpose.

For instance, you’re working chemicals react violently, need wear safety goggles seal around eyes. nose safety glasses definitely protect wearing nothing. don’t protect chemical splashes. intended use design. It’s thing cloth masks 99% population wears public. masks give extra protection, designed protect catching COVID. 

I safety background. safety procedures ppe protect COVID, you’re things using things, sure need wear mask you’re risk spread disease. two people working sterile room one person covid person doesn’t one mask, it’s better sick person unless it’s mask sealed filters air. Oh fuck’s sake, give rest “no one tell do” anti personal-responsibility speech?
It’s really simple: want eventually stop spread virus least amount people risk (your family mine included) wear masks, limit contact others, compromise freedoms luxuries greater good. value personal pleasure safety everyone, go day, before. Right! Christ. can’t believe stupid is. feel like I’m living bad dystopian movie. nj boarder camera's crossing, considering flanked Delaware river one side bridges. second cross one bridges state licence plate bound flagged camera pulled over. least health minister introduce guidelines social distancing avoid getting infected COVID-19. vaccine that? Oxford? I'm glad US tests. mom RN front line get tested twice job, received lovely testing bill $500. countries make fun us.........  Young dying extreme anomalies taken such.

The nursing home situation disaster, Canada, USA,UK, Italy name few. knowingly released suspected covid patients back nursing homes.. focus should’ve begin resources should’ve focused it. should’ve went full protective gear, masks shields care homes fullstop Infringin' muh freedoms! US rights least well Canada.

Canada taken seriously since beginning March, country focused adequate testing, provinces working well together maintaining plans, country didn’t reopen prematurely numbers started fall. True; remember SARS also called (on FoxNews), ""no worse flu"" - understand why, case, China problem it.

Then rightwing brother (who traveled China work) caught said far worst thing ever caught.

He Trumper now. still convinced either hoax blown proportion giant leftwing conspiracy. 

Some people can't learn experience they've got firehose propaganda shoved ass 2 decades. no, it’s racist suggest forms mass protest probably better idea tens thousands people gathering shoulder shoulder. Something something “I’m willing risk lives people community cause” something something “they giving hand sanitizer bro” . 

Will probably lead tens thousands dead (disproportionately minority communities), least Eskimo Pies decided change name politicians pretending consider bunch surface level police reform measures everyone loses interest again. Honestly, they’d probably label RINO siding dems  I'd avoid eastern WA even best times Bodies hell breakfast. 

to detailed, things suggested happen. Triage happens, people less likely survive (largest demographic folks 60) turned away die home, sent tents still room there. 

Military tent hospitals erected, results won’t good, even factoring patient demographics (age, comorbidities, etc). 

Other knock-on effects folks suffer strokes cardiac events asthma attacks car crashes die far greater numbers. 

So, summarize, bodies hell breakfast. Literal freezer trucks full corpses. Mass graves, like NYC.  planning placing top 100... guess we'll never know! /s Illinois here. same. 'Pritzker Sucks' signs lawns everywhere. People calling impeachment. Yet we're safer actions. understand saying, would like chime in. one people comparing times. reason moment lifetime need come together tackle whole. Life paused. matter right goals dreams are. matter accomplished. Everything irrelevant except keeping virus bay. 

Now! Here's difference drives absolutely bonkers: times mentioned, sacrifices things fend doom immense. need tell anyone many many many people's sacrifices lives. global tragedy behold.

And today? asked wear masks social distance. That's it. people REFUSE. 

That compare two times. massive, global effort fight issue. Back then, despite meant could lose lives. Today, wearing mask 30 minutes makes feel hot.

It's fucking shameful, opinion. Duh. control protests fact police keep attacking citizens fun. situation nothing sporting events, easily canceled. guys legit using Monkey see, monkey reasoning like children. one group damage doesn’t mean keep letting everyone damage. That’s weak fucking sauce, dude.  27% patients ICU covid-19, according report. Deceitful title use sub dedicated coronavirus. Nice. However, American believe ""Give Liberty Give Death"". people wants live without masks. that? can't force like China did!!! Oh. Well. Live Free!!! Yeah man, “penetrated deeply” Interesting. Didn’t feel humid me. submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Interesting. remember reading back March younger children (babies &lt;1 yr) also vulnerable COVID-19, still belief?  Probably came rural areas India. muh rights! plenty epidemiologists stating concerns nobody listened. actually got silenced social media ""fact checked"". 

Oh well, I'll go put mask hide closet. Another big difference testing capacity ramped up. cases rising - artifact testing. case rate better, though still imperfect, representation population infection rates March April. So, case Illinois, instance - really can't say 4000 positives recorded May 12 represented day peak cases. Earlier days less positives may total infections. that's less likely true today. spikes we're seeing still require unknown coefficient translate actual cases, coefficient almost certainly much smaller less variable 2-3 months ago. along lower stable coefficients, confidence testing reflecting overall population trends. still may delayed days representation, hardly perfect - really different ballgame terms testing beginning.  work EU airport, Unions asking ban USA flights, Ursula/EU commission make announcement prob tomorrow. 

You officially Banana Republic friends. Dont like Novak. Wear mask Sorry got voted hell. absolutely right. Biden, Bernie, Pelosi.... etc. nobody took seriously already top nightly news America. one known better general public. political points gained (then) pay attention either. Damn, proportionally that's twice many Tennessee ever day Send test house would take one. I’ve working home 100% time since early March long work current company heard Houston morning. I’m I’m TX saw confirmed cases ~545% :/ I've never seen ""the whole yet"" like it. Iowism? Uh interesting New York include California quarantine list behalf residents great state New Jersey would like say: stay hell away us, freaking idiots. hilariously dumb. Androgens work slowly. Window opportunity days severe COVID. Giving lot men antiabdrogens disease ifr 0.5-1.0% prevention ridiculous idea. would go another EU country summer tourism? Like italy spain?

The problem people travel less covid general. lockdowns would worse. reason somebody travel destination 200 daily cases would go 6000. speak healthcare systems overwhelmed, 1000 deaths day on.

I mean countries hard time tourism important doubt lockdown would helped. Unless decided test cover numbers case 100% sure german government would banned flights instead letting people go countries bring back virus germany. remain skeptical Tennessee's number deaths.  36k cases. 542 deaths. Next list Minnesota 33.8k cases 1432 deaths. 

Kentucky 14k cases 537 deaths. Dang, guess wont run then. hoping top 100 place. /s others scoped urgent care Pinellas County Monday. totally packed inside, social distancing. ended waiting cars 7 hours get tested drive try thru didn’t require appointment. places answering phones. I'm imagining R Lee Ermey marine fatigues screaming people, throwing insults like gatling gun overdrive people wearing masks. Damn that's 22x per capita province Ontario Canada. “make love me, randy! please!” Someone pulmonary embolism never admitted hospital? seems rather unlikely (unless saying passed away, case I'm sorry).

You're right - say asymptomatic. specified, either, point stands inflammation occurs mean there's lasting damage. Presumably remaining 33% paying rent..   empty seems. shame dumbass states dumbass states that's we're doing. Shotguns border armed guards keeping quaranteen. excessive coddling minorities insidious way saying ""I care safety""? didn’t mention smoking. Please buy that. Sick exposed people must quarantine. Quarantined sick people can't work. People can't work can't pay rent. one wants tested positive resist testing tracing. long ago this? supposed put cube. Mattis hitting park lately. glad he's he's doing.  cough December mid February. would go away. worst around beginning January. day, don’t know doctor didn’t know was. I’m considering getting antibody test see point, likely December January haven’t left house like all. Even know movements people, capability track trace every one them... Making call soon China. little respect risks imo.  thing happens can't reach contacts pick phone. Nothing happens. fucking loud minority certainly assume they're dangerous. feel safe near someone care health theres contagious disease. know, wash hands either could cough get close. really buying this. Wuhan made masks mandatory January. Masks proven reduce spread germs. want panic people. still hoping China problem.  trying pleases people charge want derail economy. point statement show hypocritical reaction. want kill baby, body choice ok. want kill one, suddenly body choice ok. protest SF 3 weeks ago 30,000 people noticeable increase cases SF. lots people town, possible rise Alemeda/San Mateo/ Santa Clara could it. also coinciding reopening. also look places like NYC Philly large protests never showed surge cases. seems pretty likely outdoors everyone wearing mask risk transmission low. They're breathing corona conditioned air. Like literally one stupid fucking worthless page masks months. People CDC need prison gross incompetence. recently started sorting /r/Coronavirus new again. done since April God help them. far biggest outbreaks relatively rich states. Rural areas *not* resources deal it, poorer regions *not* money stay home work. ways avoid disaster competent, organized federal response spread support richer areas, miracle God chance buy rallies I've seen large majority people wearing masks. Plus outdoors I'm sure helps extent lower transmission. 

If anything trump rallies bigger effect coronavirus case surge black lives matter protests. might need fly soon. I'm thinking getting [hazmat $30 rated stop viruses much smaller coronavirus. [half-mask N100 filters.

I would really like wear both. mind looking like twat 8 hours means get infected. think I'll problems flying like that? security airline ask remove respirator use normal medical mask? know infections come breathing droplets air, normal mask hand washing really anything you. cop corona? Also, fellow West Richlander, believe PD’s statement fireworks stands considered essential phase 1? feeling year especially explosive here.  would enforced? people unwilling wear masks due ""infringement"" yet we're going check travel records? 

 
I'm New Yorker, hopefully, empty seems. going bring back daily White House briefings culminated everyone told drink bleach stick light-bulb butts? Here's goes idiots. daily cases high, people wear masks  cases decrease, makes people question wear masks stop wearing masks, daily cases rise Uh huh. there’s lot data showing areas largest protests beginning see effects. didn’t start seeing effects Memorial Day gatherings 3+ weeks later. We’re seeing surges across country. There’s multiple new protests canceled groups demonstrators tested positive. 

Takes time... people protesting young may serious symptoms, pass along undetected older people ones end getting tested / packing hospitals. 1-2 week lag time point transmission.

But sure, convince 10s thousands people packed together somehow safe right didnt choice. countries quarantine get fine something like 10K people continue think Covid hoax... 🤔 agree wholeheartedly. alone. got fired expressing concern. worked small diner elderly customer base VA.

The mask mandate fucking joke. one follows bc nothing happens don't. cannot allow multi unit housing investment financed mountains debt. want invest real estate, need cap amount finance. Large organizations already proven good money rainy day. Look restaurant corporations defaulted rent shutdowns. They're better average citizen, government bail protect banks. primarily due fact pigmentation reduces vitamin production skin. thing CT, plenty people calling Lamont failure want out, yet lowest rate newest cases country week. apparently people jealous situation Texas/Florida. hard, potential succeed believe persevere.

This fantasy. gives strength, that's fine, cause lose empathy people worked hard seen little nothing. 

The fact people prevented succeeding diminish accomplishments. Agreed. maybe don’t throw stones you’re living glass house. comment right. Everyone please wear mask! They'll protect you, family, community. That's bizarre. live Oregon governor closed state early completely. We've slow open things back today mandatory face mask order time leave house. I've heard absolutely complaints her. lot police wearing masks. physical level professional athletes must play at, serious concern compromising respiratory systems careers. Yes. example best case scenario. reality wealthiest pay get first. World governments also pay top dollar get politicians vaccinated. Distribution masses happen reach peak production, could many months even year vaccine approved. dont care theories... commenting someone needed wanted extra masks, needing show ID can't/shouldn't stop them. client survive COVID shutdown bankruptcy attorney. plans busy. 2009. anything politicians. Kelvin timeline's fault, Vulcan got blown up. Follow Australia's/NZ approach: Initially, trust people self quarantine home, restrictions tighten (here need compassionate significant grounds travel), supply hotel rooms stay 2 weeks. believe we're transitioning charging people rooms, far gratis state though.

Two reasons progression: (1) self isolation work, low compliance random spot checks. (2) hotels anything else anyway, call stimulus. never said people shouldn’t wear masks. don’t think need spread misinformation order get people right thing. 

If don’t want wear mask bad people. realize majority cases Arizona Hispanic, Latino Native American? 

What makes think ""delusional idiots"" trying ""spread it"". find troubling many Americans simply turned global crisis political partisan issue way dismiss blame people based nothing colour skin political leanings. Many anti maskers consider one them. Yup. wait shit show around holidays. Everyone's going want travel. anti-personal responsibility, anything hyper personal responsibility. Working greater good=social responsibility, working better good personal responsibility. Obviously one times, call statement anti-personal responsibility. South States lying ass completely. Nice, looks like back business baby! Empire ""state"" strikes back less deep USA interesting enough. covid, large contact tracing reviews shown 4% household clusters starting young children. groups children believed able spread virus, age groups ability may limited significant public health concern.

Do references numbers?  I'm really interested read since 2yr old trying decide Aug. Holy shit explain countries like Japan/Korea fine without banning China. Italy - one first European counties ban flights China - also one hardest hit Europe. Both. use /s, people sequester away dirty masses buy stocks discount...this exactly true. dipshit ideas, paying piper. 

Luckily employer handling things level head. started come back office plan 2 weeks ago, stopped cases exploded Florida, virtual town hall today, going revisit coming back office July 6th. would example medical exemption mask?

Edit: one would think sort respiratory issue (if that’s exemption you’re thinking), would even important wear one better yet, STFH three states tried idiots. state people making attempt idiots please stay hell away us. Global effort, thank much. Yup, many weird laws still books come ""crazy laws"" lists. never get enforced impetus remove them. That’s BS! mocking racism! anything, bet won’t require POC wear masks get rid faster. Oregon state used ban POC living there. know sounds absurd colleagues literally called unemployment office 300 times day weeks end. Maybe keep win, nothing else do, kids home find another job? really time keep jumping hoops point, move on? don’t internet home cell service gets shut couldn’t pay? It’s like go office talk someone. lot places libraries closed too, access computer phone can’t home? One roommates lost state ID pandemic hit he’s unable collect unemployment can’t get new ID didn’t number written anywhere. DMV opened SOL. Time trillions bailouts.

I hate America much. remember multiple people tell AIDS worse this. even said fauci would agree them. understand. title suggested ICU damn near overflowing covid patients that’s simply case. Florida already fucked. going see 10k cases day soon. Un - Fn believable Yes exactly, none us cash left. MI. govenor frequently referred Hitler pisses yes, able get hair go gym totally par murdering millions people /s.  double take read caption said teen one right. Watch change cases spike. fact, already has. Governors Arizona Texas previously prohibited local governments imposing mask ordinances. past week, they've walked back (they're still chickenshit impose mask requirements themselves, hoping municipalities work stopping thing them). things keep spiking, bet jerks break even towards science based coronavirus policy. whole tri-state (NJNYCT) policy. need enforce states! months ago said going wait number deaths per day reached 0 - that's said happened China (of course could lying that), looks like we're never going reach point. saved! 😆 🤣 😂 year nuts!! Naomi Campbell wore hazmat suit Might gift people northern KY? lower class neighborhood around Cincinnati Airport fact part metropolitan Cincinnati. Many commute work plentiful city. KY KY, people much less educated despise authority lived Appalachia. So, could less engaged social distancing.

Who Cincinnati getting sick time? pretty cynical think government lockdown hurting economy, people soulless consuming machines care get others sick. Abbott made strict actions cities illegal. Except, y'know, backed science doctors? actually true lethal early estimates.  

Once hospital ICU beds get overwhelmed, people untreated drop alarming rates.  

That's 'flattening curve' about. Preventing situation.

Due mask pushback apathy kots Texas cities point.  That's article - reaching point. fun ""certain coutnries"" ""all 192 them"" April :) Tell more. countries like Italy Spain survive LOT US tourism money bring in. thank laugh, wear airport please film 54-year-old diabetic father way. keeps claiming “liberal scare-tactics” thinks everything open again. won’t even listen I, teacher, argue issue schools opening fall.

And thinks way despite PARENTS contracting (thankfully) recovering Covid.

(I’m also mentioning he’s diabetic because, even clear evidence diabetic make Covid infection problematic—at least knowledge—I don’t like isn’t taking health seriously midst this). Northern Illinois: 3/4 people grocery store wearing masks. Gotta love midwest stubborness.  people AZ care enough anyone else even wear fucking mask... June 6. Slight increase positive rate day two already lower two days ago riots daily protests positive rate astonishingly low. really think poor people oodles free time learn life skills? Typically spend time working avoid systematic violence would otherwise literally crush them. 

Also, easier use skills barriers broken early schooling. funding system deliberately destroys poorer schools lack funding makes point moot, dont'cha think? Even Fauci played instrumental role curtailing HIV epidemic struggles time.. total case count extraordinarily high, think 14% NYers coronavirus? Probably less people catch again. Ugh, Schuette. I’ve never happier weed ballot pushed election blue. I'm curious 'everything right' case.

I'm sure can, probably good story think they're dong enough. Care share? It’ll spread. Tons folks rural TX go big city shop. 

It hub-and-spoke way every part TX, make mistake. Trump caught COVID-19 died assuming Pence rest administration run cover fact, idiot base STILL wear masks. They'd go proves secretly lib along. Sure country trump president think it’s fair anything goes. also lot say viruses like gonna living mad max style soon. Yep, another issue see time year people Phoenix surrounding areas go INSIDE rather rest country goes outside time year enjoy summer. It’s hot there. 

And know difference transmission rates inside opposed outside. 

So add people wearing masks social distancing they’re fucked. Widespread public health problems like obesity, cancer, etc reinfection thing tricky. sure lot talk people saying months ago got ""again"". time goes by. starting feel like chatter around inflammatory response children nobody wanted associate COVID, absolutely clear related. probably #1 concern right now, immunity really around 2 3 months. case, think we're going see overwhelming evidence reinfections happening next 30 days. 

Then again, would think China/Italy would already evidence now, yes?

Don't mind me....this nervous ramblings. I'm pretty freaked chance virus able return endlessly, like Coronaviruses do, short amount time. Same. shame live though. F off. Deaths take longer case positives
....on average 10 days 2 week lag reporting. Check deaths 3 weeks people getting sobering numbers. Also. Current numbers good. Kids getting tested more. fact positive % going means infection spreading faster testing ramping nasal cavity 
 
Which nose, cover nose also! manage nothing all.         

But interesting come consider victory worst country 2 months ago ok ""only"" worst country Scandinavia since [the numbers well put. Even weeks quarantine deaths pile on. 

NY shut March 18. Deaths peak April 8. giant billboard side road says ""Whatever OK. You, OK."" Gyms require masks south florida. Go planet fitness one two people wear mask 60. Usually ones wearing employees. Sure. I'm European, going beer couple friends called ""risky"". Gathering hundreds, less 1m distance other? Nah, that's risky dudes, keep up! Mind business Yah, difference - 

1. want something
2. something
3. something

But anything learned year ... law law people care enforce it. deep learning figure effectively micro target looks like scene Ghost Busters. Insane. Maine quarantine anyone entering state. folks asking, enforcement. 

That pisses folks want stricter lock down, pisses people want lock-down.

From hospitality industry complaining about, though, even toothless quarantine causes vacationers re-think travel plans.

Recently, Maine allowed recent (within 72 hours) negative COVID-19 test substitute quarantine. I'm interested see southern neighbors make allowance. Well done America *Edam Gouda entered chat* people 'dying' watch 'sportsball', alien idea watching millionaires throw ball around make billionaires money. ICU still 90% full. can't put non covid patients elsewhere. say six months, could give couple bullet points think possible? I'm arguing against, that's bold statement make I'm interested data behind it.  There's still chance :3  Governor forbidden it. literally can’t. Abbott fucked entire state major way. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* *martyrs conspiracy theory medical experts asked trump stop talking briefings, instead cancelled please point stat? partner started working provider reservation week. live side country I’m trying keep going Arizona. yeah weeks ago proof states including TN extreme excess amount cardiac related deaths almost certainly related covid, included total Well much moving Huston Next year. Come guys get government order. moved Houston too. Great.   get daily deaths reported age group ?

On ADHS find total breakdown Biopsies, mammograms, x-rays CT scans mild symptoms. things delayed happening right serious implications future. Yes get whipple surgery know pancreatic cancer person mild pancreatitis getting scheduled CT scan develop stage 4 catch it? someone able walk months can't get hip replacement.

A lot cancelled right breast implants ignorant think information available. many serious medical conditions caught blood tests primary care appointments might delayed months?

Cancelling medical procedures serious, serious needs treated such. may necessary coronavirus cases get high never something done months advance ""just prepare"" hell going enforce this? political theater bullshit. hotels owners NYC quarantine vacationers. Cuomo. [turns around goes check stocks pharmaceutical companies making hydroxychloroquine] op but.. want feel right. just.. right. 

I never wanted it. it. consequences. holy cow, UI + flat $600 scaled income. Yeah, would push people 100% bracket. TIL. thanks information, MN brother! Nah, really. Cases surging. suggest infection higher across country April we're testing three times many people absurd. Gottlieb estimated catching 1 20 cases back then. we're likely catching 1 5 1 10. official count comparable, likely actual infection still lower.

We may get back peak though. They'll say, everyone die someday there's use living fear. I've seen lot comments. Smh Illinois's governor. People hate businesses closed long faires canceled No, wasn’t randomly naming cities, naming cities large protests took place (and many still taking place) seen kind spike cases AFAIK. course large gathering people going create risk transmission, outdoor protests urban areas high PPE compliance responsible noticeable increase cases we’d seeing spikes urban areas across country. aren’t, though, there’s pretty clear geographic divide. Northeastern states weren’t protesting differently far tell, protests weren’t smaller - DC, NYC, Philadelphia largest near largest number people protesting - seems like contribution new cases marginal. Thankfully longer excess mortality anymore.

This true, according recent report Statistics Sweden.They say levels *closer* normal, back number deaths per week Sweden continues decrease - **but week 23 excess mortality still registered**, Statistics Sweden's preliminary statistics show. Overall, levels close normal time That's obvious. point is, hear ""at near capacity"" normally quite often. Thank response. understand telling people buy especially hoard n95 masks, similar masks. least homemade cloth masks shouldve recommended help slow spread therefore protecting healthcare workers slowing spread. 

To day see many people wearing masks rationale trying protect themselves, knowing actually protecting others themselves. dont tell otherwise, even wearing mask wrong reasong, least wearing one. palm beach county south florida mandatory face mask rule starts today Go back time.

Save Gorilla, save world. What?! adult ICU beds already?!?! right. cases survival make death seem better.  Idk. leave it, delete repost since many people seen yet.

Gave chuckle though; knew meant Nope pretty sure that's China. confused statement. 
Do believe apathy help stop spread deaths ?  People bored COVID 19 means it’s important take measures save lives need link sources, hunch meant delay preventative screening : ) COVID-19 end, one way another. worst case scenario, people accept death rate, whatever is, live lives anyway. We're good chunk way already, better worse. promise able see hug friends (unless immunocompromised). 

And - since looks like we're going welcome countries - good time see see closer home, no? :) easily think half-dozen places I'd love visit within good ol' US A! Keep spirits, nothing last forever. better worse. Mass, masks work wonder long MLB attempt season last? That's unfortunate friend still went appointment, could infected staff (the dentists wearing masks shields, protect - still risk getting infected standing patient's open mouth). live Toronto went orthodontics appointment last week. answer series Covid-related questions parking lot even allowed in. wonder friend's dentist screened day appointment? Absolutely. would like think response would far different terribly lethal virus, like killing 80% people infected. would hope people would become text book examples pandemic response guidelines. personally think big reason many people blow virus like 50% people get even show symptoms. nature virus created sense security safety. happened friends apartment building. landlord sold indian company overseas attempting collect rent phone. even know legal. live Illinois US. took seriously, received bunch crap people outside inside state (some lawmaker even tried sue governor mandated closures) yet today we're GREAT. cases dropping testing positive rate 5%. feel lucky. I'd say majority people around wear masks try socially distance. think people great staying away friends family anymore. People started hang smaller groups secret late April May overall, we've ok.

Everyone awaiting test results probably weekend. dilemma work week I'm little hesitant go back tomorrow like supposed to.

Spanish flu much worse, higher mortality, primarily affected young healthy people might imagine effected workforce. 

So like wrong say covid seasonal flu, also wrong say like Spanish flu. possible things go then, really idea. healthcare systems different, population levels health different, economy different.

Our economy leveraged lockdowns catastrophic way everyone every business debt. we'll see happens. lose lose. Pilots need certain number flight hours keep ready status. flights gonna happen either way. chose flight paths “boost morale” something, flights happening somewhere inevitable.  Oh know, dead get virus!!! Well, last wednesday 100 also following lot days low numbers too. briefing yesterday said deaths per day around 32 dropping low overall yet. $1,200 nice, went cremating father. cover cost. Ya dont understand issue. 

They trying protect healthcare workers, wouldnt prioritizing public wearing masks also protect healthcare workers would treating less infected patients? really dont understand never realized people telling public wear masks, rationalizing ""we must protect healthcare workers"" Thing is, even 'lock up' elderly people allowing virus roam free? Nursing home staff would similarly need locked up, likewise staffs children family members, hospital staff families. takes one minor slip one member staff ends infecting whole nursing home.

Letting virus run free introduces many variables make impossible effectively keep one group safe work every summer tourism I’m italian, tourism US big think is. That’s pretty messed up. You’re number one killing people  ‘Twas day rally

And crowd 

Not face mask any!

The Donald proud.

To scream cheer

What shame many

Wouldn’t next year. Well seem quite delusional. death rate per capita twice US. PM somehow handled even worse Trump he’s even preparing second wave. Downing Street refused accept call Britain’s medical leaders review prepared country second wave actually back were. US testing triple March/April, likely we're catching much higher percentage overall cases. words, we're probably still quite bit lower peak despite comparable official case counts.

That's say get though. \*sigh\* I've paramedic almost 20 years. I've lost several old friends stand let get bullshit. really remarkable grasp it.

It's like everything fire would expect people go merry way shop amidst flames. Good. put work, listened experts taken pandemic seriously. numbskull states get ruin us. ""every state themselves"" mentality truly horrifying. 

Feels like living 50 different countries. infection rate Bulgaria go stonks reactionary measure preemptive measure? Richmond Virginia, started working turning baseball stadium triage center beginning outbreak realized numbers much lower expected need yet. pediatricians accepting adults needed right expect needed soon? Maybe everything relatively okay?  UVC wand? Yeah pretty much. USA failed spectacularly though. getting worse. many people state angry wear masks. Fuckin morons. Taiwan better free covid. takes elevator stairs Americans fucked Let's serious here. One side USA knows wearing mask right thing do. side Trump comes pleads it, won't. Honestly hope covid slow anytime soon Trump get ousted White House, else it'll 4 years complete idiocy, covid well. assure nobody laughing thing Europe.  Buckle Tony, we’ve got wet markets brewing kinds goodies. complete bullshit hard understand someone stupid. referencing distribution care, actual care itself. US advanced medical care available citizen insurance world sizable margin. literally could wrong. could distributed better, indisputably advanced. entire theme pandemic thing. Okay, maybe ""good"", 99.99% go around killing people reason. That's stupid ass flawed study everyonelearns Beijing somewhere said masks essentially ""did nothing"" except didnt study even remotely close controlled setting completely flawed study says nothing... exact argument nurse admin (wife's mother) also thinks ""when time time"" wont wear mask... shes nurse's BOSS wont basic thing. Peoples inability look basic things think here. recommendation ignored initial reports coming China experience. top literature day 1, reasonable study suggesting masks ineffective. anything, data suggested N95s surgical masks eye protection, using clinic since early March. argued presided instead resigning. commander US soldiers massacred hundreds Iraqi civilians, later fought holding US soldiers command responsible war crimes. also personally responsible ordering Mukaradeeb massacre. wait outbreak make people wear masks. Here's idea. Masks, everywhere, everyone (medical exemptions, obvi) 6 months.

Yes, healthy people get virus bacteria, affects directly relates health. fact you’ve even tried arguing astounding.. health studies reading? Definitely since elective surgeries include non immediately critical (if thing) cancer surgeries hip replacements among things cause insufferable pain interim. Elective means imminently kill you.

I agree also. Disney open. Hotels opening house visitors. Bars/restaurants around Disney probably open. That's like majority jobs central florida. places (except maybe Disney outdoors) good places disease spread. They're fucked wearing masks march! I’ll admit. Didn’t start wearing mask early April (in Michigan) due conflicting info started wearing one week prior employer requiring it. week later governor mandated it. husband's family shit time.

They've sick fever days want pass seeing everyone. course hugged everyone helped dish food people without word. sickest I've ever 5 days one parties. 

They're holding 4th July party told must attend. I'll wearing mask whole time bring water eat. I'm sure I'll get grief care There's little evidence actually. one would blame protests instead opening soon.

They small protests near spike started. 

While think protests contributed spike believe opening non essential businesses recreational venues created explosion.

For instance, venue families opening soon. advertising cleaned everything close quarters, touching everything layout. way keep clean.

The bars restaurants define social distancing. sure practicing it. saying, according official state-run Chinese media, everything better China? even half medical ""professionals"" deny science. crazy. Theres actual nurse admins say masks dont anything deny science way toddler would.. weve already doubled number projected deaths AUGUST beginning june.

Um.. “we” ? 

Are speaking billions people ? Oh ok. obviously doesn’t much issue it. Move on. situation living Germany. It’s issue. Also passport document fly. Also argument.

But maybe talk doctor. seem obsession needing shit. Two points figures.

1) US still middle first wave infections. Covid cases south rural areas increasing. European countries mostly past first wave. 

2) site took data People right ask whether numbers representative several reasons. First, countries worldwide decide differently gets tested virus, meaning comparing case numbers death rates could extent misleading. Germany, example, started testing relatively early country’s first case confirmed Bavaria January 2020, whereas Italy tests coronavirus postmortem. Second, people go see (or see, due testing capacity) doctor mild symptoms. Countries like Norway Netherlands, example, recommend people non-severe symptoms stay home. means cases known time, could significantly alter death rate presented here. Third finally, numbers like change frequently depending pandemic spreads national healthcare capacity. therefore recommended look (freely accessible) content dives specifics, coronavirus testing capacity India number hospital beds UK. additional pieces information get full picture, something statistic current state simply cannot provide. 

TLDR: metric chose useful measure anything right now. Makes total sense.. mean nothing bad happen cramming kids knows summer together. Keeping mine home online school them. it.

We knew fact wearing masks slow spread viruses. Even werent 100% sure particular virus, would safe assume masks still work (and retrospectively know wouldve right assumption).

Edit: joke chemists politicians think happened NYC getting better rapidly around time states reopening many people likely started convincing everything fine now. Many copy see majority area wearing masks crowding bars restaurants, likely well.

But I'm guessing putting thought think since warmer outside, alone means harder spread anywhere (in hotter states south, people going spending time indoors centralized AC, conditions indoors negate whatever benefit warmer temperatures outside). based facts, convince virus mutated less dangerous less infectious magically (again, numbers NYC). That's including politcal team sport minded people think wearing mask Team Blue wearing proves True Team (R)ed Trmp supporter. confidence particular outbreak control, also firmly believe dozens horizon China.

American, horrified blame countries banning us traveling countries.  shitshow end near future. Same. KY lot vitriol spat new Governor actually trying manage aggressively. NC here. Recently went grocery shopping saw grand total 21 masks, employees also worn incorrectly, place packed day Thanksgiving. Every time go anywhere exactly same. 

To say people wearing masks accurately describe it. *Almost one* wearing them. argue anyone thinks differently. 

Masks healthy. confines breathing carbon dioxide, decreases oxygen intake, increases infection risk triggering Dorman retro-viruses already existing bodies), breathing germs inside used mask constantly. everyone massive amounts mask use discard. ONE. 

I personally cannot breathe well feel asphysiated wearing it. 

How medical establishment instead informs public increase intake nutrients 
Vitamin D3 (20 min sun daily),
Vitamin C, 
Magnesium Glycinate, 
Zinc, and
a good bio-available B-100 Complex (don't forget Vitamin E Omega 3s).

To own, one gotten ill. 

They keep dickering around wearing masks, etc, teach strengthen immune system. Smh.

If insist face covering, I'd rather use plastic cover, face hugging mask. 

If everyone's immune system strong proper nutrition supplementation, believe virus would die tracks.

I hear anyone saying felt say it.

I'm MA, run sick time(5days per year/gets paid end year resets), company policy states would use vacation time(15 days per year/rolls yearly caps 60 days) based understanding law, acceptable. place years covid, honestly sure would handled now. got laid month April, UI asked remaining PTO stated company used laying iirc. 

Weirdly enough, MA, vacation considered wages earned, paid upon separation employment. leave/get fired, sick time disappears ether, since ""wages earned."" locations CT NE states, get paid vacation sick time leaving. 

Its weird state. Part time employees also get state mandated paid sick time one hour every 30 hours worked. rolls yearly caps 40 hours can't accrue anymore. But, form fill stating sick, doctor visit, care immediate family regulated full time employees sick pay. twice deaths, half cases? I'm skeptical case number. what’s 9+10 like goddamn animals

Guess humans are? fun. ""We reopen!""

""Screw masks!""

You traded people's lives that. Lol, need good governor like Di Santa’s Abbott. /s Deaths wave start happening days. There's lag. economy collapses even harder due people refusing visit Florida shit show. Floridian also agree you. People really need get heads 🍑 need learn use fucking logic man. rabies vaccine used treat rabies. statement true. said ""**only** vaccine used treat rabies"" would false.  I’ve going local high school evenings. Minnesota must really value education place like dozen different fields sports. there’s one else there, run fields dancing singing top lungs like I’m Julie fucking Andrews Sound Music. mental health improved much since started this. look percentages see negative positive spin. Sure older people die soon anyway, understand wanna go care get die really. 
But younger people 6% chance? That's quite bit seem think they're invincible. 
You add percentage dying Covid top risks underlaying conditions. would increase % chance. 
A young person could end getting dying grandparents not. 
Also consider long term health conditions recovered people showing. Organ damage, reduced lung capacity, fatigue neurological issues. That's risk too. muh freedoms, muh flu, muh hoax, virus over. that. Even university professors I've met U. S. self constructed weird, unbreakable glass prisons around thought constructs belief systems. difficult free flowing, back forth intelligent conversation anyone U.S
 without someone either completely tuning express disagreement person getting angry defensive. True. rising prices medical grade oxygen might make profitable company switch Heat kills virus.

The number cases soon zero.

Masks dont work.

Just listening presidents advice.... issue everyone refuses elect third party go one terrible presidency. hear dumb two choices.... go third party show enough think new parties run elections actually take seriously. “They’re hospitalizing everybody! They’re putting people big beautiful hospitals said slow down! Slow hospitalizations.” forget gyms. fully reopened packed social distancing masks. Good thing we're getting rid testing! Can't cases one's getting tested.

And worry overflowing hospitals. We'll stop admitting patients. Problem solved. ""long term""

been around less year ""bless heart"" would work cases south think coming Wisconsin also soon rally.  Re-read first sentence. They're cancelling huge deal religious pilgrimage upmost importance people around world. South Dakota comparatively unimportant tourist trap pilgrimage middle one countries handled covid worst, can't bothered cancel year. Nah, muh freedumbs! growing case count alone alarming, even concerning percent positivity.  new Florida cases yesterday (6/23) jumped 15.91%. according @HealthyFla data.  suggests widespread contagion way confirmed cases indicate. It’s hard economically, people can’t spend money they’re dead. way 10,000 per day. We’ve seen movie Second wave Latin America hopefully cases region grow 2-2.25 million July deaths doubled 200,000. check numbers twice day state, Mass, still April curve. Exactly. NY, especially NYC, one densely populated areas entire world. get whacked March Trumpy boi still calling flu surprising. surprising us residents set shit aside started pulling direction got thing control. southern states basically dodged spring completely ignore NY turned around fucking maddening. ""Out sight, mind"", ""NYC filthy anyways, happen here"", etc. bullshit try marginalize. come clear sight them, though. hope state local leaders look data every morning think deaths hands.

Almost 80 lives lost, I’m sure majority could saved focused strict mitigation strategies. 

How much longer Ducey Christ going turn blind eye? *laughs European* Please stop trolling comments. I'm deleting right got answer. Perhaps instead part problem stifling open conversation solution provide quality comments. isn’t fault it’s everyone’s problem. 3 states acting together. stuck every state national leadership state governor make decision. afford it. They’d rather super bloated military. hate government much. It’s madness. CV explodes block lays low friends family they’ll get it. Seeing believing. getting rate? Monday 7.74% positive. Covidtracking.com might best bet visitors Disney realize they'll made quarantine get back home states. Minneapolis, yet Minnesota pretty flat numbers. actually ask Covid patients significant respiratory distress wear masks go rooms help protect us. home. sick, wearing mask help prevent family/housemates getting sick. 

I'm US based, there's bit resistance mask wearing am, nothing like US. notion wearing mask restricts freedom insane me. stops another person dying, really big deal!

Hi, know people allowed entry specific essential reasons. I'd contact German Embassy DC. Hope find answers sorry illness injury. Fuck you. understand shit like doubt fact individual states taking ownership situation lack leadership federal level. That’s one type tax boss hoss. Apollo 13, problem Darth Sidious drink water glass? said IFR people 45 .001%. 78 people state 45 died. means multiply 78 100,000 (because .001% 1 100,000) get total number 45 people state. 78 x 100,000 7.8 million. means IFR .001% state right now, would 7.8 million 45 younger people living would infected. problem is, 7.2 million people total here. means assertion complete utter nonsense.

Even IFR .01% (1 10,000) nonsense would mean 780,000 people 45 infected state. stat says absolutely nothing dangers vaccinated. meant slowing testing? Good. EU correct this.

* look books written Medical Doctors Researchers governing science legality behind vaccinations: Look U.S Vital Statistics Chart since 1900 notice childhood illnesses LONG decline vaccines

NY moved heaven earth build surge capacity end March.

Texas leadership seem moving urgency required. Allowing restrictions gatherings 100 people?

They last week. need start rolling mitigation ICU measures quickly thing grows. both. scary thing full depth either crises reached yet. indefinitely forever think people overreacting. completely support decision. People put vacations hold. Actually surprised many places legally go public topless. current studies suggest Italy far away herd immunity even hardest hit areas. lockdown made pandemic reach central southern areas, almost non existent herd immunity south. Also, suggesting focusing herd immunity actually immunity lasts long worse now. people large indoor gatherings likeminded people refuse take seriously. odds infected greater rebellious non-mask wearers. one building. super super spreading event. factors increase. perfect storm. That's theory. model, based assumptions may may bear out. We're gonna find actually happens real time, there's turning back now. Dont say that.. guy delivers Well, Obama actually put together pandemic playbook swift national response shortly ebola scare. course, Trump threw around time fired pandemic Response Team save money.

Our lack response purely fault Trump administration. Europe (except UK Sweden) death rate fallen dramatically. US ~2 people per one million die daily, Spain Italy used early epicenters number 0.1-0.7. We’ve got Athens Paris, too. Gotta gotta do. blame them. went store days ago 10% people even cared enough put mask. one largest cities south. Muaaaaaaah rights! 100% correct gov't quarantine powers. However, powers end border. Hence, quarantine allowed in, that's it. Even 361 says this. Page 3, #1 ""legal authority"". Citizens subjected that.

Edit - enforcement. pull CT tag NY border 'just because'... thats problem. 5A respective. it, get rocket science degree obtain right wear mask. Okay may *slight* overstatement job actual essential service, still feels pretty shitty cram 40 us small space without literally anything space us try get people things home.

Meanwhile administrative side working home office months.

We *COULD* utilize empty offices spread essential workers would much moving around slowing work flow. Stop dealing absolutes. ridiculous statements. Yeah agree all. 

Collapse empire? Maybe, could care less that. 

But late? Nah. give go dig head sand somewhere. rest us keep fighting defeatists. 7 13 federal testing sites located Texas. it’s saying people can’t enter state. keep quarantined 14 days. plan building quarantine spots people stay? due track people actually staying quarantined long they’ve quarantined? 

This posturing, way asking people “please don’t travel here”. ""Houston, problem..."" Yeah know, two months Illinois. 

The hospitals need get bailed many close. Hospitals self sufficient. ICU make lot money hospital, unless count tests imaging etc, even then. Hospitals want ICU believe American right. can't leave free market subsidized. Yeah think general problem people everywhere think virus big deal. somewhat amplified states opened people blindly trust leaders. think he’s one left leaning figures could get lot conservative votes. I’d love see run! Absolutely agree. mask ""cure"", suggesting is. 

Condoms prevent pregnancy 100% time. I'm still going wear them. thing forgot going herd immunity means 2.5 million deaths Yup. mask compliance marches honestly astonishing. 

Granted, specific demographics marchers suggested strong likelihood mask compliance (we’re allowed discuss demographics here), even would’ve expected serious granola types refuse masks reasons. really didn’t happen. 

As note, Bay Area, people mostly taken seriously. Turns number enough critical mass turn tide. able secure transcript future game:

It’s similar word “justice,” word contradictory meanings different people. militant right won’t listen Mad dog fucked. thought did, COVID would punish them. 

I live MN, protesting heaviest May 28th - June 6th so. Eighteen days later MN lower ever, even affected counties lower ever (Hennepin Ramsey).  

MN 5/18 - 5/25, 7 day span: averaged 706 new cases 6,800 tests day. 

MN 6/17 - 6/24, 7 day span: averaged 352 new cases 13,000 tests day. 

Half cases double testing. 

Being outside really big difference. (I surprised!) virus us vaccine. Sure, wear mask... slow spread, thing still continue spread. literally posted blogs.... That’s narrative I’m hearing far right family members well. Looks like true hospitals get paid 20% covid positive patients Medicare evidence diagnosis falsified. Yeah, soft shit, generally speaking. gonna make rough climate change. Honestly, reckon notion we—as society—don't take personal action keep ""heroes"" safe, might deserve efforts. would prefer: ""We could fucked, dramatic federal state action, come October.""

The California mask ordinance good start. feel need compel county-by-county compliance recalcitrant police chiefs politicization disease. seems failing miserably that. means must focus public awareness rather compliance. seems without help media, possibility.

We need good ideas point feels like one willing listen.

EDIT: wish people like spreading awareness online. part, we've ghettoized walled garden style echo chambers.  wearing mask possibly killing someone Watch footage doctors took cellphones NY nearing peak.

The people need convincing say they're paid liberal hack. authoritarian. hope never hands levers power. disease taking weak. mother nature culling herd, affects everyone. enough information blasé May 23rd. Anyone thinks protest nothing dillusiional. agree, don’t think rentier class get much sympathy. 

I don’t think anything temporary UBI works though. Landlords owned REITs owned private equity firms wait nugget, small time landlords lose property. banks foreclose. thing 'done this' Federal UI alone U.S. giving people $2,400/month top one-time $1,200 stimulus check. Texas still rising first wave. Look death rate COVID might make sense admin literally putting us prison ""for safety"" like seem desire. opinion plucked air deciding someone *deserves* die not. People risk, long already know need keep safe. Hopefully will, considering pre-existing conditions behind vast majority virus deaths, would people spend much lives drinking, smoking, growing morbid obesity drugs, unfortunate news probably wont. problem rest world stop save people could really care less. smokers already know need stop smoking die, risk already know need doing. everyone else's problem need stop make smokers assaulting drug addicts quit, might stop dying.

I listened Cuomo tell many days. - actually went high school Greg Abbott, Texas governor. year ahead Duncanville High School, suburb Dallas. didn’t know him, thought younger brother guy crush on, kind paid attention wing classes in. clearly remember arms seemed long walked rather like monkey, swaying side side swinging arms walked forward. longish bangs always swinging head one side move bangs face. always smiling. grade husband could celebrated 45th graduation governor’s mansion. case, would polite words him.

What world. Take care good luck!

P.S.: never find Gary Abbott Greg Abbott we’re brothers! Yup, right. beat COVID. over. /s ""This, unfortunately, proves younger people immune virus complications, despite critics stating affects elderly weaker.""

You set argument nobody making. ""critics"" claimed younger people **entirely** immune virus? facts show younger people **almost entirely** immune virus. statistically dangerous flu. story change anything, unfortunate is. typically province young believe behave immortal. young once, confirm case. 

There always risk. 0.01% risk still bad outcome someone. sick recovering still unpleasant. Complications exist. Nothing life ever risk free.

This sub-reddit, however, moribund fascination rubbing every under-40 death noses ""the young people"" punitive glee daring believe might less susceptible coronavirus. bizarre kind schadenfreude I'm sure says anything good us half-celebrate every young death paroxysm smug self-satisfaction. Like ""that'll learn em"". 

Kind repugnant, I'm honest. Fuck guy. Fuck guy hard. didn’t get sick sharing drinks since woke symptoms next day, almost certainly got someone else sick sharing drinks. sick fucking morons coming get sick like ‘OOOPSY DIDNT KNOW SUPPOSED TAKE SERIOUSLY LOLOLOLOL’. half year global pandemic. excuse anymore ‘I’m selfish ass’.

AN ADDENDUM: FUCKING GUY WANTS PAY HOSPITAL BILLS GOFUNDME. 3.60 hundred patients. great, terrible. Wtf plan this?  think meant 20% make sense. Small businesses need voluntarily shut down. Put masks go protest make government provide safety net get shit together. thing protesting begin - government assistance reopen. Maine. want Mills impeached thrown jail “violating” rights. Go Bombers Cape May ferry NJ Elmira NY, cordon-able 450 mile line along three rivers. Something like 92% vehicle traffic crossing major highway bridges. point 20-30x likely know someone laid know someone died covid. Yep pathetic rationalization. confronted facts: COVID really bad, respond goal post moving.

Stay afraid. easier control way. weather 55 85 350 days hte year? close major employers paying 28 year olds 250k+ total comp? region hundreds thousands housing units balance jobs nearby? Yeah well could reach capacity come tomorrow. god.

I really want die COVID governor cares reopening economy value human life.

I'm Houston, I'm still Texas. cities fare better nothing done.

Fuck governor. I'm sure already know answer that, avoid back forth stupid comments saying big deal since 'x' kills people per year?

wear mask. fucking difficult. college town central Pennsylvania starts school August. see 1/4 people without masks out. worrisome say least. doubt Pennsylvania downward trend come mid September. true, depressing. surge cases, course. positive test rate today 20%. Things getting rough Deep South. 

Source: 6,000 people recently attended funeral outrage. first offense simply fine doubt you’d receive grounds compassion. border checks incredibly difficult enforce. I’d personally risk say goodbye dear friend. police even enforcing masks, doubt enforce this. 

I’m sorry loss. Right. 90% capacity largest medical center country....we brink able keep that's quality discussion point. However need right last word gloating makes point seem proving someone wrong. far lowest motive debate. 

I hope right sunshine rainbows August. think people making decisions don’t know that? fact they’re willing shows dire situation is. Except New York City two months warning federal support. reliance public transportation extremely narrow window act (I've read 1-2 weeks, generous), politically practically impossible shut city 8 million people without direct testing, get fucking tests, tests Trump administration decided throw tests everybody else using otherwise shit bed dramatically. I'm still furious about. Thirty thousand dead New Yorkers counting, deaths fucking avoidable competent national leadership actually gave shit American lives.

This, though? states reopening like ""fuck masks, science!"" much warning, adequate testing, know 10x virus spreads? like stochastic mass murder. Nope. West Virginia high hopes you! person replied to, he's referring herd immunity, enough people contract disease develop antibodies disease stops spreading lack new hosts. proportion people need antibodies (either illness vaccine) varies based R0, reproduction rate, disease. 

It weeks since dug R0 numbers Covid, recall estimates R0 averaging around 3, would put population necessary herd immunity around 65%-70%. 70% US population roughly 230 million. expect number cases reached vaccine/treatment developed allow people develop antibodies number cases decline significantly. assuming effective preventative medicine developed meantime would change dynamics disease significantly. case growth isn’t coming protests though.

I think bad idea lie things, damage people's trust that's sorely needed. We'll never second lockdown. WH would much rather everyone die take second economic hit. Lazy turds love lockdown, real men keep working providing. makes zero sense. states largest consistent protests still trending downwards - protests significant contributing factor? Got mine 7 series ear infections 👍 Again, history. vaccine help half us actually utilize it. So, none anti-maskers. keep spreading shit around. Seems like outdoor areas fairly safe...... protests led infections, Lake Ozarks thing people freaking led (no?) infections.

I know screaming rollercoaster effects things, maybe Disney needs keep indoor stuff closed. Pirates Caribbean you! enjoy Big Thunder Mountain, though. MI initial outbreak now. Rather, MI's initial outbreak back March-April. Especially lower peninsula Michigan, near bigger cities. 

For example, South Eastern MI hit early on, especially Metro Detroit area.

The Governor's shelter place order closures bars non-essentials really drove deaths spread while. Governor reopened much MI (with small restrictions) Memorial Day. removed non-essential business closures around June 8th, though zones still earlier phases reopening. largely lifted pressure state's legislatures vocal, anti-lockdown protesters. climbing cases reflection that, likely, well population Michigan growing lax masks social distancing.  They’re saying it’s safe I’m sure don’t actually care they’re gathering issue take left hypocrites. I’m sure people right serious hypocrites part people using protesters logic show they’re hypocrites. Fuck you. lot sensible progressives Texas following science-based advice, self-quarantining despite early re-opening (my friends family included), stop generalizing. state leadership's inaction unforgivable. Tough go job back open lolmerica.  Hahaha, thanks meant SETRAC dashboard look severe comment indicated, asked saw it.  Well, know numbers real point. make sense? Federal funding would help reduce spread across state lines provide resources states need Ok, come on. surveyed whopping 2,500 people. ""most Americans""....blah blah blah????? Seriously??? 2,500 people speak 300+ MILLION.

And bet picked right neighborhood get results wanted. Yeah, church AZ Trump spoke yesterday claiming ""covid free"" ionizing filtration, long people elbow elbow, they're going breathe others droplets. Unless they're masked sitting several feet apart. 

It sound good though problem buildings use AC--the virus appears love cold damp. wonder would work meat packing plants. That's people assume, flu usually hits rural areas harder variety reasons mostly lack medical resources.  Well, define beating it? handful states counts decline, ones hit initially hardest back March seem downward trend track. NY great example, PA well NJ. live it’s definitely going right direction, that’s much “at moment” thing states. Northeast general seems trend hot spots shifted southern western parts country. 

It doesn’t take long things tick back we’re seeing. states mentioned seem taking things like masks distancing public seriously, hopefully trend continues things keep going down. 11 cases scattered among different zip codes. Today 1 case. bet data dump. evidence far major outbreak. contagion people willingly took vaccine. ton people talked said won’t take initial release I’m liberal area. Agreed, that's separate issue entirely. need relief, relief long policy makers willed it. lock but, decide Lockdown provide relief need ask particular lawmaker would make decision. 

No Lockdown relief? need ask why. would people fain ridiculous set policies? No. AI bots are, mostly, helping eliminate certain kinds errors interpreting test results. probably better think super enhanced microscopes doctors. 

There's lot really cool advances medical tech, none replace actual human doctor (yet). deleted comments assume must deleted cruel, couple callouse age comments. made generalized comment directed one particular near comments, seemed like didn’t want people discuss obesity problem all.

My opinion it’s incredibly unfair girl face pandemic overweight wanted highlight issue ~~How know this?~~

Sorry, please disregard. protests reopenings coincide, reopenings started weeks earlier.

Also states seeing massive spikes right large protests. Arizona, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, etc ""millions millions"" shoulder shoulder. states lucky get couple thousand hundred select cities.

They outside nearly ubiquitous mask-wearing. theory correct we'd seeing massive spikes large cities, we're not.

 Thousands hundreds thousands going eat, sit bars, getting haircut, going salons, shopping indoors weeks thousands continue everyday.

Blaming protests, despite evidence major outbreaks despite spikes predating protests show agenda trying misinform people. People spending money part economy well. disappear. cant afford  know, people mad bible bashing nut jobs. also cases time. NZ handled pretty much perfectly. happened 46-54 year olds? Let em mad, need r/Masks4All go back normalcy like sports, concerts etc, they're realize eventually (I hope).  mean? recent earthquake went surprisingly well magnitude. six total deaths reported. capital there's little damage, mostly buildings already damaged three years ago still repaired, even region hit earthquake damage big earhquakes, overall I'd say earthquake is, comparatively, minor issue. point they’re going close hospitals ER General services. can’t make people way forever, simply make hospitals locked-down patients surgeries procedures allow covid patients staff all. lot deaths luckily. Hopefully trend continues. Facts. takes time people give. People patience, virus patience world. face coverings

And that's issue right there, thank pointing out. Barely anyone wearing coverings UK reducing social distance idiotic stage. Government made 'mandatory' wear public transport etc. buses I've seen, maybe 1 20 drivers wearing mask maybe 1 30 passengers. enforcement? one set balls country actually enforce guidelines.

Remind reducing distancing good thing? want let know upvote. 

And like Einstein said, "" Two things infinite: universe human **stupidity**; I'm sure universe."" Intelligence. Well yes, I'm making comment fluid dynamics indoors versus outdoors. ...or followers would stopped supporting him. followers count anti-establishment asshole turns mask-wearing suggested establishment, means supporters opposite principle. already are, know yet. take monumental shift mindset 40-50% population outright dismissal anything Trump administration say make right again. blindingly obvious lockdowns, masks, test trace isolate (in reasonably developed, functioning societies) save lives indeed economies. China largest example - really need reel more? think otherwise face overwhelming evidence suggests crass ignorance/stupidity, perhaps darker purpose. Keep going Jesus trying clean 🧼 earth dumb people. Let Jesus job stop interfering plan. Canada also universal healthcare, nasty medical bills mail. still maintain it’s big deal right now. went universal couple weeks ago DEAD. really enjoyable seriously lines. top that, fantastic job distancing people, enforcing masks, using every cart, making us use hand sanitizer every ride.

These parks rely heavily air travel available, people world travel see Disney/Universal. Majority time it’s florida residents there. That’s everyone sub blowing this. long air travel still down, parks won’t many people all. 

My advice, go now, it. Doctor (Pre-covid) : Try limit ipad/screen time them.

Me (pre-covid) : oh problem, goto park, beach, disneyland, playgrounds etc...

Im sure doctor understand..... does, tear gas slightly (or greatly, depending exposure) increases sputum production, broadly thought increase SARS-CoV-2 emission (because virus settles lungs.)

When cops tear gas protesters, potentially increasing COVID-19 spread (in sporadic way.)

Last week: [American Thoracic Society calls moratorium tear gas use COVID-19 Haha Tegnell delusional incompetent. unemployed losing substantial hours. like unemployment insurance (which added $600/week to, e.g. $2400 plus existing benefits state) $1200 stimulus check everyone. testing capacity limited set back lack equipment. Heard main lab arizona supposed get new tech july would increase rate 20,000 per day got delayed august ""Just take it!""

- everyone unaware issues within fda pharmaceutical companies. /r/moronavirus extremely unhealthy bro like really nice apartment meth lab. 

Also, far God close United States! “The prediction school’s Institute Health Metrics Evaluation includes caveat deaths virus could drop 146,000 95% Americans wore masks.”

This real takeaway. almost every American wore mask, might able save 34,000 lives October 1.

In terms disasters people familiar with, that’s 11 9/11s, 22 Hurricane Katrinas, 7 times number US soldiers killed Iraq War.

And wear masks, even percent margin people genuinely trouble masks. Incompetence definitely part it, think lot feeds well. started tracking people intelligently limiting state travel everyone arms. People already paranoid government conspiracy control public, add electronic contact tracing mix that's even fuel fire.

Unfortunately common citizen selfish even willing wear mask help community, let alone sacrifice privacy. Gunna interesting see happens Tulsa Phoenix Trump rallies. barely saw masks worn inside enclosed space packed like sardines... feel bad health care workers cities  Michigander here. really rough start March tons deaths (still highest fatality rate country), cases soaring. locked places closed. Everyone wore masks. reopening, much.

If administration prioritizes saving human lives, we'll fine.

These new spikes (not wave 2, continuation wave 1) direct result prioritizing people.

I hate locked hate even feels like waste lies poor leadership. reflection victim America's moronic nutritional policies. 17 going 55. That's criminal. **'spiralling control'** understatement point, today 2nd day row, hitting 33,000 cases 7 hours go day. Needs u/shittymorph Lindsay Graham gave update ways back, something tune ""over dead body extend benefit"" Big thumbs up. Wish Iowa would this. get downvoted missing point.

What getting people getting paid afford help people pay people more. Quick someone set remind bot! I’m Manassas NoVa; CDC declared us (Manassas specifically) hotspot. I’m going back pretty much complete lockdown, personally. ordered bunch masks &amp; filters, better made ones time around. Lots people restaurants masks on... way taking risk.

I increasingly glad school work (GMU) already decided stay online fall. Starting wonder spring 2021... don’t see ending anytime soon. called pointing liberal hypocrisy, nothing new. 

It's like somebody yelling driving dangerous proceed drive car they're important.

Or people get angry other's accepting tolerant trans gay people, intolerant beliefs.  It’s even close over.  Lack leadership tandem general unwillingness take personal responsibility anything. kind spectrum guys. 💜 fuck said anything changing it? dumbass governors IGNORING fact bad NY current issue. 

Go back Fox News, I'm sure find something else latch onto. somebody doesnt know means grand scheme... mean? mean... need understand needs shut things back flatten curve again?? trials Canada elsewhere UBI disagree you. people chose work well. yep blaming solely fauci, administration whole train wreck comes coronavirus response. Also, kinda proves point. doesn’t matter he’s toeing not, said masks don’t work. stopped listen anything regarding health precautions saying that. listened policy updates numbers, like pretty straightforward em. gotta research stay safe, can’t trust officials, can’t imagine much effective fauci could’ve spreading information didn’t work president “task force”. wait next records.

Exponential grows means last three timespan 10 100, 100 1000 1000 10000 new cases.

Here Germany past first wave, recently outbreak meat factory. factory alone around 1500 people. region kind stay away order. ""lockdowns"" never work actually get type coordinated plan federal level. Best summation Ninety-Five Theses ever, haha! wasn’t 46-54 reported well?  June 8th, 2,000 Covid Positive patients Texas hospitals. Today almost 4,100. REITs actually run super thin margins due nature classification required pay methods. lot never really recovered forced sell 2009. average private landlord probably wiggle room. forecast line (the dashed line) starts little back looking. actually follow entire forecast line, would obvious thing do, see net decrease time. Weird explain that. There's really way calm down. bosses sound like dirt bags. ok hope deaths keep dropping That's Putins plan. people caught though, matter many nurses disappeared speaking out. wear mask normally guilty gas station forgetting it. I’ve gassed twice since March doesn’t register I’m going anywhere. brother, living room MA, decided ""all illegals"". Guess channel watches time? decide would call ahead ask using/requiring masks. say yes I'd rule 100 percent. say yes I'd consider I'm sure risky point. remember read saw pretty compelling argument lay-offs come white collar wfh workers August/Sept. feels like already happened companies recently. lay-offs really coming higher earning office crowds, economy wild ride. Kushner's charge last 3 months. Unfortunately, small businesses finding risk enforcement worth potential damage something horrible happens (another shooting, assault, etc). They're understandably fearful could happen.

Large businesses employing security able afford order protect employees enforce rules. Oh see never taken statistics class. thing going “burn out” though. supplement imminent stimulus, also need competent citizenry government continue flattening curve lockdowns let down. Given happened thus far, won’t getting back “normal” time soon. simply large diverse country. every 5 us best follow guidelines, there’s equal greater number elsewhere negating progress. think realistic (but pessimistic) outcome barrel thing, ignore and/or lie losses, bank treatments keep hospitalizations down, push vaccine (which become political issue yet again), hope best. make political, ruling party country inching towards “pandemic doesn’t exist anymore” side aisle, hopes us handling semblance sanity rapidly evaporating. I'm saying government stepped could make corporations easily enough. Canada corporations much different. government provide relief people. Yeah anti-vaxxers anti-maskers generally stupid people lol long take Phase III finish? speed going incredible  literally get fear this. Essential employees : LOCKDOWN?!?  Spike, spiking much spike want?  That's exactly is. They're mental gymnastics.

That's people believing flat earth stuff, educated people, sometimes working science, understand field science works believe world 5000 years old.

Instead using new evidence change existing beliefs, used reasoning skills frame new knowledge around way still allows keep old beiefs. Snopes:

""A “60 Minutes” interview early March 2020 Dr. Anthony Fauci, one leading members President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force, regurgitated social media. segment, Fauci said reason people U.S. needed wear mask.

The problem? clip old, Fauci simply echoing many others argued time, including U.S. Surgeon General, World Health Organization (WHO), Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC). Since then, Fauci’s views organizations changed, information became available disease.""

I've never understood people distrust scientists changing mind new data comes in. process called 'learning', usually good thing.  make 125k either coast, $1200 pay even half rent. parts country cover it. Unless amount based people live, can't make cutoff lower without harming lot families. lucky. central Ohio trump town 3% mask compliance.

lots smokers coughing hacking Walmart yesterday. kinda really gross. 

Please wear mask cover mouth people Man love avocado toast

Source: California current New Yorker, actually feel really safe right New York. Couple things happened. First, shutdown lasted lot longer places like California certainly Arizona new hotspots. New York City second phase reopening. indoor dining yet, get haircuts nail salons gyms anything like that. Cuomo split state areas gave area stringent requirements reopen. enough ICU beds available, reopening continue. annoying works.  


Second, people, particularly city area around it, meticulous wearing mask. probably seen spike due protests. Maybe New York bad everyone scared return. ambulance sirens night, chilled trailers outside hospitals bodies, everyone certainly knows someone virus even knows people passed virus, something you. maybe New York requires certain amount uncomfortable people (subway etiquette, etc.) order city work.  


Yeah California shut early actually opened way early like go gym LA areas Orange County outright refused wear mask. Newsom Cuomo terms getting people rally around cause. Cuomo generally give fuck mayors government officials say. guidelines that's that. McConnell definitely least favorite, head shoulders everyone else.

Ted Cruz least funny guy Twitter, despite Zodiac Killers son. love people 45-55 simply exist.  
Gen what? Gen X?  

...sorry, never heard Maybe secret/unaccounted $500 billion stimulus actually going given back taxpayers! would quite political stunt! N95 point conversation. fauci say 'everyone wear n95 mask'? No. didn't. run barter town??

I wonder Tina days .... likely, none anti-vaxxers use eirher Seems optimistic somehow. Money literally grows trees buddy. fiat currency. reducing distancing good thing?

It boosts economy. saves lives. Even 1m, without masks, risk infection still low.

Weird mention busses, every bus I've everyone wearing one. Trams less so. Trains everyone allowed on, stations giving people well.

I agree comes people actually following guidelines sticking rules though. That's makes think proper lockdown worked, would ignored immediately. If? Thank you! Didnt register normal capacity wasnt occupancy....as occupancy stuck brain. common pneumonia ongoing issues months year afterwards, usually permanent although possibility pneumonia quite severe. many people long term recovery covid yet, link British Lung Foundation recovery bacterial pneumonia look like. Cases can’t spike they’re rising steady rate *points forehead*  keep good fight!  #Hold beer whiskey, we’re gonna die! 

#Wooooo!!! Yes, setting aside political side (already mentioned different comment) asymmetric patterns don’t look good neckties Yes, am. really suck, I'll it. good luck drinking enough water? don’t, usually feel bit hot. anxiety acts like diuretic me.  Yes, people go work... China actively reporting cases since last year nobody decided anything spiked area. (Well, actually Trump attempted stop Chinese air travel people said racist) Ok. I'm saying everyone grandma went Memorial Day like everything fine Covid magically dissapeared. 2-3 weeks later increased outbreaks. Good data claim otherwise hack

Why NYC spiked? Philly spiked? miami rising quickly Orlando?

Data bend reality matter much wish would. post r/astrology r/conspiracy believing completely fake shit make feel better right alley

For record, bet I'd lay money marches increasing spread. either way I'll go data says whether initially thought right wrong. one said isn’t happening, people eating fear fed media. say something two biggest hotspots US right areas hot AF....Arizona Texas outbreaks summer proves thing going 'go away warm weather'....wear fckin mask people!  hard fast rules chicago burbs bad Karen infestation 

At least do...likely oak park Evanston lot academics lively discussions epistemology whereas Barrington people name houses country club memberships Darwin fella bout get back work everything opened again... 5000 caught every day two weeks ago. 10,000 probaly catching every day right now. Yeah I’m essential employee hospital I’m doctor nurse fuck right? nextdoor (which cesspool) neighborhood poll. 300 people responded 82% reporting wear mask. read comments, think result inverted. dumbest people loudest voices. Also Houston. went riding around last weekend get house. 

I saw **DOZENS** bars open, several people should-to-shoulder, restaurants packed, etc. one wearing masks. individual cases, yes. Yup! surprised.

And 2021, hear stories people horrible side effects, recalled. need get masks America flag stamped shit brand disrespectful troops dont wear one. Well duh flying Pittsburgh San Francisco next month want know get tested soon arrive, quarantine 14 days. yes, get done? go anywhere before, nothing really changed TBH. I'm patriotic, dont really care flag. believe freedom speech.  Cuomo’s state 31k deaths nothing rant says change that. DISASTER!  Honestly strongest recommendation read privacy policy app website visit frequently. Google, Facebook, Whatsapp, Apple, even Reddit eye opening content make either take action many people would find paranoid shrug give idea privacy. largely write companies promoting VPN services good, illusions even using VPN provides much anonymity.  course. like they’re seeing daily record breaking numbers come in, obviously logical move make /s undeniable millions people protesting close quarters contributed spike. virus doesn’t care politics. all, seems like whilst deaths lag little behind cases it’s reliable trend line number cases, distorted amount testing. I’m trying put regional stories perspective. 

People seem mistaking “it’s flu, open economy” guy overreacting. I’m saying all. Well, Illinois we’re open fine. Also locked 3 months Wondering whether exempt plan cross border north (and quarantine 14 days) screwed.

It **will** take there. highly contagious virus. That's works. ""are sacrifice people economy?""

Maybe Canada, that's American way. Ok, thread talking America, lost jobs pandemic asked could get extra time pay rent/bills referred essential pay-day loans. gotten $600 week plus unemployment would evicted April. laws US protects people situation companies/landlords allow delay payments. Odd. live McMansion area town. wear masks. go local store everyone masked. Outside store little shopping center, everyone masked (yeah, even outside). walk without mask 20 feet little old Asian lady, glares. I'm 20 feet away, lady, chill. 

You go four miles ""normal"" area go QFC Safeway 75% mask wearing. matter color ethnicity. drug store pretty good, grocery stores less likely, outside may may (on sidewalks outside stores, general outside).

I'm outside Seattle, WA. US always beacon hope world since end WWII. sad state affairs right now. I'm glad neighbor north well though. okay thanos barely used ship brah 3 months actually yea surreal still sick covid many back work since yet, see everywhere people wearing mask, brainwashed either politics, social media, constitution (only affected part them) fuck swing voter opportunity redeem himself

How would undone massive amount awful things he’s done?  Y’all don’t realize government abuse power right?? new ""Hillary jail""? News flash: shitload people died NY. difference residents eventually took seriously, Cuomo led charge that. NY hit hardest FIRST - information base response from, yeah, tragic amount people paid ultimate price. That's even disgusting asshole governors south completely ignoring went wrong NY, since reigned in. sustained downward trend NY now, Cuomo deserves medal uniting many people work towards goal, put aside personal opinions differences. certainly get tv tell people ""we know nursing homes high risk environments, we're going make sure open public, discourage masks, also serve food there"", exactly played TX, FL, others. 1.8 million enough get social distancing place classroom. Good point. I’m sure enough redemsivir given out, plasma probably helping putting people stomachs also helping.

But think primary factor drop average age - folks saying screw social distancing 50.  people ""educated"" imbecility. might help - also 2yo we're sending back daycare next week. Tulare County report anything May 22, 2020:** Tulare County Health &amp; Human Services Agency reporting COVID-19 updates Monday – Friday, excluding holidays. includes COVID-19 cases updates, death counts, recovered counts, quarantine counts, mapping updates. County Public Health Lab, contact tracing investigations, COVID-19 testing operations continue daily; reports issued normal business hours. 

 Ur chances good u made d19 w/o hospital. people saw hospital deteriorated around d9/10 early disease. Best wishes you. BLM protests? Willing say thing? Thank serious question.  point is/was cases importantly mortality rate 'spinning control' article suggests.  Data shows closures, lockdowns panic warranted time. take issue media trying keep us scared, anxious worst fighting amongst ourselves...which observed sub trying help alleviate. Thanks. mean, yeah? That's kind unimpeachably true statement I'm little confused everyone else confused true statement..... major cities 14 straight days decreased cases actually allowed kind ""re-opening"" first place?? Lol “protesters held signs saying masks cant stop virus”. That’s literally they’re designed like China? new Beijing outbreak? That's thinking too. keep sickness down. money productivity win businesses, safety win schools hospitals. things like public health could create whole new industries jobs. yeah understand, definitely calling comments deleted. I'm speechless, people rally idea happening AZ? 65% people probably job security, government jobs, government pensions somehow otherwise living dole. 35% need get back work. people would worn masks would fine. even socially distance Asia high population density.

The fucking Surgeon General literally told us masks useless save healthcare professionals cloth masks wold worked fine save N95 masks healthcare professionals. like try pull people offering good solutions yourself. Actually, hate it. What’s stopping now? Simple solution ""pandemic."" go outside protest/riot zero social distancing. Hey, media never seemed bring tiny conundrum. Agreed, people getting haircuts. Folks got bills pay. None measures used China used Belarus 362 Covid deaths. 

So, authoritarian regime think telling truth? 

Go ahead choose one, live bliss. You’re advocating funnel money people maintain asset prices . 

I mean we’re going pay people 1K week sit home chill without responsibilities I’d like sign . 

Society can’t work long term fashion. Toilet paper readily available like month everyone mother masks sale. Stop pushing bullshit. Hyderabad even worse. testing even getting 33% positive. referring state whole. perfect metric means justify magnitude difference. pointed out. 

* flag never used wearing apparel, bedding, drapery. (section 8d)
* embroidered articles cushions handkerchiefs like (section 8i)
* \[It be\] printed otherwise impressed paper napkins boxes (section 8i)
* flag never placed upon it, part it, attached mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, drawing nature. (section 8g)
* part flag ever used costume athletic uniform. (section 8j)

hypocrite people state, luckily county. Yeah, going make difference since last ten people said fucking shit impact guy, testimonial going fall next round deaf ears ""didn't know serious.""

Because there's way could have. base get elected though, swing voters like others. opportunity redeem he's done opposite. base always going vote matter says does. Salt earth. Y’know, morons. preferred temperature places 15 degrees Celsius, perfect temperature virus. goddamn idiots going kill us all. mean if? TX AZ pretty spikey! Florida. took convince them? Fox News helluva drug. think people assisted encouragement DT Whitehouse? intelligent administration laying boundaries proper informed fashion,there would end people obeying would thought? Like choice. watched latest Peak Prosperity video COVID, Dr. Martenson fantastic get go thing. He’s saying rise protests, thinks be, seeing window week 2nd week July. 

I kind surprised figured 2ish week window started seeing cases roll in, it’s really like month. Others pointed well, keep mind it’s people protests spread on. Hence takes time real numbers traced back given event come in. easy, watch fox news hate pessimist, South West experiencing massive surge cases I'd shocked death toll 180K October. IMHE estimates consistently low. 200K October. next 2 weeks really tell us summer trajectory. big downside representative democracy. elect leaders, get leaders good getting elected necessarily anything else. That’s EU. I’m lucky enough work home, girlfriend lives works home too. us, isn’t big change stay mostly isolated vaccine, basically means cutting social activities big groups people. 

We aren’t sitting inside bomb shelter totally cut world though. go stores taking standard precautions. We’ve seen parents, done backyard social distancing visits one two friends live nearby equally careful, everyone wearing masks staying far apart. 

If keep isn’t going hard. Sure, monotonous times, it’s better getting really sick there’s chance downside effects permanent. US supported citizens. federal government gave monthly boost unemployment alongside $1200-2400 stimulus checks. 

it states see fit lock efficiently

you can't stay locked whole year, people get agitated care less. enforce anything cops shit, people hate cops?

not mention economic destruction. scientist, stay Holiday Inn last night. damn good news. basically November election results means patient demographics shifting younger better treatments now. matter diligent science.   bad Trump never will, always doubles never changes mind admits wrong. 

I can’t think time admitted wrong said sorry. Lol americas cases ever anything spike? trumpski's self destructing? Keep mouth shut Joe win going away. Yep, bullshit. either return work get terminated job. Work people work hospital without mask. might change mind. even boast Hyderabad's numbers reaching good 1000 day. state fucked honestly blame goes government. think get March/April bad October/November. I'm sure we'll see jump reopening keep mind, south, summer months people actually indoors due heat whereas MI largely outdoors heat rarely unmanageable Bc man madeeeeeee Here’s clear example need funding education pay/supply teachers better. ridiculous people sound like fools. It’s heartbreaking really. Exactly, desperation move. He's leader. Hey man, meant reply someone ended replying post necessarily. people tested traveling, playing sports procedure hospital. spoke client today tested three times heart procedure unrelated COVID. people also tested exposed someone tested positive. also regularly testing nursing home prison staff residents areas. business outbreak (like meat packing plant) sometimes test everyone. Many states also tracking tracing cases, theory test anyone person sustained contact with. Oh, mean 'illegal use flag' ties worn self-proclaimed 'patriots' (read Trumpwaffen losers)? flag ties? Lubbock seeing biggest spike since started. already passed biggest peak twofold.

65% cases people 20-29.

Most recorded cases exposure bars restaurants.

And students gone right now. Stockholm that's like 90% population. Everyone think might it. personally know opted yet mostly Work-From-Home Low-risk shielded office-workers, high-risk people can't work home living areas highest concentration deaths.

The Swedish CDC even tried targeted study Rinkeby, area highest mortality/population. basically interest area. mean, far accuse govt accurately representing numbers, haphazard testing is, huge sudden drop realm possibility. saw crazy testing line videos number drop may that. None good course, particular aspect may malicious itself, result malicious inaction. rabies vaccine useful shortly someone bitten. takes infection spread bite site brain. reaches brain, patient doomed. Covid 19 infection faster spreading within body rabies. wear mask.

I'm happy wear mask I'm visiting grandma (well, still can't even that, regardless wear).

I'd happy wear mask I'm ill, came contact someone ill.

I absolutely fight law mandate requires wear mask threat fines imprisonment. That's fas cis shit, America, get suspend constitution glorified sniffles, sorry sorry.

I wear mask I'm outside, period. I'd rather arrested comply au tho ritari dictates. Professional college athletes testing positive left right? don’t see leagues US start restart season. Staying home helps much share household someone doesn't. quarantine want, still live essential worker. Household spread widely observed lockdown Wuhan, surprising happened NYC.

I'm sure continuing argue this? point we've achieved sort herd immunity, demonstrably false. also arguing shutdowns ""didn't anything,"" also demonstrably false. I'm economist, evidence UBI would beneficial? predict unsustainable surge capacity 12 days, realistically people going beds already could weld every resident house Wuhan style really matter point. Every action taken, whether good bad, 2-3 week lag shows data.

If projections say shit going bad 12 days, probably late anything build additional surge capacity. 🤣...no seriously 😑 marine vet, yes kept lockdown going another 3-4 weeks, situation would much control. nope, reopen state soon possible economy important. 

It shows weak Abbott leader dealing historic virus pandemic short sighted everyone charge TX been. Trump telling truth once. wasn’t kidding said slow testing. 

Exhibit plans it.  article also year old. situation changed dramatically since COVID-19 recent Trump admin announcement clampdown immigration. 

Let's suppose talented global tech worker, option move US Canada:

1) United States - visa process hit miss. literally tied company like slave guarantee get green card. pro side wage high 

2) Canada - Express Entry system even need job waiting period six months less. get permanent residency straightway 3 years apply citizenship. Free healthcare COVID-19 control. con side wages lower Silicon Valley. actually get minimum 133+600, 733 per week. Actually closer $3000 per month. Trump wants country sick vote November.  wish get point hospitals strained people risk dying enforce point basic courtesy towards others. Legality morality two different things. Cops legally mandated kill people, even though humans agree murder immoral.

Cops required enforce morality, times contravene morality. makes immoral institution. Even military internally mandated disobey order wrong. Cops not.

Besides that, people want cops large bullies enjoy hurting people power comes carte-blanche mandate so. Sorry, point life I'm longer interested hearing ""not cops bad."" matter they're not. boys girls blue still executing people streets. So.....them. states fucked stop fucking making excuses violence, Christ.

 mentality problem. think east coast cases dampened behavior though.

By looks southern states completely unhinged response social behaviors completely perfect spread continue.

At least east coast states hit- especially MD/NJ/NY/CT mask wearing common. Also leadership seems amiable early measures. suppose care idiots willingly? avoiding deaths overburdened hospitals goal (they are), yes. interrelated though. Hospitalizations trending wrong direction several places, average age infection (a good thing), unlikely stay way long virus continues increase rate spread.

I appreciate headlines present facts without context. nothing add sense futility, spurs inaction extension. Tell Florida, Texas co. late they're inevitably headed towards NY situation regardless point, they're likely throw hands air proudly declare ""fuck it.""

I like that. late places act. keep saying cannot underestimate potential consequences huge unemployment numbers. Worst case scenario adds lot civil unrest.

Unemployment + Tanked economy + Civil unrest + Terrible leadership = God knows That’s test people died due cardiac arrest Covid.

Edit: un-accounted-for rise cardiac deaths implies extra Covid deaths aren’t counted. think problem really know many people getting recovering home without tracked counted official stats. data generally going come sicker proportion people it, probably good overall since expect long term effects less common less severe cases. think good estimate unfortunately. X 20 would closer mark, everyone tested countries conservative truth. awful disease repercussions we'll learning many years. That's true people try? Like go get haircut, remove mask get beard trimmed too. wear mask, take I'm chair, put back I'm done. 

Doing right time much better never can't right time. Fortunately imagine much longer. Fuck, too. feel like I'm stage need start journaling again. remember feeling started March. No, two different types quarantines. Cuomo upset March cause president discussing closing actual state borders.

Cuomo talking quarantining individuals arrive highly infected states. He's talking closing borders. similar number states done already including Florida Maine. he's closing borders. virus going away another teen died Florida it. really need demand schools stay closed 2020-21 school year protect children. Please contact elected officials demand this. all, schools breading grounds germs virus run rampart throughout them. really want risk children's lives this? Plus, even contract virus asymptomatic, go home could infect family members. really want increase chance parents grandparents contracting virus too? Also didn’t Cuomo flip states threatening NYC outbreak? fact said would “Federal Declaration War” people get infected members sharing household. ""

Is actual official result New York?

I'm curious, reading r/COVID19, lately, studies coming suggesting household attack rate somewhere 15-30% window - actually small contagious virus. household attack rate low, account sustained ongoing transmission locked places NY Italy.....unless behind-the-scenes people still frequenting households along. Dallas isn’t far behind you. weekend, they’re hospitals we’re running 74% capacity hospital beds used 71% ICU beds used. I’m beyond frustrated Abbott handled virus. He’s putting politics people, it’s frustrating. advice whatever need keep healthy. city Fort Worth expected double amount cases within next month We're still discussing that. I'd like wear mask go quarantine family 10 days doesn't. probably wear mask he's cancer survivor high blood pressure virus could pretty bad him. Community spread hospitalizations worst among poor Hispanic black populations. Especially working plants farms shitty work living conditions. governors don’t care. kid likely die flu guess that’s ok? presumably sent school before, different? Covid new shiny? 

Living complete fear isn’t good, need cautious take reasonable steps protect yourself. hyperbolic doesn’t help you. statistic start showing percent filled ICU beds. Children’s hospitals states follow using overflows.  No, satisfy thrill get servant hour. like servants can't show fake smiles telling no. protest....duh. 
You can't catch sign. gonna get really bad people continuing lives normal!

it going break hospitals. :(  easy time Missouri, I've found others experience. barely qualify getting checks within day two weekly request. initial filing took less week. even messed accidentally said worked 0 hours one week still went (put savings pay back--they never responded email it, I'm wondering point employer let go reason).

But know university workers denied assumed work summer. I've heard people state still struggling find paid paying qualifying March. packed limited cups??????


What mean? feel Fremdschämen whole country?

I feel every time post. Disney opens like three weeks? Issue Houston we’re discovering average citizen idiot can’t trusted wear mask congregating (or even shopping). sadly mandatory requirements strict enforcement option keep spreading. Wish we’d done start. I’m sorry think that.  Yup. Nearly posts admonishing ""doomers"" playing angle anti-lockdown argument. Texas! saying decades, told exaggerating. open everyone see. Yeah. would've better enforce pricing discourages scalping (like 10dollars first 10 n95 masks, 80 another 10) stating importance masks reducing spread. well diy tips. also emphasis properly wear far many people sloppy. First player career ending long-term conditions going scare hell rest players.

They can't league one willing play. Uh huh...middle first wave totally never said true. I'm saying I'm glad counting cardiac death covid automatically. need skew numbers. data protests yet. UI 2400 month maddening. one goal (certainly flattening curve one). Getting hospitals prepared surges, stockpiling PPE importantly getting bunch better treatment protocols (including drug treatments) others. people accepting ""everyone get it"" mantra disaster. already looks like Americans banned EU Canada (and assume countries virus control). Well, US could use attitude germs right now. blame Abbott, increase significantly grew protests. probably combination, recognize allow society actually get this. protest, cost killing thousands. Arkansas Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   doubt say. Young people make money, carry insurance. 

Besides, that's system, it. Millions people paid social security medicare ever get out. That's way works. moms hospital south Florida 37 cases currently. entire floor entrances dedicated COVID. sure many beds total, grandma ICU hospital 10 beds wing in, assume nearing capacity.  Gee, would locked longer first time...had coordinated federal response..
Enforced quarantine, mask rules...contact tracing

Then, maybe even need discuss second lock down

But again...if aunt wheels would wagon agree.

Yet somehow security theater TSA checkpoints airports stopped brainwashed idiots since 9/11.

Containment never viable, strategy optimal mitigation real world conditions.

The tragedy commons, full effect. commons highway transportation system point. got tested last week results came back negative. question this: person conducting test swabbed around nostril 15 seconds. expected swab end much deeper. way testing process go? haven’t seen demonstration test procedure. Four years ago USA would leader western world stop pandemic tracks. Four years ago response team, executive leadership would led example, etc. would still obstruction time went on, early containment would far successful. Georgia too? work f&amp;b majority customers wear masks Well California one 50 states. live Nebraska currently zero faith anything even resembling ever mandated here, would assume thats states. 

Here Nebraska people see dont wear masks. would mandated, idiot Governor never even fully locked state. definitely wont force people wear masks. even told business owners recently wouldnt get federal COVID19 money required people wear masks. Fml mean state refused testing height outbreak? Bay Area lot protests, per capita numbers rising tandem rest state. We’re starting lower baseline though, we’re still ok. won’t long rate increase continues like is.  Wait til Russia China tries invade nation doughboys. no, heroic WWI doughboys, overweight, diabetes-ridden good ol' boys. Correlation equal causation. governor (LA) everything right, political pull pretty much forced end mandatory quarantine allow businesses reopen. slightly opened door allowed business people act like back normal. investigator study, Dr Katrina Pollock, added: ""I working trial feel cautiously optimistic see great immune response participants.

ehh cautiously optimistic want doctor be, directly related something injected me..I let everyone else fill better descriptive terms maybe "" completely convinced"" "" pessimistically overconfident"" I'm sorry cousin risk. hope makes zero incidents. important us take caution whether we're one risk not. Florida tries hide number. official dashboard daily reports give number cases attributed day, based day patient first showed symptoms, asymptomatic patient came tested.  official count yesterday adjusted next weeks, cases diagnosed test results finished. want report number new test results diagnosis issued, yesterday.

But Florida report ""total"" count, day, including increases previous days.  smart news reporters figured subtract yesterdays ""total"" todays ""total"".

I expect stop reporting ""total"", soon figure news reporters doing. ignore ""a months."" News broke virus late-December. locked Wuhan January 23. That's 1.5 months waiting -- likely ~28 days. lot local Wuhan officials suppressing information (they got fired btw). 


Agree disagree. never said America's take good, China help made worse. China actively hid information countries. Oh think people making decisions well aware. addressing reddit ""experts"" act like surgeries already shut weeks ago prepare pretend like elective surgeries plastic surgeries important procedures health

The situation trending towards becoming serious enough states agree, suspending medical procedures taken lightly public I'm reading, transmission rates surface person fairly low. think real danger transmission person person close proximity extended period. Live, robust virus droplets enough exposure create viral load. lights would kill surface contamination, leaving real danger people come back spaces. assumption correct? Oh... Maybe shoot UV lights body via narrow anal throat tube... mix up. 😂😂😂 (still laugh scene Idiocracy) 7/10? Please, Trump gets best women. 11/10 bust. bust course mean large boobs. non-compliance mascot cuts funding tests instead advocating mask usage would allow everyone get back work.  could Japan instead billowing conflagration infection. Remember people pissed Chinese exporting cases? sins far greater. IMO first, blatantly. like they're handing free masks everyone except poc. establishing rule good reason giving groups exception punishments following rule. 

There fair bit pushback social media POC around idea might treated heightened suspicion stores due institutional racism, hence forcing masks unfair them

Example man said would feel safe wearing mask -""a black man living world"". got 123,000 likes invite newspaper interview moments later**
Newspaper article spend lot time black Twitter uncommon perspective, many popular tweets talking masks general homemade masks 

Several petitions launched black community 

THAT policy place. nobody wants labelled racist/exclusionary. also provides exceptions disabled 

 latest long list reactionary / preemptive adjustments companies/governments order address concerns voiced black community labelled promoting systemic racism results significant bad PR 2020. People getting cancelled , called shamed daily basis. Nobody wants guy. 

Obviously everyone else looks quite absurd. pandemic certainly is. Still hilarious people saying decision intentional underhanded ploy harm POC.  cannot win. nothing = enabling profiling racism, cave demands = care black lives

All wear mask regardless skin color. obviously nonsense insane hey people campaign it. That's anything. Also Houstonian. I've thoughts seeing state country handled things. made lol, sad. Also, would likely budweiser miller, know kids. true, read actual article. leave house ever. order food groceries. 100% chance getting COVID. Checkmate.  polled. Bullshit poll. “Except guy called short made fun way face looks.” Exactly haha. left since late February. (Beyond walk around block.) groceries delivered, work remotely, see single family member (also isolating). 

I'll even smuggle frozen tamales.  Anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, people think solar panels part government mind-control conspiracy. ask know :( can't speak others, Arizona never quarantined anyone NY, NJ Conn. peak. Instead, dozens medical professionals went help out. 

NY, NJ Conn. returned favor. 

So yeah, thanks! Trump can’t get numbers till stops testing. He’s damn smart. I'm ""chang""? that? one paranoid people? Child, hilarious. Can't get anymore American okayyyyyyyyyyyy 124,000+ Americans dead there’s clear end solution sight. 

There plenty reasons afraid 4th largest city America trajectory run ICU beds soon one them. different demographics getting infected

we know this. different demographics confirmed cases. testing severely restricted last big increase cases. best comment. I’m stealing it. Lol seem misunderstood. said know similar numbers, whatever actual levels are, since kinds tests used.

Ie. may know 5 50%, know 5 50%.

It's called sampling.  office job forced us come back literally reason. thing desk home, dif instead phone calls people take regular meetings Florida Man confirm Oct-April/May outdoors every chance get June-September try avoid going outside minutes time. European countries planning extend unemployment early 2021 covid effectively gone there, after-effects brutal. places 50% unemployment.  people decision making positions making choices based partisan politics, facts evidence.

If actually cared science, would partial lockdown high risk individuals near 100% quarantine, everyone else takes precautions like social distancing masks otherwise goes life. Basic income everyone, rent mortgage freezes, government “get work programs” infrastructure whatever everyone wants job get one, socialized healthcare, etc.

Sadly, people care elections people govern. Canada 10% population US has. ""masks mind control psyop"" bullshit saying.

All cloth covering face.... Dafuq? Yes, totally trust numbers.

And no, 100% open. Ok provides state-by-state estimates Effective Reproduction good contextualizing testing numbers also providing 7-day moving average positive tests percentages.

Take look two worrying metrics there, number daily positive tests seeing sustained increase **and** percentage positive tests increasing even number tests administer interesting graph too, seeing increase positive cases massive increase percentage positive tests, logical outcome strategy increasing testing. 13%, believe Dr. Fauci said optimal positive test rate closer 10%. 10% positive test rates probably testing ""enough"" get realistic picture bad things are, less could over-testing (wasting resources) probably under-testing missing lot sick people.

The first site pretty good tool for, ""which states risk spread"" second site pretty good tool contextualizing understanding what's going one state.

Hope helps.  Overall Michigan pretty well. Here's latest charts. Note declines 7-day cases deaths:

 robust social safety net important. y’know, government cares much precious corporations. Bro Florida guy come Miami go bar here, knowing it, wanted say bye friends one last time left University good. Thankfully roommate, went bar, tested negative week went. lot people testing positive. like wtf. classic dickish human behavior, lot people called it: nothing happens, get lot assholes coming woodwork saying, ""psh, even bad, totally overreacted"" - without understanding bad precisely *because* ""overreacted.""

I'm seeing much San Diego. Even frontline healthcare taking seriously beds open, they've lose shifts hospital activity. Karen circus 🎪 town I’m Long Island feeling safe. It’s mini Trump land - lots mask non-believers. great cases.

It amazing story NY among beat country, NY plan based CDC guidelines. rest country followed plan, accelerated schedule cases allowed it, wouldn’t perpetual mess course right, mean suggest problem squarely fell young people's Shoulders!! literally tell difference hes high mind stimulants he's not. Money, dude. Always money. ""I'm stopping elective surgeries to"" costs lot run hospital that's making money. 
 
I think dont want even take chance stopping ES chance forced stop, lost months income. 
 
I'm advocating sympathizing, think hospitals hung money always put profit public safety (those control purse strings is, front line workers). evidence social media platforms merely private companies intrinsically linked daily societal systemic functions Costco. start trend upwards said decline though. Odd cannot seem see that. going end regretting missing brothers wedding. real. dad sounds educated. people politicizing masks received worst public education world evidently “if”, it’s “when”

Also “remain lockdown “ Deaths bit lower days, biggest number new cases aside day 55k system bugged states report properly 19 years 1939... anti doomers outside enjoying lives.

The doomers still pretending Covid 19 serious virus. Dan Marino die gonorrhea rot hell. saddest part majority U.S. citizens rightfully rapid reopening

No aren't, talking ass. believe something mean majority do. Someones rude awakening studies polls work  hard believe people line ideologically comes politics? survey include everybody wearing face masks option. Given three options: 1) nothing, 2) go back lockdown, 3) everybody wear face masks, #3 sure seems like attractive option me. FR tho wearing mask absolutely inform nasty breath.

Source: one time wearing mask noticed nasty breath, realized mask way would known that. Here's current 7-day average deaths US:

 map showing per capita deaths county:

 population 100% tested test reliability 99% better?  Agree takeaway appears CNN sucks. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nobody saw coming, one. ""if"" coronavirus cases spike? Uhh....got news ya....and ain't good...  But... really much money unemployment infrastructure always ready like one three people claim week?

That's per century emergency. ready every day would cost gigantic fortune every state. Actually certain tribe small hats ones truly running things globally fact.  China literally prefer Trump. short term bungles hurt Chinese economy, long-term damage US alliances compensates.

Xi worry election cycles, afford long game. That's really good way say. protests mostly young people many people give fuck getting tested.

What likely happened passed other's testing positive. It’s ok. Bezos fire hire more. 
No liability... yep, people bias here. agree US compliance general selfishness allow burn here, speaking ideals really. Btw wearing gas mask? can't take credit this, someone smarter posted something along lines highest levels government lead, *they failed follow*.

If U.S. even mimicking worked elsewhere, situation would improving. questioned fauci's comment article referencing nothing n95. context. wouldn’t. simply can’t impose control required country geographically large populous. soon one person it’s pretty much game unless they’re quarantined right away. Unless think damn near every country world dumbass government. Cause Europe didn’t great either man. Noohmygod Lol life bleak. Optimists exist. Exactly. mother lung disease works closely public (for essential business work home option). got stop working day everyone raided stores toilet paper point without income. company SUPER AWESOME longer needed giving extra pay everyone bit extra compromised immune systems able get pay lot longer most. 

That's done. We're also Texas near Austin we're seeing nice big spike cases. options stay home pay go work potentially catch disease almost certainly kill her. tell qualify unemployment wants remain employed hopefully go back work (she planning going back weeks ago right cases starting skyrocket again).

It's shit that's come stay home make money go get illness kill (and again, would likely 97% survive even seems she'd long term issues coming anyways). Trump spreads bullshit, supporters eat up.  new nickname Tennis subreddit. catching ton flack first promoting ""your emotions energy change chemical structure water"" instagram lives shaman friend, statements anti vaccination want pro tennis tour require vaccination play events, wife promoting 5g causes COVID conspiracy. hosting tennis tour basically zero precautions taken videos players dancing partying club. reputation taken massive hit this.......His dad also recently blamed first player dest positive, dimitrov, saying something like ""Dimitrov hurt nation family, came tournament sick knows where, even get tested Serbia, fair did"" something like that. really make sense.....his son invited bunch people come play tennis gather large groups precautions mad someone came ended sick pandemic? nature projections change events. 

70,000 dead could seem like reasonable virus toll. factor human political events, like opening early, huge numbers wearing masks, change projection based contagious virus is.

These projections rocket science, maths. Calculate fast spreads, get idea much people get it, calculate much people infected die %. That's get projections like 70K. 

But (and can't) account human factor. 100% reopened quite time now. also compared 265 active cases 1,453,382 active cases. really needs reddit-wide rule automoderators banned. never get right. course articles don't, MSM literally telling people protests fine gatherings 10+ people bad. 90 people long there's BLM signs, would fine?

I wonder how'd it'd go instead signs saying BLM protesting anti-police violence. Based Canadian friends said, answer question ""absolutely not."" get it, live state great hit hard first (not NY another northeastern state) really want people state coming right now. live one states getting hit hard right truth nobody cares. Restaurants bars packed max, people large gatherings, large portion still wearing masks despite “required” Every single politician willfully contributed deaths 120,000+ Americans counting ignoring science health officials, ignoring intelligence reports, spreading straight lies, suppressing important information, politicizing lifesaving items practices, attempting profit pandemic needs held accountable. 

If American, would accept nothing less jail time sociopaths. Hospital CEOs administrators ready surge. Anybody talk nurses doctors hospitals? sustainable surge mean? expectations quality care staffing ratios ICU patients? long unsustainable last for? Doubling already surged staff. 

Once again, everyone looking raw ventilator bed numbers. Never hear anything nurses, respiratory therapists, ICU docs, pharmacists name important staff ICU patients. medication supplies? Like sedation, paralytics, pressors? 

I willing bet ICU nurses docs limiting factor this. take 1-2 icu patients normally sustainable surge double I'm looking 3 4. unsustainable surge 6 8. Obviously one nurse can't everything patients non-ICU nurses monitoring helping ICU patients. giving lot nurses crash courses ICU. Either way cut it, unsafe result mistakes. stretch staff (read: human beings) double quadruple thier typical patient load bad news. mistakes, injuries, deaths due lower quality care monitoring. 

And kicker. COVID patients quickly become sickest patients floor. Proned, paralyzed, sedated, anticoagulated, dialysis ECMO.

Those hospital administrators might ""run numbers"" weakest link going core staff run thier limit. That's system breaks. Here's North Carolina latest case/death chart, running averages:

 still really bad, Florida changed time they’re reporting. counting 10am-10am, they’re midnight midnight. changed yesterday. yesterday’s count artificially low since 10am-midnight, today’s little inflated. said, average two days around 4500. It’s good. 

The good news report ready morning instead sometime early afternoon. 

For anyone curious, 251 new hospitalizations according Tampa Bay Times.  35* degree biochemistry use. sounds like damn good news. PRC didnt fudge numbers anyone else, CCP bosses know cannot afford another loss face like SARS 1. SARS PR disaster learned it. Ppl confuse CCP Soviet Union. CCP totalitarian able learn adapt. Thats reason theyre still power.

In contrast Western bias propaganda PRC deals transparently issue u consider standards.

Also RoK, RoC, JP, NZ, AUS, Thailand, Vietnam, Germany, Slovakia Baltic states must also fudge numbers then.

OR

Sweden wrong

(Which totally cannot be...) activities increase chances getting covid

1) chance (outdoors, masks) vs. bunch time indoors someone touching you. 

2) one way important other. 

3) screw trying act like similar. horrible horrible thing pushing. wtf wrong you? That's exactly agreeing went explaining. ""To point..."" 😂

But skin means Vitamin enter body. also enter via mouth. means 1 independent variable - ""Vitamin Mouth"", another independent variable, ""Skin Pigmentation"", another indirect variable ""Systemic Racism"" (more clarification/specificity needed...), means isolated control variables able indicate extent Skin Pigmentation **alone** affects CFR America!

We isolated control variables affect Vitamin D, able make case either **for against** argument.

To able assert CFR either completely explained differences Vitamin D, need control Vitamin D, MEASURING fatalities!

That's said ""more testing needed."". case absolutely closed yet. real estate agent know told city 20,000 evictions pending right now. definitely hard times. keep conversation, keep using push progressive economic model, maybe year's time we'll better before. market always bounces back. humans keep combatting things like virus best to, less, win. nobody ever wants look actual problem. virus isnt main problem, everything else nobody ever wants acknowledge. human race dumb. ""empathy"" devise ways prolong life, cure sicknesses etc. nobody stops think size population(s). sit enjoy capable of, planes, technology, giant cities, still remain completely oblivious weakness. not, anything man made strongest thing planet, never be. people sit gripe wears mask doesn't, comical nobody ever said, ""hey, never populated areas around gulf Mexico, yearly hurricanes take everything away many people"". that's population issue, people cant bothered population issues. keep robbing land planet build giant cities. Itll ok agro land gets smaller smaller, figured genetically modify food grow bigger feed everyone. Exactly this, would submit ""people"" this, minority party seized control government implemented anti-science regime. going get hundreds thousands people killed. Kicking motherfuckers office might actually best thing coronavirus. Good people wherever live. area everyone selfish twat. Yeah, that’s point. Everyone scared talk act, take stand often retreat slightest sign criticism backlash. sure things work, looking pretty ugly. reason many big tech companies go Ireland corporate tax rate 12.5%. anything immigration policies workers rights, money per usual. also depends accommodations specific area. huge beach full people still socially distance works okay beach dingy bathrooms everyone going frenzy inside. 

My local beach closed ton people freaking (Cuz muh freedums...), fail realize beaches access point building proper ventilation, rarely cleaned, one set bathrooms. ""Fall"" another word autumn season. Flu comes fall compound things. Good. also exposed smell infected person's sh*t fart. Idk that. live metro Detroit whenever go grocery store, think 90 % people mask on. 

I past weekend restaurant 50% people mask on. 

I’ve working home, I’m sure people work feeling part flaws hear? compared New York covid patients alone accounted 100% ICU capacity

Got source that? Cause BS. handful hospitals ICU capacity issues (with spare ICU capacity available nearby, New York keeps opening, give two months thing stops looking like Texas small degree herd immunity got first wave.

Blood tests severely underestimate number infected. NYC likely herd immunity already.  Georgia would like word Yes. gonna hot mess. either racist offended racist offended, maybe racist apathetic all. There's got expert consult somewhere. US witness second wave actually looks like.  I'd say they've depressingly successful. Tough way whole office find hes intimate wife lol, bad got accepted teach english france starting october 7 months. part keen leave USA, clearly screwed far covid goes. however, part super worried either family getting sick abroad, quarantine alone france becoming lonely, able experience program like would without pandemic (i.e. travel restrictions countries EU work restrictions classroom - big reason applying could travel countries near france teaching). i'm looking someones unbiased advice decision must make soon Or, know, maybe take ferry? NY Anyone wanna adopt country???? I’m ashamed American, country really digging grave, know nothing new seems it’s getting worse I’m afraid raise family America. I'd like lop Florida let sink Atlantic love call conservative though makes point you. I'm US conservative, I'm German. government let states handle response.

Maybe federal government helped logistics tests, state governments failed hard matter anyways. Do. not. try.



-Yoda. Probably believe every study see, especially pushing group think shaming compliance. Zoom meetings time being. virus give shit argument is

""Noooo cant infect me!!! Im children!!"" much prefer coastline city, Chicago pretty great cold shit half year. wish could've spent time there.

Reactions around  person spreading misinformation Never underestimate depth criminality depravity. infrared screens door building. patient fever. Rechecked oral 20 mins later, one. contactless thermometers accurate.  Indoors hopefully. Florida  Houston.

Americans definitely conformists individualists. That's easy Fox news control them. physician told timing flu vaccine still Oct flu peak still early March. Existence COVID-19 affect influenza peak. Yes enough testing rates likely higher numbers say, fact Europe gotten mostly control now, enough feel safe slowly opening back up. also fact US slowly opening back despite fact states seen highest rates infection week. Also fact EU feels situation US still bad enough make one three countries banned travel EU. 

I feel like trying imply US currently handling things better EU EU justified banning US, thinking conspiracy theory facts say otherwise. Statement 1: Human human transmission scientifically confirmed


Statement 2: virus spread ppl


Only highschool dropouts equate Statement 1 Statement 2


No, millionth time, Dr. Wenliang Li arrested, called local police station spent 1 hour signing form, acknowledging wrong claim virus SARS. That's China informed regarding virus. time, China faced virus may may transmit ppl, may may legal, could well ""just flu"". absolutely wrong claim SARS scares ppl. Furthernore eye doctor released patient's test result... even patient.


Wuhan government incompetent. leaders refused pay serious attention local CDC folks. CDC folks reluctant put careers line (e.g., doubling swear bosses thing legit) -- also know whether something serious not. end, Wuhan leaders fired Feb. wrong. find funny westerners put high standard Chinese governments -- allowed make mistakes. Yet ppl lenient governments. measures NY taking April early May I'm planning emulate. 

Stay home, socially distance, wear mask outside potential coming across people. friend posting parties living normal life got positive result San Antonio today. Stay safe. Imagine Trump cut PSA.

&amp;#x200B;

Why happen??? pro-no mask crowd bout get covid dust lungs 🤦🏻‍♂️ Except none controlled government. Yes people value privacy comes government knowing US here, wouldn’t let us either. husband spent 2 weeks Sydney job 2018, looking come fall. barely leaving house. mask-wearers since Day 1, far, good us. don’t think international travel pick 2022, personally. worst part even means, countries won’t even allow coming US country. we’re stuck shithole without reprieve. Thanks Donald company. not? illness short term thing, players miss time injuries quite regularly. Missing 2-3 weeks COVID different. South Carolina curving upwards Baaaaaaaaaaah sending nursing home patients back nursing homes still sick. addition, could simply much younger healthier demographic getting sick. Plus treatments definitely improved. Fuck it, political system shambles, might well let go shit rebuild ashes. flu going go away ever.  even vaccines.  wearing masks interacting rest time? No. No, late May, Sweden's overall COVID-19 mortality rate estimated 39.57 deaths per 100,000 residents; time, U.S. mortality rate estimated 30.02 deaths per 100,000 residents, according Norway Finland, bordering Sweden, instituted stricter lockdown measures neighboring country, time, fewer six COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 residents.  even difficult breath pine box, 6 feet underground. “Will be?”  Nearly 75% cases NON-Covid19 positive tho.

It's OPs link look it. 

[Here Yeah doesnt matter ICU fills up, full full fucked. Cuomo said Port Authority giving officials access records. would cover passengers coming airports well vehicles using toll bridges tunnels. excuse people responsible. Everyone know tested outside hospital, e.g. drive testing, wait minimum 7 days results. numbers likely week behind. 
The FDA last week gave ""okay"" batch testing, seen difference turn around time yet. meant Connecticut, New York State, New Jersey. expected least use form empirical real world example mathematical conjecture extrapolation. What's thing Tesla talked scientists eventually look papers models formulae look windows see what's actually happening. need practicality ever. wrong thread, sorry. application systems overwhelmed problems qualifying. Sooo Chinese vaccine get cleared final testing China? Sign Chinese vaccine /s Nothing see here, move along comrade. would department want share name bar. know faster people trace back possibly infected. Fuck “the department” disinformation. fine. Washington State here, want us build wall Idaho California pay it. Oregon stay Pacifica, they’re fine. thing suffering depressing it, cepu, depressed etc such, any. things depressed things, others   wonder time short Dow again... [Same can't believe well handled this, Slovak living US, super jealous, US dropped ball. matter pessimistic become, find never able actually undershoot reality. pessimism restricted plausible negative, reality constrained possible negative. doubt contributing factor. Protests NY DC massive ongoing seen rise cases. anything daily new case count lower back May. We're 3-4 weeks beginning protests rise far I'm aware. even bump.

The one place could argue would Los Angeles. Yay, go indiana...its kinda zig-zag thing we'll good day go back up, super bad like Apirl people need able perform essential activities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your personal freedoms go way impede someone else's. So, case, freedom go die coronavirus stops point putting others risk also need go grocery shopping pick prescriptions. requiring New Yorkers guarantee travel within state, since well, NY still highest amount cases? responded wrong person, believe. agree said. I'd perfectly happy staying home locking indefinitely federal government would subsidize, aren't. People sub understand that, reopening way save lives point. Wear mask Got news, Mr. Mathis, going away masks either. probably one Christians think Catholics devil Christian. required masks two weeks ago? blast past Walmart yesterday, Fratboy line ahead without mask, talking storm, laughing, maintaining distance etc., spit garbage aisle next us.

I nearly stroke. new narrative increase people came elective surgeries tested positive hospital counted covid hospitalizations.

That's... much better lmao.  also pointed Texas childrens hospital go child care, open adults. see county numbers day day basis? “At beginning May 1 million positive cases 6 million tests done. 2.3 million positive cases 28 million tests done. rate positivity dropped enormously time. 5x tests got 2.3x cases.” wish Mass would join this. Instead, we’ve got billboards pike elsewhere politely asking ppl state quarantine 14 days. neighbor grad party, girl state growing infections came visit 4 sick. 40 years nothing... compared 1918's spanish flu. California pretty liberal state no? idea spread bad compared places ended much social distancing measures? Yup like flu. suggestion - acknowledge things beyond control, examine choices *can* make, act. 

If job concerning, consider quitting. willing consequences (financial, etc), examine work space. Distance best can, use sanitizer frequently, etc.

But can't eliminate risk - reduce it, understand may become ill - ok that. Life sometimes picking least shitty path available you, best can. 

No need stressed things change anyway, right? 😁👍 Yeah picked his/her response. responses helped paint clearer picture thank you. Sorry, yeah, error number. implies COVID-19 somehow transmitted protests riots. nuance title all. Maybe desperate push point view? I'm curious, wipe groceries got them?

Trying think could gotten it.... incubation period basis argument much stand lol.

SARS2 also exceptionally long incubation period. compile collection stories people taking COVID-19 seriously thinking fake becoming infected? shame anyone anything, give people something look consider thinking can't effect either. Lying murderers. course they'll get scott free gutters run red blood innocent. po-po? One possibility keep mind there's subset Canadians living US who, given everything going last years, culminating current colossal tire-fire, decided they've enough moved back home, submitted federal provincial self-isolation plans, quarantined responsibly, yet finished vehicle reimportation paperwork got new plates, pretty time-consuming even normal conditions.

I say someone island took dream job California, who's considered precisely many-a-time, including calling BC health info line Canadian consulate responsibly. know couple cases Americans sneaking Banff, etc. ""on way Alaska"" I'd encourage everyone assume best rather worst see non-local plate.

That said, case, given ugly New Jersey plates are, swapping BC plates ASAP practically criminal nature. WV couple community outbreaks people travelling Myrtle beach couple weeks ago so... think left. Though I'm sure part east coast talking. Fellow rational human... er, mean, ""shitposter,"" salute you. Wait, 1 3 people tested positive COVID? April 2020 NY scary, run hills scary, zombie movie scary, shit control scary. good thing live we'd isolating even harder .... Ya fuck EU. EU doesn’t even believe borders. Remember EU bitched Trump shutting travel EU? do. media lie want. Reality doesn’t lie. No, covid spreading TX residents morons. Dont feel bad. Everywhere DFW see people getting inside personal bubbles (let alone within arbitrary 6ft marker), masks, going around massive groups, partying, etc.

That Gov Abbott LtGov Patdick. That's avg joe TXN moron think second lockdown would destroy world know it. Entire industries cease exist, amount money would fix demand destruction occur. world see spiraling government debt increasingly countries isolate economies culture one another.

I think worth it, mounting evidence strains going around less deadly even month ago, always seems happen respiratory viruses.

From experience seasonal flu, clear vaccine bulletproof solution fast respiratory viruses mutate.

The thing think mandate mask wearing State Federal level, government purchase masks distribute populace. Haha expect deaths overall decrease. graphs trash, Californian still concerning lax mindset surrounding virus. appreciate well wishes side planet. Idk it’s genuinely nice hear. happens half country thinks reality tv star, bigot, misogynist would make fine president. Glad hear home done well! People would rather they, family continue live? That's get social distancing. Sorry think might crossed wire here. mentioned African Americans particular due existing social unrest Black Lives Matter movement. Careening one social catastrophe another bound cause worse problems.   helps, thank you. response question understand statement now. Henry Barron. like old corporate America adage ""Privatize profit, socialize losses."" except guns. ""Socialize consequences, privatize bloodthirst."" ""Reopen Economy"" zealots there, happens medical system major US city collapses.

Do still drive work knowing anything minor car accident could become deadly due lack medical care?

Do workers still climb roofs knowing slip fall could go untreated causing complications serious life-changing injury.

How many activities seem safe enough right 911 call away care become risky?

Failed medical systems scary people need right triaged, terrifying makes everyday things dangerous. luxury right alive time suffer pretty severe accidental injury alright, medical system sitting waiting put back together. goes away, I'm sure people react. mean duh help. focus China? virus started America dozen countries world would probably far worse off. Fun fact, 1918 pandemic start America, killed many ppl Spain got named Spanish Flu.

I get constant beat China countries around world acted worse. focusing national failures times like rather shifting blame nations oceans away us? like florida dead man rate Nah something happens make movie covers online searches like ""Disney frozen"" (kind joking) 

Edit: replied wrong guy double numbers considering told test? allot sick people like beat meat. It’s enough time us roll vaccine  Shit NOBODY commenting fact 70% filled NON-COVID PATIENTS?

BUT also misleading. 

They said 97% base ICU capacity full. 
27% Covid19+ 
70% Covid19-

And that's give. actually gross numbers get glimpse percentage total patients. 

SO  
27%/97% = 27.835% = Covid19+ 
70%/97% = 72.165% = Covid19-

It's right table provided!!!

That provide MUCH different, much accurate, picture headline implies. Maybe government buy loans risk default allow payments postponed reduced pandemic. Also individuals getting influx cash much spent, let businesses run curbside pickups still bring money, UBI make sure people money spend. 65% Americans want trump, look still got. cases, chances kids dying.  Definitely hundreds thousands millions people prostesting. care becomes texans. They're arrogant dullards Germany left states fine. Trump left states dropped ball. What?! thing even majority Americans soul searching, make sacrifice change way life, it’s undone weakest links community. didn’t spend three, almost four months studio apartment people could flood local bars right opened. Anyone idea moving one US state another gonna look like couple months? I'm moving WI MN late August school.  People getting hung gouping Americans, right understand Americans disagreeing you. Everybody knows wnat absolute individualism go US. Sadly nations collection individuals community, US struggling badly. actually surprised many states reacted swiftly beginning pandemic. thought Americans would follow first orders isolate either. Yes exactly. think Houston certainly hit first harder, I’m afraid based numbers cities changes make today would still slow next weeks it’s already hand matter what. required to. lenders mandated add missed payments end term allow arrangement missed payments made months

Generally people say big man mean center, Jokic fact best center. he's better Giannis, Giannis PF 'big man' traditional terminology. Fun fact, per capita death rate italy 2x per capita death rate US.

Not fun fact, Italy past first wave infections US still firmly first wave. probably want wait see happens Covid reaching southern rural areas. declaring victory even half time. 

The per capita death rate also mean much right now. [From source quoted People right ask whether numbers representative several reasons. First, countries worldwide decide differently gets tested virus, meaning comparing case numbers death rates could extent misleading. Germany, example, started testing relatively early country’s first case confirmed Bavaria January 2020, whereas Italy tests coronavirus postmortem. Second, people go see (or see, due testing capacity) doctor mild symptoms. Countries like Norway Netherlands, example, recommend people non-severe symptoms stay home. means cases known time, could significantly alter death rate presented here. Third finally, numbers like change frequently depending pandemic spreads national healthcare capacity. therefore recommended look (freely accessible) content dives specifics, coronavirus testing capacity India number hospital beds UK. additional pieces information get full picture, something statistic current state simply cannot provide.

It good metric comparisons european countries fraction population, that's reason fairing better covid

Care explain that? forget reference EU US similar total population EU substantially densely populated. Facts hurt. herd immunity mutating virus. Better hope vaccine. lol article: ""Flanked charts showing disturbing medical trends, Abbott declined yet make masks mandatory concern “personal liberty” .

Oof. Abbot determined teach *virus* lesson. Texas style! rural Pennsylvania, would love that. people New Jersey New York come PA go cabins camp.

Now, decades later, gone downhill clings vestiges youth, can't decide pity laugh her. I'm journalist sounds like damn good science Well italy, spain, uk, belgium.

2 hardly hit failing HC systems, one wannabe sweden still lockdown one anomaly probably one counts covid deaths properly.

I would happy country started situation better norway ended joining club. current climate, would think back forth getting employers response UI claim necessary. Verify asked stop working fashion. Assume rest push through. wear incorrectly, inhale gets caucht inside mask end inhaling it? China saving face. would want admit shit? Even penalty isn’t death  family returned Florida vacation weeks ago tested positive including 4 year old attends day care. 2nd family know coming vacation Florida testing positive include kids age 5. Yes is. gave us $600/week pandemic. ends soon though. think would residents visitors, I’m sure yet people wanting wear mask like people wearing masks fail undestand covid-19 rates high state Don’t still pay eventually though? don’t even see helps anyone  Better tldr:

Just risk yourself, still risk lifes people around you. point, shows us incredibly incapable governments are; can't even enforce mask policy prevent contagious disease killing thousands more. Make law, make masks affordable even free. 

I work retail extra cleaning, disinfectant wipes, sanitizing stations required prevent covid; wearing mask ""encouraged."" fuck? enforce required. required state means businesses dont excuse need play good guy refuse service anyone wearing mask. 

With said, good companies leading way like Menards actually refuse entry folks wont wear mask. (They $1 mask sale outside store) *REAL* Americans pull bootstraps force DNA reproduce damaged β cells might have. believe prepare. also convenient. Anyone know positivity rate cases today wear mask til get table time leave table. preferably wear mask food comes. 

States highest case growth also lowest mask users. insane. know people saying left house besides trip grocery store. they'd make claim unless someone coughs keels front lawn. 
I understand fear denial, make less irksome dangerous. Lol im joking. Throwing Onion headline. Oh mean EU. Yeah mean traveling like domestic travel Hopefully number people thinking ""It's flu bro!"" outnumbered cautious enough stay home avoid life long consequences like scarred lungs, lethargy, breathing problems dialysis. worst part is, population numbers increased dramatically since think still applied wrong thread... use one like feel pretty comfortable r/houston data showing 97%. 90% old number. whole year inferior education tens millions children? simply can't learn well home school, think schools closed initially reopen Covid truly decline. could open high schools first see effect older students likely follow mask distancing guidelines. think entire year distance learning would set many children's education hold. 5k new cases 06/23 

Went telling states stay away Texas top five states cases. like bust air complete authority zero actual knowledge. Carter president grade school. parents seemed like addressing Americans called Energy Crisis, asking Americans turn thermostats. pandemic happened watch, could picture regularly speaking country working together taking necessary precautions. Also starting programs ease suffering. would gutted agencies protect health. 

Expecting Trump even boost popularity work. He's worse useless. He's going keep harm trying please cronies. point, shame might appropriate. agree important ICU capacity good fills up. doubt that. 

But Coronavirus sub implication fill due covid19 patients that's simply true all. diseases body read need need keep antibodies. flu vaccine pertussis vaccine relatively short life spans body feel need remember. Part might mild cases get immune system's attention enough. Sicker people often hold onto antibodies longer Yes course. account real referring people quarantine instead took road trip. Like Australia, idiots, one eventually spread it. told every school country’s defining trait Freedom, government ever forces something it’s duty resist. german Government risk paper says mostly same. Something like contact tracing prevention spread best approach high number. Btw paper 2013 reads like covid playbook. Really point many predictions (from china, first hit germany first quarter Year, sars like coronavirus etc.) Exactly. Herd immunity achievable 1% infection herd complies distancing mask usage. herd rejects distancing measures gets together non-stop superspreader events, 95% infection required herd. need use special material mask? America unwilling, therefore incapable defending this

This consumed fear. alone might shave hundred thousand deaths total body count.

You literally evidence all. I've seen even certainly inflated death rate, still 0.5-1% mainly older people die last year life. But! It’s election year, ain’t it?

Yeah, understand entails: certain political party who's spent last 4 years whatever demean destroy another politician use ""pandemic"" way helps win elections.

Stop sheep. People understand wearing mask protect stranger much person wearing mask. Speedy recovery, buddy. know meant. 

You die flu various diseases fine that, didn’t hunker live like hermit. Hundreds thousands people die theoretically preventable viruses, keep living lives take chance. put corona deaths others? IMO it’s “new” “scary”. 

If truly lived life statistics would never leave house again. Ironic since Flordia wanted New Yorkers back April. prepared response, would expected Sweden could taken ""island"" approach. Lock restrict travel.

Here Canada we're still getting Americans sneaking saying they're driving Alaska. hope get balls lock now.

Side question, Swedes feel closer Norway Finland? guy condo built gym parking spot. bad idea. trump gone, you’ll still nobody. people you’ve pushing away past 4 years still going hate you, doesn’t go away.

And you’ll still poor fuck fighting scraps laugh ass 80 footer Ibiza. want give two opinions. one hand, worth it. think new guidelines say something like 6ft apart, wearing masks, 10 people.

On hand, worth region surge hospitalizations. queue enter shops?

Id bet would actual riots area implemented this. stores zero precautions all, certainly nothing would enforced customer. 

I work nursing home near daily altercations people want come building. people disagree elderly population vulnerable yet even still refuse precautions unless forced. place like Walmart grocery store doesn’t stand chance it’s daily fight nursing home. 

People simply either don’t believe it’s real don’t care. Scary shit. know one, Ad5-nCoV phase 3 trial start Brazil next month 9000 test subjects lasting 6 month. Wow. still haven’t even gotten stimulus check, yet inmates do. Wtf call heroes absolve keeping safe.

We ask ourselves, makes hero hero literature? Sacrifice greater good.

We call people heroes sacrifice others, especially thing sacrifice safety double especially sacrifice lives.

Medical Professionals sign sacrifice safety lives. call heroes preemptively, die due lack protective gear, still sleep night. tell comforting story sacrificed profits incompetence, instead heroes, willing make ultimate sacrifice greater good.

It's cynical exercise marketing allow Americans sleep night, allow leaders shift responsibility blame. statement NYC rates behaved exactly would without intervention completely unsupportable, given basis comparison. do, however, know approximate percentage New Yorkers who've exposed, nowhere near suggesting. Yea... ran out.. Awww made feel better know others care. Please stay safe ❤️ enter 20+ countries without them, yeah. ;-) seen 8-12% hospitalized, 8% catch virus. less 1% kind long-term issues. implications? dude time around indian officer crossed China initiate skirmish looks healthy 47 year old.

'I take seriously.' 'I'm self centered idiotic asshole.' Poor life choices. Also worth noting [Texans Children's Hospital started accepting adult patients ease DeSantis shooting 6000 Exactly true all. Originally thought 6-18 months immunity. I’ve heard closer 4, almost worthless terms herd immunity. understanding reinfected initial studies showed positive tests recovered patients false positives due nonviable viral shedding. Norovirus 3 - 12 month immunity, outbreaks happen often. Source? Cheats unlocked, 28 DNA points available. What's expected time frame completion P3? Also idea population size P3?

It’s authoritative. seatbelt laws then? It’s protecting public health. freedom override that. don’t get? Ah see. seems pretty fucked up. And? benefits doesn’t mean doesn’t benefit us i'm saying ban political based reason. half deaths infections nursing homes, comprise 0.6% nation's populations. recent infection rates large areas like LA county upwards 80% confined nursing homes. reality areas, lot wild spread, poor management skilled nursing facilities really skewed US numbers. know similar europe, know death rate 10%, enough testing, proper understanding endemic is.

personally, think travel limited necessary travel. mean business travel. mean actually necessary, like can't task skype. story experts changes frequently still, clearly many unknowns anyone let guard down.  come see Yeah Europe visiting family EU ban came out. really least notified talked EU bit iron details trump announced it, sounded like dad gonna stuck EU foreseeable future. ended citizens legal residents allowed go US. trump administration loves using good ol inflammatory language piss countries. great job CoronaVirus, including early ban China, Ventilator production, Testing, far most, best, World. saved millions U.S. lives.!

( ಠل͟ಠ) would another one. looked Georgia lately? set records Saturday yesterday. one needs like us, everything outside it’s normal guess massive spikes. Hospitalizations already getting close overrun way outside Atlanta. success. one trying anything dumbass state doing. Could use way distract hours every night wind down.

Drinking booze smoking dope, tbh.  coworker actually traveled there. plane. Last week. people actually going.

He mask/precautions compliant, seemed weird did. said wore mask day sanitized everything touched/getting rides, ate counter service avoid going doors necessary. Said never felt crowded. still... went. confused me. least everyone hoax camp. America first! That's fair 

I'm Georgia still stagnant. decreasing bit constantly oscillating. Florida climb tho. I'd okay NY Michigan wants ban America vaccine found. I've gotten consistent chills sick twice life, would easy spot haha.

I'm glad stayed well. definitely need covid close Honestly momentous moment entire US. Disney fucking huge never closes anything. closing big fucking deal lol.  increasing daily cases nationwide 4% day (30% week).

Assume remains constant (we'll come back that). Assume 100k people got infected today (so tested 30% infections - believe number twice big, double everything below. based daily deaths I'm okay it. ). Ignore everything today. 

In 30 days, 5.6 million total infections starting today. 60 days, 24 million. 90 days, 83 million. 

The rate certainly remain constant, reasons we've seen point. first point actually rising 8% day places, declining others. holds rate growth would converge 8%, 4%. second places may act reduce rate spread, though unless make negative stopgap. 

The third test 1/500 population day, max around 25% hit rate. 1/2000 population infected day, testing longer useful containing spread. Contact tracing even limited, unless hundreds thousands, millions contact tracers. else equal rate spread likely skyrocket (R value doubling) point. I'm losing war weeds garden. never ending onslaught nice outside disconnected bit. win fight end, dammit.  like they’re seeing America, president fool denies anything going on. Hence countries completely screwed. 😂 That's shell corporation tax evasion purposes.

People tried get tech going Dublin early 2000s (I visited times), died far away everything. Wait...Massachusetts...nuke....holy shit we’re living fallout! government made nonsense scare people manipulate life! Masks effective reducing community spread viruses. Period. End story.  matter company implements rules practice simply flat effective reducing community spread.

Social distancing always possible usage masks mitigates risk.  know works seeing results right now.  people protests become infected wearing masks unlike people time period since Memorial day weekend infected large numbers. I’m Canada, know lot great Americans I’d stoked too. grad school Amsterdam still called it’s going university (it’s getting MSc PhD). 

Called fall one minded. :) It’s actually older word autumn! Floriduh Latin America corrupt region poor areas. need crazy shit - care Mississippi California. saying got crazy US fucking rocker right now. Please stop perpetrating idea forced herd immunity. doesn’t work. It’s stupid. people need little discipline. Nobody else going offer family get haircut. People hate families, maybe, make less 20% population. Let tell truth too. 
Most airlines even get profit times.  
 
Infact local airlines stop limit thier flight season. 
So airlines flying basically savings loss. 
Also airlines many companies distribute thier profit bonuses/salaries CEO's people. hide profits. 
I even know thier police booking even legal. 
Fuck Emirates fuck giving seat already paid for. Thank you? Yes tests virus FINE, wear mask it'll make much easier pry guns cold dead hands, MORON. That’s really upsetting, many Americans control guidelines government gives even bother read damn article? really important go little beyond headline. College frat parties longer happen. College kids moving back parents seeing friends. could merit. It’s shame whatever reason, everything mutually exclusive. Taking rational approach everyone part would beneficial economy well. idea one other.

EDIT: wtf birthday

EDIT EDIT: never realized cake day Reddit anniversaries. first ban rest states

Color surprised Fiance boat :(. Last time saw August. supposed come Netherlands year. looking rough. Never wonder much Japanese space toilets help prevent spread there. tend flush lid etc? Ah, straight KKK guidebook. That's sad!!! ""I skimmed it"".

Aha. Floridians really needs slow testing bring numbers cheap CEO didn’t ever us work home despite fully capable so, returning right word either. I'm zoomer lives san marcos see nightclubs filled issue it’s people disobeying mask guideline die. would likely come contact spread COVID higher risk person might really trying hard take precautions needs get necessary supplies :(. Cool bro, keep peddling fear. Heard they're preparing NRG stadium beds. truly disaster. LOL. adjust death numbers people already dying pre-existing conditions, caught virus died instead. extra deaths, numbers poached routine mortalities. 

The government lockdown restrictions totally pointless, even making virus problems worse keeping people (who even risk!) things need time crisis. People risk, already know need keep safe. take precautions that's problem point, deaths millions year preventable causes, mostly go ignored. know else predictable it’s comical? hospitalization deaths follow cases. saying death rate high April? No. Unless hospitals collapse death rate lower. going see metrics get substantially worse they’re now. curiosity local government required wear mask, would wear one? do, ain't happening while. 

There's still plenty ""I got infected, fine two weeks, I'm almost dead"" stories going around. contradictory messages government lead public mistrusting authority. seen san marcos zoomers get Happy hear this! probably strategy GOP try tempt moderates back towards Trump's side Goood gooood...

Cartoon villain dry handwash Afaik warp speed use national guard deploy vaccinations Exactly! frustrating - painfully predictable also late stop another big outbreak. spreading weeks, numbers going anytime soon. 

Still get people say ""Well, what, supposed lock forever!?"" No, one saying that. want reopen smartly, that's way get stay reopened. dad head doctorologist lungology. issuing form ticket people comply? Remember discussion weeks, case growth tapered (like Sweden). Maybe rethink things, realize media fueling dopamine addiction. Instead informing you. money earmarked Secret Service pay Trump properties room golf cart rents god damn it!!!!  longer people act way they’re willing get virus, longer people higher risk groups safe. get virus, odds you’ll pass odds they’ll pass extend time virus control region, turn increases likelihood at-risk people getting somewhere along chain.

The at-risk people might die virus often, contributing keeping going don’t take precautions. Trump going announce he’s building wall US Europe, 
the EU pay it’. Well strong doominhness streak personality. must admit, bit, maybe, look like getting less severe.

It could also doctors getting better treating it, saw many doctors saying virus got easier treat.

It would quite good true. said beginning. half-assed shutdown useless. delays spike. Taking account human nature, shut early. thought looking New York Europe would enough warning, people need experience devastation first hand willing take serious action. Like Jason Vorhees, probally put stake bury underwater. 20 shots would fine me. I'd like live years. People think whatever bad thing _could_ happen, won’t happen them. 

Speeding? “I’m good driver, won’t crash”. 

COVID? Either “Less 1% Americans tested positive, rare can’t catch it” “I’m healthy, even catch fine”. I'm sure point sharing name bar is. They're pretty much unsafe there's way make safe.

The exception patios/outdoor bars, I'd comfortable going to.

Obviously even circumstances, sharing drinks would lead transmission, though. inability cope reality problem. !!!!!!

You can’t make shit up.  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Suggestion- subreddit flairs like “I wear mask” show sheer numbers people Yeah, heard virus damage organs, even feeling fine. You’re unnecessarily oddly inferring lot there. Climate change force animals go places, exposed different environments, closer proximity animals may communicable diseases. accelerates consistent exposure vectors dietary issues humans have, increasing populations areas, promote zoonotic diseases transmitted humans wet markets otherwise. mention fact populations continue rise there, humans also forced go deeper areas previously haven‘t.  


So, yeah. Buckle up. Fair enough Time create Covid Colonies la Leper Colonies! People always shitting LA. look like cities mean true. Los Angeles dense suburbs New York lacks. ranks number one urbanized density census analysis independent USC analysis. Dude stop fear mongering. doesn’t.

It extended far beyond that.

And pay taxes “ that” Good thing exes live Texas Pretty sure keeping people home allowing work going make people suffer what’s happening will. “The health department recently provided 10,000 collection kits Sonora Quest.”

Hoping active cases. age money god, lies come false prophets CEOs corporations. course people would say anything downplay problem causes lose money. That's job. estimated yesterday (at 90%) would hit capacity 14 days. 24 hours later 97%.

I think 12 days surge capacity pipedream. give 2, maybe 3 Looking forward inevitable stories sheriffs announcing enforce it. Could vitamin levels higher people weather warmer people outside more, sun much direct months ago?  Seriously, people think lockdown achieve, ending lead cases? year screwed up, keep waiting nukes used. catastrophic failure Alberta's testing capabilities despite encouraging everyone, symptoms not, get tested weeks. hilariously overestimating readily people line get stabbed throat nose healthy. aka fuck quebec. Oh. Idiots. AKA 'conservatives'. curiosity, Reddit asking shut BLM protests well? think you’re reading lot comment wasn’t there. again, may you.

I worried comment responding to, comment, would lead people thinking spike happening Seattle isn’t. least yet. get excited transformation 'decent fellow,' note said right would encourage everyone, that's said there, sort become informed nuances state reporting. Florida, state tells us 20 percent COVID cases register hospitalizations people hospital something else, like knee replacement, they're tested tested positive.”

Why can't say ""wear masks"" leave that? add part seems minimize everything make seem like positive cases over-reported, imply situation really bad?


A positive test positive test, that's one person maybe soon able spread virus someone else. like everyone forgotten exponential growth is, forgotten basically shut country back early/mid-March fewer 2,000 cases entire nation... yet back 15 times amount new cases *every day*. developed mild sore throat one evening. year would've thought ""Air's bit dry, hope I'm getting cold."" year, went got Corona virus test next morning quarantined (my results came back negative). 

The level stupid must staggering. hundreds vaccines manufacturers there. I’m surprised (especially small ones) found problematic. YES, first story floating since Wuhan. think Doctors checking this?

I married medical family. 6 MD's RN. None seen anything like all. Also, reading articles this. say prevalent handful cases.

If want peddle fear that's prerogative. one prepared, figured I'd another 10 15 years old man. lost hero, role model, man made person am. third time read something similar.The 2 different doctors Italy.Still seems anecdotal far interesting nonetheless. What’s split politically? skimmed it, strongly disagree treatments we’ve found effective enough prevent rise numbers, they’re substantial improvements miracles comprehensive treatments father law keeps using Lilly pad analogy. prefer ""filling football stadium water"" one. either way, illustrates exponential growth hard people understand. Lol America decided we’re done corona. Especially Florida (where live unfortunately). conclusion shopping?
People die regardless, question people, where, many. case shutdowns, we'll save Western seniors expense third-world children. hate third-world children, right?

Fauci flip flopped like remember. Early on, saying masks helpful, later acknowledging fact say that, corrected saying masks important. info studies done, learned adjusted accordingly. else flip flop? New York State safest state Union right now, afraid idiots called hot zone states coming screwing up. care report anyone does. Nice edit comment btw. Everything bigger Texas this, dear reader, get ICU beds 97% capacity. 

Sheer stupidity disregard fellow man. Damn fucking sucks. hope get vaccine soon, cause one wants wear mask, everyone wants horde food household supplies. Something going give I’m going avoid motherfuckers like plague COVID-19 cured least put control. Houston problem comes mind. New York peaked 50% positive early April national testing infrastructure small fraction tests severely rationed.

What hell AZ completely unprepared this? Guy never Europe thinks Alex Jones reliable source “Ladies, wear mask. Gets diagnosed COVID-19*

I don’t deserve you. Loved movie too. staying hostel Bratislava freaked bit guy behind counter looked like one movie. Lol move already seriously. time would better spent whatver actually enjoy doing. Childrens movies toys whateve. Try it. happier. live 30 minutes Disney world passholder goes regularly. last time went March 1st eerie feeling leaving would last time while. 

I miss going parks time, reopens, see going quite while. Disney safe be, wait ride haunted mansion...I wanna join 999 happy haunts there. Yeah agree everything said there, I'm pretty happy things gone think people starting disregard everything trying get back normal soon. saying trying stimulate economy people beaches, Trinity bellwoods, people walking around everywhere going inside without mask etc. unnecessary risks point--we acting like everything normal yet still let us swedes roam free? Get lol Jared Kushner bought Frommer’s. Downvoted oblivion...but wrong Louis CK reference? lot folks need put meds (and coronavirus meds). They're paranoid COVID borders delusion, desperately grasping straws - anything, really - justify hysteria. Oh EU likes borders? Notifications location based nationwide. phones get them. get general reminders social distancing, masking, types places avoid. also get specific alerts latest confirmed cases district surrounding districts. alert provides link website tracks infected individuals were. able see whether crossed paths infected.  hurt matter run course. travel countries imported somewhere else. think people thinking aspect. 

Globalization great ways good others. see globally transmission occur waves everywhere nobody really wants freeze world travel long every country infection. long country infection we're risk.. positive case means still transmit virus dummy  home long forgot public toilets. That's patently false. 

Economy fucking important, next year everyone going realize. Mass unemployment, shuttered businesses, insufficient tax bases make every city look like Detroit. NYC start looking like 70's wealthiest getting first. Chicago 104 shootings 14 murders Fathers Day weekend, expect go police longer policing. Every big city police force going go hibernation BLM Dem politicians catering Leftists. Expect white flight unseen since 60's. well-to-do telecommute, black unemployment around 30%, bankruptcies we've ever seen. work, sentencing 1% test subjects die. would highly unethical. Actually...the Swedish foreign minister crying discrimination since Swedes stopped border now. clearly want go outside. 

Sweden recommends going places turn away Swedes border (eg. every single neighbouring country) Makes sense. Definitely don’t see lasting long economies already distressed. small discrepancies overweight percentage within demographic absolutely explain difference mortality. Wikipedia's race data 2017 says there's 200M white people us, roughly 70% obese 140M, 40M black people means 30M obese. that's 5 obese white people America every 1 obese black person. Yet apmresearchlab says 25,000 black Americans died covid 50,000 white Americans. 2 white Americans died every 1 black American. That's huge discrepancy comparing obesity covid mortality. 

I break smoking demographics, since that's even smaller difference.

Similarly, hypertension breaks 4 white Americans condition every 1 black American. big risk factors definitely account disparity, though course could contribute. stronger case could made correlation poverty, absolutely could argued politically result racist disenfranchisement black America. Years ago found Massachusetts machine shop, talking owner. gave opinion really excuse electing George Bush second time (the one purpose), moron ( know, comparison, genius). brief moment entire room sweaty, mostly shirtless, hairy machinists took said. concerned. group, expressed opinion Bush idiot. love Massachusetts. incorrect AZ looking hospitalization tab epi curve. means day increases 3 weeks. reality, 7 day trend new daily hospitalizations hit new time high 8th day row. [See chart spreadsheet [with data  you’re half right: actually don’t know certainty whether prior infection confers immunity humans _at all_, let alone permanently. summary, existing limited data antibody responses SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses, well one small animal model study, suggest recovery COVID-19 might confer immunity reinfection, least temporarily. However, immune response COVID-19 yet fully understood definitive data postinfection immunity lacking. agree everything said. Human life outweighs economy, question. think perhaps huge numbers deaths beginning due knowing treat? Deaths stagnant month seen spikes 28k May spike deaths followed. made realize Trump biggest Karen all. Proof everyone genders could Karen I’m tiny district think we’re waiting see bigger districts do. I’m specials teacher, I’m sure whether they’ll cut job (it’s definite possibility, one said *anything* me). waiting game frustrating live at-risk person, need new housing A) still job, B) we’re going back in-person. Lol, delusional like satire news site? Eu worst response whole world. Italy, Spain, Belgium Sweden, France, UK deaths whole world per capita. 
I hope satire No. Alan. don’t want ass right now, don’t even degree anything yet. That’s plan though  hospitalizations, yeah look like going down. bottom tab's page says ""% covid-19 cases missing hospitalization status 55%"" would like see graph looks like find 55%.

Also last link reassuring. Well, it’s directly kills COVID. Aren’t lot COVID deaths among pre-conditions caused increased complications pre-conditions, opposed cytokine storm? Uhh, permanent residents aren’t citizens. So, Brexit everything, include England? so, going definitely put crimp going London plans. can't even blame them, bummer. Happy cakeday, upvoted disaster. surgery scheduled may already delayed august, delayed again. us. Username checks Great video self righteous arrogant Karens showing making scene. shut soon. People shut life forever.

They started social distancing get numbers down. mandatory carries fine $700k somehow catch  Greece wide open travel time being? understanding June 15th open countries, visitors hot spots requiring mandatory 7 day quarantine. Texas setting makeshift hospitals like New York did? googled find anything. finnair flight London September get cancelled week. gotta fast hunting  build wall east coast Finally decent freaking intelligent conversation current situation. Family member tested positive. Apparently went see grandma week before. Suuuuuper glad made choice me.


So yes, whipper snappers definitely back visiting grandmas. hope so! Columbia already did. Unfortunately I'm Charleston. Yes people protesting April, haircuts beer bar like meme said, survival livelihood. people travel east coast? yes. dumbest people confident?

Because right virus come along help nature course yet? Yeah mean would completely shut get go months we’d probably somewhat okay. live Austin barely feels like anything changed honestly lol. shut time didn’t last long. opened back mom COVID multiple job sites closed due cases. worked 5’ 2 guys couple weeks got diagnosed. shut lol 🤦🏼‍♂️ pandemic would cripple economy regardless. Look Sweden, whose economy crippled despite barely effort slow virus wrong, there's 2.4 million people confirmed positive US. 
Accounting positives found last 4 months testing constraints safe say what... ~15 Million people United States need lung transplants organ failure? 

Sure seems like conspiracy news covering this. 3D printing lungs? forget earth flat! So, little late? yes, yes is.  That's less day testing current rates. realize it’s liberal government pushing this, right?  noticeably stopped caring realized hitting urban poor/minorities hardest. I’m stating opinion, I’m restating statistical patterns played hard hit areas.

Also doctor epidemiologist, doesn’t crunch numbers living. he’s right probably won’t bad situation could been, think assertion case numbers alone shouldn’t cause alarm questionable. really hope Charleston soon! Even though still think people really wear them. historical Trek timelines cued next. Let’s hope they’re wrong. 

The way things headed, may Germany time.  Imagine replied people saying projections unmitigated case growth Sweden March BS.  ""everyone"" said ""Doctors epidemiologists ""; include random internet commentators politicians. End economic system? LMFAOOOOOOOOO Right!? I’m mixed. one drop rule what? think worth weighing benefits.

I see anything wrong attending one wedding taking precautions.

Right I'm seeing one friend. try stay socially distanced go pick food swim together. it. every day. even every week. worth it. 

But moat time mi grocerry delivered, Ive reduced eliminated unnecessary purchases excessive deliveries, go movies eat.

Im still happy. know commenters called bleak. art. Watch tv. Read. talk friends virtually.

I feel bad go swimming local swimming spot month.

Its ok still sometimes something you. Like attend close family members wedding. 

But also, feel differently, go. also ok draw boundaries tighter others. ok miss wedding. Personally even hope tradition lessens. whats best you. China banning imports foreign meat packing plants bad outbreaks. Damn evidence fecal-oral transmission ask me. god forbid dissenting political viewpoints, dweebs like u/DarXIV scour post history 😂 took quick look, first graph said normal occupancy, normal CAPACITY. normal CAPACITY 1300 change max capacity dark red 2800. I'm assuming unsustainable surge top number. 2K per month, free health care.

Even insurance USA, month hospital followup care financially devastating. Yes. mega dumpster fire making!! protests justified, absolutely discouraging large gatherings. also precautions taken guidelines place, contrary event. 

For clarification, “rally” state-approved concert, protest primarily political rally. There’s absolutely justification take place. poorly. Lol remember people didn’t even elect him, electoral college elected Lol remember people didn’t even elect him, electoral college elected  lip service, actions matter. voting record far :P Let's forget riots protests. think I've grown numb chaos. Like, pandemic civil rights issues themselves, overall fact country falling apart. expect trends every state opens up, even ones like New York look ok opened. Florida, Itah Texas looked fine initially too. Contact tracing impossible one complies it. Asian method electronically tracking people one works Americans simply won’t buy in. predict mass death economic destruction, lockdowns reinstitured nation wide next couple months. America fucking failure. Nassau county opened indoor dining New York local bar packed masks middle day. Half people Walmart wearing masks nose mouth. Unreal. Masks mandatory btw. honestly think lead massive restructuring American society long term, pain immense short term. can't construct sentence. Saving later. It’s simultaneously comforting stupefying people haven’t evolved much past hundred years. seam way That’s article says all. specifically states it’s likely due population it’s hitting better treatments.  Ughhh, people need read.  Here’s Colorado. story. cannot afford ignore Chinese vaccines. 7.7 billion people world antibody induced vaccine lasts 3 month. need vaccine affordable produced large quantity lot money made caging people We're Number 1! Obviously problem much testing...

🙄 Crazy. that's also pro-lockdown people sound freak virus average fatality age that's higher nation's life expectancy...  I'm introverted essential worker. I'm hoping live long enough take vacation days thing gets control. week fewer health worries husband cat would joy. PCR mostly (I hope), that's good! Thanks Cases dropping NY, example, right line height protests.
Should use logic? Well, hopefully Coronavirus pretty entertaining them. I've seen several reports well. could use good news I'm getting hopes yet. think Texas contact tracing? friend went wedding three weeks ago, guest tested positive week ago. found friend, bride refuses tell whole guest list want ruin memories. bride also banned guests masks ugly, said. get PCR test, week ago managed pay antibody test see headache week wedding COVID. still waiting results.

Meanwhile Nova Scotia, contact tracers tracked tell negative, sent result email 16 hours test sore throat. I'm noticing hiccup Arizona reporting. Deaths usually lower trend weekend seems catch around Tuesday terms deaths. I'm wondering hospitals dont reporting weekend North Dakota county fairs cancelled, along 3 major fairs cancelled. also huge Scandinavian festival September, cancelled lockdowns began. I'm done freaking world right now!!! I'm sure they'd lose, I'm sure it'd bloody. tremendous opportunity Biden show leadership. ""If want Trump reelected, wear mask economy gets going shut again. want protect family community, wear mask. want people safe.""

I also problem Biden started calling ""Trump's flu."" yesterday actually somebody argue gravity must misunderstood fake pull birds sky. imagine trying get someone like understand epidemiology trust doctors Wait since get shit together? Well honest Toronto metro area 6 million almost Ontario's population surrounds metro area. Ontario's population really clustered small area province compared Florida, I'd guess populated bits Ontario may similar size 87.4% Florida pop live urban areas, 68% Ontario residents do, still 10x dense. They’re hypocritical ones protesters tend big lockdown supporters ignore previous stances suddenly act like it’s okay gather large groups. get you’re coming mom complains masks every single time puts one tired didn't. ""Hey guys! idea!""

*slap*

""No, stupid. get share ideas anymore.""

""I thought everyone drank blea--""

*slap*

""Motherfucker told you!"" website consolidated list states (along restrictions) actually updating current information? I’ve seen several google search they’re bordering week + old. Nah, I've seen around world. hiked Mexico base camp resembled dump, literally. covered trash. Someone even graffitied boulders along trail mountain. Someone who’s scientific field likely able know read scientific publications vs average individual. disputing that, it’s based exposure.

I'm going disagree here, someone education hard science themselves. I'd wager *does* improve ability break scientific concepts, scientific publications dense terminology methodologies employed easy parse better layman experience field.

I say someone background biochemistry work way biology, chemistry, medical papers topics experience in, I've tried reading *abstracts* particle physics idea fuck they're going about, despite cornerstone chemistry.

Also, I've seen lot incredibly smart people amazingly dumbass opinions try operate outside field. actually give praise poster necessary humility recognize getting degree science mean qualified opinions something outside field. Thanks Nostradumbass. believe claims Doctor quoted article? players aren’t going sit inside rooms two months... need entertainment. couple years ago DT went Kim Jong-Un nuclear weapons neither bending inch. Seriously, went bed night wondering world would still intact next day. Look way:

Governments ""strongly insist""' masks worn. However, happens ""mandated"" worn? going enforce it?

Shop owners enforce it. United States. customer going open fire staff members end that. already happened several places far ""mandatory"" mask laws US. One angry person gun takes.

Same transit drivers. can't enforce mask policy. 

Who else going enforce it? Police? police everyone protesting raging currently? police gets lambasted called publicly social media every day? Good luck one.

It comes **enforcement**. Turns there's one enforce mask mandate. resources available enforce things.

People cry parties, gatherings whatnot happening city time, time lament police exist. even post *""Abolish disband police!""* reddit profiles, even hours apart! sigh. name calling makes right. So, one catches flu rural areas then? 140 people like 40 got tested. idea 100 doing

But comforting ! Still, good idea office. People don’t adhere rules well. can't stop it, publicize fucking stupid publishing ""I idea I'd catch COVID-19"" stories afterwards. That’s 60% Americans made least much locked down. realize Reddit person? agree. people getting alive engineers. What’s point bitching inevitable inconvenience? Cause social creatures thrive empathy allowed?  I’m thinking, I’m thinking!! conclusion shopping makes feel better lack understanding subject weight comes scientific ""opinion."" need listen you, matter here. Sigh. Should’ve known you’re troll. extent sympathize Doug Ducey don’t think he’s acting bad faith, think he’s dumb.

I think lesson shortcomings governors can’t afraid controversial, sometimes leader controversial. Fucking imagine wealthiest man planet decided send free masks everyone U.S. using massive logistics facilities already have. Amazon Basics Masks shit. Probably already everyone's address anyway. 


Hell even shipped masks Prime members, that's 112 million people.


But that, care us. care money. dad tho. BLM protests highly recommended masks giving well. also live Florida friends who’ve basically said they’re done corona. Nobody seems care here. world.

Surge capacity doesn’t mean anything see examples like already. Surge capacity doesnt mean anything don’t staff—which appears recent developments here. reason young people's deaths, morbid sounds, given extra attention still large amount people, many young themselves, believe risk them. already received pretty good break spring, now, open, permit system significantly limits number daily visitors. extended closure campgrounds July 31st, limit number people park. Jesus could rent mansion kind money *2021 say totally right: full lockdown neccessary mask usage measures mandated beginning. point size, scope, length outbreak dramatically increases mutation hybridization rate. recent studies antibodies, real proven data immunity, conjecture point time. didn’t happen people states country really fucking stupid selfish. unions happy got feeling everything prevent guy found overdosed meth binge gay hookers complete embarrassment?

Interesting. Zero chance Disney actually re-opens, Disney risk negative PR. vast majority people. thats point. people respect law, mitigated spread. course people skirt law, like laws. risk getting caught fined imprisoned. fear deter majority.

News broke virus late-December. locked Wuhan January 23. That's 1.5 months waiting -- likely ~28 days. lot local Wuhan officials suppressing information (they got fired btw). 

We shit late March U.S. Even then, half-assed (no strict contact tracing, nation-wide lockdown enforcement, mask requirement). America blew despite one richest nations word. Why? federal government sucked force local governments go extra lengths necessary protect American citizens. think that's way densely populated places manage disease. public wearing mask, part problem, part solution. Pence said over!!!! fuzzy math, based Arizona’s numbers carried nationwide based giving damn / communicability / case increases state minimal testing trace actual cases (30%). But, basically, doubling cases every three weeks nationwide would hit 290 million 21 weeks.

It’s off. didn’t put lot effort nuts bolts.. Places spread populations would lag behind example. Wearing Masks would slow too. But, based Arizona’s numbers gives crap attitude = 21 weeks real saturation occurs.

I also figure hospitals begin overflow, move too, slow things down.. But.. putting minimum effort.. there’s good news here. At-best putting forest fires setting new ones thing - one way other.

Any-way work numbers.. ..ungodly amounts needless sickness death. figure 21 weeks - around Christmas, know way thing.

But thing isn’t even running yet. barely ordered cleats Amazon.

Negative. single honorable person cast God-Emperor's love? Tell feds.

NY state fairly well. layoffs, imagine states going forced do.

And relief schools got funneled private schools, local state governments even get relief end. 1000%. got called back retail job mall San Diego. We’re still taking cash requiring people wear mask. It’s uncomfortable cringe. People really don’t care think there’s also gender component

Funny, people I've seen seem offended masks women. Tell 4 year old tested positive due 2 positive cases daycare. She’s symptomatic, we’re terrified, 2 year old little sister can’t understand wear masks. call bullshit I’m sure are, overall well liked response Held gunpoint: “Your money life.” It’s hard decision.  dad daughter knowledge mean even knows talking about. Still means still testing everybody.... can't fuckers get take ? awful. way healthcare system United States chronic disease like diabetes financial death sentence. designed go forever. Eventually even Canada going decide sustainable indefinite lockdown is.  lmao. Infected? Go educate yourself. Typical ignorant Southern fool. mother Trumper lives PA.

She outraged told 3 10 rent wearing masks went store. angrily told find people like was.

PA handled better. problem comes covid everything delayed.

Once infected spread disease days. might develop symptoms later. condition quickly worsen ICU spend weeks there.

Numbers sweden useless now. deaths, properly attributed, picture weeks ago.
Testing increase great news early give estimate what's going on. course increasing testing increase cases situation might better looks like.
But since months testing limited reference data.
Do people enjoy summer situation worse before? None tell. people get tired government suggestions take less care? know.

The shocking part country claimed base decisions science thst immense lags needed accuracy able effectively monitor situation.

I comment anymore daily report make sense point. made useless. even worse might even ""people color covering face scare shite white people"" best reporting seen. Compliments interviewer, asked intelligent questions, Dr Dobbs, answered frankly sensibly. 

It could become primary source document future analysts write went wrong summer. Dobbs list people utmost halt march folly. States supporting test sites. states problem waving feds away need them, get upset federal government waves away Kinda defeats point shutting 2 months going get point anyways. Seattle Bay Area (mostly) taken seriously much better rest country. I've seeing news regarding states, surprised purposely putting minorities danger guise ~freedom~. That, realized people wearing masks, can't identify things like security footage easily Shift+DEL Shift+INSERT old-school keyboard warriors! Welcome 5000 club Florida! 

\-Texas honestly care, loose wink sleep it. huge cons empty units, especially people desperate. Like vagrants living instead people know. People far likely trash empty house residence. Ah, system strange. Hospital uses PAPR widely ED, ICU outdoor test sites.

Anyway, forgot, heard before, FEMA offers free week long trainings health/public safety workers advanced PPE/HAZMAT response. classes covering topics like disease PPE, CBRN, hospital HAZMAT, radiology emergency, setting respiratory protection program/management...etc
I sure would help Maybe blatant violators get jail time. mostly relying people self enforce.

Just like laws. states report daily. Today’s numbers yesterday’s new cases. yesterday Arizona 1,795 cases reported today. someone health care field, bad take that’s it’s even feasible me. Please think speaking. probably report day time. states report morning, afternoon, evening. Antibody dependent enhancement. famous Dengue think.  Send back penthouse NYC let shitpost Twitter dwindling audience. Good example what's happening many say:

older middle age gentleman came surgery yesterday, tested preop like patients. Popped hot COVID symptoms all. Surgery considered critical done. outpatient procedure since go post op unit positive, admitted COVID unit recover surgery going home.

He counts ""COVID admission case"" even though recovering 90 minutes discharge began.

There thousands folks like right now. 

They're ICU, they're vents, stay hospital long.

But count ""COVID cases"" fear mongers screaming even though revolving door people, stacking folks hallway capacity   propoganda. media care political issues directly. care money. 

Right benefits encourage protests. Come closer november, many people back work protests died elections close start hammering protestors actually spread coronavirus little results they've actually achieved deaths they've caused.

They want grow emotion hate sides everyone reads news. Airborne viral particles rapidly inactivate direct sunlight. Looks like Cook County, Illinois. Here's top 15 yesterday:

All NY NJ counties trickle June. going see several counties pass force top 20. think know states counties from. recent development though. one saying they’re immune. proves nothing. Young people remain extremely low risk serious complications. Good example what's happening many say:

older middle age gentleman came surgery yesterday, tested preop like patients. Popped hot COVID symptoms all. Surgery considered critical done. outpatient procedure since go post op unit positive, admitted COVID unit recover surgery going home.

He counts ""COVID admission case"" even though recovering 90 minutes discharge began.

There thousands folks like right now. 

They're ICU, they're vents, stay hospital long.

But count ""COVID cases"" fear mongers screaming even though revolving door people, stacking folks hallway capacity Update: Houston 97% expected reach capacity 2 days. Mods please sticky. math bad. It'll come shortly. 

However, also feel bad paying rent. Rent vs ownership break even cases. properties unless generate income (aka rentals) keep inflation. Granted California 70-now outlier there's that. 

But renting paying money landlord live house getting everything fixed. 

Owning paying money bank, paying get everything fixed, carrying insurance, picked good neighborhood 30-50 years might eek profit. give kids die. 

IF said kids smart live house rent/mortgage free buy property start getting income properties instead. That’s governments for. People paid stay home. feel people raised us, much higher death rate. one actually enforcing self-quarantine NY. 

According Cuomo, use judicial orders enforce quarantine. know there's middle ground ""crash entire economy national shutdown"" ""do nothing, accept widespread health crises"" right?

Mandatory mask wearing every indoor setting first step Sorry, Apple users use Apple keyboards almost always least input functionality broken.

Cannot complete task. compassion. child. agree obesity appears really worsen effects severe cases, hate helpful. India 139th position tests/capita. seeing tip iceberg. Wow, set back 70 years - WTG Cali. long, read testing centers longer going Federally funded. live never many cases people took super serious. There's basically cases one wearing masks social distancing. would take one positive case go Walmart entire town undo work Smart move sure. Even implementation difficult/impossible many areas still help.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course tourists sneak/lie get away warning alone stop many people thus somewhat effective. 

&amp;#x200B;

On broader scope business send employee area without observing quarantine; much liability. area arguably largest business hub North America hurt area businesses need send people work.

&amp;#x200B;

Most everyone agree Covid getting worse steps need taken get handle this. Businesses feeling hit soon translate pressure governments states cases skyrocketing hopefully pressure bring positive results. That's exactly see horrifying.

States going way, FL one thing NY another thing. see consequence, states act slow movement people distrust other. 

This flows lack coordinated Fed response begging. state going way. people ignoring restrictions. Face coverings required inside, yet half people grocery store yesterday either holding mask hands, covering faces. happens pulled over? Immediate jail 14 days everyone car? murdered 2016.

The officer acquitted rehired could immediately retire pension claiming medical disability PTSD. mentioned rallies didn’t. Interesting omission part. hope too. work disaster everyone ignorant reality. think theyrre invincible. they'll get soon People UK value freedom lives!? talking about? Where? Good example what's happening many say:

older middle age gentleman came surgery yesterday, tested preop like patients. Popped hot COVID symptoms all. Surgery considered critical done. outpatient procedure since go post op unit positive, admitted COVID unit recover surgery going home.

He counts ""COVID admission case"" even though recovering 90 minutes discharge began.

There thousands folks like right now. 

They're ICU, they're vents, stay hospital long.

But count ""COVID cases"" fear mongers screaming even though revolving door people, stacking folks hallway capacity See issue people can't get unemployment system disaster. 

There absolutely zero reason people able pay rent currently collecting unemployment. Ok man whatever say lmao bay area well people taking seriously. much rest country going fuck us. close borders. would easier enforce effective That's bug feature. Putin destroying US via agent. cases. least cases anyone ever heard of. Nobody ever imagined could recover quickly. 53 last months reviewing death certificates. 26 actual deaths today. curious part offends you? found mini-doc pretty realistic, showing lifes struggle real people. Remind cannot stomach BBC left west see either global times NDTV. Tell CERB works currently vacationing rural area (I haven’t interacted anyone, don’t worry) one wearing masks here, rural areas won’t social distance like people cities did. living sinking ship affluent taken life boats. decided open Texas werent ready basically went opened everything full capacity within 3 weeks without mandating masks. People chose wear fucked. small risk ≠ risk, no, correct. Yet people fail understand that. Best news 2020 Gloves effective safe them. Whatever virus would gotten hands, gloves. really provide added level protection properly washing hands touching orifices. ‘Zona got Rona. full sars patients tho? New Yorkers told over. Listen next time, fucking dumbasses! UAE phase III already started today, EXCITED. Gonna rough 2nd half year. live Texas I’m terrified go work. managers don’t even care people wear masks, don’t care lean around plastic shields breathe us...

I want quit soooo badly 800 short paying bills lease end. think vacation properties could picked cheap retirees kick ‘rona? I'm worried lot though. many community transmission cases there? probably could lot reason to. Coronaviruses make something like 40% common colds (not covid-19, obviously). seem forget cars still thing. going do? Setup checkpoints every state border points take census entered state when? If? are.  One cable networks (or maybe them) little 'profiles we've lost' segments, they'll feature three people show pictures talk sentences, like short obituary. They're usually diverse group different areas country backgrounds.

One segment saw features three people prison system died. mention crime, gave sentences person. stick white collar criminals either, short profile someone armed robbery.

It nice seeing that, prisoners getting affected too, there's lot challenges covid-19 prison system. good see profiled along others. kinda wonder pointed prison first place, draw attention fact vulnerable populations nursing homes prisons time vulnerable places too. ran tests idea playing race card. 


If truly think Paris dangerous city, obviously traveled much. I've lived Paris 5 years count 1 hand number incidents I've witnessed (obviously including stuff like pickpocketing). 

But I'd like see got opinions Paris from. long lived there? never could have. city mostly factories. None closed down, even peak. still working. Hubs still working. service industry really shut down, maybe couple weeks month. time, everyone kids home improvement stores buying project supplies stimulus checks going parks many early, warm spring days.

The took voluntary lay offs early recently let go permanently perceived team oriented. They're gonna hurting come July UI runs out. Oh joy... think it’s going fun watch struggle convince others supporters liked specifically didn’t vote said inflammatory things. really don’t think elected brings table, elected proxy people’s frustrations. 

I also think loses election GOP narrative going flip almost instantly. get feeling waiting chance pivot away since election. Spanish Flu spread rapidly throughout world due end WW1 soldiers/people going home places. mention GOP convention Jacksonville. year keeps getting better better. Yup. Adds ""you're welcome here"" factor.

RI successful literally sending officers vacation homes reminding people expected quarantine 14 days. literally went door door, apparently went fairly well, also giving info time, people reported feeling ""unwelcome"". used signs highway effect. think careful reading article needed. issue H1B article along related ones relaxing existing limits H1Bs. 20 positions mentioned variety positions tech. surprisingly CEO longer company closed shop Canada San Fran office have. BI confirmed offices closed even cheaper labor.

You get talented Tech workers US, however, companies willing pay would rather pay someone H1B bottom instead going market rate. course won’t. supporters go ship. He’ll never sorry reflective he’s legit sociopath. one thing do. work isn't. 31% never low since working I've 2 years now. someone explain what's happening TX?

Thought governor gave OK open business.

Why/How CoV spreading? What're demographics getting infected?

There's many different accounts what's happening... cases appeared acceptable hence OK governor open up, many people generally practice social distancing wearing masks, see lots pictures people eating meeting groups, etc...

The infected rate one thing people getting hospitalized another. virus know care rights. Hospital administrations across country already done that. Threatening Doctors Nurses alike post anything social media. current administration set end federal funding support June 30th 13 coronavirus testing sites, currently located five states: Illinois, New Jersey, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Pres. DT said testing ""double edged going send CNN report checking profile, already know share research. 

So aware, criticism haircut stay open Covid real protests carried risk spread spread misinformation virus kill. benefit nicer hair negative impact death hundreds thousands Americans exposure taking virus seriously. 

With BLM, argument going outside would spread virus risks lives, never protesting protesting day every time someone dies accomplished NOTHING decade -- BLM protestors protest see change, guaranteed part system risks lives -- trade whether virus society taking lives, lives get taken.

The CNN report showed research spread virus BLM protest. surprised, since open, outdoor space, population likely wear masks, much lower spread thought. means protests would directly caused fewer infections previously expected. 

That still excuse protests wanting get haircut every stupid act. virus taken seriously containable direct result media coverage, presidential addresses, attitude many americans. also trace issues along state lines, look Fox rating political leanings approximate areas hardest hit. 100%, across country people parties continue unsafe things, political line drawn here. 

The irony despite new studies spread protests, despite supporting advocating earlier protests, conservative focused media soon spinning virus fault BLM protests Plenty test subjects globally however 

China prevented terrorist attacks without bombing innocent people.  Thank sacrificing economy. blood keep gears machine moving. 

S/ 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 unlikely go bar night symptoms

He started feeling symptoms night after, night. yeah, still enough time virus incubate.

Symptoms show early two days, average five days. guy definitely caught beforehand. Oh okay. apologies misunderstanding comment. thought trying claim tests useless idea many infections Sweden has. gets bad really choice, sacrifice people economy? happens hospitals decide worth caring resources. 
  I'm 30s, know paying higher taxes pay economic damage covid done whole life. That's fine kept people safe, sheltered fed much possible. perfect worked ""Flattening curve means keeping hospitals getting overwhelmed. Mission accomplished."" native Americans similar people Asia? Since walked here.  purely political post. Please reinstate. Haha least agree something funny thing enough cases China effective Phase 3 trial. Phase 3 needs Texas Florida ... South America winter. desperately hoping would true here, too. would help could get data know getting infected spike? young people protested? rural Californians seeing first wave? people restaurants? beachgoers? ugh sucks. stay safe, stay sane! idea.  that's fact talking about. feel like comment came announcement petty NY NJ CT shouldn’t everything possible keep citizens safe. Ahhhh ok takes. way looking right now, 10 million Sunday, 11.5 million week after, 13.5 week Jersey. Gov. Murphy apparently power trip cautious giving demands reopen everything month ago. Jersey way life conducive pandemic. real question people believe ? biased opinion due inconvenienced? would think couldn’t come back propaganda? we’ve come back many worst scenarios. Lower EU unemployment good economic conditions, LOL. US economy COVID = EU good economic year. Yeah, going selfish here. affecting them, think it, want carry life know it. Plus, quite people 'say' would rather die partying fun live life holed bubble. (I put say quotes know actually caught ended hospital would change tune). MONEY WORKS HOWEVER WANT TO. literally made humanity resource distribution. unchangeable uncontrollable force nature (like Covid).

We could something else, even temporarily. want tip hand status quo option, though. lesson coming fall?  Unfortunately people afraid already taking necessary individual steps.

Those afraid welcome stay inside wear n95 mask about. 🤷 Dallasite, couldn’t agree more. number people without masks crowding restaurants alarming. TABC even caught multiple bars significantly exceeded maximum occupancy. smart, would send 2 stimulus checks. One right lockdown. 

But government unfortunately known smart Who's first? bizzarre  Probably b/c closed almost ICU units they've done CA since taking entire floors away departments. doubt ramp ICU space needed. Javits center NY never used, either Hospital ship LA NY. Nope.

 landlord still paying utilities, mortgage, property tax, someone file tax return, etc. someone unit generating positive cash flow far better cost couple cans paint dings scrapes wall. born here? voted, gone door door, etc. help. going Nov election, brick high risk.

Once allowed corporations lobby politicians get jobs corporations retired fucked. valuable lessons learned NYC obliterated.

sorry Houston people die lose friends families. sorry Healthcare workers. sorry applauded heroes die due exposure. pray, pray, fight tooth nail make sure HVACs operational. backup generators. wearing PPE hospital broken HVAC Houston weather cause secondary heat stroke first responders. wear mask there's fucking pandemic going requires mask effectively stay safe public. mean good entered phase 3, hasn’t Oxford phase 3 England ongoing weeks now? true. work Houston Methodist surgical unit nearly full weekdays currently. still working age, small chance dying. literally better chance knowing dying it. 600 bonus extends July, need extended beyond replaced. shown unprepared unemployment systems are. I've applying weekly since March, I've total two batches payments, missing weeks. month since last gave funds, amount going run end week. get spend day calling busy phone line autoredial app hoping get connected sometime week. won’t lock though, point protests would unenforceable. Speechless Tbh majority World acts like over. think underestimate stupidity. beliefs Bugs Bunny may saw us afterall That’s title saying. title saying BLM protests cause “spike” infections. Infections increasing US background rate based study overall impact BLM protests accelerate, i.e., spike rate. 

The article title suggesting Covid spread protests. It’s simply saying protests result spike/acceleration amount covid cases. entirely accurate based scientific study. article posted “the world” going mad lockdowns, “countries similar Sweden”.

If can’t discuss India, country billion people disastrous lockdown, don’t know you’re trying discuss. I'm honestly genuinely curious see state things come winter. Bars run glasses peak hours. Sometimes go plastic cups. Yeah, protests major cause Twin Cities Chicago would also popping right now. Yes, CA county too. Anything greater 3 people treated cluster. polio vaccine catch Elvis publicized getting one. Elvis needs come hiding wearing mask. Maybe sent mobile hospital back soon. maybe request keep time awhile. WA State governor Jay Inslee, several days cases spiking around Washington State, announced he's implementing mandatory mask policy public places.

Naturally, entire social ecosystem back home Eastern Washington pretending like he's declaring Martial Law taking away everyone's rights. utterly insane. home county reported 1,000 new cases single day, order get phase 2, need less 170 cases/day *for 2 straight weeks*.

I cannot comprehend people feel like simple task like wearing cloth mask face public burdensome *political* ploy. cannot. truly dumbest fucking country. Enjoy stagnant economic growth. Oh way, EU already used that. aquaponics workable solution problems? virus schedule anymore. fact, over-ran allotted time-space 15 days. Moving elections campaigning now! No, Google ""covid testing"" city. Call see get tested immediately. Test takes 5 seconds. They'll push swab way nose. Uncomfortable quick results come quickly. 
This something play around with. Go.  ever heard alert fatigue understand studies showing protests (masked outdoors) causing many cases. 

but course, blame blacks/progressives lying, fucking lie. anybody think imaginary credit score! best conjecture still conjecture. would speculate one way another point. one sending anything recommendations. claimed everybody could tested. fair, you’re caught three times, deserve die, right? Right?? Like one dude Texas didn’t want pay bills total sum ""around $230"" got life sentence. happen 2008 sub prime mortgage catastrophe happened? answer places sign posted stating maximum occupancy enforced. subway (sandwich shop) next house sign stating maximum occupancy 25 people. place small, 15 people guarantee would standing top other. 

Oh Subway employees location also wearing masks. there's also that. pretty horrific. another great, modern example America needs stop investing prison industrial complex move investing communities instead. Give people means avoid prison first place shit (prisons) becomes mostly unnecessary. ""In country, including areas heavily impacted, prevalence SARS-CoV-2 antibody expected low, ranging less 5% 25%, testing point might result relatively false positive results fewer false-negative results,"" CDC said. higher sensitivity, fewer false negatives test give. higher specificity, fewer false positives. Across populations, tests give accurate results disease tested common population. little evidence whether infected gives people immunity later infection, doctors worry people behave immune get positive antibody test. ""It cannot assumed individuals truly positive antibody test results protected future infection,"" CDC said updated said anything remotely close ""tests always useless."" applies Sweden ABSOLUTE accuracy. don’t support lockdown national scale, given states like NY well, support state level. Florida Texas NEED one right now. everyone entitled fucking child. love guy bashed everyone huge double take.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

In short, trying stop people information what's going on. Oh fucking absolute bullshit ahahahah sub become propaganda outlet nothing else. Fuck mods piece shit automod Let know get part send Gene's keyboard FBI world goes back ""normal"" Trump’s rally indoors almost nobody wore masks. fuck tweeted [several tweets claiming state’s health department officials **instructed change delete numbers Covid-19 cases deaths** make looks like “Florida improving next week leadup July 4."" Friend mine 20s got virus. health issues precovid. hospitalized, blood clots lungs, blood thinners year. survived got scary road recovery long. Thanks :) group us crunch numbers day /r/CoronavirusAZ like join us. Everything like CA closed right now. Stay home, go grocery store wearing mask. That's it. That's life CA right now. test, numbers go up. Brilliant! read yesterday children's hospitals started admitting adults hospitals full. can't understand government sit back nothing, people ignore face I'm one small percentage people city left wearing mask. people come across pretending virus somehow longer exists. chance majority Americans wear masks. hope rest world follows EU's idea banning travel Americans countries time being. lag time testing upwards one week, believe quite bit variance. free test public testing site Florida waited results. took exactly week make report. 

These positive tests came back yesterday. find results here: [http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/\_partners/action/report\_archive/state/state\_reports\_latest.pdf](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/action/report_archive/state/state_reports_latest.pdf) shall subject rabbit hole tonight I'm done work. [Median time infection symptoms 5 I'm rather sure high precision. 

[4 days symptoms hospitalizion one study. far cry 8 paper says 7 days hospitalizion paper back March read 8 18 days symptom onset hospitalization/ death, can't find now. Something newer would better. 

Hospitalization choice, time vary location. get symptoms probably hospitalized immediately, society afford old data non-Wuhan China. 11 days onset ICU (=16), 7 days ICU death (=23). close numbers I've using, though appear paper. guess thinking difference hospitalizion ICU admission, though. also think timetable high deaths deaths occurring outside hospital, might many half them, probably much faster. maybe since we're keeping nursing homes now, people would die quickly protected. 

So, yeah, numbers high, nowhere near precise I've said. would nice see study May June US, since ICU practices changed significantly. This, plus instructions mask hygiene everywhere. given Americans educated developed world, information made clear, simple adamant. drinks stronger would've killed virus must doctorate mathematics - brilliant!

Spoiler alert - hitting 10 million Sunday, 11 million Sunday that. Please send dues projection hit 12 million cases True. moght virus live with. Sure makes 2.13 hour, makes living salary tips skirt system claim them. course first complain unemployment useless. get back percentage pay in. Servers can't ways. facts back said? Dismaland Brooklyn police arrested 40 people social distancing violations, 35 black.

Just wait race realists start parroting ""statistics"" saying black people make 87.5% social distancing violations despite 17% population.

It's amazing utterly fucked skewed make data look want to.

1) cops racial biases certainly played part issuing citations to.
2) biases cops patrol also plays big part gets cited. amazing wealthy neighborhoods there's drug crimes...and also cops. many kids highschool drugs selling them, police hanging schools student parking lot 5x bigger teachers' lot filled Audi BMWs.
3) 17% total US population black, Brooklyn much higher...so even part accurate. mom lives small town said, “If going get it, would gotten now.” 

HOW, MOTHER?!? 50 cases town, barely went months, you’re interacting people first time, without wearing mask bought you. I’m going guess TIME going you’ll get it. 

Christmas going fun.  carbon filters even equal, simple im afraid appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* fully enforced lock 2-3 weeks nationwide. Essential workers meant utilities, first responders, medical providers etc. Also mask gloves enforced grocery stores. If? much spike according them? direct democracy vote kind decision. cares 90% American's said want break lockdown. make sense degree enough probably different levels based geographic density. Montana need much lower percentage antibodies NYC.

This number going important US early next year. said would vote tree desperate am. No, South Carolina really much winter say cause uptick flu related illnesses every year much fact. Sometimes forgot mask go take trash, try hold breath occasion lol. Plenty others complex without anything. Pretty sure asking patrons share glasses serious health code violation (or least pandemic).

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Sad That's crazy o2 levels. get worried drops lower 98 research imply went protests increasingly become infected. Rather implied people may gotten virus protests, equal number people stayed home social distanced due protesting offset increased infection protests. 

This article may make people think safe break social distancing protestors get sick, article implies flaired warn people want anyone thinking that. appreciate it, though engineer works home, wife doc far busy much anything like that. pandemic, she’s always plate think healthy.

She get training med school residency though, she’s blind. big corporate landlords don’t mind letting properties go back bank become abandoned either. Write off, dissolve company start new one. Big corps lots ways offload losses generally dgaf human beings. IDK: Tell parents bury healthy vibrant child he/she go school. really worth risk? think not. Definitely intent.

I saying NY NJ CT, doing. find horrifying *have to* resort actions first place. people falling ill sure 'magically' disappear. advisory? basically means nothing done. smoke mirrors give appearance action actually taken. another day great ol' US A. already three candidates Phase III trials, last stage testing. several Phase reason optimistic. first began wife started making masks coworkers. never really done much sewing machine whole time work lockdown non-stop made masks 60 handmade masks ready go family co-workers went back work. 

Since wearing handmade masks people stopped public time asked got tell wife made them. immediate response always much selling for? tell no, sale, look faces fucking priceless. confirmed thing well, people used told know act react fact. Personally find fucking disgusting hilarious. 

**NO**

Get used hearing that. comment isn’t good look bro declare war Coronavirus, plenty money whatever need do. address issue afraid continue spread kill people, causes shutdowns? People aren’t afraid dying too... saying people die welcome sacrifices get back normal life? NY (Queens) everyone wears mask indoors outdoors streets outdoor bars look like Mardi Gras. protests going see comes roaring back. NY might developed immunity hit fare first. It’s guessing game right worse March? forget throw tasty exponential growth indicators! think model countries citizens lockdown. 

Leaving things open could also effect economy well. decent amount business got sick business would close. Shipping wearhouse multiple workers couple weeks, truck drivers/dispatchers get sick couple weeks, grocery store workers out, office full payroll people, etc hard train replace certain jobs. think people get hospitalized gain bunch medical debt. People lots debt go spend money. Also consumers get scared spend money own. included 97% according article:

“The TMC's latest report incorporated ICU admission numbers seven affiliate hospitals Houston area: CHI St. Luke's Health, Harris Health System, Houston Methodist, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Hermann, Texas Children's Hospital University Texas Medical Branch.“ words Rob Schneider Waterboy...

Oh no! suck again! anaedotal cases. many. Seems exception, rather rule. strongly implies there's way attain herd immunity. Listen carefully press conferences ...he constantly. Nothing bad ever Cuomo’s fault, anything good doing. Exactly take well. Perhaps overly cautious, I'd rather stay safe. 70% amount ethanol needed.

Most people shots Everclear Bacardi 151. Soon I’ll getting work; life essential worker. fear articles fail mention CDC recently improved accuracy clarifying data reported states. One clue new ""Covid Data Tracker"" delineates 2.3 million ""cases"" 2.8 million ""tests."" sounds, ~20% positive ""tests"" reported multiples. matches FL DoH reporting, 25% ""tests"" ""cases."" People get tested positive get tested average 4 times initial test, driving 'positive' count. 

Also, overwhelming number, least 1.8% ""cases"" probables. states may reported they're defining case probable, ones total 40,872 2,302,302 listed cases. counts cases serology. 35% would prefer die kill others. That's lower expected. old hypothesis, move bub guess what? hear every case someone young dies.

Hundreds old people number reported, every young person gets article picture.

So like known along, young people much smaller risk. still true. could die, almost none do. person already much greater risk peers.  Even vaccine, number people required get revaccinated, event immunity short term, huge unlikely happen.

80% people certainly get flu shots 🤷‍♂️ Yeah, mean it’s perfect, don’t check every one, it’s still random enough. mention police funny checked (coming low COVID case country) people Quebec hop plane quarantine... find funny people willing risk lives fiat currency

that currency buys essential things like food, suppiles, shelter. go ahead continue outraged echo chamber. mean possible we'll see delayed spike current spikes I'm pretty certain current spikes related protests.

Close contact
Prolonged contact
Night protests
Chanting
Yelling
Haphazard mask usage
Vulnerable population 

It’s continuum infection, masks, direct sunlight breezes help reduce infection, lack social distancing, yelling, increased vulnerability black community, prolonged contact increase risk infection.

Protests shouldn’t happening now.

Shitty say it’s said often, legit right isn’t time.

It’s time stupid poorly masked rallies churches arenas either, continuum reasonable I’d go protests, it’s time that.  think tons extra people dying .. nobody anywhere reporting it? kills many seemingly intelligent people buy bs make excuses him. 

When came light disinfect cures, WH said joking about, nurse say referring actual light therapy that's used. wanted ask knows meant vs actual WH statement, worth it. responses predictable. required masks two *months* ago?

Ftfy Ofcourse, mean look general population odds someone sits reddit fear mongering “way out” plan probably doesn’t socialise go much normal person. jealousy thing, knowing peers go out, meet people, can’t lockdown little affect life means go forever like this. 

How young people starting relationship, starting families. safe? thing won’t go away we’ve seen coronavirus’. takes one person start whole thing again, literally 1 infect thousands. may soon learn it’ll another illness humans deal with, like cancer, best treat it.  It’s literally president said two weeks ago. agree ridiculous. need both, case one successful. high rates production. No, darker persons skin, less vitamin absorb sun.

Heaven forbid get hospitalized, else might lose luxuries paying sickness caught people selfish. Grow up, fucks sake, better. one, always getting pointless fights de Blasio needlessly confusing people.

He got really mad threw fit suggested New York quarantined like Wuhan order slow spread.

He downplayed outbreak beginning, said real danger New York “we best healthcare system world” New York. claimed outbreak response would coordinated quick, messy slow.

And New York better metrics disease gone first wave here. still far worst outbreak states. see. Makes sense 6000 new cases yesterday 5000 new cases day that, percentage tests coming back positive steady around 5% according  look like things getting worse. ZOMBIES sitting great company countries never able properly contain virus others (even late) took shit seriously controlled, measured approach returning normalcy. thanks dear leader, evn larger amounts idiots shouting ""herd immunity!!1"" probably 95% can't even define properly. South Southwest don’t get much regards winter. sarcasm, hence eye roll. business right refuse service reason, yes includes wearing mask. I'm opposed stores requiring masks (even though think dumb).

You clue I'm talking embarrassing yourself. Viruses sufficiently deadly; can't herd immunity.

Viruses destroy immune system (HIV); can't herd immunity.

Viruses hide become latent human body; Herpes Simplex, can't herd immunity.

(but. . . Herpes Zoster, shingles chickenpox virus, since vaccine, could gain herd immunity)

Viruses infectious - get widespread infection, can't get herd immunity.

Viruses mutate lot, reservoirs among animal population get repeated crossover, like influenza, can't get herd immunity. Even vaccine.  (you technically get herd immunity - virus variant).

The best example human coronaviruses, linked common cold. looks viruses going work similarly influenza - nobody knows rapidly mutate crossover animals. SARS, SARS2, pretty indicative took 20 years mutate SARS. possible may build herd immunity - VACCINE, may run mutant variants cross humans every 20 years so. waiting available properly trained nurse. Tremendous idea makes sense though. Testing funding done state level, federal. Um, already implemented? seems like bad idea implement reach capacity. possibly. Prob 10-14 days would guess. Despite laws distancing masks nobody it. 

Of course that’s guess Disney ignorant government officials. play long game, know bad reopening worse postponed reopening. 
They've hired global experts putting layers top layers safety precautions, think there's chance going south, they'll postpone. goal get back open federal unemployment runs July 31st, hesitate push back. know far less know virus. Long term effects yet studied. Careful boss. want see r/agedlikemilk. Yeah mean variations like could attributed single nursing home something like that. know purdue general population Tippecanoe seemed pretty low. Dismay Park Severity viral infection, number cases. DURRRRRR. 

&amp;#x200B;

Learn read. gives fuck number cases? Deaths anyway, granny safe, unless dies flu months anyway. 13 sites provided extra 30 days original transition date May, personally spoke Governors 5 states involved, and/or leadership designees, agreed appropriate time transition original 13 sites thousands new testing options.”

I've never heard bullshit. Fucking moron map slightly misleading. 50% increase state low daily cases still manageable number. Michigan example low hundreds last week. single outbreak detected robust contact tracing team found 22 cases alone. week, around 300 daily cases. large change numberically, far indicates flattening worst looking trend lines.

That said, need stay vigillant. quickly turn rise careful. state red, worried. state went light green red, cautious, panic yet.   Climate borderline unbearable here. Pollen rife (I'm quite allergic), heat humidity killers. Rain alternates barely sprinkling downright flooding. Snow almost obsolete.

Change opinion. Yup. Get ready trickle chaos plays out. consequences situation vast foreseeable. Compared US taken whole, state small. well good, majority clots pulmonary found lungs. Also, they're DVTs anywhere. someone died clot heart, likely would find autopsy able 100 percent correlate back covid. Also likely people suffering covid they're sick sedentary. 

Now, back question. someone dies cardiac event, certain covid? person complaining counting opinion unless 100 percent evident, counted. long legally country legal job get sick pay. filling brother driving uber-eats-mobile sick get paid. guy back washing dishes cash gets sick pay either work, family eat home.

When hospital staff overwhelmed ask populous take measures control spread, ignored still help people. much different Canada provinces.

Though think lot mentality people area response government (60/40). Ontario's government pretty good job jumping right away people give shit. Quebec failed horribly counts send military work private home care facilities nurses walked away letting old people die...

All BC almost eliminated Corona virus province tremendously well great response government people rallied behind took shit seriously. Even New York Times article Health Minister BC amazingly well done. Dr. Bonnie Henry become almost like celebrity home city lol Oh well fuck then. *“It’s become rights vs. rights,” said. “Some leave. argue. put begrudgingly.”* 

That total BS argument private establishment right make whatever restrictions want (within reason). want require every customer wear tutu... that's right business. White House said they’ll stop funding 7 test centers Texas, see numbers go soon.

I meant numbers new covid cases course, number dead ppl. point legal actions taken people like Abbott negligence matter? surprise likely possessed high affinity human cell targets since least 2013.

I'd love able flick back chapter ends up. Yeah know more. novel virus learn every day. Fomite transmission possible extremely unlikely, enough virus transferred surface surface dies quickly. Although want keep wiping packages means do!

However, mostly passed droplets, mask wont protect others, protect others you, also spending time enclosed spaces infected people dangerous East coast Virginia north. Florida. Yeah, Colorado we're pretty good. Less 150 cases day. Everytime go store see 90 people wearing masks. I'm sure govenors close business, mandate necessary wear mask public? live Richland also.

Everything shutdown state moneyless wasteland. Good Ramen sales jump! Exactly, second lockdown would end economic system. Everyone game lock eradicate virus long stable life come back done Thank North Carolina Dum Dums wearing masks. stupid fuckers.

A dear friend mine NY died yesterday (cancer). brothers growing up. live NC.

I speak funeral NJ Friday. parents asked early morning. can't go. NY/NJ/CT labeling state (and others) high risk. I'd subject quarantine showed NYC.

Why? **Because ignorant anti-science ""taking away freedom"" ""mask freedom muzzle"" assholes NC refused wear masks, refused willingly socially isolate. numbers go up. stupid simple minded fuckers think sitting top church somehow jammed subway car.** 

Which --- well, fuck guys, want kill yourselves, it.  problem I've self isolating since end Feb, wear mask I'm out.

But now, shithead population seen high risk NY NJ, can't go - need - without subject quarantine.

I'm angry, dealing grief, want see dear friend respectfully buried. can't. We're part world shouting ""THE BRAKES! HIT BRAKES!"" Still super rare. Statistically kids danger flu Welcome Pandemic 2.0.

Also TMC definitely outlier. It’s one advanced hospitals world people come world.  I’m buying shit that’s necessary feel safe so! don’t understand? posted wrong thread. meant post article simply high percent cases younger people. didn’t understand significance without comparison timeline. 

I completely agree it’s horrible sign percent positives increasing. I’m sorry added confusion. accident I’ve edited post reflect prevent confusion. 

Thanks replying could fix error! Happened Michigan too. 92 year old man family refused admittance several hospitals sent triage nursing home infect others die.  That’s one knew anything disease - there’s understand figure things easier states follow lead - everyone else straight month lead deal Covid nah let’s trust Facebook decorated scientists Bit weird jump word delusional don’t think...?

Yeh didn’t refute death rate read said. Even without criticising test rates, main criticism lies *infection rates*. said reason looped back death rates.

I deliberately ignoring fact US testing rate laughably low, [it’s lower Belarus fucks 

So let’s pretend US rates accurate likely much, much worse numbers sharing.

But want read comment again, criticism high infection rates (which much easier control large country like US) directly impacted poor regard govt.

Like said infection rates per capita [much higher Jesus Christ. like fucking landfill. wrong. country screwed. Vaccines treat infected. gets point death rate go way up. get car wreck need medical help there... yeah, really want see medical services get overwhelmed. right, misremembered, edited original post Yep! lived FL 4 years friends family live there. post pictures groups 20 people hanging bars beaches hanging it’s like...COVID who? picked Florida/TX trick logging covid deaths pneumonia yet. Here's California's latest case/death chart, plus running 7-day look good.  rate, time infect enough herd immunity first acquired need booster infection suspect.

MURDER. Fuck off, Swedish pro-eugenics troll. One difference situation worsens, California impose restrictions citizens. already shown willingness so. watch people die like states. anyone know Florida provides break ages? Well duh, else expected play out? NV here. actually really good track record keeping curve casinos demanded open. Casinos open we're seeing horrifying rise COVID cases. really disgusting businesses give shit human life. going lean toward bad national leadership explain one. traditional vaccines based weakened modified form virus, parts it, Imperial vaccine based new approach, using synthetic strands genetic code, called RNA, mimic injected muscle, RNA self-amplifies - generating copies - instructs body's cells make copies spike protein found outside virus. Well Floridaman’s coffee, vice versa). fair, it’s winter time there. Alberta, lived 35 years actually. 

Last week Edmonton Calgary opened drop testing clinic open asymptomatic people. Prior last week indeed online assessment, still recommended testing outside two clinics. could predicted this? /s Calling now... gonna get hit meteor 2021. Cant wait hear Joe “masks bitches” Rogan make excuse one. hate people. fucking SOCIOPATHS enabled arrogant, narcissistic, wanna-be dictator want tell us do. course I’m gonna wear mask fucking idiot. LA County populous county, early spread virus, that's much surprise - question is: county ahead LA this? thought LA County leading time now. 

While numbers good, I'd note LA County also ton testing actual statistics case rate per 100,000 people deaths/cases certainly better hotspots. governor California ruled shutdowns closures outbreaks continue rise. possible unlikely, average incubation period 5 days 97.5% patients ever symptoms symptoms day live Houston honestly situation depressing, top shithead Abbott nerve blame millennials gen-z like he's one fucking opened state first place. Full mask compliance , social distancing possible, proper hygiene, diligent cleanliness public spaces, extensive testing shown thats needed places like South Korea. lockdown wasnt even necessary theyve 500 deaths.

The lockdown mostly necessary, view, lack testing. idea virus couldnt test hardly anyone. instead identifying actual cases isolating them, like SK, isolate everyone ruin economy.

So people blamed lockdown instead blaming CDC screwing testing. mess. Easy. factors handling pandemic travel ban PRC.

Mask usage, social distance interactions, hygiene, willingness comply government mandates, etc.

You're looking tree missing forest. divide states grows. Already huge gap politically. expect rest northeast follow suit restrictions. Roy Cooper North Carolina hospitalization rates meaningful?... check mail coming sounds like hundred inmates figured submit request got checks mailed them. Thats good. That's point. Seems smarter issue quarantine state starts rising rather wait bad. Looks like adopted president’s playbook, less test magically mean less cases ""Ok yes, 256 hospitalized, portion people required 'hospitalized level care'. real number lower. Onto phase 4""  partner ER nurse front lines since beginning: fuck whoever down-voted this. arguments there. always, none fundamental problems market addressed; cases they've made worse. pandemic absolutely going crater whole fucking thing, question when.  Natural selection FTW  agree saying, neither people studying disease long-term consequences it. important details may aware of:

First off, plenty healthy, young people dying this. I'm aware mostly older people dying, I'd still rather take chance.

Second, new studies coming examining long-term consequences infection, include: permanent damage lungs, nervous system, immune system, kidneys well emotional problems (depression, anxiety). studies emerging, safe say know potential consequences studied further, take years.

I'm young, realize disease likely kill me, really want suffer permanent damage preventable infection rest life. Even that, want infect anyone else cause harm cause premature death. would much rather isolated months/years suffer health difficulties rest life.

If care anyone yourself, please take basic precautions really small inconvenience. Putting mask staying 6 feet away others save lives. Lol anyone read Manufacturing Consent? don’t think home owners get sympathy banks neither One right ~~lockdown~~ election.

I cant say I'm shocked cases rise. agree. find article I'll post link. wear mask

you (beep) (beep) no, many places experiencing 2nd waves. however, still first wave. sound like usual barriers place cross-state move guys. guess logistics next consider. need good reservoir cash, SERIOUSLY winnow belongings (#konmari friend), deal headache putting house market guys own. 

I would say two things: first, completely discount family social connections now, even great, still feel absence. Second, consider something loner-dom, whatever path decide on. Things going get harder society. lone human gets picked predators. wife's mental health great already, unfair expect heavy lifting social life. Picking hobby association showing meetings religiously get community within year, friendships form community. Obviously post-corona plan... keep mind. 

Finally, take vacation ASAP. Get wife house! calm bit, talk seriously future. sounds like long past time so. Good luck,and safe travels. people hoarded toilet paper didn’t go hoard PPE necessary hospitals safely care COVID 19 patients. time honored tradition gathering socially, drinking alcohol, acting irresponsibly, playing explosives weeks! good thing see uptick medical emergencies July 4th celebrations!! dOnT NeEd mAsK really special. fucking doctor, type? GTFO kid. things like make political anti-maskers wear one, hope? I'm glad got defer race spot! 

I've relieved things I've planned cancelled, also - one less thing feel bummed deciding skip. politicians washington intelligent you...😂🤤😢 Wow, last Saturday 30%!   fine, knowledge efficacy treatments used Pitt medical center brave people volunteered trial. 

Thing positively confident vaccine it’s trialled. 

“Cautiously optimistic” best hope stage.  friend mine started working private testing lab US. 8 PCR machines process around 5k tests per day. Like, damn. ""Will spontaneously fade like SARS?""

SARS spontaneously fade. beaten back drastic human effort. Covid-19 spontaneously disappear places like Taiwan, New Zealand others. 

Saying C19 ~might~ disappear US like saying jump 10 story building might land fine. Yeah possible, spontaneous combustion. might randomly explode turn black hole something really relevant.

The rest sober reassuring, medical professionals need time. wish shared positive outlook improved behaviors. rude anything people go fund actually need money something dumb selfish. id never donate Always remember masks eliminate spread. reduce chances, eliminate them. 


The BLM protests consciously chose increase risk transmission cause important enough make worth it. Many people severe cases (discussed article) likely long term effects

It's looking like quite people ""mild"" cases go develop Chronic Fatigue Syndrome... Little Marco becoming Big Boy Marco! quality leadership would made huge difference debacle. hope liberal tears worth it. commenting weight old looks, dare you! humanity? wrong society. truly hope every single one asshats realise ugly are. girl died virus could prevented. nooooo, want throw tantrums like 5 year old wear mask putting others risk. 
p.s. hope haunts you. doctos office public place ? Sure, almost one saying three months ago. still ""do masks work?!"" delusion.

Undertaker may return perform tasks actual undertaker. Eh mine pretty shitty drug alcohol problem I’m teacher district surveying us options “safe return” fall. option safe return. last day mid-March. dangerous attend point last three months, dangerous fall. don’t know best way proceed schooling, feel it’s disingenuous call kind return “safe.” Even it’s right thing do, its’s going filled risk. state tried require masks kids 2 up. quickly changed recommendation including statement masks worn kids mess them. could hear sigh relief daycares preschools happened. turns COVID really like UV light survive outdoor surfaces, air long. get folks wear masks outdoor summer activities could well low risk. Thanks pointing out. missed detail myself. fuck sshit usual, they're shortsighted. way absolutely crush rural areas shit medical facilities.  countries? Nope, true. Congress tends things last minute. urgent, still month left it, focus things. busy dealing police reform right surprised ignore last minute make big show extend it. reach 20k cases day FL? know help millions others faced still facing delayed payments, I'm sure realistic would prepare something like this. Covid worst week history job losses 700,000 great depression. began facing multiple weeks row 5+times that. I'm sure would make sense, even moving forward staff unemployment offices enough people ready handle way could reasonably expected. That’s result Virus weaker. Please read. climbing area Texas still people bitching mandatory mask orders. earlier stimulus stuff something like 18k per American... gave companies.

they give good chunk companies save certain industries, get it.... could budgeted far far 1200 per person individual stimulus/emergency funding.

And yeah, maybe repay 0% 62.5/125k(married) repay 100% 125k/250k(married), simplify everything else, give everyone, claw back taxes later, way people made 20k/month January/Feb lost job still something coming in. repay later get job back Oct/Nov/Dec..... wearing MASK omg sucks. Government levels supporting families like lockdowns.

I see another lockdown functioning without increase assistance. People already burned reserves first time around, choose risk disease guarantee starvation, even reasonable people choose disease. everyone lucky hospital capacity especially emergency services strained also younger ppl die. enough younger ppl need oxygen. dont get time, also bad chances. Doctors specialize certain areas, similar expert Tyrannosaur evolution necessarily expert Dromaeosaur evolution. They’re similar topics, topic. know actual background institutions, important keep mind institution established China mean 100% Chinese. Recall NIH helping fund international research group working directly Wuhan lab study zoonotic people fabricated data whole pandemic.

Look, I'm pro-China slightest understand reticence accept results, equally doubtful medical research coming America (and, truthfully, be, drug companies data-manipulating motherfuckers) reason. One favor police enforcing lockdown could saved 100K lives, also opposed police recklessly killing black people justification. ideas contradictory. What's happening New York California general? big two months ago, now? probably caught convenience store grabbing chips way bar hellllo concerned people dying covid die car accident. Doctors aren’t saying virus weakening. Let’s clear. saying patients coming younger virus running different demographic paired better treatments.  Nobody suggesting virus weaker, least anyone credibility. prefer ""Covfefe-19"" many cases states lock at? Pretty sure Memorial Day weekend also...wait protest numbers start coming article graph showing mortality 60+ people dropping. Bue also explain better treatments. Kids need rise real talk grown ups charge. Teach SLOPES mean graph need protection. trumps entire campaign run spite beginning ratio 26/64 Covid/NonCovid 27/70 today. Could people expected covid tested yet. data also terrible can’t look historical readings though. 

Either way beds used that’s worrisome. could related ""unsustainable"" part. Everyday running filled potentially day can't continue run filled. I'd agree that. went back memorial day. companies going anything per local restrictions. *Folly, thou conquerest, must yield!*

They're deemed ""unsustainable"" reason. this. wonder CHAZ gonna react thought got sick quarantining pressured gov reopen virus wasn’t allowed attack anyone anymore? need protest. Seriously. I’m TX right went pick curbside day restaurant next door shoulder shoulder people partying, see single mask. see everywhere driving past restaurants bars. see maybe 1 20 people grocery store wearing masks. I’m sure protests created spread people know attended said almost everyone wearing masks. 

Blaming everything protests barely time you’d start seeing cases come blatantly biased. community spread cases wouldn’t shown yet- would two weeks now, others infected shown symptoms. Glad one bringing idiots protested getting hair cuts holding AR 15s whatever.

Muh rights! Could give information? hear anything. Please remain civil. Trump handed 9/11, didn’t Cheney side use re-election money dump friends. Trump could’ve used COVID ride WH, played wrong losing it. take advice medical professionals look like hero. could’ve even used COVID justification wall. importance controlling borders prevent pandemics. Could’ve used power Executive Branch get PPE made still grift top look like hero. Instead picked virus every new case death makes look foolish. moment politicized wearing masks lost. Shot front could’ve even used virus reason trade war China. Even could’ve covered misstep dealing COVID. anyone half brain staff could’ve listened would’ve hero thinks least half country. Yup. IIRC certain cities US welcome home parades (or something?) first wave. cities refused hold parades/celebrations whatever. Fast forward cities held parade? Ya lots people died. Thank you. Autocorrect never, ever correct I’ve reading reports they’re hell time contact tracing states. Nobody wants answer phones. positive cash flow tenant isn’t paying? America testing 300,000 day though. friend mine crutches since March. injured leg atrophied take years get back normal strength, ever even get back normal. Basically Italy instead blindsided viral pandemic infant stages, due ignorance/greed/selfishness failure adapt new reality. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* people never emotionally develop past toddler *and don’t mean people actual developmental delays anything like that* Meanwhile testing sites closed America........  one things mentioned put place response “reopen” protests. protests “allowed” government doesn’t authority stop them.   Ireland re-opening fast (actually skipped 1 stage) allow yet. So, seems rather risky. Parasite. I'm sure articles say think do. first talks recalculating mortality rate original estimates everyone knew would go learned infections know about. 

The second one person's opinion based small sample-set hardly scientific study.

The last article talking class viruses called ""coronavirus"" crown-like structures. still one ""SARS-CoV-2"" current outbreak causes COVID19. saying different strains ""SARS-CoV-2"". Now, virus mutating, way makes change mortality rate. least point.

It looks like combining disparate bits information something actually true. could done technology.

But tech companies acted irresponsibly past 15-20 years, nobody US would trust data. covid would eat every meal out. Breakfast lunch dinner every workday.. cost effective shopping cookiing factor time. Also skip meals routinely eat I'm hungry. stayed shape eating light lifting weights.

 imagine eating anymore. Mask mask. honestly cant believe people taking risk. cost astronomical benefit low. testing increasing percentage positive tests remains means virus transmitted nearly exponential rate. China cranking KN95 masks, legit. reason people wear bandanas actual ppe available. late OP. future. didn’t understand. Stop begging start forcing. course doesn’t really matter immunity lasts couple months studies beginning suggest.  reason get colds also happens coronavirus.  Even Fauci thinks US need another lockdown again, little inconsistent times Wait what, that's first I've heard US early. Let’s hope uk follow suit know I'm doctor, run payroll almost 10 years company process sick time everyone tell October February people call sick 10 years months. Usually wouldn’t correct someone easily understand despite error, said coronavirsus like 5 times. virus, virsus. Sorry, made eyes crazy That's funny iv read elsewhere masks really effective, I'm sure help somewhat though.

Also, protest videos, iv seen quiet substantial amount even wearing masks. believe high number people, small area, contribute spike cases. denial. absolutely doubt point Florida obscuring data (especially regard cause death, mixing antibody testing regular testing.) can't absolutely guarantee past pattern behavior still going on, unusual. Particularly comes something seems all-important, like Disney parks opening.  WTF know hopefully day grow learn talk like adult. then, good luck! Lol yes are. That's happens important people act tantrums. Indeed are. making note already things outside normal circumstances. protecting minority, killing minority surprising:


[Viral Trigger Type 1 Try tomorrow? studies cases ""March 8 March 28, 2020"". 1/80 true early stage. Yep, reporting half number PCR tests. Right someone's visit yesterday. Hmm... Boston, 1600 people protested amount got sick average. Wearing masks outside huge effect. US population 330 million. world population 7.8 billion. Drop bucket. We’ll live. fault; tried warn me. take care, internet friend. anyone else reading, handle care pretty disturbing. epidemic momentum, stop suddenly herd immunity threshold reached. Also, total number infections determined multitude factors, instance, much people intermingle, that's major cities lot international domestic human traffic, like London, New York Moscow saw way infections detached locations would pretty cool campaigned write-in candidate. Nope. person nonregard life would take TX GOV says health crisis higher standard MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. would listen Mississippi mechanic legality smoking pot Goetheburg Goetheburg lawyer?

See I'm saying? So? 2020, 2019.

If suggesting offsetting days average simply account week numbering system, even deceptive.

I averaging numbers 146th day 152nd day years, regardless date. equates week 22, 2020. ""apples apples"" comparison.

In fact, account leap years, get slightly different number: 1560 2015-2019 average 1639 2020 total. That's still different numbers stated. least MLB, protocol react positive test, involve shutting whole team league down. According former ISS Commander Chris Hadfield, ""Houston problem"" (or Moscow Tokyo depending control center reigns moment) go-to line think time-stamped starts 13:43 us actually talking movie Apollo 13. Texas, wear damn masks.

You pretend you’re cowboys ya like, mask ya hear. loop here. What's law called? sarcasm? Even take article face value - - there's still tons human rights abuses China.

Do know what's happening Hong Kong? ""uncultured vile rioters intent disturbing peace""? Americans savings. According Governor Abbott yesterday, said still plenty hospitals state. went news interview lie conditions blame. going cause suffering thousands people wants businesses stay open must say, really igneous comment. Including *sustainable* surge capacity, 305 beds available: cant math. *405* beds available think wishful thinking want lockdown continue forever think wouls ideal sounds like upset people talking shit ones took actions killed people. 

The simple fact is.. action people like sheriff ones put people risk. 

That leaves much worse taste mouth. much worse taste seems mild almost unnoticeable. pisses much. I'm 30s live parents 60s ( hard times come up) 
 locked house practically 3 months, everything needed outside house. Mask gloves disinfecting everything. want take even tiniest risk family anyone else.
 Went back work 2 weeks ago retail store. People acting like everything over, less 50% wearing masks, ignoring distancing, works. disgusted humanity, become strongest species ? How? 

 3 months quarantine people can't even handle that. Yeah, don’t see think NZ restrictions “sensible” could applied countries extended period time. Ya, no. go way way way there; like tears-in your-eyes-deep. Go again. Depending test, there's like 30% false negative rate anyway sounds like poorly administered test begin with. flu still killed people time

What even mean statement? contest. Many western countries similar communication ""strategy"" regarding mask wearing (I French know case here): 
At first claimed masks ineffective order discourage hoarders, effort direct stocks toward medical personnel.
Then, soon large quantities masks available, changed discourse acknowledged obvious positive effect wearing masks.

And someone says could honest people that, explained situation, people would disciplined, I'd like say two words : toilet paper. Autocorrect got good one. clamp reopen protestors? Question: can't companies share ""recipe"" countries make vaccines? Lock mother fucker down. Institute UBI lets get second October Revolution going problem states EVERYONE behaving way. Nobody wearing masks. People living normal lives. people aren’t bubble all. seeing news versus seeing window completely different. need kind governed shut down. Herd mentality huge.

EDIT: used wrong their/there Boggles mind folk Twitter writing unfair POC forced wear masks safety risk due heightened profiling decrying ""proof gov care black people"". can't reality, surely wonder feels way AIDS? 

God didn’t create us wear condoms. fucking racist colonialist matter stringent individual taking precautions, society collectively get program safety procedures, chances getting sick grows exponentially higher time goes on. becomes almost guaranteed even stay inside 99% time spread hits certain threshold larger population. power exponential spread.

Why reluctant simple thing peers? radio silence, there's lot reporting fact protests caused spikes cities due fact protesters overall quite cautious wearing facemasks hygiene, protests happened clear proof spread result people taking basic precautions. ask read. 27% Covid patients, normal ICU occupancy 70-80%. capacity expand estimated reach unsustainable levels two weeks would worse clearly weather doesn’t impact completely foreseeable completely avoidable. People give faith humanity desperately need right now. Thank public service ❤️ even confirmed reason recommended using masks earlier general public believed would create shortage healthcare frontline workers. decision based new information magically available, knew beginning. agree masks made available frontline workers, however, communication could much better. However, communication administration haphazard incoherent. People can’t trust govt comes health policies, many ulterior motives. gotta look broader scientific community (not ones US) holistic understanding works, doesn’t. think toeing line much good office rather fired replaced pro-trump quack (see head CDC Robert Redfield)


Fauci even allowed address public anymore says goes trump wants say.  could way worse. feel you. this, put end telehealth. able access healthcare anymore. dangerous thoughts toward myself. watched Newsom’s update today. positivity rate 5.1%. processed 96,000 tests yesterday. reason shut elective procedures. AZ 50% positivity another story. reopening case surge: 2 weeks delay

From case surge death surge: 2-4 weeks delay

I signed petition rename Lee boulevard. Fingers crossed Mattis Boulevard day. ton streets town named generals already; Sherman, Patton, MacArthur. huge street named Robert E Lee? Come on. Lets get priorities straight. far confederacy geographically possible.  solution Florida
http://imgur.com/g2r2oHU rampant hyperbole. BOOM. even hit anything yet, wait till past week comes 10 days people get sicker. We're going make end year. We're going need Emergency Use Authorization frontline workers September. can't allow 50k-100k Americans infected everyday. going Winter. Arkansas before, Texas far worse position right now. also know Arkansas's government defiant TX, heard anything really. Plus, saying lock vacationers cages deny basic human rights. Didn’t people shit brick Florida tried people coming New Jersey / NY misremembering many people testing positive COVID Miami-Dade today’s share positive test results (26%) almost chart county’s daily dashboard saying never gonna financially recover this? need 2 week lockdown reset start gradual reopening masks required. many places lost containment, that's thing help us regain control.

you can't contact trace 5,000+ new people per day, even big state lots contact tracers...there's much mixing among pre-symptomatic people. Y’know, I’m really tired masses doubting scientific community.

SO many people saying vaccine would well year away soonest without taking look work scientists already done kinds viruses. going widely available vaccine March 2021. Yeah, first states shut time. Second follow rules caused states lax others. Actually, 7 states never issued stay home orders response Coronavirus (Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah). mistake made shutting everything time opening early. done everyone else fully shut paid citizens instead paying corporations would fine. everything stupid mess run rich people even tell much banana costs Cowboys wear bandanas keep trail dust out. cowboys. perspective, students originally live 'bannable' states, moving attend schools state? know guy local Bolsanaro there. international arrivals subjected testing, 2-week quarantine hospitals military camps, go testing 1 time confirm negative, another 2 weeks self-quarantine home (with police enforcement) yeah, 28 days quarantine two tests. True true. 
Nothing goes away own. luck blackjack table. We've seen spike cases, number corresponding deaths spiked. either government become competent sub wants admit, becoming less lethal.  Well that’s definitely one way get cases numbers Right.

And know guys free market... Here's good links:

* group hospitals 97% standard ICU capacity. Next ""sustainable"" surge capacity, another 373 beds. ""unsustainable"" surge capacity another 504 beds.

So still wiggle room, they're projected enter unsustainable surge capacity 12 days.

Expect much faster deaths start seriously getting surge capacity quality care starts plummeting overworked hospital staff. Here's I'd do:

1) Continue careful NC, get tested safely it.

2) Plan days buffer funeral, monitor yourself. symptoms go.

3) arrive NY get tested, easy free NY. Quarantine till get results.

Not sure enforcement would responsible course action. event trouble show (hopefully) negative test results. 

Sorry loss. agree said! Infection becomes almost guaranteed even stay inside 99% time wearing n95 masks, spread hits certain threshold larger population. power exponential spread.

What part understand?

Also every region country luxury delivery basic necessity. yup, either wins election hiding problem enough win swing states loses someone else's shit show. worlds destroyed there's recovering industry Doesn’t sound like it, insane. Seems like lot states pretty careless around though. 

Also, clarify, one recently. way this.....I’m they’re actually taking seriously. That's mountain... What's worse longer take get control, less chance people taking seriously, purely boredom. new topic anymore unless someone immediate family dies it, one cares. He’s really milking twitter even learnt type like trump does, perhaps actually 12. 2014-2016 definitely waaay later coordinated effort began. highly recommend giving Dark Money read. Really in-depth analysis money corrupted political system, also decent section dedicated fringe, far-right mode thinking slowly gained enough money power influence completely control conservative party know today. yeah half 7.8 billion live day spend coffee around 2-3 bucks

the US consumer drives world economy fool I’m West Texas numbers trending line rest state. city zero transparency city community spread potential exposure. found Tuesday direct contact someone told tested positive contact tracing. contacted health department wouldn’t test me! Contact lab confirmed case can’t get tested advised continue life normal.... It’s BS! least small part it’s spreading badly. majority think it’s hoax it’s frightening! **X** Doubt commenting, saw post history realized making Halyard mask. UF’s second option, rounded mask? not, would open sharing pattern using? I’m constantly tweaking pattern experimenting hopes find way create better fit.

You’ve definitely got beat. I’m pleated masks, mostly elastic. Sorry came across condescending - figured either making something intricate could possibly helped way. learned sew 3 months ago, far I’ve intimidated try something totally different (like Olson mask). masks 2 layers quilting cotton piece Oly-Fun material act filter... option getting much it’s hot outside. enforced, relies changing behaviour small group honest people follow rules selfish assholes. I'm ready super powers HOSPITAL PATIENTS OUTSIDE PARKING LOT THUS CONCLUDING VIRUS FAKE NEWS LIBERAL MEDIA. Maybe statue 🤔 complication important question often happens. Say, chickenpox lead tissue necrosis, uncommon. Start building savings ones absolutely can’t keep operating capacity government buy loans banks defer payment. Put ban foreclosure give banks choice selling loans government 50 cents dollar holding onto working alternative repayment plan business. testing conducted WTF say 'uncivil'? Give break. deal that. Painful bit unless wear good mask. don’t want catch it. mean still get eyes. They’re saying spread happened protests may balanced less spread stores, restaurants etc. areas riots lot businesses shut curfews place. there’s overall spike cases even though spread protests. New York situations like 5 patients room. Awful. wartime. Would great happens, going distribute this? mess Texas! tell wut I'm freedom-american muh constitution saletalkimbout dangoldobamaman tookRjeeerrrbbbbsssss. soon expected hit market? good news, need one soon. least dialysis, ""lifelong"" becomes 5-10 years average.  understand correctly, even though Texas surging strict lockdown measures effect large portion population either ignoring pandemic thinks complete hoax. accurate? First, saying virus people come. saying lock people cages take away human rights. 

These people coming vacation. equivalencies vacation vs escaping horrible country. 

There many people work industry asking consumers stay home follow rules. many aren’t doing. matter safety health. Many us put lives allowing yahoo come visit. I’m reading text wall. Agree, though could bribed people load apps phones. Half country leaking personal data social media every day. Instead dishing 1200 stimulus checks could offered people 50 bucks Amazon gift card every month keep app running. people anything Amazon gift card. Oakland surrounding area (San Leandro/Hayward) cheaper, lot. mentioned Virginia before, roughly compare NoVA, it’s like difference living Alexandria living Fairfax. cheaper houses found Fairfax doesn’t mean cheap affordable, ya know? really able find data much block, seems like websites said no, really explain effective are. I've using carbon filters ordered Merv13 sheets cut make filters Unfortunately human beings aren’t nuclear powered must go get supplies every often.

Which free wear n95 mask. get things delivered much longer? That’s weekend effect. administration portion publishing death certificates slows weekend, since administrative people don’t work weekends. shower curtain transparent FL data I'm Houston I'm hearing least five ambulances day. yep probably use archive.is web.archive.org keep track state that's close ICU limits show drill data historically. shut likely huge mistake, failed stop spread virus also crippling economy actually ""believed"" *would*, kind thought started protesting month ago essentially signing get it, along everyone else there, leading big spike.

But said, shocking part NY's numbers *dropped* period, counter expecting. Apparently beliefs wrong sometimes. not? illness short term thing

What athletes families stuff. planning quarantined whole season? live state Maine governor done decent job managing virus. anti-maskers calling C word saying F F that. Honestly people stupid. gradually opening economy again, people getting rid masks, governor decided open bars intended June 30. bitching moaning that. Well anti-maskers blame. numbers go way know people events to, totally disregarding masks distancing. prepared folks, people follow guidelines going keep going two tbree years. responsible big spike coming. Children sent home mothers able work economy sink like rock. people country allowed visit countries vacation country well way becoming breeding ground Coronavirus. countries done much better us? works government health experts tell do. U.S. good ole redneck boys girls say ""they can't make that""!! guess infect parents grandparents see die believe flu. ignorant even use Phones Smart Phones research. government embarrassed, every country world government response attempts help citizens. lack unified response killing ou citizens. people tend understand non-medical masks they're good keeping virus (at least compared medical masks), they're pretty good keeping _in_.

You're wearing mask protect yourself, wearing mask protect others _from you_. protected everyone elses masks, own.

A cloth mask helps _a little_ keep infected others, helps _a lot_ keep infecting others.
And exactly important wear one, one idiot refusing wear mask infect ton others, even though _are_ wearing one. Texas point shutdowns flatten curve enough give crematoriums time build surge capacity. much often hindrance help. Indeed could Actually guideline second ""no mass gatherings"", especially large ones last hours risk product number people nearby duration exposure divided nearly *all* participants wear masks, much better none wearing one. mainly protect *others* infected wearer, way around, 10% wearing one enough risk infecting 90%, especially yelling *dramatically* increases risk infecting others intense protesters least likely muffle righteous message true indoor locations riskier. why, least recently, responsible states legally **required** **100%** customers wear mask enter business, **and** limit number allowed inside small fraction fire code limit. Many even directional lanes aisles enforce social distancing. working. ""rules"" protesters, ""guidelines"", one ever followed 6-foot distance rule. Even two feet rare accomplishment, shoulder-to-shoulder.

And 3,000 people crammed one city ""small""? Sure larger ones Texas California, states faring better.

But worst effect public message. Every media outlet nearly every leader universally *praising* abandonment social distancing dismissing risk infection protests. interpreted way except social distancing important reticence health experts publicly discourage spread disease ""it's good cause"", even *encouraging* spread. stark warnings, immeasurable sacrifice American people sake social distancing nearly four tortuous months, health experts said ""actually important South America winter now? Southern hemisphere winter northern hemisphere summer... kill people, causes shutdowns?

You know death curve downtrending right? saying people die welcome sacrifices get back normal life?

I'm saying notion requiring healthy people wear mask vaccine introduced ridiculous. GA rise ~2k new cases per day. gave order long ago starting July 1st, zero capacity limitations restaurants, movie theaters, concert venues. opened state entirely yet back peddle address today ‘staying vigilante COVID-19 fight’. It’s matter time tbh Yeah agree, responding seemed like poster arguing Canadian lockdown extremely financially straining. could manage first fairly well 2nd lockdown compound pain significantly. obviously worthwhile since health trumps all. friend's wife posted article saying daily deaths dropped 90% last days see numbers CDC site match claim. dramatic drop cases skyrocketing? need ppl like Thanks link. great read! non-amp idea picked up, where? problem put measures place start working, people start thinking ""It's control now"", without regard *why* control. throw safeguards go [suprised suddenly virus makes resurgence. Better get COVID today there's still room hospital! Ya remember reading article this. article month old sit screened, heated outdoor gazebo gathering 12 birch wood 8 p.m. first cut summer hay harvesting early squash waxing gibbous moon, get coronavirus? Well, know tell you. Houston legitimately home world class medical care. Mayo Clinic, John Hopkins tier. Well yes. heads agencies nordic countries want lock either, overruled. illegal Sweden. he's kind right, even though measures would probably way drastic could run back concern US many places well roommate like this. perfectly fine never leaving house ever again. little creepy tbh nice concern trolling used look there, something numbers delayed 2 weeks. look Woldometers now. Altho Sundays big drop even Worldometers. Close, I’m Bucks - 99% people I’ve seen stores masks on, 100% stores signs saying can’t come without mask, think that’s good thing don’t want see people take foot gas come Friday. 

Philly? Totally different story. tried. someone call victim media choosing go out. Surge capacity expected overwhelmed twelve graphs, “Warning” means “We warning *today* 14 days fked.” want “liberal” math, it’s today’s count grown 6.3% (current ICU admission growth rate) 14 days: 1298 *1.063^13 = 2872. math may able show bigger number 2800. surely tempered bit different ways Newsom gone handling virus compared governors FL, TX, AZ. requiring masks statewide - outside counties - basically requiring whole time. knows. partial root canal yesterday Houston wont follow completion middle next month. hoping hope appt pushed outbreak. folks FL never really care begin with. Switzerland, charging before? ridiculous.

Have u even thought affects keeping children systematic education long? Clearly not.. there’s roughly 133 viruses human circulation one point, ALIVE there’s change you’ll die something every single day. know Darwin awards could go country. USA great! fantastic leader, didn’t control outbreak least. Doesn’t talk top disease advisors hasn’t spoken country disease past month.

And places opening contact tracing virus literally unchecked.

Other countries blocking USA traveling entry countries good reason. need minimum 6 week lockdown shot. NY bad, took 3 weeks even peak lockdown, tail decline slow post peak.  ignore source, finished reading it. pointing posting ""______ _____"" bad ""cnn, msnbc"". Past care sides either. political sides run people power money, vs people, vs I. completely right left leaning news fucks up, want try consider right leaning news fucks well. reality focused msnbc, libs, whatever else, getting fucked people voted for. Trump Biden wins election, matter, suck US government. Start holding accountable focus voting whatever believe in. Americans need selfish voting, voting tribalism. really sorry man family. die health care workers really sucks.

This right now. Covid patients can't visitors debated. Yeah, kind shoddy analogy. That’s US. said already vaccinations UK late May That's difference ""possible"" ""probable"". possible hit meteorite falling sky especially probable. good news know masks meant protect others instead person wearing mask? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* imperialism buddies? U/get_a_pet_duck banned need lock old people. majority people affected covid elderly elderly *and* ill *not one, average 2.5 illnesses*, would *sufficient causes death* death certificate.

Therefore, look minimise spread places people - namely nursing homes (where majority deaths caused) hospitals.

The significant control measures respect hand hygiene, daily cleaning, restricting visitors, testing, isolation infected patients reducing 'double jobbing' staff facilities.

*None* measures require shutting entire countries, closing schools, closing borders, making people redundant, closing businesses enforcing people stay homes, stand 2m apart wear face masks.

We *all above* still managed let virus run rampant nursing homes.

Sweden *none above* still managed let virus run rampant nursing homes.

The one common denominator let virus run rampant nursing homes.  *Well since coronavirus shuts businesses, business open coronavirus must issue.*

Its quite logical ignore facts. true. doesn’t mean mass graves (reasonably) regarded necessity. 

Mass graves thing happened due disease, thing happen due disease. That’s wildly anomalous thing, serves highlight severity current circumstances. 

I feel hyperbolic dishonest here. Multiple southern cities almost certainly going this, given trajectories resistance basic safety measures shown significant portion population. problem 2nd lockdown going need provide people money survive (which US government likely wont 2nd time). there's fact enforcement next impossible (except maybe house parties business's) due lack community trust police. also 2nd lockdown even effective lets say %50 population still met friends. mean bay area example first shutdown still largely shutdown yet curve never flattened. Bay Area flatten curve first shutdown would 2nd shutdown better. Honestly Sweden's herd immunity strategy strategy that's gonna work point. 2 weeks done well lot better 4 weeks lockdown lite. enough symptomatic people infected lockdown show symptoms isolate. really hope US learn last mistakes. doubt though. transfer people might need ICU need it, ones already ICU. bunch heli rides several orders magnitude less expensive shattering businesses. Many people 50 never get MMR vaccine. remember weeks ago everyone criticizing GA including antibody tests results? That's ""more transparent"" dashboard too. immune system total shit. Always been. got mono 4 times kid get vaccinated something, get it. biggest worry since started following covid December. thank you. Well US 4x population Germany, numbers argument illogical nonsensical. put cruise ships make numbers look better.

 admit even surge capacity sustainable 2-3 weeks. happens people longer sustainable? huge home port Los Angeles network warehouses support it. food production garment industry. excuse magnitude cases, always going somewhat worse almost county country.

Nevertheless, infuriates proceeding opening there's penalty face covered. I'm lucky live neighborhood mask-wearing near 100%, even singles walking, damn, could much better. think you’re missing forest trees. China malicious, totalitarian, big brother state still help world large. 

The Uhygyr’s enemy state awful. Chinese also know inextricably linked US trade, culture geopolitical aspirations. country like China attack small minority ethnic group possibly still save billions lives. kinda figured case. expect see big drop kicks back again. ones Covid wiping out? That’s people don’t care anymore. I’ve rejoined majority society going out, eating outside/inside restaurants, hanging friends again. It’s pretty great!  risk death extraordinarily low children disease... approximately 5% sustained mortality rate United States. That’s 1/20 people dead. huge.

Florida population 21.48 million people. runs away there, 1 million potential deaths alone. I'm right you. becomes wonder truly one right thing. I'm bored, children bored, yet see people together. thought 80ish? saying ALL. I'm saying gross gloating right people getting sick. WAY pissed people taking seriously incompetent sociopathic leaders causing needless deaths. upset one thing. Especially I'm power take care loved ones Pulling what? cop know long I’ve state? could lie say I’ve vacation state travel advisory went effect feel sorry guys. government plenty time watch rest world figure out. Gross incompetence. Please, dont re-elect reality TV guy next time. come concise term that. young people (I’m group) coming long term health issues, even mild case. Don’t risk it. Personally know someone healthy athlete passed 31. Go look r/covid19positive want see survivors affected. It’s great. social distance wear masks. Going building unmasked people big risk. matter large portion society refuses to. That's need rules enforcing mask usage. Nice gish gallop go, he'd get infected.

It's everwhere. really sad thing corona die alone. CDC site went around 1200 one day 270 next entire country. figured shady reporting. necessarily. Healthcare worker likely resources available know someone covid protect gear like masks gowns. Truckers rely every place go measures place prevent spread. not, warehouse clerk paper ends spreading covid rest employees work facility. 

Not saying health care workers need vaccine, im saying rest workforce important. quicker everyone public, better. Yeah kid gets shot can't infect someone else bullet wound.

Both reasons children dying zero. Yeppers already done done here. story doesn’t add up. don’t get sick overnight like this. Also, bar limited amount cups? fuck?

Edit: found social media he’s made several posts knowing full well COVID social distancing. trip Rome March cancelled upset it. He’s also asking sorts types PPP loans “I know times rough...but business help” approach

Edit edit: mentions one posts took TWO days get COVID. goes claim overnight thing. COVID going bar, mentions “hard manual labor” one day drinking next. dude lying. start July based read. Deaths lag behind infections weeks neither conclusions valid. Wait, let get straight? full shit hospital follow protocol nurse wife's hospital? comment explicitly said continued emergent, urgent, urgent elective procedures. I'm sorry world black white things elective not. Obviously hierarchy within considered 'elective' institution. know tho, I'm toilet that's full poop. Oh man, clearly need good flush system clear excess excrement.

Your wife must proud way talk strangers internet. [The Trump admin. plans end federal funding support coronavirus testing sites end 14 day moving average lags.

Florida reported conducting around 28000 tests 5581 positive. equates 19.9% positivity rate testing yesterday. 

Here local news stations showing 14 day moving average positivity rate per 21st 16% positivity rate accounts lower numbers reported time. Additionally testing hasnt really risen updating percentage fairly easy newly reported positive cases. Well it’s happening Except everything opening back again, young folks likely feel invincible take fewer precautions. Important site graphic representation COVID-19 infections/fatalities 2 week periods. Arnt war somewhere middle east right idk friend moving Florida... Going make ""don't catch Rona"" basket goes. issue, I’ll trust common sense anecdotal observations poll.

The fear COVID greatly diminished. suffering lockdowns worn people out. 

People want get back normal. simple spike cases won’t change that. could find Houston ""largest hospital"" list. sound excited keep hospital, transfer hospital unaffected area longer infectious. Ah fuck.

Death% really high covid enough ICUS. Can't bus patients places capacity? think pushback getting sounds like victim-blaming. states Trump administration shitshow. Obviously. comments focused states' actions, massive failure federal government. Wow, share link? California shit hole tell people ""colored"" need masks?

That fair generalization. social justice mean favor - seems frankly nuts. 

Lots weirdness going people respond weird situation.  happens.. watch protests intensify. Instead Wendy's getting burned tv gonna see apt buildings burned down. Evicting millions people asking trouble. People fed longer going take it. Watch whole country go flames. $1200 pathetic stimulus check sent even cover one months rent majority people get disease lungs shredded **PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5)** \-- California man says drove 660 miles Phoenix, hoping see grandpa fighting life hospital.

Joshua Gremminger said extremely close 72-year-old grandpa, Roy Maxfield. ""My grandpa truck driver, got call weekend Arizona, something happened exiting truck, collapsed, something happened,"" said Gremminger.

Gremminger said soon got news Father's Day, packed bags Arizona. said spoke Valleywise nurse plan visit Maxfield Phoenix hospital.

""I called Sunday night make sure would okay, way explained, able stay long everything going least able go say bye case,"" said Gremminger.

When Gremminger finally got hospital, says ***Valleywise*** would let inside grandpa's room. ""I feel like need closure,"" said Gremminger. ""I need peace that.""

Valleywise sent Arizona's Family statement, saying, “Within current visitation policy due COVID-19, virtual visits allowed family members Valleywise Health staff working Mr. Gremminger visit grandfather virtually time.” I'm going stats published CDC, source we're nearing End Times? IRS suck covid lolipop people liberal mean listen science. live LA many people care amount people infected dying, want able go bars restaurants again. way, U.S higher unemployment rate pandemic EU countries:

Nope. cherry-picking data. cherry-pick US states lower unemployment rates make point too. dont think masks end all. especially considering masks dinky cloth masks. Also considering, heard NJ friends everyone follows it. Hmmm. layoffs anything think 14 days enough either. Probably minimum 21 World war different 100 years ago. technology wipe life planet. drastically different game. made story up, work hospital. went downtown last night, place ghost town, however, suburbs full swing.  true everyone type person article know people like person.. Considering size USA, I'd still say top 20 still pretty darn good. Obviously #1, get mean.  rest world (except Brazil), walking bio-bombs. sure think okay even busted lungs. Remember years people thanked Obama things? work president well one way street? said, outright ban testing planning travel? course are. Can't gov. looking like they're FOS, ignorant, baffoons listen/understand health/science experts warned of. buy medical N95 masks place Spain, even gas stations sell them. I’d like add Eastern WA list. They’re maximum capacity Yakima County 

This makes sad. People dying ignorance. Worse? They’re killing people need beds issues related COVID. like Social Workers come defund Police? Well give clear facts? like there's agenda something they'll build type pop large scale icus China UK did. took week multiple 4000+ occupancy temp hospitals UK. ended completely unused exactly hard do.  exactly causing this? covid denying, science denying. rational human can't describe awful realize half country ignorant they're way literally destroying modern civilization. unless get vaccine get one soon, coming without third world war. like fucking Black Mirror episode. attribute ""permanent health issues"" novel virus thats around 3 months? see stupid sound? permanent , cause people dont recover fully? 

Fuck sakes good bronchitis knocks 6 months sometimes. Please post assinine comments pass facts. make internet stupider China definetly padding numbers even better US. used much stricter measures people actually asked them. Also told government bad idea China that's point here. 
The point is: people protest open everything live life normally.

&amp;#x200B;

Nontheless US certainly worst country world handling Covid. Brazil, South american Countries. Russia. African countries... essentially countries Trump called shithole countries. lot worse that's expected. ressources. 


For richest nation world handle situation poorly compared rich nations embarassing. 
But point rich nations also well like UK example. still excuse absolutely incapable dealing situation. clearly never call SAR. big operation puts lot people risk, normal times. Unless Karen's coming going forfeit expectation someone going come help badly functioning lungs throw hypoxia half way mountain, makes sense. Lol forget WWE donations! country (South Africa) literally exactly that. went lockdown, nobody allowed cross provincial lines without good reason (going home wrong place lockdaown started, attending funeral, business related). 

We're starting open bit, traveling provinces still pretty restricted. good thing though one province 60% active cases country, rural provinces barely affected comparison. Pre-existing condition? could also give 1/30,000 chance something happening. People play lotteries chance winning 1/155,000,000. Well, somebody win, odds low.

Humans math badly. odds struck lightening lifetime 1/3,000... know that's 10X dying Covid19 50? can't hide sight hospitals overcrowded patients. lot easier think post information pictures onto international sites within China great firewall. fact sight nowhere seen China means gotten control.  Assuming adult, drive different car without taking driver's ed again?

 this. Fauci et al, literally job find going best deal it. one accept laxity looked like China, really excuse obviously spread cause serious outbreaks multiple countries. worse pay close attention doing, effective not. 

China deal much unknown rest world, went hard it. US? Plenty enough known manage things much better. like America experience Spanish Flu 100 years ago, people wore simple masks. really sad many people dying serious failings American leadership. see made China label it. us have. looking different statistic. death rate website deaths/case deaths/capita.

Please see US outperforming countries listed. Soon Brazil surpass USA worst affected COVID-19 nation cases ballooned July. Mask helpful stay home better can. think eventually will. might start problems. totalled EU figures (though trust Spain's 1) 473 got wrong. included UK that. 

473 * (446/328) = 643 compared USA 863 (if population). US:

- shit healthcare (even shortens life expectancy)
- shit pay
- Americans accept sub standard job benefits like payed holidays, sick leave, maturity leave, ""normal""
- Health insurance tied job
- Fake ""democracy"" ""elect"" (haha) **the 2 right-wing parties again**
- ""Election rigging"" become law (Gerrymandering, PAC's, voter registration, electoral college)
- disguised ""Freedoms""

Now downvote brainwashed American, who, fucking usual, fucking clue! local hospital NY tri state area around 500 admissions time peak.

 Blows mind rest country could learn fact hospitals area actually get freezer trucks bodies. Could taken seriously. prediction could right cases imported neighboring US infections rising higher. NZ sing kumbaya lord closed borders (or 14 day quaratine) virus World years.

Seems people fail realize regions immunity virus spread mega fast like back March. Whether tomorrow, next year 2 years.

I like approach many European countries taking. long run similar Swedish. Basically spread control let economy run.

You want open right amount virus spreading. much increases faster recovery. little businesses people go bankrupt. keep borders open end get herd immunity. vaccine comes along process? Fantastic! doesn't, initial plan get us anyway.

As usual prefer middle-ground. US whatever want approach. NZ lets bunker approach. Sweden might bit open although really screwed elderly homes reason. study looks access quality healthcare combined. think Americans would agree average American’s access healthcare abysmal, don’t know correlated quality healthcare, someone able get it. Could elaborate? BS dude quoted asked question? It’s much likely wife left comes mouth. definitely gray area. happens people take seriously travel over, go hospital treatment potentially expose people? know case like too. Hospitals turn people money. heard chemo patient like that. High risk, travelling state state - rolling town hospital appointment. That's going happen. 

The best thing point people Northeast protect themselves. I'm saving many human lives possible. majority people South hellbent dying taking rest America them, least try save people Whole-Foods-and-yoga states. People write articles understand pandemics work. link work ""I thought said money *wife*!""

Anyone else's dad tell joke 8,000 times kid? No? mine? death rate dropping. really care . Found guy clue statistical sampling works. muslims already dealt Ramadan eid ul-Fitr.

but sort tit tat. muslims deal humans resilient. protests added much outbreak? conservative family admitting covid-19 real they're blaming Black Lives Matter. I’m sorry going this. hope catch break soon. literally care unless dying. Even kid, parent, spouse, sibling, etc. dies change stance. But... money looking forward 2039-2045 then....... Rich people want guinea pigs. instead laughing, go register local UI office. come handy later. guess agree disagree. point normalized people still refusing wear mask. Normalization goes far large number people actually resist wearing mask.  flu mortality rate around 0.1% even CDCs lowest estimate 0.4% COVID talking quadruple risk flu. age groups prospect far far worse. Taking simple precaution mask per CDC significantly reduces risk infection overall population majority people wear one. Guess care grandma grandpa die slow drowning though. goes show scientifically literate. Stop selfish egotistical fuckhead wear goddamn mask. sake, elderly immunocompromised. woman laid 3 months, decided never wearing bra. can't make me. well. I'm still quit, woo-hoo! you? positivity rate around 7-8%.. still hasn’t exploded sharing drinks pandemic?? like drinking glass? Thanks. Listen, care agree not. I've got stuff today. Go ahead reply. Say can't that's I'm responding anymore. effect me. title misleading. even contradicts article. good one. know talking about. WATCH  
  
how Americans naive China? I'm American fucking know better. anything guys WONT believe China? One favorite experts topic calls ""Viral Gravity"" - thing going continue bounce around start closing 50-70% infected range. 

I'd assume everywhere reach point. seen data recent weeks given slow spread, we're probably still 15% infected nationwide US. long way go virus slows substantially. that's case seeing increases everywhere? IL lot protests Chicagoland area, yet continue see lower lower positive test %. NY stuff late, though. stuff prevent spread done TX NY, given literally nothing done NY point. Whereas TX testing, PPE, knowledge people stay home sick, etc. point New York curve, virtually nobody wearing mask. Even CDC saying “no masks”. largest medical center, series hospitals size cities downtown. houston cant handle something one can. approximately 5% sustained mortality rate United States.

Is estimation based laboratory confirmed cases? 1/20 people dead. huge.

And yet 125,000 people died 2,445,000 cases. die. Thanks playing! Yeah mine nothing like that. get call DOH today saying could confirm results phone didn’t internet access. returned call mention procedure exam person phone says two types swab tests less invasive test performed.

Thank posting link, uncomfortable watch. fuck would that? seriously brainwashed? think country largest economy world, measured PPP, kills people reason?  
  
lmao. Maybe missing elective make situation serious, get surgery.

You get measurably worse outcomes waiting situation get serious.

Initial appraisal severity also, frequently, wrong.

There extremely good reasons proactive ""elective"" surgeries. real cost consequence forcing delays many them. Nazis? would beg differ one... VIRUZ WAZ GONE EASTER Exactly ! COVID matter exactly? talking now. past. Nope. *we* failed stop spread virus listening president instead real, literate public servants. That’s gorgeous! Thanks, sure will. Take care. :) lockdown anywhere outside Wuhan. Stop spreading fake news. FFS. WATCH Inside businesses wear masks, (except restaurants), outside don’t. I’d say city maybe 1 5 people wear mask outside 35% America brainwashed idiots... yet 50%+ representation government. masks don’t work. Also one looking you! got scammed. 100% get money back flight happen. Hope comes negative dude brutal lockdown measures outside Wuhan. fuck brutal there's new virus result death? getting free food delivered them. Watch Sweet! Thank this! time told one authorized issue refunds process taking small claims. try tho finally moving refunds instead Vouchers. (I'd rather spend fly someone else stunt). Yeah thought people stopped posting “anecdotes facts” stories hard numbers showed kids don’t really die virus without complications. 

Girl picture obviously unwell. Even virus obesity maybe something else going on. Yes understood, that’s gave range. use percentages correct - read source take them. 

Now, go away confused cretin. second wave better means first wave ended. 100% agree. Telling people something benefit others wrong marketing strategy. Health leaders stressed importance wearing one *personal* protection. (I thought that's called PPE.) [67% jobless workers get paid 100% agree handled improperly. use lies manipulate public, lose trust. told public truth, need people risking lives save yours. Stop retail sales face masks. Required companies capable produce masks assured public would available asap. ok lies manipulation regardless reasoning, fauci fully aware basics repository diseases spread. new information face masks slows spread repository diseases. I'm home w/ family, living 2 elderly people least one at-risk parent. also younger sibling hanging friends throughout this, actually socially distancing whatnot. things back open I'm one 3 states things actually quite well opposed start.

Now people acting like COVID magically disappeared, he's going sharing rides cars straight-up going gatherings/parties, claim outdoor, knows he's telling truth / even so, there's still risk there's drinking etc.

My parents frustrated seems I'm one truly annoyed know do. I'm scared course mainly multiple people house risk, yet seem care them. voice frustration sibling really whatever want walks they've seemingly given think think things ok again.

I know much actually I'm loss. Basically pray one comes contact gets it.. 3 months late better late never. SJWs racial segregation, love shit.

Here's one True.

But still start individuals seeing people wearing masks normalize it.

General Mattis called Texas “cowboy up” wear masks. Problem everyone idea right now, including tons people know nothing LNT trail etiquette first time trying ""one nature."" 

They shit, piss, leave toilet paper everywhere, social distance, require rescues, overall disrespect public lands. 

We can't take care nice things, can't nice things. American way. they'll reopen mitigation measures place cycle repeat. Florida, young people ages 15 34 make 31% cases, 25% early June. believe that’s young people getting tested, young people reckless? Yeah misremembered info, actually less that. 9 customers total wearing masks,13 employees wearing improperly, 2 employees wearing one all. checked note. thanks...its frustrating makes feel sorta hopeless/have control? mean none us yeah.. Trump nothing benefits. unemployment system localized handled States. sure, blame Trump? stupid you? Week 22 week discussed time. numbers Tabell 5. think error comments above, please let know where. not, could refrain calling people liars without backing evidence? educate EVERY SINGLE PERSON mask usage important. people start feel wearing pants public spaces infringes rights?

Completely topic, reminded interview read man attended decades worth Burning Man. asked biggest difference real life life Burning Man is. 

He replied; ""In real world feel pressured wear pants hat. Burning Man feel pressured wear hat pants."" 

As avid festival goer, hit nail head. witnessed 2 naked men top hats accosting man speedo festival. wearing plain speedo makes stand butt naked/covered glitter. 

TL;DR 

You would surprised many people believe forced wear pants infringement rights. included. never glad live IL.. we've really managed well. panicked, pay price. can't get people another ICU start trading people likely die people less likely die. Wuhan. damn idea elsewhere? Watch Yes, California, state bluest country, also getting major surge.

It’s simply every place didn’t get strong wave 1 getting rest us months ago Groceries, doctor, pharmacy me. mask entire time I'm places. Articles like bit reductionistic. articles attribute human behaviour evolution like that. There's much variation across human race! Lots people hate fear groups crowds, yet still manage procreate desire Yes, though unfortunately significant growth like true number tested ratio going start blowing like crazy again. also killing...EVERYONE. like, maybe asshole? Preventable death joke legal? W-shaped recession inbound   survive hope happens. cherry-picking? EU country. US is. point can't compare international organisation nation-states real country federal government. again, wanna live countries fewer job opportunities, nothing stopping taking job across border live near moving different EU country. good rule thumb understand overreacting looking statistics state county. number newfound cases going up/steady, absolutely overreacting. negative trend, still overreacting per capita infection rate high. ya'll innocent... saw many new york plates everywhere March/April... live 500+ miles new york... privileged... go Florida! Brace impact! nitwit governor, hit another record covid cases 5,000. first wave! Wait!!! stuck fcking first wave. silly think everyone actually receiving benefits they're entitled to. unemployment system completely overwhelmed, set volume many people gone without payments  Yes well edited music all. find extremely disturbing believe come warning. read article also linked, suggest it. Take care worried fact quick technologically demanding method making vaccine. benefit means vaccines produced fast globally. downside many vaccines kind side effects. none reported study, larger sample size might unearth serious side effects. Alao, made Chinese variant virus European mutation. researcher confident still works, remain cautious optimism. California worse, daily. informed co worker tested positive 2nd week June. Third confirmed case, site exposure, come since exposed. Scott's best totally worth price. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do work SCFs Fake news. Watch this. 65% employment would love hell visual gave chuckle. Elvis impersonator used see grocery store near house rocking mask everywhere went would definitely start impacting mask usage generally awesome.  people shit 2 months ago said Florida spike taking serious? Cmon fuckers, at. states added ny/nj/ct quarantine list coming days? Amsterdammer here! Born bred ;)

UvA? VU? Either way, need friend show around; give shout! Rand Paul Ted Cruz quickly also come mind. doesn’t seem fair. Three months wait cancer means could kill you. alternative go hospital catch covid sick people waiting rooms. she’s got cancer covid, probably get severely already sick possibly die.  mean, NZ - massively relies tourism - hermetically sealed world vaccine arrives.

Meanwhile China - strictest lockdown - playing whack-a-mole daily.

At point, people going realize trying halt virus globalized world like trying stop tsunami hitting coastline.  Sadly reality often messy things go way want Cycling almost 1000km sounds insane lol Or... here's this, bear know CRAZY! cause another spike stay sheltered government fucking job takes care people disaster without deaths needing spike. new band name.  People laughing situations like like laughing someone carries concealed weapon.

'What? afraid evil doers?!'

Umm, yeah, that's life. Everytime decide leave house rolling dice game called Earth moment, reason, someone could deliberately accidentally kill permanently injure fault own. called proactive.

You laugh someone wearing seatbelt. motorcyclist wearing helmet.

Politics really added insane fuel fire people really think side rather safety people.

Stupids. I've tracking Ohio's data pretty closely. spike small right now--it there. spikes largely coming counties protests them. age range spike 0-39 bulk looking like 20-29. spikes centered around June 13. roughly two weeks protests started. Jokes you, stupid Americans going anywhere either. can't even buy now, way important. whole plan/strategy decades fundamentally wrong many ways unbelievable. experts wrong start finish. Well let’s see . pay people 600 dollars week top state unemployment benefits get ——- return ? 

Whereas least WPA paying someone money least something return society gets benefit. Like paid people pick trash paint houses elderly etc . appear sources -- except maybe last -- vaccines problem. Instead corrupt regulatory regimen births scandals.

Even [the foreign corrupt. president majority leader Senate probably going get argument this. PR president get second stimulus going essential election him. Shocker Oh Jesus go again. too. I'm running money though. curiosity, ever able read single post ever without see ""bUt pRoTeStOrS""? like old story blind man deaf man, blind man hear see deaf man see hear. However together hear see. hometown! 170k people, it’s small. used say “Corona, like beer.” much anymore. try middle ground first? Impose nationally mandatory masks public work. care economy. Lockdown last resort. CHOP they've always encouraged masks. rather see domestic economy collapse? brain dead? split reaction, surprising. People rightfully frustrated unemployment system taking 3+ months get money, made hard people. asked less 3k people! worth two hot squirts. I'm $53 per week $600 runs out. Sending apps day know is. happened America unforgivable. wonder remaining 35% would vote for. whole big ole event yesterday  even arguing, least dude made point. read thread, seem making point contrary, important people keep elective surgeries. 

Spoiler: isn't.  post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Sigh. know train thought strong suit, we'll put dots nice close together, shall we? really enjoy discomfort

Psychopath. That’s terrifying number. even script identical segments local news air... 11 different local news channels... video creepy important part article:

travel advisory applies anyone coming state positive test rate higher 10 per 100,000 residents 7-day rolling average state 10% higher positivity rate 7-day rolling average Oh that’s says article please ban American flag ties? Saying someone likes wearing tie. friend mine lung cancer half lung removed told surgeon wear mask “do nothing anyone”   Even went extreme lock still 2 weeks exponential growth coming matter do. good.  yea mentioned ""The US first spades, next nothing two"" makes sense Depends state. states passing laws restrict schools/hospitals/employers held liable. yesterday's number Could people canceling well? know friend rescheduled trip Disney later year. canceling indefinitely. Australian slang.

American Yank Septic Tank Seppo

I idea slang started how, place I’ve seen mentioned reddit, never heard another Australian say loud. issue is, per say. Sure may completely fine show systems someone come contact after, instance grandparents someone compromised immune system best cause person extremely sick weeks chance pass people helping get sickness. 

I completely understand needing socialize interact others sake mentioned above, please socialize responsibly. make ok here... I’m literally argument speak Redditors another thread, one works hospital trying justify taking calculated risk get haircut potentially spread disease. can’t understand people think. still right thing do. NY also whined time common sense. sack shit know home bodies? People enjoy staying inside hanging out? Sorry I’m misinterpreting comment don’t think life bleak. think definitely part problem, young people spreading around. Recall stories infections spreading churches, salons, barber, etc. 0% young people know go church. welp.. screwed 5489 Israel froze re-opening surge cases. 40% cases linked re-opened schools. 

Swedes clue spreads country dont test enough. Oh yeah. even think that. Also rural people less likely take seriously late. can't even count community responsibility lessen effects. Yes. roommates pressuring come rent money, saying grocery stores hiring. would sign store time, can't even bring go shop? I'm leaving house anything.

Sick feeling like bad guy I'm supposed doing: sitting room alone. Cause dumb fucks gonna dumb fuck? seem remember armed resistance along outright defiance every single action taken governor every governor matter. Maybe cohesive, sane, logical, swift complementary federal response almost us could working again. inevitable. happen. need see close personal. 3 months quarantine people can't even handle that. 

Exactly. *A once-in-a-century pathogen* comes around people can't go without luxuries boozing bar while. already cancelled activities next summer. trips, parties, nothing. suck? fucking course. right thing do, situation changes learn whole lot virus. suppose I'm trying give science medical community chance catch up. COVID-19 1.3B people many living hyper-dense cities towns mix well.

Unfortunately lockdown ended India millions workers returning cities. Could dramatically increase spread.

I’ve praying India. That’s fair extent. hypocrisy right comes try use claims previously dismissed fiction overreach argue protestors shouldn’t out. can’t ways, either incorrect risk there’s reason out. 

There also deep, deep hypocrisy determining limiting options haircut garden project grievous abuse power violation freedoms actual unprovoked violence, curfews, use teargas rubber rounds people exercising rights not. 

If can’t see blatant hypocrisy assume it’s choose look.  agree that, beside point. Survey 2,000 adults. least run Justin Bieber’s Instagram account get actual size group? Granted, I’m fine returning restrictions well That’s thought. that’s i’m talking about. know that. overweight whole childhood finally lost weight doctors looked mom said “your child develop diabetes don’t stop”. people need little bit kinder. she’s child died. she’ll never graduate, get job, get married. it’s sad. going saying “maybe should’ve lost weight” doesn’t change fact she’s gone. obesity problem, point health conditions without insulting girl who’s longer here. there’s kinder way phrase things people choosing too. Hmmm. 44/5,508 next nothing. 

I’ll bet they’re testing everyone tested positive last week spike numbers. frauds. like said ""former...and latter two"", listed three things. least way I'm reading it? family doesn’t believe it’s deadly think it’s like flu there’s nothing worry about. Part hopes get (but don’t die it) take seriously. think wearing masks joke doesn’t work. I’m one wears mask public make fun good luck data likelihood close contact infection Table 3. Ok, live big city $1000 month + ~$1200-$1500 unemployment enough cover bills. Sure South $2500 month enough NYC, LA, Chicago, DC live $2500 month cutting everything essentials life. one talking 35%? *Forgive debt start clean slate like big corporations politicians do.
We’re big fail!* think that's reasonable argument. US death rate appeared quite high NYC peaking. Another reason hospital system overwhelmed. right yet Cuomo shut shit became clear things starting spiral, stayed firm point NY completely demolished curve. 

I dont see Abbott thing even becomes clear to. He'll wait absolutely forced it'll way late. risk transmission minimal 50 people outdoors. family kinda right.... Cali shittin bricks rise cases


meanwhile NY trying keep numbers rising Perfectly reasonable focus aid folks whose jobs affected. still job need reason send money. Biden even making public statements? heard jack shit him. call. things really get bad enough might see states shutting even business stop opening. like kindergartener saying ""but jill did"" tell can't eat rock. already national blacklist renters. called credit report. 

They moratoriums rent first place handled paying needed it, everyone, tenants, landlords, banks, would better off. 100% reopenings.

Not millions people shoulder shoulder hours hours hours? odd all. Cases already traced back numerous bars restaurants uptick correspond dates reopenings.

But definitely protests overlapped exactly openings. know virus travels best chilled/cool temperatures mask wearing. exactly conditions restaurants outbreaks seeded.

We know virus easily communicable air close proximity increases infection vectors. *It's flu!*

Even mortality rate much higher flu...it still sounds like worst flu ever. I'm going go ahead pass. guess heard happened New York, then?

Seriously - communication (in vague poetry) would scare shit worked medical system, sole reason basically reads like piece carefully crafted political propaganda. need mandatory speed limit enforcement roads. $300 fine. It’s great way make money selfish assholes.

Edit: woah, inconvenience don’t think necessary? reduce speed limits 10mph across state minimize traffic deaths too. Tampa Cool. read research paper I’ll actually pay attention opinion. ass covering Florida's spiking. forest fire clusterfucks. still trending 200. live galveston used run bar.

The number cancer patients diversion really surprisingly large. UK also tried, work, ended one highest rates deaths per million pop, prime minister hospitalised. Bolsonaro actually believe stuff trying brainwash supporters? I've heard guy basically crazy thinks virus left wing plot destroy dont wear mask outside. need wear one social distancing isnt possible. Walk around neighborhood fine mask. Going store required state, going park path depends busy is. Ok...? don’t live eu. live America good national strategy narrative media. also wondered situation bad despite 2 1/2 months lockdown. lockdown quite strong quite well adhered ... least am. Especially lockdowns 1.0 2.0.

Two thoughts come mind. Firstly perhaps lockdown ended soon .... though difficult maintain. Additionally notice regards lockdown migrant workforce could returned home starting first lockdown. country literally given hours notice.

This brings bigger issue - migrant workers, 10's millions workers living one days salary next, living large cities cases highest. lockdown 3.0 onwards allowed home villages corners country. took COVID metropolitan hotspots every village India.

In ideal world thought provision would given migrant worker, ideally enabling stay were. happen. thoughts here. Americans think US great visit places like Netherlands Sweden realize living like lab rats side pond. partner visa though, closed borders usually refer tourists. definitely difficulties regarding move. least keep inside. freedumb Oh turntables... can. also quarantine states. think culture quite different though (didn’t realise much recently) 9 cases. 

In state (US) we'd happy day single digits deaths, much less new cases. know love shit US, absolutely way half country believes know actually need staff man ICU beds, right? China drafted whole country's Wuhan, NY paid 10k week ICU RNs go help. doubt state get support multiple large cities multiple states dealing time. stopped counting got dozen countries higher per capita testing US. disturbingly like watching Kabuki.

A weird choreographed dance strange gestures sounds relation connection anything actually going around us.

How long till get someone abject idiot governor? deal corruption mostly. mentaly challenged politicians getting old. republicans smart people without speech impediments days? Keep digging cancel save money, cancel political reasons? Uhm... Australia consideri g close borders 2021. feel like headline is bit  misleading, ban already place removed th first July. counts real numbers leading fool stated officially slow testing. 
2 million sick 120.000 dead? end sight bunkerboy cares reelection?
Everyone understood leaving “ member of” aren’t little desperate? 
EU might countries hit hard, don’t situation federalsyour steal stuff counties.

Where get info from? Trump twitters? Like re-started ISIS? re-antagonized previously pacified Iran? continued trade arms government funded 9/11 promised write name really bigly capital city? Big cities Texas going need lots refrigeration semi truck trailers soon bet.   (tiny) Switzerland, central COVID response, 26 them. Thanks response, next part campaign season going news images refrigerator trucks outside morgues sun belt, (if things get really bad) people digging graves public parks. mixed pictures desolate political rallies. It’s almost though he’s trying whole campaign “hard mode”. hate Reddit downvotes think understand dumb statement is. According War Powers Act he's really allowed willy-nilly send military shit. inform Congress tell plans send troops 'go get it' limited amount time Congress shut give declaration war. taken retarded action sent Navy deal fact going vaccine act piracy likely also act war entire world sees us action and, WOW, ruined chances rebuilding burnt bridges probably STILL vaccine rest world gets pay large price since would give us ridiculous tariffs idiocy. congrats single handedly want ruin stand world faster ol Donald has. American. IT. American here. Yep clicked one leading stories time Bojo relaxing restrictions UK. I'm living overseas (in country seeing 20 odd new cases day). elderly parents living UK 250 deaths per day. result loosening restrictions planning join members family travelling across UK weekend. 

Now low risk multiplied 60 million people, going cost people's lives. 

So forgive think positive news story, own. show, hypocritical. Oh sure it’s better $2.13, illegal! I’m trying honest California might pay more, doesn’t mean it’s close livable wage, that’s overall issue, right? actual money doesn’t mean much can’t afford roof head, all; you’d need full time tips get double triple city’s minimum wage afford live here, you’ll probably still least one roommate. 

It’s problem can’t seem solve Bay Area. Sacramento seeing get worse, too, tons places SoCal. work retail. live California, Alameda county specifically. weekend SIP opened allow retail shops open partial capacity long enforce social distancing face coverings. driving buy groceries, witnessed quarter mile long line people waiting enter Ross (discount clothing store). line bunched little regard social distancing.  wary look closely masks bit traffic. 

After little scare, glad see lot grocery nearly empty. hopeful trip would uneventful. guy meat counter (refuse call butcher), stocker dairy, another bread masks on.  current rules require aisles one way, felt like shoppers going opposite direction spite.

I much hope left point. need proof that. meme, reading much thought people using thought women could engage behaviours. no, idiot politicians brought country knees  tried self isolation Australia. many people broke rules. “Plan A, don’t go crowd. Plan B, do, make sure wear mask,” Fauci said Exactly! What?? NYC apocalyptic, bodies piled hospital hallways, dozens morgue trucks overflowing bodies, rotting cadavres half city’s nursing homes. 20k people died 1 month city, that’s really bad. 50% new yorkers know someone died including 3 myself. 
Bro it’s worst thing I’ve ever seen US, makes 9-11 seem severe...it’s media making think it’s bad.

Now similar scenario coming Houston! run code whatever room patient in. I've plenty codes ICU beds (flu season pre covid ect)

You code patient room. get back keep treating ICU bed opens up. I've treat post code patient hours non ICU room situation like this. sucks pain ass like go ""oh they're coding ICU bed start CPR give medications"". killing me. economic benefits getting ahead virus clear day. idiots think pretend it’s happening everything go back normal? Switzerland third world country, classification never really told anything ""good"" country is. even would full lockdown take 2 weeks mimimum see effect that. atleast 2 weeks rapid growth.

GL stay safe. China: Extreme lockdown, quarantining country (forcibly separating covid-positive family members), universal mask wearing, *armed* track trace teams...

Why hard believe got R 1.0 couple weeks Jan/Feb, cat bag started acting, every level government?

To say ""if Americans it, China it"" demonstrates ignorance terrible USA's response was. Testing basically *stalled* six weeks, *still* needs twenty weeks... Lockdowns patchwork protested against... Masks short supply early became political wedge millions refuse use them.

I can't prove Chinese numbers right, *make sense*, given difference actions... damn, i'm sorry you’re safe. Oof Lt Governor Dan Patrick good it! I’ll take experts part time Reddit scientist fairness, Chinese exactly forthcoming info. New York could done better, ton info, even fewer tools Feds refused tests. death toll dramatically dropped. bounces back people take seriously Drinking makes feel better short time, really throws body whack. sober, stress drank away comes back, even pronounced. really good, solid suggestions entertain ways also help balance mood body long haul, respond stress better time. Exercise, meditation, deep breathing, healthy hobbies like making something, cooking healthy meals. know stuff doesn’t sound fun drinking it’s actually fun rewarding something productive healthy. Don’t quarantine save Covid! stay healthy around. believe believe anything. wonder means we’ll get Russians, brazilians americans UK they’ll limited europe options rule applies us due UK still transition period. Oh, won’t sad. angry, probably violent. Australia done that. worked pretty good people allowed stores anywhere homes outside easier avoid them. know job tell people need put mask leave catch without one. We're lucky Governor gave us ok deny service anyone without mask (even though already could). Havent paying attention? Pls original user name belonging average invisible joe: february? Good luck that. Immigrating decent country harder might think. want live EU countries better passport member states. apply visa everything. immigration Europe hard USA, maybe even harder. I’m boat it’s higher percentage think, 80% absurd death toll rises quickly. didn’t understand point question. ignorant differences. Tokyo 1 example, many cities around world large size fairing better American cities.

I trying help point government responses. Federal leadership America ignores early warnings well documented. Yea, think anything could make visit Disney World uncomfortable me. Adding mask would definitely though. Also likelihood getting sick course might flavor joy.... Unfortunately governor won’t let us - even mayor county judge wanted it.  New York 1,607 per million dead

Arizona 190 per million dead.


For life cannot figure Arizona thing New York Lol. Ok?

Meanwhile one paying attention anymore, people arent wearing masks POTUS said completely optional (and surgeon general said werent even effective), people think threat over.

We laughing stock entire world right now, even break. much sympathy dumb ignorant.  Maybe long term plan actually make Mexico build wall pay it. want to. Everyone spent nearly 4 months factoring COVID lives that, result get ""this gonna hurt we're gonna lose time money"".

People want consider anymore. want, many cases *need* things go back normal, simply can't COVID. they're exhausted, undisciplined, irrational, short-sighted, stressed humans always do: they're saying ""fuck it"" putting problem mind pretending exist.

And lot people die society can't accept compromises would take control anymore. failing leadership culture general. think lockdowns started factors it, obviously things like well population maintains distancing, wears masks, etc. mean sending check less one month's rent people enough keep homes bills paid 4 months? would thought? Simply delaying inevitable solve problem? Well, dammit. mean sending check less one month's rent people enough keep homes bills paid 4 months? would thought? Simply delaying inevitable solve problem? Well, dammit. Maybe Florida done virtually nothing stop spread? Maybe denial? Maybe crowded indoor spaces? Possibly crowded outdoor spaces? Maybe lack masks social distancing? 

No... Let's blame something else....
/s makes zero sense

They want money. makes perfect sense. coldhearted, shortsighted, dumb. Great movie. RIP Harry Dean Stanton. went. hair stylist owns salon, works loft. worked balcony, face shield, mask eye protection. alone. 

It risk, I’m safe. truly don’t recommend it, nerve wracking ended going “public” job, fake red hair dark brown roots reaching ears! stylist gave formula little doggy bag, next time. 

Not many people privilege “VIP” service, wouldn’t recommend usual salon. Looks like I'll never get visit cousin Italy. accomplish lifelong dream going backpacking Norway. seeing Circuit du Spa real life. rednecks Karens believe virus real. I'm actually really fucking sad now. Well, hope UK same. Yeah it’s frustrating point visit sub anymore, shit like state governors opinions masks one outside America couldn’t give rats ass about.

This sub clogged US Internal news ridiculous, course there’s big news US post many times hear opinions one UKs county health ministers tho? one coworkers literally turned web cams windows could see fires streets people destroying business fronts.. would make up? think damn shame probably bigger safety concern atm virus Thinking endemic honest, batshit crazy. locking capacity batshit crazy. no, expedite herd immunity helpful degree without tons extra deaths. bat shit crazy approach. typeface used website difficult read. hasn’t complete lack organization. actually successfully flattened curve us hospitals reported reaching 100% capacity according cdc. We’ve also faired better Europe according cases mortality rate combine Western European countries compare us. Good news doesn’t sell I’m sure it’s “It’s flu” comparisons. look responded Ebola. I’m sure Trump would done symptoms pronounced thing killed faster. imagine something contagious Covid deadly Ebola would here. someone take logical steps make conclusion.

If large gathering people, increase risk transmission, people social distancing much should/could be. us knew screwed immoral, lying, cheating scuzzy conman got elected 2016. much “we lived Obama, you’ll live Trump.” we? you, Trump voters? understand man proudly admitted wanting “date” minor child wasn’t kid, makes fun disabled people, clear racist hero so-called evangelicals. It’s pretty low feeling realize you’ve suckered propaganda whole life. germany, manager get‘s you! Absolutely. covid19 exist, they'd alive. Pretty f****** hypocritical though allowing China continue. lies misleading expect country again? Noone read this... gave hand.. refused tried pull us in.. drown idea talking about. Immigrants tell stories “open borders”.
xD yeah shit. let US citizen country either. Right. lived UK France, took advantage location went countries. already traveled world. Pretty obvious know India, etc... enjoyable. hears he’s Karen, first thought molest himself. he’ll complain molested. blame chyna. see 4 months people still fail understand principles behind lockdown everytime sweden involved.

1: lockdowns serve two purposes. One take drastic measures stop ongoing emergency. reduce spread buy time put place procedures control spread.
2: lockdowns temporary every country. None ever said want lockdown forever.
3: setup successful lockdown outbreak cannot control easier locally come back lockdown (see germany)

Many countries europe hard hit, enforced lockdowns, reduced spread, worked put place good monitoring systems, lifted lockdowns.
And valid specific country many examples successful lockdowns.

Now example US somebody enters/exits lockdown early lockdown increase testing contact tracing require masks.. blame job.
To attack lockdown means understand lockdowns work. ... another 🙄. friends invite time tell no. go outside need keep everything clean wear mask. It’s stupid, it’s life saving shit. Houston wake fuck up. -Houstonian Key is: "" Drs. Choe Farzan said they’re nearly certain mutation makes virus spread easily human human. "" said crybaby. Hopefully mean we'll WW3 late 2030s. rather like milk. race future have? economy shit, leaders hate make fun need products aren’t made US. mean Putin doesn’t hate him. Laughs uses doesn’t hate him. disagree. started testing people - including testing symptoms case urgent. point testing people symptoms getting cases, certain exceptions nursing home residents test others. many countries (and need get) testing wide segments population including symptoms. getting positives. Since humanity set settlement Jupiter? Germany expecting downturn -6% -7% year (the worst case estimate months ago -5.4%). Oh forget... church hosted rally magical machine sucked corona air./s not. expect fine. That's normal situation. Bing infected abnormality.  Paris/Texas ? *won't* move continue call posts use type language. NY north eastern United States declining. NY hit really bad they’ve getting control. southern states, like Florida, Texas, Arizona, California rising. many places opening up, people getting sick socializing, virus spreading faster. doesn’t really even matter positive percentage is. Every single additional positive case find good thing, prevent person infecting people. need get ahead it. Every single infected person, even they’re asymptomatic, spread virus kill people around them. Even infected person relatively healthy recovering nicely, people around might immunosuppressants elderly. reason slow testing we’re finding positive cases. rising number new cases identified day shows time slow testing. LA never really went down. protests help. strict mask orders opened slowly. thing stats leadership assertions virus hype. Arizona prep hospital capacity even enough testing.  American society deeply fucked up. posted wrong thread. I’m sorry. comment wasn’t relevant article One America News Network said coronavirus control Texas. Clearly never Florida. Floridians risk 60 days jail daily basis. Hatteras! Gotta stop testing. /s Yes huge problem. I've heard speculated could genetic explanation play. sure buy it, theory goes populations genetically different SE Asia vulnerable. main examples would Native Americans, Native North Americans South Americans Amazon Central America. people relatives living houses essential workers interface public peak infection. uncle works local health department contact tracing proven this.
There undeniable causative correlation lockdown rapid decline infection fatality rates New York state. 
The events unfolding across country Europe moment provide scientific evidence policies correct actions take. entitled formulate opinion version scientific facts. \*is\* absolute madness, yet American thing world. saddest part majority U.S. citizens rightfully rapid reopening, yet loudest voices room a) people who've lost minds follow insane president oblivion allowed \*somehow\* become political rallying cry b) real leaders entire ""democracy"", corporate interests carry water them. Make mistake -- money, always money, politicians (with exceptions rare people like Cuomo, who, say him, least acting like proper steward constituents' lives) stand counts. absolutely disgusting, every possible level. Consuming lot late Republic Rome ancient Greek material recently. things changed 2500 years. Masks fucking suck. wear necessary societal standpoint, also job requires it. work outside hot humid sweaty place mfrs get wet like breathing wet rag. totally normal suspicious know pleased said??0.o

Average people:/ said someone else thread bears explained friend using example hurricane hit somewhere tornado hit place. vice versa. societies handle one time. Together destroy community structure already beat battered first place. may see fall start taking serious. NY, NJ, CT [declared rest March 28, 2020, Washington, DC (CNN) New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday interview CNN believe possible New York quarantine legal would **""federal declaration war""** applies testing positive right? New York, New Jersey Connecticut impose travel advisory 14-day quarantine travelers states high coronavirus infection rates beginning tonight midnight, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. good point. think getting little ""tunnel vision"" around situation (classic American, eh!?). 

Although, address point unlike viruses:

1) Evidence mounting COVID vascular/blood disease, exhibits respiratory symptoms part pathology. knowledge, would first blood disease spread via respiratory methods. mention asymptomatic spread (which Fauci testified unlike anything he's seen 40 years work). respect, really unique unlike anything we've seen yet

2) Form I've read (and could well well educated here), Coronaviruses cause tremendous immune response either, get cold small proximity one another. *The world watching America’s COVID-19 response:*

“America, you’re kind headed towards car lot.”

“Uuuhhhhh...” People saw 20% largest metropolitan area US become infected thought peak. We're seeing looks like 95% population starts see 20% population infected. persist long long time get 70-80% population. stop reporting case numbers people start looking social media posts ICU doctors nurses, unless goes social media censorship rampage information going get think mean Southern Western states...midwestern states cases going down. figure long regular people able get anyway.  time available local urgent care we'll least months distribution medical treatment providers, necessary workers, high-risk people, etc.  I'm pretty sure I'll ready whatever get second wave distribution. China build hospital 2 weeks, Houston.  Well took 3 weeks openings Memorial Day weekend cause increase cases. Whether 2 weeks, 3 weeks, month wait, take crystal ball see cases would go up. reopening happening (as think use masks), hospitalization move closer full capacity. Sure go health workers front line first. nurse running ventilator covid patient much risk trucker. run multi-phase trials original Polio vaccine? long time ago. Yes, small states New York New Jersey, doubt anyone ever even heard them.  [Antibody Dependent They're classed business held requirements open right now. I'm fan fireworks, yeah. Yeah. That's worries bit. Maybe things get bad end second wave? mean that's encouraging but... It’s put way Washington enforced precedent needed. plans enforce regularly even stated that. 

Basically social distancing responsible won’t troubles. dick given fine. 

Sort like crossing street without cross walk. time won’t enforced idiot putting themself others risk hand fine hopes don’t again. Thats good pile solutions miss one important thing.. still part system..

Status quo inside 'willing death defend it' slavery 'This type communication' *everywhere* start. (Trump even fired couple people - urged firing Fauci - bringing up.) reach you, might want reconsider get news from. 

But - grrrr... dammit, giving headache - needs *told* masks help block airborne diseases? Doctors nurses wear masks. Surgeons wear masks. Dentists wear masks. Why? help prevent spread disease. two words there: 'help', 'prevent'. 'wear masks' message started bunch people latched onto word 'prevent', no, mask enough completely *prevent* new infections. *is* going **help* prevent* new infections, next step question 'what *other* things help prevent infections?'

But answers question similarly disregarded people, got politicized, half country started ignoring message disagreed with. we've got people saying never got message. 

You're luck, though: yesterday tests US discovered 34,720 new cases, 4th-highest single-day jump since mid-March. US death rate fairly consistent 4%-5% cases since early April, one every 20-25 new cases die. We're testing ever, throughout April May number tests went number new cases went *down*... like new cases previously-undetected population revealed testing. past month, number tests still going new cases going fast started. get - almost like learned goddam thing past months.

But did: *Wear fucking mask*. prevent infection *only* precaution take, *help* prevent infection. like masks always done. medical community Enemy People misquote him. fair. *actually* said ""slow testing down, please."" joke. Mission Accomplished! ventilators go brrrrrrrr sooo uncomfortable! Also slightly harder breathe! freedoms! Pretty sure that’s happened bible story. whole point god wanted kill everyone except Noah family.

He didn’t want anybody else boat. Yep friend also lands moving tsunami could occur 

powerful tsunami since power earthquake 7.4 Blood clots lead cardiac worry dude everybody knows stop testing virus botch reporting numbers reflect downward trend support opening everything $ start flowing virus magically disappear April year. Ah yeah figured case lot simpler since work U. want hear state makes hard people could true :/  Austin

I’m trying best I’m also nanny family that’s distancing way feels kind futile. don’t really choice though need money Uhmmm economy crashing historic levels good society either. really understand point here. inconvenient wear mask, plus saw someone flunked high school biology post article Facebook claiming masks work make people sicker, go reject information contrary. 

The failure American education system teach critical thinking skills, time, people think skills, amazing. New cases suddently drop 2000 Seeing curve go back unsettling. We're back 30,000 cases now, unfortunately deaths come that. mention states untesting thus underreporting numbers. 

Use tool click yesterday see accurate reflection numbers. shows real time data entered want full day lapse see many cases deaths occured. know they're underreporting Houston (Harris county) reported hospitals 90% ICU capacity yesterday reported 1,374 new cases yesterday, something adding up. seems low considering numbers northern states seeing hospitals reaching capacity (somewhere tune 10,000+ cases day).  must state denial. multiple deaths 20 around country. Sweden unbelievable. country 5th highest death per capita world, still guy guts say ""everyone else"" crazy. swedes agree too. I'm sure 79 people appreciate explanation even want think year even two years even though entirely plausible scenario. US government doesn’t actually authority stop people protesting even wanted to. There’s real excuse things open. No, passports good 10 years. sick respiratory infection back February. husband didn’t let lay flat back made huge difference. Prop husband pillows even he’s sleeping. help cough breathing. addition, drink plenty fluids. covid proverbial straw broke camels back, saying died covid isnt ""fudging"" numbers. Yeah, many people want 1st year resident starting July intubate you? That's another funny thing hospital, since 3m Versaflo PAPR (or PAPR matter) used also unfiltered valve problem it. makes people wearing Versaflo different?

(Truth lot hospital management also idea PAPR works) Yeah stock market fucked end.... inflation gonna kill us... agree. already hard breathe hot humid wearing mask. Can't imagine intense work out. lot customers see planet fitness old fat even worrying high risk. usually stick treadmill area. see increase Adam Altmejds graph? none. 

Gällivare, big superspreader city 8000 inhabitants. Surely least 2000 die. Please run independent.... President Mattis knew would get downvoted. reddit ... biggest echo chamber internet. Take look [this Texas Medical Center (TMC) site projects occupancy surge capacity. 

Interestingly, [this shows current capacity would good one keep eye on.

Also source, monitoring mitigation metrics.

It's real. going get bad Houston. city?
The best thing protect smart. never went away. lockdowns put sleep. taking brief nap. need cross ocean right worst part. Maybe numbers change “your three states” almost 1/2 deaths 48,085 (of 123k)

Pretty sure glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. given raw data asked “idiot” states think looking death totals pretty effective way identify states wrong. country way individualistic information suppression tactic work. People going share anecdotes anecdotes add give us information need figure what’s going on. stated requirements vary province province, province taken ads encouraging everyone get tested? I'm suggesting wearing masks makes go away. helps limit spread prevent overwhelming hospitals need advanced care get it. Jesus Christ sounds horrible, I'm sorry. Normalcy bias. Heres peoples thoughts id day; problem going back lockdown going financially? need provide people relief, course people would like lockdown avoid virus, us literally cannot take financial hit ""And so, smugly commented post, """"The daily cases going back down. can't argue facts.""""

*Five days later*

""When lunchtime arrived, started flipping posts Reddit. post claimed Florida reported record 5,508 new cases 44 new deaths, soon appeared screen. muttered breath, ""*Blyat.*"" Hey, hoping move Amsterdam soon! unfortunately corona derailed plans. How’s feeling city, things returned normal(ish)? one ignore reality, facts, science , experts common sense like current administration.  won’t name impeached individual 1 get comment removed person banned. Yes, interesting world. Take look [this Texas Medical Center (TMC) site projects occupancy surge capacity. 

Interestingly, [this shows current capacity would good one keep eye on.

It's real. going get bad Houston.  10 ply, bud... Well done. Yeah, automod like words ending -ism. keep getting notifications nothing. less cases. got me. I’m pretending anesthesiologist. bow infinite wisdom think totally continue arguing needs resources preventable situation. SJWs tell people ""colored"" need masks?

This insane, wreckless, negligent, racist discriminatory. increase likelihood ""colored"" people SJWs put it, get infected die.

SJWs regressive racist remind KKK

It really makes wonder many people showed Trump rally Phoenix brought virus. mean people type go something like can’t type practiced good social distancing lately.

Edit: 7.3 million Fearmongering again. lung much capable repair rather easily long mostly intact, amazing liver course also remarkable definitely heal scars even holes. said take long time(years) risk getting infected lung related disease time always dangerous one.

New Yorker want Floridians Texans stay away, please. solution? Buy guns! they're never tested virus, never officially it. means illness death *officially* coronavirus number ... There's lots people (non-EU country) got caught pants locked months ago. back home vacation, now, despite pay rent places able go jobs here, allowed back country. Living proof left-wing confer competency.

Who hell would ever argue does? we've witnessed real-time lesson populist morons overwhelmingly incompetent fools.

Amlo, Jair, Donny, BoJo. idiots.

Government serious profession demands competent intelligent managers. Obama one. Romney could've one won. Hillary, detestable would've competent professional. 

There's important things world specific ideology. Especially since world balancing knifes edge age nuclear weapons looming climate catastrophe.  What? There’s going billion doses made probably within months vaccine approved use. huge amount doses funded US taxpayers, research &amp; testing funded public dollars large part. vaccine, hit market, widely available little cost cost many. least US citizens.

At first, however, vaccine administered high-risk situations like hospital staff. I’d imagine time common person spend pretty penny want get vaccine. read awesome quote isaac “There cult ignorance United States, always been,” wrote. “The strain anti-intellectualism constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means ‘my ignorance good knowledge.’”

i think applies well pandemic. great get restaurants barbers open, global business reputation completely tattered time over.

That's false dichotomy. option opening wearing masks keep social distance. Checking temperature people coming stores restaurants. Contact tracing. Lots countries good effect.

But saw many states went back almost-normal behavior, they're surprised cases climbing rapidly. course states doubted virus real hesitated take seriously. wondered would happen since much population US thinks wearing mask political statement. Actions consequences. I’m frustrated US icu nurse! little chance (as in, virtually none) getting disease someone March. think would rather closure mask wearing. Easy counter SAH giving another trillion businesses state's biggest donors. shutdown WoW account bank deposits high levels, opening Safe could lucrative. Exactly. think ability find something internet contradicts every expert field essentially agrees means experts wrong. confusing stance petition? go strike force opening. What’s Disney gonna do, fire hire psychopaths let Disney World reopen, rebrand “Dickhead World”? many places honestly far less issue flu. city double digit confirmed cases single digit active cases still shut entire place 3 months.  best source monitor ICU bed availability within state? sure hope sort thing doesn’t start trending across nation. hospitals fill &amp; cutting funding COVID-19 testing can’t imagine outcome pretty one. oh countries? still happening! they're going think ""Oh Houston"", ""Oh, next county"", then, ""Well, *my* town better neighboring towns!"" could honestly say rest media irresponsibly made concerns pandemic secondary favor hottest new source ratings, caring effect might tried meditation found worked wonders. that, TV video games. Still despicable human friend traveling work lives far me, coming state. Asked meet up.

Maintenance sprays entire building three times day disinfectant. disheartening see one end spectrum, people making physical efforts keep safe around clock -and people drinking hanging together. Here's latest running 7-day US chart COVID deaths:

 second wave yet, worth watching trend line. No

What confused about? article says contact tracing believe anyone infected rally. incredibly sad time. cases proves need widespread testing, idiot believes makes look bad. Yes trying downplay individual losses - anything else matter. re-join UK leave EU? 😂 scam people dying it. horrible media making seem. Yes get sick feel like crap week, people may hospitalized potentially pass away; vast majority recover. say death okay part life us go through. Also Houston went 10 testing sights like 35 obviously positive cases go testing done. necessarily mean worse month ago means lot people getting tested means lot people come positive. aren’t seeing antibody testing positivity rates going more? people get virus, shouldn’t people cumulatively antibodies? percent population experts estimate form immunity? A) know particular disease long latency period therefore first point “as far know...” dead wrong uninformed.

B) compare drinking driving- something else freedom even tho it’s inherently dangerous except fact endangers public health. Would you’re scenario still seem reasonable? 

There rules regulations can’t member society already. You’re told really really care one it’s strange dangerous everyone around you. could everyone take 3 month nap beginning March would solved! criteria able get tested? true caseload skyrocketing it’s possible tests per day even despite restrictive criteria qualify testing.

Here VA btw didn’t learn restrictive criteria tried get tested myself. It’s news &amp; state website - find local testing clinic, call &amp; ask. Good job. Bravo, bravo! Everything dumber Texas. mean bigger, sorry, bigger. Yeah that's it. friend still fever every day, ton symptoms, 100 days infected. Thanks! Seems legit, wouldn’t respect ranking didn’t Boston Children’s Hospital #1 list. Well think good idea go Disney world year I'll taking wait see approach towards next year well, worth mentioning scientists, including fauci said outside mask likely hood becoming infected minimal. However account millions shared touch points place like fuckin Disney World western world cargo cult lockdown. saw Wuhan one copied it, bit without additional supporting measures.

After Wuhan lockdown removed, second spike.

But Western countries, cases spiked relaxations reintroduced. Thus paid economical costs, without actually containing virus. Lose/lose. Texas Medical Center. like city within city. biggest world. people dealing mental health frustrations right now? keep staying inside, ordering stuff contactless pickup wearing mask rare occassions I'm around people. Everyone friend group tells I'm paranoid dumb things. tell completely passed overblown begin there's reason follow restrictions more. What's worse local county commission agrees them. Meanwhile, county highest number new cases we've ever yesterday everyone know seems oblivious this. wearing mentally. knew would happen somewhere Well know work. question order people wear wishes.

If banned cars, numbers people killed traffic accidents would drop zero. would work yeah. that? go get told supplements creatine employees absolutely need all??? Doubtful, money talks. long US dollar reserve currency countries want USD. I’m sure think you’re insignificant big scheme things matter. takes one person spread hundreds. end choice. don’t like agree could get month ago? Source antibody info please. Yeah, guess need start talking CA too, seems Newsome folded pressure reopening. short-sighted, people still furloughs mortgages/evictions/student loans still forbearance. Reopening economy spiking spread going effect incoming economic issues start next year, might well keep people safe strategize. Trying get people eat restaurants fix issue March 2021 I've read comments. either troll total piece shit. media for? bring catastrophes (and things) us lucky enough get personally touched them. strict definition wave ends another one begins still agree you, wave 1.1, wave 2. Birmingham well. Coming perspective young professional, leadership state (and federal let's go there) level problem.

 I've office option WFH since May 1st (we went back normal immediately). We've one person test positive last week (that know about) everything normal. one wears masks desks get halls/common areas 5-20 min day depending often walking around. yet we're breathing circulated air day without masks.

I think without sort leadership employers try push envelope stay open WFH. me, best job I'm going get Southeast field. options suck come in. can't imagine like others. Frankly speaking immigrant living Sweden lived three countries before. Regardless COVID19 approach, crumpling health care system long pandemic never cared it. crisis showed bad is. Houston's (Harris county) latest death/cases chart. 7-day running average deaths. Scary. didn't‽‽‽ allowed leave 2km radius lockdown. would mean perception risks higher Stockholm southern Sweden example? dont think case. CARES Act expanded unemployment Federal benefits temporarily. many states, unemployment benefits low one reasonably pay bills, rent, food, utilities combined. safety net unemployment benefits. safety net also includes healthcare, retirement/disability benefits programs like SNAP, education programs, benefit unexpectedly lose gainful employment encounter life changing health issues. ""it magically disappear ignore it"" tactics quite worked far. many beds use hospital ship NYC? Good offer solution Krystal...


In case wondering one government mandated amount. least regular sick days, believe something done specific covid. 

Most companies I'm familiar offer form paid time off. make use vacation days sick, others separate sick days. Read chart lemmings - ICU 26% COVID patients. remaining non COVID. totally exaggerated. Every person know COVID mild symptoms recovered within 2 days. isn’t contest. It’s one other, sides inadequate politicized it. 

Once leave “but side worse” bubble doesn’t mean anything. extremely rare news crew invited hospital film normal circumstances. GOOD BOY! reminder India currently 11 Covid deaths per million.

That puts #104 world ranking per-capita deaths.

The USA 373 #9.

In India small rate Covid deaths per day, seem changing Glad hear! read NYT article reevaluate situation every 2 weeks. indefinitely might long :) get Rock PSA?  we’re seeing wave countries locked early, didn’t eradicate virus, face true first wave much weaker poorer position. 

This false misleading. places virus exploding right USA, Sweden South America. 

Tell countries lockdown control? achieved destroy ~20% economy people’s livelihoods. 

Just made lie 1 month lockdown would destroy 20% economy.

Corona extremely damaging economies blanket support lockdowns, general “something must done” attitude, abuse vilification people said otherwise sub honestly pretty embarrassing.

You get arttitude invent random things pass facts. 

Just post here, tryed pass 3 complete fabrications fact.

If stopped lying, get respectful answers. People tend respect lies. western countries, real rule free speech peaceful gatherings. protest equal rights also protest reopening nail salons daily garbage removal. double standard agreement difference treatment authorities protests BLM. rightful cause legally give better right protest gather shitty one like nail salons. However, us, one peeped protests hard clampdown others. Ethically yeah course makes sense, legally no
Hence double standard bs frustration. cause holier stfu... great Yes! Let's take geologists granite. Absolutely idiotic thing say. course 35% cases last two weeks. We’re testing ever says bottom people going bars restaurants wearing masks. see everyday. People protest outside wearing masks. Research already proven makes biggest difference. 

Also tried kneeling pandemic everyone told shut dribble also. please tell protest group people supposed protect instead murdering them. Like police reform happen protest keep happening. Interesting! Super preliminary, however, without published research evidence anecdotal best. would Gitmo  also Swede life definitely same. take care mother alone Alzheimer. dare let continue home care put nursing home circumstances.

Even FHM acknowledged missing deaths stats reality 6000 dead now. (They missing 18% according weekly report week 23).

But might high amount deceased main problem. growing number Swedes reporting recover fully descase. 

And 70000 surgeries cancelled due hospitals almost full capacity. Sooner later Sweden deal long term effects letting virus run population. place currently watching carefully Silicon Valley, I'm interested world want move. tech mecca Google, Apple Facebook HQ central Europe - like Berlin, Amsterdam Paris - would huge.

I dont think understand companies 1st place. Resources Talent. guess blm protesters hispanic... Definitely them, though damn good mathematics Grazer! “From population.”

Because masks keep getting people sick. Everyone needs wear work effectively. know, could taken precautions. known. Damn China. it. handled shit terribly  agree more. Americans unity fortitude lock areas rapidly rising rates infection. Less two months ago, threats public order showing oppose closure businesses like nail salons. president encouraged 'Liberate Wisconsin, etc"" tweets.

To effective states like Texas, Arizona Florida, virus spreading exponentially soon, would need lockdowns look like Italy, China Korea used - i.e. complete shutdowns (aside grocers pharmacists), temporary complete cessation travel infected areas (no planes, trains, boats cars), widespread testing contact tracing supervised quarantine. Enough Americans lack strength character withstand measures like make unlikely.

That means virus weeks ahead lead shutdowns politicians implement. enough people sick dying, hospitals overloaded corpses held refrigerated trailers cemeteries crematoria backlogged, people get message isolate themselves. damage economy sharp shutdowns done would. importantly, lack coordinated action states lead suffering death. really. He’s continuously billed government whether ever visited hospital not. happening. Stop spreading bullshit  Results: estimated total 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range \[IQR\] 76,776 - 164,576) mainland China February 29, 2020, highly correlated (p&lt;0.001, R2=0.86) reported incidence. Without NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions), number COVID-19 cases would likely shown 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 - 94), effectiveness different interventions varying.

If NPIs could conducted **one week, two weeks, three weeks earlier** China, cases could **reduced 66%, 86%, 95%**, respectively, together significantly reducing number affected areas. However, NPIs conducted **one week, two weeks, three weeks later**, number cases could shown **3-fold, 7-fold, 18-fold increase** across China, course provided proper isolation contact tracing also done. without able test US medical staff basically flying blind weeks virus spreading over. washingtonexaminer.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm saying government part play. easier said done, but, go wear mask stores. Use sanitizer shopping touch phone put pocket pocket infected etc etc. Maybe go Disneyworld local pubs, go showing symptoms. people used brains little more, would half issues US now. Go ahead hang friends. 


And think easy abandon economy health sake(mainly old) completely wrong. largest economy world (definitely long) shutting economy causes 10x issues people dieing. realize US weakend beyond tipping point, there's countries would love take advantage that. cares humans ICU healthcare workers suffering; staying indoors quarantine TYRANNY /s Awww. upset country live anti-establishment horror view world. Fuck greg Abbott negligent piece trash. trump cuck exactly told, despite fucking constituents. Opened economy first bevause want show daddy smart loud are. look us. Worst country. absolute fucking disgrace 100% culpable. (EU citizen) traveling via US march. airline employee called US officials confirm board plane flight canceled ESTA flight (from pacific island cases)...

not matters think treatment EU fair case. hope so. Belgium hunderd retarded people across largest cities decided point almost virus control would great moment massive pop-up parties. Anti-mask policy standing close obviously included. would really suck go back lockdown asshats. two kinds people, understand extrapolate incomplete data set...

God people really struggle things cant see. Imagine half state California fire, pocket Fire Deniers whose entire argument ""well, one know fire, can't see fire house, wildfires must bad. I've heard worse campfire anyway.""

People would call fucking got best fire response, greatest world say. took call Prime Minister Japan said ""I know it, one better fire you."" But, problem look fire, fire find. said people ""Slow looking fire, finding much fire"". reason fire rest world looking good are. We're fire searching, we're finding most. I'm going go heart fire hold rally, want anyone wearing flame retardant clothing. dozen staffers fire, we'll people sign waiver enter says ""I understand risks fire, accept responsibility"". narrative I've hearing trump-supporting family members government paying hospitals per covid case, they're declaring everything covid case money. Well done everyone. go home. Really. Go home Houston judge tried issue mandatory mask order enforce issuing $1000 fines individuals wearing them. Police departments denounced order governor too. 7 billion doses... every six months ND join this, we've holding Covid 19 even though never fully shut state. municipalities starting buy portable air conditioning put individual rooms since can’t put care takers common rooms.  welcome, Adolf. aware takes little getting virus potentially die? die soon get it

the cases rising, unfortunately deaths follow It’s hard tell. Apparently Trumps rally horribly dangerous, BLM protesting biggie. honestly can’t make sense true, USA still way un list. 1/3 tests country, Denmark. Even much ill, meaning much urgent reason many tests.

Some countries like South Korea need make tests, tackled corona smart outset. mass testing lot corona?

It's funny USA considers leader anything regarding corona. Talk touch reality. sounds like studies needed. Little twice testing per capita explain 10 times cases per capita. Poaching highly educated workers/students another country smart. American visa programs for. Exactly. live small western PA county spared major outbreak. sibling moving Houston WA can’t stand politics (since we’re required wear masks such) doesn’t believe virus, thinks TX back normal, etc. I’m worried her. insane think shit doesn’t exist, let alone move states get ‘away’ all. Irresponsible hell understand is: idiot landlords think going move in? AFAIK, places waiting list get apartment, they'll end bunch empty units they'll rent someone evicted apartment.

What missing situation? Shoving people cubicle farms work could have, office workers, done remotely decade, never good idea. Additionally, least live, assume across state, board health list addresses there's confirmed positive case. If/when ambulance LEO dispatched address, they're advised change full PPE contact needs made. found small, simple effective measure minimize transmission levels since individuals municipal employees deal public daily. Thank you. Would never imagined. /s

Now something protect country? Lost mother routine knee-surgery. Outraged understatement. HIPPA public health exceptions would allow sharing type video. Problem publicity stand point. hospital wants take risk back fire. Yeah looks like said many European countries higher death rate per capita, better way would say US fourth behind three countries, Europe test Friday afternoon, got result Monday morning.

This Michigan week ago. don’t always put others help save lives. It’s public places you’re contact people. It’s 24/7. Testing much better beginning pandemic. US states peaked earlier tend “higher death rates” less cases discovered.

Also, it’s spreading among younger populations less lethal reported pneumonia deaths much higher normal year....coincidence? SmElL cOnSpIrAcY

&amp;#x200B;

GOIS, '''''''CORON**VIRUS''''''** FAYK Haha ok fair. I’m saying since testing throughout process hard data consistent. Yeah Indians stopped caring general lulled false sense security.Doesnt help state gov taking seriously should.In state(Karnataka),majority people stopped wearing masks,especially evening reason social distancing gone toss. That's great. many wet tested, 5, 25, 50. That's true test Remember this?

2020-03-16: [A university Norway told students studying abroad come home countries 'poorly developed health services ... example possible?! VirUs oVeR! ""per capita""... never implied ok seat belt helmet laws. Ok selfish crybaby. Thats fine. dont pretend real ethical political argument real importance. dont care got. No, need advance visas UK EU places. China, do. Russia, do.

Restricting testing access like means lower # tests run also guarantees high %positive. Arizona something similar? probably right. Go website province. online assessment testing. 

We need 5 million 20 year olds wasting testing resources, please follow health professionals experts waste resources.

I'm shocked many fellow countrymen ignorant unaware basic facts. think lot people getting sick younger able recover better. Plus doctors know treat covid success. slowly filling hospitals rather capacity nearly instantaneously. think definitely see deaths coming weeks tho hospitals run space shortage os doctors nurses treat people. hope don’t get NY death levels, we’ll almost definitely match cases per day. Imagine thinking insult 😂 center =big money.

Not MD Anderson non-profit hospitals around Houston. funnel nearly money back research care. people read ""time go 100% back normal! Restaurants full capacity, standing shoulder shoulder concerts, packed arenas!"" Sweden 5th highest death per capita world.


It serious situation there, slightly less bad severe flu season 2000 (in terms excess mortality). Thankfully longer excess mortality anymore. Yes called many names suggesting similar crisis could happen elsewhere. Yes, NYC dense population certainly sped transmission along. that, virus doesn’t care city live whether think happen there. Little mitigation = spread. Simple appreciate retail front lines. might glamorous medical professionals, still dangerous. [""Hey Patrick, would add latinamerican small countries taking dastrict actions little late instead taking acertive approach giving early actions. happens Sweden's actions slow spread. lot people work home, study home, free time activites vacations cancelled. People spending time home combined economical stress whats causing this.

The increase domestic violence would probably even greater would total lock Sweden. Consumer spending 2/3rds american GDP. Wildly irresponsible Trump wanted close borders (like he's wanted 3 years) people called racist it. responded like petty child decided politicize entire epidemic calling fake overblown. End result half country running around wearing masks social distancing half running around opposite. Yay 'Murica. What’s new that? Lol Someone another thread recently said me, ""you look bad saying this"", pointing white people coming attack country right now. stand comment, continue look disgust politicians support, defend, outright legislate actual racism system, hordes insane lookers claim white supremacy systemic racism. know. beyond frustrated fellow Pennsylvanians acting. Thank goodness Gov Wolfe managed much drama thrown him. India.. things really bad wherever tried save face test less initially like that? I'll believe happens. TBH, would still see uptick Ireland (they speak English compatible legal system) maybe Munich tech. Also western pa here. stopped going stores enforce face masks. Largest grocery chain area strictly enforcing face masks feel much safer buy food.

I refuse go Walmart seem okay people taking masks enter store.

50% shoppers think they're clever wear mask around chin.

Smaller establishments requiring masks all.

Don't get started fast food restaurants.

I feel like we're pot boil over. reason ""flattened"" stopped major portion 
of testing (drive thru) Harris Galveston county. got rid drive thru testing damn near impossible get tested weeks. reason ""flattening"". cases starting rise again, theyre getting scared are... sort starting care? know Galveston made mandate wear mask shopping dont allow gatherings 100 people. efforts total joke. Okay I’m US citizen currently live abroad residency country. wonder apply me? Never thought getting dual citizenship it’s looking like might good option....

I also wonder travel. Like want travel EU, almost flights layovers USA... banned? Uh oh buddy,here comes downvotes ruling party army. locked down? hearing today stated spoken Trump two half weeks. likely left conversation. really wish close state borders;

Also Michigander.

I wish we'd annexed Canada already. Would make seeing wife much easier, closing Ohio border would cherry top. I'd settle keeping unlimited amounts money politics. even bridge far days. surprising since higher incomes give people freedom stay home. lot work remotely know won’t get it? respect space business. I'm American, born raised. would love go Europe one day, money. said, 1,000% support ban. side pond, stay safe.

Plus individual cities, prisons, packing plants, places reporting outbreaks. Many places reporting cumulative new positive cases every day 3 months now. really surprising numbers 100 1000 made appearance least time? Yea... get it. sucks... get it. Yup. protesters get reality check. defense would info available time, different info that's available now, would also prove got sick hospital grocery store way home. There's way that. walks like duck, quacks like duck, also need DNA prove court.  Ack son meant studying Europe too.  Crap! test negative, think test administered correctly. nasal swab, fast barely felt it. Like I've worse strep tests. say 30% false negative rate knows?

Edit add: denied test several times given one wound ER. admitted sent home cab. recovered home OTC meds got result. shitshow. thrilled near people seem embrace masks, however, case Michigan. Stay well! New Yorkers fault places like Florida take seriously masks something debate, things would different. U need pawg kill it? paraphrasing wrong. made sounds like respects human rights knew cover-up. fact criticizing measures saves lives evidence cover up. huge football fan, really appreciate this. also completely agree. half point hostels? mingle like minded travelers? long pandemic drags threat country. think it’s going go away you’re sick it? like hundreds thousands. 1.6 million people commute city work every weekday. 

617,000 people commute 3 hours round trip city.  Where, pray tell, might one find one these?   ok school told apply visa even though embassies closed currently issuing visas.  move next month drive NY. hope affect move :( choice new job Protests kinds allowed here. would know non-American sowing seeds confusion animosity actual Americans trying promote non-fatal police encounters. Judging comment history, working real hard keep things are. Fauci admitted saying reason. responses worldwide categorized quick effective (NZ, Germany, SK, Japan), late problematic terribly (Canada, France, Spain, Italy outside Bergamo), countries completely gave trying pretend things normal (US, India, Russia, Brazil, Sweden, maybe UK).

Countries first category definitely things proud of. Everyone else lots lessons learn. Yes, ancient Romans speak English. role, originally designed, last year, sometimes duration emergency. beginning, Imperati honored restriction, too. 

Dictators know today typically dictators life, least get overthrown go scurrying away private jet whatever country them. mean understand why. Due poor leadership states acting like everything okay cases continue soar. dunno, didn’t Trump ban foreign work visas? wouldn’t surprise EU go tit tat that. \*slow clap\*  That’s fine, wont come there. We're cockroaches! Great idea. every day since March. expected wear home due cover workplace's negligence, say overtime pay 24 hours per day duration entire pandemic order. buy futures this?

I'm sorry joke bad taste. Soul searching tends quiet activity Oh wow that’s pretty extreme haven’t heard thing it. Got source read more? hope every countries world EU. China feel this? ashamed! unit sharing axed curriculum. game giant parachute jump underneath seal around you. Australian, appalled start leadership, appeared following trumps footsteps.. grew spine locked shop. States closed borders, international borders closed indefinite time. 

We flattened curve (bar one state) country cases all. I'm glad Aussie times like :’(( Well...there goes honeymoon year. 😔 Literally second got Tampa getting trouble like this.

Was practicing park closed covid

Complaining people boating water rental (jeters)

Walked guys house knock( terrible it’s FL coulda shot)

Now this. Sense pattern entitled behavior? Also, virus never really made South Rome. even Rome hit hard.

To give good comparison, whole region Lazio (which includes Rome, capital) 886 active cases, population 5,879 millions.

Certain regions single digits, like Aosta Valley Basilicata.

And regions except Piedmont, Trentino, Lombardy, Friuli Venezia Giulia Emilia Romagna less thousand active cases. Everything bigger Texas Sweden lock down, economy went downhill too. 

A real lockdown allows economy recover faster. What's done US -- working worsen economy. Heck, US banned Canada Europe already Yeah, must large gathering, keep entirely outdoors. people go elsewhere need use restroom, put mask one person enter house time absolutely MUST allow it.

If family members grumble it, tell tough shit, house, rules, send home.

It's pandemic, world normal right now. Deal inconvenienced damn life! thankful house bombed hell huddled tent somewhere without even enough blankets keep warm freezing cold, like refugees deal Syria YEAR. Florida. Keep mind anecdotal though. Driving past downtown yesterday, see every bar packed brim, social distancing, masks. There's post right tampa subreddit someones brother Covid-Positive going big bar area. worked catered dinner event since work. told 100-150 people. got 30 max since peple cancelled last minute Covid news. Archive link: corona outbreak Gällivare rapid spread western Germany give clue second wave corona pandemic look like, according state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.


- case several places, local fairly extensive distribution, says state epidemiologist.


Germany latest example rapid spread covid-19 small geographical area. Tuesday, tough restrictions imposed region hundreds thousands inhabitants since 1,500 employees meat factory Gütersloh infected virus.

**Is new outbreak sign Germany opening society quickly?**

- difficult make assessment. see type outbreak places rules recommendations followed, says Anders Tegnell.

- all, shows potential virus. gets chance spread, will. something deal long time come. need plans measures place deal many different ways.

**Is second wave look like, powerful outbreaks around place event?**

- quite likely so, expressed several places, including Germany, South Korea Beijing.

In Sweden, similar situation occurred Gällivare last week, municipality alerted spread acute infection connection maintenance work mine many hired workers consultants. According Anders Tegnell, must readiness deal similar outbreaks quickly places summer. 

- Gällivare, lot measures taken reduce infection quickly possible. tested contact traced large extent.

The municipality closed recreational cultural facilities bath houses, libraries, sports halls museums. short period, bus traffic center stopped. Restaurants hotels remain open, checks compliance regulations increasing.

**Could appropriate impose strict lockdown local outbreak Sweden?**

- believe Gällivare model, primarily implement measures already place. impose strict lockdown without done before, think would big consequences. try number things first.

**Is desirable put infected relatives quarantine?**


- may situations feel something need briefly get better control happening.


#According Anders Tegnell, infection tracking increase throughout country summer. public health authorities helping regions get started. Sounds familiar. know rile up, but, much support protests police reform, believe 100% needed, approximately two three weeks ago see massive coronavirus case spike. think re-opening economy solely blame this. Texas barely closed first place managed hold case count low canceling large events rodeo shifting everyone possible work home.  


We also seeing spikes places locked harder, longer, re-opened slowly like California.  


Hopefully everything calm people stay distanced stay safe. Everyone degree Also lot people think it’s big hospital area must besttttttt them. You’re really stuck “but side bad guys”

It doesn’t mean sides haven’t politicized excused actions name it. I’m saying think positive news would go motivate people follow through. say it’s working, efforts worth something. news says we’re bunch screw ups, makes feel like effort worthless hopeless Sweden style situation would best scenario USA point. Worst case scenario however, I'm even sure. US might see worse Bergamo certain areas Arizona here. I've calling idiot fEaR VirUS people Facebook, telling facts care feel it. Probably lose friends it, big loss really. Oh Fauci, anyone trust anymore? He's wrong predictions estimates virus trends numbers. like he's another tool credibility. pictures linking Bill Gates Gates wellbeing people mind. Bill Gates trying promote eugenics population control. South Florida completely, utterly irresponsible. I’ve said many times sub, annoyed Miami people, I’ve received comments I’m policing whether people wearing masks? Like, yes? Florida nearly 100K cases March, people aren’t taking nearly seriously (if even bothered). 

The Miami mayor, passed mask law, caught dining Swan Miami— restaurant packed, following COVID guidelines, mayor dining large group wasn’t family. also took pictures others wearing mask, partly already coronavirus. Regardless, everyone irresponsible. restaurants packed, barely masks sight, cases surging, nobody cares. People keep asking want “go tonight”??????? Hello. know, actually makes lot sense. Thanks happen, yes, also probably call black people ""blacks""... numbers presented per week would less discussion reporting delays holiday effects. presented since start same, catch-up wednesdays day day days. consistent. inconsistency updates weekends done, weekend updates return autumn seen. sorry kids mental health suffering hope things change soon. Clearly everyone affected way, short term us, kids living thriving initial couple weeks disruptions confusion. discussed length life throw curve ball time, need able roll punches speak. Personally, seen lot growth maturing kids learned better deal adversity last months, hope serve well rest lives. 

However, agree, never gotten point would better everyone leaders acted sooner state federal level take action testing tracing. like game hot potato everyone trying pass blame around. Personally, hold accountable. testing tracing fucked (and continues be) would better place health wise mentally. Ahhh yes, EU let Italy get ravaged COVID due response. you’re selfish twat Fucknuckles... thank new term fuckwads. 👍🏼 long surge capacity overwhelmed trend continues. 

 

Estimated 4 days base ICU capacity reached. 

Estimated 14 days sustainable surge ICU capacity reached. 

There still another 30% unsustainable surge ICU capacity top that, know unsustainable surge means exactly. Lol what? live Canada. able book test online, get swabbed, got results back, less week, free, symptoms, risk factors, known exposures. essential worker either - decided get tested transitioning WFH partially returning work. 
The hardest hit provinces testing lot. overall numbers lower except 3 provinces sub-200 sub-100 active cases confirm single digit increases, all, daily. Texan here. Fuck Greg Abbott. He's killing us. citizens much government, mean they're lying borders get vacation. bunch recently charged Banff saying go straight Alaska. glad see just, like, outright racism replies, cool Take countries 15% GDP tourism. heavily affected sure.

Now imagine would affected instead 200 cases day 10k.
Or instead 30 deaths per day 1000.

What say even make sense. Yes shut 2 months lose money. think people would happily travelled go bars restaurants 1000 deaths day?

It work like say. Two reasons:
1. takes time positive test death death count always lagging week so.
2. Right young people getting infected, think likely die older people. What's like casino floors? I'm curious. magical stuff bottle make pimples go away. send $43.00 send year's supply. confidence fools. Ah gowl done given reason gov giving ending support.

I cannot say wrong without knowing reason. Would've lot worse though low. False positives rare swabs, work picking virus genetic material, way get false positive sample get contaminated lab. infection bodies subsequently cleared it, probably infectious negative swabs done correctly - people infectious 11 days infection. doubt anyone wants saying people going die enough ICU beds people take seriously. gong set double peak well. People saying Oregon, too. Especially rural areas, even new large cluster cases found. general attitude either hoax, let people get die. know someone La Libertad, Perú desperately trying secure oxygen father. practically unavailable unless tons money. Yeah area # even local area code answer. screen call say 99 percent time hang up.

I lot debt collectors medical issues 5 years ago insurance decided retroactively want pay. made lot irresponsible decisions money back unable pay medical debt. state calls usually start ""This attempt collect debt""

I 2 friends similar situation debt collectors calling refuse answer unknown calls. ~~Its~~ ~~everyone~~ US Government politicised issue begin with.

FTFY. source? hacked selectively released DNC emails election year, outcome determined small swing? understanding keeping casual eye situation China, many doctors spoke early virus bad many citizen journalists took videos posted online world see. Historically China harsh people try whistleblow many people disappeared NYT article primarily about.

A lot people getting pissed they're dying China trying keep quiet accepting aid nation (or asking it). started taking strict measures it, forcing people homes thought CV19 would taken street unmarked vans spirited away (that happens video least twice).

When SARS outbreak happened, China spent, provably fact, lot time money misinformation campaign downplay bad mind, almost without doubt say China covering COVID19 numbers China's citizens ones suffering (also rest world we'd known bad was, maybe countries would locked quicker). Kaaaarl! kills people! would anyone want go lots people right now?

-The introvert's life motto 

(including myself). i'm terribly informed attribute higher amount obese black people fact black people also tend less wealthy (due systemic racism), meaning end eating unhealthily? Remember conspiracy peeps filming empty hospital parking lots? 
I WoNdEr died down? Ooops. could happen? went wrong? source here: US tested 90k per 1 million 

Sweden tested 38k per 1 million Yes witnessed well. live NH work MA. recent shopping trip stopped woman entering store asking “absolutely to” wear mask. (I mine on.) told it’s mandatory NH MA. said “I know, I’m MA.” went store without mask. willing wear one it’s mandatory, since it’s mandatory NH, didn’t bother. logic confused bit. did. news.

&amp;#x200B;

to need20: media operates cities counties. closely monitor communities health authorities. one newsroom somewhere got tip press release regarding testing sites. hence news story born.

this news collected disseminated. freedom press enshrined constitution. travel agent, weeping right alongside you. Guess time career change. empire

Get grip, heavily populated first world countries still heavily effected this. narrative seems missing articles negative impact society thousands tens thousands families forced onto streets. 

A family getting evicted humanitarian issue. That's easy folks ignore ""not problem."" thousands desperate parents streets kids middle pandemic, becomes public health crisis, public safety crisis. Good people go extraordinary lengths protect children. Baltimore stellar reputation safety is. 

The worst part happen across nation once. estimated 20% families make rent payments May. Folks, that's almost **10 million people.** Imagine 10% evicted August, Federal UI runs out. That's million people streets desperate, mostly urban areas already prone poverty crime. 

We vested interest figuring keep happening. nice getting country sounds, absolutely would blame forget bleach! live Maine, dealing thing. know governors common? They're Democrats. right using pandemic whip political unrest. you’re saying track herd immunity thousands innocent deaths time rest world get vaccine? Wonderful lol. fellow Indians: become like ? article linked denialist seems raise good points risk coronavirus quite good source debunking shown here? coffin come get vaccine. “To middle pandemic breathtakingly dangerous,” said Nancy Cox, former CDC virologist, 22 years led agency’s center influenza.

Breathtakingly dangerous. Yep, sounds right. Good. hope generates concrete response action. get impression Nordic Council can't really *legislate* anything items discussed still big impact direction region. 

It good Sweden's neighbors holding accountable pursuing harmful herd immunity strategy poses direct danger them. Hopefully pressure coming loving, disappointed, siblings help Sweden bring outbreak control rejoin Nordic, European international consensus.  Lol thats news me. flag link much better official one! dog whistle animals hear it. also can't travel EU US back EU citizen? Insert surprised pikachu Influenza? Perhaps Dublin, already European Headquarters companies mention plus dozens more. We're EU, native English speakers, culturally different, plus we're great craic. Honestly, American loves travel abroad 100% support decision. love travel supersede safety countries citizens. terrifying live right now, even go week get essentials. many people don’t care (I live South). watch pandemic get closer closer immediate circle friends family can’t anything it, even plead family wear masks practice social distancing stay home. people think whether think it’s “dumb” despite constant upticks infection death. wouldn’t want Americans traveling country either. 🙃 German travels happening Twitterverse saying closer 300 - speculation course. really shows theory hot weather stopping virus wishful thinking. Maybe reopened fast begin with, Governor. must mean approval government's response covid specific measures taken, general overall approval right? Cause cant imagine democracy 97% approval rating. America? Can’t go one minute without America mouth? Seems like common trend here! Less traffic 

Less illegals 

It’s like LA 50 years ago Unnecessary sentient animal suffering... Oh wait, described existence. Ha ha good one. Narrator: *It clusterfuck.* Yup I'm also Belgian boyfriend American girlfriend.

Already got may trip ruined, June amsterdam trip ruined, likely July anniversary trip ruined too.

Haven't seen eachother since february really really hurts.

Especially everyone picking life again, planning summer holidays trips Europe...

And even know i'll able see woman love again...
It's right. Whoa! something just...? Ya got test due first responder. Got 2 weeks ago, still haven’t received results. labs overwhelmed told. Look testing numbers rolling average almost 600k day protest? There's 1-2 week lag action take- surge going continue near term matter do. Someone broke car day get personal response Chief Police. outrage! 48 percent new cases 22-49 

Or something like 

Kids rocket science here. Nobody wears masks, businesses open govt prioritizing business controlling virus. Interstate travel protected constitution Please do. hospitals overflow, they'll stop admitting people, numbers ""stop"" right there. people end visiting multiple hospitals number days find somewhere get admitted, give head home die recover own. happened China, Italy, Ecuador, New York City, parts New Jersey. They're ""hidden deaths"": never officially admitted tested, count ""official"" covid deaths. people focusing ""excess deaths"" overall, official numbers. ""excess deaths"" helps bring indirect victims well: people regular health issues get admitted time seek help soon enough virus fears ended dying heart attacks appendicitis whatever. China pay way Mexico paying wall. I’m Texas flaring lot here. It’s large state 

Mass graves. 

Hysteria

Pure hysteria last week saw workers wore masks outside few. customers though, may lord mercy Florida. mask wearing, social distancing. think anyone day without pandemic drove past Frenchys clearwater beach packed people nearly standing sitting top other. Yuuuup. business meetings Hannover keep getting pushed back. directly impacts company's ability directly communicate international business partners. Fingers crossed applies tourism, concerns case. us per capita testing well ahead world, it. loss, Europe boring. India, countries South America Africa far enjoyable people full self hate. American one country least half-dozen more. ban public areas science black dude even explained lot common expressions contain religious roots. Phoenix definition suburban sprawl. 

It like LA less culture. person work Wendy's drive thru I'm also Connecticuts foreskin. yell too? Well wishes positive vibes brotha. might want go back re-read wrote Initial deaths EU might higher US countries took measures death rate decreased considerably. However US death rate still high weeks lighter measures. (Here stone back you) might want compare current virus data see many new cases deaths US EU.  Finally, good fucking news. Total infections/deaths matter, current level infections. That's reason we're worried Turks bring Justinian plague them. countries enforce tight travel restrictions quarantine protocols US sourced travelers long time come. could also curb travelers coming events tourism return home, they’ll add 14 days trip quarantine protocols, return positive test shut soon. People shut life forever.

If half assed shutdown, *need* shut forever, lot less dead well. That's quite scary realisation :( Interesting.... especially considering Sweden's response.
Will sweden indefinitely barred schengen area supersede it? Well, sucks since moved US Paris early year toddler...looks like family wont able come visit anytime year. know killing parents getting visit grandson here, life. Oh yea, put freakin' mask... Fingers crossed Make masks taste like Don's ass lot middle ground North Korea responsible governing. wear mask **pray.**

this crucial optimistic imo. seeing fall America. started 2016, coronavirus cherry top. Houston filled up, anywhere else nearby send hundreds new patients day. could try stuff San Antonio Austin, would fill pretty quickly rate also. cities also 3 hours away, exactly ideal sending numerous critical patients far away anyway. screwed. randomized trials give useful information rest population. It’s useless use convince people lasts months, ignore everyone else didn’t nearly long. There's vulnerable people every population. outlook good elderly people live states spiking.

They're beach declaring victory, tsunami even hit yet. conclusion pilgrimage Mecca, Islam’s holiest site, one five pillars religion. mandatory religious duty Muslims say it’s important would understatement. Don’t shitty. seems familiar either...your math flawed. point still stands, though.

Your pond would half full 5 days:

Day 1: 1 lily pad
Day 2: 2
Day 3: 4
Day 4: 8
Day 5: 16

You’d start 0.something lilypads make work, somebody else probably math. Lol brother say this? Like aware risks, right?  Tufts, BC, BU, think I’d list Holyoke :P Nope. silly questions help with? 21 new cases today, Australia calls help, 20,000+ day US head honcho calls testing scaled back..... Canada isn’t opening borders US anytime soon. 

Basically whole country agrees keep closed since it’s COVID shitshow side. They’ve closed anyone that’s EU citizen since March well, including Americans. clarifies begin reopen third countries, America list newly-allowed countries. Health experts liberally told us could protests masses, want people close thier businesses lose thier jobs again? Smh don’t think US officials understand much armadas aircraft carriers US has. Donald still power, he’ll send US navy get vaccine. We're seeing generational change.

This happens every hundred years.

Forget history. Repeat it. 

We forgot. 

Millennials big generation Boomers they're sick shit.

Only question show vote? levels Boomers do, Boomers controlling force.

China's threat Empire. maybe global warming. yeah everything might kill people, ifs maybes align wrong way. doesnt mean supposed sit home nothing. might dead evening car crash. Nobody knows. 

If infected point wearing facemask. Facing consequences something harm anyone? Come on. wear masks; actually germ freak... hugging shaking hands win-win me. But, fucking hate government making laws imprisoning unsettled science. And, even science backs up, factor consider. People need take responsibility actions, stop thinking government's responsibility, end game living country like China North Korea... that's want, go live there. masks option, neither freedom speech assembly. Oh, lock reason reeducate you, free!

I live Japan 99% people wear masks. lot negatives 99% population following rules. And, positives. keep fighting good fight, attribute viewpoint mine, realize neighbors viewpoint may different views may valid invalid time. Ya obvious propaganda. group people want work, care die covid. spread bunch propaganda it. people want work despite threat covid spreading lies it, downplaying it, making wearing mask political thing, want spread virus quickly possible, get economy going fast possible, accept casualties easily handle. 

They care people die. They'd send way die wars political power. Young healthy people lives ahead them. Trust me, European wants visit US Oh blissful ignorance sounds nice, mine aggressive ignorance virus brought USA knees appalling lack leadership federal government? going rewrite history pretend chain US media hyperbolic ? thinking EU mad stuff. I’ll leave this: tell EU actually then. need cops protect bad guess need guns. Let one say didn’t sacrifice mine. **Travel China**, well developing countries, **will allowed,** report states.

(sigh) People value important think are. one cares like 5 people TOPS. want stop damn virus. government wants find you, find you. understand Sweden less prepared Asian countries seems like they've learned nothing whole pandemic. mean they're still asking people qear masks, ludicrous. even say home stay country. want Maga, stay spend money there.  everything dumber Florida Hot wheels said gonna happen.

Smh. time case numbers hospitalizations get bad enough politics catch it’s already got much momentum pull back control.... thanks! No. world hear it. Jan 31 2020. dec 31st 2019 it’s it’s called covid-19 2019. That’s official W.H.O date. 

When start. fun fact trump defunding cdc China irrelevant failed. failed tell cdc USA. 

That bulllshit dec 31st 2019 joke.

I’d agree you. imbecile correct. Nobody funding America cdc China W.H.O actually said shit till late. 

No shit CDC China operated China Chinese. answer govt first America. it’s fucking pointless

Ok mr know all. masks said help? 

America March hit right ? use mask. Oh April ? End April? Lol. Fucking sheep.  Build dome. antibodies testing? 
Can anybody confirm news article 50% accuracy test. saw tabloid I’d like informed. Florida stoping people border sign kind form stating quarantine 14 days came certain states ie NY, NJ... obviously work well them. believe earth too. problem I’ve got news like people take spin “oh see?!? Summer kills Corona need live scared” throw literally every safety precaution window. 

This also corona air accurately without host, mind you, contracting public outside 30+ minutes isn’t going kill it. Probably summer season kills virus. imagine went strike told guys pick food? Hasn’t UK already left EU? Unless also travel ban Americans, might luck sadly. called case study. Reddit aversion study design randomised blind study stupid know, scientists vast array tools use investigate wide variety problems posed science. everyone acted together rather waiting turn get shat could ended virus month

Unfortunately kind global co-operation basically impossible watch tennis? players ball boy people touch balls. Unmitigated disaster Saw coming miles away. Trump can't thing long term fucking tool. Good luck USA. Wait Mexico. talking serologists, antibodies prior exposure necessarily equate immunity. It’s gonna know sure anyone going immunity length time contracting it. mean large scale, really hope best looking good many different angles. 6 months? cant even fucking 2 months. People already protesting lockdowns may. Hope Canada well close Alaska loophole. tested any, would ZERO new cases, right? LOL Well, curious see deaths/day goes next two weeks, also don’t reduce deaths alone. Outside death still cause severe illnesses require long recovery time. don’t really see reason accept lying down. Here's one: What? statistics.

The bigger conspiracy 70 people room, theres 99.9% chance two share birthday. shit ask. Really? I'm curious think cost life would never shut economy all. I've seen estimates could saved 30,000+ lives shut economy week earlier. think would reasonable sacrifice 100,000+ people shut economy all? , i’ve drinking lot recently don’t know take much Fuck. handmaid's tale starts, it? guess permanent lung damage, heart attacks kidney failure go dialysis considered success long die... It’s almost like elect president expect represent Americans. What’s federal mean anyways? what's happening everywhere (also sarcasm) give New York police permission hurt people don’t belong, bet ass will. They’re animals know it. There’s gonna arrests rule law. They’ll beat shit people, kill dozen families watch horror. America, don’t catch slipping up. early response disappointing, picked time. really need make masks mandatory. Guise, joking joking! mean joking sarcastic. obvious! Google it. /S When’s “next year” Better tell businesses tell employees that, tell federal government give people money live come again.

Otherwise lip service. helping government, set contract tracing system like everything else regarding surveillance still follow EU laws end year. EU bans Americans, UK Seems like crazy line drawn too. went pick bathroom cleaner today shopping plaza fancy organic grocery store hobby lobby. grocery store everyone entering leaving wearing mask. hobby lobby saw customers masks. I'm sure probably regional distinction man wish masks politicized. take goddamn upvote. Weird kink ok. Illinois plan reopen schools colleges. Announcement made today Gov. Pritzker  GOD DAMNIT SHITTIEST HOLIEST COUNTRY DONT FORET IT!!!!!!1!!!!!11 mean google maps sends summary every month I've been. Ive literally gone work bc forced back could prove information. I'm pretty sure mom COVID. Starting past Friday, feeling well today seems gotten worse. got chills, cough, wants sleep. got heart condition diabetes well. supposed get test today feel like it. supposed go tomorrow morning. worried be?  cool. started growing tomatoes. source virologists researchers knowledge medicine likely have. Turns happiest place earth concerned stock holders. Look, buddy, watched partner, many friends count, die slow federal response AIDS. Fauci needs continually reminded poorly administrations works handle shit like this. initially tell us truth masks administration like them. early spread could slowed. yet signs going reverse course. stop defending shit companies it.  People showing concern order make sure companies like disney held accountable. speak language?  Fuckin it, Thumbs emoticon! Thanks reply! I'd say federal income tax pay paid CARES act.

Even true government supposed people. Helping us times need job. ""handout"" government right thing.  know, remember watching drastic measures China taking curb spread thinking oh boy gets U.S., gonna total shit show. way measures would fly here. expected Trump lead horribly, exceeded expectations. That's okay. fucking poor trying pay bills go anywhere. Squints eyes you

Duh duh duuuuuuuuh Liberal solutions like aren’t going stop American populace going places avoid.  testing backlog Durring armed raids capital, still like 70% higher approval handeling pandemic. 

I'ts noisy asshole minority. Thank posting link. helpful information, widely reported.

There’s Airbnb world worth risking life life family. bad..comedy central too.... safest place stay home, restricted businesses continuing open? guy joke. I’d rather stay home go Disney mask heat. would safer home I’d rather social distancing yet, get contaminated airborn droplets well 34 minutes. taken eliminating need social distancing masks. Second vacation Covid took me. Trump isn’t wrong though, testing means cases. least calm mass hysteria restart economy. yeah, false lie though...anyone basic microbiology training knows (like one course community college level basic training, nurses aid training...) ironic. Trump damage international image US past 4 years president ever done history. feel that. Highly recommend getting heart broken quarantine depressed haha Italy, France, Spain, etc dependent upon tourism economies. That’s going gnarly hit year. Interested see plays out. I’m pretty much guessing yes, especially fall northern states 100% indoors seems like lot schools seriously considering person classes. live Wisconsin state sees surge won’t able shut state Supreme Court already ruled stay home orders violation rights. course one taking mask wearing seriously.

Breathing everything. much christians here, problem with, long leave alone. second one hilarious! Really top.  place reservations anything two weeks advance point. 

If location hot spot, required quarantine 2 weeks upon arrival destination. 

If destination becomes hot spot, probably want go somewhere lockdown measures place, probably required quarantine 2 weeks return home. governor won’t let people vote mail  late already, chance, Visa secured? ask restrictions immigration moment, State side, exceptions dependent Visa status. lol

""we'll see happens"" *mitochondria power meat thermometer. sadly usual corporations likely get yet bailouts rest country twisting wind.  LOL ok buddy. US cases high back April higher death per day half. getting better treating patience another one 2-4 weeks delays.   primary concern issue good chunk people hostile social distancing use masks. thank-you..  idea earth people would go Disney Land Pandemic.. Save money safe---just stay home. That's fair, also push federal plan. EU way, every country thing little coordination. thanks understanding :) friend mid 20's lived New York went hospital would call would get out... hospital told see friends loved ones pandemic... like 5 months... called hospital.. said 'who'.. apparently hospital databases meant handle thousands patients dying let alone put bodies.. phones still show hospital...

American, blame them. :( downvoted money thing, believe that's think mostly. downvoted thinking people coming highly infected territory still high risk masks on. Masks help always used distance possible that's sure, nullify risk, best keep every possible distance. start highly infected places. ""We nothing fault!"" 

Presumably, China going pay it, they'll running things America?

Edit: could 20-30% though bad enough.  red line end important, even started full lockdown right numbers would still true looks like Texas's positive rate increasing (from already high %) even increase test numbers. worth, California's positive rates seem increasing bit (to looks largely steady though), they're around high 4%'s, versus 10% did. governor face Texas. pieces shit however. even deal signed example plains coming UK allowed enter EU aid space next year on. lasting damage. professional divers ‘mild’ cases require hospitalization. longer dive.

I mean dont get wrong, didnt expect get bad US dont think ever hope guys. late mother hopefully help people future. Yeah, Mexico dark horse, still something say championship. came visit dad florida (panhandle) weeks ago help move new house. Honestly, lot time there, completely forgot virus. Almost social distancing, masks, beaches bars open. Thankfully, part Florida cases, weird suddenly forget stuff restrictions. didn’t really go anywhere though, wore mask places, restaurants beaches busy pandemic. couldn’t wrong.

Yup. fortunate job work remote Whidbey Island ordering groceries, got spin bike staying away others. weeks ago, parents hoping go Canada next month stop little possible get WA that’s option don’t want go many states don’t care way here. don’t know I’ll see again. Thanks Obama ! Yes, Indonesia still shut health system down. personal follow procedures reducing hospital capacity 20%. doctors fuming. grandfathers ones refusing wear masks 'they cant breath properly' believe conspiracy theories. actually noticed older generation waaaaaaaay dumber thought. Yup. That's lot people unfortunately. ex-step-dad smug father stepmother got it. sounds almost exactly like march. okay days, came worst cold ever experienced.

You opened bars idiot. stop giving corporations trillions every months instead use money help states like Florida?

You people keep posting crap solution lockdowns fully open state.  exactly paying federal taxes address things like this? Europeans (and say expecting American snowflake downvote bomb), generally deal serious shit US. Historically speaking. Institutionalized racism. anyone surprised coronavirus spikes? still middle one bigger human rights protests globe seen long time. many turn outs? Cities fire. solid week news corona, protests looting.

I saw one wearing masks really. spikes shouldnt surprising anyone. mean last week Washington states governor told Trump stay fuck state business. whats going on? surge cases. surprising. Trumps idea ignore go away beyond moronic. 

Also, cant remember said it, gov doctor mabye Fauci said mathematically impossible come contact now. Contact, contraction. way symptoms varying, almost CERTAIN lot people it, tested. accelerating. According corona world count use 33,000 new infections day since beginning june. Heck, us THINK back march, symptoms match todays symptoms according CDC. 

My friends calling shrondigers Plague. dont know it, dont know didnt. Getting tested question since one reliable anti-body test.  I'm Canada, well. von der Leyen?

Both great rest day/week/year/life.... excuse.


They actively hid it. excuse anything. makes real nervous. pandemic really tough expats is, idea kind indefinite travel ban, however justified, scary.  Breathing air person front know it’s obvious, yet millions still think it’s flu hoax  family, since murdered bloodthirsty cowards.

I see now. ""I feared life wearing mask, unloaded AR-15 stenciled 'You're fucked' onto side of."" Always case. masks traditionally see Asian people wear courtesy always been. keeping wearer healthy, keeping wearer potentially making others sick. 

Now, whether people understand know. that's always case. 

I learned Dr. 10-12 years ago bad flu season.  Still make data false. Yep. restaurants vectors disease (seriously bar seating even allowed?) operate razor thin margins. lot restaurants already struggling. haven’t heard seen anything decrease rent, lot businesses gonna go tits without help regardless. Servers aren’t making much money were, 600 dollars month ends see truly trying times. kicking road next person. potentially ruining future generations Americans quick buck sense normalcy. TIL nod dressing someone demands makes oxygen thief reason recommendation prevent millions people taking tests need wasting resources. 

You recommending every single healthy person age 25 go get test despite health experts recommending it. cause catastrophic failure ability provide testing risk populations need it.

Corona much worse Mumbai ever before. get fooled optics mate.

Delhi, Hyderabad Bangalore boat stupid policies like Mumbai ok thats fine. teacher also advisor dictator. pay attention class goofing off. stay home wear mask.  

Its valid reason selfish child. told wear mask prevent contiuning spread deadly disease dictatorship think dont know shit oppressive governments. US issue comes that. already seen NYC New Orleans. [Corps tactic able build dozens ICU pop Hospitals couple days. almost much entire country Canada! yes, open Disneyworld! ❤️ yeah travel alot cause rich can't speak Houston, speak Tucson, AZ. BLM protests attended, counted less 5 people without masks, hundreds saw. three thousand largest protest. 

Our state protests back end April, state capital -- could count number people photos wearing masks there, different group. mask order went effect, protest mayor's house, mask sight.

Apart Costco (mandatory mask) protest people wearing mask one place I've seen. People passing hand sanitizer, masks, water, snacks, great. Even mask order effect, I'm seeing 75% adherence grocery store. mean, worst happen say no, surely? Hard believe everyone screaming people's faces masks say this. left work March 20 hoping June would saying virus wasn’t big deal thought, knowing social distancing mask wearing would curb virus dramatically point made everything seem like overkill. That’s what’s happened, it’s still behavior I’m seeing everywhere doesn’t bode well future imho. much ego parents live woodlands impression cases dropped Texas. asked watch anything besides Fox News corona virus coverage, dad said gets info Twitter follows q anon accounts. They’re going die stupid. I’m really messed it. Ah, qualified offer medical opinion efficacy masks? think point people missing packed restaraunts venues *right now*, current level hubris reached critical mass. people referring say ""people go anymore"" *weeks now*, deaths/body counts go up. course people arent spooked right now, currently riding ""we seem okay"" wave. If/when cities start looking like NYC, think people home, may even willing sacrifice job order so. eventually, deaths going start spiking up, due something called ""Decompensation"". awful thing say think. unconscionable position take people die this. painful lonely way die. Wearing mask could help prevent that, simply care. Honestly, makes sad you. choose? sing around infect whole choir one sitting. Surely hurt spouse, child, neighbor once! statements founded trickle-down fallacy. 

They presume lender pass along relief property owners. banks not. statements presume landlords pass along amnesty tenants. landlords not.

The solution needs hit tiers once: bailouts must bundled mortgage rent relief. think world long past point listening Swedish experts. pity work them, time stopped telling rest us clever are. get via email- checking results page? despise American political climate much next thinking human being, you’re insane think living China better average person. Elections. Unfortunately thing happening MI Whitmer continues take seriously flattened curve large amount. reward people calling recalled. Can’t believe dim people are. That's enlightening shit. didnt know white. didnt know reddit tells people race either. 

You're quite possibly dumbest person know. Fortunately fucking troll, hope humanity. need reply back, blocked. Go troll someone else. absolutely right. problem nothing work stop this. can't claim lockdowns restrictions work currently working. 
Everyone talk knows hospitals overrun. Everyone knows virus spread like wildfire. seems like nothing stop it, everyone waiting get it. US highest cancer heart attack survival rates earth I've felt gaslighted US media govt since Feb, I'm Western Australia, cannot imagine must feeling/what toll must take health.

For little solace may find it, remember nearly every country good response this, response good, friends' selfish foolish. Vietnam Germany. *Especially* given ever increasing cases active outbreaks parts US.

Fwiw, mental health wise really draining thing seeing many mistakes made, little responsibility taken, denial critical stages got ""too hard"", active deceit authority figures. none makes disease less real, hospital resources etc less limited. So, good remembering that, friends seemingly forgotten. I'll humor you, suggest line thought. problem, ALWAYS act late. 

“Will likely”?? Cmon man, know what’s gonna happen states, massive surge cases overwhelmed hospitals.

It’s like haven’t read book before... *I like stuff. really get it… every one doctors said, ‘how know much this?’ Maybe natural ability.* limited capacity, varying bit, pretty much worldwide issue.

The country prentending might able power shear willpower faith US. 

The lack decent healthcare system higher proportion overweight people fueling dumpster fire. question eviction accomplish paying tenant willing take place, since MASS eviction, applicants evictions belt? Ducey won’t even mandate masks. doesn’t want disappoint daddy. It’s infuriating watch unfold. act like could kill anyone take precautions.... paranoid makes feel better outside. I'm UK. went local supermarket hours ago. wore surgical mask. Apart mine, counted two masks whole store. One mask-wearer put chin soon reached checkout. We're doomed. IMHO - anti mask movement way pro Trump fanatics deal complete fuckup handling Covid. it’s real, wrong. Backwards logic start conclusion work backwards find supporting ‘evidence ‘. ""Blow dry?"" 

""No thanks. bit windy today, I'll take nature's blow dry."" claim said everyone 25 get tested. false never said it. lies you. I'm kinda getting poking holes lies. ""In two weeks"" heard one before??? Booster? done months ago..similar NY No, rock \[points rock\]

He scientist know long people blame (protesters, young bar hoppers, people chose wear mask), blame. It’s infuriating Texas seeing many people without masks made (or refusing wear them) political statement. I’ve heard several friends acquaintances - via social media - people tested positive still going symptoms mild.....
My mom said friends brag going condescending diligent safety protocols. We’ve lost lot “friends” virus. It’s definitely something ask interviews going forward. don’t want someone self-control, willpower, empathy team. That's roughly 40% increase it? promises kept :( Comparing indoors outdoors pointless also due poor leadership.

This country abused ""free speech"" idealism permit ignorance intolerance grow fester. became weak vulnerable foreign propaganda, allowed enshrined domestic newsmedia (mainly FoxNews). allowed organizations exist persist whose sole purpose spread ignorance hatred, gave tax-exempt status (churches, rightwing think-tanks, lobbyist organizations). 

Something done reign garbage decades ago, nobody damn thing stop it. 

Now population 330 million wannabe cowboys flicking cigarette butts window world burns. doesn’t guy funds America people Yeah uncle works Texas Children’s they’re starting take adults Dylann Roof going given potassium chloride go fries. Spanish girlfriend 5 years supposed get married summer, instead, able see person since February. every intention going Barcelona July. what? too* bruh. feel true CT well, though always boomers mask covering nose. TONS vitamins supplements basically unregulated almost nothing (the vitamins know shown benefits clinical trials vitamin [which also helps make respirartory diseases less harmful], zinc, folic acid pregnant women). 

So honestly, ton GNC sells bullshit, mourn loss. Yeah. That's point I'm getting at. I'm help others discomfort. I'm one person. There's 100+ others building. seen person wearing mask desk... Ever. That's exactly like cousin. friend, around recently, tested positive covid little symptoms. cousin believes healthy enough issue contracting covid, also choice get tested continue around people. right. choice. goes saying peoples choices leave homes around people sick. Guy wont wear masks, think proven work, thinks everyone get covid anyway priority prevention. pretty ridiculous hearing disregard health others yesterday.  ICU 90% full. people zero credibility.

Carry on. Call crazy, I'm gonna guess national outrage case counts even continue open going fraction outrage Florida, Texas, Arizona. can’t Yay!! Oregon next!! I'm A+ eat meat thats left out, issues. 

Live best life haha think shutdowns went long, I've got bad news you. miserable July everything goes back maybe even stricter lockdowns. spikes seeing fear beginning something we've allowed snowball unchecked month throughout state. Sure lockdowns sucked past month I've barely seen anyone wearing masks, get treated poorly don't. Restaurant bars packed well. shame took long numbers began spike, past month reopening I've seen lot posts facebook basically parroting: ""we've reopened numbers still low disease really nothing!"". 

Now coming back bite us ass. Living Spain now, assure you, half mask users break rules several times hour. Myself, bit beard every time move even slightest masks creeps down. Yesterday saw woman take mask metro bite nails holding rail, grabbed rail after... wear mask mandatory, would surprised effect total spread outside controlled expert scenarios hospitals. said really joke next day staffers said joking Probably reach full capacity faster Remember earlier week models predicted hospitalizations would peak mid July? 

Pepperage farm remembers. say transport caused die. dangerous thing do, means pay attention needed transported persons. seems outcome like patients ICU care sweden. hell downvoted? Crap. shut Camp Pendleton. think need move another country. want live America anymore. suck. nothing said wrong. immunoglobulin alone insufficient halt disease course vaccine also needed *treat disease*. corona outbreak Gällivare rapid spread western Germany give clue second wave corona pandemic look like, according state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.

How compare? Everybody knows Sweden much prepared face second wave, thanks great ""by product"" brilliant strategy (which ""herd immunity"" said ""herd immunity""? one never said that) /s    

Let's ""second wave"" occuring Germany Sweden.      
As see, there's slight increase compare end May. Nothing worrying though. Numbers still level beginning pandemics, March.    
No sign increase death curve.      
It's trend France, Italy, Belgium... probably remain way, like South Korea.     

Now, Sweden?...    
I see second wave daily cases, since first wave never decreased like european countries.      
The death curve trending downward much slowly others.    
Sweden maintains half peak, countries high death ratio squashed curve 10th peak, keep way.     
I think deaths curve continue fall, could much better.      
I wish could shown evolution ""active cases"" curve impossible since Sweden communicate number new outbreak sign Germany opening society quickly?

I'm surprised Tegnell reply ""No never lockdown first place, like us! matter we'll number deaths end..."" impose strict lockdown without done before, think would big consequences. try number things first.

Always narrative. ""thinks"" lockdown would ""very big consequences"". what.       
But urges ""try number things first."" without saying ""other things"" that, apparently, ""very big consequences"". happens become asymptomatic walk around without mask? 'basic human state' healthy feel different, killing people. seen recent months, lockdown debate, debates facemasks, etc., extremely one-sided. course, many opposing voices viewpoints, seems loudest voices ones want heard - lot based emotional / psycholigical responses rather actual discussion facts - see raise concerns often written 'murderers', 'conspiracy theorists', 'fake news', 'anti-vaxxers' etc. Ad hominen attacks place actual debate.

The populist view - *and one clearly evident forum* \- lockdowns work, facemasks work. Period. two sides debate systematically shout attack anyone agree forms line critical questioning. 

Why? many afraid beliefs challenged? Surely, correct opinion stands scrutiny, welcome critical debate. right, benefits all. wrong, benefits all. truth benefits all. Opinions don't. least much truth. 

One side debate often left equation Swedish issue, side effects lockdowns, substantial. Across globe millions made unemployed, hundreds thousands businesses closed (many, good), deaths caused people unable access medical care, personal debt going rise levels never seen - knock effects substantial. cause mental physical problems. People die effects lockdowns - possibly evem died Covid, counted daily Worldometers, never really know. country immune this. one. 

So Tegnell says.. “In way drugs side effects, measures pandemic also negative effects,” said. “At authority like ours, works broad spectrum public health issues, natural take aspects account.” 

.. correct. issue number Covid deaths. Much more. Yet focus media general substantial &amp; vocal group sub entirely focused one thing. entirely myopic almost entirely pointless. 

Maybe day able balanced debate matter finally better picture effects - across board - country based individual strategies. 

But day today - nobody concretely say Sweden's strategy (or country's strategy) faile succeeded. early that. like performing autopsy person even died. looking forward serious evaluation work made far,” Tegnell said. “There way knowing ends.” Well said, totally agree! Sweden's refusal abandon clearly failed strategy really messed inter-Nordic cooperation / solidarity, usually strong. TOP that, Sweden gall call treatment getting Nordics (as want keep borders closed it, etc.) [""unfair Cringe. hear they're adopting techniques least, even though ends giving misleading data points effective policy wasn't, save face.

Yeah, well clear treatment works control group always disbanded compassionate grounds. we'll content clear data already have. face saving quite astonishing, given situation. 

But tbh short term I'm happy let it. instance, last weeks narrative Swedish supporters become ""we've always test, Trace, Isolate"" even though *crystal clear* case anyone paid even tiny bit attention. But, whatever, let save face long end saving lives switching strategies. graphs shows 90% capacity met right now? saying 90% normal capacity? seems like it’s different total capacity. don’t see one you’re referencing post. hospitalizations jump 7 states

Well, stop testing then, silly.

**Duh!** That's skirting really close tinfoil-hat territory. WTF.
I took son paed dentist (Australia) forced us take temperature door, sign something saying symptoms. poor dental surgery 😷 takes people die. height pandemic NYC, seeing well 700 deaths *day*. literally running places put bodies. Canada, Americans sneaking in. Thanks, neighbors! sure deserve it, guess, long history of... oh, no, wait... we're Canada. I'm pretty sure deserve Fuck Mr Abbot. let Texas secede 99.99% cops good people good things. Without cops, large number us would alive right now. .001% racist sick cause problems. Stop lumping cops together calling bad people. virus new haven’t dealt anything like recently - think it’s normal health experts provide information think best data have. new information came light, efficacy masks became clear. think it’s unfair say known risks get go, knowledge compounds time lead better decisions.

[When Fauci said didn’t work, recommendation medical professionals time. I'm spreading anything.  guys get hung bias handicaps. Sure is, message different tack: agency.

If people realize charge lives - even handicaps, gives us purpose drive succeed. main gripe argument systemic unfairness suppression. poisonous, takes away belief shape life see fit. seems many US paralized belief others responsible place life. debilitating thought process creates resentment saps drive belief one self. know meant well, really opposite.

Sure, jump poverty hard, firmly believe norms values society live hold back (in wealthy country). Agency also means facing responsibility. majority Afro-Am. kids grow without father. Responsibility begins right handicap life begins right too. brought kid severe ODD. Never let go, fought millions battles 18 years, took abuse (physical too) like punching bag. studies genetics happy. Life hard, potential succeed believe persevere. waiting cars (""a line cars 3 blocks long"") drive-thru testing. biggest issue enough lab capacity run hundred tests day, pre-booking help. lol, already shit show. bad live AZ. 

damnit. i've everything stop spread, seems nobody else had. guess im months/years loneliness. makes real depressed. 3 Nice. research reading? journals? Tucker Carlson give kiss whisper truth ear? Stop trolling USA. Healthcare business. shareholder healthcare industry see dollars. Let bodies hit floor. I'm horrible person I'm hoping stuck dying ones literally voted die like first place. Well, whole shitshow started Trump administration rejected tests, CDC make (so cronies could hoard PPE supplies testing via shell corps like Blue Flame LLC).

The USA become untrustworthy pariah nation, world's reservoir coronavirus, bringing waves outbreaks every season spreading rest world. soon started soft reopening state, people took cue stop wearing masks start getting together again. I've seen everytime I've go infuriating daily death curve flat Illinois weeks we're opening up... That’s ludicrous statement. It’s even already late that, enter lockdown mode cases widespread you’re better assuming everyone infected. Yeah stay locked forever, ban everything sugar let's wrap everyone bubble wrap rest lives No, billed say. pay consum ( that's bill )  accept mutualize cost healthcare even never need it, order allow fellow compatriot taken care disease strike. nobody go bankrupt bad luck health lottery. 

I agree still pay something, nothing free. WA state, specifically Benton county. Two weeks marathon year, California 1400 new cases. on, community spread, etc. impossible quantify. Although pandemic improved life circumstances introvert, would also like go meet new people every while. Looks like reopening going well! lieutenant well, first, let's get back half TRILLION dollars stimulus whitehouse refuses tell us went.

Then people jail, let's worry 0.00000001% money went inmates. really can't help feel like lot contortion wrt motivations reframing intentionally racist POC. Exemption forcing POC wear masks. grants privilege to. 

 intention much like thinking behind POC groups spaces University college campus- there? response requests POC spaces 

The idea (as far thinking goes) safe environments. Black people said feel safe wearing masks puts heightened risk profiling. said lives risk wearing masks. isolated opinions received airtime attention . Calls made raise awareness. Videos topic received million views 

 guidelines simply created option wear anybody either trouble wearing feels risk bad consequences so.

Personally think ludicrous given pandemic rationak people hope.  clear exemption there. POC (and POC uniquely) said heightened risk discrimination wearing mask - response address concerns. Requests = results . Perhaps overly woke one lots things recently 


As long exemptions exist would individuals talking unfair is. right decide whether prefer wear wear mask. also exemption. one group bit less privilege choose. 

 Still anybody color free ignore exemption, essentially unenforceable regardless.

Most people tend follow crowd whole mask wearing thing, doubt small percentage POC living decide flaunt non mask wearing everybody else wearing one. Keep eye Ohio Illinois (technically east coast know) could Mason Dixon Line Lousiana right - NY got percent positives low - contact tracing good - okay. Please stop trying write titles grammar sucks. gotta say even degenerate Biden beat Trump due pinnacle incompetence we're seeing here. seems Florida, Texas, California, Arizona going up.

you're getting downvoted said true. II, coming Fall county near you!

Fall, probably that. Hmmm...you blindly supported delusional steak salesman three years. Said steak salesman refuses wear masks followers blindly follow him, like do.

Save heroic quotes another lifetime Little Marco. 42% Americans believe ghosts real V recovery confirmed? one exposed wearing masks time? I’d rather keep job brave getting sick.

The narrative always positive test way big deal young (and Young mean 60)
And healthy people 

There handful people damage aftermath, many worldwide???
Come on, original post still stands.
Out positives 98% literally bed couple days. Yes pandemic many cities reduced capacity limits. Chicago patio al fresco dining indoor dining bars open reduced capacity pandemic.

We also normal building code capacity limits normal times, often enforced bouncer door person. account must owned someone Desantis team. user responded say virus becoming weaker. People drop dead day receive positive test result become symptomatic. Might good get basic understanding virus works spouting nonsense. NBC article, rolling stone. combining two articles brain. ""We friend died COVID, son ventilator, almost died,"" said. ""So know real, time know facts are, feel like maybe one side plays one way side plays another.""
The Rolling Stone article mentions heavy set man. CA, FL, TX fighting CA looks like deliver big numbers.  Sorry, no. 

Just look data long term effects virus, shit isn’t bad flu. Sure odds favor you’ll get sick long terms effects, dice roll wrong might end permanent lung damage, circulation issues clots lead amputation, heart attacks / strokes, seems long term shitty state health. 

I’m active person. like SCUBA diving, snowboarding, hiking, biking, etc, want things years come. I’m going risk future happiness going bars backyard parties. Plenty ppl fly Disneyland though MUH LIBERTAE honestly think people like don’t even know consume news. Within article sources. case CNN reporting findings study published National Bureau Economic Research. CNN merely reporting study exists, claims find, supposed reasoning is. makes claim accurate study is. issue take study. part methodology study take issue with? Attacking news outlet don’t like even processing content study merely reports silly knee jerk reaction. read article would see he's one saying it. Actually, death rate high politicians thought would good idea place covid positive patients longterm care facilities.

That doesn’t account death nationwide. Also entire retirement infrastructure based nursing homes anyway. place decades run private Except thousands people dying covid chance tested.

[There plenty evidence support are. CDC conducts retroactive investigations understand scope this, updates liberal math saying thing months. wrong every time. 

 Also, increased ER visits due lockdown. know thing people told stay home seek medical help, caused tons hospitals close staff laid off? results lockdown coming home roost.

 Also COVID's death rate like 0.2% less, care.

Zero credibility, that's yall reduced yelling reddit. Reading hard. trying psychoanalyze him? NC, little people wearing mask wearing incorrectly. people need come grips new normal, masks, social distancing, etc, going foreseeable future, longer people fight it, longer worse get downplaying anything. Welcome reality. Mask lead videos stupid people refusing wear masks yelling racist stuff. Keeps happening california redhats bolder theyve ever posted another really positive article. Nothing negative comments. try post positive stuff here. Try see reactions. nuts. know they're becoming common question is, what's endgame?

What first thing second? tf wearing wearing mask become race issue?!?! wrong you, Jesus Christ places have, lot big population centers still beginning stages. sure. repeatedly said “the virus mutate become virulent instead deadly” literally mean thing. It’s something I’ve seen needs called out. numbers accurate? Gee, testing less Brazil joke needs publicly stated ~60% one specific group thinks deadly average American know care narrative America unless saviour whole world 67% people unemployment making full time (which says something wages country). many people paying rent? all, everyone saying okay outside large groups sub. outdoor events getting canned. guess water riots. global temperatures increasing, sea levels rising, access potable water become challenging.

Not everyone saw Rosie riveter poster, threw life goals started making airplane parts. thing different everyone platform make opinion public better worse mortality rate still around 2 percent? realize loaded question hard find reliable information. increased testing reduced overall mortality rate? Tell Pooh say hi. happened? thought cases stabilizing? surging due reopening increased testing? you. initial post went viral, got lot people kind like, ‘Did boost post? pushing narrative?’ "" Flores said.  meant political. supposed be me ... saying, 'Hey, take seriously. like you. think gonna get COVID. believe COVID know anyone got it. ... and got worst possible way."" 

What fuck. Posting experience illness political? What’s adding this:
-	people COVID tend occupy beds longer time
-	hospital admission growth lags time behind case growth
-	When look back situation NY, seems unlikely cases drop soon

All together, combined less strict virus suppression, doesn’t look good Houston adminstration people put there. we're left appeal self interest, problem.

When comes social distancing, there's nothing directly you. infected asymptomatic nearly so. Chances are, too. may worried anyone hang around, think fine hang around them, case.

Any consequences poorly coordinated national response explained away conveniently politically ideological known do.  Yes, I'm second option.

I Halyard fabric. I'm using 1 layer 600 thread count cotton either 2 3 layers stretch chiffon. that's lab tested almost N95 filtration (for 2 layers chiffon). However, fabric stiff Halyard fabric appears be. Every breath, gets sucked nostrils mouth. I've struggled beginning tried different things. I've finally settled 3 wire crosspiece took several masks figure sew inside mask can't see it. crosspiece handsewn attach final layer liner.

I use black polycotton blend ties. (It's fabric hand.) leaving edges raw called pattern causes edges shed constantly. decided cutting 1.5 inch ties (instead 1 inch call for) folding edges get 1/2 inch ties finished edges. cutting sewing 4 ties takes 12 15 minutes tie. That's hour make ties.

That leaves raw edges mask itself. trim chiffon fray. edges cotton glued even though topstitch *and* zigzag stitch them. real sewer, I'd serger could finish edges. 40 year old Singer sewing machine.

You come across condescending. figured making pleated, rectangular mask much quicker.

Before UF mask, made Olson masks pocket 9 pieces. still took two hours laying fabric sealing cut edges polycord candle. could never get smooth seam nosepiece using machine, always hand sewed it.

Oh, let give hint. ever try make Olson masks, use fabric check plaid nosepiece. much easier get perfect bias cut line pattern piece existing squares fabric. use cotton cotton polyblend. Stretch shiny fabrics like satin hell cut bias.

As said, I'm fast sewer cutter. I'm serious sewer. took semester sewing junior high. could thread sewing machine make square pillow. high school, met lady real sewer showed enough could make Simplicity patterns. supposed able sewn evening. always took week.

But cheaper buy clothes sew them. intervening decades, thing used sewing machine straight stitch seam fabric needed hang period made small, stuffed triangles tail ears cat toys shelter.

Hadn't touched sewing machine years got start mask making. I've rediscovered still loathe cutting. mind sewing much. loath process laying fabric, aligning perfectly (and fabric I'm using navy striped --- makes great looking mask, tricky get pattern aligned perfectly fabric's dark), marking cutting.

Aside important fact Olson mask pass fit test even though looks really nice, Olson mask hot. asthma feel lungs working harder breathe cloth nose.

I enthusiastic UF mask passed fit test got cup shape. thought would hold shape fabric would stay away nose...right tried first one on. discovered though may keep shape Halyard, cotton chiffon.

So process trying figure correct that. finally figure figure sew crosspiece inside mask.

So finally mask want. Cooler (as far masks go). Easier breathe I'm breathing pool air rather cloth pressed nose. know mask tested fit. know fabric tested filtration. 

Looks really good. fabric navy stripe something someone could wear suit.

I mask protects me. whoever wearing it. takes two hours make start finish. 2300 new cases Houston alone!? One Day?! Jesus, beyond concerning, scary shit! postponed last year due family issues. eloping now. party over. Lol, truth. never happen current admin. Actually point going try make compare states weekly weighted basis CDD reported deaths date percentage deaths weekly national trends Arkansas exhibited legit increase. California hovering Arizona. Texas shown decline. Florida. result multiple testing degree. article go much detail painting false picture.

""Billy blue screened Alamo. repeat, Billy blue screened Alamo. Code Orange, request backup. Q out.""  taken year off, straight bullshit, everyone gets paid vacation year. Cheaper long run tho? Wouldn’t seeing similar spikes northeast Midwest since there’s tons protests well? USSR block countries country itself. US far integrated civil war along civil rights movements show there's historical precedent suggesting not. projected past surge capacity weeks, still awful, likely happen, referring normal capacity projection SOMETHING! going make absurd scenarios go, yes, stay home. I'm sorry loss. appreciate snark, grocery store worker getting coughed sneezed people (up days ago) wearing masks giving fuck 

Obviously health care workers need first, don’t act like industries aren’t front line too. countless infected essential workers city Florida April (there genetic study showing corona US came NY), new york now. passive aggressive victimisation/one upmanship, numbers. Hey, coming place high incidence, we're goung make sure passenger. Australia NZ well luck alone. quarantines. wish could get Iowa. 

It's way people now... required to. steroids side effects, short-term long-term.

I think like medications risk vs benefit situation. cases benefit medication outweighs risk. drugs dangerous require special circumstances met prescribed REMS drugs.

Dexamethasone, comparison tame.

Short-term effects steroids include:

1. Weight gain
2. Insomnia
3. Hyperglycemia

Long term effects:

1. ""buffalo hump"" - accumulation fat between/above shoulderblades

2. Osteoporosis 

3. Increased risk infection

^*Keep ^in ^mind ^these ^are ^not ^all ^the ^side ^effects, ^for ^a ^full ^list, ^you ^can ^look ^up ^the ^drug ^information.*

So long-term effects steroids definitely something talk provider about, taking dexamethasone ~2 weeks less probably going major changes life (other potentially living Covid-19). Really smart move. “I don’t get it! opened economy it’s getting worse economically!” 

“Yeah, healthcare like 20% economy stop making money surgeries take care people got sick you’re entitled moron. Oh, plenty people smart enough still go restaurants events regardless government says.”  feel like watching Contagion movie real life right now, think virus movie started November, vaccine production spring. ""Slow testing"" Correction

5000 tested positive two weeks ago Doctors even classify fever. human body naturally *hovers* around 98.6°F. people run little hotter, little colder. Depends lot different things.

Other symptoms could anxiety. could fighting something Corona.

You know get tested, worried go get tested talk Doctor. lot evidence suggest unsafe vigorous exercise wearing mask. Hard exercise also DRASTICALLY increases amount virus emitting, well range. simply safe way go gym right now... home. Average last 7 days 22.5% Texas Medical Center biggest medical center world put perspective. are. read article weeks ago talking COVID-19 pushed everything forward. Everything would trickled anyways going full force ahead. Good bad. running culmination many things.  Depends whether trust China's state media honest. like go outside...just try keep distance mingle none recovering quickly United States g20 Germany maybe Canada. That's virus you.

When mononucleosis fatigue muscle aches 2-3 months initial symptoms well new bacterial infections every couple days month.

Even mild virus make feel like absolute shit. kardashian/abortion/emergence nazi zombies next level. politicians live there... waited till June end wake That’s “harrumph” ‘h’, damn it. Correlation imply causation. article highly speculative. actual trials quoted. People like told do, even more, like permission wanted anyways. Yeah respiratory illness much blood disease trigger lifelong autoimmune issues like 1918 flu Parkinson's.

This acts like herpes Lyme way lives brain, spinal fluid, eyes... Organs... Today we'll get 20k cases four states (CA, TX, FL, AZ). another 18-20k cases rest states. think real question controversial I've notice energy level lower lower feel disconnected everything. time want go away somewhere get away that's really do-able right either.

There, fixed it. conflating haircuts protesting equal activities problem. gotta admit, rocks producing antibodies would pretty interesting news indeed. ;) think COVID political religious thing yet people make political religious. wanting get beat death wanting police get away murder injustices telling people stay home spread virus thing. must great living black white box reality. /s real lockdown US anyway. 

Nothing like Italy, India China had. OooooOOOOooooopppss! didn’t actually block racists white boy Oxford skipped ahead dual phase 2/3 already started right? also already started producing vaccine assumption going safe, might available sooner one. Moderna also starting phase 3 shortly also mass produced.  
I think getting vaccinated year folks. brakes work effectively foot gas. want compare Arizona. know Arizona almost 21%. already know viruses cause diabetes? Radiation = cancer 😬 Myself. cases go deaths stay consistent, plausible explanation increased testing turning unkown cases known cases Nazi. Would hard enforce federally. Call FBI somebody isn’t wearing mask? I’m getting bad feeling NY. thought NY California we’re similar plans terms reopening. California shitting bed NY looks amazing.

Either Cuomo’s plan population done amazing job, NY getting big boost partial herd immunity. I'm redditor sounds like damn good news. passengers keep trying steer back, that's inefficient car still screwed, later usual.  **taps forehead** True, ridiculous amount stupid stuff going around world. think two weeks two months much credit 🤔 expect San Diego's rising numbers much coastal CA lot tourists visiting following rules. also get hit bus die car accident get struck lightning get murdered die hundred freak killer health conditions.

Be responsible, sure. afraid. live FL. arent staying home breakdown mask wearers even demographic 60% anecdotally.  Yeah going wait everything unwind housing takes hit. low housing stock lot people took homes market deciding hunker instead. supply extra low still looking. 

Also we'll wait government programs end start see foreclosures. mean people experience music higher level others. Jimi Hendrix, example. also means still refusing wear mask, dumber Marco Rubio pictured Everglades getting snipped off...  Lol kidding me? already know people going Vegas, getting nails done, rescheduling bachelorette parties go back 'normal'. People lock down. selfish fuck always always be... If???? hospitals get overwhelmed (and Houston least that's now, if) death rates going skyrocket, part reason death rates low modern medicine treatment (ventilators etc). that's available going get much much worse. guy fucking retarded testing phase ends? system still updated, much attention put failures. update work done emergency response, expensive. save money approach, side effect thousands starving citizens trying. Well, goes country.

This. boils blood become perfectionist fantasy culture, everyone expected 100% right god dam time. many people either hating NY, ignoring us unwilling listen. fucked honestly struggle find empathy states.  hear saying. Australia, coronavirus supplement (boost welfare payments) something else called JobKeeper payment (paid employers keep staff) payments meant run September.

A lot people want boost unemployment benefit (now called Jobseeker Payment) stay normally really enough live on. Still like US, work basically get nothing. probably protested masks. sheep. Yeah lots new people need disability i’m snowflake you’re one typing caps..... okay...... nobody’s saying fat!!!! we’re sayin nice seventeen year old child died can’t lose weight now, she’s dead. dickhead. Alternatively, someone Northeast, I'm getting anxious cases getting better rapidly reopening states outbreaks spread back region.

It feels like roles reversed. states said New York problem months ago New York basically saying oh that's states problem, fine. Sleeping. Haven’t really taken meds anything. Honestly feel pretty solid today except can’t smell shit, it’s weird sensation. Kind feels like need sneeze never do.  Also minor coughing Thanks WHO. read one number myself. gods breathing system great virus destroying it? MLB season year. Nothing. ufc testing procedures way stringent wwe  Late better never

Like Texas. Herd *Stupidity* $1200 lame, truly. need enhance extend unemployment provide kind mortgage/rent relief minimum.  brother started delivery driver Amazon week. hopefully get quit Sure. think paused ""slowed"" many monthly payments. (Pay monthly amount QUARTERLY payment, put 2 months back end, pause completely, putting back end)

Car loans, car leases, home mortgages, business leases, business mortgages.....

cut rents half/third, let landlords pause/slow mortgages properties pause/slow property taxes properties.

Then MAJOR payments reduced/slowed/paused, $1000+800/month (unemployment) least cover costs living.

Food, Power, Water, Internet, etc.... 

With proper plan help prevent bottom falling missions people, number people pushed breaking point would much lower, thus could actually slow spread could likely safely reopen things sooner. already spiking. Check new cases day.  ""freezing"" economy impossible. Aside work shopping necessities, *maybe* going play hockey week (for mental sanity even I'll probably mostly go open ice times there's like one wear mask ice without compromising play badly) really see leaving apartment there's vaccine we're massive downward trend. parents (late 70s) left voicemail yesterday saying going visit sibling couple weeks (several states away) asking good time come visit us would be. (They live halfway across country.)

Honestly, voicemail left state shock. know live state minimal deaths 100% back normal, goodness sake, seems like taking chance, age, foolhearty. lot people earning money via unemployment actual job. Many people also extremely lazy would rather stay unemployment even more. Others get work remote enjoy also don’t mind lockdown. surprise all. They're holding wrasslin' shows Florida too, around 50 people audience. Essential jobs! “Static-X, Nonpoint, Dope, Bobaflex, Royal Bliss”

I don’t think real danger large crowds attending, guys. hand, LA proper like 8000 per sq mile. Life imitates art; they're trying look like hospital dramas.

/s buddy, bud. us don’t want sit home expect government make currency. true! I'm afraid falling trend reversed new cases. hope not. We'll see guess.  still going testing deemed safe enough move onto next phase. protest today Scottsdale, Az protest masks crying loud.

I believe something stupid actually happening read post, is. guess surprised anything anymore wtf wrong people?

This stuck me: people showed protest holding signs saying ""No Masks, Yes Freedom"" ""Masks can't stop stop tracking escaped horses, know many escape, disappear like magic. Sad! ""Some people sharing drinks, weird,” said Flores, also shared drinks friends

100% moron think weird people sharing drinks. approach describe would required real national leadership, have. Yeah one $1200 check doesn’t cover rent gone within two weeks. going 3 months lockdown would roughly $1370 each, it’s possible! holding breath though lol Great analogy! Pearland definitely worst Brazoria county. Crazy watching number go fast. 65% Americans lazy pieces shit already have... really, really need revisit rule - governments craft policies discuss can't even type word ""P0l1tics"" without automod disappearing comments?

Mod team, stop censoring obviously on-topic discussions. else discuss Marco Rubio etc, P0L1ticians.

L33t spelling actually avoid censorship JFC....  Pepperidge Farm remembers. find hard believe testing more, would mean many cases! good plan. /s Psychos. Theyre fucking psychos, can't wait fined ass. fucking joking? 

holy shit..... know people selected appropriately? I’m elementary music teacher idea I’ll fall. hell kindergarteners going start school 3 days week virtual learning? don’t know students yet. 

I’m immunocompromised starting get really scared going back job also know brick-and-mortar schools going royally fuck generation students, disproportionately impact population work with, predominantly low-income non-White. It’s outdoor. Unless you’re old prexisting condition you’re shitty sibling. It’s brothers wedding outdoors risk super low. family I’d cut never speak again. They’re horrified people getting taste UBI would rather sacrifice us SCIENCE rocks! someone invent vaccine anti-science fake news gullibility please. okay openly wonder viability human race. natural reaction. ""DemonRats"" promote them, certain leaders refuse align messaging. would rather kill Americans admit people right. 300 cases today states 33,000. Times 300 10 even remotely close 33,000. separated imaginary line..... seen hard get Americans wear masks? think happen tell want contact tracing? “You mean want monitor track me? Fuuuck no!”

The administration definitely helping part problem is, always been, fierce independence, individual American thinks authority unto themselves. Worked well homestead west. much society big. got pneumonia early February (no covid test idk) missed 3 weeks college went 1 week midterms school went online. basically excluding 1 week I’ve quarantine since February 5th. feel little crazy that. spend majority year home.  too. usual, 46-55 count. survey 2,420 high school college students Also people lost lives this. PEOPLE NEEDLESSLY LOST LIVES. forgot front line workers came retirement help die. Fuck saying it’s serious livelihood after. Fuck horse rode even air stupidest comments. scary comment given Trump officially ended federal support multiple testing sites.

That can't possibly end horribly horribly wrong. Remember. The. Alamo. US politics went frenzied hyperbolic rush elevate cloth masks Covid Saviour position actually merit fat orange idiot President wear one people ignoring 2 metre social distancing rules result believe cloth masks make safe. 

It's fucking joke embarrassing country every single angle. tips :
Ventilate ur lungs breathing exercises.
Dont smoke (I know hard free hemoglobin blocked CO cigs oxygen).
Try become bed-ridden also overdo it.

If u notice serious pain and/or swelling one ur lower legs seek medical care, could thrombosis. u notice fast deterioration breathing u may pulmonary embolism. thats case call ambulance ASAP.

I know scary, reassure u ur chances recover good. 

Best wishes. Unfortunately America can't that. exactly believe taking care citizens unless make well million dollars multinational corporations. either work, get sick, possibly die go bankrupt possibly homeless, either way disposal them. almighty dollar.  ..... Dude. spike never stopped. r/Masks4All would actually make faint something. Universities, smart people generally congregate, realized fall option. Unfortunately primary secondary schools run best brightest, often completely unqualified elected trustees. guess click article find near president tells too, *exactly* like them, victim brainwashing caused conservative media ecosystem. I'd like us also able sue people, corporations, churches, states irresponsible. I've responsible since 2/15 nearly full isolation since then. punished even longer lockdown people can't wear masks? pussies can't wear mask? NY consistently dropping case rate vs. uncontrolled exponential growth Texas. literally worth arguing obviously educated epidemiology, medicine science, guarantee coming dumbass background cultural issue you. like $300 fine caught recklessly speeding, fine recklessly breathing?  dunno bad heart... unable breath properly sure seems like great way heart attack. knowing high risk issue. Many people getting sick fall high risk. 
 people high risk getting sick makes easier others get sick. lineup. Yes. I've heard, certain counties behaving better others, 1/2 population seems think masks useless Coronavirus real. disheartening.  Oh, count yet - might actually stupid. Absolutely amazing tremendous best ever They're also one country, giant collection countries (States.) There's comparison terms infrastructure. conclusion shopping has. I'm sure Trump take money immense golfing fund us, right? Reminds skit snl took nostril spreader thing american football players use made one ass. would bummer closed parks back up. don’t want go home yet. Happy cake day Paddy numbers show 7 day lag new cases, 10 day lag hospital admission 20 day lag new deaths. Big surprise. mistake open soon read article yesterday claimed herd immunity might impossible COVID. guess going learn go! Still assuming others stupid uneducated... learn lot sure yourself. Come asking stupid questions playing stupid games...

The certainty wish everyone understand really exist. fact think there's incontrovertible answer exposes ignorance history, philosophy, law, more.

It ambiguous reason. purpose. FFS... put gun head visit gym ('course, would've pandemic!). No! mean anyone really think Trump going allow Abbott shut one largest ports United States. It’s every person themselves. Welcome new Wild West. Keep yer mask ISO spray bottle cocked. Also, fucking stay home. don’t need eat out/ go bars pretend everything fine. Fucking idiots. think something inside. northern states people getting outside people southern states inside. Santa Clara County checkin in. Yup.....it's wild see divergence Bay Area SoCal last 30 days. increasing reopening, VAST majority case growth state south. 

I can't understand different ok seem fucked. assume soon shipping patients space ICU capacity.... mean… almost asking it! Static-X Bobaflex definitely new bands appeal 20 year old kids. conservative estimate tbh It's...it's like while. Yep. Founding Fathers weren’t really big progressive social policies. 

Some things like unemployment necessary evil modern society large populations, that’s aren’t burden citizens paying it.

Health insurance much higher costs much burdensome average citizen. Additionally removed incentivizes Doctors efficient, overall quality care decreases wait times grow geometrically making much difficult see Doctor quickly. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* mean control it? economy fail people work government give appropriate bailouts. would disastrous effects covid would have. 

It obviously mix opening / re-opening + fighting covid aggressively. can't shut economy again, said states opened WAYYY quickly. lockdown killed 0 person far.    
It's amazing persons mocks scientifics ""little flu"" use imaginary disasters guess people third group

Then people wrong. Plain simple.  Cough microphone, ask ""Next""? walk off. COVID-19 equivalent mic-drop. 65% Americans least half brain didnt need login CRA competent administration would do. Save lives providing necessities (food shelter). isn’t dichotomy. mean Travis instead Dallas? Worldometers showing Dallas Tarrant reported Travis Bexar always last big counties answer question, means troll. sort like Amazon round shitty company. Let them, entilited hospital care need it. referring to? saying wrong find humor times like humans done since time immemorial? Nope. Daily deaths don’t tell full story dump em. Talking weekly People don’t go bars restaurants parties etc. things people complaining about. husband's cousin getting married August. I'm fence us going. case, cousin trying wedding father (with early onset dementia) ability know what's happening, participate daughter's wedding. Honestly, that's least one better reasons I've heard someone forging ahead it, still...it's conflicting. bump couple weeks ago recently. Thankfully haven’t explode yet, keep lax it’s matter time. Small businesses also finding enforcing recommended standards either high priority time money consuming do. businesses close stuff getting infected and/or patrons aren’t coming back big enough numbers.

I referenced Governor Evers’ Badger Bounce Back haven’t even met Phase 1 criteria yet. That’s based science longer term control COVID. Thanks GOP half-assing response means it’s matter time cases skyrocket again.  China source quality? fine hate everyone think immune this. one stopping scared Boomers hiding inside. Go today! Hide long like, bother one bit. House arrest healthy people risk complications criminal constitution. get lock breaks destroy statues bet. Yikes. employees put risk moron, everyone wants forced.... quit job sacrificed unemployment people like you. NY first state deal this

I'm pretty sure Washington outbreak Kirkland. One first government interventions country remember sending UWashington kids home. several reasons Taiwan get 0 cases without fully lock down.

1. Political issue China let China ban travel Taiwan around summer 2019.

2. experience SARS believe single words CCP.

3. Wearing mask became necessary accessories walk street Late January get angry stare other.

4. Quick restrict travel pretty much everywhere around late Feb.

5. Upon arrival Taiwan, mandatory quarantine 14 days strict law punishment (up 33.8k USD several people get max fines) one follow.

6. Mask restrict selling sea overprice ensure enough stock everyone Taiwan. (At point masks getting smuggle fishing boats) 

7. still apply till today. Yep. work opened up. Estate sales Auctions. rained first auction, 100 bidders. crammed like sardines small canopy, 20% wore masks. get sick, mother luckily. boss kept saying ""Just tell protecting, Auction lives matter!"" close telling quitting.

Me mom boss actually cool, employees wearing masks. taking longer move throughout US lack density. Tom Brady though need stop pointing fingers other. need ask choice go world feed families. avoidable. 

This could non-issue two months ago joke administration said “okay, here’s $4,000 you. go outside two months, unless you’re sick need groceries.” 

They chose “bail out” companies took “payroll loans” still laid employees anyway. “bailed out” companies didn’t even need money. They’re shoring stock market $1T day. gave us $1200 cover 4 months expenses told us suck go back work needed money. 

It’s someone’s fault they’re working home, it’s fault go work. government failed us. abandoned us would rather see us dead lose productivity watch stock dip. Yeah, that's usually sort list last column there, Percent. 

If that, Los Angeles top 15% still, 400 counties 2500 counties beneath it. 

The worst county percent Trousdale, Tennessee (13%), worst ""big"" county Rockland, New York (4%). Thanks, Greggy.  IF? one complaining people going work. Yes, control it, unlike virus. saying, could selling MAGA red white blue masks make fortune. saying Actually, made unpopular decision. cares folks bankrolling him. ""Cause liberal skum drown tears; wear fucking Trump brand virus-fence."" case means people picked up. mean fewer worse thought less testing.

Edit: also exponential going due increased testing, become easier open testing facilities testing facilities testing rates linear growth. virus/disease exponential growth. really understand push get people back. Companies saving ton money floor space, utilities, supplies, etc. imagine either super extroverted people really miss social aspect control freaks want able look everyone's shoulder demanding people return. feels like zombie apocalypse scenario, except instead zombies, get widespread horrible side effects impact population years.  Thank you. oxygen hovering 91-94 I'm borderline, strict orders doctor go goes 90. started pneumonia symptoms two days ago.

This I’m really glad I’m introvert gamer disagree. like saying Tom Brady experiences football higher level others he's talented it. Hendrix monumentally talented average person think there's anything preventing average person ""experiencing music"" much. bottled cactus water once, bad, kind exotic coconut water. wouldn't, loved ones need financially. likely higher risk group I've lung issues donor tissue surgery earlier year take precedence money need make support loved ones. one position, many many Americans are.

PUA benefits run July 31st. HEROES act supposed address nothing passed congress recessing late July. 

Even something passed, live Nevada. Many self-employed folks Nevada, ton, *still* received benefits bills stopped. Peoples lives ruined this.

I think people get wrong say Covid exposed little care rich give poor, think American politics society become self-destructive actually requirement lower classes put harms way society function. Like societal meat shield whatever world tosses out. guess really news, much obvious enemy fight against.  Abbott grasp reality. Maybe way Austin whatever city he's paying attention to, everywhere. Lubbock, majority people actually wear masks stay home 40 younger 60. gap ages problem. ""good ol' boys"" holier thou Karens city refuse wear masks. mean men think fist fight virus ""masks gay"" women think special excempt gene keeps healthy. work grocery store insane many idiot Lubbockites refuse take precautions. also help Lubbock pathetic weak mayor care people either unless benefits (look whole LP&amp;L debacle instance). sad people city even go stores require wear mask they'll act like martyr agree. Workers wear masks customers refuse hope soon Texas's citizens safety Abbott requires customers wear masks. Well WWE Orlando since beginning lockdowns basically meant ""if""?  think also explains see age distribution poll. boomers fine locked down, struggling younger generations know lockdown aid means can’t pay bills. Essential business. Sign executive order Defense Production Act keep open, like meat packing plants. If? never got first wave. recall early days, Cuomo predicting NY hit first, expertise equipment would useful next hotspot. offered help states if/when needed it. I'll bet makes good promise, even though easily argue deserving New York's compassion. God helps help themselves, all. vaccine targeted - suburbs swing states. 

It probably won’t work higher normal risk side effects, that’s post Election Day problem contact friends? feel like easier ever stay contact still things online together. I'm going let gravity control life! *smuggly walks cliff* Fuck home made masks, wear respirators actually prevent getting sick well.  huh  Masks Miami Dade county mandatory caught one looking fine jail time. job bar pretty good sticking guidelines inspectors scope operation. city sending inspector Saturday morning mandatory staff meeting order go new procedures. I’d love see spread north. US might hit 40K today. California fully reported Worldometer. guess 7k cases today. Plus Texas numbers still coming in. small trickles states. Right sitting 33K Yeah sorry wording sucked, employee didn’t come back in. meant came monday( totally fine) realized stayed home still sick.  Kind panicked also went home mean, intellectually stimulating arguments like this, I'll change quickly/s yet Dipshit opened little restrictions 🤷‍♂️ medical field vast knowledge causes obesity? No, clearly not. multitude health conditions cause obesity. suggest research.  Poe's Law hitting hard one. sacrifice people economy?

this false choice anyway. think economic ramifications 0.5-1.5% population dying 6-12 months is? nothing fucking good. Source that? Dude's gonna die Covid19. way IL too. see people walking around outdoors without face-coverings, indoors EVERYONE mask. We're going hit amount cases period week so. July 4th going wild Almost one wearing wear live, new cases 11 days. 

People seem think $5 cloth masks hazmat suits ignoring social distancing rules. 

The US take everything hyperbolic extreme. cautiousness parents also protecting well. 


Taking care elders one pillars good person. took month half get two weeks unemployment symptoms company rule ""if 2 symptoms must quarantine 2 days."" almost ran savings end month trying pay bills. is. don’t enforce it. one told us 50 times would happen. one damn near begged leaders reopen. like infectious disease specialist knowledgeable well respected predicted this.

Our president put us first. break tweeting, visiting stops Coronapalooza tour, activities related pandemic looking us

Who's Fauci guy again? already stated joke. still happening though. Always double chart missing entire decade? 46-54? Im US getting $3200 month USD plus stimulus check. amazing. working 15 hours week coronavirus since lockdown ive gone $800 month $3200 nothing. ""Big business"" vs. ""People need it"" false dichotomy.

Money going American Airlines requirement can't furlough lay anyone 6 months money going people need it. Good one. People willing risk dead something like. human nature 8000 years That's potential issue, though NYC also handled pretty well, dont see Houston wouldnt able to. 

There fewer nurses there, population lower(2.4m vs 8.4m NYC) way less dense NYC, seen population density far largest risk factor area. (Over 27,000 per sq mile NYC vs 3700 per sq mile Houston.) potential outbreak hard pressed come close US already proved able handle. deadliest day two days day tomorrow... healthdata.org projection misinformation? literally projection haha. Alright, this'll last reply, happy know, clearly futile waste time. can't think oneself I'd say much part ""the problem"".

The article linked talks overflow patients can't moved temp hospitals actually helps argument? least refutes argument temp hospital usage indicative overflow. showed video overflowing ER. ""dig up"". popular post reddit couple months back. Suspiciously, original link deleted. important footage perserved.

And besides point called rest nation braindead. real point everything we're dealing here.. re-opening, masks, cases spiking, etc. thing can't let happen hospitals hitting capacity that's happened NY. that's fine early NYC goodness sake. gonna look whole lot worse another state learn mistake. guys messed up.

Great. Wear god damn mask fucking safely then.

Jesus Christ people idiots. Good quality masks. cotton use 2-3 layers paper towel coffee filter inside, change time worn..
Try avoid going restaurants. Google spread churches restaurants, spreads indoors air conditioning.  Drones face financial turmoil too! hear that? That’s sound immunity! Smells like victory July August fill trepidation now, thought maybe woudl control then. would quarantine?  Hotels? relatives house.  mother law coming tomorrow would like know fucked get 6 months full pay 6 months 1/2 pay. I'm lucky concerned voters’ wrath. fucking dipshit continue throw flaming dumpster, despite repeatedly show actively stab people back loyal him. poor people die want die anyways that's okay. Fake news. /s literally wear mask wrapped around head, knows might contract COVID eyes? win win me. Michigan checking in. governor howled mouth breathers taking seriously shit control. Also, fuck Trump antics politicize this. Guess number people die lung pneumonia going rise fast then. Like Canada point becomes numbers game. 1 person dieing tragedy course, triage dictates save can, people come hospital catch highly communicable disease spread others preferred. So, one hospital 90%, every hospital Houston? I’m right though happens contact tracers find somebody exposed refuse quarantine? point convinced White House stuff spite right now.

People underestimating this.

It’s always “their problem” never “my problem” actually is. suck, hope people get infection ptsd. beds. staffing them. make bed minutes right tools. can't make doctors. I'd shocked TSA require take off. really treatment. Basically pump oxygen lungs hope best. Maybe blood thinners less chance stroke. realize virus mutate already different strains there? One called D614G people antibodies earlier form Covid19 failed recover D614G strain. Significantly less testing whole discussion many people die couple years. it’s irrelevant. Furthermore, many casualties counted famine related timeline war, decade counts I’ve seen. really what's happening here.

Oh stop. Plenty people said okay outside people wore masks. opinion CA opened way soon. I’ve protests, protests wearing masks. think people sitting bars restaurants spreading it. mean, take mask eat drink. 

Here’s article protests Unless look metrics states involved protests see progressing upward, conclude protests. Otherwise, there's different reason play.

New York, various states, involved protests appear impacted numbers. They're still gradually reducing number cases deaths. able really ramp testing entire time locked down. 

Texas &amp; bunch states this. feel like primary reason we're seeing numbers spike places haste reopen economy even though little done improve testing treatment since March. Gov.

More likely multiple countries develop manufacture populations. economy continues collapse government keeps printing money Half country stand head government tell to. Covid stop till vacinee even might help well RemindMe! 110 days  base doesn’t give shit. Denmark Norway make pretty poor comparisons. Denmark tiny flat land, population smaller, fairly dense still.

Norway similar thing going on, welfare quite developed ours; they've relying developing oil industry instead.

Finland apt comparison, similar size spread population, strong social safety net. populations spread clusters, that's reflected outbreaks.

Instead big waves infections, like bubbles rising top bursting.

Either way, comparisons moot lockdown never option Sweden begin with.

Generations past, Sweden younger still largely religious, pretty much belonged parish. order travel beyond parish, either get passport lord land, priest.

At point people got fed this, banded together ensured freedom movement writing Constitution. 

I know lot folk US believes government Sweden big overreaching, really not. freedom movement makes government can't issue lockdown, first they'd amend update Constitution, believe discussion going on, fast.

At end day, trust government, department health. plan thus far worked out, hospitals health services running capacity, even models presented fit - folk charge stupid.

I think lot people remember 2020 rough year. High unemployment, lockdowns, uncertainty one's future, protests, US attacking people. 

For though, 2020 good year. uncertainty start year, March bleak month, three months later things looking great. plans coming together, work going fantastic - days Covid19 even cross mind. Tricitian well, funny people pissed Gov. Inslee too. don’t know bad need get people take seriously. 

What really pisses though serious President taken this. would take come say masks save lives necessary wear one public. know, actually lead. Solid prediction, I'm guessing differently think push open forcing people back work end added unemployment then, virus shuts businesses again, (fear/lockdown) impact could wrong. See month! locked inside since pandemic started. city mostly opened since Memorial Day. decent chunk city seemed go back normal life soon stores opened (including wearing masks). ""right now""

Here's hoping gets learn disease first hand Man, know Europe often follows US, many cases good. hope skip BS here. hope right! Better ask forgiveness permission. Says dude probably doesn’t know it’s like support family. don’t count number patients ICU, there’s problem

-Trump probably No, think thing happen happened 08:

lots people lose sell homes, homes bought deepest pockets - corporate landlords thousands units already cashflow buy.

it exacerbate income inequality. little guy, get deal. big dogs keep out.

During 08 bunch people wanted buy forecloseures auction. infamous thuggery surrounding auctions, would-be buyers harassed threatened auction rigged get properties hands small number corrupt investors. investors turned around rented back would-be homebuyers could find affordable starter house landlords bought up. rent would go fast possible, keep renters every competitive buy property. That’s incorrect. Covid associated increased blood clots, show cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, stroke. Ironic countries closing borders Americans dangerous to. No, stop.

Stop asshole idiot.

Stop uncritically believing lies.

COVID NEARLY serious media certain politicians say. never risk overwhelming hospitals, initial reaction reasonable (rather safe sorry).

Now months data shows par bad flu, take common sense precautions like advising at-risk peoples stay quarantined wear masks. vast majority relatively healthy people get lives normal.

Yes. get sick. Eventually.

Deal it. doubt employee GNC would agree ‘concept’ . Im sorry called ass done. moratorium needs extended, either mandate landlords freeze rent payments till later, sort support given landlords like maybe government gives half rental would gotten loan need pay back moratorium ends? something. Evicting bunch people consequences:-

* Social unrest - looting rioting?
* Evictions states mail voting means people chance vote permanent address changed, leading under-voting possible fraud landlord gets hold ballots
* mention evicted people need pay money DMV ($40? ish?) new drivers license new address, assuming get new place arent even thinking medical bills larger portion admitted ICU. get that. (and continue be) careful always wear mask outside house. daughter working Ireland, would able go visit wanted to. People joke mean telling can't see raising tariffs? He's exactly de-escalater Sadly 139th position tests per capita. seeing tip iceberg. Funny economy re-opened (and removing unemployment protections) Abbot's mansion office closed public No, tell irrational sentiments hyperbolic words. Bullshit sure seems way, sadly, would hope, people talking ones need told that. Trust me, many us banging heads frustration idiots around us. 

I feel people make money support family. last job, laid off, go 1hr - 2hr meetings sit next guys openly restrictions, social distancing, overall blatant it. CEO felt way impossible go work completely avoid idiots inside office. big reason laid off(openly vocal lack protections), people supposed can't afford lose job situations? We're going F'd long time. testing more, people get symptoms likely go get tested.   flips yells ""hoax."" zooms right crowd. seriously don’t see go back school fall. wife elementary school teacher terrified. way safely open schools. fall gonna seriously scary shit. multiple reasons covid, economy, election. hope folks preparing cause something don’t anyone seen modern history. gloat I'm angry. like people try spread scary information might true, I'm already worried enough senior year seriously affected, want worry necessary Triage worldwide. disheartening choose happens due lack resources. sex. 100% chance getting pregnant. fundamentally disagree here. 

I believe warning country president intention protecting us. disagree. see going get past this, simply agree sometimes people need expand role warn people danger regarding hundreds thousands lives lost, that's administration's response represents. 

It's like people think Mueller right stay lane instead pulling fire alarm. simply agree that. There's probably nothing left say here, since fundamentally disagree this. I'm SOBX none tourists wearing masks. rural county hospital like 2 isolation beds. also doubled county positive count last 3 days (30s 60s). 

We fucked.  It’s hateful comment politely someone overweight. comment teenager died viral complications “ fat Fuck” least means you’re asshole, hateful.  Hair Fuhrer said “slow testing” order. That’s Fauci talking past tense, didn’t realize Dump meant effective immediately. Used anti gun back day, seeing police behave don’t think anti gun left Ohio. a. month ago id say city almost 50% mask compliance... now? maybe 5%. disappointing.

I want ask they're selfish... Americans predictably unpredictable, hard predict  Every state reopened getting shellacked right now, overly cautious all. actually saying order support BLM think people *have* believe **no** legitimate uses police? doesn’t account death nationwide. 

But obviously big factor areas like New York New plenty evidence support are. CDC conducts retroactive investigations understand scope this, updates daily.

I rephrase last comment. meant thousands people dying covid regular basis recorded cases. Obviously since beginning outbreak country thousands deaths, nowhere near amount compared positive carriers never laboratory confirmed test.  Soon UFC hoard PPE necessary hospitals   

Context can't read comment Fair enough  Really? ASU never really noticed that. 8 years ago. China best numbers per capita world? Florida Man okay? hero need times cannot leave us! trying find sources Tegnell's statements, loosing time. way ""think so"".

This article says daily record new case numbers happening right 7 states, including Texas:
www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/23/coronavirus-live-updates-us/%3foutputType=amp

This article says record numbers cases happening right Texas:
www.businessinsider.com/texas-record-coronavirus-cases-governor-tells-people-to-stay-home-2020-6%3famp

Not surprising considering Texas one first states reopen.

If government trying cover actual number cases, you’re right. logical thing want hide fact coronavirus cases still rising. Auf conditioner.

Really uncommon Germany. near factories them. Could part slow here, compared second part first wave US. Houston big place several hospitals 97% percent capacity... Masks mandated VA, yet see less less every day, even employees like said.

And going Phase 3 July 1st.  Interesting. make sense significant population people susceptible getting infected, children people work home, herd immunity threshold could reduced. 43% seems odd though considering Bergamo Italy saw 57% residents test positive That's exactly said. person covid symptoms..... hoped ""checkmate"" would show understood joke piling on. idiots ride Red Short Bus pee part pool, us adult section suffer lack hygiene. Well, wrote whole thing automod removed it. I'm even sure word triggered point. Ugh. Maybe could hit body tremendous ultraviolets? scientists, socially active individuals are, likely get infected, less socially active ones -- also likely infect people become infected.

That logic solid. Still think absurd non-strategy adopt outset. 7 months later people still don’t believe answers even made available  r/yourpointbutagain article limit use surfaces also suggests looking fitting HVAC systems along filters really clean air reduce circulating germs enclosed spaces, mounted lights air circulators help individual rooms. always wear mask, sadly, last week went Sam's Club, saw people starting take masks, even including kids. Definitely hundreds thousands millions protestors around country. lock long? live still businesses closed since March. much longer going make it? Wearing masks isnt going make go away either. Especially since one wears correctly. Trumpeached tossed jail paying money open could re-elected. Well minimum residents Florida need get heads asses. likely happen time soon? Damn ppl like point China hiding data. Many organs affected. people end needing kidney transplants lung transplants.  one saying protests completely ok. extremely irresponsible, WORLD difference mass protests, symptom outrage frustration, vs. marathon.  cannot cancel mass protest organic largely spontaneous responses. cancel marathon scheduled happen months advance. Hopefully see difference here. actually make influenza vaccines, while. They're made British (Seqirus {owned Australian CSL} GSK) French (Sanofi) moment.

This major problem Swine Flu pandemic, since companies prioritized home markets. Printing money one make spending velocity lockdowns, works unfortunately actually more, technically.

$600/week. Dividing 365 days 12 months equals 30.41 days/month . 30.41 days/7days week= 4.35 weeks month.

So really looking $2,610/month federal UI benefits. least end July. person dies Covid presents cardiac arrest, that’s definitely something checked for. people around warned they’ve exposed Covid, also counts death Covid. Thats heartbreaking :( 

Cant imagine parents must feeling situation memes..left tears ;( great promised....Amazing president. Top noch Zero sympathy.  Yeah sarcastic myself. time period satire reality hard tell apart. 

Although antisexual, actually expect people adhere celibacy. What's expected time frame completion P3? Also idea population size P3? Tl;dr

&amp;#x200B;

""Factories and, particular, indoor areas cold damp, perfect environments coronavirus linger spread,"" according Lawrence Young, Professor Molecular Oncology University Warwick.""

"" Another possible factor refrigerated workplaces noisy machinery, requires people talk loudly shout, increase spread infected droplets.""

""When people standing right next working heavily - course difficult job - breathing heavily, chance spreading virus one infected individual many close proximity.""

""Some factories on-site nearby accommodation several people dormitory. may transported bus site work, indoors together day.""

""The union says often speak English first language worried losing jobs, may reluctant raise concerns."" ""God create us wearing clothing either, whip titties Rebecca?"" people wait 10 hours get tested. everyone kind time work can’t imagine many people virus haven’t gotten tested yet. heard every one person infected, 10 more. Vaccines exist viruses immune system cannot properly develop immunity - either individual population level.

How? One way giving two vaccine applications interval. kind exposure occur naturally, cases cause immune system develop antibodies sufficient defeat future ""natural"" exposure. case MMR used improve coverage herd immunity.

Another example Polio. never developed natural herd immunity Polio, vaccine eradicated.

So even turns immunological profile SARS-CoV-2 allow ""full"" herd immunity (e.g. resulting endemic cyclic outbreaks) worse, many individuals gain proper immunity, may still possible create vaccine.

Vaccine technology advanced lot, ways work around problems imposed specific immunological profile. Must additional testing context missed largest medical center world thats obvious fact think intentionally ignored it. July fine. August tougher. 


The extra $600/week goes end July. I'm taking thing seriously following rules, big thing many people chastising fear-mongering even plan. originally 'flatten curve' prevent hospital overload, largely failed happen, people still trying apply principles. Multiple people told go visit family outdoor cookout, none could articulate *would* okay. like one day we're going wake virus going gone, decide we're going get back life. 

Another faction people pissing people forget sacrifice something difficult greater cause. Key words: ""something difficult"". wear mask, follow distancing guidelines, fuck people understand complain much sucks. able read people's smiles, able go dancing, barely see friends. I'm understand sometimes give something important. there's certain breed smug jerk loves nobody bars, spends life indoors playing nintendo, can't understand hard people. explains want untrue. understand wish could wake like none shit 2020 happened. There's also association rubella virus coronavirus antibodies overlap could also helpful us got MMR vaccine 40+ years ago might need close indoor contact risk. PA pretty good went Ohio last weekend hardly anyone mask on. needs real reform education kids made hate school learning much. hard people power really want educated mass. want people educated enough manipulated. much worth young people comorbidities potentially expose virus don’t live old risk people/wear mask stores? 

I’m talking like, hanging friends. killing teachers kids. Well studies say people get reinfected weeks recovery? lol mid March again? Feels like Deja Vu way ... manage this? Like ONE hospital large area dedicated elective procedures, rest COVID hospitals? curve flattens, ever re-opened states. Sweden denied treatment elderly keep ICU's empty 

They also prescribed palliative care rest homes. attempts made help patients instead given drugs effect hastened department asked share name bar. Really? attacks old people. People underlying conditions. People autoimmune deficiencies. Obese people. Vitamin deficient people. perfectly healthy people dying outliers. always outliers. I'm overly concerned. Anything kill moment. risk analysis. one demographics. Almost certainly fine. Sounds like mother nature me. nightmare watching yesterday. Almost moved OC couple years ago changed jobs working Corona.

That idea completely dead now. Uh...what? 28 times 6 million equals 168 million...we many tests... quote little base...by 140 million! 504 beds could added Houston ICUs emergency ""unsustainable surge"" plan, TMC would implement address ""significant, temporary"" influx patients, according report.

Still ways go yet. Days, even. NJ citizens good, lot PA NY plates shore crowding beaches 

Overall north central well, south lagging bit Lol gathered much. texting friend yesterday got bashed group chat suggesting people wear masks leave house necessary rather boredom. Texas. Majority area backyards vast walking trails keep stir crazy. Anyway, told her. “I’m imagining I? Like, haven’t come late onset schizophrenia I’m reading numbers don’t exist? feel like I’m reading/seeing imaginary things ppl tired playing along pandemic fantasyland now.” take quite sickest young people die.

Also helpful treatments improved situation bit. Thanks scientists! I'll agree this, think data shit. Gotta disagree here, bud. We're seeing history repeat itself, want agree, make feel good. Suffer well. well said states may need “absolute” shutdown, could mean lot Fear drives contributions. I've heard ppl r/coronavirusVA area better job lot places state. I'm Tidewater area even employees wearing masks anymore places. Unsurprisingly, cases nudging upwards. hope area continues downward trend. Stay safe friend. That's problem winner take voting system, explained Hassan Minhaj show. People end voting candidates reflect values order someone worse lose. friend mine went vacation Hilton Head ago (his wife's mom house there, drove) went restaurant request outdoor seating, people wearing mask *everyone restaurant turned around look many people pointing laughing.*

Are dumbest major power? feels like we're dumbest major power. I'm sure works US, transfer neighboring states ICU beds kicking street? need whole sub “vintage” COVID posts. Fatboy!!  No, remember whatever. It’s perfect system current government slowly privatising years nose (lucky they’re boards companies winning healthcare contracts, right!) it’s definitely beloved institution general appreciation important pandemic. 

For example, start lockdown, country stood doorsteps 8pm clapped two minutes “for NHS” everyone hung pictures rainbows windows. Going walk kids deserted world spotting rainbows windows real joy lockdown. real feeling everyone pulling together get it.  Wish mentality (what get shut down) ten thousands people gathered reasons since pandemic started regardless reason gathering. Might better currently are. salaries increase companies tech jobs move.

Silicon valley salaries high companies want pay much.Its thats price premium talent.

Google pay engineer 250k Facebook willing pay 225k.And Netflix comes wit offer 300k. Canada handle well, defining moment history. country better position Canada absorb jobs right now. Interesting make connection even though cities largest protests states small numbers new cases.

Whereas states little protesting (florida, texas, lousiana, carolinas) seeing highest growth rate cases.

the correlation 'no honest person ignore' falls apart quite dramatically examine protest numbers compared covid growth.

The *only* state large number california. put May. Never heard them. heard summer job last year offered position work home. Screw you, Labor Department! went form 90% Monday 97% today...

So much 2 weeks.

Should surpass 100% tomorrow.

:( true, we'd see hell lot done, distancing/masks/staying home etc. skeptical findings. Sure! Happy help. Glad you’re good now! wondering anyone advice calming staff scared positive COVID cases reported department?? bosses aren’t handling well understanding fear people won’t let stop working. wait 4th July! Even 40k due delayed reportings results 1-2 days before. general trend deacellerating, doubling times increasing. sure anymore. I'm 30s live parents 60s ( hard times come up) 

You need apologize this, embrace it. relatively common outside US, good financially, probably going cherish extra time parents future. risky wager lives people. somebody wager point here? done response rising cases, course still spiking. mean safe yet? idea Don’t forget Feds using CDC FDA stop private, state, university labs testing. neighbors Nebraska, people assume lockdown problem gone. Ive seen less less masks ever since. agree completely, even pretty well educated people wont wear one unless required to. people would fight simple requirement. heehee alcohol kills germs  Smdh Sweden, yes, countries basic functions normal economy kept alive. European countries even problems harvesting food fields. Based extensive profound medical knowledge? 

So insightful guy. Looking forward it, society needs collapse already Yet narrative spun reopening.

Isn't odd one behavior much higher transmission propensity? place March shut numbers exploded Ya too. literally feels like conspiracy going front eyes, ""COVID doesnt exist"" conspiracy. Well talking entire timeline once. Yes first way time went considered insane wear mask. San Francisco went ""anti-mask league"" cops able shoot people wearing mask publicly celebrated. course, virus lot immediately deadly way hell advocating that, there's ignoring public perception changed radically course events one. EDD page listen media, government officials, etc. disinformation flows top implied authority office president results confusion dangerous behavior.  Citation needed. could call cops, feds prosecute federal crimes.  refused swab show symptoms. Wife got swabbed plus chest X-ray. 1-3 days wait White supremacists minority, difficult, I'd imagine. trying get dragged conversation regarding would occur revolution, would speculative. If? Thank you! Deaths usually one worst indicators rampant virus is. Yes measured deaths obviously, cases keep going matter what. already buffer time cases confirmed positive accounted for, even bigger buffer time deaths, especially since coronavirus doesn’t kill one way either. mean several different systems attacks body contracted. Work forced hand.. hard yourself. We're trying best can. Believe me, way ahead game compared many others. linked everyone pile on... Really wish articles would state whether deceased underlying condition(s)...they almost never important part story I'm proud Marco. thirty-five percent said, confused way question worded. absurd compare UK response Covid-19 New Zealand. densely-populated country heart international commerce always going deeply affected country limb southern ocean, 1000 miles landmass. 

If New Zealand going devastated epidemic anything would scrapie, Covid 19 – even sharp reduction recent years still 27 million sheep, nearly six every man, woman child. largest city, Auckland, population 1.6 million, compared London’s 9 million.  

New Zealand country rural settlements low-density suburbs social-distancing come naturally – opposed Britain huge numbers live tightly-packed housing commute crowded tube trains.


Moreover, Covid-19 arrived New Zealand middle summer, viruses lowest chance spreading.

The University Maryland mapped early outbreaks virus found concentrated belt northern hemisphere average temperatures range 5 11 Celsius – Britain throughout March. 

Ardern’s government credited closing borders – 19 March. Yet somewhat easier self-sufficient food and, thanks geography, relatively little international traffic. New Zealand 700 international flights landing airports week – Britain day. addition, trains ferries arriving European countries constantly – source traffic New Zealand have. particular, lot arrivals Spain Italy, virus already well established.

Far quicker respond coronavirus, New Zealand fact locked day later Britain, 25 March. Prior that, like Britain, country went week partial, steadily increasing social distancing measures. Gatherings 500 people banned 12 March. Bars restaurants close 23 March, two days Britain.

Jacinda Ardern served adviser Tony Blair’s government. stayed become British Prime Minister would almost exactly experience done. New Zealand lucky escape worst virus; led much differently Britain. true. It’s hitting healthier population better treatments article indicates. one standing behind doctor tried say it’s less virulent. Trump needs couple rallies market lows nice dip buy. Kay bro, keep peddling bull crap. Yes, Americans would prefer alternative dying. wish karma worked way doesn't. lot careless people go avoid virus shear luck, catch deal simple mild case passing someone gets horrific case. lessons learned, guilt felt. Darwin take wheel! Jesus city start running beds serious community problem. increase hospitalizations continue, lag 10 days measures reduce transmission shows hospitalizations. Americans: that’s fucking poster  It’s summer high tourist season. don’t shut certain areas COVID brought back regions US. 

Shits get real. Here's Mississippi's latest chart cases/deaths running 7-day ranking terms per capita  one actually enforcing self-quarantine NY. go really care much. Sorry loss Test positivity rates creeping up, good. That's lie hope he’s around see full extent damage he’s done. agree. fear. appropriate amount. overkill. Diseases supposed take weak. Doesn’t mean anybody wearing masks Ohio. forget ""they're counting car crash victims covid deaths"" like sentiment. Mine may bit simplistic. ones got Bachelor finale level ratings! Despite article says, believe stupidity domains brain people can't resist crowds. virus Ba Sing Se think caught it? hope it’s January. Considering running though, don’t ton hope. Right now, literally almost anyone ran independent I’d vote them. It’s almost like that’s plan wanted make sure could blame certain demographic people it.  brother law potentially going put situation. moved Houston start specialty residency may get reassigned hospitals region 97% capacity yesterday. would trust procedures, types treatments want dr, outside specialty, rushing through. Pointless. one going comply this.  Well, also seems [advocate approaches sustainable long term. sure exactly feel that, think people try approach longer term perspective. live state lockdown early saw lot success preventing spread; however, three months later cases starting rise people seem unwilling comply anymore. Physical distancing measures movement restrictions, often referred “shut downs” “lock downs,” slow COVID-19 transmission limiting contact people. However, measures profound negative impact individuals, communities, societies bringing social economic life near stop. measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people poverty, migrants, internally displaced people refugees, often live overcrowded resourced settings, depend daily labour subsistence.  countries introduced widespread physical distancing measures population-level movement restrictions, urgent need plan phased transition away restrictions manner enable sustainable suppression transmission low-level whilst enabling resumption parts economic social life, prioritized carefully balancing socio-economic benefit epidemiological risk.

ha ha hello human internet. thing. Secondly, virus spread world, federal govt taken seriously wouldn’t necessarily spread nyc way did.

Did read LlebOcat9 comment? Trump suggested NY quarantine people flipped out...do want strong federal response not?  Quite frankly strict NY quarantine would FAR cases. Thirdly New York gone hell back states country want continue take seriously thousands fellow Americans died god damn right New Yorkers quarantine hell anyone comes state respect.

Aww.....pure hypocrisy. Can't quaratine NYorkers, sure hell quarantine you. P.s.....New yorkers take seriously there's pictures interwebs congregatting. mention leaders saying worry changed thier tune. 2020...PLEASE CHILL FUCK DOWN! value loyalty group things, even reality. think group demands believe disease hoax, plot, media hype, cure worse disease, economy important lives, etc etc, believe.

They integrity. loyalty. Oh racist? crime, well that's mass-immigration 

According French stats, stats almost every country planet, people country commit majority crimes. know. Common sense numbers. Fewer immigrants citizens. 

On top that, I'm American means. Keep throwing line means absolutely anything. 


But good know opinion valid. Bye Officer. thanks don’t listen advice traitors. chance testify admin nothing one hospital concentration dozens hospitals one location. Please wear mask. saw first wave deaths tend lag infections. know it’s old trite, wait 2-3 weeks. said shit Memorial Day weekend. Wait 2-3 weeks. Look meteoric rises cases. deaths don’t spike like first time hopefully averted disaster. doesn’t seem likely given literally happened months ago. Arizona shown us that, no, every place preparing possible second wave. wrong. Everyone please wear masks! They'll protect you, family, community. Yeah, lost shit-ton stuff used fun interesting coming back there's vaccine (which may never). lost already-paid-for trip Hawaii. may never work again, etc . . . actually liked job, that's likely returning time soon. really dont think enforcing mask wearing going make much difference. Ive heard friends NJ everyone follows it.  could tell someone came state, doesn’t tell adhering quarantine actually inside state, long stay highways. protests country. protests, outbreaks localised? coming indoor spreading tends happen. Georgia. I'm usually one non-employees wearing one grocery store. I'm employee wearing one office (that made us come back working home couple months). feels inevitable we're going hit hard soon. get first.

When first read like fuck Rich important lol I've avoiding contact New Yorkers whole life. effective. help unemployment numbers dead people can't work... /s many states knowingly intentionally made getting application process impossible. people filed March still waiting. It’s useless whole bunch people. Wasn’t 16.9% like two days ago?? sorry kid sick. However, one case. Netherlands evidence true study. didn’t say impossible, rare. Jersey great crowding shit summer season. even want go beach. know they're going impose 14 day quarentine, think anyone coming follow it. didn’t believe COVID didn’t know anyone got it. ... got worst possible way.

There whole ton shit don’t know anyone personally dealt with, don’t write lies. ignorance insane. let Desantis see 1) shortage beds equipment staff. Yakima Health District says healthcare system Yakima County exceeding capacity due ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, hospitals running beds. Virginia Mason Memorial Hospital tells KIMA-TV problem lack beds, rather shortage staff care patients.

2) Perhaps furloughed staff couple months in, would ""scary situation"" totally result hospital laying workers revenues down. Talk shooting foot. true everyone, many people like this. Yeah called tumor conservativism going offer solutions? going state obvious? Anything indoors risk. state in? Maybe look current Covid infection rates make judgment call. (Keep mind certain states accurate testing)

Edit: source infection extremely difficult determine especially almost non-existent contact tracing US. fact heard anything related hotels useful indicator safety. Thats point... started reopening long time ago started hitting us bad. starting reopen. Fauci myriad medical experts predicting massive increase covid states reopen without adequate prevention measures. Yet expect flood news stories large crowds venue, saying ""Golly gee, cases now, *I can't imagine happened, came nowhere*.

The number people simply can't make connection virulently contagious plague, people getting sick crowded together, mind boggling. masks; every single American knows doctors wear wearing masks century, yet people can't connect dots. 

If willfully ignorant endangering lives family, I'd cheerfully watch catch covid care one bit. We've war machine since vietnam.

Other countries gearing we've pulling of/away UN.

Take pick. There’s reason cases rising there. Going gym could major one. Unneeded excursions major spreading factor. figure workout place. Without knowing complex like think it’s hard say exactly, us y’all say certainly yes gym high risk activity especially sharing others hot spot area.

Edit: also, can’t work house? That’s I’m doing. months staying gym won’t kill going one could, quite literally. Great, thanks. true, constantly coming better ways treat it. Delay long enough get cure vaccine. Also masks reduce viral load exposed probably improve chances good outcome. reason masks good enough can't burned masks instead herd immunity. speed running time.

Yay? Speaking which: fuck Rob Schneider coronavirus denialism conspiracy bullshit.  tested?
You get test COVID-19 if:

You develop symptoms COVID-19, even mild, or
You close contact someone tested positive COVID-19""

Testing Massachusetts random sample population. heavily biased towards selecting infected. full moon chance people Texas that. agree you, chance. 

I would thrilled wrong. Really though? Got source? blame protests entirely find hard believe contribute.

Everyone outside, many people wore masks still low-risk situation considering dense people were. see news today west Germany locked wondering spikes read shit like this. WTF wrong people. misleading title produced get reaction politically influenced people. could've worded much efficient way. thinking make question less. Infection becomes almost guaranteed even stay inside 99% time wearing n95 masks, spread hits certain threshold larger population. 

Whew, great thing mortality rate low guess. actually haha quit part time McDonald's got whole bunch unmasked people crowded registers \~80% survival.

77.78% actually. Good know. Thanks educating instead voting me. surprises NC it’s never gone down, all. It’s steady upward climb since March.

Lots people understanding elective surgery too. wait, elective, run risk dying waiting, ELECTIVE. Yeah issue can’t stay locked forever, reopening need new process put place.

California incredibly well virus hit, locked first stopped flights state. numbers really low density population size.

Now open it’s going skyrocket didn’t control waited out.

New York Andrew cumo fantastic job, wish would run president specifics, nothing said travel advisory going effect staters need quarantine.

Nothing that’s actually going enforced there’s real way enforce it. What? serious? countries? thought maps showed dragons US ended. Excellent Assessment! Wow, even politically illiterate common sense test themselves! remember now. 3 4 months ago. course, still need signup it. random test people willing it.

filmed japanese filmmaker. **EVERYONE played role. fast food workers taxi drivers.** show US media best propaganda world bar none. really expected better California. Good luck wife! I’m sorry tell this, already have. They're still reopened enough time. Average incubation symptoms 5 days think.

I'm confused, originally stated comment? feel like I'm gaslighted lol government subsidize its' population least $2K per month stay home pandemic over. mean seen in-laws, still same. people still sort socialization. Immunity doesn’t wear off. virus mutates enough longer fully recognized long term immune system memory.

Its important understand difference two points. Immune system failure memorize long term thing highly mutating virus, like common cold. know protecting others yourself

This exactly think many people care. directly help them, bother? People understand wearing mask protect stranger much person wearing mask. Speedy recovery, buddy.

Californian here. Wear mask shopping. Stopped gas station day governor mandated masks wearing one addition employees. ten customers building time, none wearing masks. -_-

To note: live generally conservative county California people treat virus like hoax (which isn't) part. cure exposure

According site herd immunity requires 70-90% population become infected. Ask many would die 70% infection rate reached? right since shutting 14 testing sites. think meant gross. think meant direct. think meant rub noses people things it.

Tests random sample population really work like that. test lower positive rate get. Lol fit narrative getting downvoted worst part lot states like Texas Florida reporting hospitals already capacity already late. done start spike. Also hell getting elective surgery pandemic? need risk assessment.I don’t know exactly obviously, there’s reason spend summer sitting tight apartment weeks end. ways get low risk, like beaches non-peak time, going hike. 

We good idea difficult virus spread outdoors point. NJ opened parks beaches may 15, tell PACKED first hand experience. Despite this, it’s month numbers continue drop. Part people cautious wear masks crowds state, really show won’t get disease walking door. ways get together keeping safe! America mask rules. buy mask doctors needed them. Hell even Dr Fauci says face it, government said make masks, Americans instead would bought N95 hospitals needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hell Americans bidding COUNTRIES mask shipments. imagine badly things could around world. course cases rising. looking recoveries only, downward trend instead upward trend. hospitals discharging people without testing them, take genius figure numbers going explode.

There literally people lost wives, fathers, grandparents... Dead... get post they'd wish die COVID, since they've already died. NY overwhelmed shutting thing stopped dead people streets medical system completely collapsing, Houston seems next.

Economy struggles function locked down. Economy struggles function ton people dying severe complications easily communicable disease. going tough either way. know, instead predictable insults ""told ya so's"" get thrown around, I'm gonna focus part article actually really encouraging: hospital, doctors used oxygen tank assist Flores' breathing gave mixture antibiotics corticosteroid treatment.

Oh wait yeah sounds terrible. Texas headline ever saw one. ;)  feel sympathy type people. months 100k dead US alone. still don’t take seriously you’re moron asking catch it. exact situation would want avoid ? Could get messy unfortunately. True, NY first state deal this. Cuomo’s daily press conference would say states “you learn us”. sad thing everyone busy hating Cuomo making mistakes early totally terrible situation either didn’t, even worse, intentionally wouldn’t, learn NY’s experience. NBA year. last positive case NBA news. over. Hi U.S.A!
Your banned travelling EU..because COVID ,not many passport....Does includes Donny aswell👍🤣🤣🤣 Explain people protesting thousands packed together going spike cases??? support BLM believe needs fundamental change can’t deny fact... I’m Phoenix suburb people wearing now, thankfully. comes crime wave things concern things don’t need consideration whether long term effect. 

By mean people scarring lung tissue aren’t going snap back full activity body clears virus. People strokes blood clots aren’t going suddenly recover. People like Tony nominated actor leg amputated circulation issues due virus aren’t going bounce back. 

That shit permanent I’m feeling like risking sort thing need avoid risk stay home see people, wear mask out, use sanitizer, wash hands. Here’s thing you’re looking at- doctor saying (that case numbers overrated) isn’t consensus field epidemiology. weigh whose perspective seems plausible given virus played far. Step 1) Make disease

Step 2) Make cure / treatment

Step 3) Profit difficult measure success lockdown considering unevenly enforced came late avoid first wave anyways. 2nd lockdown effective addition measures (like *gasp* testing!) actually reduce spread. I'm USA know states I'm asking, one places ""beating"" virus one new ones initial outbreak now? Good point. graph almost exactly dictates upcoming election results. reverse age groups. can't afford lock-down again. send work I'll take chances. really another option living refrigerator box 2 months. Curbed outbreak ass. need billboards read

wear damn mask God didn’t create wear makeup glasses either, Karen. Shutdowns damage virus. shutdowns actually contradict current recommendations address relative vulnerability demographic. expert policy groups saying need get young healthy low risk populations working getting sick fast possible isolating elderly sick. total 5% exposure first wave need 12-16 waves size expose population. problem immunity may less year never get side using shutdown model. It’s literally impossible without vaccine effective treatment.  Treating minorities differently based ""race"" straight racism. Coddling discrimination matter, still racism.   really varies lot--anecdotally tell husband's work Central Florida testing everyone 5 7 days get back (the person got positive last night, tested last Thursday) True. wearing masks make go away. prevents/slows spread cure found, even found all. main testing lab processes 80% Arizonas tests reported yesterday significantly capacity least days last week getting tests twice fast processing them. mentioned turn around time 8 days right now. Tests processed today way down.  LA county better country average terms major racial disparity latinx person getting COVID proportion makeup general population True. Fair point many variables. somethings point out, US large portion pop making unemployed due extra 600 week federal government one factor recovery strong compared economy normal looks like 20 percent unemployed. Second real estate market right super low inventory areas actually driving prices. say month unemployment same, s+p slightly up, nasdaq 2 percent, real estate up. I'm washing more, whenever go public put hair secure bun avoid touching like avoid touching face. Mattis wrote letter saying emperor isn’t wearing clothes it’s Wednesday again. US sounded like: damn person x using logic common sense!
Is depressingly uncommon country? Wifey EM MD North Dallas hard time transferring patients admitting due capacity. note elective surgery started recovering patients also taking beds too. hope spent last three months preparing like been. overflow ICU units set every major hospital area. Thankfully none used.

Florida sounds like young folks contracting. older population stayed home haven’t yet overwhelmed hospitals. Hopefully stay way. worry flu re-opening EcOnOmY important. /s depressingly stupid. huge. people LA county alone 41 individual states. CA itself, TX, FL, NY, PA, IL, OH, GA, NC larger. Spoken like true New Yorker! might accurate say figured work New York City, I'd suspect New York all. :) Yeah, matter (and least states we're basically nothing) disease going long, long tail. guess point that, far, there's evidence asymptomatic cases experiencing lung scarring, minor inflammation similar person might experience common cold allergies. ITT: Americans pointing finger China (*checks notes*) 256 cases month, America 35,000 new cases per day. I'm favor swedish experiment.


But disingenuous look early fatality rates. idea herd immunity deaths front-loaded beginning. GA 😤 Gov. Kemp opening entire state zero limitations July 1st despite increasing numbers!! AbsoFUCKINGlutely ridiculous became politics ‘stay Trump’s speed dial’ omg 65% Americans 2,500 people think highlight small sample survey size , highly doubt majority taken larger sample size feel way LA County resident here, wife works ICU. Unfortunately excuse this. locked early made huge inroads toward flattening curve. course shining example shutting would improve infection death rates.

But squandered re-opening early. makes fucking sick. Wait evictions people got screwed forbearance scams kick in. bankruptcies. warming domino table. pragmatism.

*""most us racist fucks, let's require anyone already think good wear mask increase County, Oregon, requires residents wear face coverings public settings, indoors outdoors. overwhelmingly White county ***will require non-White residents wear fear harassment,*** [the county said  one first counties US exempt people ***color wearing masks prevent racial profiling.***  County, home nearly 50,000 residents, almost ***90% White less 1% Black***, [census shows. also home Siletz Reservation growing population Latino residents. clearly right eat restaurant. Deny service. really. way saving jobs keeping employers pushing employees states. means it’s success. month, businesses received amounts requested there’s another $130 billion left funding.

Numerous European countries something similar.  article linked shows May 2019 18% families make rent payments time. talking 2% increase normal times, people paying late, many end paying rent get evicted all. 

We've yet see predicted wave evictions materialize, think largely stimulus checks unemployment benefits increases, well jobs coming back economy reopening. long ensure money put hands tenants completely avoidable need resort long-term moratoriums evictions. complicated, bring back many jobs safely interim, jobs really cannot exist pandemic ends extend UI. Great insight, thanks that.  Right, he's telling us stay home go need. Problem people Texas think need lot things wants. Thanks that. Don’t tread guy here. Sitting doctors office getting tested covid.
