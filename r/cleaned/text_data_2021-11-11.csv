0,2021-11-11,"   person got two shots pizifer without government incentives so. get like one time protect people refuse protect themselves?

What's truly stupid situation Biden's administration waiting jan 4th make vaccination mandates work places 100 people. even delayed state lawsuits belive 19 now. still going far late. MSM /redditors : Zero Covid Policy impossible draconian. 

Also MSM /redditors Surprised Picachu face :  politicians end pandemic (not us) side effects definitely worse Pfizer series (which cakewalk), think would easier time recognized getting migraine treated such. side effects sore arm, general soreness, malaise, tiredness. feeling better 20 hours shot. Exactly! Thank saying trying convey! like taste smell. I'm getting COVID. I've made far - ain't it.

The thing is, may it. double vaccinated (boosted now) dinner couple friends mine like two months ago, gotten sick (thankfully also vaccinated mild illness) gotten tested told get tested close contact, would've never known I'd (tested positive twice, day told week later, quarantined rest 10 days). Never symptoms. 2021, 2001. One 9/11 every 3 days considered new normal, one 9/11 per lifetime. that's Americans become. fair, really determine work high risk high risk situation. went walkin Costco Virginia today literally used ""I work office full people"" high risk excuse, lie, do. partially vaxxed kid young vaxxed kid home, workplace wants inside weather getting colder, almost nobody wearing masks despite requirement (I one few). I'm bringing anything home to.

They really end stuff, good good all, certainly going hurt people get booster. Stop confusion. course not. Hell, used much less legit excuse. thought maybe vaccinated early wearing speak recently vaccinated friends suggest maybe that's it.  break-through cases declining effectiveness vaccine 6-8 months discussed much due fear certain portion population would think vaccines good. busy promoting vaccines anti-vaxxer luxury talk fallibility vaccine (no vaccine 100% effective) discuss practical guidelines minimize infection risk vaccinated people. sad state affairs. Here's one Rationally, getting booster week Thanksgiving makes lot sense. antibody levels super high Thanksgiving rest holiday season. want get sooner put anxiety ease, that's fine too.  son got first shot yesterday. Retired nurse working CVS. friggin wizard calming kids down. like masterclass explain medical treatment children. Basically! good luck that. literally care. talking true antivaxxers tho Yep - look ended approved boosters CDC amounts basically adult wants one. know following closely paying attention broad qualifications are. I've multiple friends wanted boosters know eligible pointed list qualifying conditions. messaging, said, terrible needlessly complex.    really don’t care. check box says eligible like that, eligible.  Looks like need social distance pet turkey unfortunately also killing people, like people can't get vaccine legit medical reasons.  able convince people, still go ""vaccines prevent getting dying"" regardless data says Based people's reports Texas' antibody study I've read, seem like getting antibody boost exposure thing. saw Pfizer recipient report antibodies upper limit test, whole family came COVID. symptoms tested negative several times. antibodies way higher Pfizer recipients long vaccinated.

You could go get antibody test curious. got hybrid immunity, already feeling pretty confident. Tedros, please resign. Also “not airborne” “boosters bad” guy. We're actually starting open everything, including borders. Even Thailand open many countries since rely tourism money income. Countries practically done vaccination efforts, already sending booster shots. got Pfizer booster. time party what? Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida stalled near lowest levels since pandemic began. Meanwhile, California New York stalled high levels, Vermont skyrocketing. south poorly, took blame, yet north, highly vaccinated areas poorly, grouped entire US, everyone boat? Tell sister caught 2 months Moderna double jabbed. severe though Wtf, Netherlands too. anybody explanation this? I’m quarantined got kid vaccinated day approved 5-11 year olds. went vaccination center under-served community (i.e. low income). vax site run recreation center. Inside white families children. Outside rec center run-down neighborhood place parked BMW's Volvo's. 

Believe me, rich rushing get kids vaccinated. feel like persuasion power lower income folks. Misinformation hella drug. Sure. issue live, issue personal safety. I’m huge metro area don’t exactly field hospitals set parking lots. spread misinformation complaining misinformation. 

The majority people get least one systemic side effect mRNA vaccines beyond sore arm. They're typically short-lived far minor complication Covid. Still, studies point people experiencing least one side effect besides sore switch Pfizer booster. get one. people seem lesser side effects Pfizer. Moderna got boosted Moderna. side effects fairly mild booster similar second shot still. Pfizer might make less others mentioned half dose booster seem result people lesser side effects booster, even change much me. got Moderna booster Pfizer, tell everyone stick Pfizer third. exactly regret choice, looking back it, makes sense follow common advice benefit mixing minor boost antibodies. vaccines yet silver bullet, prefer notion trying live without 2 friends 1 colleague mine, vaxxed June August, caught covid separately got pretty damn sick. hospitalization week, still. Scary stuff indeed. Yep! see issue here....Reading comprehension hot pharmacist gave number $100% dollars. everyone clapped. name? Albert Einstein.  quadrupled overnight. developed mild sore throat among post-booster symptoms. based theory mine, seasonal allergies chance? suspect closer hell's waiting room. you’re essentially saying vaccinated exposed virus comparable crashed drunk driver. say don’t think vaccines work. Take mask come anti vaccine conspiracy theorist I'm Toronto likely different experience many US, man glad able go office 2 3 days week pandemic, mechanical engineer. Made huge difference mental health. 3rd dose third nothingburger. sore arm like expect fluid directly injected muscle. state (NJ) dropping cases despite winter, anecdotally, see lot folks starting get boosters. Pathologists would better making bullshit theories seeding online forums would trick people getting vaccine. much lower myocarditis rates COVID-19. Pick poison. suggest less poisonous variety I'm weird way. pretty much expect become endemic point covid may become much less virulent then. boosters may still thing along flu shot. Going comment post history, seem huge grudge guy. you? Moderna booster also Moderna before. side effects pretty much second shot, slightly worse. Nothing bad though. wife also Moderna booster pretty similar second shot. totally agree. Especially holidays coming taking two weeks fully effective. I’d like avoid another holiday surge. - part headline. also wildly inaccurate headline they've decided none.  may gotten full dose too. pharmacy gave booster accidentally gave full dose supposed half.  Walking Spread  unvaccinated chance protection turned nose it. 

It’s job guardian angel stupid.

The virus absolutely endemic, waves infections always here. trust science that’s that. variant hits, won’t vaccinated CDC bit vague, ""18 years older work live high-risk settings may receive booster shot least 6 months completing primary series"" ""People ages 18–64 years increased risk COVID-19 exposure transmission occupational institutional setting may get booster shot based individual risks benefits""

I would say kid goes day care, live high risk setting based individual risk. probably then. Uggh. hope recovery quick. I'm hen picking argument? said EVERYONE said 89% said everyone get again. 89% everyone....

Also trust vaccine too, got it. Howevrr 40% country didn't. vaccinated people need still wear masks protect 40%. 

Not care much lives ( sure dont) they're ones keeping covid infection rates high. infection rates high turn leads break cases vaccinated people. PEOPLE NEED BOOSTER! Masks side save lives. End story. No....but thought might go second. head felt like baking fever 103.7....if would hit 104 would gone, understanding 104 danger zone adults. Apparently 2% people moderna really high fever. Thankfully mine last long. care. People get dismissive mental illness suffer simultaneously using advantage, love here. uninformed one. Holy fuck that's unfortunate. pretty much safety unknowns though. 7 BILLION doses administered.

It's safe. That's decided point now. acting like disputed? Comments like removed misinformation.  same, give booster though found out, full third dose moderna. hope manage right doses kids.  Ah thanks, yeah thinking full dose bit excessive! Pfizer booster feeling extra crap (generally feel bit rubbish time due ME/CFS sometimes hard tell cause). Easing luckily, hope passed too.  We'll keep getting people care. 

I've seen personal life, people taking risks never would year ago. 

The fatigue real, anti-mandate population foundation going stay way. Northeast Ohio. religious wearing masks public. shows right virus awful. said local news SoCal people get are:

\-65 older

\-18 older health issues

\-18 older work high risk area get titers drawn clinic next physical tell exactly, got boosters, probably. head coronavirusillinois see twisted arguments people making complaint mask mandate. Saying masks nothing, cases low (they’re low anymore, they’ve rising like 2 weeks) therefore it’s time take away masks. Saying outbreaks don’t occur schools (where masks mandates) therefore don’t need mandates schools. It’s insane. Staffing resources. That's nice way saying stupid God damn California adults received original COVID-19 shots six months ago think would benefit booster get one, California’s top health official Dr. Mark Ghaly said Wednesday.

If got six months ago. always. Moderna first two times. could barely move really high fever second shot, last long (maybe 6 hrs). 

Just got Moderna booster yesterday omg.... 24 hrs fever myalgia still pretty bad. expect booster, I'd to. Maybe countries unconstitutional put needs adult population ahead needs children.

What basically means, give vaccines kids brings direct benefits disadvantages. such, cannot justify giving vaccines kids order lower infection rate protect old vulnerable population. Effectively, look wellbeing children taking decisions them.

This effective policy countries UK, Norway, Portugal, etc... suspect US may case, situation justified vaccinate kids order reduce overall transmission.

Of course, principle takes consideration healthy kid, covid poses almost threat, myocarditis might bigger problem. sure yet, position take risk. I’m US told Moderna booster half dose. Still hit hard, like shot 2. Show burden proof, Everyone expert opinion really blind faith. friend chooses vaccinated fine. gamble health safety rather take something many unknowns. Enjoy freedom dr said get take first shots, might ask get 6 wk check right can. Either way hope get end January. someone done many thousands times, agree. Man (still is?) damn frustrating. First came GMOs, PCR itself!!!! Aghhhh. listed examples, it’s pretty much medical setting work around groups people. example people don’t qualify based work people work home 100% time. It’s vague everything between. 

You also qualify medical reasons. list comorbidities covid pretty long. Obesity example. Even mental health issues like depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc apply. located? daughter sick University Texas Austin waiting results COVID test. fully vax’d Texas done mitigation (sadly). someone please Iowa 😭 Hold up... miffed neither family member got covid.

What's story here?   large number people need boosters coming weeks reach 6 months past second vaccine . get STIKO recommending people 70 doctors really really follow recommendation . mother example 69 coming 6 months family doctor refuses give booster 5 months older . even take concideration vaccination center closed people go doctors . end mother planning get second ""first vaccination"" pretending unvaccinated way reasonably hope get booster . would get one solely said ""dining indoors"". Damn, I’m CA schedule booster week ago! Tomorrow able walk booster toothpaste wouldn’t able street. US American living Germany.

US media praising Germany's response - specifically Merkel's leadership 2020 - compared Trump, spent months denying pandemic even thing, saying going disappear ""like miracle,"" complaining much testing done numbers making look bad, suggesting bleach could possibly injected inside body treatment, etc. - Merkel, example, calmly explain mathematical concepts exponential growth r-value reporters.

I would also personally add lack existing social programs pandemic (no Kurzarbeit, universal healthcare, even unpaid sick leave) US devastating poor remained middle class compared Germany, media really give shit that. bet farts fun Trying persuade someone via talking values someone share never works well, anywhere.

LOL - good god full shite. need wean OAN, 6 months 2nd shot.  I’ve never anosmia (loss smell), parosmia (distorted sense smell) respiratory infection wasn’t COVID back 2018. Thankfully lasted couple days sucked big time. Everything tasted metallic awful. feel really bad suffering long term parosmia due COVID. creeping up, slowly. think county reach half without vaccine mandate, even many unemployed people assistance here. affected mandate. Experiencing since last night! Thanks. 7 days maximum strength? think I’ve read that. planning getting shot today, forgot health department closed Veterans Day. Going plan Monday since take son soccer game Saturday don’t want feel crummy enjoy it.   Profitable?

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* shitty thing he's done decade  I'm Ohio Pfizer CVS March/April. think get mine whenever then?  medication enough treat many cases

The could said chemotherapy, no? record reddit substitute medical advice. said, certainly meet criteria states setting booster. I'm sick politicians. madate bloddy vaccine stop courting minority idiots holding rest country hostage .  _Detective_ Love donated! Thank you! Hey guys need opinions. 

I'm senior college student rigorous STEM university. much ""fall behind screwed"" atmosphere. also rigorous COVID testing program. get tested twice week, wear masks buildings, etc. Due this, schools covid numbers low (averaging 2 cases per day) we've lucky enough relatively normal school year, masks capacity limits. But, test positive covid, required isolate 10 days allowed come classes campus reason (zoom lectures). Thanksgiving third last week semester, two major projects finish finals prepare happening right it. 

My Aunt lives hour away family. Due COVID last year, unable come see us Thanksgiving Christmas, sucked. Luckily, able meet Summer again. 

Moving forward now, going vacation Aruba getting home 2 days Thanksgiving. God forbid gets COVID trip, enough time symptoms develop get covid test realize needs isolate. means could pass brother I, entire family. brother college well situation me. asked comfortable seeing them, honestly said brother much lose regards finishing classes online. 

Due this, mother recommended come home Thanksgiving. Understandably, upset keep family apart Holidays two straight years. brother stand firm wanting chance bringing COVID back her. AITA feeling way? .1% terrifying dealing large numbers like human populations. Currently everyone 18 older works (has occupation) high risk area. here, got Moderna booster last week mild reaction second dose. mild fatigue next day back normal. idea getting downvoted saying

1.  something may true 

2. would personally compliant reasons health social well-being. southwest Florida spiked pretty high summer. really bad. It’s calmed lot (down 2% hospital). 

Just waiting next wave tbh. People get complacent. I'm really amazed amount people US really dumb. fact people influenced politics basic common sense crazy me. 

First masks, people using 100 years Spanish flu hit. basically affect life substantial way.

Now vaccines, proven work. understand hesitanty putting something body pretty new. Yet people put drugs never tested covid. Makes sense me. Lockdowns go! Yes 3rd moderna shot bad like 2nd. Feel like lost48+ hours. Oh well! Worth ya i'm booster. part double jab, worth risk point. 

Join gym eat healthy people Mayo Clinic says rest medication enough treat many cases. ain’t definition “mild,” guess it’s mild. 

Anyway, made choice long time ago. Got double moderna, side effects. take boosters become available I’m at.  wave now? truly lost count. They've 97,203 deaths. would equivalent 384,771 deaths America. expecting, half America's 759K deaths. 

Anyways, sure means. thought better avoid covid spikes like we're seeing now, better happen majority population vaccinated. We've 2 fully vaxxed ICU young. immunocompromised. way. Hope texas soon, unlikely LOL

my parents got 3rd, want one people incapable reflecting civic duty. 5 million dead around world changed minds; nothing will. can't put tutu pig expect ballerina. Weird they're giving oral polio then. thanks participating! Party on, Wayne! lack vaccines toddler.  Yeah I’ve quite regretted getting vaccinated. don’t know people get downvoted this.

We need less ignorant people world. far many, that’s pandemic continues exist. Honestly, we’re getting murdered Colorado, red parts. supposedly high vaccination rate well. Clearly we’re behaving though vaccines effective are.  Colorado packed COVID patients regular accidents, illnesses, etc continue happen wait hours before.   Yes 100%! Yeah, either makes sense, true everywhere.  believe bones. realize persistent health affects possible, aside death, even mild COVID-19 infection, right?

Yeah. they're tiny risks vaccinated healthy. state extraneous health issues get would cautious. think myocarditis, whether caused Covid vaccine, something considered ""mild."" didn’t lie lmao. institutional setting high risk. wasn’t asked anyway, literally asked get one said yes. lying verification information required. Got link name? read post question, you? I'm double vaxxed simply ignoring statement made makes look like science denier. get complications vaccines; sure, scale compared covid definitely still there, times serious Delta surprised scientists much worse original version suggest could happen. Go get it, 180 days out. Restaurants open long now, proximity made flare way back up. Cases spike I'm sure bit holidays, see hospitalizations rapidly increasing.   vodka night get me. drink bar high school buddies night whole year. abuse exceptionally high number pro-COVID anti-vaxxers could easily avoid illness death wanted to. It’s hard rational people understand. comment ever, wanted say someday likely going variant, motherload all, going kill lot unvaccinated people. teach “rugged individualism all” decades, it’s really hard undo crisis requires societal focus. 

This problems like global warming danger societies people focused themselves. can’t see consequences lives, don’t care.  Taiwan covid within community, sit vaccines data becomes available without risk... Sadly shown impoverished many problems consider life. Covid somewhat low risk compared drive by, sibling getting sexually assaulted, abusive family member, alcoholics sitting curb, homeless sleeping alley, crack houses street, break ins police response, scraping little debt limit medical access. 

Can really blame front center them? issue lying get booster. free so, consequences, call spade spade. Taiwan 100% interested committed vaccinate everyone, including 12... thing really virus community though, also privilege sitting data becomes available. Ding easily excited alarmist.  Best ignore him. look happening Europe right now. Unfortunately, covidiots source 5th wave US soon. Thanks guys! authorized high risk without giving exhaustive list. interpret high risk, one stops even questions me, fail see issue One mild side-effect treated Tylenol. comes case Covid. Reminds child father point old TB hospital.  question. got Moderna vaccine back Feb March. 30 serious side effects two shots. 

Can go ahead get booster? I’m confused differing opinions this. call Dr Monday thought would run y’all first protection symptomatic infection. vaccines diseases don’t protect symptoms - help survive. J&amp;J still reasonable additional protection hospitalization death - but, much lower shortly vaccination. booster you’ll fine again, get one those. got moderna booster soon could, 2 weeks Thanks sharing. double vaxxed boosted still worry lot it’s hard know what’s actually happening vaccinated people. What's difference two? Well UK recently experiencing another surge despite high vax numbers, however, number deaths reduced tenfold, compared previous waves. proofs *even though cases rise vaccines protect infection, vaccine protect severe illness.*

These waves come go forecoming years, people vaxxed number deaths reduce. UK might already reached peak current wave could end New-Year's eve. UK also decided take another route, pills, cut severe symptoms.

The thing EVERYONE get dose, whether Astrazeneca, Janssen, Pfizer, Sputnik, Cansino, Patria, Soberana, Covaxin, whatever vaccine, otherwise linger longer due mutations nasty variants.

They replace Tedros Scott Gotlieb, least makes vaccine speech accessible towards antivaxxers able comunicate them. need read repeatedly. helps know others going thing me. feel like tyrant hating people right level stupidity driving nuts. felt rage since threw temper tantrums child.   far 65%, somewhere around 50, that's one reason. nobody going control that. bet still Christmas shopping like lockdown. Messiah arrived yet ? B-b-but vaccines Communism! get day. got flu shot, offered Pfizer booster (I want Moderna). still need license insurance go get vax. Anti-vaxxers probably possess ability self reflection begin with. inactivated virus-based COVID-19 vaccine developed Bharat COVID vaccine causes 5g sucka
/s ""Vaccinated"" includes fully vaccinated received single [of two million Alabamians fully vaccinated COVID-19, 1.8% contracted 

So breakdown cases 88% unvaccinated, 10% partially vaccinated, less 2% fully vaccinated.

It's probably safe assume vast majority vaccinated deaths among partially vaccinated. ^this smart people there. Good hear. stationary recovery institution three weeks moment. 120 people, unvacced needed PCR Test arrival. Vacced not. Unvacced need test twice week. Vacced not. everyone allowed leave Building time. Thats call BS. thanksgiving Xmas. Christmas new years hit hard countries big waves highly vaccinated? countries highly vaccinated due combination anti-vaxxers children eligible yet. Father law took covaxin first came out, double jabbed, got infected, even realise got infected (no symptoms) found COVID positive took PCR test travel thankfully time infection almost subsided certain values ""logic"", ""rights"" ""same"" sure Yeah Tedros says children no, keeps bitching every week donate Africa instead, even Africa bad situation comparison rest world.

COVAX sucks delivering vaccines. simply slow. promotes spread.

The virulent coronavirus MERS, kills 36% infects, rarely hear r0 well 1 due fast kills hosts.

evolution favors spread. Killing hosts generally limits spread favored. Az skyrocketing. masks low vaccination rate.  Sometimes cells already immune systems fight covid antibodies AZ exploding yet none cares one bit Didnt know Germans Covid would fly Colorado treatment. numbers date due German RKI. want discuss least Stick topic. every child healthy. Kids high risk covid complications getting screwed over, especially since adult vaccinations started adults decided say ""fuck precautions"" children eligible vaccine. one hardly wears mask AZ crappy vaccinated rate. snowbirds droves crowding restaurants..

It's insane Bruh... Holy shit isn’t 9/11 worth deaths every 3 days? 

That’s horrendous.  There's nothing wrong selling them. China sold US given away most. They're things proud of. 2G context means access people vaccinated recovered (Geimpft oder Genesen), 3G access people vaccinated, recovered tested negative (Geimpft, Genesen oder Getestet). Honestly want scared Paxlovid Molnupiravir taking Ivermectin instead. ThEYrE eXPerImEnTAL!!  Fuck everything this. Ridiculous. less 40% wear masks.... determines safe. least US feel like give people licenses them. People act like road everyone else moving way. driving drunk, driving sleepy, speeding, going red lights. Driving honestly hazard. chances surviving commute work guaranteed. sad. Ugh, sucks! least there's improvement 3-4 month mark now. give hope keep improving. Screw disease! Yep, also means whatever minks killed.

Poor critters 😞🙏⚰️ experience parosmia due sinus infection. Everything tasted either awful disappointing. Even saliva mouth tasted bad. sucks, yeah, definitely see could impact quality life. Yep officially tested positive March 6 lost smell taste day. completely smell-less 3 4 months, stuff tastes awful part. rough 7 days I've read (I've also seen 6, maybe they're rounding week). 

Good luck booster! I'm sure feel lot better get it. Ok, offer? expect people part follow restrictions forever? 

The ones living normally unvaxxed people, whether choice can't. Antivaxxers ostracized change mindset. It’s “idiotic”. think study booster dose reduced reasons. earlier days pandemic, kept reading CO seemed together well...mask mandates everything. happened? 8 months sense smell/taste still affected?? stop showing iq propaganda 

I’m mental health doctor 😪

American donation number &lt;1/11 China donation &lt;aMeRIcAn “cLiAmed” donation number &lt;1/50 China’s sell number 

Pathetic American moron 🤣🤣can’t even read 1st language….  Sad feel job forces irresponsible. Hope work anyone getting chemo organ transplant. Malaria kills million annually Africa, endemic. Season 3? I'm jonesing.  TLDR: Russia finds difficult bribe Covid-19 Virus  Everyone's body different though, maintain high levels immunity 8 months...and don't. I'm going get booster soon regardless.  8 months right :/ Hope keeps getting better. you’re able I’d curious know 24 hrs now.  Sure eventually end, problem go route take three four years dies off. antivaxxers part took jab, maybe end pandemic would much closer matter months would better controlled.

The best boycott antivax celebs destroy careers putting people risk. Destroy egos.

If antivaxxer friends family members, try convince give jab chance, things work end best thing severe ties them

If business takes antivaxx stances, boycott it.

It's dragging further. patience people worn off. empathy towards them. ...just read last paragraph lol  be. Pretty sure read somewhere best mix booster. went Moderna x2 Pfizer booster. Felt like crap 2 days lol Get third doses risk least 10x lower. Nobody homework. might due larger mcg dose Moderna compared Pfizer.

pretty sure is, that's major difference two.    way  Sinovac moral objection due conflict interest?

^joke   No, that's John Cena. Teddy can't shit pressure China giving ""raw data"", whatever means, origins pandemic. going happen, unless citizens overthrew Winnie bloody loyal Party even live abroad. Sure, they'll still need test it. Like, never came Delta variant specific booster. Dang, disappointing follow science... Thanks. Yes, cesspit, I'm trying like hell. people don’t reapply sunscreen, even bother use first place. habitually suffer sunburns. Morons. would less virulent ever? shit happening Russia looks like extinction event 👀 covid 8/20, Pfizer shots &amp; booster couple weeks ago. plan part statistics. dont get seriously ill. Driving kid school way dangerous Covid. called vacuum cleaner ""Tedros"" sucking since January 2020.

Seriously Tedros needs step good. clear can't job. hospitalization rate like 70% unvaxxed/30% vaxxed now? wanna get booster got flu shot  Also ""children priority"" guy also Moderna breakthrough. I’m 2 1/2 months minimal taste back. tell it’s “hot” salty. peach habanero drink that, pre-Covid, LOVED. taste “hotness” it’s gross. can’t really smell anything still.  obviously insane! lying  Pick poison understanding still protected severe disease. 6 months odds catching mild case increases. took booster healthy 23 yo don’t wanna inconvenienced quarantine. took flu shot first time like 10 years reason Croatia it’s 70%. I'm frustrated officially open booster everyone. knew going winter delta variant, knew waning immunity would lead transmission, also knew boosters would slow transmission. say, do. Shocker, real shocker.

Is word COVID even necessary sentence? Perhaps ""highest"" relative COVID vaccines?

Most diseases routinely vaccinate against... mandate schools achieve vaccination rates among entire population 90%.

In Vermont entire population vaccinated past 72% yet.

Oh like MMR, Polio, Tdap, etc., would exactly shocking COVID vaccines really 3+ dose vaccine; meanwhile people gotten 3. didn't.I got day eligible.
We got booster 2 weeks ago.we already vaccinated almost 7 months. Wait, made everyone pay tests, even vaccinated? would definitely discourage many test, matter vaccinated GoodRX coupons available different vaccines well. looked MMR vaccine coupons good $15 off, hey- something! Water wet trolling, would realistic ramp masking? finally get people boosted.... holding booster clinic mother's senior home now. many weeks approval?

But boosters roll out, great divide vaxxed unvaxxed starker ever. Come January hospitals full, barring effective rollout rapid testing combined oral antivirals. see come time, hope I'm wrong. Yes, people vaxxed here. Even people vaxxed many countries surging now. 

Booster data given faith successful booster campaign stop outbreaks happening -- challenging US achieve though. 

Getting rid masks preceded lot countries' current wave... Better covid. people mad two pandemic Thanksgivings row they’ll blame people trying stop pandemic. they’ll go infect families anyway. No. Kids get vaccinated now, let live normal life. you’re asking wear masks pandemic truly you’re saying least another couple years minimum. Fox CNN sides coin. Fox basically 100% propaganda point would still fairly informed CNN sole news source. best follow AP News. neutral find. shit, sane people terrified catching morons around us. almost everyone around already vaccinated, on-edge times. Link study heck, Tedros around? Gtfo. people trusted network local television news, NPR, CNN MSNBC, 11% 16% said believed four untrue statements, sure Fox News viewers, 36% either believed unsure four false statements, Kaiser said. 46% Newsmax viewers 37% said trusted One America Network News.

So they're saying sure information true believing facts? make sense.  NH here, getting booster next Friday, supplied work ( hospital) beginning week hated Gene Simmons loved Aaron Rodgers. quickly tables turn. anyone save comment Nazi party got rid vaccine mandates knew white Germans would still get vaccine, ""undesirables"" (as much)?

PM fine. Symptomatic... difference much lower rate hospitalization death.  unvaccinated people individualists care helping society, love living book weeks advance? Many places still check QR code properly here, time shut places warning.  Last year revolted form restriction vandalized streets. NL looked lime warzone extremely important note hospitalization rates quite low. Especially compared states similar case rates much lower vaccination rates. Utah example.   even still news?  ""Majority""...you mean like 51%...... people USA vaxxed, kids getting vaxxed next school year probably mandates many states kids COVID vaccine. pandemic pretty much here.

&amp;#x200B;

one kids said school looking get rid masks soon they'll sorts mental gymnastics prove trash worldview correct. Even point killing them. First, Pfizer anti-viral 90% effective.

Second, boosters needed primarily prevent infection; primary series still great hospitalization death. 

Third, boosters masks. allow us live exactly days/year. Masks major change lives.

Fourth, yes: people get reinfected, much lower rate. Study: ocean wetter desert.  Unfortunately vaccine short period protection needing another shot, surprise all. wondering health officials around country react now. Sure keep pushing everyone get vaccinated even help considering one needs keep getting ""booster"" every 6 months. Meanwhile, worldwide pandemics lining turn. idiots dooming us. astonishing, hard imagine breaking news, century long exhaustive study costing billions finally concluded 99.9% humans breathe benefits oxygen. Startling story follow…. Personally, stuck Moderna booster bc it’s 50 mcg instead 30 mcg Pfizer.  Gottlieb also put long thread said feel record cases, like Europe Germany specifically, happen US, using Germany prime example:

. Germany's testing numbers high US UK. easy identify cases, isolate treat infected cases, contact trace.

. UK 90% people form immunity. US 85%. Germany's much lower.

. Germany's Delta wave happened much later nations, wave start August, recent surge sudden recent colder weather bringing inside. said, Rt spread rate going slowly last 2-3 weeks.

. record cases happen US, regions would need once. South already Delta Wave, plains mountain states starting recede wave, time Great Lakes North wave. 

. Gottlieb finishes telling people panic. Kids getting vaccinated now, booster shots given often, within months, therapeutics, oral pills, antibodies deal symptoms widely available. live long time. BUT, endemic stage coming. People begging “rip like bandaid” method dealing virus since day 1. day hospitals areas restrictions reduced become overrrun people need critical ICU help. 

We’re even one full year since first vaccinations started happening. We’re conditioned society impatient nowadays.

Opening becomes norm reduction restrictions lead immediate surge ICU cases. 

Also, I’d like see vaccine eligibility reduced include younger kids. shit, Sherlock... Israeli Palestinian conflict religion war. Yes, certainly feels way. hatred grows day. never stopped masking indoor public spaces. gonna fuck around find hospitals still overloaded holidays still coming. know kinda weird getin news porn. Congratulations, guess? likely pretty small minority. 

What state* curiosity? can't read today.  would beg. take care family Sure, 31% vaccination rate makes sense. poor country Europe, guess makes sense access vaccine... Wait... Alabamians, Albanians?! excuse get vaccinated still vaccination rate less Brazil....  made choice suffering consequences actions.  Unless medicine covid, end.

Studies showed people would get inflected even Covid once. Booster booster wearing masks, stop it, cases would go up. breaking news, water found wet. Same, got booster weeks ago. embarrassing one county state double dose vaccination rate 70% places fucking Leelanau. totally fine position—and would also like continue masking *limited circumstances*, describe—but absolutely people (through elected officials) whether mandates. 

It decision made unelected health boards, fine beginning pandemic, fast agile, less acceptable changes start become permanent.   Ya don’t say! unless want forever

I'm pretty happy mask wearing become acceptable West. hope mask wearing least continues high-density public transit like subways whatnot, e.g. flu common cold. Rock roll night vax every day.  issue reasoning unvaccinated people going getting vaccinated large numbers.

So need mask years years still end without enough immunity.

I don’t think rest us owe unvaccinated people changes behavior, easy way keep (and others) safe vaccination. It’s philosophical/political question, scientific one.

I sorry. number people see using obvious Faux News Facebook meme talking points damn high. know new development (some memories youth Iraq War climb make doubtful). However, misuse propaganda crisis obvious precisely self-destructive. 

It frustrating living idiocracy. know must done, status quo clearly working. Good luck good job keeping family safe. confirmation bias juggernaut rolls along. Well Southern Hemisphere light per day time year. Finally got around getting third pfizer shot couple days ago. dose definitely packed wallop first two. notice anything first shot, little pain injection site shot two, shot gave small fever, headache, felt like crap day. also able sleep last night, I'm sure side effect usual insomnia. 

I'm glad protected point. Hope booster shots pushed everyone soon. think everyone basically qualifies, make second guess since check box signifying work go school around bunch people. Seems dumb since everyone inevitably goes around lot people throughout week shopping whatever. science works - miracle. Bear mind people normally wake morning decide overweight.   work done eliminate side effects shot? people know got sick shot pretty bad. cousin mine bed 5-6 days. feet two days myself. fun experience think deters people getting shot especially idiots downplaying covid making shot seem like worse alternative. regardless vaccination status community transmission levels

That's part gets me. highly-vaccinated communities transmission levels low time start removing mandates. Granted, right small number US counties, think removing masks priority areas safe.  Vaccines play huge role fronts too, help lower cases personal risk math includes likely outcome get vaccinated way less severe. It’s vaccine kid isn’t end per se, would massive shift risk considerations. People choose unvaccinated making choice health nobody elses. Vaccinated people still get Covid pass others. ways likely pass on, since tend wear masks anymore. Experts saying expect everyone eventually get Covid pandemic become endemic. vaccinated, safe. not, that's choice. ""Case rates Vermont residents fully vaccinated nearly four times higher fully vaccinated residents, according state data. ... 
Statewide, driving surge include people 20s, least vaccinated among Vermont adults, well children ages 5 11, eligible get vaccinated, Dr. Mark Levine, Vermont's health commissioner, said Tuesday."" 

Seems like something like 1 4 people unvaccinated Vermont, seems vaccinated people still make something like 40-45% cases. Still, unvaccinated people still slight majority cases despite minority. Get vaccinated, verify vaccination card Fox, get special vaccine ID, get tested every day. *EVERY DAY* Specifieke zorg vereist training en studie, dat kost tijd en net als de IC probleem niet zo eenvoudig op te lossen. Well said, sure getting downvoted heavily. topic pollution recycling good example power huge corporations like Nestle. Nestle powerhouse contributing plastics environmental crisis plastic pollution. held accountable? They're not. run infomercials campaigns promote recycling. say us, consumer, save planet....

...and yet Nestle one producing plastic first place. Billions plastic bottles containers made harmful plastics. burden change placed consumer.  seem irrational bizarre, take step back think moment longer. actual power positive change, instead place responsibility know resolve enact change. US also political structure gives group disproportionate representation federal level.  agree, issue *right now* enough immunity. virus still behaving like epidemic, endemic disease.

Masking basically temporary measure keep people alive *until* get endemic state immunity. 12% still better nothing, Janssen receivers receive booster soon (yes late) 'In October 2021, 16% Dutch population aged 18 years vaccinated COVID-19, yet fully vaccinated. half (56%) COVID-19 patients hospital month vaccinated fully vaccinated'

56% VAST majority? sweetheart realization realized he'd working home long working nursing home. Sounds like went together getting together. Oops. Yh hard compare cases say last March covid started. Although countries ramp testing winter like November/December last year? might still able compare cases last winter. news, water wet.  name china, Chile, UAE Cuba right head vaccinate *en masse* 12 crowd. US definitely alone neither be. Ask primary care doctor Janssens vaccine protects 12% 6 months. certain point ""anti-vaxxers probably better immunity sick past already covid. late this. Cases exploding, need act work mandatory vaccination program. Reddit /s added show sarcasm. Free healthcare right everyone, even antivaxx idiots. slippery slope exclude life decisions diseases emergencies considered caused person themself. Maybe riding skateboard want break arm? Maybe excersiced often/avoided alcohol/eaten healthier/etc etc etc. Belgium recent stat sciensano papers (they retracted paper put new one) +65 years -15% chance helped vaccine. 


the explanation reduction protection + social contact among unvaccinated. 4% vaccinated already natural immunity delta. work, BC can't control unvaccinated, rest society open. lockdown unvaxxed enforceable.

Even can't go bars, restaurants, clubs gather home places owners antivax one even notice, cases go rampant.

At point sufficient anymore, sadly general lockdown gain back control. general lockdown obvious somebody breaks rules, makes enforceable. need booster vaccine loosing lot strength 6 months. (especially janssens vaccine). gives 12% protection get virus. (luckely bit better get sick). 


But booster way keep majority safe. anti-vaxxers probably get natural immunity (with risks involved). concept giving priority make sense supply shortage. point pretty much splitting hairs. Go get booster guilt free. No, deaths ages ranges they’ve already children. amazing people look chaos Eastern European countries (that low vaccination rates) think vaccinated individuals blame. like people simply refuse acknowledge data points unvaccinated individuals much higher change infected, transmitting COVID, hospitalized dying.  thought Sputnik vaccine effective widely accepted Russia. wrong? Vaccination certificate ID far know: Restaurants, Bars indoor venues... out. higher rate. listen Israel data sudden now?  You’re right, much effective originally expected. doesn’t much cases still tens millions unvaccinated US billions unvaccinated worldwide.  Well, Alabama all. expect? Paywalled: Everybody vaccinated free mostly instand believe. 

Kids 12+ vaccinated. completely missed target there.

Rugged individualism caring mean can't care environment. two mutually exclusive. focus fight global warming/climate change prevent depletion natural resources natural habitats. Many ""rugged individualists"" mentioned fact spend lot time nature appreciate good them.

From US point view, statistic majority us (almost 70% growing) agree climate change problem government needs protect environment reduce effects climate change.

So what's problem? There's much individual do. reduce, reuse, recycle. petition local leaders, things much power huge corporations billions dollars pocket lobby (read: bribe) order continue polluting, deforesting, irresponsibly dumping waste environment. 

Until government changes truly responds people deepest pockets gonna see meaningful change holds true regardless whether country individualistic not. Look China, communist country even young, college age students hyper patriotic. seem helped pollution index much. might get 88% 12 fully vaccinated. short making mandatory see go much higher. Nobody seems able get everyone next? all-cause risk goes way hospitals overwhelmed. easily happen virus even looks good right now. Remember handful cases US? suddenly tens thousands? millions? thrice vaccinated good. Others getting vaccinated helps too. nailed it. 

The 3G rules implemented poorly everywhere many places nobody cared. vaccinated people decided free whatever want media failed educate (or could figure problem).

Perhaps COVID lesson next step evolution far clearly acting stupid society. seen almost everywhere people feel free choose actions. indicate boosters needed. That's high. One argument miss discussion unvaccinated people likely catch virus first place thus spread others. Even waning efficacy time, huge benefit stay vaccinated. need get vaccination numbers up! Plenty large metros close capacity Aug/Sep. doesn’t take much virus estimated R0 6+ quickly overwhelm hospitals. nowhere near number vaccinated + recovered rest laurels yet. vaccine stacks? Give time I’ll become immortal. much Canada, unless table restuarant. southern border little nothing spread deaths we’re seeing. It’s local transmission. Idk hell talking intruding convo, go lol yourself. corrected. stated confirmed # primary source COVID data. trying cause drama none?  15% unvaccinated make majority (70%+) hospitalisations. reason hospitals overflowing. There's rational reason vaccinated live perpetual lockdown. way solve either get everyone vaccinated make sure unvaccinated isolate society.

Around 22h started get really hot shivering. 5AM, got slight headache still hot, really difficulty sleeping. slight inflammation throat didnt eat much last days got lot acid reflux totally that. Could also explain headache hot/shiver. 


What possibility caught something waiting line yesterday? Either cold flu? Could manifest fast? side effect flu vaccine? information, didnt got week third covid booster, doubt caught something week. 


I asked go hometown later today meet friends, maybe ? heard flu vaccine symptoms last days not. got pretty sick. Thankfully mine regular shitty manageable side effects. sleeping woke heart attack like symptoms (chest pain, back pain, etc), ended going ER. Yeah someone heart condition, may still opt pfizer booster bit safer. Vax brainer. choice, think fair go pfizer. Things feel normal got rid restrictions control.

Every UK scientific medical body calling restrictions put back. Less words, actions.

Smokers pay higher insurance premiums. controlled areas. saw pictures 11/11 Köln... course eliminating contact method number one stopping viral transmission. described however really people behave absence widespread lockdown measures. problem got lot people can't seem wrap head around changing risk levels. Folks sitting around shots system staring red maps CDC website stomach flips they're much danger 2020 pre-vaccine. 

The media needs hammer home two tiered reality live in. Stop spewing total case counts total death counts we're boat. need stop pretending are. unvaccinated ones clogging hospitals straining healthcare system. live Australia 92% 12 vaccination rate (first dose), second dose bit behind lot. Nearly 90% ICU beds taken unvaccinated.

That’s big majority taken absolute small minority. actually, conditions must met. Yeah strange personal responsibility folks taking advise. Yes, main hospitals treating covid-19 patients public hospitals. Owned operated government. shareholders owning hospitals make profits. problem climate change public health crisis, etc. consequences often shared across entire population. different situations, people absorb larger share consequences. maybe health, living situation, wrong place wrong time.

That makes easier someone currently absorbing large portion consequences blow off.  CDC meeting discussed several experts objected idea extending broadly. One even said “we might well give everyone.” clear believe net beneficial everyone point. would said OK 59 year old working homeless shelter 22 year old working office. 

If question “give everyone” seems likely vote would failed would close. still failed close enough margin director overturn. 

The data looked good since guess vote give adults would probably pass today. Yes can, financial products covering healthcare hospitals. 12% protection infection, symptomatic illness, hospitalisation, death? rerun? feel like I've seen one bunch.

(to clarify: knock OP, realize new article) wits’ end trying save lives people death wish. true hero. problem politicized. beautiful know arguing bad faith. understand stupid asshole. assume walls help blind navigation. friend caught last year STILL cannot smell taste anything. went whole family problem, last knew.

There's precedent.

If decide ruin health refuse free treatment (vaccine) pay expensive one, way would pay decided visit private doctor instead appointed one whatever problem may have.  point is, nobody safe till people world are. Given that, think focus mild cases extremely disproportional. one would care COVID mild cases comprised 99.9% cases, seems case highly vaccinated countries need someone talk to? Agree slippery slope, people breaking arms / obese / getting lung cancer crowd hospitals. Singapore still midst highest ever surge (by mile) going ~2 months, hospitals ICUs badly strained overwhelmed, unvaccinated, like everywhere else, making disproportionate amount people needing serious care. anti-vaxx sabotaging health, also taking away medical resources / attention away others also need (such vaccinated elderly people non-Covid ailments altogether).

Besides, Singapore free healthcare anyway, subsidised. completely free healthcare regards Covid special Covid moment, pandemic all. Requiring patients pay treatment make like disease there, would end-game anyway.

On side note, far slippery slope we're facing pandemic. reflected duty society. They’ve decided none owed special privilege everyone else. 

That rights freely associate trump everyone else’s rights life liberty. Thanks. figured rules would apply basic immunization booster, sure. should, won't. J&amp;J kicked ass circle 12 days dose 1 Moderna. actually thought hives first (since going case chronic hives). went away 48 hours say harmless learn German.

EU countries want provide it, suppose due chance extremely rare side effects; millions American Israeli people fine. I'm much rule follower, guess. I'm 38, wfh underlying conditions.

Covid aside, buying equity hospital what?  share data? seen much information booster efficacy time  anti-vaxx crowd enough brain power reflect, antivaxx Part two-month cycle. Cases started drop September 1, started rise November 1. :( unvaxed also likly follow lock guidence well.  wondering; 

What general stance towards unvaccinated people willingly decided limit cut travel/social moments?

\- Ordering groceries home delivered house 
\- longer going cinema, restaurant etc. 
\- Working office altered ensure social distancing 
\- Keeping social activities absolute minimum. (birthday) parties etc. It’s pretty political too. Even though former President, Senate minority leader, House minority leader, vast majority sitting Congresspeople, Senators judges one particular party vaccinated, it’s turned political issue substantial portion people vote party vaccination. voters dying much higher rate counterparts side aisle.  It’s man made disease… Pharma companies didn’t create lab.  Wish could get one whenever wanted brazil probably 2022 :( That's get redditing watching TV. Fixed numbers. Water wet. 72%. Roughly Germany. 90%. I'm vaccinated. care R0, point care people either. Source? I'm making argument, I'm saying antivaxxers covid deniers would. Even Netherlands nearly 90% still covid escalation. Getting percentage already could reasonably hope still enough... places also using ""1G = Getestet"" (meaning everyone needs tested regardless immunity), ""2G+"" (2G everyone needs tested well).  decrease risk lot.

But elderly still vulnerable, big enough number even small % look big. Sure. you, Hugo? Sadly Americans gotten fatter pandemic instead using motivation make healthier choices. 3G = Geimpft, Genesen, Getested - Vaccinated, Recovered COVID infection (but 6 months after), Tested

2G = Geimpft, Genesen - Vaccinated, Recovered

1G = Geimpft - Vaccinated  Unfortunately, many folks willingly unvaccinated point also likely fans Kennedy too. vaccines thoroughly politicized, ones feel sense social responsibility likely align liberal values, “rugged individualists” see vaccination threat personal rights (as opposed way us protect others, see remaining unvaccinated infringes livelihoods others) likely conservative.

Germany must one best COVID responses world Getting bunch notices replies nearly instantly deleted, even get chance read  We're endgame now...  Media says get booster, hospital says no, way look shots caught covid lived booster shot stop spending 9 days ICU actually help any? Germany amazing healthcare system. also low infection rates. German govt fast lockdowns, strict rules importantly people follow rules better cultures Also Australia. 

Wtf wrong people, get vaccinated already. oversimplifying concept so-called 'zero-COVID policy'.

&amp;#x200B;

'zero-COVID policy' doesnot mean COVID would gonna emilinated forever efforts .it's overcome ongoing pandemic killed millions ppl around world . try best control/contain infections beginning minimize affection area ， means ppl live normal lives within area/country without suffering /restriction COVID.

&amp;#x200B;

""Nobody knows it’ll over"" sounds actually like ""well give would try contain anymore,let's see would "".

And course hard ppl know it'll ppl live country looses tightens Covid control measures like roller coaster situation fully control. dad stroke Aug5 ER rooms full 16 people hallways waiting 4 available hospital beds 30 hours later sent dad home ER told us come back couple days. vaccinating 18s Netherlands? One nice thing covid... covid diet lost almost 40lbs, amazing much weight lose ICU. right take precautions driving reduce risk?

And absolutely can. fun Delta 9 days ICU 3 months vaccinated, recovery took nearly 2 months got booster today health center administered Moderna vaccine shots little six months ago.

Just called asked booster availability, turned no-shows today asked wanted drive immediately. Well, HECK YES.   There's lot testing done compared last year, records might skewed. it’s total failure haven’t given booster 60+s yet

Drosten saying podcast. Immunity vaccine fades time suddenly fall cliff get past arbitrary 6 month line.  Go believing that, people show SYMPTOMS, yes 3 months vaccinated spent 9 days ICU Delta strain covid still chance spreading covid vaccinated give time covid strains current vaccine ZERO effect on.

It likely stay way foreseeable future. Vishal Sharma, British Medical Association’s consultants committee chair, said NHS already overwhelmed. “There’s doubt patients receiving standard care fully functioning health service isn’t done protect NHS, risk taking already fragile recovery backwards,” government says act NHS risk overwhelmed. members – doctors working frontline – clear risk, happening right now”

It’s problem UK needs economy moving they’ve decided accept high case rates. Oklahoma may additional data may interested in. They've blaming people since pandemic sort less six months type side effects older ones have? Thanks many countries world stopped bothering. daughter works Officeworks. one customer comes antivax tshirt print antivax propaganda. boss said refuse print printing himself. someone goes school antivax. Today daughter beach party girl able join friends. also going movies girl cannot go. lockdown NSW week(?) think given time find crumple. know one person antivax. high rates vaccination people likely protected virus. months ago, Dr. Madej acolyte wild: hit production, port operations, tourism, restaurants, everything else would much higher China allow virus spread within country.

Right now, almost everything open country, precisely *because* zero-CoVID policy. China fastest economic recovery CoVID-19 major economy. Life almost normal since early Summer 2020.

It's difficult get across people connection China, get impressions exaggerated articles like one. ask anyone lives China, explain situation like. what's funny vax system like 2 days.

just wait lmao Rugged individualism: nice way saying ""being self-centered jackass"" Children weren’t school person 2020. way would recommend booster, that's intention.

I want push back idea vaccination worth effectiveness dropping paper.  lmao people incorrigible lifting mandates results spiking covid cases, would stupid lift mandates, would not? CA around 62% fully vaccinated according Google. Even Delta variant, 62% never predicted close enough reach heard immunity. 
 
If politicians said ""We'll lift mask mandates medical community tells us safe so"" medical community keeps saying still safe so, would politicians lift mandates? sounds like saying Newsome moving goalposts keep mandates place forever, would need goalposts established months ago reached? 
 
 
Masks little annoying, mandates annoying sucks stuck them. Newsome seems aggressive most. alternative wearing annoying little piece paper face go public risk state's healthcare system getting essentially clogged ICU beds taken anti-vaxxers. That's also annoying. honestly don’t know argue people refuse vaccine vaccine mandates now. 

They defaulted “leaky” vaccine bullshit never accept we’ve gone vaccines like polio. They’ll even double say vaccine doesn’t prevent 100% cases prevent 100% spread, it’s useless shouldn’t get require it. 

I live area 90+% vaccination, doesn’t really matter much us locals, bunch yokels town stopping traffic demanding vaccines stopped. people?  even try. all. seriousness, hepatitis spreads like wildfire among antivaxxers reusing needles. know people administering refill ~~water~~ essence vaccine use save money. takeaway... Covid like viruses exist animals SE Asia. Covid could easily/most likely natural (i.e. know lab leak jumped nature). Nah, good.

The immune system remembers, boost great.  Black salve applied 3 times daily directly scalp. skin peeling away reveal shiny skull means working! Threaten make pay treatment vaccinated. right Even Covid, every person knew, thankfully many, ended ICU sick (not surgical trauma related), lived completely different lives discharged, use oxygen bed ridden. Really bad shit happened inside you, organs (lungs especially case Covid), land ICU, easy bounce back from. Study: Water Wet binary thinking worth attempting address. It’s disingenuous design. Thanks, that's basic data I'm looking for. know major media outlets often hammer home basic point need vaccination, I'd like see ""split reporting"" daily tallies illustrate this. Especially much lower daily death count would near universal vaccination. Weird power never provide answer question. ""The definition insanity thing expecting different result"" - Einstein bad, right, reduce transmission much expected. Perhaps newer versions vaccines able that. Well, made math.

Let's calculate implied immune-naive population Moderna see drops.

From 3/15/21 8/11/21 (closest dates data match study) infection seroprevelance increase 20% population 22% population. time, fully vaccinated 18+ population increased \~15% \~65%.

​ also assume past infection provides 83% protection compared immune naive population. March control group unvaccinated people, 0.2 / (1 - 0.15) = 24% past infections time. calculate remaining risk control group (unvaccinated people 18+) (1.0 - 0.24) \* 1.0 + 0.24 \* (1 - 0.83) = 0.8008. parent study said Moderna 89% effective time meaning remaining risk people 0.8008 \* (1 - 0.89) = 0.088088. wanted convert remaining risk measured immune naive population do: 1 - 0.088088 = 91% -- similar RCT results. Good.

&amp;#x200B;

Now similar calculation August control group, 0.22 / (1.0 - .65) = 63% past infections time.  calculate remaining risk control group (unvaccinated people 18+) (1.0 - 0.63) \* 1.0 + 0.63 \* (1 - .83) = 0.4771. parent study said Moderna dropped 58% effective time meaning remaining risk people 0.4771 \* (1 - 0.58) = 0.200382. wanted convert remaining risk measured immune naive population do: 1 - 0.200382 = 80% VE, absolute drop 10% doubling remaining risk.

**So Moderna: 91% 80%**

**A similar calculation Pfizer shows drop 89% 74%.**

**J&amp;J: 88% 58%.**

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: there’s likely real drop protection positive PCR test (most likely symptomatic covid.) offered shots. Pfizer announced boosters RCT 96% effective symptomatic illness compared fully vaccinated population. Combining figure math would put boosted Pfizer somewhere around 99% effective symptomatic illness compared immune naive population. (and 98% effective compared unvaccinated population.) That’s 26x reduction remaining risk compared fully vaccinated 6 months out. Similar ‘x’ 'x' increase boosters generate antibody titers.

Anyhow, find data incredibly compelling recommend booster shot 6 months. That’s thing though, isn’t? don’t think duty try make think accuse attempting control them. Selfish psychopaths. Agree. Hard see would enforce this. journalists mislabeling this, literally politicians it. agreed lockdown way countries them, journalists reporting things way government communicates ‘em. spend six hours day classroom unmasked students, I'm every single thing protect family. means booster every six months that's I'm doing.  I'm double vaxed waiting booster France work medical field.
Take denier blind bs :)

If want see truth, that's problem. idiotic beliefs affect us. got one Colorado. started explain 65 yet, kidney disease. said ""Don't worry. want booster, get booster."" someone learns think terms probabilities odds ratios--not even talking Bayesian analysis, here--they're path lead understanding, much less constructive engagement. Chances people say things like ""Answer question: yes no?"" politicians, litigating attorneys, trolls, there's little fun engaging people. kid got must've drawn syringes. got like plastic thing pretty big label said pediatric it. probably drew vial worth first day appointments. see draw it, seemed like smaller syringe label too.

No side effects mine, he's 6. 

Edit: here's pic looked like. Blue box grabbed from.   mask protect others case breakthrough case that's mild notice it, still presents danger others. Unless immunocompromised, vaccine alone protects severe illness death. yes Netherlands different story: (source Volkskrant, reputable paper)

Left amount people hospital (light blue = intensive care, dark blue nursing ward) , right amount people tested positive Fox viewers believe bullshit Fox news. lost 8% body weight covid. Wasn’t hungry, couldn’t taste anything. made sure stayed hydrated week sick, felt hungry could eat. try protein shakes get calories in. Take anti anti Vax bs hospitals maybe ? got J&amp;J 6 months ago, Pfizer booster 16 days ago. Since people saying J&amp;J protection practically gone 6 months (I think around 18% protection symptomatic breakthroughs), mean I'm slightly protected would gotten J&amp;J one Pfizer shot two weeks ago? fact still little immunity left J&amp;J mean booster still effect full booster? Also greater context, Vermont lowest COVID deathrate population US states District Columbia according Worldometers. Mississippi, death rate 3421 per 1M population 543% Vermonts, 630. Craziness. Since virus spread relatively unhindered Russia 20 months now, wonder point may see cases drop due natural immunity?

US States much like European countries size, population, GDP, practically measure want mention. pointing ""America"" disingenuous best. fine want point Florida covid shithole state, would agree would Americans. nailed it. goal is, stated roughly year now. Get COVID endemic stage manageable like flu.

My burning question eat taste food textures make kinda hate eating....? Anyone advice this? Med errors happen everywhere. always risk medical environment procedure. said, it’s pretty unlikely pharmacy doctor would make mistake vaccine. It’s probably pretty rare. even did, it’s probably unlikely cause serious adverse reactions. 

Basically, I’m saying headlines you’ve seen sensationalized. much greater risk med errors kiddos likely already gotten. 

(I’m doctor, 2 cents). Yes, 56% 16% vastly larger, disproportionate share 44% 84%.  hospitals can't handle lockdown kinda unavoidable. Even 100% vaccinated. Also, efficiency vaccines drop significantly around 6 month mark. first shot 8 months ago booster month ago already. didnt get booster yet potentially vulnerable again. get serious case get infected still. money cure name one disease that's cured since Polio 1950s..?

Easy, Hepatitis C. Thanks personal attack. good talkng mean [like little bit. Ahh shit, go again.  [These   understand math, 100%-75%=15%, said comment. cases? hospitals? 25%, 15%. absolute numbers, VAST majority cases, half. Anyway, even 100% vaccinated, hospitals fill beacause vaccines stop spread. September, percentage hospitals unvaccinated 73%, 27 vaccinated. October: 56% unvaccinated, 46% vaccinated. see, daily cases increasing, percentage unvaccinated hospitals go down. expect vaccinated patients hospitals overtake unvaccinated month beacause ""Weighted size group"" said.

Don’t forget Gatorade! Germany universal healthcare, would hope tests free everyone. needed study prove this? think study bit unfair. mean, Fox Viewers likely stupid.  Gather 'round patriots, denied Applebees!

*Rascal scooter engines begin revving*   Got Pfizer booster today, anything like dose #2 rough 36 hours go. 

Bought ice cream, candy preparing battle out, wish luck. less likely breakthrough means infecting people inadvertently

 studies read indicates viral load much lower ends quickly vaccinated people time frame potentially infectious lower also viral load spreading potentially less. read, studies indicate viral load huge impact whether someone actually gets virus - science supports varying levels caution even among vaccinated people - long exposure closed environment lots different people high risk versus open spaces distanced even fairly large open enclosed space limited period time - e.g. shopping supermarket probably smaller amount viral aerosolized particles - one advised wear mask lower risk packed restaurant lot unmasked people long period time. 

A  shit got day, used different arms. Definitely pick non-writing arm flu shot, sore booster shot. Right. bizarre. city I’m everyone masks vaccination rate really high go smaller city’s county people fools don’t vaccinate. tried get booster day nothing available town drive Brooklyn south Jackson get it. checks out...

* Alabama around 2,220,000 fully vaxxed people
* 1.8% 39,960 people caught Covid fully vaxxed
* 39,960 / 838,114 (number confirmed cases Alabama) = 4.76%

Though true, little misleading. counting cases well vaccines even available. we're wanting make direct comparison, done May June vaccines available adults.

On June 1st Alabama 555,750 confirmed cases. 838,114 - 555,750 = 282,364, number cases since vaccines widely available.

39,960 / 282,364 = 14.1%, three times higher what's suggested. Despite higher rate, still means unvaccinated people 4 times likely catch Covid.  Could someone copy-paste? I'd love read this.

Yeah absolutely confusion. listened daily podcast today cause interviewed fauci really address confusion lol. mostly potential future pandemic, think alot air still. guess comes personally comfortable with, know? Stay safe there! FDA approved booster. That's main thing. 

CDC releases guidance get it. that, GUIDANCE. States follow guidance. ignore choose. Generally, don't, sometimes do. Falsehoods general really It’s literally ridiculous. Someone (Biden) needs make clear cases aren’t metric, people vaccinated get covid point it’s fine, let’s make public policy based that. Otherwise cycle never going end. Cdc fauci would never doctors enemy perfect good, eventually attitudes need change. Shocking tell you! someone update positive rate Germany? mean infected divided number tested people. It’s 2% Denmark, wondering going neighbours Pretty sure we're point safely say waning vaccine efficacy infection also plays large role. understand fuels antivaxxers, reality. seems outside Israel, fact seems brushed rug. 50-70% infection goes long way, long enough dealing Delta.

[Latest Israeli debated long. Single J&amp;J + Covid March 2020. last second, literally, told nurse jab get with. side effects besides rash im battling Pfizer sucks trying stay positive. One doctor said need booster. One said did. Honestly though, covid numbers mostly undercounted. knowing they’re greatly exaggerated means don’t great understanding topic someone else. That’s problem—on it’s tells us nothing none us know everything even read news it. someone answering “unsure” numerous questions/statements tell us something. 

For reference, questions combined index. Someone less informed would score “lower” index overall even someone informed missed questions. One question tells us nothing, trend entire index meaningful. Ice cream!  Pasco, Florida : got home getting booster Flu shot time. 

The situation 52.9% 2X vaccinated lovely 2.2 percent positive, know last. looks like lulls spikes. One two serious cases COVID clinic per day, one two asymptomatic cases. 

Near zero masking. 

I dread holiday season. Rose quartz bum works wonders unvaccinating process. Funny mentioned that. get heat rash sun days beach. feels like blend dif rash. COVID March 2020—zero skin effects. Also J&amp;J March '21, skin reaction. doctor thinks whatever Pfizer got body feel like it. Hoping relief turn throat closing issue (doubtful anxiety).  travel? concern vaccination poorly timed breakthrough would test positive fuck work travel schedules. (I’m travel media take extreme amount covid tests.) peace mind booster absolute brainer me, even though I’m super low risk. Well duh, easily led. data this, may two shots + masks better reducing spread three shots masks. 

From I've seen, 3rd shots reduce risk infection like 90% compared 2 shots masks reduce risk like 10-40% (depending cloth n95). data I've seen protection transmission vaccines seems suggest wanes pretty quickly second shots. 

Seems like boosters better short term. Otoh, pretty sure vaccines riskier, surprise FDA CDC hesitant wildly recommend healthy young people recommend masks.  need paper healthcare office get tested free vaxxed, asymptomatic contact. least Bavaria way.  also lets participate favourite pastime: getting fleeced scammers They're going announce everyone get booster soon, we're Spring limited.

Well, considering 25 billion children US, CFR higher 1 50 million. I've read (not doctor/nurse), fully vaxxed breakthrough cases ending hospitalization rare intubation even rarer, followed deaths. 

Most hospitals clogged unvaccinated people, chances bad breakthrough cases got bad Unvaxxed holding beds. can't afford hospital bills waited handle anymore.

Go get booster eligible to. worst happen one super unlucky, super rare triple vaxxed breakthrough cases die covid. ever going see cases go back level early summer (a hundred cases day Ohio versus 5000+ atm, example)? Or, going staying level forever? Covid looks like ""Endemic""?  We'll never return normal life? even know say feel right now, feel kinda hopeless this, Idk. end game getting children vaccinated. seem forgotten them.

The next step letting unvaccinated die levels deem appropriate. That’s pretty much it. one cares saving willful unvaccinated. 

We reduce cases deaths lower level. Probably higher flu lower now. too.. third dose yesterday I've bed sleeping 12 hours last night (and I'm kind person sleeps 7 hours weekend night maybe 4-6 week nights).

Thanks probably, 97% effective   Remember there's also lot misinformation communities too, saw Rotterdam well, despite informing languages apart that, information still lackluster still composes half mismanagement.

But Netherlands, even Frisian folks susceptible antivax misinformation partially due lack moderation capabilities big tech language relatively well-known people spreading misinformation Friesland.  politicized, used tool politicians. best interest end pandemic.  Heh... though relative, yes do.  hospitalization peak last year horrible. National chain. went guidelines. Plus, state wants everyone vaccinated.  We're plateaued Vegas really sucks.  We're well criteria get rid mask mandate honestly see ever going away.

I keep part, social distancing, masking, got booster.  zero tolerance respect people refuse dragging out. Yes, students elementary schools vaccinated. Thanks, updated comment reflect info! Props you. know many friends got vaccinated simply companies require proof vax refuse get booster forced course conspiracy consisted people don’t know difference PCR ass, yet claim understand significance cycle thresholds.

As someone actually done pcr bare hands, yes much this. Explain bad analogy.  actually admitted hospital second moderna vaccine. temporarily lost feeling control limbs. terrifying. short lived. couldn’t give real answers it. idea talking about. freedom protected virus. Win win.

If choose risk getting sick dying least stay hospital burden society. Covid? low vax rates also low density

there way unvaccinated people urban areas also densely packed there

I fear places like Los Angeles, especially since vaccinated people think they're protected despite last vaccine 6 months ago  Thank you. hadn’t heard don’t remember did. said that's got first sentence look back comment. 

My point lot people live high risk areas even overweight, extremely low vaccination rate high transmission rate town fact basically one wears masks anything keep safe, like social distancing, could still get extremely high risk area live in. Going need one every 5 months might well start lining   new strain delta never went yet? stress point… Even magical threshold six months, walk place say, “I would like booster shot”, going denied.

It’s clear henpecking statement fit narrative.

That’s fine, wear mask long like. rest us trust vaccine go normalcy. “The name 2G refers two g's 'gevaccineerd' 'genezen' - Dutch vaccinated recovered.”
“The Netherlands currently works 3G system, people tested negative coronavirus (getest) also get access pass. “ expired September. 6 year old brought covid home school 1.5 weeks ago. husband caught asked work using covid sick pay. Informed expired, obviously take time without pay use sick PTO needed. Needless say used PTO. household vaccinated expect 6 year old. ridiculous got rid masks, distancing pretty much measures run autumn / winter. course spread people staying inside vaccine effectiveness starts fade.

Time stop letting unvaccinated ruin everything go 2G already. overweight within CDC guidelines getting booster shot, know point supposed be.  live Oklahoma, USA, still idiot coworkers pushing conspiracy.

Like really? Excess deaths overrun hospitals came nowhere? part charade well?   giving full dose Moderna booster? think they're half dose Moderna UK full dose Pfizer. 

Only people getting official 'third' dose getting full Moderna dose (those compromised immune systems). common sense though? “Just move on” we’re still midst rampant spread large portion world still isn’t vaccinated. Seems silly throw caution wind. Maybe least wait children vaccinated, that’s approved, wait numbers least start declining again. 

Even become yearly routine similar flu, really doesn’t seem great time “just move on”, let alone common sense. anything shows lack common sense. need quarantine least aware common sense it. it’s another misinformation campaign keep ivermectin top pushers keep raking cash people dupe.

No, unvaccinated. Nope, didnt anything special, went hoped best!  got coworker planning - move florida covid stupidity. No, leaves opinion  1/2/3G systems hear use relation COVID? US people currently classified either vaccinated, partially (1 mRNA jab), fully (2 mRNA jabs 1 J&amp;J), boosted (1 additional jab).  Well, yes. 

But need hear it, actively don’t want hear it. Animals Got J&amp;J April, got Moderna booster Mon, flu shot. scheduled J&amp;J booster, got there, pharmacist said recommended get Moderna instead, did. sore arms side effects. ask I'm high risk anything. glaring problem incoherent things are: different schools - different covid rules, different test centers require different papers (at least foreigner), clinic Erlangen could enter via 3 entrances - different covid protocols. someone later diagnosed covid would traceable entered door A, untraceable entered door B. health orgs send infection data via fax, others via govt system on.That's bureaucratic jerk-off, pandemic response. expert vaccinations?

Are you? I’d get it. Better safe sorry, especially holidays coming up. mean, wasn’t reasoning. Pfizer asked approved everyone FDA advisory committee felt though enough data yet concretely say benefits outweighed risks.

Now there’s data Pfizer formally asked approved everyone. expect time around. Taiwan see. yea arm hurt 4 days shot #2. prepare booster all? gatorade? tylenol? tips? confirm.

Got booster, chugged 2 Gatorades day wasnt even sore...get vax! I'm totally good. flu shot last week arm less soreness sort reaction. I'll update tomorrow anything happens less 24 hours.  deportation Texas. expect virus catch city eventually.  three shots Moderna  Total complete bullshit. Blood clots issue mRNA vaccine, common infection virus viral vector vaccines people got clots (J&amp;J, AZ, etc).

You report guy. clear Germany able it. Instead they, many countries, semi-lockedowns going 2nd year obvious end sight. 

The obvious counterexample China. 40 times big Germany landlocked Germany (both long coastlines share many land borders large international trade hubs). 

If go sort population Germany 19. bunch countries similar size similar infection rates Germany. Similar sized European countries much worse (France UK twice infections Germany does). country isnt? (Besides NZ) recommend full Hazmat suit  Triple vaccinated, family vaccinated. Covid us…it would like catching cold. Done mask too. unvaccinated made decision, don’t wish ill well, wish best…vaccination personal decision. record I've seen attitude real world all. I've worn mask past couple months except going dentist waiting room (they politely asked to, I'm asshole) nobody said anything nasty even given dirty looks. Maybe 30-40% people mask indoors Miami, nobody tries police others.

I think there's loud minority people online keeps going, stop paying attention them. peaking cases late August, Florida great (relatively) lately. 1,500 new cases per day November, compared 21,000 August.

Texas also low point, high point nearly high Florida.

But, Florida really bad summer. assume cases low right covid really burned population.

Another comparison, since July 1:

State|Total Deaths/100k|Total Cases/100k
---|---|---
Florida|109|6,190
California|25|3,037 live Midwest town 150,000. many unvaccinated rarely wear mask. hospitals anyway overrun. bubble? stories localized larger cities? gives? hope stay safe healthy - person cuts hair gets severe allergic reactions vaccines advised get doctor, always careful bring best masks visiting cut. see people around without masks, vaccinated not, gets anxious could lead bad infection (despite two disposable masks.) went public school brilliant....:-)

1 week reach maximum protection 2 weeks clear anything might caught week 1?  eight Moderna shot. safe go groceries?  friend withh asthma reading her. According papers read asthma comorbidity covid. 

The explanation asthma irritates airways actual lungs covid ... well know. look papers later want. 80%+ population vaccinated 

Only 72,3% population Netherlands fully vaccinated COVID-19; 75,4% first shot. means approximately 1 4 unvaccinated.

Approximately 40% unvaccinated children 12, (yet) eligible. Well learn much lessons west, least, west NRW Niedersachsen is. outbreak even worse, resembling something would Germany less healthcare capacity, lax enforcement all, painfully slow initiating booster shots.

Instead think, although fierce, France Austria better plans. Yup final wave. Everyone either died, gotten recovered, vaccinated. buckling long winter expect COVID remain endemic every winter out. 

Take said Himalayan fuck ton salt I’ll curious see wrong be. believe risk get booster based long list various conditions disclaimer everything listed. vaccines reduce risk. eliminate it. neighbors (60+) hardcore conservative wife got covid recently, wife went hospital morning. treating ivermectin apparently. I'm even vaccinated, old like would be. I've worked neighbors outside topic politics, they're completely normal people. Venture politics though sudden conversation becomes competition entire worth boils well line beliefs. way media politicized covid gotten many people killed, absolute mess. covid hit beginning presidential term, I'm willing bet even news. would treated identical swine flu, covid vaccines would treated like flu vaccines. It’s bucks  California announced open everyone who's 18+ now, following Colorado's lead. Moderna 2 shot vaccine FDA approved adults? not, be? got mine Walgreens. require sign paper saying comorbid condition high risk job, required state give details. (For record comorbidity. saying, would easy lie. see moral issue since demand seems low. got next-day appointment.) Since median days myocarditas occurrence 3.5 days seriously doubt sister’s case due vaccine unless ignored symptoms long time. people think signal everything enjoy lockdown intensifies. feeling people clubbing bar hopping normal weekend. course, that's completely missing reality situation. Instead rational adults, people act like teenagers whose parents going weekend vacation. fairly obvious, level medicine asking medical advice Reddit? anonymous people said ""no"" would really get it?  can’t continue life usual every hospital bed full people can’t treated stuff like heart attack’s. hard people understand? blame sporting events Could be. still don’t really get *now*, many people vaccinated. entire family fully vaccinated mom didn’t get covid father sister did. 

I thought maybe people started pay less attention wearing masks think vaccinated keeps safe. reality it’s yet guess Got questions you.  Well, countries donating kinda faster think something get REALLY fast around 2022. Btw, Tedros much good leader COVAX iniciative...  Fluvoxamine us affordable, readily available usually, among 750 patients 1500 patient trial took 2 pills day 10 days cut deaths serious cases around 92%.

Granted, I'm sure there's test, definitely needs emergency authorization label use safe everyone alludes to.  difference there’s convenient brown country blame deaths on. irony blame really lies country cases. project year, ""only"" 15% increase death. Although 2dose vaccinated people, probably like 2% increase like 40% increase unvaccinated people. 3 dosers basically ignore risk covid causing acute death compared things worry about. gives shit?  That's weird first shot hitting hard. wonder coronavirus antibodies strong reaction. Unvaccinated people getting sick best guess. Unmasked unvaccinated children drove increase cases UK. Anyone idea booster recommended 2 shots Pzifer(2nd shot early May) pretty mild breakthrough infection Sep ? finding much data immunity breakthrough infections. Hunting season started third weekend October, covid outbreak 20 days later.   California New York aren’t close high levels south past waves. I’ll check pharmacy see giving out.  don’t think it’s physically available yet I’m sure. Today pulmonologist said expects available next two months. anyone administer booster, still lying get it. would say way ideal. False negatives bad false positive rapid test fine since always isolate get PCR.  Unfortunately way vaccinate world Tedros argues highly-vaccinated countries give things like booster shots vaccinating children (and understand it, reluctant endorse boosters). way *that* happen countries decide care preventing mild cases.

We're already seeing even boosters child vaccinations, enough susceptible people set biggest waves ever highly-vaccinated countries. long run think might save lives worldwide accept waves go back normal anyway, would accused caring people.

The standard since early 2020 price normal life low transmission, changes, incentive country stop hogging vaccines.  Yes, get booster 6 months second dose. many qualify conditions everyone fits one them. Colorado California already open adults 18. 

My doctor recommended get even though live highly vaxxed low case (currently) part NYC. also predicted within next couple months boosters going available adult wants one national wide. Pfizer first 2 spiced booster moderna. felt achy 2 days head congestion second Pfizer made achy like 5 hours. Ill take moderna eliciting stronger immune response? Shun non-believers... Shun shun. Shunnnnn died boredom starvation lockdowns /s feed simpleton troll. That's good hear.. always thought Colorado sane place. states going let adults get boosters, CDC recommended booster every adult?

They're deliberately misinterpreting CDC encourage people get booster shots. go lie work 'high-risk setting' health condition order get shot. reflect they’re ignorant non-life-threatening, treated counter meds. Unlike myocarditis caused Covid itself. even high vaccine levels totally 100% necessary - lower levels probably ok, compartmentalization. Require schools, majority unvaccinated. Require nursing homes, residents higher risk. Require vaccine cards lieu masks necessary. No, antibody count cov-2 antibody much higher lasts longer presented real virus instead different vaccine rna fragments. course risk severe illness high real infection, vaccine much preferred. afaik immune response protection higher real infection. Please correct i’m wrong. think CDC/FDA made decision *stick Biden*? That's absolute insanity. made decision based available data. Trust science, politics. cases going up, much problem. problem deaths reaching back 5/million/week 50% jump week week (although checked back 4 worldometer) . US, would equivalent 80,000-90,000 deaths/year, making 7th biggest killer (same Diabetes, almost double flu). that's winter surge, perhaps still track less deaths flu year 2-dosing adults.

Is place look booster data Portugal? Ourworldindata include Portugal checked morning. someone mid 30s, able get booster? so, I? feeling booster everyone get booster they’re stepping vulnerable like health care workers elderly hurt supply. correct? got vaccinated back January thinking getting booster don’t know go get one. **Nov. 12, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Thanks. doctor recommended wait least CDC recommends (I underlying conditions). seems think chance guidance change eventually encourage 'mix match' booster, getting booster early could delay able that.

When kids take masks? now. 
 
In statement NPR, spokesperson said, ""CDC continues recommend universal indoor masking teachers, staff, students, visitors K-12 schools, regardless vaccination status community transmission levels. time, changes, however, science changes, update guidance needed."" CDC director Rochelle Walensky backed keeping masks schools ""as head winter months.""  Yeeeeeeeeee lacheeeeeeee. Ik snap persoonlijk echt niet waarom er niet meer geïnvesteerd corona specifieke zorg (in hoeverre dat kan). Maar je zou bijna zeggen zet een aantal grote field hospitals puur voor corona patienten en laat het leger bijv. dit opzetten, laat je de ziekenhuizen vrij. Maar aan de andere kant willen allemaal goede zorg en dat te vinden op de IC. Snel hopen dat meer mensen zich laten vaccineren zodat kunnen afbouwen naar het oude normaal.  $25,000. rookie numbers. Come US.  pay sprained ankle  It’s pretty old-fashioned inactivated vaccine, domestic fridges handle weeks.   agree people ignoring this, think compliance extremely low anyway compared previous waves. vaccinated understand reason can't enjoy normal life unvaccinated. Oh, sorry clear, meant terms externalized costs, government probably buying vaccines something order ~$10 per dose (for mRNA vaccine). public pay anything get shot, right. Germany. Kind reha cure treat afterwards prevent beforehand. close burnout chronic backpain afraid turning disc prolapse etc go three weeks covered insurance. admit virus won? I'm totally done bullshit. 85+% eligible population vaccinated still enough. endemic never go away, accept that. Also, 3 weeks gonna become 4 months likely restrictions. Dunno, Pfizer 3 third dose def worst.   think gone people dead admitted. many stories people going coming back alive. south probably low numbers leaving going somewhere else. moved Illinois see plates south here. vaccine free 377 apprehended violence quarrels anti-COVID-19 rules: police

So kind stuff limited US...  spouse. Additionally barriers absurd, able get shots priorization letter specialist, GP didnt want write one despite obvious medical history. Im affirmative without vaccination sites wouldnt gotten shot early. doctors lobby demanded closed. 

GPs often badly informed overloaded. shown patients put lot effort gurantee right treatment actually better treated, alone, maybe pretty old accept everything given worse off, shouldnt case.   exclusion, treated go hospital. bear externalized cost decision refuse $10 vaccine.  Sorry bad look, mate. voluntarily unvaxxed also bad look. Anti-vaccinated much North-South phenom States. It’s urban-rural, college-educated vs. not. yes good good i'd ban public transport too, fuck em, they're reason taking long Actually yes thank you, whenever time remember! friend also worried ever get symptoms would 10x worse would alot suffering Sounds like old Hausarzt heh. thanks specialist able get shot vaccination centre, Hausarzt denied writting letter priority, obviously had. new Hausarzt never wears masks office since he's vaccinated. Morons everywhere. Nobody checking shit.
Yeah, barriers absurd, wonder people dont speak german properly less vaccinated, even natives requires unreasonable effort.  Lockdown eligible unvaccinated. account vast majority hospitalizations thing needs mitigated going forward. Let rest society move on. two year old allowed family well. I'm weirdo person gives damn staying safe great news, especially distribution require special equipment (cryogenic freezers, etc.), ramp production quickly. already WHO-approved, too, since Nov. 3.  pronunciation bothers me.  Definitely yes, yes, yes. relaxed protections people supposed getting vaccinated (which definitely not) combination contagious variants, fact vaccines can’t 100% protect seems cause.  Native speakers get lost aswell. spent lot time reading RKIs website, lengthy paragraphs explaining vaccines get, that? 
With information went GP trying get vaccine x y. go lenghty debate.
My mum wanted get flu shot lady counter denied 3 times saying already got one earlier year (with mutations covered last season). obviously wrong information, obviously need get flu shots every year. Coincidentally 3rd try doctor came office, could talk wrong information finally get flu shot. tried get pneumococcal vaccine. Doctor said doesnt recommend me. STIKO recommendations say otherwise, push strongly get prescribed. Later talked specialist, course said right get pneumovaxx. So, theres lot misinformation GPs.   That's wrong dumb I'm sure kids fine take vaccine. I'm equally sure kids fine _if_ catch covid. (It'd miracle asymptomatically already).

I'm things going back normal. UK least feels pretty normal already though zero advantage perspective verify someone hospitalized says vaccinated really is? True, shocking much misinformation deleted social media. Im pro vaccine gets yet im getting bombarded instagram misinformation again. agree economic lobbying unreasonable strange me, even medium term hurting profits. quick reaction would save lives bring things back normal quicker, every day wait reduce contacts three days. Pretty interesting tax thing. love Dutch journals publish English.

And plan B. upcoming covid pills reduce mortality, trivially cheap plentiful people actually take onset symptoms instead waiting late, they're $700 US, that's happening. Boosters would work *everyone* takes them, won't. Nasal vaccines prevent spread, need manufactured, distributed, people need willing take another vaccine. while, vaccine continues wane natural immunity disappears within year.

Just last night wife go ER something related Covid. would great us could keep that. 

It really childish expect go back 2019 ways. don’t know people say doesn’t work vast majority infected/hospitalized/dead un vaxxed. I'm confused too. seems CDC FDA real power here. said booster everyone, states pharmacies ignore it. actually need FDA allow use meds anymore? lack political contain beginning. Unfortunately way children Well 87% 12+ population vaccinated, 13% makes 54% hospitals 70% ICU, would call vast majority, although absolute numbers maybe legality here. Seems odd medications go CDC FDA get approved use governor Dr somehow approve use approved medical process. really seems like pandemic turned everything whatever want.  Yes. Still 44% vaccinated hospitals, VAST majority hospitals filled unvaccinated said?  Actually seems like plateau another increase. new delta states virulent. idea yet strength spreads FAST. Local small towns went almost zero week 30 last two weeks. high vax areas going get ugly again.  sure never need hospital? bad full up. According RIVM, unvaccinated people 17 times (!) likely end hospital It’s going priority all. 5-11 public schools younger ones aren’t don’t give shit long takes them. It’ll become priority kids die, long term effects see. awesome, too. ""Hehehe said duty"" - Antivaxxers probably Netherlands get partial lockdown. Restaurants stores close 19:00 midnight, people advised work home can. I’d think would “over” death rate something like flu and/or when/if mutates weaker strain (hopefully) feel like one two things occur we’re likely continue see lockdowns places.

Edit: grammar past time stop treating unvaxed free. Leaving kids health luck seems riskier me. unvaccinated Sydney Melbourne freeloaders waited others get jabbed end lockdowns. Link? US? acute myocarditis rare, incidence 5.8 cases per 1 million individuals second dose (1 case per 172 414 fully vaccinated individuals). wonder happen...

Definitely worth risk..  Endemic equal ""has won."" According data speak NL countries, October half patients hospitals vaccinated, half fully vaccinated. I'd started think too, Netherlands going back partial lockdown basically lifting restrictions. Seems like we're still yoyoing. Small sample always problem covaxin studies. “The efficacy analysis done evaluation 130 confirmed Covid-19 cases, 24 observed vaccine group 106 placebo group.”

Wild animals routinely vaxxed rabies. listen Corona update podcast. Drosten quite clear, unvaccinated big issue, vaccinated still need take precautions. still getting infected good portion ICUs vaccinated. I'm actually surprised unwilling US citizens get vaccinated considering Kennedy's famous words, *""ask country you, ask country.""*     According data countries around world, including Canada live, around 80-90% ICU admissions unvaccinated. nothing uniquely different Netherlands would expect numbers increase keep inline rest world. Also, take account per capita numbers case unvaccinated represent lion's share cases hospitalizations.  Everything risk/reward vaccinating kids feels like risk reward. don’t need control everyone. need checks balances. Like avoiding tax, it’s impossible control 100%, enforcement waaaaay better now.   agree.

On masks, annoyed got rid it, knew they'd bring back. worried would make compliance even harder, already much noncompliance before. I've pleasantly surprised people supermarket wearing again.   around 12 Minute mark

Prof. Dr. Wieler, head RKI:

""Yesterday first time ever 50.000 infections single day. 50.000 cases 3.000 need see hospitalisation. 50.000 cases least 350 need admitted ICU. 50.000 people least 200 die. [...] important make realize numbers mean. **This result single day 50.000 cases.** clear incidence rise further. hard weeks months ahead us.""   agree points.

On second one though, guess, calls heavy restrictions heard unless hospitalisation gets hand. guess point think child vaccinations help much there. even minor degree, think there's dubious morality vaccinating children indirectly help octogenarian case rates (only effect minor indirect, say).

Btw, kids young vaccine anyway, offering perspective.       Yes impossible control everything, society wide open.

You go check every single person every single persons scan qr code. every shop / bar / restaurant / club.

That's possible. general measures everyone, more.easy.to enforce them. see people inside, know rules.

That work.
Another general lockdown inevitable point, exception US way letting hospitals overflow months. traveled work Netherlands. total disgrace. Appart inconsistent requirements show QR code sit inside restaurant bar everything open. masks worn social distancing. Imagine country acting problem more. UK same. 

Glad home wear mask indoors. Meanwhile Fox subsidiaries mask vaccination mandates. Color surprised incredibly conservative family got vaccinated got boosters.

I need help clarifying idea fits sentences rather really long. better way phrasing this, please let know:

Most childhood vaccines given months years doses. Maybe vaccines need amount time peak lasting effectiveness. Since we're pandemic, getting doses often would need virus everywhere. future, SARS-CoV-2 rarer, may give kids two doses, year 18 months apart. would able risk someone exposed virus time period would pretty low. Additional doses hurt anything, again, time figure yet. first large group people get vaccines got less year ago. Maybe need four boosters lifetime immunity. Maybe need one.

US classified high risk area since August 15. implication travel, probably wont need einreiseanmeldung anymore, think. Doesnt hurt fill anyways. Anyone gotten booster flu shot time? recommended ill advised? microchip implant experiment gone horribly wrong.  got Moderna 1 2 I’m sure booster. Stay get Pfizer try diversify little..?  That's USA doing.  Michigan got booster week ago. Partner going tomorrow. There's much covid going around, ton vaxxed people well.. feeling tonight's numbers gonna scary. work well, nothing medicine even physical world works 100%. Vaccination protection also everyone else come contact with. People rights also duties. ethical population take care one another. vaccines primary goal protect vaccinated, albeit rare vaccinated carry virus infect mainly unvaccinated. dont need apology meet someone, especially act selfish unreasonable. vaccination hesistance doesnt come logic, emotional place, tackle pov, everyone lifted cult-think unfortunately. anti vaxxers can’t even reflect mirror   That's great family actually sane. told FIL SMIL see got vaccinated pregnant (and vaccinated) know virus developing fetus told nice life. Even get vaccinated now, hate much making first pregnancy miserable (my husband pretty devastated bringing baby things/plans makes depressed), never forgive idea ever seeing makes irate. virus done ruin families deaths. great refrigeration requirements vaccines major barrier vaccination areas. people vaccinated poor less developed areas better since likely places less access healthcare probably many ventilators. Masks lower inflection rate (if wearing correctly). Moderna best vaccine date, hands down. slight risk vaccine. Myocarditis detected soon 24 hours vaccine treatable, mentioned. easy solution unfortunately. Antivax crowd digging heels realize damage everyone else. Idk even approach topic. point everyone exposed vaccinated number drop. unfortunate probably inevitable.  Let them. pandemic opt-in point. make sure hospitals capacity us vaccine oncology appts, etc best remaining hospital resources take care dummies vaccinate dying. Im done this. CDC cleared shot almost kids now, covid danger them. we've run reasons concern it. got delta variant 3 months ago, long wait booster? Good Guy Lucifer admit current vaccine good enough. government would admit that.  say unvaccinated person's argument ""If vaccinated, matter am?"", especially gotten booster? avoided extended unvaccinated family situations summer Delta ramping up, we'll seeing regardless winter would like least check back encourage holdouts get vaccinated. express prefer inside vaccinated people without giving impression vaccines must work well enough?  moved Connecticut Arizona. Masks barely thing here. guess, less 10% people wearing required. good, wonder long protection lasts one Europe looking bad. probably far behind it’s even thanksgiving yet. Gonna dark winter breaks heart. local paper, see Obits young folks ""going lord"". Yes, I'm bible belt, statement prevent year ever! IMO, that's code unvaxed, died Covid.     point shift focus new cases hospitalisations / ICU bed use? Everyone’s gonna get it. don’t daily case rates flu etc etc. 

Vaccinations won’t completely stop spread, rather slow mostly mitigate worst symptoms. News outlets need pivot reporting hospital admissions imo. real Sherlock Holmes! Btw, put quotes around ""only"" reason. sarcasm. 15% large jump risk death suddenly forced upon population making fun idea ""learn live with"" much extra premature death. 

That said, makes sense talk percents unless philosophical pessimists wants end life. Otherwise 100% births result death. life means death. population 300 trillion, 442K extra deaths would mean covid entirely irrelevant (given current death rates) would 2 orders magnitude rarer death lightning strikes.  Study study shown almost outdoor transmission though, little odd. Also odd deer March 2020 Unvaccinated don’t capacity reflect duty society. Still, 84.9% population making 44% cases impressive. 63.6% protection asymptomatic disease 65.2% protection B.1.617.2 Delta variant

77.8% efficacy symptomatic cases

93.4% severe symptomatic cases.

I‘d like check paper Lancet make clear details ,but general result quite optimistic. Personally, think far better route. 'mandatory', people make logical cost/benefit calculation health may inclined make logical cost/benefit calculation pocketbook.

It provides benefits mandates, without negatives (government overreach, etc), importantly emphasizes strongest scientific rationale governments pushing vaccination: drain unvaccinated cause medical system. 

Personally, think transmission reduction risk substantial enough warrant heavy-handed government mandates. science support fact vaccines drastically reduce death/serious disease ironclad; governments lead that.  think bigger problem language. really easy me, crappy German speaker, go Impfzentrum could make appointment online nod smile there. need go GP, generally don’t speak English six month waiting list. Additionally, need call speak German, terrifying. Non-German speakers get lost German healthcare system point hope don’t get sick accident wouldn’t know go. Like get sick, truly idea get doctors note. told online hospitals full vaccinated people suffering side effects rather unvaccinated covid patients. People go great lengths swap reality something find acceptable. Thank sharing. I’m immunicompromised family thinks I’m weirdo inviting unvaccinated relatives’ kids home. comment helped affirm I’m right thing. Best wishes speedy recovery family members blow trying deep fry frozen turkey. guess epidemiologists say aren’t going get zero COVID thanks animal reservoirs dummies? Come on. 

It’s never going away. It’s mitigation out. unvaccinated choice tend selfish people begin with. Expecting think greater good society? Haha. .

Name country/model functioning well ""none- zero COVID policy"" pandemic would way ""end pandemic phase"" Learn R0 know stupid ""analogy"" is.

Here - case need help, go Google ""covid R0""  There’s difference zero COVID (a pipe dream) ending pandemic phase.   Around 35% hospitalized Covid patients fully vaccinated. Yes. cut every age. 60+ ofc booster yet mean still two shots helped all. short game power grab, yes. long game keep constituents around…


i.e. desantis florida less 40,000 votes. guess many voting floridians died. guess majorly affiliated with.    I'm sure say given September 17th meeting vaccine advisory group specifically invited foreign researchers present. FDA's [press authorization Pfizer booster ""Additionally, public also given opportunity provide comment; FDA invited international U.S. agencies external groups, including representatives Israeli Ministry Health, University Bristol, U.K. Centers Disease Control Prevention, present recent data use vaccine boosters, epidemiology COVID-19, real-world evidence vaccine effectiveness."" literally see meeting agenda materials solicited presentations foreign public health agencies.

The vaccine committee used combination different data, including [real world data immunological assay data, safety data, etc. addition, Pfizer submitted study used evaluate Pfizer booster vaccine conducted internationally - see page 12 [briefing ""The Phase 2/3 portion study conducted United States, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, South Africa Turkey.""

The FDA made initial decision study still ongoing, initial results/evidence particularly robust September. number study participants booster studies significantly smaller large n Phase 3 studies conducted original EUA vaccines granted late 2020/early 2021. Limiting boosters vulnerable made lot sense time knew immunity provided vaccination wanes elderly risk immunocompromised, including real world data. age 65? much time.

There’s also overweight BMI possibly lots people simply lift weights, moderate asthma, pregnant recently pregnant… There’s much legitimate leeway.  sure you’re eligible? CDC defined criteria casts net least wide 75% US adults. That's true, reading 04.11. RKI Wochenbericht.

It's 12.5% 18-59 years old people 34.5% 60+. top absolute number people vaccinated much larger unvaccinated group, bit skewed sense. 

Correct I'm reading wrong, seems clear me. Yes. vaccines’ effectiveness wanes rather quickly, far.  Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Anyone depressed last 5 years US-- please let know weed strain smoking, fucking bleak right now. I'm also opinion Delta create wave bad last winter US, forecasting awful everyone throughout pandemic. 

I imagine anyone's math point would show still far beneath herd immunity, reason cases slow increasing exploding people still cautious pre-pandemic. 

When make forecast, basically forecasting people's caution behave. 2nd pandemic holiday season, dont great data go of. 

There's reason one Delta wave. Delta plateaus like UK, second Delta wave incomparably worse first one, like Singapore 

I'm optimistic winter bad last US, there's definitely lot handwaving comes forecasting... anyone's prediction taken salt rock. really need link studies says spreads indoors tightly packed arenas?

I quick declare victory. highly-vaccinated communities transmission levels low time start removing mandates.

No not.

Maybe good part reason transmission levels low *because* mask mandates?

We know masks work, fuck stop using Granted, right small number US counties

Which US counties think qualify?  think denial much people charge forcing normal profits sake. even study? Hmm, yes news floor made floor yes confused lockdown paper. sounds good press, that's it. Using [CT's weekly comparison, look starting page 8 series comparisons vax vs unvax infection rates, deaths, go deeper sort demographic areas. Last week example (the report released Thursdays), unvax people 5x likely infected, 7x likely hospitalized 9x likely die Covid... State done better almost jabs.

Interesting also majority testing done centered urban areas (p12). town? 30k people, 15min Hartford we've &lt;5 cases per week past two weeks. Makes sense me.

Typical red asshole. problem theirs. title sounded like grouping unvaccinated vaccinated enemies walk among unvaccinated. So...they really dumb practical. soon getting vaccine happen him? first shot Moderna, heart palpitations two weeks following workout, easily triggered simple activities another week so, since resolved itself. still need second shot, concerned.

Thing is, recovered covid back April getting first vaccine (it available age group yet). got first shot July. palpitations could covid. doctor seems think case, guess gamble Canadian doctors pat arms, look face, tell good go. One party made political thought would get votes. One party really thought right!  obvious point schools going permanent mask zones? We're never going get vaccination rates high enough age group. pretty clear need three doses fully vaccinated delta. Supply constraint there. People lost access gyms sports.  Also walk lot go mall, shopping even going events.  Even office, get lots steps walking meetings rooms blocks grab lunch. daily step count dropped 80%.  Kids lost access playing friends outside playgrounds.  1st year Covid, family activity going hikes beach trips til beaches got crowded. Even maintained diet, still gained weight. cut diet you’re burning thousands less calories week. 

People became hermits inside house.      Screw it, let happen dont call it. Win win I’ve gotten tests every two weeks pharmacies US it’s always free. Terry Gross delivered two interviews unmitigated disaster. first Burt Reynolds. second Gene Simmons. too. Every muscle body hurts. tells immune system job I’m willing put it. Way go Gene...way smarter Aaron Rodgers took Horse deworming drug! booster shot essential?  Finally idea way make money get anti-vaxxers vaccinated. 

Maybe could say forsythia works? Sell forsythia infusions? Icould probably convince Contagion real. /s  supply shortage assure shortage facilities give shots many people. Think mass vaccination sites Bay Area March/April. Levi's Stadium, Oakland Coliseum, Moscone, etc. packed hour long waits. Even still 65+ March, took snag appointments constantly look online. People making posts day vax.sccgov.org would show slots instance. CA insane demand. like states shots opened general public March demand.

There's reason phased approach would madness opened everything day 1 everyone. must've woken parallel universe. Truth there... evangelical conspiracy nut jobs enemy humanity. want bring fictional apocalypse  *THE DEMON SPOKEN* still heard Ja Rule say matter. site that's got national overview essentially ""The Pandemic Vaccinated""? I'm talking overview shows daily cases/hospitalizations/deaths among specifically vaccinated. nice thing would side side comparison totals unvaccinated.

I think it'd useful folks quickly see incidence per 100k cases/hospitalizations/deaths among specifically vaccinated population. folks could see data points like 10-15k cases/100 deaths today among vaccinated, 60k cases/1100 deaths unvaccinated.  5 weeks everyone gotten access vaccine (including 5 years old)? hospitals near breaking points? thousands deaths day?

How chosen get vaccine? Would give unvaccinated reason get shot.

These seem like reasonable options.

We're ongoing fire fight, morons around us saying ""when finally stick heads out""? He's wrong... Gene's also shrewd businessman... bet investment portfolio good amount Pfizer/Moderna too. ain't stupid. I’m Montana got booster couple days ago. People idiots felt like needed it. wasn’t group approved didn’t even ask gave whatever one wanted. [NEJM question.

Relevant main potential adverse events identified included excess risk lymphadenopathy (78.4 events per 100,000 persons), herpes zoster infection (15.8 events), appendicitis (5.0 events), myocarditis (2.7 SARS-CoV-2 infection estimated meaningful effect incidence **lymphadenopathy, herpes zoster infection, appendicitis**, estimated result substantial excess risk myocarditis (11.0 events per 100,000 persons). ...

The first three side effects elevated vaccine virus, still low infection also estimated substantially increase risk several adverse events **for vaccination found increase risk**, including estimated excess risk arrhythmia (166.1 events per 100,000 persons), acute kidney injury (125.4 events), **pulmonary embolism (61.7 events), deep-vein thrombosis (43.0 events)**, myocardial infarction (25.1 events), pericarditis (10.9 events), intracranial hemorrhage (7.6 events).

In words, clots strokes remain rare, observed study vaccination background, observed infection.

Vaccination seems like safer choice every case potential allergy adverse reaction. read second time, Chris Farley’s voice it’s pretty enjoyable way. live Georgia got third shot Monday. got mine VA well documented history asthma, chronic bronchitis, Covid-19 nurse informed needed full shot. didn’t even know booster half dose that. never case. I’ve never heard mentioned.   data NIH showed 3 antibodies 2 + 1 P. 

Granted Moderna booster half strength compared trial, still Pfizer booster.

 antibody count everything. might sacrifice numbers diversity, seen anyway say antibodies mRNA vaccine actually statistically different performance.   NYT article reference last 12 months, Border Patrol carried one million expulsions migrants back Mexico migrants’ home countries. Agents used public health rule expel migrants encountered 61 percent time expel families 26 percent time.

I’m assuming it’s recent Oct 22 article. 

That said, number people fall cracks disappear population. *driving* cases right now? don’t think numbers would support that, especially consider undocumented migrants likely stay public view much possible. number may recovered COVID (not great immunity still some), may gotten vaccinated already since free possibly home countries. still believe cases driven 25-35% unvaccinated population, schools open masks required many, plus overall relaxing precautions everyone. 

I concede possibly slip might contributing. much? many make through? Probably much less 1m people. fraction infectious? 10%? 20%? (Probably less) 12 months. 50,000 according study 

1 per 10,000 according study. think 2nd study catching due lower reliance severe symptoms identification phenomena limited America.

This true definitely great concentration America.  yes see places actually setting policy *prevent* mask vaccine mandates things nature like lot places US doing. today's news: water WET ""Wait, what?!"" -literally everyone expected anti-vaxxer  know five separate families right quarantining sick Covid school children brought home.

They anti-vaxx anyway even kids eligible vaccine, anyway. life short, care idiotic beliefs someone? 

I could spend every waking moment life researching allowed like support, could whatever fuck want care believes what. 

I mean, still buy Nestlé milk, ketchup noodles, might well devil incarnate himself. think I'm going stop watching movie love somebody antivaxxer? Think again. Life's short. Perhaps [Detroit Rock might sway opinion? 

How [Rock Roll Reasonable said, people also work weekends, things said weekend  talk teachers know ask kids normal

Go talk doctors instead need people stand speak like this. Gene’s always big mouth it’s great see putting good use. Friday appointments seem get booked immediately made live. Everyone else idea. Get shot Friday missing day work.  Same, absolutely mindblowing said it’s individuals choice...hating people getting vaccine society shit. anyone know antivax, outside forced cordial due work, done them. Life short deal bullshit anymore. mom said fool fearing Covid getting vaccinated wearing masks. Haven’t talked since won’t apologizes, never will. Perfect comment. top. 

Too much Cover-Judging going days.... man may jackass, clearly believes science say sadly...  Cases near zero essentially 2020, brief wave mirrored national trends early 2021, near zero again. they’ve climbed several months straight 50 per 100,000, high enough top ten nation. states may higher peaks throughout much higher death rates, far worst covid ever case rates Vermont. CDC says time fine agree prick shhhhh break narrative  Every time see name, think Peter Sellers. Exactly!  Didn’t KISS road team say discovered many crew forging vaxxed cards lying vaccinated? didn’t say either way though Paul’s tech died also lying getting shots. Running mask? That’s insane. Outdoor transmission extremely rare  5G upgrade nice seems kill phone's battery. 

&amp;#x200B;

But booster (Pfizer) kicked hard! much despise person, agree one point. father-in-law did. fine. Basically tired day so. got one arm lol. Agreed. 11 yo daughter getting first one weekend. she’s fully vaxxed mask optional. It’s required school 95% students wear anyways.

But point, everyone get vaccine option to, continuing masking makes sense. Something like 89% Americans qualify booster. Seems dumb let 11% get want it. Vaccinations pandemic safety protocols never political. Shaking boots know talking about? Dunno reliable guy Forecasting hit miss. bunch cold weather states up, near all-time highs right now. others post-Labor Day dip late summer delta wave, starting increase (Ohio example, want look 7-day average there...case positivity hospitalizations rising merely number tests). Things look much calmer south, whereas summer hit hard. perhaps seasonality play, knows. Colorado never really crested delta continued rise there. Ditto Michigan.

I fear one winter things may bad - hopefully muted last year sure - see many doctors forecasting spring '22 it'll calm begin perhaps mimic seasonality flu. again, we're even two years things change quickly bank anything yet. laughter pun.    I'm surprised hear approved today wife RN got half dose moderna booster 2 days ago BC. LET'S! PUT! X VAX!!!! Lol...

I know lots kids. normal. Masks somehow ""broken"" them.

News up, louden county pharmacy closed due giving large dose vaccine children, CDC investigating parents getting notified. children really susceptible negative effects vaccine given much. infection 20ish days first symptoms feeling generally better road recovery week.... Tested negative blood work normal.

But suddenly got way worse terrible 2 weeks symptoms like long covid. general coughing tight chest heart racing like mad, blood pressure going down, pulse like 30-40 average headaches leg pains.

Did heart check fine elevated heart rate got prescription high doses B complex magnesium later added melatonin better sleep. two days got much better hopefully road full recovery. Makes sense. Munich, Germany incidence rate fully vaccinated 81,6 vaccinated 407,7 (source RKI 5th Nov.) so, luckily lot probably staying home, number people hospitals sent ICU rising well though. probably keep rising, sum up.   10% deaths vaccinated individuals seems like lot

That’s math works. Check out: 

If 45% population vaccinated, vaccine offered benefit, ELSE EQUAL (meaning, risk factors exist proportions unvaccinated/vaccinated groups) would expect 45% cases, hospitalizations, deaths vaccinated people. 

Instead, 88% cases 89% deaths unvaccinated people, make 55% population. Again, assume risk factors two groups (they aren’t, later) use estimate rough estimate protection vaccines. 

Let’s say 10,000 people population, 5,500 unvaxxed vs 4,500 vaxxed. 

For easy math, let’s say 100 die covid. 89% unvaccinated. So, 5,500 unvaccinated people, 89 died covid equals = **1.6% unvaccinated people died**

In vaccinated population, 11 4,500 died covid, equals = **~.2% vaccinated people died**

This would imply **the vaccine reduced odds dying covid 87.5%.**

But reality, it’s even *more* that. whole time we’ve assuming equal risk factors vaccinated unvaccinated groups, reality, vaccinated group FAR older sicker unvaccinated group. means would expect die much higher rate unvaccinated group. 

To get true efficacy vaccine, compare vaccinated 65+ year olds unvaccinated 65+ year olds, vaccinated young people unvaccinated young people. adjust risk factors, it’s consistently shown vaccines reduce risk death covid ~95% got Moderna booster last weekend. 2nd dose, severe arm pain fever lasted next day, thinking booster would pleasant. However, got nausea middle night (no vomiting) headache next day. completely fine next day that.

So, might bad too! Vaccination prevent transmission. School aged kids younger siblings home can't vaccinated. Wait 5 fully vaccinated. Then, yeah, it'll time start lifting regulations. Random testing year would go long way too.  Wait, get vaccination anthem ""detox"" avoid ""negative"" effect!? Hell yeah! Let it.

This like 3 lefts make right shit Tbh, ""detox"" routine catches allows antivaxxers get shot go eat chalk """"cure"""" themselves, I'm it--so long detox killing anyone Ya say That’s horrendous. No. observed many months second dose. solid evidence third dose improves breakthrough outcomes significantly, whether gives lasting sterilizing immunity known while.

Is problem hospitals?

Colorado 50 per 100,000 hospitals starting hurt.

But necessarily mean Vermont hurting similar place. population vaccinated means breakthroughs comprise higher percentage cases means lower hospitalization rates. Additionally, different states likely pick higher percentages actual case numbers. Vermont IDing 90% cases Colorado IDing 70%, that's going give Vermont higher threshold hospitals hurt.

And focus hospitals? that's big one. Yes, agree breakthrough deaths terrible even breakthrough hospitalizations avoided best, aside mask mandates vaccine mandates participation parts society I'm sure far go protect mainly willfully unvaccinated people hospitals still able handle load.   neighbors house fire, would help put out? Yes, you’re protecting house too. Eliminating COVID everywhere helps us. hard explain, teacher would understand.

We high schoolers still act like 6th grade. constant asking kids wear mask exhausting. Kids lacking social skills. also get fights way easily.

And blunt masking wearing 8 hours hot building get easier. Numbers still though.

If assume partially vaccinated infected rate unvaccinated say 320k infections, 40k fully vaccinated. 280 left, spilt 9:2 un/under vaccinated. leaves 229 infections unvaccinated 5.7x risk.

Still, 10% deaths vaccinated individuals seems like lot, especially less half population vaccinated.  also mixed got Moderna booster pretty unpleasant day side effects. honestly, I'd gladly go exchange better protection Moderna provides. surprising amount still refuse. lot ask vaccine death bed, shows much know vaccines really work (and desperation course). fair, logic better anything antivaxxers using. killing people. nurse gave 2nd shot asked 1st one. told it, told that's usually seen people already covid. 

I've never positive test, though. knows. hell, though.

So far booster giving sore arm. First shot, side effects came without hours...so hope! vaccine missed second dose polio vaccine, yes, late according pediatrician. promised covered though. moderna breakthrough too! symptoms sneezing didn’t sense smell/taste. didn’t even feel sick got Moderna half strength booster maybe thats why. husband got Pfizer arm hurt. much reduce risk? much risk one willing take? risk low. live NYC too, wanted add point vaccination requirements certain indoor activities people continuing mask (for part) really helped well. surprise!

They implementing vaccine mandate, government forcing so. pleased it.

But guy gutted retirement program eliminated yearly bonus (even though profitable year history company, lot remote work pandemic!). I'm bit miffed, say least. I’m young healthy thrice vaccinated. risk severe COVID (which already extremely low) minuscule. It’s low don’t see need extra precautions. Lol. No. That’s I’m saying. I’m pro vaccine way. reading comprehension terrible. Good him.  God hope so. Deaths steady rise vaxed unvaxed, either becoming resistant resistance losing effect, even. top everything else? Im tired. Got mine yesteday California. questions asked type wanted. local Vons three stock wait could get whatever wanted matter shot previously. mix j+j moderna seems best outcome. side effects all, expect any. never original one flu shot. that’s precisely felt guilt saying “hmm, idk you’re getting booster. Pretty sure work high risk area 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️” even wasn’t given definition.  go fear mongering mean, hopefully, that's Pfizer indicating. I'm recovering breakthrough infection. guidance get booster? need it? I'd rather safe side get it, able find lot information recommended get it. Except believe ignored foreign research said wasn’t enough domestic info recommend everyone. sick year ago. Never lost taste smell, sick since.

Got shots March 21. think time, focus vaccinating many people possible. Even provided modicum protection, better unvaccinated. logic school walls violate rights blind.  live Colorado opened everyone matter what. rational cases increasing entire state living high exposure setting. 

I got booster today. one advantages mRNA technology quickly change formulation simulate antibodies specific receptor binding domain, matter variant currently spreading? sure glad mild side effects third Moderna dose since none second dose worried immune system hadn’t activated. cheated said immunocomprimized get full size dose instead half sized booster. felt extremely tired 33 hours later mild case diarrhea said thank immune system. Lol countries don’t even portals. I’ve never issue them. anecdotal pfizer booster still fucking brutal  Anyone mirror link website requires $ ? Spoken like someone doesn’t understand risk. 

What’s threshold stop trying reduce use effective countermeasures disease pandemic? fair, it’s local Birmingham journalist trying get word fellow Alabamans. 

Things easier dismiss they’re local.   Wearing mask three doses vaccine borderline hysterics. 

What’s threshold wear one? Schallenberg said last month Covid-19 cases continued rise, unvaccinated people would face new lockdown restrictions line government’s incremental plan. strategy would place unvaccinated people lockdown coronavirus patients occupy 30% ICU beds hospitals. live Alabama.

8th highest rate covid cases per 100, 000. 9th lowest hostpilization.

In fact currently 7x case rate FL, 25% hostpilization. Highlights 
•HVAC air sampling performed multi-floor student dorm detect SARS-CoV-2. 
•Three four air sampling methods qRT-PCR analysis detected SARS-CoV-2. 
•We detected SARS-CoV-2 multiple air samples correlated clinical testing. 
•HVAC air sampling provides surveillance subclinical COVID infection detection. 
•HVAC air sampling may used prevent control disease spread.

Abstract 
Background 
The COVID-19 pandemic affected universities institutions caused campus shutdowns transition online teaching models. detect infections might spread campus, pursued research towards detecting SARS-CoV-2 air samples inside student dorms. 
Methods 
We sampled air two large dormitories 3.5 months separate isolation suite containing student tested positive COVID-19. developed novel techniques employing four methods collect air samples: Filter Cassettes, Button Sampler, BioSampler, AerosolSense sampler combined direct qRT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 analysis. 
Results 
For two large dorms normal student population, detected SARS-CoV-2 11 samples. compared student nasal swab qRT-PCR testing, detected SARS-CoV-2 air samples PCR positive COVID-19 student living floor sampling location detection rate 75%. isolation dorm, 100% SARS-CoV-2 detection rate Aerosol Sense sampler. 
Conclusion 
Our data suggest air sampling may important SARS-CoV-2 surveillance technique, especially buildings congregant living settings (dorms, correctional facilities, barracks). Future building designs public health policies consider implementation HVAC surveillance. I'm grateful incredibly annoying, frustrating sometimes toxic family 100% vaccinated.

Vaccines work highly vacinated states part OK. Honestly think lot marketing. Totally... I've debating getting mine. I'm San Diego vax rates I'm 30s healthy (although one would argue lose 10lbs). Might end getting one either way looking forward getting knocked ass day 🤣 even factors play. Besides mentioned:

Vermont also high testing rates, they're catching positive cases.

Because VT successful early on, residents never caught COVID first place, state less immunity overall (if define immunity vaccinated + previously infected).

Governor Phil Scott pretty quiet part, lot infection happening 0-9 year olds unable vaccinated recently. 

Here's link good slideshow better breakdown  strongly belive absolutely mandatory masking 22-23 school year. 

Isn't something dictated reality ground year now?  Gene Simmons nothing pragmatic. bad America, thing subsidize greed stupidity. Huntsville checking in. vaccinated friends coworkers looking getting booster.  I'm shocked agreed anything Gene Simmons. They'd rather take chances ""undo"" case COVID.

yeah, work well.  Yep. many anti vax dipshits state. Gene Simmons emerging voice reason 2021 COVID bingo card. That's good marketing ""just pray god""  


vaccine: exists  willing sell anti-vaxxers Kiss Kasket, though. Technically, anything &lt;2 plural :) Got 3rd Pfizer Covid dose Nov 3. Felt fine little arm pain. Got Flu HPV 1st doses week I'm feeling little run down.

I'll take vaccine give me. rather immune (or kinda immune) dead. Probably they’re watching channel still believe news. Yes, indeed vast majority. 16% unvaccinated peple make 56% hospitalizations. hand 84% vaccinated ppl account 54% hospitalizations. let put absolute numbers: let's say look crowd 1000 infected ppl, 160 unvaccinated 840 vaccinated. assume 100 end hospital. 56 160 unvaccinated get hospitalized, hand 54 840 vaccinated get hospitalsized. Maybe better way say “they unable determine statements true false.” classroom, student doesn’t answer true false question, got wrong. sure still means don’t know correct answer is.

I presume they’re talking basic statements agree on, like vaccine reduces risk death covid. aren’t asking complex questions structure virus anything. able discern truth relatively common sense statement problem. I've gone ""whatever, let em get covid"" hating span 6 months. point selfishness, also absolute disregard health community.  injection site? Sure, neck? I've seen that. UK even 70% vaccinated yet. Vaccines reduce transmission although 100%. Stop spreading misinformation. Rashes certainly side effect  pandemic pretty much here.

By metric?

It's right ~1,200 people per day dying Covid-19?

Or there's 75,000 new cases per day right now?

I'm glad pandemic pretty much here, winter holidays coming. mean could imagine spike would see next three months pandemic pretty much here?

I mean, June 21 year averaging 11,400 daily new cases, six months first vaccine became available 181M people US vaccinated. Sure, September 1 spiked 166k daily new cases even though 207M people vaccinated, July August months absolutely notorious rampant spread respiratory infections. least we're woods anything worry come December, January, February! Besides, pandemic pretty much here... could blast loud rocket engine still listen  news, survey concluded flat earthers make best surveyors.

If Pfizer's phase 3 trials accurate, booster brings around 98% protection infection 

If immunity wanes even 70% across 6 months (being generous, studies show closer 50%), getting 3 people boosted good preventing spread getting 1 person vaxxed. still welcome hate them. valid opinion somehow redeem everything else wrong guy. tests done last year early November compared now.

China continue hold cases essentially zero quite while. moment, societal costs policy small compared costs US, Europe places around world paying ""living virus.""

Part problem overall picture NY Times paints highly exaggerated. overwhelming majority people China experienced lockdown since early 2020. virus present country, cases, government tends use contact tracing mass testing resorts lockdowns. Even use lockdowns, they're usually highly targeted, covering specific neighborhoods large numbers cases.

The flip side vast majority country, people go daily lives restrictions, without worry getting infected.

With world enduring wave wave, there's reason give zero-CoVID policy now. would China let virus spread, especially going winter?

I'm glad NY Times charge public health policy China. Anything pay attention getting little one vaccinated? I've heard pharmacies administering wrong dose. Also administered differently? muscle? [Saluting Heroes Coronavirus ) highly recommend reading entire article. I'm frustrated officially open booster everyone.

That's thing though. Nobody say 100% *didn't* open booster everyone 18+. reality CDC gave ""recommendations"" state governments, individual pharmacies, general public interpret they're saying. reality, anyone 18+ get booster U.S. right now. it?

Are current former smoker cigarettes? anxiety depression? BMI 25? probably qualify booster.

Personally, I'd get booster heading winter looks like cases may start rising again. course, always consult doctor. would highly recommend everybody get two Pfizer Moderna shots, please — rest us. Even believe Earth flat, it’s not. former president… knew man ran office. crime rip mask take stance create negative culture distrust vaccinated. least could say, “Hey, guys, I’ve vaccinated don’t want die. may want think thing.” Nope, never talked it. think that’s highly unethical. do? entire road crew must vaccinated twice.

Either vaccine works, masks needed, promote boosters.

Either seatbelts work airbags needed CDC insist promoting masking everyone, boosters better.

First, likely CDC shortly recommending boosters everyone.

Second, data this, may two shots + masks better reducing spread three shots masks. could logistically easier require masking vaccination especially third dose. Regardless, wearing masks proven method reducing spread stacks nicely vaccination.

Omg totally get describing!


The ""vaccine work, therefore drop restrictions, masks, mandates kinds, get back work factory"" attitude.

The ""your attempt solve problem minor flaw therefore everything wrong"" attitude.

There's element nihilism too. do, typically impossible meet. Interestingly enough NYC done best job this. job offering on-site booster shots reserve either moderna Pfizer. originally double vaxxed Pfizer. reason benefit get moderna time sticking Pfizer right move? curiousity, old second vaccine got breakthrough case?

My sister got breakthrough case well among first vaccinated worked patients. hit well past half year 2nd shot. would expect happen places rate vaccinated population unvaccinated population Sorry, made clear personally talking Netherlands, know situation Germany. graph post using data RIVM, *Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu*, National Institute Health Environment (so part Dutch government tries manage pandemic). Here's [their scroll bottom see total amount testing done. week last year 33.000 tests done, year week 68.000.

At least Netherlands testing really ramped up, see amount positive tests april around 1000, time people covid hospital peaked 4000. 12.000 people testing positive, amount people hospital around 1500. course also result vaccines causing less people need hospitalisation. general testing also become much available here, lot common people mild symptoms test. year ago really get self-test Netherlands, get German pharmacies.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Ex: Israel giving boosters 4+ months care people get vaccinated? Even do, still spread it. We're never getting herd immunity. ""what's point airbags still wear seat belt"" confirm, live city near everyone vaccinated nearly edge getting booster getting vaccine. still going get it, anxious wreck waiting like initial shots. wore seatbelt, went driving blizzard still got hurt accident. What’s point wearing seatbelt still get hurt??

The way pandemic it. Obviously vaccines incredibly helpful reducing severe illness, that’s proven. things (like masking) help get less suffering. helpful it? It’s hard say. cases rising, officials feel need put small extra layer protection. It’s “damned do, damned don’t” situation. can’t wait g rid masks, we’re still pandemic thank stars I’m position power make decisions. perfect solution. actually made laugh. Good one! No. unvaccinated population 15% total population 50% cases. side vaccinated part population, 85% total, makes less 50% cases hospitalizations. 5-6 times vaccinated people unvaccinated, yet unvaccinated ones make majority cases.

The math simple. unvaccinated make huge majority positive severe cases, prevalence likelihood contacting covid (and especially severe case) significantly higher unvaccinated. definitely create vast majority risk.

As far 65-70% vaccination goes, number herd immunity pre-Delta. Delta changed everything. can't understand circumstances change, things ""they"" said months ago may apply now, know tell you.

Yeah, sucks vaccines perfect. still effective, especially mRNA ones. Netherlands took gamble domestic Janssen vaccine (J&amp;J) turned effective 6 months line ultra-contagious variant circulating. adjust. people need vaccinated need affordable treatment pandemic ""over"". time coming. guess what? window could shift again. prepared circumstances change. Los Angeles county Ventura county Turns lying people 8 hours day impact. sky blue. least figure right person blame ... masks mandated CA non-vaccinated people.  Vaccination 90% daily new cases 5/100k. I'll go limb say reads sort weird fatalistic machismo. I've seen similar attitude towards masks given discussing online.

​ ""It also become apparent gender disparities experience COVID-19; study finds true mortality rates, absolute years life lost well. sample countries death counts gender available, men lost 44% years women. vaccinated? Get ready pay (for article) 

/s go in. don’t even care. fill form says risk group check box says job puts increased risk. didn’t even ask sister brought daughter asked wanted one many doses enough people showing would end throwing out. everyone get vaccine option to, continuing masking makes sense.

That's simply untrue. main point vaccine reduce \*your\* risk getting infected. That's enough make worth it. big secondary benefit also reduces community transmission.

The point vaccine save wearing masks ...   high overlap people post idiot takes like also really dodgy crypto altcoins memestocks false blatant misinformation. That's symptom would ask doctor about. Yeah, effective mitigation strategy. governor refuses implement non-vaccination strategies reduce case load, continued increase cases completely unsurprising. 

Assuming demographics VT general population’s willingness vaccinated (over 80% uptake among 12+) people children 5 12, we’ll likely see major improvement rest school age children become heavily vaccinated. timing time high going holidays wintertime ideal governor repeatedly asked allow towns make decisions prevention strategies thus far unwilling. hold cases 50k day include people getting tested pay? Wonder figure would tests free previously?! evidence government clue doing

China one countries successfully eliminated SARS-CoV-2, contained ended dozen small Delta outbreaks now. idea surface sterilization good idea, public health system China clearly performed better pandemic public health systems virtually developed countries. six upvotes IL subreddit. Wtf? makes want eat anything. Eating without taste real chore. You’re stuffing things mouth satisfaction all. Yup.

It's weird world there. People say :

""If works you, need for"" 

Or ""they work anymore, need one every six months, I'd rather get sick"" 

Also ""I got booster, I'm done, shots.""

Etc. It’s required school 95% students wear anyways.

Holy cow 95%!? Im rural mn nearly students wearing masks. oldest, 14 still wear them. 12 7 year old wear bus (required) thats it. Ive told keep on, zero classmates are, dont want one person is. (The 12 14 year old vaccinated 7 year old soon)  People actually saying that? Sometimes think live different world. true, least 15% country tested positive. anti-vaxxers least 15% immunity group. 


Their infection also counts corona QR code 180 days. Called first implemented change. People unwilling vaccinated already flippant toward Covid. shock they'd unwilling pay tests too. boat, breakthrough case mid September knocked ass. difficulty going stairs weeks. I’m see get booster. going song dance yet ""Cackling leaders LOVE masks/mandates NEVER lift them!"" schtick? saw mandates dropped pre-Delta cases plunged. saw folks ready start revolution eat Applebee's absolutely CONVINCED would never lifting restrictions.

Except get lifted. 

And Delta came, mandates came back. can’t distance forever. Covid isn’t ever going away, either Attracts ignorance. Ah yes wanting forced wear mask everywhere indefinitely fully vaccinated person idiot take ugh /s Nah, Predator. focused cases hospitalizations/deaths?

Because deleterious outcomes aren’t going reach 90% vaccinated. Ever.

Not vast majority hospitalizations deaths unvaccinated….I don’t see care.

Because can’t get zero near zero risk COVID anything matter.

Perhaps not, get closer are. new Pfizer pill coming soon. looks like game changer COVID. keep getting kids vaccinated adult holdouts sure get booster. Sure. deal calculation relative risk.

You said initially 4x likely, would imply 160,000 unvaccinated infections time since number fully vaccinated unvaccinated Alabama.

That leaves 80,000 infections partiality vaccinated, 10% population, implying partially vaccinated twice likely catch Covid unvaccinated. wAnT eAt ApPLeBeEs give break

The problems ""mandates dropped"" came back indefinitely, end goal ramp metric stop, fully vaccinated people, 20 months this, setting like restaurants gyms makes damn sense anyway. little nuance people upset this..

But sure, catch Applebees, Murica bad, etc. focused cases hospitalizations/deaths? aren’t going reach 90% vaccinated. Ever. vast majority hospitalizations deaths unvaccinated….I don’t see care. can’t get zero near zero risk COVID anything matter. Hospitalization. Sorry, driving crazy. wish would explained actual health experts though, know mean? official discourse healthy adults working crowded places get booster. Thanks explanation though  believe research used full third dose Moderna.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

It’s nice thought - definitely hoped case got vaccinated - prove it. 

The US sitting higher levels infection year vaccinating 50%+ population. UK ironically showing vaccinated people actually likely test positive virus unvaccinated age groups, Pg 22 (check reports last 8 actually little hard evidence transmission/infection delta variant significantly controlled vaccination beyond couple months.

Finally, here’s nature article summarizes nicely:

“Unfortunately, vaccine’s beneficial effect Delta transmission waned almost negligible levels time. people infected 2 weeks receiving vaccine developed University Oxford AstraZeneca, UK, chance unvaccinated close contact would test positive 57%, 3 months later, chance rose 67%. latter figure par likelihood unvaccinated person spread Essex County, least-vaccinated county state, reporting highest case rates county Vermont, 1,022 cases per 100,000 people reported Nov. 2 8. Grand Isle County, highest vaccination rate state, number 160. research. real research. can't show you, search it. Ya sure. seems like vaccines really great job keeping people hospital. fantastic. guess understand ever goes away! really wish would! current vaccine good enough. works incredibly well 2 doses enough due waning immunity around 6 months on. Boosters must fight covid. winter another surge. Please maintain vigilance, protect &amp; loved ones. Alabama House passes bill use $400 million COVID-19 federal funds prisons inject it? people understand anything anything. Make pill drink mist spray bottle. matter, logic part this. Really see that, would interested knowing serious versus unvaccinated would there’s definitely merit too. agree?  kidding  Sounds like getting boner THINKING ever achieve vaccine necessarily stop people catching spreading Covid? utah yesterday 43% new Covid cases came fully vaccinated people. seems like large amount breakthrough cases Alabama tried really hard elect racist pedophile Senate. still elected dipshit know 3 branches government are. 

Don't expect much Alabama    fair, they've critical boosting young healthy people. He's 50, likely he's within group he's fine getting boosters.... Tell facts everyone planet knows   Lol, thinking, 'man, gotta upgrade.' needed study figure out?  change much. use March 1st numbers instead (there compromise somewhere middle).

On March 1st Alabama 555,750 confirmed cases. 838,114 - 521,755 = 316,359.

39,960 / 282,364 = 12.6% They're putting borax it, that's good. ya know, think risk I'm willing take . Agree. actually think original comment might elementary trolling.  Thoughts pill count 1% population? COVAX badly administrated him, nuff said. could giving better solutions rather repeating thing media like damn parrot. NY. people 65 ether health issues (sure, theese incredibly general, I'm also overweight smoker) increased exposure due work living situation. I'd rather buy vaccine money someone country realy needs someone Africa :p never get anything return already billions aid past 30 years nothing changed there. People also super stressed spending entire lives within stone's throw kitchens, lot using eating coping mechanism. mention quite people got baking extra spare time, bring extra cookies office like normal.   Yes, shift become endemic. Covid disappear. We'll need adapt via preventive behaviors excepting burdens. going new normal maybe step money hospital healthcare order. can’t close society every time disease flare up. It’s sustainable guess always inevitable place they'd end up. Ultimately, long feel like tricky special 'thing' still actually getting vaccinated process, that's fine. 

You'll pretty much never convince people way whatever. bet $1000 Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus got booster. unsettling, lockdown vaccinated society. Really makes worry us society going forward. It’s nightmare scenario. though, covid numbers mostly undercounted.

I would interested read that. I've ever seen/heard (2nd hand) people died covid counted covid death. reference, questions combined index. Someone less informed would score “lower” index overall even someone informed missed questions. One question tells us nothing, trend entire index meaningful.

That makes sense. Missed part whole russian military vaccinated Jelous. though, covid numbers mostly undercounted.

That makes sense. Missed part someone exposed someone covid 11/3 found information today 11/12. plan getting COVID test tomorrow 11/13 negative resume regular activities? Russian statistics reliable. understand mean, VAST gives wrong impression, math posted correct. 39,960 / 282,364 = 14.1%, three times higher what's suggested. Despite higher rate, still means unvaccinated people 4 times likely catch Covid.

Sure, assuming covid break-through cases happened June 1.   Fox its* subsidiaries, apostrophe context. possessive form apostrophe. Yes, vaccine passport, enforcement disappointing say least. Yesterday went cinema today Zoo, neither 2 checked vaccination/ test status.
I happy government starting enforce recovery/vaccination proof almost everything. 
I sick tired freedom taken away due misinformation, trolls etc. 
As personal observation: conspiracy theories supported ones finish higher education, whatever scientific proof throw them, don’t understand it.  Hospitalizations still among lowest country. vaccines clearly work regard, don't' need mitigation. know someone covid-19 breathrough thought cold first. think chance could covid since loss smell. tons symptomatic people like going around places like work, school, shopping, restaurants, etc think way Covid. see work, public transport, everywhere. People hacking, blowing nose, looking like shit. either care and/or delusional Noooooooo really? Denmark, free require doctors appointment. Technically based cdcs guidelines nyc still level we’d need wear masks inside…which insane. Cases low, hospitalizations. Smartest thing Cuomo De Blasio ever ignore CDC NYC implemented vaccine rules indoors. long vaccinated live totally normal aren’t people dying streets.

Unvaccinated conversation doctor friend.  swear read exact thing 6 months ago year ago. effect huge. look impact infection UK vs Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine etc. vaccinate, get virus control.  someone chooses stay unvaccinated clearly believe best modern medicine offer. unvaxxed contract covid please stay home! sense compromising strong morals giving going hospital!  59 percent Americans vaccinated.  safe drink alcohol sunday got 3rd Pfizer shot today?
